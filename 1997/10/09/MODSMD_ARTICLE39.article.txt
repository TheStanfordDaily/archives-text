## KMFDM 
### 
KMFDM, (an acronym for Kcin Mehrheit Fur Die
Mitleid, which means "No pity for the majority"), was
founded in 1984 and still remains one of industrial rock's
vertebrae. The group s ninth album blazes new trails and is
perhaps their strongest to date.
On recent releases, the wide variety of influences and
contributing songwriters scattered the music into different
directions and subtracted from the overall substance of the
productions. On "KMFDM," the group sounds far more
focused; the new songs are more solid than the hodge
podges of the previous albums "Nihil" and "Xtort."
This recording is supersaturated with electronica. I he
vast majority of the background music is programmed,
and real drums are used on only a few tracks. Surprisingly,
however, KMFDM sounds more "live" and menacing than
ever before. "I>eid Und Blend," one of KMFDM's best
tracks, begins with a simple but elegant piano harmony,
which is quickly joined by progressive wa-wa / oomph
oomph-oomph techno beats and distorted vocals.

The heart and soul of KM I I)M is the one two punch ol
singer / songwriters Sascha Koniet/ko and En Ksch. Both
have matured as vocalists and as lyricisis to become true
masters of electronic music. Id the noise fury ol "Waste,"
Koniet/ko mutters the words of his song before sc reaming
into the microphone as he is nearly drowned out by blar
ing keyboards.
I>ead vocals on "Spit Sperm" are performed by PIG
(a.k.a. Raymond Watts). I lis croak-growl voice is an ab
solute delight to hear on the album. Pl( i's singing is excel
lently complemented by Konietzko and bsch's power surge
backup vocals and Giinter Schul/.'s pulsating guitar riffs.
PIG also sings "Unfit," an ambient dance tune brought to
life by Travis' bass guitar and Koniet/ko s synthesizer.
KMIDM blows The Prodigy completely out of the
water, re-establishing itself as the true kingpin of the tech
no-industrial realm. And they seem to know it: on "Mega
lomaniac," Konietzko sings, "This is counter
culture / from the underground / eternal revolution / this
is our sound / KMI DM / better than the best / megalo
maniacal / and harder than the rest."
