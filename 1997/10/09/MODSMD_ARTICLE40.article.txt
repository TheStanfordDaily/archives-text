## U-Turn 
### 
Is it wrong to want a movie to have a point?
Does that make me some kind of horrible intel
lectual snob? "U-Turn" is a well-made, interest
ing film that is endlessly going nowhere. The
film's aimlessness keeps the excellent cast and
Stone s talented direction from grabbing our at
tention the way it should. Sex and violence are
usually great, but here they're merely killing
time. This film rambles. And then falls off a cliff.
Literally.
Oliver Stone's latest flick has fascinating cin

ematography, a fabulous cast, decent dialogue
and absolutely no theme, motivation or ideolo
gy of any kind. This movie forced me to consid
er the possibility that only childish movies star
ring former SNL cast members need morals.
Artsy cinema such as this must be born deep,
and so topicality is wasted effort. But on to the
characters...
Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn), an ex-con of
one stripe or another, gets stuck in Superior, Az.
It really, really sucks there. His beautiful car ("a
1964-and-a-half Mustang convertible") gets
worked on by Billy Bob Thornton between the
grease baths he must be taking to get that ugly.

A changed Nick Nolte is lake —ah, the aging
movie star fresh out of rehab! Jennifer Lopez
plays Jake's wife Grace (a bit of advice: never,
ever trust a woman named after a virtue—she's
almost certainly a betraying bitch).
The rest of the cast goes like this: Claire
Danes plays an idiot; Powers Booth (why is he
famous anyway?) is the drunk sheriff and for
some mysterious reason, Jon Voight is dispens
ing Native American wisdom. The/re all trying
to kill Bobby, steal his money or screw him one
way or the other.
Fenn is super-great as Bobby in this movie.
He plays sardonic, enraged, tired, happy, horny,
homicidal and everything else wonderfully.
He's funny, too.
The details of this film do not matter because
when "U-Turn" is over, Stone leaves his audi
ence with only a cast of psycho characters and a

distinct curiosity as to what the hell just hap
pened The answer is apparently lots of may
hem and blood and bad luck, and all for ab
solutely no reason at all. Everybody dies. No
body gets anything. Why should I wait for the
characters to finish each other off if I don't care
about them in the first place?
This movie can be boring and is always
bizarre, but Stone does know how to use film to
project qualities of a story that might not occur
to us without the moving images. His montages
are particularly striking when applied to the
Southwestern landscape and the vivid person
alities of Superior's dastardly denizens. If you're
going to waste your $7.50 on this blood bath, do
it for Sean Penn, for the humor and for the
chance to see good old Oliver Stone do his
funky thing.
