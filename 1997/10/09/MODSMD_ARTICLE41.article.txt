# Seven Years in Tibet
## 
### 
"Seven Years in Tibet," the new film by Jean-
Jacques Anaud, starring Brad Pitt, may be a lit
tle too ambitious. Based on historical fact, the
film tells the story of Heinrich Harrer (Pitt), an
Austrian mountaineer who embarks on an ex
pedition to the Himalayas in order to climb one
of its highest and most treacherous peaks for
the glory of the Nazi Reich.
During the team's climb, England declares
war on Germany. Because Harrer and his team
are on British soil, they are arrested and be
come prisoners of war. Harrer's marriage was
already rocky when he left his pregnant wife to
goon his expedition, but now that he is impris
oned, he realizes that he will not get back to see
the first years of his son's life.
After two years of imprisonment and nu
merous escape attempts, Harrer receives news
that his wite wants to divorce him, and that his

son has been told that his fa
ther was lost during the ex
pedition.
Greatly disappointed in
his own decision to leave his
wife while she was pregnant,
Harrer decides not to return
to Austria after he is finally
able to escape from the
prison camp. Instead, he de
cides to head for the isolated
Tibet. I.ike the Tibetan pil
grims he meets along the
way, he hopes to cleanse his
soul by embarking on a dif
ficult voyage through the
Himalayas. Eventually, he
arrives in the holy city of
Lhasa and against all tradi
tion, the Tibetans allow him
to stay even though he is a
foreigner. While Harrer is in
Lhasa, he meets the Dalai
Lama who is growing up in
a world of turmoil, and the
two form a friendship that
lasts to this day.
The story is extremely
rich and spans many years.
Unfortunately, there are just
too many plot lines, and
none of them is sufficiently
developed to really capture
the audience. "Seven Years
in Tibet" would have bene
fited if it were broken up into
an adventure movie like
"Deliverance," a historical
movie like "The Last Em
peror" and a family drama
like TV s "Party of Five." In
stead, the film is 135 minutes
long and lacking a focus.

Fortunately the film does benefit from a few
moments of light-hearted comedy. At one
point, Heinrich is building a movie theater for
the Dalai Lama, but his workers refuse to harm
any worms while digging the building's foun
dation. They claim that these worms may con
tain the spirits of their dead mothers. As a re
sult, some 20 monks silt through dirt to find

the worms, put them on little plates and cere
moniously transfer them to a different plot of
land.
The supporting cast's performances are ex
cellent. The same would have been true for Pitt
if it were not for his failed attempts to speak
with an Austrian accent.
The best thing about this film is the visual ef

fects. The production takes the viewer to some
great locales and the props are very elaborate
and detailed. It would not be surprising if this
film received an Oscar nomination for best cos
tumes. However, the epic "Seven Years in
Tibet" failed to turn an interesting, true-life
story into a captivating film.
