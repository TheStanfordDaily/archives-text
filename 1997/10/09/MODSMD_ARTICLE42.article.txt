# Kiss the Girls
## 
### 
"Kiss the Girls," though not as creepy or
horrifying as its fellow serial killer film "Seven,"
recaptures the perverse underworld of murder
and torture. I didn't get as involved in "Kiss the

Girls," adapted from the James Patterson
novel, mainly because the ending seems a bit
anti-climactic. 1 lowever, it is the psychological
depth of the main characters that provides the

winning kick.
In any case, Ashley Judd
stunningly slides into the role of
Kate, a yo ;g, kick-boxing doc
tor who !■ mies a madman's
kidnapping tim. "Casanova,"
whose tiii'- • itity is hidden by
the mask he wears, assembles a
handful of such women, all
prized for their assorted talents,
in the bowels of South Carolina.
Somehow, Kate escapes the
dreary prison and alerts the
media about the other females.
While she battles post-traumatic
stress, she also has to deal with
her fear that Casanova might re
turn one day for revenge. 1 )espite
this looming vulnerability, she
uses her inner strength to help
police find the other women.
Washington, D.C. detective
Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman)
jumps into the police mix when
he learns that his niece is among
the captives. Me leads a solitary
life, but his strong bond to family
forces him down to South Caroli
na. While assisting the police,

Alex faces some prejudice and dirty looks, hut
he is determined to find his niece in whatever
dangerous hole she might he trapped.
Kate and Alex, along with a couple of per
sonality-less policemen, trek across the rural
parts of South Carolina and eventually south
ern California to find the man behind the
crimes. Unfortunately, this proves to he tricky
business, and a couple of neat twists in the in
vestigation force us tii feel about as helpless as
Kate and Alex.
The murderer, likewise, proves to be a well
rounded, fleshy character. 1 le undeniably loves
these women, but his forceful entrapment
methods — and sadism, at times — turn him
into a demonic figure. Although he's seeming
ly normal in his love of classical music and
beautiful women, his tragic flaw is the way in
which he exerts his power and sex drive.
The acting of both Judd and Freeman aid
the film immensely. Freeman is superb as al
ways.
The dark and enclosed prison, along with
several other key sets, create an eerie sense of
claustrophobia. But fortunately "Kiss the
Ciirls" did not show gross-out scenes of over
weight dead men or barely alive skeletons
these images would not have lit into the genet
al mood. Although a couple of events happen
rather conveniently, the film ends up being a
smart, focused analysis of the forces ol law and
disorder.
