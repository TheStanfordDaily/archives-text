# The 						Matchmaker
## 
### 
Even with the endearingly sardonic Janeane
Garofalo ("The Truth About Cats and Dogs")
leading the way, "The Matchmaker" ultimately
falls short as a comedy. What hurt the movie
most is its inclusion of quick and witty one-lin
ers during inappropriate situations. It cheap
ens the movie, and I was easily distracted from
the film's true intent.
The plot is almost laughable: Garofalo's
character, Marcy, has been asked by Mass. Sen
ator McGlory (Jay O. Sanders, "Kiss the Girls")
to find his ancestors in Ireland. McGlory hon
estly believes that taking a few public-relations
pictures with his Irish family members will
boost his chances during re-election.
In any case, Marcy ends up in the town of
Bally na Graa, which is conveniently in the
midst of having its annual matchmaking festi
val. Apparently, the McGlory family hails from
this quaint and charming town, and Marcy
goes through all available channels to find the
relatives. Among the locals helping her out is
Dermot (Milo O'Shea), an impeccable match
maker who has made a living out of pairing
lonely individuals. He would've made Emma
proud.
Remember the guy who kept interrupting
"lerry Maguire" with those bits of advice about
life? Same technique is used here, except it is
Dermot who is unveiling the various facets of
love. For example, Dermot claims that there is

the inevitable bump of the heads between
lovers. And, sure enough, Marcy bangs her
noggin against an Irishman named Sean
(David O'Hara).
In "My Best Friend's Wedding," Cameron
Diaz's character has to sing karaoke in front of
her fiancee. Similarly, good-old Sean tries to
win Marcy over in a pub with an Irish folksong,
even though he can't sing if his life depended on
it. This sequence takes place on the breathtak
ing off-shore Aran Islands, one of the many
stopping points of Marc/s search.
There are some inarguable problems with
the film. Sean isn't exactly the type of guy with
whom you hope Marcy ends up, so this effec
tively removes much of the movie's charm.
Denis Leary's character, a political advisor, is
such a one-dimensional ass that he doesn't re
ally add anything to the plot line.
Director Mark Joffe has tried to replicate the
Hollywood romantic comedy and transplant it
onto foreign soil. But it is all the more disap
pointing that the elements of comedy, ro
mance, drama and Irish music can't meld to
gether in a coherent fashion.
One last attack: Think back to "Four Wed
dings and a Funeral." The happy-go-lucky, el
derly, matchmaking father in that movie tragi
cally dies. "The Matchmaker" has one such
character, namely Dermot. Well, I won't say
what eventually happens to him, should you
decide to spend hard-earned cash to see this
film.
