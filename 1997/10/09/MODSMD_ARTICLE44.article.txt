# The 						Locusts
## 
### 
The idea of a drifter coming to a small
town and adding a little mystery to the lives
of its inhabitants is one of the oldest cliches
in movie-making. The town of Scaly,
Kansas, however, has more than enough
mystery even before its particular drifter
ever arrives.
"The Locusts," from first-time director
John Patrick Kelley, begins with the arrival
of Clay Hewitt, played by the disarming
Vince Vaughn (of "Swingers" fame), to the
small cattle ranching town of Sealy in the
late 19505. On arrival, he lands a job and a
room at a local ranch run by the darkly se
ductive Delilah Ashford Potts, played by
Kate Capshaw. Capshaw is so far from the
spineless twit she played in the second "In
diana Jones" movie that you'd hardly rec
ognize her.
As "the drifter," Clay is inclined to find
out more about Delilah and her emotion
ally-damaged son, Flyboy ("Spanking the
Monkey"'s Jeremy Davies), than the sav
agely power-driven Delilah would have
him know. To do so, Clay turns to a pretty,
heart-of-gold local girl, Kitty (Ashley
Judd), who serves to represent ail that is
good in humanity.

Ihc best performance of the film is,
without a doubt, that of I).ivies. The char
acter he creates in Hyboy leaves one imag
ining the viciousness and terror his moth
er has been inflicting on him long before its
severity is made explicit on screen. Davies
gives his broken and passive Hyboy a soul,
while at the same time he gives the audi
ence a sense of his emptiness.
"The Locusts" is rich and complex in its
plot and themes, but its complexity leads
to its downfall. The film deals with some
terrifying issues, and at over two hours, the
emotionally-draining, intricately-woven
film becomes painful. It's almost a chore to
watch. Incest, revenge, redemption, death
— the movie tackles all of these and more,
until the audience feels it just can't take
anymore.
Were it not for some amazing perfor
mances, including those of Capshaw and
Judd, "The Locusts" would merely be a
complicated and difficult to understand
web. Despite the admirable acting, watch
ing "The Locusts" is an utterly harrowing
movie-going experience with terrifying
twists and secrets that will not be forgotten.
