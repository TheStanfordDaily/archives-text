# Sawislak files tenure dispute
## 
### Daniel Wolk Staff writer 
The tenure process at the School
of Humanities and Sciences has again
encountered controversy with the fil
ing by Asst. History Prof. Karen Saw
islak of a grievance protesting a re
cent decision to deny her tenure.
Although the History Depart
ment voted nearly unanimously to
tenure Sawislak, a specialist in Amer
ican labor history. Dean John Shoven
of the School of 1 iumanities and Sci
ences and the four associate deans
opted to deny her tenure.
To complete the tenure process
successfully, candidates must win the
approval of their departments, the
deans, the provost, the Advisory
Board and and the president.
According to faculty members of
the department and Sawislak herself,
she was supposedly denied tenure be
cause of a lack of published works
and the absence of substantially en
thusiastic letters of recommendation.
I lowever, a confounded Sawislak still
does not truly understand the reason
for the denial.
"I don't really know the answer,"
said Sawislak.
Many of Sawislak's colleagues in
the department were also astounded.
"I have no doubt that she should
have gotten tenure," said History
Prof. (Jeorge Fredrick son. "She has a
very strong case."
Frcdrickson also disagreed with
some of the criteria the deans used to
judge Sawislak's case.

"There's a difference between the
deans and the History Department
on how to view published work," said
Fredrickson, alluding to the fact that
many unpublished works as well as
the quality of the published material
are not always considered fully by the
deans.
"She also had enthusiastic letters
of recommendation," added
Fredrickson.
Fellow History Prof. Gordon
Chang reiterated many of Fredrick
son's feelings by calling the deans' de
cision a "mistake" and stating that the
department still supports Sawislak.
"There is continuing strong feel
ing in the department for her," said
Chang.
The Dcan'sOffice refused to com
ment on the situation.
Sawislak's situation recalls that of
recently-tenured Asst. Anthropolo
gy Prof. Akhil Gupta. Both faculty
members were denied tenure last
spring, sparking a major stir on cam
pus regarding the issue of tenure.
Gupta w;ls initially denied tenure
in January and then, after filing a
grievance with the Schix)l of I luman
ities and Sciences, was denied it again
in May. Gupta decided to appeal that
decision to Provost Condoleezza
Rice who then passed the decision on
to the Advisory Board without a rec
ommendation. In August, the Advi
sory Board, with University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's assent, grant
ed Gupta tenure.
Sawislak states that at this point all
she can do is "wait for the dean."
