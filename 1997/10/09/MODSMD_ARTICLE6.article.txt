# STS chair still vacant
## One year after program saved, search remains fruitless after top candidate withdraws himself

A year after the University's decision to allot the Pro
gram in Science, Technology and Science a tenure-track
head, the position remains vacant and the search goes
on.
Donald Mackenzie, a professor of the sociology of sci
ence at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and a
front runner for the position, decided he was not inter
ested in the job after visiting campus in April, said Assoc.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Stephen Haber.
"Mackenzie declined for family reasons," added
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Scott Sagan, a member of
the search committee.
'Hie program, which is in the School of Humanities
and Sciences, had embarked on both an external and in

ternal search last year for a tenured faculty member to
fill its chair position.
In the absence of a lead candidate, the "search com
mittee is continuing the search," said Haber.
The committee used candidate lists from each of the
member departments in the program, which range from
sociology to industrial engineering. Each department
submitted a list to the Dean John Shovcn of the School
of 1 iumanities and Sciences, whose list was also supple
mented by a student-generated list. Mackenzie was on
both lists.
Industrial Engineering Prof. Robert McGinn, the
program's acting chair, said that Haber had also wanted
to "identify people at Stanford who have an interest in
STS â€” to pursue this and | the external search]."
