# STS chair still vacant
## One year after program saved, search remains fruitless after top candidate withdraws himself 
### Kumar Narayanan Contributing writer 
A year after the University's decision to allot the Pro
gram in Science, Technology and Science a tenure-track
head, the position remains vacant and the search goes
on.
Donald Mackenzie, a professor of the sociology of sci
ence at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and a
front runner for the position, decided he was not inter
ested in the job after visiting campus in April, said Assoc.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Stephen Haber.
"Mackenzie declined for family reasons," added
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Scott Sagan, a member of
the search committee.
'Hie program, which is in the School of Humanities
and Sciences, had embarked on both an external and in

ternal search last year for a tenured faculty member to
fill its chair position.
In the absence of a lead candidate, the "search com
mittee is continuing the search," said Haber.
The committee used candidate lists from each of the
member departments in the program, which range from
sociology to industrial engineering. Each department
submitted a list to the Dean John Shovcn of the School
of 1 iumanities and Sciences, whose list was also supple
mented by a student-generated list. Mackenzie was on
both lists.
Industrial Engineering Prof. Robert McGinn, the
program's acting chair, said that Haber had also wanted
to "identify people at Stanford who have an interest in
STS â€” to pursue this and | the external search]."

The interdisciplinary nature of
the program complicates the search
process, according to several profes
sors. "It makes it harder when you
have a bunch of different perspec
tives," said Sociology Prof. John
Meyer.
Potential faculty must be accept
ed by a department, as well as be an
eminent member in the field of sci
ence, technology and society. For in
terdisciplinary programs, "[profes
sors] have to be both acceptable to

the department and heavy hitters in
their field," said McGinn.
The program was almost termi
nated in 19%. Its degree-granting
authority was rescinded, but it was
brought back in large part due to
student involvement and concern.
One of the students involved with
the campaign to revive STS, junior
Tony Engel, is optimistic.
"Things are proceeding well,"
said Engel, who helped start a peer
advising program along with the
STS Student Association. The asso
ciation also plans to host an ques
tion-and-answer session on the pro
gram soon.

Engel affirmed that "after under
going a structural remaking, the pro
gram is alive and continuing on from
that point."
A tenured faculty position for the
program, however, could cement
the program within its school. A
chair would provide an "added ele
ment of stability for students,"
Engel said. The goal, according to
McGinn, "is to create sustainable
[interdisciplinary programs]."
The long search for a chair has
been underway for nearly a year.
Despite the recent setback, Haber
hopes for "positive developments
this quarter."
