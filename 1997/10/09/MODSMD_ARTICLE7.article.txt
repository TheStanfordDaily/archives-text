The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center's days may be
numbered. The name, that is. In re

sibility of renaming the center.
"We've been getting a lot of feed
back from the community about
this," said senior Ryan Foley, the
center's student director. "Some
people feel the name needs to in
clude transgender and questioning
people, and other people just want
the name to have a little more zing."
'I"he staff is discussing ways to fa
cilitate a debate that has taken place
informally in the community for at
least three years, according to senior
Courtney Lake, the media liaison for
the center.
The staff has talked about several
options, including adding the letters

T and Q to the center name to repre
sent transgender students and those
questioning their sexuality.
Other staff members want to
change the name to something more
general, such as "Pride Center" or
"Rainbow House." To them,
LGBCC is already too long a name,
and they therefore dislike the
prospect of an LGBTQCC.
"LGBCC is already a mouthful,
an awkward name," said junior Alex

Sepiol, volunteer coordinator for the
center.
Lake said that some community
members like the idea of a more gen
eral name, "because you can keep
adding letters to the title, but you are
always going to leave somebody
out."
Last year, the discussion revolved
around whether to rename the
LGBCC the "Queer Center." The
word "queer" was thought by some
to be a word that united sexual mi
nority groups, but was considered of
fensive to others. Several staff mem
bers said they felt the word "queer"

is now too controversial and political
to be a good name for the center.
"I don't think [queer] will ever be
a universally acceptable name," said
Sepiol.
Staff members emphasized that
the decision was not theirs to make.
Lake said that the center's staff
members are discussing holding a se
ries of town meetings later this quar
ter to get community feedback.
Foley said the staff doesn't want
to control the discussion.
"I'd really like the community to
step forward and take over the task
itself," he said.
