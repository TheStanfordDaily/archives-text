### Jennifer Saba 
Although Stanford's capital improvement pro
ject is being extended yet again, three major dor
mitories will be renovated next summer.
Roble Hall, Lagunita Court and Cowell Ous
ter, as well as parts of Escondido Village, are sched
uled to be upgraded. But other students may have
to wait a few extra years for conveniences such as
in-room Internet connections and new furniture.

Guy said the capital improvement project, which is
funding the residential renovations, "may need to
be recrafted because it has become less affordable
due to the cost of constuction. We want to do what
we can afford to do."
The CIP, which started five years ago, was orig
inally a 10-year project. It now may be extended to
15 years, which would mark the second extension.
The additional three years would mean the Uni
versity will have to spend less money each year.
Guy assured that the "basic program will re

main intact." Older housing, built between 1K 1 )8
and 1983, will receive badly needed alterations
such as the installation of fire sprinklers and
alarms, new carpet and in-room Internet connec
tions, as well as seismic restructuring. The project's
goal is to meet operational needs and a modern
standard, he said.
Guy also said the University is prioritizing work
on older residences. New residences built after
1983 will receive some touch-ups.
In addition, the project has made
room for modifications required by
the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Vice Provost for Institutional
Planning Geoffrey Cox said the CIP
"has not wavered from the original

goal to renovate housing. We have
added more projects, which in turn
added more time to complete a larger
amount of work."
Guy also noted that the decision
possibly to extend the project will not
be based on the fate of the Facilities
Project Management Office, which is
responsible for overseeing University
construction, including residence
renovations.
