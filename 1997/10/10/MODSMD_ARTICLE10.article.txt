# Grant to fund earthquake center
## 
### Stephanie Langenfeld 
A consortium of nine universities including
Stanford was recently awarded a National Sci
ence Foundation grant to develop a West Coast
earthquake engineering center.
The center, which will be named the Pacific
Earthquake Engineering Research Center, will
investigate ways to reduce the economic and so
cial impact of earthquakes in urban areas. It is one
of three organizations awarded grants by the NSF
to promote national academic centers of excel
lence in earthquake engineering.
The other centers are the Midwestern Earth
quake Engineering Research Center at the Uni
versity of Illinois-Urbana and the National Cen
ter for Earthquake Engineering Research at the
State University of New York-Buffalo.

PEER will bring together individuals from a
variety of disciplines in a holistic approach to re
ducing earthquake hazards.
"Our proposal was to establish a multidiscipli
nary center that bridges the gaps between tradi
tional earthquake disciplines such as seismology
and engineering, and brings in other disciplines
such as political science and economics," said cen
ter director Jack Moehle in a statement.
A large part of the center's work will focus on
implementing its findings. The center plans to
have large education and public policy compo
nents as well as an industry partnership program.
"Whatever scientists and engineers do in
terms of research means very little unless it gets
implemented.... That doesn't happen by re
searchers isolating themselves," said Stanford
Civil Engineering Prof. Helmut Krawinkler.

Krawinkler, along with Civil Engineering
Prof. Anne Kiremidjian, will represent Stanford
on the center's research committee.
The center will be headquartered at UC-
Berkeley. Along with the NSF grant, it will be fi
nanced by funds from the states of California and
Washington, the University of California and pri
vate industry contributions.
A Business and Industry Partnership Program
has been set up to encourage industry-funded and
industry-directed applied research. The Pacific
Gas & Electric Co. has already committed $2.4
million to the center to support a utilities research
component.
Krawinkler said he hopes that some high-tech
Silicon Valley businesses, which rely on equip
ment particularly sensitive to seismic activity, will
also join cooperative research efforts.
