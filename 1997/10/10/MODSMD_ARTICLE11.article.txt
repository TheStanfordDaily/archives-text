## Europa has it all 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The
discovery of organic compounds on
two of Jupiter's moons increases the
possibility that all of the elements
for life are present on another of the
planet's moons, Europa.
The finding, from instruments on
the Galileo spacecraft orbiting
Jupiter, suggests that Europa may
have all three of the ingredients sci
entists consider essential for life: an
energy source, liquid water and
organic molecules, said planetary
scientist Thomas B. McCord of the
University of Hawaii.
"This doesn't mean there is life
on Europa," said McCord, lead
author of a study to be published
Friday in the journal Science. "The
exciting thing now is the evidence
that Europa may have all three of
the ingredients."
Europa is already known to have
water and internal heat sources.
The study of Jupiter's moons is
part of a growing effort by
astronomers and planetary experts
to find evidence of life within the
solar system, particularly on Mars.
A major goal of NASA's Mars
exploration, for example, is to
search for the fingerprints of life on
the Red Planet. Researchers have

determined that Mars once had vast
pools of water and there is specula
tion this could have led to the evo
lution of life.
NASA researchers have also
found what some believe may be
the fossilized remains of microbes
in an asteroid that fell to Earth from
Mars.
In the case of Jupiter's moons,
instruments on Galileo detected the
complex organic molecules on the
surfaces of the mt>ons Callisto and
Ganymede, suggesting that such
organics are also present on
Jupiter's other two large moons,
Europa and 10.
"What we have on Callisto and
Ganymede are some of the kinds of
organic molecules that could be the
basis for life," said McCord. " ITiese
are the basic ingredients."
And if Callisto and Ganymede
have these compounds, said
McCord, then it is highly likely that
they also exist on Europa.
Water and an energy source, said
McCord are "two angles on the tri
angle of life." Now, by finding
organics present on other Jovian
moons, there is a strong suggestion
that the third angle of the triangle
may be present on Europa, he said.
