# Hurricane strikes Mexican resort
## 118 dead, many more injured, missing, homeless

ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) —
Hurricane Pauline struck Mexico's
most famous tourist resort with
devastating fury yesterday,
unleashing deadly torrents that
swept people, cars and boulders
toward ravaged Pacific beaches
before being downgraded to a
tropical storm.
At least 118 people were killed
in the states of Oaxaca and Guer
rero. Twice that number were
reported injured. Dozens were
missing. Floods and mud slides
were rampant, and damage was
extensive.
All ports were closed from

Tapachula, near the Guatemalan
border, to Acapulco. Air traffic
was suspended. Power was out
through most of the coast, and
telephone service was spotty.
The U.S. Hurricane Center in
Miami, Fla., said at 8 p.m. EDT that
Pauline was centered about 30 miles
north of Playa Azul in Guerrero
state, and moving northwest at 13
mph. Winds had dropped to 70 mph
— below hurricane level of 74 mph.
But heavy flood warnings
remained in effect.
Guerrero state secretary Hum
be rto Salgado said 94 people died
yesterday in Acapulco — most of

them drowned by flash floods.
Authorities appealed for help
for Acapulco, whieh the federal
government declared a disaster
area. The beach resort had run out
of gasoline, drinking water, food,
clothing, medicines and many
more essentials.
"This is a very sad day," said
Gov. Angel Aguirre of Guerrero
state, home to Acapulco. Aguirre
said at least five other people were
killed elsewhere in the state, adding,
"We don't reeall a hurricane ever
having caused such damage."
In neighboring Oaxaca state,
where Pauline first struck with

115-mph winds a day earlier, state
government spokesman Leandro
Hernandez confirmed 19 deaths,
15 people missing and thousands
of homeless.
"The figure could still rise,"
said Hernandez, speaking with
The Associated Press by tele
phone from the state, where pow
erful Pauline ripped makeshift
homes away and badly damaged
such resorts as Puerto Angel.
Fueled by the warm El Nino
ocean currents, Pauline powered
towering waves — 30 feet tall on
exposed coasts — that pounded
Acapulco's pristine beaches to a
maelstrom of trash and twisted
lounge chairs.
"If Pauline survives, it could
become a potential threat to the
Gulf of California and adjacent
areas within the next day or two,"
hurricane center forecaster Max
Mayfield said.
President Ernesto Zedillo, on a
state visit to Germany, ordered
army troops into stricken areas
along a long stretch of coast.
Troops in Humvees poured into
Acapulco by the hundreds to
secure areas around homes
wrecked by raging floods.
Jaime Herandez, 4<), who lives
in the hills near Acapulco, said
police took away at least seven
bodies after mud and water came
rushing down before dawn.
"We've got rain coming down,
mudslides blocking roads. Houses
have fallen, walls are down," Red
Cross spokesman Marco Antonio
Santiago said.
There were no reports of casu
alties among American or other
tourists.
