# Reno expresses anger at videotapes

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” As Congress
pressed its investigation of Democrats, Team
sters and foreign money yesterday, Attorney
General Janet Reno flashed uncharacteristic
frustration at the White House's delayed dis
closure of fund-raising videotapes.
"I was mad," Reno said, describing her reac
tion Saturday to word about the tapes' exis
tence. She added that the episode had strained
her relationship with the White House, and she
volunteered that her decision against seeking
an independent prosecutor to look at President
Clinton's role in the coffees could still be
reversed.
The tapes themselves probably wouldn't
have made a difference in that decision, she
said. Nonetheless, senators voted to subpoena
White House officials to explain the delay
under oath.
"Where the White House has a responsibili
ty to produce documents, it's very, very frus
trating when they are produced in a delayed
fashion," Reno said at a news conference.
"And I also thought we should have been told

immediately."
At the Capitol, Senate and House commit
tees both continued full-bore in their investiga
tions of Democratic fund-raising practices:
At the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee hearing, the focus was on a scheme
that prosecutors say was to swap donations
between the Democratic Party and the re-elec
tion campaign of Teamsters President Ron
Carey.
Richard Sullivan, the former Democratic
Party finance director, and one of his former
fund-raisers gave conflicting accounts about
whether Sullivan tried to steer a $100,(XX) dona
tion to Carey's campaign.
Former Democratic fund-raiser Mark
Thomonn said Sullivan asked him to consider
sending a donation by a Philippine business
woman to Carey's campaign. But Sullivan said
he merely asked Thomonn to check whether
the contributor could legally make the dona
tion because "there may come an opportunity
for us to want to raise money for Ron Carey."
Simultaneously, the House Government

Reform and Oversight Committee took the
first public testimony in its late-starting investi
gation. Witness No. 1, Manlin Foung, who is
the sister of Democratic fund-raiser Yah Lin
"Charlie" Trie, testified that her brother
arranged for reimbursements twice after she
and her friend, Joseph R. Landon, wrote
checks for Democratic National Committee
functions.
For instance, she said she was reimbursed
the same day she wrote a $ 1 (),(KK) check in
August IW6 for a Democratic birthday bash
for Clinton in New York, which she did not
attend. Committee investigators contend this
money came from the Bank of China in Macau.
"I have no knowledge of laundering," she
testified. "To me, I'd simply done my brother a
favor. I don't know anything. I didn't even
know what the DNC was."
Trie, who has gone abroad, is a former Little
Rock, Ark., restaurateur and longtime friend of
Clinton. His sister testified under a grant of
immunity from prosecution based on what she
said.
