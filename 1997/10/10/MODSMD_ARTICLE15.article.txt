## Editors' notebook Buying the 10th round Exercising responsibility 
### 
INEBRIATION IS QUITE a fine and
thrilling feeling for me. After a long
week at The Daily, or long night as the
cas** may be, a cold beer, some mixed drinks
and a night of uninhibited fun is something I
revel in.
I've never had a problem with drinking
— never gotten sick, never driven drunk,
never had too much of a hangover and cer
tainly never experienced alcohol poisoning.
Everyone is not so lucky.
With the recent media attention on binge
drinking, specifically in the context of two
men who died at LSU and MIT from alcohol
poisoning as a result of drinking at fraterni
ty-related events, many people have begun
dialogue on how to reduce students' drink
ing risk.
I subscribe to a health promotion news
group, and my e-mail account has been
flooded lately with messages about how dif
ferent campuses around the country tackle
these issues.
Although many of these e-mails as well as
other commentary have stressed attention
on the role of fraternities in these deaths,
forget about fraternities for a minute. To me
that's not the issue.
1 don't want to talk about fraternities, and
I don't want to talk about underage drink
ing. I want to talk about responsibility.
As a more than occasional drinker and
knowing that 1 drink alone as well as with
other friends, 1 definitely buy into the idea
that drinking falls primarily under the aas
pices of individual responsibility.
When we cross that dangerous bridge
from "buzz" to "drunk," however, we can no
longer make responsible decisions for our
selves in terms of drinking in a rational way.
The responsibility then shifts from the indi
vidual to the community.
Both of the men who died from alcohol
poisoning had blood alcohol contents in
excess of 0.4 percent, which is five times the

legal level for driving in most states.
Most of us know metabolism and other
individual characteristics influence how
alcohol consumption effects the body, but
most people can't get that drunk on their
own.
There's was a certain point where both of
these men could no longer get the alcohol
for themselves. Someone bought it for them,
or someone served it to them.
And 1 mean served it to them literally —
as in holding open the mouth and inserting
the alcohol. People reach a point where they
are so drunk, they become physically
impaired... obviously.
1 don't care whether the person who
assumed control past this point was the bar
tender, the fraternity brother or a friend, I
care that someone helped to further increase
inebriation when more drinking clearly
wasn't necessary. 'I"he buzz was there and
beyond.
I care that two men died and that of all
the people around them while they were
drinking, no one refrained from buying, or
selling that tenth round of drinks.
No law exists to secure that individuals
will make responsible decisions about drink
ing. People will continue to drink and
become very drunk by themselves.
I realize that people have varying toler
ances, which is a particularly tough thing for
a friend or outsider to gauge. Let's just say
that when a person has reached the point
when he can no longer buy drinks for him
self, take that as a hint. Common sense is
always a good thing.
Next time you're out, whether it's with
friends or colleagues, at a bar or party, make
it your responsibility to intervene whenever
you suspect that the situation seems out of
control. It's sometimes a courtesy and often
a necessity, but it's also a matter of human
decency.
