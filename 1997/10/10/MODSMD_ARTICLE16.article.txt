Band's intent misinterpreted:
it's just satire
Oh dear! The band's performance last
Saturday "centered around old stereotypes
rather than old-fashioned college rivalry?"
Golly! That sounds much less good-heart
ed than when I visited South Bend as a
band member in 1989 and the crowd
greeted us with such wholesome taunts as
"sit down you goddamned Californian fag
gots."
You can prattle on all you like about
your various pieties, but in the end —its ,
just a half-time show, and it's just satire. I've
read the band's scripts and found they lam
pooned the implicit racism of the "fighting
Irish," a concept that however beloved, is
just as wrong-headed as the noble "Indian"
Stanford abolished long ago.
So to every tender, wounded soul who's
about to write an "imagine my pain" letter
to the Daily: get a grip, grow a spine,
develop a sense of humor and spare us the
endless platitudes about "diversity." The
band attacked the very stereotyping
they're accused of exploiting. And besides,
it's about time someone trashed "River
dance."

Band's performance outright
bigotry
This past Saturday at the Notre Dame,
Stanford game, I witnessed an atrocity that
is practically beyond description. No, I am
not talking about the performance of the
Notre Dame football team, 1 am referring
to the shameful display put on by the Stan
ford Band. The outright bigotry and the
vituperative, demeaning treatment it gave to
the Irish Catholic heritage associated with
Notre Dame bordered on the blasphemous.
TTiis debauchery is destined to replace the
performance the Band gave back in the
closing seconds of the 19H4 Big Game as the
most infamous of all Band moments.
I have always had a great deal of respect
for Stanford University, and I've always
admired its apparent commitment to intel
lectual excellence. Stanford enjoys the high
est level of prestige far and wide. Naturally,
1 was expecting something indicative of this
level of talent from the Band. Those high
expectations only made the shameful per
formance that much more shocking.
The Band began with a flippant treat
ment of the famine of the 184<)s and the
blithe that destroyed the potatoes and deci
mated the Irish. Historians estimate that this
event caused the death of one million peo

pie in Ireland, and the forced emigration
(often resulting in more deaths on the "cof
fin ships") of another million. Such a tragic
event in our history is not to be treated with
such levity.
The Irish race was also scathingly
referred to as a race with practically no cul
ture to speak of. Ireland without culture?
Where, oh, where have these children been
trained?
Perhaps the Stanford curriculum ignores
the impact the Irish race had in preserving
Western culture from the destruction of the
barbarian hordes after the fall of Rome.
They might do well to consider studying this
important aspect of history in their Western
Civ courses (assuming they still have some).
It finally reached the bottom of inflam
matory atrocity with the implication of the
Irish, as a race, in the terrorism of the IRA!
At the end of this incendiary perfor
mance, the narrator, half in jest, half in
embarrassment, commented that he didn't
actually write the script, he just read it.
Sounds vaguely similar to what the Nazi
pawns said at Nuremberg.
It is absolutely beyond belief that such
an abomination can be inflicted on an
American audience in these enlightened
'90s. Isn't this the age of sensitivity? The age
of diversity? Diversity! 1 thought that was

the trump card of the '90s! And Stanford!
Good heavens, is there any other university
that congratulates itself so boisterously on
its pursuit of diversity? On its "multicultur
al" achievements? On its commitment to
non-discrimination? Why, Stanford even
has a "Diversity Day" scheduled for Oct.
18! But don't be fooled by all this chest
thumping and posturing — when it comes
to diversity, the Stanford student body is as
hypocritical as it is ignorant.
And it was the ignorance of this display
that was the most tragic, particularly the
denouncing of the Irish race as being practi
cally without culture. Can such blatant igno
rance exist on any campus in America? Do
they really believe that?
Again. I believe that Stanford would do
well to offer a course on Irish history and
culture to its students. They could even pat
tern it on the Irish courses offered at Notre
Dame. In fact, they would be well served to
offer this course in place of some of their
other "diversity fostering" courses such as:
• Philosophy 172-272. Is Morality
Too Demanding? (Exploration of one of
the most damning criticisms of moral theo
ries, that they demand too much. Critics
have argued that prominent moral theories
require moral agents to act in ways that are
impossible or, if possible, undesirable.)

• Anthropology 280. Ethnographic
approaches to Cultural Diversity in School
ing. (The cultural process is approached by
acquiring techniques of observation, inter
view, and interpretation of behavior in con
text, ... and being sensitized to one's own
culture and how it influences perception
and interpretation of behavior.)
• Feminist Studies 240/340. Lesbian
Communities and Identities. (Scholarship
and research on the lesbian experience.
Issues of homophobia, lesbian intimacy and
sexuality, femme and butch roles, lesbian
separatism and the diversity of lesbian com
munities and identities.)
Well, if this is its standard of "culture"
and "civilization." perhaps it is no wonder it
holds Catholic Ireland in such low esteem.
The Irish have always had this thing about
absolute morality.
Leland and Jane Stanford had such high
goals for this university. As Mrs. Stanford
said in 1902, "The University was...
designed for the betterment of mankind
morally, spiritually, intellectually, physically
and materially." I'm afraid that if you con
sider the performance of their student pop
ulation in the most important of these
objectives, Stanford is a dismal failure.

endless platitudes about "diversity." The
band attacked the very stereotyping
they're accused of exploiting. And besides,
it's about time someone trashed "River
dance."

Band's performance outright
bigotry
This past Saturday at the Notre Dame,
Stanford game, I witnessed an atrocity that
is practically beyond description. No, I am
not talking about the performance of the
Notre Dame football team, 1 am referring
to the shameful display put on by the Stan
ford Band. The outright bigotry and the
vituperative, demeaning treatment it gave to
the Irish Catholic heritage associated with
Notre Dame bordered on the blasphemous.
TTiis debauchery is destined to replace the
performance the Band gave back in the
closing seconds of the 19H4 Big Game as the
most infamous of all Band moments.
I have always had a great deal of respect
for Stanford University, and I've always
admired its apparent commitment to intel
lectual excellence. Stanford enjoys the high
est level of prestige far and wide. Naturally,
1 was expecting something indicative of this
level of talent from the Band. Those high
expectations only made the shameful per
formance that much more shocking.
The Band began with a flippant treat
ment of the famine of the 184<)s and the
blithe that destroyed the potatoes and deci
mated the Irish. Historians estimate that this
event caused the death of one million peo

pie in Ireland, and the forced emigration
(often resulting in more deaths on the "cof
fin ships") of another million. Such a tragic
event in our history is not to be treated with
such levity.
The Irish race was also scathingly
referred to as a race with practically no cul
ture to speak of. Ireland without culture?
Where, oh, where have these children been
trained?
Perhaps the Stanford curriculum ignores
the impact the Irish race had in preserving
Western culture from the destruction of the
barbarian hordes after the fall of Rome.
They might do well to consider studying this
important aspect of history in their Western
Civ courses (assuming they still have some).
It finally reached the bottom of inflam
matory atrocity with the implication of the
Irish, as a race, in the terrorism of the IRA!
At the end of this incendiary perfor
mance, the narrator, half in jest, half in
embarrassment, commented that he didn't
actually write the script, he just read it.
Sounds vaguely similar to what the Nazi
pawns said at Nuremberg.
It is absolutely beyond belief that such
an abomination can be inflicted on an
American audience in these enlightened
'90s. Isn't this the age of sensitivity? The age
of diversity? Diversity! 1 thought that was

the trump card of the '90s! And Stanford!
Good heavens, is there any other university
that congratulates itself so boisterously on
its pursuit of diversity? On its "multicultur
al" achievements? On its commitment to
non-discrimination? Why, Stanford even
has a "Diversity Day" scheduled for Oct.
18! But don't be fooled by all this chest
thumping and posturing — when it comes
to diversity, the Stanford student body is as
hypocritical as it is ignorant.
And it was the ignorance of this display
that was the most tragic, particularly the
denouncing of the Irish race as being practi
cally without culture. Can such blatant igno
rance exist on any campus in America? Do
they really believe that?
Again. I believe that Stanford would do
well to offer a course on Irish history and
culture to its students. They could even pat
tern it on the Irish courses offered at Notre
Dame. In fact, they would be well served to
offer this course in place of some of their
other "diversity fostering" courses such as:
• Philosophy 172-272. Is Morality
Too Demanding? (Exploration of one of
the most damning criticisms of moral theo
ries, that they demand too much. Critics
have argued that prominent moral theories
require moral agents to act in ways that are
impossible or, if possible, undesirable.)

• Anthropology 280. Ethnographic
approaches to Cultural Diversity in School
ing. (The cultural process is approached by
acquiring techniques of observation, inter
view, and interpretation of behavior in con
text, ... and being sensitized to one's own
culture and how it influences perception
and interpretation of behavior.)
• Feminist Studies 240/340. Lesbian
Communities and Identities. (Scholarship
and research on the lesbian experience.
Issues of homophobia, lesbian intimacy and
sexuality, femme and butch roles, lesbian
separatism and the diversity of lesbian com
munities and identities.)
Well, if this is its standard of "culture"
and "civilization." perhaps it is no wonder it
holds Catholic Ireland in such low esteem.
The Irish have always had this thing about
absolute morality.
Leland and Jane Stanford had such high
goals for this university. As Mrs. Stanford
said in 1902, "The University was...
designed for the betterment of mankind
morally, spiritually, intellectually, physically
and materially." I'm afraid that if you con
sider the performance of their student pop
ulation in the most important of these
objectives, Stanford is a dismal failure.
