## We're all messed up 
### 
The popular
perception is that
people don't date
at Stanford. I'm not talk
ing about hooking up
after (or more likely dur
ing) a frat party. I'm not
talking about those peo
ple with long distance

boyfriends or girlfriends who have truly
incredible phone bills. And I'm also not
talking about the few lucky people on this
campus who are currently participating in
a fairly long term, committed relationship,
like myself (that's a shameless plug, but I
can't help but declare to the world that
yes, I have a girlfriend... awwww yeah!).
I'm not talking about any of those people.
I'm talking about dating.
Now, three years at Stanford have
given me ample time and experience to
tap into the root of Stanford student frus
trations in the dating arena. Careful
research and thought have brought me to
one undeniable conclusion:
You people are messed up.
No, that's not a typographical error.
And I'm sorry I can't put it more
euphemistically, but nothing quite cap
tures the flavor, the essence, the gusto if
you will, of what I'm saying better than the
word "messed." You might think it diffi
cult to even find people worthy of dating
because you justifiably believe that most
of them are pretty screwed up in the head.
And guess what? So are you.

Despite being messed up, there are
some Stanford students who are only
quasi-messed up. If you are one of those
people, here's a useful guide of what to
look out for when determining whether or
not to date someone at Stanford:
They have a boyfriend or girlfriend
hack home, hut they have an "open rela
tionship.
These people should wear scarlet W's
on their foreheads for "Watch out! I'm
gonna seduce you, entice you, make you
think I like you more than my love inter
est back home, but in reality, you're noth
ing more than a few empty condom wrap
pers accidentally left in my gym bag."
They have lots of baggage.
I'm not talking about the alligator
variety (unless they're into, you know,
that bestiality thing). I'm talking emo
tional baggage that makes them totally
unfit for anything more than the role of
study partner.
These are generally people who have
had a particularly harsh break-up (there is
no statute of limitations on this; they
might still be incredibly upset about
Bobby kissing Suzie behind the monkey
bars in first grade). Be particularly wary of
dating anyone who denies they have bag
gage.
They are bad, evil people.
Danger certainly has its own appeal,
but for God's sake people, would you
scream "I'm an American!" in a crowded
Iraqi marketplace, or would you ever run

for the ASSU Senate? There's a differ
ence between being brave and being
stupid. Do not be convinced by that little
voice in your head that says you can
change them, because you can't. Date
them, and they'll put you on the fast track
to hell. Would you pet a rattlesnake?
Would you kiss the mean postal worker?
Are you getting my point?
They're attractive, and they know it.
Just think of the damage Barney could
wreak if he actually realized he was a big
carnivorous dinosaur. I mean, he would
eat up those funky little kids he plays with
all the time.
Same thing with people. Once they
achieve self-realization (that is, they've
been told all their lives they're hot, and
now they finally believe it), they can use
that knowledge of themselves to destroy
you for believing that they, the god or god
dess of beauty reincarnate, would actually
want to be your "significant other."
You might be a really good looking
person, but let's face it, there are a lot of
good looking people on this campus, and
why would they order one entree when
they can enjoy the buffet?
My advice? Don't just watch TV on Fri
day and Saturday nights and be bitter.
