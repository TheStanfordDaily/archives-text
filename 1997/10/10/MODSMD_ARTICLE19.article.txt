## Tienlon Ho Americanization strikes the United Kingdom 
### 
FOUR HOURS NORTH of London,
three hours south of Glasgow and 16
hours by plane from Stanford is the
town of Bowness, where the local popula
tion of 4,500 still breeds Herdwick sheep
within little pastures framed by miles of
stone walls. The walls are miniature next to
Hadrian's device, but like his, have hun
dreds of years quietly kept the sheep in and
the wolves out.
From any angle, the land spreads from
horizon to horizon and is overseen by the
Lake District National Park, the English
equivalent of our Yosemite. But the land
here is rolling and speckled only by the
occasional hiker and never the Winnebago.
A brief trek over the hills leads into
town, where the cobblestone walks parallel
the new blacktop roads. They are solely for
the convenience of the tour buses that regu
larly deliver people carrying cameras to
snap idyllic life and Beatrix Potter's cottage.
They pile out of the buses starting
around 10 a.m. on weekdays, coming from
all over the world, most hoping that what
we see is authentic and found only in Bow
ness.
After all, this is why I came to England.
For two quarters, the staffers at the Over
seas Resource Center had built in me wary
anticipation for the inevitable "culture

shock," beginning with the sight of shelves
and shelves of unrecognizable brands. Like
most of us here, 1 prepared for this by stock
ing up on my favorite shampoo, Tylenol,
and rolls and rolls of AFGA film. Stanford
in Oxford is 52 Americans with 1()4 bottles
of conditioner.
But way off away from the bustle of
Oxford is the quiet of Bowness, where the
traffic slows only for the confused Ameri
cans on the right side of the road. Amid the
blue and red road signs, Bownessian mer
chants have stuck to traditional painted
wood signs. So, up and down the streets,
pubs advertise English beers. The cafes
offer traditional English breakfasts. Bed
and breakfasts entice with a color TV in
every room.
But, as any traveler knows, restaurants
and hotels are tourist havens. The real tra
dition, say the guide books, is found else
where.
In Bowness' "traditional" corner mar
ket, a one room establishment, there are
just four rows of shelves that fall below eye
level. They only have one checkout with no
conveyor belt and you have to bag every
thing yourself. They stock all sorts of things,
like English digestive crackers, fruity malt
loaf, an assortment of English-style scones.
Bio yogurt and Pepsi in tiny eight ounce

cans. They even have a video stand that
only offers movies released in the United
States within the past two years.
Down the street in the quaint wool cloth
iers, they have piles and piles of handmade
sweaters and scarves next to a rack of gen
uine kilts. Everything is made in the UK so
the styles, of course, aren't at all like at
home. There is definitely a lot of plaid, but
the salesperson will tell you that if you don't
find what you like, you might try one of the
store's other branches that are in London,
Oxford, and several other cities.
Still further down the road, the traffic
calms down. The main attraction is a local
cinema that has only two screens and which
still posts the current showings on huge gold
painted eaves: The Full Monty and Volcano.
I suppose it was predictable that the
town itself would be a poor example of
'genuine' England, after all the tourists pour
in on the buses every three hours. But with
a closer look emerges the truth that even
the idyllic fields, the famed Herdwick sheep
are tagged on their bums with bright red
splats of spray paint, and many wall repairs
have been hastily done with a couple meters
of barb wire.
If Bowness is a questionable example of
pure England — a town surrounded by
countryside, isolated by lakes and rivers, the

relative shyness of its people, and its anti
tourism attractions of continuous fields of
livestock — it is obvious that America has
slid its way into this country.
Everywhere I have seen so far, the land
and people are beautiful. They have their
own unique perceptions of course, and their
own experiences. But everywhere it is also
evident that England is no longer quite so
far from the United States.
On my way home from Bowness, some
where between Oxenholm and Coventry,
the steward announced a selection of
cheeseburgers and french fries, not chips,
were available in the buffet car. On the very
same train, a girl from Vanderbilt sat near
by a group of students from Mississippi
State who were diagonal from four students
from Stanford.
Back home at Oxford, I see Fords and
Hondas putt through the urban sprawl
everyday. Across from the our homebase at
65 High St. is a Pizza Hut, which serves up
pies, New York style.
In the supermarkets down the road, next
to the basmati rice is genuine American
long grain. Its selection of American sodas
is as complete as any Safeway. Tropicana
costs twice as much but is favored over the
British version, which itself boasts Florida
grown

The newsstands sell USA Today and
The New Yorker. Pictures of Cameron
Diaz and Leonardo di Caprio grace the
magazine covers, American stars whose
ancestral blood notably was once imported
from but now exported back to Europe. On
TV, Seinfeld is a regularly scheduled pro
grain. It is sometimes hard to find British
accents on screen.
Most Hrits don't always wear jeans, but if
they wanted to they could stop by the (iap
that is just down past the cafe that special
izes in 20 flavors of Snapple.
A little further that down that direction
is the McDonald's that every American
hears exists on every corner of every street
in the world. And here it does actually sit
and here it succeeds in stealing the cus
tomers from The White Morse, a smoky
pub that only offers smoked salmon sand
wiches and cucumber.
Anil then across from the White 1 lorse is
a bus stop, where the most common desti
nation is 1 ondon, 620 square miles of even
greater urban scrawl where likely even
more authentic America can be found.
Commercialism is everywhere and has gone
beyond University Ave.
Tienlon Ho is studying tit the Stanford in
Oxford program.
