# Haas Center sees fewer volunteers

Several community service orga
nizations on campus are short on
volunteers this year and are strug
gling to recruit more committed
members.
Student sign ups for the differ
ent service groups at publicity
events such as Music and Fun
Under the Sun during Orientation,
yesterday's open house and mem
bership drives were promising, but
actual turnout to the informational
meetings of some groups was sur
prisingly low.
Together Each Accomplishes
More, which provides recreational
activities and tutoring for East Palo
Alto students, is one example of a
service group short on volunteers.
Senior Matt Messinger, student
coordinator of TEAM, attributes
this shortage to the multitude of
groups at Stanford, community ser

ing for members.
"The interest in volunteer work
is there, it is just dispersed among
many groups," he said.
Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition also got a lot of sign-ups
but not a lot of committed interest,

said sophomore Shannon Frank,
SHAC student coordinator.
"I think it's difficult to come to
Stanford, with its myriad activities,
and believe that you'll have time to
commit to anything," she said.
Frank also attributed the low
turnout rate to the fact that SH AG's
big membership drives take place
during the first week of school
"when new students have a million
other things to think about."
With so many different groups to
choose from, strategic and exten
sive publicity may have contributed
to the high turnout and commit
ment to United Students for Veter
ans' Health, which does social work
and recreational activities with
Alzheimer's patients.
Senior Rahul Khurana, USVH
national director, said the group's
aggressive publicizing efforts,
which consisted of e-mail to resi
dent assistants, announcements at
house meetings and flyering of
dorms may have been a significant
factor in the increased number of
volunteers.
The nature of the service work
done in USVH also seems to attract
more students and contribute to a
