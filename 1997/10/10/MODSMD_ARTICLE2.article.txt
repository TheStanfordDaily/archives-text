# Haas Center sees fewer volunteers
## 
### Connie Chang Contributing writer 
Several community service orga
nizations on campus are short on
volunteers this year and are strug
gling to recruit more committed
members.
Student sign ups for the differ
ent service groups at publicity
events such as Music and Fun
Under the Sun during Orientation,
yesterday's open house and mem
bership drives were promising, but
actual turnout to the informational
meetings of some groups was sur
prisingly low.
Together Each Accomplishes
More, which provides recreational
activities and tutoring for East Palo
Alto students, is one example of a
service group short on volunteers.
Senior Matt Messinger, student
coordinator of TEAM, attributes
this shortage to the multitude of
groups at Stanford, community ser
vice and otherwise, that are compet
ing for members.
"The interest in volunteer work
is there, it is just dispersed among
many groups," he said.
Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition also got a lot of sign-ups
but not a lot of committed interest,

said sophomore Shannon Frank,
SHAC student coordinator.
"I think it's difficult to come to
Stanford, with its myriad activities,
and believe that you'll have time to
commit to anything," she said.
Frank also attributed the low
turnout rate to the fact that SH AG's
big membership drives take place
during the first week of school
"when new students have a million
other things to think about."
With so many different groups to
choose from, strategic and exten
sive publicity may have contributed
to the high turnout and commit
ment to United Students for Veter
ans' Health, which does social work
and recreational activities with
Alzheimer's patients.
Senior Rahul Khurana, USVH
national director, said the group's
aggressive publicizing efforts,
which consisted of e-mail to resi
dent assistants, announcements at
house meetings and flyering of
dorms may have been a significant
factor in the increased number of
volunteers.

done in USVH also seems to attract
more students and contribute to a

high return rate, Khurana said.
USVH offers the student a chance
to interact directly with patients
and develop meaningful relation
ships with them.
Although there are a lot more
groups coming up in the health-re
lated area of community service,
USVH has been around long
enough to "build a niche for itself,"
Khurana said.
The Haas Center for Public Ser
vice houses more than 35 organiza
tions focusing on countless differ
ent issues, and new ones are crop
ping up with greater frequency.
Khurana explained that the focus
es of many of the recent groups are
becoming increasingly repetitive,

such as the abundance of groups
targeting East Palo Alto students.
He also speculated that the in
crease in new organizations may
be due to resume-building aspira
tions, for some groups come and
go seemingly overnight.
Messinger believes that service
might be more effective at Stanford
if the community focused its initia
tives and support on certain large is
sues.
"What the Haas Center and the
ASSU and the University should be
asking is whether sponsoring more
focused, wider-scale, long-term ser
vice activities, where current
groups merge into a larger group,
would be more effective,"
Messinger said.
That way, "groups would work
with instead of competing with each
other," he added.
