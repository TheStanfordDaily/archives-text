# Beat poet Snyder reads 'long poem'
## 
### Kumar Narayanan Contributing writer 
The poem "Mountains and
Rivers Without End" by prominent
beat poet Gary Snyder, almost lives
up to the last words of its name.
Snyder read his poem for almost
2 1/2 hours last night at Kresge Au
ditorium in front of a nearly full
house. The audience was peppered
with members of the Stanford com
munity as well as people from all
over the Bay Area. Counterpoint
Press recently published the poem
as a book.
Snyder, who grew up in Wash
ington and Oregon, has won count
less awards, including the Guggen
heim Fellowship, the Pulitzer Prize
for his 1985 poem, "Turtle Island,"
and the Bollingen Prize for poetry
in 1997.
He was also close friends of more
prominent members of the Beat
generation, including Allen Gins
berg and Jack Kerouac. Snyder was
the model for the character Jaffy
Ryder in Kerouac's book, "The
Dharma Bums."
The poem, like much of Snyder's
life, was richly influenced by the
spirituality of Asia. His rendering of
the poem was punctuated by lapses
into Chinese, Hindu and Japanese
chants and was chock-full of refer
ences to Buddhist and Hindu
mythology.
The poem was inspired by "hori
zontal East Asian handscrolls and
Japanese Noh drama," according to
Snyder.
The reading was more a se
quence of poems "that races toward
an imagining, a visualizing of the
whole planet as one watershed, one

great place," he wrote in his pro
gram notes. That concept was re
flected in Snyder's opening stanza:
"Endless streams and
mountains / climbing and sliding
into the created spaces... seeing the
land from a boat on a lake /or a
broad rise / coasting by."
The poem progressed as a se
quence of many smaller poems,
ranging from a letter found in an old
logger's cabin to a Zen meal verse,
from a surreal Alaskan landscape to
a hitchhiker's journey down old
Highway 99 (now Interstate 5).
Snyder, a graduate of Reed Col
lege in Oregon, read large portions
of each of the poem segments with
verve and animation. He reassured
the audience, however, "It's OK to
go out and maybe come back later.
It's OK to fall asleep."
Most of the audience either fol
lowed along in the recently pub
lished book or reclined with eyes
half closed, imagining.
The event, which was free and
open to the public, was coordinated
by Mark Gonnerman, a doctoral
student in the Department of Reli
gious Studies. The backdrop for the
reading was a bristlecone pine,
painted by artist Kazuaki Tana
hashi.
The reading was part of a year
long series of Stanford Humanties
Center Research workshops. Last
night's reading was framed by many
satellite activities, including a lec
ture yesterday on the poem and a re
enacment of the poem segment, "A
Circumambulation of Mt. Tamal
pais," which will take place as a hike
tomorrow.
Last night's reading will be
broadcast on Channel 51 Nov. 17.
