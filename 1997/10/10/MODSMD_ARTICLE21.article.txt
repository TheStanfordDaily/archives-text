## Spikers hunting big '3-0' 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Tonight's the big '3-0' for
the fourth-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team.
No, it's not anyone's birth
day, and it has nothing to do
with predicted kill totals for
outside hitters Kerri Walsh or
Kristin Folkl. It's what the
Cardinal's Pac-10 home
match winning streak — a run
that dates back to 1993 —
would extend to with a win
over No. 15 Arizona tonight at
7 p.m.

■ TOMORROW: Stanford vs.

That match will be fol

p.m. With all the shifting in
the Pac-10 standings last
weekend (thanks mostly to
the performances of the Ari
zona schools), Stanford (14-2,
5-0 Pacific 10 Conference) is
looking to remain unbeaten
and by itself on top of the con
ference.

coach Don Shaw's team. Last

season in a five-game thriller. Two
days later, the Wildcats lost in four to
No. 24 Washington.
"Arizona's got as much talent as
any team in the conference," Shaw
said. "They're probably the deepest
team in the conference; they're play
ing well. Beating Washington State
was a good win for them."
Offensive performance is the
thing Shaw hopes his squad will im
prove upon this weekend. Stanford's
wins over the Los Angeles schools
last weekend were largely a product
of the team's incredible defensive ef
fort rather than any offensive num
bers the Card put up.
"We had kind of a weak weekend
offensively," Shaw said. "I think we

were a little tired. A few players have
played every match. Barbara Ifejika
and Kristin Folkl — those two have
carried the load for us."
And they've carried it quite well,
Ifejika, a senior middle blocker, has
posted an amazing .507 hitting per
centage in Fac-10 play and is second
on the team in kills (129) behind fel
low senior Folkl (246).
"I think part of the decline people
saw was just the quality of play we
faced was the highest we've had all
season," Folkl said of the Card's of
fensive production last weekend.
But Stanford managed to go
down to L.A. and take care of both
USC and UCLA in straight-game
victories, which leaves you wonder
ing just how much of a chance either
Arizona or Arizona State has.
"I think Arizona is very strong,"
Folkl said. "They seem to be a solid

blocking team, and offensively their
statistics have been pretty impres
sive."
The unranked Sun Devils (10-6,
1-4) could easily be considered the
weaker of the two teams the Card
will face, but that would be over
looking their impressive showing
against the Washington schools last
weekend.
The Sun Devils defeated Wash
ington in a five-game match and
then had Washington State on the
brink of losing two straight. Arizona
State led 14-9 in game three of a 1-1
match before dropping that game
16-14, then losing the match in four.
"Arizona State didn't seem that
strong, but they beat Washington
and had Washington State on the
ropes," Shaw said. "What I thought
was a one-match weekend [is now
two tough matches]."
