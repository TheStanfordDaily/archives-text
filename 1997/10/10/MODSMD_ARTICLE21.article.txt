## Spikers hunting big '3-0'

the fourth-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team.
No, it's not anyone's birth
day, and it has nothing to do

match winning streak — a run
that dates back to 1993 —

■ TOMORROW: Stanford vs.
Arizona State (10-6,1-4) at Maples

5-0 Pacific 10 Conference) is
looking to remain unbeaten
and by itself on top of the con
ference.
The Wildcats (11-2, 3-2)
are first up for the Card and
will most likely pose the
biggest challenge for head
coach Don Shaw's team. Last
weekend Arizona gave
eighth-ranked Washington
State its first blemish of the
