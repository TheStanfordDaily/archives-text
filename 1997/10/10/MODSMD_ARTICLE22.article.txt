# Arizona looks to stifle Cardinal's momentum

### Dave Flemming Contributing writer 
With its victory over Notre Dame
on Saturday, 16th-ranked Stanford
ended its non-conference schedule.
Now the real race begins.
Stanford (4-1,2-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) will plunge into the heart of
its Pac-10 season tomorrow when it
faces Arizona in Tucson in the first
of six straight conference games to
end the regular season.
The Cardinal is trying to go 3-0 in
the Pac-10 for the first time since
1971, its last Rose Bowl season.
Stanford enters the game on a
roll, having won nine of 10 games
dating back to last season, and six in
a row in conference. Its 4-1 start this
year is the third-best mark to open a
season in school history.
The performance against the
Fighting Irish was particularly domi
nating, as the Cardinal offense man
handled Notre Dame's defense en
route to 514 yards. Meanwhile, the
defense only allowed 298 yards in
the 33-15 pasting.
"That was probably our most
complete game yet," said Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham.
The Stanford offense is having a
banner season thus far. During the

last three weeks, the Cardinal has
averaged 39 points and 470 total
yards.
At the center of this success has
been a devastating rushing attack.
The team has averaged 235 rushing
yards per game during the three
week stretch, with seniors Anthony
Bookman and Mike Mitchell each
totaling more than 100 yards on the
ground in those games.
Stanford will try to maintain its
momentum against a Wildcat team

that is unfamiliar to Willingham and
his squad. The two teams haven't
met since 1994, and Stanford hasn't
beaten Arizona since 1990.
Arizona has endured a slow start
to what was supposed to be a suc
cessful season. Two conference loss
es — to Oregon and UCLA — have

been especially damaging.
"This season has been frustrat
ing," said Arizona head coach Dick
Tomey. "We have not played as well
early as we thought we might."
llie team Stanford faced three
seasons ago featured the heralded
"Desert Swarm" defense, one of the
most feared units in the nation. It
used to plague the Cardinal, as Stan
ford totaled minus-19 yards rushing
in the teams' last three meetings.
But recently the Wildcats' de
fense has not been as successful. Last
year it ranked seventh in the Pac-1(),
and lately it has struggled to keep
opponents out of the end zone.
"The last two weeks we have just
stunk it up defensively," lomey
said.
Much of the Wildcats' defensive
problems have come early in games.
Arizona has constantly fallen be
hind, having been outscored 55-21 in
first quarters this year. Conversely,
the Wildcats have dominated the
fourth quarter, outscoring oppo
nents 49-0.
The Arizona defense has some
impressive statistics despite its re
cent troubles. It is second in total de
fense in the Pac-10 and second in run
