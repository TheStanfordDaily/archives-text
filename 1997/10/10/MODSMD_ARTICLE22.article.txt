# Arizona looks to stifle Cardinal's momentum
## 
### Dave Flemming Contributing writer 
With its victory over Notre Dame
on Saturday, 16th-ranked Stanford
ended its non-conference schedule.
Now the real race begins.
Stanford (4-1,2-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) will plunge into the heart of
its Pac-10 season tomorrow when it
faces Arizona in Tucson in the first
of six straight conference games to
end the regular season.
The Cardinal is trying to go 3-0 in
the Pac-10 for the first time since
1971, its last Rose Bowl season.
Stanford enters the game on a
roll, having won nine of 10 games
dating back to last season, and six in
a row in conference. Its 4-1 start this
year is the third-best mark to open a
season in school history.
The performance against the
Fighting Irish was particularly domi
nating, as the Cardinal offense man
handled Notre Dame's defense en
route to 514 yards. Meanwhile, the
defense only allowed 298 yards in
the 33-15 pasting.
"That was probably our most
complete game yet," said Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham.
The Stanford offense is having a
banner season thus far. During the

last three weeks, the Cardinal has
averaged 39 points and 470 total
yards.
At the center of this success has
been a devastating rushing attack.
The team has averaged 235 rushing
yards per game during the three
week stretch, with seniors Anthony
Bookman and Mike Mitchell each
totaling more than 100 yards on the
ground in those games.
Stanford will try to maintain its
momentum against a Wildcat team

that is unfamiliar to Willingham and
his squad. The two teams haven't
met since 1994, and Stanford hasn't
beaten Arizona since 1990.
Arizona has endured a slow start
to what was supposed to be a suc
cessful season. Two conference loss
es — to Oregon and UCLA — have

been especially damaging.
"This season has been frustrat
ing," said Arizona head coach Dick
Tomey. "We have not played as well
early as we thought we might."
llie team Stanford faced three
seasons ago featured the heralded
"Desert Swarm" defense, one of the
most feared units in the nation. It
used to plague the Cardinal, as Stan
ford totaled minus-19 yards rushing
in the teams' last three meetings.
But recently the Wildcats' de
fense has not been as successful. Last
year it ranked seventh in the Pac-1(),
and lately it has struggled to keep
opponents out of the end zone.
"The last two weeks we have just
stunk it up defensively," lomey
said.
Much of the Wildcats' defensive
problems have come early in games.
Arizona has constantly fallen be
hind, having been outscored 55-21 in
first quarters this year. Conversely,
the Wildcats have dominated the
fourth quarter, outscoring oppo
nents 49-0.
The Arizona defense has some
impressive statistics despite its re
cent troubles. It is second in total de
fense in the Pac-10 and second in run

defense, allowing a meager 87 yards
per game on the ground — 15th-best
in the nation. It also leads the league
in quarterback sacks.
Willingham agreed that the inte
rior line battle will be a fierce one.
"We have to find a way to create
matchups in the running game (that
allow for success)," he said.
Finding successful matchups
against Arizona's defense, which in
cludes several star performers, will
be a challenge.
Defensive tackle Joe Salave'a is
one of the conference's elite players
and leads the Pac-10 with seven
sacks. Inside linebacker Chester
Burnett was the Pac-10's leading
tackier last season and is second in
that category this year.
'["he defensive secondary is out
standing as well, featuring preseason
Ail-American Chris McAllister,
who led the Pac-10 in interceptions
with six last year.
While Stanford's offense will
have a tough task against the Ari

zona defense, the Cardinal's own de
fensive squad must contend with an
extremely balanced Wildcat attack.
Through five games, Arizona has
I,(XX) yards rushing and 1,(X)3 yards
passing. The Wildcats are the only
team in the Pac-10 to average more
rushing yards per game than Stan
ford. The rushing attack has been
sparked by a first-time performer
making waves as one of the confer
ence's best young players.
Sophomore back Trung Canidate
leads the Pac-10 with 124 yards per
game on the ground, and has touch
down runs of 66, 67 and a school
record % yards this year.
"He's exceptionally fast and a
tough, hard-nosed guy," Tomey
said. "He's got the same kind of
tenacity that Bookman and Mitchell
have."
Canidate sprained his ankle last
week in the Wildcats' 31-28 win over
San Diego State and is questionable
for tomorrow's game.
The quarterback position for Ari
zona has also been affected by in
juries. Starter Keith Smith, a fresh
man Ail-American last year, proba
bly will not play due to a lingering

shoulder injury. His backup, Brady
Bratten, is out four more weeks with
a broken collarbone.
Because of those injuries, red
shirt freshman Ortege Jenkins start
ed for the first time last week and
had an outstanding debut, throwing
for 285 yards and three touchdowns.
Tomey announced that Jenkins will
start against Stanford.
The Cardinal defense has been
sparked by the outstanding play of
senior defensive lineman Kailee
Wong and Carl Hansen. Wong is
second in the Pac-10 in both sacks
and tackles-for-losses, with 5 1/2
and 11, respectively. He also has two
safeties and a blocked field goal.
Hansen has been nearly as effec
tive with four sacks of his own, con
stantly collapsing the interior of op
ponents' offensive lines.
The Cardinal defense might re
ceive a boost Saturday if All-Confer
ence linebacker Chris Draft is able
to play. Draft has missed the last
three games with a hamstring injury.
But if Stanford wants to make a
run for the Rose Bowl, it must win
this weekend — no easy task down in
the desert.

that category this year.

While Stanford's offense will
have a tough task against the Ari

extremely balanced Wildcat attack.
Through five games, Arizona has

passing. The Wildcats are the only
team in the Pac-10 to average more
rushing yards per game than Stan
ford. The rushing attack has been
sparked by a first-time performer
making waves as one of the confer
ence's best young players.
Sophomore back Trung Canidate
leads the Pac-10 with 124 yards per
game on the ground, and has touch
down runs of 66, 67 and a school

"He's exceptionally fast and a
tough, hard-nosed guy," Tomey
said. "He's got the same kind of
tenacity that Bookman and Mitchell
have."
Canidate sprained his ankle last
week in the Wildcats' 31-28 win over
San Diego State and is questionable
for tomorrow's game.
The quarterback position for Ari
zona has also been affected by in
juries. Starter Keith Smith, a fresh
man Ail-American last year, proba
bly will not play due to a lingering

shoulder injury. His backup, Brady
Bratten, is out four more weeks with
a broken collarbone.
Because of those injuries, red
shirt freshman Ortege Jenkins start

had an outstanding debut, throwing
for 285 yards and three touchdowns.
Tomey announced that Jenkins will
start against Stanford.
The Cardinal defense has been
sparked by the outstanding play of
senior defensive lineman Kailee
Wong and Carl Hansen. Wong is
second in the Pac-10 in both sacks
and tackles-for-losses, with 5 1/2
and 11, respectively. He also has two
safeties and a blocked field goal.
Hansen has been nearly as effec
tive with four sacks of his own, con
stantly collapsing the interior of op
ponents' offensive lines.
The Cardinal defense might re
ceive a boost Saturday if All-Confer
ence linebacker Chris Draft is able
to play. Draft has missed the last
three games with a hamstring injury.
But if Stanford wants to make a
run for the Rose Bowl, it must win
this weekend — no easy task down in
the desert.
With its victory over Notre Dame
on Saturday, 16th-ranked Stanford
ended its non-conference schedule.
Now the real race begins.
Stanford (4-1,2-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) will plunge into the heart of
its Pac-10 season tomorrow when it
faces Arizona in Tucson in the first
of six straight conference games to
end the regular season.
The Cardinal is trying to go 3-0 in
the Pac-10 for the first time since
1971, its last Rose Bowl season.
Stanford enters the game on a
roll, having won nine of 10 games
dating back to last season, and six in
a row in conference. Its 4-1 start this
year is the third-best mark to open a
season in school history.
The performance against the
Fighting Irish was particularly domi
nating, as the Cardinal offense man
handled Notre Dame's defense en
route to 514 yards. Meanwhile, the
defense only allowed 298 yards in
the 33-15 pasting.
"That was probably our most
complete game yet," said Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham.
The Stanford offense is having a
banner season thus far. During the

last three weeks, the Cardinal has
averaged 39 points and 470 total
yards.
At the center of this success has
been a devastating rushing attack.
The team has averaged 235 rushing
yards per game during the three
week stretch, with seniors Anthony
Bookman and Mike Mitchell each
totaling more than 100 yards on the
ground in those games.
Stanford will try to maintain its
momentum against a Wildcat team

that is unfamiliar to Willingham and
his squad. The two teams haven't
met since 1994, and Stanford hasn't
beaten Arizona since 1990.
Arizona has endured a slow start
to what was supposed to be a suc
cessful season. Two conference loss
es — to Oregon and UCLA — have

been especially damaging.
"This season has been frustrat
ing," said Arizona head coach Dick
Tomey. "We have not played as well
early as we thought we might."
llie team Stanford faced three
seasons ago featured the heralded
"Desert Swarm" defense, one of the
most feared units in the nation. It
used to plague the Cardinal, as Stan
ford totaled minus-19 yards rushing
in the teams' last three meetings.
But recently the Wildcats' de
fense has not been as successful. Last
year it ranked seventh in the Pac-1(),
and lately it has struggled to keep
opponents out of the end zone.
"The last two weeks we have just
stunk it up defensively," lomey
said.
Much of the Wildcats' defensive
problems have come early in games.
Arizona has constantly fallen be
hind, having been outscored 55-21 in
first quarters this year. Conversely,
the Wildcats have dominated the
fourth quarter, outscoring oppo
nents 49-0.
The Arizona defense has some
impressive statistics despite its re
cent troubles. It is second in total de

Willingham agreed that the inte

matchups in the running game (that
