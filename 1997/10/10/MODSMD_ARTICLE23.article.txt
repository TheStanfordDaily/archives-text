# Quiet leader
## Senior All-American Nathan Nutter paces cross country 
### Nathan Watanabe 
Gasping for air in the sweltering
heat, he runs on.
The dust chokes him, yet he runs
on.
He knows the stakes; he knows
his role; he runs on, only thinking of
the finish line ahead.
As senior Nate Nutter raced to
wards the finish line at last year's
NCAA championship cross-country
meet, he prayed to God to give him
strength for that one last push. To
say Nutter finished 15th in the race is

only one part of the story, as he
helped lead his team to Stanford's
first NCAA championship in the
sport and garnered All-American
honors in the process.
"I was pretty happy about it,"

Nutter said. "It didn't really play on
my mind at the time — 1 mean we
had a chance to win it all, and that
was our primary focus."
An outstanding high school run
ner in Arizona, Nutter has taken ex

ponential steps in improving his per
formance at the college level.
"I had this joke with (junior team
mates Brent and Brad HauserJ,"
laughs Nutter. "Freshman year I fin
ished 120, then 40, then 15 last year,
then because each year my score was
divided by 3, I'm hoping to finish
fifth this year!"
"Nathan's come a long way since
his freshman year," said cross coun
try coach Vin Lananna. "He's ob
served a long line of leaders on our
team, and in return he offers a nice

balance."
Accepting the responsibilities
of his seniority, Nutter has taken
on an increasingly greater leader
ship role on the team.
"My main goal this year was to
be more of a leader, because I 'm a
senior and there are a lot of young
guys coming up, so 1 want to be an
example," Nutter said. "I like to
lead more by example than by
word since people remember ac
tion a lot more than they remem
ber word."
Even with his myriad athletic
achievements, Nutter regards his
studies with the utmost earnest
ness, which has helped him earn
Academic All-Conference hon
ors and an Award for Excellence
from Stanford in 1996.
Majoring in mechanical engi
neering, he braves the long hours
of studying and suggests to
prospective "techies" to "find
help when you need it and turn
everything in ... almost on time."
He also has time for several
other extracurricular activities —
to which Lananna can readily at
test: "He also spends time with his
many girlfriends," his coach said.
After college Nutter hopes to
work in the aerospace industry.
Yet the yearn to run continuously
beckons him towards the 2(XX)
Olympics in Sydney.
"I've been thinking about the
2(XX) Olympics, and I think I have
a chance of qualifying for the U.S.
trials; I don't know about the
Olympics because only three peo
ple are selected to go," Nutter
said.
To some, his inconspicuous
grin and easy-going, friendly na
ture often belie the fierce com
petitor within. But the desire and
the drive were never hidden in the
first place.
"I've always had a lot of re
spect for Nathan," Lananna said.
"He's ethical and possesses good
sportsmanship. He's a good, solid
person."
Gasping for air in the sweltering
heat, he runs on.
The dust chokes him, yet he runs
