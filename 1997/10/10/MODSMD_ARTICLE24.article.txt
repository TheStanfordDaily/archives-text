The lOth-ranked Stanford men's
soccer team faces its toughest test yet
when it meets No. 8 Washington
today in Seattle.
It's only the second time this sea
son that the Cardinal (9-0-1, 1-0

resulted in a 2-0 victory for Stanford.

MEN'S SOCCER

■ TODAY: No. 10 Stanford (9-0-1,
1-0) at No. 8 Washington (8-1 -2,1-0)
■ SUNDAY: Stanford at Oregon
State (2-7-1,0-0)

Today's game, along with a match
Sunday against Oregon State (2-7-1),
will be a battle for dominance in the
conference. Stanford currently is the
third highest-ranked team in the

MPSF, behind the Huskies (8-1-2, 1-
0) and No. 2 UCLA. The Cardinal
isn't scheduled to play the Bruins in
the regular season.
The matches against Washington
and Oregon State represent "possibly
the biggest weekend of the season so
far," said head coach Bobby Clark.
"This is a real test."
The hardest thing about playing
the Huskies may be that the meeting
is on their home turf, Clark said.
Along with fans, Washington will

bring to the match last year's MPSF
Mountain Division Player of the
Year, senior Jason Boyce. Boyce's 12
goals rank eighth nationally.
Stanford has been spreading its
goals more evenly among team mem
bers, with nine different players hav
ing scored at least once. The Cardinal
defense — including redshirt fresh
man goalkeeper Adam Zapala,
whose .19 goals-against average is
No. 1 in the country — has joined in
to give the team what may be its high

est national ranking in school history.
"A good weekend over both these
games would really establish us in
everyone else's eyes around the
country as a genuine top-10 team,"
Clark said
(This game will) "let us know ex
actly where we ,»re and if we've still
got any work still to do," he said.

12-6 in meetings over the years, com
