■ TOMORROW: No. 4 Stanford
(6-3,1-1) at No. H Long Beach State
(5-6,1-1)
■ SUNDAY: Stanford at No. 6
UCLA (6-3,2-1)

The fourth-ranked Cardinal (6-3
overall, 1-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation), which travels to No. K
I x>ng Beach State tomorrow and
No. 6 UC I .A on Sunday, is focusing
on driving in response to its recent
scoring slump.
"I think it's going to cause more
shots," said head coach Dante Det
tamanti. "We just have to he careful
on the [opponent's) counterattack."
Sophomore fielder Andy Wal
hurger said driving is better suited to
the Cardinal's speed and compara
tively smaller size.
"It's great for our style of play,"
Walburger said. "It keeps the de
fense guessing. It definitely keeps us
moving."
Stanford has historically fared
well against Long Beach State (5-6,
1-1). I.asl season, the ( 'ardinal twice
defeated the 49crs in what could be
termed blowouts: 20-6 and 14-K.
This yeai, Long Beach State has
suffered a string of losses
"Usually we expect not a whole
lot (from the 4 ( >crs|," Chant said,
though adding that a Stanford victo
ry is by no means automatic.
Although UCLA (6-3, 2-1) was
last year's NCAA champion, the
Bruins are battling inexperience
after losing several seniors to gradu
ation. They have already dropped
three matches this season.
()neot those losses was a 10-6 de
feat to Stanford at the Southern C al
ifornia Tournament Sept. 21. But
Sunday's match will prove no easy
victory.
"They're going to definitely be
up for this match," Walburger said.
"They don't have as much talent.
(But) they have a lot more heart."
According to Dcttamanti, victo
ries lor the Cardinal at this stage in
the season are imperative.
"We need to keep winning these
games to maintain our record," he
said. "We can't afford to lose to two
teams ranked below us."
