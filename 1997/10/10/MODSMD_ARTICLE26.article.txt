# Backup QB leads Wildcats

### Joel Flom Special to the Stanford Daily 
TUCSON, Ariz. — Smith or
Jenkins?
Jenkins or Smith?
A quarterback controversy brew
ing in Tucson? Not anymore, in the
eyes of Arizona head coach Dick
Tomey.
"I don't think so," Tomey said.
"Personally, we have 1 and 3/4
quarterbacks. We have one that is
healthy and one that is 3 / 4 healthy."
With sophomore Keith Smith still
not in perfect health, it appears that
redshirt freshman Ortege Jenkins
will again be the man when the Wild
cats meet Stanford tomorrow.
"O.J. will start the game," Tomey
said. "1 hope Keith by the end of the
week is able to come in and play."
OK, here come the "what ifs."
What if Smith is healthy for to

morrow's game — would he play?
"Maybe," Tomey said. "O.J. did a
great job. 1 just think you have to re
ward performances."
Jenkins deserves more than a re
ward. He deserves a medal for the
job he did in leading the Wildcats to
a come-from-behind victory over
San Diego State. Although it was not
the toughest defense the Wildcats
have faced, Jenkins still posted sea
son highs in yards passing and touch
down passes en route to the Wild
cats' highest offensive yardage total
of the season.
"A lot of confidence was built,"
said sophomore wide receiver Den
nis Northcutt, who is also Jenkins'
roommate. "I can see it at practice,
how he talks on the field and at
home. He feels like he can't do
wrong, and that is so good for him."
What if both Smith and Jenkins
were on the field at the same time?

"I don't know," Tomey said.
"That would be fun to fool with."
What if Tomey was to live by the
rule that you never lose your starting
spot because of an injury?
"You probably say in most cases,
that is the case," Tomey said. "But, I
think it all has to do with how the po
sition was being played prior to the
injury as well."
It is no secret that the Wildcats
have had problems in the opening
quarter of ballgames, so Tomey is
open to anything to get his team off
on the right foot.
"(I am ready to) do whatever we
need to do," Tomey said. "If we have
to scrimmage before the game, I
have done that. At Hawaii we had an
inside drill before the game."
"I am not opposed to anything."
