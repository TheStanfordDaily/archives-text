CROSS COUNTRY

■ TOMORROW: The Pre-
NCAA Furrnan Invitational in
Greenville, S.C.

on the same course in South
Carolina where the champi
onships will be held in late No
vember.
" The purpose of the meet is
to preview the course on which
the NCAA Championships
will be held, and to compete
against teams outside of our
district," said head coach Vin
Lananna.
The Cardinal men will face
tough teams in Colorado, Wis
consin and Michigan State.
UCLA will also be present,
along with its standout runner
Mebrahtom Keflezghi, who won
the individual title at the Stan
ford Invitational on Sept. 27.
The women will square off
against Villanova, a team with
revenge on its mind. Stanford
edged Villanova to take the
women's team title at last year's
NCAA Championships.
Facing teams outside of the
district may be advantageous for
Stanford.

"If we can beat some highly
ranked teams outside of our district,
we will increase our chances of se
curing an at-large bid for the
NCAAs," Lananna said.
Competing for the Cardinal in
the seeded women's division will be
seniors Sarna Renfro and Kortney
Dunscombe, junior Mary Cobb,
sophomore Sally Glen and fresh
man Julia Stamps.
The men will enter senior Nathan
Nutter and juniors Brad and Brent
Hauser and Jason Balkman.
This meet is still early on the cross
country time table. It provides a nec
essary break in the runners' constant

training, as well as giving runners a
valuable chance to race and see
where they're at in their running.
"In October we will be juggling
our lineups to provide the athletes
with as many chances as possible,"
Lananna said. "In order for us to ef
fectively utilize our depth during the
championship season, our athletes
will need to race at a high level.
"The meets at South Carolina
and at Arizona State (next week)
will serve that purpose."
A strong showing by the Cardinal
this weekend may foreshadow the
events of the cross country finale in
November.
