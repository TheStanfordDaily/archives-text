■ TOMORROW: Stanford (6-4, 2-
0) vs. Pacific (4-8, 0-3) at the Field
Hockey Field, 1 p.m.

"We only have five home games
this season, so playing here is always
fun," said head coach Sheryl John
son.
The Cardinal (6-4, 2-0 NorPac
Conference) blew out UOP 6-0
Sept. 27, so some may say they have
every reason to feel confident. Stan
ford completely dominated that
game, as senior goalkeeper Kelly
Naylor saw little to no action in the
cage.
But "we can't get too comfort
able playing offense," Naylor said,
"because they may just get fast
breaks and catch our defense off
guard."
And UOP is counting on doing
just that: getting the Cardinal out of
its game. The Tigers have several
players from the Bay Area, so they
are always excited to play at Stan
ford. The good crowd of player par
ents serves as a definite motivator.
"Stanford is a very well-rounded
team with great speed," said Pacific
head coach Carla Konet. "We hope

to be competitive on Saturday and
play better than we did at home."
Coach Konet has studied the Car
dinal. She recognizes Stanford's
total team strengths and wants her
team to pay close attention to specif
ic Stanford players.
"Justina Williams distributes the
ball very well and the center for
ward, Monique Leroux, is also really
effective," she said.
UOP especially wants to cut
down Stanford's penalty corners be
cause in previous games, they've
been a sure means of scoring for the
Cardinal.
Stanford is hoping tomorrow's
match — its first home game with
school in session — won t be much
of a challenge. As always, the Cardi
nal will start with its set lineup. Plus,
Stanford will most likely have its
mind focused on its upcoming road
trip to Boston College.
"We'll try to get as many people
in as possible, so we're rested and ex
perienced for Boston," Johnson
said. "If Pacific gets a passing game
going, they could be a threat, but if
we dominate the midfield and keep
control of the ball, we should be
OK."
"We're working on little passing,
stick skills and quick thinking in
practice this week because in
Boston, we'll play on turf," said ju
nior forward Sarah Medeiros. "Con
centrating on the Pacific game will
be difficult for everybody. Since I've
been here they haven't given us too
much trouble. The toughest games
are just ahead."
