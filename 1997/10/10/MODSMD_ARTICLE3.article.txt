# Symposia set on limits of artifical intelligence

It was unsettling enough watch
ing an IBM supercomputer outplay
chess champ Garry Kasparov, but
now there's software that just might
outjoke Steve Martin.
Jape, a software program that
concocts original puns in several lan
guages, will headline with the come
dian / actor in a fall discussion series
at Stanford on the frontiers of com
puter intelligence.
Organized by computer scientist
and Pulitzer Prize-winning author
Douglas Hofstadter, the series will
probe four areas in which Hofs
tadter believes computers have pro
duced uncannily "human-like" re
sults.
"We're going to poke and prod
the question of just how close com
puter intelligence has come to
human creativity," said Hofstadter,
a visiting scholar at the Stanford
based Center for Computer-Assist
ed Research in the Humanities.
Computer, or artificial, intelli
gence includes both the study of
human thought using computers
and the science of teaching comput
ers to solve problems.
Tomorrow's session will com
pare the success of the IBM "Deep
Blue" chess computer with what
some claim is a bigger hurdle for
programmers: software that plays
the complex Asian board game go.

Eliot Heart, a former captain of the
U.S. Chess Olympic Team, will
speak at the event.
Other symposia focus on com
puter programs that mimic human
understanding of literature and
music composition.
Hofstadter believes that these
creative areas will be the longer
term test of computing limits.
"Chess isn't a domain that repre
sents human intelligence, like
humor or music do. Chess is its own
little world," he said.
Stanford is renowned for artifi
cial intelligence researchers and in
novations. Public anxiety about the
topic might be decreasing, but many
individuals are still wary about being
outsmarted by a hunk of silicon.
"The term itself is a bit frighten
ing," said Bob Engelmore, a senior
research scientist in Stanford's
Computer Science Department.
"There's this lingering notion of
computers replacing humans, but
that's naive."
Engelmore heads up Stanford's
Knowledge Systems Laboratory,
which is conducting its own series of
lunchtime seminars on recent artifi
cial intelligence work at Stanford.
The laboratory's research has re
sulted in intelligent agents that help
hospitals monitor intensive care pa
tients and a software resource on
