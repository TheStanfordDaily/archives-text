THE SECRET DIARIES
OF AIM EE
THANATOGENOS!

To men and women across the Heartland,
Aimee Thanatogenos' name has become
synonymous with elegant furniture,
puffy matresses and public intoxication. She
is not only a woman of great beauty and
celebrity, but also a handy household appli
ance that can stop that leaking faucet in a
jiffy. Hut much as we know about Aimee, the
public figure, we're still in the dark when it
comes to Aimee, the relaxed Aimee, the Aimee
who sits at home and listens to her neigh
bour's conversations through a tapped phone
line. So what is Aimee really really like? In
her own words, Aimee Thanatogenos.

Ix)ve
Aimee found love once, but it slipped off her
hands in the shower and fell into the drain.
Aimee has yet to recover from that loss.
Perfect people
Aimee usually crosses to the other side of the
street when she sees them approaching.
Sometimes Aimee hides in nearby bushes, or
behind a totem pole. Often they walk real
slow, which means that Aimee has to stay
there for a long time.

Money
Aimee does not believe in money, which
makes her trips to Tresidder Express quite a
trial, and it takes her twice as long to get a
bottle of milk. People have tried to shake
Aimee off this belief by waving $20 bills in
front of her, but Aimee usually will just close
her eyes and hum a few bars from Cumbaya.
Beauty
Aimee enjoys being near beautiful people,
which may explain to several people in her
CIV class why she sits next to them everyday
even though she never says hi or introduces
herself. Aimee, however, does not think that
by being near beautiful people she will
become beautiful herself. That, would be fool
ish.
Violence
Aimee thinks that violence is bad. Unless, of
course, it's done to someone she really really
dislikes. In that case, she might look the other
way and pretend she's waiting for a bus.
Work
Aimee avoids work at all costs. But sometimes
work catches up with her and a violent
squirmish ensues. Aimee usually loses.

Hair
Aimee is very touchy about her hair. One day
she was at a party and she thought her hair
was messed up, so she kept fussing with her
hair t.he whole night. Her date was very
turned off and never spoke to her again.
There is a lesson to be learned in this.
Academics
Aimee is a very smart student. In fact, she
masturbates with her transcript.
Time
Aimee has no opinion on time.
Celebrity
Aimee once ran into Patty Hearst. Then she
made a dumb joke about terrorism, and Patty
got really upset. Aimee has yet to recover
from that faux pas.
Death
Aimee hopes it doesn't happen anytime soon,
and if it does, she wants a 10-day notice so she
can indulge in ice cream and have sex with
lot s of random people.

with Aimee Thanatogenos

When Aimee was a man (top left), Aimee liked to play football,
make fun of sissies, eat soup without a spoon and droll when scantily
lad Playboy bunnies used to walk by. But when Aimee was a
woman(top right), she liked to look at herself in the mirror a lot, paint
her nails, and break into a rendition of "On a Clear Day You Can See
Forever" for no good reason. Confused, Aimee went to see a therapist,
but the therapist said she was crazy and then shot himself. Aimee did
not like that, and so she asked for her money back. Nowadays she just
spends a lot of time listening to the Latino radio station and making
prank calls to people on the phone book whose last names rhyme with
Goldstein. That makes Aimee feel good. Real good.
