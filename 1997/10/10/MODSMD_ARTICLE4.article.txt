fund about 40 more graduate fel
lowships than it expected to under

The fellowships give the doctni
al students $12,000 each year in tu

Stanford attract more of the best
students in their respective fields.

son there are more fellows than tar

ceived grants and scholarships
from the National Science Founda
tion, which reduced their need for
money from Stanford The Univer
sity then made up the difference
between the grant and the fellow
ship. The surplus money funded
additional fellowships.
