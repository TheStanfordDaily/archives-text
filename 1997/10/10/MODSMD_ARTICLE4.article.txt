# Fellowships fund 141 grad students
## 
### Arthur Hu Staff writer 
The University has been able to
fund about 40 more graduate fel
lowships than it expected to under
a new program launched this year.
Only 100 science and engineer
ing doctoral students were expect
ed to be funded as part of the new
Stanford Graduate Fellowships,
but changes in funding sources al
lowed the University to name Ml
fellows.
The fellowships give the doctni
al students $12,000 each year in tu
ition aid, as well as a $ I6,(MH) annu
al stipend for three years.
Thomas Wasow, associate dean
for graduate policy, said there were
two main purposes to the new fel
lowships: to "reprivati/.e" the Uni
versity and lessen the dependence
on federal funding and to help

Stanford attract more of the best
students in their respective fields.
According to Wasow, the rea
son there are more fellows than tar
getcd is because some students re
ceived grants and scholarships
from the National Science Founda
tion, which reduced their need for
money from Stanford The Univer
sity then made up the difference
between the grant and the fellow
ship. The surplus money funded
additional fellowships.
I.ach science and engineering
department receives an allocation
of fellowships that it may award. A
central steering committee chooses
to whom the fellowships are award
ed
Initially, the departmental ad
missions committee selects the top
10 applicants and forwards those
candidates to the steering commit
tee. Nearly all the fellowships that
the steering committee received
were approved.
This process "is such that the
fellows are going to be the very
best," Wasow said.
The number of fellowships each
department awards depends on the
number of doctorates produced
and the amount of federal support
the department receives, said
Wasow, who also sits on the steer

ing committee.
First-year doctoral student
Marc Scanio, a fellowship recipi
ent, said he was not aware of any
extra benefits that being a fellow
entailed, but "it reduced the teach
ing requirement in chemistry from
three quarters to one quarter."
However, Wasow said one of
the major advantages of being a fel
low means a student is not tied to a
single faculty member's research
funding, which traditionally nar
rows the choice of what a graduate
student can work on.
"The federal government has
changed the rules we have to play

by," Wasow said. "The same dol
lars don't fund as many graduate
students as they used to."
Although federal funding has
actually been rising recently, it re
mains unpredictable due to politics
and the rising costs of research.
Tom Treynor, another first-year
doctoral student and fellow, was
honored to be named because "it
means that my undergraduate
achievements were recognized as
indicators of future promise."
In terms of finances, Treynor
said, "although the award carries
with it a stipend, my salary is actu
ally lower than the take-home

salary of a graduate student" due to
differences in how he is paid for
classes for which he is a teaching as
sistant.
"But it's all just part of the com
mitment," he added.
Wasow noted that there was a
"high yield rate among Stanford
Graduate Fellows." Eventually, he
hopes the program will be able to
support at least 300 fellows —
about 100 a year. The University
should be able to continue at that
rate indefinitely once it has raised
the $200-million endowment, of
which $108 million had been raised
by last spring.
