# Defining Gen X
## Hoover visiting fellow explains dates, attitudes that mark twentysomethings 
### Matthew H. Blumenstein 
Generation X took form yestet
day as a social body and a political
attitude through the words of
Kellyanne l it/patrick, a visiting fcl
low at the I loover Institution.
In her presentation, "The I'oli
tics of Generation X: A Preview ol
Tomorrow's Voters, Consumers
and Leaders," l it/patrick took on
the mammoth task of giving mean
ing and cause to a generation
named for its lack of definition,
l it/patrick, who at 30 is part ol the
generation she analyzed, did so
through the use of extensive data
and interviews
By Fitzpatrick's definition, (Jen
eration X consists ol people bom
between 1965 and 197 K. She ac

knowledged the difficulty in putting
exact dates to a generation. I lowev
ei, I'it/patrick explained that
(ienX ers are those who grew up in
the Reagan Hush 1980s but were
too young to process important
landmark eventsol the late 19605.
The term "(feneration X" was
coined by Douglas ( oupland in his
1992 book of the same name. Fitz
patrick said he meant it as a slight.
And while Fit/patriek dislikes
the name and is actually organi/.
ing an ambitious contest to rename
the generation she admits that it
captures the fact that this is an
eclectic group with "no phrase or
buzzword."
According to lit/patrick.
