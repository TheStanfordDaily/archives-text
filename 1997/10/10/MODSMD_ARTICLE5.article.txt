# Defining Gen X
## Hoover visiting fellow explains dates, attitudes that mark twentysomethings 
### Matthew H. Blumenstein 
Generation X took form yestet
day as a social body and a political
attitude through the words of
Kellyanne l it/patrick, a visiting fcl
low at the I loover Institution.
In her presentation, "The I'oli
tics of Generation X: A Preview ol
Tomorrow's Voters, Consumers
and Leaders," l it/patrick took on
the mammoth task of giving mean
ing and cause to a generation
named for its lack of definition,
l it/patrick, who at 30 is part ol the
generation she analyzed, did so
through the use of extensive data
and interviews
By Fitzpatrick's definition, (Jen
eration X consists ol people bom
between 1965 and 197 K. She ac

knowledged the difficulty in putting
exact dates to a generation. I lowev
ei, I'it/patrick explained that
(ienX ers are those who grew up in
the Reagan Hush 1980s but were
too young to process important
landmark eventsol the late 19605.
The term "(feneration X" was
coined by Douglas ( oupland in his
1992 book of the same name. Fitz
patrick said he meant it as a slight.
And while Fit/patriek dislikes
the name and is actually organi/.
ing an ambitious contest to rename
the generation she admits that it
captures the fact that this is an
eclectic group with "no phrase or
buzzword."
According to lit/patrick.
GenX-ers are "entrepreneurial,
self-reliant, multicultural, tolerant
and libertarian." They are the
"original latchkey kids," who grew
up with a color TV and a mother

who often worked, in an era of no
fault divoree. Forty percent of
GenX-ers had lived in a single-par
ent household by the time they
were 16, Fitzpatrick said.
They grew up with "religion as a
side dish rather than a staple," and
the most often-mentioned memo
rable event of their childhood was

the explosion of the Challenger
space shuttle, she said.
Fitzpatrick said Generation X is
not apathetic, or lazy, as is often
said, but rather "shrug-shouldered"
with a lack of faith in institutions
that never gained their faith in the
first place. They have grown up in
an environment of broken promis

es, from their parents or the gov
ernment, so they do not put their
faith in bureaucratic institutions but
rather in hands-on, community-ori
ented programs with tangible,
quick results.
Volunteering for politicians is
declining rapidly among GenX-ers
but volunteering elsewhere is

markedly increasing. GenX-ers
support local control in govern
ment as well as political reform and
personal responsibility.
Voter turnout among Genera
tion X is meager, with just 17 per
cent participating in the 19% elec
tion, Fitzpatrick said. But she didn't
blame this on laziness, either.

One explanation is the archaic
voting process, which includes ab
sentee ballots, distant polling sites
and "blue-haired ladies" running
manually operated booths. Plus,
she said, there is little faith that
one's vote makes any difference.
GenX-ers, Fitzpatrick re-interated,
like instantaneous results.
