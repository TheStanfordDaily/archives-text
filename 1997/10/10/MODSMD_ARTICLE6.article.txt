# Group supports Stanford's Latinas
## 
### Rito Trevi√±o Staff writer 
If you were at El Centro Chi
cano on Monday night, you would
have seen the regular things that
accompany a student meeting
there: a table laden with ice cream
and other goodies, group leaders
hastily putting together an agenda,
and folks lounging on the couches
or gazing at the huge murals. Only
one thing was visibly missing:
Men.
The evening marked the first
social gathering of the year for
Unidas, a group that focuses on
the needs and issues of Chi
cana/Latina women at Stanford.
About 30 women from across cam
pus got together to meet prospec
tive new members, chat about the
group, and eat ice cream with col
ored sprinkles.
A number of freshmen were
present, and they were visibly ex
cited.
"It's an all-girl thing," said
freshman Sandy Padilla. "For me
it'll be a great support group, and
I'll have a network of friends."
Presiding over the meeting
were Unidas co-chairs C'elia (iar
cia, a junior, and Adela Huerta, a
senior. The two helped pioneer
the one-year-old group.
"Traditionally, Latina women
have been underrepresented at
higher institutions," Garcia said.

"Our background is much differ
ent from that of other girls. We
wanted to create a place at Stan
ford where we could hear each
other out."
The original members of
Unidas were once part of a similar
women's group, Mujcres at Stan
ford. The group, which has been in
existence for several years, is a de
pendent subsidiary of MEChA,

the statewide network that sup
ports Chicano / Latino issues on
campuses.
As more people joined MAS
without officially joining Ml ( hA,
a few members saw the need for an
independent women's group.
"Some members of MAS didn't
want to have to be a part of
ME( hA," recalled junior Vanessa
Delgado, Unidas' financial coordi

nator "T liey also wanted to break
away from some of the bureaucra
cy involved with a statewide
group."
I .ast fall the group was official
ly established. I he founding mem
bers called the group Unidas,
which is Spanish for "we are to
gether," to signify the focus on
