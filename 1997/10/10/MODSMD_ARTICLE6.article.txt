# Group supports Stanford's Latinas
## 
### Rito Trevi√±o Staff writer 
If you were at El Centro Chi
cano on Monday night, you would
have seen the regular things that
accompany a student meeting
there: a table laden with ice cream
and other goodies, group leaders
hastily putting together an agenda,
and folks lounging on the couches
or gazing at the huge murals. Only
one thing was visibly missing:
Men.
The evening marked the first
social gathering of the year for
Unidas, a group that focuses on
the needs and issues of Chi
cana/Latina women at Stanford.
About 30 women from across cam
pus got together to meet prospec
tive new members, chat about the
group, and eat ice cream with col
ored sprinkles.
A number of freshmen were
present, and they were visibly ex
cited.
"It's an all-girl thing," said
freshman Sandy Padilla. "For me
it'll be a great support group, and
I'll have a network of friends."
Presiding over the meeting
were Unidas co-chairs C'elia (iar
cia, a junior, and Adela Huerta, a
senior. The two helped pioneer
the one-year-old group.
"Traditionally, Latina women
have been underrepresented at
higher institutions," Garcia said.

"Our background is much differ
ent from that of other girls. We
wanted to create a place at Stan
ford where we could hear each
other out."
The original members of
Unidas were once part of a similar
women's group, Mujcres at Stan
ford. The group, which has been in
existence for several years, is a de
pendent subsidiary of MEChA,

the statewide network that sup
ports Chicano / Latino issues on
campuses.
As more people joined MAS
without officially joining Ml ( hA,
a few members saw the need for an
independent women's group.
"Some members of MAS didn't
want to have to be a part of
ME( hA," recalled junior Vanessa
Delgado, Unidas' financial coordi

nator "T liey also wanted to break
away from some of the bureaucra
cy involved with a statewide
group."
I .ast fall the group was official
ly established. I he founding mem
bers called the group Unidas,
which is Spanish for "we are to
gether," to signify the focus on

support and unity.
In its first year, Unidas managed
to put together some important
events for the Chicana / Latina
community. To get students in
touch with working professionals,
they put together a panel called
BANeLa (Bay Area Network Lati
nas). A group of women from the
area, including an engineer, a
World Wide Web developer, and a
business owner, came to the cam
pus and answered questions.
Erika Ornelas, a junior and a
Unidas co-chair for networking,
saw BANeLa as a chance for mem
bers to meet with their future
selves.
"We talked about stuff that we'll
be facing for ourselves tomorrow; it
was like viewing a series of steps in
time," Ornelas said.
The group also developed a pro
gram entitled Mujeres Unidas, in
which graduate and undergraduate
students alike joined in a discussion
forum for Latina women's issues.
Presently, Unidas is organized
around three "pillars" of activity.
Peer support, the most important of
these pillars, forms the basis for
weekly meetings. There, members
share their weekly experiences and
talk about immediately relevant is
sues. Additionally, Unidas puts to
gether retreats, study breaks (a.k.a.
"pampering sessions"), barbecues,
and even birthday celebrations.
Networking, the second pillar, is
the driving force behind BANeLa,
Mujeres Unidas, and other annual
programs. According to Ornelas,
the group's goals this year are to ex
pand connections with other cam
puses and coordinate a network be

tween Latina students and faculty.
In the past, Unidas has invited
influential faculty members, includ
ing Anna Marie Porras, who is a se
nior associate director at the Office
of Undergraduate Admissions and
Laura Dominguez Chan from the
Career Planning and Placement
Center, to speak at their meetings.
Unidas also hopes to create a
stronger network with other
women's groups on campus, Or
nelas said. This year they are
putting together a self-defense
workshop at the Women's Center,
which all Stanford women will be
encouraged to attend.
The third pillar of the organiza
tion, community service, is expand
ing. In the past, Unidas members
have aided other groups in the com
munity during social functions, in
cluding Los Hermanos de Stan
ford's "Club Caliente" and the Bal
let Folkl6rico spring concert.
This year, Unidas will be going
one step further by participating in
the Peer Resource Mother's Pro
gram at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter. There, they will counsel and
support young women through dif
ficult pregnancies.
One issue that Unidas has faced
is the question of whether or not the
group is akin to a Latina sorority, as
Los Hermanos de Stanford is some
times thought of as a Latino frater
nity. Unidas members insist that
this is a fallacy. Last year, a Latina
sorority at the UC-Berkeley invited
Unidas to convert to a Stanford
chapter, but the members declined.
"It's not that we're opposed to
sororities," Garcia said. "Some of
our members are actually in sorori
ties. We just want the freedom to
change as we see fit. Unlike a soror
ity, we want to be open to every
one."

Mujeres Unidas, and other annual
programs. According to Ornelas,
the group's goals this year are to ex
pand connections with other cam
puses and coordinate a network be

tween Latina students and faculty.
In the past, Unidas has invited
influential faculty members, includ
ing Anna Marie Porras, who is a se
nior associate director at the Office
of Undergraduate Admissions and
Laura Dominguez Chan from the
Career Planning and Placement
Center, to speak at their meetings.
Unidas also hopes to create a
stronger network with other
women's groups on campus, Or
nelas said. This year they are
putting together a self-defense
workshop at the Women's Center,
which all Stanford women will be
encouraged to attend.
The third pillar of the organiza
tion, community service, is expand
ing. In the past, Unidas members
have aided other groups in the com
munity during social functions, in
cluding Los Hermanos de Stan
ford's "Club Caliente" and the Bal
let Folkl6rico spring concert.
This year, Unidas will be going
one step further by participating in
the Peer Resource Mother's Pro
gram at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter. There, they will counsel and
support young women through dif
ficult pregnancies.
One issue that Unidas has faced
is the question of whether or not the
group is akin to a Latina sorority, as
Los Hermanos de Stanford is some
times thought of as a Latino frater
nity. Unidas members insist that
this is a fallacy. Last year, a Latina
sorority at the UC-Berkeley invited
Unidas to convert to a Stanford
chapter, but the members declined.
"It's not that we're opposed to
sororities," Garcia said. "Some of
our members are actually in sorori
ties. We just want the freedom to
change as we see fit. Unlike a soror
ity, we want to be open to every
one."
