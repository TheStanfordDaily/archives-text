# Earth Sciences celebrates 50 years

On its 50th anniversary, the School of Earth
Sciences is celebrating its growth, progress and
continuing improvement.
Assoc. Dean for External Affairs David Gor
don said the anniversary of the school's founding
is an opportunity "to reflect on our history and the
past."
In late September, the school held several
events to celebrate the anniversary, including lec
tures on "Earthquakes, Armageddon and the
Dead Sea Scrolls" and "Mapping the Amazon";
exhibits and displays on recent faculty and student
research; and a narrated slide show on "Mining
the Past." Earth sciences alumni and invited
guests also attended a barbecue as part of the cel
ebration.
Although distinct departments such as geology
and petroleum engineering existed earlier, only in
1947 were the different disciplines united under
one title. By bringing together all the related

areas, Gordon explained, the school is better able
to facilitate interaction and interdisciplinary re
search.
A.I. Levorsen, an eminent petroleum geolo
gist, was appointed the first dean. He reported to
alumni, "It is our objective to include all of the
subjects having the common denominator of min
erals and rocks in one school."
When Franklin Orr, the current dean, assumed
his position in 1994, he led a critical review of the
school's academic program under the scrutiny of
a committee of scholars appointed by Provost
Condoleezza Rice.
The examination led to reaffirmations of the
school's strength in research groups, many of
which are considered leaders in their fields. But
the study also revealed a reputation attached to
the faculty as "insular, not easy to work with."
While other Stanford schools were pursuing
exciting and ground-breaking research, the com
mittee found that the Earth Sciences faculty was
too disjointed and conservative.

As a result, the school initiated plans to assem
ble a bigger faculty, to add more scientific instru
ments and to offer additional courses to the Uni
versity at large.
In accordance with the initiatives, the school
has introduced new courses for undergraduates,
including tracks for interdisciplinary and non-sci
ence majors.
Orr, speaking in Stanford Report, said that
classes such as his Petroleum Engineering 110, a
sophomore seminar exploring "bubbles, inkjets
and surface tension," have been "so much fun that
many of our colleagues are watching us and plan
ning to get involved, too."
Early next year, the school will begin using a
new instrument called the Sensitive High-Resolu
tion lon Microprobe that detects, for example,
stardust and particles of sand.
Also, this month three professors, one special
izing in cosmogeochemistry, joined the Earth Sci
ences faculty. The school expects to recruit anoth
er four faculty members in the near future.
