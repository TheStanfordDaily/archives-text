# Merger of four IDPs shelved
## Public policy, international relations, urban studies, IPS will share building but not undergraduate curriculum 
### Jennifer Napier-Pearce 
Moving into the same building has
not brought four interdepartmental
programs any closer to merging their
curricula, professors involved acknowl
edged last week.
The chances of combining programs
in international relations, international
policy studies, public policy and urban
studies in the near future have nearly

evaporated, according to Judith Gold
stein, associate professor of political sci
and head of international policy
studies and international relations.
"The idea has just gone away. There
are no meetings, no charts, no commit
tees planned, no nothing," said Gold
stein. "My best guess is that it won't hap
pen for many years."
The idea of folding the four programs
under one departmental umbrella

emerged at a Faculty Senate meeting in
April when several professors an
nounced they were discussing the con
cept.
Courses in the four policy-based ma
jors seemed to overlap, and a combined
program would stretch financial re
sources and allow creation of a cotermi
nal program, said Economics Prof.
