# Merger of four IDPs shelved
## Public policy, international relations, urban studies, IPS will share building but not undergraduate curriculum 
### Jennifer Napier-Pearce 
Moving into the same building has
not brought four interdepartmental
programs any closer to merging their
curricula, professors involved acknowl
edged last week.
The chances of combining programs
in international relations, international
policy studies, public policy and urban
studies in the near future have nearly

evaporated, according to Judith Gold
stein, associate professor of political sci
and head of international policy
studies and international relations.
"The idea has just gone away. There
are no meetings, no charts, no commit
tees planned, no nothing," said Gold
stein. "My best guess is that it won't hap
pen for many years."
The idea of folding the four programs
under one departmental umbrella

emerged at a Faculty Senate meeting in
April when several professors an
nounced they were discussing the con
cept.
Courses in the four policy-based ma
jors seemed to overlap, and a combined
program would stretch financial re
sources and allow creation of a cotermi
nal program, said Economics Prof.
Roger Noll, director of the Public
Policy Program.
"A large number of faculty sup
ported the idea of a joint pro
gram," he said last week. "Since
[the programs] cover similar ana
lytic material, it makes sense to co
ordinate."
But some students worried the
proposal would hurt the strengths
of interdisciplinary programs by
limiting personal attention by pro
fessors and cutting student oppor
tunities to research.
The news that the four pro
grams will not be combining soon
relieves Kamron Hack, a senior in
urban studies.
"I'm pretty excited about that,"
she said. "I know I was a little con
cerned last year, not for me, but for
those coming into the program."
She worried a joint program
would result in "very techie" course
requirements unrelated to the
urban studies concentration. "To
make everyone focus on calculus
and statistics is a little unnecessary."
The four programs moved to
Building 60 in early September,
but faculty discussions revealed
significant splits between the pro
grams, according to Goldstein.
Noll held out hope for the idea
but admitted forging a common
curricula remained a long shot.
"We're trying to work out a
compromise and students seem
flexible, but some of the faculty
are reluctant," Noll said. "The
question is, how can the faculty
create this program without di
minishing the quality of the pro
gram for undergraduates? We
have not yet achieved a plan that
satisfies everyone in this re
gard."
"I hope it does happen, but I'm
not convinced it will," Noll added.
Goldstein predicted any change
would not affect undergraduates.
"If there ever is a broadening,
my sense is it's going to be on the
graduate level," she said.
