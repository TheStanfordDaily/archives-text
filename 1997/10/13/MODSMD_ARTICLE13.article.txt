# Harassment trial begins

WASHINGTON (AP)
Sworn testimony in the sexual
harassment suit against President
Clinton begins this week with all
sides scurrying for damaging evi
dence and digging in for a pro
tracted standoff. Talk of an out-of
court settlement is dead for now.
The depositions start off simply
enough, today in Little Rock,
Ark.: Paula Jones' mother and sis
ter will testify to what she told
them of the alleged 1991 hotel
room encounter. Next week, for
mer co-worker Pamela Blackard
and friend Debra Ballentine, both
confidantes of Mrs. Jones at the
time, are to give depositions.
From there, scheduled testimo
ny veers from the principals. Sub
poenas betray strategies: his to
prove her a profit-driven liar, hers
to prove him a chronic adulterer.
It is Clinton's often-ignored
codefendant who will peer into
Mrs. Jones' sexual past â€” a

defense the president's team was
forced to forswear months ago
after an uproar by women's
groups.
Some half-dozen witnesses to
Mrs. Jones' sexual reputation,
including past boyfriends and a
former employer, have been sub
poenaed by Bill Bristow, attorney
for Arkansas state trooper Danny
Ferguson. They will testify in
depositions beginning Oct. 17.
Both Clinton and Ferguson are
named in the $7(X),(XK) suit, whi ;h
U.S. District Court Judge Susan
Wright Webber scheduled for trial
next May.
Susan Carpenter McMillan, a
LA public-relations woman who
acts as Mrs. Jones' spokeswoman,
accused Bristow of doing the pres
ident's dirty work.
"It disgusts me, and Mr. Clin
ton's lawyers are letting it happen.
These are the same tired old tac
tics that have been used against

rape victims and molested chil
dren," she said.
Clinton, who was Arkansas
governor when he allegedly
propositioned the former state
employee, stands accused of sexu
al harassment. Mrs. Jones sued
Ferguson for defamation, finger
ing him as the source of a pub
lished account that depicted her as
eager to be Clinton's mistress.
Bristow said he is not influ
enced by the president's lawyers.
"I'm doing what is best for my
client. If one files a defamation
case, one puts one's personal repu
tation at issue," said the attorney,
who once defended one of Clin
ton's major political foes in an
Arkansas criminal matter.
The president's defense team,
led by Washington powerhouse
Robert Bennett, served subpoenas
in the last two weeks on groups
with ties to Carpenter McMillan or
Mrs. Jones' legal fund.
