# Execution in Colorado
## 
### 
CANON CITY, Colo. (AP) â€” Colorado
will break what a prosecutor calls its 30-year
"drought" on executions today when it puts
to death a man who raped a woman and then
riddled her with bullets, including nine in her
face.
Gary Lee Davis is scheduled to die by
lethal injection at 8 p.m. for the July IMS 6
murder of Virginia "Ginny" May.
May was 33 when Davis abducted her
while her two small children watched and
drove her with his wife to a secluded place.
The victim was raped, and Davis shot her to
death.
"What are these criminals who have been

sentenced to death and waiting in prison
offering society?" asked May's sister, Jerri
Cretti.
Colorado juries have been free to put peo
ple to death since 1978, two years after the
U.S. Supreme Court ended a four-year mora
torium on capital punishment. They have
been so hesitant to do so, however, that Okla
homa residents opposed moving the Timothy
McVeigh terror case to Colorado. McVeigh
was sentenced to death in Denver in August.
Davis' death could help make 1997 the
nation's highest year ever for executions. The
total so far is 57, the highest since 1957, when
65 people were executed.
