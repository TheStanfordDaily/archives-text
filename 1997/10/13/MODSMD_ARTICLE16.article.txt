## Editorial Making informed decisions 
### 
IN JANUARY MEMBERS of the
Faculty Senate narrowly defeated a
motion encouraging the School of
Humanities and Sciences to release
quantitative data from course evaluation
forms to the publishers of the ASSU
course guide.
Yet the perennial concern about the
failure to release quantitative data
gleaned from course evaluation forms
remains unresolved.
Currently, the only evaluative infor
mation available to students are the com
ments written on the bottom, tear-off
portion of the course evaluation forms.
Under a 1983 Faculty Senate statute, no
quantitative information • from cousne
evaluation forms may be released to stu
dents.
Although the University has made an
effort to post available qualitative infor
mation about courses on the World Wide
Web, we believe that these comments are
not sufficient to help students make
informed choices about classes.
There are several drawbacks to only
presenting this material. First of all, as
evaluation forms are generally distribut
ed in the last few minutes of class, few
students take the time to fill out the extra
tear-off section of the form.
Moreover, those who do so, generally
have strong feelings about the course
whether they be positive or negative, and
thus the exercise fails to reveal the views
of the silent majority.
The current online course guide based
on these comments has the potential to
be far too subjective, prone both to the
biases of the students writing the com
ments as well as those of the editors who
select the comments for the guide.
The addition of quantitative data
would provide more concrete informa
tion about the performance of profes
sors, teaching assistants and the overall
value of the course. It would also provide
a greater degree of objectivity because
the information it would contain would

be less subject to the whims of both stu
dents and editors.
The recalcitrance of the Faculty Sen
ate with regard to releasing quantitative
data is difficult to understand consider
ing that dozens of universities, including
Harvard, publish course guides with such
information.
At Harvard, the Committee on
Undergraduate Education, composed of
faculty, university officials and students,
work together to release a detailed
course ratings guide known as the "CUE
Guide." If many schools have found that
the costs of releasing quantitative data
outweigh the benefits, why should the
case b<* any different for Stanford?
More importantly the message that
the failure to release this quantitative
information sends is that the faculty does
not trust students to evaluate them fair
ly-
Considering that Stanford has an
Honor Code and Fundamental Standard,
it seems contradictory that faculty trusts
students enough to have unproctored
examinations, but does not trust students
to approach course evaluations with
maturity and honesty.
The ASSU should also be taking a
larger role in mobilizing student opinion
around this issue. Because the Faculty
Senate is unlikely to act quickly, it is
incumbent on the ASSU to make sure
that the issue of releasing quantitative
information remains on the agenda and
to let the Faculty Senate know that stu
dents care about obtaining it.
The importance of a course guide with
meaningful quantitative information can
not be underestimated, especially since
the Registrar has broached the possibili
ty of some form of pre-registration in the
near future.
If students are to sign up for classes
without the benefit of a shopping period,
then the necessity of a course guide with
both quantitative and qualitative infor
mation will be even greater.
