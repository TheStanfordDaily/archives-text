## Safeguarding our humanity 
### 
Mom and dad
came to visit last
weekend.
My parents tend to
be quite self-sufficient and
unobtrusive visitors; they
borrow my car and pack
their time with activities.
So the only family obliga-

tion they usually expect from my brother
and me is to eat a few nice meals that they
buy for us.
It's not a bad deal.
But from the outset, this trip looked a lit
tle different.
This was because one of the main events
on their itinerary was helping me settle into
my new home.
This is my first year living off campus,
and though the idea was originally met with
some amount of resistance from the
parental factor, my cute shared home in the
college terrace quickly turned their opposi
tion into enthusiasm.
And while I looked forward to enlisting
their help, it was clear that our objectives
were not entirely insynch. Within minutes
of entering my new dwelling, while I was
still trying to point out decorative elements
and was debating with Mom whether to
purchase a stainless steel or rod iron skillet,
Dad was already inspecting my new home's
security features (or lack thereof).
After having spent that afternoon in the
city with a friend, I returned to find Pop
retrofitting my windows with new locks,
upgrading the back door with a dead bolt
and decorating the kitchen with a fire extin
guisher.
While I appreciated his efforts and good
intentions, part of me was annoyed at what
I deemed to be unnecessary fuss.
Granted the fact that I'm notorious in
my family for my lack of any safety intu
ition, I guess I should refer to my father's
superior knowledge in this arena.

Admittedly, I have a penchant for walk
ing city streets alone late at night, and I have
enjoyed the convenience of using deserted
ATMs at odd hours.
It seems that being raised in a low crime
zone like beachy Santa Barbara did not
make me very street wise.
I concede, I should be more careful.
Especially in light of the recent acts of crime
on campus, it is in everyone's best interest
to be a little extra vigilant.
But I think we also need to be cautious
that our concerns for safety don't eclipse
our ideals. For it is my experience that peo
ple often make conclusions as to what con
stitutes a security threat based on unfair
assumptions about race and physical
appearance.
Even at an open-minded place like Stan
ford people are harassed simply for straying
from the homogeneous prototype.
When I was a sophomore, my then
boyfriend, a tall, long-haired Hispanic man,
was visiting one weekend and was amusing
himself by playing pool in the lounge while
I studied in my room. One of the house
RAs, who suspected him of not belonging
there, gave him a hard time about his iden
tity and made him feel very ill at ease in my
dormitory.
And last spring, when I was working on
a story for The Daily, 1 stopped by to send a
fax after my painting class and was received
with considerable hostility by a guy in
advertising.
I'd used the fax there before with no dif
ficulties when I was dressed in preppy
clothes, but today I was looking paint spat
tered and grubby and was hardly respectful
ly received.
After I had explained who I was and
what I was doing he conceded to let me use
the machine, but asked accusingly, "Why
the overalls?"
Why not the overalls? If we reason con
sciously, I don't think my ex-boyfriend was

any less likely to be a dorm-invader if he
was a short-haired white guy, and I don't
think I'm any less likely to be a fax machine
fraud if I wore a J. Crew outfit.
But the community isn't reasoning con
sciously.
I'm sure there are many people at this
school who for some reason don't look "the
part," either because of race or fashion and
who are treated with repeated antagonism
simply because people, based on biased
notions, suspect them of being a safety
threat.
On a national scale, safety paranoia has
even more serious ramifications. Public fear
of criminals has encouraged politicians
tocreate laws with unreasonably lengthy
prison terms for petty crimes.
The famous "three strikes" law that
mandates 25 years to life sentences for
repeat offenders is overflowing our jails
with people who don't need to be there.
While only certain crimes count for the
first strike, 75 percent of second and third
strikers are charged with non-violent, non
serious offenses. That means that someone,
if they have a previous felony for which they
have already served time, can be sentenced
to 25 years in jail simply for possession of
marijuana or for stealing pizza.
And this is a very popular law because it
gives people some sense that they're being
protected.
So, while it is probably a good thing to
have locks on your windows and deadbolts
on your back doors, you should be cautious
that your sense of safety isn't being defined
by television characterizations of "good"
and "bad" people. It's crucial that our con
cerns for safety don't cause us to hurt inno
cent people.
Go ahead and lock those doors, just
don't lock your humanity out.
