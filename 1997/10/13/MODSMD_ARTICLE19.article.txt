Kick-off event in year-long
Snyder series applauded
Thank you to writer Kumar Narayanan
for his fine review of Gary Snyder's poetry
reading at Kresge Auditorium on Oct. 9.
I appreciate his observations about Sny
der, the reading and the Humanities Cen
ter's year-long workshop on Snyder's poem,
"Mountains and Rivers Without End."
One reason for running this workshop is
to build community among scholars
through exploration of Prof. Snyder's com
pelling poem.
We're off to a great start!
Numerous Stanford departments, pro
grams and offices have contributed to mak
ing this reading and the workshop possible.
They include: The Center for Buddhist
Studies, Center for East Asian Studies,
Departments of Art, Asian Languages,
Comparative Literature, Drama, English,
Religious Studies, Humanities Special Pro
grams, Office of the Dean of H&S, Office of
the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion. Continuing Studies and the Stanford
Humanities Center with funds from the

Mellon Foundation.
Thanks to all for encouraging this truly
collaborative research effort.

Juvenile hall bible study
welcomes new volunteers
I appreciate the interest The Daily
showed in the juvenile hall bible study orga
nized by the Catholic community at Stan
ford.
I am sure it has increased awareness of a
significant group of students on campus.
With this regard, 1 would like to stress
that the program is looking for new volun
teers.
We have experienced that discussion in
smaller groups is always more effective, and
we would really like to increase our num
bers so that we can divide into smaller
groups and get the most out of these
evenings.
Anyone is welcome to join us. We meet
at the Corner Pocket in Tresidder, at 6 p.m.
every first Tuesday of the month and from
there we carpool to the juvenile hall.

If you would like to give it a closer look,
come by. Or, if you want to be registered on
our mailing list, send me an e-mail (sabat
ti@stat).

Mysterious photo warrants
explanation
I was truly amazed to see a photo on the
front page of Thursday's Daily in which a
practitioner of transcendental meditation
was shown overcoming the force of gravity
using sheer mental power.
The picture shows Pat Peel, "a farmer
who studies and teaches transcendental
meditation," clearly floating a foot or so off
the ground.
If Mr. Peel has developed a means of
overcoming a fundamental law of physics,
this is truly earth-shattering news. If not,
surely the Daily owes its loyal readers some
explanation for the picture apparently
showing him doing so.
