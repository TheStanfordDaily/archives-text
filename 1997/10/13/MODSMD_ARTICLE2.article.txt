# Athletic Dept. punishes Band for halftime show
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Editorial staff 
A week after their controversial perfor
mance during the Stanford- Notre Dame
football game, the Stanford Band is now fac
ing punishment from the University.
After consulting with University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, Athletic Director Ted
Leland issued a statement Friday reprimand
ing the band for the halftime show and out
lining punitive measures.
According to the statement, the Athletic
Department, which currently reviews all
band scripts, will revamp its current review
procedure.
Also, the band is now prohibited from
participating in the pre-game and halftime
shows when Notre Dame returns to campus
in 1999. The band will not be allowed to trav
el to Notre Dame for football games in 1998
and 2000.
The band came under fire, especially from
Catholics and Irish-Americans, after pre
game and halftime shows that the band says
were intended to mock Notre Dame's
"racist" mascot: a leprechaun representing
the "Fighting Irish."
However, even the band admits that other
aspects of the show, which included a parody
of the Irish Potato Famine and a band mem

ber dressed as a Catholic cardinal, were of
fensive to some viewers.
However, according to band manager
Scott McKissen, a senior, the band's inten
tions and statements have been misrepre
sented in the media, compounding some peo
ple's outrage.
In an article that ran on the San Jose Mer
cury News' World Wide Web edition yester
day, a statement from the band's apology for
the incident, which is up on their web page,
was quoted out of context.
The statement says "We did not intend to
imply that all members of the Catholic
Church believe that the sun revolves around
the earth, that the earth is flat, that the uni
verse has only existed for four thousand
years, that evolution is a farce, or that con
traception is wrong."
In the web version of the article, the first
six words were omitted from the quotation,
inverting the intended meaning. Instead, the
fragment was prefaced with the words "In a
parting shot, the band's note added."
Calling the Mercury News' action "pur
peflefnl r, and malicious," McKissen said that
articles such as this have "made the problem
worse... they are making people who were
not at the game mad."
