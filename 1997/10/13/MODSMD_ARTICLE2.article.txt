# Athletic Dept. punishes Band for halftime show
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Editorial staff 
A week after their controversial perfor
mance during the Stanford- Notre Dame
football game, the Stanford Band is now fac
ing punishment from the University.
After consulting with University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, Athletic Director Ted
Leland issued a statement Friday reprimand
ing the band for the halftime show and out
lining punitive measures.
According to the statement, the Athletic
Department, which currently reviews all
band scripts, will revamp its current review
procedure.
Also, the band is now prohibited from
participating in the pre-game and halftime
shows when Notre Dame returns to campus
in 1999. The band will not be allowed to trav
el to Notre Dame for football games in 1998
and 2000.
The band came under fire, especially from
Catholics and Irish-Americans, after pre
game and halftime shows that the band says
were intended to mock Notre Dame's
"racist" mascot: a leprechaun representing
the "Fighting Irish."
However, even the band admits that other
aspects of the show, which included a parody
of the Irish Potato Famine and a band mem

ber dressed as a Catholic cardinal, were of
fensive to some viewers.
However, according to band manager
Scott McKissen, a senior, the band's inten
tions and statements have been misrepre
sented in the media, compounding some peo
ple's outrage.
In an article that ran on the San Jose Mer
cury News' World Wide Web edition yester
day, a statement from the band's apology for
the incident, which is up on their web page,
was quoted out of context.
The statement says "We did not intend to
imply that all members of the Catholic
Church believe that the sun revolves around
the earth, that the earth is flat, that the uni
verse has only existed for four thousand
years, that evolution is a farce, or that con
traception is wrong."
In the web version of the article, the first
six words were omitted from the quotation,
inverting the intended meaning. Instead, the
fragment was prefaced with the words "In a
parting shot, the band's note added."
Calling the Mercury News' action "pur
peflefnl r, and malicious," McKissen said that
articles such as this have "made the problem
worse... they are making people who were
not at the game mad."
"A good fraction of the offense
has been misrepresentation," said
junior Paul Kalanathi, the band's
public relations director.
The print version of the article in
yesterday's Mercury News was
slightly different, and did not in
clude the paragraph in question.
Mercury News staff writer S.L.
Wykes, who wrote both the online
and printed articles, could not be
reached for comment.
According to McKissen, he
called the Mercury News several
times yesterday to object to the
error, but the on-line article was
not removed from the web page
until 6:30 pm.
McKissen said the band was still
waiting for a retraction and apology
from the newspaper.

Band member Evan Nordby, a
sophomore, said that numerous
newspapers had also quoted the
band as saying that "Perhaps [the
Irish] are stinkin' drunks," a line he
says was not in the script of the
band's show.
Band members also took issue
with the assertion made in several
newspapers that they had not is
sued an apology until last Friday.
According to McKissen, the band s
apology, which includes the state
ments "last week we offended a
group of people we had no inten
tion of insulting" and "We erred in
judgment, and we apologize" was
on their web page as of last
Wednesday.
The band also issued a one-para
graph press release on Friday, enti
tled "Stanford band Clarifies Apol
ogy," which reiterated the state
ments on the web page in con
densed form.
