# Vanessa Bartsch: Showering with the boys
## Dark secrets in the desk drawer 
### 
IT WAS AN honest mistake, I swear. It
began in my friend Jim's bedroom. I was
sitting on his bed, listening to Dave
Matthews, waiting for him to get back from
a midnight kitchen raid. Out of nowhere
one of his neighbors appeared and
informed me he desperately needed a rub
ber band.
I scanned Jim's less than pristine desk
top. I even looked behind some vodka, a
pack of cigarettes and a random smurf-blue
course reader. No luck.
If I had just given up and held out for Jim
and some nachos, I could have remained
oblivious. But being the stubborn glutton I
am, I felt a Martha Stewart-ish rush of
determination.
I thought about where normal folk keep
office supplies and without a second
thought went for the top drawer of Jim's
desk. 1 figured he wouldn't care. I mean you
just don't keep personal things in a top desk
drawer.
This logical assumption was my primary
undoing. Because there, in his little parti
tioned desk organizer, was a stack of shiny,

new, green, metallic-packaged condoms.
With spermicide. Seeing them, 1 blinked
twice and quickly told his neighbor that I
didn't see any rubbers and slammed the
drawer.
His friend from across the hall thanked
me and went back into his room. Left all
alone, my mind started down the road
toward paranoid city.
Jim has condoms. In his desk drawer.
The TOP draw. Right in the front. Next to a
roll of duck-tape and some tacks. Not five
feet from his bed.
This is information 1 don't know how to
process. I mean sex is great, and safe sex is
even better. But this is Jim. The guy 1 have
known for just a couple of weeks. The guy I
am sort of dating. The guy who has Plato
and the Holy Bible next to his bed!
The guy who is apparently using a lot of
condoms.
My find is not doing much for the doubts
already lingering in my head. What seemed
like such insignificant shadows have
become storm clouds.

I am caught in a bind. Getting to know
someone, especially someone that makes
your little rabbit heart pitter-patter, is never
a test of logic. Somehow emotion, rational
or not, always kicks in like the urge to get
off campus on a Saturday.
My little glimpse into Jim's dark
mahogany desk drawer hit me like a D on a
first paper. What was I thinking? 1 mean
how can someone this charming not be
sketchy? Here is a boy so sure of his seduc
tive maneuvers that he takes the care to put
multiple condoms within an arms reach of
his bed. My sketchy alert system is flashing
like the strobes of a Wilbur fire-alarm.
But then there is a part of me trying to be
reasonable. After all, Jim is very attractive,
and to freak over nothing could waste what
could potentially be an exciting relation
ship. My id is searching madly for reason
able explanations. 1 mean, 1 myself have a
basket with 60 condoms sitting right next to
my desk. That is 10 times as many as Jim,
and they are wide out in the open.

But 1 am an RA. 1 am allowed to have
condoms. 1 am supposed to have condoms.
And they are given to me for my residents.
1 don't hide them. They are a good 15 feet
away from my pillow.
So then I start thinking, "Hey, at least he
is concerned with being safe." That is sort of
touching, if not in a Hallmark card-ish way.
Nonetheless, it helps for a moment.
But does he really need six? Maybe he
has women over every night. Except for
Sunday, of course. He has a Bible, so he
can't be getting naughty on the day of rest.
And that is why there are six.
It all becomes clear now. He has a sex
system. He replenishes his supply with a
Monday trip to Ye Olde Safer Sex Shoppe.
He is a regular. They know him by his first
name and as "That guy who sure gets a lot
of condoms."
Okay, 1 am blowing things ridiculously
out of proportion. I try to get a grip as 1 hear
footsteps coming up the stairs. 1 think about
what my Mom, the sweetest woman 1 know,
would say. She would give him the benefit
of the doubt: He keeps them in case his

friends need them. That's sweet.
If it were anyone else it wouldn't bother
me, but this is Jim. Whose bed 1 am sitting
on. Who puts his arms around my waist so
tightly when he hugs me. Who can make me
turn bright red with just a wink. Who is just
so damn svelte.
So I think about my options. I am totally
over-reacting. This 1 know. But that doesn't
solve the nervous jittering of my leg. I could
tell him what happened, make a joke and
see what he says. Or I could just happen to
open the drawer and let him explain.
But I don't have time to think about the
best way to do it. Jim walks back in, closes
the door and hands me a beer. He gives me
that seductive smile. Then he winks. Oh.
dear.
So, Jim, you're Catholic... right?
