# Latino fraternity may open new chapter at Stanford
## 
### Lauren Phillips 
Members of Gamma Zeta Alpha, a Chi
cano/Latino fraternity which is at present
found at six California schools, are making an
effort to open a chapter here on campus.
Stanford currently has several ethnic frater
nities and sororities geared towards African-
American and Asian-American students, but
no Chicano / Latino Greek organizations.
There will be an introductory meeting
tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the conference room of El
Centra Chicano for students who are interested
in finding out more about the new fraternity.
The meeting is intended to attract young
men who are interested in starting the chapter
here at Stanford. The fraternity, which was
started in 1987 and is the oldest Latino fraterni
ty on the West Coast, was formed at Chico State

University.
Since that time, chapters have been opened
at San Jose State, UC-Berkeley, Cal State-
Northridge, Fresno State and San Diego State.
Steven Guillen, a student at UC-Berkeley,
is in part responsible for the efforts to bring
Gamma Zeta Alpha to campus.
The fraternity was interested in expanding
its chapters and decided to target Stanford, ac
cording to Guillen, because of the high Latino
population and the level of involvement on
campus.
Stanford has a total undergraduate Latino
population of 736 students, 11 percent of the
student body. Guillen he had "received a very
positive vibe from people on campus" about
opening a Stanford chapter.
Gamma Zeta Alpha is an independent fra
ternity and is a part of the I nterfraternity Coun

cil. According to Guillen, this makes branch
ing out and opening new chapters and other
universities more challenging.
The goals of Gamma Zeta Alpha, stated on
its World Wide Web page, are to "maintain our
principles of academic excellence, community
service and the fostering of our Latino cul
ture," and "to promote higher education for all
Latinos and also focus on their retention once
at the university level."
Commenting on the possibility of a Gamma
Zeta Alpha chapter, Dean of Students Marc
Wais said "the University always welcomes
new organizations that reflect Stanford's great
diversity."
A student group, called Los Hermanos does
already exist on campus for Chicano / Latino
men.
According to junior Anibal Sanchez, a rep

resentative of the group, although Los Her
manos is not a Greek organization, it is often
likened to a fraternity and serves essentially the
same social and community service functions
as a fraternity would.
He said he and other organizations at El
Centro Chicano were taking a neutral stand on
the fraternity, and that to his knowledge no
one on campus had asked the fraternity onto
campus.
"We support [Gamma Zeta Alpha's] efforts
if there is a need to be met. If this is going to
help the students, that's fine, but we're not tak
ing an active role," said Sanchez.
At present, there are no plans to bring a Chi
cana/Latina sorority to campus, however
there have been unsuccessful efforts in the past
to turn Unidas, a Chicana / Latina women's
group into a Greek organization.
