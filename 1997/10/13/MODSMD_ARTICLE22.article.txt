■ SATURDAYS RESULT:
Arizona 28, Stanford 22

Eight Stanford fumbles, five of
which were recovered by Arizona,
doomed the Cardinal and sent No.
25 Stanford (4-2,2-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) to its first conference loss of
the season, 28-22 against the Wild
cats (3-3, 1-2).
The defeat does not end Stan

ford's hopes for a conference cham
pionship, but it certainly puts a sig
nificant block in the Cardinal's road
to the Rose Bowl.
Arizona came into the game fea
turing the second-best defense in the
Pac-10. The Wildcats played even
better than that, dominating a Stan
ford offense that had averaged 39
points and 470 yards in its previous
three games.
The Cardinal gained only 236
yards of offense, including a meager
11 rushing yards after running for
322 a week earlier against Notre
Dame.
Hut the fumbles killed Stanford's
chances more than its poor rushing
attack.
"Any time you have the
turnovers that we had, it makes it ex

tremely difficult to win," said Stan
ford head coach Tyrone Willing
ham.
Appropriately, a fumble sealed
the loss and ended the game.
The Cardinal's final possession
began on its own 33 with just 59 sec
onds left, trailing 2X-22. The Wild
cats had recovered a Stanford onside
kick with two minutes left but ran
only three plays before punting to
give Stanford its last chance for a
miraculous finish.

terback C had Hutchinson found se

recovered. The Wildcats then ran
out the clock.
Another Dunn fumble earlier in
the fourth quarter was even more
costly. After a 28-yard punt by Ari
zona's Chris Palic, the Cardinal took
over at the Wildcat 40 trailing 28-19.
Stanford moved to the 24, and
Hutchinson connected with Dunn
for what appeared to be a first down.
But Bell was there to pop the ball
loose, and junior safety David Fipp
recovered for Arizona with 4:09 re
maining.
Only a bad mistake by the Wild
cats' redshirt freshman quarterback
Ortege Jenkins gave Stanford new
life. On third down from the 18, Ari
zona inexplicably called a pass play,
and Jenkins sailed the ball over the

head of his receiver and into the
hands of Stanford sophomore cor
nerback Chris Johnson. Johnson re
turned the interception to the Ari
zona 9-yard line, where Stanford
took over with 2:23 to go.
But the Wildcats' defense was
ready and made a crucial stop. Three
straight incomplete passes forced
the Cardinal to kick a 26-yard field
goal that closed the gap to 28-22.
Jenkins otherwise played a fabu
lous game for a quarterback making
only his second career start. Jenkins
threw for 167 yards and four touch
downs, especially blistering the Stan
ford secondary in the first half.
"We knew (Jenkins) was a good
quarterback," said senior corner
back Corey Hill, who was making a
return to his hometown of Tucson.
"He can run, he can throw. He cre
ates a lot of problems for the de
fense."

Stanford's own quarterback,
Hutchinson, played well considering
the intense pressure the Arizona de
fense put on him. He completed 22
of 39 passes for 225 yards and two
touchdowns and also did not throw
an interception for the third consec
utive game, a personal first.
But Hutchinson was the only
bright spot for the Cardinal offense.
Senior backs Anthony Bookman
and Mike Mitchell, who had each
gained more than 1(X) yards in the
previous three games, combined for
just 33 yards on 18 carries against the
Wildcats' suffocating run defense.
Incredibly, in the last four games
Stanford has played against Arizona
dating back to 1992, the Cardinal has
now run the ball 106 times for minus
-8 yards.
The Stanford offensive line strug
gled all night, failing to open holes
for the rushing attack and allowing

four Arizona sacks, three by senior
end Mike Szlauko, who seemed to
be in the backfield on every Cardinal
play.
"We scouted their offense heavi
ly," Szlauko said. "This was our
game. We came out with our hair on
fire and did it."
Another of Stanford's other big
playmakers, sophomore flanker
Troy Walters, had his worst game of
the year. Walters, one of the nation's
leading pass catchers, was held to
five catches and 36 yards receiving.
He also fumbled twice.
His second fumble, which came
only three plays after the first,
helped Arizona get off to a fast start.
With the game scoreless and Stan
ford on its second possession, Wal
ters caught a pass and raced to the
Wildcats' 42, where he was hit by
Fipp and lost the ball. Senior line
backer Chester Burnett recovered

and ran back to the Cardinal 39.
Seven plays later Jenkins found
senior Rodney Williams from 9
yards out for the touchdown, giving
Arizona the early 7-0 lead. Two Car
dinal penalties accounted for all but
those last 9 yards on the drive.
Walters made up for his miscue
on the next Cardinal possession,
catching a 5-yard touchdown pass on
an outstanding throw by Hutchinson
to tie the game at 7-7.
The Wildcats were forced to punt
just three plays later, but punter
Ryan Springston dropped the snap
and Stanford senior Jeff Byrd
blocked the kick. Junior Frank
Primus scooped up the ball and
waltzed 21 yards into the end zone
for a 13-7 Stanford lead. The Cardi
nal missed the extra point after a bad
snap, a mistake that proved costly.
Arizona did not lose its momen
tum. The Wildcats capitalized on a

porous Stanford secondary and a
fumbled exchange from Hutchinson
to Mitchell near the end of the half to
score two more touchdowns before
halftime and regain the lead 21-13.
The Cardinal defense played
much better in the second half. Ari
zona only gained 111 yards after in
termission, and Stanford limited the
Pac-10's best rushing team to 103
yards on the ground for the game.
Yet it wasn't enough, because the
Wildcats' defense consistently shut
down the Cardinal offense. Stanford
opened the second half by marching
70 yards in seven plays, finishing the
drive with another beautiful Hutchin
son pass to redshirt freshman
Deßonnie Pitts for a 17-yard touch
down that made it 21-19. Stanford's
two-point conversion attempt failed.
But the Cardinal did not score for
the next 25:32, rushing for 0 yards in
the second half.

the fourth quarter was even more
costly. After a 28-yard punt by Ari
zona's Chris Palic, the Cardinal took
over at the Wildcat 40 trailing 28-19.
Stanford moved to the 24, and
Hutchinson connected with Dunn
for what appeared to be a first down.
But Bell was there to pop the ball
loose, and junior safety David Fipp
recovered for Arizona with 4:09 re
maining.
Only a bad mistake by the Wild
cats' redshirt freshman quarterback
Ortege Jenkins gave Stanford new
life. On third down from the 18, Ari
zona inexplicably called a pass play,
and Jenkins sailed the ball over the

head of his receiver and into the
hands of Stanford sophomore cor
nerback Chris Johnson. Johnson re
turned the interception to the Ari
zona 9-yard line, where Stanford
took over with 2:23 to go.
But the Wildcats' defense was
ready and made a crucial stop. Three
straight incomplete passes forced
the Cardinal to kick a 26-yard field
goal that closed the gap to 28-22.
Jenkins otherwise played a fabu
lous game for a quarterback making
only his second career start. Jenkins
threw for 167 yards and four touch
downs, especially blistering the Stan
ford secondary in the first half.
"We knew (Jenkins) was a good
quarterback," said senior corner
back Corey Hill, who was making a
return to his hometown of Tucson.
"He can run, he can throw. He cre
ates a lot of problems for the de
fense."

Stanford's own quarterback,
Hutchinson, played well considering
the intense pressure the Arizona de
fense put on him. He completed 22
of 39 passes for 225 yards and two
touchdowns and also did not throw
an interception for the third consec
utive game, a personal first.
But Hutchinson was the only
bright spot for the Cardinal offense.
Senior backs Anthony Bookman
and Mike Mitchell, who had each
gained more than 1(X) yards in the
previous three games, combined for
just 33 yards on 18 carries against the
Wildcats' suffocating run defense.
Incredibly, in the last four games
Stanford has played against Arizona
dating back to 1992, the Cardinal has
now run the ball 106 times for minus
-8 yards.
The Stanford offensive line strug
gled all night, failing to open holes
for the rushing attack and allowing

four Arizona sacks, three by senior
end Mike Szlauko, who seemed to
be in the backfield on every Cardinal
play.
"We scouted their offense heavi
ly," Szlauko said. "This was our
game. We came out with our hair on
fire and did it."
Another of Stanford's other big
playmakers, sophomore flanker
Troy Walters, had his worst game of
the year. Walters, one of the nation's
leading pass catchers, was held to
five catches and 36 yards receiving.
He also fumbled twice.
His second fumble, which came
only three plays after the first,
helped Arizona get off to a fast start.
With the game scoreless and Stan
ford on its second possession, Wal
ters caught a pass and raced to the
Wildcats' 42, where he was hit by
Fipp and lost the ball. Senior line
backer Chester Burnett recovered

and ran back to the Cardinal 39.
Seven plays later Jenkins found
senior Rodney Williams from 9
yards out for the touchdown, giving
Arizona the early 7-0 lead. Two Car
dinal penalties accounted for all but
those last 9 yards on the drive.
Walters made up for his miscue
on the next Cardinal possession,
catching a 5-yard touchdown pass on
an outstanding throw by Hutchinson
to tie the game at 7-7.
The Wildcats were forced to punt
just three plays later, but punter
Ryan Springston dropped the snap
and Stanford senior Jeff Byrd
blocked the kick. Junior Frank
Primus scooped up the ball and
waltzed 21 yards into the end zone
for a 13-7 Stanford lead. The Cardi
nal missed the extra point after a bad
snap, a mistake that proved costly.
Arizona did not lose its momen
tum. The Wildcats capitalized on a

porous Stanford secondary and a
fumbled exchange from Hutchinson
to Mitchell near the end of the half to
score two more touchdowns before
halftime and regain the lead 21-13.
The Cardinal defense played
much better in the second half. Ari
zona only gained 111 yards after in
termission, and Stanford limited the
Pac-10's best rushing team to 103
yards on the ground for the game.
Yet it wasn't enough, because the
Wildcats' defense consistently shut
down the Cardinal offense. Stanford
opened the second half by marching
70 yards in seven plays, finishing the
drive with another beautiful Hutchin
son pass to redshirt freshman
Deßonnie Pitts for a 17-yard touch
down that made it 21-19. Stanford's
two-point conversion attempt failed.
But the Cardinal did not score for
the next 25:32, rushing for 0 yards in
the second half.
TUCSON, Ariz. — In its previ
ous two games, Stanford had not
committed a turnover.
Maybe the Cardinal was saving
up for Saturday night.

FOOTBALL

■ SATURDAYS RESULT:
Arizona 28, Stanford 22

Eight Stanford fumbles, five of
which were recovered by Arizona,
doomed the Cardinal and sent No.
25 Stanford (4-2,2-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) to its first conference loss of
the season, 28-22 against the Wild
cats (3-3, 1-2).
The defeat does not end Stan

ford's hopes for a conference cham
pionship, but it certainly puts a sig
nificant block in the Cardinal's road
to the Rose Bowl.
Arizona came into the game fea
turing the second-best defense in the
Pac-10. The Wildcats played even
better than that, dominating a Stan
ford offense that had averaged 39
points and 470 yards in its previous
three games.
The Cardinal gained only 236
yards of offense, including a meager
11 rushing yards after running for
322 a week earlier against Notre
Dame.
Hut the fumbles killed Stanford's
chances more than its poor rushing
attack.
"Any time you have the
turnovers that we had, it makes it ex

tremely difficult to win," said Stan
ford head coach Tyrone Willing
ham.
Appropriately, a fumble sealed
the loss and ended the game.
The Cardinal's final possession
began on its own 33 with just 59 sec
onds left, trailing 2X-22. The Wild
cats had recovered a Stanford onside
kick with two minutes left but ran
only three plays before punting to
give Stanford its last chance for a
miraculous finish.
On third down, sophomore quar
terback C had Hutchinson found se
nior wideout Damon Dunn at the
Stanford 41. But Dunn coughed up
the ball after being hit by sophomore
linebacker Marcus Hell and Arizona
