TUCSON, Ariz. — In its previ
ous two games, Stanford had not
committed a turnover.
Maybe the Cardinal was saving
up for Saturday night.

FOOTBALL

■ SATURDAYS RESULT:
Arizona 28, Stanford 22

Eight Stanford fumbles, five of
which were recovered by Arizona,
doomed the Cardinal and sent No.
25 Stanford (4-2,2-1 Pacific 10 Con
ference) to its first conference loss of
the season, 28-22 against the Wild
cats (3-3, 1-2).
The defeat does not end Stan

ford's hopes for a conference cham
pionship, but it certainly puts a sig
nificant block in the Cardinal's road
to the Rose Bowl.
Arizona came into the game fea
turing the second-best defense in the
Pac-10. The Wildcats played even
better than that, dominating a Stan
ford offense that had averaged 39
points and 470 yards in its previous
three games.
The Cardinal gained only 236
yards of offense, including a meager
11 rushing yards after running for
322 a week earlier against Notre
Dame.
Hut the fumbles killed Stanford's
chances more than its poor rushing
attack.
"Any time you have the
turnovers that we had, it makes it ex

tremely difficult to win," said Stan
ford head coach Tyrone Willing
ham.
Appropriately, a fumble sealed
the loss and ended the game.
The Cardinal's final possession
began on its own 33 with just 59 sec
onds left, trailing 2X-22. The Wild
cats had recovered a Stanford onside
kick with two minutes left but ran
only three plays before punting to
give Stanford its last chance for a
miraculous finish.
On third down, sophomore quar
terback C had Hutchinson found se
nior wideout Damon Dunn at the
Stanford 41. But Dunn coughed up
the ball after being hit by sophomore
linebacker Marcus Hell and Arizona
