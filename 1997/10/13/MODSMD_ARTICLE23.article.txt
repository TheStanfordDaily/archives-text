Stanford head coach Dante Det
tamanti said the Cardinal's empha
sis on driving is starting to produce
results.
"We got a few goals out of that,"
Dettamanti said. "It opened things

up a bit."
He added, however, that the of
fense still needs some fine-tuning in
order to decrease the number of
turnovers.
"It's a high-risk offense," Detta
manti said. "It's also a high-produc
ing offense. We want to be aggres
sive in our movements, but we want
to be careful passing the ball."
But Dettamanti said the Cardi
nal's defense was its greatest
strength this weekend.
Junior fielder Jeremiah Robison
agreed.
"It was great to go dqwn there
and play really strong defense and
come away with two strong wins
where we felt in control of the
game," he said.
The offense did produce, howev
er, especially in the Cardinal's
blowout of the 49ers (5-8,1-3) Satur
day at the Belmont Plaza Pool.
Ten different Stanford players
scored during the match, as the 49ers
surrendered a season-high 15 goals.
The Cardinal also capitalized on its
six-on-five man advantages by con
verting for seven out of nine.
Stanford broke open a 2-2 first

period tie by going on a 13-3 run for
the remainder of the match.
According to Stanford sopho
more goalie Paolo Resmini, the
match was "perhaps one of our
best."
Cardinal junior goalie Chris
Aguilera tallied nine saves during
the match. Resmini, who was substi
tuted in during the fourth quarter,
also tallied one save.

The Cardinal's winning streak
continued yesterday with a 7-3 de
feat of the defending NCAA cham
pion Bruins (6-5, 2-1) at UCLA's
Sunset Recreation Pool.
Stanford jumped out to a 3-0 at
halftime and refused to relinquish
the lead, holding UCLA scoreless
until 1 minute, 31 seconds remained
in the third quarter.
Aguilera registered six saves,

while UCLA's Nick Hill and Parsa
Bonderson tallied seven and one, re
spectively.
Dettamanti said the NorCal
Tournament at deCiuerre Pool this
weekend will prove to be a truer test.
"We know we can beat the teams
ranked below us," Dettamanti said.
"We'll find out this weekend if we
can beat the teams ranked in front of
us."
