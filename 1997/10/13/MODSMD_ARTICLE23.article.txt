WATER POLO

■ FRIDAY'S RESULT:
Stanford 15, Long Beach State 5
■ SUNDAYS RESULT:
Stanford 7, UCLA 3

Stanford head coach Dante Det
tamanti said the Cardinal's empha
sis on driving is starting to produce
results.
"We got a few goals out of that,"
Dettamanti said. "It opened things

up a bit."
He added, however, that the of
fense still needs some fine-tuning in
order to decrease the number of
turnovers.
"It's a high-risk offense," Detta
manti said. "It's also a high-produc
ing offense. We want to be aggres
sive in our movements, but we want
to be careful passing the ball."
But Dettamanti said the Cardi
nal's defense was its greatest
strength this weekend.
Junior fielder Jeremiah Robison
agreed.
"It was great to go dqwn there
and play really strong defense and
come away with two strong wins
where we felt in control of the
game," he said.
The offense did produce, howev
er, especially in the Cardinal's
blowout of the 49ers (5-8,1-3) Satur
day at the Belmont Plaza Pool.
