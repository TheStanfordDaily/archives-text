## Cross country wins Furman Invite 
### Becky Unruh Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and women's
cross country teams demonstrated
speed and depth at Saturday's Fur
man Invitational in Greenville, S.C.
After a weekend off, the Cardinal
was back to top racing form, winning
both the men's and women's team ti
tles and maintaining its dual No. 1
rankings.
Freshman Julia Stamps finished
the five-kilometer course in a quick
16 minutes, 44 seconds, a good time
for the SK.
"I was happy," Stamps said. "I
thought it was a really good race. At
about a mile and a half in, I separat
ed from the two Villanova girls and
just took off."
Stamps has had an impressive
rookie season to date, winning both
races that she has competed in.

The women's depth was evi
denced by the fact that four of five
scored runners finished in the top 10.
Senior Sarna Renfro finished in
fourth, behind two Villanova run
ners, with a time of 17:12. Junior
Mary Cobb and sophomore Sally
Glynn were scored for eighth and
ninth place, both crossing the line in
17:22.
Senior Kortney Dunscombe fin
ished 21st, with a time of 17:45,
rounding out the scored finishers for
Stanford. Freshman Ann Ramsey
finished 23rd, behind Dunscombe
by four seconds.
Stanford totaled just 39 points for
the event, 50 points less than second
place Wisconsin. Villanova finished
fifth in the team standings. Though
105 points behind Stanford, Villano
va runners finished in second, third
and fifth place. The Cardinal's depth
made the difference.
"We ran really well as a team,"
Stamps said. "Our team just did
awesome."
On the men's side, senior
Nathan Nutter was the Cardinal's
top finisher. Nutter was two sec
onds behind UCLA's Mebrahtom
Keflezighi, winner of the Stanford
Invitational. Nutter finished the
eight-kilometer course in 24:19.
Colorado's Adam Goucher won

the individual title with a time of 24
minutes.
Depth, as with the women,
made the difference for the men.
Juniors Brad and Brent Hauser
finished seventh and eighth with
times of 24:30 and 24:34, respec
tively. Senior Jason Lunn crossed
the line in 24:51 for an llth-place
finish. Lunn was two seconds
ahead of teammate Jason Balk
man, who ended up 12th. Fresh
man Jonathan Riley finished 20th
in 25:07.
The men totaled 43 points in the
contest, out-distancing Colorado
by 29 points. Wisconsin, another

strong team, ended up in third, 1 (K)
points off the lead.
The Cardinal faced hot and
humid conditions in South Caroli
na, not to mention adjusting to a
three-hour time difference. The
experience for the Cardinal will
prove valuable as NCAAs quickly
approach.
"One of our goals was to get a
good perspective of what we're
going into for nationals," Stamps
said. "We went to scope things out,
check out the course and get our
selves ready for nationals."
I'he two-week break may also
have contributed to the Cardinal's

commanding victories.
"It felt really good to get out
and run," Stamps said.
Clearly the Cardinal is the team
to beat as the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships approach.
Wins over top schools like Villano
va and Wisconsin should give Stan
ford confidence going in to the sec
ond half of the season. The Cardi
nal will be back to South Carolina
in November, having gained expe
rience after this weekend.
"We got a good feeling of where
we're at," Stamps said. "We
learned a lot. Now we just have to
... stay healthy."
