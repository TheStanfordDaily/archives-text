### Becky Unruh Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and women's
cross country teams demonstrated
speed and depth at Saturday's Fur
man Invitational in Greenville, S.C.
After a weekend off, the Cardinal
was back to top racing form, winning
both the men's and women's team ti
tles and maintaining its dual No. 1
rankings.
Freshman Julia Stamps finished
the five-kilometer course in a quick
16 minutes, 44 seconds, a good time
for the SK.
"I was happy," Stamps said. "I
thought it was a really good race. At
about a mile and a half in, I separat
ed from the two Villanova girls and
just took off."
Stamps has had an impressive
rookie season to date, winning both
races that she has competed in.

The women's depth was evi
denced by the fact that four of five
scored runners finished in the top 10.
Senior Sarna Renfro finished in
fourth, behind two Villanova run
ners, with a time of 17:12. Junior
Mary Cobb and sophomore Sally
Glynn were scored for eighth and
ninth place, both crossing the line in
17:22.
Senior Kortney Dunscombe fin
ished 21st, with a time of 17:45,
rounding out the scored finishers for
Stanford. Freshman Ann Ramsey
finished 23rd, behind Dunscombe
by four seconds.
Stanford totaled just 39 points for
the event, 50 points less than second
place Wisconsin. Villanova finished
fifth in the team standings. Though
105 points behind Stanford, Villano
va runners finished in second, third
