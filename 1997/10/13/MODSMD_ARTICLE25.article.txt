WOMEN'S SOCCER

■ FRIDA YS RESULT: USC 3, Stanford 2
■ SUNDA Y S RESULT: UCLA 2,
Stanford 1

The Stanford women's soccer team (4-7,0-
2 Pacific 10 Conference) confused more fans
this weekend at New Maloney Field, playing
scathing soccer but dropping two close games
to Pac-10 rivals USC and UCLA in its first con
ference games this season.

The team, after finally breaking out of a
month-long scoring drought last week with six
goals against Colorado College, found differ
ent reasons to lose this time, continuing its sea
son-long run as fate's punching bag.
"We played well," said head coach Steve
Swanson. "I think we played well enough to
win those games."
"We've been playing well all season, just
not getting results."
Both No. 20 USC and No. 18 UCLA
dumped Stanford by one goal each.
On Friday, Stanford kept pace with a strong
USC squad for most of the game, surprising
the Women of Troy with its quick play. But the
Cardinal eventually lost 3-2, as USC raised its
record to 10-1-1.

In the first half, Cardinal scorers were able
to provide answers for both of USC's goals.
At the 10-minute, 44-second mark, USC
midfielder Kim Clark beat Cardinal goalkeep
er Erin Bryla to a ball in the middle and
punched it in for the first goal of the game.
But Stanford answered back less than two
minutes later on freshman midfielder Shauna
Itri's second goal of the season.
USC regained the lead on a head-in at
38:17, but Cardinal senior midfielder Elie Fos
ter's long blast just 16 seconds later matched
USC at two goals apiece.
Then Stanford's gas tank ran dry.
With 30 minutes left, Bryla was forced to
boot the ball out of the left corner toward mid
field to clear it. But the ball flew right to Clark,
who immediately rocketed it four yards back
to the goal and past Bryla to put USC up 3-2.
Yesterday Stanford fared little better, los
ing to UCLA 2-1.
Stanford quickly went up 1 -0 on senior mid
fielder Emily Burt's team-high sixth goal of the
year but couldn't hold the lead as UCLA (10-
2,2-0) bounced back to tie the score at 1-1.

"We came out really hard — harder than
we have all year," Foster said. "But after they
scored, our intensity dropped a little."
"We played really well in the beginning of
the first half," said junior midfielder Christy
Stoffel. "But then we started to get unlucky."
Just three minutes into the second half,
Traci Arkenburg's shot from 30 yards out hit
the crossbar over the goal and narrowly
missed. Two minutes later, a shot deflected by
Cardinal freshman goalkeeper Carly Smolak
bounced off fellow Cardinal Celina DeLeon
and nearly rolled into the goal before DeLeon
retrieved it inches from the line.
But Stanford couldn't dodge fate forever,
and the Bruins' next bullet found its target.
On a throw-in, UCLA's Arkenburg looped
the ball off Rochelle Ouchi's head and over the
outstretched hands of Smolak for a 2-1 lead.
Stanford's best chance for vindication came
in the last 10 minutes of the game, but repeat
ed attacks by junior forward Tracye Lawyer
and Burt were knocked out of the middle by a
tough Bruin defense.
"It's tough to lose close games like that, es
pecially with a young team," Swanson said.
"For a lot of the players, it's their first time
going through a whole season and school. It
takes its toll."
