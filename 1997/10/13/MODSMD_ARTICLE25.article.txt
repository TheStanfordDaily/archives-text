WOMEN'S SOCCER

■ FRIDA YS RESULT: USC 3, Stanford 2
■ SUNDA Y S RESULT: UCLA 2,
Stanford 1

The Stanford women's soccer team (4-7,0-
2 Pacific 10 Conference) confused more fans
this weekend at New Maloney Field, playing
scathing soccer but dropping two close games
to Pac-10 rivals USC and UCLA in its first con
ference games this season.

The team, after finally breaking out of a
month-long scoring drought last week with six
goals against Colorado College, found differ
ent reasons to lose this time, continuing its sea
son-long run as fate's punching bag.
"We played well," said head coach Steve
Swanson. "I think we played well enough to
win those games."
"We've been playing well all season, just
not getting results."
Both No. 20 USC and No. 18 UCLA
dumped Stanford by one goal each.
On Friday, Stanford kept pace with a strong
USC squad for most of the game, surprising
the Women of Troy with its quick play. But the
Cardinal eventually lost 3-2, as USC raised its
record to 10-1-1.
