### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Don't tell the fourth-ranked Stanford women's vol
leyball team winning is easy.
With 31 consecutive conference wins at Maples
Pavilion and a 55-1 mark at home since IW4, most fans
cruise into Maples expecting a win. Maybe that's why
the season-high crowd of 2,502 was unusually rowdy
Friday night with their team down 8-5 in a critical game
four against No. 15 Arizona.
Stanford (lb-2,7-0 Pacific 10 Conference) respond
ed with 10 unanswered points to win the match 15 11,
15-12,11-15,15-8. The Card followed with a tough win
over unranked Arizona State Saturday 15-11, 15-12,
15-10 to complete the weekend sweep.

Arizona (12-3, 4-3) was expected to be the Cardi
nal's toughest challenge, and the Wildcats did not dis
appoint. Every game was a see-saw battle, every point
a momentum shift. Arizona played with the reckless
abandon of a team with nothing to lose, and it paid off
as the Wildcats jumped out to a 5-1 lead in game one.
"'Die reason we struggled was that their serving was
really aggressive," said senior setter Lisa Sharpley.
"They take risks and serve as hard as they can. It real
ly threw our passing off."
Stanford's offense slowly warmed up, especially that
of senior outside hitters Kristin Folk I and sophomore
Kerri Walsh. The pair guided the Cardinal attack and
finished with a match high 23 and 22 kills, respectively.
Stanford trailed in game one 11 - { ) before a ( 'ardinal
run that included a floating ace from Sharpley and a big
block from Walsh and Folkl put the ( ard up 14 11.
Walsh got the call on game jxunt, but the scrappy
Wildcat defense made a great dig. Sharpley, who fin
ished the match with a season high f>2 assists, went right
back to Walsh, and she put it away for the 15-11 victory.
(iame two was more of the same with the score
swinging back and forth to 10-10. Sophomore outside
hitter Jaimi Ciregory put the Card up for good with a
kill at 11-10. A quick set to senior middle blocker Bar
bara Ifejika was good for the 15-12 win.
'Die Wildcats' tenacity finally paid off with a 15-11
win in game three. Despite being outhit .240 to 156,
Arizona made the most of Stanford errors and scored
the last two points of the game on a Cardinal hitting
