### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Don't tell the fourth-ranked Stanford women's vol
leyball team winning is easy.
With 31 consecutive conference wins at Maples
Pavilion and a 55-1 mark at home since IW4, most fans
cruise into Maples expecting a win. Maybe that's why
the season-high crowd of 2,502 was unusually rowdy
Friday night with their team down 8-5 in a critical game
four against No. 15 Arizona.
Stanford (lb-2,7-0 Pacific 10 Conference) respond
ed with 10 unanswered points to win the match 15 11,
15-12,11-15,15-8. The Card followed with a tough win
over unranked Arizona State Saturday 15-11, 15-12,
15-10 to complete the weekend sweep.

Arizona (12-3, 4-3) was expected to be the Cardi

appoint. Every game was a see-saw battle, every point
a momentum shift. Arizona played with the reckless
abandon of a team with nothing to lose, and it paid off
as the Wildcats jumped out to a 5-1 lead in game one.
"'Die reason we struggled was that their serving was
really aggressive," said senior setter Lisa Sharpley.
"They take risks and serve as hard as they can. It real

Stanford's offense slowly warmed up, especially that
of senior outside hitters Kristin Folk I and sophomore
Kerri Walsh. The pair guided the Cardinal attack and
finished with a match high 23 and 22 kills, respectively.

"This season we really haven't

had to fight back," Sharpley said. "It
was a total team effort. They talked
so much through the net, and that
really fired our team up in the fourth
game."
Arizona carried the momentum
into that game and jumped ahead 8-
5. But that's when Stanford put the
hammer down and ended any hopes
the Wildcats had for an upset.
"You're staring at rally scoring,"
said head coach Don Shaw. "That
was a gut-check. We haven't had
matches where we've been in that
position."
Saturday's contest against the
Sun Devils (11-7, 2-5) was a differ

Shaw opted to rest Walsh, who was
nursing a sore right shoulder, and
the bench came up strong.
Stanford jumped out to a 6-1 lead
in game one. But Arizona State ral

Card ran off four unanswered
points and then won a jousting
match at the net for a 15-11 win.
Game two saw the Sun Devils
take a 12-7 lead and threaten to
even the match. But the Card
stepped it up behind the play of
freshman middle blocker Jennifer
Detmer, who had a career night
with 7 kills and a .667 hitting per
centage. Stanford ran off eight
unanswered points to win.
"We got through the rough spots
really well," Detmer said. "When
you get playing time, you take ad

Folkl and Sharpley, you know you
have people to back you up."
Stanford jumped out to a 6-0 lead
in game three behind the setting of
freshman Robyn Lewis. Arizona
State fought back to tie it 10-10, but
the Card finished it off, ending the
match on three straight serves from
freshman setter Lindsay Kagawa,
two of which fell in for aces.
"We were slow emotionally,"
Kagawa said. "1 just tried to come in
and fire everyone up. It's our role to

even the match. But the Card
stepped it up behind the play of
freshman middle blocker Jennifer
Detmer, who had a career night
with 7 kills and a .667 hitting per
centage. Stanford ran off eight
unanswered points to win.
"We got through the rough spots
really well," Detmer said. "When
you get playing time, you take ad
vantage. When you get to play with
Folkl and Sharpley, you know you
have people to back you up."
Stanford jumped out to a 6-0 lead
in game three behind the setting of
freshman Robyn Lewis. Arizona
State fought back to tie it 10-10, but
the Card finished it off, ending the
match on three straight serves from
freshman setter Lindsay Kagawa,
two of which fell in for aces.
"We were slow emotionally,"
Kagawa said. "1 just tried to come in
and fire everyone up. It's our role to
fill the voids. We came in and made
a difference."
