■ SUNDAY S RESULT:
Stanford 0, Oregon State 0

ITie No. 10 Cardinal (10-0-2,2-0
1 MPSF) beat No. 8 Washington (K
2-1,1-1 MPSF)I-0 in Seattle on Fri

day. ITie road trip continued yester
day, when Stanford battled ()regon
State (2-8-2, 0-1-1) to a scoreless
draw in overtime.
Head coach Bohhy ( lark said he
was "very happy with the road tr ip,"
which extends the Cardinal's un
beaten streak to 17 games over two
seasons. The team has recorded
shutoiits in its last seven matches.
The two games boosted redshirt
freshman goalkeeper Adam /a
pala's claim to national promi
nence. Zapala has the nation's low
est goals-against average at .16
Junior midfielder Eric Vande
velde scored the winning goal in
Friday's game, his second point of
the season. Sophomore defender
Gerard Davis and junior midfield
er Simon Elliott teamed up for the
assist, passing the ball to Vande
velde, who headed it in.
Zapala kept the Cardinal ahead
with a save on a penalty kick in the
44th minute.
Stanford managed to win de
spite the fact that the Huskies dom
inated offensively, recording 17
shots on goal to the Cardinal's five.
The Cardinal has rarely been out
shot this season.
"The win over Washington was
a very good win, and we deserved
it," Clark said.
On a rainy afternoon yesterday,
Stanford faced its second double
overtime match of the season with
the same result: a 0-0 tie. The pre
vious weekend, Dartmouth had
kept the Cardinal scoreless in 120
minutes of play.
While the Cardinal regained its
dominance in the shots-on-goal de

partment — recording 15 to Ore
gon State's 11 — Clark said his
team "really didn't get going until
the second half."
Some of the offensive troubles
may have come from a hamstring
injury suffered earlier in the sea
son that continues to hamper the
play of junior midfielder Jamie
Clark.
The games also marked the
"hardest road trip of the year,"
Clark said, because of the distance
the team had to travel between Fri
day and Sunday as well as the pres
sure of playing two conference
schools, particularly one ranked as
high as Washington.
This weekend's play puts the
Cardinal in line for a shot at the
MPSF Mountain Division title next
Sunday when it meets No. 16 Cali
fornia at New Maloney Field.
No. 2 UCLA is well on its way to
claiming the Pacific Division title.
The two division winners will play
each other in the MPSF champi
onship, with the winner receiving
an automatic bid to the NCAA
tournament.
