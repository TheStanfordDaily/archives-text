### Alicia McCann 
I his week, Stanford students
and faculty will have the chance to
leatn from renowned author and
Oxford University Prof. Lawrence
Weiscrantz, who will present a se
ries of four lectures. Called "The
Search for Consciousness: Inter
sections of Philosophy, Neuro
science, and Psychology," this lec
ture series focuses on amnesia and
the concept of blindsight.
Blindsight is a condition in
which patients who are brain dam
aged or visually impaired still re
tain an uncanny ability to distin
guish certain visual information.
Weiscrantz, who was among the
initial researchers to document the
phenomenon, will be further ex
plor ing this concept during the lec
tures.
Susan Dunn, associate director

of the Stanford Humanities Cen
ter, anticipates a positive reaction
to the lectures. This is due in part
to the fact that the series was de
signed to present a unique blend of
several disciplines.
"What is exciting," she said, "is
that Professor Weiscrantz is bring
ing together people from the med
ical school, social sciences and the
humanities. Who isn't interested in
amnesia? It never goes out of fash
ion or interest."
Weiscrantz, professor emeritus
of psychology, has studied amnesia
for more than 30 years. His most
recent book, "Consciousness Lost
and Found," helps to document his
findings. He is also the author of
"Blindsight: A Case Study and Im
plications," in addition to being
the co-writer and editor of books
such as "Animal Intelligence" and
" Thought Without Language." His

list of credits in
cludes a bachelor
of sciences degree
from Oxford and
a doctorate from
Harvard Univer
sity. Before teach
ing at Oxford, he
taught for 11

years at Cambridge University.
He has received awards such as
the Craik Prize from Cambridge,
the Hughlings Jackson Medal from
the Royal Society of Medicine and
the William James Fellowshipof the
American Psychological Society.
Weiscrantz is being brought to
Stanford through the Harry Camp
Memorial Lectures program.
Camp was a philanthropic busi
nessman, and the program was
constructed in his name with the
goal of bringing speakers to the
University to present public lec

tures. Since its creation in 1956, the
series has featured such speakers
as Jean Franco, Richard Poirier
and Elie Weisel.
The lectures will take place in
Building 200, Rm. 2. Each lecture
begins at 4:30 p.m., and students
will be admitted on a first come,
first serve basis. There is no cost
for admission.
Today the series begins with a
lecture titled "To Have But Not to
Hold." Following the lecture there
will be a free reception open to the
public. The second lecture, pre
sented tomorrow, is titled
"Thought Without Language.
Thought Without Awareness." On
Wednesday, Weiscrantz will dis
cuss "The Blind Leading the Sight
ed and Learning From Their
Pupils." The series will conclude
Thursday with "Imaging and the
Imageless."
