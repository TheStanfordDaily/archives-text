# Online standardized tests cause student anxiety

Stanford students may soon be yearning for
bubble forms and No. 2 pencils, which are bccom
ing dinosaurs in the world of standardized tests.
I he Educational Testing Seivice, which ad
ministers both the Graduate Record Exam and
Graduate Management Aptitude Test, is quickly
replacing its traditional paper-and-pencil test
with the computer-adaptive test. The GMAT
now is only offered on computer and only two
moie paper and pencil GRE tests are scheduled.
Computer-based testing is creating "a lot of
anxiety on the part of students who are accus
tomed to taking paper exams," said Kathy
Wright, associate director of the Undergraduate
Advising Center.
Business student Caiin Mueller is one who's a
little worried. "I could not imagine doing (the
GMAT| on the computer," she said. "I think bet
ter with pencil and paper."
The format is new for almost everyone, said
Andiea Wilson of Kaplan Educational Centers,
which offers test preparation courses. "Most stu

dents have never taken a test like this before," she
said. "It requires students to shift gears. It's a for
eign format."
A computer-based test is more than just
throwing the paper-and-pencil version onto a
screen. According to information provided by the
testing service, the new version is "based on your
ability level. It isa test tailored to each examinee."
Each test starts with a question of medium dif
ficulty. "If the first question is answered correctly,
the computer selects a harder one. If the first an
swer is incorrect, an easier question is chosen." A
score is generated based on the difficulty level of
the questions answered.
Another difference is there are only one verbal
and one quantitative section instead of the tradi
tional three of each. The writing portion has not
been changed.
The testing service says there are distinct ad
vantages to the computer-based test: scores are
processed immediately so students can then de
cide which schools will receive them; tests are ad
ministered year-round rather than the traditional
four times a year; and the test is potentially short

er depending on one's speed.
However, test takers have yet to embrace this
line of reasoning. One complaint is that returning
to previous questions is not possible on the com
puter.
"I like to have control of how I do it. If I want
to go back to front I can," said Jose Cotarelo, a
business student. "Otherwise I am at the mercy of
the computer."
"I like to answer questions in the order I want
to answer them," he added. "And if it fits in my
strategy to skip it, I can always go back to it later"
on the pencil-and-paper test.
Kaplan administrators have noticed students'
concern. "Students were rushing to take the last
paper-and-pencil exam," Wilson said. "Our busi
ness grew astronomically earlier this year."
Wright has noticed the same trend at Stanford,
where students have rearranged their schedules
to accommodate the paper test. "Students seem
to be straining to take a paper test instead of a
computer-generated test," she said.
According to the testing service, 75 percent of
students who take the GRE do it on paper.
