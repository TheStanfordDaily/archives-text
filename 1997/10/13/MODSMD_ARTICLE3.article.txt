# Alumna flies suit in police incident
## Charges excessive force used during 1993 Big Game 
### Angel Flores Contributing writer 
A Stanford alumna has filed a lawsuit
against the University, alleging that a Stan
ford police officer used excessive force on her
during an incident at the 1993 Big Game.
Ava Besbris, Class of '8(), claims that Offi
cer Allen James attacked her after a verbal
confrontation, causing permanent damage to
her right arm.

James' account, detailed in a police inci
dent form, contends that Besbris was intoxi
cated, refused to leave the stadium and was
physically abusive toward him before having
to be restrained.
According to both Besbris and James, UC-
Berkeley fans charged onto the field after the
game ended, engaged in hostile verbal attacks
and threw water bottles filled with dirt at the
Stanford side.
At this point, Besbris said in a
court deposition, Stanford fans also
tried to get onto the field when the
police, dressed in riot gear, began
sweeping the fans out of the stadium.
Besbris said she was pushed up
against the fence because of the
crowd pressing toward the field
when James approached her and
told her "Go home! Get home right
now! Go! You've got to go home
right now!"
She said she responded with "I
don't 'got' to go, but I'll leave. This is
selective enforcement, and you have
done nothing to restrain the Cal fans.
I will leave, and leave now, but I
think that the selective enforcement
is bull."
As Besbris was walking up the
stadium stairs, she said she heard
someone yell "Get her!"
"I was then kmxked down by two
policemen," Besbris said. At which
point, she told the officers not to
touch her, that she was a lawyer and

that they couldn't do this to her. Bes
bris again started walking to leave
the stadium, she said.
Besbris said that as soon as she
turned around, Deputy James
slapped her in the stomach, grabbed
her around her rib cage, gripped her
right arm, twisted it down behind her
back, twisted her wrist several times
outward and pinned it to her back.
"I was crying and asking 'what did
I do?'," Besbris said. "But all he said
was i'm going to run you in and teach
you a lesson you won't forget.'" All
the while, she said, he was twisting her
arm harder until she felt a severe
shooting pain from her elbow to her
fingertips nnd eventually heard a pop.
Although Besbris said he threat
ened to "throw (her) in jail," she said
he never made any attempts to arrest
her.
A friend of Besbris whom she had
called over for help was trying to talk
the officer into letting her go. Final
ly, she said, the officer threw her
against her friend with such as force
ful thrust that she bruised her eye on
her friend's collarbone.
Besbris went to the emergency
room at Stanford Hospital where the

doctor told her she had severe liga
ment damage and possibly tendon
damage. According to Besbris, her
muscles were ripped, and her entire
upper back, right arm and mid-back
were swollen and starting to bruise.
Some of the bones in her wrist were
fractured, and she had damage in her
elbow joint.
Besbris said she was unable to
work for two years, during which
time she was receiving constant
medical attention.
Besbris filed a complaint the next
morning and a lawsuit a few months
later.
She has since had surgery on her
right shoulder, but some of the dam
age in her wrist is permanent making
it difficult and sometimes impossible
to dress herself, she said.
"It is unbelievable to be beaten by
people who are supposed to protect
me," Besbris said.
However, James' account of the
incident conflicts with Besbris'. He
claims that as he was sweeping the
fans out of the stadium, he noticed
Besbris screaming that "nobody bet
ter touch" her, that she was a lawyer
and that she'd sue anyone who came

near her.
According to James, he told her,
"Lady, just move on out of this sec
tion before you get hurt." Then she
pushed herself against him and again
shouted, "I'm a lawyer, you don't
have any right to tell me to move."
In James' account he said Besbris
was intoxicated and highly emotion
al, thrashing her arms about and
shouting. He states that she commit
ted battery on him several times be
fore he grabbed her left arm, held to
her side and walked her up the
bleachers. He asserts that she strug
gled to get her arm loose, and he
pulled her left arm behind her back
and walked her up the stairs.
James' account throughout refers
to holding Besbris by her left arm
rather than her right arm, which was
the one injured.
He states that after taking a few
steps, she bent over and refused to
move further and slumped down to
her knees. He said he told her, "If
you don't keep moving, I'm going to
place you under arrest."
According to James, Besbris just
screamed back that she was going to
sue him, the University and every

one else involved. So he decided that
he would place her under arrest. He
said that he stopped short of arrest
ing her because her friend came and
asked if he would allow him to take
care of her.
Reluctant to release her, James
said he did so because he saw several
other "highly emotional spectators"
moving toward him and that no
other deputies were close enough to
assist him.
According to Besbris' lawyer,
Marvin Lewis, James had never had
field training in crowd control.
Lewis and Besbris also claim that
the University is "committing char
acter assassination" by portraying
her as a liar and mentally unstable.
Chief Marvin Herrington of the
Stanford Police Department did not
want to comment because the case is
going up for litigation.
James, who is still working at the
Stanford Police Department, could
not be reached for comment.
The trial is scheduled to begin to
morrow and is expected to last a
month, according to Lewis.
"We have a very strong case
against Stanford," Lewis said.
