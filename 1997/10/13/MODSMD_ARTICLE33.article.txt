hockey team dominated its match
against Pacific in every way possible
— except on the scoreboard.

FIELD HOCKEY

■ SATURDAY'S RESULT
Stanford 1, Pacific 0

Playing its first home game in five
weeks, the Cardinal knocked off Pa
cific by the deceptive score of 1-0.
Stanford (8-4, 3-0 NorPac) played
most of the match on UOP's (1-9,0-
3) end of the field, rattling off 28
shots on goal.
"We played really well," said
head coach Sheryl Johnson. "We
also tried several different things

that were really successful."
Despite getting off so many shots,
only one eluded Tiger goalkeeper Jo
celyn Castillo, who had 15 saves. Ju
nior forward Carey Cloyd finally
ended the scoreless draw in the 15th
minute of the second half to seal the
win.
"It was very frustrating that we
didn't score more," Johnson said.
"We had five or six close shots and
our defense played really well, al
though they weren't tested as much."
Indeed, UOP had so much to deal
with on its end of the field that the
Tigers were only able to get off one
shot on goal. Kelly Naylor officially
recorded no saves in her third con
secutive shutout.
"We did expect to dominate,"
said Johnson. "And in fact, we did."
Stanford has now run its winning
streak to five matches.
