# Prof, students mediate neighborhood dispute

### Jaime Adame 
A group of Stanford students, under the direction of
Human Biology lecturer Don Barr, canvassed the down
town Palo Alto neighborhood near First Presbyterian
Church Saturday to help resolve a conflict over a pro
posed evening meal for the homeless.
Urban Ministries of Palo Alto, a nonprofit organiza
tion, currently offers meals for the homeless six days a

week. Various churches in the Palo Alto area each host
one meal per week. First Presbyterian was planning to
serve a Wednesday meal from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.
According to Barr, some local residents voiced oppo
sition to the plan during a community meeting held Au
gust 26. They felt the church, a member of Urban Min
istries, overstepped its bounds by not speaking with local
residents before agreeing to the proposal.
Residents expressed safety concerns regarding the in

vitation of homeless people into their community.
The Rev. Diana Gibson, pastor of First Presbyterian,
said there will be people in eharge of making sure the
homeless people leave after the meal is over.
"I want to do what I can to be neighborly to those in
the church's area as well as those that are less fortunate,"
Gibson said.
