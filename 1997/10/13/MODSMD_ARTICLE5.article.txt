### Jaime Adame 
A group of Stanford students, under the direction of
Human Biology lecturer Don Barr, canvassed the down
town Palo Alto neighborhood near First Presbyterian
Church Saturday to help resolve a conflict over a pro
posed evening meal for the homeless.
Urban Ministries of Palo Alto, a nonprofit organiza
tion, currently offers meals for the homeless six days a

week. Various churches in the Palo Alto area each host
one meal per week. First Presbyterian was planning to
serve a Wednesday meal from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.
According to Barr, some local residents voiced oppo
sition to the plan during a community meeting held Au
gust 26. They felt the church, a member of Urban Min
istries, overstepped its bounds by not speaking with local
residents before agreeing to the proposal.
Residents expressed safety concerns regarding the in

vitation of homeless people into their community.
The Rev. Diana Gibson, pastor of First Presbyterian,
said there will be people in eharge of making sure the
homeless people leave after the meal is over.
"I want to do what I can to be neighborly to those in
the church's area as well as those that are less fortunate,"
Gibson said.
The church agreed to table the
proposal, and both groups sought
help from the University South
Neighborhood Group, an associa
tion of community members in cen
tral Palo Alto. Barr, a group mem
ber, agreed to act as a facilitator for
the discussion process.
"1 am definitely in favor of more
services for the homeless," said Barr.
"But I'm not taking either side. The
best situation is for the neighbor
hood and church to make a decision
based on accurate information."
Barr points out that, according to
Palo Alto police, there are no safety
problems where meals are currently
being served.
He planned to canvass the neigh
borhood to distribute informational
fliers and gather resident opinion be
fore reporting back to the neighbor
hood group.
Barr sent e-mail to students in

volved in Stanford Homelessness
Action Coalition and to those on the
Urban Studies Department mailing
list to solicit volunteers to go door to
door.
The students spent Saturday
morning speaking with residents
near churches already serving meals
and will soon interview those resi
dents near First Presbyterian, locat
ed at 114() Cowper St.
"The true point of the surveying
process is to replace the exaggerated
and distorted 'facts' concerning the
program," said freshman volunteer
Robert McNary.
The students receive no credit
and no money for their participa
tion.
"Personally, I'm thrilled just to
visit other parts of the city, as well
as other elements of the communi
ty. I can't help but gain perspective
on a project such as this," said Mc-
Nary.
The group will write a summary
report and participate in a communi
ty meeting Nov. 15 at the church.
