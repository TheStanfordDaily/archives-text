While many Stanford students
prepared for parties Friday night,
more than 200 people filled the
Oak Room inTresidder Union to
commemorate
1912 visit to Stanford.
Bah 3, held to be the perfect
exemplar of the Bah4'f faith,
brought a message of peace and
the unity of all nations to Stan
ford students. I"he Oak Room
celebration, said senior Shahla
Magh/.i, is "an opportunity to re
member and rekindle the vision
... of a unified world."
Since the mid-19405, members

celebrate Bah£'s visit.
This year, festivities started at
7:30 p.m. and included both music
and readings. A guitarist initially
drew people into the Oak Room.
Piano playing, singing and tradition
al chanting followed. A reception,
complete with four tables of food,
ended the program.
"There is always a very warm at
mosphere and lots of people from
different backgrounds," said Shauna
Bowden, a coterminal student.
Her description of the celebra
tion rang true. Participants ranged in
age from young children to senior
citizens, and the mix of races includ
ed Asian Americans, whites,
African Americans and Indians.
Clothing ranged from Fila tennis
shoes to Gucci loafers.

About 20 students are a part of
the Association at Stanford.
The students have Monday prayer
groups and Friday discussions every
week.
Campus activity is considered to
be especially important, said Chris
Baskett, Class of '96, because "on a
university campus, people are still
searching for truth, and that's a won
derful thing."
Also, the Bah£'i Youth Work
shop, an off-campus group that
seeks to show Bah£'i ideals through
performing arts, has made a point of
visiting Stanford. The group per
formed an anti-racism dance during
this year's New Student Orientation.
Much of the local work is
the result of a group effort. "We
work together as a community, as a
group — there's no older and no
younger," says Vida Bertrand, a lec
turer in French in the Continuing
Studies Program.

This group emphasis is a reflec
tion of Bahd'f teachings. The main
principle is the unity of
mankind, a flier from the group said.
The faith says that all reli
gions share a common foundation
and that all people are equal in
God's sight. The religion embraces
members of many faiths, the flier
said, and its believers read from the
sacred texts of several different reli
gions.
The message of unity has been
proven to be popular. Called the
newest of the world religions, ac
cording to the flier, the Bahti'i faith,
founded in Persia during the mid
19th century, now includes more
than 5 million people.
The religion has also
taken on some controversial world
issues, the flier said. The faith calls
for equality of races and gender, and
world peace is proclaimed to be crit
ical.
