# Loans for less
## Law students' loans cheapen 
### Bradley Heinz 
Law School students got a surprise this fall when they
made their usual applications for the mammoth private
loans many take out: Their loan origination fees plunged,
dropping to zero under one loan program.
In the past year, Frank Brucato, associate dean of ad
ministration for the Law School, persuaded several pri
vate lenders to begin making loans to students. In the
process, he caused a revolution in the once-cozy world of
student lending.
Private lenders base the rate for origination fees —
also known as points — on the default rate for students
under their programs. In the case of law students, lenders
saw their overall default rates rise to about 10 percent by
the early 19905, according to Brucato. After adding ad
ministrative fees, Brucato observed that it wasn't un
common to see a check issued to students for only $8,700
on a $10,(XK) loan, an up-front fee amounting to 13 per
cent.
"That rate at Stanford was ridiculous because our de
fault rate was much lower," said Brucato. In fact, he con
tends that Stanford students' overall private loan default
rate shouldn't rise much above 1 percent because pub
lished Figures for their government loans consistently
demonstrate default rates below I percent.
" The law students pushed us to make the school shop"
for better rates, said Brucato. He approached Wells
Fargo, Bank of America and some other big banks, but all
proved unreceptive.
ITien Rhett Thompson, vice president of service cen
ters at the Stanford Federal Credit Union, took a look at
the Law School's proposal. "I ,aw students were having to
pay outrageous loan fees to obtain loans from private
sources," Thompson said. "In most cases (these students]
had used up maximum loan amounts
and needed additional private
money to cover themselves until
graduation."
The credit union committed to a
new program, dropping origination
fees to 4 percent. According to
Thompson, the credit union has al
ready made loans in the amount of
$3 million to 250 law students.
Because of the new program,
Stanford law students were no
longer subsidizing lenders for the
high default rate at some other law
schools.
Soon Citibank, among other
lenders, jumped in with a pilot pro
gram to compete with the credit
union. Patricia Sutton, a Citibank
account manager, said someone
from Hastings College of Law
asked, "What are you guys giving
Stanford that we're not getting?"
after seeing an article about the new
loan program.

Because Stanford students
stopped participating in the tradi
tional programs, Thompson faced
criticism from some other law
schools and traditional lenders.
At one meeting with law school
aid administrators, Thompson re
calls, "They spent the first 10 min
utes berating 'one unnamed school
that only thinks about itself.' The
speaker said to the others,' Ihe rest
of you will have to pay more. I
mean it was like Chicken Little cry
ing, The sky is falling.'
Thompson noted that these ad
ministrators were preoccupied dur
ing lunch by plans for their upcoming
retreat to Scottsdale, Ariz., planning
to use funds, he added, that they may
have derived from the origination
fees paid by the students at their
schools.
Citibank has already made a vari
ation of the Law School loan pro
gram available to business students.
Brucato also expects the credit union
to approach the Graduate School of
Business and the School of Medicine
with a private loan program.
