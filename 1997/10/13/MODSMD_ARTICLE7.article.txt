# Loans for less
## Law students' loans cheapen 
### Bradley Heinz 
Law School students got a surprise this fall when they
made their usual applications for the mammoth private
loans many take out: Their loan origination fees plunged,
dropping to zero under one loan program.
In the past year, Frank Brucato, associate dean of ad
ministration for the Law School, persuaded several pri

process, he caused a revolution in the once-cozy world of
student lending.
Private lenders base the rate for origination fees —
also known as points — on the default rate for students
under their programs. In the case of law students, lenders
saw their overall default rates rise to about 10 percent by
the early 19905, according to Brucato. After adding ad
ministrative fees, Brucato observed that it wasn't un
common to see a check issued to students for only $8,700
on a $10,(XK) loan, an up-front fee amounting to 13 per
cent.
"That rate at Stanford was ridiculous because our de
fault rate was much lower," said Brucato. In fact, he con
tends that Stanford students' overall private loan default
rate shouldn't rise much above 1 percent because pub
lished Figures for their government loans consistently
demonstrate default rates below I percent.
" The law students pushed us to make the school shop"
for better rates, said Brucato. He approached Wells
Fargo, Bank of America and some other big banks, but all
proved unreceptive.
ITien Rhett Thompson, vice president of service cen

the Law School's proposal. "I ,aw students were having to
pay outrageous loan fees to obtain loans from private
sources," Thompson said. "In most cases (these students]
