SURPRISE!
YOUR FIRST UNOFFICIAL
COLLEGE EXAM.
(RELAX, IT'S TRUE OR FALSE.)
"Army ROTC" looks great on a student's resume.
(True ... Employers seek out graduating seniors who have leadership qualities. Army
ROTC students gain leadership experience and officer credentials which give them a
competitive edge for career success.)
If you take an Army ROTC class, you'll be committed to military service.
(False... You can take freshman and sophomore military science courses without obliga
tion.)
ROTC doesn't fit into your college schedule.
(False... Army ROTC courses are electives which fit into most degree programs. Students
usually take just one course each term, requiring only a few hours each week.)
Students who complete the Army ROTC program serve their country as Army Officers
after college.
(True... About half enter full-time active duty for 2to 4 years. Others pursue their civilian
careers right after college while serving part-time as Army Reserve or Army National
Guard officers in their communities.)
Students must travel to nearby universities to take ROTC through Stanford.
(False....The course is now offered on Stanford's campus - Wednesdays at 0800 and 1215,
Building 60, room 62 N.)
Now here's the "fill-in" portion of the exam. Fill in an Army ROTC elective on your course schedule.
You'll begin to acquire the discipline, self-confidence and leadership skills essential for your future success.
And you'll learn about opportunities for scholarships and other financial aid.
Just come to Building 60, Room 62 N on Wednesday from 0800-0900 or 1215-1315, or call 1 -800-227-ROTC
