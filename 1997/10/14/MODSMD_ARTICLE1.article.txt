# Back on the Farm
## Perry's path long, varied 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Staff writer 
A walk through William Perry's of
fice at Stanford's Center for Internation
al Security and Arms Control offers a
journey through his time as the 19th sec
retary of defense.
Over his desk hangs a map of the
world, cluttered with markers describing
the 221 locations in 67 countries that
Ferry visited during his three years as
secretary of defense.
Photographs of Perry smiling with
soldiers and political leaders decorate
the walls of the immaculate office. Here
is Perry eating Thanksgiving dinner with
troops in Macedonia or pinning medals
on U.S. soldiers in Bosnia.
Among the many political leaders
looking on from the photo gallery are
President Clinton, Vice President Al
Gore, Russian ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirnovskv, former Israeli Prime Minis

ter Yitzhak Rabin, former Secretary of
State Warren Christopher and the minis
ters of defense for Russia and Ukraine.
After leaving his teaching position at
Stanford in 1993 for Washington, DC.,
Perry is back on the Farm for good. In his
four years apart from his alma mater,
Perry served as deputy secretary of de
fense and secretary of defense.

As a professor, he holds a joint ap
pointment in the Institute for Interna
tional Studies and the Department of
Engineering-Economic Systems and
Operations Research.
This quarter Perry is teaching Engi
neering-Economic Systems and Opera
tions Research 194: "The Role of Tech
nology in National Security," a course he

created seven years ago.
Perry will also team-teach Political
Science 138: "International Security in
Changing World" next quarter. In the
spring, he will be offering a seminar deal
ing with selected topics from his upcom
ing book on international security.

Bill Perry, former secretary of defense and a professor in the Institute for International Studies, is enjoying his life back
on the Farm.
Tentatively titled "Preventive
Defense: A Security Strategy for
the 21st Century," Perry is co-au
thoring the book with I larvard Prof.
Ash Carter. It is scheduled to be
published before the end of 199 K.
After earning bachelor's and
master's degrees from Stanford and
a doctorate from Pennsylvania State
University — all in mathematics —
Perry started his business career as a
laboratory director for GTE.
Ten years later. Perry left GTE
to become founder and president of
ESL Inc., a defense electronics
company.
"The technical field we worked
on can be best described as marry
ing the radio to the computer," he
said. "Back in 1%4, when we start
ed the company, this was a pretty
revolutionary idea."
Perry's technical background
and his interest in national security
and defense prepared him well for
his first public title, undersecretary
of defense for research and engi
neering, in 1977.
"It was not a political job in any
ordinary sense of the word," Perry
stressed. "It was heavily technical;
it was like being the chief engineer
of the country."

Perry's tenure as undersecretary
of defense was marked by techno
logical innovation.
"It was a period that was rich
with new technologies bubbling
out, and we were applying them
then to our defense systems be
cause in those days we were trying
to compete with the Soviet Union,
which had military forces about
twice the size of ours," Perry said.
" The purpose of our defense
technological developments was to
offset the numerical advantage of
the Soviet Union; we called it the
'offset strategy.'"
One of the most remarkable
technical innovations of that period
was the development of the Inter
net — called ARPANE T after the
Advanced Research Projects
Agency, the Defense Department
branch that created the network.
"It was just used by defense sci
entists," Perry said. "The idea that
it would come in people's homes
had not really dawned on people in
the 19705; that was a much later
idea."
Perry's academic career re
sumed in 19NK when he came to
Stanford as a part-time professor in
the Engineering-Economic Sys
tems Department and co-director
of the Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control.
Although Perry planned on

making Stanford a more perma
nent home, he was summoned to
serve as deputy secretary of defense
in 1993; he assumed the position of
secretary of defense a year later.
By this time, the Cold War had
ended and the policy of deterrence
Perry practiced as undersecretary
gave way to preventive tactics.
"Our defense today should be
focused on preventing dangerous
situations from becoming threats,"
Perry said. "I call that preventive
defense — things you can do to cre
ate the conditions for peace, there
by minimizing the risk that a mili
tary outbreak would get started."
The most challenging aspect of
his position is knowing how and
when to deploy forces, Perry said.
"A mission that a secretary of
defense must keep as a top priority
at all times is getting right the use of
military force," Perry said, ham
mering his fist on the desk. "You
use your force judiciously where it
can keep peace instead of provoca
tively where it can stimulate con
flict."
Perry stressed that he took this
responsibility very personally.
"As we had casualties, I went to
meet with the families," he said.
"This was a very personal aspect of
the job."
Perry also took the opportunity
to apply his business skills to his du

ties by streamlining the Pentagon's
purchasing process.
"It cost us twice as much as it
should have cost us to buy things,"
he said. "I think that we should now
see dramatic reductions in cost and
inefficiency."
Back at Stanford, Perry contin
ues to be actively involved in inter
national security affairs. He is
spearheading the Preventive De
fense Project — a joint effort of the
Center for International Security
and Arms Control and Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government —
and takes frequent trips abroad to
maintain relationships with defense
leaders of countries such as China
and Russia.
Perry also continues his active
involvement in the business com
munity by serving on the boards of
United Technologies, Hambrecht
& Quist and several smaller high
tech companies.
When he is not involved in his
academic or business pursuits,
Perry enjoys music, drama and the
outdoors.
Perry, who recently turned 70,
confessed he used to play piano in
high school, but he doesn't expect
to be performing in public in the
near future.
"I haven't played for other peo
ple in a long time," he said with a
smile, "and my fingers got rusty."
