# Back on the Farm
## Perry's path long, varied 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Staff writer 
A walk through William Perry's of
fice at Stanford's Center for Internation
al Security and Arms Control offers a
journey through his time as the 19th sec
retary of defense.
Over his desk hangs a map of the
world, cluttered with markers describing
the 221 locations in 67 countries that
Ferry visited during his three years as
secretary of defense.
Photographs of Perry smiling with
soldiers and political leaders decorate
the walls of the immaculate office. Here
is Perry eating Thanksgiving dinner with
troops in Macedonia or pinning medals
on U.S. soldiers in Bosnia.
Among the many political leaders
looking on from the photo gallery are
President Clinton, Vice President Al
Gore, Russian ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirnovskv, former Israeli Prime Minis

ter Yitzhak Rabin, former Secretary of
State Warren Christopher and the minis
ters of defense for Russia and Ukraine.
After leaving his teaching position at
Stanford in 1993 for Washington, DC.,
Perry is back on the Farm for good. In his
four years apart from his alma mater,
Perry served as deputy secretary of de
fense and secretary of defense.

As a professor, he holds a joint ap
pointment in the Institute for Interna
tional Studies and the Department of
Engineering-Economic Systems and
Operations Research.
This quarter Perry is teaching Engi
neering-Economic Systems and Opera
tions Research 194: "The Role of Tech
nology in National Security," a course he

created seven years ago.
Perry will also team-teach Political
Science 138: "International Security in
Changing World" next quarter. In the
spring, he will be offering a seminar deal
ing with selected topics from his upcom
ing book on international security.
