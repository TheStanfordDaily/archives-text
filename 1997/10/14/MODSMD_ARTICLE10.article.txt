## Crash kills Denver 
### 
PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP)
— With such 1970s hits as "Rocky
Mountain High," "Sunshine on My
Shoulders" and "Take Me Home.
Country Roads." John Denver was
a wholesome, wire-rimmed hippie
who turned out sunny music for
cynical times.
In the end. he died in a setting
straight out of his music, soaring
over the mountains, sea and sky
before his experimental plane
plunged Sunday into picturesque
Monterey Bay. He was 53.
Denver's single-engine, Y

shaped. Long EZ plane crashed
during the afternoon in the choppy
waters just offshore. His hodv was
badly mangled, and his identity was
confirmed yesterday with finger
prints sent from Colorado.
"John Denver's Greatest Hits" in
1973 is still one of the biggest-sell
ing albums in the history ol RCA
Records, with worldwide sales of
more than 10 million copies.
In 1985, he toured the Soviet
Union in the first performances by
an American artist since the sus
pension of cultural exchanges
between the United States and the
communist power. Similarly, he was
the first artist from the West to do a
multi-city tour of China, in 1992,
and Vietnam in 1994.
"Music does bring people
together," Denver said. "People
everywhere are the same in heart
and spirit. No matter what language
we speak, what color we are, the
form of our politics or the expres
sion of our love and our faith, music
proves: We are the same."
The twice-divorced Denver is
survived by a son, Zaehary, and
daughter, Anna Kate, from his first
marriage; his second wife, Cassan
dra Delaney; their daughter, Jesse
Belle; a brother; and his mother.
