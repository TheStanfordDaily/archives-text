â€” A bus carrying nearly 50 senior citizens on a
Thanksgiving Day trip to view the turning of
the seasons plunged into a ravine yesterday in
central Quebec, killing 43 people.
Quebec provincial police said the accident

took place in the afternoon about 60 miles
northeast of Quebec City. The bus was travel
ing on I lighway I3S and crashed at the bottom
of a steep hill heading into a hard right curve.
Real Ouellette, a Quebec provincial police
spokesman, said faulty brakes were the likely

cause of the tragedy, which killed 43 of the 4X
people aboard. I here were no skid marks at the
bottom of the dangerous hill.
I he live survivors were taken to hospitals in
nearby La Malbaie and Baie-St.-Paul. Michelle
Robitaille, a spokeswoman for the Charlevoix
Hospital Center in Haie-St.-Paul, told Ihe
Associated Press that five injured people were
brought there in critical condition and four of
them were transferred to a trauma center in
Quebec City.
Yesterday's crash was the deadliest in ( ana
da in recent memory. The passengers, who
belonged to a senior citizens club in the Beauce
region southeast of Quebec City, were on an
outing for Canada's I'hanksgiving holiday,
Ouellet said.
Conditions on the twisting road were dry
and the weather was sunny. The hill has a steep
grade and is marked by warning signs.
Andre Castonguay, a witness who arrived
shortly after the accident, said there was a (>()
foot drop from the highway to the spot where
the Mercier bus landed.
"1 looked out the window and saw the bus,"
he said. "It didn't make the turn and it fell into
the hole."
At the scene, emergency workers and passers
bv helped shuttle bodies from the bus, which was
propped on its side in the ravine between the hill
and an elevated length of railroad track that
straddles a tributary of the St. I .awrcncc.
A accident at the same location took 15
lives. I hat accident was apparently caused bv
engine trouble.
