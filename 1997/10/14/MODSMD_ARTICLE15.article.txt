## Editorial Increase weekend hours End library woes 
### 
Tin-: SCENH IS a familiar one for
those of us who have been there. It is
9 p.m. on Saturday night in Meyer
Library and soon after the lights blink, stu
dents still plugging through their course
readers and problem sets herd into the "24-
hour study room."
There we spend the rest of the evening
packed like sardines.
Many of the latecomers who arrive after
9 p.m. have no choice but to return to their
dorms as typically there are no seats avail
able.
And this scene does not occur solely on
Saturday night.
It is also a problem on Friday evenings
when both Meyer and Green Libraries
close at 6 p.m. and on Sunday morning
when neither library opens prior to noon.
As much as Stanford may seem a laid
back place where the horses graze and stu
dents party, studying during the weekend is
a necessary fact of life for most students on
the Farm.
But the lack of sufficient library hours
can make studying on weekends a hassle
for students.
This is especially true toward the middle
and end of the quarter, as midterms, papers
and finals start to pile up, and increasing
numbers of students study late into the
night on Friday and Saturday or wake-up
early in the morning to get started on their
work.
While perhaps the dearth of evening,
late night and early morning library hours
was designed to encourage students to
relax and enjoy their weekends, the reality
is that Stanford students are extremely busy
people who occasionally have no choice but
to study on Friday night.
And there are a variety of problems that
emerge when a convenient library hide-out
other than the Meyer 24-hour study room is
not available.
First of all. it doesn't seem fair that stu
dents who need to study on Friday and Sat
urday nights should be placed in the awk

ward position of having to ask their hall
matcs to turn down their stereos and their
roommates to go out with their friends.
Moreover, no one wants to be stuck with
hooks to read in a dorm that is hosting a
Saturday night party.
Indeed, most students respect the fact
that others may want to relax and have fun
in the dorms on weekend evenings.
Providing a quiet, comfortable library
space for those who have to study would be
an alternative to the often noisy weekend
dorm scene; this alternative should meet
the needs of both students interested in
studying and those interested in relaxing.
An additional reason for extending
library hours is that the perennial lack of
space in the Meyer 24-hour study will like
ly be magnified this year because many
dorm study rooms were converted into
student rooms to resolve the housing
crunch.
In the past, dorm study rooms have
served as alternatives to the 24-hour study
room.
As there is a demonstrable need for
longer weekend library hours, ii is time to
increase library hours and render the tradi
tional competition to stake out a spot in the
Meyer 24-hour study room an experience
of the past.
Increasing the weekend hours at one or
both of the libraries doesn't necessarily
require a significant increase in operating
costs or personnel.
Circulation doesn't have to be open dur
ing all library hours; students simply need
some more quiet space to study, so that
they aren't forced to study next door to a
party or to be packed elbow to elbow in one
room.
While the subtle encouragement to take
weekend evenings off that is provided by
the current library hours may be well inten
tioncd, more often than not, closing the
libraries results in inconveniencing those
students who really need the quiet space
the most.
