## Technofreaks vs. Technophobes

\/V/ would the
▼ ▼ Ancient
Greeks think of the World
Wide Web?" my friend
asked, with his best
wannabe Thinker pose.
I don't know. And
I'm not sure it really mat-

ters too much to us. But given the existence
of our real and "nourishing" tecnnoage, a
better question is: "What should we think
about the Web?" (And about the rest of
computer technology, for that matter.)
Posed with this question, people usually
respond with glorification or scorn.
Being in Silicon Valley, Stanford people
usually have some affinity for computers.
One need look no further than the always
crowded CS 106 classes that are taken by
about two-thirds of information-hungry
Stanford undergraduates.
Computer supporters argue that comput
ers allow us to be more efficient, learn more
and communicate better. Plus, they might
ask: Can you imagine having to once again
write term papers with a typewriter while
under the influence of liquid paper vapors?
Also, some proponents say that human
contact is actually improved via e-mail and
chat lines that are filled with Internet lovers
(for example, see those cheesy Internet
commercials on TV).
And a techno supporter might finish his
or her supportive declaration by excitingly
(and sometimes maniacally) looking
toward the future and the "THINGS YET

TO COME."
Technophobes, on the other hand, have
heard all of these arguments and remain
defiantly against most or all of the pro
claimed benefits. Some will philosophize
about the dependency of people upon the
"machine," possibly citing examples such as
the potential disaster to come when our com
puters crash at the turn of the millennium.
Others concentrate on the dehumanizing
effects. And for those of us who have
overused e-mail or been obsessively captivat
ed by the Web, we have some personal
understanding of these impacts.
For instance, the technophobes will
point out that many don't call Mom any
more, but just send bits of information in
the form of an e-mail message. Or, they will
point toward web nerds who spend eight
hours a day on the net feverishly scoping
out everything from pornographic material
to vacation spots that they'll never reach.
As for efficiency, the technophobes
scream: "SO WHAT? This so-called effi
ciency also very efficiently burns your soul!"
My claim is that all of the above
responses are informative but insufficient
because they fail to kx)k at how the user
responds to the cyberworld. If we were to
shift our frames of reference, we might see
that the potential benefits or pitfalls of
computer technology lie within the individ
ual alone.
Computer technology can be helpful to
our lives. But in interacting with the com
puter, some act in weakness, allowing them
selves to be consumed by the computer

beast (e.g. the Web fanatic). This is the
point when many technophobes begin to
fear the computer.
And their fear grows when they look at
those who respond to the computer by
almost demonically striving to become a
part of the beast — yes, like Bill Gates.
What's interesting is that Billy's often bla
tant and sometimes subtle locus on his own
sense of "power" has turned its ugly head
on him — producing yet another victim of
the beast.
For example, in a Time article, he
acknowledged that he doesn't go to church
because it isn't "efficient." This point isn't
to judge whether one should go to church,
but instead, it demonstrates how he makes
his decisions: by coldly judging something
(and probably someone) because it's unser
viceable.
My point, thus, is that the cyberworld, as
with much of the world, is not an inherent
evil or good. It is a part of our lives that can
be manifested as a merely useful tool or
self-destroying monster, depending upon
how we react to it.
Completely denouncing or completely
praising it does not allow one to reach an
understanding of how to be a part of the
cyberworld without seeing that world
become hell. And if we can't strive for this
understanding, then we're not fully human
anyway.

neering, insists that he wrote this with a
chisel and stone, not Microsoft Word.
