Suggestion for

There is a difference between "irrever

Instead of "irreveient and funny" how
about becoming clever and witty?

Eliminate all anti-
Catholic, anti-Irish
elements of Stanford
I would like to applaud the Stanford
administration's thoughtful and sensitive
handling of the Notre Dame half-time
show crisis. I'hc Band's behavior clearly
lacked proper discretion and warranted
punishment

Hut in this moment of heightened
awareness the administration should act
further in expunging anti-Catholic and
anti-Irish sentiments that have been woven
into the fabric of this University's curricu
lum.
For years now such vituperative works
as Dante's "Inferno" and Joyce's "Ulysses"
have been taught in Stanford's classrooms,
and it is time that these works be eliminat
ed from the curriculum altogether.
I would furthermore add that Notre
Dame's poorly recruited, poorly coached
and undoubtedly underfunded team
entered the game at a paltry 1-3. and that
Stanford's demolition of the Irish under
those circumstances crossed the boundary
of civil behavior.
One can only imagine the hurt feelings
of Notre Dame loyalists after last. Satur
day's debacle.
Athletic Director Ted I.eland should
therefore ponder the only enlightened
alternative: forfeiting the win to the Irish.

I am shocked and dismayed that the
Stanford Daily would publish the heretical
ranting of Vanessa Bartsch.
Her reaction to the"truth" about Jim
sounds like something out of a 1 c >s()s gov
ernment film about the evils of sex and the
danger of venereal disease.
Vanessa seems to have missed some of
the social advances resulting from the sexual
revolution a few decades ago. It's OK for
people to have sex. Even nice people have
sex.
Contraception is not the responsibility
of women or something that you should
think of only at the last minute. It is a
GOOD thing that Jim has rubbers. Maybe
he has had them for a long time, maybe he
wanted to save money by buying the bulk

pack.
Having six rubbers does not make him a
disco-dancing-porn-watching-wife-swap
ping-swinger (can you even buy one con
dom? and why would you?). Jim is simply
a normal, responsible male doing what he
was told to do in Boy Scouts.
Perhaps I 'm not familiar with Vanessa
Bartsch's circle of friends and their moral
standards.
Perhaps I missed the part of her article
explaining how she met her potential
boyfriend Jim in the front pew at church
and was so impressed by his plans to go to
seminary. Or maybe I'm not aware that he
came with a letter from the Pope certifying
his spiritual purity.
Or maybe Vanessa just stepped out of a
time machine from Victorian England
(more likely Mayberry).
Vanessa's view toward sex is both
unhealthy and unwise. Having sex or pos
sessing condoms should never be consid
ered a "dark secret."

Sex education and condoms don't cause
unwanted pregnancy or STDs, ignorance
does.
What I fear is that many Stanford stu
dents will not have any problem with this
article, or worse, that responsible guvs will
get rid of their rubbers fearing public
embarrassment.
Unfortunately, many Stanford students
come from uptight, whitebread families and
experience nothing different when they
come to this uptight, whitebread school.
Consider that the article was written
by a junior. I might expect a freshman to
be so small-minded, but a junior should
have had some contact with more liberal
views.
Unfortunately the staff of The Daily, by
publishing Vanessa's article, is willing to
further the reactionary puritanical values
that are making America into a fascist PC
theocracy.
