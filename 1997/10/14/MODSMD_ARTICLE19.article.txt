## Kelly Young The 						stiff upper lip: keeping PDE's in-check

"I like you. You smile a lot. See the Rus
sians. I hey don 7 smile when they walk.
They are always angry, and I don't know
why."
— my 11-year-old host sister Natasha.
SOME OF MY friends here were kind
enough to inform me that I only have
three major emotions — very happy,
sad and very, very sad. Apparently, there is
very little in between.
1 think this was their way of telling me I
tend to be moody, but then again, I could be
wrong.
They proceeded to inform me that the
range of my three emotions increases expo
nentially with the amount of caffeine and
alcohol I consume. I might add that my con
sumption of those said beverages has
increased dramatically since arriving in
Moscow.
When I experience such strong emotions
(limited though they may be), I feel the
need to express them. I'm horrible at keep
ing things bottled up. I guess I'm rather
American in that way.

We like to show the world how we're
feeling. We walk tall. We smile a friendly
hello to passers-by. In Nebraska, we even
wave to random cars we pass on the high
way. Well, I'm in the wrong country for that
sort of thing.
In Russia, there is a sharp distinction
between one's public and private lives. Very
few people dare to cross that line. This tra
dition goes back for centuries, and the peo
ple are not about to change just because
some American student likes to be emo
tional.
Don't get me wrong. In the privacy of
their homes, Russians can be very cordial
and even jocular. When I first arrived in
Moscow, I was greeted very warmly by my
host family.
After realizing our communication was
limited, my host father opened the refriger
ator. pointed to food and said the English
words for everything. I, in turn, attempted
to say their Russian equivalents, and we
laughed.
Although this bizarre introduction to the
Russian home and refrigerator made me a
little more comfortable around my family, it

did not prepare me for the emotional perils
that awaited me.
Outside, it's a completely different
world.
1 spend a minimum of two hours every
day commuting on the Metro. It can be a
fairly somber journey. No one smiles; no
one laughs. If you are incredibly lucky, you
can hear one person whisper to another.
While the Russian youth are busy creating a
sexual revolution on the Metro, the mem
bers of the older generation scorn on any
form of PI)E (Public Display of Emotion).
Because they are few and far between,
PDEs here seem to affect me much more
strongly than they would in the States. The
old women singing passionately in the sta
tions. .. the string ensemble playing Mozart
near the Bolshoi... the little girl smiling
from her seat across from me. Little things
like these still give me chills.
L ike my moods, PDE's are not always
"very happy". 1 once saw a woman cry in
public, and it was incredibly hard to watch.
She made every effort to hide her pain.
With one of her broad hands, she guarded
her plastic Marlboro bag. With the other.

she covered her teary eyes with a handker
chief as she occasionally gasped for air in
silence.
Everyone diverted his/her eyes so as not
to witness this PDE. Feeling uncomfort
able, I too resorted to watching her through
the reflection of the window.
Needless to say, adjusting to the essen
tially stone-faced public life of Moscow has
not been easy for me.
During my first week here, 1 laughed
openly on the Metro at some comment my
friend made. After I was shushed by mv
friends, an old Russian man turned to me
and said, "Russian women don't do that."
As you can imagine, I felt about as big as
a Russian Big Mac (think starved Ukrainian
cow).
From that point on, whenever I acciden
tally slipped into my PDE mode, I felt like I
was trapped in some bad sitcom. The lead
actress (me) does something stupid (giggles
because she remembers a joke from earlier
in the day) and the extras (all of the old
women sitting on the opposite side of the
Metro car) just stare blankly at her. Pause
for effect. Cue canned laughter.

After three weeks here, the canned
laughter is less hequenl. I've stalled to
catch myself before a 1*1)1-' manifests itscll
Like the Russians, I hotlle up m\ emotions
(all three of them) and pop the coik iMils
when I've reached the confines of school,
my apartment or a noisy club
When I'm by myself, I don't smile on the
Metro. In fact, I've begun to develop fiovsn
lines from my newly acquired stone face.
I no longer linger near the awe inspiiing
sculptures in the Metro stations I keep niv
head down and avoid eye contact with otli
ers at all costs.
I'm rather proud of myself My haul
work has started to pay off. I no longer }•< t
harassed by drunken old men, the old
women's stares aren't neailv as frequent
and people occasionally ask me foi dim
lions. I may not know what I'm doing yet,
but at least I look like I do. I almost teel like
a Russian. Almost.

After three weeks here, the canned
laughter is less hequenl. I've stalled to
catch myself before a 1*1)1-' manifests itscll
Like the Russians, I hotlle up m\ emotions
(all three of them) and pop the coik iMils
when I've reached the confines of school,
my apartment or a noisy club
When I'm by myself, I don't smile on the
Metro. In fact, I've begun to develop fiovsn
lines from my newly acquired stone face.
I no longer linger near the awe inspiiing
sculptures in the Metro stations I keep niv
head down and avoid eye contact with otli
ers at all costs.
I'm rather proud of myself My haul
work has started to pay off. I no longer }•< t
harassed by drunken old men, the old
women's stares aren't neailv as frequent
and people occasionally ask me foi dim
lions. I may not know what I'm doing yet,
but at least I look like I do. I almost teel like
a Russian. Almost.
