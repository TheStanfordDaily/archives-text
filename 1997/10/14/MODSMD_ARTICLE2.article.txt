# Fire, ambulance unions endorse University plan
## 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Three major emergency and transportation
service providers yesterday announced their
public support for Stanford's plan to widen
Sand Hill Road.
Representatives of Stanford Hospital's pri
mary ambulance contractor and local fire fight
ers and bus workers unions decried a alternate
measure's proposed third lane for ambulance
and bus use at a press conference arranged by
the University.
Stanford hopes Palo Alto voters will pass
Measure O Nov. 4, allowing Sand Hill and
Quarry Roads to be widened to four lanes. The
University also plans to build two new housing
complexes off Sand Hill and to extend the Stan
ford Shopping Center.
Opponents of Measure O have countered

with their own Measure M, which restricts Sand
Hill to three lanes â€” the third for special use.
Measure O advocates yesterday claimed
any use of a middle lane would increase the risk
of accidents on Sand Hill, while four lanes
would minimize travel time to the hospital's
emergency room.
"It will fix a long-standing problem and pro
vide alternate routes to Stanford Hospital if
traffic is at a standstill," said Wayne Davis, di
rector of operations for American Medical Re
sponse, which delivers about 75 patients each
week to the hospital.
Currently, Davis said ambulance drivers
often take alternate routes to avoid Sand I lill
traffic.
Tony Spitaleri, president of the Palo Alto
Professional Fire Fighters, said the group's
seven-member executive committee
was motivated to support Measure O
partly due to statements made by
Measure M proponents that a third
lane will improve emergency ser
vices on Sand Hill.
"It's dangerous, it's misleading,
and it could cost lives," Spitaleri said.
"Measure M keeps the traffic jam
the way it is."
The Palo Alto Fire Department
responds to about five medical emer
gencies each day, Spitaleri said.
A plan to use Ihe third lane for
public transportation is also ineffec

tive because it forces buses to con
stantly merge out of and back into
trafficked lanes to make stops, said
Noah Banks, safety committee chair
for the local bus union.
Banks, who drives buses into
Stanford Shopping Center's parking
lot daily, said Measure O will reduce
the danger of buses hitting cars and
pedestrians in the shopping center's
lot.
"We urge the passage of Measure
O," he said. "It's the best and will
work with everyone."
Spitaleri and Davis both wrote
public letters to Palo Alto residents
supporting the passage of Measure
O and opposing Measure M. For
Measure O to succeed, it must re

ccive both a majority and more votes
than Measure M.
Measure M supporters, waiting
for reporters after the press confer
ence, said a goal of the third lane Ls to
urge people to take public trans
portation by parking their cars off In
terstate 280 to avoid the traffic. The
additional faculty / staff and senior
housing will only compound the traf
fic problem, said Peter Drekmeier,
campaign manager for Measure M.
"We want to build projects in
ways that don't increase traffic,"
Drekmeier said.
Labeling the press conference
"strictly a public-relations tactic,"
Drekmeier said, "Our feeling is that
Stanford is getting desperate."
