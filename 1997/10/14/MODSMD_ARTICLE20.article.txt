# Registrar considers additions to transcript

More changes may still lie ahead for under
graduate transcripts.
Last fall, students' minors were recorded on
transcripts for the first time. Now, the Registrar's
()ffice is considering a reformatted transcript that
would include full course titles. And some stu
dents are requesting that certain awards be listed
as well.
"Currently, only University awards, such as
graduating with honors in a major or graduating
with distinction, are listed on the transcript," said
University Registrar Roger Printup.
Recognition of non-University awards — in
cluding Gardner, Rhodes, Marshall, Fulbright
and Truman scholarships, dean's awards or mem-

bcrship in Phi Beta Kappa — is absent from the
transcript. Printup said the ASSU Senate has
been charged with creating a list of awards to be
included on the transcript.
A bill passed by the senate last October called
for student involvement in the transcript refor
matting process. ASSU President Emily Andrus
said the Faculty Senate's Committee on Academ
ic Appraisal and Achievement is expected to re
port on the proposal within the next month and
that she will meet with Printup soon to discuss the
issue.
"This is an issue everyone can agree on," An
drus said. "Something as simple as listing full
course titles can be a real service to students when
they meet with potential employers or other
schools."

Under the current system, course names are
limited to 18characters, often forcing longer titles
to be abbreviated.
Hut students shouldn't hold out hope for full
course titles during the next few years, Printup
said.
" That is a bigger task than you might imag
ine," he said, "since course titles appear on so
many different computer screens and reports, in
addition to appearing on the transcript.
Not all students have a problem with the tran
script format
"Even though many course titles and awards
aren't listed on a transcript, students can usually
include such information on their resumes,"
noted senior Betty Pang, the head advising associ
ate in Otero.
