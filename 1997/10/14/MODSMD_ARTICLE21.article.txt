## Bobby Clark's emphasis on team play is paying off for men's soccer 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
What makes coaching soccer at Stanford
easy, Bobby Clark says, is that the players like
to think.
With that understanding, the Cardinal
men's head coach has developed a form of play
that requires intense concentration and a lot of
thought. The strategy has paid off in the form of
an unbeaten record. Since last October, the
team has failed to win a game only twice: a pair
of 0-0 double-overtime ties.
Stanford men's soccer (10-0-2, 2-0-1 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) has been steadi
ly earning hi.her rankings andmcrensnec.

He brought to the West Coast a style of play
that led him to an 82-42-13 record at Dart
mouth, where he coached from 1985 to 1994.
Clark coaches his team for zone play, rather
than man-to-man defense and offense. Because
no player is assigned to a specific opponent,
everyone is forced to consider each situation as
it arises and see where more coverage is need
ed.
» "I always feel the man-to-man (play) comes
down to the better athletes," Clark said.
"Zones are all about keeping your shape. It's
about thinking. The athletes we get here at
Stanford like to think."
That strategy, combined with an emphasis

on teamwork and a clean and simple style of
play, has pushed the Cardinal to a No. 6 nation
al ranking — the program's highest ranking
ever.
In 12 games since Sept. 2, Stanford has left
most of its opponents in the dust. C )nly two have
so much as scored — San Jose State in the sea
son opener and Chico State — and each only
earned one goal. Cardinal goalkeeper Adam
Zapala's .16 goals-against average is tops in the
nation.
While Zapala, who has recorded 28 saves,
keeps balls out of the Stanford net, his team
mates have been busy scoring at the other end
of the field.
Nine different playcis have scored at least
fitnggoSu Ibis season, led by junior forward A.J.
Sauer with six.
Freshman forward Corey Wool folk joined
the Stanford team as Michigan's Player of the
Year and has notched three points, same as an
other newcomer, junior midfielder Simon El
liott, a transfer from Victoria University in New
Zealand.
Sophomore forward Brandon Garinger, se
nior midfielder Erik Morrison and junior mid
fielder Eric Vandevelde each have two goals,
and junior forward Adam Siegman, junior mid
fielder Jamie Clark and sophomore defender
Andy Hemmerich have one apiece.

The combined power of those
nine players means Stanford has
scored 10 times more points than its
opponents. The Cardinal's 21
points have come in 148 shots on
goal, compared to 109 by its oppo
nents.
Stanford has had more shots on
goal than its opponents in all but a
handful of games this season. And
the defense, led by sophomore Ger
ard Davis and senior Dan Wytock,
has kept the ball away from Zapala
more often than not.
Clark is pleased that the Cardi
nal's success has come honestly and
cleanly. Stanford players have been
hit with just six yellow cards this sea
son, compared with their oppo

nents' 16.
"I want them to just play honest,
straightforward soccer ... play for
each other and for the team," Clark
said.
Part of being honest, he added, is
not showing off.
"Good teams and good players
do everything very simply," he ex
plained. "The hard thing is to do it
simply and make it look simple.
Everything tries to complicate it."
Photographs and coverage of
games often highlight fancy moves,
Clark said, "but if you look at good
players, they always seem to have so
much time Ninety percent of the
work on the field is playing very sim
ple stuff and making good deci
sions."
Good decisions are important in
zone play, when each player has to
be aware of not just one opponent.

but every man on the field.
"Where the ball is. we should al
ways have two men. Clark said.
"Where we want to put pressure, we
should have two men. You're never
left alone.
"That's what 1 like about zones.
People have to share responsibility."
Zone play allows the Cardinal to
control both offense and defense.
Clark called it "a good way to dictate
to the other team even when you
don't have the ball."
Each opponent's possession is
looked at not as a lost ball but a ball
only one or two passes away from
returning to the Cardinal, Clark
said.
"If we get the act together, we'll
get it back," he said "It you can use
your transition well, it can be one of
the best weapons you have in your
team armory."
