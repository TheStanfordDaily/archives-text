## Bobby Clark's emphasis on team play is paying off for men's soccer 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
What makes coaching soccer at Stanford
easy, Bobby Clark says, is that the players like
to think.
With that understanding, the Cardinal
men's head coach has developed a form of play
that requires intense concentration and a lot of
thought. The strategy has paid off in the form of
an unbeaten record. Since last October, the
team has failed to win a game only twice: a pair
of 0-0 double-overtime ties.
Stanford men's soccer (10-0-2, 2-0-1 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) has been steadi

He brought to the West Coast a style of play
that led him to an 82-42-13 record at Dart
mouth, where he coached from 1985 to 1994.
Clark coaches his team for zone play, rather
than man-to-man defense and offense. Because
no player is assigned to a specific opponent,
everyone is forced to consider each situation as
it arises and see where more coverage is need
ed.
» "I always feel the man-to-man (play) comes
down to the better athletes," Clark said.
"Zones are all about keeping your shape. It's
about thinking. The athletes we get here at
Stanford like to think."
That strategy, combined with an emphasis

on teamwork and a clean and simple style of
play, has pushed the Cardinal to a No. 6 nation
al ranking — the program's highest ranking
ever.
In 12 games since Sept. 2, Stanford has left
most of its opponents in the dust. C )nly two have
so much as scored — San Jose State in the sea
son opener and Chico State — and each only
earned one goal. Cardinal goalkeeper Adam
Zapala's .16 goals-against average is tops in the
nation.
While Zapala, who has recorded 28 saves,
keeps balls out of the Stanford net, his team
mates have been busy scoring at the other end
of the field.
Nine different playcis have scored at least
fitnggoSu Ibis season, led by junior forward A.J.
Sauer with six.
Freshman forward Corey Wool folk joined
the Stanford team as Michigan's Player of the
Year and has notched three points, same as an
other newcomer, junior midfielder Simon El
liott, a transfer from Victoria University in New
Zealand.
Sophomore forward Brandon Garinger, se
nior midfielder Erik Morrison and junior mid
fielder Eric Vandevelde each have two goals,
and junior forward Adam Siegman, junior mid
fielder Jamie Clark and sophomore defender
Andy Hemmerich have one apiece.
