That's because for the past three
years, the Bryan twins have received
wild card berths into the main draw
of the U.S. Open.
In their first year at the Open,
competing against professionals,
they were in awe of the environ
ment. But the Bryans have since
grown accustomed to the huge
crowds and top-ranked players.
"The first year we were there,
everyone thought we were ball
boys," Bob Bryan said. "We were
afraid to kick players off the practice
courts. You're 17 years old and in
timidated by the top players, and
you might be kicking Andre Agassi
off the court."

"We didn't feel worthy," Mike
said.
"But then you get to know the
ropes and know the system, so
everything starts to go more smooth
ly," Boh said. "We used to spend all
day watching matches and come
back exhausted, but we know better
now. We save energy because we
just practice and get out of there."
Last year at the U.S. Open junior
tournament. Mike and Bob won the
boys' 18-and-under doubles title.
Their first two U.S. Open wild
cards came from winning the boys'
18-and-under national title. They
earned this year's wild card from
their spectacular performances at
professional tournaments prior to
the U.S. Open. The Bryans earned
wins over high-ranking doubles
teams in major tournaments around
the country.
"We had good wins in all our
tournaments," Mike said, "and our
losses were in three sets against good
teams, so the USTA gave us a wild
card into the U.S. Open."
The Bryans prepared for the
Open by playing several major tour
naments. including the ATP Cham
pionships in Cincinnati and the
