onships in Austin. Tex.

That's because for the past three
years, the Bryan twins have received
wild card berths into the main draw
of the U.S. Open.
In their first year at the Open,
competing against professionals,
they were in awe of the environ
ment. But the Bryans have since
grown accustomed to the huge
crowds and top-ranked players.
"The first year we were there,
everyone thought we were ball
boys," Bob Bryan said. "We were
afraid to kick players off the practice
courts. You're 17 years old and in
timidated by the top players, and
you might be kicking Andre Agassi
off the court."

"We didn't feel worthy," Mike
said.
"But then you get to know the
ropes and know the system, so
everything starts to go more smooth
ly," Boh said. "We used to spend all
day watching matches and come
back exhausted, but we know better
now. We save energy because we
just practice and get out of there."
Last year at the U.S. Open junior
tournament. Mike and Bob won the
boys' 18-and-under doubles title.
Their first two U.S. Open wild
cards came from winning the boys'
18-and-under national title. They
earned this year's wild card from
their spectacular performances at
professional tournaments prior to
the U.S. Open. The Bryans earned
wins over high-ranking doubles
teams in major tournaments around
the country.
"We had good wins in all our
tournaments," Mike said, "and our
losses were in three sets against good
teams, so the USTA gave us a wild
card into the U.S. Open."
The Bryans prepared for the
Open by playing several major tour
naments. including the ATP Cham
pionships in Cincinnati and the
RCA Championships in Indianapo
lis. in the month prior to the Grand
Slam event.
"There's nothing like playing
tournaments," Bob said. "You can
practice all you want, but it's the
match play that counts."
Even with all the attention given
to former Stanford students Lilia
Osterloh and Jeff Sal/enstein, the
twins felt they received a decent
amount of press on their appearance
at the Open.
"We didn't get any match air
time, but we did have a l()-minute
feature on CBS after our match,"
Mike said.
The Bryans lost in the first round
to Niklaus Kulti and Jonas Bjork
man (fv4. 6-3). who were finalists in
the doubles draw.
"I had beaten Kulti a few weeks
before, so when he came out at the
Open, he was really fired up." Mike
said. "They played really well, and
we just played normally, nothing ex
traordinary. I thought we could have
played better, but we've just been
unlucky in the draw. We've played
top-l()seeded teams in the last three
years."
Even with a first-round loss and
no prize money except to cover trav
el expenses, both Bob and Mike
stressed that the experience is in
valuable.
"When you have the chance to
play in the U.S. Open, you go and
play," Bob said. "It's the biggest
tournament of the year."
"We were happy just to get the
wild card," Mike said.
"It was so much lun to hang out
with all the pros for the last three

summers now," Bob said. "It really
was the highlight of our summer."
Although looking alike doesn't
help them out on the courts since
Mike is right-handed and Boh is a
lefty, they both say being twins and
playing together for so long has
helped their game.
"We've been playing doubles for
so long that we don't need [hand)
signals," Mike said. "I just know in
tuitively where Bob is going to hit."
"Everything's so smooth out
there when we're playing together,"

Bob said.
That's not to say the pro tour
doesn't offer the twins a challenge.
"Flaying on the pro tour is a lot
different," Mike said. "It's a step up.
In the juniors and in college, you can
get away with things. In the pros, it's
harder to break serve, and the re
turners are a lot better.
"There are no free points in the
pros. You can get some free points in
the juniors and in college, and it's
just so much easier."
"In the juniors, players usually

concede at 40-0. but against the pros
you have to focus a lot harder," Bob
said. "It looks a lot easier when you
get back from playing on the pro tour,
because when you play pros, your
level of play goes through the roof."
Though they plan to tour profes
sionally full-time after college, the
twins are hoping they will be able to
put their professional experience to
good use for Stanford during the
year.
"We just want to get to the next
level," Bob said.
