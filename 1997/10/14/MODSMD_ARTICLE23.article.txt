# Leroux goes home again
## Junior forward leads field hockcy on crucial Boston trip

It wasn't long ago that
Monique Leroux, then a high
school senior, was thrown into a
basketball game for Toyon's all
male intramural team while on
her recruiting trip. Leroux
wasn't fazed.

The following school year,
she found herself scrimmaging
against former Olympic field
hockey team member and head
coach Sheryl Johnson in the
team's practices. Leroux wasn't
fazed.
I fer freshman year concluded
with a NCAA tournament
match against Penn State. Ler
oux still wasn't fazed.
She has, however, been deter
mined to get back to that tourna-

nient ever since.
Now a junior, Leroux has started
all 12 matches for the Stanford
women's field hockey team this sea
son and is an integral member of the
team. She leads the Cardinal in al
most every offensive category, hav
ing racked up five goals and three as
sists for a total of 13 points.
"I feel a lot more confident as a
team leader." Leroux said.
Having grown up in Worcester,
Mass.. Leroux might be playing a dif
ferent sport today had she not gone to
a small high school. A soccer player
since the age of five. Leroux had to
make a decision as a high school
freshman: cross country or field hock
ey. Ix-roux picked the latter.
"I've always liked team sports,"
she said. "By that point, I was excit
ed to move on. It was something to
tally new."
Four years later, Leroux was
( entral Massachusetts' player of the
year and facing an even tougher
choice.
"It pretty much came down to
Stanford and Harvard," Leroux said
of her college decision. "I came here
on my recruiting trip, and that was it.
I fell in love with it."
Coming across the country to
Stanford was a bold move for Ler
oux, considering her entire family
resided in the Massachusetts and
Connecticut area.
"I think it was really hard for
them to think I'd be away," she said.
"They wouldn't get to see me play
very often."
Three years later, Leroux is confi
dent in her college decision. And
when the Cardinal plays four games
at Boston College this week, her
family will finally get to see her play.
With six other juniors on the
team, Leroux has found a family on
the West Coast as well.
"Our class has always been really
tight," she said. "I love the team. 1
feel like over the years we've accom
plished a lot."
Leroux and her teammates have
put in a lot of time during the last few
years to reach those accomplish

ments. Although the winter quarter
is an off-season, the team conditions
and lifts weights year-round.
"It's just part of my schedule."
Leroux said. "It helps me manage
my time, although it gets busy with
traveling [during the season]."
Playing field hockey in the West
does have its disadvantages. A once
automatic hid to the NCAA tourna
ment no longer exists for the winner
of the Northern Pacific Athletic Con
ference, of which Stanford is a mem
ber. Generally, West Coast schools
are not taken seriously when it comes
to NCAA tournament selection.
"They don't see us as all that
good," Leroux said. "We have to
prove ourselves."
Doing everything to help the
team, Leroux seems less concerned
about how she looks on the field
than about how the team looks.
"I like finesse hockey," she said.
"I'm not into the individual thing. 1
like when everybody on the team is
playing well."
While the team plays well togeth
er on the field, off the field there is
also a great bond. Certain traditions
have brought both past and present
Stanford field hockey players to
gether.
"We go on a team bonding trip
during the pre-season," Leroux said,
"and every freshman gets a nick
name. It's been going on for2()years.
You get a fruit name and a nickname
comes out of it."
So Leroux became known as
"Ammo," "Unique" and her
fruit / vegetable name, "Snow Pea."
"It started out with apple and ba
nana and now it's a connection with
all the alumni," she said. "There are
people I just know by their nick
names. Hut now, the nicknames are
getting exotic."
Leroux's plans for the future are
not clear. A biology major, she has
been playing with the idea of going
to veterinary school after taking a
year off. As for field hockey, howev
er, there aren't many options.
"They have a club hockey team
for post-college players," she said
"It's pretty popular in this area."
Who knows ... Snow Pea may fi
nally get an assist from Apple to
score on Banana.
