# Card seeks respect back East
## 
### 
The leaves are turning in Boston, to
the reds and golds that make au
tumn in New Fngland legendary.
For all its sun, all its T-shirt-clad stu
dents, Stanford in October can't com
pare to the East Coast.
Legend has it that field hockey is the
same way. For all the sun of Stanford, all
the outstanding student-athletes on its
team, the Cardinal's field hockey pro
gram is not equated with the big girls of
the sport. West Coast programs are not
well-regarded in field hockey's inner cir
cle.
ITiere's a lot to be said, however, for
being able to wear shorts on I lalloween.
And there's a lot to be said for Stanford
field hockey.
The Cardinal is K-4 on the season.
Three of those loses came early in the
year, when Stanford was missing key ju
niors Justina Williams, Carey Cloyd and
Sarah Medeiros, all of whom were trav
eling abroad with the I J.S. Junior World
Cup team. Iliose three players com
prised the largest World Cup contingent
of any school in the country.

In the trio's first weekend back, Stan
ford beat then-No. 7 Ball State in St.
Louis. Saturday, Stanford so dominated
NorPac rival Pacific that the Tigers man
aged only one shot on goal the entire
match.

Apparently, someone forgot to tell
this team that in field hockey. West is not
best.
"The palm trees," saicl freshman de
fender liinily Lash, "aren't milking us
any less focused or less talented players."
The team has a great chance to prove
that starting today, when Stanford meets
Dartmouth in the first of four games for
the ( ardinal at Boston C ollege. The six

day trip is a chance for Stanford to earn
some respect right from the source.
"It's a way for us to come out and say
field hockey isn't just an Hast Coast
sport," said sophomore forward Mallory
( hainhers. "We play it out here, tot)."

hockey. The former has them, the latter

football games sometimes draw larger
crowds.
The difference was apparent as soon
as the team arrived in Boston yesterday.

"We were driving down the street,"
Chambers said, "and every school
has a field hockey goal."
Another big change playing in
Boston: artificial turf. Stanford's
field is natural grass, which slows
down the ball and can cause strange
hops. In the East, artificial turf is the
standard — and games, accordingly,
are more fast-paced.
Both changes should help the
team. Playing in front of a crowd is
always an intensity boost, and play
ers say the Stanford team is more
suited for artificial turf than grass.
"Our team is actually a turf
team," Chambers said. "We're a
great precision passing team. That's
really highlighted when you play on
turf."

Only the chilly Boston night air
will pose a new problem for Stan
ford. The Cardinal plays two night
games on the trip, Thursday vs. Yale
and Friday vs. Boston College. Both
start at 7:30 p.m. Both should be cold.
That means more stick vibration,
which calls for players to wear gloves,
which in turn forces them to change
their grips. For a team accustomed to
playing in 80-degree afternoon
weather, that could be a tall order.
"We're not used to playing in the
cold," Chambers said. "We'll have
to have a lot longer warm-up ... to
get mentally prepared for that."
Stanford hopes to make up for
any adjustment difficulties with in
creased focus. The nature of the
Boston trip demands it. To say this is
a critical road swing is an understate
ment — a Stanford sweep would
greatly boost both West Coast field
hockey and the Cardinal's faint

NCAA tournament hopes.
"I'm really focused, particularly
because there's a lot of people
here," Lash said.
Chambers agreed. "The intensi
ty level is going to be higher," she
said. "We know we're going to be
playing great teams."
To their credit, the Western up
starts are confident. Many of them
passed up the chance to attend an
eastern school in favor of Stanford's
distinct student lifestyle. This is their
chance to show they made the right
choice.
"1 think |the trip] is big," Lash
said, "but I think our whole season
has been opening people's eyes.
This trip is building on that."
