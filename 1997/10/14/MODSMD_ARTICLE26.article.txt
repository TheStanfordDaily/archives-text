The name, look and character of the on-campus estab
lishment will remain the same. Only Polio Rev's legal doc
uments will change in its upcoming merger with Una M;ts.
The merger of the two Mexican restaurant chains will
involve a non-cash stock swap. Shareholders will ex
change stock in Polio's and Una M3s for stock in the new
entity, Una Mas Restaurants.
The merger between the twocompanies was not done
to facilitate a change in management but to forge a
strategic alliance between Polio Rey and Una Mas in the
Mexican eatery business, said Polio's Chief Operating
Officer Art Velasquez.
As a result, most aspects of the Stanford Polio's
restaurant will remain unchanged. Velasquez noted that
"students will not notice any effect whatsoever. The
menu, operations and managing staff of Polio's will all

remain the same."
The Mexican eatery opened on campus last Novem
ber as part of an attempt to revitalize I residder Union
and make it a focal point of student activity.
Polio's was chosen because the University was seek
ing vendors who would "have a willingness to be flexible
in their menus, work collaboratively with students on ac
tivities and simplv be good members of the Stanford
community and culture," according to Wais. Other
changes in Tresidder include the addition of Jamba Juice
and a recently opened exercise facility.
Polio's management emphasized that future changes
in restaurant management will only be made to keep the
restaurant up to date.
"We are always asking what the next generation ol
Mexican restaurants should look like," said Polio's Real
Estate Manager Peter O'Brien. "We want to stay on the
cutting edge of the business."
