Bright red candles illuminated White Plaza last night as
the Stanford American Indian Organization held a can
dlelight vigil commemorating Indigenous People's Day.
The purpose of Indigenous People's Day is "to re
member the struggles of Indian people and to remember
those who have fought for Indian people in the past and
in the present," according to Angela Parker, a senior. "I
wanted to remember people in my family and in mv tribe
who have made a difference for Indian people."
Nearly 50 people were in attendance at the vigil, most
of whom remained silent throughout the event.
"We just want to bring awareness to everyone; this
isn't Columbus Day â€” or it shouldn't be, with all the in
justices that have happened to our people and are still
happening to our people," said Enei Begaye, a sopho

more. "It's amazing that Columbus Day is still recog
nized and still celebrated."
Earlier, an open microphone session was held from
noon to 1 p.m.; during which members of Stanford's Na
tive American community shared views regarding honor
and remembrance of indigenous peoples.
A presentation on Native American activist Leonard
Peltier was given by the National People's Campaign last
night. Peltier is serving two consecutive life sentences for
the murder of two FBI agents. Many consider him a po
litical prisoner.
The candlelight vigil tradition was first initiated by
SAIO in 1992, the s(X)th anniversary of Christopher
Columbus' 1492 voyage.
"Indigenous People's Day for us is a time for us to let
out some rage and to honor those people that came be
fore us and the people today continuing the struggle and
fight against injustices," said Begaye.
