# Study abroad
## Mexican campus will open in January

Native residents of Cholula, Mexico, claim
their town "has a church for every day of the
year." In reality, there are about half that.
This winter, 25 Stanford students will live
and learn among those churches, presenting a
new cultural addition to a land rich in cultural
history.
Those enrolled in the new Stanford pro
gram in Cholula, just outside of Pucbla, Mex
ico, will take part in an innovative experiment
in overseas studies. The program stands out
among current programs for its development
of an intimate relationship with a foreign uni
versity, the Universidad de las Americas and
its exceptionally stringent prerequisites in
language, economics and cultural studies.
Pucbla is a city of 2.5 million people, a 90-
minute drive southeast of Mexico City. Stan
ford students there will work in close con
junction with Mexican university students,
living and learning in groups. In contrast to
most current overseas opportunities, students
in Puebla will live in dorms rather than with
local families.
German Studies Prof. Russell Berman, di

rector of Stanford's Overseas Studies Pro
gram, said Pucbla "wants to take best advan
tage of specific opportunities so students are
not repeating material that could have been
taught" at Stanford.
Because students are expected to partici
pate in upper-level courses, application re
quirements are more stringent than current
overseas programs, including a recommend
ed two years of Spanish, and three classes in
the student's chosen academic track â€” eco
nomics or cultural studies.
Applicants for the economics track are re
quired to have taken Economics 1, 51 and 52,
while students in the cultural studies track
need to have taken one class in at least three
of five areas: anthropology, archaeology, pre-
Columbian history, sociology and race and
ethnicity.
Although the Universidad de las Americas
runs on a semester program, the academic
schedule will be compressed to accommodate
the Stanford quarter system.
