# Study abroad
## Mexican campus will open in January 
### James Pritchard 
Native residents of Cholula, Mexico, claim
their town "has a church for every day of the
year." In reality, there are about half that.
This winter, 25 Stanford students will live
and learn among those churches, presenting a
new cultural addition to a land rich in cultural
history.
Those enrolled in the new Stanford pro
gram in Cholula, just outside of Pucbla, Mex
ico, will take part in an innovative experiment
in overseas studies. The program stands out
among current programs for its development
of an intimate relationship with a foreign uni
versity, the Universidad de las Americas and
its exceptionally stringent prerequisites in
language, economics and cultural studies.
Pucbla is a city of 2.5 million people, a 90-
minute drive southeast of Mexico City. Stan
ford students there will work in close con
junction with Mexican university students,
living and learning in groups. In contrast to
most current overseas opportunities, students
in Puebla will live in dorms rather than with
local families.
German Studies Prof. Russell Berman, di

rector of Stanford's Overseas Studies Pro
gram, said Pucbla "wants to take best advan
tage of specific opportunities so students are
not repeating material that could have been
taught" at Stanford.
Because students are expected to partici
pate in upper-level courses, application re
quirements are more stringent than current
overseas programs, including a recommend
ed two years of Spanish, and three classes in
the student's chosen academic track â€” eco
nomics or cultural studies.
Applicants for the economics track are re
quired to have taken Economics 1, 51 and 52,
while students in the cultural studies track
need to have taken one class in at least three
of five areas: anthropology, archaeology, pre-
Columbian history, sociology and race and
ethnicity.
Although the Universidad de las Americas
runs on a semester program, the academic
schedule will be compressed to accommodate
the Stanford quarter system.
Senior Cecilia Ballf, the academic adviser
for the new Pucbla program, attended the
Universidad de las Amdricas inde
pendently last fall. Her experience
there has assisted Overseas Studies
in an orientation process made dif
ficult by the program's newness.
The Puebla university "is one of
the biggest, wealthiest universities
in Mexico," she said. "It is compa
rable to a U.S. university campus in
its resources and libraries."
According to Herman, the

school features especially strong
Economics and Archaeology de
partments.
The Puebla program's opening
day, next Jan. 5, will he the culmina
tion of 18 months of preparation by
Overseas Studies and faculty from
the two universities. The program
was created in response to a high
campus interest in Mexico and a
second Spanish-language program,
according to Berman. Spanish
speaking students previously only
could attend a program in Chile.
Currently, the program is only

offered winter quarter and will be
limited to 25 students. Puebla will
be the first program to have such a
strong tie to an outside university.
However, Balli felt that despite
the difficulties in establishing this
academic partnership, "it shouldn't
be too difficult for students to
adapt."
After Puebla opens, Overseas
Studies will look into further ex
panding its campuses.
"I would like to see a program in
China," Berman said. "There is a
high interest for this on campus."
