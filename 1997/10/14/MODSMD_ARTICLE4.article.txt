# Looking at fee reform
## Senate to debate bill 
### Allison Hays Staff writer 
A proposal currently before the ASSIJ Senate would
radically reform the special-fee system, giving control
over annual allocations to nonpartisan committees.
Currently, each group's special fee is approved by the
student body in the Spring Quarter (ieneral I lection.
"This issue has been a subject of complaint for many
years as groups have consistently and randomly lost
funding," said the bill's author, Mike Slemmer, an
ASSI I senator and coterminal student. "I thought it was
time to fix the system."
lor example, groups such as the Chicano /1 atino or
ganization MliChA, the KZSU radio station and the
SC HN TV station did not win special-fee funding for the
19%-97 academic year.
The bill addresses several complaints til the current
system. The present system "politicizes student group
funding," according to the bill, which also criticizes The
Stanford Daily's endorsements of budgets saying that
the paper "exercises undue influence over the fate of
student groups."
Instead of the students voting on funding, the fate of
a group's budget would be determined by the ASSI J's
Program Hoard, Publications Board and Community
Service Hoard. Slemmer added that these groups "are
apolitical because the members of the board are chosen
by the Nominations (Commission |."
This year, the funds disbursed through special fees to
taled $1,(MW,465.40, of which 25.4 percent was paid by
graduate students and the rest by undergraduates. The
bill proposes that the special fee be
replaced by an "association fee." A
quaiter of the more than $1 million
fee would be paid by graduate stu
dents; undergraduates would pick
up the rest.
Other ASSU politicians agree
with the spirit of the bill and appear
to endorse some type of special-fee
allocation reform.
"1 am in favor of special-fee re
form. and I think this amendment
would increase the fiscal responsibil
ity ol groups on campus," said junior
Joseph Freund, the senate chair.
"Under this new system, groups that
put on meaningful programming of
the sort generally funded by the
ASSU would need not fear the loss
of funding due to low voter turnout
or student apathy."
ASSU President Emily Andrus
was also receptive to the idea.
"The bill captures the true intent
of the special fee started back in
1% 1 )," she said. "The current system
of budgeting by referendum is prob
lematic because students end up vot
ing on the group and not the pro
posed budget, and very lew take the
time to look at the budgets in the

election handbook."
Some students, however, were
not as positive about the proposal.
"I can't think of a single good rea
son why this right — which is an im
portant consequence of a democrat
ic system — should be denied to a
Stanford student," said junior Uma
Sanghvi. "This so-called bill revokes
our right to vole on special fees and
is made on the absurd assumption
that wc are too ignorant to decide
which groups ought to be funded.
That's inane."
ASSU Financial Manager Don
Coleman said he is concerned be
cause the measure caps the funding
at its current level, making it difficult
to accommodate expansion.
Hut Slemmer said that was his in
tention.
" The fee is right now at its highest
level ever, by a lot. I think students
would respond positively to stopping
and capping it now. It offers groups a
lot of funding but guarantees students
against further increases," he said.
The bill will be presented and de
bated at the senate meeting next
Tuesday. As a change to the system
would represent an amendment to
the ASSU Constitution, it requires
passage by the student body in next
spring's general election before it
can be put into effect.
