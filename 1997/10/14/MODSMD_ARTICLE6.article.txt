# Congress considers new crime reporting rules for colleges
## Stanford meets most proposals 
### Angel Flores Contributing writer 
Recent controversy over the availability
of campus crime statistics has led to the pro
posal of new federal legislation, the Accura
cy in Campus Crime Reporting Act.
Under the current law, the Student
Right to Know and Campus Security Act of
1990, colleges are required to make public
the number of crimes that occur each year
on campus.
However, some schools have found
loopholes in the law, which has resulted in
campus crimes going unreported to the stu
dents. The new bill has been designed to
close such loopholes.
"It's important for people to have an

idea of what sorts of problems exisl in our
community so that people can protect
themselves and their property," said Stan
ford Police ('hicl Marv I lerrington.
Dean of Students Marc Wais also said he
supports the full reporting of crime statis
tics. " The more information we can provide
students and families, the better informed
they can be about the community," he said.
"People can make better choices to regard
ing safety."
I he U.S. I louse of Representatives held
public hearings in July to evaluate the bill
and hear testimony concerning the report
ing of campus crime.
Herrington said Stanford has not had
problems compiling complete and accurate
statistics, as some other universities have.

"We've complied with wh;it is now the
law well be lore the law came out,'' I Icrring
ton said, adding that statistics have been re
ported each ol the 2b years he luls been with
the department.
livery year, the department publishes
I he Stanford Safety & Secuiity Almanac
and distributes W),(HX) copies to students
and University employees. Ihe yellow
book includes a list ol ct ime statistics, cam
pus police services, safety-related services
and other safety in formation.
"It provides references and how to pro
tect yourself and be safer on campus and
elsewhere," Herrington said. "Its valuable
information in one place that students get
once a year as a reminder."
Some schools that do not publish
crime statistics claim that being re
quircd to do so violates legislation
protecting the confidentiality of vic
tims' records.
The statistics that Stanford publi
cizes iire either part of police records
or are obtained from counseling cen
ters around the University. Those re
ports received by the police depart
ment from counselors have names
deleted in accordance with privacy
legislation.
"It has been a bit of work to make
sure we're doing it right, and we
think we are," 1 lerrington said.
I lerrington said crime statistics

are available to the media and are
printed in several publications
around campus.
Another gray area in reporting
crime is the way crimes are defined.
I lerrington said definitions of crime
differ from state to state and that bur
glary, theft and robbery are often
confused.
"California's are pretty straight
forward," I lerrington said. "The
laws here are pretty clear."
He also said that many universi
ties don't have a police department
but instead have a security office.
Schools at which a high population
lives in areas near campus may also
have problems reporting crimes that
occur off campus.
Because most students live tin
campus, Herrington doesn't have
problems with gathering statistics.
