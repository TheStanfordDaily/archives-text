See your career in a finer light at Cymer, the leading manufacturer of deep
ultraviolet (DUV) lithography light sources for the semiconductor industry.
Since 1986, Cymer's focus has been on the semiconductor industry's transition
to DUV lithography - the enabling technology for fabricating the next several
generations of leading-edge semiconductor devices.
Cymer designs and manufactures excimer lasers and is equipped for world-class volume
production and global support. These lasers excite special mixtures ol krypton and fluorine
gas to produce intense, rapid pulses of very short wavelength light in the DUV portion of the
optical spectrum (.248pm). Cymer's excimer laser technology has become essential as the
industry shifts to the next generation semiconductor manufacturing requiring high performance
light sources.
In spite of our dazzling growth rate - a 345% increase in revenue in 19% - we still maintain an environment of a small, dynamic
company characterized by a down-to-earth management style, concurrent engineering and manufacturing, and team enthusiasm
fueled by success and leading edge technology.
We also foster individual and professional growth of our employees with a remarkable combination of formal training programs
and hands-on experience to familiarize you with excimer laser microlithography. After all, there's no better way to learn new
technology than by helping to create it.
