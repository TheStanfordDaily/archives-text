DOING 'IT
Ever heard the old phrase "horse sense"? For junior
Vanessa Bartsch, Western captain of Stanford's
Equestrian team, it's the secret to success. Not only .
does Bartsch use horse sense (riding skills), she's used
"horse sense" (practical common
fjgjr sense) to build her team from only
3 riders to 19 in just a few months.
That's even more impressive
considering that although Bartsch
I' has been riding for fun smce age
five when she needed a chair to
reach the saddle, she had never
competed before Stanford.
As a freshman Bartsch tried
English competition, then joined the Western team her
sophomore year. For the rest of us equine ingenues,
English and Western riding differ in gait (speed and
style), tack (saddle and bridle) and apparel.
Last sea.son, with only a,year of Western competi
tion under her belt, Bartsch qualified for Nationals
individually in Western riding and placed 13th overall .
in her division.
This year, with only three grads to replace and
team ranks growing thanks to her recruiting skills,
Bartsch hopes to lead the team's Western and English
riders to Nationals. Talk about horse power. Alda Leu
