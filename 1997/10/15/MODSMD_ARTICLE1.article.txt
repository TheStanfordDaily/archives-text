Students, faculty and staff are grieving today after
learning of the death of Lora Romero, an assistant
English professor and former resident fellow in Casa
Zapata.
Romero was Zapata's resident fellow from 1995 to
1997.
According to the San Mateo County coroner's office,
Romero committed suicide on Friday after checking in

Most of the Stanford community, however, did not
find out about Romero's death until yesterday.
Students yesterday praised Romero's openness and
the guidance she provided as both a professor and resi
dent fellow.

"She really cared
about Zapata," said
Edelina Burciaga, a

make Zapata feel like
a family."

recently married, re
called when Romero
hosted a bache
lorette party for
Burciaga, friends
and the house staff
at her RF cottage
last year.
"She opened her

house to us. She was really open. We'll miss her," Bur
ciaga said. "So many people cared about her."
Celia Garcia, a junior who lived in Zapata during
her freshman and sophomore years, said that Romero
was a role model and inspiration.
"She was loved by our community," Garcia said. "A
lot of us Latinas looked up to her. She broke a lot of
barriers, her work showed that."
Romero taught classes on Chicano literature and
culture in the English Departmefll'"'9tlB BISU taught a
class held at Zapata last year on videotaping Chicano

his cottage to remember Romero.

to remember Romero. The date and time will be an
