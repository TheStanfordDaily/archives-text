## Editorial Stanford's judicial system What new charter? 
### 
Students need to be
informed before charter
takes effect on Jan. 1.

THE NEW JUDICIAL system will
go into effect Jan. 1. The new pro
cess is a good one: students are
more in control of their disciplinary fate,
and the appeal system has become more
timely.
The only problem is that the general
student body, as well as most faculty and
staff, don't really know what effect the
charter will have on them. The Office of
Judicial Affairs has been working to edu
cate the Stanford community, but the effort
has not been large or dynamic enough.
Under the new system, a student
accused of a violation of the Honor Code
or the Fundamental Standard must go
before a judicial panel composed of four
students and two faculty or staff members.
This panel hears all cases: panel members
would be selected from student and facul
ty / staff pools.
The charter also outlines the procedure
for dealing with violations: complaints
must be filed within 60 days from the date
of the evidence of the alleged violation. In
place of the old process, where a student
was advised and prosecuted by the same
person, there will be a judicial adviser, who
counsels both sides, and a judicial officer,
who gathers evidence and determines
whether the charges against a student are
valid. If so determined, the case goes
before the judicial panel.
The differences in the new judicial sys
tem is positive for students, but despite the
education that is occurring, students don't
know what the charter is all about.

During Orientation, the Judicial Affairs
Office had educational programming for
resident assistants and resident computer
coordinators. The Center for Teaching and

Learning has incorporated the new judicial
system into its training sessions for teach
ing assistants and course assistants.
However, the information on the new
judicial system has been buried in discus
sions on the Honor Code and the Funda
mental Standard. Because the new judicial
process will not take effect until Jan 1.
both the old and new processes were
explained, causing considerable confusion.
While all are important topics, more
time could have been given to the new judi
cial process. Students like RAs and TAs
are the students who need to reach out to
other student with the information given to
them: they should be sure their students
and residents understand the Honor Code
and the consequences of violating it.
No outreach to faculty or staff has
occurred at all. At the Faculty Senate
meeting last year where the charter was
passed, faculty were concerned that the
line between what should be dealt with
simply by a professor and what should be
reported to Judicial Affairs was unclear.
At the time. Judicial Affairs Officer Jen
nifer Perkins suggested an informational
pamphlet providing hypothetical situa
tions of I lonor Code violations and appro
priate actions students and professors
should take.
We have been given no such guidelines
to help us to define the new system.
The new Board on Judicial Affairs,
which is to be the governing body of the
charter, has not met yet to work out the
gray areas in the procedures. What does it
mean for alleged violations to be pro
cessed "in a timely manner?" It is the duty
of the new Board to work these kind of
problems: discussion should take place
before the charter goes into effect Jan. 1.
The attempt to educate faculty, staff
and students about the new judicial sys
tem has not been far reaching enough.
During the coming months, we hope the
Office of Judicial Affairs makes concerted
effort to reach out to the campus and
inform them.
