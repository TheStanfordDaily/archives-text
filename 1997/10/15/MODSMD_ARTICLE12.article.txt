No taxation without
representation
The ASSU has often seemed out of
touch with the average student, but now
they are showing fascist tendencies as well.
The special fee reform proposal, if passed,
would amount to taxation without repre
sentation.
If 1 don't want my money to subsidize
certain groups whose views 1 do not agree
with, then I want to be able to say "No!"
when their greedy little fingers try to get
into my pocket.
The current special fee process is polit
ical, but so are many of the groups
requesting funds. The current voting sys
tem should be reformed — groups should
have to get more than 50 percent of the
entire student body to vote "yes" in order
to receive their fees. As the system is
right now, the people who are motivated
to vote are not representative of the

whole student body but are the vocal
minority who have the most to gain
(money for their pet special interest
group). The view of the majority of stu
dents rule, not that of a tiny minority.

Band was merely satirical
As an educated, catholic European. 1
think that the punitive actions undertaken
against the Stanford Band are totally unjus
tified and not in line with the academic
freedom of expression that should allegedly
reign on campus. Obviously, "Die Luft der
Freiheit weht... nicht mehr!"
The lack of sense of humor, narrow
mindedness and bigotry of the people com
plaining about the Stanford Band appear
ance do not upset me. What surprises me is
that the Stanford administrators were
receptive to such specious arguments.
For the sake of academic freedom and

Stanford's own reputation, I wish that the
Stanford Band be granted the broadest
freedom of expression and support from
Stanford officials at any level.
Long live the satire!

Bartsch was not
encouraging unbridled
promiscuity
1 am writting in response to Brain. I
mean. BRIAN Devlin's response to Daily
staff columnist Vanessa Bartsch's article
that appeared Monday, Jan. 13.
Apparently Devlin did not fully grasp
Bartsch's goal in her article. Condoms are
good. Condoms are grand. Condoms
should be used. Condoms also come with
some extra baggage.
Bartsch's column showed the honest
thought process of a woman who acciden

tally came across comdoms in the drawer
of a new gentleman friend. Yes. life would
be wonderful if we all could hold hands
and preach the gospel of condoms and the
wonderful technological advances that
have been made in the field of controcep
tion, but alas that is not the case.
1 would agree with Ms. Bartsch's
thought process. A guy has condoms in
his desk drawer — sex fiend? Concerned
friend? Smart Guy? Disco-dancing-porn
watching-wife-swapping-swinger? Maybe,
but Bartsch realizes that no matter what
the answer may be. the most important
thing is that IF he has sex, it is done safe
ty-
Bartsch realizes the merits of condoms.
She herself is a resident assistant on cam
pus (in one of the most liberal houses 1
might add — except perhaps for Devlin's
own home) and gives out more comdoms
than you can shake a stick at — a good 30
a week at last count. She is well-educated
on the topic and very open minded.

A "dark secret" is not what posessing
condoms is. It is smart, and Bartsch
acknowledges just that. Devlin is out of
line in questioning her morality and
accusing her of a high level of ignorance.
Her article will NOT encourage men
on this campus to toss away those Trojans
out of public embarrassment, but instead
realize that condom use is important part
of a healthy sex life.
As for me, Devlin, gee, maybe I do
come from an "uptight, whitebread fami
ly," but when I came to Stanford, appar
ently an "uptight, whitebread school" in
your eyes. I met people like Bartsch.
who not only helps educate this campus,
but cares greatly for its residents. Both
Stanford and The Daily are lucky to
have her.
Devlin, I do hope you enjoy some well
deserved and hard-earned safe sex in your
future.
