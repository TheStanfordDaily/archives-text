## Where did all the teachers go? 
### 
AS A FROSH, I
had a recurrent
moment of won
der. Back then, I had this
quaint notion that you
could just plan ahead and
walk every place you
needed to go at Stanford,

so I found myself walking
the length of Main Quad a lot. Inevitably,
I'd walk to the rosette at the center and
just pause there for a moment.
Being there was like being at the center
of the intellectual world. I'd turn one way
and imagine brilliant historians reshaping
how we view the past. I'd turn another way
and call to mind visions of crazed mathe
maticians scribbling on bathroom chalk
boards. Philosophers and physicists would
be reasoning hard as they danced merrily
before my eyes.
And after a few seconds of this, I'd
think .. and these people are going to
TEACH me! Wow!"
I still have this little experience, though
less often. When it happens, I'm usually
biking through Quad at some remarkably
unsafe speed, so the above gets shortened
to something like "histo-scribble-sophy
phys-wow," but it's the same gist.
Except for one thing: I never think that
last line anymore.
Stanford has managed to put a lot of
really, really smart people in one place, but

I can count the good teachers I've had here
on one hand and have fingers left over.
After pondering this for a long time,
I've come to a simple conclusion as to why
this is the case: Stanford cultivates
pedantry — unimaginative, overly precise
and passive teaching — among those on its
tenure track. And as many students here
can tell you, the extent of this transforma
tion can be quite dramatic. I'm convinced
some of our professors can fart in the pas
sive voice.
Let me explain the process. We start
with the sort of young professor who writes
on the board a lot and makes wild hand
gestures. Occasional bursts of intense
excitement are common. Jumping in the
air, listening intently and saying things like
"ah!" and "ooooh!" regularly are also
usual signs.
The first step is starting to use over
heads. One morning, a little voice tells said
young teacher to stop writing lessons on
blackboards over and over again. It sug
gests writing the material on an overhead
once in its correct and final form. Hey —
no more chalk stains, no little specks of
dry-erase and no embarrassing mistakes
anymore! This is Pedantic Satan talking,
mind you. There's damn little you can to
do make those little pieces of plastic inter
esting unless you set them on fire.
Once a teacher has perfected the over
heads, the Satanic sheets become the most

important element of class, most of the
good questions that get asked are con
demned to section. Because most graduate
students are at least half-mad, this sucks.
After that, it's a matter of time before
Jaime Escalante becomes Ben Stine. A few
teachers proceed to build comprehensive
class notes. Some start rambling incoher
ently or locking students in small rooms. A
handful break free; for them, we willingly
sweat blood. But most just blither along,
thinking the material will teach itself.
But all of them chant the common
excuse, "I have to cover all this material!
My response to this is that I'd rather learn
one important lesson than have 50 pieces of
material covered for me. Covering material
is the business of tailors, not teachers.
Perhaps it's for the best. When research
becomes almighty, the task of codifying
knowledge for those who already know it,
using their terminology, is what matters.
And that's the skill that pays around here.
Besides, the biggest side effect of how
Stanford teaches its students is an amaz
ingly important lesson: that there are far
better ways of learning things than taking
classes. And I wouldn't trade that lesson
for all the overheads, class notes, course
readers, PowerPoint slides, SITN tapes
and practice midterms in the world.
