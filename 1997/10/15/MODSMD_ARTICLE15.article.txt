# Foriegn Bureau: Berlin
## Faith on many different levels, Yom Kippur in Berlin

Marni Leff

T HERE'S NOTHING QUITE like
an old friend. Someone who remem
bers when you thought that pink
knee-socks and red shorts made a positive
fashion statement.
Someone who knows your parents not
through stories and photographs, but
because she grew up with you.
Someone who has catalogued in the back
of her mind somewhere the names of every
guy you have ever had a crush on.
Old friends provide a certain irreplace
able support mechanism and a special com
fort because there are so many things they
understand without explanation.
I guess that's why it hurts the most when
an old friend lets you down.
For me, one such old friend, who I'll call
Sara, let me down, and she succeeded in
doing so on many levels. Last spring, when
Sara and I discussed our plans for the fall —
mine to spend the quarter in Berlin and hers
to spend the year in Jerusalem — we made
promises to hang out together abroad.
With a three-week vacation in October,
Sara planned to come visit me in Berlin.
As I have slowly struggled to acclimate

to my surroundings and tried to learn to
love my new abode, the idea of getting to
see an old friend held a special appeal.
Last week I got e-mail from Sara. As 1
scanned the first few lines of the message, it
became clear to me that it was a long-wind
ed and pathetic list of issues. She was not
going to come see me after all.
Just as I was getting over that fact and
preparing to write back a not-so-nice mes
sage, I realized that the reasons that she
gave for not coming to visit were far more
bothersome than the fact that she was not
coming after all.
She said that she wasn't going to visit me
because the only way that she could work
Berlin into her extensive travel itinerary
would be to spend a Friday night here. She
explained that she did not feel comfortable
spending Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath, i.e.
Friday night and Saturday) in Germany.
To say that I was infuriated would be an
enormous understatement.
It's not that I don't understand where
Sara is coming from. Perhaps better than
anyone, I do. On Saturday, when I went to
Yom Kippur services, four or five uni

formed Berlin police officers greeted me as
I approached the synagogue.
A plain-clothed Israeli security guard
stood watch across the street, and the people
who I was with explained that undoubtedly
others lurked elsewhere. To enter the actual
synagogue, I had to walk through a metal
detector and past another set of security offi
cials. Admittedly, I found the whole situa
tion rather disheartening, to say the least.
But the experience itself for me made up
for the discomfort. Once 1 actually made my
way into the synagogue, 1 found myself in
the company of between ltX) and 2(H) other
Jewish people, celebrating the high holi
days. We celebrated in a synagogue that the
Jewish community rebuilt in 1947; the Nazis
destroyed the original building on Kristall
nacht.
In three or four other locations around
Berlin, more Jews gathered to pray on the
most solemn of Jewish holidays.
Before 1 came to Berlin, I had no idea
that a strong Jewish community thrived or
even existed in Berlin.
Sara's statement — a categorical refusal
to spend Shabbat in Berlin — represents

giving up on Jewish life in Germany without
even bothering to learn what it's all about. 1
don't pretend to be an expert — 1 think that
even if I were to stay here another 10 years,
it's unlikely that I would even begin to be
able to understand the complexity of the
relationship between Jews and Germany.
But 1 am here, and I am trying, which is
worth something.
When I litler controlled Germany, when
he built Auschwitz and scores of other con
centration camps, his goal was to eliminate
Jewish life from Germany.
Hitler left a legacy and that is the
destruction of the German Jews. That is not
to say that there aren't Jews in Germany but
rather to say that those Jews who do live
here today have come from other countries
and in doing so have rejuvenated Jewish life
in communities throughout the country.
If every Jewish person living in another
country refused to come to Germany, Jew
ish life here would shrivel up and die.
Despite the deaths of six million Euro
pean Jews, more than 53 years after the end
of the Second World War, Jews remain in
Germany and with them a semblance of

normal Jewish life.
Decidedly, there are easier places to be a
Jew. From a mere three weeks of personal
experience, I can tell you that for sure.
That does not mean, however, that the
alternative is to give up and get out. After
all to do so would be to ultimately give
Hitler what he sought: a Germany devoid of
Jewish life.
As for Sara, in the end I did send her
nasty e-mail and felt somewhat vindicated,
though only slightly appeased after doing
so. The response 1 received from her was
even nastier than the message I'd sent out, a
real feat on her part. I have declared to sev
eral mutual friends that I am officially not
speaking to her. Yet, I take comfort in the
fact that even if Sara fails to recognize what
she is missing because of narrow-minded,
shallow and self-righteous assumptions, I
am not making the same mistake. It's what
the Germans call "Schadenfreude," that is,
deriving a certain evil pleasure from some
one else's failure.
