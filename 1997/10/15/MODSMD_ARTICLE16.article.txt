## Stanford's No. 1 fans Always wild, totally devoted to men's hoops, the Sixth Man club rallies for another season 
### Brian Eule 
Rahul Young gives off the appearance of
being a quiet and studious Stanford student.
With his thin-brimmed glasses on and his face
buried in a textbook, it's hard to imagine Young
any other way. His laid-back approach to daily
life and his soft voice go hand in hand.
In Maples Pavilion, Young is a different man.
I lis voice booms and he can be described as any
thing but laid-back.
Come this Friday night. Young will most like
ly be camping out by the student gate of Maples
Pavilion to earn his respective courtside position
for yet another year. He will return to the mass of
body paint, white T-shirts and screaming stu
dents at men's basketball games more common
ly known as the Sixth Man Club.
Saturday morning's signups mark the fifth
season of this notorious bunch, a group that start

cd out with fewer than thirty members and has
grown to more than 6(K) students. Signups will be
held from 8:30 to 10 a.m. outside of Maples Pavil
ion, and spots are expected to go fast.

SIXTH MAN CLUB

■ SIGNUPS: Saturday at Maples Pavilion, K:3()
10 a.m.

"The Sixth Man Club is the reason that Lute
Olson calls Maples Pavilion the toughest place in
the conference to play," said Jamie Zaninovich,
administrative assistant for Stanford men's bas
ketball. "I think I speak for [head coach Mike)
Montgomery when I say that the students are
what this program should be about."
Season tickets, which went on sale at 9 a.m.
Monday morning, are a requirement to be a
member of the club. The Department of Athlet

ics was sold out hy yesterday morning.
"We're building a basketball tradition," said
Zaninovich, who seems to enjoy the club as much
as its members. "I'm willing to do whatever the
students want to do."
While Sixth Man members promise to come
up with some crazy ideas this season, it will be dif
ficult to top the rowdiness of last season's home
crowd, which witnessed an undefeated season at
Maples.
Last year, in the Cardinal's 109-61 destruction
of UCLA at Maples — the worst defeat in Bru
ins history — the Sixth Man ( lub began cheering
for a IJCLA benchwarmer.
"We were so far ahead, we had nothingelse to
cheer for," Young said.
