## Stanford's No. 1 fans Always wild, totally devoted to men's hoops, the Sixth Man club rallies for another season 
### Brian Eule 
Rahul Young gives off the appearance of
being a quiet and studious Stanford student.
With his thin-brimmed glasses on and his face
buried in a textbook, it's hard to imagine Young
any other way. His laid-back approach to daily
life and his soft voice go hand in hand.
In Maples Pavilion, Young is a different man.
I lis voice booms and he can be described as any
thing but laid-back.
Come this Friday night. Young will most like
ly be camping out by the student gate of Maples
Pavilion to earn his respective courtside position
for yet another year. He will return to the mass of
body paint, white T-shirts and screaming stu
dents at men's basketball games more common
ly known as the Sixth Man Club.
Saturday morning's signups mark the fifth
season of this notorious bunch, a group that start

cd out with fewer than thirty members and has
grown to more than 6(K) students. Signups will be
held from 8:30 to 10 a.m. outside of Maples Pavil
ion, and spots are expected to go fast.

"The Sixth Man Club is the reason that Lute
Olson calls Maples Pavilion the toughest place in
the conference to play," said Jamie Zaninovich,
administrative assistant for Stanford men's bas
ketball. "I think I speak for [head coach Mike)
Montgomery when I say that the students are
what this program should be about."
Season tickets, which went on sale at 9 a.m.
Monday morning, are a requirement to be a
member of the club. The Department of Athlet

ics was sold out hy yesterday morning.
"We're building a basketball tradition," said
Zaninovich, who seems to enjoy the club as much
as its members. "I'm willing to do whatever the
students want to do."
While Sixth Man members promise to come
up with some crazy ideas this season, it will be dif
ficult to top the rowdiness of last season's home
crowd, which witnessed an undefeated season at
Maples.
Last year, in the Cardinal's 109-61 destruction
of UCLA at Maples — the worst defeat in Bru
ins history — the Sixth Man ( lub began cheering
for a IJCLA benchwarmer.
"We were so far ahead, we had nothingelse to
cheer for," Young said.

season, one student shaved his head and
covered his neck and head in red paint for
every game.
The group also broke the floor at Maples
last season when it stormed the court after
Stanford forward Peter Sauer beat Ari
zona, the eventual national champion, with
a baseline jumper at the buzzer.
While the group can be perceived as
loud, unorthodox and downright unruly, it
has actually given Stanford basketball a bet
ter name.
"The people who are running the Wood
en Classic wanted to come to a game last
year," Zaninovich said. "We were con
cerned because the only place we could put
them was in front of the Sixth Man Gub.
But we got a call the next week from that

representative, and he said that group of
kids were the best fans he had ever seen."
This season, the Wooden Classic, an an
nual two-game event at the Pond in Ana
heim, is offering students a two-for-one
ticket deal to encourage Sixth Man Club
members to trek down south. The Cardinal,
tabbed No. 9 in the nation in The Sporting
News' preseason poll, meets Georgia at
noon Dec. 6, followed by UCLA-New
Mexico.
As one might expect, Cardinal players
are big fans of the Sixth Man Club.
"It's definitely a huge advantage," said
junior forward Mark Seaton. "When we're
playing well, they get fired up. [Then] we
feed off their energy."
The club certainly provided an advan
tage last year in the NCAA tournament
when Stanford advanced to the regional
semifinals at nearby San Jose Arena.
"We basically had a whole Sixth Man
Club in the arena," said Zaninovich, who

added that 9() percent of the student tickets
went to members. "The atmosphere was in
credible."
For die-hard fans, the Sixth Man Club is
the only way to go. Each member is given
preferred seating — up until 15 minutes
prior to tipoff — as well as a T-shirt. Mem
bers also receive weekly previews and
wrap-ups via e-mail. ITie club has its own
Web page, and Zaninovich is considering
chartering a bus to take interested members
to the California game this year.
"When you sit in the rest of the student
section, it's really quiet," Young said. "You
feel like you are missing out."
