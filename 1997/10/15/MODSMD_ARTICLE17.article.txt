# 1924: Stanford 20, Cal 20
## Thrilling drive in last few minutes ties Cards with U.C. 
### 
Editor's note: When Stanford meets California Nov. 22
at Stanford Stadium, it will mark the l(H)th Big (lame.
To celebrate the history of the cross-Hay rivalry, 7he
Daily will reprint stories of classic Big (James for the
next nine weeks. Each "Big dame of the Week " will ap
pear with its original body and headline. This week's
game fetures the 1V24 Stanford-Cal tie, which tied the
teams for the Pacific Coast Conference title and sent
"Pop" Warner's Stanford team to the Rose Bowl.
Stanford 20, California 20.
Therein lies a tale. A tale of how a great Stanford
team finally stopped the Golden Bear's long uncom
fortable string of victories. A tale of how two Stanford

players, bearing the brunt of a
heavy burden, came through
and outplayed everything in
sight.
It was a triumph of the
Warner system over the firm
ly established Smith system.
Not a triumph because Stan
ford failed to win. but because

California had a chance to win and didn't.
Undoubtedly it was the wonderful work of Murray
Cuddebaek that was responsible, to a large extent, for
Stanford's good showing. From the starting kickoff to
the final tun Cuddebaek was in every play, offensive

and defensive, playing one of the greatest games in his
career and outshining even the sensational little " I ut"
Imlay of California. ( uddeback's kicks. ( uddeback's
tackles, and Cuddeback's passing pulled the Stanford
Cardinal out of a nasty 20 to 6 h01e....
Critics defeated
Neither California nor Stanford won. but the critics
suffered the greatest defeat of the season l ake the ex
ample of Walker, who has had some hard things said
of him. Walker's pass Saturday saved Stanford. It was
a wonderful pass, long, and to its mark.
If the humane society were not so active a body it
might be suggested that ( uddeback's toe be placed in
some suitable place to commemorate the culmination
of its education, and education which doused the gild
ed gold of the Bear in a shower of Cardinal tint.
There can not be enough said of the Stanford re
serves. Stanford reserves put the Cards in the position
they hold today, probable Pacific Coast ( hampions.
Figure it out for yourself. There was Jim Kelly playing
a good game at halfback, led Shipkey in place of
Thomas at end looking like a million-dollar wing man.
Bill Walker, another halfback, who replaced Kelly
and Ciarthwaite at halfback.
And to the old master of the East became one of
the masters of the West in one of the scrappiest, most
sensational and well-played games that the walls of
the California Memorial Stadium will ever witness.
