### Leslie Wingard 
The Stanford field hockey team,
representing the Farm in Boston,
will be absent for five class days. But
after defeating Dartmouth yester
day, the team's road trip is proving to
be worthwhile.

■ TUESDAY S RESULT:
Stanford 2, Dartmouth 1

■ TOMORROW: Stanford (9-4) vs.
Yale (3-6) at Boston College

Justina Williams scored both
Cardinal goals, (he second coming
on a corner shot assisted by Jordyn
Kramer with just eight minutes left,
as Stanford edged the IHth-ranked
Big Green 2-1.
Down 1-0 early in the first half,
Stanford responded to the pressure.
"[We| do a really good job of
keeping focused," said sophomore
forward Mallory Chambers. "We
get psyched because we know we're
here to play."
Stanford's quickness made all the
difference against such an evenly

matched squad as Dartmouth.
"Quick dribbling is one of Dart
mouth's strengths," said assistant
coach Heather Moles, "but Stanford
pulled out the win by passing well
and taking advantage of several cor
ner opportunities."
The squad's goal is to win each of
its four matches, a tall order against
four schools — No. 18 Dartmouth,
Yale, No. 15 Boston College and
Brown — that have been in and out
of the national rankings.
"The East Coast teams don't al
ways give us the credit I think we de
serve," said junior captain Justina
Williams, "and we beat Ball State
when they were ranked seventh.
"We're really concentrating on
Friday's match vs. Boston College.
That'll be a big win."
One of Stanford's goals is to be a
little less apprehensive on the artifi
cial turf. Yesterday, the Cardinal was
somewhat frustrated by a bouncy sur
face that led to many high ball calls.
"Trips are always a good time,"
Williams said. "They're another op
portunity for our already close team
to become closer and really sweet
plays seem even more meaningful."
