fying Tournament, First Round:
Mike Bryan (Stanford) def. Alex
Aybar (Tyler JC) 6-2,6-2;
Alex Kim (Stanford) def. Gareth
Williams (Tulsa) 6-0,6-1;
Sebastian Lani (Mississippi) del.
Geoff Abrams (Stanford) 7-5,6-1

One of two individual tourna
ments that Stanford travels to each
year — and one of the biggest na
tional individual tournaments in the
country — the All-Amcrican is an
NCAA preview that will only affect
players' individual rankings.
Yesterday, sophomore Mike
Bryan and freshman Alex Kim won
in the first round of qualifying. They
will play at least one more each
today to advance into the main
draw.
Bryan defeated Alex Aybar of

Tyler Junior College 6-2, 6-2, and
Kim defeated Tulsa's Gareth
Williams 6-0,6-1.
Both Bryan and Kim say they are
happy with their performances so far
and think they each are competing
well enough to advance.
"1 think I have a good chance, be
cause I've been playing well," Bryan
said, "but 1 still have to qualify.
"It's the second-biggest tourna
ment of the year, and if we do well, it
will definitely help our rankings. 1
haven't played many tournaments
because I was injured for the first
part of the year last year, so this tour
nament could help [our seedings] in
tournaments like the NCAA tour
nament later this year."
Said Kim, competing in his first
tournament for the Cardinal: "I got
off to a good start, and I'm definitely
happy about [playing for Stanford]. I
play the eighth seed (today), and I
think I have a good chance."
Sophomore Geoff Abrams was
the lone Stanford casualty yester
day, falling to Sebastian Lani of Mis
sissippi 7-5,6-1 in his first qualifying
match.
Bob Bryan received an automat-
ic berth into the singles draw and will com
pete in the main draw beginning tomor
row. Bob and Mike Bryan also will be
competing together in the doubles compe
ntion. The twins are seeded fourth in the
doubles draw and are the only doubles
team from Stanford competing in the tour
nament.
Ryan Wolters also earned an automat
ic berth into the singles draw but is unable
to play due to a muscle pull suffered at the
end of the summer.
Wolters "missed the last three weeks of
summer," said head coach Dick Gould.
"He's been practicing and playing, but he's
not quite ready to play a tournament with
two matches a day yet."
Though the players have had only had a
week and a half of practice this year,
Gould doesn't believe they'll be affected
by the lack of team practice time.
Seniors Paul Goldstein and Charles
I loeveler — who are not enrolled at Stan
ford t his quarter — and senior Misha Pale
nek are competing in a pro satellite tourna
ment this weekend in Danville, Calif.
Goldstein and Hoeveler, who were not
eligible to enter the Ail-American tourna
ment because they are not currently en
rolled, will return to Stanford next quarter.
