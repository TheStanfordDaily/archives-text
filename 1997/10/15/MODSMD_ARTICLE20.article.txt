# Clark named Player of the Week
## 
### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
Junior defender Jamie Clark was named Mountain
Pacific Sports federation Playerofthe Week on Monday
for his performance in Stanford's weekend matches
against Washington and ()regon State.

Clark was a major reason that Washington's talented
forwards were unable to get behind the Cardinal de
fense, as Stanford forced the Huskies — a team ranked
eighth in the nation at the time to take half their shots
from 15 yards or more. That enabled goalie Adam Za
pala to rccord his l()th shutout of the year in a I 0 Stan
ford victory last Friday.
Zapala, who leads the nation with a phenomenal 0.16
goals-against average, only had to make one save all af
ternoon, on a penalty kick in the 44th minute.

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

Clark and the Stanford defense picked up right where
they left off in Sunday's 0-0 double-overtime tie against
Oregon State, as Zapala needed to make just two saves
in 120 minutes of action. Through 12 games, Stanford has
posted 10 shutouts and allowed just two goals.
Clark became the third Stanford player to be so hon
ored this season, joining junior co-captain A.J Sauer and
Zapala.
