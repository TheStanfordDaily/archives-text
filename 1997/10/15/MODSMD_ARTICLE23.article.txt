# From Disneyland to 'ER':
## Cross country captain Renfro leads on trail and in life 
### Amy Doan 
Forget that her parents both ran cross coun
try and that her father coached track at the Uni
versity of Puget Sound. The real motivation for
Stanford cross country captain Sarna Renfro
came from Mickey Mouse.
Renfro's first career meet came in junior
high school at the ARCO / Jesse Owens track
meet. After winning there, Renfro advanced to
a competition at UCLA and earned a champi
onship trip to Disneyland.
"I remember Mr. Cash saying, 'You should
really do it, Sarna, you could win a trip to Dis
neyland,' " she said.
That meet jump-started a long-distance run
ning career marked by a string of All-America
titles for the Federal Way, Wash., native.
Her talent in the three-kilometer, the five
kilometer and relay events has made her a "cor
nerstone" of the No. 1 Cardinal cross-country
team, according to coach Vin Lananna.
He describes the senior captain as "precise"
and "organized," words that few would associ
ate with cross country. Yet Renfro described
her own style similarly.
"When I'm running, I'm always thinking
about exactly how I feel in relation to exactly
how much of the race is left," Renfro said.
That precision, combined with a team focus
and quiet intensity, have made the senior
something of a big sister to younger team mem
bers. That new role surprises her.
"It seems like so recently I was the observer
on the team, but now they're coming to me for
advice. I've had the advantage of extremes —
I've learned from really good races and really
bad races," she said.
The worst of the "really bad" races finished
with Renfro in a medical tent. At last year's na
tionals, Renfro, battling the flu, learned of her
team's win while hooked up to an IV. But she
would rather talk about the day's "pure pride in
the team" than her faulty electrolyte levels.
"There's an idea that running is an isolated
sport, but it's not true," she said. "It's incredible
to watch people step up when you fall down."
Renfro says she draws from team energy, in
dividual energy, and an "abnormal work ethic."
That work ethic showed up early in Renfro's
life. When she was 11, Renfro wasn't content to
waste away her summers at the pool. Instead,
she opted for manual labor, picking strawber
ries and raspberries for extra spending money.
The experience shaped her sense of disci
pline and pleasure in pushing her body. But it
also sparked an interest in the lives of the mi

grant workers picking alongside her.
A pre-med student in human biology, Ren
fro is studying Third World development, nu
trition and medical care.
When she is not on the track, she juggles her
senior project on the nutrition of women, in
fants and children with her leadership role in
Athletes in Action, a Christian athletes group.
Alhough she's planning a career in health,
Renfro isn't racing to a decision about life after
next June. The senior finds both medical school
and the Olympics attractive options.
"[l'llJ wait and see what the next couple of
years hold," she said.
Her outlook on this season is equally laid
back, according to the coach who has watched
her mature since her freshman year.
"Sarna's very poised and confident this
year. I'm extremely excited about her season,"
Lananna said.
