# Prof. Emeritus Scholes wins Nobel Prize
## Prize-winning work provided basis for valuing options 
### Bimal Shah Editorial staff 
As a young academic at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, Myron
Scholes began working with Fisher Black
on a formula that not only would in fu
ture bear their names, but would eventu
ally win Scholes this year's Nobel Prize.
The Black-Scholes option pricing for
mula was a significant step in financial
theory and practice. An option is a type
of derivative, which means that it is con

nected to another financial instrument.
For instance, a "call option" on a stock
gives the investor the right to purchase a
stock at a certain price, called the exer
cise price. Derivatives are generally used
by sophisticated investors to provide
some protection against losses due to
sudden market movements.
Because options and other derivatives
are linked to other instruments such as a
stock, their value is more difficult to de
termine. The Black-Scholes formula at
tempts to place a value on options by

considering the price of the underlying
asset, the exercise price, the interest rate,
and other factors.
By providing a pricing mechanism,
the model has helped investors become
more comfortable trading in newtypts
of derivatives, expanding the volume of
such trades and making financial mar
kets more efficient in the process.

opened in 1973, the same year that
Black and Scholes published the
seminal paper elaborating their for
mula. The CBOE was an almost in
stant success, and options trading
takes place on several exchanges
throughout the world today.
While stock options are proba
bly the most familiar and were the
initial focus of Black and Scholes'
work, there are also options on
stock indexes, bonds, foreign ex
change and commodities. In addi
tion, there are many large banks
that offer tailor-made options. The
work of Harvard University Prof.
Robert Merton, yesterday's co
winner, involved elaborating on

Black and Scholes' work to make it
applicable to these other types of
options.
Trading in these complex finan
cial instruments can be highly lucra
tive or highly disastrous. A trader
named Nick Leeson caused the col
lapse of Britain's oldest bank, Bar
ings, in 1995 by improperly placing
huge sums in the derivatives mar
ket. The year before, the govern
ment of Orange County, Calif, lost
$1.7 billion in such investments,
leading to one of the nation's largest
public-sector bankruptcies.
At yesterday's press conference,
Scholes addressed the ill esteem in
which some people hold deriva
tives because of these well-publi
cized incidents.
"When you have new technolo
gy, it can be misused or used appro

priately," Scholes explained.
Drawing an analogy, he noted
lhat on a recent trip to Wuhan,
China, where cars are a recent addi
tion to the landscape, he saw drivers
routinely ignoring traffic signs and
autos laying wrecked on the road
side.
"They'll learn to drive correct
ly," Scholes explained. "There will
be fewer accidents."
Scholes also noted that more in
frastructure has been built in recent
years that will allow for the better
application of his and his col
leagues' breakthrough work.
In addition to the pricing model
that bears his name, Scholes is
widely known for his work con
cerning capital markets, financial
services and the effects of global tax
policies on decision-making.
