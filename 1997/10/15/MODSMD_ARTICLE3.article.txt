As a young academic at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, Myron
Scholes began working with Fisher Black
on a formula that not only would in fu
ture bear their names, but would eventu
ally win Scholes this year's Nobel Prize.
The Black-Scholes option pricing for
mula was a significant step in financial
theory and practice. An option is a type
of derivative, which means that it is con

nected to another financial instrument.
For instance, a "call option" on a stock
gives the investor the right to purchase a
stock at a certain price, called the exer
cise price. Derivatives are generally used
by sophisticated investors to provide
some protection against losses due to
sudden market movements.
Because options and other derivatives
are linked to other instruments such as a
stock, their value is more difficult to de
termine. The Black-Scholes formula at
tempts to place a value on options by

considering the price of the underlying
asset, the exercise price, the interest rate,
and other factors.
By providing a pricing mechanism,
the model has helped investors become
more comfortable trading in newtypts
of derivatives, expanding the volume of
such trades and making financial mar
kets more efficient in the process.
