Business Prof. Emeritus
Myron Scholes was awarded the
1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economic Sciences yesterday for
his role in the development of a
widely-used pricing formula for
options.
An option is the right to buy or
sell stocks, bonds or other finan
cial instruments at a fixed price, ir
respective of the market price,
within a given time frame.
The Black-Scholes option pric
ing model is used daily in the
multi-billion-dollar options mar
ket. Scholes and Fisher Black de
veloped it in the early 1970s while
the two were professors at the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology. Black died of throat can
cer in 1995. Scholes will share the
prize with Professor Robert Mer
ton of Harvard University, who
extended the formula's applica
tion.
In a morning press conference,
Business Prof. Mark Wolfson de
scribed Scholes' work as "bril
liant" and having had an "explo
sive impact" on financial practice.
Wolfson specifically cited the
"depth of insight" in Scholes'
work and credited it for "creating
order out of chaos."
"It rivals in significance all pre
vious contributions to financial
theory," Wolfson said. The
awarding of the prize to Scholes
was "more a question of when, not
if," he added.
Scholes himself acknowledged
that he has often been mentioned
as a front-runner for the honor.
"After a while, you say maybe it
will happen."
"Yet, when it happens.. .it's
still a tremendous shock," he said
