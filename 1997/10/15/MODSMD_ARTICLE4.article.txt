# Economist praised for pricing formula

### Bimal Shah Editorial staff 
Business Prof. Emeritus
Myron Scholes was awarded the
1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economic Sciences yesterday for
his role in the development of a
widely-used pricing formula for
options.
An option is the right to buy or
sell stocks, bonds or other finan
cial instruments at a fixed price, ir
respective of the market price,
within a given time frame.
The Black-Scholes option pric
ing model is used daily in the
multi-billion-dollar options mar
ket. Scholes and Fisher Black de
veloped it in the early 1970s while
the two were professors at the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology. Black died of throat can
cer in 1995. Scholes will share the
prize with Professor Robert Mer
ton of Harvard University, who
extended the formula's applica
tion.
In a morning press conference,
Business Prof. Mark Wolfson de
scribed Scholes' work as "bril
liant" and having had an "explo
sive impact" on financial practice.
Wolfson specifically cited the
"depth of insight" in Scholes'
work and credited it for "creating
order out of chaos."
"It rivals in significance all pre
vious contributions to financial
theory," Wolfson said. The
awarding of the prize to Scholes
was "more a question of when, not
if," he added.
Scholes himself acknowledged
that he has often been mentioned
as a front-runner for the honor.
"After a while, you say maybe it
will happen."
"Yet, when it happens.. .it's
still a tremendous shock," he said
as his wife and two daughters l<x>ked
on at the press conference.
Scholes was an assistant profes
sor at MIT in 1%8 when he met
Black. The two were working on a
consulting project for Wells Fargo
Hank when they started talking
about options pricing.
"It's interesting there were no op
tions markets [at the time]," Scholes
said. He added that he was surprised
by how quickly options traders took
hold of his formula when markets
did come into operation.
The methodology developed by
the two professors allows for the
pricing of all contingent contracts or
options. Because of its broad scope,
Scholes said he was hoping to turn it
into at least two papers where he
would apply the methodology to dif
ferent topics.
"Even though quality is impor
tant, so is quantity," Scholes joked.
However, his first paper on the
subject was rejected because his ap

plication of the methodology was
tot) narrow.
"We were told that the formula
wasn't broad enough," said Scholes.
"We married the two articles togeth
er. I had one less article, but it turned
out all right."
Scholes, 56, was the Frank E.
Buck Professor of Finance at the
Business School from 1983 to 19%
and a Senior Research Fellow at the
Hoover Institution from 1987 to
1996. Scholes received his doctorate
in 1969 from the University of
Chicago where he also served on the
finance faculty from 1974 to 1983.
He also holds an MBA from Chica
go and a bachelor's degree from Mc-
Master University in ('anada, his na
tive country. Ile taught at MI I from
1969 to 1974.
Scholes is a member of the
Econometric Society and served as
President of the American Finance
Association in 1990. He holds hon
orary doctoral degrees from the
University of Paris and McMaster
University.
In 1991, Scholes was named a
managing director at Salomon

Brothers, an investment hank, and
was instrumental in building its de
rivatives business, which includes
the trading of options.
After leaving Stanford in 1996,
Scholes co-founded Long-Term
Capital Management, LP., a Green
wich, Conn.-based firm that special
izes in the development and applica
tion of sophisticated financial tech
nology to investment management.
Scholes happened to be in the Bay
Area for a conference when the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sci
ences announced its selection.
The Nobel Prize in Economics
cai ries a cash award of $1 million to
be split equally among the winners.
Scholes wiil have the honor, along
with the other 1997 Nobel laureates,
of formally receiving the prize in
Stockholm in December.
ITiis is the third consecutive year
that a Stanford professor has won a
Nobel Prize. Physics Profs. Martin
Perl and Douglas Osheroff received
the honor in 1995 and 1996 respec
tively. There are now 13 living Nobel
laureates associated with Stanford
or the 1 foover Institution.
