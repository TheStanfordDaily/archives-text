About HXJstaff members and administrators
involved with student affairs met for coffee,
muffins and introductions yesterday morning at
the first in a series of monthly gatherings in
tended to improve interactions between stu
dents and the University.
The breakfast meetings, held by James Mon
toya, vice provost for student affairs, are meant
to allow student affairs administrators to con -
municate with their colleagues and discuss how
to better serve the student population, Montoya
said.
"We mast take and make opportunities to

learn about our students," Montoya said.
"There is so much information about students
that we don't know."
As well as providing an opportunity for stu
dent affairs administrators to mingle, Montoya
added that he hoped the meetings would pro
vide a forum for discussion of important issues,
including the role of parents in the education of
undergraduate and graduate students.
1 le added that the meetings would be a time
for administrators and students to ask "the
tough questions," though he humorously admit
ted that answering these questions was "not
something I look forward to."
