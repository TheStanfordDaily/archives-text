About HXJstaff members and administrators
involved with student affairs met for coffee,
muffins and introductions yesterday morning at
the first in a series of monthly gatherings in
tended to improve interactions between stu
dents and the University.
The breakfast meetings, held by James Mon
toya, vice provost for student affairs, are meant
to allow student affairs administrators to con -
municate with their colleagues and discuss how
to better serve the student population, Montoya
said.
"We mast take and make opportunities to

learn about our students," Montoya said.
"There is so much information about students
that we don't know."
As well as providing an opportunity for stu
dent affairs administrators to mingle, Montoya
added that he hoped the meetings would pro
vide a forum for discussion of important issues,
including the role of parents in the education of
undergraduate and graduate students.
1 le added that the meetings would be a time
for administrators and students to ask "the
tough questions," though he humorously admit
ted that answering these questions was "not
something I look forward to."
Montoya held similar morning meetings
with his staff during his seven-year
tenure as dean of undergraduate ad
missions and financial aid, he said.
Meetings will be held at K:3() a.m.
on the second Tuesday of each
month.
Yesterday's meeting included a
chance for administrators to intro
duce new staff members and included
presentations from ASSU President
Emily Andrus, Senate Chair Joe Fre
und and Financial Manager Don
Coleman. Montoya, who called the

ASSU the "advocates and voice" of
students, said he hopes to work close
ly with student government this year.
Andrus spoke briefly, introducing
administrators to the operation of the
ASSU with the help of an overhead
projector and transparencies.
"The ASSU provides a mecha
nism for partnership," between stu
dents and administrators, Andrus
said. As an example, she discussed the
function of the ASSU Nominations
Committee, which selects students to
sit on University committees.
Freund also emphasized the role
of the ASSU as a liaison between stu
dents and administrators, and con

fronted one problem that student
government leaders and administra
tors have when working together.
"Students may seem demanding,
but its because we're on a different
timeline," Freund said. "For many of
you, Stanford is a career. Unfortu
nately (ASSU officers'] tenure is just
nine months."
With this in mind, Freund asked
the administrators to keep in mind the
necessary "urgency with which we
view issues."
Finally, Coleman provided an
overview of the various business pro
jects managed by Stanford Student
Enterprises, of which he is the head.
