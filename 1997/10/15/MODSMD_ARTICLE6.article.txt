# 28 scholars win fellowships from Humanities Center

### David Shuman 
The Stanford Humanities Center recently
announced the recipients of its fellowships
for the 1997-1998 academic year, with 28
scholars both from Stanford and other lead
ing universities receiving the prestigious
grants.
The group is an "extraordinarily interest
ing mix of scholars ranging from advanced
graduate students to distinguished profes
sors from leading Universities," said English
Prof. George Dekker, a recipient of the fel
lowship.
The fellowship program, which began in
1982, brings Stanford professors, professors

from other universities and graduate stu
dents to the Humanities Center for the en
tire academic year. It also provides them
with the resources — ranging from $25,(XX)
to $40,(KK) — necessary to do their research.
The fellows have daily catered lunches to
discuss their current projects and weekly
presentations to achieve the same goal in a
more formal setting. The center also pro
vides offices and library access to the fellows.
A combination of University support, pri
vate donations and support from national
foundations provides the funding for the
program.
In return, the fellows are expect
ed to make a significant contribu
tion to the Stanford community.
Most teach a class, lead a discussion
group, give a series of lectures or or
ganize a conference or workshop.
For instance, Stanford Linguistics
Prof. John Rickford, who is simul
taneously co-editing two books and
co-authoring another two on topics
ranging from the stylistic variation
of languages to the Ebonics contro
versy, will teach a course this spring
on sociolinguistics.
This year, there were 280 appli
cants from outside Stanford. Fol
lowing a preliminary screening, a
committee made up of three Stan
ford faculty, three outside faculty
and Susan Dunn, the associate di
rector of the Humanities Center

reviewed the applications and
granted fellowships to only six of
the external applicants. This same
committee also chose six Stanford
faculty, but from a much smaller
applicant pool of about 15.
The graduate student fellows
fall into three categories. The
Geballe Dissertation Prize is a
fully funded fellowship that is
awarded annually to one graduate
student. There are also a total of 12
additional graduate fellowships
available to dissertation residents,
who provide their own funding,
and pre-doctoral students, whose
funding is provided by their de
partments.
Dekker, whose project on "The
Transport of Romance: Tourism
and the Romantic Novel in Britain
and America, 1789-1860" was in
spired by his interest in the work of
Henry James, said the involvement
of graduate students distinguishes

Stanford's fellowship program
from those at other universities.
The other Stanford professors
to be awarded fellowships are
Profs. John Bender and Robert
Polhemus of English and Steven
Zipperstein of history and Asst.
Profs. Paulla Ebron of anthropolo
gy, Gabrielle Hecht of history and
Sharon Holland of English.
Dissertation resident fellows
from Stanford include Scott
Boehnen and Simon Dickie of Eng
lish, Anton Bosman, Sarah Stein
and Shannon Sweeney of compara
tive literature, Thomas Conlan of
history, Saba Mahmood of anthro
pology and Robert Reich of educa
tion.
Pre-doctoral fellows from Stan
ford include Keith Leonard of Eng
lish, Carmelina Nocentelli-Truett
of comparative literature, Kristin
Schwain of art history and Michiko
Suzuki of Asian languages.
