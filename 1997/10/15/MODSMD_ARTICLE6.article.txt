### David Shuman 
The Stanford Humanities Center recently
announced the recipients of its fellowships
for the 1997-1998 academic year, with 28
scholars both from Stanford and other lead
ing universities receiving the prestigious
grants.
The group is an "extraordinarily interest
ing mix of scholars ranging from advanced
graduate students to distinguished profes
sors from leading Universities," said English
Prof. George Dekker, a recipient of the fel
lowship.
The fellowship program, which began in
1982, brings Stanford professors, professors

from other universities and graduate stu
dents to the Humanities Center for the en
tire academic year. It also provides them
with the resources — ranging from $25,(XX)
to $40,(KK) — necessary to do their research.
The fellows have daily catered lunches to
discuss their current projects and weekly
presentations to achieve the same goal in a
more formal setting. The center also pro
vides offices and library access to the fellows.
A combination of University support, pri
vate donations and support from national
foundations provides the funding for the
program.
