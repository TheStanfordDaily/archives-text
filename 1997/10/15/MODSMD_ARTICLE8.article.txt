Reno lengthens investigation

WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Janet
Reno extended her investigation into President Clin
ton's fund-raising telephone calls yesterday, giving
her task force until Dec. 2 to see if a special prosecu
tor is needed. "I didn't do anything wrong," Clinton
responded.
Reno's decision came a day before the deadline
for deciding whether to move from an initial inquiry
to a preliminary investigation. She wanted it known
before she was grilled today by the House Judiciary
Committee, Justice officials said.
The committee's Republicans are sure to press
their demand for an independent counsel and to lam
baste her handling of the case so far.
Indeed, the task force has yet to discover specific
and credible evidence that Clinton may have violated

a 114-year-old law barring solicitation of campaign
contributions in federal office buildings, but it needs
more time to analyze evidence, according to these
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
