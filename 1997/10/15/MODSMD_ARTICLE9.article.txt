# Assisted-suicide debate flares
## Supreme Court order removes last obstacle for Oregon measure 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court
rekindled the emotional, ethical debate over assisted
suicide yesterday by clearing the way for a ground
breaking Oregon law that lets terminally ill people get
a doctor's help in killing themselves.
The action came just a day before Oregon voters
were to be mailed ballots asking whether they want to
repeal the assisted-suicide measure.
Although the highest court's order was not a deci
sion and sets no national precedent, it removed the last
hurdle to implementing the assisted-suicide measure.
The justices ruled in June that terminally ill Ameri
cans have no constitutional right to doctor-assisted sui
cide. But those decisions, upholding bans on assisted
suicide in New York and Washington state, did not bar
states from letting doctors prescribe deadly drugs for
mentally competent but terminally ill patients who
want to die.

A IW4 ()regon measure did just that hut it never has
taken effect because of court challenges. Nevertheless,
the state's "Death with Dignity Act" lias played a huge
role in the continuing national debate over end of life
medical decisions.
The Oregon measure had been challenged by two
doctors and a terminally ill woman, but a federal
appeals court ruled that the three lacked the proper
legal standing to sue.
The state I egislature decided this year to ask voters
to reconsider the issue. Ballots on a new measure
one that would repeal the IW4 vote were to be
mailed to Oregon voters Wednesday.
Most states outlaw assisted suicide.
Lawyers on both sides of the assisted suicide strug
gle said yesterday they doubt there will be enough time
for anyone to use the law to commit suicide befoie the
repeal vote is counted.
