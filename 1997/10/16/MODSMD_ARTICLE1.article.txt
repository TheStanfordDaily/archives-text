## Notre Dame accepts Casper's apology for Band's controversial halftime show 
### Krista Glaser 
University President Gerhard
Casper issued a personal apology to
the University of Notre Dame Mon
day for the Stanford Band's contro
versial behavior at the Oct. 4 foot
ball game between the two schools.
Casper, who expressed his "re
gret and embarrassment about the
actions of Stanford's student band,"
had his apology accepted Tuesday
by Notre Dame's president, the
Rev. Edward Malloy.
The Band's parody of Notre
Dame's mascot during the game's
halftime show was considered in
sulting by many who believe that it
contained numerous religious and
ethnic slurs.
Casper described the Band's
"purported satire" as "uncivil and
improper" and wrote that Stanford
students should know not to insult
another's culture and faith.
In his acceptance statement,
Malloy "condemns the bigotry dis
played by the Stanford University
Band and accepts the accompanying
letter of apology" of Casper. Malloy

also described the Band's behavior
as "not merely sophomoric and
boorish, but personally offensive."
"I trust this will be the last time
the group engages in bigotry against
racial, ethnic, religious or other his
toric minorities," Malloy said.
Responding to Casper's apology,
the Band's public relations director,
junior Paul Kalanithi, said, "we're
sorry it went that far," and "we're
ready to do something else now."
"We haven't changed our
process, but the script writers will be
clearer. We have no long-term plans
to do anything non-controversial,"
Kalanithi said.
"We're still the Stanford Band,"
he explained.
Casper's statement is the third
apology issued by Stanford in the
past week. The Band and Athletic
Director Ted Leland previously
apologized.
Terry Shepard, the University's
communications director, explained
that Casper first believed the Band's
actions were an Athletic Depart-
ment issue, but as the issue "contin
ued to churn, [the President J felt he
had to do something."
According to Shepard, Casper

said he thought the apology was ap
propriate because the controversy
became a "broader issue and people
weren't accepting those apologies,"
reffering to those made by the Band
and the Athletics Department.
Earlier this week, the department
decided to prohibit the Band from

performing when Notre Dame re
turns to Stanford in 1999.
Malloy said in his statement that
the Band has been excluded from
the Notre Dame campus since 1991
when it ridiculed Catholics. The pro
hibition will continue indefinitely,
Malloy added.
