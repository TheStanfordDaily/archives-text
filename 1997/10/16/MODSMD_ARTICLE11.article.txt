## GTE bids $28 billion for MCI 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — GTE Corp. offered to buy
MCI Communications Corp. for $28 billion in cash yes
terday, escalating a bidding war for the nation's second
largest long-distance phone company.
The bid would be the biggest all-cash deal ever, top
ping RJR Nabisco lnc.'s $25 billion sale in 1989. It
comes two weeks after World Com Inc., the No. 4 long
distance company, offered $30 billion in stock. British
Telecom earlier proposed paying about $21 billion in
stock and cash.
GTE's board met yesterday to vote on the offer and
made an announcement after the stock market closed.
The $40-a-share offer for MCI is just the latest in a
series of jolts to the nation's telecommunications land
scape. A federal law intended to force more competi
tion has touched off a spate of attempts by the indus
try's biggest players — not all successful — to buy their
way into each other's businesses.
The combined company would be a behemoth in key
telecommunications businesses, with $40 billion in
annual revenue, more than 21 million local business and
residential customers and 24 million long-distance lines.
WorldCom's offer would be worth more than either

rival bid, but investors may settle for a lower price in
return for the security of cash rather than stock. MCI is
scrutinizing whether WorldCom's stock would retain
its value.
MCI said its board would meet shortly to review the
new bid as well WorldCom's. With less than $1 billion
cash on hand, GTE would need to borrow billions
more to pay for MCI. But GTE chairman Charles R.
Lee said he would be willing to consider paying a com
bination of cash and stock instead of all cash.
Buying MCI could make sense for GTE, a major
seller of local phone service. GTE, which doesn't face
the same restrictions placed on the Baby Bell regional
companies, has been expanding into long-distance.
WorldCom's offer on Oct. 1 exposed cracks in
British Telecom's bid, which was reduced in July after
MCI said its earnings would suffer due to massive loss
es from its effort to start local telephone service.
GTE president Kent Foster said that GTE had been
in and out of discussions with MCI for "quite some
time," though he declined to elaborate. But the change
in BT's offer helped spur GTE to go ahead with its bid,
he said.
