# Supersonic car breaks record

GERLACH, Nev. (AP) — Trailing a huge plume of
dust across the desert floor, a British jet-powered car
blasted through the sound barrier twice yesterday,
shattering the world land speed record.
"It's been a magic morning," said a beaming
Richard Noble. "It's a hell of an achievement."
Noble's jet-powered Thrust SSC took advantage of
cool, clear weather for back-to-back runs that pushed
the land speed record above Mach 1, the speed of
sound. The feat came 50 years and a day after pilot
Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier in an
experimental rocket-powered plane.
Noble's car, with Royal Air Force pilot Andy Green
at the controls, went 759.333 mph on its first run and
766.609 mph on the second. The record, an average of
the two, was 763.035.
The speed of sound, which varies according to
weather and altitude, was calculated yesterday morn

ing at 748.111 mph. The average of the two runs was
provisionally set at Mach 1.02.
The new mark broke the old record, set by Green
just three weeks ago, by 34 mph.
The two runs had to be made within an hour of each
other for the record to be official. Green made his sec
ond dash with about five minutes to spare.
When he throttled up for the return trip, the dust
cloud from his first run still hung over the desert on the
crisp, sparkling morning.
The sleek, black car broke the sound barrier twice
on Monday but missed the record books because a
problem with a drag parachute delayed the team and it
took 61 minutes to start the second run.
Noble considered making the record run on Tues
day, the 50th anniversary of Yeager's feat. But he
opted for the more favorable conditions of early morn
ing yesterday in the desert 125 miles north of Reno.
