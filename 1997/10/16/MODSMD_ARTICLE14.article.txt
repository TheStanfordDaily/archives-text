## Reno keeps campaign finance investigation open 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)
Assailed by House Republicans,
Attorney General Janet Reno
promised yesterday not to close
any avenue of her campaign
finance investigation without the
FBI director's agreement — an
unprecedented safeguard. But
GOP lawmakers insisted the inves
tigation "bristles with conflicts of
interest" and should be handed to
a special prosecutor.
During an occasionally testy,
daylong hearing before the I louse
Judiciary Committee, Reno
repeatedly said she was barred by
law from supplying details of what
her investigators were doing. "If I
could tell you what was being
done, I think you would feel much
more comfortable," she said.
Instead, she delivered for the
first time an extraordinary assur
ance not required by the indepen
dent counsel law: She has given FBI
Director I .ouis J. Freeh veto power
over the course of the investigation.
In the long history of the often-con
tentious relations between the FBI
and the Justiee Department, no pre
vious attorney general has publicly
shared authority so explicitly with
an FBI director.
Pressed by Republican lawmak
ers about reports that her prosecu
tors had prevented FBI agents
from interviewing top administra
tion officials, she repeated three
times that no allegation would be
dismissed without the personal
assent of Freeh, who has publicly
criticized the Clinton White I louse

mure than once.
The promise did not deflect
Republican demands for an inde
pendent counsel.
Chairman Henry llvde of Illi
nois asserted Reno's effort "hi is
ties with conflicts of interest"
because she must examine her
boss. President Clinton. Hyde said
public opinion polls show "the
average American wants an inde
pendent counsel."
Reno shot back, "I don't think
you or the American people want
polls" determining application of
federal law. "They want someone
doing the best single job they can."
She said she pays "no attention
whatsoever to politics or pressure."

Reno acknowledged her task,
force suffered early tensions and
fell behind in analyzing subpoe
naed documents. But she insisted it
is working to build a solid case by
traditional bottom-up investiga
tion.
She said she is prepared to seek
an independent counsel if evidence
emerges to warrant it, as she has
done four times previously for
senior Clinton administration offi
cials. "And 1 have never gotten in
trouble with the White House for
anything I have done," she said,
adding she was ready to return to
Miami if fired.
Rep. Bill McCollum, R Ma.,
however, sharply questioned "the
track record of the investigation."
1 le noted that a newspaper beat
Justice investigators to key evi
dence and that Reno recently
replaced the task force chief.
"Can you tell us why the Amer
ican people should believe you
when you say you're going to pur
sue every lead?" McCollum asked.
"What we are committed to do
is trying to pursue every lead ... and
make sure that before those leads
are closed out. Director Freehand
I have approved the closeout,"
Reno replied. "No door has been
closed."
Later, Reno's spokesman Bert
Brandenburg said her decision to
share authority with Freeh was
made last month when the task
force leadership was changed, but
Reno did not announce it until yes
terdav.
