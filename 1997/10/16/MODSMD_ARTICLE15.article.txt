# Athletes' status challenged
## 
### 
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — In a case that
could redefine the legal status of college ath
letes, a former Texas Christian University
football player who w;is paralyzed in a game
went to court yesterday seeking worker's
compensation benefits.
Alvis Kent Waldrep Jr., who hasn't
walked since a violent tackle nearly 23 years
ago, contends he wasn't just a student-ath
lete, but a university employee driving the
big-money business of college football.
"It's time that college athletics take care
of the kids who make it all possible," Wal
drep said as he entered court.
The 43-year-old father of two is suing
TCU's insurance carrier, saying he was an
employee who should gel lifetime worker's
compensation benefits for a debilitating
injured suffered while on the job.
A state agency already has sided with
Waldrep. But TCU's earlier insurance corn
pany has refused to pay, forcing the former
running back into court.
Waldrep, president of the National Paral
ysis foundation in Dallas, said the case isn't
about the money more than $25(),(XH) in
medical costs alone.
" The only way this is worth going through
is to change the N( AA," he said. "We know

this is going to go to the Texas Supreme
(ourt. It's going to be a couple more years."
Waldrep's injury came in a 41-3 I Cl I loss
at Alabama in 1974 on a sweep play late in
the second quarter. Waldrep, carrying the
ball, was forced toward the sideline where an
attempted tackle by a Crimson Tide defend
er sent Waldrep flying.
"I was turned in an awkward position and
came down head first on the artificial turf,"
he recounted in a 1993 interview. "I tried to
get up, but I wasn't getting up. It was fright
ening. . I felt tremendous pain in my neck,
and it was hard to breathe. It never occurred
to me I had broken my neck."
Al liist, T( 11 officials told Waldrep tliey
would help. When the costs of Ins continuing
medical treatment got 100 expensive, the uni
versity said it was not liable.
TCU spokesman Kick l.'Amie said it
would be inappropriate lot the lot I Worth
school to comment.
(iregory Whigham, an attorney for Texas
Employers Insurance Association, TClJ's
former insurance carrier, declined comment.
I or its part, the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association said it has changed, covet
ing student athletes under a catastrophic
injury insurance plan begun in 1992.
