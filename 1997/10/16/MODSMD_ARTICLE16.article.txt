## Editorial Senate makes a move 
### 
Holding ASSU meet
ings in dorm lounges
is a positive change.

WE BELIEVE that the ASSU Sen
ate's decision to hold its inaugural
meeting of the academic year in
Toyon Lounge was a positive change.
While the scene last Tuesday night may
not have been reminiscent of the Atheni
an agora, it was refreshing to observe the
Senate at work in the midst of its con
stituents.
Meeting in the Toyon Lounge was a
major break with the Senate's traditional
practice of holding its Tuesday night meet
ings in Room 190 of the Law School.
Although meetings are open to the pub
lic, few students have attended in the past.
While Toyon residents may not have
been thrilled with the concept of the Senate
using their lounge, there are a variety of
benefits to having the ASSU Senate meet in
dorms.
First and foremost, such a practice could
help dispel widespread misconceptions
about the ASSU Senate and its role in serv
ing students.
This is key because for the majority of
Stanford students, the ASSU Senate
becomes a forgotten entity once the cam
paign posters decorating dorm bathrooms
in the days prior to the ASSU's Spring Gen
eral Election are removed.
Apathetic feelings toward the Senate are
heightened further as students perceive that
the Senate is not doing anything tangible for
their lives.
Indeed, few students understand that the
Senate is charged with doing a large amount
of day-to-day management work. It debates
bills, approves appointments of students to

various University committees and appro
priates funds.
We believe that if students could contin
ue to see the Senate in action, they would
come to have more realistic expectations of
how the Senate can best serve them.
Not only does holding meetings in
lounges serve as a means of educating stu
dents about the Senate's role, it also encour
ages accountability on the part of Senators.
Because few students can actually identi
fy the Senate members whom they elected,
there is currently little need for accountabil
ity. Indeed there are few incentives for Sen
ators to work for our collective benefit
when no one seems to care about their
attendance records, much less about how
they participate in meetings.
Additionally, the presence of students at
such meetings could provide the Senate
with much needed ongoing feedback as to
the issues that are important to students.
Finally, the public setting of dorm
lounges will likely encourage Senate meet
ings to be run with greater efficiency and be
characterized by more civil behavior.
In the past, the Senate has been plagued
by poor time management and debates that
at times centered more around petty, inter
personal conflicts than around policy.
However, the Senate cannot assume that
simply moving their meetings into dorm
lounges will ensure them an audience. The
Senate must also do its best to make both
the issues under debate and the
omnipresent Senate lingo accessible to stu
dents in attendance.
In spite of complaints that the Senate's
presence in the dorm lounge inconve
nienced students wishing to watch TV, we
feel that the Senate should continue to meet
in dorm lounges. It is an admirable first-step
on the part of the Senate to reach out to the
Stanford community, and we hope that in
turn the community will respond in a con
structive manner.
