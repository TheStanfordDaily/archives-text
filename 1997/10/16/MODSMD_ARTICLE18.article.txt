## In search of mediocrity 
### 
A COUPLE OF
weeks ago at the
School of Educa
tion convocation, the dean
welcomed the new stu
dents gathered in Cubber
ley Auditorium.
As is traditional and befit
ting of such an occasion,
he recounted the impressive accomplish
ments of the school and the faculty, nation
al research centers, appointments in the
Department of Education and interesting
new course offerings.
He then announced that among the new
students, the school welcomed doctors,
lawyers and artists who have now chosen to
pursue degrees in education.
Of course, the message was to motivate,
congratulate and inspire: excellent people
have come to an excellent school to do excel
lent things.
I, however, heard a slightly different mes
sage: "What in the world are you doing here?"
Don't get me wrong: I don't begrudge my
new classmates in the slightest, but as I am
absolutely struggling to finish up my degree,
here are folks who already can save lives, fight
for justice and make things of beauty, and
now on top of that they're going to pick up
another degree? The degree I'll be lucky
enough to complete?!?
I know I'm not alone in pondering the
Admissions Committee scenario. Years ago,
somehow my application file was accidentally
placed in the wrong pile.
No sooner than the "fat letter" was sent
inviting me to pursue graduate studies at Stan-

ford did someone notice the error. The
school was too embarrassed by their
mistake to revoke my admission, so
everyone has been engaged in an
elaborate cover up worthy of an Oliv
er Stone feature.
The faculty have kindly allowed me
to proceed with my academic work,
assuming I am naively unaware of the big
snafu.

Many students soon grow out of this
phase, quickly recognizing their wonderful
gifts and their potential, and they realize
deep down that they too are excellent and
that they really do belong here. I didn't.
It doesn't help that other students in my

school are
unbelievable
teachers,
have won

prestigious fellowships and have had publish
ers court them to publish their dissertations
(one, in fact, before she had written word one
of her tome).
Add to that the school's faculty, some of
whom finished their own graduate work in
three years or less, wrote award-winning the
ses and crafted cutting-edge research while
finishing up their doctoral degrees.
I'm not worthy.
All right, enough self-flagellation. I know
I'm no slacker, and I'm no slouch: I can do
competent research; I'm a decent teacher, and
I come up with relatively interesting ideas.
But let's be realistic. If graduate students
were TV shows, I'm not the award-winning
"ER." I'm not the intellectual "Masterpiece
Theater," and I'm not the break-the-mold "X-
Files."
I'm also not the tragically overlooked "My
So-Called Life" or the well-respected "Cosby
Show." On the other hand, I'm also not the
bizarre "Manimal," or the inane "Nick Freno:
Licensed Teacher."
I think I'm more like "Newsßadio:" nei
ther ground-breaking nor highly-rated, but
basically decent, good-natured and earnest,
and just sort of hovering below the radar
screen. There's nothing wrong with that,
right?
Wrong. I sort of learned that as a Stanford
student I should be doing great things. And I
wasn't.
I went through the requisite excuses and
justifications phases: I could've done better
work if I didn't have so much to do for my
research assis-

tantship. I could've been a better TA if I
weren't so stressed about my own classes. 1
could've come up with a more interesting
dissertation if I only read a few more books.
I could've had something published if I
didn't watch so much TV. (Hey, someone
has to watch "Nick Freno.")
Yes, in the beginning there were high
expectations. And they begat disappoint
ment, which begat feelings of inadequacy,
which begat excuses, which begat fear. You
get the picture.
But no more! In contrast to the way
Kevin Kline's character is publicly outed by
Matt Dillon's character in the current film
"In and Out," I shall out myself.
I am a mediocre student. You see, upon
much thought and reflection, I have come to
a somewhat acceptable conclusion (note, not
an epiphany, not a stupid idea): there's no
shame in being mediocre.
There are just so few spots at the top of
that bell curve, and it's just so darn nice and
roomy way back in the middle. This is not to
say that people shouldn't try their hardest; we
just shouldn't be ashamed of our most
mediocre work.
Mediocre students of Stanford, unite! Let
us celebrate our mediocrity! Say it loud, say it
proud: we are mediocre! Let the others win
the awards and do the tremendous work, and
let us feel no remorse and no ill-will.
We shall toast our mediocre accomplish
ments with Shasta soda; we shall feast at the
Olive Garden, and we shall dance to Hootie
and the Blowfish. Let us challenge the cul-

ture of excellence that oppresses
us.
Let us go In Search of
Mediocrity. Let us seek the Seven
Habits of Highly Mediocre Peo
ple. Let us watch "Bill and Ted's
Most Mediocre Adventure."
We're mediocre people
coming to an excellent school to
do mediocre work. Wrong file in
the wrong pile or not — we're
here, we're mediocre, get used to
it.
