Fac Sen will act on
course guide
Concerning your editorial on course
evaluations in Monday's Daily, the faculty,
believe it or not, will act fairly promptly on
the above item.
It has already been incorporated into
our Senate agenda and will appear as an
action item for the Senate on Oct. 30.
1 have not yet seen the final proposal, so
1 will not try to second guess what C-AAA
will recommend.
Keep your shirts on and your eyes and
ears open!

Increased hours is not
the solution
While we agree with the author of the
Oct. 14 editorial on the point that there
are not enough places to study on a 24-
hour basis on this campus and that the
room provided within Meyer Library is
not big enough to accommodate all the

students requiring sueh space, there are
many points we would like to dispute.
Universities in this country have long
been aware that Fridays and Saturdays
have not been traditional times for study
or library use.
Libraries in most universities are
closed Friday and Saturday evenings,
because of the minority of students want
ing to study and use the library.
Come to Meyer after 5 p.m. on a Sat
urday and count the people in the library.
For Meyer to be even open as late as 9
p.m. on Saturday, thus extending the reg
ular SUL day, is a concession in itself to
the people wishing to actually use the
library resources on a Saturday evening.
This is done at a great expense to
Stanford and the SUL system. This is
because keeping the library open requires
at least one full-time supervisor, a student
to staff the second floor computer cluster
and the use of various utilities. We are
talking about some major expenses.
The editorial suggests that the library
need not be staffed during late nigh'
hours. This is not feasible due to the need
to keep our collections secure.
For example. Meyer library houses
about 12,(XK) videos, 500 laser disks, in
addition to books and reserve materials.

There are also personal offices, computer
and media equipment to be considered.
The risk would be too high in terms of
theft and vandalism. In plain terms, the
libraries were designed to be more than a
place to study. This is what the 24-hour
study room was designed for.
The 24-hour study room is a place with
nothing but desks and chairs where peo
ple can escape the distractions of ordi
nary Stanford life.
Unfortunately, this room is the only
one of its kind on the Stanford campus.
We have seen the sardines and smelled
their brine, and we agree that the scene is
not pretty.
Extending the hours of the libraries is
not the answer though. There needs to be
a cry for more rooms of this type spread
about campus. Find unused rooms with
outside entrances, and see if they can be
converted. Make a list of these rooms,
and go to the dean. The cost for this will
be minimal compared to opening a
library.
Of course, you are here to study, so
why not ask your neighbors to turn down
the radio or take the party elsewhere?
They should understand. Right?

Club's inspiration
appreciated
1 want to make a quick comment
regarding your delightful article regarding
the highly successful men's basketball Sixth
Man Club.
Due to the outstanding response and
success of this Stanford student-based club,
our women's volleyball program has creat
ed its own club â€” the "Spike Club."
This club would not have been possible
if we did not have an incredible model
from which to learn.
I would like to thank Jamie Zaninovich
and the entire men's basketball staff, past
and present, for creating this exemplary
student club.
This club is just one of the many rea
sons why our attendance is up. our season
tickets sales have doubled, and the
crowds are as "lively" as they are.
The main reason, however, is that Stan
ford Women's Volleyball is incredibly
exciting. So, Stanford students, come sup
port your fellow students on the court as
they try to defend "our" National Champi
onship.
We hope to see you at Maples on Hal
loween night when we play UCLA.

Questioning response
to band show
As a longtime Stanford employee I real
ly have to laugh at the furor over the
Band's dissing of Irish and Catholics at the
Notre Dame game.
Where are the anti-PC police now?
Where are all the outraged advocates of
free speech, the right-wingers who went to
court to overturn the "hate speech"
codes? Why is their silence so deafening
now?
If the object of the Band's distasteful
humor had been blacks, and African
American student groups had protested,
they would have been shouted down as
"politically correct," "hypersensitive," and
attempting to censor free speech and dis
course at Stanford.
But, because this time the victims of the
joke are white, well, that's a horse of a dif
ferent color!
