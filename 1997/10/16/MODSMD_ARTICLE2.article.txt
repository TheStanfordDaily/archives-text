# New Science Core gets dose of praise

Junior Zoja Deretic, a public
policy major, confidently describes
how particle physics determine the
way a laser reads CD music. She
can also measure the speed of light
by setting up a TV in front of
Memorial Church.
Deretic knows things about
practical science that some science
majors cannot fully comprehend.
The reason, according to Deretic,
is her enrollment last year in the in
augural class of Stanford's new Sci
ence Core.
Stanford initiated the core to
overhaul the way science is taught
to non-science majors and to give
these students lab experience, ac
cording to Russell Fernald, profes
sor of psychology.
Genetics Prof. Richard Myers,
added, "Our goal is not to turn
these students into scientists. We
want them to learn as responsible
citizens how [scientists] make deci

sions.
Students focus on one of three
themes — the heart, earth or light
— in the year-long program. The
themes "provide a vehicle for cov
ering all kinds of science," said Fer
nald. Within the course about the
heart, for example, students are
taught about DNA, genome pro
jects, metabolism, epidemiology,
physics and chemistry.
Deretic is still amazed by the
caliber of faculty and teaching in
the course. "Some science majors I
know were disgruntled that they
were giving senior professors to
non-science majors," she said.
Sophomore Evan Norby described
how his class of 20 students was
taught by four professors and four
teaching assistants.
Fernald explained that the team
approach is essential to the success
of the core. "No one faculty mem
ber is equipped to teach in all the
