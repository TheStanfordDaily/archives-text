# New Science Core gets dose of praise

Junior Zoja Deretic, a public
policy major, confidently describes
how particle physics determine the
way a laser reads CD music. She
can also measure the speed of light
by setting up a TV in front of
Memorial Church.
Deretic knows things about
practical science that some science
majors cannot fully comprehend.
The reason, according to Deretic,
is her enrollment last year in the in
augural class of Stanford's new Sci
ence Core.
Stanford initiated the core to
overhaul the way science is taught
to non-science majors and to give
these students lab experience, ac
cording to Russell Fernald, profes
sor of psychology.
Genetics Prof. Richard Myers,
added, "Our goal is not to turn
these students into scientists. We
want them to learn as responsible
citizens how [scientists] make deci

sions.
Students focus on one of three
themes — the heart, earth or light
— in the year-long program. The
themes "provide a vehicle for cov
ering all kinds of science," said Fer
nald. Within the course about the
heart, for example, students are
taught about DNA, genome pro
jects, metabolism, epidemiology,
physics and chemistry.
Deretic is still amazed by the
caliber of faculty and teaching in
the course. "Some science majors I
know were disgruntled that they
were giving senior professors to
non-science majors," she said.
Sophomore Evan Norby described
how his class of 20 students was
taught by four professors and four
teaching assistants.
Fernald explained that the team
approach is essential to the success
of the core. "No one faculty mem
ber is equipped to teach in all the
realms," he said.
Fernald distinguished team
teaching from "tag teaching." In
the track studying light, for exam
ple, all the professors and teaching
assistants always attend the classes,
rather than appearing only when
they are leading the course. Conse
quently, the faculty for this course
engaged each other, asked ques
tions and learned along with the
students.
"That they're teaching each
other is one of the things that
makes it so great for now,"

Deretic said.
Kelly Beck, lab and science co
ordinator for the core, acknowl
edged some drawbacks to team
teaching. Maintaining continuity in
the course can be "a logistical
nightmare," she explained. At the
beginning of the year, the teaching
teams plan how and when each of
the faculty members will teach
basic concepts. Faculty members
depend on their colleagues to fol
low through on that plan because
they rely on those concepts later.
Students enrolled last year also
observed room for improvement.
"Because it was a new class.. .it
wasn't always clearly organized,"
said sophomore Liza Bunker.

Nevertheless, Bunker observed
improvements being made
throughout last year. Beck added
that the faculty in each of the tracks
re-arranged the order of the topics
this year.
Norby also noticed the difficulty
the faculty had in coping with the
different levels of experience stu
dents brought to the course. In re
sponse, faculty are helping students
to be more aware of the differences
in their backgrounds, Beck said.
Funding for the core currently
extends only through the 1998-99
school year. Given the level of en
thusiasm shown by students and
faculty, Myers was surprised that
only 130 students enrolled this

year. "We are putting a lot of ener
gy into this for a relatively small
number of students." Myers added,
"One way to make it sustainable is
to have a whole bunch more stu
dents in these courses."
Deretic concluded that the core
"should be required for everyone,"
and she offers no apologies to sci
ence majors for enjoying the teach
ing of senior faculty.
"The science majors should re
alize that the non-science majors
may one day be making decisions
about funding their projects. You
become more friendiy toward sci
ence [after taking the Science
Core] because it becomes some
thing you understand," she said.
