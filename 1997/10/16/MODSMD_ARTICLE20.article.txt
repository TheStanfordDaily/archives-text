# Foriegn Bureau: Hong Kong
## Therese Lee Thailand: a "trip" to remember 
### 
MY FRIEND PAULA returned to
Stanford with 35 rolls of film,
unofficially moonlighting as a
photojournalist for her upcoming autobi
ography: My Chilean Semester Abroad.
I don't think I'll top her photogenic
excesses — but I did manage to take two
rolls of pictures in the past two weeks.
I took advantage of my fall break and
traveled through Thailand for 12 days.
It was an amazing trip — I returned to
my Hong Kong flat on Monday with a red
eye and a sprained ankle.
What wondrous adventures she must
have had, some would conjecture.
Indeed, I had a great time, covering
the country from Chiang Mai to Phuket.
I trekked in the Thai jungle for three
days and two nights and endured the feed
ing frenzies of insatiable mosquitoes. The
shameless parasites feasted on my legs.
My sleeping toes beckoned to them, "All
you can eat! Sweet blood and user-friend
ly epidermis."
My Hong Kong flatmates and I
trekked with a guide, for fear that we
would unwittingly cross the Thai-
Burmese border. I wasn't too excited
about that prospect — even though I was
in a passport-stamp collecting frenzy.
Suwan, our fearless leader, would talk

to us at night about the Northern Thai
land hill tribes and their struggle for exis
tence due to encroaching development. A
member of the Karen tribe himself,
Suwan also told us of its struggles in
Burma against SLORC and gave us an
overview of the political unrest there.
He explained about the corruption that
permeates the Thai police and told us of
the ills of opium addiction in the Thai
countryside. As 1 watched him in the flick
ering candlelight, I pondered the distance
between his reality and that of American
student activists who issue wide calls for
boycotts of irresponsible corporate invest
ment practices.
During the day, we hiked through mud,
crossed narrow bamboo bridges, rode ele
phants and went rafting.
And I emerged from it all with scratch
es and an intense appreciation of insect
repellent. You would think that my
injuries would have come from this little
adventure. But that wouldn't be compati
ble with the way my life happens.
My style of living / traveling is some
thing Td like to call (for lack of creativity)
"Therese-style."
It all begins with a unique brand of
accident-proneness. 1 first noticed it dur
ing my freshman year in high school. T hat

was the year my classmates saw me at my
worst. I got chicken pox that winter.
Dedicated as I was to my studies, I did
not wait for my large scabs to disappear
before I returned to class.
I would brave the taunting, pre
pubescent halls of John F. Kennedy High
again when I split my lip and chipped a
front tooth in a bicycle accident.
The collision had involved my face and
the cement sidewalk. 1 greeted people
with a half-smile for three weeks as I
waited for the dentist to fix my dead
tooth.
But as I have gotten older (and theo
retically more mature), I thought my
injuries would take on more sophisticated
roots. If I was going to suffer such unfor
tunate nuisances, they might as well be
done in style. Therese-style.
I thought I was going the right direc
tion with my eye injury last week. A burst
blood vessel or something. Not anything
serious, but nonetheless fun to look at in
disgust.
I was in Phuket. My timing was rather
good; I was visiting during the Vegetarian
Festival. This was a Chinese week long
event featuring firewalkers and mediums
win) climb bladed ladders. Thinking it was
not an experience to miss, my morbid self

attended the Buddhist festivities in the
hopes ot witnessing burning tlesh on coal.
1 wasn't so lucky. As I left the venue
mildly disappointed, 1 stopped to watch
two Chinese lions (the kind you see dur
ing Chinese New Year celebrations)
dance on the street.
A medium, dressed in gold cloth and
still m his trance, came to dance with twin
felines. He waved his flag back and forth,
sparring with the golden lion heads. 1
didn't know he was next to me; apparent
ly, he didn't either. But, then again, he
was the one in the trance. He whipped my
eye with his flag.
If that doesn't bring me good luck, 1
don't know what will. Too bad I'm not
Buddhist.
This was a classic injury rendered in
Therese-style. Not many can claim such
honors. It takes a real sense of karma to
develop something like this. I was rather
amused by this new injury. After all, it
made a great story — it had cultural ele
ments that showed my receptiveness to
other cultures (1 had learned about that
whole diveisity thing in C IV). It had dan
ger. It involved a guy in a trance.
But living life Therese-style doesn't
allow such glamour to last for long. The
story of the three legged horse comes to

mind. It captures the essence of my way of
living.
According to Ripley's Believe It or
Not, there once lived a three-legged horse
(probably named Tripod). It died when it
broke its only front leg.
My flatmate told me that story as I lay
stretched out on a hospital gurney, waiting
for a Thai doctor to X-ray my left foot I
would like to say that I had sprained my
ankle while climbing Erawan Falls, a beau
tiful seven tiered waterfall.
There's even an eighth tier that few
people find: tigers and monkeys live in this
untouched jungle. I would like to say that I
had hurt myself navigating through the
tropical fauna in search of this almost
mythical destination. It would have been
magic.
Instead, I am confronted with the mun
dane truth. 1 was late that morning for the
Erawan Falls public bus. 1 was running to
catch it with two minutes to spare.
I was taken down by a pothole at the
bus station.

Ihe res e Lee, a junior majoring in history,
would like to thank the hospital in Bangkok
for its hospitality and the obsolete wooden
dutches with no padding. With bruised
armpits and hands, she salutes them.

in a passport-stamp collecting frenzy.
Suwan, our fearless leader, would talk

to us at night about the Northern Thai
land hill tribes and their struggle for exis
tence due to encroaching development. A
member of the Karen tribe himself,
Suwan also told us of its struggles in
Burma against SLORC and gave us an
overview of the political unrest there.
He explained about the corruption that
permeates the Thai police and told us of
the ills of opium addiction in the Thai
countryside. As 1 watched him in the flick
ering candlelight, I pondered the distance
between his reality and that of American
student activists who issue wide calls for
boycotts of irresponsible corporate invest
ment practices.
During the day, we hiked through mud,
crossed narrow bamboo bridges, rode ele
phants and went rafting.
And I emerged from it all with scratch
es and an intense appreciation of insect
repellent. You would think that my
injuries would have come from this little
adventure. But that wouldn't be compati
ble with the way my life happens.
My style of living / traveling is some
thing Td like to call (for lack of creativity)
"Therese-style."
It all begins with a unique brand of
accident-proneness. 1 first noticed it dur
ing my freshman year in high school. T hat

was the year my classmates saw me at my
worst. I got chicken pox that winter.
Dedicated as I was to my studies, I did
not wait for my large scabs to disappear
before I returned to class.
I would brave the taunting, pre
pubescent halls of John F. Kennedy High
again when I split my lip and chipped a
front tooth in a bicycle accident.
The collision had involved my face and
the cement sidewalk. 1 greeted people
with a half-smile for three weeks as I
waited for the dentist to fix my dead
tooth.
But as I have gotten older (and theo
retically more mature), I thought my
injuries would take on more sophisticated
roots. If I was going to suffer such unfor
tunate nuisances, they might as well be
done in style. Therese-style.
I thought I was going the right direc
tion with my eye injury last week. A burst
blood vessel or something. Not anything
serious, but nonetheless fun to look at in
disgust.
I was in Phuket. My timing was rather
good; I was visiting during the Vegetarian
Festival. This was a Chinese week long
event featuring firewalkers and mediums
win) climb bladed ladders. Thinking it was
not an experience to miss, my morbid self

attended the Buddhist festivities in the
hopes ot witnessing burning tlesh on coal.
1 wasn't so lucky. As I left the venue
mildly disappointed, 1 stopped to watch
two Chinese lions (the kind you see dur
ing Chinese New Year celebrations)
dance on the street.
A medium, dressed in gold cloth and
still m his trance, came to dance with twin
felines. He waved his flag back and forth,
sparring with the golden lion heads. 1
didn't know he was next to me; apparent
ly, he didn't either. But, then again, he
was the one in the trance. He whipped my
eye with his flag.
If that doesn't bring me good luck, 1
don't know what will. Too bad I'm not
Buddhist.
This was a classic injury rendered in
Therese-style. Not many can claim such
honors. It takes a real sense of karma to
develop something like this. I was rather
amused by this new injury. After all, it
made a great story — it had cultural ele
ments that showed my receptiveness to
other cultures (1 had learned about that
whole diveisity thing in C IV). It had dan
ger. It involved a guy in a trance.
But living life Therese-style doesn't
allow such glamour to last for long. The
story of the three legged horse comes to

mind. It captures the essence of my way of
living.
According to Ripley's Believe It or
Not, there once lived a three-legged horse
(probably named Tripod). It died when it
broke its only front leg.
My flatmate told me that story as I lay
stretched out on a hospital gurney, waiting
for a Thai doctor to X-ray my left foot I
would like to say that I had sprained my
ankle while climbing Erawan Falls, a beau
tiful seven tiered waterfall.
There's even an eighth tier that few
people find: tigers and monkeys live in this
untouched jungle. I would like to say that I
had hurt myself navigating through the
tropical fauna in search of this almost
mythical destination. It would have been
magic.
Instead, I am confronted with the mun
dane truth. 1 was late that morning for the
Erawan Falls public bus. 1 was running to
catch it with two minutes to spare.
I was taken down by a pothole at the
bus station.

Ihe res e Lee, a junior majoring in history,
would like to thank the hospital in Bangkok
for its hospitality and the obsolete wooden
dutches with no padding. With bruised
armpits and hands, she salutes them.
