# Stadium bike parking expands
## 
### Brian Woo 
With a record number of football fans leaving their
hikes with the free parking service at Stanford Stadium,
the volunteer parking program is undergoing an expan
sion.
At the game against Notre Dame Oct. 4, the Silicon
Valley Bicycle Coalition â€” an activist group which aims
to make bicycling in the area safer and more convenient
parked a record 1,054 bikes. I"his surpassed the pre
vious record of 1,029 bikes parked at the 1995 Big Game.
To satisfy the increasing demand, the coalition is
adding a fourth corral for parked bikes and has added
parking service to night games this season, according to
1 lien Fletcher, vice president of the coalition and man
ager for bike parking at Stanford Stadium.
The idea for a bike parking service for home football
games originated after the World Cup matches at Stan
ford Stadium in 1994. Patrick Siegman, Class of' 94, and
the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition worked together to
provide people attending the World Cup games a safe
place to park their bikes.
The successful parking service that summer prompt
ed the coalition, along with the Athletics Department, to
offer a free bike parking service at home football games
that season.
Bike parking service is available at each home foot
ball game, starting an hour before kickoff and lasting
until 30 minutes after the game ends, Fletcher said. The
service is available to anyone attending the game, and all
non-motorized vehicles can be parked. For example, at
the Notre Dame game, the coalition also parked
strollers, wheelchairs, a wagon, a car seat and a pair of
rollerblades.
At present, there are three corrals available for bike

parking, each manned by two volunteers from the coali
tion. At the Big Game, three volunteers watch over each
corral.
With the addition of one corral and the expansion of
another, there will now be 10 volunteers watching over
bikes at each home game, with at least 15 on hand for
this year's Big Game. The four corrals will be located at
gates two, six, nine and thirteen.
Rob Thompson, director of events and operations at
the Athletics Department, said he finds the parking "a
very valuable service for an alternative mode of trans
portation to the football games."
The service, he said, provides more security for bikes
and alleviates traffic congestion, since locals can bike in
stead of drive to games. The Athletics Department
makes donations to the coalition in gratitude for its ser
vice. The service is also available at the international
soccer games occasionally held at Stanford Stadium and
at the annual East-West Shrine football game.
The Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition was formed in
1970. It is an organization which aims to improve biking
in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. Some of the
coalition's accomplishments include making room for
bikes on public roads and facilitating the allowance of
bikes on public transportation.
In 1980, thanks to the efforts of the coalition, bikes
were allowed on the Foothill Expressway. Bikes were
permitted on Caltrain in 1982. That same year, Dumb
arton Bridge became accessible to bikes.
Further advances occurred in 1988, when bikes
were allowed on the trolley system in San Jose and in
1996, when a bike rack was installed on the Dumb
arton Express bus. The coalition is currently work
ing to make Bay Area expressways accessible to
bikes.
