## Will women's hoops go commercial? Potential deal with commercial radio station being negotiated 
### 
Prior to last year's NCAA Tournament
sub-regional at Maples Pavilion between
Montana, Texas Tech, Howard and Stan
ford, KGVO in Missoula, Mont., hosted a seg
ment previewing each team's chances on the eve
of the NCAA tournament.
Joining Montana play-by-play announcer
Brian Prawitz were Ryan Hyatt of KMMX in
Lubbock, Tex., and KZSU's own Jeremy Stone,
last season's voice of Cardinal women's hoops.
What's wrong with this picture?
Stanford was the only non-commercial sta
tion of the three.

It's true. Despite seven Pacific 10 Confer
ence titles, six Final Four appearances and two
national championships this decade, Tara Van-
Derveer's consistently solid squad has never
been broadcast on a commercial station over a
full season.
Sure, there was a half-hearted attempt dur
ing the 1994-95 season, when KEST 1450 AM, a
small Chinese-language station, simulcast a se
lect few of KZSU's broadcasts. Unfortunately,
it was not successful enough to continue.
That could be changing very soon. With the
official opening of basketball practice on the
horizon and the season opener a little more than
a month away, negotiations between the De

partment of Athletics and several radio stations
have been taking place since mid-summer in an
attempt to make a flagship station for Stanford
women's basketball a reality.
"We feel the time is right for women's bas
ketball on the radio, and it's something we're
working on," said assistant athletic director
Gary Migdol, who is handling the negotiations.
Although he d< clined to disclose which radio
stations are in the running for the Stanford
women's basketball package, one potential can
didate could be KBPA 1220 AM. This station
has picked up the rights to broadcast the San
Jose Lasers of the American Basketball
League, whose season started last night against
Kate Starbird and the Seattle Reign. That said,
it would seem logical to think that KBPA would
fit Stanford's criteria for a commercial radio sta
tion.
"Our goal is to reach as wide an audience as
possible, first and foremost," Migdol said. "We
consider ourselves a Bay Area team and we
need to allow our fans to be able to listen to us."
But there is yet another twist to the story. Po
tentially, KZSU — Stanford's S(X)-watt, non
commercial campus radio station — would be
involved in this commercial radio deal for at
least one season. KZSU studio engineer Mark
Lawrence says he's been in touch with Migdol
for two weeks discussing the feasibility of pro
viding his station's feed to a commercial radio
station.
According to KZSU Sports Director Ray
Salloom, regardless of which station ends up
picking up the rights, KZSU would be involved
in some capacity.
Salloom confirmed that the flagship station
would use KZSU's broadcast feed with KZSU
announcers, provided that KZSU covers travel

expenses and the flagship station pays for equip
ment. The new station would also air its own ad
vertising while KZSU would continue to run its
underwriting carts, the non-commercial equiva
lent of an ad.
"It would mean more exposure for KZSU,"
Salloom said of the potential deal. "We're hop
ing that by exposing KZSU to a broader audi
ence, it will maybe get more listeners for other
sports (broadcast by KZSU)."
"Basically, if this goes through and continues
past one year, it would be great for KZSU."
Not only could it benefit the campus radio
station, the women's basketball program is not
exactly frowning upon the prospect of commer
cial radio.
"We've been trying to get commercial radio
for years," said Stanford assistant basketball
coach Amy Tucker. "The main thing is that
we're hoping it will increase awareness and
maybe have some new listeners who are inter
ested in coming to a game instead of listening."
"It doesn't mean that we're not happy with
campus radio, because they've been great,"
Tucker continued. "It's just a means for us to
sell our program locally. We're recruiting fans,
not players."
Although it's not official yet, it's the closest
thing to a legitimate commercial radio station
that the Cardinal women have seen. Sure, it's
still light years away from defending national
champion Tennessee's 13-station radio network
or Texas Tech's 12-station juggarnaut, but one
has to start somewhere — even if it's long over
due.
