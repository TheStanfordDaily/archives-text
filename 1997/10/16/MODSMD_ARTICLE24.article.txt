# Bay Area native hopes to put on a show

Superstar Jerry Rice was a hero for
thousands of youngsters growing up in
the Bay Area.
Lenzie Jackson was one of those kids.
But the 6-foot, 186-pound wide re

until many years later. Instead, the na-

tive of Milpitas, Calif., idolized another
All-Pro who starred at his customary po
sition.
"I really looked up to Jerry Rice,"
said the Arizona State junior. "He went
through all those games without any in
juries and he caught almost anything
they threw to him.
"I was a big fan of Eric Dickerson.
That was my idol when I was smaller...
Walter Payton. Tony Dorsett and guys
like that."
Jackson played tailback until he was a
junior at Milpitas High School. Then he
became a wide receiver.
It was a smooth transition.
"It didn't take me long to get used to
that conversion," Jackson said.
As a senior he was selected the Most
Valuable Receiver in the Santa Clara
Valley-DeAnza Super League after
catching 29 passes for 4K4 yards and
seven touchdowns.
And it didn't take long for Jackson to
make an impact as a Sun Devil.
As a freshman in 1995, he played in
10 games and had six receptions for 37
yards. Last season as a sophomore, he
made 36 catches for 505 yards and three
touchdowns and shined in Arizona
State's 19-0 upset of then-No. 1 Nebras
ka (eight catches for 105 yards).
Sun Devils' offensive coordinator
Dan Cozzetto is more than pleased with
the production <»t Jackson, who has be
come the No. 1 target of redshirt fresh
man quarterback Ryan Kealy.
"He's been everything we thought he
would be when we recruited him,"

Cozzetto said. "He's come along at the
pace we thought he would. He per
formed well as a sophomore and we look
for great things out of him as the years
come.
"I think he's the best receiver in the
Pac-10. We just need to get the ball to
him more. He h;is all the characteristics
of a great wide receive! He does every
thing. He's very coachable. He runs
great routes, and (has) tremendous
speed. We just need to make him our big
play guy."
Cozzetto is not the only one compli
menting Jackson.
"We all know that Lenzie's piobably
one of the toughest guys on the team,"
fellow wideout Ricky Boyer said. "He'll
go across the middle and take a hit to
make sure he'll catch the ball."
Additionally, in football circles
across the country, Jackson has been
mentioned as an up-and-coming star
Several magazines have listed him as
one the top 20 receivers in the country.
Lindy's Pac-10 Football Annual named
Jackson the 13th-best receiver in the
country.
Said Jackson: "I think I do rank
among the best receivers out there. I do
believe that."
However, believing he's good isn't
what motivates Jackson. Returning to
Pasadena is what inspu es the easy-going
fellow.
"It's something that's in the back of
my mind," he said. "But I really can t
dwell on that too long because it's a
whole new season. It's a good feeling so
1 want to get back there. That kind of
pushes me getting the job done."
Boyer pushes Jackson to play harder,
and vice versa.
The two receivers met as freshmen
and have been good friends ever since.
"When I moved into the dorms,
Lenzie was the first person I met,"
Boyer said. "Lenzie and 1 have gotten to
know each other real we 11... We talk a
lot about our different routes and our
different breaks and everything.
"Every time Igo to practice I |usl like
to watch him run his routes If I d< some
thing wrong, I just goto the sideline and
ask, 'What did I do wrong? What can I
do to get it better?' Or he'll come and
ask me, 'How did that look?' "
Despite having what many experts
call the best receiving corps in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference, the Sun Devil re-

ceivers haven't had a breakthrough
game yet.
There's an explanation for that,
according to Jackson.
"I think more than anything
penalties have been hurting us, be
cause that hurts the play calling be
cause it limits us to what we can do,"

Jackson said.
Jackson admits that he's anxious
to show what he can do against Stan
ford on Saturday.
"1 think the receiver has to have
the mentality that ball is mine no
matter where it is. 1 proved that 1 can
go across the middle, that I can take
a hit and come down with the ball. It
takes a lot of guts to do that, so I've
taken pride in it."
What will make Jackson proud

this week is hooking up with Kealy
all afternoon in Stanford Stadium.
"We need to get it to him on
some bigger plays," Kealy said.
"He's a big-play receiver."
If things go as planned, Jackson
won't be just idolizing Jerry Rice —
he'll be imitating him in the NFL
someday.
