eDear Health Forum,
I'm finding it hard to
find worthwhile campus
food that is healthy, and I
can see that I'm starting to gain
weight. I've been thinking about
starling on one of those "Jenny
Craig" or "Weight Watchers"
diet plans, but I remain skeptical.
What do you think?

A Laura,
I know that the cam
pus dining hall selec
tions and food at the
CoHo can get monotonous after
a few cycles. One way to combat
the drudgery is to keep trying
new things, which is much easier
said than done, I know. But see if
you and some friends can get off
campus every so often for a meal.
Fresh Choice at the Stanford
Shopping Center, for example,
always offers a great selection of
heart-healthy salads, main cours
es and desserts; plus, it's relative
ly close to campus. If you find
yourself up in the city, see if you
can check out some of the Italian
cafes in North Beach, or if you
prefer, the Haight district has a
plethora of international hole-in
the-wall-places ranging from
Asian to Ethiopian.
As far as those national diet
plans are concerned, I am proba
bly as skeptical as you. If you feel
comfortable with their methodol
ogy and can afford the expense of
buying their foods, then you have
my blessing. I lowever, I don't
necessarily think that you need to
go about weight loss that way.
My main criticism with these
"chain" weight loss plans is that
they really don't seem to help
people where they need it most,
that is, in developing healthy
changes in their day to day
lifestyle. The best recipe for fat
loss (notice 1 said "fat loss," not

"weight loss") is to eat right,
don't over-eat and get aerobic
exercise regularly. Aerobic exer
cise includes slow, long-distance
types of exercise such as jogging,
walking and swimming.
To burn fat, you've got to
make sure that your total daily
energy expenditure is more than
your total daily intake. You can
do this effectively when you
avoid fat-laden foods like Big
Macs, Jumbo Jacks, etc. and keep
a regular exercise regimen.
If you need help setting goals
in this area of your life, you can
see a nutritionist at Cowell Stu
dent Health Services or a special
ist in cardiovascular health. They
can help you decide on the best
plan of action to take by analyz
ing your body fat percentage, cal
culating your resting metabolic
rate and evaluating over your
exercise regimens.
eDear Health Forum,
I play varsity sports at
Stanford, and I am
always looking for new
ways to get an edge on my best
performance. Does carbohydrate
loading the night before an event
really work? If so, what foods are
the best to use?
— Todd, '98
A Todd,
Unfortunately, eating
a big pasta dinner the
night before a big game
will not supply your muscles with
an extra dose of glucose the next
morning. The body's homeostatic
mechanisms (namely, liver func
tion) will automatically regulate
your blood sugar level over the
next few hours during the night
to its normal, maximum level.
True "carbohydrate loading"
however, is in fact a real, possible
method of increasing glucose
stores for a specific athletic event,


Katie Stokes — Daily
but the process is not without its
health risks. In a nutshell, the com
plete process takes about six days
and essentially fools the liver into

thinking that it needs to store extra
glucose in the body to maintain
homeostasis. The effect is short
lived, and the fruits of your labor
may cause you to sprain a muscle,
pull a tendon or do other damage
that might put you on the sidelines.
The best advice that I can give to

you is to have faith in your training.
Athletically trained muscles use
oxygen more effectively and will en
able you to increase the time before
you reach your oxygen (or VO2)
maximum, thus putting your perfor
marce past those of your competi
tors. Good luck.
