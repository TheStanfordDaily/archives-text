# Scientists link protein to obesity
## 
### Lynne Mercer 
Scientists at Stanford have identi
fied a protein that may lead to new
methods to control obesity. This
protein will likely join leptin, a pro
tein discovered in 1994 that causes
decreased food intake and weight
loss in obese mice, as a target for
drug companies working to find
solutions for obesity and other
metabolic disorders that cause
excessive increases or decreases in
body weight.
Mice with a mutation in the
"agouti" gene provided the clue that
led to the recent discovery. Agouti
protein causes melanocytes, skin
cells that produce pigments, to pro
duce yellow rather than black pig
ment. A pulse of agouti during hair
synthesis produces a yellow stripe in
the hair.
In the mutated mice, normal
agouti protein was expressed at high
levels all over the body, not just in
the skin. These mice had the yellow
stripe, as expected, but were also
surprisingly obese.
" This suggested that there might
be a similar protein that normally
affects body weight and whose
effects were mimicked in the mutant
mice," said Gregory Barsh, an asso
ciate investigator at Howard Hugh
es Medical Institute and an assoc.
prof, of Pediatrics and Embryology
at Stanford. He and his colleagues,
graduate students Michael Oll
mann, Brent Wilson and Julie
Kerns, and postdoctoral fellow
Yanru Chen, along with collabora
tors at the University of Michigan,
set out to find that protein.
By searching a DNA data base,
they were able to isolate a gene
from both mice and humans that
produces a protein nearly identical
to agouti, which they named agouti
related protein, or AGRP. The
researchers then injected the human
gene for AGRP into mouse
embryos.
The "transgenic mice" that
developed expressed AGRP
throughout their bodies and were
noticeably larger than normal as
early as four weeks of age. By matu
rity, they were 75 to 1(X) percent
heavier than normal mice that
lacked the gene.
Production of AGRP seems to
be regulated by leptin. Mice that are
leptin-deficient produce eight times
as much AGRP as normal mice.
"This implies that leptin suppresses
expression of AGRP," said Barsh.
Unlike leptin, which causes
decreased appetite and weight loss
in obese mice, the newly identified

protein causes increased appetite,
weight gain and increased body
length.
Barsh and his colleagues
demonstrated that AGRP blocks
specific melanocortin receptors
that are present in the hypothala
mus of the brain, an area implicat
ed in weight regulation. In their
unblocked state, these receptors
are stimulated by hormones called
u-melanocyte stimulating hormone
(a-MSH) and adrenocorticotrophic
hormone (ACTH) that circulate in
the blood.
"There is pretty good evidence
that stimulation of melanocortin
receptors in the brain leads to
reduced food intake," said Barsh.
"ITiese findings provide an addi
tional component of the pathway
involved in regulating body weight."
According to a recent editorial in
the New England Journal of

Medicine, obesity is a major health
problem that affects 5H million peo
ple in the United States and has
been directly implicated as a signifi
cant risk factor for heart disease,
high blood pressure, strokes, adult
onset diabetes and certain form of
cancer.
The economic consequences of
obesity are also staggering, and the
quest is on for a more complete
understanding of the complicated
cycle that regulates body weight and
a possible solution to problems
caused by excessive weight gain or
weight loss.
When leptin was discovered in
1994, scientists were hopeful that it
would provide a pharmaceutical
mechanism to control obesity. Dis
appointment followed, however,
when further investigations showed
that at least some obese people
actually have elevated levels of lep

tin in their blood and seem to have
developed a tolerance to leptin.
Although the exact mechanism,
of weight regulation has not yet
been established, the new finding^ 4
reported by the Stanford scientists
"suggest that one of the components
is ACiRP, and one is melanocortin
ni
receptor," according to Barsh. „
These findings suggest two new tar
gets of research by pharmaceutical
companies.
"Drugs that could inhibit either
the production or the action of'
AGRP could lead to decreased*"
weight," said Harsh. "Drugs that!
stimulate melanocortin receptors
could also be helpful in reducing*,
weighl gain," he added.
If such drugs could be developed,*
il may be possible to bypass leptin
entirely. I his could be welcome,
news lor millions of Americans!
