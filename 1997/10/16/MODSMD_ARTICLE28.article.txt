# Alcohol use merits concern
## 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
At a college campus like Stanford,
alcohol is a common component of
social activity. We see it everywhere —
at tailgates before football games, at
fraternity parties or at.dorm-sponsored
barbecues.
Immoderate consumption of alco-

hol, however, can dangerous activity. Alcohol is a
drug a central nervous system depressant similar in
its effects in heioin ind opium and to medically valu
able drugs such as valium.
A'lc - lost ilcohol primarily removes inhibitions,
lea lut i ■ .1- buzzed,' and lending to its popu
larity ,ii ocial gatherings. But, with larger doses, its
depress,! a etlect dominates, causing decreased muscu
lar coordination and lower energy levels.
At a hlood alcohol level as low as .04 percent, which
is half the level for someone 21 years or older to be
legally drunk, one begins to show impaired physiologi
cal activity.
Very high blood alcohol levels can even lead to coma
or death, a situation commonly termed "alcohol poi

soning." Stanford has already experienced a few cases
of alcohol poisoning this year. Alcohol poisoning was
also responsible for the recent deaths of an MIT fresh
man and a student at Louisiana State University.
"I feel that with the grace of God we're not in the
news," said Elise Lenox, director of alcohol and other
drug prevention programs at Cowell Student Health
Services. "It could have been one of us — that's the
reality."
Both students were hinging on alcohol, a common
and dangerous pattern of occasional but heavy drink
ing. By loading the body with alcohol faster than it can
process it, hinging diminishes the drinker's motor and
intellectual skills and general alertness. This behavior
may also lead to cardiac arrest and respiratory failure.
The blood stream quickly absorbs any ethanol, the
type of alcohol in alcoholic drinks. Because the liver can
only metabolize a given amount of ethanol in a given
amount of time, consuming too much alcohol quickly
causes ethanol to build up in the blood stream.
The blood stream then carries the ethanol to all parts
of the body and in particular to the nervous system,
where it inhibits neurotransmission.
Though actual rates vary by body weight, a normal,
healthy 150-pound adult can metabolize above one
third ounce of pure ethanol an hour, about as much as
in a 1 -ounce shot of 80-proof whiskey, a 4-ounce glass of
wine or a 12-ounce bottle of beer.
Other factors can affect the amount of alcohol in the
blood by lowering the rate at which the body absorbs
alcohol. Drinking more diluted alcoholic beverages and
drinking with ftxxl slows absorption. Sleep and stress
also change absorption rates.
Binge drinkers also have more alcohol-related prob
lems than non-binge drinkers. While only 13 percent of
non-binge drinkers do something they regret while
drinking, 82 percent of frequent binge drinkers report
doing so.
At Stanford about 28 percent of students identify
themselves as binge drinkers, defined as those who have
binged at least once in the past two weeks. The nation
al average for all college students is 44 percent.
