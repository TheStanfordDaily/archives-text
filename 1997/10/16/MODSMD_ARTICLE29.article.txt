Ecological theory should impact
environmental decisions

Biology Prof. Jonathan Rough
garden is currently collaborating
with Economics Prof. David Star
rett to try to make ecological theory
a significant part of the bargaining
process in situations that determine
the fate of natural areas. He consid-

ers his work to be a synthesis of ideas common to
both ecology and economics.
"We're trying to get ecological knowledge used in
environmental design and policy analysis more than it
is," Roughgarden said.
Roughgarden added that while most decisions
about resources and species are made by competing
advocates, he would like to see ecological theory uti
lized in policy debates so that people could under
stand the effects of proposed decisions and the conse
quences of engineering measures.
He said that the goal of his research "would be to
enable people to design a management plan for natu
ral ecosystems as uncontcntiously as a civil engineer
would design a bridge."
In addition to this research, Roughgarden is also
teaching a freshman seminar on sex and gender,
which he classifies as his other major field of interest.
Next year, Roughgarden will take a sabbatical during
which he hopes to write a book on the subject, tenta
tively titled "Natural Sex and Gender."

Medumism for detection of
symbiotic partners under research

Biology Prof. Sharon long lias
been studying the phenomenon of
symbiosis in plants and bacteria lor
almost 16 years at Stanford, and her
lab is currently using a variety of
techniques to answer new questions
about the process. One ol her lab's

newer projects investigates how the symbiotic part
ners recognize each other using chemical signals.
Rhi/obium bacteria and alfalfa plants that she
studies in her lab differ from humans because neither
symbiotic partner has a nervous system with which to
sense the outside world.
According to long, the alfalfa plants manufacture
flavonoids, which are small hydrophobic chemicals.
The bacteria recognize the presence ol flavonoids to
determine whether or not their symbiotic partners arc
present. In response to the flavonoids, bacteria begin
to express a new set of genes to make en/ymes that
catalyze the formation of sugar messengers called
oligosaccharides that return to the plant.
"One of the things we've found is that plants
respond to oligosaccharides by rapid periodic changes
in calcium levels inside the cells," which indicates that
the oligosaccharides initiate a cascade of events called
a signal transduction pathway, Long said. Ihe result
of the signal transduction pathway is the eventual lor
mation of nodules that house the Rhi/obiuni bacteria.
Long's lab is also researching the exact mechanism
involved in signal transduction. "We're trying to find
out what genes in the plants are responsible lor mak
ing the symbiotic nodules," she said.
Discovering what genes are responsible lor caus
ing nodule growth would help biologists understand
more about plant development processes because
nodule formation is a process that disrupts normal
cell growth, long added. According to long, by
examining what processes of cell growth are dis
turbed, biologists may be able to discover more
about how cell growth and division occur in normal
plants.
