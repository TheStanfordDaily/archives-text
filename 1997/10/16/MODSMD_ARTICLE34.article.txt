# Laser cooling and trapping of atoms
## 
### 

In Chu's experiment, he set up laser beams shooting photons in three directions. An atom trapped in
the middle absorbs a photon, which slows down its velocity. A short time later, the atom emits the
photon, the recoil of which increases the atom's velocity. After this happens repeatedly, however, the
atom's average velocity will be slowed down. By adding a magnetic field, the atoms are drawn into
one region and captured. The technique lias applications in physics and biology.
