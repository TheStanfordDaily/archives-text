## Der 						Fliegende Holländer 
### Benjamin Lawrance Contributing writer 
San Francisco Opera's production of Wagner's "Der Fliegende
Hollander" ("The Flying Dutchman") is bold and stark, and compli
mented by a rich, resourceful cast. The production, a reworked
Geneva Opera original, is the debut for this European production
team.
"The Flying Dutchman" is perhaps an unusual choice for an
opening season Wagner. Long, morose and heavy, it ends rather
abruptly. But what it lacks in dynamism, it recuperates in romance.
From a libretto of Wagner's own creation, based on a Heine poem,
this is youthful, florid Wagner.
On a coastal stretch of Norway, Daland the captain (Franz Hawla
ta) complains of being blown off course. The steersman keeps watch
but soon falls asleep. Through the rich, misty orchestration — under
the sympathetic baton of Michael Boder — another captain be
moans his devil's curse. He must sail the seas for eternity: only the
faithful love of a woman can free him. Returning, Daland notices a
foreign ship. He welcomes the mysterious captain, offering shelter
and an introduction to his daughter, Senta (Jeanne-Mich£le Char
bonnet).
The village women sing merrily of their husbands' reti'rn. As they
sew, Mary notices her bewitched Senta preoccupied by the tale of the
flying Dutchman. The others mock her and her betrothed, Erik
(Gosta Winbergh). Mary refuses to retell the tale, so Senta gives her
own version. She vows to free the cursed Dutchman.
Not believing what he has secretly overheard, Erik begs Senta for
her love. Then he tells of a bizarre premonition: her father will return
with a stranger, who will carry her off to a ship. Her father indeed en
ters with a strange man. The Dutchman and Senta are transfixed by
each other. Daland delights at the prospect of a rich wedding.
Alone, they declare their love in a chillingly resonant duet. Though

the incognito Dutchman has his doubts, Senta allays his fears.
In the final scene the sailors celebrate success. A famous choru
accompanies this baudy scene, but it is soon overshadowed by th
ghostly Dutchman's crew. A final piercing jibe sends the villager
scurrying.
Erik pleads with Senta for her return. The Dutchman, overhear
ing, believes himself betrayed and cries farewell. Senta flies at him t<
explain and as he exits, she affirms her love and saves his 50u1....
A masterful Morris commands the title role. His power and deptl
create a remarkable Dutchman. His intensity in the final scene i
breathtaking, and his presence never fails to impress. Likewise, Char
bonnet's portrayal of Senta, is a powerful and convincing creation
She delivers the duets with emotion and serenity, but alone rises ani
fills the theatre. Both sing precise and clarion German; an intense en
joyment for those averse to surtitles. Erik (Winbergh) and Dalani
(Hawlata) also deserve particular mention.
Without a doubt though, enjoyment of this production is less
ened by the production's stark simplicity. Dullness and gloom in set:
and lighting may be appropriate, but the endless parade of grays b)
Pierre Strosser was tiring and burdensome. For the singers them
selves, this was evident. Swamped in mist and moodiness, Morris ant
Charbonnet seemed merely limp flesh. It behooves a designer wh(
employs such misery to energize the singers and chorus.
There were also curious blips in the minimalist staging. A pot-bel
lied oven, for example, filling the second scene with an eternal chim
ney, was awkwardly inappropriate. But while the actual presence of £
ghost ship may have enhanced the production, the off-stage ghosi
chorus worked well. The audience distinctly searched for its origii
and whereabouts.
SFO offers a rare and exciting experience with "The Flying
Dutchman," and it is warmly recommended.
The production runs October 17, 21 and 25. For further infor
mation and ticket availability call (415) 864-3330.
