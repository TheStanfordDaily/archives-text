## Amadeus Trio Hits Their Stride 
### Kyle Weaver 
When violinist Timothy Baker dug into
the strings of his unique "guitar" Stradivar
ius (made in 1725) for the opening of
Brahms' Trio in C minor, he shredded his
bow with the effort.
The Amadeus Trio performed to a
packed audience at Dinkelspiel Auditori
um at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 12. It was
another installment of the 1997-98 Stan
ford Lively Arts Performing Arts Season,
but at $25 a ticket, students were conspicu
ously absent.
Horsehairs flying, the trio completed
the first movement of the Brahms with
symphonic energy. At times, the strings
took on the sound of brass, especially when
cellist Jeffrey Solow gave full voice to his in
strument. And Marian Hahn, on piano, did
a brilliant job of carrying the melody, ac
companying the strings and even beating
out percussive rhythms on the lower reach
es of the keyboard.
Brahms rarely left unambiguous com
ments on his works. He was especially
averse to metronome marks. Brahms once
even wrote to a friend, "I myself have never
believed that my blood and mechanical in
struments go well together." To a student,
he commanded, "Do it the way you like it,
but make it beautiful."
The Amadeus Trio clearly had these
thoughts in mind when they performed
on Sunday, during the lOOth-year an
niversary of his death. Brahms would
have appreciated the performance — they
played his music as blood and beauty de
manded.
But at times their commitment to accu

racy held them back from personal inter
pretations, despite their obvious passion. In
rendering truly passionate music, it is al
ways a delicate balancing act to give full
weight to the emotions of the music with
out over-exposing them (in other words,
without making it sound sappy and senti
mental). On Sunday, the Trio balanced the
two pressures with confidence, but clearly
thought it better to err on the side of cau
tion.
The third movement of the C minor, for
instance, is a classic Brahmsian lullaby.
While careful not to fawn over the melody,
it was a shame for the trio to leave it so soon.
Every so often, the music would reach a
poignant climax that could have been sa
vored for just a moment longer than the
Amadeus Trio allowed. Or maybe I'm just
getting sentimental.
In any case, the Brahms continued: from
a defiant, forceful opening to a more deli
cate, pizzicato second movement, through
the charming third, and culminating with a
syncopated, technically dazzling finale.
Brahms is never boring; indeed, the trio
showed him to be startling and unpre
dictable. By the end of the act, the audience
had been carried through a craggy musical
experience of carefully controlled emo
tions.
After all that, Mendellsohn's legacy to
classical music came across as a warm and
refined showpiece, more along the lines of
Lizst and Chopin. In fact, it was through
Mendellsohn that Jeffrey Solow found his
richest opportunity to demonstrate the
strength of the cello's voice.
The first movement shifts between two
very distinct melodies, and each seemed
most at home in the cello's rich baritone
range. In the second, the always elegant

Mendellsohn gave the performers a simple
and distinctly romantic melody in B-flat
major. Solow took advantage of that
melody to entrance the crowd; the move
ment ended with the audience holding its
breath.
The third movement was a Scherzo of
delicacy, charm and whirlwind speed — by
far the most technically difficult moment of
the concert. The finale brought on a bar
rage of notes that built up to an overpower
ing coda, saturated with animation and
ability. 1 liked it.
The performance continued through a
second Brahms trio that left the audi-

ence applauding loudly at the end.

The Amadeus Trio came hack

briefly to perform a short but

striking encore: a piece by
the Russian composer

Shostakovich, whose
heartbreaking

melodies seemed al
most out of place on
a cloudless after-

noon in California.
The Amadeus
Trio has existed
since 1988. This
particular combi-

nation of players
came together two

years ago at the Grand

Canyon Festival. At the
end of the concert, Timo-

thy Baker spoke on the

group's behalf, thanked the

Stanford Lively Arts for inviting

them to perform and expressed the

desire to play here again.

Next time, maybe there will be more of a
student discount.
