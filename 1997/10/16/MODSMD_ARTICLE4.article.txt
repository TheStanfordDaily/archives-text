# Chu captures Nobel in physics
## Third prize in three years for Stanford physics professors 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Ten minutes into Physics and
Applied Physics Prof. Steve Chu's
class on quantum mechanics this
morning, the excitement in the
room was making students antsy.
Finally, a student asked what
everyone wanted to know. "Pro
fessor," he called out, "could you
just tell us about laser cooling
since this is all in the book?"
Chu, who yesterday won Stan
ford's third Nobel Prize in Physics
in three years, agreed, and the
class settled in to listen to him ex
plain his work in trapping atoms
between laser beams and slowing
them to speeds at which they can
easily be studied.
Chu shared the prize, Stan
ford's second this year, with
Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of the
College de France and Lcole Nor
male Superieure in Paris and
William Phillips of the National
Institute of Standards and lech

nology in Maryland. The three
men worked on different aspects
of laser cooling.
The prize brings to 19 the total
won by Stanford professors
Hoover fellows, 14 of whom are
still living. Eight of the prizes have
been in physics, including last
year's win by Physics Prof. Doug
Osheroff for work on the super
fluidity of helium-3 and the 1995
win by Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center Prof. Martin Perl for
the discovery of the tau lepton.
"We are so delighted to have
this Nobel Prize go to Steve," Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
said yesterday at a press confer
ence. Chu served on the search
committee that brought Casper to
Stanford, which Casper gave as an
example of ( hu being a "wonder
ful university citizen" as well as a
scholar.
Like Osheroff, Chu teaches,
advises and works closely with

C'liu gives "lots of individual at

junior Aparna Hhatnagar. "Even
though lie's a well-established pro
fessor, he really cares."

cents wouldn't make the cut.
The winner himself thought he
was the victim of a joke when a
K( HS ieporter woke him up before
4 a.m. requesting an interview. He
declined to comment, but when the
second call came, he realized he ac

tually had won.
Chu did his prize-winning work
while at Bell Laboratories in New
Jersey in 1985. His experiments in
"optical molasses" — a condition in
which light is used to slow down
atoms as if they are moving through
molasses — were the first in the
United States, although two Stan
ford professors, Ted Hansch and
Nobel Prize winner Arthur
Schawlow, had written a paper
about the phenomenon in the
19705.
With his graduate students, Chu
currently is working on applications
of laser cooling to a variety of fields
including physics and biology.
Chu reacted with humility to the
praise he received yesterday. After
Casper introduced him, saying his
involvement in all aspects of the
University was "what is great about
Stanford and ... what is great about

Steve," Chu said, "I have a correc
tion to make.
"I'm really not a great physicist.
I'm the same guy I was yesterday."
In class — despite applause, a
"Congratulations, Steve" written
on the blackboard and a photogra
pher and camera crew — Chu made
a valiant attempt to continue with a
lecture on wave mechanics.
Senior Wade Degottardi, who is
taking the graduate-level class, had
not heard the news before he ar
rived for it at 11 a.m. Now, Degot
tardi said, he is expecting that "the
final's going to be really hard."
Doctoral student Joel Hensley
said having his adviser win the
Nobel Prize will be an inspiration to
him in his work.
"It makes you want to go back in
and do research," he said, "because
there's some effect. He's the direct
evidence."
