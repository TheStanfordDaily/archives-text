# Chu captures Nobel in physics
## Third prize in three years for Stanford physics professors 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Ten minutes into Physics and
Applied Physics Prof. Steve Chu's
class on quantum mechanics this
morning, the excitement in the
room was making students antsy.
Finally, a student asked what
everyone wanted to know. "Pro
fessor," he called out, "could you
just tell us about laser cooling
since this is all in the book?"
Chu, who yesterday won Stan
ford's third Nobel Prize in Physics
in three years, agreed, and the
class settled in to listen to him ex
plain his work in trapping atoms
between laser beams and slowing
them to speeds at which they can
easily be studied.
Chu shared the prize, Stan
ford's second this year, with
Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of the
College de France and Lcole Nor
male Superieure in Paris and
William Phillips of the National
Institute of Standards and lech

nology in Maryland. The three
men worked on different aspects
of laser cooling.
The prize brings to 19 the total
won by Stanford professors
Hoover fellows, 14 of whom are
still living. Eight of the prizes have
been in physics, including last
year's win by Physics Prof. Doug
Osheroff for work on the super
fluidity of helium-3 and the 1995
win by Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center Prof. Martin Perl for
the discovery of the tau lepton.
"We are so delighted to have
this Nobel Prize go to Steve," Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
said yesterday at a press confer
ence. Chu served on the search
committee that brought Casper to
Stanford, which Casper gave as an
example of ( hu being a "wonder
ful university citizen" as well as a
scholar.
Like Osheroff, Chu teaches,
advises and works closely with
