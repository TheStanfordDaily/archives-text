# Free At Last, Free At Last:
## The
						Artist celebrates his emancipation at Shoreline Amphitheater 
### Soren Johnson Staff writer 
"We must not become a slave to any
thing," The Artist Formerly Know As
Prince announced to the crowd at a sold
out Shoreline Amphitheater last Friday
night. He then launched into the aggressive
rap "Face Down," letting us all know exact
ly what he thought of the "motherfuckers"
at Warner Bros.
The Artist is finally free, and he wants us
to know it. Following the unlikely inspira
tion of Ani DiFranco, the Artist released
"F.mancipation" independently last year
after escaping his Warner Bros, contract.
As expected, the three-disc set could

have benefited from some serious editing.
While the album displayed his genius at
times, its colossal length killed any chance
of success.
The critics declared that the Artist had
finally committed commercial suicide.
However, what most people conveniently
forgot was that he had already thrown away
his mega-stardom years ago. After the bril
liance of "Purple Rain" catapulted Prince to
the level of Madonna and Michael Jackson,
he abandoned a style which virtually guar
anteed him a mammoth audience.
Instead, his follow-up albums "Around
The World In A Day"and "Parade" were
exercises in abstract pop mysticism, a re
treat from the new-wave funk that he had
brought to the mainstream. Prince's vision

was changing, and he was not afraid to
change with it.
Now, in 1997, The Artist is seen as a
strange artifact of the '80s. Few fans have
followed his musical quest, and as his cryp
tic behavior continued, the Artist risked
losing his core audience. Changing one's
name is one thing (many rock and roll
artists do); changing it to an unpronounce
able symbol is another thing entirely.
Nevertheless, the Artist's talent and ge
nius has not changed, as witnessed by
12,(XX) shivering fans last Friday night,
lumping across the stage in his tight, silver
outfit and high heels, clasping his gun
shaped microphone, the Artist was a bun
dle of energy unleashed.
Still a great stage presence, he flashed his

multiple talents throughout the night.
Flaying guitar, piano and bass, the Artist re
minded the audience that on many of his
albums, he played every note.
The 39-year-old can still dance like
James Brown and has one of the most as
tonishing vocal ranges in all of popular
music. Further, the Artist chose to present
nearly all sides of his musical personality,
from rap ("l ace Down") to ballads ("Scan
dalous") to funk ("Jam Of The Year") to
rock and roll ("When You Were Mine").
Whether playing with his full band, the
New Power (ieneration, or merely accom
panying himself on piano or guitar, the
Artist was fully in control of his ambitions.
