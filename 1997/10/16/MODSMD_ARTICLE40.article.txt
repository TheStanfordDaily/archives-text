# Free At Last, Free At Last:
## The 						Artist celebrates his emancipation at Shoreline Amphitheater 
### Soren Johnson Staff writer 
"We must not become a slave to any
thing," The Artist Formerly Know As
Prince announced to the crowd at a sold
out Shoreline Amphitheater last Friday
night. He then launched into the aggressive
rap "Face Down," letting us all know exact
ly what he thought of the "motherfuckers"
at Warner Bros.
The Artist is finally free, and he wants us
to know it. Following the unlikely inspira
tion of Ani DiFranco, the Artist released
"F.mancipation" independently last year
after escaping his Warner Bros, contract.
As expected, the three-disc set could

have benefited from some serious editing.
While the album displayed his genius at
times, its colossal length killed any chance
of success.
The critics declared that the Artist had
finally committed commercial suicide.
However, what most people conveniently
forgot was that he had already thrown away
his mega-stardom years ago. After the bril
liance of "Purple Rain" catapulted Prince to
the level of Madonna and Michael Jackson,
he abandoned a style which virtually guar
anteed him a mammoth audience.
Instead, his follow-up albums "Around
The World In A Day"and "Parade" were
exercises in abstract pop mysticism, a re
treat from the new-wave funk that he had
brought to the mainstream. Prince's vision

was changing, and he was not afraid to
change with it.
Now, in 1997, The Artist is seen as a
strange artifact of the '80s. Few fans have
followed his musical quest, and as his cryp
tic behavior continued, the Artist risked
losing his core audience. Changing one's
name is one thing (many rock and roll
artists do); changing it to an unpronounce
able symbol is another thing entirely.
Nevertheless, the Artist's talent and ge
nius has not changed, as witnessed by
12,(XX) shivering fans last Friday night,
lumping across the stage in his tight, silver
outfit and high heels, clasping his gun
shaped microphone, the Artist was a bun
dle of energy unleashed.
Still a great stage presence, he flashed his

multiple talents throughout the night.
Flaying guitar, piano and bass, the Artist re
minded the audience that on many of his
albums, he played every note.
The 39-year-old can still dance like
James Brown and has one of the most as
tonishing vocal ranges in all of popular
music. Further, the Artist chose to present
nearly all sides of his musical personality,
from rap ("l ace Down") to ballads ("Scan
dalous") to funk ("Jam Of The Year") to
rock and roll ("When You Were Mine").
Whether playing with his full band, the
New Power (ieneration, or merely accom
panying himself on piano or guitar, the
Artist was fully in control of his ambitions.
Most importantly, however, the Artist
has learned to deal with his past. As he has
abandoned musical styles as well as his own
name over the years, the Artist appeared to
be trying to escape the weight of his own
success.
Not only did he play a number of his
most popular songs ("1999," "Little Red
Corvette," "Raspberry Beret"), but he
reached back even deeper into his history to
perform "Let's Work" from 1982's "Con
troversy" and "When You Were Mine"
from the seminal "Dirty Mind" album of
1980.
Moreover, the Artist worked hard to
make his old music fresh. Although he
played nearly half of the "Purple Rain"
album, many of the songs were given a sim
ple piano-and-vocals arrangement. On the
previously mentioned "When You Were
Mine," he emphasized the rock-a-billy
roots of the song by accompanying himself

solely with his guitar, proving that his con
certs will never become exercises in Prince
nostalgia.
Still, the tension between past and pre
sent was evident at points. Although the
symbol that now serves as his name domi -
nated the background of the stage, music
clips from the beginning of his career sig
naled his entrance. Further, while this sec
tion included sound bites from "Let's Go
Crazy" and "Kiss," he performed neither
songs during the concert.
Most explicitly, the Artist actually joked
about his name change. After suddenly an
nouncing to the crowd that" I want to apply
for the position of king," he declared that
"There are no kings on this earth, only
princes." The audience naturally cheered at
this reference, but exactly why the Artist de
cided to toy with his identity once more is a
bit of a mystery.
However, Prince / the Artist has always
been a mystery. Indeed, the name change
itself may be more significant than most
cynics realize. To start with, 'Prince' was
never a stage name; he was born Prince

Rogers Nelson.
Although the Artist may have become
an easy target for arm-chair critics every
where, the likely truth is that he just doesn't
care. Neil Young may have convinced the
rock press that he was not commercial by
releasing a bunch of bad albums in the '80s,
but the Artist has always released his best
and worst work with little regard for at
tracting a mass audience. The bloated
"Emancipation" album is merely the latest
example, but the Artist has finally found his
freedom.
Indeed, that fact may have been all that
really mattered last Friday night. The Artist
loves his freedom, and that enthusiasm
made the concert a very exciting experi
ence. Despite the near-freezing tempera
ture, the crowd responded warmly, dancing
wildly to the irresistible "1999." Working
hard to draw the audience into the perfor
mance, the Artist encouraged the crowd to
sing with him. During the encore, he even
brought some of the audience on stage to
dance.
The Artist also provided the audience

with some unexpected treats, including a
powerful version of Joan Osborne's hit
"What If God Was One Of Us," which sug
gested the song works hotter as rock and
roll than adult-contemporary "folk"
music. Also, Carlos Santana made a sur
prise appearance for a guitar duel with the
Artist. The Artist introduced him as "one of
my heroes," and the connection between
the two goes back farther than one might
assume; Santana introduced Sheila E. to
Prince in the early '80s.
The two share a common goal of blend
ing genres. For Santana, the end result was
psychedelic salsa. For the Artist, the at
tempted combinations have changed many
times over the course of his career and will
undoubtedly change again.
Indeed, the Artist's curse may be that he
will forever be unsatisfied with what he has
accomplished. Perhaps his new-found
freedom will bring him the satisfaction
that he deserves. As long as his liberty in
spires performances as powerful and beau
tiful as last Friday, however, the Artist will
not have fought for his freedom in vain.

where, the likely truth is that he just doesn't
care. Neil Young may have convinced the
rock press that he was not commercial by
releasing a bunch of bad albums in the '80s,
but the Artist has always released his best
and worst work with little regard for at
tracting a mass audience. The bloated
"Emancipation" album is merely the latest
example, but the Artist has finally found his
freedom.
Indeed, that fact may have been all that
really mattered last Friday night. The Artist
loves his freedom, and that enthusiasm
made the concert a very exciting experi
ence. Despite the near-freezing tempera
ture, the crowd responded warmly, dancing
wildly to the irresistible "1999." Working
hard to draw the audience into the perfor
mance, the Artist encouraged the crowd to
sing with him. During the encore, he even
brought some of the audience on stage to
dance.
The Artist also provided the audience

with some unexpected treats, including a
powerful version of Joan Osborne's hit
"What If God Was One Of Us," which sug
gested the song works hotter as rock and
roll than adult-contemporary "folk"
music. Also, Carlos Santana made a sur
prise appearance for a guitar duel with the
Artist. The Artist introduced him as "one of
my heroes," and the connection between
the two goes back farther than one might
assume; Santana introduced Sheila E. to
Prince in the early '80s.
The two share a common goal of blend
ing genres. For Santana, the end result was
psychedelic salsa. For the Artist, the at
tempted combinations have changed many
times over the course of his career and will
undoubtedly change again.
Indeed, the Artist's curse may be that he
will forever be unsatisfied with what he has
accomplished. Perhaps his new-found
freedom will bring him the satisfaction
that he deserves. As long as his liberty in
spires performances as powerful and beau
tiful as last Friday, however, the Artist will
not have fought for his freedom in vain.
"We must not become a slave to any
thing," The Artist Formerly Know As
Prince announced to the crowd at a sold
out Shoreline Amphitheater last Friday
night. He then launched into the aggressive
rap "Face Down," letting us all know exact
ly what he thought of the "motherfuckers"
at Warner Bros.
The Artist is finally free, and he wants us
to know it. Following the unlikely inspira
tion of Ani DiFranco, the Artist released
"F.mancipation" independently last year
after escaping his Warner Bros, contract.
As expected, the three-disc set could

have benefited from some serious editing.
While the album displayed his genius at
times, its colossal length killed any chance
of success.
The critics declared that the Artist had
finally committed commercial suicide.
However, what most people conveniently
forgot was that he had already thrown away
his mega-stardom years ago. After the bril
liance of "Purple Rain" catapulted Prince to
the level of Madonna and Michael Jackson,
he abandoned a style which virtually guar
anteed him a mammoth audience.
Instead, his follow-up albums "Around
The World In A Day"and "Parade" were
exercises in abstract pop mysticism, a re
treat from the new-wave funk that he had
brought to the mainstream. Prince's vision

was changing, and he was not afraid to
change with it.
Now, in 1997, The Artist is seen as a
strange artifact of the '80s. Few fans have
followed his musical quest, and as his cryp
tic behavior continued, the Artist risked
losing his core audience. Changing one's
name is one thing (many rock and roll
artists do); changing it to an unpronounce
able symbol is another thing entirely.
Nevertheless, the Artist's talent and ge
nius has not changed, as witnessed by
12,(XX) shivering fans last Friday night,
lumping across the stage in his tight, silver
outfit and high heels, clasping his gun
shaped microphone, the Artist was a bun
dle of energy unleashed.
Still a great stage presence, he flashed his

multiple talents throughout the night.
Flaying guitar, piano and bass, the Artist re
minded the audience that on many of his
albums, he played every note.
The 39-year-old can still dance like
James Brown and has one of the most as
tonishing vocal ranges in all of popular
music. Further, the Artist chose to present
nearly all sides of his musical personality,
from rap ("l ace Down") to ballads ("Scan
dalous") to funk ("Jam Of The Year") to
rock and roll ("When You Were Mine").
Whether playing with his full band, the
New Power (ieneration, or merely accom
panying himself on piano or guitar, the
Artist was fully in control of his ambitions.
Most importantly, however, the Artist
has learned to deal with his past. As he has
abandoned musical styles as well as his own
name over the years, the Artist appeared to
be trying to escape the weight of his own
success.
Not only did he play a number of his
most popular songs ("1999," "Little Red
Corvette," "Raspberry Beret"), but he
reached back even deeper into his history to
perform "Let's Work" from 1982's "Con
troversy" and "When You Were Mine"
from the seminal "Dirty Mind" album of
1980.
Moreover, the Artist worked hard to
make his old music fresh. Although he
played nearly half of the "Purple Rain"
album, many of the songs were given a sim
ple piano-and-vocals arrangement. On the
previously mentioned "When You Were
Mine," he emphasized the rock-a-billy
roots of the song by accompanying himself

solely with his guitar, proving that his con
certs will never become exercises in Prince
nostalgia.
Still, the tension between past and pre
sent was evident at points. Although the
symbol that now serves as his name domi -
nated the background of the stage, music
clips from the beginning of his career sig
naled his entrance. Further, while this sec
tion included sound bites from "Let's Go
Crazy" and "Kiss," he performed neither
songs during the concert.
Most explicitly, the Artist actually joked
about his name change. After suddenly an
nouncing to the crowd that" I want to apply
for the position of king," he declared that
"There are no kings on this earth, only
princes." The audience naturally cheered at
this reference, but exactly why the Artist de
cided to toy with his identity once more is a
bit of a mystery.
However, Prince / the Artist has always
been a mystery. Indeed, the name change
itself may be more significant than most
cynics realize. To start with, 'Prince' was
never a stage name; he was born Prince

Rogers Nelson.
Although the Artist may have become
an easy target for arm-chair critics every
where, the likely truth is that he just doesn't
care. Neil Young may have convinced the
rock press that he was not commercial by
releasing a bunch of bad albums in the '80s,
but the Artist has always released his best
