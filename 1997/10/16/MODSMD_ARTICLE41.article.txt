# From Okada to Broadway:
## Stanford Alumnus David Henry Hwang Rockets into the Spotlight 
### Eric Leventhal Devin Oatway Contributing writers 
I'he celebrated career of David Henry Hwang, one of today's most
gifted playwrights, began with a dorm show in Okada during his se
nior year at Stanford. Shortly after his graduation in 1980, Hwang's
allan with stardom took shape with the success of his 1988 "M. But
terfly,'' a disturbing tale that explores the mythical relationship be
i ween Hast and West on a racial, sexual and cultural level. I'he Asian-
American playwright took some time last spring to speak with Inter
mission about the meeting of inspiration and commercialism in the
lifeol an artist.
How involved were you in the arts community at Stanford? What
was the arts community like when you were here?
i wasn't actually that involved with the theater department. I took
*»ome acting courses, but the theater department didn't offer any play
•vriting classes. Then, 1 started writing some plays in my spare time,
uul John L'Heureux, who is still a professor of English and for a while
vvas nead of the program in Creative Writing, was teaching a Drama
Literature class. I started showing him some of my plays, and he be
anie Kind of a mentor to me for the next couple years. We worked
>ui an independent study so I could major in Creative Writing with
in emphasis on play writing.
)ther than that, most of my involvement in the arts community
probably had more to do with working on dorm shows. I was a mu
sician, and 1 was working on a lot of musicals.
l ell us about the first play that you staged.
I'he first play 1 staged was a play called "F. 0.8.," which stands for
"Fresh Off the Boat.' 1 wrote it as a dorm show to be done at Okada,
which at the time was called Junipero. It was the Asian-American
theme house. We did it in the dorm for a couple nights, and I also sent
it to the National Playwright's Conference, which happens every year
in Waterford, Connecticut.
It got accepted to be done at the O'Neill, and it came to the atten
tion of Joe Papp, who has since passed away, but was probably the
great American theater producer of the last half of the 20th century.
He produced "A Chorus Line" and also created "Shakespeare in the
I'ark" in New York. He decided to produce the play off Broadway a
year after 1 graduated. It won an Obie, which is like an off Broadway
Tony Award.
Were there times when you had doubts about your future as a play
wright?
1 was really lucky to get a really nice break quite soon out of school.
There are lots of times when you wonder, "Am I a has-been?" I think
1 wondered in my mid-20s if 1 was a has-been because I went through
a period when 1 didn't have a lot of off-Broadway success. I've won
dered lately, "Well, am I going to have another hit that's as big as'M.
Butterfly'?" .So 1 think that's the sort of thing that an artist does worry
about from time to time. But I've always felt that I'm a good writer,
that all careers have their ups and downs.
When did you first realize you were a successful playwright? How
did you handle that realization?
As soon as I had my first play produced in New York, 1 felt pretty
successful. When this play "F. 0.8." was done by Joe Papp, 1 was 23 or
24 years old. To be that age and have your work done in New York is
pretty unusual. I had a series of plays done off-Broadway that Joe
Papp produced, which were mostly successful. Then 1 had a big flop
off-Broadway a few years later. In some sense, I feel like that was when

I knew I was always going to be a writer, ironically, because up to that
point my devotion to my craft hadn't really been tested. Now 1 was in
a situation where I wasn't getting the kind of reinforcement from
critics and audiences that I was used to, and yet I was still really glad I
did it.
Where do you find the inspiration for the ideas behind your plays?
I just try to get inspiration wherever 1 can. As a writer, I'm just so
grateful for having ideas. I'm looking for them at all times. Some
times they come out of my personal life. At the moment the play that
I'm workingon that's coming out in ihe fall is based on my family his
tory. 1 had felt like that was something I wanted to deal with at a cer
tain point in my life. Other times, it can be a newspaper article like
with "M. Butterfly," or sometimes it's a piece that somebody asks me
to write. That happens a lot with the movies that 1 work on: Some
body else has an idea and asks me to work on it, and if I find that in
teresting, I agree to do it.
What scripts have you written, and are you working on any right
now?
I sort of make my living writing movie scripts, even though I'm
better known as a playwright. The way the business of being a screen
writer works, you get paid to write a lot of things that end up not
being made. But I've had some great experiences working on scripts
that haven't been made: I've worked with Sydney Pollack on some
stuff, and I worked with Marty Scorcese. The movies that have been
made didn't really turn out very well. There was a movie version of
"M. Butterfly," which I'm not that happy with, that David Cronen
berg directed. As a screenwriter, I have the usual complaints about

not having enough control over my material, which is why it's nice to
be able to write plays, where they can't change any of the script with
out the author's permission.
Right now, I'm working on a Broadway musical, which I've never
done before, so that's kind of fun. And I have three movie scripts in
various stages of development: One is a picture I'm doing lor
Scorcese, which is a Bette Midler vehicle. Then I'm working on a pic
ture for lessica Lange, and I'm just about to start a movie lor Konin
Williams.
What kinds of ideas are you trying to communicate iu your audi
ence? How well do you think you've succeeded in doing so?
A lot of the work that I do has an Asian or an Asian-American
theme, and I suppose that that's kind of a personal exploration, about
trying to figure out who 1 am and also deal with some of my percep
tions on the conflicts and clashes between Eastern and Western cul
tures as they exist both in America and internationally. But probably
what I'm most concerned with is the issue of identity, which can be
looked at specifically in terms of an ethnicity, or in a more general
sense, in this question of' Who am I?' I think its sometning thai we
all ask in different ways.
As an American playwright, what, if anything, would you change
about the responses of American audiences to your playsf
I don't necessarily feel that I would change the audience. I think
the relationship between the artist and his or her audience is a dia
logue: Sometimes I understand them, and they understand me, and
sometimes we don't understand each other. What I would change,
though, would have to do with the relationship of critics to audi
ences. In most towns, a single newspaper becomes the dominant
voice and determines what an audience will or won't see. I think peo
pie follow critics too slavishly. "M. Butterfly" is a good example: We
opened in Washington, D.C. before we came to Broadway. We got a
bad review in the Washington Post, and nobody came to see the
show. Then as soon as the show comes to New York and gets a good
review in the New York Times, everybody thinks it's the greatest
[show].
Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
I think I'd probably like to have directed a movie by that point. Ill
probably write a play and a movie every year. I'd like to have at least
one other hit in the next 10 years.
What advice would you give to anyone our age who's considering a
career as a playwright?
Have your work seen, however you can do it. You learn so much
by hearing your words spoken. It's really an invaluable experience for
a playwright. And learn as much about the theater as you can. There's
no formula for commercial success, particularly in the theater. And
in a way that's good, because it means that we're forced to fall back on
writing what we're really interested in. If you write something you re
ally love, and it fails, you've still had the great experience of writing it.
But if you're just writing something to try to make it commercial, and
it fails, you're left with nothing. So you just have to write what you be
lieve.
Epilogue to M. Butterfly:
"M. Butterfly has sometimes been regarded as an anti-Amertcan
play, a diatribe against the stereotyping of the East by the West, of
women by men. Quite to the contrary, I consider it a plea to all sides to
cut through our respective layers of cultural and sexual misperception, to
deal with one another truthfully for our mutual good, from the common
and equal ground we share as human beings."

with "M. Butterfly," or sometimes it's a piece that somebody asks me
to write. That happens a lot with the movies that 1 work on: Some
body else has an idea and asks me to work on it, and if I find that in
teresting, I agree to do it.
What scripts have you written, and are you working on any right
now?
I sort of make my living writing movie scripts, even though I'm
better known as a playwright. The way the business of being a screen
writer works, you get paid to write a lot of things that end up not
being made. But I've had some great experiences working on scripts
that haven't been made: I've worked with Sydney Pollack on some
stuff, and I worked with Marty Scorcese. The movies that have been
made didn't really turn out very well. There was a movie version of
"M. Butterfly," which I'm not that happy with, that David Cronen
berg directed. As a screenwriter, I have the usual complaints about

not having enough control over my material, which is why it's nice to
be able to write plays, where they can't change any of the script with
out the author's permission.
Right now, I'm working on a Broadway musical, which I've never
done before, so that's kind of fun. And I have three movie scripts in
various stages of development: One is a picture I'm doing lor
Scorcese, which is a Bette Midler vehicle. Then I'm working on a pic
ture for lessica Lange, and I'm just about to start a movie lor Konin
Williams.
What kinds of ideas are you trying to communicate iu your audi
ence? How well do you think you've succeeded in doing so?
A lot of the work that I do has an Asian or an Asian-American
theme, and I suppose that that's kind of a personal exploration, about
trying to figure out who 1 am and also deal with some of my percep
tions on the conflicts and clashes between Eastern and Western cul
tures as they exist both in America and internationally. But probably
what I'm most concerned with is the issue of identity, which can be
looked at specifically in terms of an ethnicity, or in a more general
sense, in this question of' Who am I?' I think its sometning thai we
all ask in different ways.
As an American playwright, what, if anything, would you change
about the responses of American audiences to your playsf
I don't necessarily feel that I would change the audience. I think
the relationship between the artist and his or her audience is a dia
logue: Sometimes I understand them, and they understand me, and
sometimes we don't understand each other. What I would change,
though, would have to do with the relationship of critics to audi
ences. In most towns, a single newspaper becomes the dominant
voice and determines what an audience will or won't see. I think peo
pie follow critics too slavishly. "M. Butterfly" is a good example: We
opened in Washington, D.C. before we came to Broadway. We got a
bad review in the Washington Post, and nobody came to see the
show. Then as soon as the show comes to New York and gets a good
review in the New York Times, everybody thinks it's the greatest
[show].
Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
I think I'd probably like to have directed a movie by that point. Ill
probably write a play and a movie every year. I'd like to have at least
one other hit in the next 10 years.
What advice would you give to anyone our age who's considering a
career as a playwright?
Have your work seen, however you can do it. You learn so much
by hearing your words spoken. It's really an invaluable experience for
a playwright. And learn as much about the theater as you can. There's
no formula for commercial success, particularly in the theater. And
in a way that's good, because it means that we're forced to fall back on
writing what we're really interested in. If you write something you re
ally love, and it fails, you've still had the great experience of writing it.
But if you're just writing something to try to make it commercial, and
it fails, you're left with nothing. So you just have to write what you be
lieve.
Epilogue to M. Butterfly:
"M. Butterfly has sometimes been regarded as an anti-Amertcan
play, a diatribe against the stereotyping of the East by the West, of
women by men. Quite to the contrary, I consider it a plea to all sides to
cut through our respective layers of cultural and sexual misperception, to
deal with one another truthfully for our mutual good, from the common
and equal ground we share as human beings."


Book cover
Hwang's "M Butterfly" was made into a film starring Jeremy Irons.
I'he celebrated career of David Henry Hwang, one of today's most
gifted playwrights, began with a dorm show in Okada during his se
nior year at Stanford. Shortly after his graduation in 1980, Hwang's
allan with stardom took shape with the success of his 1988 "M. But
terfly,'' a disturbing tale that explores the mythical relationship be
i ween Hast and West on a racial, sexual and cultural level. I'he Asian-
American playwright took some time last spring to speak with Inter
mission about the meeting of inspiration and commercialism in the
lifeol an artist.
How involved were you in the arts community at Stanford? What
was the arts community like when you were here?
i wasn't actually that involved with the theater department. I took
*»ome acting courses, but the theater department didn't offer any play
•vriting classes. Then, 1 started writing some plays in my spare time,
uul John L'Heureux, who is still a professor of English and for a while
vvas nead of the program in Creative Writing, was teaching a Drama
Literature class. I started showing him some of my plays, and he be
anie Kind of a mentor to me for the next couple years. We worked
>ui an independent study so I could major in Creative Writing with
in emphasis on play writing.
)ther than that, most of my involvement in the arts community
probably had more to do with working on dorm shows. I was a mu
sician, and 1 was working on a lot of musicals.
l ell us about the first play that you staged.
I'he first play 1 staged was a play called "F. 0.8.," which stands for
"Fresh Off the Boat.' 1 wrote it as a dorm show to be done at Okada,
which at the time was called Junipero. It was the Asian-American
theme house. We did it in the dorm for a couple nights, and I also sent
it to the National Playwright's Conference, which happens every year
in Waterford, Connecticut.
It got accepted to be done at the O'Neill, and it came to the atten
tion of Joe Papp, who has since passed away, but was probably the
great American theater producer of the last half of the 20th century.
He produced "A Chorus Line" and also created "Shakespeare in the
I'ark" in New York. He decided to produce the play off Broadway a
year after 1 graduated. It won an Obie, which is like an off Broadway
Tony Award.
Were there times when you had doubts about your future as a play
wright?
1 was really lucky to get a really nice break quite soon out of school.
There are lots of times when you wonder, "Am I a has-been?" I think
1 wondered in my mid-20s if 1 was a has-been because I went through
a period when 1 didn't have a lot of off-Broadway success. I've won
dered lately, "Well, am I going to have another hit that's as big as'M.
Butterfly'?" .So 1 think that's the sort of thing that an artist does worry
about from time to time. But I've always felt that I'm a good writer,
that all careers have their ups and downs.
When did you first realize you were a successful playwright? How
did you handle that realization?
As soon as I had my first play produced in New York, 1 felt pretty
successful. When this play "F. 0.8." was done by Joe Papp, 1 was 23 or
24 years old. To be that age and have your work done in New York is
pretty unusual. I had a series of plays done off-Broadway that Joe
Papp produced, which were mostly successful. Then 1 had a big flop
off-Broadway a few years later. In some sense, I feel like that was when

I knew I was always going to be a writer, ironically, because up to that
point my devotion to my craft hadn't really been tested. Now 1 was in
a situation where I wasn't getting the kind of reinforcement from
critics and audiences that I was used to, and yet I was still really glad I
did it.
Where do you find the inspiration for the ideas behind your plays?
I just try to get inspiration wherever 1 can. As a writer, I'm just so
grateful for having ideas. I'm looking for them at all times. Some
times they come out of my personal life. At the moment the play that
I'm workingon that's coming out in ihe fall is based on my family his
tory. 1 had felt like that was something I wanted to deal with at a cer
tain point in my life. Other times, it can be a newspaper article like
with "M. Butterfly," or sometimes it's a piece that somebody asks me
to write. That happens a lot with the movies that 1 work on: Some
