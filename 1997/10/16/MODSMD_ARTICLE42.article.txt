## The 						Mysteries of Art: Fred Taylor’s "O Sacred Head" 
### Angela Lee Contributing writer 
Gruesome murders collide with the
rarefied world of Old Masters'
paintings in Nicholas Kilmer's
third Fred Taylor mystery, "O Sa
cred Head" A decapitated corpse is found with a
painting of Christ's agonized dying face replac
ing the missing head Who would commit such
a murder, and why?
Narrator Fred Taylor, a Bostonian art re
searcher, is a master of understatement as he
makes his way through the twists and turns of the
mystery. His lover, Molly, acts as his aide-de
camp in unraveling the conundrums of who
committed the bizarre killings the identity of one
of the victims and the machinations of a coinci
dental multi-million dollar art scam
Along the way Taylor encounters a fantasti
cal crew of characters. There are the fringe
Catholic organizations who have convinced a
yearning populace that a painting can cause mir
acles. There are crooked art dealers, one of
whom becomes seriously and permanently in
disposed after trying to pull off yet another scam.
Last but not least, there is a glamorous, conniv
ing but ultimately sympathetic TV talk show
host, Molly"s unfortunately-named sister Ophe
lia Finger. In trying to get a good story, Ophelia
gets drawn into the business of dealing with

nasty potential murderers and draws danger
closer to home.
The pace of the plot is unhurried and should
be read thus. "O Sacred Head" is not a page
turner, as some of the prose is definitely worth
stopping for and savoring. Only near the end of
the bxx)k do physical danger and passionate des
peration come to the fore. The criminals' im
plausible and obscure methods are then made
clear as well.
Kilmer, an art curator himself, creates the
most intriguing turns of phrase when describing
visual scenes such as '"Ihe head was beautiful and
masculine in that misleading Italian way that
dares you to riska knife." Hiseruditecommentary
can also be playful; "She was a tall woman, maybe
5'9", the intimate shape of whose body Fred knew
accidentally, concealed though it was by the
denim jumper she was wearing, whkh mitigated
the breasts Fred happened to know Michelin
would characterize as at least 'worth a detour.'"
Kilmer also exhibits a droll wit in Fred's nar
ration. He writes, "The storm was a phenome
non, filled with beauty, mystery, actio, and
snowplows that were not making much head
way." However, a few similes leave readers
scratching their heads, trying to figure out what
Kilmer is trying to say, like this doozy, "Flis room
was smelling like the onset of adolescence."
Right, whatever.
Several subplots weave into the story, includ -

ing the troubled persona] life of Bookraijian, the
policeman who draws Fred into the murders but
is dropped from the investigation on account of
his private affairs.
There is also the developing intimacy be
tween a refined but rapacious art dealer and her
formidable adversary, Fred's eccentric employer
Clayton. Fred finds himself repeatedly remind
ing Clayton that she is not their friend as the cou
ple stretch their delicate negotiations ewer end
less cups of tea.
Wild guesses as to how the lurid murder oc
curred are to be found in one amusing scene in
which random bar flies make up their own bare
ly plausible scenarios and bet on them. Was the
motive an abused altar boy's revenge? Religious
warfare? Cult fascination? Homophobia?
