# Warhol, Stella, Oldenburg and Lichtenstein
## Selections from the Marmor Foundation at the Stanford Art Gallery 
### Rito Treviño Staff writer 
The human head has never looked quite 50... weird. Fine art
has been contorting our craniums for quite a while; cubists
like Pablo Picasso began stretching human perspectives into
geometrical shapes earlier this century. But Roy Lichtenstein, the pop
artist "god" who died three weeks ago, took that concept even further
with his 1970 Modern Head series. He reduced our noggins to mere
circles, rectangles and lines, resulting in shapes that appear vaguely
human and frighteningly robotic.
This fall, the "Modern Heads" and more of Lichtenstein's work
can be found alongside works by Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Robert
Rauschenberg and other master printmakers at the Stanford Art
Gallery. They are being presented in the exhibit "Great Impressions:
Selections from the Marmor Foundation and the Collection of Drs.
Katherincand Judd Marmor."
The 50 works on display represent a variety of printmaking styles
that span four decades, from the rough, weighty look of minimalist
art to the sharp, colorful designs of pop art. The exhibit is intended to
be a "preview" for the collection of about 190 works on long-term
loan from the Marmor family to the Stanford Museum of Art.
"Fine printmaking was very popular in the 19605," explained
Anne Dauer, a volunteer docent giving tours of the exhibit. "Many
artists from other media, such as painters and sculptors, started mak
ing prints as an alternative."
On the walls of the Gallery
The mind is captivated from the moment one steps into the
gallery and beholds Claes Oldenburg's "Sneaker Lace in landscape."
According to the annotation, these two prints, which are among the
largest in the exhibit, use images of shoelaces and random squiggles
to "suggest palm trees and male anatomy."
To the left of the Oldenburgs is a set of works by Lichtenstein, in-

eluding the modern head pieces and two im
ages of cathedrals. Lichtenstein is known for
his powerful, comic-book style prints that
often use Benday (newsprint style) dots. This
technique, developed as a reaction to Abstract
Expressionism, resulted in titles such as
"Grrr!" and "Whaam II." Also present is
Lichtenstein's "Peace Through Chemistry," a
large salute to 1930s post-Depression opti
mism toward mechanics and science.
On the far wall of the gallery one will find
five works by Andy Warhol decidedly
arranged into a cross pattern. They are
silkscreen prints from his Mao Tse-Tung se
ries, which plays upon the cheaply mass-pro
duced photographs of the communist leader.
As Dauer noted on the tour, much of
Warhol's intention was to bombard us with
modifications of images that we take for
granted.
The history of the Marmor loan
The majority of the pieces in the collection
were produced at Gemini Graphics Editions
Limited (G.E.L), the L.A. publisher that is
famed for its experimental and influential ap
proach to modern printmaking.
"Parts of this exhibit represent either the
first prints at Gemini, or the first prints pro
duced ever," noted Hilarie Faberman, Ph.D,
the curator for the exhibit. "That's what
makes this collection special."
Faberman is the Halperin Curator of

Modern and Contemporary Art at the Stan
ford Museum of Art and the lecturer for a class
on Victorian art. Since 1993, she has carried
out the ideas of the Contemporary Collectors'
Circle at Stanford, including an exhibition of
works by Nathan Olivera.
She began her work on the Marmor loan
two and a half years ago, when Dr. Michael
Marmor, a professor of opthamology at the
Stanford Medical School, approached her
about his family's art foundation.
"The collection was large, and much of it
was not being utilized," recalled Marmor. "I
wanted to see it in a place where it would be of
real value, a living set of things. At Stanford, it
will be a powerful collection not just for view
ing, but for teaching and studying."
Marmor's parents, )udd and Katherine,
are doctors from the Los Angeles area who
began collecting art in the 19505. As Judd
Marmor noted recently, his wife had a great
eye for art. She spent a lot of time in art gal
leries and among artists and art collectors.
Eventually the Marmors became subscribers
to the publications of Gemini G.E.L (thus
many of the works bear their subscription
number, #24).
Unfortunately, the Marmor home quickly
ran out of wall space, so a great deal of the
prints had to put in storage. According to
Faberman, many of them hadn't seen the light
of day until they were loaned to Stanford,
which accounts for their excellent condition.

"When we went down to collect them
from different sites, they were pristine, bul
they hadn't been hinged, matted or framed
explained Faberman. "Now everything's been
reinventoried, and the prints are housed in
brand new frames."
So far, the exhibit has brought on main
positive comments, particularly from the
M armors.
"This is the first big exhibition for these
works, so we're very pleased to see them,
said Judd Marmor. "They've done a gre.it
job of framing, hanging, and annotating
them."
lust how good is the exhibit?
The opening of the exhibit has also attract
ed a person who Faberman hails as one of tin
world's top experts on printmaking. Ruth
Fine, the curator of modern prints and draw
ings at the National Gallery of Art, was invited
to Stanford to see the exhibit and present a lei
ture Oct. 7.
Fine's presentation, "Modern Masters:
The Renaissance Revisited," was a brief his
tory of contemporary printmaking, con
centrating on the explosive "revival" that
took place in the 19605. She commented on
the period as a revolution that parallels the
16th-century Renaissance, explaining the
importance of the artists' ideas and the
challenges for publishers like Gemini
G.E.L.

Mao Tse-Tungseries, 1972
Like his images of Marilyn Monroe and Campbell's soup
cans, the Mao Tse-Tung series demonstrates Warhol's use of
repetition to convey meaning. The five pictures of Chairman
Mao (that need not be arranged in the cross pattern) use differ
ent colors and scribbles to make him look alternatively serene,
repulsive and downright hilarious. These images weren't pro
duced at Gemini G.E.1,.

"White Bone," 1971
Francis's work can be said to be more experimentation than actual meaning. Fie began many of his prints with no clue as to their final ap
pearance. Fie would simply create the lithographic stone for each color separately and then mix and match their orientation until he came up
with something that satisfied him. The result in this case is a playful blend of bubbles and blotches. "I love it because it's like being underwater,"
said the curator of the exhibit Hilarie Faberman of the piece. She compared the feelings and orchestrations of color to arrangements of music.
Fine, who used slides of photographs and art
work as a backdrop for her lecture, was impressed by
their huge projections onto the wall of Annenberg
Auditorium. Having never seen page-sized prints
become expanded to proportions of 15 feet or more,
she described the effect as "mind-boggling."
For those who are skeptical of the meaning and effort
put into modern art, Fine has some encouraging words.
"Come to an exhibition with an open mind. Assume that
what you'll see are serious works by serious artists. Once

you've done that you can respect the art, engage it and try
to figure out the meaning behind it."
Of course, the Marnior prints won't end here. "Cireat
Impressions" is just a taste of the full loan. The Stanford Mu
seum of Art will begin a rotation through all I 9<) works once
the Iris and B. (ierald (Cantor C Center for the Visual Arts (lor
merly the Stanford Museum of Art) opens in January 1999.
"This is a great opportunity for the Stanford campus,"
said line. "The seeds for every artistic idea from the last
forty years can be found here."

"Page 4" from Pages and Fuses series, 1974
This work doesn't appear to be a print at all. In fact, there's nothing
printed on it, aside from a watermark of the artist's signature. The "Pages,"
which are combinations of frayed rope and thick handmade paper, are ex
pressions of paper as a medium in itself. Rauschenberg and a team of peo
ple from Gemini G.E.L. went to a tiny paper mill in Alembert, France and
actually molded the paper around the rope. According to Faberman, this
project was a first for the Gemini printmakers.

"River of Ponds I" from Newfoundland series, 1971
Anne Dauer, the docent tour guide, noted that "Stella would often name works like one would name a child
or a dog. The titles have little to do with the works themselves." Thus, among Stella's works 111 the exhibit are "Six
Mile Bottom," "Turkish Mam bo" and "Gavotte." The works in the Newfoundland series are exactly alike in de
sign but different in choice of colors. "River of Ponds I" has a strong, primary-color look, whereas the others ex
plore pastels and tropical colors.


Roy Lichtenstein photo by Sam Mankiewicz
"Haystack #7" from Haystack series, 1969
Lichtenstein been known to take classic images and apply his pop art style to them. In the 1 laystack series, he mimicked
Claude Monet's study of haystacks under different lighting and weather conditions. I .ike the French impressionist, he de
pended on the idea that the image is not meant to be seen close up. I lowever, I.ichenstein 's technique accomplished Monet 's
goal of creating different moods in each piece without having to change the image itself.
