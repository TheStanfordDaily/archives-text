## Cornershop When I Was Born for the Seventh Time 
### 
Throughout the history of British
pop music, the Beat has been a rallying
cry for the outcasts of society, a call for
unity as well as a rhythmic assault on
the country's rigid class system.
This revolutionary ardor has been
present since the sexual snarl of the
Rolling Stones in the '60s, through the
punk / reggae / ska underground of the
70s and '80s, and is now manifested in
Britain's emerging techno scene.
On their new album "When 1 Was
Born for the Seventh lime," Corner
shop takes these divergent elements and
combines them with Punjabi pop to
create something new and distinctive. It
is a multicultural, multi-ethnic music
that never sounds forced and never
preaches: The synthesis of Indian sub
continent Pop aesthetics, European
techno and American rock is handled
masterfully.
Opening with the wistful fluting of a
harmonium, "Sleep on the Left Side"
sets the tone for the entire album. The
music is heart-breakingly optimistic,
with a dreamy bassline and harmonium
flourishes that invite the listener to lope
or lounge. As a melancholy underpin
ning to the Beat, singer Tjinder Singh's
lyrics observe the political lethargy on
"the left side," but he can only manage a
weary shrug.
"Brimful of Asha," the second track,
breaks the hypnotic trance of "Sleep on
the Left Side" with a raucous guitar riff
straight out of the Velvet Underground.
The song is a tribute to Asha Bhosle, star
of countless Indian musicals and one of
Singh's musical idols. With touching
glee he explains how much her music
has meant to him: "Everybody needs a
bosom for a pillow / mine's on the 45."
As the album progresses, it becomes
clear that this theme of music as a
refuge and comfort for the disenfran

chised in society is at the heart of Cor
nershop's music. On "Good Shit,"
produced by Dr. Octagon's The Au
tomator, Singh intones over some
funky guitar, "Good shit's all around,
good people / don't let it get you
down."
However, this radical optimism is
always tinged with an awareness of the
world's problems. "Funky Days Are
Back Again" takes a romantic look at
the retro culture of the '90s, when "the
party has a double 'e' again." On the
other hand, Singh does not turn a
blind eye to the fact that "zip-zap guns
are back again... worker strikes are
back again."
To Cornershop's credit, this polit
ical awareness is always expressed
with admirable subtlety: the most
menacing part of "We're in Yr Cor
ner," which is sung entirely in Pun
jabi, is that the only two words that
come through are "IBM" and "Coca-
Cola."
However, this gloom always evap
orates in front of Cornershop's over
whelming optimism. The most in
spiring moment of the album is
"Good to be on the Road Back
Home," a striking cultural mish
mash, in which an Indian man, a
white woman (Paula Frazer of Tarna
tion), and a disc jockey from San
Francisco come together to sing a
classic country duet over a rock
rhythm.
In songs like this Cornershop of
fers the hope that everyone can be
brought together by the all-powerful
call of the Beat. They have no doubt
about where to find a common
ground — as they declare at the be
ginning of "Good Shit," "Brother, it's
in the drums!"
