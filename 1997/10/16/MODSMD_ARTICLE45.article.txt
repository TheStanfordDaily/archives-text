# Skunk Anansie Stoosh

Politics in Punk? What's up with that? Ready
or not, UK's Skunk Anansie is going to tell you.
The jacket to its second release on Epic,
"Stoosh," is emblazoned with this subtle mes
sage to listeners: "Yes, It's F'cking Political."
The disc that comes with it is a mixed expe
rience. Using artists ranging from Public
Enemy to Rage Against the Machine as a
sounding board, Skunk Anansie incorporates
punk-inspired hardcore with fierce metal funk.
You figure it out.
The song titled "Yes, It's Fucking Political"
viciously attacks polities' infiltration into
everything from our bedrooms to our body
piercings. lead singer Skin warns those too cool
to care that they are "a puppet all the same" in
the politics game.
Similarly, but less caustically, she blasts
politicos by assuming their frame of mind in
"We Ix>ve Your Apathy." Big government loves
nothing more than a public that doesn't give a

damn. Why? "I abuse you as you watch me, and
you always vote me in."
Skunk drives issues home by pushing its
content to the edge of its sound with mixed suc
cess. While "All I Want" is an in-your-face rant
about levels of want and desire, "Glorious Pop
Song" is verbal confusion about nothing,
wrapped in a poor excuse to use the line "You're
still a Pcker" several times. Blaring electric gui
tars say, 'Oh, yeah. All that stuff Skin is
screamin' about — she means it!'
When she's not being a human mega
phone, Skin is at her best in tracks that soften
the overkill. (Read: you can actually under
stand what she's saying). Her amazing vocal
range morphs from gritty rock to haunting
soul. "Infidelity (Only You)" is a beautiful bal
lad with weeping violins that allows Skin to ex
ploit her skills and sounds like a jazzy Annie
Lennox. And on "Hedonism," a lament of lost
love, Skin mimics Tina Turner after a spot of

English tea.
Skunk definitely takes the time to get deep,
serving cuts that call on listeners to fill in the
blanks. "Milk is My Sugar" is a raunchy rock 'n
roll track celebrating a certain serum potent
enough to convert a sweet girl into her true self.
"Pickin' On Me," with sad piano and even sad
der guitar, is an emotional tale of a child abuse
victim turning his anger against the world. And
"She's My Heroine" may be a public service an
nouncement denouncing heroin chic, sung as a
junkie's cry for help disguised as a tribute to the
drug. In the love / hate relationship, heroin is
the heroine — there when nobody else is.
Some get their policy through their CD play
er, while others use music to escape the politics
of living in this mixed-up world. To each his
own. They say it's all in a name. Skunk Anansie
will either leave you saying "Power to the peo
ple" or maybe just "Pew!"
