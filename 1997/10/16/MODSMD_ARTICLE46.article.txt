# Various Artists Hurricane Streets Soundtrack
## 
### 
Definitely varied in its forms of expression,
'Hurricane Streets" is a loud soundtrack that
orings together a conglomerate of different
irtists in a moving, upbeat, but still fairly
ingst-ridden set of songs. Seven Mary Three is
perhaps the most tamous band of the bunch,
>ut all put in decent performances, no matter
n which style they play.
Shadez of Brooklyn starts the album with
ontinuous rapping on "Change," intermixing
i few piano chords into a hip-hop beat to keep
nings interesting. In a similar vein, Xzibit puts
he opening piano notes from Billy Joel's "The
Granger" on repeat and adds a beat, creating a
nellow rap on 'The Foundation."
the repetition of the same piano jingle gets
i bit annoying, but it adds an introspective feel
o the words. The song tollows an emerging
iheme in the increasingly conscientious rap
ommunity and sends a message of self-preser
vation instead of violence, a notion spurred
liost recently by the deaths of popular artists
vlotorious 8.1.G. and Tupac Shakur. "If you've
_;ot a chance to walk away," Xzibit says, "then
to it."
Marcy Playground presents a downtrodden
uid sullen melody on "Sex & Candy," lazily
•pitting out what I assume are substance-in
iuced lyrics like "There she was / like a disco
lemonade."

Supple manages to tone down "Stayin'
Alive" in a way that the Bee Gees surely never
intended. The song takes on a gloomy air; the
group slows the tempo and brings the melody
down a couple octaves, and in this version, the
lead vocalist, who sings at almost a whisper, is
distinctly male. Supple still conveys some of the
excitement of the original song, but through
jaded vocals similar to the version in the movie
"Swingers," it almost becomes a different song.
Atari Teenage Riot performs probably the
loudest song on the album, complete with
nonsensical lyrics, distorted guitar effects and a
pulsating beat. The song shares the group's
name and also sports classic Atari video game
effects, which by default make the song infi
nitely better than it would be without them.
Many of the groups on the album have def
inite potential, but it's always difficult to judge
a group from one song. Movie soundtracks are
often a conduit through which emerging bands
make their presence known in the world, but
the success of the soundtrack comes off the
coattails of the movie itself, and "Hurricane
Streets" does not look to be a blockbuster
smash. Still, the album is a good one to pick up
if you're interested in new and varied sounds.
It's rare to find movie soundtracks that in
clude more than one or two genres of music.
