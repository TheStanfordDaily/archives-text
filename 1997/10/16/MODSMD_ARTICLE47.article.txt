# The 						Sundays Static and Silence
## 
### 
When I picked up "Static and Silence," 1
was afraid of hearing more of the whining,
high pitched musings I remember from its
'80s hit "Here's Where the Story Ends." But I
was wrong.
Harriet Wheeler, the lead singer, has a
warm lilting sound with a vibrato that bub
bles out of her like champagne. She manages
not to sound forced or operatic, while main
taining a mature, yet soft tone. Moreover, she
uses her voice creatively, stretching words
over and around note values and actual notes
in a way that I can only liken to jazz or Rickie
Lee Jones.
The Sundays sound so tight that you can
practically hear the band members collabo
rating in the background. For those of you
that don't know the band, it sounds a little like
The Cranberries, without the yodels of 1 Jo
lores O'Riordan.
Of course, its aim is not to sound anything
like the Cranberries or any other group
members see themselves as their own specific
brand of band.
"We like to think we've got our own style,
our own character," said Wheeler in a press re
lease. "But no body writes in a vacuum and
music continually seeps into our conscious
ness, whether it's an old Sly and the Family
Stone track or the latest Oasis single."
"With the new album, we didn't set out

with the idea of writing more emotional, per
sonal songs, hut we'd heen listening to a lot of
Van Morrison... and had really gotten into
songs that really touched us," said Wheeler.
That explains the private, warm sound that
covers the entire album. Track three ("Folk
Song") is my personal fave.
The downside to "Static and Silence" is the
wretched uniformity of the album as a whole.
After the first couple of songs, an overwhelm
ing tinniness seemed to overtake my world. I
yearned to hear a guitar strum that wasn't
mere background for Wheeler's winsome
voice, or a dynamic drum solo or a harder
sound.
As an indicator for niy feelings lor this
album, I should say that I don't think I've lis
tened to the last few songs on the CD hall as
many times as I've listened to the first lew.
In fact, I had to turn the damn thingoffand
listen to something else. But that's just me.
I"he album is wonderful to listen to if you are
in the mood for light music directed at back
ing up a vocalist with a lovely voice and very
simple, pastoral lyrics.
"It's an atmospheric record," say Wheeler
and David (iavurin (bassist). "It's a slower,
more emotional record than our other al
bums. We didn't set out with this in mind —
it just turned out that way."
