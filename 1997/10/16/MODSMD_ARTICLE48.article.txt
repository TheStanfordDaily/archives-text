## Gang Related 
### 
The main selling point of the latest corrupt
cop movie, "Gang Related," is that it has the dis
tinction ofhavingcaptured on film the final act
ing effort of late rapper and blossoming actor,
Tupac Shakur.
Make that the only selling point. Shakur's
performance is excellent, and it's a sad waste of
his talent for him to be playing (of all things)
James Belushi's sidekick in one of the lamest
movies to come along in a long time.
The premise of "Gang Related" revolves
around two narcotics officers, Divinci (Belushi)
and Rodriguez (Shakur), who set up drug deals,
steal from the dealers and then kill them. The
nature of the killings (drive-bys) leads the police
to classify them as "gang related" (hence Un
title), and the two bad apples continue on their
merry murder-foi-money spree.
Their "little scam" is played for laughs until
they murder the wrong dealer — well, actually,
the wrong undercover DEA agent. From this
point on, the movie can't decide whether to
stick to the vaguely humorous buddy-comedy
formula it cultivated up to this point, or to be
come the dark, disturbing crime drama it al
ways wanted to be. So it does neither.
The most disturbing aspect of the film,

other than perhaps the
waste of Shakur's last
acting efforts, is the fact
that the movie centers
around a "hero" who,
despite his happy-go
lucky demeanor, rou
tinely exploits, de
means and ultimately
murders African-
Americans, whom this
film's marketing is ap
parently targeting.
Furthermore, be
cause Divinci is such a
jerk, it's hard to relate to
him as our hero or even
as the main character,
and thus the film loses
its audience — there's
simply nothing to care
about.
To compensate for
its total mediocrity,

"Gang Related" drags in a lot of talent, namely
Dennis Qua id, James Belushi, Lela Rochon and
Kool Moe Dee. But the flick only makes them

look really stupid for choosing to squander their
abilities in such a poor film. It's really embar
rassing to watch them like this on the big screen.
Can we say "straight to video," please? Each of

these actors is right now wishing the filmmak
ers of "Gang Related" had.
