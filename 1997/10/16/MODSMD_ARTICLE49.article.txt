# Washington Square
## 
### 
It is a truth universally acknowledged that a
single man not in possession of a good fortune
must he in want of a wife who is. Or is it?

Such is the intrigue at the center of "Wash
ington Square," an adaptation of Henry lames'
novel of the same name. Set in 1850s New York,

"Washington
Square" focuses on
wealthy young
heiress Catherine
Sloper (Jennifer
Jason Leigh), whose
shy, awkward na
ture and ungainly
appearance have
kept her sheltered as
a child and now
suitor-less as an
adult.
Catherine's future
suddenly changes
when Morris
Townsend (Ben
Chaplin), an excep
tionally handsome
and charming
young traveler, be
gins to pursue her.
Catherine tumbles
utterly and awk
wardly in love,
much to the dismay
of her domineering

father Dr. Sloper (Albert Finney). Morris has
his faults —he has no money nor profession —
and Dr. Sloper believes that Morris is after
Catherine's fortune.
Thus we are led into a story of first love brim
ming with forbidden passion, meddling aunts
(a sausage-curled Maggie Smith) and painfully
embarrassing situations.
Throughout it all, 1 couldn't help thinking
that the plot was a little stale. After all, love sto
ries about the wallflower turned princess (think
"Dirty Dancing"), the mercenary suitor
(think "Sense and Sensibility") and fathers
who-hate-their-daughters'-beaus (think
"Romeo and Juliet") have been told over and
over again. I was beginning to wonder why
anyone even bothered to make a film out of
"Washington Square," especially in this day
and age when Victorian ideals about love and
marriage seem a bit defunct.
The main problem, however, is that
"Washington Square" lacks the romantic in
trigue that makes movies such as "Sense and
Sensibility" so deliriously coy. In "Sense and
Sensibility," we are as puzzled as Marianne is
about Willoughby's intentions. In"Washing
ton Square," however, the audience is just as
sure as Catherine that Morris sincerely loves
her.
Most importantly, Morris doesn't give any
reasons to doubt him. His perfectly chiseled
face never gives way to duplicity when he is pro
fessing his love to Catherine. When his true na
ture is revealed, however, the audience is taken
aback. It seems inconsistent with his character,
a glitch we don't understand until we realize
that it is all part of director Agnieszka Hollands
rather clever interpretation of the story.

Holland has placed us in Catherine's shoes,
playing with our susceptibility. Like Catherine,
wc are caught off guard by Morris's arrival, and
like her, we lose ourselves in this new feeling
called love. Thus enraptured with Morris, we
easily miss the warning signs. We too quickly
judge Dr. Sloper to be a heartless father, and we
cheer Catherine on, certain that love will con
quer all. So when the betrayal occurs, the disbe
lief that crosses Catherine's face crosses ours as
well.
