# Laser beams used to cool atoms

Using a set of six laser beams,
Physics and Applied Physics
Prof. Steve Chu devised a
method for trapping and cooling
atoms that allows them to be
studied more closely.
The work on "optical mo
lasses," for which Chu is sharing
the IW7 Nobel Prize in Physics,
has applications in several areas
of science, including the develop
ment of a more accurate atomic
clock and a technique to hold
onto a single chromosome in a
cell.

The laser beams bombard an
atom with photons, which it will
absorb and then emit. An ab
sorbed photon slows down the
velocity of the atom, but as a pho
ton is emitted, there is a recoil ef
fect, which speeds the atom back
up.
Repeated enough times, how
ever, the exchange of photons on
average cools down the atom,
making it move more and more
slowly. Chu's original experi
ment took atoms down to about
240 millionths of a degree above
absolute zero. Absolute zero, or
minus 273 degrees Celsius, is the
temperature at which all activity
stops.
Refinements of the experiment
and further work by Chu and his
fellow prize-winners, Claude
Cohen-Tannoudji and William
Phillips, have brought the mini
mum temperature of cooled atoms
to a few millionths of a degree
above absolute zero.
For the photons in the laser
beam to affect the atoms, they
need to be at the right energy. The
conditions necessary for this are
constantly changing because of the
Doppler effect, the same effect

that would make a train whistle
sound higher to a car approaching
it and lower to a car driving away
from it. An atom only recognizes
the laser beam if it is headed to
ward it.
When the atom absorbs the
photon, the momentum that slows
it down also pushes it toward the
intersection of the laser beams.
When the photon is emitted, it
shares its energy with the atom.
The atom has absorbed the mo
mentum that slowed it down, so
despite the added recoil velocity,
its overall speed is decreased.
Although the photon's momen
tum pushes the atoms into a trap,
the atoms can be further slowed
down with the help of a magnetic
field that strengthens the trap. The

minimum of the magnetic field is
set to coincide with the intersec
tion of the beams. Because the
field's strength is lowest there, it
acts like a hill for the atoms to
climb up. As the atoms try to push
up to the higher strength, they emit
more energy and cool further.
After trapping the atoms, Chu
said, he recorded his success in
cooling them but never thought to
look at the trap. When he checked
his first experiment — done on a
lump of sodium — he saw a glow
ing cloud of atoms about the size of
a pea that was visible to the naked
eye.
A trapped and cooled atom will
remain in place for about a second,
giving physicists time to study its
characteristics.
