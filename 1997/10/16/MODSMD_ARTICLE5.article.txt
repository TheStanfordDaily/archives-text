Using a set of six laser beams,
Physics and Applied Physics
Prof. Steve Chu devised a
method for trapping and cooling
atoms that allows them to be
studied more closely.
The work on "optical mo
lasses," for which Chu is sharing
the IW7 Nobel Prize in Physics,
has applications in several areas
of science, including the develop
ment of a more accurate atomic
clock and a technique to hold
onto a single chromosome in a
cell.

The laser beams bombard an
atom with photons, which it will
absorb and then emit. An ab
sorbed photon slows down the
velocity of the atom, but as a pho
ton is emitted, there is a recoil ef
fect, which speeds the atom back
up.
Repeated enough times, how
ever, the exchange of photons on
average cools down the atom,
making it move more and more
slowly. Chu's original experi
ment took atoms down to about
240 millionths of a degree above
absolute zero. Absolute zero, or
