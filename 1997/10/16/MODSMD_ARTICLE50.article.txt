# Mon Homme

### 
As 1 left the theater after seeing the French
import, "Mon Homme," an elderly man
turned to me and said with a touch of
embarrassment, "American movies, they just
aren't so good." I knew exactly how he felt.
"Mon Homme" is a riveting film, directed
by Bertrand Blier, which explores topics of love
and sexuality in terms that may be disturbing
or even distasteful, but never predictable. Its
power lies in its construction of unfamiliar
characters, not types, and the manipulation of
conventional narrative structure, both aspects
we rarely find in our home-grown block
busters.

The story of "Mon Homme" focuses on a
prostitute who, hardly in desperate straits, con
siders her occupation to be truly a joy and a ser
vice. She sells dreams to men, declaring that she
gives them not sex, but love. In a sequence
showing various tricks Marie turns, the audi
ence can't help but be touched by her warmth
and genuine affection for these men. Played
beautifully by Anouk Grinberg, who won Best
Actress for this role at last years Berlin Film
Festival, Marie is a hooker with "a happy mind
and a happy ass" until she encounters a dirty,
homeless man on the street, and her life of in
dependence comes to an end.
Up until this point, she had always been the
one in control, fitting herself to the fantasies of
her clients. Marie decides that Jeannot (Gerard
Lanvin), the man lying on the sidewalk outside
her building, will be the fulfillment of her own
dreams, and she invites him into her apartment

and her bed. "I've waited so long for a man who
needs me," she says.
But this isn't him, we learn. Jeannot is enig
matic, seldom displaying his true motivations.
He remains a stranger both to the viewer and to
Marie, especially as he begins courting other
women and repeatedly slapping Marie.
Throughout the film, there is a gap in com
munication between the two central charac
ters, revealed by their constant failure to hear or
understand the other's words. "Shut up," he
tells her. "Don't say anything, don't say one
word," Barry White sings on the soundtrack
over the first shot of the film. With Marie later
offering to bear the children of a man she sees
in a coffee shop, this story identifies an absence
of true intimacy in human relationships, even
between lovers.
The film uses cinematic devices that dis
courage a viewer's total immersion in the plot,

so that one remains conscious of watching a
constructed product. There are moments
when characters directly address the camera,
even speaking in the past tense about events as
they take place. The narrative is edited in a
non-linear fashion, jumping back and forth
between episodes without chronological accu
racy. The actual filming, however, is less exper
imental than the story and dialogue, sticking to
fairly conventional angles and camera move
ments.
Towards the end, "Mon 1 lomme" veers irre
versibly away from any realism to which it
might have maintained a connection. Impossi
ble or indecipherable situations will make a
viewer work to get past plot and reach mean
ing. But this is the stimulating territory that al
lows the French to produce "cinema" while we
keep on making movies.
