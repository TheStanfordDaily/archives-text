# Most Wanted

### 
This film surprised me by turning out to
be a well-structured action picture with
moments of hilarity. I hoped that the
movie would not degrade into pointless, one
line comedy shots and car-chase sequences. It
didn't, and the plot line is more than sufficient
to keep the audience riveted.
Star and scriptwriter Keenen Ivory Wayans
("A Low Down Dirty Shame") plays Sgt. James
Dunn, a Gulf War veteran who hits a large
bump in his military career. Because of an un
fortunate sequence of events, Sgt. Dunn must
face a long prison sentence.
Dunn's light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel turns
out to be Lt. Col. Grant Casey, played by a very
hammy and over-the-top Jon Voight, the oper
ative leader of a secret group known as "Black
Sheep." Casey assembles a bunch of toughened
military men — many with dark pasts — to
work as covert security and assassination
agents.
Casey appoints Dunn to shoot reclusive bil
lionaire Donald Bickhart (Robert Culp, "Peli

can Brief"). It's too bad that Dunn has been set
up; soon enough, Dunn is accused of killing the
first lady, and his mug shot is all over the
evening news.
Dunn's lone hope is Dr. Victoria Constanti
ni (Jill Hennessey, TV's "Law and Order"),
whose camera contains vital footage of the
multiple shots fired. Together, the physician
and the soldier fight off the bad guys and try to
piece together a puzzle that rapidly becomes
tougher to solve. Thrown into the mix is CIA
Director Rackmill (Paul Sorvino), who simul
taneously attempts to figure out the master
mind behind the assassination.
Besides the varying twists in the alignment
of protagonists and antagonists, "Most Want
ed" gives the audience a chance to breathe
amidst the excitement with witty remarks and
sequences. The movie walks a thin wire be
tween proper humor and potty language, but it
works for the most part.
Director David Hogan has improved his
filmmaking skills since his release of "Barb

Wire" with Pamela Lee Anderson. He
seems to have a good eye for

provocative camera angles and
background details. Plus, we

get to see much of South
ern California, a crowded
and busy setting perfect

— r—
for the action se
quences.

1 appreciated the
length of "Most Want
ed," which is just over
an hour and a half.
Dragging the thin plot

any longer would have
made the audience

squirm and wish for it to
end. Hogan has put together

a tight, easy-to-handle film that
makes for a fun matinee.
