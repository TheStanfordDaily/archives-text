## It's time to get with it 
### 
When was the last time you went to the movie
theater and saw a new movie?
If you answered "I've been trapped in Green Li
brary for two years, and they just let me out," then
you need to catch up on some things, especially be
cause you're probably one of the last people on the
planet who hasn't yet declared your opinion of
"The English Patient." 1 lere are a few of my video
recommendations to help you get started.
Wes Craven's "Scream" is a smart and enjoyable
thriller about a peaceful town that is rocked by a se
rial killer. The killer bases his own murders on old
horror flicks. The cast includes Drew Barrymore,
Courtney Cox, Skeet Ulrich and Neve Campbell.
This film grossed $90 million in theaters before the
summer even started. Rent it this week before next
week's release of "1 Know What You Did Last Sum
mer," a film that is considered to be the next install
ment in this great genre.
"Murder at 16(H)" is another fun and entertain
ing film. Starring Diane Lane and Wesley Snipes,
this is the story of a D.C. cop and a secret service
agent who are investigating the murder of a gov
ernment official at the White 1 louse. As their inves
tigation progresses, they discover that there is more
to this murder than meets the eye. Because of the
unusual location of the murder, they must over
come some serious obstacles to unravel the truth.
One great thing about this film is that it was able to
mislead me twice before I was able to figure out who
was behind the murder.
A film that's a bit more serious, but no less en
joyable is John Singleton's "Rosewood." Based on
historical fact, this film portrays racial tensions in
1923 Rosewood, Florida, a town where the blacks
are wealthier than the whites. When a white woman
is raped by a white soldier, she accuses a black man
of the crime. I'his unleashes a storm of violence and
hatred against the black population. A black visitor
to the town (Ving Rhames) and the white town gro
cer (Jon Voight) decide to work together to heip
save as many innocent victims as they can.
"Albino Alligator" is a film that takes place al
most entirely in one location, making it feel like a
play. Asa result, it must rely heavily on its actors and
story in order to work. Gary Sinise, Matt Dillon and
Faye Dunaway deliver great performances under
Kevin Space/s direction, and the story of a tense
hostage situation in a bar is made surprisingly ap
pealing. For once, the hostage-takers are portrayed
as real people who are not just freaks with outra
geous demands.
My last recommendation is "The Saint," a more
conventional film that makes abundant use of
stunts. It stars Val Kilmer as Simon Templar or
"The Saint" and Elisabeth Shue as the scientist who
has just invented a way to maximize energy extrac
tion from a natural resource. Templar is a merce
nary who can steal anything given the right amount
of money. This time, he is hired to steal Shue's new
chemical formula, which could drastically lower
the world's dependence on natural fuels. After he
falls in love with the victim of his theft, he decides to
steal the formula back. His opponent puts up quite
a fight, resulting in some spectacular action se
quences.
If none of these picks appeals much to you, you
might enioy "The hnglish Patient," the Oscar-win
ning romance that takes place in the desert of
Africa. This film won nine Oscars, so you might
want to see it regardless of whether you like the
genre or not.
So enjoy and try to avoid the sketchy nooks and
corners of Green.
