# Access improved for disabled students

### Jennifer Saba 
The University has stepped up efforts this year
to insure accessibility and adequate resources for
students with disabilities.
Memorial Auditorium, ( übbcrlcy Auditorium
and Encina Hall underwent renovations this past
summer to keep up with the codes of the Ameri-

Gins With I )isabilities Act. In addition to these ren
ovations, the Disabilities Resource Center has cx
panded its services to disabled students.
I ven though partially accessible before, Memo
rial Auditorium was still a "hit of an adventure" foi
students with disabilities, according to Rosa (ion
/ale/, associate director for multicultural develop
ment and ADA ('ompliance ()fficer.

Now Memorial Auditorium has a new ramp in
front of the building as well as accessible restrooms
and drinking fountains in the lobby.
The Visitor's ( enter, which is housed in Memo
rial Auditorium, also received some new ameni
ties. Visitors who cannot make the walking tour of
t he campus can now ride on golf carts,
provided free of charge by the center.
Gonzalez also confirmed that
Cubberley has a brand new elevator
t hat won't require the rider to slide
open a cumbersome gate to gain ac
cess. New restrooms were also in
stalled, and a ramp in back of the au
ditorium is nearly completed.
Encina has seen the installation of
new ramps and elevators.
In addition, the Fire Truck House

where the Women's Center and Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center are located also received new
elevators, bathrcxms and even a ren
ovated kitchen.
Along with these renovations, the
University hired an outside company
to survey the campus for all the barri
ers that exist for students with disabil
ities. This extensive report will in
clude evaluations of more than 500
buildings and will note every minute
detail — from the width of doors to
the presence of fire alarms.
This survey, available in Decem
ber, "will help prioritize buildings"

most in need of renovation, Gonzalez
said.
Sophomore H'Sien Hayward, a
disabled student, was pleased with
the improvements.
"It was the most wonderful wel
come to come back to campus and
see the changes. It makes my experi
ence here more inclusive," Hayward
said.
Positive change has also come to
the Disability Resource Center.
Hie center, which had been plagued
by a high turnover rate, is now com
pletely staffed. Joan Bisagno, who
was brought in as the center's interim

director, has been appointed perma
nently after an open search to fill the
position. In addition, the staff mem
bers serving under her who previous
ly served on term contracts have
been given a more permanent status.
"I think we have very good people
in place," said Dean of Students Marc
Wais. "The DRC is getting rave re
views."
Bisagno said the center just re
ceived a "sizable" gift of special com
puter equipment from Intel. This new
technology will aid students with
their special needs, such as helping
blind students read diagrams.
