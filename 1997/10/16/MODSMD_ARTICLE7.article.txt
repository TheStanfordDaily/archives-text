# A 						computer we can count on
## Defense department funds computer reliability study 
### Dana Mulhauser 
Stanford students are always looking for more reli
able computers. So, evidently, is the Department of
Defense, and it has funded a three-year project at
Stanford to obtain them.
The Defense Department is funding a study
through the Stanford Center for Reliable Computing
to improve the reliability of computers through the
use of adaptable circuits. The three-year study is
named Reliability Obtained by Active Reconfigura
tion.
In the spring of this year, the Defense Department
sent out a call for grant proposals. I he center sent in
its proposal for the study, and the Department of De
fense gave it $2.4 million for the project.
" This all happened very quickly," according to the
center's director Hdward McC luskey, the study's prin
cipal investigator.
The aim of the study is to develop computer sys
tems that use adaptable integrated circuits called
field programmable devices in place of the standard
circuits currently in use. In a system using such de
vices, the circuits can automatically switch between
structures if the current structure becomes inade
quate, which can help prevent computer shutdowns.
"A normal integrated circuit has a fixed structure,"

said Mc( luskey. These new circuits don't have fixed
structures so they can be used 111 multiple ways."
For example, McCluskey said, the devices can be
used to help airplanes switch between navigation sys
tems. An airplane flying over land might navigate by
analyzing pictures of the ground below and comparing
them to pictures stored in the memory of its computer.
If the plane were to travel over water, however,
that navigation system would be inoperable, 112 ield
programmable devices would allow the plane to
switch automatically to another navigation system,
perhaps one based on the positions of the stars.
The center is researching how these devices can im
prove computer reliability.
"We are mainly interested in how we can use the
adaptive capabilities of these circuits to keep comput
er systems from failing," McCluskey said.
This integrated circuit technology would allow the
Defense I)epartment to have reliable computers in its
more remote locations.
This research, however, is not intended solely for
the benefit of the Defense Department.
"The Department of Defense intends that this
technology be transferred to commercial use," Mc-
Cluskey said. That would mean that the Defense De-
partment could buy these products
commercially, instead of having to
design its own.
The study will be directed by the
center but several parts of the pro
ject will be given out to subcontrac
tors. A team at the University of
Texas, headed by a former student
of McCluskey's, Nur Touba, an as
sistant electrical and computer en
gineering professor, will design the
hardware that allows the circuits to

know when a system is not working
correctly. Quickturn, a Mountain
View company that produces hard
ware, will reconfigure some its
products for use on the project.
The center was founded more
than 20 years ago to discover why
computers fail and how that failure
can be prevented. Other projects
within the center include research
on the testing of integrated circuits.
The center studies how to test them
and how to know when they fail. It
also recently launched a satellite
that studies the effects of radiation
on computing systems.
