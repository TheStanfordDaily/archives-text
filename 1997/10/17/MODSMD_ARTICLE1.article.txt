Stanford police arrested an intruder Wednesday at
Tresidder Union after he had agreed to stay off campus.
Although Martin Charles Rodolari, 38, of San Carlos
remains in police custody, a residence dean yesterday
warned students to be on the lookout for him in the future.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said Rodolari
has frequently been seen loitering on campus and near res
idence halls including Lambda Nu and Lagunita Court
since 1992.
"He's been a perennial thorn in our side," Niemeyer
said. "He has been reported following women around, not
overtly stalking, but making people feel very uncomfort
able."
Niemeyer said an employee at the Stanford Store in
Tresidder reported Wednesday afternoon that he was
"staring at her."
Junior Jen Slaski works at the Stanford Store. While
she was not the employee who called the police Wednes
day, she said a man who fit Rodolari's description had
bothered her several times during the past week, including
at the Stanford Store, Tresidder and the Coffee House.

"He came up to me while 1 was studying at Tresidder
and said, 'I recognize you.' Not knowing his intentions, 1
wouldn't be surprised if he were bothering other people,"
she said. "I was really shtxik up, because it seemed like he
knew me."
Lisa Webb, residence dean for Governor's Corner, La
gunita and Roble, alerted resident staff about the arrest in
an e-mail yesterday.
"I sent out an e-mail for safety precautions," Webb
said.
Police described Rodolari as a 5-foot-7 white man, 18()
pounds with brown curly hair, brown eyes, glasses and a
mustache.
Niemeyer said he does not consider Rodolari danger
ous, although police have had several run-ins with him in
the past. Most recently, Niemeyer said Rodolari signed a
letter Tuesday agreeing to stay off campus after police re
moved him from Governor's Corner.
Rodolari was in custody yesterday at the Santa Qara
County jail in San Jose on trespassing charges.
Niemeyer said there is no link between Rodolari and a
man who sexually assaulted a woman in Casa Zapata Sept.
14. The suspect in that attack remains at large.
