# Tensions rise in U.S.-Japan dispute
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A long-simmering
trade dispute escalated into a tense standoff as
the United States made U.S. ports off limits to
Japanese cargo ships beginning today — unless
llth-hour negotiations are successful.
The Federal Maritime Commission voted
yesterday to direct the Coast Guard to impose
the ban on entry and to have the U.S. Customs
Service detain any Japanese ships already in
U.S. ports.
However, Commission Chairman Howard
Creel said the orders would not be carried out
until late today to give negotiators from both
countries more time to resolve the dispute.
The commission acted after receiving word
from Japanese shipping companies they did not
plan to pay an estimated $4 million in fines if
had levied.

A ban on Japanese ships entering U.S. har
bors would have an enormous impact on trade
between the world's two biggest economies,
affecting billions of dollars worth of products
going both ways. Japanese ships also trans
port U.S. goods on their return voyages to
Japan.
U.S. analysts said that the biggest immediate
impact would be on American stores trying to
stock up with Japanese televisions, radios and
other electronic goods in time for the Christmas
sales season.
The fines, the first trade sanctions levied
against Japan in a decade, were imposed after
the two countries were unable to reach a deal to
guarantee freer access by American shipping
companies to Japanese ports.
American and other foreign shipping lines

have long complained thai Japan rccjuircs all
shippers lo receive prior approval lor even the
most minor operational changes in handling
cargo at Japanese ports.
U.S. negotiators were demanding that these
restrictions be eliminated so that American
shipping lines would have the same privileges at
Japanese ports that Japanese lines enjoy in the
United States.
Clinton administration officials expressed
hope yesterday that the dispute could he
resolved. Both sides met into the night at the
Transportation Department.
"The talks are ongoing. The Japanese sent in
a counteroffer late this afternoon. There is some
movement but we are not there yet," said one
administration official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
