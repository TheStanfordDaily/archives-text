# Giuliani files lawsuit
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — New
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
challenged the constitutionality of
the line-item veto yesterday in a
federal lawsuit seeking to keep the
state from losing Medicaid funds.
President Clinton's August veto
"unfairly targets the city and the
state of New York," Giuliani said.
The suit was filed in U.S. District
Court.
Even as the law came under
fresh legal challenge, Clinton used
it yet again yesterday, striking an
$854 million, five-year benefits pro
vision for federal workers from a
Treasury Department spending bill.
Traveling in South America,

Clinton called the provision "hasti
ly concived" and wasteful.
The first president to have the
power, Clinton has now exercised
the line-item veto 55 times in three
months. The 19% law enables him
to cancel specific projects and pro
grams, or "items," from spending
bills and irom certain tax bills.
A new challenge to the law had
been widely anticipated.
The Supreme Court last June
dismissed an action brought by six
members of Congress, saying they
lacked legal standing. But the jus
tices said that the law could be chal
lenged by anyone affected by such a
veto once the president exercised it.
