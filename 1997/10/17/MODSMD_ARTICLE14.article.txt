AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — James A. Michener,
who guided millions of readers from the South
Pacific to the fringes of space in giant, best-selling
novels, died yesterday. He was 90.
Longtime friend and assistant John Kings said
the author died of renal failure at his home in
Austin. Michener last week ordered doctors to
disconnect him from life-sustaining kidney dialy
sis.
"His loss will be great not only the literary

scene but to the many colleges he has nurtured
through the years and the many thousands of
people who feel he is their friend," Kings said.
Michener's heralded writing career, which
spanned nearly 50 years, began in his mid-life,
with "Tales of the South Pacific." The book, writ
ten during his tour of duty with the Navy in
World War II won the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 and
was the basis for "South Pacific," a long-running
Broadway musical and later a motion picture.

Michener then spent decades wandering the
globe, from Japan and Korea to Hungary,
Hawaii, Afghanistan, Spain, South Africa, Col
orado, Israel, Chesapeake Bay, Poland, Texas,
Alaska and the Caribbean.
He wrote historical-geographic blockbusters,
living in and absorbing the culture of the places
of which he wrote. His books argued for univer
sal ideals: religious and racial tolerance, hard
work and self-reliance.
