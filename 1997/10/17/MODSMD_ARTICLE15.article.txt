# Price-fixing problem
## Cartels under grand jury investigation 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)
More than 20 federal grand juries
are investigating price fixing hy
international cartels of compa
nies in more than 20 countries on
four continents. Assistant Attor
ney General Joel I Klein said
yesterday.
In some of the cases, the sus
peeled conspiracies involve mar
kets with billions of dollars ot
sales each year, Klein said with
out identifying any of the suspect
industries. Others involve hun
dreds of millions of dollars in
annual sales.
As these cartels pose an
"increasingly serious threat... to
the world economy" and con
sumers in many nations, the C lm
ton administration is seriously
considering asking Congress to
sharply increase the standard fine
for violating the Sherman Act.
The standard fine might be
raised from $10 million to $100
million if the administration pre
vails, according to a Justice offi
cial, who requested anonymity.

Klein's disclosure, in remarks
prepared for delivery at the Ford
ham Corporate l aw Institute's
annual conference on interna
tional law and policy in New
York, comes just after the Justice
Department's antitrust division
shattered the record for criminal
price-fixing fines.
In fiscal IW7, which ended
Sept. 30, Klein's division won
$205 million in criminal fines,
roughly live times the record set
in IWS. Of this, $100 million was
paid by Archer I )aniels Midland,
the I !.S. agribusiness giant, for its
role in fixing prices for two food
additives, lysine and citric acid.
Seventy nations prohibit car
tels and large countries including
the United States, Canada an
Japan treat price fixing as a crime.
But Klein said, "Our experi
ence during this last year has
forcefully demonstrated that
there are lots of people out there
including many high-ranking
officials of major firms who art
not getting the message."
