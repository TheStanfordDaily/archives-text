## Notebook A 						moment of reflection 
### 
TOWARD THE END of the summer,
on a fine August day, one of my best
friends from boarding school died in
an automobile accident.
Death is something that is largely alien
and unfamiliar to me, and I think to many
of us here. We are young and just coming
into the full prime of adulthood, where
maturity mixes with vigor to produce amaz
ing things. People our age are not supposed
to die. Right now, for all practical intents
and purposes, we are supposed to be
immortal.
But my friend is dead.
He was the friend who lent me his com
puter for a week so that 1 could work on my
college applications. He was the friend who
pulled an all-nighter to recover those same
college applications after the floppy disk
they were 011 crashed. He was the one who
said (loppy disks are unreliable and that 1
should be sure to save 011 the hard drive. He
was the friend who gave me his hat in a bliz
zard because I said my ears were freezing.
I le was that kind of friend.
And now he is dead.
I wish I could somehow understand or
comprehend why this had to happen. Per
haps there is no rhyme or reason to this.
These things just happen. But that is some
how more infuriating. How can the world
stand back and look on in gentle indifference
while billions of human tragedies are played
out on its stage daily?
I thought I used to understand something
about human life, something about the
human condition, but now I find 1 am more
benighted than ever before. Why are we
here? What is the purpose of life? My
friend's death has led me to the realization
that if 1 am fortunate to live a long life (if for
tunate is indeed the word) then his will be
only the first in a lifetime full of deaths. Is
that what life is about, watching people you
care about perish one by one?
Tragedy and melancholy suffuse human
affairs. They form the underlying backdrop
against which we act out the short plays that
are our lives. My friend's death brings into

sharp relief the contrast between the venali
ty of the enveloping minutiae of life and dif
ficulty of the search for something more sub
stantial and transcendent.
His death also showed me for the first
time how ordinary life continues even in the
face of tragedy. I distinctly recall walking
around campus in a daze while all around me
people carried on their chatter about their
summers, their classes and the other idle flutf
that people use to fill the dangerous silences.
Even crying out to people, 'My friend is
dead! My friend is dead!' would not have
made a difference. They did not know him,
so how could he possibly be a real person to
them? And how do you feel for something
that is not real to you?
The sad truth is that the world can and
will get along just fine without you. Believe
me, the world seems to work just as well as it
ever did without my friend.
So why am I talking about this? What is
this all about? Reflection.
I want to encourage everyone to reflect. I
want people to consider what they really
want out of life and what they are doing to
get there. I want them to examine what they
are doing now, and see if it is truly meaning
ful to them. Above all, I want people to tack
le the big questions. Why are we here? What
is life all about?
I do not want to abdicate these questions
to the realm of the unknowable, because for
me that would mean an abandonment of the
whole mission of humanity. Not tackling the
big questions would be giving up and saying
no meaning is possible that human reason
can comprehend. To me that is an abandon
ment of our humanity. For it is in the quest to
find Truth, to know, to hear each other's
voices and dispel the darkness that we find a
way to defeat the indifference of nature and
transcend our mortality. In this quest we find
our humanity. _ ~ . .
