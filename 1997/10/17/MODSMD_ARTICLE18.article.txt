## It's Super Intern! Taking Washington, D.C. by storm 
### 
IT WAS THE first day
of April, 1997, a mere
six and a half months
ago. Stepping out of the
Metro station and into the
crisp and clean 40 degree
air of our nation's capital
(oh, how the temperature
would soon change), with

winds of up to 50 mph messing up my hair,
I began my first day of work at the Office
of Elementary and Secondary Education
(creatively called OESE) of the U.S.
Department of Education bright and early
at 8 a.m.
I was greeted at the 4th floor of the
building by Calvin the security man, then at
the office by Jean who promptly showed
me into the lobby where I met my intern
ship supervisor, Maria. She's from New
York. Quickly we went around the office
for introductions, where I immediately
became known as "Darron the Intern."
Conversation ensued. "Sarah, this is Dar
ron the Intern." "Hi, Sarah," I would say.
This scene was repeated over and over.
"Hi, Kristin." "Hi, Charlene." "Hi, Kather
ine." Yes, this is the Department of Educa
tion. Lots o' women.
I was then introduced to the assistant
secretary, who is the big boss man of
OESE. His name is Gerry, but to me, he
was always Dr. Tirozzi. Maria then gave
me a number of incredibly interesting
things to read, such as the pocket guide to
education statistics, so that on a whim, I
could whip it out (the pocket guide) and
tell someone all kinds of cool education
facts. And then I got the bathroom key.
It wasn't until some weeks later that the
importance of the bathroom key became
so very clear. After an all-day meeting to

evaluate a grant application from South
Dakota, I cordially offered my services to
one of my immediate superiors to help
clean up the meeting room. With a smile
on his face, he said, "Actually, you can

clean up the coffee machine. Go
to the bathroom and dump out
the grounds, but be sure to put

them in the trash can
and not the sink
because the drain will
clog."
Fair enough, 1
thought. The cool thing
is, I discovered that the
bathroom is the hap
penin' place to be,
because after all, every
body has to go eventual
ly, and the big wigs in
the office are no excep
tion. Shortly after I
began to clean out the
grounds, Tom (the
director of Goals 2000,

the most well respected and
essentially the flagship pro
gram of the entire department)

walks in, looks at me and the cof-

fee machine, and says, "Hey, good job."
Ahhh, a moment to cherish.
Yes, being in that bathroom opened up
a plethora, a virtual cornucopia, if you will,
of opportunities. It wasn't much later that
Tom agreed to let me stay on for the sum
mer as a member of the Goals 2(XX) staff.
And let me tell you, from that point on,
I was living the bureaucratic good life. I
had one of those awesome ISDN speaker
phones at my desk that has caller 1.D.,
three different lines, the time and day and
lets you choose any one of eight ring varia

tions. Isn't that rad?! And my PC had
Netscape 3.1, the latest version of Word-
Perfect and a screen saver tnat featured
some cool little farmer guy on a tractor. I
even had voice mail and larger desk and

cubicle space than half the staff (you
know what they say about the size of
your cubicle). In short, I was stylin'.

I, normally mild man
nered Darron Evans, had

become Super

Intern
(aw w w
yeah!).
Taking the
occasional
bomb threat
in stride (it's
that whole

"federal intru-

sion on local mat-

ters" thing; gotta
love the South), 1

shaped educational technolo
gy policy. 1 wrote corre
spondence to concerned cit
izens. I hit a home run for
ED's softball team in a
game against the Office of

the President. Armed with my nifty ED
identification badge, I strutted around D.C.
in my suit and tie with noticeable pride.
I became part of a group of incredibly
devoted and awesome people striving to
improve the education of America's youth.
Now if that doesn't make you feel all warm
and fuzzy, you're more messed up than 1
thought.

Darron says hi to the Goals 2000 staff and
reminds them he will be their boss some
day.
