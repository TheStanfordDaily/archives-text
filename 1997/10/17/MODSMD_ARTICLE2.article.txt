# Students flock to Peace Corps

In Cabanas, a cool, mountain vil
lage in western Honduras, Peace
Corps volunteer Tania Butkovic
spent two years training midwives in
modern birthing techniques and set
up a clinic for pregnant rural
women.
Surrounded by coffee planta
tions and jungle, Cabanas is a re
mote community, yet for Butkovic,
Class of '94, the hardships of isola
tion amounted to little in compari
son with the personal rewards she
gained.
Although her experience was
unique, Butkovic is representative
of more than 1,000 Stanford gradu
ates who have enrolled in the Peace
Corps during the program's 36-year
history.

In a letter to University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, Peace Corps
Director Mark Gearan announced
this week that Stanford ranks l()th
among all colleges and universities
in producing Peace Corps volun
teers.
"Throughout its history, the
Peace Corps can trace much of its
success to the energy and idealism
of American college students,"
Gearan wrote in his letter. "These
colleges and universities are to be
commended for producing students
committed to making a difference,
with a thirst for adventure, and with
the desire to experience a new cul
ture in an ever-changing world."
Since the Peace Corps was
founded in 1961 by President John
F. Kennedy, 1,240 Stanford gradu
ates have joined the program. UC-

Berkeley tops the list with 2,%()
graduates, followed closely by the
University of Wisconsin, the Uni
versity of Washington and Harvard
University.
According to Peace Corps Re
gional Director Maryann Murray,
"For most volunteers, the Peace
Corps is a turning point in their
lives. It is the start of a whole new
way of looking at the world."
At present, there are 6,5(K) Peace
Corps volunteers serving in 87 coun
tries, primarily in Africa, the former
Soviet Union, Latin America,
Southeast Asia and the South Pacif
ic. Jordan and South Africa arc the
most recent countries to be added to
the program's area of service.
Most volunteers work in the
fields of education, health care, en
vironmental protection and busi
ness development.
According to Murray, no previ
ous language skills are necessary to
join the Peace Corps, although a
knowledge of French or Spanish is
helpful. Degrees in English or sci
ence-related fields are most desir
able, as is tutoring experience.
All housing, food, transportation
and medical costs are covered by the
program. Volunteers also receive an

ample monthly stipend as well as
$5,4(X) upon completion of the two
year assignment. In addition,
Perkins loans are reduced 15 per
cent for each year of service and
most other loans can be deferred.
For Butkovic, who graduated
with a bachelor's in human biology
and is fluent in Spanish, the assign
ment in Honduras was ideal.
Living in a small room rented
from the mayor's office, she had her
own latrine and took bucket baths.
"It sounds totally foreign here,
but it was really not that hard to get
used to," she said.
One of the most challenging as

pects of her assignment was over
coming resistance among the local
women to modern medical prac
tices and convincing them to use the
maternity clinic she helped set up.
"Women there are used to giving
birth at home in the dark with their
husband and children around," she
said. "The idea of going somewhere
else to give birth was very strange,
even if it meant less risk."
After recently finishing her two
year position, Butkovic went back
home to Fresno, Calif., where she is
busy applying to medical schools.
She credits the Peace Corps and her
experience in Honduras with help

ing inspire her to pursue a career in
medicine.
"I don't feel like my work dra
matically changed the world but on
a personal level I really affected
people's lives and they affected
mine," she said. "It was very hard to
come home."
According to Murray, fall is the
best time to apply to the Peace
Corps program since the application
process takes six to nine months to
complete.
"I would encourage anyone to
join," said Butkovic, "and there's no
better time than when you're right
out of college."
