In Cabanas, a cool, mountain vil
lage in western Honduras, Peace
Corps volunteer Tania Butkovic
spent two years training midwives in
modern birthing techniques and set
up a clinic for pregnant rural
women.
Surrounded by coffee planta
tions and jungle, Cabanas is a re
mote community, yet for Butkovic,
Class of '94, the hardships of isola
tion amounted to little in compari
son with the personal rewards she
gained.
Although her experience was
unique, Butkovic is representative
of more than 1,000 Stanford gradu
ates who have enrolled in the Peace
Corps during the program's 36-year
history.

In a letter to University Presi

Director Mark Gearan announced
this week that Stanford ranks l()th
among all colleges and universities
in producing Peace Corps volun

"Throughout its history, the
Peace Corps can trace much of its
success to the energy and idealism
of American college students,"
Gearan wrote in his letter. "These
colleges and universities are to be
commended for producing students
committed to making a difference,
with a thirst for adventure, and with
the desire to experience a new cul

Since the Peace Corps was
founded in 1961 by President John
F. Kennedy, 1,240 Stanford gradu
ates have joined the program. UC-

Berkeley tops the list with 2,%()
graduates, followed closely by the
University of Wisconsin, the Uni
versity of Washington and Harvard
University.
According to Peace Corps Re
gional Director Maryann Murray,
"For most volunteers, the Peace
Corps is a turning point in their
lives. It is the start of a whole new
way of looking at the world."
At present, there are 6,5(K) Peace
Corps volunteers serving in 87 coun
tries, primarily in Africa, the former
Soviet Union, Latin America,
Southeast Asia and the South Pacif
