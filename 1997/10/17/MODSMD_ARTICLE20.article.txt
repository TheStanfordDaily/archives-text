Why the band was wrong:
an education
We all (at Stanford) know the Band is
well, the Band. I didn't see the show, hut I
can understand the intended humor of hav
ing both a cardinal (Stanford) and a nun
(Notre Dame) in the Band and making lots
of jokes about drinking — and therefore
drunken Irishmen. I know that band mem
bers are not prejudiced and did not intend
to appear that way. However, 1 am dis
turbed by the general reaction to com
plaints about the show.
I have heard lot of indignant remarks
from the Band and numerous other stu
dents that center around the show being
"satire" and "free speech." In other words,
"We were just trying to have fun!"
But that doesn't excuse ignorance, and
it doesn't excuse appearances.
Ignorance is failing to understand that
for decades the caricature of nuns and the
stereotype of the poor, drunken Paddy,
have gone hand in hand with bigotry and
discrimination. In fact, to most Catholics
they have become the verv symbols of dis

crimination, in the same way that blackface
and the character of Aunt Jemima became
symbols of racial discrimination.
The image of Act Up protesters dressed
as nuns dancing in the street while
protesters broke into churches, disrupted
the Mass and desecrated the Eucharist is
still fresh in many Catholics minds. Even
more salient, however, is the picture of
police lined up outside churches across the
country, allowing it to happen.
My first memory of bigotry is elemen
tary classmates taunting me and pretending
to be nuns. My latest memory of bigotry is
a Stanford class that studied those protests
in which the professor didn't bother with
the question of why they were allowed to
happen or whether they were a legitimate
form a free speech or whether they
infringed on anybody's rights.
Perhaps that is why educated Stanford
students were ignorant enough of the histo
ry and culture of another group not to
foresee the obvious way their "fun" would
be interpreted.
You can't incorporate two of the most
offensive symbols to Catholics into a show
meant to poke fun at the other team and

not expect to be misinterpreted.
Catholics form an integral and neces
sary part of the Stanford community and
are the largest single religious identity on
campus. The show, as a public expression
of the Stanford community, was unaccept
able and gave an incorrect impression of
the nature of the Stanford community. The
Stanford community prides itself on diver
sity, tolerance and respect for all cultures
— not ignorance.

P.S. For all those claiming to simply "sati
rize" the Irish mascot: the team name is
the"the Fighting Irish" (as in the Cardinal)
and the mascot is a leprechaun not a
stereotypical "drinking Irishman."
Encouraging public service
As representatives of the student com
munity at the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice, we feel compelled to clarify and
address some of the concerns and views
expressed in last Friday's Daily regarding
the Haas Center, its groups, and the stu-

dents who participate there.
In order to be affiliated with the Haas
Center, groups must undergo a rigorous
affiliation process to assure that the groups
are of high quality and that the group will
continue to exist beyond the end of the
year. In addition, group affiliation is
reviewed on a yearly basis. To help avoid
the creation of new groups that essentially
do the same thing as pre-existing groups,
students who approach the Haas Center
with ideas for new service groups are
referred to groups working on similar
issues.
A majority of Haas groups focus on
East Palo Alto youth. From after school
sports to teaching environmental education
classes, and from student council mentor
ing to technology-related service projects,
there is a wide variety of service opportuni
ties to be found at the Haas Center for stu
dents of all academic disciplines and with
any available time commitment.
Nearly every Haas group offers the
opportunity to work directly with chil
dren and other members of the communi
ty beyond the Stanford border. The
bonds of friendship forged from these

interactions often last long after the
school year ends.
Despite the low volunteer turnout some
groups have experienced this year, the
Haas Center continues to house nearly 40
service groups that operate at a level of
sophistication and quality unmatched any
where in the country. The students who
run and participate in these programs are
dedicated, motivated individuals who
spend countless hours ensuring the success
of their particular service programs and
building a strong and positive relationship
with the community.
Some groups still are looking for more
volunteers. We highly encourage all Stan
ford students to stop by the Haas Center
and check out the myriad of service oppor
tunities available there.
