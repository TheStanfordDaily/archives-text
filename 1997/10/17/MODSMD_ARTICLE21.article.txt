## Keep your shoes on — a lack of liberal nudists in Oxford 
### 
Tienlon Ho

Yesterday, i went to the gro
cery store naked. I got a lot of
looks, all of them pretty disapprov
ing. I think it was because of the Tevas.
A middle-aged woman who had been
thumping the tomatoes looked at me over
imaginary spectacles and shook her head.
"You should cover your feet," she said
harshly. Actually, it sounded beautiful,
"Yeu shoult cuva yowr feet," but it was
scolding, nonetheless.
So, it was really only my feet that were
naked. But because she wasn't the only one
to look me over and turn away with embar
rassed disapproval, I've decided that
English people around Oxford at least
equate naked feet with naked people. And
they don't like my feet, or maybe they just
don't like feet at all.
It's a little confusing because most of the
stores up and down the streets sell shoes. If
they sell any type of clothing — official
school ties, cashmere pea coats or Ameri
can-made T-shirts — they sell shoes. And
the styles are only those on the latest fash
ion plates — big, chunky-heeled and black.
Look up and down the street, and that's all
that can be seen, the same heavy black
boots and loafers pounding the sidewalks.

But if they really loved their feet, the
shoes would be comfortable.
At first I attributed the comfort factor
compromise to the rain. Up to 30 inches of
it falls per year around here, and little
breathing holes or cushiony fabric in shoe
tops encourage puddle invasion. The acidity
of the water probably can eat away any
good Italian leather, especially if it is thin
and flexible. And besides, feet get cold in
this place, and maybe the style these days is
a practical one. Thicker insulation equals
warmer feet. Gunkier heels equal built-in
dry platforms.

But it's all a

lie. On two
clear, sunny,
80 degree
afternoons,
everyone was
wearing those
same black
shoes along
with socks.
I've decided
that their cus-

torn for hidden feet is all
a part of the English
penchant to hide things.

I'm sure of it.
Consider my conversation with an
instructor at Oxford University's zoology
department. He has studied tortoises in the
Galapagos, traveled to the Alps to sample
butterflies, has witnessed incredible beauty
and made new discoveries in his research.
And in describing all this to me, he said that
it was interesting work. That's about all he
said, though he said it using several different
synonyms: nice, engaging, quite neat. His
Scottish co-worker leaned over to me,
understanding my bewilderment and
explained that it is the English way to
understate enthusiasm.

Other things around Oxford's col

leges suggest similar atti-

tudes. I say the

libraries hide the books from us. The
Bodleian's renowned reputation as a haven
for the writings of humanity does not
include a reputation for accessibility. This is
no Meyer Library, where a Stanford 11) gets
you through, and you're off and ready to
highlight everything.
Here, after being given permission to
attend an orientation session, books
become mystical commodities that have to
be requested a day in advance. Librarians
fetch the book from the stacks somewhere
in the bowels of the building, and eventual
ly it shows up in a patrolled reading room.
There it must stay, and there you must go to
read it. Searching through a card catalogue
of six million books is definitely not my idea
of accessibility.
Also, take for instance some of the food
I've seen around here. There's something
on sale for one pound and pence at the
supermarket called, load in the Hole. Its
name alone hints at something hidden and
secretive, after all, who but the English
would know what it is in the first place? It
turns out, it's much akin to our Pigs in a
Blanket® only the toad namesake hints at a
bit more sneaking about. And it you don't
believe this, at least believe me that many

English dishes involve breading or frying or
thick opaque sauces. You can't see those
potatoes under all the other stuff.
And finally, while this may not be con
vincing evidence, it seems a little too coin
cidental that the English accent we all
admire is nothing more than a slide of one
vowel quickly into the next so that one is no
more prominent than another, l'he English
avoid long vowel or prolonged consonant
sounds, never speaking a plain 'a' as in the
'cane 1 of 'arcane.' Instead, they hide it and
give it another identity as the letter 'ae,'
which is pronounced with a quick shift from
the hard 'a' sound to the 'eh.' I say, all this
talk is just another sign of the concealing
syndrome.
Believe what I've seen around here or
not, I of course am not going to knowingly
run around breaking all English traditions
of secrecy, including the taboos, with naked
feet. I've gone shopping a couple times in
search of something other than my typical
Stanford footwear. But until I find the per
fect pair and plenty of cash, 1 apologize to
England for my toes.
