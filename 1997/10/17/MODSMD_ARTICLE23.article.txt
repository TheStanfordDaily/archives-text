Before the season, not many people pointed to Stan
ford's game against Arizona State as its most important
of the year.

But tomorrow's matchup with the Sun Devils (4-2,2-
1 Pacific 10 Conference) at Stanford Stadium has be
come just that.
By virtue of its loss to Arizona last Saturday, No. 25

Stanford (4-2, 2-1) now faces the reality that one more
Pac-1() loss would probably put an end to the its Rose
Bowl chances.
"We have to win to keep ourselves in contention for
what we believe to be the ultimate prize in our confer
ence," said Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham.
The Cardinal needs a victory not only to keep alive
the chance for a conference championship, but to regain
the confidence it had developed before last week's 2K-22
upset loss to Arizona.
The loss to the Wildcats was Stanford's first confer
ence loss in seven games. Undoubtedly it was the Cardi
nal's worst performance of the year, taking away the mo
mentum gained from a resounding win over Notre
Dame and a No. 16 national ranking.
Against Arizona, Stanford fumbled the ball away five
times, the most turnovers by a Cardinal team during
Willingham's tenure.
"It was a frustrating experience to turn the ball over
the way we did," said senior fullback Jon Ritchie. "We
could never get established as an offense."
Another problem was the running game, which had
been so potent in previous weeks. Stanford's ground at-

tack was completely shut down by
the Wildcats' defense. The Cardinal
only rushed for 11 yards on 33 car
i ies, including the 41 yards lost when
sophomore quarterback Chad
1 lutchinson was sacked 4 times.
The offensive line's play was poor
all game, leading to many of Stan
ford's offensive woes.
"It all comes down on the shoul
ders of the guys who are blocking,"
Ritchie said. "On Saturday, as block
ers, we didn't execute to the level we
have."
In fact, Arizona controlled both
lines of scrimmage, a troubling sign
for Stanford. While the Cardinal's
run defense was good, Stanford did
not record a sack, the first time this
season it has had fewer than three in
a game.
Now Stanford must host the Sun
Devils, the defending Pac-10 cham
pions. Last season Arizona State
clobbered the Cardinal 41-9 at Stan
ford Stadium en route to an 11 -1 sea
son.
But this year's team from Tempe
has a much different look. Of the 22
Sun Devils who started in the Rose
Bowl last January, 11 are currently in
the NFL.
That leaves this year's squad
young at many positions. The Sun
Devils are not destroying opponents
like last year and have already sur
passed their loss total of a year ago.

But like last season's Rose Bowl
team, Arizona State features an
outstanding defense that has played
especially well of late. After their
35-7 pasting of USC last week, the
Sun Devils are tied with Stanford
and UCLA in the conference stand
ings.
"We're feeling pretty good about
ourselves," said Arizona State head
coach Bruce Snyder. "We've played
well at times and not so well at times.
But [the win against USC] was our
best performance to date."
The Sun Devils' defense current
ly ranks as the top scoring defense in
the Pac-10, allowing a paltry 13
points per game. The pass defense in
particular has been outstanding.
Opponents are completing less
than 45 percent of their passes
against Arizona State. Statistically,
the Sun Devils have the 10th-ranked
pass defense in the nation and have
intercepted twice as many passes
(eight) as they have allowed for
touchdowns (four).
"They are really exceptional in
the secondary," Willingham said.
"Their corners (senior Jason Sim
mons and sophomore Courtney
Jackson) may be the best in the con
ference."
The Sun Devils' best all-around
defensive performer is senior line
backer Pat Tillman. Tillman, a San
Jose native, tormented Stanford last
year with an interception, a fumble
recovery, and a team-leading eight
tackles.
On the other side of the ball, Ari

zona State has many similarities to
Stanford. The Sun Devils have an
outstanding duo at tailback, play
making wide receivers, and an offen
sive line that has been inconsistent.
They may not have scored as many
points as the Cardinal, but if last
week's game against USC is any in
dication, the offense is coming to
gether.
The Sun Devils are particularly
inexperienced at quarterback. Red
shirt freshman Ryan Kealy is start
ing in his first year of eligibility and
has performed well under the cir
cumstances. Against the Trojans,
Kealy passed for 281 yards and three
touchdowns, both career highs,
while facing one of the best secon
daries in the nation.
Sophomore J R. Redmond and
senior Michael Martin share time at
tailback. Like Stanford's tandem of
seniors Anthony Bookman and
Mike Mitchell, both Redmond and
Martin rank in the top 10 in rushing
in the Pac-10.
Arizona State's offensive line fea
tures two freshman starters and has
had tremendous difficulty protecting
Kealy — the Sun Devils are the only
conference team that has allowed
more sacks than Stanford. But they
have recently developed some cohe
sion, having played with the same
lineup for two straight weeks, and
the line play improved dramatically
against USC.
Meanwhile, the Stanford defense
has been improving. The Cardinal
has limited its opponent to less than

300 yards of total offense in each of
the past two games.
But Stanford has had a terrible
time stopping opponents inside its
own 20-yard line. In 18 trips to the
red zone, opponents have racked up
an astounding 14 touchdowns and
two field goals. In the last three
games, opponents have scored nine
touchdowns in 10 trips inside the 20
— and eight of the nine have been
come through the air.
"It's always execution," said se
nior linebacker Chris Draft, who re
turned from missing three games to
lead Stanford in tackles against Ari
zona. "Our coaches will make a per
fect call (inside the 20) and we just
didn't execute. It's just making the
routine plays."
Whatever it needs to work on,
Stanford has to regroup from its
stinging loss and play well tomorrow.
The winner of this game will stay in
the running for the conference
crown; the loser will drop into the
middle of the pack.
The Cardinal has won five
straight at Stanford Stadium, and
nine of 11 games overall. But this will
be a stiff test between two evenly
matched teams.
And with a bye next weeiv, the
Cardinal needs to win to prepare for
a November stretch that features
four tough conference games and a
chance to push for the Rose Bowl.
"I would hope we'd have a better
record than 4-2," Willingham said.
"But we are where we are, and we
have to improve from that point."
