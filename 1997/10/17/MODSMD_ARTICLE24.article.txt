# Spikers battle foes, miles on Northern trip

### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
It used to be that a trip to Washington was a one-night
affair for the Stanford women's volleyball team.
Head coach Don Shaw would leave with his squad
Saturday morning, travel to Seattle and face Washington
that night. Sunday morning the team would fly to
Spokane, then make the 90-minute drive to Pullman,
Wash., for an afternoon match against Washington State.
Shaw would remind his players that in order to make
their flight home, they needed a quick, three-game victo
ry over the Cougars. The Card would do just that and re
turn to the Farm Sunday night after being gone little
more than 36 hours.

■ TONIGHT: No. 4 Stanford (16-2,7-0) al No. 10 Wash
ington State (17-2,5-2), 7 p.m. Radio: KZSU-FM (90.1)
■ TOMORROW: Stanford at No. 21 Washington (10-6
5-2), 7 p.m. Radio: KZSU-FM (90.1)

That was then. That was before the Washington
schools became Pacific 10 Conference contenders and
before the trip to Washington became the single biggest
weekend on Stanford's conference schedule.
"We used to get away with it," Shaw said. "Neither
team was very good. T"his is probably the toughest trip
these days. The travel makes it hard. It's the one place
where we travel between matches."
Last season Stanford's only Pac-10 loss came in Pull
man, and this year the fourth-ranked Card (16-2, 7-0)
puts its two-match conference lead on the line as it con
cludes the first half of the Pac-10 season.
No. 10 Washington State (17-2, 5-2) is first up for the
Card tonight. Stanford faces No. 21 Washington (10-6,5-
2) tomorrow. Both matches are at 7 p.m., and with USC
boasting a 6-2 conference mark, this weekend's matches
could have a major impact on the standings.
"It takes a little pressure off," Shaw said of Stanford's
two-match lead. "Even if we lose two, we're still tied for
first place. Obviously we want to win, but it's never an
easy trip."
Two weeks ago the match against the Cougars was
shaping up as a clash for first between two undefeated
Pac-10 teams. But Washington State has dropped two of
its last three matches, including a four-game loss to the
Huskies last weekend, and has slipped in the polls.
That's not to say the Cougars won't give Stanford a
run for its money. Last season's second-place conference
finish was Washington State's best ever, and with five re
turning starters, the Cougars look to be just as tough this
year.
But Washington State's lone graduating starter from
last season was All-American Sarah Silvernail. Silvernail
was last year's AVCA National Player of the Year and
totaled 649 kills with a .405 hitting percentage.
One of the most difficult tasks for the Cardinal this
weekend will be adjusting to two totally different styles
of play.
"With Washington State, it's hard to put a finger on
it," Shaw said. "They don't do anything in an orthodox
manner. Washington is more of a power team, a blocking
team. They move around a lot and try to match up."
The Huskies also return five starters from a team that
finished third in the Pac-10 last season, and head coach
Bill Neville says this is the best team he's ever had.
Despite a slow start, Washington has come on strong
lately with big wins over No. 15 Arizona and Washington
State and is certainly geared up for its shot against the Card.
"It's hard to play two teams in one weekend that are
good and s« different," Shaw said. "Everybody's gun
ning for us. It's the big game on everybody's schedule
when Stanford comes to town."
