MEN'S SOCCER

■ SUNDAY: No. 6 Stanford (10-0-2,2-0-1)
vs. California (8-3-1, 2-1) at New Maloney
Field, 2 p.m.

Cal (8-3-1,2-1) was the last team to de
feat the Cardinal, which extended its un
beaten streak to 17 games after a win and a
tie last weekend in league matches.
The loss at Berkeley almost exactly a
year ago should "add a little bit more inccn
tive" to win this year, said head coach
Bobby Clark. "Last year we thought we de
served more out of the game at Berkeley."
Since then, Stanford has won 15 games
over two seasons and ended two games in
double-overtime 0-0 ties. A 1-0 win over
then-No. H Washington last Friday helped
move the Cardinal up to its highest-ever na
tional ranking.'Hie only MPSF team ranked
higher than Stanford is UCLA, which has
held steady at No. 2 for several weeks.
With a win in Sunday's match, Stanford
will move on to play the M PSF Pacific I )ivi
sion champion — likely UCLA — for the
federation title. 'Hie federation champion
gets an automatic bid to the 32-team

N( 'A A tournament.
Although Cal is Stanford's perpetual
archrival in soccer as in football, the impor
tance of a victory this weekend lies with the
division title, ('lark said,
"It's a huge game for us because it puts
us that little bit closer to getting to the tour
nament," he said. "The players all set their
sights on that at the beginning of the year."
The matchup should result in what
Clark called "one of the best games of the
season that will be played at New Maloney
Field."
Cal has had a season of ups and downs,
as indicated by a 4-0 loss to Washington last
Sunday.
Most recently, the Hears topped Chico
State 4-1 at home Wednesday. By compar
ison, Stanford beat Chico State .VI in its
home opener in September. Last weekend,
( 'a I also chalked up a 3-1 victory over Ore
gon State, a team that battled the Cardinal
to a ()-() tie in overtime on Sunday.
One of the preseason Ml'Sb favorites,
the Bears can pose a challenge because of
frequent changes in their style of play, ('lark
said.
" They'll play some long ball, but they'll
also try to play a little bit shorter," he said.
"It's a mixed game."
Cal also varies between a man-to-man
game and the /one style favored by the Car
dinal.
After its loss to Washington, Cal made
some changes to its lineup, so Clark isn't
sure what to expect.
But he reiterated his opinion that what
Cal does won't necessarily matter. "If our
team does our work right and comes out
with the right attitude, I don't think we need
to fear any team," he said.
Ilie win is "in our own hands," Clark
added.
