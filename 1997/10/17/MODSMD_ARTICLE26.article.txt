be characterized by a string of wins against
Eastern teams such as Brown and I farvard.
Hut the style of play on the East Coast
differs from West Coast water polo.
"They're a typical East Coast team," Det
tamanti said. "We usually have an advan
tage in speed."
Walburger agreed.
"Navy is kind of a slower team," he said.
"What we need to do is capitalize on their
mistakes."
Walburger added that the Cardinal is
looking forward to a home match and is
setting its sights on long-term goals.
"What we hope for is a shake-up in the
rankings," he said.
