# Stanford, Cal try to get on track
## Both teams searching for first conference win in 4 p.m. match 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
If the Cardinal women's soccer
team ever needed a stunt double,
California would be it.
The teams resemble each other in
almost every respect —and both are
fired up for today's 4 p.m. matchup
at New Maloney Field.

■ TODAY: Stanford (4-7, 0-2) vs.
California (5-6-1, 0-2) at New Mal
oney Field, 4 p.m.
■ SUNDAY: Stanford at USF.
"On this day, records and stand
ings and everything else is out the
window," said senior midfielder and
team co-captain Emily Burt. "We're
playing Cal."
But if the rivalry wasn't so strong,
the Cardinal (4-7,0-2 Pacific 10 Con
ference) might not even notice that it
was playing another team.
For one, Cal's Pac-10 record (5-6-
1,0-2) is the same as Stanford's. Both
teams lost both their Pac-10 season
openers to No. 18 UCLA and No. 20
USC last weekend. Both teams lost
both games by only a goal.
As Stanford was losing 3-2 to USC
last Friday, Cal had its hands full with
the Bruins across the Bay. After
UCLA's Traci Arkenburg scored on
a head-in 28 minutes into the game,
Cal nearly scored the equalizer with
only 12 minutes left when sophomore
Amy Bavalac rocketed the ball to

wards the corner of the goal from 17
yards out.
Bruin goalie Lindsay Culp dove at
the ball and barely deflected it. Cal
lost 1-0.
On Sunday, as Stanford fought
out a tough 2-1 loss against UCLA,
Cal was losing to USC 2-1. Cal, a play
er down after an ejection, preserved a
1 -1 tie for 60 minutes, but USC won it
on a goal at the 72-minute mark.
Indeed, the two teams' luck — or
lack of it — have run parallel. All sea
son, fate has seemingly had it in for
the Cardinal, as its frequent out
shooting and out-playing of oppo
nents hasn't metamorphosed into
victories. The Cardinal, despite its
disappointing record, has outshot op
ponents 153-86.
Cal can sympathize. Although
their shooting proficiency hasn't
been that of the Cardinal's, the Bears
have outshot opponents 168-150.
Both teams are also relatively
young. The Bears, with only six up
perclassmen anchoring the 24-person
squad, has the definitive edge on
youth. But Stanford can at least aim
pare, sporting only three seniors and
six juniors on its club.
Most importantly, both teams are
looking to use today's game to get
back on track.
"To get to the postseason, we need
to try to win all of the rest of our
games," Burt said. "Getting into the
playoffs is definitely still one of our
goals."
Granted, the Cardinal's recent
strong play hasn't produced many

victories. But there's nothing the Car
dinal can do but march on and wait
for the shots to fall into place.
"'lTie most important thing for us
right now is making sure we keep
coming out onto the field at 1(X) per
cent," said junior forward Tracye
Lawyer. "Things haven't fallen our

way, but we have to keep up."
At least the rivalry will help keep
adrenaline flowing.
"'lTie fact that we're playing Cal
won't change our game plan,"
Lawyer said, "but it will change our
attitudes. It's just that much more in
centive to play as hard as we can."

a win over Cal today to keep their already dim postseason hopes
alive.
