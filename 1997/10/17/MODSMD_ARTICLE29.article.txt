## Stunning new research just in! 
### 
This just in...

After intense debate the federal government has final
ly funded research investigating the medicinal uses of
marijuana. Prof. Manfred Manlisson (pictured below left)
has been one of the first to use these funds. According to a
personal ethical system that Prof. Manlisson stringently
maintains he conducted most of the experiments on him
self. Here is the journal to his first experiment.
5 p.m. Took the first dose. Was not prepared for the large
amount of coughing, reminds me of my first cigarette.
5:15 p.m. No apparent effect. Administered second dose.
Coughed just as much as last time.

5:31 p.m. Still no apparent
effect. Am late in entering
this entry because I was hun
gry and needed to fix myself
a meal. Went to the laborato
ry kitchenette only to discov
er there was nothing but ice
cream and cheese in the
refrigerator. Melted the
cheese onto the ice cream in
the microwave and ate until
there was none left. After
I've finished this 1 think I'll
lick the bottom of the

microwave to get some of the cheese that spilt over.

5:39 p.m. A man came to deliver some supplies to the
laboratory. I was suspicious of him, as I am of any mine
who has a gnome coming out of his nostril. This man
had gnomes coming out of both nostrils. He asked me
why my eyes were red. I told him it was because I was
tired. I found that pretty funny, or at least there must be
some reason for my laughing for eight minutes while
alone in the bathroom. Still no apparent effect; took third
dose.
5:45 p.m. Still no symptoms. Not much to do in the labo
ratory, have spent last six minutes looking at the palm of
my hand. It's weird. Why do we have four fingers, why not
three or five? And those lines on your palm, it's like
they're a map or something. It's like they're a map to your
mind. And what if my hand was someone else's hand, but
their hand was my hand, you know what I'm saying? It's
weird.
5:48 p.m. Have you ever thought that maybe every speck
of dust was a just a very small dust? And our universe
was just a speck in a really big universe. Imagine how
big that Universe would be. It would have to be really
big.
5:55 p.m. Sometimes scientific research can lead you into
uncharted realms in philosophy. I sat back after my fourth
dose and pondered. And then it hit me: God, G-O-D; Dog,
D-O-G. God is dog, but it's backward. That's really weird,

don't you think. It
must mean something,
but what? I'm scared.
6:05 p.m. You know
what the best bit in
Sgt. Pepper's is? It's
that bit at the end. Not
the weird bit, but the
piano bit. Where it's
just "BRAAMMM,"
you know? It's like ten
pianos going "BRAM
MM," and it's the end.

But it's not the end. It's just the end of the album. In tact,
it's not even the end of the album, because there's still the
weird bit. It's the end but it's not the end. It's like Jerry
Garcia. He calls his band The Grateful Dead and now he's
dead. Jerry was a prophet, he knew he was going to die,
that's why he called them The Grateful Dead and not the
Chippy Grape Monks or something. . . .

At this point Prof. Manlisson starts a long stream of
consciousness poem that is, more or less, completely inco
herent.
The last comprehensible entry is at 10 p.m. where he
writes, "Watched the first episode of The Oval's second
series. These people aren't funny, they 're just obscene."
