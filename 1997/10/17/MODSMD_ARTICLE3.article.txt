Touching on subjects as diverse
as the Stanford Band and the Sand
Hill Road project, University
President Gerhard Casper re
viewed his tenure at Stanford and
looked ahead to the future in his

annual State of the University ad
dress yesterday.
His speech was drawn from a
pamphlet he had written, "Cares
of the University."
Among other issues, Casper
commented on the University's
policy regarding the First Amend
ment and Stanford taking a posi
tion on political issues as an insti

tution.
The issue of free speech has
come up recently due to contro
versy surrounding the Band's half
time performance at the Oct. 4
football game against Notre
Dame. Complaints that the show
was insensitive to Catholics and
Irish people prompted the I Jniver
sity to apologize formally and ban
the Band from three years of
Notre Dame games.
Casper said the Band cannot
claim protection under the First
Amendment for halftime shows.
In its performance, the Band sim
ply "lacked the plain civility of or
dinary people."
In other business, Casper ap
plauded the success of the academ
ic programs commenced during
his tenure.
Since he came to the University
five years ago, Casper has worked
with Vice Provost for Undergrad
uate Education Ramon Saldivar to
implement, among other pro
grams, Stanford Introductory
Seminars, which offers freshmen
and sophomores the opportunity
to participate in smaller classes
with more senior faculty members.
"I am prouder of nothing more
than lam proud of the Stanford In
troductory Seminars," Casper
said.
The president also discussed
the financial status of the Universi
ty, saying Stanford is working to
build an endowment that will con
tribute a larger share of the total
revenue for the University.
"1 read that Stanford is wealthy,
but it does not feel that way when
we have to raise K4 to SN percent of
our budget each year anew,"
Casper said.
On another important note,
Casper briefed the audience on the
