## 
### 
"...Hey, Jesus, do that thing where you walk
on water."
"Aw, I don't know guys, you saw me do that
last week."
"Not everybody saw it. Hey guys have you
seen Jesus walking on the water?"
"He can walk on the water? No way!"
"That'd be rad. You've got to do it, Jesus."
"Yeah Jesus, don't be a spoilsport."
"Oh, all right, but this'll be the last time..."

"All right! Hey Bill go fill the bath up. You're not going to believe it when
you see this."
OK, here we go. Just let me take my shoes off. There, I'm on the
water. Can I go now?"
"Whoa! How does he do that?"
"Didn't I tell you it would be amazing? Jesus has the best party tricks,
I'm telling you. Hey, Jesus do that water to wine thing."
"What?"
"Remember when you turned that water to wine at Herb and Wil
son's?"
"Oh, yeah, I remember."
"You can do it with the water in the tub."
"Guys, I just did the walking thing..."
"Dia you hear that? Jesus is afraid of drinking an entire bathtub of
water..."
"Man, Jesus is a wuss"...
