Doctors are in
general agreement
these days that
there is no all
body, cardiovas
cular exercise as
efficient as rolling
a boulder up a hill
for eternity. Not
only does it
strengthen but
tocks, calves,
abdominals, and
arms, tests show
that it will also pro-

long your life. Even if that life is spent doing nothing other than exercise.
Sadly, however, up until now rolling a boulder up a cliff for eternity
has been very difficult to do for those who have little time in their hec
tic schedules. But now the people who invented The Walking Up Stairs
Machine bring you The Sisyphus, a machine designed to bring mean
ingless toil into the comfort of your own home.
Are you the sort of person who likes to exercise for no other reason
than doing the same exercise a little bit faster the next time? This
machine is for you. Are you the sort of person who toils on an exercise
bike for 30 minutes, without going anywhere? The Sisyphus is even
better, believe me.
Order now and trade your soul for lower cholesterol and your free
will for great pectorals. It's got to be worth it.

can be used at home as well.
