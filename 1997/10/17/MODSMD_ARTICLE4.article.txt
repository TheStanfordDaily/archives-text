Rather than bear the winter
rains on the Farm this year, why
not head to the beach? "It's a se
cret too well kept," said Prof.
Mark Denny, who teaches at
Hopkins Marine Station two
hours south of Palo Alto.
Hopkins is a marine biology re
search center located in Pacific
Grove in Monterey, about 90
miles from Stanford. Hopkins is a
branch of the Biology Depart
ment and is adjacent to the Mon
terey Bay Aquarium as well as an
offshore marine reserve.
Juniors usually participate in
this program and the most promi
nent majors of these students are
biology, human biology and earth
systems. However, anyone inter
ested in science can attend, re
gardless of major or year at Stan
ford.
Hilary Waites, a senior major
ing in biology, went to Hopkins
for three summers, a winter and a
spring program, and she is the stu
dent representative for the pro
gram. Waites described Hopkins
as "an intense academic and a fun
social experience."
"All the classes are science-re
lated, and you can talk to the pro
fessors a lot. They ask you to call
you by their first name on the first
day of classes," Waites said.

"That's something that doesn't
happen a lot at Stanford.
"In their free time, students
have barbecues and parties, go
surfing, scuba dive, go hiking and,
of course, visit the aquarium right
next to us," she said.
Michelle Forgy, a senior also
majoring in biological sciences,
went to Hopkins last winter. lie
cause Hopkins does not provide
housing for the students, Forgy
explained that many students rent
apartments or homes, and some
students live with families nearby.
"The faculty is talking of in
vesting in an apartment building
in order to house the growing
number of students," Waites
added.
The program is closed to Stan
ford undergraduates during the
fall when professors work closely
with graduate students on re
search. The winter quarter is ded
icated to classes provided through
the Biology Department. Under
graduates have the opportunity to
conduct research during the
spring quarter. The summer quar
ter includes both classes and re
search.
"The research [in the spring]
allows students to work one-on
one with a professor, which is not
as easy to do at Stanford," Waites
