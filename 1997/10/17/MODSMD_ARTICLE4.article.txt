# Hopkins station offers marine biology studies

Rather than bear the winter
rains on the Farm this year, why
not head to the beach? "It's a se
cret too well kept," said Prof.
Mark Denny, who teaches at
Hopkins Marine Station two
hours south of Palo Alto.
Hopkins is a marine biology re
search center located in Pacific
Grove in Monterey, about 90
miles from Stanford. Hopkins is a
branch of the Biology Depart
ment and is adjacent to the Mon
terey Bay Aquarium as well as an
offshore marine reserve.
Juniors usually participate in
this program and the most promi
nent majors of these students are
biology, human biology and earth
systems. However, anyone inter
ested in science can attend, re
gardless of major or year at Stan
ford.
Hilary Waites, a senior major
ing in biology, went to Hopkins
for three summers, a winter and a
spring program, and she is the stu
dent representative for the pro
gram. Waites described Hopkins
as "an intense academic and a fun
social experience."
"All the classes are science-re
lated, and you can talk to the pro
fessors a lot. They ask you to call
you by their first name on the first
day of classes," Waites said.

"That's something that doesn't
happen a lot at Stanford.
"In their free time, students
have barbecues and parties, go
surfing, scuba dive, go hiking and,
of course, visit the aquarium right
next to us," she said.
Michelle Forgy, a senior also
majoring in biological sciences,
went to Hopkins last winter. lie
cause Hopkins does not provide
housing for the students, Forgy
explained that many students rent
apartments or homes, and some
students live with families nearby.
"The faculty is talking of in
vesting in an apartment building
in order to house the growing
number of students," Waites
added.
The program is closed to Stan
ford undergraduates during the
fall when professors work closely
with graduate students on re
search. The winter quarter is ded
icated to classes provided through
the Biology Department. Under
graduates have the opportunity to
conduct research during the
spring quarter. The summer quar
ter includes both classes and re
search.
"The research [in the spring]
allows students to work one-on
one with a professor, which is not
as easy to do at Stanford," Waites

said. "The entire focus is on under
grads."
Hopkins, opened in 1892, was
the first marine laboratory estab
lished on the Pacific coast. The
spring section has been open since
the early 19605, while the winter
quarter is in its fourth year.
Denny, along with eight other
professors, teaches at Hopkins.
After 15 years of teaching there, he
described the intellectual atmos
phere as "intense but fun" because
students can focus on their interests
and design their own projects.
Denny said that due to the small
number of students at Hopkins, the
group is "socially cohesive" and
"like a big family."
According to both Waites and
Forgy, the application is not at all
competitive. Waites explained,
"I've never known of a student
who's been turned away from the
winter program. Anyone interest
ed should definitely apply."
Although all science-oriented,
the classes during winter and sum
mer quarters are quite varied.
Some include the study of zoology,
neurology, ecology and animal

physiology.
Forgy described the quarter at
Hopkins as "a really good overall
experience." Waites agreed, "The
best experience in the biology de
partment is definitely at Hopkins."
"The atmosphere here is excel
lent," said Dennis Powers, director
of Hopkins. "In a recent review of
the program, most students said it
was the best experience they had
had for their entire four years at
Stanford."
In spite of these great recom
mendations, not many students
take advantage of this experience.
Only between 20 and 30 students
participate each quarter, thus al
lowing some unfilled spots. Denny
described the program as "under
utilized," and Waites added, "I
can't understand why more people
are not in the program."
The faculty is excited to have an
increasing number of students as
more discover this relatively un
known program. Students do not
have to major in the sciences, but
they simply have to "be interested
in life on earth," Denny said.
Applications for this next winter
quarter are due by Oct. 23. They are
located in the Student Services Of
fices in the biology, human biology
and the earth systems departments.
