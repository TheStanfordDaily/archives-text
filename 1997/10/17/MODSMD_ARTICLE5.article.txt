# Center evaluating current medical scene
## Report card on health 
### Terry Hwang 
Medical School Dean Eugene
Bauer last month announced the
formation of a new multidiscipli
nary program to evaluate the cur
rent status of health care.
The Center for Evaluation of
Health Practices and Advancement
of Primary Care will pull together
faculty members and students from
different departments of the Med
ical School, as well as the rest of the
University.
"It's two centers, really, and they
both tie together key parts of the
Stanford community, such as the
Medical School and Department of
Economics." said Assoc. Medicine
Prof. Alan (iarber, the head of the
project.
(iarber said the center shows I he
medical world Stanford's dedica
tion to multidisciplinary research.
Doctors, lawyers and economists, as
well as students, will be involved in
the project, all working for the bet
terment of patient care, he said.
"Outcomes research" — the
measure of which treatments are
most cost-effective and helpful to
patients — "is a complicated field,"
said Medicine Dept. Chair Judith
Swain. "But Dr. (iarber is a man
who has managed to gain high re
spect in both the world of medicine
and economics. Really, what we're
doing is forming the country's pre
mier institution for training future
doctors in health economics and
outcomes research."

The new eenter is only one of the
major changes the Stanford Medical
C enter has seen in the past year. A
merger of the Stanford Medical
( enter and IK'SF's Medical ( enter
into UCSF-Stanford Health Care
was approved in September.
The project has four main goals:
advancement of primary care prac
tice, formation of concrete guide
lines for primary care givers, out
comes research and the evaluation
of new medical technologies.
"We're giving the field of medi
cine a report card," Swain said.
(jarber said he wants students to
be involved.
"The center will provide oppor
tunities lor all levels, undergradu
ates to residents," he said. "From
here, you'll get a bird's-eye view of
the status of the health care profes
sion."
Health care in the Hay Area has
gone through a significant growing
up stage in the past decade or so,
(iarber said 111 a news release. Doc
tors no longer can base their treat
ments solely on what they think will
be most effective for the patient.
Physician groups in the area have
to deal with aggressive cost-cutting
schemes in order to stay competitive
and efficient, he said, which means
doctors need organizations such as
the center to recommend tech
niques to best resolve the "cheap
but effective" health care dilemma.
"We need to ask ourselves which
