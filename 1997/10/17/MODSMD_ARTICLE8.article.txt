# Prof receives Packard fellowship

A Stanford associate professor who aims to
make such futuristic technologies as the Global
Positioning System affordable to the everyday
consumer has just received one of the nation's
most prestigious fellowships.
Thomas Lee, associate professor of electrical
engineering, was recently awarded a five-year,
$ l(X),(XX)-pcr-year endowment from the David
and Lucile Packard Foundation. The foundation,
based in Ix>s Altos, seeks "to allow the nation's
most promising young professors to pursue their
science and engineering research with few fund
ing restrictions and limited paperwork require
ments."
On notification of the endowment, Lee said he
was "ecstatic." While he has been the recipient of
past honors, "an award of this magnitude was
quite unexpected," he said.
The endowment will go towards financing
Lee's research in the field of wireless communica
tions. Wireless communication technology such
as the cellular phone currently necessitates the use

of exotic — and expensive — materials such as
gallium arsenide and iridium phosphide.
Lee, through his research, said he hopes to re
place these expensive materials with the inexpen
sive complementary metal oxide semiconductor
technology used in most personal computers.
While CMOS is usually too slow to be used in
wireless communications, Lee said, his research
can enhance the performance of CMOS to the ex
tent that it could become a feasible alternative to
more expensive materials.
Lee estimates that CMOS can immediately re
duce the cost of wireless communication tech
nologies by three to five times. He claimed that,
through the use of CMOS, the prices of such tech
nologies as Global Positioning System units could
be reduced to those of calculators. GPS units
would then become so übiquitous that they could
be used in "cellular phones, microprocessors, vir
tually anything," Lee said.
Lee, an alumnus of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, financed his undergraduate edu
cation by working as a TV repairman in junior
high school and then, in college, by developing

such esoteric devices as the now-widespread ear
thermometer. Lee's interest in wireless communi
cations and CMOS originated in his research at
MIT on radio circuitry, a field his peers consid
ered "pass£," he said.
Lee holds six patents, has four patents pending
and has previously received awards for his origi
nal research and papers. A California native, he
moved to the state in 1991 to work as an engineer
at the startup RAMBUS Corporation, which now
specializes in the memory chips used in various
computer workstations and consumer electronics
devices. From there, he went on to his current po
sition as an associate professor of electrical engi
neering at the University.
The David and Lucile Packard Foundation
was established in 1964 by Stanford alumnus
David Packard to give back to the community
"through the improvement of scientific knowl
edge, education, health, culture, employment, the
environment and quality of life." The multibil
lion-dollar foundation awards a total of $2.5 mil
lion each year to 1 (X) Fellows from 50 prominent
universities across the nation.
