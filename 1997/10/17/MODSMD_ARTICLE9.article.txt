# Casper: regulations raising college costs
## 
### Sherilyn Ingram 
Excessive government regulation is a primary
culpri< ; n the cost of higher education, University
President Gerhard Casper yesterday told an 11-
member commission examining postsecondary
education costs.
In a speech given at Stanford to the National
( ommission on the Cost of Higher Education,
Casper said, "7.5 cents of every Stanford tuition
dol' ir toward supporting these r egulatory
costs." 1 le further speculated that time spent by
faculty and staff members ensuring compliance
could ac* o, :nt for an additional 5 cents of that dol
lar.
This sentiment was reiterated by representa
tives of other universities, including San Jose State
University President Robert L. Caret, who said in
creased regulation, compensation benefits and
technology arc driving up costs at his school.
Gare Cotton, president of the Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities of Massa
chusetts, lifting a large black binder, said it is

"sobering" that colleges may never be in compli
ance because of the amount of regulation.
The cost of compliance with government regu
lation extends beyond scientific laboratories and
research centers though, Casper claimed. He cited
the example that building costs are "15 percent
higher than they were before" the Americans with
Disabilities Act went into effect. Casper character
ized these costs as "another form of taxation ...
however worthy the purpose" of the underlying
regulation.
Casper insisted that undergraduate tuition does
not help pay for the research side of Stanford, say
ing, "Tuition covers only 66 percent of cost fairly
attributed to a student." The other 34 percent
comes from university resources such as unrestrict
ed gifts, investment earnings and endowments.
He noted, however, that if operational compli
ance with government regulations did not cost the
University $20 million annually, "We might help
on tuition much more" than the current 34 per
cent.
One solution Casper proposed to curtail the spi

raling costs is for schools to focus rather than trying
to be all things to all people. He said people who
choose a college "should know what they get them
selves into" and realize that at a place such as Stan
ford research and teaching go hand in hand.
When asked by the commission what else he
would like them to mention in their report, he said,
"On the whole, the American higher education
system is the best in the world because it is costly."
He also said people complain about the high cost of
schools such as Stanford but still want their chil
dren to attend those institutions.
"American public higher education is still a
steal," he said.
The National Commission on the Cost of High
er Education was created in June by the Congres
sional Subcommittee on Postsecondary Educa
tion, Training and Life-Long Learning. The com
mission's final report, including recommendations
for administrative and legislative action to make
college education more affordable, will be consid
ered next year when Congress reauthorizes the
Higher Education Act.
