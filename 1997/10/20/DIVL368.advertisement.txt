We're looking for people who
look at this glass and say:
"There's gotta be other
glasses of water."

We need people capable of
going beyond half-full or half
empty thinking. People who see
subleties. Who are quite frankly
bored by easy answers and
off-the-shelf solutions.
People who are constantly
challenging their own thinking
and are thirsty for new ideas and
knowledge.
You'll have a degree from a
top school. Getting a job won't
really be an issue. The question
is: which job? Which industry?
You don't want to get locked
into one area and then discover
three to five years from now that
you don't like it. By then you've
invested too much.
Andersen Consulting offers
you the chance to work in a
variety of projects-with clients in
a wide range of industries.
We are the leader in helping
organizations apply information
technology to their business
advantage. Every hour of every
business day, we implement a
solution to help one of our more
than 5,000 clients worldwide.
What makes that possible is
the quality of our people. And the
quality of our training. We're
known for both.
Because business and
technology are ever-changing, we
see training as a continuing
process. And our $123-million
Center for Professional
Education in St. Charles, Illinois,
is just one measure of our
commitment. We train you for a
career-not just a job.
Are you the person we're
talking about? The kind of
person with an unquenchable
desire for challenge and
professional growth?
If so, come talk to us. And find
out more about a career with
Andersen Consulting.
