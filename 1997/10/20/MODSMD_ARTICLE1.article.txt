### Kumar Narayanan Contributing writer 
Shyam Benegal, a highly ac
claimed film director from India, ap
peared at an exclusive Hay Area
screening of his new film "The Mak
ing of the Mahatma," Saturday night
at Memorial Auditorium.
The film focused on Mahatma
Gandhi's 21 years in South Africa, "a
crucial period in anybody's life" ac
cording to Benegal.
Benegal, 62. is particularly noted
for his documentaries and is "one of
the top five directors in India." said
Sanjeev Khagera, a professor at UC-
Santa Cruz and one of the organizers
of the event.
The 150-minute movie, which was
based on a book by South African so
ciologist Fatima Meer, was a brisk
survey of the events of (iandhi's time
in South Africa, and was shot on lo
cation there. The film conveyed the
sheer power of Gandhi's life while
striving to portray him as an ordinary
man. The conflicts between Gandhi
and his son and between Gandhi and
his wife were plainly evident."(iand
hi was an impossible husband," said
Benegal.
The film also portrayed changes in
Gandhi's ideals. When he came to
South Africa, "it w;is with the idea
that the British were good rulers."
Benegal said. That idea was reversed
by the time (iandhi returned to India.
More than 1.200 people came

from all over the Bay Area to learn
more about Gandhi and the social ac
tivism encouraged by the event's
sponsors. Many Indian groups dis
tributed information at the event.
The film was made simply, with a
budget of less than $1.5 million. De
spite being seen by some 65 million
television viewers in India, the film is
having little success at cinemas there.
Elsewhere, the film is doing quite
well. Benegal said.
The event was sponsored by San
skriti and co-sponsored by the Indian
Relief and Education Fund — an in
ternational organization— and Indi
ans for Collective Action — a Bay
Area group.
Alter the film, Benegal gave a
short statement and took questions
from the audience, many of which
were lengthy and combative.
Some individual reactions were
warm, however. "I thought it was
very good." said Puraneem Ragha
van of Fremont.
Melanie Macario of East Palo
Alto said that the film showed "the
shaping events in [Gandhi's life] ...
how he was continuously creative."
For Benegal, the "idea is to never
give up, no matter what happens.
Gandhi had a fundamental belief, a
point at which all human beings have
a heart."
Benegal's stop in the Bay Area
was part of a nationwide tour which is
raising money for Indian education
and the country's film industry.
