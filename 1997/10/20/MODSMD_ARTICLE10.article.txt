At w h;it event is a blessing given by two nuns in

heavy make-up?
I he graduate student reception of the Lesbian,
(ia\ and Bisexual ( (immunity ('enter, held last Fri
ll,i\ . included a benediction from the Sisters of Per
petual Indulgence. "We absolve you of all your un
deigraduate sins. Say 10 Judy (iarlands and go
lortli and sin some more"
I'he featured speaker ol the evening was Dr.
Kate () I lanlan, a gynecologist who used to be a
member of tile medical school faculty and contin
ues practice locally.
() I lanlan was the force behind a movement on
campus in I WO that eventually led to provision for
same-sex domestie partner housing on campus.
I ncouraging activism was a central part of
() I lanlan s talk. "Write letters, go to the deans,
raise your voices, talk to faculty who are sympa

thetic. but never stop being an activist because it's
only through activism that we'll have the world that
we need and deserve," she said.
She used the same-sex domestic partner hous
ing issue as an example of how important students
are in the Stanford community. The bill was passed
unanimously by the ASSU, which led to its inclu
sion on the agenda of the Faculty Senate where it
was approved.
O'l lanlan pointed to other issues that have not
yet been addressed, such as ROTC on campus "re
cruiting everybody except for us." The University is
taking money from military institutions and is help
ing to recruit in a discriminatory manner, she said.
She also encouraged the students in the audi
ence to make sure they have enough gay faculty
who are visible in their departments to serve as
mentors.
She concluded her speech by saying, "I urge you
to think about ways that you can ask for what you
don't already have, because that's the only way
things are going to change."

Senior Ryan Foley, the graduate intern at the
center, also spoke, encouraging participation with
the center's speakers bureau, volunteer activities,
and discussion and support groups.
Grace Pasigan, a law student and co-leader of
the center, spoke about what it has accomplished.
She described new features of the center such as
a World Wide Web site, disability access to its of
fices and a new kitchen. She also discussed a
demonstration organized through the center that
was held in White Plaza last April to protest multi
ple incidents of gay-bashing. More than 30() people
participated in the event.
Pasigan also pointed out issues that still face the
center, such as the lack of a director. "The person in
charge of a community center is an advocate for the
needs and interests of the center. This community
center doesn't have one."
Representatives from various student groups
such as Queer and Asian and the art magazine
"Mask" as well as the Ye Olde Safer Sex Shoppe
had tables set up at the reception.
