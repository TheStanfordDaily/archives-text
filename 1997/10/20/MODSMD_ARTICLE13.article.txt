# Militants cease attacks on Israel
## Hamas leader says "cooling off" period will last if Israel cooperates 
### 
CiAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — The
founder of the radical Islamic group Hamas said
yesterday that militants have halted attacks on
Israel for the time being.
But Sheik Ahmed Yassin told The Associated
Press that the "cooling off" period would last
only it Israel stopped its punitive measures
against Palestinian civilians — such as economic
closures, house demolitions and land seizures.
"We have stopped, and many times we've
stopped for months, but the Israelis still continue

their attacks against Palestinian civilians," Yassin
said. "Why don't they stop?"
If Yassin's declaration translates into an end
to Hamas terrorist bombings in Israel, one of the
main impediments to Israeli-Palestinian peace
making efforts would be removed.
But the message was sometimes contradictory
and Israel reacted skeptically.
David Bar-Illan, an adviser to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel welcomed the
"change of tone" in Yassin's statements but said

there were too many strings attached to make his
cease-fire proposals credible.
A senior official said on condition of
anonymity that Israeli intelligence indicated ;i
Hamas cell was planning to cany out another
bombing attack in Israel.
Hamas claimed responsibility for recent sui
cide bombings in Jerusalem — one in an open-air
market and the other in a mall. All together. 2N
people were killed, including five suicide attack
ers. Six weeks have passed since the last attack.
