## Editorial Proceed with caution Pre-registration woes 
### 
Student concerns must
be carefully weighed
against conveniences.

STANFORD STUDENTS LOVE
having the freedom to shop for class
es. and they do not want this privilege
to be curtailed.
No big news here.
The Registrar's Office, which is current
ly examining the possibility of pre-registra
tion for classes, is likely to discover that
much Nov. 7. when it conducts a focus
group study 011 that issue with students, fac
ulty and staff.
A far more interesting question, though,
is how the pre-registration effort should
proceed after realizing how students gen
uinely feel about their freedom to post
study lists almost two weeks after the begin
ning of the quarter.
In order to arrive at a system that the
whole campus can support, the administra
tion must carefully weigh student concerns
against the advantages of pre-registration.
Granted, these advantages are numer
ous. and they explain why faculty and staff
would support pre-registration. Knowing
ballpark enrollment numbers before
instruction starts, professors can request
rooms of appropriate si/e, order enough
materials and find the right number of
teaching assistants.
No doubt, these considerations would
translate into tangible benefits for students:
no more sitting 011 the floor until a class
room change can be arranged or waiting for
two weeks until the Bookstore gets an extra
shipment of textbooks. Overcrowded sec
tions are not wildly popular among students
either.
(iiven these practical considerations, the
Registrar's Office may come to think — as
it sometimes appears to have done already
that a campus-wide consensus exists in
favor of pre-registration. This is far from
the truth.
Stanford makes a great deal of academic
exploration, so its 110 wonder that students
appreciate a chance to preview classes.
Besides, many view a shopping period as an
entitlement of sorts — the old "this is the
least they can do. considering how much we
have to pay" argument comes into play.
University Registrar Roger Printup is
quick to point out that pre-registration will
still give students the freedom to change
their schedules. Add and drop deadlines in
the beginning of the quarter are going to
stay, essentially preserving the shopping
period.
Not quite, say many students. It is diffi

cult to see how the University can enjoy the
advantages of pre-registration without
somehow forcing students to make some
measure of commitment to a particular
schedule.
Theoretically, this need not be an
unbearable burden on students, but it will
probably take away much of the shopping
period's convenience. Students prefer to
hear the professor's lecture and to browse
through the syllabus before putting a course
on their study list.
Now consider that students don't have
much in the way of a course guide that
would tell them how particular classes and
professors fared in previous years. The fight
for a course guide has already drawn much
attention, so there is 110 need to dwell upon
it, except to note that pre-registration
would only exacerbate the demand for
more information among students.
Students are also concerned — not with
out reason that pre-registration could
offer a convenient means of limiting enroll
ment in more classes. While it would
replace the inconveniently decentralized
sign-ups currently administered by depart
ments, instructors may come to treat pre
registration as a useful tool for cutting down
class size.
11 failure to pre-register could mean inel
igibility for some courses, logistics are sure
to get hairy. How many units will students
be able to pre-register for? Will some stu
dents get priority on the popular classes?
Will pre-registration involve the same com
plex strategic calculation now associated
with the housing Draw?
More likely than not, these questions
(and many others that could be asked about
the specifics of pre-registration) are prema
ture. Nevertheless, they represent legiti
mate concerns of the student body, and the
administration should not ignore them.
Pre-registration could help the Universi
ty to run more smoothly bv giving adminis
trators much needed early information. It
could also encounter bitter opposition from
students by making them commit to classes
too early or too firmly. The designers of the
new system must focus on benefiting from
pre-registration's advantages without
falling prey to its pitfalls.
They can achieve the delicate balance
only if thev remember that students benefit
from the shopping period in use today and
that they are invested in preserving the
freedoms it offers. If pre-registration will
substantially undermine the shopping peri
od. students will resist it.
Is this big news? Hardly. Yet, with facul
ty and staff lining up behind pre-registra
tion. the administration should constantly
be reminded that students, too, must come
011 board before the campus can reach a
consensus.
