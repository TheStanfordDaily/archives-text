## Destiny and dying with dignity 
### 
I ONCE HEARD my
uncle Tom declare
that if the grim reaper
came to him in the form of
a terminal illness, he'd get
his affairs in order, say
good-bye to his loved ones
and take himself on a long

walk in the woods with a shot gun. 1 inter
nally nodded in agreement, thinking that I
would do the same.
"Death with Dignity" is what Oregon
has titled legislation allowing mentally com
petent, terminally ill patients to request
lethal doses of medication from their physi
cians. But the measure has recently come
under the gun, and next month voters will
be deciding whether to repeal or retain this
controversial law.
In spite of the fact that the strongest
source of objection is based on religious
beliefs, the public debate seems to be
revolving around the much less loaded issue
of whether or not oral doses of barbiturates
(the law specifically forbids lethal injec
tions) is a nice and easy way to go.
As you can imagine, scientific studies of
this procedure are slim, and as one can
expect from a political debate, both sides are
skewing the statistics for their advantage.
In the midst of this debate, we have to be
certain not to confuse physician-assisted
death with withholding life sustaining treat
ment.
The latter is quite commonly acceptable
and legal — anyone can and should fill out
a little form from your doctor called "The
Durable Power of Attorney for Health
Care Decisions," in which you designate a
person to make medical decisions lor you
when you are unable to decide for yourself.
And you can outline which life-sustaining
procedures and treatments (such as dialysis
or mechanical ventilation) you would or
would not like performed.
My father, a physician, says that it is

almost universal for people to want the plug
pulled if they should ever enter a vegetative
state. Not surprisingly, people would prefer
that no heroic efforts be made to keep them
alive if they can no longer recognize them
selves.
The Oregon measure is a different issue
altogether. It's about preventing suftering
before death is actually knocking on the
door.
In terms of policy, I don't like the idea ol
the government deciding what I can or can t
do with my body, whether the issue be
death, an unborn fetus or chemical sub
stances. I want self-sovereignty.
At any time I have the power to stop eat
ing, to drown myself in the big blue or take
myself into the woods with a shotgun, so I
don't think its fair that my physician should
be held legally responsible for assisting me
to terminate my suffering.
Politics aside, the more interesting
dilemma is what would you do?
My resolve to end it with a bullet in the
trees was challenged by the response ot my
uncle, Phil. He replied to Tom's projection
with a moving and passionate entreaty
about the eternal power of hope and imper
ative will to live.
Never, he adamantly proclaimed, should
you take death in your own hands.
These words were coming from the
mouth of a man whose boat caught fire and
sunk in the middle of the Caribbean 10
years ago.
There he was stranded without provi
sions for three and a half weeks on a life raft
with his best friend, Alvin. They were res
cued by chance, because a 17-year-old boy
on a cruise ship thought he saw something
floating in the water. Nevertheless, Alvin
didn't live to see the next dawn, and my
uncle barely survived.
The hardships the two of them suffered,
and the things that went through in their
minds tin that life raft are way beyond my

comprehension. Having lost his companion,
who had been the best man at his wedding
just weeks before, my uncle rarely talks of
his experience. I will never know the details
of their story.
But I saw the aftermath as my uncle
rehabilitated at our home, and from my six
year-old eyes I knew this: I have never wit
nessed a body so ravished by nature, nor a
man so graceful in his recovery.
My uncle is now teeming with as much
life force as ever; he is a champion cyclist
and successful entrepreneur. He lives his
life to the fullest, and 1 think he understands
something about death that eludes the rest
of us.
This summer I was introduced to the
Tibetan Buddhist philosophy of death:
instead of a medical failure, they see it as a
moment of spiritual glory: they practice and
prepare for it in order that life may be lived
without fear.
In contrast, the typical American seems
to try to avoid contemplating the way we
enter and exit the world: we want birth to be
anesthetized and death to be administered.
What makes America great is our free
dom to think and do whatever the hell we
want, and so I think we should be given the
legal right to embrace, deny, prolong or has
ten death as we see fit.
But as for me, 1 no longer envision dying
with a gun among the pines. 1 have resolved
that the dying process holds great lessons
that in my time I'd like to learn. So I'll cham
pion Oregonians for their right to control
their destiny, but if I were given six months
to go, I'd wait for destiny to come to me.

Kerry Rodders, a senior majoring in philos
ophy and form of isital art, would like to
dedicate her column to Al in. Although she
ne er knew him, his spirit and his story has
always touched her. She hopes it may do the
same for you.
