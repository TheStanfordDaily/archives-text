Saving sex until mar
riage eases anxieties

The debate that has been taking place
the past few days over Bartsch's Oct. 13
article in The Daily completely excluded
the most important issues regarding sex and
the message of condoms. First of all, there
was no discussion at all about the ill effects
of the sexual revolution and the toll it has
taken on American society. The sexual rev
olution has led to historically high divorce
and STD rates. The breakdown of the fam
ily has huge societal impact.
Secondly, the use of the expression "safe"
in regard to condoms is misleading at best.
Most studies show condoms have at least a 3
percent failure rate, even when used perfect
ly. While this risk may not seem large, many
young people are putting their lives in the
balance. Who would call a parachute with a
3 percent failure rate "safe?" Today, the
number one killer of Americans between the
ages of 25 and 44 is AIDS.

Finally, the emotional consequences of
sex were mostly ignored. There is no con
dom for the heart. We feel that sex is an
expression of unconditional love that
should take place only within marriage.
Dating can then focus on getting to know
one another as people and as friends.
If Vanessa Bartsch and her friend
believed in saving sex until marriage, then
she would not have had to deal with the
anxieties she raised, because there would
have been no ambiguity as to what he was
hoping to gain from seeing her.

Delvin wrong to attack
Bartsch's morality
How unfortunate it is that Mr. Delvin
was unable to look past the surface topic of
Bartsch's article to see the humor and self

reflective angst described within. While
Bartsch does tell us of her surprise at the
location of her friend's condoms, at no
point does she actually express dismay or
disappointment that he owns them.
What I certainly find most disappointing
about Delvin's note to Bartsch is his per
sonal — and unfounded — attack on her
morality, sexual choices and religion. Who
is he to criticize her supposed uninformed
condemnation of this "disco
swinger /church group member" and then
make an equally uninformed critique of
her? Rampant hypocrisy or (to emulate his
editorial style) the rantings of an under
sexed. hyper-vigilant wheat-bread fan'.'
Whichever.
Regardless, thanks for reminding me
that not everyone thinks that we should be
allowed to vocalize our fears and paranoia
— I will make sure not to share my feelings
with him in the future.
