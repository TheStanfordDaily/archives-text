## Why Stanford needs to get medieval

behind one ol those massive columns
that make up the inner (Juad: li is as it a
horde ot warriors had been turned into
stone — each a Xerox eop\ ol the one in
line before it and been conscripted to
hold up those bulks arches that make up the
Quad.
In tact, every time I make my tour of the
Quad, I teel as il I've been magicalh trans
ported to the Middle Ages, our ver\ own
(Juad seeming all too reminiscent of the
monastic quadrangle at Mont St. Michel in
Northern France. I he message is clear: I he
heart and soul ol our precious Stanford I 111
versity— our Inner Quad is rooted in the
Middle Ages. Lven look at the medieval
Heur delis that make up the flag for our uni
versity's largest school the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
Our medieval connections are clear. We
gotta' recogni/e; Stanford students need to

get medieval.
What better way to endorse a narrow
system of belief than through a theme
house? Stanford needs a medieval theme
house.
Hell, we have a theme house for just
about everything else, what would one more
do? We have a Black theme house and a ( hi
eano/I.atino theme house. We have theme
houses that devote themselves to a majors
and other cultures. I here's American Stud
ies. the French House and Slav Dom. We
even have theme houses for not-so-academic
things, such as pop culture and vegetarianism
(which, coincidental!), has been inauspi
cious!) reduplicated time and time again a la
C 'olumbae. Svnergv and I Ml).
So why isn't there a medieval theme
house?
Consider how the academic mission of
the IJni\ eisit\ would be fulfilled via this sort
of theme house. We could first and fore
most attract medieval studies majors to the

University. Ford knows I'm tired of being
1(H) percent ol the department. Someone's
gotta' plug the Dark Ages at Stanford.
II it weren't for Ouentin Tarantino and
his "Pulp Fiction." most people may have
gone their entire Stanford career without
even hearing the word "medieval." And
even then, people associate this rich
moment in Western Civilization with the
"gimps." sado-masochism and sodomy (this
is not sa\ people did not dress up ill leather
and perform sodomy in the Dark Ages, or
at Stanford lot that matter) simply, there
is another dimension to the Middle Ages
that I'm certain most of our CIV tracks just
glossed over: "a few Confessions, a little
Aquinas. Now. onward to those ever more
important 20th Century Native American
lesbian writers.''
A medieval theme house would do more
than just fill in those gaps that a year of CIV
seemed to neglect, it would help mitigate
this year's housing crunch also, while offer

ing students a year of medieval enlighten
ment. Residents at Avignon (the name that
I have already chosen I'ur this theme house)
would live in the spirit and the decadence ot
a medieval pope.
I here would be no need lor residents to
leave and attend boring, overpopulated I rat
parties. All the action would be right here in
Avignon. Weekday jousts (in ordei to settle
roommate conflicts) would be the daily
afternoon special. Alter the dispute has
been settled, and the body has been dragged
oil the field (which means more housing foi
walk-ons), the orgy begins: gallons upon
gallons of wine and pounds and pounds ol
animal flesh.
Avignon would even have a house re 1 i
gion picking up the slack where our
clearly atheist University lias been remiss
about such senseless things as spirituality.
Sunday mass will be said in Latin, followed
by a reflection time each evening.
Stanford's medieval theme house would

be a paradise. Hut iudiv importantly, like
many theme houses, u would be a sate
haven lor speeinl students. Avignon would
be the perfect place for those ol you who
don't feel entirely at home in this I JniversitN
(like me); it would be home for students who
like to drink (like me), people who like to
eat (me), people who can appreciate
medieval music (me), art (me), history (me),
religion (me) and for students like me.
It's clear: we have a certifiable need to
get medieval on this campus. Call youi
ASSl 1 Neophyte! ( all (icrhard! I lell. even
get Condi on the horn, fell 'cm: "I'm like
(iarry! I wanna'get medieval! I wanna' live
in Avignon. I want wine and meat and
music and housing!"
With am luck. Helen liing is ordering
