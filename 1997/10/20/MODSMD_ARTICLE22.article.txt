Hie win over the (lolden Hears
(S-4 1,2-2) sets up the ('ardinal for a
meeting with the MI'SI Pacific Divi
sion champion in mid-November.
UCLA, ranked No. 2 in the nation,
was expected to be that opponent,
but the Hruins lost this weekend to
('al Stated ullerton.
Regardless ol which team Stan
ford meets in the federation cliampi
onship, the Cardinal now has a
chance to finish the season as the top
team in the 1 ar West region.
I hat would be a lilting end for a
team that lias the longest unbeaten
streak in Stanford history and the
nation at IS games. I lie Cardinal's

nation's lowest goals against avei
age.

for the first time in eight games and
only the third time all season.

every game this season Playing that
much, he said, it is inevitable that a
ball will slip through once in a while.
"It was a fairly dumb goal to let
through. - ' /apala said, "but it hap
pens. It's probabh good that it hap
pened today."

needs water. Hut a halltimc pep talk
