Then No. 23 Arizona State came to town. In ;i
must-win game for both teams Saturday, the Sun
Devils dominated Stanford 31 14. handing the
('ardinal (4-3. 2-2 I'ac-10) its second consecutive
loss m front < il 43.000 at Stanford Stadium.

to victory over a Stanford team that suddenly
looks very mediocre.
Stanford was embarrassed at home hv the Sun
Devils for the second straight year last season
Arizona State trounced the ( ardinal 41-0.
Hut the latest loss is much more disappointing.
It essentially knocks Stanford out ol the Rose
Howl race and ends the ( ardinal's dreams ol its
first conference championship since 1071.
"It's probably a little difficult (to go to the
Rose Bowl) with two losses." said head coach I v
rone Willinghani. "Il doesn't happen very often."
Stanford now has much more to worry about

which lias a bye this week, must regroup after its
second straight anemic performance.
For the second consecutive week, turnovers
killed the ( ardinal. I .ast week. Stanford lost live
fumbles; against the Sun Devils, the ( ardinal lost
three fumbles and tossed two interceptions.
