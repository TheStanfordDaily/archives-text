Stanford 14

Then No. 23 Arizona State came to town. In ;i
must-win game for both teams Saturday, the Sun
Devils dominated Stanford 31 14. handing the
('ardinal (4-3. 2-2 I'ac-10) its second consecutive
loss m front < il 43.000 at Stanford Stadium.
I he Sun Devils (5-2,3-1) controlled the game
from the outset, building a 31-7 lead and coasting
to victory over a Stanford team that suddenly
looks very mediocre.
Stanford was embarrassed at home hv the Sun
Devils for the second straight year last season
Arizona State trounced the ( ardinal 41-0.
Hut the latest loss is much more disappointing.
It essentially knocks Stanford out ol the Rose
Howl race and ends the ( ardinal's dreams ol its
first conference championship since 1071.
"It's probably a little difficult (to go to the
Rose Bowl) with two losses." said head coach I v
rone Willinghani. "Il doesn't happen very often."
Stanford now has much more to worry about
than its fading Rose Howl hopes. I he ( ardinal.
which lias a bye this week, must regroup after its
second straight anemic performance.
For the second consecutive week, turnovers
killed the ( ardinal. I .ast week. Stanford lost live
fumbles; against the Sun Devils, the ( ardinal lost
three fumbles and tossed two interceptions.
"Turn the ball over and you put yoursell in a
hole, and it's hard to find your way out ol it." said
sophomore quarterback ( had 1 lutchinsoii
Arizona State served notice on its first pos
session that it came readv to win. I he Sun I )evils
took the opening kickoff and
marched 82 yards down the field,
scoring on a 7-yard waltz into the end
zone by senior running back Michael
Martin for an immediate 7-0 load.
For a team with everything to
lose, Stanford was remarkably flat at
the outset. Arizona State's drive con
sisted mostly of redshirt freshman
quarterback Ryan Kealy finding
wide-open receivers for big gains.
"We started off in a tentative
fashion." Willingham said. "When
you don't control the line of scrim
mage from the start, it makes it diffi
cult to get everything else going."
Stanford's offense was even
more ineffective than the defense.
Its lirst four possessions netted a
total of 1 yard. The offensive line was
pushed around by an Arizona State
front that was considered the de
fense's weak link. The first four
times the Cardinal had the ball, the
Sun Devils recorded three sacks.
Stanford's defense was obviously
frustrated by the offense's inability
to give it any help, but it did manage
to stop the Sun Devils on their next
four possessions. Senior cornerback

Corey Hill intercepted a wild pass
from Kealy in the end zone and re
turned the ball to the Stanford 30
five minutes into the second quarter.
The Cardinal tied the game two
plays later when senior Anthony
Bookman raced past the Sun Devils'
secondary for a 70-yard touchdown
run. It was Bookman's fourth touch
down run of at least 58 yards this sea
son and the longest of his career.
Unfortunately for Stanford, that
was the only success the rushing
game had. Aside from Bookman's
touchdown, the Cardinal gained just
44 yards in 31 attempts.
Following Bookman's score,
sophomore Troy Walters gave the
Cardinal great field position with a
spectacular 44-yard punt return, giv
ing the Cardinal a chance to take
control of the game.
But as has been a trademark of
the last two weeks. Stanford made a
huge mistake in a critical situation.
Bookman took a handoff at the Sun
Devils' 20-yard line and was
smacked at the line of scrimmage.
I he ball popped loose and Arizona
State recovered, taking the momen
tum right back from the Cardinal.
"T he excellent punt return was a
real momentum builder," Willing
ham said. It "really pumped life into

the team and to turn it right hack
over sucked the life out of the team."
The turnover seemed to suck the
life out of the stadium, too. as the
crowd went silent while Arizona
State capitalized on the mistake with
a 74-yard touchdown drive.
Stanford never challenged for
control of the game again. Hutchin
son threw two interceptions — his
first in four games — on the Cardi
nal's final two possessions of the first
half, and a -Kvyard field goal gave
Arizona State a 17-7 edge.
After halftimc the game became
truly nightmarish for Stanford. I he
C 'ardinal failed to score on its first six
possessions of the half. Its final
points, a 2-vard touchdown run by
senior Mike Mitchell, came with the
game out of reach.
Meanwhile, Arizona State con
tinued to wear down the Stanford
defense. Hie Sun Devils gained 259
yards on the ground, a season high
for Cardinal opponents. Despite
missing its top back. J.R. Redmond.
Arizona State still had two rushers
gain more than 100 yards each.
Stanford now sits in fifth place in
the conference, and with the Pac-10
guaranteed only lour bowl berths,
suddenly the Cardinal is facing a
struggle just to make the postseason.

■ SATURDAY'S KI SIJI.I Arizona Slate <1
Stanford 14

Then No. 23 Arizona State came to town. In ;i
must-win game for both teams Saturday, the Sun
Devils dominated Stanford 31 14. handing the
('ardinal (4-3. 2-2 I'ac-10) its second consecutive
loss m front < il 43.000 at Stanford Stadium.
I he Sun Devils (5-2,3-1) controlled the game
from the outset, building a 31-7 lead and coasting
to victory over a Stanford team that suddenly
looks very mediocre.
Stanford was embarrassed at home hv the Sun
Devils for the second straight year last season
Arizona State trounced the ( ardinal 41-0.
Hut the latest loss is much more disappointing.
It essentially knocks Stanford out ol the Rose
Howl race and ends the ( ardinal's dreams ol its
first conference championship since 1071.
"It's probably a little difficult (to go to the
Rose Bowl) with two losses." said head coach I v
rone Willinghani. "Il doesn't happen very often."
Stanford now has much more to worry about
than its fading Rose Howl hopes. I he ( ardinal.
which lias a bye this week, must regroup after its
second straight anemic performance.
For the second consecutive week, turnovers
killed the ( ardinal. I .ast week. Stanford lost live
fumbles; against the Sun Devils, the ( ardinal lost
three fumbles and tossed two interceptions.
"Turn the ball over and you put yoursell in a
hole, and it's hard to find your way out ol it." said
sophomore quarterback ( had 1 lutchinsoii
Arizona State served notice on its first pos
session that it came readv to win. I he Sun I )evils
took the opening kickoff and
marched 82 yards down the field,
scoring on a 7-yard waltz into the end
zone by senior running back Michael
Martin for an immediate 7-0 load.
For a team with everything to
lose, Stanford was remarkably flat at
the outset. Arizona State's drive con
sisted mostly of redshirt freshman
quarterback Ryan Kealy finding
wide-open receivers for big gains.
"We started off in a tentative
fashion." Willingham said. "When
you don't control the line of scrim
mage from the start, it makes it diffi
cult to get everything else going."
Stanford's offense was even
more ineffective than the defense.
Its lirst four possessions netted a
total of 1 yard. The offensive line was
pushed around by an Arizona State
front that was considered the de
fense's weak link. The first four
times the Cardinal had the ball, the
Sun Devils recorded three sacks.
Stanford's defense was obviously
frustrated by the offense's inability
to give it any help, but it did manage
to stop the Sun Devils on their next
four possessions. Senior cornerback

Corey Hill intercepted a wild pass
from Kealy in the end zone and re
turned the ball to the Stanford 30
five minutes into the second quarter.
The Cardinal tied the game two
plays later when senior Anthony
Bookman raced past the Sun Devils'
secondary for a 70-yard touchdown
run. It was Bookman's fourth touch
down run of at least 58 yards this sea
son and the longest of his career.
Unfortunately for Stanford, that
was the only success the rushing
game had. Aside from Bookman's
touchdown, the Cardinal gained just
44 yards in 31 attempts.
Following Bookman's score,
sophomore Troy Walters gave the
Cardinal great field position with a
spectacular 44-yard punt return, giv
ing the Cardinal a chance to take
control of the game.
But as has been a trademark of
the last two weeks. Stanford made a
huge mistake in a critical situation.
Bookman took a handoff at the Sun
Devils' 20-yard line and was
smacked at the line of scrimmage.
I he ball popped loose and Arizona
State recovered, taking the momen
tum right back from the Cardinal.
"T he excellent punt return was a
real momentum builder," Willing
ham said. It "really pumped life into

the team and to turn it right hack
over sucked the life out of the team."
The turnover seemed to suck the
life out of the stadium, too. as the
crowd went silent while Arizona
State capitalized on the mistake with
a 74-yard touchdown drive.
Stanford never challenged for
control of the game again. Hutchin
son threw two interceptions — his
first in four games — on the Cardi
nal's final two possessions of the first
half, and a -Kvyard field goal gave
Arizona State a 17-7 edge.
After halftimc the game became
truly nightmarish for Stanford. I he
C 'ardinal failed to score on its first six
possessions of the half. Its final
points, a 2-vard touchdown run by
senior Mike Mitchell, came with the
game out of reach.
Meanwhile, Arizona State con
tinued to wear down the Stanford
defense. Hie Sun Devils gained 259
yards on the ground, a season high
for Cardinal opponents. Despite
missing its top back. J.R. Redmond.
Arizona State still had two rushers
gain more than 100 yards each.
Stanford now sits in fifth place in
the conference, and with the Pac-10
guaranteed only lour bowl berths,
suddenly the Cardinal is facing a
struggle just to make the postseason.
