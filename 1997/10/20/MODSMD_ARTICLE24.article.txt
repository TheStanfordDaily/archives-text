# Defense MIA against ASU

Stanford's secondary has made a habit ol
relying on the rest ol the Cardinal defense.
Against Arizona State on Saturday, it found
nowhere to hide.

season. 14 Ihe ( ardinal's first loss at

ondary U> graduation, Stanford
knew coming into the season that
the defensive backfield could he an
area of concern.
It didn't help when ('orey I lill was
sidelined indefinitely in the second
quarter with a hamstring injury, leav
ing inexperienced sophomores ( hris
Johnson and Frank Primus at the
corners with Mark Sanders getting
his first action as the lone backup.
What Stanford has not experi
enced much o! this season is the
breakdown of its front seven. With
five returning starters, including
standouts Kailee Wong. ( hi is I )ralt
and Carl Hansen, the defensive line
and linebackers were seen as a
strength of the squad.
Throughout the first five games,
the group proved worthy of its
billing, slowing down opposing run
ning backs while putting plenty of
pressure on the quarterback.
Hut something went wrong
against the Sun Devils. Arizona
State's offensive line repeatedly
pushed back Stanford's defensive
front, creating gaping holes for
backs Michael Martin and Marlon

larlow. I he two accounted lor 2>3
of Arizona State's 25 c > rushing \ ards,
the most given up by the Cardinal
this season.
"F.verything starts with the front
|line| on both sides." s;iid Arizona
State head coach Bruce Snyder.
"We are not consistent, but we are
explosive."
Against Stanford, the Sun Devils
won the battle of the line of scrim
mage on both sides of the ball, their
tailbacks running almost ;it will.
" 1 hey ran the same play over and
over." Wong said. "We knew the\
were going to run it. You have to
stop it.and we didn't."
I he most telling statistic? An
zona State scored all four of its
touchdowns on the ground, nearh
equaling the number ol rushing
scores the Cardinal defense had
given up all season.
I'hree of those touchdowns were
punched in from within Stanford's
10-yard line, while the fourth was a
hO-yard run by l arlow that sealed
the victory.
"It is a lough blow." Wong said.
I he Rose Bowl "was somethingthat
we were shooting lor, and it is far out
of reach. But I know that I am going
to keep trying to work hard and \\ in
games."
