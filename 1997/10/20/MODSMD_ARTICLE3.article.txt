## Both parties in suit against police intend to continue investigations 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
A long-running lawsuit brought
by an alumna charging the Stanford
Police with excessive force was set
tled Thursday without a ever going
before a jury, but both parties intend
to continue the matter through an in
ternal police investigation.
Ava Besbris, ("lass of 'HO, sued t he
University, Stanford Police Officer
Allen James and numerous others
over an incident that took place at
the IW3 Big Game.
Terms of the settlement are confi
dential by court order but. according
to the defense attorney Keith
Bower, there will be a second police
internal affairs investigation of the
matter at James' own request. Bes
bris said she also would seek an in
vestigation.
The two sides differ sharply on
several key points of fact regarding
the events.

I ho incident occurred during
crowd disturbances that followed
the IIWl l W Miiz (lame.
A deposition from Hesbris states
that shortly after the end of the game
she was ordered to leave the stadium
by a police officer. As she was doing
so. she was knocked down by James.
Hesbris said that although she
was "too weak and too scared" to re
sist, .lames put a hold on her arm that
caused major damage, leading toon
going major surgery and preventing
her front sporting activities and, lot
two years after the incident, from
working.
At no point during the encounter
did James say she was under arrest,
Hesbris said.
According to James' account,
filed m an incident report, Hesbris
was apparently intoxicated, shouting
loudly and refused requests to leave
the area.
When she refused to leave, James
said lie threatened to arrest her and
then actually did so. He said he was
obliged to place a hold on her to re
move her from the area because she
was resisting and continued to resist
his efforts to move her.
James subsequently released Bes
bris to one of her friends on the scene
rather than booking her.
According to Bower, Stanford's
defense was to be that James applied
the standard "compliance hold" po
licemen are trained to use. that such
holds can cause injury to the person
held if he or she resists and that the
evidence, including expert witnesses,
would not bear out Besbris' claim
that she was seriously injured.
Bower also said Besbris had a pat
tern of litigious behavior and threat
ening to file lawsuits, often making
conflicting assertions in different
cases.
I his will be the second internal af
fairs investigation concerning this
case. The first stemmed from a com

plaint filed by Besbris the day after
the 1993 Big Game.
The first investigation, according
to Bower, was terminated because
Besbris refused to give an interview
to investigators. According to Bes
bris, she had made repeated inquiries
at the time about when she might be
interviewed.
She said a secretary eventually
did call about an interview and Bes
bris told her she would be entirely
willing to give an interview at any
time either in person or by phone.
However, she said, the secretary
hung up when Besbris asked
whether she might either tape the in
terview or have an attorney present.
Besbris said she found the asser
tion that she was uncooperative with
the investigation to be "quite offen
sive and quite insulting."
Neither Bower nor police officials
had a comment on the specifics of
Besbris' assertions regarding her
willingness to be interviewed.
Bower, noting that it is unusual
for an officer to request an internal
affairs investigation of his own ac
tions, said he was "very confident
that Uamesl will be vindicated."

Based, he said, on personal ac
quaintance with James, Bower
called him a "kind and gentle man"
and said that "what Ava Besbris
said [James did] is completely out
side the realm of possibility in my
opinion, having known him for two
years."
He also noted that James' actions
in not booking Besbris at the game
were consistent with the Stanford
Police's attitude toward students and
alumni, which he said was as much as
possible to avoid arresting them or
giving them criminal records.
Besbris, for her part, said she had
grown up in an atmosphere where
many policemen were family friends
and that one of the most psychologi
cally damaging aspects of the incident
was that she had "lost my trust in the
police and become afraid of them."
She said her continuing the com
plaint was "a challenge to the police
department to re-examine its meth
ods" and was "not a personal vendet
ta" against the police or the Univer
sity.
"1 still love Stanford and cherish
my memories from there," Besbris
said.
