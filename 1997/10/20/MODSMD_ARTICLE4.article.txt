## 
### Alice Lah 
Starting today, students, faculty and staff can
pick up this year's Bookstore rebate checks. I he
Bookstore is paying back about I I cents on every
dollar in 19%-97 receipts that was submitted by
the June 20 deadline.
This year's percentage is an increase ol I per
centage point from last year. I lie increase can be
attributed to "efforts to reduce general costs and
employee costs and to a substantial reduction in
long-term debt." said the Bookstore's marketing
manager. Anoop Krishnan. in a statement

More than 7.500 rebate checks totalling
$424,000 will be handed back to those who sub
milted their Bookstore receipts for the year.
"This year's rebate checks reflect a higher sur
plus than in previous years." Krishnan noted. I le
views this as a commendable achievement con
sidering the increased costs of doing business in
the fairly expensive labor markets of Silicon Val
ley.
Each year the Bookstore, a nonprofit organi
zation. divides a portion of its surplus the
amount remaining when expenses are subtracted
Irom revenues among the students, faculty, and

stiltf who turned in their textbook and course
reader receipts for the year.
The portion of the surplus given back is deter
mined by the Bookstore's board of directors I lie
total is then divided by the number of submitted
claims, based on the amount the student spent on
course materials.
Rebates can be picked up at the Mooksiore
today until Wednesday. Bookstore staff will be in
the front of the store from c > a.m. to 5 p.m. to dis
tribute these checks. I lie Bookstore will mail
checks to those who are unable to pick them up in
person.
