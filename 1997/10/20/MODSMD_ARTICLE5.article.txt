# Med School to find funds for its scholars program

A $20 million, five-year endowment cam
paign has been launched by the School of Med
icine's Dean's ()ffice to find money for a popu
lar scholarship program that lost funding due to
changing federal regulations.
The Medical Student Scholars Program,
which provides research opportunities and
scholarship money to medical students, lost
nearly half its funding after a change in federal
regulations that took effect on Oct. 1.
The Medical Scholars Program is "truly
unique among programs." said Bruce Bingham,
associate director of medical development at the
Medical School. "It allows students to custom
design a research program under the direction
of a faculty adviser" as early as their first year of
medical school.
In addition to these research opportunities,
participating students also receive a $5,222 tu
ition credit and ;i quarterly stipend.

New federal regulations are now restricting
money from the University benefits pool that
was formerly used for student tuition stipends.
The Dean's Office is currently replacing the lost
funding, so the about SO students currently in
volved in the program are not in danger of losing
tuition credits or stipends.
However, Bingham noted, indications are
that federal funding will continue to decrease, so
the school would like for the endowment to
eventually enable the program to be self-sus
taining.
Support for the endowment is expected to
come largely from alumni and medical research
foundations. About H5O students have benefited
from the Medical Scholars program since it
began in 1980. Bingham said "our alumni are
our family," and that the school's graduates
have been great supporters of the endowment
effort.
