# Climbing wall faces delays
## 
### Matthew H. Blumenstein 
Space remains the only unsurmounted ob
stacle in the effort to bring a rock climbing wall
to Stanford.
Last year, the Athletics Department
pledged space lor a wall on the condition that
the student group sponsoring the construction
resolved issues of liability and funding.
Several proposed spaces for the wall have
been either abandoned or claimed by other,
more established sections of the athletic de
partment. junior I revor Uc/dek s;iid. Bezdek
is president of the student group dedicated to
the construction of the climbing wall.
One space the group looked at was the rac
quctball courts adjoining deCiuerre pool,
which have fallen into disrepair. Bezdek said it
would be perfect for the wall, but the swim
ming program wants to use it for new locker
rooms.

As soon as they find a space for the wall,
construction can begin. Bezdek said that be
cause similar proposals had been scoffed at in
the past, the department's cooperation was ;i
testimony to the growing popularity and ac
ceptance of rock climbing.
The climbing wall overcame its first hurdle,
funding, by gaining special fee approval last
spring. While the group had wanted $60,000.
students only approved $30,000 for the effort.
Be/dek said this is enough to build a climb
ing wall; however, he did note longingly that
such schools as UCLA and IJC-Santa Barbara
built climbing walls for prices exceeding
$120,000.
According to the group's proposition from
February, rock climbing is "arguably the per
fect combination of physical exercise and men
tal training." Climbing walls "provide both the
(raining labilities necessary to suc
ceed on today "s most difficult climbs
and a place lor fun and exercise for
all people."
I he proposal also said rock climb
ing is being considered as an ()lympic
event in the' next summer Olympics
and training facilities such as the pro
posed Stanford wall provide critical

training sites as the sport grows.
According to Be/dek, there is
considerable student interest, as
seen in the great response to a climb
ing wall in White Plaza last year and
a survey conducted at last year's ac
tivities fair that garnered S(H) signa
tures.
The closest rock climbing wall is
half an hour away, in Santa Clara,
and it charges a fee. Yosemite Na
tional Park offers some of the best
natural rock climbing in the world.

but il is four hours away and contains
some climbs with high difficulty.
There are 25 students split into
three committees dedicated to the
construction of the wall. Seventy
five others offer occasional assis
tance and subscribe to the climbing
wall e-mail list. Two faculty mem
bers sponsor the project: Dennis
Bird, an associate professor of geo
logical and environmental sciences
and Robert Wavmouth.an associate
chemistry professor.
