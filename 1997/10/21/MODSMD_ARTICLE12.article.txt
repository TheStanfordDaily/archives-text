Donor gives Russia $500 million
MOSCOW (AP) â€” American (ieorge Soros, an
unusual mix of financial wizard and philanthropist
extraordinaire, promised yesterday to pour as much as
$S(K) million more in philanthropic aid into Russia,
making him a bigger donor than the I J.S. government.
In Britain, he's known as the man who broke the
Bank of England. In Asia, lie's been vilified as the
speculator who caused the region's recent money
woes. In Eastern Europe, he's become a one-man
foreign aid machine.
Soros said the money would go to a variety ol
health, education and cultural programs. "Many vital
needs remain unfulfilled," he said.
Soros, 67, has styled himself into one of the
world's most prominent do-gooders, sometimes
attracting complaints of meddling.
Having amassed a fortune estimated at $5 billion
by trading in currencies and securities, he has com
mitted some $1.5 billion through his network of foun
dations in nearly three do/en countries. Much ol the
money has gone to promote democracy, or what he
refers to as "open societies."

Over the past decade, he has spent more than
$350 million on philanthropic projects in Russia
alone.

WASIIINCII ()N (AP) Ihe Supreme ( ourt, in
a rare near-unanimous vote on an abortion question,
refused yesterday to give judges more powei over
young girls' decisions to end pregnancies.
I he court's S I vote left in shreds a I ouisiana
parental-consent law found by lower courts to undu
ly interfere with some girls' abortion lights.
Only Justice Antonin Scalia. one ol the court's
most fervent opponents of any constitutional right to
abortion, voted to review the state's appeal and con
siiler reviving the law.
Louisiana Attorney General Richard leyoub had
arguedlhat the. case 'cuts to the tins nation s
abilitv to protect the welfare of children.'*
I he court's action was not a ruling and therefore
set no national precedent. It continued, however,
the court's five-year record ol denying lull review to
any case dealing directly with abortion rights.
