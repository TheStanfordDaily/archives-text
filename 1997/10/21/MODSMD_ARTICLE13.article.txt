WASHINGTON (AIM I he Justice Department
accused software giant Microsoft Corp. yesterday oi
using its dominant Windows c ) 5 computer operating
system to steal customers from rival Netscape's popular
Internet browser.
I'he department's antitrust division sought an
unprecedented $1 -million-a day fine that would take
effect if a judge oiders a halt to the challenged activity
but the company persists.
"Microsoft is unlawfully taking advantage of its Win
dows monopoly to protect and extend that monopoly.'"
Attorney (icneral Janet Reno told reporters. "It's plain
wrong."
I he government objected to Microsoft's require
ment that personal computet manufacturers that install
the Windows operating system on their products
also license and install its Internet browser, known as
Internet 1 xplorer.
I he Windows operating system is used on more than
SO percent of the nation's personal computers, usually
installed at the factory. Hut Netscape's rival Navigator
is the leading Internet browser, with percent ol the
market.
I he government asked the ledeial court here to
hold Microsoft in contempt ot a IWS court order bat
ring the Redmond. Wash, based compain from anti

competitive licensing.
"This action is unfortunate and misguided," said
Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray. "The tacts will
show that Microsoft is in full compliance with the con
sent decree."
Murray s;iid the decree "specifically allows
Microsoft to integrate new features into the operating
system. That's what consumers want, and that's how
the software industry has operated for years."
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader called the Justice
Department's move "a welcome first step for con
sumers."
On Wall Street. Microsoft stock clipped shortly after
the announcement, but closed up 25 cents a share at
$132.50 on the Nasdaq stock market. Shares of
Netscape closed up $4.25 at $3 1 ).25.
I lie department's action comes on the heels of a law
suit by Sun Microsystems accusing Microsoft ol improp
erly adapting Sun's Java language foi Internet I Explorer.
II U.S. District Judge Thomas I'enfield Jackson
agrees Microsoft violated the court order but Microsoft
continues the questioned licensing, the government
wants a record $1 million daily fine, well above the
$ I (),()()(I a day it usually requests in antitrust contempt
actions. Microsoft has 11 days to file a written response.
A heariim is likely later.
