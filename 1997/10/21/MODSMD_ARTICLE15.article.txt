## Editorial Special fee proposal Unwanted paternalism 
### 
Student group funding
should continue to be
decided bv student vote

LAST WEEK, THE ASSU Senate
was given notice of a potential
change to the special fee process that
is currently employed to fund student
group's activities. Senate Bill 11 ARI-VTo
Ensure Student Group Funding" is a bill
that is designed to do away with the special
fee assessments are used currently in favor
ol a new general fee (much like the Pro
gram and Publications Board fee) called the
"Association lee."
Although this proposal more accurately
reflects the method that the local, state and
federal governments use to disburse their
revenue and reduces the number of votes a
student has to make during the ASSU elec
tions. it closes oil the greatest benefit the
special-fee process affords — direct
accountability of each student group to its
customers, the student body.
The new allocation fee would be
assessed to each student using the current
special fee funding distribution where 75
percent of fee would be picked up by
undergraduates and 25 percent would be
funded bv graduate students. I'he amount
of the fee would be set at what is currently
the amount of the special fee, which is more
than $1 million, and it would be adjusted for
inflation indexed by the ("PI.
According to the proposal, a newly cre
ated Association Board (made up ol no
more than live students selected by the
Nominations Commission) would be given
the responsibility of disbursing the money
to each requesting student groups. Special
one-time requests for large amounts would
still be allowed via the special-fee process,
but only for one-time events.
In 1969, the text of the original special
fee process was drafted in order to allow for
students to determine, by referendum, the
amount of support they wished to provide
for a particular group — when that group
wished to request funding outside the
venue of the Program Board and other gen
eral boards that had been established.
It was designed to allow for growth and
expansion to meet the needs of a growing

and diverse student body. As the ASSU
matured, the general fee structure evolved
into the "seed funding" organization that
allowed for fledgling student groups to
request funding during the school ve;ir. The
special-fee process became the marketplace
where student groups had to prove their
viability in order to obtain funding from
their customers, the students.
The new bill has some conceptual flaws
such as setting the amount by the current
value of funding (what about all the groups
that did not get funding that would be vying
for funds'.') and by the current fee distribu
tion (what if the usage distribution events
out or skews even more toward undergrad
uates?).
Perhaps one of the most important
drawbacks, however, is that by using the
method currently used for general fees, the
new Association Fee would be pinned at $1
million (1997 value) and would cause
greater politicking as more student groups
vie for pieces of the Association Fee pie.
But, the worst aspect of this bill places
control of the disbursement in the hands of
five individuals that have no accountability
to the student body. Therefore, student
groups have to focus their efforts on sway
ing the Association Board and their partic
ular interests, regardless of student desires.
In this way, the Association Board takes
a paternalistic role in terms of student gov
ernment — determining exactly how to
spend our money. Yes, the bill does allow
for refund capability, but that just provides
more power for the Association Board to
allocate a scarcer resource amongst a grow
ing group of organizations requesting fund
ing for the life and culture of the I University.
In no way is the current system perfect
— it is in need of oversight procedures to
ensure proper expenditure of the funds
received. In other words, the financial man
ager's office should not have to oversee all
events and organizations to ensure proper
use of the funds.
The current system is effective, however,
in that it allows the "marketplace" to tell
student groups if they are meeting the
needs of their customers, the students. It
reflects the goals and desires of the popu
lace. rather than patronize them because
"(the students) know not what they want."
Shouldn't that be what our student gov
ernment is supposed to do? Flaws or no
flaws?
