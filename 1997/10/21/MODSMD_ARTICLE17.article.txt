## Let's criticize the Band fairly 
### 
The more i look
at it, the more fool
ish some responses
to the Band controversy
seem.
That's right: I'm gonna
beat a dead horse because,
well, some have just been
beating it in a way that is

at least as ignorant as the Band's actions.
Stereotyping can be viewed as taking a
small, sometimes negligible quality in a
group (or part of a group) of people and
projecting that quality as a degrading image
of the entire group. Doing so is over-cate
gorical and disparaging. It happens all of the
time — whether it be directed toward races,
religions, fraternities, "nerds," cheerlead
ers, kids, adults, premeds, etc.
Usually, the targets find a way to ignore
the ignorance of the stereotyping, unless it
occurs publicly. Then, there are often more
significant issues to face.
Even though the Band claims to have
put on similar satirical shows in the past, this
one is different because it was strongly
directed at a particular minority group (and
one that happened to be present in large
numbers at the show). As a previous Daily
"Letter to the Editor" pointed out, had the
target been another minority group, the
Stanford population (as well as the Band)
would have very likely been unaccepting of
the stereotyping.
When I first heard of the show I just
lightly laughed without giving much
thought to the matter. And given the gener
al response, one would reasonably expect
that a large portion of Stanford students ini
tially thought that it was just plain damned
funny.

But many critics have pointed out, why
accept this form of stereotyping while con
demning others? Screaming "oh, it was just
satire!" does not address the issue.
We really need to re-evaluate the seem
ing inconsistencies. Is there something
about the Stanford community that wrong
ly accepts some forms of discrimination but
not others? Are we more narrow-minded
than we like to think? Are we simply
attempting to justify our initial reaction
without thinking a little more about the
matter?
Enough about slapping the Band's and
our own wrists. Another aspect of this con
troversy that is very troubling involves the
reactions of those who are attempting to
equate the stereotyping of the Irish and
Catholics with any other minority group.
For instance, one letter attempted to
draw a direct parallel between Irish stereo
types and African-American stereotypes. I
cannot know exactly what many anti-Band
critics are thinking, but some certainly seem
to be implying that making light of the pota
to famine is, for instance, like making light
of slavery in the United States.
Please!
Despite the absolute horror of the pota
to famine, it is in an utterly different realm
than one where one race attempts to com
pletely de-humanize another — which is
something that blacks in have faced in the
United States for centuries and even still
face to varying degrees today.
The Irish and Catholics have never faced
discrimination anywhere close to that of
anti-black discrimination. For God's sake
(for those Catholics and Irish who believe in
God), recognize the insensitivity on the part
of the Band but do not simultaneously belit

tie what another race has had to face!
This is an illuminating example of seeing
one condemn the over-categorization of
stereotyping while actually over-categoriz
ing oneself. That is, suggesting that if group
A is stereotyped and group B is stereo
typed, then what group A suffers is the
same as what group B suffers.
Another letter did not equate the
unequal forms of discrimination but,
instead, suggested that anti-lesbian discrim
ination is acceptable while anti-Irish actions
absolutely are not.
This opinion surfaced when the writer
recommended that Stanford should elimi
nate its courses focusing upon "Lesbian
Communities and Identities" in favor of
courses on Irish history.
Interesting...
How can one — in the same breath —
argue that the Band is a group of narrow
minded bigots while also suggesting that
Stanford should eliminate courses such as
those that teach its students about one of
the most discriminated groups in the United
States?
Those who enjoyed the Band's show and
those who were outraged by it need to real
ize that there is more to the situation than
our initial emotional reaction. Instead of
trying to rationalize how we first reacted,
we should strive to better understand why
we reacted as we did.
After all, raw emotional reactions can
aid the growth of bigotry. And even though
we can't force others to think about this
danger, we can show them what authentic
moral thought is by forcing ourselves.
