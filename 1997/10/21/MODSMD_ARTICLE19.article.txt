The greening of
Stanford
Jan. 1 can mark the day that Stanford
takes the leadership in a social change that
will sweep across the nation's campuses
over the next few years. Or maybe not —
maybe the date will be just one more mile
stone as we all blunder on towards catas
trophic global warming. We can choose as
y community to use clean power, or we
can stick our heads in the sand.
In 1998 California will be the first place
in the nation to have statewide utility
restructuring, which allows competition
between utility companies and gives con
sumers a choice. The most important part
of this change is that we finally have an
opportunity to choose not to pollute every
time we turn on a light switch. Several
companies will be offering electricity gen
crated primarily from renewable resources
like wind, solar and geothermal power.
That students lead society in environ
mental concern is obvious. The position
that students at Stanford will be in next
year is identical to what all other students
will be in within the next five years. The
simplest thing we can do to have a positive
effect on the planet is to switch our cam
pus to clean power and stop tens of thou

sands of tons of greenhouse gases from
ruining our futures.
The direct environmental benefit of
campuses switching nationwide is only the
beginning. Any company with a halfway
intelligent marketing staff knows that
young adult consumer preferences are
often fixed for life. When they see this new
generation coming down the pike with a
different idea of what is the norm, compa
nies will compete to give clean energy the
investment it needs to grow. Hopefully
that environmental preference will spill
over to other parts of our society.
But Stanford HAS to take the lead.
California's public schools will get mired in
red tape — nothing will happen there for
years. No other private university can
command nationwide attention. If we
don't do it, no significant campus move
ment may develop for years, until finally
some back-East snob Ivy school gets its act
together. That lost time is something we
can't afford to lose — the world should
have cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60
percent. 10 years ago, and instead we are
headed in the wrong direction.
Stanford has a contract with a privately
run generator until 2002. As a law student
I know that contracts are written to be
somewhat flexible, so the contract is not
the end of the story. The generator emits

greenhouse gas but less than coal genera
tors. Its power should be sold off campus
to replace other worse polluters, while
Stanford in turns sets the best example by
buying clean.
Stanford alumni and Stanford profes
sors took the lead in getting California's
utility restructuring made into law, some
thing that became clear during last week's
Horn Lecture on the subject. Now it's the
turn for Stanford students. If your environ
mental ethics make you even half-way
committed to recycling, it's crazy not to
spend five minutes helping the campus
switch over. Campus environmental
groups need to decide how high a priority
the switch will be for them this year, or
whether it should be their first priority.
Those of us who live off campus should
get ready to switch our homes over in Jan
uary. You'll be hearing more about that.
The city of Palo Alto should stop ponder
ing a green power option for its residents
in 1998 and start promising that option.
And Stanford should take its chance to
make history.
I welcome anyone to contact me
regarding getting moving on this soon, or
better yet NOW.
