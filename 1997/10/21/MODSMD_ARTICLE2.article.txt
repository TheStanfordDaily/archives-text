# Public service minor on hold
## 
### Kumar Narayanan Contributing writer 
The public service minor, an effort
spurred by dedicated students last year, is
re-inventing itself.
A proposal for creating a minor in pub
lic service went before the National Advi
sory Committee of the Haas Center — a

group of alumni — last spring. The com
mittee felt that more time needed to he
spent developing the individual compo
nents of the minor proposal before degree
granting authority was sought.
The idea of a public service minor was
conceived last year to provide "a conceptu
al framework for experiential education
and to fill the needs of our students," ac

cording to senior Kelly Naylor, a major ar
chitect of the proposal.
Students decided to "build up the indi
vidual pieces of the minor" instead of push
ing ahead with the full proposal, senior
Amanda At wood said.
These pieces include a hefty list of class-
es, a thesis, a faculty mentorship and
a cohort of peers to serve together
and discuss salient issues.
Students at the Haas Center are
currently working on forging con
nections between students and pub
lic service, creating dialogue be
tween faculty and students and ex
panding current service learning
classes.
The Haas Center "has decided to
build up the minor without the title,"
explained senior Jill Shenker, who
has been involved with service learn
ing in the past.
For now, "the minor is not impor
tant," said Julie Juergens, a masters
student in education who works at
the Haas Center. "It is key to pro
vide students with these opportuni
ties — to build these connections for
students."
The elements are being shaped
through a series of forums and dis
cussions.
The minor has strong faculty sup
port. "If you look at the faculty in
volved, they are luminaries in their
field," commented Juergens. The list
includes Assoc. Political Science
Prof. Luis Fraga, Anthropology
Prof, and Department Chair Bill
Durham, Assoc. Anthropology Prof.

John Rick and History Prof. A 1 Ca
marillo.
Furthermore, the quality of stu
dents involved has been exceptional,
Juergens said.
"This is an effective method of
teaching and learning, where acade
mics is enhanced by the communi
ty," she said.
Juergens has co-taught a service
class in Spanish Translation. "The
student initiative was phenomenal"
in her estimation.
Shenker concurred that "the pro
gram has been mutually inspira
tional."
Eventually the a proposal for the
minor may be re-submitted once the
service learning infrastructure is
shored up.
Although the minor was a focus
of student activism last year, Naylor
believes that "we should not limit
ourselves to a minor."
"We have to envision career
pathways that relate to public service
in both traditional and non-tradi
tional ways," she said.
The efforts to craft a minor, how
ever, have been frustrated by the
academic structure, "which moves
at glacial speed," according to Juer
gens. Administrative agendas are
set in a time frame well beyond the
three to five years of the average
student's tenure at Stanford, she ex
plained.
