CALL ME A warped individual. 1
have a morbid fascination with
death, more specifically, with funer
als. Granted, I was never one to go around
donning all black. I'm much more subtle
than that.
For example, most of my high school
classmates spent a significant portion of their
lives planning their dream weddings. They
mapped out every minute detail — the col
ors. the dresses, the flowers, where it would
be held, who would be invited, who
wouldn't, who would cry and who wouldn't.
Not wanting to feel left out. I followed suit,
except it was never my wedding I planned. It
was my funeral.
You see. I think it all goes back to when
my lather went around the house singing, as
he often did. One day when I was about
seven, he started to belt out "When the
Saints Go Marching In." I asked him if he
really liked that song. "You bet," he teasing
ly replied. "Baby, I want you to play that
song at my funeral."
I pondered his response and thought,
"what a great idea!" I too could plan my own

funeral. Most people think I'm a little
strange for giving sueh serious consideration
to this topic. Funerals are really for the liv
ing, they say. The dead really aren't there to
care how you say goodbye.
Not me. I want to leave a lasting impres
sion my way. 1 realize one funeral won't
change people's opinions of me. 11 they've
always despised me, a fragrant bouquet on
my casket won't change that. Mv death will
not win me friends. 1 think, more than like
ly. my death will upset a lot of people since
a will is currently out of the question. Most
of my belongings will have to be sold in
order to repay Stanford. 1 guess those of you
lining up to get my spiffy Macintosh SE are
out of luck. So it looks like a funeral is my
only way of dictating my final wishes to the
world.
Speaking of dictators, there's one in
particular that I sympathize with on a cer
tain level. His name is Vladimir Ilych
Lenin. Keep in mind that when I say
"Lenin," I am referring to that stunning
representation of Lenin's body lying in the
Lenin Mausoleum in Red Square. Whether

it's really his remains or something on per
manent loan from a wax museum is a Rus
sian mystery. For my sake, pretend he's the
real thing.
1 believe that every human should have
some sort of say in what is done with their
body after they die. Now here's a guy who
didn't. In that sense, 1 really sympathize with
his fate. His body's eternal resting place w as
determined by the whim of some Georgian
he didn't even like. Stalin used Lenin's huge
following as his own political stepping stone
essentially declaring himself Lenin's heir
apparent. Building nothing short of a reli
gious cult around Lenin, he constructed a
mausoleum for his remains. Lenin's body
has since been on display for the entire
world to file by wide-eyed.
Unfortunately, the youngest generation
that passes his casket may remember him for
his short stature instead of his revolutionary
ideas.
I'm sure if anyone would've had the
courage to ask Lenin, he would have explic
itly spelled out his wishes for his funeral.
Then he would have sentenced the fool to 20

years, but that's beside the point.
1 can see him now, "I'd prefer to have a
small funeral a couple candles and a few
of those new Socialist Realist songs. ()h, and
drag Gorky back here and have him give the
eulogy."
Instead, he got a big funeral, a mummifi
cation notice and an eternal reminder of Ins
lack of height.
But that's not all. Oh no. Lenin had the
pleasure ot spending 10 additional years
with Stalin beginning in 195.V I hat had to be
fun. 1 have trouble being around certain
annoying individuals for an extended period.
1 can't imagine inhabiting the same room
with a paranoid psycho maniac for It) years.
But hey! It's a decade long Communist
slumber parts , right?
1 he lun could only last so long. Since that
party-pooper Khruschev's destalini/ation
campaign, they moved Stalin out of the mau
soleum and retired him to a concrete grave
just outside. Lenin has the place all to him
self again. Well, almost. 11c still gels a line ol
guests during visiting hours. However, peo
ple don't frequent his granite abode as often

as they did during the Communist regime.
1 have talked to many Russians who are
si ill too scared to step into the mausoleum.
I loncstly. who could blame them. Lenin was
a horrible man. Ile committed countless
atrocities against innocent people. In no way
am I condoning these acts. Hut why would
anyone, peasant or tyrant, want to be stuck
in a building resembling a I )isneyland attrac
tion gone bad?
You can't choose how you are immortal
i/ed in the eyes of your followers. I lowever,
I think I'lvis got a slightly better deal from
the U.S. Postal Serv ice. Lenin was obviously
not immortalized as his younger, slimmer
self, but you've got to admit, he'll never have
another bad hair day.
Ummm... there's an idea. I ley, guvs,
while you're busy with that wig, could you
give me a tummy tuck? If I'm going to be on
display for eternity, I might as well be a si/c
five again.

following as his own political stepping stone
essentially declaring himself Lenin's heir
apparent. Building nothing short of a reli
gious cult around Lenin, he constructed a
mausoleum for his remains. Lenin's body
has since been on display for the entire
world to file by wide-eyed.
Unfortunately, the youngest generation
that passes his casket may remember him for
his short stature instead of his revolutionary
ideas.
I'm sure if anyone would've had the
courage to ask Lenin, he would have explic
itly spelled out his wishes for his funeral.
Then he would have sentenced the fool to 20

years, but that's beside the point.
1 can see him now, "I'd prefer to have a
small funeral a couple candles and a few
of those new Socialist Realist songs. ()h, and
drag Gorky back here and have him give the
eulogy."
Instead, he got a big funeral, a mummifi
cation notice and an eternal reminder of Ins
lack of height.
But that's not all. Oh no. Lenin had the
pleasure ot spending 10 additional years
with Stalin beginning in 195.V I hat had to be
fun. 1 have trouble being around certain
annoying individuals for an extended period.
1 can't imagine inhabiting the same room
with a paranoid psycho maniac for It) years.
But hey! It's a decade long Communist
slumber parts , right?
1 he lun could only last so long. Since that
party-pooper Khruschev's destalini/ation
campaign, they moved Stalin out of the mau
soleum and retired him to a concrete grave
just outside. Lenin has the place all to him
self again. Well, almost. 11c still gels a line ol
guests during visiting hours. However, peo
ple don't frequent his granite abode as often

as they did during the Communist regime.
1 have talked to many Russians who are
si ill too scared to step into the mausoleum.
I loncstly. who could blame them. Lenin was
a horrible man. Ile committed countless
atrocities against innocent people. In no way
am I condoning these acts. Hut why would
anyone, peasant or tyrant, want to be stuck
in a building resembling a I )isneyland attrac
tion gone bad?
You can't choose how you are immortal
i/ed in the eyes of your followers. I lowever,
I think I'lvis got a slightly better deal from
the U.S. Postal Serv ice. Lenin was obviously
not immortalized as his younger, slimmer
self, but you've got to admit, he'll never have
another bad hair day.
Ummm... there's an idea. I ley, guvs,
while you're busy with that wig, could you
give me a tummy tuck? If I'm going to be on
display for eternity, I might as well be a si/c
five again.

experts yon nil to attend her funeral in
ninted earth tones, not Mack.
