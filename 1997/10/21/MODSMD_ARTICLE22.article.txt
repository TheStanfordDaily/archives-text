vs. Slovakia Nov. 12 at Maples Pavilion, 7:30 p.m.

Instead, its gates were lined with students eager to
make early-morning signups for the Sixth Man Club —
the men's team's insane rooting section.
Those who braved the early-morning cold were re
warded for their loyalty when the men's squad came out
and greeted the fans waiting for signups just before the
team's 8:30 a.m. open walk-through.
"We went out there to see all the guys in line." said ju
nior forward Peter Sauer. " That's definitely a huge ad
vantage for us. We love playing at home."
The men's team is coming off its first Sweet Sixteen
appearance, and with three top freshmen to replace the
huge loss of Brevin Knight, the Cardinal is hoping to

build 011 the success of hist season.
"We've got three good freshmen and return four
good starters," 1 Sauer said. "We have a lot of high expec
tations for our team. We should be deep at all positions."
The men also held an open practice following Satur
day's football game, during which a couple hundred peo
ple drifted in and out of Maples to see the new laces.
I he women got in on the action with an open practice
at 10 a.m. Stanford's heartbreaking overtime loss to ()ld
1 dominion in last year's Final Four was a crushing end to
what many expected to be a national championship sea
son. ( Welcoming that disappointment and finding a way
to replace team co-MVPs Jamila Wideman and Kate
Starbird will be first on the agenda for the squad.
"I think we'll be a very different team this year," said
senior forward Vanessa Nygaard. "When you lose key
players, other people have to step up. I'm sure our fresh
man and sophomores will embrace that opportunity like
a lost child in a storm."
The women return a core of experienced players at
the post and are in good position to defend their confer
ence title for the third consecutive year.
"It was good to have a ball back in our hands," Ny
gaard said, "and to get the new freshmen on the court.
It's also difficult because we have some new offenses.
There's always a lot of explaining the first day."
Head coaches Tara VanDerveer and Mike Mont
gomery will do their best to get all the explaining out of
the way between now and next month, when the men's
and women's seasons get underway with a pair ol exhi
bition games Nov. 10 and 12, respectively.
