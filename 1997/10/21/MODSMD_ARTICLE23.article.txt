### Jessica Lan Contributing writer 
Sophomore Hob Bryan capped a successful week on
Sunday when lie became the second Stanford tennis play
er m three years to capture the 11 A Reebok All-Ameri
can'l ournament championship in Austin, l ex.
Before defeating, I K 1 A's Vince Allelic <i-2, (i-2 in
Sunday's final. Bryan had to overcome the No. 7 and 2
seeds not to mention a second-round scare in the
five matches leading up to the final.
In his second-round match last Thursday, Bryan was
down (i-2,5 I (40 15) to Mississippi State's Simon I.arose
before coming back to win 12 of the last 15 games.
Bryan said he and Ins twin brother, Mike, were disap
pointed about losing in the quarterfinals o! the doubles
competition. John James and ( lacs West lin ol Southern
Alabama upset the Bryans 7-6,6-2.
"It was a team we had beaten before, but they played
really well, and we were a little sluggish," Bob Bryan said.
"We were definitely disappointed."
"Playing doubles always helps singles play, but I think
losing in the quarters helped in the long run. I was play
ing three matches a day before we lost. After losing In
day, 1 could concentrate on singles."
Bryan said the real challenge
came in his match against fifth-seed
ed George Bastl of USC in Saturday
night's semifinal. Bryan defeated
Bastl 6-3,2-6,6-3.
"The semis were the biggest
match for me. 1 knew if I could get
past Bastl I had a really good chance
of winning the tournament," Bryan
said. "I think I really played one of
the better matches of my college ca
reer. Once I felt I could win [against
Bastl), it all fell into place."
Allegre, an unseeded player who
had to play both pre-qualifying and
qualifying matches, was an unlikely
finalist. He won 12 matches in order

to face Bryan in the championship
match.
"I was surprised he got to the fi
nals," Bryan said. "He's improved a
lot, but you have to be playing some
ball to get that far. I think he just for
got how to lose."
Bryan traded games with Allegre
for the first few games of the match,
but Bryan broke serve in the fifth
game and went on to win eight of the
next ten games.
"Something would have had to go
really wrong for mc not to win. It was
a situation where you know you can
win, so you just have to go out and do
it,"he said.
Bryan credits assistant coach John
Whitlinger for his success at the Ail-
American Tournament.
"Coach Whitlinger did a great job

— he's the main reason I came out of
the tournament so well." Bryan said.
Although this win does not affect
Stanford's team standings, Bryan be
lieves that the win will help him dur
ing the year.
"It definitely helps mentally," he
said, "because every year you come
in and you don't know where you are
at the end of the summer It feels
like my breakthrough in college ten
nis. I think I've really solidified my
position.
"My main goal is the fourth
straight [NCAA championship] title.
Everyone's main focus is the team.
This singles title is just a little reward
for myself. It's going to be a long sea
son, and I think it's started well.
"I think this is a springboard to
better things."
