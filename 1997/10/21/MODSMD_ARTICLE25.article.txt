# Escaping the bustle to find Point Reyes

### 
There's no such thing ;is a dull
weekend for Stanford sports
fans.
I Jniversity athletic teams compete
nearly every day of the week, but
from Friday night to Sunday after
noon, the campus boils over with
sports. Volleyball in Maples. Football
in Stanford Stadium. Water polo in
de( iuerre pool. Soccer on New Mai
oney Meld, with field hockey close
bv.

So many games, so little time. It's
enough to drive a sports lan with a
knack lor procrastination (I'm both)
to distraction on a sunny Saturday.
Such was the case two weeks ago,
when I surveyed my weekend of Poli
Sci reading and Ficon cramming and
made plans for an afternoon double
header ol field hockey and volleyball.
I did not make either game. In
stead. I somehow found myself in the
passenger seat of a friend's well-trav
eled grey BMW, speeding north on
2XO, holding a guide book in my right
hand and a six-pack of chocolate
doughnuts in my left. We were head

Ed KO miles north ol Stanford, across
the (ioldcn (iate, through the North
Hay and over a mountain range.
()n a breathtaking Saturday after
noon in early autumn, we broke away
from campus and went hiking at
Point Reyes.
With no offense to the volleyball
team, I can't think of a more relaxing
way to spend a weekend
I he hike was magnificent. We lol
lowed a broad, fairly worn trail that
wound alternatively through ;i forest
and over coastal clHIs. past small
lakes and trickling creeks. Initially,
the weather was perfect, with no
clouds in the sky and a faint breeze
periodically cooling our damp backs.
The trees were tall in the forest,
painted with the fall colors that I had
begun to doubt existed in ( alifornia.
On the elills, we watched the deep
blue Pacific silently and steadily roll
onto the beach.
Forest and ocean came together at
our destination, Alamerc I alls. The
main trail gave way to a poorly
marked side route, narrow and
rimmed with tree branches, tall grass
and poison oak. We followed it down,
marching single-file and frequently
pausing to allow other hikers to pass
in the opposite direction.
Wc hit a small stream and the
ocean came back into view. Scram
bling down a steep, rocky decline, we
found the stream's end: a cascading

falls, which dropped first from the

stream to a small plateau, then disap
peared iÂ»ver the ledge towards the
ocean.
Here, the wind picked up. smack
ing us in the face as we ate our lunch

of cheese and delicious Triscuit
crackers. Done with our food, we
scrambled down the rocks to the
beach and looked back towards the
stream.
Alamere Falls is one of only a
handful of waterfalls in the world that
drop straight to the ocean. It drops
about 40 feet to the beach, where it
flows another 20 feet into the ocean.
On this particular Saturday, the stiff
ocean breeze was hitting the falls
hard enough to send a small amount
of water back upstream in a cloud of
mist. The late-afternoon sunlight
sparkled in the spray.
I spent a long time staring at the
falls while my friend Peter worked
the area with his camera. I thought of
autumns in my native Oregon, hiking
with my dad and our Labrador. In a
little more than a year at Stanford, I
realized, this was only the second or
third time I had spent a Saturday on
the trail.
We finally pulled away from the
falls and started the five-mile hike
back to the car. We were sweaty, tired
and wind-whipped. We couldn't have
been happier.
On the last leg of the trip, we
ended up walking next to a 30-some
thing man and a young boy. ITie man
was thoughtful, and the boy appar
ently suffered from a rare medical
condition that would cause his head
to explode if he didn't ask a question
every 15 seconds.
Both wanted to know why a cou
ple of college students would drive 80
miles just to go hiking.
We don't get off campus much, I
explained. It was a beautiful day and
a beautiful hike. Well worth the two
hour drive.
Our new friends quickly agreed.
The boy then wanted to know why all
Stanford students weren't at Point
Reyes that day.
That, we agreed, was a good ques
tion.
