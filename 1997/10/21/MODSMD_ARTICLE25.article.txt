# Escaping the bustle to find Point Reyes

### 
There's no such thing ;is a dull
weekend for Stanford sports
fans.
I Jniversity athletic teams compete
nearly every day of the week, but
from Friday night to Sunday after
noon, the campus boils over with
sports. Volleyball in Maples. Football
in Stanford Stadium. Water polo in
de( iuerre pool. Soccer on New Mai
oney Meld, with field hockey close
bv.

So many games, so little time. It's
enough to drive a sports lan with a
knack lor procrastination (I'm both)
to distraction on a sunny Saturday.
Such was the case two weeks ago,
when I surveyed my weekend of Poli
Sci reading and Ficon cramming and
made plans for an afternoon double
header ol field hockey and volleyball.
I did not make either game. In
stead. I somehow found myself in the
passenger seat of a friend's well-trav
eled grey BMW, speeding north on
2XO, holding a guide book in my right
hand and a six-pack of chocolate
doughnuts in my left. We were head

Ed KO miles north ol Stanford, across
the (ioldcn (iate, through the North
Hay and over a mountain range.
()n a breathtaking Saturday after
noon in early autumn, we broke away
from campus and went hiking at
Point Reyes.
With no offense to the volleyball
team, I can't think of a more relaxing
way to spend a weekend
I he hike was magnificent. We lol
lowed a broad, fairly worn trail that
wound alternatively through ;i forest
and over coastal clHIs. past small
lakes and trickling creeks. Initially,
the weather was perfect, with no
clouds in the sky and a faint breeze
periodically cooling our damp backs.
The trees were tall in the forest,
painted with the fall colors that I had
begun to doubt existed in ( alifornia.
On the elills, we watched the deep
blue Pacific silently and steadily roll
onto the beach.
Forest and ocean came together at
our destination, Alamerc I alls. The
main trail gave way to a poorly
marked side route, narrow and
rimmed with tree branches, tall grass
and poison oak. We followed it down,
marching single-file and frequently
pausing to allow other hikers to pass
in the opposite direction.
Wc hit a small stream and the
ocean came back into view. Scram
bling down a steep, rocky decline, we
found the stream's end: a cascading
