# Student database now on the Web
## 
### James Pritchard 
The frustrating days of being de
nied entrance to Axess in the middle
of the afternoon are over. Students
can now register for classes, update
personal data and check their grades
over the World Wide Web. Axess is
now on the Internet.
Students and technicians are cur
rently testing the new system in
preparation for its major unveiling
at the start of winter quarter. Ac
cording to University Registrar
Roger I'rintup. this month has been
a sort of "soft opening" for Axess on
the Web.
The system can now be entered
from Lantana, Castano, Branner
and Rains, as well as Old Union.
Web-based Axess availability is cur
rently restricted to those dormitory
computer clusters, but by mid-No
vember it will be available across
campus.
The system can be accessed
through the Stanford home page.
Logging in requires an e-mail user
name and password as well as an
Axess PIN. Except for housing and
dining information, students will be
able to perform all functions avail
able with the traditional Mac Sa
mson interface. The Web, however,
will offer significant changes in ac
cessibility and convenience along
with future expansion of functions.

"I think it will improve the way
that people ean use Axess, with a
better graphical user interlace —
better than the plain old text of
UNIX," said junior Chris Kramer.
Not all students are quite so opti
mistic. Junior Mike Gaisford com
mented. "It really might make things
slower. Web pages often take a long
time to download."
The Web will allow Axess to be
available all day, unlike the current
interface that shuts down at various
times throughout the day. Although
the daytime windows of down time
will be eliminated from Axess, the
system will still shut down at mid
night and be closed until early morn
ing for file processing.
Web-based Axess has been a
year-long project of Information
Technology Systems and Services, a
University division which runs high
tech operations at Stanford. Ced
Bennett, director of application sup
port for ITSS, explained that four or
five employees worked extensively
on the project, while general assis
tance Wr<s given by dozens of I TSS
staff.
A small group of Stanford stu
dents also participated this summer
during part of the initial testing of
the Web site. The students offered
feedback on how the Web site was
workingand how it could work more
smoothly.

Further testing has included sim
ulation of large loads of student use.
"We had to know how it would per
form with the maximum number of
students that we will ever have," said
Printup. "We are more and more
confident that yes, it will work."
Although there will be campus
wide accessibility in mid-November,
the real test of the new system will be
at the start of next quarter — one of
the two busiest times of the year for
Axess, according to Printup. Many
students return from overseas, and
the student database will be in high
demand.
Both the Mac Samson and the
Web versions of Axess will run si
multaneously until the first time the
Web site undergoes a modification.
At this point. Axess will shift entire
ly to the Internet.
The Web system is part of a large
technology initiative that will bring
many other functions to Axess.
In future months. Web-based
Axess will bring housing and dining
services onto the Web, as well as ca
pabilities from an extensive wish list.
These include the options to declare
majors and minors, renew post of
fice box rentals, display financial aid
and bursar information, change
meal plans and print out unofficial
transcripts.
Stanford is not the first university to
put class registration on the Internet.
