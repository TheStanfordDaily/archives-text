I lie I Jniversity's top-paid official for the 1995-% fis
cal year does not hold an academic title. Hv far the
biggest paycheck last year at Stanford was the $806,806
earned by Lawrence Hoagland, the CEO of Stanford
Management, Co.
I ioagland's pay was.in fact, more than twice the total
compensation earned by University President Gerhard
Casper. And at $378,713, Casper's earnings don't even
place him among the top live salary-earners.
The figures will be released by The Chronicle of
Higher Education in its Oct. 24 issue. To compile the
data. The magazine examined federal tax returns filed
by 477 private colleges and universities.
While 1 loagland's earnings may top the University's
pay scale, he is actually underpaid when compared to his
peers in money management, according to Mario
Pietrangelo, manager of finance and administration at
the management company. Pietrangelo noted that com
pensation is typically linked to the amount of funds man
aged and returns that the manager realizes. The I Jniver
sity's endowment stood at $3.8 billion at the end of the
1996 fiscal year, earning an annual return under
1 loagland's management of 26.2 percent.
Casper's earnings also failed to top the chart of his
peer group. John Curry, recently-retired president of
Northeastern University, leads that list with total com
pensation of $995,358 from his university. Rounding out

the top five are Vanderbilt University President Joe
Wyatt. $479,072; University of Pennsylvania President
Judith Rodin, $453,029; New York University President
L. Jay Oliva; $426,612; and Yale University President
Richard Levin. $424,295.
1 larvard University President Neil Rudenstein's total
compensation. $284,568, didn't even rank him in the top
half of his peers. The average total pay and benetits lor
the presidents of private research universities was
$333,239.
Casper had placed fourth on the list of his peers in last
year's survey, with total compensation of $527,533. He
had no hope of retaining his position, however, as
$156,643 of that amount was a special, non-recurring re
location expense â€” in 1994-95 the University reimbursed
Casper for the capital gains tax he paid after selling his
home in Chicago. In fact, Casper saw only a four-digit in
crease in his base salary in 1995-96, up $9,950 to 340,700.
Besides 1 loagland, the four individuals rounding out
the list of the University's five best-compensated em
ployees were all in the Medical School. Number one in
the Medical School was James Mark, professor emeritus
of cardiothoraeic surgery, with total compensation of
$752.921. Returning to the list for another year was Prof.
Bruce Reitz, chairman of the Cardiothoracic Surgery
Department, at $709,084. Surgery Prof. Carlos Esquivel
earned $705,514. Finally, Prof. Christopher Zarins, divi
sion chief for the Surgery Department, who ranked fifth
overall, received total compensation of $563,297.
