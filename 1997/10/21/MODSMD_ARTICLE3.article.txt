# Dorms, houses slow in voting on grapes

### T.J. Babbit Contributing writer 
Student residences are getting a slow start
on implementing the University's grape poli
cy, which requires house stalls to complete ed
ucational efforts and student voting by the end
of fall quarter on whether or not to boycott
table grapes.
Few houses have planned informational
sessions yet, and many Row residence stalls
are completely unaware that the policy re
quires student voting and have no plans to do
anything.
The United Farm Workers has spearhead
ed a boycott of California table grapes since
1984 in order to protest the treatment of mi
grant workers and the use of pesticides. The
boycott became a Stanford issue three years
ago when four Stanford students staged a
hunger strike to protest Stanford's lack of a
position on the issue.

In response, University President Gerhard
Casper approved the policy in 1995.
Since then, attention from the student
community has steadily declined. Last year
some residences never voted on the issue, and
this year many appear poised to do the same.
Dean of Students Marc Wais, who along
with Director of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo is charged with implementation of
the University's grape policy, said that the
I Iniversity position has not changed from last
year.
The form that educational effort iakes is
left up to individual house staffs.
Some houses have dispensed with discus
sions and debates. Storey RA Taryn Up
church said that in her house informational
fliers were distributed along with ballots.
Other houses are not planning to do any
thing at all.
"1 don't think [Res Ed] requires
us to vote," said Sigma Chi K A Matt
Miller. "People don't seem to care a
lot about the issue."
"We made a decision at the be
ginning of the year that we're not
going to talk about it â€” we're going
to have [grapes)," said Hob Covaci,
RA at La Maison Fran^aise.
Asked if that decision was consis
tent with University policy, Assoc.
Res Fd Director Ann Porteus com
mented. "That's probably not the
best way to approach the issue" and
reiterated that the policy asks stu
dent residences to vote.

Student groups that have been ac
tive in promoting the boycott are
planning campaign efforts of their
own. A campus group called Coali
tion for I .abor and Dignity is working
to bring the president of the United
1 arm Workers to Stanford Nov. 19.
MEC'hA. a Chieano / Latino stu
dent group, is also providing RAs
with information in support of the
boycott.
"According to the RA hand
book. RAs are supposed to provide
a forum for discussion and we hope
they're doing that," said Salomon
Varela, a MEChA co-chair.
The relatively low profile of the
issue this year has not escaped notice.
"The issue receives publicity con
sistent with the amount of resources

the University devotes to these edu
cation efforts," said Political Science
Prof. Luis Fraga. who chaired the
Grape Policy Committee. "1 was dis
appointed when the president and
provost gave the responsibility |to
educate students] to Residential Ed
ucation. yet did not give it addition
al funds or support to undertake its
efforts."
Those RAs who have begun to
plan educational efforts seem gener
ally pleased with the help that
they've gotten from Res Ed.
"Res Ed has been really support
ive," said Rachel Acuna-Narvaez,
an RAin Kimball, adding that Res
Ed has given RAs resource manuals
and information on running panels
and discussions.
