# Dorms, houses slow in voting on grapes

Student residences are getting a slow start
on implementing the University's grape poli
cy, which requires house stalls to complete ed
ucational efforts and student voting by the end
of fall quarter on whether or not to boycott
table grapes.
Few houses have planned informational
sessions yet, and many Row residence stalls
are completely unaware that the policy re
quires student voting and have no plans to do
anything.
The United Farm Workers has spearhead
ed a boycott of California table grapes since
1984 in order to protest the treatment of mi
grant workers and the use of pesticides. The
boycott became a Stanford issue three years
ago when four Stanford students staged a
hunger strike to protest Stanford's lack of a
position on the issue.

In response, University President Gerhard
Casper approved the policy in 1995.
Since then, attention from the student
community has steadily declined. Last year
some residences never voted on the issue, and
this year many appear poised to do the same.
Dean of Students Marc Wais, who along
with Director of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo is charged with implementation of
the University's grape policy, said that the
I Iniversity position has not changed from last
year.
The form that educational effort iakes is
left up to individual house staffs.
Some houses have dispensed with discus
sions and debates. Storey RA Taryn Up
church said that in her house informational
fliers were distributed along with ballots.
Other houses are not planning to do any
thing at all.
