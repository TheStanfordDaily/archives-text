# Runners sweep ASU Invite

Despite keeping most of their best runners at home,
the Stanford men's and women's cross country teams
remained unbeaten at last Friday's Arizona State Invi
tational in Tempe, Ariz.
Both the men and women have four team victories
in as many tries this season.
Friday's race — the last before Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships — saw some new faces on the
course for the Cardinal.
"This [was) a final tune-up for those competing at
Pac-lOs," said head coach Vin Lananna. "We'll use this
to solidify our lineups."
The men's team combined for a first-place total of
just 47 points in the 17-team field, 27 points ahead of
second-place Dine College. Junior Chris Lundstrom
was Stanford's top finisher, completing the B,(XX)-
meter course in 24 minutes, 56 seconds, good for third
place.
Sophomores Jake Maas and Michael Stember fin
ished sixth and seventh with times of 25:21 and 25:38,
respectively. Sophomore Mike Devine crossed the line

12th in 25:39, and sophomore Don Kennedy's time of
25:20 placed him 19th overall.
The women finished first among 14 teams with a 46-
point total, 34 points better than second-place Arizona
State. Sophomore Shaluinn Fullove led the Cardinal
charge, taking fourth with a time of 18:35 on the 5,000-
meter course.
Freshman Elena Villareal took fifth place in 18:42,
and junior Linn Schulte-Sassc placed seventh with a
time of 18:53. Redshirt freshman Christy Lacey-Kreitz
and sophomore Allison Twist finished 14th and 18th,
respectively.
If its performances to date are any indication, the
Cardinal will definitely be the team to beat at Pac-lOs
Nov. 1 at Stanford.
'The stage is set for a fantastic Pac-lOs," Lananna
said.
For now the Cardinal will continue to train hard and
prepare itself mentally.
"We're going to be training hard," Lananna said.
"We're at a stage where our intensity is going to in
crease and our volume is going to stay about the same.
Later, as intensity increases, volume is going to de
crease."
