# Senate denotes goals
## ASSU writes top 10 list of initiatives 
### Allison Hays Staff writer 
The ASSIJ has compiled a preliminary top
10 list of relevant issues to focus on through
out the year. The list, which senators will dis
cuss at tonight's meeting, is currently com
posed of ideas from senators and feedback
from students.
Senior Ben Decker, ASStJ vice president,
said " The idea behind the top 10 list is to in
crease the accountability within the senate
and to provide something concrete to add to
Stanford."
Maintaining free e-mail access for students,
publishing a course evaluation guide by winter

quarter and expanding the ASSIJ's teaching
awards are the goals that top the preliminary
list.
Many of the senators feel that the list will
help them carry out certain goals.
"Some of the ideas on the list are tangible,
like the course guide, whereas others arc
clearly stretches," said Senate Chair Joe Fre
und, a junior. "We want to he able to say at the
end of the term that we've made progress and
gained headway in some of the more difficult
areas."
The success of the course guide relies on
the release of the course evaluation data that
is amassed from student surveys at
the end of each quarter. The deci
sion whether to release this informa
tion will be made by the Faculty Sen
ate. which will consider the matter at
the end of this month.
One of the other ideas for this
year is to create an ASSU newslet
ter. which comes in light of criticisms
that students are often unaware of
what happens at senate meetings. If
this idea is successful, the newsletter

will be distributed to individual resi
dences.
"This allows students to observe
the progress that is being made on
particular projects," said Freund.
One student, senior Wade l)e-
Gottardi commented, "I feel that
this outlining of goals enhances our
collective attitude towards the
ASSIJ. I see that they are finally
making an effort to be more accom
modating to students' inputs and
make themselves less of an esoteric
and unapproachable group."
Another plan is the establish
ment of a freshman council, which

would allow incoming freshmen to
participate in the ASSU. According
to Freund, many freshmen have al
ready expressed interest in the idea
of a governmental council.
Some students who in the past
have regarded student politics with
cynicism, reacted positively to the
prospect of concrete reform.
Charles Buxbaum, a senior ma
joring in economics said, "The com
placency of ASSU senators and
their concern with power often
makes them overlook the needs of
the common student. This list repre
sents a turning point for the senate."
