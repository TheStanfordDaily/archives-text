# Sellout
## No seats remain for the 100th Big Game 
### Leslie A. Gordon 
T he 100 th Big Game just got bigger. All 85,500 seats
in Stanford Stadium have been sold for the centennial
contest between the Stanford and UC-Berkeley football
teams, the Department of Athletics has announced.
The game will be played Nov. 22. This is Stanford
football's first sellout since the 1991 Big Game that drew
a then-capacity 86,019 crowd.
The significance of this year's matchup is highlighted
by the fact that tickets, at $50 for an individual ticket, cost
twice as much as they did in 1991. Before the sellout, stu
dents could purchase a football season pass — which in
cludes a ticket for Big Game — for $35.
"We think this sends a message that the Big Game
continues to be one of the premier sporting events in the
Bay Area," Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland said
in a statement. "The 100 th Big Game between these two
prestigious universities will indeed be a memorable
event."
Senior Damon Dunn, a Stanford wide receiver, is
thrilled at the sellout, his first ever at Stanford. "1 t's going
to be great.... There's no better place to play your last
home game — a centennial game — than at a sold-out
Big Game." Dunn said that both Stanford and Cal will be
wearing uniforms from the teams' earlier years.
The most recent Big Games at the Farm have drawn
72,893 fans in 1995 and 82,5(X) in 1993. Last year's game
at Berkeley's 75,662-capacity Memorial Stadium did not
sell out, drawing a crowd of 70,500.
Of course, the current sellout has generated many
ticketless fans. Junior Alejandro Rubio planned to show
his Cardinal spirit at Big Game this year, but didn't buy
a ticket in time. Rubio is going to keep his ears open
about extra tickets floating around.
"Sometimes people advertise these things over e
mail," he said.
Sophomore Laura Back, also without a coveted ticket,
will try to buy a scalped ticket at the game. "If I can't hunt
down a ticket that won't cost as much as a year's tuition,
though, I'll probably skip it." she said. "Watching all the
fun I'm missing on TV would lie just too depressing."
Though currently last in the Pac-10. Cal won. among oth
er;. the 15th (1919), 50t h (1947). and 75th (1972) Big Games.
