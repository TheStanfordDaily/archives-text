As the setting sun cast shadows along the blue
shingled facade of barrack number 393, Michael
Mosley assembled into formation with 40 other
cadets. Forming four precise lines, the platoon stood
at attention and saluted.
Mosley, a Stanford sophomore, spent last week
end at Camp Parks, located in the Last Bay, with
Army ROTC including students from Santa Clara
University, San Jose State I Iniversity and surround
ing community colleges. Here among the electric
poles and dry grass, Mosley began his field training
exercise as what the RC)T(' handbook calls "the fu
ture warrior leader of the United States Arniy."
