# It's the Army way
## Stanford cadets get a taste of military life on field exercise 
### Tracy Jan Editorial staff 
As the setting sun cast shadows along the blue
shingled facade of barrack number 393, Michael
Mosley assembled into formation with 40 other
cadets. Forming four precise lines, the platoon stood
at attention and saluted.
Mosley, a Stanford sophomore, spent last week
end at Camp Parks, located in the Last Bay, with
Army ROTC including students from Santa Clara
University, San Jose State I Iniversity and surround
ing community colleges. Here among the electric
poles and dry grass, Mosley began his field training
exercise as what the RC)T(' handbook calls "the fu
ture warrior leader of the United States Arniy."

During Army ROTC's field training exercises last weekend in the East Bay, Senior Sean Hazlett pre
pares an Army-issue Meal Ready-to-Eat.
Moslcy joined Army ROTC this
fall, when basic courses such as
"Leadership Development and
Communicative Skills" were rein
troduced to the Stanford campus.
()ne of five Stanford men partic
ipating in the quarterly exercise, the
environmental engineering major
braved the chilling night air and
scorching afternoon sun to accom
plish his mission, from night land
navigation to weapons qualification
with M-16 rilles.
But the weekend, set up to be an
intense as well as fun experience,
would not have been possible with
out the planning work of senior
cadets.
"As a training officer, it is my re
sponsibility to schedule and coordi
nate the events for the weekend and
then delegate to make sure the train
ing was properly implemented," said
Fred Rible. a Stanford senior.
Rible, a Cadet Major, empha
sized the need for discretion rather
than penalizing the cadets too harsh-
Iv when they made mistakes.

"But this is the army, not the Boy
Scouts," boomed Daudshah Andish.
a Ranger Commander and senior at
San Jose State.
Of the 40 cadets ranging in age
from 1X to 30 years old, women made
up about a fourth of the platoon.
Women first entered the Army
ROTC program in 1973. Although
everyone slept in the same barracks,
the women were assigned to half of
the second floor. Men were required
to knock and announce themselves
before entering the room.
Endless lessons filled the week
end schedule, from the proper way
to make a military bunk with 45-de
gree hospital corners to survival
skills such as how to read a compass
and map.
"You can't do anything har
assed," warned Joann McNutt, a
Santa Clara University senior.
The first exercise for the weekend
was the night land navigation, where
groups of four were to locate five ce
ment markers in the dark, using only
a compass, protractor and a map.
Guided by moonlight, the groups
trampled though thigh-high brush
and over rolling hills, attempting to
accomplish their mission while

avoiding the numerous hillside holes
for two hours.
Awoken at 5 a.m. the following
day, the platoon had breakafst at a
local Denny's, where the seniors
were told that their mission this
weekend was to "learn, train and
mentor." This breakfast would be
their last cooked meal of the exer
cise. For the remainder of the week
end, the platoon would subsist on
Meals Ready-to-Eat.
Described as "not too bad" and
"designed to constipate" by many of
the cadets, the dozen varieties of
these rations come wrapped in heavy
brown plastic with menus ranging
from beef stew to pork chow mein.
Although many cadets eat their ra
tions cold, one can heat the main
course by pouring cold water from a
canteen into a special chemically
treated pouch and sealing it for a few
minutes.
For the first-year cadets, food was
not the tough part of the weekend.
Saturday afternoon consisted of the
Confidence Course, an obstacle
course,and the Leadership Reaction
Course, a situational leadership ac
tivity.
"Mighty Ungawa, please give me

the strength and courage to success
fully negotiate this obstacle," each
cadet repeated as he or she ap
proached the final challenge, of the
obstacle course.
"I think my heart's about to ex
plode," a cadet said as he finished the
course.
The Leadership Reaction Course
took place during the second part of
the afternoon.
"[The weekend] gives you a really
different perspective on leadership."
said John Carl, a Stanford junior.
"You're given a specific objective to
achieve, and most people never get a
chance to be evaluated. Suddenly
you're in charge of people who have
been in charge of you all quarter."
One example of a mission was for
a team of seven to escape a prisoner
of-war camp surrounded by mine
fields. In this case, the team was to
climb over a wooden wall and find a
way to cross five chains hovering
over a sand pit without touching the
sand, while passing "captured
enemy supplies," made of wood.
After thoroughly cleaning the
barracks Sunday afternoon, 40
cadets headed home exhausted, but
accomplished.
