The School of Medicine and NASA recently
signed a cooperative agreement to establish a na
tional biocomputation center at Stanford that will
change the way medicine is practiced.
This new center, which has not yet been named,
will initially focus on applying complex computing
skills and virtual reality to the practice of medicine
but will later extend its applications to many other
fields.
The agreement was officially signed .Sept. 19 at
the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett
Field. The use of virtual reality in medicine start
ed two years ago as a project by Functional
Restoration Prof. Stephen Schendel and Muriel
Ross, a NASA neuroscientist and director of the
Biocomputation Center at the Molfett Field Re
search site.
NASA saw the potential in this field of work and

encouraged them to bring their work on to a bigger
stage, resulting in the idea of a national biocompu
tation center.
Under the agreement, NASA will provide
$500,000 per year for the next five years to support
the ongoing research at the center. ITie space
agency will continue to develop relevant software
and will also use its experience in dealing with huge
databases to provide expertise, consultation and
help in this field, said Ross.
This research in new medical technologies
would, in turn, help NASA support long-term
human presence in space.
"We see it as very responsive to our mission to
look after the health of astronauts," Henry Mc-
Donald, director of the NASA Ames Research
Center, said in a statement. "The work we're doing
with Stanford can lead to a better diagnosis and
more effective solution to the medical emergency."
Virtual reality will help surgeons to rehearse be

fore they go in for a complex surgery, and this form
of virtual surgery can also serve as a totally new
method in training medical students. With the cen
ter at Stanford, medical students here can expect to
be trained with the technology soon, said Ross.
At the moment, virtual reality is being used in
diagnosing and treating trauma and in radiology
imaging. Researchers have also mentioned the
possibility of expanding the technology to other
projects such as the Human Genome Project and
the construction of a virtual hospital in the near fu
ture.
However, the future use of virtual environment
technology is not limited to biology, medicine and
surgery. Researchers at the School of Engineering
have also expressed interest in the center, Schendel
said.
"Within 3 to 4 years, this technology will be
widely available," said Ross. "We believe the fu
ture is very bright."
