# South African writer reads from memoirs
## 
### Jason Kirk 
I he esteemed South African nov
elist John Coetzee read from his
memoir "Boyhood: Scenes from
Provincial Life" to a crowd of around
50 yesterday in the first of three
scheduled readings.
Coetzee ran reservedly through
the first four chapters of his newest
literary endeavor. Showing little
emotion and never smiling, Coetzee
held the audience captive with his
words nonetheless.
('oetzee prefaced his reading with
a brief introduction telling how he in
troduced the piece to his editor. I lis
publisher asked it the piece was fic
tion or autobiography. "Can't it be
both?" was C oetzee's response. Ap
parently it couldn't, as the book is
now being touted as a memoir.
Though the plot of the text began
tediously, an interesting story soon
unfolded.
In reading the first four chapters,
Coetzee told a story set about 40
years ago of a boy who came from
Cape I'own and moved out to the
suburbs. I his boy was different in
that his family did not beat him, he
called his elders by his first name, he
had no religion in his life and he wore
shoes every day. According to the
author, all of these differences added
up to a young boy who could not
handle his shame.
"lie blames his mother for not
beating him." wrote Coetzee. With
interesting contrasts such as this to
today's values. ('oetzee continued to
read and entertain the audience with
his words.
I lie plot twist in his reading came
as the main character chose to be
Roman Catholic when going to a

new school. I Ic had never experi
enced religion before. He was given
the choice of being a Protestant, a
Jew or a Roman Catholic. Based on
his awe at Roman history, he chose
the latter.
The rest of the reading focused on
the ramifications of making such a
decision in a school that segregated
the Roman Catholics and the Jews.
I he seemingly boring young boy, on
the basis of an attempt to make a
"right" decision, thus embarked on a
path down which he experienced the
taunts, the isolation and even the joy
of not being pai t of the larger group.
"Boyhood" was written in third
person, not the first person narrative
common in memoirs. Coetzee said
writing in third person "remains the
most interesting technical feature of
the book." He then added. "It seems
to me to work."
While ('oetzee did indeed catego
rize his book as a memoir, he also
conceded there is a fictional element
to ii to memory actually. "What is
the truth of absolutely minor events
that happened to an unremarkable
child forty-some thing years ago?"
asked ( oetzee who added there was
no way for anyone to check the va
lidity of the memories he wrote.
Many of the audience's questions
focused on past works by Coetzee
such as "The Life and limes of
Michael K.." as well as his own inter
pretation of his writing. Coetzee
side-stepped these questions with a
single sentence. "I've never believed
that authors have any privileged sta
tus as interpreters of their own
work," he said.
One of the final questions related
to Coet/ce's earlier allusion to I lie
l;Â»ct 1 hat lie was inspired, in I lie I'orni
ol tilling his work at least, by Leo
I olstoy's series ol autobiographical
novels tilled "Boyhood." "Child
hood" and "Youth " I lie audience
inembei asked il he would write any
more memoirs. ( oet/ee's response

elicited laughs from the audience
and maybe even a smile Irom him
self.
"Il seems like an awful lot ol writ
ing to do just foi the principle."
Coct/ee is scheduled to do two
more readings. One is Thursday ti
lled "The Philosopher and the Ani
inals" and the linal is next Wednes
day titled " The Poet and the Ani
mals" Moth v\ ill be at 4:30 p.m. in the
