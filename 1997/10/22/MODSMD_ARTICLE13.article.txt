## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AIM I he House,
over the strong objections of the administra
tion. approved a measure yesterday that
would bring dramatic changes to the White
House office that coordinates anti-drug poli
cies.
I he measure, passed by voice vote, would
give the director of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy greater powers but
require him to meet stiff goals, including cut
ting overall drug use in half over the next
four years.
" I his fundamentally restructures the way
the drug war is fought," said Rep. Dennis
Hastert. R 111., chief sponsor of the legisla
tion.
"For the first time ever ('ongress is actual
ly setting a standard, a bar. and empowering
the drug czar's office to promulgate aggres
sive performance measures for the agencies
which will provide results," he said.
I lie bill reauthorizes for another two
years the drug control policy office founded
in 19KK to oversee actions among drug-fight
ing agencies. It adds to the power of the
director, currently Barry McCaffery, to
transfer money and coordinate activities of
agencies involved in the fight against illegal
dt ugs.
It also holds his office responsible for
meeting performance goals, including reduc
ing bv the end of 2001 the availability of
heroin and cocaine by SO percent and reduc
ing drug related crimes by 50 percent.
It requires the director to submit a four
year plan to reduce drug use in the United

States to 3 percent of the total population In
2001, down from the current rate of more
than 6 percent.
"Now Congress is going to lake charge.
We are going to set some goals loi the < >11 ice
of National Drug Contiol Policy." said Rep.
Porter (loss, R I la.
But the White I louse, while supporting
legislation to extend the life of the drug
office, said it opposed the I louse bill because
it establishes "unrealistic and unattainable"
targets.
It said the two-yeai reauthorization peri
od was too short and provisions in the bill
requiring the drug director to submit scinian
nual summaries of progress in meeting the
numerical targets too burdensome.
McCaffery. in a letter earliei this week to
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, snid the
"unrealistic targets" could "luirt out efforts
against drug use when the public, seeking the
inevitable failure to meet these goals,
becomes convinced the effort is lost."
Democrats charged the (>' >P majority
with playing politics In setting unattainable
goals that would become an issue in 1 000
when the office comes up lot reauthoi ization
again. "What we have here is a bill that is so
unrealistic that we ate being set up on a pat
tisan basis lot failure, said Rep. I lent \ Wax
man, D-( alii.
But in the end. Democrats chose to lei the
bill pass on a voice \olc in I he Ik >pes that Un
objectionable provisions would be removed
as the measure passes tluough the Senate
and a House-Senate conference.
