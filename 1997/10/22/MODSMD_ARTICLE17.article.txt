Participation in University
life gives meaning to the
idea of teacher-scholar

LAST WEEK WAS indeed a golden
week for Stanford I Jniversity. I or the
third consecutive year Stanford pro
lessors were awarded Nobel Prizes, the high
est honor available in a field of research.
l ast week's recipients were Business
Prof. I merit us Myron Scholcs who received
the l*W7 Nobel Memorial Prize in Econom
ic Sciences, and Applied Physics Prof. Steve
( 'hu who won the Nobel Prize in physics.
Indeed there is much pride to be taken in
their accomplishments. It's not at every
institution that two Nobcls are awarded in
the same year.
Moreover, with the addition of Scholcs
and Chu the total number of Nobel Prizes
won bv Stanford professors and I loover lei
lows now totals I 1 ).
To receive a Nobel Prize is to be recog
nized for having contributed to some of the
most outstanding research in the world. A
Nobel Prize in ilsell is an immense honor,
not only to the recipient but also to the insti
tution with which he or she is affiliated.
Such awards raise the reputation of the
I Jniversitv. inspire graduate and undergrad
uate students in their research and draw gift
ed scholars to Stanford.
I lowever. it is not everyday, or rather not
even every year, that a Nobel Prize is award
ed to a professor such as Chu, who lectures
to Stanford students every morning.
While we recognize the time commitment
that research requires and understand that
as a result many researchers don't have the
time to teach students and be closets

involved in their lives, we eommentl ( lui and
Physics I 'rot Doughs Oslieroff, last year's
recipient ol the Nobel Prize lor physics, as
they are truly inspirational.
Moth of these individuals represent not
only a commitment to scholarship of the
highest caliber but also a sincere dedication
to positively impacting students' lives and
the University environment.
Chu, a former chair of the Physics
I )epartment, also served on the search com
mittee that hired University President Ger
hard Casper. I le is an active member of the
I acuity Senate.
Osheroll is currently the director of
undergraduate studies in the Physics
Department and serves as a freshman advis
er. lie also serves as an at-large faculty
member on the Academic Council Adviso
ry Hoard that oversees the Stanford Intro
ductory Seminai Program.
Additionally, both professors work close
ly with graduate and undergraduate slit
dents in the physics department.
Indeed it is professors like Chu and
Osheroll who actively work with students
and participate in I Jniversitv life that give
true meaning to the value ol having Nobel
laureates in oui midst.
We are proud not only to have such honors
awarded to two of our professors this year, but
also to have scholars and teachers dedicated to
being part of our college experience to teach
us quantum mechanics, to lv our advisers and
to encourage us in our pursuits.
So in addition to our congratulations and
our respects, we offer our thanks to ( lut and
Scholcs. for the significant contributions
they have made their respective fields of
knowledge.
We also thank ( hu and Osheroll for the
inspiration they have given and continue
to give to us through their active involve
ment in many aspects of university life.
