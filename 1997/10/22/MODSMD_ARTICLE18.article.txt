## Sweating blood: relishing the groove 
### 
SO LAST WEEK I
mentioned sweating
blood, which brings
me to the first lesson Stan
ford taught me. It all hap
pened while I was a sopho
more living in Faisan in less
than ideal circumstances.
In retrospect, I learned a

lot of lessons that year. For example, two
standard-issue mattresses at 90 degrees to
each other is not even approximately equiv
alent to a couch. Breaking up with a woman
at the beginning of a two-week vacation
together is asking for trouble. And you
should never attempt to clear out half-empty
bottles of alcohol by assigning each a num
ber, rolling dice, mixing and drinking (espe
cially if you tend to roll snake-eyes a lot).
But these are just what I learned in hind
sight. These are easy lessons, consumed
slowly like a fine scotch. Having a cathartic
epiphany is more like being a passenger in a
spinning car that smashes into a pole. It's
immediate, it's out of your control, and no
matter how things turn out, it will change
your life.
That brings me, in a roundabout way, to
sweating blood and my first great realization.
Now, a lot of this C S stuff did not come nat
urally to me then and still doesn't. I don't
think like a computer. I don't multitask well,
and my memory is shot to hell.
But I had survived, up until one course in

the spring quarter of my sophomore year.
That one drove me nuts. I'd walk while
working and run into things with my eyes
wide open. 1 would work through parties, at
least once interrupting festivities in search ot
lined paper and sharp pencils. I started
dreaming about that stuff. It was ugly.
The last task in the class was a massive
programming problem. I started hacking
away early and.in the course of a week,
wrote the most nasty program I've ever had
the misfortune to spawn.
Willi about 40 hours to go. I realized that
the time had come to shoot the horse. After
a lot of head-shaking and whispered curses.
I logged onto Axess and stared at my class
list.
Back then, you could drop a course up
until the final. Until that day. as a matter of
fact.
At that point, 1 remember my roommate
saying something about how silly it would be
to quit now. after all this madness. And I
thought, well, you bastard, would YOU like
to try writing this thing?
Hut sensing that he had a point, I did what
any sensible Stanford student would do — 1
drank a lot of caffeine and procrastinated. I
had until 11:59 to drop this beast, so off I ran
to Sweet Hall (read: hell for ( S students) to
throw a Hail Mary.
I don't remember a lot after that.
There is a rare psychological state that I
call the groove. You might be familiar with it.

Have you ever been working or doing
something so intently that you forgot your
self? To the point where it's not you doing it
— your thoughts translate directly into
action, without the meddling buffer of self
doubt'.'
II so. you know the groove. We re at our
best in the groove.
1 grooved for a long time. Next thing I
know, the project is complete, there are
hours to go, and I'm walking through the
Library Quad — at which point I was hit with
grand realization numeroprimo:
There is no place in the world more beau
tiful than Stanford University at 4:41 on a
spring morning alter overheating your skull
for 31 hours straight. The campus is astonish
ingly quiet, so much so that you hear your
breathing and your footsteps. Grasses and
trees are vividly green in the strange mix of
moonlight and streetlight.
Here, left undistracted in these surround
ings. you find yourself. You see, taking risks
and living to tell the tale gives you a power
ful appreciation of what surrounds you and
of why you're there. It is as close as we can
get to sensing God at work. For a brief, flick
ering moment, everything makes sense.
I rv it out sometime.
