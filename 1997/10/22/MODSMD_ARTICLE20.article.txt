Save deGuerre courts
Hie I Jaily's ()ct. 20 article "C'limbing
Wall I aces Delays" states that the racquet
ball courts adjoining deCiuerre pool are a
potential construction site for either the
climbing wall or lor new locker rooms lor
the swimming program.
As frequent user of the squash courts
and occasional user of the racquetball
courts. I can attest to the horrid state til
the dc( iuerre courts.
I wo of the four squash courts are
unplayable because they have gaping holes
in the walls that were apparently construct
ed using paper macho.
I am not opposed to building a climbing
wall or locker rooms, but eliminating
squash and racquetball courts to do so is
like moving the (leveland Browns to Hai
ti more.
Vou solve one problem but create
another. Stanford's squash and racquetball
facilities are already woefully inadequate.
l or example. Harvard (which already
has three facilities with multiple squash
courts) is building a giant new tine with. I
believe. 40 courts.

Stanford has two serviceable courts that
are virtually impossible to book for the
most desirable times of day.
Making the unplayable courts playable
requires a small investment relative to eon
structing a climbing wall.
lockers loi swimmers are available
next door at Arrillaga Family Sports Cen
ter.
let us maintain Stanford's only racquet
ball and squash courts for all to enjoy.

Reform special fee
I read with interest yesterday's editorial
about special-fee funding.
Although all >0 groups seeking special
lees last year received at least part of
their requested money, the fee process
continues to call into question whether
having students vote tin requests is the
most effective system of distributing
funding.
I he current fee system reflects reforms
made three years ago that allow groups to
choose whether to request a fee from

undergraduates only, from graduate stu
dents only or from both groups.
In addition to that change, many other
reforms have been attempted and even
more ideas have been suggested.
Despite all the changes, though, the spe
cial-fee process remains fundamentally
flawed.
Instead of perpetuating the futile efforts
to come up with a sensible fee system, the
ASSI I Senate should take action to elimi
nate the system.
In its place should be a more substan
tial allocation to the general fees charged
to students each year — money that cur
rently goes to the Publications Board,
Program Board and Community Service
Board.
The ASSU Senate and members of
those boards, then, would be responsible
for allocating the money in the manner in
which they see fit.
Before the implementation of the Com
mon Sense Fee Reform, groups were
required to request a fee from all students;
as a result, many requests failed because
graduate students were more averse to
paying astronomical fees.

But the effect of that reform is that very
few groups ask for any money at all from
graduate students.
Groups have rearranged their governing
structures or separated their graduate-stu
dent elements so they can plausibly argue
that only undergraduates should be
responsible for the fee.
And you can hardly blame them. Two
years ago. nine of 11 groups that failed to
win a special fee did so because not
enough graduate students voted in their
favor.
But although they're saving money,
graduate students are losing under this sys
tem as well.
Sure, they aren't being forced to fund
the International Undergraduate Commu
nity's activities, but they are being grouped
on one side of an ever-more definable line
between undergraduate and graduate stu
dents at Stanford.
Last year nearly all groups applied to
undergraduates only, and because they all
passed, this year's voters are unlikely to be
so free with their money.
Not as many groups will get funded for
the IWB-W school year, and the Senate

will once again wonder what went wrong.
Having the Senate and its Appropria
tions Committee instead determine who
deserves a fee and how much they
deserve would be a more effective system
hut it must he implemented carefully.
High voter turnout on a regular hasis
would be of utmost importance. The sena
tors students elect will ultimately be
responsible for what students are charged.
They will serve on the Appropriations
Committee, and they will approve the
nominations of students to the general fee
boards.
It will be necessary for students to trust
the Senators with this responsibility so they
don't have to be worried about exorbitant
fees or partisan funding.
There inevitably will be drawbacks, too.
to a system that doesn't allow students to
vote on groups' fee requests individually.
Hut years of work have shown that special
fees aren't the answer to providing student
groups with funding. It's time to admit
that.
