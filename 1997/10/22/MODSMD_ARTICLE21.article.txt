# Foriegn Bureau: Berlin
## Lessons from my night at the opera 
### 
Miami Leff

Some times i forget to say thank
you. Sometimes I take for granted all
that I have been given, often on the
proverbial silver-platter.
It took a phenomenal performance of
Giuseppe Verdi's opera, "Aida," Sunday
night to make me realize that perhaps I have
complained a little too much and said thank
you a little too infrequently since arriving in
Berlin.
When I found out about my housing situ
ation in Berlin, I was less than thrilled. ()n
my housing application. 1 had specified that I
wanted to live in an urban area.
While many of my friends live in city
apartments, within walking distance of the
subway system and some of Berlin's trendy
cafes, 1 am stuck in the "Vorstadt" (the Ger
man word for suburbs) — a lengthy-enough
bus ride away from the closet subway and out
ol walking distance Irom even Berlin's less
exciting eateries.
1 grew up on the southside of Chicago. I
love the city. I belong in the city. I hate the
suburbs.
After that, little things began to really in i

tate me.
For example, while it is not difficult to find
bottled water for sale in Germany, it is near
ly impossible to find bottled water without
carbonation.
For example, washing machines are plen
tiful but tend to stand alone without dryers.
Moreover, they have wash cycles that take
more than an hour.
For example, 1 love turkey sandwiches,
but every deli counter 1 have visited at gro
cery stores in Berlin carries twenty-some var
ieties of ham and other pork products. I have
yet to find anything remotely resembling
turkey.
The list goes on and on. Trivial, small and
seemingly irrelevant things that drive me
absolutely nuts and make inv stomach twist
with pangs of homesickness.
I tend to obsess over little details. Most of
the time, my compulsiveness is quite harm
less. However, in the case of adapting to a
new environment, my fixations have proved
slightly more harmful.
rhree hours of Verdi's music changed all
of that for me. I et me explain.

When 1 was in fourth-grade, nvy father
took me to the opera for the first time. I wore
a hideous white dress with multi-colored
polka dots and puffy sleeves, a creation
straight out of a bad 'KOs movie.
The performances 1 attended at the Lyric
Opera in Chicago taught me first to appreci
ate and later to love music.
1 have never seen a more elegant set or
more beautiful costumes than 1 saw Sunday
night when 1 attended "Aida."
As 1 sat there, in the 10th row of the opera
house with two friends from the Stanford-in-
Berlin program, 1 relaxed and my mind drift
ed. 1 mentally replayed highlights of my
weekend.
My friend Diana and 1 took the train to
Cologne, a city in the Rhineland with a pret
ty amazing history (it recently celebrated its
750 th birthday) and a world-famous cathe
dral (we climbed 5()<X steps to gain a breath
taking view of the city below).
Then 1 started thinking about the dinner
we had as a group the night before classes
began, last month.
The l(> program participants plus some of

the center staff went nut. Helen Bing, Stan
ford alumna and benefactress extraordinare,
footed the bill. Karen Kramer, the centers
director, gave a short toast, reminding us that
Mrs. Ding's generosity had made the dinner
possible. Mrs. Bing also subsidized part of
my opera ticket Sunday night.
Mrs. Bing subsidizes any and everything
cultural for Stanfordians in Berlin.
Though 1 have never met her. 1 would say
that Mrs. Helen Bing is a definite star.
So as I was sitting there listening to
"Aida," it occurred to me that I am pretty
lucky.
After the performance, as we got ready to
go, I couldn't help hut make mental eompar
isons to the many productions 1 had seen in
( hicago.
I he curtain call lasted twice as long as I
had remembered it lasting at any opera 1
ever saw at home.
I was tired and wanted to leave. 1 had
plays to read, papers to type, columns to
write and two trains and a bus to catch to
make my way hack to my suburban abode.
Instead, I was stuck clapping again and

again and again.
But with my new found appreciation tor
things, 1 took a deep breath and vowed not to
let it bother me.
I thought about the fact that going to
"Aida" cost me less than 1 would pay to go
see a movie at Stanford.
Walking through the most historic pai t ol
Berlin, I silently saluted Mrs. Bing.
I he night of our first so-called Bing din
ner we drank to Mrs. Bing. As I hutiied
toward the subway, I menially raised a glass
to her.
Prost. Cheers. l.'C'haim. 1 eould have
sworn that I heard a little noise ;is I pictured
the fictitious glass I was holding clank against
the glasses ol my fictitious drinking partners.
It echoed down Berlin's famous avenue
"I Jnder den I inden."
