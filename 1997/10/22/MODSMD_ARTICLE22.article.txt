Scientists focus on astronomical phenomena

Next time you wake up early for a 9 a.m. class
and you're feeling t(x> tired to face the day, think
about gamma rays. According to Vahe Petrosian,
Astronomy Department chair, bursts of gamma rays
may he the most intense high-energy events hap
pening in our universe, hut nobody knows what
causes them. Prof. Petrosian's astronomy group

studies gamma ray bursts to try to find out more about their sources.
While astronomers have been observing gamma ray bursts coming
from all over the sky lor at least 30 years, each hurst is short-lived —
most last anywhere from 10 to 2(M) seconds in duration. Petrosian
explained that each hurst has its own characteristic spectrum of radia
tion, and he works backwards from the spectra of individual bursts to
see what kinds of particles were emitted in each spectra.
Spectrum analysis is important because it provides clues about
what kinds of energy events might be the source for the gamma ray
bursts. One theory about the origin of the bursts proposes that binary
neutron stars may collapse into each other at the end of their life
cycles and emit massive amounts of energy. That energy could then be
converted into the gamma ray bursts that astronomers observe.
Petrosian also studies the phenomenon of gravitational lensing,
which he co-discovered 20 years ago. Gravitational lensing occurs
when light passing near massive objects is deflected to produce
observable arcs. Petrosian's group analyzes the arcs and uses them to
measure the mass of the galaxies or clusters of galaxies that create
them. Petrosian explains that gravitational lensing is important
because it allows astronomers to accurately find the total mass of cos
mological bodies, which contain both light and dark matter.

Research to solve environmental problems

For Prof. Pamela Matson. discovering the source
of a problem is not good enough; she wants to know
how to fix the problem. Matson, who joined the (ieo
logical and Environmental Science Department this
September, has an ecology background. Hut as she
explained, her recent work focuses not only on factors
that damage ecosystems but also on what people can

do to alleviate the damage.
"It's nice, coming from a background of finding environmental
problems, to work with people to find solutions to those problems,"
she explained, adding that she collaborates with experts in fields such
as economics and social science.
While Matson will be teaching in both the Farth Systems and GES
departments this year, she will continue her field work in both Mexi
co and Hawaii to try to lind out how human intervention changes the
dynamics of ecosystems.
In Mexico, Matson studies fertilizer use in agricultural areas. She
explained that because of the way farmers currently fertilize their
crops, greenhouse gases and air pollutants are released into the atmo
sphere. However, Matson and her colleagues believe that if fertilizer
were applied later in the growing season, when crops need it most,
noxious gas emissions would decrease.
According to Matson, the new timing for fertilizer application would
be "a straightforward alternative that greatly reduces gas emissions
while maintaining yields and saving farmers money." She said that
she's waiting to see if the farmers will adopt the new method, however.
In Hawaii. Matson is studying how tropical ecosystems are affected
by nitrogen deposition from human sources. While ecologists have
previously studied nitrogen deposition, most studies focus on temper
ate-zone areas like the Northeastern United States. This means that
even though tropical areas are increasingly affected by the same kinds
of nitrogen deposition problems as temperate areas, little is known
about how deposition will affect the tropics.
