# Scientists create glowing mice
##

1 low do you turn a mouse on like a
light bulb? How can turning a mouse
on help cure AIDS? Christopher
Contag, assistant professor of Pedi
atrics and director of bioluminescence
in the Schtxil of Medicine knows.
Using the same genes that cause fire
flies to glow. Contag and his wife
Pamela Contag, with the help of
David Benaron, a medical imaging
researcher at Stanford, have found a
way to make the insides of a mouse
glow.
Natural bioluminescence, such as
a firefly's glow, occurs when an
enzyme called luciferase reacts with
a chemical called luciferin, producing
light. I Jsing the luciferase gene and a
genetic promoter (which is a gene
that becomes active in specific cir
cumstances, like when your immune
system makes you have a fever in
reaction to a cold), Contag and his
colleagues created a molecular "light
switch" that reveals when gene acti
vation occurs.
I Jtili/ing gene activation is not the
only way to make mice glow. Contag
and his team, the Molecular Biopho
tonics Group, made the insides of
mice glow using several different
methods, including infecting mice
with glowing bacteria. These meth
ods allowed them to study disease
and other biological processes more
effectively.
Typically, a researcher has to
infect, kill and then dissect do/ens
and sometimes hundreds of mice in
order to study an infection. Not only
is this expensive, but it also gives an
incomplete picture. A dissected
mouse can t continue to improve or
sicken because it's dead. Scientists
have to move on to another mouse
and hope that what they learn from
each mouse tells different parts of
the same story.
Fo Contag, it seemed that there
had to be a way to track an infection
in an organism without killing it. "If
we can track the trajectory of a bullet
fired on earth from a satellite in
space, we must be able to track a
pathogen in a living animal," he said.
"It's the same sort of problem. Vou
just have to distinguish signal from
background. You have to label it
somehow." Contag labels his bacte
ria with light. As the bacteria infect
the body, the light they emit can be
detected.
The mice do not glow to the
naked eye. The light that emanates
from Iheir insides is strong enough to
reach the surface, but not bright
enough for the human eye to catch.
ITie glow can only be detected by a
$W,(XH) video camera, which is pow
erful enough to detect individual
photons of light and magnify each of
them one million times in strength.

The camera takes the information
and changes it into digital informa
tion, which is downloaded onto a
computer. The computer assigns dif
ferent colors to different parts of the
mouse depending on how many pho
tons hit each part. A brighter color
means that there arc more photons, a
darker color means fewer photons.
What this means is the
researchers can watch in real time as
a disease takes its toll on an organ
ism, or as a medication takes its toll
on a disease. In the November IWS
issue of Molecular Microbiology,
Contag detailed how he was able to
track different strains of salmonella

in mice as the infection made the
mice sick I he bioluminescence dis
appeared as the mice conquered I he
weakei strains of the disease. Using
what they observed in the salmoncl
la experiment, Contag learned new
things about salmonella thai had
never been documented, according
to the (>ct. issue ol Science News.
Bioluminescence can also be used
to studs lIIV infection in mice. I Ising
an altered type >1! mouse, called a
SCII) I lumouse. scientists can inoni
tor the course ol lIIV replication bv
just looking at the amount ol light
detected from mice's bodies. Hv
infecting the altered mice and mom

toring them, it's possible to learn
more alhÂ»nt the disease. IMiarmaceu
tieal companies could use hiolumi
descent technology to create more
effective lIIV therapies, because they
could watch potential drugs take
their effect on diseased mice.
('ontag said that he imagines that
biolumineseent technology will
become more common in the future,
enabling scientists to understand dis
eases in new ways. "There are a
number of hurdles we Mill have to
jump,'" he said. "You know on Star
I"rek. where they scan a person to
track an infection? We're working in
that direction.''
