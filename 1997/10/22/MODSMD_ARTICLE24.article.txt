						glimpse into the life of Zare

Editor's note — I his is the first in a series of faculty

My discovering organic compounds suggestive of life
in prehistoric Martian rock last year. Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare took a momentous step towards validat
ing our cultural fascination with extraterrestrial life.
Ironically, not until recently has his attention been
drawn to the skies. As a child, it was not a telescope that
was the instrument of his exploration, but a flashlight,
which he used to peruse his father's chemistry texts in
the secrecy of his bedroom.
In the Zare household, science texts were considered
something of a taboo. Zare's father, an aspiring chemist
forced down another career path by the (ireat Depres
sion. wanted his interests to be more pragmatic. In his
father's opinion. Zare recalled, the chemistry texts,
"would bring no happiness."
But, as seems to be the universal tendency, this
taboo only incited Zare's curiosity. Perhaps Zare was a
bit more rebellious than the rest of us. He was such a
troublemaker, m) inclined to fights and brazen displays
of defiance, that his grade school principal declared hirn
destined to become "a juvenile delinquent."
It was not long, however, before Zare's intellect
asserted itself. 1 Ising war surplus relay switches, he was
able to fashion a rudimentary computer in high sch<x)l.
earning him an award from a local science talent search.
Soon thereafter, he landed a handsome scholarship to
Harvard.
I hough Zare relates his childh<xxl accomplishments
with verve, hi is quick to point out that they were strict
ly intellectual. Sociallv Zare said he remembers himself
as "extre nelv maladroit." In good humor, he narrated

his awkward encounters as a teenager at the formal
dances his mother forced him to attend.
One of the most telling and amusing tales of Zare's
unpolished social sense comes out of his sophomore
year at Harvard. Realizing his uncouth social habits, an
English professor whom /are had befriended took it
upon himself to instruct Zare in the ways of fashion and
decorum. I he only problem was that Prof. I hompson's
fashion sense was about 30 years out of date, leaving
Zare, to use his indefinite but somehow wholly expres
sive term, looking "gonzo."
Zare has more than forgiven I hompson for his fash
ion oversights, considering him now a pivotal figure in
his personal maturation. With obvious appreciation,
Zare remembers Thompson s response to his repeated
entreaties to repay him for all his guidance. With the
twinkle of professorial wisdom in his eyes, Thompson
informed Zare that he could never repay him and that
instead he should direct his energies to helping others.
ITiis advice has obviously stuck with Zare. Largely
out of character for a scientist of his stature, he teaches
freshman chemistry — the popular and rigorous ("hem
32. When asked about his recent distinctions, he failed
to mention the prestigious National Medal of Science.
Instead, he explained how thrilled he was to win Stan
ford's Cox Medal last year, an award given to outstand
ing faculty members for tutoring undergraduate
research.
Like most of us. Zare spent the first two years of col
lege defining and refining his academic interests. If not
for a job with a computer outfit the summer before col
lege, computer science might have won out With his
good-natured and unrestrained laugh, Zare explained
how he felt outshone bv a fellow employee that sum
mer. a college freshman named Donald Knuth. Assum-
