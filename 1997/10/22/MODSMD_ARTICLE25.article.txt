eDear lorn.
In the I lealth Forum column last week, you
mentioned thai the best way to increase or mi
tiate "fat loss" is to use long, slow, distance
type exercises. Why do these exercises hum more hit
than short intense exercises such ;is lilting weights or
sprinting'.'

A David,
(iood question. I'm sure that other people
were wondering the same thing. At rest,
about 50 percent of A 11' (cellular energy
substrate) in muscle cells conies from fatty acids.
Ihese fatty acids arc the products ol adipose tissue
metabolism. Hormones ;ire secreted into the blood
stream ;ind travel to places in the body where adipose
tissue is stored (i.e. w;iist. hips, thighs) and begin to set
the steps of metabolism in motion. I he adipose tissue
is broken down into fatty acids and is brought kick to
the muscle cells to create ATI' and concurrently be
used for energy by the muscle.
When you start to move, however, use ol these lattv
acids decreases because the energy used bv the muscle
comes from within the muscle cells themselves (u
stored glucose / sugar). I he reason for this is simple it
takes too much time for fatty acids Irom the adipose
tissue stores to be metaboli/ed and brought to the

muscles Ihe muscle needs enemy riiihl ;iw;iv in order
to contract, rind waitilor hormone action on the adi
pose tissue via the bloodstream pathway doesn't pro
vide the appropriate cnergv substrate within the nec
essary time frame.
So. to u iterate, you must undergo long, slow, dis
tance tvpes ol exercise to maximize fat metabolism.
I his is not to say that the other types of exercist are
not beneficial Weight resistance training, for example,
is a i', re at way to build muscle mass and increase voui
resting metabolic rate on a daily basis. I urthermore,
similar types of exercise burn calories .is well Hut il
you're looking to maximize fat loss, increasing the
amount ol long, steady jogs and swims in your exercise
regimen will do a world ol good.
Always remember that the best exercise scheme is
t me that w< »rk v lor vou and is c« tin posed ol things that
von feel comfortable doing I would recommend a
regimen that consists ol both types of exercise to
allow vou to maximize fat metabolism while still facil
Mating the maintenance ol your muscle mass and
strength.
