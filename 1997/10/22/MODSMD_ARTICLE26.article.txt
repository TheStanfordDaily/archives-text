Wielding a sharp of cultural diversity and de
fended by a shining armor of pride, Cross Cultures
takes a stab at socio-ethnic barriers between Stanford
students.
"As students, we cannot be complacent with just
seeing the various cultures around us," said senior Neil
Athavaley, the group's vice president. "We must actu
ally experience different ethnicities and cultures by vis
iting and getting to know the students at the various
ethnic centers on campus."
The group, which holds all of its meetings at differ
ent student centers on campus such as El Centro Chi
cano and the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center, also coordinates activities with other student
organizations.
In previous years. Cross Cultures has jammed with
Stanford Taiko's drummers, met the National Theater
of the Deaf Performance Workshop and participated
in an affirmative action debate with then-Dean of Un
dergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid James
Montoya.

This year, however, Cross Cultures has taken a new
focus, making efforts to venture inward as well as out
ward.
"Cross Cultures has been concerned with increasing
dialogue and interaction among students, and this year
we're basically trying to achieve the same thing, said
senior Jing-Chyi Chao. 'in the past, we've focused on
more cultural and hands-on activities, whereas this
year we want to encourage more dialogue and interac
tion amongst students through the formation of sib
families."
Sib-families are the nuclear units of Cross Cultures.
All members have the option of joining three other
members in composing a family, and the lour are then
encouraged to spend quality time attending cultural
activities together.
"We're looking for students who are dedicated to
seeking out cross-cultural interactions and are eager to
explore the diversity on campus, but feel either alien
ated or uncomfortable in doing so bv themselves," said
junior Sonia Das, the organization s president.
"Cross Cultures provides tor these students the tor
mat and support to step beyond their own comfort
zone and take part in new activities." she said.
