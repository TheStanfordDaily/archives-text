FOOTBALI
■ NOV. I: Stanford (4-3. 2-2) vs.
No. 13 I'( 1 A (5-2.3-1) at Stanford
Stadium, 12:30 p.m.

"I tell people that you can be
lieve in Christ and be young and
not have it suffocate your youth,"
Dunn said. "People see [C Christian
ity] as restrictive; I explain that
after Bible study and attending
church, you don't want to have
promiscuous sex. use profanity or
drink."
You may know Dunn best as a
standout wide receiver on the
Stanford football team. What you
may not know is that he's also a li
censed Baptist minister.
"I was trulv called bv God,"

said Dunn, a senior majoring in
public policy.
Alter his freshman year. Dunn
started speaking to his religious
youth group, performing what he
terms "testimony preaching," ser
mons that focused on his own ex
periences.
After preaching at Jerusalem
Baptist Church in Palo Alto, pas
tors throughout the Peninsula
began requesting that Dunn give
sermons at their churches. Eventu
ally he was preaching so much that
his pastor told him a license was re
quired.
"I was able to bypass a lot of the
licensing process because people
would still come [to listen to me
preach] even if 1 didn't have a li
cense," Dunn said.
Jonathan Staples, Dunn's pas
tor at Jerusalem Baptist Church
and a Stanford alum, calls him a
"gifted orator."
"He could read the phone book

and sound interesting," he said.
Staples characterized Dunn as a
people person. "He is as comfort
able with domestic workers as he is
with Ph.D.s."
The ministry licensing process
was finalized in 1995 at a ceremony
in Dunn's hometown of Grand
Prairie, Tex., a suburb of Dallas.
With his license, Dunn may regular
ly perform religious services, al
though he must be ordained before
he can sign official documents.
"1 have chosen not to [become
ordained] yet because it's very sym
bolic," he said. "Once you do it,
there's no turning back."
Aside from a marriage that he
will perform later this month, Dunn
will not preach during the football
season. "I've found that it's difficult,
though not impossible, to prepare
quality sermons with my football
schedule," he said.
That schedule includes classes
until n(K>n, practice from 2 to 7 p.m.,
homework and team Bible study. If a
football game takes Dunn on the
road, he makes a point to notify Sta
ples that lie will not be in church on
Sunday.
Without question, Dunn's reli
gious perspective applies when he's
on the field as well.
"My faith gives me the ability to
lcx)k at every situation and see the
positive in it,"he said. "Last year,
when |the football team was] 2-5,
people were negative. I saw the posi
tive, and we went on to a bowl game."
In addition to his goal of playing
professional football, Dunn hopes
to obtain a master's in divinity and a
doctorate in philosophy.
Also a member of the Stanford
track team, Dunn will likely focus
all his energy on football and the
NFL draft this year. His dream is to
be drafted by the San Francisco
49ers. He loves the Bay Area and is
already schooled in the prototypical
West C 'oast offense.
"But I'd play for any team,"
Dunn said. "Clod willing."
