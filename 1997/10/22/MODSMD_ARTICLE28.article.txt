# Two-sport star Hutchinson is finding his niche in the pocket

What could you do with $1.5 million?
That's a question that crossed the mind of
quarterback Chad I lutchinson following his
senior year in high school.
Hutchinson, who doubles as a standout
pitcher on the Cardinal baseball team,
turned down a huge contract offer from the
Atlanta Braves to attend Stanford.
"It was really hard, but I don't know what
I would do without the experiences I've had
in college," Hutchinson said. " They're
priceless."
"The people I've met, playing in the Sun
Howl and the College World Series, getting
my degree from Stanford; looking at all
those possibilities together, it was an easy
choice to make."
It's a choice many Stanford sports fans
also appreciate. After being named MVP of
the 1996 Sun Bowl, in which the Cardinal
manhandled Michigan State 38-0, Hutchin
son struck out 114 batters and won eight
games in helping Stanford's baseball team to
the College World Series.
Hailing from l orrey Pines High in San
Diego, Calif.. Hutchinson's decision to pass
up the contract offer was not an easy one.
Living with his mother and four siblings.
Hutchinson does not come from a rich fami
ly. But there were other goals that had to be
met before embarking on a career in profes
sional sports.

"My mom was adamant about ine getting
my degree," Hutchinson said "Athletics is
what I love to do. and I feel that I ve been put
in this position to help out my family linan
cially. But there's a lot ol life after football,
and I'd like to do something interesting
when I'm done with sports maybe be
come an attorney."
I lutchinson came to Stanford known as a
baseball star. I o a large degree. Ins football
abilities were pushed into the shadows.
As a high school junior, he was rated the
No. I high school pitching prospect in the na
lion. He didn't even play quarterback until
his senior year.
"Baseball was inv first love," I lutchinson
said. "That's what I grew up wanting to play.
But as I got more and more into football, il s
kind of evened out."
After redshirting his freshman year,
Hutchinson won the starting quarterback
job last fall just four days before the season
opener. I lutchinson and the team struggled

Cardinal the length of the field and
eompleting a touchdown pass to
Brian Manning with less than a
minute remaining. The victory not
only turned Stanford's season
around, it served as a notice to the
rest of the team.
"To go into the Rose Bowl and
lead a drive like that which finished
the way it did, with a great throw and
catch, that is a great confidence
builder, not only for Chad, hut for
the rest of the team," said coach Ty
rone Willingham.
"When you have a quarterback
who can lead a team like that, the
team has the tendency to follow, and
really produce and play for the quar
terback."
From that point on, Stanford
started to roll, relying on Hutchin
son's ability to pull things together

during crunch time. Since last year's
2-5 start, the Cardinal has won 9 of
the last 12 games.
During that stretch, Hutchinson
has thrown 16 touchdowns and de
veloped into a mature quarterback
and a proven leader.
"There are times when we've re
ally stepped up in the two-minute of
fense," Hutchinson said. "We kind
of thrive on that pressure, and we
have a lot of confidence that our no
huddle offense can be successful."
It's no wonder Hutchinson can
handle pressure on the gridiron. It is
often substantially less than what he
faces on the mound.
"There's more pressure on the
mound, because you're isolated out
there," Hutchinson said. "If you give
up a home run ball to lose the game,
it's all on you. In football, you've got
10 other guys around you that are in
on the action."
This season, Hutchinson's poise
under pressure has not gone unno

ticed. He led the team to a lopsided
win over Notre Dame on national
TV, ending Stanford's 10-game los
ing streak in games televised by
ABC.
In the Cardinal's 27-24 victory
over Oregon State Sept. 20,
Hutchinson drove the team the
length of the field for the game-win
ning score. He's also completed
nearly 60 percent of his passes and is
on pace to throw for almost 3,(XH)
yards this season, despite facing con
stant pressure (25 1 / 2 sacks in seven
games).
"Chad is a tremendously capable
and bright young man," Willingham
said. "He has great leadership quali
ties which enable him to bring a
team and an offense together."
While Stanford may no longer be
a contender for the Rose Bowl, the
season is by no means lost. And with
the Card needing desperately to re
group, Hutchinson's role as a leader
has perhaps never been so important.
