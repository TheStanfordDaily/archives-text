BHKKI LFY Some Stanford fans sat
with head in hands, stunned. Some cried. Some
stared hitterlv at a scoreboard clock which read
( 'alifornia 20. Stanford I with only 23 seconds
to play, or at a ( 'alifornia crowd exploding with
joy.
A few blamed the defense for failing to stop
the incredible pair of Steves â€” Bartkowski and
Rivera while most mourned the apparent re
alization that the Cardinals had done it again,
blowing another game they should have won.
Down below this pocket of depression in an

otherwise raucous
Memorial Stadium, some
guys on their own 24-yard
line were still trying, pa
thetically hoping they
could move the ball 40
yards down field against a
"prevent" defense to get
the ball into what barelv

passes as field goal range. All in 23 seconds.
Stanford's favorite quarterback, (iuy Ben
jamin. given plenty of time by a determined of
fensive line, first threw an 18-yarder to led
Pappas, who raced out of bounds. But Ben
jamin's next pass came closer to interception
than completion, so the Cardinals were left in
the hopeless situation of being on their own 42
with but 11 seconds to play in Saturday's 77th
Big Game.
Benjamin, unllustered by the start of the
rhythmic countdown of the seconds, threw be
neath the deeply set defensive backs to tight
end Brad Williams, crossing over the middle,
still short of field goal range.
But Williams made the most of the last re

ception of his college career. He howled over
("<il defender Iterman I .dwards and raced diag
onally to the sideline. Williams apparently had
hoth a cloek and a field-goal length calculator
ensconsed in his head, as he dashed out of
bounds as far upfield as he could possibly ad
vance before time expired.
Up To Langford
So with two seconds left, it was all in the
hands, or feet, of an obscure junior college
transfer kicker named Mike Langford.
Langford isn't your usual 5-foot-5 foreign
born kicker who comes into (he game, method
ically decides which group of All American
boys win the contest and shrugs in the locker
room. "No. I wasn't nervous."
In fact. Langford is a big. friendly redhead
most people mistake for a reserve linebacker.
(He is. but is too valuable to play that spot.) I le
doesn't even kick soccer style. Hell, he even
gets nervous. Even petrified.
So when Langford saw he'd have to kick a

-5()-yarder from the right hashmark,
he told himself, "Oh my God, here I
am."
Holder Eric Test calmed Lang
ford, telling him to keep his head
down and follow through. So Lang
ford, head down, kicked it.
The ball wobbled, drifted to the
right, wobbled some more and final
ly arched over and between a soon
to-be-destroyed pair of goalposts.
The Hero
When Langford finally looked
up, "I just saw people running at
me." Those people mobbed him,
hugged him, lifted him up because
the nervous All-American boy had
just become one of the Big Game's
biggest heroes, the guy whose third
field goal of the day won it, 22-20.
Langford's boot turned those
two mournful sections of Stanford
rooters into unbridled ecstacy, and
stunned the rest of the 71,866 fans,
who just sat there, motionless, for

five minutes after the game.
Cal players, and their coach,
Mike White, cried in the locker
room. But the Stanford locker room
scene was the most jubilant "since
the Ohio State Rose Bowl," accord
ing to equipment manager Doc-
Marvin.
The players hugged each other,
yelled and sang a loud rendition of
"The Dirty Golden Bear." And in a
corner, the Stanford Axe lay unat
tended, easy-to-steal....
Better And Better
Benjamin looked bad for a cou
ple series [after replacing starting
quarterback Mike Cordova], but
loosened up after Stanford's de
fense recovered a high punt snap
and gave the ball to the offense on
the Bear nine.
Benjamin handed the ball to
Scott Laidlaw on three of the four
plays from scrimmage, and on the
final play, a fourth and inches, Laid
law banged it across to make it 13-
10, Stanford.
Cal got the ball back and
marched downfield for awhile, but

Jeff Siemens intercepted a hurried
Bartkowski pass and returned it to
the Card 40.
On the first play after Siemens'
pickoff, Benjamin called a deep
sideline pass to Tony Hill in order to
take advantage of an untested Cal
defensive back. Benjamin threw a
perfect pass and that rookie defend
er never touched Hill on the latter's
scamper to the endzone.
Cal marched right back with a
field goal with 4:40 remaining. Stan
ford then tried three running plays
which didn't get a first down, and
gave the ball back to Bart with 2:27 to
play.
That was plenty of time for the
love-lorn quarterback to launch a
10-play drive which featured two
fourth down conversions, including
a key pass to Rivera. With 27 sec
onds left, Bart threw the apparently
winning TD pass to Rivera.
That was Bart's mistake. He was
27 seconds too good. But then, how
could he figure that Stanford's of
fense would set up Langford's im
mortal wobble and make him the
losing quarterback?
