# Naylor does it all in life, field hockey
## 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
For field hockey goalie Kelly Naylor, opportunities
and opponents' shots get similar treatment: Few ever
sneak hy her.
Even at a school where an accomplished student-ath
lete is ;i cliche, there's nothing typical about Naylor's suc
cess on the field, in the classroom or at any one of the nu
merous extracurriculars she juggles. Far be it from the se
nior engineering major to limit the breadth of her Stan
ford experience.
"For young people, going to college is so much more
than an intellectual endeavor," Naylor said. "Not being
confined to an academically defined experience lets us
develop socially and spiritually as well.
" There are just so many resources here to take advan
tage of."
While her teammates may quietly admire her amazing
range of talents, only one really matters when it's game
time throwing zeroes up on the scoreboard. Fortunate
ly, few are as good as Naylor at shutting out opponents.
Making this more astounding is the fact that she
played nearly her entire high school career as a forward.
I he change was minimal, however, in comparison to her
original sophomore-year move to field hockey from ice
hockey, where she was the only girl in the l ink.
"People were pretty much open toanything,so I didn't
feel any boundaries as far as the gender thing was con
cerned,'' she said. "Until sophomore year, ! was bigger
than most of the guys, so it wasn't really an issue."
Moth moves have been crucial to the development of
the Stanford field hockey program. In addition to quar
tcrhacking the defense, Naylor excels at creating offen
sive opportunities as well.
"She's definitely an aggressive, offensively minded
goalie," said assistant coach Heather Moles. "She looks
for an outlet to start a transition, which is not at all com
mon in field hockey.
"It's almost like having an 11th field player."
1 )espite being in goal and somewhat isolated from the
team, it is clear that Naylor communicates well with her
teammates.
"She's a very talented team leader," said head coach
( heryl Johnson. "She's back there running the defense,
making sure people are marked in addition to making
some incredible saves."
()ne ol her most incredible performances took place at
lasi year's West ('oast ( ollegiate ( hainpionships, where
Naylor carried a shutout through regulation play and two
overtimes, then remained perfect through penalty shots
to secure a Stanford victory.
" Those are the differences she makes," Moles said.
"F<>r her, the big saves are routine. She makes them rou
tine, so a lot ol the time, people don't recognize how good
she is."
Not everyone has been oblivious to her ability. Naylor
played well enough her freshman yeai toearn a spot as the
alternate on the under 21 national team, willi the possi
hlilily of playing in the Atlanta (iames. That placed her at
a crossroads thai she ultimately followed toward school.
I lie choice between academics and elite-level hotk
ey was one ol the hardest choices I ever had to make,"
Naylor said. "I laving put that dream aside, now I just try
and give my best to Stanford."
While the path away from the Olympics has brought
on different types ol challenges, Naylor has met them
with a familiar degree ol success. As an honors candidate
double majoring in civil and environmental engineering,
she follows her academic goals with the same zeal she
demonstrates 011 the athletic field.
Currently. Naylor is working 011 a
thesis involving communication
within the environmental communi
ty-
Despite what would seem like an
overflowing schedule, Naylor has
extended her intellectual interests in
public service into a prominent role
;it the Haas Center. As student di
rector of the Service Learning Pro
gram. Naylor advises students 011
how to incorporate service into their
academic and professional work.
Last year. Naylor served in a dil

I'erent capacity, holding a position
on former ASSI! president Bill
Shell's cabinet and working exten
sively with vice president Nick
Thompson on a proposal for the
public service minor.
Last spring, she and Jim Finstein
mounted a campaign lor the ASSI J
presidency, but lost a hard-fought
battle to seniors Fmily Andrus and
Ben Decker. I he setback did little to
dampen her enthusiasm, however.
"Although being [vice-president ]
would have been a great experience,
I learned that it's a little hard to get
things done amid the distraction of
polities," she said.
All in all, I'm pretty happy with
the w ay thint's turned out.
