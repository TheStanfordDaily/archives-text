# Senate calls selection process for Greek task force student members unconstitutional
## 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
After lengthy debate, the ASSU Senate last
night passed a strongly worded bill condemning
the University's formation of a Greek Housing
Task Force to evaluate the status of Greek
housing.
The task force, created by Dean of Students
Marc Wais late last spring, consists of 12 people,
seven of them student members of fraternities
and sororities. Among them are the presidents
of both the Interfraternity and Intersorority
Councils.
The senate contends, however, that these
student representatives were not approved by
the senate's Nominations Commission, which
under the ASSU Constitution must approve
nomination of all students to University com
mittees.
Wais began searching for student repre
sentatives on the task force too late in the
year for the senate's commission to search for
and appoint student representatives. The stu-

dents were never reviewed or approved by
the commission. Consequently, the senate
claims the task force violates the ASSU Con
stitution.
"The ASSU Constitution is a pact between
the University and the student body." said ju
nior Joe Freund, senate chair. "The constitu
tion does not grant us many things, but the
things it does grant us are very, very impor
tant."
Senate Deputy Chair Matt Spence, a sopho
more, added, "This sets a precedent that under
mines all student representation in the Univer
sity. It's important that we draw attention to
what's an oversight, that the ASSU take an ac
tive role, and that student opinion is represent
ed on this issue."
T he senate bill calls on the University to "re
constitute the committee with students selected
via a constitutionally acceptable process" and
reserves for the ASSU "the right to review and
nullify findings and recommendations of that
committee."
The student members of the Greek Housing

Task Force, however, support the University's
procedure for selecting the members of the task
force.
"If the University did not follow the [ASSUJ
Constitution by the letter, it did so in spirit," said
Interfraternity Council President Brad Ro
drigues, a senior." In my experience at Stanford,
this is the best example of students and admin
istrators working together,"
The task force ran its recommendations by
the presidents of all housed fraternities and
sororities and incorporated their suggestions
into the final review, which will be released
soon.
The senate, however, emphasized that it did
not take issue with the people selected to be on
the task force or with the results which it will re
lease.
"We wrote this bill to reassert the ASSU's
real power in University decisions," said
Spence.
"The University definitely has violated the
ASSU Constitution," said senator Nauman
Khan, a sophomore.
