"We should fight as a community

added
Jackson, who will c< unc to campus
as part of his "Keep the Dream
Alive" tour, will not receive pay
ment for speaking. However, other
costs associated with his visit will be
picked up by a broad coalition of stu
dent groups on campus.
Senior ( aria Andrews, co-chair
of the Black Student I Inion, said the
BSI J sponsored the event in order to
"show our support for civil rights."'
She added that "shifts in the political
climate" made it important for stu
dents to hear Jackson speak this

year.
Roughly half of the money to
fund Jackson's appearance this year
was provided by the ASSIJ Speak
er's Bureau. According to senior
Olivia Samad. director of the Speak
er's Bureau, the costs, which she esti
mated at $3,(XH), were for technical
support.
Samad said she was interested in
bringing Jackson to campus in order
to spark debate and discussion,
rather than to take a particular polit
ical stance.
"He's a great speaker," Samad
said. "I think there will be tons of in
terest on campus."
