# Did he say mundane?
## Nobel winner Chu explains discovery to students

The development of teehnii|ues to cool atoms
using lasers w;is "a very mundane sort of thing,"
IW7 Nobel Prize winner Steve Chu, a physics
professor, told students in Kimball I hill last night.
But, he swid. not every winner will have dis
covered a new particle like the quark or created of
a new device like the laser. I le likened his work to
Galileo's invention of the telescope in the 16th
century.
"(ialileo also did some technique developing,"
( liu told an audience of about 50 students.
"Eventually, work on the telescope far out
stripped what he could do with the telescope."
Chu's technique, for which he shared this
year's physics prize with two other researchers,
involves trapping an atom at the intersection of
several laser beams and the lowest point in a mag
netic field. I he photons in the laser beams are ab
sorbed and then emitted by the atom, an ex
change that eventually cools the atom to mil

lionths of a degree above absolute zero, the tem
perature at which all activity stops.
Once an atom has been slowed, researchers
can study it more carefully, leading to applica
tions as varied as measuring the effects of global
warming and finding a cure for cancer, ( hu said.
C'hu's fellow prize winner, William Phillips,
from the National Institute of Standards and
Technologies in Maryland, found that atoms
could be cooled well beyond predictions in what
( hu called a remarkable violation of Murphy's
Law.
In science, ( hu said, Murphy's Law means
that "your experiment doesn't work as well as it
theoretically should.... In this case, things were
working 10 times better."
One of the most important contributions of
laser cooling is that it makes possible an "atomic
fountain" used to develop a more accurate atom
ic clock. If it had been started at the beginning of
time, that clock would only be five seconds off
now.
Atomic clocks are used in such things as tele

phone switchboards and satellites in the Global
Positioning Satellite System, Chu said. A more
accurate clock Â«|!J help computers sequence
phone calls traveling across liber optic lines that
handle thousands of calls at a time.
A more accurate clock is also part of measur
ing the rise in ocean levels due to global warming,
("hu said. There is extensive debate as to how
much concern warming trends merit or even if
warming exists.
"( locks help us measure these things and con
vince people they're happening," Chu explained.
I King laser cooling, a researcher also can grab
a single chromosome while a cell is dividing and
then siuJy that chromosome in great detail.
Those "optical tweezers" can be used to cre
ate a cell sorter, which has applications in cancer
treatment. Chemotherapy kills cancerous cells
but is damaging to humans because it also kills
some healthy cells. With the tweezers, Chu said,
it may be possible to draw blood, pick out can
cerous cells and return the healthy ones to the pa
tient.
