The Stanford Project for
Smokeless Schools
is composed of undergraduates and medical
students who are enthusiastic about working
with local school districts to reduce youth
tobacco usage (we teach em to kick butts).
Our projects include tobacco prevention and
cessation programs in elementary; middle
and high schools and producing instructional
audio-visual materials for use in these
programs. We work with the American
Cancer Society, Cowell Student Health
Service, and several faculty of the Stanford
Medical School. If you are interested in these
projects, please join us for a FREE DINNER
at 7:00 p.m. in the Haas Centers Donald
Kennedy Room on October 23. Please e-mail
Gary at gulaner@leland so we can estimate
the number of people attending.
