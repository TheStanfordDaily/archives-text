# Jackson champions equal rights
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson yesterday called on Stan
ford students to help break down barriers to equali
ty.
Before a comparatively subdued crowd of sever
al hundred students in White Plaza, the former pres
idential candidate and founder of the Rainbow
Coalition explained that much work remains in
opening up opportunities for women and minorities,
especially in California.
Jackson was at Stanford for the third consecutive
year, this time stopping on his "Save the Dream"
march from San Diego to Sacramento. Passage of
the anti-affirmative action Proposition 209 in last
November's election and current efforts to eliminate
bilingual education are keeping the state from build
ing on successful civil rights efforts, he said.
His march is designed to serve as a reminder that
all Americans should be guaranteed equal protec
tion and equal opportunity.
The dream, Jackson said, "is not a chicken in
every pot and a car in every garage. It is more funda
mental than that. The dream has more depth and
breadth and meaning than that."
Jackson spoke of America alternately as a tent
and as a quilt that covers all its inhabitants but also
celebrates the color and unique qualities of each one.
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'sdreamofasociety
that judges people by character rather than color is
the dream "for which we struggle, for which we
march and are martyred and have died," he said.
King's statements have been distorted by conser
vative politicians who never even heard him speak.
Jackson said, and now, the dream needs to be rebuilt.
Jackson called for limits to states' rights to in
fringe on equal opportunities for their citizens. Al
abama, Arkansas and South Carolina tried to do thai
by blocking school doors and segregating buses ear
lier this century, he said, and California Gov. Pete
Wilson is following in the same tradition.
California does not have the right to do that..lack
son said. "We deserve to live under one flag."
The improvements that come from breaking
down barriers to equality are vast, he said, giving as
evidence women's progress since the passage of Title
IX, which requires schools to spend equal amounts

on men's and women's sports,
among other stipulations.
"When walls come down, we all
get better," Jackson said.
Hut Prop. 209 defies Title IX. he
said, because it tries to claim there is
"no longer a gender or race prob
lem. . . It disavows the glass ceiling
for women."
Jackson also exhorted the crowd
not to stereotype the poor.
"Most poor people are not on
welfare. Let's unlearn that myth,"

he said. " I'hey work to earn every
day.
Speaking of hospital orderlies,
he s;ikl "No job is beneath them,yet
when they get siek. they cannot af
ford to lie in the bed they make
every day."
What makes the difference be
tween Stanford students and chil
dren in pool public schools is a mat -
let of money, not biology. Jackson
said.
"You have an opportunity, not
genes," he said, calling on his audi
ence to "pull down walls and build
bridges."
Prop. 209 is "madness." he said.

and calls to eliminate bilingual edu
cation are "wholly irrational" in a
hemisphere where English is a mi
nority language.
"English is a great language,"
Jackson said, "but it's not wholly sa
cred. Jesus didn't speak it."
In order for the United States to
join "the real world order,"' Jackson
said, "there must be some commit
ment to closing the gap of opportu
nity.
"Change takes place when the
minds of people change, not just
their hearts."
The speech was sponsored by
more than 20 campus groups.
