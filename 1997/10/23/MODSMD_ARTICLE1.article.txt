# Jackson champions equal rights

### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson yesterday called on Stan
ford students to help break down barriers to equali
ty.
Before a comparatively subdued crowd of sever
al hundred students in White Plaza, the former pres
idential candidate and founder of the Rainbow
Coalition explained that much work remains in
opening up opportunities for women and minorities,
especially in California.
Jackson was at Stanford for the third consecutive
year, this time stopping on his "Save the Dream"
march from San Diego to Sacramento. Passage of
the anti-affirmative action Proposition 209 in last
November's election and current efforts to eliminate
bilingual education are keeping the state from build
ing on successful civil rights efforts, he said.
His march is designed to serve as a reminder that
all Americans should be guaranteed equal protec
tion and equal opportunity.
The dream, Jackson said, "is not a chicken in
every pot and a car in every garage. It is more funda
mental than that. The dream has more depth and
breadth and meaning than that."
Jackson spoke of America alternately as a tent
and as a quilt that covers all its inhabitants but also
celebrates the color and unique qualities of each one.
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'sdreamofasociety
that judges people by character rather than color is
the dream "for which we struggle, for which we
march and are martyred and have died," he said.
King's statements have been distorted by conser
vative politicians who never even heard him speak.
Jackson said, and now, the dream needs to be rebuilt.
Jackson called for limits to states' rights to in
fringe on equal opportunities for their citizens. Al
abama, Arkansas and South Carolina tried to do thai
by blocking school doors and segregating buses ear
lier this century, he said, and California Gov. Pete
Wilson is following in the same tradition.
California does not have the right to do that..lack
son said. "We deserve to live under one flag."
The improvements that come from breaking
down barriers to equality are vast, he said, giving as
evidence women's progress since the passage of Title
IX, which requires schools to spend equal amounts
