Government involved with casinos
WASHINGTON (AP) Despite warnings
that White House involvement would be "disas
trous" and "political poison." presidential aides
contacted the Interior Department three times in
1995 about an Indian casino opposed by a Demo
cratic fund-raiser, internal memos show.
The aides inquired about the pending decision
on whether to approve a Wisconsin casino sought
by three tribes and learned weeks in advance that
Interior was likely to rule in favor of rival wealthy
tribes opposed to the project, the documents show.
The tribes that won later donated more than
$270.(XX) to the Democratic Party.
The White House memos reviewed by The
Associated Press show that a lobbvist-fund-raiser
for a tribe opposing the casino pressed the White
House to intervene. Federal court records show
the lobbyist suggested to Democratic officials
around the same time that he could gel some trib
al members to attend a $J ,IXK)-a-plate fund-raiser
for President Clinton.
The White House said yesterday that its con
tacts "were not an effort to influence the depart
ment's decision and that the department was well
on its way toward its final decision before the first
status inquiry was made."

jet trainer crashed yesterday after an in-flight colli
sion with an F-16 fighter jet at Edwards Air Force
Base in California, the service announced.

at the Pentagon. The F-16 Fighting Falcon landed,

The T-38 is a two-seat training jet. the F-16 a
single-seat jet.

training procedures after a rash of air crashes.

crashed at Edwards, in southern California's
Mojave Desert.
