## Editorial Transcript changes For the Record 
### 
Registrar should take a
cautious approach to
transcript changes

SINCE A UNIVERSITY transcript is
not a trivial document, proposed
changes in the transcript format is a
source of concern to students.
This is especially true at Stanford, where
the transcript, devoid of an official (iPA and
class rank, is conducive to creating a less
non-competitive academic environment.
Although we agree that the University
Registrar's proposal to use full course titles
on the transcript would be a positive devel
opment, we have reservations about the
benefits of including information regarding
academic awards.
There are a variety of benefits that can
be gained by using full course titles.
First of all. employers and other organi
zations that rely on the transcript to assess
Stanford students are often unfamiliar with
the ways courses are numbered.
I Jsing full course titles and eliminating
the current IN-eharacter limit would allow
the transcript to paint a clearer picture of a
student's interests, educational background
and academic progress.
This will come as a relief to everybody
involved as there will be no more unread
able documents consisting of oddly truncat
ed phrases.
After all. the transcript's purpose is to
clearly transmit coursework information
and the use of full course titles can only aid
in eliminating the potential for misinterpre
tations.
Including awards on the transcript, how
ever. does not provide such benefits.
Although the idea is well-intentioned, there
are numerous potential drawbacks.
Will the addition of major scholarships,
dean's awards and Phi Beta Kappa mem
bership to the transcript supply organiza
tions extra information about a student?
Not likely. Receiving a Rhodes scholar

ship is not one of those distinctions thai stu
dents fail to include in their resumes.
Instead of clarifying matters, the inclu
sion of awards raises difficult questions.
Foremost among these is which awards
should be listed. Currently only University
awards, such as "honors" or "graduation
with distinction." are listed on the trail
script.
While listing awards like Rhodes, Mar
shall and Truman scholarships may be seem
logical, the line has to be drawn at some
point. This can only lead to attaching an
additional value judgment as to the relative
merit of a particular award.
Secondly, according to I Iniversity Regis
trar Roger Print up. the ASSI I Senate has
been charged willi making the highly sub
jective decision of which awards should be
placed on the transcript.
It is far from clear why such a highly polit
ical body is uniquely qualified for the task.
Even more troubling is the possibility
that Stanford students will race to till their
newly revamped transcripts with as many
distinctions as possible.
The current transcript shies away from
putting competitive pressure on students by
calculating neither (iPA nor class rank.
However, the addition of awards to the
transcript would be inconsistent with efforts
to lessen the pressures felt by students.
By de-emphasi/ing such distinguishing
indicators, the current transcript format
reinforces one of the main purposes of the
Stanford education, which is to gain an
appreciation for learning rather than to
pack one's transcript with awards.
In short, by introducing to the transcript
data above and beyond grades, the Regis
trar's Office runs a serious risk of opening a
Pandora's Box of subjective judgments and
peer pressure.
While we commend the joint efforts of
the Registrar and the ASSI J in considering
transcript review, we believe that changes
must stop short of adding awards to the
document.
After all. we love to complain about the
woes of resume packing. I et 's prevent inau
gurating a new vice transcript packing.
