## Dear Dr. Dissertation

Dear Dr. Disserta
tion:
I've just finished collect
ing all my data, and I'm
ready to start writing.
Where should I begin'.'
Gentle reader:
You could start by flesh-

ing out your conceptual framework, or per
haps writing up your findings, but I say go
with the flow and begin where everyone
else begins: write your acknowledgments
first. (When in Rome, use Roman Times.)
Most doctoral students I know spend a
huge amount of time crafting the academic
version of award show acceptance speeches
(and at live pages, still aren't as long as the
speeches).
Some go Sally Field-esque ("You like
me, you really like me"): some Kirstie
Alley-esque ("Thanks for the big one").
Mostly, it's a chance to thank the friends
and family who saw you through your
ordeal.
The most difficult part, of course, is fig
uring out how to thank your committee.
There is always one committee mem
ber who drove you crazy, but you still
need to find a way to politely thank him
or her.
Here's ;t tip: RKiHT: "Also, thanks to
Dr. McCiuire lor providing feedback that
introduced multiple perspectives, for his
faith in my writing and for giving me the
intellectual space to develop my ideas."
WRONG: "Thanks for nothing to Dr.
McCiuire for providing contradictory
advice, for never reading my dissertation
drafts and for never showing up at appoint
ments to discuss my research."'
Dear Dr. Dissertation:
Any advice on how I should come up
with a title for my dissertation?
Gentle reader:
Most people seem to choose some
clever short title, followed by a long, dry
description of the tbifsis.

For example, "The Public Mandate: A
Foucauldian Analysis of the Social Episte
mology of the Constructed Identities of
Political Actors and the Hegemony of Post
modern Society."
Just like the unnecessary overuse of for
eign language phrases, this convention
appears to have become de rigueur.
At all costs, avoid this title-colon-subti
tle construction; it has become tiresome
and boring. For suggestions, you might
want to check out my book Descending
Colon: How to Craft a Title without the
Ãœbiquitous Punctuation Mark.
Dear Dr. Dissertation:
OK, here's my working title: "Cell
I'honies: The Identification of Transposon
tagged Mutations in Essential Genes that
affect Cell Morphology in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae." Mow might I improve that so it
might he picked up In a publisher and actu
ally read by a lot of people?
Gentle reader:
"Cell Phonies: The Identification of
Transposon-tagged Mutations in Essential
Genes that affect Cell Morphology in Sac
charomyces cere isiae" by Kitty Kelley.
Dear Dr. Dissertation:
I never considered myself a particularly
well-endowed chair, hut with a 13-page cur
riculum vitac, I seem t0...
Gentle reader:
Sorry, you seem to have confused this
column with another Forum.
Dear Dr. Dissertation:
Why does Stanford need so many copies
<d' my dissertation?
Gentle reader:
I contacted Dr. M. Stewart at Old
Union, and this was her response: "Once
we receive the dissertations, we remove the
covers and cut them into small circles.
After affixing some potpourri and glitter,
they become delightful coasters. The pages
are removed and folded into origami
cranes, which can be attached by string and

used as table garlands. The acid-free paper
ensures the centerpiece will last for years.
And that's a good thing."
Dear Dr. Dissertation:
I was about to finish my thesis, and then
I just read about a new article that refutes
everything I claim! What should I do.'
Gentle reader:
There are ways you can mention the
new information, but minimize it so your
main point remains intact.
You might write it as such: "My tindings
are strongly supported by the overwhelm
ing preponderance ot the theoretical and
empirical literature, although a slightly dis
senting perspective has been tentatively
suggested in one small pilot study."
Dear Dr. Dissertation:
Although your advice always seems
sound, why should 1 listen to what you ha>e
to say?
Gentle reader:
After four years of undergraduate work
and six years ol graduate school, after years
of fieldwork and experiments, after years
of toiling away at poverty-level wages, alter
years of sleepless nights working on my
thesis, 1 finally have what I've sought for a
decade: a framed piece of paper hanging on
my wall. And you don't.
Dear Dr. Dissertation:
I read in your column a couple weeks
ago about the absence of television shows
that portray graduate students. What about
"The Paper Chase"?
Gentle reader:
My findings are strongly supported by
the overwhelming preponderance of the
theoretical and empirical literature,
although a slightly dissenting perspective
has been tentatively suggested in one small
pilot study.
