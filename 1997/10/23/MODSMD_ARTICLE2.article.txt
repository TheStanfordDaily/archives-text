# Worker disputes continue at ranch

On Webb Ranch, a 237-acre piece of Stan
ford-owned land that has been leased to the
Webb family since 1922, farm laborers, farm
management, union leaders and Stanford pro
fessors are engaged in an ongoing dispute over
fair wages and safe working conditions.
This year, the 20 agricultural laborers who
live on the ranch got a new contract, mandating

a 9.5 percent increase in wages over the next
three years. This contract was negotiated hy
their union. Service Employees International
Union 1X77. that began representing the work
ersin I WO.
According to ranch manager I om I luhbard.
workers were not generally pleased with their
wages. At present, the minimum wage on the
ranch ranges between $(i.50 and $9.50.
However, some workers claim that their lei

low laborers' push for a higher salary has been
detrimental to the ranch community.
"A lot of the workers keep fighting because
they want more money. Ii separates the commu
nity." said worker Maria do Jesus (iodines, who
has lived for ten years in a ranch trailer. "I say to
them, try go living in I'alo Alto for $1,200 a
month." li s free here. Ii is only a ranch."
Godines also said that the union
is no longer in touch with the work
ers and doesn't always understand
their concerns. "We don't have
much to do with them," she said.
Hubbard, though, downplayed
workers' dissatisfaction. "Like any
body," Hubbard said, "they want
more money. As far as the working
conditions, we have, like any work
place, problems with individual
workers."
Nevertheless, Hubbard agreed
with Godines that the union does
not always represent the best inter
ests of the farm workers.
Under the union contract, the
ranch is no longer responsible for
the cost of maintenance repairs in
the workers' trailers and dormito
ry. Hence, Hubbard said, the union
gives the workers a lump sum of
money to use to improve their liv
ing quarters. However, this method
has caused arguments among
workers who cannot decide how to

spend the money.
This provision in the contraet
followed a labor inspection in 1990
that detected 70 infractions at the;
raneh,some of which were as minor;
as a broken light bulb. The inspec
tion led to a $100,000 improvement
project for workers' living condi-!
tions, including the addition of new,
mobile homes and the renovation
of electricity, gas and sewer units;
within the trailers.
And while these improvements'
have made life a little easier for
ranch workers, a lot still needs to be
done, said English Prof. Ron Reb-.
hoi/.
His main concern arises from-'
Stanford's policy of neutrality on,
all ranch issues. He said he believes!
that the University should speak
out on the laborers' unfair wages,
and living conditions.
"It concerns me that a group of;
farm workers are being exploited'
on Stanford land without Stanford'
taking any part," said Rebholz. He
added that it is "morally reprehen-i
sible that Stanford hasn't taken any!
stand." !
