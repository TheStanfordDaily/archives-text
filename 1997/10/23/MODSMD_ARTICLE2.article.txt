Webb family since 1922, farm laborers, farm
management, union leaders and Stanford pro
fessors are engaged in an ongoing dispute over
fair wages and safe working conditions.
This year, the 20 agricultural laborers who
live on the ranch got a new contract, mandating

a 9.5 percent increase in wages over the next
three years. This contract was negotiated hy
their union. Service Employees International

According to ranch manager I om I luhbard.
workers were not generally pleased with their
wages. At present, the minimum wage on the
ranch ranges between $(i.50 and $9.50.

low laborers' push for a higher salary has been
detrimental to the ranch community.
