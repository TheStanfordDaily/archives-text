Procedure wasn't violated
I ;im writing to clarify an article in yes
terday's Daily documenting concerns
raised by the ASSU that the formation of a
(ireek Housing Task Force violated the
ASSU Constitution.
This " Task Force" is. in fact, a working
group of a steering committee charged
with implementing the recommendations
of the Greek Task Force (which completed
its work last spring).
I his working group is not a I University
committee as described in the Faculty
Handbook (which makes explicit reference
to the nominations commission process
administered by the ASSU). nor has it been
appointed by the University President.
Therefore, this matter is not an ASSU
constitutional issue.
Moreover, the spirit of meaningful stu

dent representation in this process is evi
denced by the fact that there are more stu
dents on this working group than staff —
and these students were recruited In fellow
students who are serving as Interfraternity
and Intersororitv Council Presidents.

Message was misguided
Stiller paper would make for better
paper airplanes.
Instead of editorials, why not leave a
space blank with only the message, "This
space intentionally left blank"?
I find it unfortunate that precious space
in the Daily was utilized to praise only
Prof. Chu and Prof. Osheroff.
While they did win the Nobel Prize,
your editorial, which cited the number ot

Nobel laureates at Stanford, might lead
one to think that the editorial board
believes that such numbers, as well .is the
Nobel Pri/e. are significant.
This is unfortunate.
Did the board consider the possibility
that the decision made In the committee
that selected the l 1 ) I ' 7 Nobel Pri/e in
physics may have been arbitrary?
Or that CMm might not be an intrinsical
ly better researcher than others who have
not won the Nobel Pri/e. but rather hap
pened to stumble upon a discovery worths
of an award during his lifetime?
My intent here is not to suggest that
another member of the Stanford Physics
Department was more worthv ot the 1M97
Nobel Pri/e in physics, nor is it to claim
that Clui is unworthy of the Nobel Prize,
but rather, it is to note that without having
considered these possibilities, the editorial

is more or less worthless, and it serves sole
ly to perpetuate the myth that the Nobel
Pri/e is both a necessary and sufficient con
dition for being considered a superstar
researcher.
There are many professors at Stanford
whom one would like to think are perform
ing Nobel-caliber research, who will never
make a journey to Stockholm.
I his not only includes various other
members of Stanford's Physics Depart
ment. but also includes professors perform
ing research in mathematics and computer
science, two fields in which the Nobel Pri/e
is not "the highest honor available."
It is nice that Chu and Osheroff are so
committed to "positively impacting stu
dents' lives." but 1 can't help but think that
they might offer more to both the Univer
sity and society if they spent less time help
ing freshmen and more time doing w hat

they supposedly do best — research.
It also sickens me that the board
believes that "such awards... inspire grad
uate and undergraduate students in their
research."
II the Nobel pri/.e something that the
young minds of today are truly inspired by.
they would be best advised not to study
computer science or mathematics and be
prepared for ;i disappointing life right?
Lastly. I find it curious that the descrip
tion of Chu enthusiastically notes that he
"served on the search committee that hired
University President Gerhard Casper."
The people whom I have talked with
seem to think that Chu might be more of a
hero, if one could state that he "served on
the search committee that removed Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper."
