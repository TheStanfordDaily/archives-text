# Foriegn Bureau: Hong Kong
## The 						experience is all in the approach

Therese Lee

IN A FEVERISH state. I laid on a sub
way station bench and closed my eyes.
I extended my legs and felt the cool
metal press against my sweaty back.
I listened as my train stopped and whis
tled by. rushing away a fresh batch of pas
sengers. Passengers with obligations and
responsibilities. People that had some
where to go.
1 had no here to go. I reveled in the
freedom of unconventional rest. 1 turned
my face to the wall; half-oblivious of the
stares of Hong Kong passers-by.
What a novelty. A girl lying on the sub
way bench. Not very proper for a Chinese
person.
The warm air of the Sham Shui Po sta
tion enveloped me and threatened to lull
me to sleep. 1 didn't want to be rudely
awakened by green-uniformed police bark
ing at me in Cantonese, so 1 gently protest
ed the beckoning of the dreamworld.
I was calmed by the irregular breathing
of my congested lungs.
1 laughed at myself. I had gotten on the
wrong train again. But 1 didn't feel like
heading back to my flat yet.
I was enjoying my solitude.
Since leaving the United States two
months ago, passport and luggage in hand.
I have had countless new experiences and
met dozens of new people.
I have also spent countless hours by
myself, exploring cities, sampling Asian
delicacies and learning to appreciate my
own company. On the whole, it's been
good.
Yet 1 often yearn to be in the company
of people I've known longer than two
months.

1 need them to help me keep perspec
tive, because introspection can become a
dangerous thing. It's difficult to control and
can evolve into a parasite that feeds on
your confidence and distorts your perspec
tive.
It touches off a cycle of questions and
self-doubts. And if no one else is around to
straighten you out, only you can talk your
self out of it.
It has been a little difficult teaching
myself to talk myself out of these cycles.
Thousands of miles away from friends, 1
can only claim a "virtual presence" in their
lives.
I send little bits of electronic data over
seas, telling about the
latest news in tleef@stanford.edu's life.
Sometimes lchyu@stanford.edu writes
back.
Life goes on for my friends without me.
And that is how it should be.
As simple as it is, it took me a while to
realize that we're all alone to a certain
extent, living out our individual lives. We
live out our own realities, sometimes shar
ing the experiences with each other and
sometimes not.
I am reminded that this is what makes
experience so subjective. Since beginning
this overseas program, I have sat through
countless lectures, listening to American
classmates (long indoctrinated with anti-
Communist, history book propaganda) ask
quasi-rhetorical questions, seeking evi
dence of Communist oppression of the Chi
nese people.
"So during the Great Leap Forward,
Mao basically just took all the metal away
from the Chinese people?" the inquiring

mind wanted to know.
"1 just don't understand how any Chi
nese person could still respect Mao," he
added, in reference to the Mao portraits
that proliferate many Chinese homes. "It
must be all the propaganda. They're just
ignorant of what really happened."
Thank you, sir. for your overreaching
assessment of the 1.2 billion Chinese popu
lation.
Never mind the fact that Mao was key in
ridding China of the imperialist maggots
that had fed on it for decades. Mao allowed
the Chinese people "to stand up."
He allowed them to be proud of them
selves as a people and a nation after years
of humiliating foreign intrusion. For a
while, anyway.
In short, there is good reason why an
educated Chinese person could possibly
appreciate Mat). As there are many reasons
why they would choose not to.
But assigning ignorance to 1.2 billion
people after having a month of Chinese his
tory lessons is unacceptable.
This classmate and 1 began this same
program in late August. We traveled
through mainland China together, visited
the same peasant village and saw the same
capitalist vendors on the Beijing streets.
Yet we left with vastly different percep
tions of Chinese culture and society.
I once thought that education and travel
were enough to combat cultural stereo
types and rash assumptions. But it only
works when one approaches such an expe
rience with a receptive mindset.
I was too naive; a person can travel
around the world and still learn little. A
traveler can see what he or she wants to see

and leave with only strengthened preju
dices.
1 am disappointed by this realization. At
the same time, 1 am impressed by the
capacity the human mind has to learn when
it chooses to do so.
Another classmate had lived in Taiwan
lor a year before enrolling in this program.
He moved there not knowing any Chinese.
By the time he left, he had learned enough
C hinese to read the newspapers and con
verse extensively in Mandarin.
An experience is nothing in and of itself;
it is all in the approach.
Whether a person works for a large law
firm or a non-profit organization is a paltry

indicator of the strength
of one's ideological stand
ing.
What counts is the
quality of mind and inten
tions devoted to the expe
rience.

I let another
train pass by

before 1 got
oil the bench,
this time mak
ing sure to
head in the
right direction.

I had decided
it was time to go
home to nurse
my lever; deliri

um doesn't serve anyone
well in a subway sta
tion.
I entered the air- a
conditioned car.

beginning to get bored with niy prolonged
solitude.
Please mind the platform gap.

myself, exploring cities, sampling Asian
delicacies and learning to appreciate my
own company. On the whole, it's been
good.
Yet 1 often yearn to be in the company
of people I've known longer than two
months.

1 need them to help me keep perspec
tive, because introspection can become a
dangerous thing. It's difficult to control and
can evolve into a parasite that feeds on
your confidence and distorts your perspec
tive.
It touches off a cycle of questions and
self-doubts. And if no one else is around to
straighten you out, only you can talk your
self out of it.
It has been a little difficult teaching
myself to talk myself out of these cycles.
Thousands of miles away from friends, 1
can only claim a "virtual presence" in their
lives.
I send little bits of electronic data over
seas, telling about the
latest news in tleef@stanford.edu's life.
Sometimes lchyu@stanford.edu writes
back.
Life goes on for my friends without me.
And that is how it should be.
As simple as it is, it took me a while to
realize that we're all alone to a certain
extent, living out our individual lives. We
live out our own realities, sometimes shar
ing the experiences with each other and
sometimes not.
I am reminded that this is what makes
experience so subjective. Since beginning
this overseas program, I have sat through
countless lectures, listening to American
classmates (long indoctrinated with anti-
Communist, history book propaganda) ask
quasi-rhetorical questions, seeking evi
dence of Communist oppression of the Chi
nese people.
"So during the Great Leap Forward,
Mao basically just took all the metal away
from the Chinese people?" the inquiring

mind wanted to know.
"1 just don't understand how any Chi
nese person could still respect Mao," he
added, in reference to the Mao portraits
that proliferate many Chinese homes. "It
must be all the propaganda. They're just
ignorant of what really happened."
Thank you, sir. for your overreaching
assessment of the 1.2 billion Chinese popu
lation.
Never mind the fact that Mao was key in
ridding China of the imperialist maggots
that had fed on it for decades. Mao allowed
the Chinese people "to stand up."
He allowed them to be proud of them
selves as a people and a nation after years
of humiliating foreign intrusion. For a
while, anyway.
In short, there is good reason why an
educated Chinese person could possibly
appreciate Mat). As there are many reasons
why they would choose not to.
But assigning ignorance to 1.2 billion
people after having a month of Chinese his
tory lessons is unacceptable.
This classmate and 1 began this same
program in late August. We traveled
through mainland China together, visited
the same peasant village and saw the same
capitalist vendors on the Beijing streets.
Yet we left with vastly different percep
tions of Chinese culture and society.
I once thought that education and travel
were enough to combat cultural stereo
types and rash assumptions. But it only
works when one approaches such an expe
rience with a receptive mindset.
I was too naive; a person can travel
around the world and still learn little. A
traveler can see what he or she wants to see

and leave with only strengthened preju
dices.
1 am disappointed by this realization. At
the same time, 1 am impressed by the
capacity the human mind has to learn when
it chooses to do so.
Another classmate had lived in Taiwan
lor a year before enrolling in this program.
He moved there not knowing any Chinese.
By the time he left, he had learned enough
C hinese to read the newspapers and con
verse extensively in Mandarin.
An experience is nothing in and of itself;
it is all in the approach.
Whether a person works for a large law
firm or a non-profit organization is a paltry

indicator of the strength
of one's ideological stand
ing.
What counts is the
quality of mind and inten
tions devoted to the expe
rience.

I let another
train pass by

before 1 got
oil the bench,
this time mak
ing sure to
head in the
right direction.

I had decided
it was time to go
home to nurse
my lever; deliri

um doesn't serve anyone
well in a subway sta
tion.
I entered the air- a
conditioned car.

beginning to get bored with niy prolonged
solitude.
Please mind the platform gap.
