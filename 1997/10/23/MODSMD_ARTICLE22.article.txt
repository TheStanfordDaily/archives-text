## Moos is a hoops gazelle 
### 
The name naturally makes one
think of some big-boned be
hemoth ready to terrorize
the paint, swatting shots and tearing
down rebounds.
Her height (6-feet-6)only further
establishes that notion. She enters
the Stanford women's basketball
program as the second-tallest player
in its history.
Then you see freshman forward
Carolyn Moos out on the practice
court in Maples Pavilion and do a
double-take. The Wayzata, Minn.,
native is a gazelle who can swiftly
run up and down the court and is not
afraid to take her defender out on
the perimeter, having shot 50 per
cent from three-point land in high
school.

Because basketball practice only
officially opened last Saturday and
the first exhibition game is still three
weeks away, one can only imagine
what the future holds for this tall
wonder.
"I am 6-6. but I see myself as a
versatile 6-6," said Moos on the eve
of her first practice. "I can play a
[small forward, power forward or
center]. I see myself as playing
[power forward] the most, but then
again, if we have two big players, 1
can go to a [small forward posi
tion]."
"I'm the type of player who
doesn't feel uncomfortable stepping
outside and passing the ball around,
so I think that'll help me to be able to
do that."
Sitting in front of Roble Hall on a
warm Friday afternoon. Moos
seems at ease for a person who's
about to become part of a program
the caliber of Stanford's.
Maybe it's because there are
other things to worry about as a
Stanford freshman. Or maybe it's
because the rigorous preseason con
ditioning program the team under
went is nothing new to Moos. For
the past two years, she was a mem
ber of the United States Junior Na
tional Team, a stint that culminated
in a first-place finish at the World
Championships in Brazil this sum
mer. (How was your summer vaca
tion?)
"It was really intense," Moos
said. "It was a lot of work, and I
think it helped prepare me as far as
[Division I coaches were con
cerned]. They expected a lot. and
they pushed us hard in practice. It
was a really good experience.
"I think the junior national team
was a good step toward college. It's
just a lot faster, a lot stronger, a lot
harder, and you can never slack."
Playing in Brazil was also quite
an experience in terms of the rau
cous crowds that came to watch the
team play.
" When we were in Brazil, the en
tire culture was there, and they are
so proud of Brazil." Moos said.
"That place was booming. It's funny
because as soon as they found out
Brazil wasn't going to play us. they
supported us. Prior to that, they as
sumed it was going to be Brazil and
USA in the finals, so they were to
tally against us. Once we played
Australia (in the finals), they loved
us."
Moos' interest in sports extend
beyond the basketball court. Consis
tently growing "two or three inches"
since her childhood. Moos played
and tried just about everything from
skiing to equestrian before settling
into track, basketball and volleyball
at the Blake School, a 40()-student
high sch(X)l in Wayzata.
"I think being involved in sports


Ed
Guzman
ever since i was little really helped
t(H), because I \v;is constantly doing
physical activities while I was grow
ing, which helped vvihi iii\ cooidina
tion," Moos said.
Concentrating on basketball alter
one year of volleyball. Moos aver
aged more than 17 points and 12 re
bounds per game in high school
while earning spots on several All
America teams. ( ol leges were notic
ing, and she had an important deci
sion to make.
"As far as academics are con
cerned, it's hard to find a school
that's on par with Stanford. 1 was
(also) looking at Vanderbilt, and as
far as basketball goer-, I was looking
at Tennessee. I J( onn. Pcnn State,
Georgia, some of the bigger
schools." Moos said. "Hut I like Stan
ford in that it is [ I )i\ ision 11. and it's
the most challenging both academ
ically and athletically, so I think it's

the best fit for me."
(ioing to a school two time /ones
away and more than 10 times as big
as Wake sounds nerve wracking, but
to Moos it was quite refreshing.
"I think it's a change, but I think it
tits in\ personality better." she said.
"It's a lot more diverse I've had no
problems getting used to it; it was al
most like a treat having all these kids
around."
Si* she's fitting in quite nicely on
the Farm, or as nicely as a (i-(i person
can. Hut there's that student athlete
thing that she has to live up to. and so
fai. the basketball side has been fine,
especially with the coaching staff.
"One thing 1 really like about
them is they're very honest. You ask
them 'What do you see me doing this
year?" and they'll be straightforward.
" They'll say to me Well, you are
6-(i. but you have to use your versatil
ity" because at this point, I'm strong
but I'm not a 5. I'm not a girl that's
just going to go in there and bang
around.. . . I just like the way that
they tell von what you can do best.

and then they help you with the
things you need to work on."
With 12 returning players and
four fresh faces, it sounds like the
IW7-98 edition of coach I'ara N an
Derveer's team is ready to use the
bitter disappointment of last year's
Final Four's loss ;| S a springboard for
an exciting season.
"I think it's going to be a totally
different team than it has been in the
past.' Moos said. "But I think we
have great chemistry so far. The team
gets along so well, and that's really
important in the success as a team.
"Personally 1 just want to be able
to contribute on the floor and be a
leader from the freshman stand
point. We have four great senior
leaders, which is key. They're the
basis for motivation and for keeping
the team going, and they are already
doing that. 1 just want to be a part of
it and no to the Final Four."

The name naturally makes one
think of some big-boned be
hemoth ready to terrorize
the paint, swatting shots and tearing
down rebounds.
Her height (6-feet-6)only further
establishes that notion. She enters
the Stanford women's basketball
program as the second-tallest player
in its history.
Then you see freshman forward
Carolyn Moos out on the practice
court in Maples Pavilion and do a
double-take. The Wayzata, Minn.,
native is a gazelle who can swiftly
run up and down the court and is not
afraid to take her defender out on
the perimeter, having shot 50 per
cent from three-point land in high
school.

Because basketball practice only
officially opened last Saturday and
the first exhibition game is still three
weeks away, one can only imagine
what the future holds for this tall
wonder.
"I am 6-6. but I see myself as a
versatile 6-6," said Moos on the eve
of her first practice. "I can play a
[small forward, power forward or
center]. I see myself as playing
[power forward] the most, but then
again, if we have two big players, 1
can go to a [small forward posi
tion]."
"I'm the type of player who
doesn't feel uncomfortable stepping
outside and passing the ball around,
so I think that'll help me to be able to
do that."
Sitting in front of Roble Hall on a
warm Friday afternoon. Moos
seems at ease for a person who's
about to become part of a program
the caliber of Stanford's.
Maybe it's because there are
other things to worry about as a
Stanford freshman. Or maybe it's
because the rigorous preseason con
ditioning program the team under
went is nothing new to Moos. For
the past two years, she was a mem
ber of the United States Junior Na
tional Team, a stint that culminated
in a first-place finish at the World
Championships in Brazil this sum
mer. (How was your summer vaca
tion?)
"It was really intense," Moos
said. "It was a lot of work, and I
think it helped prepare me as far as
[Division I coaches were con
cerned]. They expected a lot. and
they pushed us hard in practice. It
was a really good experience.
"I think the junior national team
was a good step toward college. It's
just a lot faster, a lot stronger, a lot
harder, and you can never slack."
Playing in Brazil was also quite
an experience in terms of the rau
cous crowds that came to watch the
team play.
" When we were in Brazil, the en
tire culture was there, and they are
so proud of Brazil." Moos said.
"That place was booming. It's funny
because as soon as they found out
Brazil wasn't going to play us. they
supported us. Prior to that, they as
sumed it was going to be Brazil and
USA in the finals, so they were to
tally against us. Once we played
Australia (in the finals), they loved
us."
Moos' interest in sports extend
beyond the basketball court. Consis
tently growing "two or three inches"
since her childhood. Moos played
and tried just about everything from
skiing to equestrian before settling
into track, basketball and volleyball
at the Blake School, a 40()-student
high sch(X)l in Wayzata.
