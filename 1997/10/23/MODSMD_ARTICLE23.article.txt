# Gregory stands tall on court
## Sophomore outside hitter makes the most of her 5-foot-8 frame 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Just looking at the starting rotation of
the fourth-ranked Stanford women's vol
leyball team, you probably wouldn't be
able to pick out the Cardinal's third outside
hitter.
Even when the first ball is served into
play, you're more likely to spot Jaimi ( ire
gory making a spectacular diving play or
leaping over the bench to chase a ball than
going up for the kill. Hut that's not to say
the 5-foot-K sophomore doesn't bring a
whole new dimension to the outside hitter
position.
"I like being a 5-8 outside hitter," (ire
gory said. "It's fun. My parents have always
told me, 'Jaimi. it's not how tall you are, it's
how tall you play.' 1 think I can give our
team something. It may not be my height,
but it might be something else that 1 have."
From everything her coaches and team
mates have to say. Gregory not only works
hard to get the job done, but she does it with
the kind of eagerness that's contagious.
"Jaimi brings a lot of enthusiasm and a
great competitive attitude," said head
coach Don Shaw. "She's out to prove that
somebody her si/e can play at this level. She
plays the game the way coaches want a
player to plav."
Maybe that's because she's been playing
the game all her life. Gregory grew up in
what she describes as a "volleyball family."
Both her parents played in college, and her
father, Gerald, was a teammate of Shaw's
on the U.S. National Team from 1978-79.
"I was basically a gym rat," Gregory
said. "1 begged people to play with me. I
was pretty annoying."

Gregory also got the opportunity to be
around the college game early on when her
father coached at Oregon from 1986-94.
She said she grew up watching the team and
even tagging along, an experience that no
doubt taught Gregory a lot.

In three years at Sheldon I ligh School in
Eugene, ()re., Gregory had a successful ca
reer and was even named ()rcgon Player of
the Year as a junior. Hut her father got a job
coaching at Long Heach Wilson in West
minster, Calif., and the Gregory family
moved just before Jaimi's senior year.
"It was really hard because 1 didn't
know anyone, and it was my senior year,"
Gregory said. "Hut when I look back on it.
I think it was a good experience. Moving
taught me a lot about being independent. I
was really forced to grow up more."
After playing under her father as a sc
nior and earning Mizuno first team All
America honors, Gregory came iodic harm
to start her collegiate career. Shaw said a lot
of schools overlooked Gregory because of
her height, thinking she'd only be valuable
as a back-row specialist. Hut Shaw took the
chance and picked up one of the hardest
working players in the conference.
Last year she received I lonorable Men
tion honors on the Pacific 10 Conference
All-Freshman ream and was fourth on the
team in digs as Stanford won its third na

tional championship in five years.
"It was the most amazing experience,"
Gregory said of winning the title. "It was
just so ama/ing to he part of a team. We
worked tor one goal, and we achieved it. I
like every one of my teammates, and I have
a lot of fun with them."
I his season Gregory is leading the
squad in digs, in addition to earning a start
ing outside hitter position despite being
one of the shortest players on the team.
As a small hitter, "you have to think a lot
more," Gregory said. "You have to know
what defense the other team is in probably
more than the average person, and you
have to be a little more slimy. Hut I like
that."
When she's not being slimy in an at
tempt to outwit the opponent's defense,
she's displaying some pretty incredible "D"
of her own. And that's something her team
mates and coaches credit to her acrobatic
ability and her workhorse mentality.
"She's an extremely hard worker," said
senior co-captain setter Lisa Sharpley.
"She brings an entirely new level to the
team defensively. A lot of the things she
does go unnoticed. Other people will just
get the ball up, but she gets it to the spot and
makes the transition easy."
Not being one to give herself too much
credit, Gregory says she still needs to im
prove on her game. She hopes to continue
her volleyball career after Stanford, and
her desire to constantly improve on the
court is what Shaw says has contributed to
her success.
"1 just basically try to do anything 1 pos
siblv can (o get the ball," Gregory said.

Sophomore Jaimi Gregory earned a starting out
side hitter position for the fourth-ranked Cardinal
and now leads the team in digs.
"Sometimes I'm not the most grace
tHI at it. Sometimes I run into things
or hurt myself, but it |iisi hurts me so
bad to see the ball drop, so I do an\
thing 1 can to keep the ball from
falling."
(iregorx will continue making
those diving plays that Maples ma
niacs go nuts over and plugging
away as the shortest outside hitlei
around. And she's intent on seeing
the Cardinal repeat as national
champion.
"We've never won two national
championships in a row. and I reall\
want to change that," Gregory said
"1 know we have a great chance at it.
But it's also one ol those things
where there are five other great
teams, and everyone wants to win
the national championship. I know
it's going to be a hard thing to ac
complish. but I think we're up for
the challenge."
