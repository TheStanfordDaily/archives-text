One morning last June. Stan
ford senior pitcher Kyle Peterson
was jolted out of deep sleep b\ a
phone ringing in his hotel room at
the ()maha Marriott.
It was the Milwaukee Brewers,
calling a few hours before major
league baseball's amateur draft.
"They told me that if I was still
around at the 13th pick in the first
round, they would take me." Peter
son said in a press conference later
that day.
He was. And they did. And his

life was never the same.
Meanwhile, Stanford was busy
at the College World Series. The
Cardinal staved off elimination
that afternoon hv beating Auburn
11-4 behind a strong outing by
sophomore reliever Jeff Austin.
Hut it was Peterson who got
most of the attention.
"'lt was tough with all the excite
ment." said the Omaha native.
"()nee I got on the field, I was able
to |iut it aside. But off the field,
with the draft and being at home
and the media coverage.... You
throw all those things together and
you get one crazy trip."
Three other members of the
Cardinal junior catcher Jon
Schaeffer. senior outfielder Chris
Clark and senior first baseman
Luke Ouaccia were taken in the
draft, lint Peterson was the only
one taken in the first round.
A loss to eventual champion
Louisiana State in the World Series
spelled the end of Stanford's cham
pionship hopes, but Peterson's
journey was just beginning.
I he next step with the Brewers
was to negotiate a contract, which
was finalized in the middle of July.
Following a workout with the
team. Peterson finally got his first
assignment.
What Peterson first noticed on
stepping into the Ogden Raptors
clubhouse was that this wasn't
school anymore.
"There were a lot of differences
from college ball." he said. "Very
fast, it became rather apparent that
this was a job.
"Typically, we might have a
game somewhere at seven at night.
We would get on the bus to go
home at midnight, arrive at six in
the morning and then have to come

back out to the ballpark a few
hours later for a four o'clock
game."
Peterson's experience with the
team was a typical minor-league
one: long bus trips, cheap hotels,
and $15 a day in meal money.
"Once we had a 17-hour bus trip
to play a team in (anada and
that was just one way." he said. "It
made me realize how lucky I was to
play at Stanford. We flew on planes
and stayed in nice hotels. It's dil
ferent when I travel now."
Despite the grueling experi
ence, Peterson blew through the
rookie leagues in four outings,
pitching 10 I/3 inning notching
11 strikeouts and allowing only one
earned run for a 0.H7 LRA. the
lowest on the team.
"The level of play was definitely
a step down from Stanford," he
said.
At the end of the season, the
Brewers called Peterson up to the
Stockton Ports, a single-A team in
the California League. The Ports
were in the playoffs, and Peterson
was scheduled to pitch the fourth
game.

"But the team was eliminated in
three games," he said.
Peterson hopes to get the
chance to face big-league hitters in
fewer than four months when he
travels to Arizona for spring train
ing. From there, he will be as
signed to a minor-league team, ei
ther the Ports or the AA LI Paso
I )iablos.
Until then. Peterson will be on
campus, working toward a degree
in communication. But being on
campus isn't the same this year for
Peterson. For the first time, he's
not playing baseball.
"Usually, every afternoon, I
would go down to the field for
baseball practice from 12:30 or one
until four or five," he said "That's
all I've known. It's weird to have so
much time.
"I've played more than my
share ol golf," Peterson chuckled.
"I'm not saying that I'm using the
time wisely."
Between tee times, Peterson
will be spending two quarters
working toward his degree re
quirements.
And dreaming about the spring.
