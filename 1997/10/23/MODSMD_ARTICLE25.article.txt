DAY: The All-American Champi
onships in Pacific Palisades, Calif.

Representing the defending na
tional champion Cardinal will be
Stanford seniors Julie Scott and
Ania Bles/ynski and sophomore
I'cryn Ashley. I lie last time these
three players were on the court for
the Cardinal, they were receiving
their championship trophies.
"Hopefully, we will pick up right
where we left off," Bles/ynski said.
"'I his tournament is early for our
season, but we definitely want to get
off to a good start. - '
Scott comes into the tournament
with a No. 5 national ranking,due in
large part to last season's late suc
cess in both the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships and the
NCAA Tournament. Scott stole
the Pac-10 singles crown last year,
upending three top seeds in the
process. Scott also turned heads by
reaching the semifinals of the
NCAA Singles Championships at
Stanford and going undefeated in
the ( ardinal's team title run.
Because ol her lofty national
ranking, Scott earned the No. 4 seed
in the tournament, which begins
this morning. Scott faces San I )iego
sophomore /.u/ana l.esenarova in
the first round, l.esenarova. a na
tive of the Czech Republic, is
ranked No. 13 in the country in sin
gles.
Scott was the only ( ardinal play
er who received an automatic berth
into the singles draw. Both Ashley
and Bleszynski entered the qualify
ing draw earlier this week. Ashley
found her way into the main draw by
taking the qualifying title in a 6-2,3-
6, 7-6 (0) victory over Georgia's
Aarthi Venkatesan.
As a freshman last year, Ashley
went undefeated in dual-match play,
posting a 20-0 record primarily at
the No. 6 singles spot.
Ashlev will face Pac-10 foe Eliza
beth Schmidt, a UCLA sophomore
with a No. 2X national ranking.
Bleszynski's first-round loss in
qualifying play took her out of con
tention for the main draw, but the
Cardinal senior bounced back and
advanced to the consolation final.
Bles/ynski will still see action in
the doubles draw, where she and
Scott earned not only an automatic
berth hut also a No. 2 seed. The Car
dinal tandem will face William and
Mary's Lauren Nicklaus and
Michelle () in today's opening
round. Nicklaus and () are No. 14 in
the nation in doubles.
"Julie and I played together last
year." Bleszynski said. "So we won't
have to worry about getting familiar
with each other during these first
few tournaments."
Last year, Scott and Bleszynski
competedat the top doubles spot for
Stanford, compiling a 16 4 record.
I lie Cardinal duo advanced to the
semifinals ol the NCAA doubles
draw before beinu eliminated.
