## Renovations hit Escondido 
### Sims Ely 
The University continues to improve Escondido Vil
lage after it began a remodeling program several years
ago to more systematically address the concerns of resi
dents.
The remodeling project, which is part of the campus
wide Capital Improvement Program, is focused on a
total renovation of the old apartment buildings in Es
condido.
The project was begun in March 1993, and since then,
more than half of the 1.3(H) Escondido apartments have
undergone extensive renovation. "Hie goal is to com
plete the renovations by the year 2(X)<>.
"The progress of the ('II' renovations in [Escondido]
is moving along very well, and on target," said Rodger
Whitney, associate director of I lousing and Dining Ser
vices for Student I lousing.
The University has already completed exterior paint
ing of the high-rise buildings in Escondido. I ast summer,
Abrams, a mid-rise apartment building, and 11 low-rise
buildings had their exteriors revamped. The I 'diversity
also plans to complete exterior painting of 26 more low
rise buildings by the end of 199 K.
Landscaping plans have been implemented and more
are scheduled. Next summer landscaping efforts will be
devoted to the area around Barnes, another Escondido
residence. In subsequent years, all of Escondido will be
scheduled for landscape improvements. According to
Whitney, landscape improvements will be completed by
2(M)2. which will signify the completion of all ( ll' reno

vation in Escondido.
The Escondido renovations are part of the larger ( IF
strategy to remodel student housing across campus.
Working with housing services is the Graduate Hous
ing Advisory Committee composed of five student
members. I he committee has not yet met this year but
plans its first meeting sometime in mid-November.
"(iraduate students are often faced with pretty bleak
options: an engineering dorm, a law dorm and some lar
llung apartments with limited social interactions, said
Regina Nu/.zo. a statistics doctoral student and member
of the committee.
Escondido seems to be an attractive option tor many
graduate students. "For the price, it is better than one
can expect to find on the open market around here," said
education doctoral student Beth Scarloss, another com
mittee member.
I lowever, not all students feel so positive about their
Escondido living conditions. Although many, it not most
of the Escondido apartments have been renovated,
some have yet to be refurbished by the University.
"We've been having pretty serious structural prob
lems since we've moved in. I hey're doing what they can.
but they really need to remodel this place," said Jim Fin
sten, a coterminal student in International Policy Stud
ies. "When you shower, it rains in the living room."
"My main complaint is the lighting." said C lark Bray,
a doctoral student in mathematics, who has lived in grad
uate housing for several years. "The light that we're
given is pathetic. Other than that, the renovated Escon
dido apartments are pretty decent."
