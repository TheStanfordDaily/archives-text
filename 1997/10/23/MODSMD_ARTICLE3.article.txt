# Surgery Dept. asks for change
## Communication problems to be settled 
### Megan Fuller-Deets 
Six months after 4N of them pub
licly presented I Jniversity President
Gerhard Casper with a detailed list
of grievances, many members of the
Department of Surgery are still feel
ing frustrated and ignored.
I lie 4N students presented
Casper with a letter last year at a
"Tea and Cookies" question-and
ansvver session. It complained
about the lack ot leadership, fund
ing and resources in the depart
ment.
Although the I )ean of the School
of Medicine h;is started efforts to
remedy the situation, many in the
department remain very unsatisfied
with the situation.
"We're working in a total void o!
information," said Augusto liasti
ilas. an assistant professor of gas
trointestinal surgery. "We'd like to
eet a clear signal from the dean's of

lice as to what they would like the
structure and philosophy of the de
partment to be."
In response to the initial com
plaint. Dean of the Medical School
Hugene Bauer ordered an external
review of the department and
formed a search committee to find a
new department chair.
I he review was performed by
three well known academic sur
geons from other universities. The
review members spent a day and a
half talking to members of the de
partment and the dean's office
about the current state of the de
partment. I he report was sent lo the
(.lean's office three weeks ago but no
one in the department or the search
committee has seen it, according to
Hastidas.
