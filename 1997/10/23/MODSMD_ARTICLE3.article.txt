# Surgery Dept. asks for change
## Communication problems to be settled 
### Megan Fuller-Deets 
Six months after 4N of them pub
licly presented I Jniversity President
Gerhard Casper with a detailed list
of grievances, many members of the
Department of Surgery are still feel
ing frustrated and ignored.
I lie 4N students presented
Casper with a letter last year at a
"Tea and Cookies" question-and
ansvver session. It complained
about the lack ot leadership, fund
ing and resources in the depart
ment.
Although the I )ean of the School
of Medicine h;is started efforts to
remedy the situation, many in the
department remain very unsatisfied
with the situation.
"We're working in a total void o!
information," said Augusto liasti
ilas. an assistant professor of gas
trointestinal surgery. "We'd like to
eet a clear signal from the dean's of

lice as to what they would like the
structure and philosophy of the de
partment to be."
In response to the initial com
plaint. Dean of the Medical School
Hugene Bauer ordered an external
review of the department and
formed a search committee to find a
new department chair.
I he review was performed by
three well known academic sur
geons from other universities. The
review members spent a day and a
half talking to members of the de
partment and the dean's office
about the current state of the de
partment. I he report was sent lo the
(.lean's office three weeks ago but no
one in the department or the search
committee has seen it, according to
Hastidas.
I'eter (iregory, Stanford llospi
tal's Chief Medical Officer and a
member of the committee, said the
report is still in draft form and await
ing finalization by the review mem
bers.
Both residents and staff s;iid
they've been told the same thing but
do not believe it to be true.
"We're hoping the report will
vindicate what we've said," ex
plained George Yang, the resident
who presented the letter to ( asper.
"We'd like to see the dean's office
reveal the results of the review and
act on it."
The dean's office could not be
reached for comment.
The progress of the search com
mittee, headed by the chair of the
Department of Medicine, Judith
Swain, seems to be generating equal
tension.
"We're frustrated that the search
hasn't progressed at the pace we had
been promised," Bastidas said.
According to Bastidas, the com
mittee should have already had a
concrete list of candidates by now.
I he department's acting head
Bruce Reitz, a professor of eardio
thoracic surgery who also heads that
department, said that the current
situation means that he is constantly
busv.

"As the acting chairman I have
adequate resources to do what is
necessary but further expansion will
require additional resources, and
that is waiting on a chairman," he
said.
A permanent chair is necessary,
Bastidas explained, in order to re
tain current faculty, recruit new fac
ulty and distribute the resources of
the department effectively so the
department can continue to func
tion and expand.
Many students are also con
cerned with the perceived lack of
progress but some remain hopeful
that things may change. "We've ac
cepted in good faith the word of the
dean that they're moving quickly on
this," said Yang.
Swain said only that the search is
currently progressing and that she
believes it is being handled well.
Gregory explained that the search
t;ikes a great deal of time to compile,
based on the need to assemble a re
source package that will entice
someone suitable. "We're looking
for someone who will bring this tic -
partment into the first rank of acad
emic departments in the country,"
he said. "That takes time."
Although this goal seems to be
shared by many in the department,
some remain skeptical of the moti
vation of the dean's office. Bastidas
said he believes there is a general

perception within the department
that the dean's office wants its
members to he no more than sur
geons and operate as much as pos
sible. I his generates more revenue
for the hospital but is incompatible
with furthering a national career as
an academic surgeon, Bastidas
said.
"We are looking for someone
who will lead, teach and guide us in
our careers. We want to be the best
academic surgeons that we can."
said Kasper Wang, a resident in the
department. "Our concern is that
the administration is not interested
in that and wants us to become tech
nicians."
The delay in the search and the
uncertain nature of the depart
ment's philosophy may also be
detrimental to the future of the de
partment itself. Bastidas comment
ed. "The current delay in the search
has led to instability in the depart
ment which may lead to additional
loss of faculty," he added.
The department seems united in
its desire for increased communica
tion. Bastidas complained that the
department faculty has had no di
rect communication from the dean's
office since the end of the last acad
emic year.
" The Medical Center has more
or less placed us in limbo," Yang
concurred.
