# Woolfolk living a dream for No. 4 Cardinal
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Two years ago, Corey Woolfolk
attended the men's soccer Final
Four, hut he never thought he'd
have a chance to participate.
Now, as a freshman on the Car
dinal soccer team, Woolfolk, a for
ward. has helped his team to a No. 4
national ranking, a division title and
its best shot ever at the NCAA
Tournament.
Woolfolk arrived at the Farm
from Pioneer High School in Ann
Arbor, Mich., where he earned
recognition as the 1997 Michigan
Mr. Soccer, an NSCAA All-Ameri
can and the Gatorade state and re
gional Player of the Year.
The high school star has had little
trouble making the adjustment to
college play, chalking up three goals
and four assists for the Cardinal
while seeing significant playing
time.
A fast runner who often outraces
opponents to the ball, Woolfolk
said the biggest difference he's no
ticed is that now he has to think fast,
too.
College soccer is "so much
faster, it's not even funny," he said.
"It was a real shock at first. Now I'm
starting to get used to it."
Stanford head coach Bobby
( lark, who Woolfolk said has acted
as a father figure in his cross-coun
try move, of fered the best advice.
The advice had two parts, Wool
folk explained: "Go out and have
fun. And you can't run KM) miles an
hour — you have to think KM) miles
an hour first."
Clark and Woolfolk have quick
ly established a rapport that charac
terizes the team and the coach's
style. Pre-game dinners and sup
portive talks have made the transi
tion to college easy, Woolfolk said.
"You automatically believe in
him," Woolfolk said of Clark. "I le's
a really great person on and off the
field. He'll do anything for your
well-being."
("lark said his recruit was easy to
get to like, too. Woolfolk initiated
discussions about a career at Stan

ford by calling the coach.
"He was such a personable, intel
ligent person on the telephone,"
said Clark, who followed up by call
ing coaches he knew in the Midwest.
One of those coaches sold Clark
on Woolfolk by saying, "If I had one
scholarship to give Corey, I would
give him it. If I had two, I'd give him
both."
The freshman is "a great ath
lete," Clark said. " The two things
he's got going for him are he's got a
great attitude and he's a great ath
lete."
That attitude hasn't been damp
ened by the team's unprecedented
success this season en route to an
11-0-2 record (3-0-1 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation).
In looking at schools, Woolfolk
said, he wanted to play competitive
soccer but didn't expect to be on a
top-five team.
"If you had told me this time last
year I'd be playing for the No. 4
team in the country," he said. "I
wouldn't have believed you."
Each game means more than
high school games meant, and as the
Cardinal climbs in the rankings, the
pressure is intensified.
Back when games were just for
fun, Woolfolk was a first-grader
eager to get onto the soccer field be
cause his older brother was on the
team. His original interest was in
goalkeeping because he always
liked positions that involved more
equipment. In baseball, his chosen
position was catcher.
Hut soccer won in the end. Wool
folk said he likes the constant action
and the skill required to maneuver
the ball.
"Making the ball do what you
want without your hands is pretty
amazing," he said.
I lis career after Stanford is as un
certain as his major at this point,
Woolfolk said. About all he's decid
ed is that he likes working with peo
ple — and he doesn't like CIV.
Most people want to have time
to explore when they get to Stan
ford, which is why freshmen often
don't see as much playing time as
Woolfolk has, Clark said.

"I don't rush freshmen because
... it's nice lor players to grow dur
ing their four years." Clark said. "It
makes the whole college experience
so much more enjoyable."
What would be most enjoyable
for Wool folk is a national champi

unship in Richmond, Va., in De
cember. His can-do attitude reflects
the positive outlook of his coach.
"If we just keep playing the way
we know how to play," Woolfolk
said, "I don't think anything can
stop us."
