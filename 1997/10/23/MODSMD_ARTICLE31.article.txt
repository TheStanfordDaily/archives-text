The Stanford men's soccer team
has already claimed its division title,
but this weekend's non-conference
matches remain important in the
players' quest for a bid to the NCAA
Tournament.

MEN'S SOCCER
■ TODAY: No. 4 Stanford (11-0-2,3-
0-1) vs. St. Mary's (5-5-2) at New Mal
oney Field, 4 p.m.
■ SUNDAY: Stanford vs. Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo at New Maloney
Field, 2 p.m.

The Cardinal (11-0-2, 3-0-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
starts off today at 4 p.m. against the
St. Mary's Gaels (5-5-2, 0-2 West
Coast Conference) at New Maloney
Field, then meets Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo on Sunday at 2 p.m.
Stanford won the St. Mary's
Tournament in September, defeat
ing Wisconsin and UC-Irvine, but
has not yet met the Gaels, who also
won both their tournament games.
St. Mary's is a "vastly different
team from last year," when the Gaels
finished 6-12-1, said Stanford head
coach Bobby Clark. He predicted
"one of the hardest middle-of-the
week games you could get."
The Cardinal certainly can't af
ford to relax.
"We've got to be very careful,"
Clark said. "We could get hurt if we
try to look past it."
The top-five ranking increases
pressure on the team, he said, be
cause "the higher you come, the
quicker you tumble back down.
"The exciting thing about once
you get into high positions is that
every game becomes meaningful.
There's not a game we're going to
play from now to the end of the sea
son that's not going to mean a lot to
the players."
