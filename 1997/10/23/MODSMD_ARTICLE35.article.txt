## ALTARING TRADITION Barbara Galuszka-Parsons' Digital Photography 
### Meredith Alexander 
In societies all over the world, a primal conflict arises
when machine meets mantra. Ever since agents of "sci
entific progress" started disseminating their ideas and
imposing their mechanical know-how on others, tradi
tional religions have bucked against technology.
But even in the progress-minded West, groups who
like their old ways have been known to throw wrenches
into the machines, as the Amish persist in doing. This
conflict has led most people, however, to separate the
two as much as possible: church and western science
don't mix, even if your church is a temple or a mosque.
Artist Barbara Galuszka-Parsons, however, has a dif
ferent idea. Her current display of digital photographs,
called "The Altar Series," makes a full-color plea to
knock down this barrier.
The works, on display in the Center for Integrated
Systems (and also on view at the Gates Building, the
Terman Engineering Building and the Humanities and
Science Building), are an innovative attempt to unite the
images of traditional faiths with a sophisticated techno
logical method. And although her photographs raise
important questions about the nature of belief and rep
resentations of that belief, this wedding ultimately
proves a somewhat unholy one.
The photos depict a series of "altars" dedicated to a
huge range of mythic beings. The technology used is as
new as the myths that are explored in these photos are
old. As Galuszka-Parsons writes in her artist's statement,
"High-resolution digital capture now can be paired with
filmless digital output as Cibachromes, which are
known for their intense color saturation and archival
stability. The Altar Series manifests this hyper-real detail
together with seamless computer manipulation for
image integrity."
Although they only exist as 'Cibachromes' in some
computer disk's memory, the photos appear extraordi
narily life-like, aside from their loss of depth. The images
in these photos look color-enhanced, and the first thing
the viewer notices is the remarkably flat and bright ap
pearance of the surfaces. The medium itself is very dif
ferent from normal photography, and words can't de
scribe the intensity of the colors.
Some of Galuszka-Parsons' altars are more recogniz
able than others: plates of uneaten food await the gods,
surrounded by candles. But a variety of small icons and
religious symbols clutter the landscape. Postcards and
two-dimensional elements crowd the background,
ranging from Greek Orthodox iconic Saint Georges to
Tarot cards to photos of Buddhist monks to people
walking through Versailles' gardens.
Many objects create a variety of focal points on the al
tars, although they serve as often to focus, as to distract:
plastic crucifixes that look like they might glow in the
dark, plaster Madonnas, boots and exotic slippers,
carved wooden animals, puppets, dolls, animal parts
and Japanese masks.
But above all the food looks enticing. (One may just
become very hungry while viewing this exhibit. Caveat
viewer!) In bowls and on ceramic dishes lie piles of rice,
unusual vegetables, fruits like coconuts and massive
green bananas, nuts and seeds. Galuszka-Parsons said
that she found inspiration in her travels to Latin Amer
ica, Asia and Central Europe, and we can certainly find

the material evidence here.
The artist also said that "each altar was carefully re
searched, and objects accurately placed, often with spe
cific reference to the anthropological as well as to the
personal." Indigenous items from many settings (from
Southeast Asia to Celtic Britain to modern America)
look carefully arranged.
But one wonders how "anthropological" these choic
es were. For example, in the piece "Po Ino Nogar," built
around the myth of the Cambodian rice god, plates of
rice are garnished with a Coca-Cola can. Such an object
could arguably be said to represent our own culture's at
tachment to symbols and signs. Many people would
rather buy Coke than some house brand, if only because
of the iconic nature of its trademark can.
But when attempting to claim authenticity, how does
a Coke can fit into an anthropologically correct altar of
a Cambodian rice god? If the artist had a different vision
of her role — as a postmodern collector of random im
ages, for example — these images might be easier to ac
cept.
Indeed, the artist's commentaries that describe her
work, displayed like captions next to the photographs,
add to the confusion. The captions and statements very
seriously describe, in detail, the roles and attributes of
the gods. She leaves little room for interpreting the ob
jects on display, and by presenting only strictly mythical
interpretations in her commentaries, Galuszka-Parsons

detracts from the innovation of her work. Where is the
personal?
One or two pieces, on the other hand, are very direct
ly representational: Demeter, for one, seems very accu
rately portrayed with vegetables and plants, because she
is the earth goddess.
The question of representing gods raises interesting
paradoxes. All the icons assembled here were or are
somebody's picture of a god or goddess: they are all ut
terly in earnest, as the artist seems to be. Yet when taken
all together as in this eclectic presentation, they might
lead one to ask how anyone can claim to represent the
divine.
The comic puppet from Indonesia in "Eleggua 2"
looks out at the viewer with a wide open mouth, re
minding us how far most of these images are from that
kind of direct emotional contact. Ail are mannered and
circumscribed, from the No masks to the glow-in-the
dark crucifixes, from the laughing Buddha to the Tarot
card Queen of Cups. These two-dimensional represen
tations assert their own role as mediators between heav
en and earth, rather than trying to communicate with
the viewer directly.
In a sense, the very flatness of these photos repeats
this mediation, with the photographer acting as high
priestess. This whole experience also recreates the de
tachment of the worshipper of icons.
Modern art is largely about ideas. But what about the
aesthetics of these pieces? The sparkling colors pro
duced by this medium look much better against either a
pattern or a dark, glossy background. One of the larger
works, "Obatala 1," creates a tapestry of images that
seem to bend, and the confusion of flatness and depth is
intriguing.
"Oya 3" sets a pastel drawing at an angle against a se
ries of random but highly colored photos of mountains,
windmills, butterflies and more. The eye is drawn into
the brilliant shades of orange, red, blue, etc.
Less strong are the pieces in which the altars look
washed out against white backgrounds, or in which the
items are arranged without any sense of depth or move
ment. Despite the presence of the engaging Indonesian
puppet, "Ellegua 2" cannot build up any momentum
because of its flat and confusing display.
Some photos' dramatic set-up makes one wonder if
the gods haven't just visited the place. And some of the
idols and dolls are vivaciously life-like. "Amaterasu" pre
sents food, tea and cups and Japanese masks against a
black background; on the side, a Japanese doll looks like
it is just resting. A few of these photos are tinged with
this kind of energy. The candles of "Sulis" and "Kuan
Yin" heighten those pieces' mystical emotion.
In contrast, the composition of the simpler images,
like Demeter's vegetables and shrubs, looks out of place
in this series.
The crispness of the colors, unfortunately, is some
times marred by their presentation. In the Center for In
tegrated Systems, lighting is uneven and the glare often
proves distracting.
The placement of these works, however, provides
food tor thought. Alongside these images, bright neon
yellow windows shield the viewer from the world of sci
ence's most cutting-edge agents. The white body suits o!
the Center's researchers add to the psychedelic quality of
technologically enhanced tradition.

huge range of mythic beings. The technology used is as
new as the myths that are explored in these photos are
old. As Galuszka-Parsons writes in her artist's statement,
"High-resolution digital capture now can be paired with
filmless digital output as Cibachromes, which are
known for their intense color saturation and archival
stability. The Altar Series manifests this hyper-real detail
together with seamless computer manipulation for
image integrity."
Although they only exist as 'Cibachromes' in some
computer disk's memory, the photos appear extraordi
narily life-like, aside from their loss of depth. The images
in these photos look color-enhanced, and the first thing
the viewer notices is the remarkably flat and bright ap
pearance of the surfaces. The medium itself is very dif
ferent from normal photography, and words can't de
scribe the intensity of the colors.
Some of Galuszka-Parsons' altars are more recogniz
able than others: plates of uneaten food await the gods,
surrounded by candles. But a variety of small icons and
religious symbols clutter the landscape. Postcards and
two-dimensional elements crowd the background,
ranging from Greek Orthodox iconic Saint Georges to
Tarot cards to photos of Buddhist monks to people
walking through Versailles' gardens.
Many objects create a variety of focal points on the al
tars, although they serve as often to focus, as to distract:
plastic crucifixes that look like they might glow in the
dark, plaster Madonnas, boots and exotic slippers,
carved wooden animals, puppets, dolls, animal parts
and Japanese masks.
But above all the food looks enticing. (One may just
become very hungry while viewing this exhibit. Caveat
viewer!) In bowls and on ceramic dishes lie piles of rice,
unusual vegetables, fruits like coconuts and massive
green bananas, nuts and seeds. Galuszka-Parsons said
that she found inspiration in her travels to Latin Amer
ica, Asia and Central Europe, and we can certainly find

the material evidence here.
The artist also said that "each altar was carefully re
searched, and objects accurately placed, often with spe
cific reference to the anthropological as well as to the
personal." Indigenous items from many settings (from
Southeast Asia to Celtic Britain to modern America)
look carefully arranged.
But one wonders how "anthropological" these choic
es were. For example, in the piece "Po Ino Nogar," built
around the myth of the Cambodian rice god, plates of
rice are garnished with a Coca-Cola can. Such an object
could arguably be said to represent our own culture's at
tachment to symbols and signs. Many people would
rather buy Coke than some house brand, if only because
of the iconic nature of its trademark can.
But when attempting to claim authenticity, how does
a Coke can fit into an anthropologically correct altar of
a Cambodian rice god? If the artist had a different vision
of her role — as a postmodern collector of random im
ages, for example — these images might be easier to ac
cept.
Indeed, the artist's commentaries that describe her
work, displayed like captions next to the photographs,
add to the confusion. The captions and statements very
seriously describe, in detail, the roles and attributes of
the gods. She leaves little room for interpreting the ob
jects on display, and by presenting only strictly mythical
interpretations in her commentaries, Galuszka-Parsons

detracts from the innovation of her work. Where is the
personal?
One or two pieces, on the other hand, are very direct
ly representational: Demeter, for one, seems very accu
rately portrayed with vegetables and plants, because she
is the earth goddess.
The question of representing gods raises interesting
paradoxes. All the icons assembled here were or are
somebody's picture of a god or goddess: they are all ut
terly in earnest, as the artist seems to be. Yet when taken
all together as in this eclectic presentation, they might
lead one to ask how anyone can claim to represent the
divine.
The comic puppet from Indonesia in "Eleggua 2"
looks out at the viewer with a wide open mouth, re
minding us how far most of these images are from that
kind of direct emotional contact. Ail are mannered and
circumscribed, from the No masks to the glow-in-the
dark crucifixes, from the laughing Buddha to the Tarot
card Queen of Cups. These two-dimensional represen
tations assert their own role as mediators between heav
en and earth, rather than trying to communicate with
the viewer directly.
In a sense, the very flatness of these photos repeats
this mediation, with the photographer acting as high
priestess. This whole experience also recreates the de
tachment of the worshipper of icons.
Modern art is largely about ideas. But what about the
aesthetics of these pieces? The sparkling colors pro
duced by this medium look much better against either a
pattern or a dark, glossy background. One of the larger
works, "Obatala 1," creates a tapestry of images that
seem to bend, and the confusion of flatness and depth is
intriguing.
"Oya 3" sets a pastel drawing at an angle against a se
ries of random but highly colored photos of mountains,
windmills, butterflies and more. The eye is drawn into
the brilliant shades of orange, red, blue, etc.
Less strong are the pieces in which the altars look
washed out against white backgrounds, or in which the
items are arranged without any sense of depth or move
ment. Despite the presence of the engaging Indonesian
puppet, "Ellegua 2" cannot build up any momentum
because of its flat and confusing display.
Some photos' dramatic set-up makes one wonder if
the gods haven't just visited the place. And some of the
idols and dolls are vivaciously life-like. "Amaterasu" pre
sents food, tea and cups and Japanese masks against a
black background; on the side, a Japanese doll looks like
it is just resting. A few of these photos are tinged with
this kind of energy. The candles of "Sulis" and "Kuan
Yin" heighten those pieces' mystical emotion.
In contrast, the composition of the simpler images,
like Demeter's vegetables and shrubs, looks out of place
in this series.
The crispness of the colors, unfortunately, is some
times marred by their presentation. In the Center for In
tegrated Systems, lighting is uneven and the glare often
proves distracting.
The placement of these works, however, provides
food tor thought. Alongside these images, bright neon
yellow windows shield the viewer from the world of sci
ence's most cutting-edge agents. The white body suits o!
the Center's researchers add to the psychedelic quality of
technologically enhanced tradition.

In societies all over the world, a primal conflict arises
when machine meets mantra. Ever since agents of "sci
entific progress" started disseminating their ideas and
imposing their mechanical know-how on others, tradi
tional religions have bucked against technology.
But even in the progress-minded West, groups who
like their old ways have been known to throw wrenches
into the machines, as the Amish persist in doing. This
conflict has led most people, however, to separate the
two as much as possible: church and western science
don't mix, even if your church is a temple or a mosque.
Artist Barbara Galuszka-Parsons, however, has a dif
ferent idea. Her current display of digital photographs,
called "The Altar Series," makes a full-color plea to
knock down this barrier.
The works, on display in the Center for Integrated
Systems (and also on view at the Gates Building, the
Terman Engineering Building and the Humanities and
Science Building), are an innovative attempt to unite the
images of traditional faiths with a sophisticated techno
logical method. And although her photographs raise
important questions about the nature of belief and rep
resentations of that belief, this wedding ultimately
proves a somewhat unholy one.
