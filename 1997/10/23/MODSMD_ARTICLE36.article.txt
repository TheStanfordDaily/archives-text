## Local Wildlife The Palo Alto Zoo 
### Jennifer Godwin Contributing writer 
Sometimes zoos can be very ugly places — dirty
enclosures packed with frustrated wild animals.
Living things should not be locked up in cages. Yet
1 know that our torture of the natural world has left
few natural habitats and feeding grounds adequate
for wild creatures. Why not build zoos to protect
these creatures while some of the damage is re
paired? Which is better, death in the wild or sur
vival in captivity? The first answer is that it varies,
by zoo, by animal, by situation. Luckily, the local
situation is good — most of the creatures at the
Palo Alto Zoo are happy, loved and contributing to
science education.
Yes, we have a zoo. It's a little zoo, primarily in
tended for kids — think petting zoo but without
the farm animals or petting—but it feels like some
kind of example, a suggestion that zoos might want
to become smaller and more intimate rather than
bigger and flashier. The size of the Palo Alto Zoo
makes the animals more important than their sur
roundings.
Kids get excited when they come to this zoo,
and when the zoo comes to them through outreach
programs and science classes. Perhaps for the first
time, school-age munchkins can touch and talk
about mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds.
The zoo has no elephants, no lions or tigers, no
alligators and no polar bears. Rufus and Nayaitu,
the bobcats, are the most glamorous pair on dis
play. Most of the animals could be pets — turtles,
birds, snakes, frogs, raccoons, ferrets, pheasants,
rabbits, hedgehogs, fish and geese. In fact, some
used to be. However, the zoo takes these potential
pets and turns them into an exciting science exhib
it. Kids can get close to something that would elude
them in nature.
Take Beezlebub, for example. Beezlebub is a
crow who came to the zoo in 1982 when he was 3
years old. He was raised to be a domestic pet but his

human couldn't take care of him properly. Unable
to survive in the wild he now flaps happily about
the aviary at the zoo.
According to Zoo Curator Robert Steele, "I le's
imprinted on humans. He's escaped a few times
but he never goes far, just stays in the trees right
around here. He 'caws' at the kids [who attend
next-door Walter Hays Elementary) every morn
ing as they walk to school." Like all the exhibits,
Beezlebub's enclosure is labeled in hopes that visi
tors will learn something — in this case, the differ
ence between ravens and crows. (FYI: Crows are
smaller than ravens, crows generally flock, etc.)
Beezlebub lives next door to three pheasants,
lust in case you or your children ever join the 4H-
Club and want to win the bird / poultry competi
tion at the county fair — get a Colden Pheasant.
Originally from China, they're incredibly beautiful
birds decorated with flaming gold and red
plumage. Besides waterfowl, the only other birds at
the zoo are an African Cray Parrot named Scully,
and Critter.
Critter is a Creat Horned Owl, my favorite ani
mal at the zoo, but apparently he's a little grouchy.
According to Steele, "She killed and dismembered
her mate. We just came in one morning... We're
not really sure why." The incident was several years
ago, but she has not been matched with a new mate
in case she's still feeling aggressive.
Critter was shot in the wing when she was a ju
venile and cannot fly. She seems to spend most of
her time starring into the distance, winking her
right eye, then her left, occasionally blinking both.
The bobcats do the staring thing, too. Nayaitu and
her companion Rufus do a great deal of pacing and
gazing. They don't do much winking, but they've
got blank stares down cold. Rufus and Nayaitu are
incredibly blas£. They are not interested in you.
On the other hand, the raccoons Rowdy and
Bandit are quite interested in visitors because as far
as they're concerned, a human equals feeding time.
Fun fact: Raccoons arc called washbdr in German.
This translates into 'washing bear' for their habit of

cleaning their food.
I know Stanford has quite a washing hear pop
ulation of its own, but our country raccoons
haven't nearly as colorful histories as these two. Ac
cording to the zoo, "Rowdy, the male, was horn in
April 1995.1 lis mother, who was born in captivity,
was confiscated in a drug bust in Sacramento. Two
months later she had four babies." I)rug-bust rac
coons are neat, but they can't survive in the wild, so
the zoo gives them a home and a nice place to play.
The only other zoo creature interested in hu
mans is Alexander, the loud gray Chinese goose.
Alexander and his reportedly dumb girlfriend live
in the pond area. They share the centerpiece of the
zoo with some nice red-eared sliders (turtles), coi
fish, a bunny rabbit and some drop dead gorgeous
wood ducks. Alexander honks at anything that
moves and so acts as a kind of guard for the zoo.
The girlfriend is dumb because she can't figure out
where to lay her eggs so they'll be protected. The
cement footbridge is her best guess so far, and it's
not quite working.
The rainbow-painted footbridge is bookended
by two lovely side gardens. One is full of brightly
colored, long-necked flowers designed to attract
hummingbirds. The other one has big frog sculp
tures for the children to climb. Steele said he was
"tired of telling the kids not to climb on the rac
coon enclosure." So now they have something to
clamber on. The frog sculpture area is landscaped
with bamboo and passionflowers and is dedicated
to the memory of children in the Oklahoma City
bombing.
Next to the concrete frogs is the "Animals-
That-Eat-Crickets-and-Worms House." They've
got lizardy things and funky-looking armored tur
tles and a tree frog. However, most importantly,
you can see an actual tiger salamander, a sight that
may be worth the trip regardless of the zoo's other
attractions. In any case, after finally sighting one, I
say years of tradition, a big, big fire and bacchana
lian revelry must be worth more than these skinny
little slimy guys. Imagine a plastic sandwich bag

formed into a salamander shape and stuffed with
slow, oozy black mud. They're clearly endangered
because they aren't evolutionarily sound.
(1 jest, but tiger salamanders are not spectacular
animals, and this year 1 want mile high flames!)
The zoo has slimy amphibians as well as ele
gantly scaled reptiles like lggy the Iguana and (ileo
the Boa, but there are also cute mammal guys. Like
the three ferrets: Murray, Tabitha and the white
one, Smudge, who has the all time greatest ferret
name.
And hedgehogs! Kapu and Kapay roll up into
balls and stick their adorable little faces and paws
out. These are the Queen's croquet balls from
"Alice in Wonderland." 'They are incredibly sweet.
Kapu and Kapay are African hedgehogs, usually
somewhat larger than the European variety and
able to jump up four feet to hit a lion in the nose
with their spines. I ledgehogs are nocturnal, so go
late in the day if you want to see them bustling
about.
I love the hedgehogs. I love that the owl has a se
rious attitude problem. I love Wayside, the hum
mingbird and the crow named Beezlebub. I love
the zoo. If we have to keep things in cages any
where, let's have a place like this zoo where the chil
dren are learning, and the animals get good care.
The animals at this zoo aren't just entertainment
for humans or possessions, they're loved and pro
tected and teaching little kids. Go to the zoo. It's
free, it's happy, and you aren't r«j//yeducated until
you know that the male rosy boa has anal spurs
with which he strokes his companion during
courtship.
Enjoy yourself and send Critter my regards!
The zoo is attached to the Palo Alto Junior Museum,
located at 1451 Mtddlefteld Road, half a block north
of limbarcadero. Phone: 329-2111 Hours: Tuesday
to Saturday, 10-5; Sunday, I -4; closed Monday and
holidays. Volunteers and docents are always wel
come.
