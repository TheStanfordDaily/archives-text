## This Is Sick And Tested Spike and Mike's Rolls Into Town 
### Zachary Roberts Editorial staff 
The mood at Cubberley Auditorium was fes
tive, and the freaks were out... attendance
was high for the first of Friday night's two
showings of Spike and Mike's 1997 Sick and Twist
ed festival of animation. There would be eight
showings of the collected animated shorts over nine
days, and the crowd for the series opener was self
selective.
There were clear Spike and Mike's veterans and
unsure first-timers, clean-cut students in sweat
shirts, bikers in leather jackets and scary Goths in
trench coats. Two huge balloons floated around the
room, echoing of Sunday Flicks. They were buffet
ed around the room in general peace, until one
popped. Cheering and booing ensued simultane
ously.

This meld of disparate elements characterized
the crowd's reaction to various pieces all night long.
The show is structured to get progressively sicker
and more twisted as it goes, and some folks just
weren't prepared to handle it.
There was a somewhat lame emcee who intro
duced the show, cupping his hand around his
mouth to magnify his voice. After talking for sever
al minutes but saying nothing in an attempt to whip
up the crowd, he provided a brief moment of hilar
ity, when someone in the crowd shouted out,
"What are you sticking into your mouth?"
Sick and Twisted lead off as it has for several
years, with "No Neck |oe," a series of three old-style
animated shorts about a cute flesh-colored charac
ter named No Neck Joe. His gag is that he has no
neck. Despite the potential limitations of this joke,
Craig McCracken has continued to innovate. This
has been and will remain a crowd favorite.
The second short was "Use Instructions," by
Guido Manuli of Italy. Two stories were told at
once, and the psychedelic soundtrack contributed
to the duality of the piece. The end is heavy handed
and the conceit of the piece is made explicit; in order
to preserve the planet, we need to 'use instructions'
on how we educate our young and consume re
sources.
Kendall Smith's "Jurassic 1-art" lightened the
mood by subtly debunking the myths of carnivo
rous dinosaurs, as well as appealing to our child
hood. Remember how axil your feces were? Imag
ine how cool dinosaur shit is.

Not listed in the program guide but present in
the show was "Dirdy Birdy." This is a perennial
landmark of the Sick and Twisted Festival and an
other crowd favorite, in which a crazed bird (Dirdy
Birdy) woos a rather placid cat.
"Illusion of Life" was disappointing. As with
"Use Inst ructions" and "Smoking," the serious tone
of the piece alienated the crowd from the potential
ly interesting graphic design elements. These pieces
are much more appropriate for Spike and Mike's
"Festival of Animation."
Don I lertzfeldt's "All L'Amour" is a witty com
mentary on relationships and who wants what,
done in minimalist lines of black and white. The
only other color in the piece is red, the color of
blood spilled from the bodies of helpless males. The
transitions between scenes are a quick image of a
crumpling paper, a striking metafictional commen
tary. The crowd was duly impressed.

The first half of the show came to a close with
three strong pieces, the first of which was Greg
Holfeld's " Barflies." Loosely playing off the Charles
Bukowski book and movie of the same name,
"Barflies" is an endearing claymation look at two
British (lies that smoke, drink and view a bug light
as a psychoactive joyride. It is destined to become a
classic.
DNA Productions' "The Booby Trap" is a twist
ed look at the backstage fighting of a group of strip
pers. In tone and character movement it is fully Jap
mation, but the animation itself is a mixofjap-ma
tion and 1970s American cartoon that clash well.
The first half of Sick and Twisted finishes with
"Little Rude Riding Hood," a sex-filled version of
the classic fairy tale. Toward the end, the wolf snarls
"I'm going to fuck you silly." "No you're not,"
replies Riding Hood, pulling a pistol and spreading
her legs. "You're going to eat me, just like in the
book." The audience went into a frenzy.
After a short intermission, the emcee was back
on stage reminding us to cheer and make noise. 1 le
clearly didn't know how to handle an audience, and
people cheered when he got off the stage.
The second half started with two more episodes
of "No Neck Joe." The crowd's enthusiasm for the
shorts was high. This was quickly followed by "Hut
Sluts," which made the audience cringe. Two shal
low SoCal women ("Summer" and "Tiffany") go to
the beach and get hit on, graphically prepare for a
party and finally go. The close-ups and action se
quences evoked loud groans and stifled laughter.

Nick Gibbons' "Fast Driver"
is a take-off of the popular
"Speed Racer," and done in the
same animated style. For exam
ple, mouth movements do not
match the spoken tracks. The
entire short plays on the latent
homosexuality of "Speed
Racer," the respective characters
have very different personalities,
and "Fast" ("Speed") is openly
gay-
Les Claypool of Primus pro
vided the music for Mike John
son's "Devil Went Down To
Georgia." Using Claypool's
thunderous version of the classic
bluegrass tune, Johnson creatcd
a stunning claymation video of
the story. There is a precedent
for claymation music videos at
Spike and Mike's: in 1994, Weird
A! Yankovic's "Jurassic Park"
song and video toured with
Spike And Mike's Festival of An
imation.
A wonderfully tongue-in
cheek claymation followed, called

"Sea Slugs." Adam Lane's piece is the shortest of the show, clocking in at one minute and 30 seconds long,
but the piece has a lasting effect. Whereas Johnson used very fluid, ultramodern claymation techniques,
Lane used very old, seemingly static techniques that play well off of Johnson's. Putting the two back-to-bae k
was an excellent idea.
The only truly heartbreaking short of the festival was "Yes, Timmy, There Is A Santa Glaus." Drawn in
shades of gray and overlapping plates of lines, Timmy wakes up Christmas morning and opens all the pre
sents under the tree. 1 le finds no delight in the skateboard, soccer ball, pogo stick and other toys, and the
final present he opens is a pair of bronzed baby shoes. Only then do we see why Timmy is unhappy with
these presents, and are immediately given a shot of Santa and Rudolph looking in through a window and
having a good laugh at Timmy's expense.
I hree repeats from previous Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted festivals are among the final five shorts
I he first is "Lloyd's Lunchbox," a series of super-short, super-twisted adventures of the hero Lloyd. This is
followed by the Ã¼biquitous "Horndog," one of the funniest pieces of the entire show. There's a reason it's
been around for several years.
"Sloaches I'un I louse" drives the lowest common denominator for Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted festiv.il to
a new low. It does, however, redeem ilsell with a social commentary, and the style of claymation has a sloppy quality
that is very different from previous examples. "Big Top Asshole," the third repeat from previous years, was next. Its
vulgar protagonist elicited as many
laughs as ever.

The show closed with "The
Spirit Of Christmas," which is the
pilot episode for the new series
"South Park." It was on the
weight of this pilot that the series
was made, and if everything else
that you've heard about Spike
and Mike's has made you cringe,
this alone is worth the show.
As a five-time Spike and
Mike's visitor, I was slightly dis
appointed with the show. Fully
one third of the program were re
peats from previous years, and
several other shorts were moral
istic instead of simply sick or
twisted. But maybe that indicates
the changing nature of what
"sick" and "twisted" means.
Still, if you've never been to
Spike and Mike's Sick and Twist
ed, then you are missing out on a
cultural phenomenon. I'll be
back next weekend, and I'm
bringing money for the video
collections of past festivals sold at
the door.
