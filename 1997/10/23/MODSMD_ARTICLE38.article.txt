## monk on monk: "Happy Birthday, Jazzdaddy!" 
### Andrew Oyefesobi 
Monk on Monk. A son on his father. A dedication to his memory via music,
to his character via composition. T.S. Monk is touring the nation for a
special 80th anniversary birthday tribute to his father. Would the late Th
elonious Sphere Monk be proud of his son's performance at Memorial Auditorium
on Friday, Oct. 17? Certainly.
Barring the obvious nepotism factor, why would T.S. Monk accept the challenge
of celebrating a consummate musician regarded as a composer of inimitable
anomaly for the ears? The man himself admitted, "1 can't do what my father did
musically, but my father's legacy has afforded me the opportunity to spread the ap
preciation and acknowledgment of jazz internationally."
T.S. Monk brought his 10 man piece to do the best damn job he could in a show

sponsored by Lively Arts at Stanford. The hip cat arrived

on stage with a clean-shaven head, shades and mus
cled drummer's arms. He said his dads birthday

had him in "a very, very Monkish mood."
The band opened with the Thelonious
Monk classic "Epistrophy," and then the 47-
year-old T.S. Monk shared a story about
going to the Newport Jazz Festival with his
father as a boy. Thelonious Monk walked
into the musician's tent, and John Coltrane,
Duke Ellington and Art Blakey stopped any
and all jiving â€” his affect was that powerful.

"Evidence," a 1977 collaboration with his
father, became truly heavy when T.S. Monk
performed it without Thelonious Monk
for the first time. "Ugly Beauty," with a

somber horn section, could be the score
to an old Hollywood black 'n white.
Mid-set, T.S. Monk demanded the

glaring white lights be brought down,
because they gave the stage that "jail
house look" and "killed the jazz." The
band proceeded to play an upbeat
bebop piece, the style of new jazz of
which Thelonious Monk was a student.

The first set was ended with "Bright
Mississippi," a composition Thelonious
Monk had built on top of standard cord
changes. Rightfully, Thelonious Monk
would have been proudest of the clas
sic avante-garde with groovy bass that
his son navigated with the band.

In set two, T.S. Monk recounted the
early days of living in a small Manhattan
apartment with his father's piano in the

kitchen, and explained that what Time mag
azine described as genius chic in 1964 was simply
the result of being broke.

Then, Kevin Mahogany, Joe Williams' torch bearer, brought in rich baritone vocals. In
i composition called "In Walked Bud," his vocal experimentation with jazz scat was rous
ing and just plain old fun. "Round Midnight" was a bluesy love song cut in two halves by

an instrumental speed session, with mile-a-minute drums and sax.
"Four in One" was introduced as the show-determining number laced with dis
sonance, and the hand attacked the difficult arrangement. Pianist Ronnie Mathews
was so inspired, that he got up and did Thelonious Monk's infamous elbow dance
and shuffle. Dazzling, yes.
If the goal was to close out the tribute performance in grand style, it was met. T.S.
Monk described his father's propensity to write compositions for the people he
loved, including "800 Boos Birthday" and "(Ireen Chimneys" for his late daughter.
"Little Tootie Fruitie," Thelonious Monk's dedication to his son, was the finale
of choice. The thumping arrangement with a funky drum section, quick, crisp
piano and coolly bold horns wasjust the jazz juice needed to bring down the house.
A standing ovation brought T.S. Monk and the boys back for a big band rumpus.
After which, the host of the bash yelled, "1 lappy Birthday, Daddy!" The party was

officially over when T.S. Monk threw his drum
sticks to the ground.

The Monk on Monk (11) was released on
N2K, the first Internet-based record label. On
it, T.S. Monk is joined by the likes of Wayne
Shorter, I )iane Reeves, Roy 1 largrove, (Irover
Washington and 1 lerbie 1 lancock. The sup
porting cast is great, but imitation, not repli
cation is most flattering.
According to Robin Kelley, a Thelonious
Monk biographer, Monk on Monk sacri
fices something in its translation from the
elder Monk's raw originals to T.S. Monk's
cleaned up versions. Kelley,a New York Uni
versity professor of history and African-
American studies, hosted a listening session
at Rains House Oct. 15.
Kelley uses a more academic approach, fo
cusing on the canonization of jazz and its
adoption into high culture in a neo-conserv
ative way by stripping it of its racial mores.
Essentially, Monk's original impact is diluted

by peeling away the primitiveness and "dissing
his avant-garde influences.
Kelley's point is well-taken, and even T.S. Monk i

quick to assume the role of simply a spokesman for his fa
ther's legacy. T.S. Monk is using his drumsticks and chair

manship of the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz to en
sure th.it Thelonious Monk's brilliance endures.

I lis son's tribute could only be characterized as fit
ting, because T.S. Monk balanced it with respectful cov

ers and poignant insight into the man behind the music.
Yet, in the balcony, behind a row of silver scalps, boxed into

my cranberry velvet theater seat, I had a contained celebra
tion. I could only quietly tap my foot and applaud on cue with

my elbows tucked tight to my side.
I couldn't escape the thought that had I been in some slightly shady

cabaret on a Harlem back street, I might have felt iike I was having my Thelonious
Monk birthday cake and eating it, too. And I think that Thelonious Monk would
probably have wanted that.
