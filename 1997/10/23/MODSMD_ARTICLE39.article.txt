# The 						few, the proud and the very sexy DJs of KZSU

### Wenshin Lee 
Q: What is this stuff you're playing?
A: Oh, it's an offshoot of grindcore, hut it's actually slow,
sludgy grindcore — atypical for this band, which usually plays
powerviolence-type music:
Huh? And so begins my conversation with Elliott Lange, a
disc jockey volunteering at Stanford's student-run radio station,
KZSU. Before I can nod my head, he eagerly leads me to a shelf
of C Ds, pulling out one CD after another as he continues to tell
me about the local powerviolence band out ol Redwood City
that he plays on his weekly program.
"You have to listen to this." he told me as he dragged me to
;i sicrco ' This band. Spa//., is so amazing." Lange drummed on
his knees, played .111 guitar, and for a moment I was afraid that
he has retreated into grmdeore la-la land, leaving the poor ig
noi ant reporter nodding to unfamiliar music, But never missing
a heat, he finally looks up at me with a childish gi in.
"Sorry I just gel so excited when someone even exhibits the
slightest interest in the music I play," he laughed.
Even though I had never heard Spa// or grindcore, 1 was
moved by the enthusiasm 111 Lange's voice as he shared his
music with me. Such energy and passion for music is evident in
all the DJs at k/.SIJ, whether they are plavmg grindcore or

Latin American folk songs or hip-hop. Disc jockeys at KZSU
plan and produce their own programs, making their shows cre
ative outlets for sharing their musical passions with the Stan
ford community.
' KZSU strives to teach the people in and around Stanford
about music that may not be easily accessible. Everyone at the
station is so passionate about the music they play; just ask any
DJ about why they like a song, and they would love to explain,"
said one of the music directors, Hannah Blair, a sophomore
who has been with the station since the beginning of her fresh
man year.
The diversity at KZSU, along with the unique combination
of student and community involvement, makes the radio sta
tion a feast for the ears or at least for ears that are willing to try
the unfamiliar KZSU is now in its 50th year, coming a long way
to reach its current reputation as one of the best college radio
stations 111 the country.
Beginning as a AM carrier current station in 1947, the sta
tion carried news and lectures into dorm rooms using carrier
pipes. KZSU received its FM license in 1964 and was upgrad
ed to S(H) watts in 1978. Currently, the station has a frequency
of 90.1 and reaches most of the Bay Area 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
KZSU plays a variety of programs, including the DJ's music
shows, news programs, live sports broadcasts and call-in shows.
Also broadcasting important Stanford events and public ser
vice announcements, the station plays a key role in communi
cation between the school and the students. KZSU receives

most of its funding from Us ASSU special fee and
underwriting. This year, the radio station received a
much needed $47,105 fee from ASSU. hut it still
needs funding from other sources.
Voices of KZSU
The DJs at KZSU span all ages, races and
backgrounds. With half of them from the communi
ty and half from the student body, KZSU represents
a unique mix of interests and musical tastes. Each DJ
has something valuable to share with the others, and
together they hope to share their musical passions
with the Stanford community.
Brought together by a love of music, the DJs
interact in an environment where a desire for learn
ing about music is insatiable. The station receives
2(H) releases a week, and every single release is re
viewed. KZSU currently has about SO.(KX) releases
in its studio, and DJs can bring in other music to
share as well. With such a selection of music and only
24 hours in a day, it's no wonder that DJs are con
stantly thumbing through CDs for new favorites.
One DJ, Jim Mason, calls his program Eclec
tic Circus — "a little of everything." A member of
the Palo Alto community. Mason graduated from
college eight years ago and is now working as a soft
ware engineer.
"Ah." I commented with a smile. "So, you
come back here to feel young again."
"What? He gave me a confused look, and I
remembered that college students are not the only
ones vvho love music His energy bounced around
the room as he (lipped on one CD after another,
playing short punk segme.its at the end of his pro
gram. With his shav ed head and acid bleached jeans,
you might never guess that Mason is a software en
gineer when he's off the air. Mason reminded me
that learning does not stop with college, and he gave

me a new perspective on all those techies out there.
For one DJ. volunteering at the station helps her with her
Stanford education. Robin Balliger is a graduate student work
ing on her dissertation on music in the Caribbean. Her research
focuses on using music to talk about identity, and she shares
such music on her world music show on Wednesday mornings.
Calling the show "Globeslam," she plays a mix of Caribbean
music, Bhangra, Afro-Pop and rock en espanol
"What drew me to KZSU was my love of music and diverse
environments. Plaving my music on air gives me a chance to
share what I am learning about." she said.
Chi-hui Yang, .1 senior majoring in international relations,
has been with the station since his freshman year. He said he be
lieves that volunteering at the station gives him a connection to
the world outside of school. "Stanford is so isolated from every
one else. When I play this music, it's refreshing," said Yang. On
Tuesday nights, he plays a mix of music spanning from punk to
world music.
All of the DJs at KZSU have something unique to share on
the air, but they are aware that people must be brave to venture
into 90.1.
"You might turn on KZSU and hate the stuff because it's un
familiar. It's about getting past the irst impression, under
standing why the artist made the piece of music. A listener will
probably start out thinking, 'Why should I listen to this?' and
finish with a new perspective on music. It's about taking a
chance," said Steve Lambert, another music director.
Lambert, <1 resident of San Francisco who volunteers at the
station, compared understanding music to understanding art:
"You might not like very piece in an art museum, but you try
to respect or understand its place there."
For the brave and adventurous souls that do try KZSU, the
opinions vary greatly. Freshman Brent Jacobsen listened to
KZSU during the first week of school, hut he said he found the
music hard to absorb. "I like the concept behind a non-com
mercial radio station hat plays music you might not find anv-

where else; but when I turn on the radio, I usu
ally want to hear familiar songs. You never
know what's going to be playing when you turn
on KZSU," he said.
Hut for another freshman, it is this same un
imiliar and eclectic set of music that draws her
< > the station. Cindy Daignault first listened to
KZSU in the summer of her junior year in high
school when she attended a summer program
11 Stanford. After meeting a DJ who convinced
her to listen to his program, Daignault started
keeping up with the station while she lived in
Baltimore using KZSU's web page.
It can be daunting when you first turn on
e station and realize that you never hear the
same thing twice," Daignault said, "but after
1 >u net to know a particular DJ or program,
'■ in start to listen to other shows without the
cling that the music is impenetrable."
After arriving on campus this fall, Daig
lt applied for a training spot and is now in
I process of becoming a DJ. She said she
ipes to introduce Stanford to the world ol
ironic music, a type of dance music that is
II ready popular in the Bay Area.
Stanford's KZSU is the first station in the
Hay Area to play Jungle music, and the DJ who
ins the music is heavily involved in the Rave
u rhis brings a lot of publicity to our Rave
piusic program, and so our program has a great
t llowing," she said.
According to Daignault, the best part of DJ
ing lor the station is the musical knowledge she
ljains. "With such a busy schedule, it's easy to
neglect my musical interests. Working at
KZSU gives me a scheduled time of week 10

listen to new bands and keep up with old ones,'
she said. Daignault hopes to build a life career
in music, and she is looking to put together a
band at Stanford.
KZSU also has a large following among the
high school students in the Bay Area, and one
student. Debra Rolfe, from Palo Alto High
School even produces a weekly show . Rolfe in
vites nine or 10 ol her rowdiest friends to join
her every Tuesday afternoon from three to six
to play punk music and talk about school,
music and life in general.
"It's a great alternative to being a bored
high school student. If you're not into the shop
ping or movie scene, there's not much to do in
Palo Aito. Ever since ninth grade, I've wanted
to find out more about underground music,
and KZSU is the only place iround here I can
do it." Rolfe said. Using KZSU as a creative
outlet, Rolfe and her friends are able to turn ,1
show into a social gathering and a chance to
broadcast their views to the community.
Byrd I larmonica I lale. the blues director at
KZSU. has been spinning music at the station
for six years. He hosts a classic blues show on
Saturday mornings, playing "everybody from
Johnny Adams to Muddy Waters A blues
harmonica player with his own band. Hale
feels that the show is an extension of what he
has been doing for the past 25 years
"I've always played blues music in my
house, and I hold record parties at my house.
Hosting this program satisfies a deep hunger in
my soul to play blues music," Hale said.
Though music may be the main focus of
KZSU. other programs are worth a listen

talk shows, sports broadcasts and news briefs.
One radio call-in show features Dr. Alexa
Boer, the chief resident in Dermatology at
Stanford Medical Center, and her brother An
drew, an attorney. Featured at (i p.m. on Tues
day nights, "On Call" is a program for people
to call in with questions about common health
problems. Last week, Boer talked about the
benefits of flu-shots and cutting cuticles. I'o
liven up the show, she invited special guest
Hershel Yatovitz. a guitarist for Chris Isaac.
While Yatovitz claims that his only medical ex
pertise is learning from "whatever ails me and
whatever I do about it."he offered interesting
insights on concert costumes.
"I was thinking of getting a diamond collar
to match Chris's mirror jacket. What do you
think?" he asked. 1 "he question led to a discus
sion about the non-absorbent and heavy mate
rial of concert costumes The call-in show isca
sual and entertaining, but offers a chance for
the Stanford communitv to have their health
questions answered.
The sports program at KZSIJ, run by direc
tor Ray Saloom, travels around the country with
five sports teams men and women's basketball,
men and women's football and women s vollev -
ball. "Last year I got to travel around thecoun
tr\ with all the teams We have a great time on
the road The station makes 2iXi live broadcasts
a veai and istheonlv training ground lor sports
broadcasting i>ll campus " said Salloom
llccoiiiiiiK a part <»l k/.SU
At the beginning ol each quarter. k/Sl has
an organizational meeting lor prospective DJs
lo become a DJ. one must fust undergo an ap
plication process. If a prospective DJ is accept
ed into the training program, he or she must take
a quarter long course that teaches the median

its of the control
board, how to re
view music and how
the station runs. At
the end ot the train
ing course, the stu
dent must make a
demo test simulat
ing a three-hour
music program.
Then the student
will have «i tr;iining
slot, conveniently
scheduled at 3 a.m.
Blair remembers
her first time on the
air: "At three in the
morning, \ou don't
even know if any
one is listening. But
it's such an adrena
line rush to he on
the air — it's like
impromptu perfor
mance art I here's
no script, no safety
net; it's just you in
the studio playing
your music."
According to the
music directors at
KZSI', 'he station
does not train peo
ple for commercial
radio because non
commercial radio
runs on a complete
ly different path.
"In commercial
radio, the I)J does

nothing — he has a script, people manning the
control board and a playlist that someone else
chooses. On KZSIJ the DJ picks the music,
works the control board and plans what he is
going to say on the air," said Blair.
Blair also explained that the station is open
to anyone who wants to be a part of KZSIJ
'We are looking for enthusiastic people with a
passion for learning about music," she said.
Smurph, a member of the community who
moved to k/Sl from another station, said
that his old station was strict about the type ol
music he could play on the air. "You get a lot of
freedom here." he said. "The people are very
open; the atmosphere is awesome. 1 encourage
everyone to come and check out k/Sl
Alumni ol k/Sl 1 include Adam West, the

music with me. Such energy and passion for music is evident in
all the DJs at k/.SIJ, whether they are plavmg grindcore or

Latin American folk songs or hip-hop. Disc jockeys at KZSU
plan and produce their own programs, making their shows cre
ative outlets for sharing their musical passions with the Stan
ford community.
' KZSU strives to teach the people in and around Stanford
about music that may not be easily accessible. Everyone at the
station is so passionate about the music they play; just ask any
DJ about why they like a song, and they would love to explain,"
said one of the music directors, Hannah Blair, a sophomore
who has been with the station since the beginning of her fresh
man year.
The diversity at KZSU, along with the unique combination
of student and community involvement, makes the radio sta
tion a feast for the ears or at least for ears that are willing to try
the unfamiliar KZSU is now in its 50th year, coming a long way
to reach its current reputation as one of the best college radio
stations 111 the country.
Beginning as a AM carrier current station in 1947, the sta
tion carried news and lectures into dorm rooms using carrier
pipes. KZSU received its FM license in 1964 and was upgrad
ed to S(H) watts in 1978. Currently, the station has a frequency
of 90.1 and reaches most of the Bay Area 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
KZSU plays a variety of programs, including the DJ's music
shows, news programs, live sports broadcasts and call-in shows.
Also broadcasting important Stanford events and public ser
vice announcements, the station plays a key role in communi
cation between the school and the students. KZSU receives

most of its funding from Us ASSU special fee and
underwriting. This year, the radio station received a
much needed $47,105 fee from ASSU. hut it still
needs funding from other sources.
Voices of KZSU
The DJs at KZSU span all ages, races and
backgrounds. With half of them from the communi
ty and half from the student body, KZSU represents
a unique mix of interests and musical tastes. Each DJ
has something valuable to share with the others, and
together they hope to share their musical passions
with the Stanford community.
Brought together by a love of music, the DJs
interact in an environment where a desire for learn
ing about music is insatiable. The station receives
2(H) releases a week, and every single release is re
viewed. KZSU currently has about SO.(KX) releases
in its studio, and DJs can bring in other music to
share as well. With such a selection of music and only
24 hours in a day, it's no wonder that DJs are con
stantly thumbing through CDs for new favorites.
One DJ, Jim Mason, calls his program Eclec
tic Circus — "a little of everything." A member of
the Palo Alto community. Mason graduated from
college eight years ago and is now working as a soft
ware engineer.
"Ah." I commented with a smile. "So, you
come back here to feel young again."
"What? He gave me a confused look, and I
remembered that college students are not the only
ones vvho love music His energy bounced around
the room as he (lipped on one CD after another,
playing short punk segme.its at the end of his pro
gram. With his shav ed head and acid bleached jeans,
you might never guess that Mason is a software en
gineer when he's off the air. Mason reminded me
that learning does not stop with college, and he gave

me a new perspective on all those techies out there.
For one DJ. volunteering at the station helps her with her
Stanford education. Robin Balliger is a graduate student work
ing on her dissertation on music in the Caribbean. Her research
focuses on using music to talk about identity, and she shares
such music on her world music show on Wednesday mornings.
Calling the show "Globeslam," she plays a mix of Caribbean
music, Bhangra, Afro-Pop and rock en espanol
"What drew me to KZSU was my love of music and diverse
environments. Plaving my music on air gives me a chance to
share what I am learning about." she said.
Chi-hui Yang, .1 senior majoring in international relations,
has been with the station since his freshman year. He said he be
lieves that volunteering at the station gives him a connection to
the world outside of school. "Stanford is so isolated from every
one else. When I play this music, it's refreshing," said Yang. On
Tuesday nights, he plays a mix of music spanning from punk to
world music.
All of the DJs at KZSU have something unique to share on
the air, but they are aware that people must be brave to venture
into 90.1.
"You might turn on KZSU and hate the stuff because it's un
familiar. It's about getting past the irst impression, under
standing why the artist made the piece of music. A listener will
probably start out thinking, 'Why should I listen to this?' and
finish with a new perspective on music. It's about taking a
chance," said Steve Lambert, another music director.
Lambert, <1 resident of San Francisco who volunteers at the
station, compared understanding music to understanding art:
"You might not like very piece in an art museum, but you try
to respect or understand its place there."
For the brave and adventurous souls that do try KZSU, the
opinions vary greatly. Freshman Brent Jacobsen listened to
KZSU during the first week of school, hut he said he found the
music hard to absorb. "I like the concept behind a non-com
mercial radio station hat plays music you might not find anv-

where else; but when I turn on the radio, I usu
ally want to hear familiar songs. You never
know what's going to be playing when you turn
on KZSU," he said.
Hut for another freshman, it is this same un
imiliar and eclectic set of music that draws her
< > the station. Cindy Daignault first listened to
KZSU in the summer of her junior year in high
school when she attended a summer program
11 Stanford. After meeting a DJ who convinced
her to listen to his program, Daignault started
keeping up with the station while she lived in
Baltimore using KZSU's web page.
It can be daunting when you first turn on
e station and realize that you never hear the
same thing twice," Daignault said, "but after
1 >u net to know a particular DJ or program,
'■ in start to listen to other shows without the
cling that the music is impenetrable."
After arriving on campus this fall, Daig
lt applied for a training spot and is now in
I process of becoming a DJ. She said she
ipes to introduce Stanford to the world ol
ironic music, a type of dance music that is
II ready popular in the Bay Area.
Stanford's KZSU is the first station in the
Hay Area to play Jungle music, and the DJ who
ins the music is heavily involved in the Rave
u rhis brings a lot of publicity to our Rave
piusic program, and so our program has a great
t llowing," she said.
According to Daignault, the best part of DJ
ing lor the station is the musical knowledge she
ljains. "With such a busy schedule, it's easy to
neglect my musical interests. Working at
KZSU gives me a scheduled time of week 10

listen to new bands and keep up with old ones,'
she said. Daignault hopes to build a life career
in music, and she is looking to put together a
band at Stanford.
KZSU also has a large following among the
high school students in the Bay Area, and one
student. Debra Rolfe, from Palo Alto High
School even produces a weekly show . Rolfe in
vites nine or 10 ol her rowdiest friends to join
her every Tuesday afternoon from three to six
to play punk music and talk about school,
music and life in general.
"It's a great alternative to being a bored
high school student. If you're not into the shop
ping or movie scene, there's not much to do in
Palo Aito. Ever since ninth grade, I've wanted
to find out more about underground music,
and KZSU is the only place iround here I can
do it." Rolfe said. Using KZSU as a creative
outlet, Rolfe and her friends are able to turn ,1
show into a social gathering and a chance to
broadcast their views to the community.
Byrd I larmonica I lale. the blues director at
KZSU. has been spinning music at the station
for six years. He hosts a classic blues show on
Saturday mornings, playing "everybody from
Johnny Adams to Muddy Waters A blues
harmonica player with his own band. Hale
feels that the show is an extension of what he
has been doing for the past 25 years
"I've always played blues music in my
house, and I hold record parties at my house.
Hosting this program satisfies a deep hunger in
my soul to play blues music," Hale said.
Though music may be the main focus of
KZSU. other programs are worth a listen

talk shows, sports broadcasts and news briefs.
One radio call-in show features Dr. Alexa
Boer, the chief resident in Dermatology at
Stanford Medical Center, and her brother An
drew, an attorney. Featured at (i p.m. on Tues
day nights, "On Call" is a program for people
to call in with questions about common health
problems. Last week, Boer talked about the
benefits of flu-shots and cutting cuticles. I'o
liven up the show, she invited special guest
Hershel Yatovitz. a guitarist for Chris Isaac.
While Yatovitz claims that his only medical ex
pertise is learning from "whatever ails me and
whatever I do about it."he offered interesting
insights on concert costumes.
"I was thinking of getting a diamond collar
to match Chris's mirror jacket. What do you
think?" he asked. 1 "he question led to a discus
sion about the non-absorbent and heavy mate
rial of concert costumes The call-in show isca
sual and entertaining, but offers a chance for
the Stanford communitv to have their health
questions answered.
The sports program at KZSIJ, run by direc
tor Ray Saloom, travels around the country with
five sports teams men and women's basketball,
men and women's football and women s vollev -
ball. "Last year I got to travel around thecoun

ing course, the stu

Then the student

Blair remembers
her first time on the
air: "At three in the
morning, \ou don't
even know if any
one is listening. But
it's such an adrena
line rush to he on
the air — it's like

According to the
music directors at
KZSI', 'he station
does not train peo

radio because non
commercial radio
runs on a complete
ly different path.
"In commercial
radio, the I)J does

nothing — he has a script, people manning the

chooses. On KZSIJ the DJ picks the music,
works the control board and plans what he is
going to say on the air," said Blair.
Blair also explained that the station is open
to anyone who wants to be a part of KZSIJ
'We are looking for enthusiastic people with a
passion for learning about music," she said.
Smurph, a member of the community who
moved to k/Sl from another station, said
that his old station was strict about the type ol
music he could play on the air. "You get a lot of

Q: What is this stuff you're playing?
A: Oh, it's an offshoot of grindcore, hut it's actually slow,
sludgy grindcore — atypical for this band, which usually plays
powerviolence-type music:
Huh? And so begins my conversation with Elliott Lange, a
disc jockey volunteering at Stanford's student-run radio station,
KZSU. Before I can nod my head, he eagerly leads me to a shelf
of C Ds, pulling out one CD after another as he continues to tell
me about the local powerviolence band out ol Redwood City
that he plays on his weekly program.
"You have to listen to this." he told me as he dragged me to
;i sicrco ' This band. Spa//., is so amazing." Lange drummed on
his knees, played .111 guitar, and for a moment I was afraid that
he has retreated into grmdeore la-la land, leaving the poor ig

tion a feast for the ears or at least for ears that are willing to try
the unfamiliar KZSU is now in its 50th year, coming a long way
to reach its current reputation as one of the best college radio
stations 111 the country.
Beginning as a AM carrier current station in 1947, the sta
tion carried news and lectures into dorm rooms using carrier
pipes. KZSU received its FM license in 1964 and was upgrad
ed to S(H) watts in 1978. Currently, the station has a frequency
of 90.1 and reaches most of the Bay Area 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
KZSU plays a variety of programs, including the DJ's music
shows, news programs, live sports broadcasts and call-in shows.
Also broadcasting important Stanford events and public ser
vice announcements, the station plays a key role in communi
cation between the school and the students. KZSU receives

most of its funding from Us ASSU special fee and
underwriting. This year, the radio station received a
much needed $47,105 fee from ASSU. hut it still
needs funding from other sources.
Voices of KZSU
The DJs at KZSU span all ages, races and
backgrounds. With half of them from the communi
ty and half from the student body, KZSU represents
a unique mix of interests and musical tastes. Each DJ
has something valuable to share with the others, and
together they hope to share their musical passions
with the Stanford community.
Brought together by a love of music, the DJs
interact in an environment where a desire for learn
ing about music is insatiable. The station receives
2(H) releases a week, and every single release is re
viewed. KZSU currently has about SO.(KX) releases
in its studio, and DJs can bring in other music to
share as well. With such a selection of music and only
24 hours in a day, it's no wonder that DJs are con
stantly thumbing through CDs for new favorites.
One DJ, Jim Mason, calls his program Eclec
tic Circus — "a little of everything." A member of
the Palo Alto community. Mason graduated from
college eight years ago and is now working as a soft
ware engineer.
"Ah." I commented with a smile. "So, you
come back here to feel young again."
"What? He gave me a confused look, and I
remembered that college students are not the only
ones vvho love music His energy bounced around
the room as he (lipped on one CD after another,
playing short punk segme.its at the end of his pro
gram. With his shav ed head and acid bleached jeans,
you might never guess that Mason is a software en
gineer when he's off the air. Mason reminded me
that learning does not stop with college, and he gave

me a new perspective on all those techies out there.
For one DJ. volunteering at the station helps her with her
Stanford education. Robin Balliger is a graduate student work
ing on her dissertation on music in the Caribbean. Her research
focuses on using music to talk about identity, and she shares
such music on her world music show on Wednesday mornings.
Calling the show "Globeslam," she plays a mix of Caribbean
music, Bhangra, Afro-Pop and rock en espanol
"What drew me to KZSU was my love of music and diverse
environments. Plaving my music on air gives me a chance to
share what I am learning about." she said.
Chi-hui Yang, .1 senior majoring in international relations,
has been with the station since his freshman year. He said he be
lieves that volunteering at the station gives him a connection to
the world outside of school. "Stanford is so isolated from every
one else. When I play this music, it's refreshing," said Yang. On
Tuesday nights, he plays a mix of music spanning from punk to
world music.
All of the DJs at KZSU have something unique to share on
the air, but they are aware that people must be brave to venture
into 90.1.
"You might turn on KZSU and hate the stuff because it's un
familiar. It's about getting past the irst impression, under
standing why the artist made the piece of music. A listener will
probably start out thinking, 'Why should I listen to this?' and
finish with a new perspective on music. It's about taking a
chance," said Steve Lambert, another music director.
Lambert, <1 resident of San Francisco who volunteers at the
station, compared understanding music to understanding art:
"You might not like very piece in an art museum, but you try
to respect or understand its place there."
For the brave and adventurous souls that do try KZSU, the
opinions vary greatly. Freshman Brent Jacobsen listened to
KZSU during the first week of school, hut he said he found the
music hard to absorb. "I like the concept behind a non-com
mercial radio station hat plays music you might not find anv-

where else; but when I turn on the radio, I usu
ally want to hear familiar songs. You never
know what's going to be playing when you turn
on KZSU," he said.
Hut for another freshman, it is this same un
imiliar and eclectic set of music that draws her
< > the station. Cindy Daignault first listened to
KZSU in the summer of her junior year in high
school when she attended a summer program
11 Stanford. After meeting a DJ who convinced
her to listen to his program, Daignault started
keeping up with the station while she lived in
Baltimore using KZSU's web page.
It can be daunting when you first turn on
e station and realize that you never hear the
same thing twice," Daignault said, "but after
1 >u net to know a particular DJ or program,
'■ in start to listen to other shows without the
cling that the music is impenetrable."
After arriving on campus this fall, Daig
lt applied for a training spot and is now in
I process of becoming a DJ. She said she
ipes to introduce Stanford to the world ol
ironic music, a type of dance music that is
II ready popular in the Bay Area.
Stanford's KZSU is the first station in the
Hay Area to play Jungle music, and the DJ who
ins the music is heavily involved in the Rave
u rhis brings a lot of publicity to our Rave
piusic program, and so our program has a great
t llowing," she said.
According to Daignault, the best part of DJ
ing lor the station is the musical knowledge she
ljains. "With such a busy schedule, it's easy to
neglect my musical interests. Working at
KZSU gives me a scheduled time of week 10

listen to new bands and keep up with old ones,'
she said. Daignault hopes to build a life career
in music, and she is looking to put together a
band at Stanford.
KZSU also has a large following among the
high school students in the Bay Area, and one
student. Debra Rolfe, from Palo Alto High
School even produces a weekly show . Rolfe in
vites nine or 10 ol her rowdiest friends to join
her every Tuesday afternoon from three to six
to play punk music and talk about school,
music and life in general.
"It's a great alternative to being a bored
high school student. If you're not into the shop
ping or movie scene, there's not much to do in
Palo Aito. Ever since ninth grade, I've wanted
to find out more about underground music,
and KZSU is the only place iround here I can
do it." Rolfe said. Using KZSU as a creative
outlet, Rolfe and her friends are able to turn ,1
show into a social gathering and a chance to
broadcast their views to the community.
Byrd I larmonica I lale. the blues director at
KZSU. has been spinning music at the station
for six years. He hosts a classic blues show on
Saturday mornings, playing "everybody from
Johnny Adams to Muddy Waters A blues
harmonica player with his own band. Hale
feels that the show is an extension of what he
has been doing for the past 25 years
"I've always played blues music in my
house, and I hold record parties at my house.
Hosting this program satisfies a deep hunger in
my soul to play blues music," Hale said.
Though music may be the main focus of
KZSU. other programs are worth a listen

talk shows, sports broadcasts and news briefs.
One radio call-in show features Dr. Alexa
Boer, the chief resident in Dermatology at
Stanford Medical Center, and her brother An
drew, an attorney. Featured at (i p.m. on Tues
day nights, "On Call" is a program for people
to call in with questions about common health
problems. Last week, Boer talked about the
benefits of flu-shots and cutting cuticles. I'o
liven up the show, she invited special guest
Hershel Yatovitz. a guitarist for Chris Isaac.
While Yatovitz claims that his only medical ex
pertise is learning from "whatever ails me and
whatever I do about it."he offered interesting
insights on concert costumes.
"I was thinking of getting a diamond collar
to match Chris's mirror jacket. What do you
think?" he asked. 1 "he question led to a discus
sion about the non-absorbent and heavy mate
rial of concert costumes The call-in show isca
sual and entertaining, but offers a chance for
the Stanford communitv to have their health
questions answered.
The sports program at KZSIJ, run by direc
tor Ray Saloom, travels around the country with
five sports teams men and women's basketball,
men and women's football and women s vollev -
ball. "Last year I got to travel around thecoun

ing course, the stu

Then the student

Blair remembers
her first time on the
air: "At three in the
morning, \ou don't
even know if any
one is listening. But
it's such an adrena
line rush to he on
the air — it's like
impromptu perfor

no script, no safety

the studio playing
your music."
According to the
music directors at
KZSI', 'he station
does not train peo
ple for commercial
radio because non
commercial radio
runs on a complete
ly different path.
"In commercial
radio, the I)J does

nothing — he has a script, people manning the
control board and a playlist that someone else
chooses. On KZSIJ the DJ picks the music,
works the control board and plans what he is
going to say on the air," said Blair.
Blair also explained that the station is open
to anyone who wants to be a part of KZSIJ
'We are looking for enthusiastic people with a
passion for learning about music," she said.
Smurph, a member of the community who
moved to k/Sl from another station, said
that his old station was strict about the type ol
music he could play on the air. "You get a lot of
freedom here." he said. "The people are very

Q: What is this stuff you're playing?
A: Oh, it's an offshoot of grindcore, hut it's actually slow,
sludgy grindcore — atypical for this band, which usually plays
powerviolence-type music:
Huh? And so begins my conversation with Elliott Lange, a
disc jockey volunteering at Stanford's student-run radio station,
KZSU. Before I can nod my head, he eagerly leads me to a shelf
of C Ds, pulling out one CD after another as he continues to tell
me about the local powerviolence band out ol Redwood City
that he plays on his weekly program.
"You have to listen to this." he told me as he dragged me to
;i sicrco ' This band. Spa//., is so amazing." Lange drummed on
his knees, played .111 guitar, and for a moment I was afraid that
he has retreated into grmdeore la-la land, leaving the poor ig
noi ant reporter nodding to unfamiliar music, But never missing
a heat, he finally looks up at me with a childish gi in.
"Sorry I just gel so excited when someone even exhibits the
slightest interest in the music I play," he laughed.
Even though I had never heard Spa// or grindcore, 1 was
moved by the enthusiasm 111 Lange's voice as he shared his
music with me. Such energy and passion for music is evident in
all the DJs at k/.SIJ, whether they are plavmg grindcore or

Latin American folk songs or hip-hop. Disc jockeys at KZSU
plan and produce their own programs, making their shows cre
ative outlets for sharing their musical passions with the Stan
ford community.
' KZSU strives to teach the people in and around Stanford
about music that may not be easily accessible. Everyone at the
station is so passionate about the music they play; just ask any
DJ about why they like a song, and they would love to explain,"
said one of the music directors, Hannah Blair, a sophomore
who has been with the station since the beginning of her fresh
man year.

of student and community involvement, makes the radio sta
