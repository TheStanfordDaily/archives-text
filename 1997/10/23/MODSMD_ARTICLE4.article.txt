### Sharon Armstrong 
Students, colleagues anil friends
gathered in the courtyard of Old
I Jnion on Wednesday to remember
assistant I nglish professor and loi
met Casa /.apata resident fellow
l.ora Romero. She died last 1 riday
in Pacilica at the age of 37.
In front of a large altar draped
with Romero's favorite things
sunflowers, nail polish, candles hear
ing pictures of I'ancho Villa and a
picture of Romero herself, fiances
Morales, the director ol I I C'entro
( hicano, welcomed the audience to
the memorial service.
Members of the Stanford com
munity offered their memories of
their professor, adviser and friend.
James Montoya, Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs, spoke of
Romero's Irce-spiritedncss and her
care and compassion for everyone
around her. "I.ora's still taking care
of us, that I know,"he said.
Junior Ixlelina Uurciaga, a for

met stall member of Casa /apata,
recalled a time when Romero gave
her a toy chicken alter she recovered
from a bout ol chicken pox. "I didn't
always understand the jokes she was
making," Burciaga said with ;i smile.
Ramon Saldivar, vice provost for
undergraduate education and pro
lessor of I-nglish, spoke ol Romero's
bravery in defending her work and
her confidence to question the
tenets of modern academia.
I le asked the audience to consid
er a quotation of Romero's, printed
on cards that were distributed to the
crowd, about her hopes for an acad
cmic future open to more discussion
and consideration of minority cul
tures.
"What is worthy of studying?"
Saldivar asked. "Her words call on
us to question that." I le added that
"the best way we can honor l.ora is
by acting on what she taught us."
Romero's impact on her students
and her work in acidemia was
praised as much as her impact on her
residents and friends.
"She allowed me the space to let
my ideas ramble and come into
shape," said Alicia Ciamez, a doctor
al student of Romero's.
Romero earned a bachelor's in
English from Stanford in IMS 1 and
her doctorate in English from UC-
Berkeley in 1988. After teaching at
Princeton University and the IJni
versity of Texas at Austin, Romero
returned to Stanford to teach in
1993.
"She was an outstanding young
scholar," said Terry Castle, chair of
the English Department. Romero
taught courses on topics in 19th and
20th century American fiction, but
her special focus was on women, mi
nority, and ('hicano writers.

Romero's scholarship in Ameri
can literature recently culminated in
a book, which is scheduled for re
lease next week titled "Home
fronts."
Although many of Romero's col
leagues and students offered memo
ries of her personal and academic
achievements and accomplishments
at Stanford, some offered accounts
of her hardships as well. "Lora also
knew and lived with hatred and bias
found at Stanford," said Luis Fraga,
an assistant professor of political sci
ence. "Narrow-mindedness caused
her much intellectual, but also much
personal pain," he added.
liut English major Lrnesto Mar
tinez. a senior and former theme as
sociate in ( asa /apata and a student
of Romero's, closed the memorial
service with some words of encour
agement for current minority pro
fessors and in memory of Romero,
stating, "Your success is part of my
success."
