## Kami Lyle Blue Cinderella 
### 
She's a little bit of Shawn Colvin,
Lisa Loeb and Betty Boop all mixed
into one. She has the stereotypical
woman singer / songwriter voice
that Shawn Colvin has mastered, the
whiny, sentimental, mushy lyrics
that Lisa Loeb made me hate (You
say... I only hear what I want t0...
waah), and a little bit of Betty's Boop
"boop-bee-doop."
And Kami Lyle plays the trumpet.
"When I tell someone I play
trumpet and sing, the usual response
is a pause... followed by the unsup
pressible grin... and then, with a
witty head tremor, the words 'at the
same time?' That's kind of one of
those tests that tells you you're at the
wrong party, and it's probably time
to leave," Lyle said in a press release.
But all of the annoying singing on
the album can be ignored or gotten
used to. Lyle's songs themselves, irre
spective of her singing voice, are in
novative and cute, and each have that
studio ensemble sound that reminds
me little of (why do I keep mention
ing this woman?) Kickie Lee Jones'
early stuff. In short, jazz is clearly one
of l.yle's influences. But that's no

wonder. She studied jazz at the ho
mophonic B-school on the other
coast — Berkelee College of Music.
You can almost hear the music
theory classes that she took in some
of her songs. Not because the songs
are halting, hut because they flow
like jazz does when it's unconven
tional. The variation ofwriting styles
throughout the album is refreshing,
but not all of the writing styles are all
that good, which is a bit frustrating.
"Some of the songs on Blue Cin
derella are 'baby' songs, scribbled
during my year and a half of song
and lyrics writing classes at Berklee
('Hocus Focus,' 'Midnight Club').
Others ('Boys,' 'September,' 'Love
Me,' 'Mr. Trouble,' 'Grocery Song'
and 'Worried One') were exhumed
in Nashville, in the wee hours. 'Blue
Cinderella' and 'Polka Dots' came
from warm spring days with nothing
to do but write, drink tea and talk to
a cat about the weather," said Lyle.
Most of the music on Blue Cin
derella is at best mellow, and at worst
boring. Some of her songs, however,
actually do soar to the climax that I
look for in any piece of music

(specifically "Blue Cinderella,"
"Polka Dots" and "Mr. Moon"). But
this is not an album 1 would buy.

This is an album I would listen to if it
were playing in a friend's car on a
rainy day drive. Tape it off of some

one else and save your money for a
couple of books.
