# Jonathan Fire Eater
## Wolf Songs For Lambs 
### 
Jonathan Fire Eater is a shambling Victorian horror; the bastard spawn
of a London dandy and an ash-stained wastrel. The organ-based rock of
its latest album "Wolf Songs lor l,ambs, which sounds like Pavement
doing the soundtrack to "Nosferatu," starts and shudders as it powered by
lightning bolts and Mesmer.
Walter Martin's moviehouse Farfisa organ floats with a ghostly
grandeur over the stuttering drums of Matt Barrick, whose jerking but ir
repressible rhythms invoke images of Irog legs twitching in closed vials ot
saline.
Standing astride the gears of this dark satanic mill is singer Stewart Lup

ton, who intones each word with the desperately sensual come-on of a
carnival barker and the ink-stained leer of an Kdward Gorey drawing.
Smiling with a mouth full of soot, he offers a world of beautiful
freaks and deadly soirees: a world where the bored socialite ot "The
Shape of Things Which Never Come," mutters with vague disappoint
ment and a doffed top hat, "We tried to be strong and carry on / but the
party just seemed doomed / there wasa girl on the floor with her heart
beat gone / and death so kills the room."
And indeed each song seems animated by a type of lebestod, a glee
fully perverse necrophilia that finds death and rot hopelessly exciting.
In the same track he explains "It was a magazine party in an old lich
yard / a girl had a seizure there / she was putting on her makeup in the
club car / there was makeup everywhere."
Intermingled with this graveyard ardor is a delight in the sell-pro
jection of theater — the notion that a little makeup can transform the
monster with the flapping jaws into a prim dandy with top hat and
cane. The opening track "When the Curtain Calls For You" seems
smothered by the winding sheet of Martin's organ and Lupton's mut
tering until, with a startling key change, the curtains open up, the singer
declares "We'll shoot the film!," and the album is on its way.
Despite this theatrical posturing, the band never forgets that the
heart-stopping joy and pulse-quickening terror of rock music comes
from its ability to enact an uncontrollable desire: the Frankensteinian
id stumbling across the endless Arctic tundra ot the soul.
Thus, the album's best songs are its full-out rock numbers, which
pulse with a type of obscene vitality. In "Bipolar Summer" Lupton finds
the perfect mixture of crackling ice and putrid fecundity with the lines
"Flying first class on a 747 / I've got magazines and gin! / I'm reading a
clubber s guide, baby, to Berlin /1 can see the glaciers and the dorsal
fins."
When he follows this with the trite platitude "We're all some moth
er's baby" it seems less a realization of commonality than a shudder at
the sexual frenzy of human reproduction.
With its wicked Victorian smirk and its industrial revolution grime,
Jonathan Fire Eater is the perfect alternative to the moribund world of
modern pop music. By re-animating the corpse ot classic rock, they
create a monster that reeks of the heady nausea of formaldehyde, and
yet is marvelously, grotesquely alive.
