# Chumbawamba
## Tubthumper 
### 
Well, if nothing else, you've got to love the
name of this band. Luckily for the band itself,
though, the music is just as fun to listen to as the
name is to say.
Chumbawamba has been around for years
but is just now bursting into the American
music scene. Its new album, "Tubthumper,"
breaks through the bounds of main stream pop
and rock music, with a sound that is distinctly
— well, it's distinctly something, probably
Chumbawamba.
The album is riddled with snippets of songs,
speech clips and crazily synthesized effects, all
linked together to create a complete collage of
various instruments and music styles. Hints of
everything from ska to techno to hard rock per
vade the album and are complemented with

political undertones and melodically solid vo
cals.
This is not just another group of people
looking to make a raucous statement amid a
bunch of guitar noise and yelling. This is a
group of people looking to make a raucous
statement amid quality mixing, saucy horn
solos, powerful guitar chords — and some
yelling. But it's constructive, meaningful
yelling. Really.
1 he album starts with a song which is quick
ly becoming everybody and their mother's
theme song, "Tubthumping." Most probably
don't know the song by name, but by the cho
rus: "I get knocked down / but I get up
again / You're never going to keep me down!"
This is a song that needs to be played loudly and

in an open area, where people can jump around
and go nuts. But then again, most of the album
is like that.
Although "Tubthumping" is about getting
drunk, most of the other songs on the album
have slightly more meaningful messages. On
"One by one," the group begins mockingly with
few church choir-style verses, singing, "Pontius
Pilate came to our town... We asked him to
help but he just turned around / I le's the loader
of the union now."
In"The big Issue," an a cappella beginning
quickly moves into a rocking beat with bright
horns as backup. The song pauses and moves
into a trance-ambiance tone, right before the
chorus is sweetly sung in sarcasm: "This is the
girl who lost the house / Which paid to the man

who put up the rent / And threw out the girl to /
Feather his own sweet home."
The lyrics on the album as a whole are
gloomy, but in a playful mockery of modern so
cietal life. The music is driven by hard, quick
beats at times, but it slows down intermittently
for trumpet solos and sound bytes from who
knows where.
On another angry but playful song, "(iood
Ship l.ilestyle," vocalist l.on Watts proclaims,
"This is the I iood Ship lifestyle / All my
friends jumped ship /1 elect me the captain,"
while the chorus repeats: "I'm going
nowhere."
But (Ihumbawamba is going somewhere,
and they're not likely to sink any time soon.
