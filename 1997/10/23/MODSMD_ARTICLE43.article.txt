# SOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS
## Plastic Seat Sweat 
### 
The masters of psychobilly have done it
again.
Southern Culture On The Skids'
(5.C.0.T.5.) newest album, "Plastic Seat
Sweat," is a rare combination of midtempo
surf, glorified rockabilly and intelligent psy
chedelia that turns a comedic genre into a
field for serious musicianship.
S.C.O.T.S. is no late-comer to psychobilly,
with more than half a dozen lull length al
bums and innumerable 7," 10" and EPs to its
credit since inception in 1983. And while
some folks may be put off by the campy
wardrobes, 1950s nostalgia and glorification
of life in the deserts of the Southwest,
S.C.O.T.S. combines good-time lyrics and
complex instrumentation into an irresistible
album.
This is not a one-trick pony they ride: the
band manages several styles of music, and all
members contribute enormously. Rick
Miller's duties include guitars, electric sitar,
banjo and vocals; Mary Huff covers the bass,
organ, piano and vocals; and Dave Hartman
finishes the trio on drums, percussion and vo
cals.
"Plastic Seat Sweat" shifts as often as a Ban
dit funnycar in a 10-lap race on a short, dirt,
oval track. It starts with the bluesy surfabilly
of "Shotgun," which flows easily into the
melodic rockabilly "Earthmover."
But the next track, "Dance With Me," de
parts into the realm of Arabic-bluegrass, with

Miller pickin' crazy on the banjo. This is tol
lowed by a luiiky country twist called "Ha
nana Puddin'," the recipe lor which can he
found at the official S.C.O.T.S web site
(www.scots.com).
S.CO.T.S. pays tribute to the Poors and
other bands ol Sot al with the on the road
taleol "40 Miles"lo Vegas," an almost standard
driving rock tune. I hey then bop through
"I ove A Rama," and trip hard on the waver
ing instrumental pop ol "I )eja Varoom."
Not a band to mince words, "Country
I unk" is exactly th.it. Who says the hillbillies
can t be postmodern? I bis is followed by the
we kest track on the album, "Strangest
\\ vs." Thoroughly unexceptional, but in no
way deficient, this song simply tails to he any
thing but mediocre.
112 ortunately, S.( I). I S. built 'Plastic Seal
Sweat" well. "Theme troin Ihe ('.heaters "
recovers the energy with its groovy, heavy surf
feel. House of bamboo," an Arabic calypso,
turns it up another notch. And "(larve That
Possum finishes the album with a return to
the rockabilly roots.
but wait, there's two bonus tracks! Hie
first is a graphic poem about, you guessed it,
plastic seat sweat. And the second is an epic
psychedelic instrumental anthem built
around a riff th.it sounds like it is played on
one ol those old pseudo-toy (iasio miniature
keyboards.
So grab a tank top, put your hair in a bee
hive, find .1 vinyl recliner and pop in "Plastic
Seat Sweat." S.CO.T.S. has won another one
for the good guys.
