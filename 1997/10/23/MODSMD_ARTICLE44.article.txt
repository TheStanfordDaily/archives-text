## More Best Of 
### 
I don't envy the
person who chooses which songs will make up
a Leonard Cohen compilation. The quality of
tus work has been so consistent over his 30-year
recording career that it's hard to choose songs
to leave out.
The new CD, "More Best Of," limits its scope
to his last three efforts, "I'm Your Man" (1988),
I he Future" (1992) and "Cohen Live" (1994).
I here are also two new tracks. But "More Best
Of" is a good way to sample his recent work
without buying all three albums.

"I'm Your Man" was a
landmark for Cohen, bring
ing him renewed acclaim and
success. It also presented
Cohen's recent musical style

fully matured. Cone were his finger-picked
acoustic guitar lines of the 1960s and 70s, his
voice sweetly straining to sing incomparable odes
to beauty, to God, to sex and to his own survival.
In the '80s and '90s, Cohen's lyrics have kept
his unique blend of the specific and the time
less, the apocalyptic and the dryly hilarious.
But his voice, now low and gravely, is set against
more complex arrangements of guitars, key
boards, drums, violin and several very talented
female backup singers. The rest of "More Best
Of" shares this style.
The new CI) arguably collects the best songs
from the three albums. From the darkly humor

ous "Everybody Knows" to the exquisite "Take
This Waltz," "I'm Your Man" is well represented.
Likewise, songs from"The Future" run the
gamut from forgiving and hopeful ("Anthem")
to scourging ("The Future"). The 1994 live re
lease also contributes renditions of some older
songs, including his quintessential "Suzanne."
The two new songs appear at the end.
"Never Any Good" joins the pantheon of
Cohen songs of farewell. It lacks the classic (eel
of his early "I ley, That's No Way '!<> Say (iood
bye" or "So Long, Marianne," but with its horn
fanfare this song adds a playful touch to the cat
alog of goodbyes.
When Cohen sings "I can't forget where my
lips have been/ Those holy hills, that deep
ravine," he almost pronounces 'been' as 'bean'
to make it rhyme. "I was never any good at lov
ing you /1 was just a tourist in your bed look

ingat the view'( lohen's nc h gift lies as much in
his humor as it does in his gravity.
The final song, only one minute long and
spoken by a computerized voice named Victo
ria, is an eerie one-minute piece called "The
Cireat Hvent." The somber effect is heightened
by the contrast between the boisterous "Never
Any (iood" and the funereal organ playing be
hind Victoria's voice.
"More Best Of" presents 13 tracks of won
derful music by Leonard Cohen. It's a great
place to start for new listeners of his work, but
it only scratches the surface of his extensive
repertoire. (lohen has made three albums since
the 11>76l 1 >76 release of his "best Of" compilation
for which this collection does not account, but
the only remedy would be to compile an even
larger volume.
