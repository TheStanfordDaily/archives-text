## The
						Devil's Advocate 
### 
Casting call: need someone to play Old
Scratch, the devil himself. Jack Nichol
son already did it, Kevin Spacey still not
long enough in the tooth— a Satan-in-train
ing. The easy answer is Al Pacino who can do a
part like this in his sleep.
Okay, but who should play a hotshot lawyer
who is so good, so smooth, so cocky and con
vincing that juries part before him like the Red
Sea? The filmmakers behind "The Devil's Advo
cate" came up with the surprising choice of
Keanu Reeves, notoriously mockable for his lack
of acting skills and unfortunate valley guy accent.
The strength of this movie is that Reeves al
most pulls it off, and it is fun to watch him in
the strongest performance of his career. The
fatal weakness of this movie is that it tries to do

a lot of things both thematically and visually,
and as a whole it doesn't succeed at all.
The premise lies very close to that of "The
Firm," except that instead of wily mafiosos, the
young lawyer in question ends up working for
Beezlebub and facing the fires of Hell. 1 know
I'm not giving away a state secret with this one
since the trailers made Pacino's role quite clear.
Pacino plays Lucifer as a charmer named John
Milton, a not-so-subtle reference to "Paradise
Lost," who manipulates Kevin Lomax (Reeves)
and his wife into accepting a life of luxury and
power parties at his firm in New York.
Charli/e Theron, as Maryanne Lomax, is
striking and disturbing as the living embodi
ment of the degradation of a soul and a spirit.
She, unlike her husband, sees the unraveling of

their lives being done by Milton, and she is ef
fective as she slowly gives into the horror she
witnesses.
Reeves and Pacino actually play off each
other well, though Pacino's cackling is over the
top — we understand that being Satan involves
having a lot of debaucherous fun. Director Tay
lor Hackford ("An Officer and a Gentleman")
doesn't raise any new ideas about evil or the
Milennium, though it appears that he is trying
to. Biblical symbolism is thrown around left
and right and Renaissance artwork seems to be
the favorite of every lawyer in New York.
The treatment of women in the film is also
frustrating. The variety of female characters are
limited to soulless housewives who are endless
ly shopping and soulless seductresses who are

endlessly disrobing. Considering these options,
it is no wonder Maryanne Lomax loses her grip
on sanity.
Hackford thankfully minimizes the fire
and-brimstone special effects, and the final
confrontation between Lomax and Milton is a
clever verbal sparring, which finally gives Paci
no a chance to display his talent. Unfortunate
ly, the ending is ultimately disappointing and
makes the two hour-plus length seem like a
waste of time.
Who could possibly take a strong cast and
solid performances, a somewhat clever script,
and a successful director, yet end up with a fin
ished product that has so little to offer? Could it
be.... Satan?
