# I Know What You Did Last Summer
## 
### 
•yennifer Love Hewitt should
I not be allowed to act in
I movies. Nor should Sarah
Michelle Cellar. Nor maybe, for
that matter, should anyone with
three names. Something about
them just isn't right.
While both actresses are com
petent on the small screen, to say
they are both totally incompetent
in their latest film, "I Know What
You Did Last Summer," is an uti
derstatement of huge propor
tions. But hey, maybe the acting is
supposed to be really poor —
maybe it's all part of the camp of
this completely trite horror
movie. Maybe the characters are
all supposed to be really, really
annoying. Who the hell knows?
This movie is so unrelentingly
and unfailingly lame that it's dif

ficult to decide whether it's self
consciously bad (i.e. really, really
cool in that oh so-satirical way)
or just completely unaware of its
stupidity (i.e. a one-star movie —
hey, that's it!).
Actually, it doesn't even mat
ter. Some of the lines are so
cringe-worthy that either way
this movie is just really poor. This
(lick is an adaptation of a popular
'80s teen novel of the same name,
which centers around four North
Carolina high school seniors
who, while driving drunk, hit a
man crossing the street.
Believing they've killed him,
they dispose of the body and
promise to keep their horrible se
cret amongst themselves. They at
tempt to get on with their lives, but
the weight of the secret changes

their relationships for the worse.
Then, a year later, they begin
receiving notes and veiled threats
about the previous summer's ac
cident, and the tun begins. Well,
it's fun for us, because we know
that their deaths are imminent,
and that's about the only comfort
in this totally predictable, totally
unscary movie.
Cive me a break, these people
are being stalked by a fisherman
in a rain hat who carries around a
grappling hook and can walk
faster than they can run. They
don't deserve to make it. While
the ending is actually a surprise,
it's pretty much too late for the
movie to redeem itself. You're left
wanting to say, "Is that it? Is that
what I sat through this for?"
On leaving "I Know What You

Did Last Summer," I thought to myself, I
remember reading this book in the fourth
grade. I thought it was really scary and re-

ally engrossing. Then I realized that was
because I was 9 years old.
