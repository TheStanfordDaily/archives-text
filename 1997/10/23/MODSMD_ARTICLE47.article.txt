# Going All the Way

### 
Sonny, a thin, mumbling and fidgety
young man played masterfully by Jeremy
Davies ("Spanking the Monkey"), pairs
up with an ex-high school jock named Gun
ner in "Going All the Way," an amusing and
well crafted coming-of-age tale of two recent
ly discharged veterans of the Korean War.
The film, which is novelist Dan Wake
field's screen adaptation of his 1970 best-sell
er, is set in the staid and relatively uneventful
Indianapolis of 1954. Through the reluctant

eyes of Sonny, we are introduced to his in
sanely doting mother and the rest of his
square family, the wood-paneled station
wagon and the dainty, wholesome and whol
ly conventional suburban home. It is clear
from Sonny's look of disgust that tension is
inevitable.
Gunner (Ben Affleck of "Chasing Amy") is
Sonny's ticket to a more liberated and socially
adjusted life. With his smooth, cool demeanor
and his clean-shaven youth fulness, heembod
ies the social ease and confidence that Sonny
longs for.
At the time of his acquaintance with Sonny,

Gunner is attempting to reinvent himself as
sophisticated and "inner-directed." As part of
this new project, which he explains in terms of
trite but convincingly delivered notions of
Zen Buddhism, Gunner is no longer interest
ed in hanging out with the jocks and instead,
prefers misfits like Sonny. He imagines that,
while he was screwing around with the foot
ball team, guys like Sonny were immersed in
soulful contemplation. In truth, Sonny occu
pied much of his time masturbating, but no
matter.
Though Sonny and Gunner do spend some
of their time together attempting to better
themselves intellectually, it is clear that
women are their true focus. Early on, we are
privy to Sonny's infatuation with the rear of
Gunner's sexy mom (Lesley Ann Warren). As
the movie progresses, we watch Sonny's lust

ful gaze survey all the women that pass before
him except Buddy (Amy Locane), the cheerful
girl-next-door who secretly cajoles Sonny into
sex at every opportunity.
"Going All the Way" rides the superb act
ing of Jeremy Davies, who squirms and stam
mers his way to a nearly flawless performance.
The cinematography is, at times, dizzying and
irritating, owing perhaps to director Mark
Pellington's music-video roots; there are,
however, some effective sequences, particu
larly the fragmented and jerky episode in the
bathroom that captures Sonny's drunk and
anxious state of mind.
If you are looking for an amusing, inven
tive comedy with a serious edge that boasts
uniquely crafted characters and fine acting,
"Going All the Way" is your film.
