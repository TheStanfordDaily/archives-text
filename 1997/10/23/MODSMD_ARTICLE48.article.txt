# Telling Lies in America
## 
### 
a idling Lies in America,"
starring Kevin Bacon,
Brad Renfro and Max
imillian Schell, premiered seven
months ago at the Cleveland Film
Festival. Finally, it is going to be re
leased nationwide. The story may
not be the most attention-grabbing
one, but this film is excellent
nonetheless.
Bacon plays Billy Magic, a radio-
DJ who enjoys only medium success,
but is living the high life despite his
rather meager income. When he ar
rives in Cleveland, he starts an on-air

contest to select the most popular
high school student at an upscale
private school. Karchy Jonas (Ren
fro) is intrigued by the medium of
radio, but because he is the son of an
immigrant factory worker, he enjoys
no popularity at his school. To win
the contest anyway, he sends in hun
dreds of nominations for himself,
each one signed with a different stu
dent's name.
When Karchy wins the contest, he
is invited to meet Magic, and the two
start discussing whether Karchy
cheated or not. Despite the fact that

he is a bad liar, Karchy refuses to
admit that he was wrong. Magic ad
mires his stubbornness, and the two
seem to become good friends. Fur
thermore, Karchy gets a well-paying
job as assistant to Magic. Slowly,
however, Karchy starts to under
stand the real reason why Magic be
friended him.

When the movie opened, I
immediately thought that this
was going to be an excessively
cheap production that would
be a bore to watch after seeing
some of the recent high budget
films. By the end of the movie
however, it had become clear
that the production values of
the movie improve as Karchy
makes the transition from a
lonely immigrant to a well ail

justed American citizen.
While Bacon is probably the best
known cast member, it is Ren fro
who steals the show with his touch
ing portrayal of an adolescent who is
both trying to gain the love of a girl
and the acceptance of the people at
his school. His struggle to say the
English "th" sound was particularly

amusing as it was present throughout
the film.
The screenplay by Joe Eszterhas is
interesting because both Karchy and
Magic undergo drastic changes until
they meet each other halfway. Macon
changes from a purposeless crook
who only cares about himself, into a
man with values. Karchy obviously
changes into a well-integrated
teenager who has overcome his infe
riority complex due to his back
ground.
I may have enjoyed this movie so
much because I can't say "th" myself.
However, " Telling I ies in America"
is a great movie despite the fact that
it was made with a very low budget.
We may hear more about this movie
when the Oscars roll around again.
