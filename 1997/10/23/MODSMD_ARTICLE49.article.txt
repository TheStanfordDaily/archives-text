# Playing God
## 
### 
previews for "Playing
God" suggest this film is
JL merely a vehicle for "X-Files"
star David Duchovny, and unfortu
nately it fails to be much more. The
opening sequence has Duchovny
entering a sleazy L.A. bar, explaining
his situation in a "hard-boiled"
voice-over so ridiculous it sounds
like a parody of film noir. From this
ominous start the film continually
grasps at a self-conscious "coolness"
that it rarely achieves, and it mostly
manages to entertain only through
the humorous extent of its failure.
Duchovny's character, Eugene
Sands, is in search of heroin. Al
though this nasty habit caused him

to lose his medical license 10
months earlier for operating under
the influence, Sands can't resist the
opportunity to perform an im
promptu operation on a gangster
who is gunned down beside him.
Sands' impressive feat garners
the attention of Raymond Blossom
(Timothy Hutton), a crime lord as
bizarre as his name. Blossom's offer
to reinstate Sands as a handsomely
paid doctor for his henchmen in
volves Sands in a chaotic adventure
that includes perverted FBI agents,
hippie gunmen and Blossom's gor
geous girlfriend, Claire (Angelina
Jolie). The result is like an episode of
"EH" directed by Quentin Tarantino
on a really bad day.
The film's biggest flaw is that it
can't decide whether it is an action
thriller or a screwball comedy. The

forays into comedy are occasionally
successful, but they often under
mine subsequent attempts at
drama. Duchovny expertly delivers
some clever one-liners, but he car
ries this same sarcastic, dead-pan at
titude into the rest of his acting,
making it impossible for the audi
ence to believe he is in any real dan
ger or emotional turmoil. He has
the charm and star presence to
amuse, but you never really care
about his character.
Hutton, sporting a horrible
bleach job, has moments of in
spired lunacy as an eccentric, short
tempered counterfeiter. He is often
so strange he is funny, but too weird
to inspire the slightest bit of fear.
Jolie has the pouty-mouthed
femme fatale attitude and look, but
she isn't given much convincing di
alogue to work with. The array of
secondary characters — agents,
thugs and surfer druggies — are re
duced to meaningless caricatures in

desperate, cliched appeals for
laughs.
Other than occasional chuckles
and an attractive star, "Playing
God" has little to offer. Even die

hard Duchovny tans should proha
bly resign themselves to wat<
him on the small screen lor the time
being.
