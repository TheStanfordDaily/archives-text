# Flying high
## Meditation club doesn't have many worries 
### Liz Brooks 
Imagine being airborne, soaring above bu
colic scenery or fluttering about cityscapes like
Mercury with his winged feet. While many of
us fantasize about flying, members of the Tran
scendental Meditation Club of Stanford aspire
to actually do so through techniques outlined
by their spiritual sister, yogic levitation.
Since the mid 19705, the Transcendental
Meditation Club has been active on campus,
said John Black, director of the Palo Alto tran
scendental mediation center. Currently, the
Stanford group, headed by medical student
Rakesh Nigam. has about eight members.
While anyone can join, the student organi
zation requires new members to take a $345
introductory course on transcendental medi
tation from the series of seven classes. Black
said.
Founded over 25 years ago by Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi, after he spent 10 years in seclu
sion with Guru Dev. transcendental medita
tion developed as a relaxation technique to be

practiced "effortlessly" several times a day by
silting with closed eyes.
Mahesh thereafter set up centers around
the country and even created an academic in
stitution, Maharishi School ol Management, in
Fairfield. lowa, that offers traditional disci
plines with a transcendental twist.
"Transcendental meditation is a mental
technique, not a religion." said Rhoda Orhm
Johnson, leader of the Sea ( ove, Ma. division.
What sets transcendental meditation apart
from other types of relaxation methods is that
it does not require concentration, according i<>
Johnson.
" Transcendental meditation uses the nat
ural tendency of the mind." Johnson said.
Each student learns the approach from a
teacher who supplies a personalized mantra to
repeat, based on different sound levels, during
a restful state. When asked about how these
mantras differ. Johnson said. " I his is a conli
dential matter. We need to preserve the stu
dents, so they don't go mantra swap
ping."
Yogic Hying is an extension of
the transcendental meditation pro
gram aimed at teaching individuals
to reach their inner potential by
using propelling processes, Black
said. He cited three distinct and pro
gressive stages of yogic flying: hop
ping, levitation and eventually actu
al flying. The demonstration given
in Jordan Hall several weeks ago
highlighted the hopping technique.
"I have never seen any credible
evidence that theTMerscan levitate
| in the common usage of the term],"
said Richard S. Broughton, Direc
tor of the Institute of Parapsycholo
gy at Duke University.
A few years ago. Ken Eppley, a
theoretical physicist at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, con

ducted a study of literature citing
meditation methods in relationship
to anxiety levels among individuals.
Eppley said he found no differ
ence among the approaches except
for transcendental meditation,
which had twice the effect of stress
reduction in comparison to other
approaches.
Transcendental meditation "ap
peared to be more effective than
other techniques," Eppley stated
matter-of-factly. "It may be related
to the effortless nature of I'M."
Other advocates of this approach
said it has a whole slew of benefits.
From tension reduction to a cure-all
for drug addiction, Johnson said that
the technique helps practitioners.
Nancy Olmera, a spokesperson
for Cult Awareness Network, as
sured that the practice is safe. "We
get very few calls about transcen
dental meditation," she said. "It's
mostly [complaints about) funda
mentalist Christians."
