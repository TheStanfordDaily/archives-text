# Twilight of the Golds
## 
### 
Finally, we have a seri
ous look at homosex
uality. After the out
landish farce performances
in"The Birdcage" and"In
and Out," there are intelli
gent and seemingly realis
tic gay characters — one of
which is played by Brendan
1 raser, a far cry from
"(ieorge of the Jungle" —
in"The Twilight of the
Golds." This art-house film
has a chance of garnering
attention come Oscar time.
First, the movie-based
on-a-play dutifully intro
duces us to the main play

ers. Phyllis (Faye Dunaway)
and Walter (Garry Mar
shall) Gold are the conserv
ative, wealthy parents of
two children. One, David
Gold (Fraser), has a live-in
boyfriend (Sean O'Bryan)
and maintains a strong,
though strained, relation
ship with the Golds. The
other, Suzanne (Jennifer
Beals), has recently married
a geneticist named Rob
Stein (Jon Tenney).
The dilemma of the
movie — whether to abort
a child destined to be ho
mosexual — drives us in

anticipation of the articu
late arguments placed by
the daughter's family and
friends, one of whom is
RosieO'Donnellasa jovial
co-worker. Suzanne's un
born child is used by her
husband as a subject for
his laboratory's newly de
veloped prenatal screen
ing. When Rob comes
home and informs his wife
that the child will turn out
to be a gay male, Suzanne
faces a whirlwind of advice
and veiled niceties.
It appears that there
can only be three results to
her problem: have and raise
the child, abort the child or
endure a miscarriage.

While polite and loving to
ward David, the Golds both
voice a concern for
Suzanne's unborn child
and her own resilience. The
parents accept homosexu
ality in cold theory but re
ject it when forced to reveal
their true feelings. This may
be the ease for most mid
dle-class Americans as well.
Understandably, David
contrasts his parents' views
by pushing his sister to give
life to the boy. What would
have happened if the (lolds
had aborted David?
Suzanne faces these gut
wrenching problems
alone, since her husband
has closed into a tortoise
like shell. We genuinely
share her pain, and it is a
feeling that no audience
has felt before. Her situa
tion is one for the ages.

The film's issues, rang
ing from prenatal testing to
abortion to gender identi
fication, have particular
relevance to our own age of
technological advance
ment and blurred identity.
Included in the movie is a
look at the Human
Genome Project, which is
currently trying to map
out every human gene.
The movie presents a
time when homosexuality
can be detected by an
analysis of the fetal cells. II
and when this day comes,
ethical questions like those
eloquently presented in
"The Twilight of the
Golds" will surface and
plague medical doctors
and parents alike.
