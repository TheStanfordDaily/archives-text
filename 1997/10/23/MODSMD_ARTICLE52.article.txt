## Echoes from the Void 
### Zachary Roberts editorial staff 
For a school that used to host several Grateful
I )cad shows every year, Stanford has fallen into a
remarkably large funk in terms of throwing con
certs.
So why have recent years been somewhat de
void of major rock acts?
Let's see. Could it be that the Stanford Concert
Network has failed to do it's job?
Last year the illustrious concert network
brought us Beck. And Cake. And... did 1 mention
( .ike? What S.C.N, seems to have forgotten is that
those bands appeal to the same people. Hello, this
is Stanford, not the MTV music video awards.

Last spring, together with Rinc-A-Delt, S.C.N,
brought us Salmon and Souls of Mischief. Well
done, folks. Iwo forgettable bands with sagging
record sales.
1 he best show of the year was the Stanford Jazz
Orchestra with guest drummer Louis Bellson. And
who promoted that?... the music department.
The year before last, S.C.N, hosted Shawn
Colvin for the popsters, Buddy Guy for the blues
lovers and Jesus and Mary Chain for everyone else.
At least Buddy Guy can put on a show.
Rinc-A-Delt was an even bigger hit. Big Head
Todd and Dave Matthews were in town together,
with an open date on their calendar. But S.C.N, de
cided it didn't want to spend the money. And we
fund these guys with our special fees?
Let me tell you, Canvas (former Labrosse-King,
the epic Stanford fraternity band) threw a hell of a
show.

Another thing that gets me is the abuse of Frost
Amphitheater. Frost is the largest venue on the
peninsula, after Shoreline Amphitheater in Moun
tain View. Who's played there in the 19905?...
Vertical 1 lorizon. And Michael Gorbachev.
The excuse of the concert network is that Frost
costs $25,(XX) to rent for a night. 1 low can they not
realize that if they got a good hand for the show,
they'd make back double the cash?
So far this year, the concert network has
brought us... nobody. Anybody guess what
they're waiting for? That's right, there's a rumor
that the Wallflowers will come through, with the
Counting Crows. Oh wait, they played Shoreline
this summer.
The only act on campus so far this fall was the ge
nius Ray Charles, courtesy of Lively Artsat Stanford.
What's that? You've never heard of Lively Arts?
1 ively Arts brings an amazing array of shows to

campus every year. This year the organization is
bringing 31 different acts to campus including the
Kronos Quartet (Jan. 14), The Chieftains (April
24) and the Empire Brass Quintet (May 1).
Despite its trouble publicizing events, the 1 ive
ly Arts sets an excellent model for what the concert
network could be. And although tickets can be
pricey, day-of-show tickets are half price for stu
dents.
You want the concert network to change its
ways? Call them and complain, at 723 1(i35. You
want more information on I ively Arts? Call them
at 723-2551. Or check out its next show, the Native
American dance / music troup Makoche, this Fri
day at 8 p.m. at 1 )inkelspiel Auditorium.
You want to hear the Jazz Orchestra bring
down the house? See them with guest vibraphonist
bobby Hutchinson on Nov. 14.it 8 p.m. at 1 )inkel
spiel Auditorium.
