## Chicano research center still looking to fill opening for director 
### Berra Yazar 
The Center for ( hieano Research still lacks a
director, clue, in large part, to a shortage of
tenured Latino faculty members on campus.
The center, which promotes studies related to
the Chicano/ Latino communities, would benefit
greatly if the director position were tilled, said
Law Prof. Miguel Mendez. a member of the cen
ter's faculty advisory board.
However, according to Mendez, the center
does not have many options from which tochoose.
The director must be a tenured professor, but be
cause there are currently only 14 tenured ( hieano
faculty members, there has not been a large
enough pool of qualified candidates, Mendez said.
The center does have an associate director
Maria Chacon, academic research and program-

ming officer of the School of I lumanities and Sci
ences but she is not tenured. The faculty advi
sory board determines the center's policy.
Of the 14 tenured faculty, four have been di
rectors in the past, two are on medical leave and
the rest are busy with other projects, Mendez ex
plained.
He said he hopes the University will increase
the number of tenured Latino faculty to at least
50. He pointed out that Stanford currently has
about 1,000 faculty members.
The center gives and receives grants to enable
faculty members to work with graduate and un
dergraduate students on Chicano research. Its
main goal is to increase the number of Chicano re
searchers on campus.
( 'hildren's health issues and Latino farm work
ers are among the most popular research subjects.

The center also acts as a forum for professors to
present their research ideas, Mendez said.
"The most important thing is to keep the cen
ter alive, because it makes Stanford a more attrac
tive place for the Latino community," Mendez
added.
The center is not involved with all Chicano
community issues on campus, such as the Univer
sity's policy on serving California table grapes.
Mendez pointed out that even though the center
might not be affiliated with such issues, researchers
do conduct related research in such areas as the ef
fects of pesticides on Latino farm workers.
The center has recently been affiliated with the
Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Eth
nicity. The degree of the affiliation will be deter
mined by the Center for Chicano Research's
board in the future.
