For over 150 years, Russians have considered Eugene Onegin to be the highest peak
in the vast, snowy mountain chain of their literature Written as a series of sparkling
tetrameter sonnets that lurch unpredictably back and forth between a sad story line
and wittv, often self-referential meditations by the author on poetrv, life, and love,
Eugene Onegin represents a supreme challenge for literary translators. James Falen s
recent version is the most fluid and lyncal translation yet made into English, and with
genial fidelity it captures the spirit of the onginal Russian verse. Come savor this
unparalleled gem as performed in English (with bits of the original Russian thrown in
now and then), for the sheer linguistic and literary pleasure that it affords
