Tough alcohol standard endorsed
WASHING lON (AP) — The Clinton administration
endorsed a national drunken-driving standard yesterday that
would force two-thirds of the states to toughen their laws or
lose federal highway money.
A hill pending in Congress would make all states set their
drunken-driving thresholds at a blood-alcohol content of 0.08
percent. I wo-thirds of the states and the District of C olumbia
now use a minimum of 0.10 percent to determine when a driv
er is legally drunk.
Fifteen states already use the 0.08 percent limit. Trans
portation Secretary Rodney Slater said at a news conference.
And he said drunken driving deaths had declined an average
of 16 percent in the first five states to adopt the lower limit
Utah, Oregon, Maine, California and Vermont.

Fitness requirements raised for women
WASHINGTON (AP) — It may be only a small victory I'oi
women in the Army gender wars, hut the top brass ha:
declared one field of fitness parity with men situps.
Whether in basic training, at midcareer or near retirement
female soldiers will have ft) do the same number of situps a;
men to meet the Army's new fitness standards. Men will Mil
have to do more pushups and run faster than women.
It will take 53 situps, by the way, to make the cut if you're ;
recruit — male or female. A 40-year-old soldier can get In witl
38 situps, and 27 are required at age 60.
I'hesc and other adjustments are not meant just to make i
tougher for women. They also raise the standards for men u
some age categories. The idea is to modernize a system of lit
ness standards the Annv believes had become outdated.
