# Opinions
## Notebook We are large Containing multitudes 
### 
II TOOK Ml lour years to appreciate
and understand some of the more intri
cate workings of Stanford I Jniversity.
So what's changed? Well. I'm a senior.
And as a consequence ol that fact, I've
taken a hit more time to look around at
everything that's going on before it's too
late.
Also, I'm an KA. Albeit in an upperelass
dormitory (thank goodness), but I still have
been much more enthusiastic about attend
ing events and meeting new people.
Hut bv and large, the primary reason
that I keep up with what's going on at
Stanford is because I work for I lie Daily.
After 10 weeks of serving as a sports edi
tor last year and watching us win six
national championships, I moved on to
the more academic and infinitely more
political realm of ()pinions editing.
Hoy is it different on the other side.
I never really followed the ASSU. I
never knew the precise function of the
provost, the vice provost or the many,
main deans. And now these details are
vital lo good Opinions work. It's impor
tant to formulate opinions and editorials
based on the facts.
Ilie Opinions section of llie Daily
11111st filter the constant barrage of com
plaints and criticism that are directed at
the University as ;i whole. In addition to
thai it. through the editorial board, it must
formulate its own opinion on campus wide
issues.
The editorial board is comprised of
nine members, including two members of
the Stanford community at large. And its
composition changes with each volume.
As with any group of individuals, opinions
change. group dynamics shift, tensions

arise and each person's knowledge and
interests are different.
We as a group are also human, and are
subject to human error.
Most people complain when they
notice something wrong, but infrequently
stop and acknowledge when something
has been done right.
We want wheelchair access, we want
cheaper books, smaller classes, a faster
postal system, less construction, better
weather, etc. My job requires that I. along
with my co-editor Misc. sit down and find
topics lo editorialize about each and every
week. And while kudos edits are standard,
the more interesting and "valuable" edito
rials are ones that criticize, that raise eye
brows. elicit responses anil effect change.
Such is the problem with newspaper
work. I lie good stories are more often
than not bail news, li s a twisted world
that we live in when an editor will be
happy at the occurrence of a fire or the
discovery of scandal high in the ranks in
order to fill their pages with juicy lead sto
ries.
On the other hand. I he Daily has pro
vided me with a connection to the I 'niver
sitv. and I think it provides that service to
the rest of its readers as well. As is the
case with so much here at Stanford, it's up
to us to take advantage of the resources
here and utilize them.
Through all of mv roles at I lie Daily
and at the University, I've learned respon
siveness, activeness and humility.
Hut probably the most important les
son that I have learned is how to acknowl
edge weaknesses and change.
It's a lesson that I won't soon forget.
