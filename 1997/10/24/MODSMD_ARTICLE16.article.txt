## Why not... Design your own religion?

I DARRON ANDREW
/â– A ims, at the ripe old
age of 19, on the
eighth day of April, in
the year 1995 til approxi
mately 10:3H p.m., after
years of contemplation
and introspection, here-

by do begin to set forth the tenet sof IMI . ism,
which will he my personal religion.

So begins the three single spaced pages

that signaled both the end and the

beginning of a long and difficult

journey of observation and

discovery. The son ol par
ents who are both non
denominational ( hristian.
I went to Sunday school
when 1 was very young,
mostly in deference to my

great grandpa who was a min
ister. But once we moved
away from Fullerton and con-

sequently from him. that came
to an end. So as a kid. the exis

tence of God was much like the
I vaster Bunny and Santa Claus.

something I tacitly accepted but
didn't really understand.
Hnter sixth grade. Mrs. Archer opened
up my eyes to a lot of things that year. My
world view expanded beyond the confines
of Southern ("alilornia. and I began to ques
tion everything. I became a pre-pubescent
cynic with noticeable dislike for human
behavior, doubting that any (iod would be
so foolish as to create such an awful thing as
the human race. It was thus that at the age
of 12 I declared myself an atheist.
That wouldn't last long. Though I

refused to believe in the existence of (iod
until I had proof, I didn't feel comfortable
writing the big guv off until I had proot
either. I found that the title of "agnostic
was much more fitting for me, and so it was
that for the next seven years I gave God a
fair chance. It wasn't until spring quarter of
my freshman year that my questions were
answered and DAEism (my initials, with an
-ism at the end, pronounced DAY-ism) was

born.
1 find it arrogant (and
deeply troubling) to believe

that mankind is the pinnacle of
intelligence and achievement

in our unimaginably vast uni
verse. Thus it is not at all dif-

ficult for me to believe in the
existence of a higher being

or beings, which DAEism,
lor lack of a simpler word

and because it is familiar
to me, collectively calls
God. Firmly believing
that (iod does not wish to

be worshipped or feared, our rela-

tionship is one of mutual respect and

benevolence. This idea, combined with my
conception of fate and destiny, offers a com
fortable link between myself and (iod. and
this partnership forms the cornerstone of
the DAFist belief: the Covenant.
I he Covenant is my relationship with
God. and his relationship with me. In
essence, it consists of a two-way agreement.
I am bound by this Covenant to use my
powers to the best of my ability to do good
on I arth. And in turn, God will use his
powers as he best sees fit to aid me in my
project.

Why DAEism? I find no comfort in
organized i ligion. I in appalled that so
many religions teach that theirs is the one
and only true religion, that non-believers
are either damned or somehow less spiritu
ally endowed than believers. II there really
is ONE true religion, why are there so
many? This is why DAEism believes all the
world's religions, both past and present, are
commonly derived from pieces of a greater
truth that is revealed to us over time, in
more and more complex ways as mankind's
capacity to understand it evolves.
DAEism is devoted to the idea that reli
gion should exclusively be the product of
personal reflection and self-discovery. In
this sense, only I can or should be a DAEist.
It does not solicit or desire followers. It is
my own religion, and 1 am its only sub
scriber.
It is a result of my unique set of experi
ences and revelations. I cannot think of a
better way for me to relate with such a
greater power. Now. for you. this may not
be the case. If Christianity, Buddhism.
Islam. 1 linduism. Judaism or what have you
makes you spiritually content with a con
ception of your place in the larger scheme
of things, I am happy for you, as I hope you
are for me.
Different religions will work for different
people. But if you're still questioning how
and if religion should play a role in your life,
don't feel anxious, pressured or bullied.
Why not make your own?
