ASSU does not decide
awards on transcript
Your editorial on ()ct. 23 concerning the
University's transcript had a glaring mis
tatcnicnt. You state that "the ASSU Sen
ate has been charged with making the high
l\ subjective decision of which awards
should be placed on the transcript." I'his is
totally inaccurate. What appears on the
transcript is the responsibility of the Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (( AAA) and the Faculty
Senate.
I'his responsibility cannot and should
not he delegated to the ASSU Ihe ASSI
passed a resolution asking that awards be
listed on the transcript in addition to Uni
versity distinction and honors in the major.
In response to this resolution h\ the ASSI

included on the transcript. ("-AAA would

I've tried to forget about an experience
that happened earlier this summer, but it

just won't go away. I here was a small exhi
bition dI the Bloomsbury Group (Lytton,
Straehery, Roger Fry, ( live Bell. Virginia
and Vanessa Wool!) at the Stanford Uni
versity Art Gallery.
We were to meet friends in front of the
building that housed the gallery on a Sun
day. I climbed many steps, entered the
gallery and asked an attendant if there was
wheelchair access (one member of our
group was wheelchair bound.) She said
sailly that "there was none," adding that
only the day before ;i small group of physi
cally challenged people in wheelchairs from
Santa Cru/ were also turned away.
How could such a situation exist at one
ot the most affluent and prestigious uni
versities in the world? What if Steven
Hawking were to pay a visit, or any other
instructor, student or visitor for that mat
ter?
We managed to carry the wheelchair
and its occupant both up and down the
stairs — it wasn't easy. (Hoover Tower
didn't strike me as wheelchair user friend

Well, that's it.and I feel that someone

Daily contradicted
old editorial
When I read Tuesday's editorial attack
ing ASSI Senator Mike Slemmer's propos
al to eliminate ASSI) special fees, I was
somewhat nonplused. Back when I used to
work at I'lic Daily. 1 seemed to recall, the
paper had conic out clearly in favor of what
has become Slemmer's plan. I made a men

tal note to look into that question, and then
promptly forgot about it.
Forgot for a day. that is. When I saw
yesterday's Daily. 1 was not surprised to
find a letter to the editor Irom Slemmer.
What did surprise me. though, was how
familiar his prose seemed, and. after a
quick check of the Daily's archive, it
became clear why:
I think I wrote the text of Slemmer's let
ter: at least I edited it. It original!) appeared
on this page as an editorial, dated Tuesday.

since proposed.
There's a lot to be said for the legal con
cept of stare decisis, literally, "to stand by
things decided." Not only does consistency
bolster credibility, but it avoids the humilia
tion of being rebutted with one's own
words.

needs disabled access
I've tried to forget about an experience
that happened earlier this summer, but it

just won't go away. I here was a small exhi
bition dI the Bloomsbury Group (Lytton,
Straehery, Roger Fry, ( live Bell. Virginia
and Vanessa Wool!) at the Stanford Uni
versity Art Gallery.
We were to meet friends in front of the
building that housed the gallery on a Sun
day. I climbed many steps, entered the
gallery and asked an attendant if there was
wheelchair access (one member of our
group was wheelchair bound.) She said
sailly that "there was none," adding that
only the day before ;i small group of physi
cally challenged people in wheelchairs from
Santa Cru/ were also turned away.
How could such a situation exist at one
ot the most affluent and prestigious uni
versities in the world? What if Steven
Hawking were to pay a visit, or any other
instructor, student or visitor for that mat
ter?
We managed to carry the wheelchair
and its occupant both up and down the
stairs — it wasn't easy. (Hoover Tower
didn't strike me as wheelchair user friend
ly either.)
Well, that's it.and I feel that someone
should explain and remedy this situation.
What do you think?
