## Tienlon Ho Crises of identity at the local drug store 
### 
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, Clairol
markets about 17 different shades of
blonde ranging from a bleach white to a
eorn-on-the-cob. There's also black, num
bers one, two and three.
I discovered this while wandering around
Boots, an almost trendy pharmacy, in
search of ear plugs. The entire world here is
covered with little orange cones and orange
plastic fence, including the hotel lot under
construction outside my window.
Browsing through Boots's hair care
choices, I started wondering where Clairol
gets its business, because I saw no one on
that day much less any other day. much
less in any country, stand there and pick
out the perfect shade. It is as if women and
men hide until everyone else is out of sight
before they take a look at the goods, sort
of like what happens in the incontinence
aisle.
I know someone has to be buying that
stuff though or at least going into salons as
brunettes and coming out redheads. A
whole lot of us do it secretly and hope
whoever notices the next day says it looks
natural. Hair is an inherently private thing
that unfortunately has to be shared with
everyone. People always expect you to
keep it a certain way, depending on who

you are. And it is the first thing that gets
changed when people want a new look, a
fresh start.
I thought about this a lot when I was
younger, because I thought that the thing
that gave me away was my hair. I mean, my
hair is what most obviously betrayed me as
being different, i.e. Asian, which suggested
foreign, which meant Commie, which was
bad.
Flashback: In first-grade, our teacher
had us count up everyone wearing red,
everyone left-handed and then everyone
with blond hair. 1 was already feeling
unlucky as I wasn't special being a righty,
but it was when almost everyone stood up to
be counted that I realized I was totally out
of the loop. It was just me and l amika. and
she was a lot more accepting of the situa
tion. And then when the teacher drew
attention to this, reality really hit me. Black
hair meant different.
"Okay, now everyone with black hair,
stand up to be counted!"
I didn't stand up. I think we played this
game a couple more times throughout ele
mentary school, to learn about percentages,
then averages, then percentiles, but I always
insisted I had dark-brown hair. Actually it
was brown, but it wasn't supposed to be.

they said, seeing as how my parents came
from China.
"Just admit it, it's jet black."
So. it was always me and Tamika and
come to think of it, she had brown hair too.
It's sort of strange how something like
hair could come to wholly define me in
those days. 1 think that perception ended
around ninth grade, which 1 admit was
rather late to realize that standing out isn't
bad. It was around then that my hair did
finally turn black (well, dark, dark brown),
and I realized that Tamika had been way
ahead of her time.
Ninth grade was also when my sister
came home from medical school with a
beautifully blond head of hair. And she was
definitely not a natural blond, since it took
five hours in the salon.
My parents found the change rather
entertaining, after all she didn't look sloppy
or anything, and she still had her brain. It
actually looked really good. It was the doc
tois who freaked out.
With hei blond hair suddenly it was like
a first hand Prime lime Live, where the guy
with a good education and pleasant
demeanor goes in for a job interview. He's
supposed to be qualified in every way. of
course, but he noes into the interview once

as a white person and again as a black poi
son. And of course, multiple trials show that
time and again only one of his personas gets
the job.
You've heard it all before. It's a case ol
bad predictions and mixed up identifica
tions; mixed up because someone's
appearance, I won't say race, has nothing
to do with his or her typing speed. My sis
ter told us stories about the stall who sud
denly treated her iionically like a foreign
er, as if her hair made her an untrustwor
thy doctor. And she described the new res
idents she met who immediately assumed
that she needed things explained, loudly
and slowly.
At a glance, it was easy Id look past the
bridge of her nose and cheekbones and
think she was just another Caucasian
woman. Because of that, around the hospi
tal she was suddenly seen as a ait\ female in
need of a baby-sitter to make it through
medical school. I'he strangest thing, she
said, was that sometimes that image would
try to realize itscll and eventually, she got
the black back.
Ask her now and she'll insist that it was
all in fun, the last time in her life when she
could ever try something like that. I hese
days, she wouldn't dare walk into surgery

looking quite so bleached. In the six months
she lived as ;i blond Caucasian woman, she
collected some hard evidence for my hair
theory. It wrongfully symbolizes so much of
ourselves.
Sometimes 1 wish I would try something
like that, just to see what would happen and
know what strangers would see in me. And
1 wonder if maybe my sister was thinking
that when she did it. But most ol the time,
my excuse is that I'm afraid to find out. I'm
not any more tempted to try it here, despite
that the proportion of dark haired people is
a more overwhelming minority than I'm
used to.
It's because all of those sore spots I had
before have now become incidents in life,
things to step in and then scrape off and
move on. Everyone's made to prove them
selves before admission to the club, some
times with stupid things like hair. The big
problem is, some people are forced to prove
themselves over and over.
And anyway, I'm finally used to dark,
dark brown and blonde no. 12 costs 10
pounds.

lienlon Ho, a junior majoring in political
science, would like to finally set the record
straight. She is not a natural blond.
