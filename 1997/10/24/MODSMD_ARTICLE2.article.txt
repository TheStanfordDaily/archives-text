ety . . . Investing in Knowledge and Scholar
ship." officially launched its "public phase"
Sept. I; il will end Aug. 31, 2000. I he first two
years of the campaign were spent in a "quiet
time." during which the organization turned to a
"core group of overseers and close friends'' to
raise the first $35 million.
"We have been working very hard dm ing the
past two years to raise a big nucleus fund.
Hoover Director John Raisian said, adding, "I
am extremely excited about the potential lot

early IWOs kepi the institution lioni launching
such a campaign; however, for the lust three

of the campaign is to double both
the number of donors and the How

"Hoover's come through a tran
sitional period: transition of lead

research focus." Meyer said. " The
combination has created an oppor
tunity to step out and do new things
that require new people providing
new support."
He said that while the cam

market change and other external

developments, he sees the biggest
challenge as a lack of awareness.
"For many reasons, people
don't know enough about the in
credible collection of talent and

The Hoover Institution's pur
pose is to promote individual free
dom, private enterprise and repre
sentative government, a statement
said. In addition it plays a key role
in the Stanford community as a
unique collection of resources.
A volunteer committee of about
30 people with branches in North
ern and Southern California has
identified a prospective group of
2(H) donors.
