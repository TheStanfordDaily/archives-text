the Stan lord men's soccer team's
drubbing of St. Mary's yesterday af
ternoon at New Maloney Field.
1 he fourth-ranked Cardinal (12-
0-2, 3-0-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) came away with a 4-0
win. scoring three of its goals in the
first 1(S minutes of play against the
(iaels (5-6-2,0-2 West Coast Confer
ence). By the time Stanford scored
its fourth goal with 15 minutes re
maining. head coach Bobby Clark
was playing several players off the
bench for one of the first times this
year.
Clark had been a little worried
that his players might not take the
match — the Cardinal's first since
claiming the MPSF Mountain Divi
sion championship last weekend

seriously enough.
And while there's always room
for improvement. Clark was happy
with his team's play, especially in its
explosive opening power. Most of
the game was played on the (iaels'
side of the field, and St Mary's only
had two shots on goal in the entire
