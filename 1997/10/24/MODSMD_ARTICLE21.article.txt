### Ben Freda Staff writer 
When the University decides to turn on
the heat in student residences, most Stan
fordites think it's because of the chilly weath
er.
Hut in truth, the I Jniversity's decision is a
cryptic message to the women's soccer team:
the season is more than half over, and the
heat is on to make a playoff push.

putting together two come-from-behind vic
tories against California and San Francisco,
lb maintain its postseason hopes, the Cardi
nal (6-7-0. 1-2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) must
build on its momentum in two home games
this weekend against Washington State and
No. 11 Washington.
"It was important that we got those victo
ries last weekend." said head coach Steve
Swanson. "But what we need to do now is
focus on the next game. The game against
Washington State is crucial. We need to keep
this run going."
"We know we have to keep up the inten
sity." said junior forward Tracye Lawyer.
"Our next games are going to be incredibly
important."
The Cardinal enters today's 3 p.m.
matchup against Washington State (7-6-0,2-
2-0) with a renewed sense of confidence after
last week's victories.
"The wins last week gave us confidence,
for sure," Swanson said. "Going into the
games this weekend, there is an uplifting
feeling."
Before the victories against ( aland I JSF ; ,
Stanford had gone 1-6 in its previous seven

games.
But Swanson, at the helm of a team that's
run into its share of adversity this season,
says the Cardinal's pendulous fortunes are
beyond the realm of logic.
"Being on the inside, it's really difficult to
explain," he said. "We've played consistent
ly in many aspects this year, but the results
just haven't been there.
"That's why last weekend's results were
so important."
Washington State was one of the Pac-l()'s
hottest teams before its five-game win streak
was doused at home last weekend against
Arizona State and Arizona. Ihe ( ougars,
previously a shoo-in for the playoffs, will
have to stake their postseason claim today at

The team is anchored by freshman stand
out Deka DeWitt, the team leader in goals
scored (5) and assists (3). I)eWitt was named
Pac-1() Player of the Week two weeks ago
after the Cougars beat Oregon and Oregon
State on the strength of DeWitt's two goals
and two assists.
It doesn't get any easier for Stanford
when it faces the Nth-ranked Washington
I fuskies (7-8,4-0). the top team in the Pae-10,
at noon on Sunday.
The Huskies opened the season with five
straight losses, but since then have caught
fire, going 7-3 and winning their last four
matches. Washington has never beaten Stan
ford in seven tries, but the team has never
looked as formidable.
"Both games are going to be very strong
tests." Swanson said. "We'll have to rise to
the occasion."
The matches mark the Cardinal's last
homestand of the regular season. Alter this
weekend, the team's remaining four games
against Oregon State. Oregon. Arizona
State, and Arizona — take Stanford on the
road to determine its playoff fortunes.
But Lawyer takes it as another challenge.
"Any good team has to be able to play
well at home and on the road." she said.
"We're not worried."
"Being on the road is nothing that we
haven't experienced before." Swanson said.
