"We're expecting good competition this weekend he
cause we've had great matches versus Simon Fraser in
the past, and Santa Barbara is a very good club team,
said coach Shervl Johnson.
The match against Simon Fraser — a Canadian team
— is the onlv international one Stanford will play this
season, which in itself could provide some excitement.
And because UC-Santa Barbara performs so well as a
club team. Stanford hopes the program will soon turn

varsity and join the Cardinal in the Northern Pacific
Athletic ( onference.
But it's clear these two teams are not quite Division I
material — at least not yet.
"We'll use [tomorrow's] matches to further condition
ourselves for next week vs. Cal." said junior forward
Sarah Medeiros.
Despite taking three of four games on last week's
East Coast road trip, the Cardinal (11-5, 3-0 NorPac)
isn't satisfied with its scoring. Feeling that they haven't
been putting enough points on the scoreboard lately,
team members want to regain their confidence.
"The team should be prepared lor Invitational play
because we're very used to playing on (artificial) turl.
said sophomore defender Julie (ivvo/tl/. Stanford has
competed on turl for most of the season and mastered
the art of turf play last week on Boston ( ollcge's syn

"The game is so much prettier on turl and more fun to
watch." said captain Justina Williams. After seeing how

the Cardinal is now hoping for an in

"We'll jlist continue to play the
way we have been and keep our in
tensity level up," (iwo/dz said. "It'll
be easier now because we've had a
chance to rest and catch up on our
classwork."
Another Cardinal advantage is
depth. "Although we've never

played back-to-back games on the
same day," Williams said, "we'll
have plenty of fresh legs."
While the weekend's competi
tion won't include any ranked
teams. Stanford will take advantage
of the opportunity to refine its pass
ing and other skills. "It's a prime
time to practice new moves."
Williams said.
Plus, every match is an opportu
nils for another victory.
"It's always good to play, and
it's always good to win!" Medeiros
said.
