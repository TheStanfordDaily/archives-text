Sophomore Sarah Clark and the fourth-ranked Cardinal can run their
winning streak to 15 matches this weekend in Oregon.
Shaw may he concerned thai his
team won't be tired up lor a pair of
less competitive opponents, hut with
the intensity Stanford lias shown of
late, you can bet they'll be ready.
"Whenever Oregon State and
()regon play us. they plav out of their
minds," said sophomore outside hit
ter Jaimi Gregory. "I'm expecting
theni to come out pretty hard. Weal
ways expect to be on top of the I'ac
ids, but we also realize that it's not a
given and anyone on any given night
can beat us. We definitely don't take
it for granted, but we're enjoying de
position we're in right now."
That position is a two-match lead
over fifth-ranked I JSC and a three
match margin over No. 10 Washing

ton Slate. No. 15 Arizona and No. 21
Washington. And with only one road
trip remaining after this weekend,
the ('ardinal is in good shape to win
the conference.
"It's a heck of a lot better than I
thought it'd he two weeks ago," Shaw
said. "Really, USC is the only team
with a legitimate shot right now."
1 he Oregon schools definitely
don't factor into the conference title
equation, unless of course they were
to plav the role of spoiler by staging
an unbelievable upset this weekend.
Hut that isn't likely.
"()regon seems to be struggling to
get it together." Shaw said. "It's hard
to know if you'll see a team that's
given up hope or a team that 's trying
to turn it around. Oregon State's got
the physical ability on the floor to
beat a lot of teams. It's just a matter
of us executing."
