Chapter One:
The Invitation
By Willie Faulkner

ne summer day. warmer than water drawn from a well nes
tied in the shade of a strong oak tree, but not so warm as water boil
ing in an iron kettle hanging above a fireplace in some forgotten
house, a king, Cornelius Buck, tall and heroic, descended from a

lung line of Bucks famed throughout the countiyside ( Buckland, not small and negligible but
vast and impressive) for their (the Bucks') mighty feats of courage and valor, including, but
not limited to, Michael Buck's (first Buck born in Buckland, his ancestors having come over
the Southern Sea from Alfheim) slaying of the entire Gregor family and subsequent conquer
ing of Buckland, was conversing, was discussing, was talking with a miller (country miller)
with no history comparable to that of the mighty King Buck. However, so that he (the miller)
would appear impressive in the blue, unblinking, and often unnerving eyes of his liege and
lord, he (again, the miller) fabricated and spun a glorious but erroneous tale concerning his
daughter, miller's daughter, born and bred in the miller's house and thoroughly unaware of
her father's shifty ways. The king, famed for his brawn and not his brain, believed the ill-con
ceived but flattering story that was simply this: the miller's daughter, being born under
extraordinary circumstances, the details of which having escaped the miller's memory dur
ing the telling of the story, was born with the unmistakably profitable power to spin, not the
twirling, dancing sort of spinning but the weaving, sewing sort of spinning, and she was
granted the wondrous power to spin straw, ordinary, yellow, chewed upon by horses in the
stable and slept upon by travelers seeking shelter from the rain, into gold, glittering and
sparkling, the most precious and heaviest of metals. Upon hearing and believing this tale of
wonders, the king, possessing an immitigable sense of greed, vowed that he would someday
marry this prodigious girl; in concordance with his newfound plan, he relayed to the town
crier, whose name he could not recall, but who seemed able and willing to cry, an invitation
to he issued to the miraculous girl living in the countryside in the miller's house, to visit with
him for a fortnight, or until the yellow flowers of the sycamore trees turned blue, in his cas
tle, colossal, fortified, having been built by the aforementioned Michael Buck upon conquer
ing Buckland.

Chapter Four:
The Dwarf in the Straw
By J. D. Salinger

w
W V ell, this is my story, or as much as I care to
remember. It's not exactly the kind of thing I'd want to
remember, if you know what I mean. But I suppose bad
stuff happens to me all the time anyway, so I might as well
tell you. My name's Rumpelstiltzkin. Yeah, that's right.
Rumpelstiltzkln. My mom thought it would be funny if my
name was really long and dumb-sounding, so she looked
through some dictionary of Swahill or something and

picked the weirdest name she could find. It probably translates into son-of-an-idiot. I'm not
saying I don't li_ke my mom, Just that she's an idiot. And my whole life's been pretty lousy
since then. Anyway, one night I was creeping around the palace gardens when I heard a voice
crying.
Crying. Vou wouldn't think anyone in a palace would be crying. Anyway, I went to get a
closer look, but all the windows were too high up. In case I didn't mention it before, I'm a
dwarf. That means two things: I have a few generally worthless powers, and I can't see
through windows that are too high up. So I took a running leap and ended up flying through
the window. Fortunately, a spinning wheel broke my fall. A spinning wheel. Then this girl
with tears in her eyes told me that she had to spin all this straw into gold or she would be
killed. It was clear she wasn't exactly Albert Einstein. I mean, whoever heard of spinning
straw into gold. It was Just my luck that I ended up stuck in a room with the dumbest girl
on the planet and only 60,000 bales of straw and a broken spinning wheel to entertain
myself with. Anyway, she kept on whining about the stupid straw. I really hate whiners. 80
Just to shut her up, I told her I'd help her. One of my generally worthless powers happens
to be the ability to change the colors of things. Although it's a riot at parties, it's not the
-ind of thing you'd go taking over the world with. So I made the straw look like gold, and
she fell for it! She really thought it was gold. She showed it to the King, and he thought it
was gold, too! I swear I was surrounded by idiots. All their IQs added up wouldn't equal an
aardvark's. Anyway, as soon as the king opened the door I bolted. Boy, if I knew royal peo
ple were that dumb, I wouldn't have been so mean to my mom. She's a good sight smarter
than them.

Unbeknownst to most literary critics, four of the greatest writers in English literature happened to be
great fans of the fairy .ale "Straw into Gold." Diversions unearthed these previously unseen and unpub
lished manuscripts for the perusal and enjoyment of the general public. Diversions hope this will shed
new light into the works of these writers.

Chapter Two:
For Whom the
Straw Spins
by Ernie
Hemingway

The miller's daughter entered (he throne
room of the castle and the courtiers bowed to

her. She frowned at (heir action and proceeded to the throne and kneeled
before the king. Iler father stood next to the king with an uneasy expres
sion on his face.
"You can spin straw into gold?" the king asked.
"Quoi? What?" the daughter asked. The miller began to sweat. The
daughter saw the sweat.
"Your father told me that you could spin straw into gold," the king
repeated.
"I'm sorry. IVIy father was wrong."
"Then he will be executed for lying to me. You may go now."
"Wait, I no>\ realize that I can spin straw into gold."
"You said that you could not spin straw into gold and that your father
was wrong and that you were sorry."
"I was mistaken. I can spin straw into gold and you do not have to kill
my father."
"Since von can spin straw into gold, you will spend the night here and
spin <>0.000 bales of straw into gold and marry me tomorrow. If you can
not spin the <>0.000 bales of straw into gold. I will kill you."
"Yes, my lord. Hon nuit." The miller's daughter walked into a room
with (>O.OOO bales of straw in it and closed the door behind her. The king
smiled and the miller fainted.
