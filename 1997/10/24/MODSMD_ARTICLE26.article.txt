# TIME DEATH IN THE PALACE
## The 						oppression heats up with dwarf's tragic death 
### 
Atragedy occurred yesterday in the
main hall of the King's Royal
Palace. The local dwarf (Rumpel
stiltzkin, 345 years, of minimal height and
build) passed away unexpectedly during a
heated conversation with the Queen.
Bystanders claim that the dwarf, unpro
voked, plunged his left leg deep into the
ground. Finding himself trapped, he then
grabbed his right leg and tore himself in
half. Rumpelstiltzkin was immediately
rushed to the Royal Healer, who pro
nounced him dead on arrival at 7:46 p.m.
Witnesses (Cecil the court steward
and Jack the squire) stated, "The good
Queen did nothing to provoke his
(Rumpelstiltzkin's) odd behavior." Never

theless, Rumpelstiltzkin's family intends
to press full charges of voluntary
manslaughter on the Queen, who refused
to comment on the incident.
