Newton, a clinical faculty member at the Stanford
Medical Center and priv ate Bay Area psychotherapist,
was remembered as an outgoing man by friends and
colleagues.
"He loved to laugh," said his son. Stuart Newton.
"He was extremely compassionate and caring toward
his patients."
Clinical Psychiatry Prof. Kick Van Rheenen. who
knew Newton for 20 years, added. "He was involved
and innovative. llc was not one of those guys who sits
back and grunts."
According to Van Rheenen. Newton knew he was
going to die: he suffered from the same genetically
linked heart disease that had already taken the lives of
a brother and son. Yet, Van Rheenen said, "for sonic
one who was liv ing on borrowed time. New ton shared a
real)»>\ of life, he tried to crowd as much fun into his life
as lie could."
He also was highly regarded professionally. Psychi
atrv Prof. I meritus Irvin Yalom. who knew Newton at
the Medical Center, called him "a very good psychia-
tnst.
Newton, his son added, "was a
strong facilitator: he wouldn't just
show people the answers: he would
lead them there. And that is the
mark of a great psychiatrist."
Newton graduated in 1954 with
a degree in pre medicine from the
University of Western Ontario. He
went on to complete his medical
degree from the University of
Toronto, where he was also elected
class president. Newton became

the first person of Jewish origin to
be admitted into the internship
program at Toronto (ieneral Hos
pital. where he continued to work
until 19f>0.
A turning point in Newton's life
came in 19M. when he moved to
Stanford to pursue a master's in so
ciology, also an interest of his. It
was this interest in sociology and
the fact that a psychiatric position
necessitated a shorter internship
period than any other medical field
that influenced Newton's move
into the psychiatric profession, his
son said.
Newton adopted as his perma

ncnt home the Hay Area, where he
lived for the past 37 years. He pro
ceeded to rise to a teaching position
in Stanford's Department of Psy
chiatry in 19M and then to the
chairmanship of the department of
psychology at the College of Notre
Dame in 1972.
Newton was admired for his
"diligence, professionalism and de
termination." his son said. "They
looked to him to lead."
At the Medical Center. Newton
assisted in the move of psychiatry
into the managed care industry,
which Ins son credited as his most
important contribution.

Newton also founded a private
therapeutic practice in Portola Val
ley. where he became something of
"a pioneer in group therapy," Van
Rheenen said.
111 his later years. Newton served
in several prominent psychiatric or
ganizations. including the Santa
Clara County Medical Society and
the American Psychiatry Associa
