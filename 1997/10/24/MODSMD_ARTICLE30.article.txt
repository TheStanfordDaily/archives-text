## Former Olympian Amy Chow balances old glory with frosh experience 
### Kerry Shaw Contributing writer 
What's a girl to do when she's
won two ()lympic medals, been on ;i
Wheaties box and done ;i ( okc com
mercial? It you're Ann ( how and
you're only I 1 ) years old. you move
on to the next goal: beim? ;i licshman
at Stanford.
( how's route from high school to
college has taken one year longer
than anticipated. After her gradua
lion from nearby Castilleja High
School. Amy headed off to Atlanta,
where she competed on the gold
medal-winning United Stales
women's gymnastics team.
After the team's much hyped
success, endorsement offers came
rushing in. Amy accepted several
and chose to spend the next year on
tour with the national team (minus
Kcri Slrug. who chose to tour with a
different group) perlorming profes
sionally around the country.
One of Amy's original reasons
for choosing Stanford was its
strength in both academics and ath
letics. Hut her decision to accept
money for performing prohibits her
from competing at the intercolle
giate level. It's a choice that is prov
ing fruitful even today, as the nation
al tour finishes yet anothci season
and may continue through next yeai
A freshman in Francos, Amy's
schedule is like that of any other
frosh during the week: she goes to
(TV (Europe and the Americas);
takes a language class (( 'antonesc
both of her parents are fluent, and
she is just learning); she gets in a
workout when there's time; and eats
her meals at Wilbur I )inint> I hill.

()n the weekends, however. Amy
( how is once again a gymnastics sn
perstar. living to meet up with the
rest o! the '% ()l\mpie team, which
h;is since been dubbed the "Magnil
icent Seven." They travel in ;i luxun

bus with televisions and beds, usual
Iv visiting three cities in one week
end, entertaining fans who paj
about $30 a ticket to see their hero
ines in person.
I hose famous names from the

Olympics — Shannon Miller. Do
minique Dawes and Keri Strug (who
re-joined the group this year) — are
"like sisters" to Amy. She enjoys the
tour, noting Pennsylvania, Boston
and San Jose as some of her favorite
stops.
I he routine isn't too difficult for
a girl who's been used to the time
demands of elite athleticism almost
since she first learned to walk. She
began gymnastics when her mother
enrolled her in a class — "so that I
would have an activity," ( how said.
"You had to be five to take ballet."
So gymnastics it was. Now she has
a silver and a gold medal from the
Olympic games, which she keeps
safely in a bank.
Amy's schedule has forced her to
find a balance between family,
friends, and athletics. She sees her
17-year-old brother every day, be
cause he trains under the direction of
the men's gymnastics coach, with
whom Amy also trains. She spent the
first two days of ()ricntation getting
to know her fellow freshmen before
leaving for the next stop on the na
tional tour.
Focus makes this rigorous rou
tine possible. She knows her priori
ties. She chose to live in a four-class
dorm, because she wanted to be with
people "who knew what they were
studying."
( how's side of her dorm room is
tidy, sparse and spatially efficient
the only decoration is a gymnastics
calendar. When asked about her ca
reer goals. Amy answers without hes
itation that she would like to be a pe
diatrician. As for gymnastics, she'll
keep up the hobby as long as it con
tinues to be fun.
