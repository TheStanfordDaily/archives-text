## Bill latest in long line of fee reforms 
### Allison Hays Staff writer 
A recent proposal to overhaul
the special fee system is the latest in
;i long string of attempts to reform
Ihe way student groups are awarded
money.
In the current system, students
\ote on groups' special fee requests
each Apt il in Ihe ANSI' Spring (fed
eral I lection.
A bill submitted bv ASSIJ Sena
tor Mike Sletnmer proposes that stu
dents vote on a single "association
fee," giving ASSU committees the
powei to allocate money to individ
ual groups. I he change, he says,
would mean groups won't have to
depend on the whirns ol student vol
ers, who lasi year approved all re
quests but in l l > ( 'lonl\ approved IS

out of 36 requests..
I he special-fee system was insti
luted m and intended for one
time large expenses for either new or
existing groups. ( her the years, the
number of groups requesting fees
has increased drastically.
I'ast proposed reforms have been
directed at making the system more
fair to graduate students and con
fronting an increasing rate at which
students requested refunds of their
fees. I ach year, many groups also
have expressed concern that Ihe
Daily wields too much power in en
dorsing groups' fees requests.
Amendments proposed over the
years have met with varying fates.
In l l )N2. students voted over
whelmingly for a change to the sys-
tcm that would allow students to collect refunds if they
h;id voted I•"lev til years later, students voted to allow
anyone to receive a refund.
More and more students especially graduate stu
dents who felt most groups did not represent them -re
quested refunds each year.
A bill was proposed on the I WO ballot that intended
to remove the right to a refund. Its intent was to save
combat a trend that saw fee requests increasing because
groups were allowed to add a buffer to their requests.
hoi example, a group in I WO could add 25 percent to
ils request because an estimated 25 percent would have
been returned to students. I lie buffer meant students
who didn't u quest refunds paid for students who did re
quest lefunds.
Students voted down the proposal, but the problem
I i si-i. las graduate students continued to request sig
iiilkaiill\ moic refunds than undergraduates.

In IW4, 22 percent of students demanded refunds.
Out of this figure, 45 percent of graduate students re
quested them, as opposed to only 15 percent of under
graduates.
The next idea for a solution was to allow groups to re
quest money from only undergraduates, only graduate
students or both populations.
A IW4 proposal to split the graduate and under
graduate voting populations failed in the spring elec
tion.
In January IWS, the Balanced Funding Deal, which
eliminated fee refunds in addition to splitting the voting
population, failed in a special January election.
I hat spring, in the general election, reformers final
ly succeeded in an initiative. The Common Sense Fee
Reform which remains in effect — allowed student
groups to apply to either undergraduates only, graduate
students only or both populations.
That brought about a new set of problems, however.
In IW6, the first year Common Sense Fee Reform was
in effect, most groups that applied to both populations
lost their special fee because so few graduate students

voted.
Last spring, more groups applied only to undergrad
uates, and all groups won funding. Asa result, this year's
undergraduate fees have increased by 75 percent.
The latest reform would mean a drastic change to the
special-fee system. Instead ot students voting on indi
vidual groups, a new committee selected hy the Nomi
nations Commission would distribute funds.
"My main concern is that it is currently an all-or
nothing system," said Slemmer. "Perhaps there are
other ways to get around this, hut 1 wanted to give the
student body something to think about."
One of Slemmcr's goals is to lessen The Daily's in
fluence, through its endorsements, on student voting.
Students tend not to be well-informed enough when
they vote, Slemmer said. "Students will vote for any
thing," he said. "They're morons."
The bill also aims to reduce politicking — both lor
student voters and for The Daily. However, critics say
the politicking will simply be directed at the new com
mittee now.
Slemmer said that probably can't be helped. "Poli

ticking is going to happen at some level no matter what
special-fee system exists," he said.
Many ASSU senators have said they support the bill.
"This bill has some real value," ASSU President
Emily Andrus said last week. "I think we are on the
right track."
ASSU Senator Alv Rcmtulla, Deputy Senate Chair
Matt Spence and ASSU Vice President Ben Decker
have also come out in favor of the bill-
Some students, however, are concerned with losing
the power to vote on individual groups.
Senior (Tiarles Buxbaum said. "Whoever thinks that
this bill will actually pass is not the sharpest tool in the
shed, so to speak. We've come a long way in the history
of fee reform only to have this primitive bill slap us in
the face."
The bill has other hurdles to pass before it comes up
for a vote by students. The ASSI I Senate has not yet dis
cussed it and will vote on whether to putit on the ballot.
Slemmer is optimistic. "Just because this bill is un
popular now doesn't mean that things can't change, he
said.
