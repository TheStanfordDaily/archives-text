Although Stanford prides itsell
on lis .ill around stellar academic
reputation, University President
(ierhaid ( aspci has initialed two
majoi programs to strengthen the
humanities and aits.
According to ( asper, the new
programs, announced in his annual
Stale ol the I Inivcrsily address last
I inlay, are designed to transform
the humanities into a "more visible
and dvnaniie participant in shaping,
enriching and challenging the intel
leclual agenda aeross 1 he I Jniversi
ly."
I lie Insi program is a $12 million
initiative to add loin new professor
ships in the humanities and aits.

will be lined and which departments

said Assistant
Jacqueline Casper
Wender. "It is
now at the discretion ol the |School
ol Humanities and Sciences], It is
difficult to speculate how quickly
they can act."
Wender added that she hopes the
professorships will be implemented
by next year.
Although an endowed professor
ship is usually supported by only $2
million, these four new profcssoi
ships will be supported by $3 million
each. Ihe extra $1 million will be

used not only for recruitment pur
poses but also for improvements to
the departments with professor
ships.
"These professorships will en
able the humanities departments to
appoint the most distinguished
scholars working in these fields
today," C asper said in his address.
"The opportunity to make such ap
pointments should encourage de
partments to think ambitiously
about ways to strengthen the hu
manities as a whole."
The second program Casper an
nounced is the establishment of a se
ries of lectures, the Stanford Presi

dential Lectures and Symposia in
the I lumanities and Arts. The series
will be dedicated to bringing world
renowned scholars to Stanford for a
few days to lecture and participate in
panel discussions.
Casper selected French and Ital
ian Prof. Hans Gumbreeht to orga
nize and direct the new program,
which the president agreed to fund
through the year 2(HX).
(iumbrecht said he is looking tor
ward to directing the program and
hopes to bring 20 people includ
ing such noted individuals as authors
I'oni Morrison and Umberto I co
to campus it) participate, perhaps as
soon as this winter.
"We are consulting with faculty
right now." said (iumbrecht. "We
are looking for humanists, authors

and artists to come speak "
In addition to the lectures. (ium
brecht s.iul organizers hope to hold
colloquium discussions with stu
dents m conjunction with the speak
ers.
"What rcalh matters to us is not
jusi that this be an exciting intellec
tual event but that we also get feed
back for what the I 'niversity is plan
ning for the future of humanities at
Stanford.'' added (iumbrecht.
(iumbrecht hopes the lectures
w ill help determine how great a role
the humanities should pla\ in the
University's future. He noted that
the humanities are in a precarious
position: some scholars ignore the
field and those who affirm it are
stuck in an "old-fashioned dis
course."
