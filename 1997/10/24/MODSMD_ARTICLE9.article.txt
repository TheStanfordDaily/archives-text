ten to the Silence" conference to

The conference, which is free to

performances and workshops on a
variel\ of subjects. Tajima-Pena's
documentary. "My America... or
Honk II You Love Buddha." won a
cinematograph) award at last Janu
ary's Sundance film festival.
" I he purpose ol the conference
is to educate and facilitate discus
sion about Asian / Pacific Islander
issues." said AASA Chair Bianca
Ling, a junior. "Sometimes even
Asian Americans don't know all
about these issues."

AASA expects about 2(M) partic
ipants. including SO students from
other campuses such as UCLA.
I ('-Berkeley, I'C Santa Cru/.
Claremont McKcnna College and
the University of Nevada-Reno.
l ajima-Pena filmed her docu
mentary while she drove across the
country in search of an Asian-
American identity.
She found and profiled many
Asian Americans, such as Korean
rappers in Seattle, who might be
considered atypical in relation to
the prevalent "model minority"
stereotype.
The workshops cover a diverse
array ot topics, including anti-Asian
violence, interracial dating, gay
Asian Pacific Islander youth and
Asian-American issues surrounding
welfare and campaign financing.
"We really hope that all Stanford
students will come out to learn

about these issues," said Ling.
" I hey don't just affect Asian / Pa
cific Islanders. They affect every
body."
Representatives from various or
ganizations, such as the Asian Im
migrant Worker Advocates and the
Asian Law ( aucus, will conduct the
workshops, providing information
and facilitating discussions.
A total of 14 workshops given by
12 organizations will be offered
through the course of the day.
"We're going to try and stress
that this is a time for bringing differ
ent groups together," said ( hristina
Wong, program director of the
Northern California Coalition lor
Immigrant Rights. Wong will be giv
ing a workshop on inter-ethnic
coalition-building.
"It's difficult when a given issue
doesn't affect each community the
same way." said Wong about coali

tion-building. "Hut with the current
anti-immigrant backlash, fortunate
ly and unfortunately this is a good
time for it."
The conference also will feature
performances in White Plaza by
Everyday People a cappella, Stan
lord laiko. Chinese Folk Dance,
Stanford Hwimori and the Acade
my of Martial Arts and WuShu.
"The cultural performances let
attendees, as well as people just
walking by. see various aspects of
Asian-American culture," said
AASA's cultural education chair,
sophomore Matt Lai. "People pass
ing through White Plaza can see the
beautiful aspects of Asian culture."
Lai expressed disappointment,
however, that the performances are
mainly East Asian and that South
east Asian performance groups
were unable to be a part of the con
ference due to logistical difficulties.
