# LGBCC seeking full-time director
## 
### T.J. Babbitt Contributing writer 
After rejecting the idea in 1996,
the University is once again consid
ering appointing a full-time director
for the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center.
Earlier this month, a group of stu
dents submitted a detailed proposal
to the University requesting a pro
fessional director. Recently, the stu
dents met with Dean of Students
Marc Wais to argue their case, and a
similar meeting with Vice Provost
James Montoya is scheduled for
early next month.
" This proposal certainly warrants
serious consideration and that's
what it's going to get." said Wais.
Many gay and bisexual students
have called for a full-time director
for the LGBCC ever since the it was

established in 1988. In early 1996. the
University formally turned down
one of their proposals, saying that
funds were unavailable. Early in
1997. Wais invited the student com
munity to submit a second proposal
for a professional director in light of
the increased concern about anti-gay
incidents on campus.
When the Women's Center re
ceived a part-time professional di
rector for the first time this year, the
LGBCC was left as the only student
community center without any pro
fessional staff member. However.
Troy Gilbert, a program director at
the Office of Student Activities, has
served as an adviser to the LGBCC.
The proposal offers several rea
sons for why a professional director
is necessary. It cites the "increasing
numbers of openly gay students"
who place greater demands on the
center's facilities and the inability of
student staff members to act as ef
fective advocates for gay, lesbian
and bisexual students before the ad
ministration. But its central argu
ment is that a director will help stu
dents cope with what the proposal
describes as an often hostile campus
environment.
"It's important to have a director

that deals with the safety of stu
dents," said Richard Chin, a gradu
ate student who helped author the
proposal. "If you have the feeling
that anyone can come in and vandal
ize your property, you can't concen
trate on your studies and you can't
concentrate on your life."
Chin was referring in part to a se
ries of highly publicized anti-gay in
cidents on campus last year. For ex
ample, a campus eating club was
covered with anti-gay graffiti by a
student and students in Mirrielees
reported repeated acts of theft and
anti-gay harassment. Also, a gay stu

dent was allegedly turned away at
the door of an open, on-eampus fra
ternity party.
According to the proposal, a di
rector is needed to deal with such
events because "incidents of hate vi
olence paralyze the LCißCCstudent
staff because, as students, they are
the targets of hate violence."
Wais agreed that anti-gay harass
ment was a major problem at Stan
ford. "Since 1995 there has been a
significant increase in the reporting
of incidents affecting [lesbian, gay
and bisexual] students," he said.
Wais said that he did not know

whether the incidents represent an
increase in anti-gay sentiment on
campus or whether incidents are
now simply better reported when
they occur.
"But that's really insignificant,"
he said. "In either case, the Universi
ty is now much more fully aware of
the scope of these incidents."
Students involved with the pro
posal said they are uncertain as to
whether the administration will ap
point a director.
Wais "did agree to help advocate
for it," said Chin.
But David Bradfute, a law stu

dent who has also helped campaign
for a director, expressed frustration
with Wais's actions on the director
issue, saying, "He's had two years,
and he's accomplished nothing."
Wais has been dean of students since
1995.
The University has set no dead
line for a decision either way.
'Wais agreed to report back to us
on the status of the decision by the
end of the quarter," said Chin,
though he added that Wais
promised only a report, not neces
sarily an official decision.
Wais declined to speculate fur

ther on the timing of the University's
response, saying only, "I'm confi
dent that the University will respond
in a timely fashion."
Exactly who in the University ad
ministration makes the decision is
also unclear to many. In part, it de
pends on the potential source of
funding.
According to Bradfute, Wais told
the student group that "he didn't
have the resources in his area for a
full-time director." That is one of the
