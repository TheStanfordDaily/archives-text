## Editorial The
						Senate's Top Ten 
### 
List suggests potential for
a productive year provided
goals remain reasonable

IT MAY NOT be as humorous as Let
terman's Top Ten lists, but the ASSII
Senate's Top Ten list scheduled to be
publicly released this week is a potential
step toward increasing the Senate's credi
bility.,
In an effort to improve accountability
and to avoid the vague and loose promises
that have characterized the visions ot previ
ous Senates, this year's Senate has devised
a list of what they believe to be tangible and
measurable goals.
Among the highlights of this list are cre
ating a course guide containing some kind
of quantitative data by the beginning of
winter quarter, facilitating all-freshman
class social activities, improving disability
access by obtaining golf carts able to trans
port people in wheel chairs and expanding
the ASSU teaching awards program to rec
ognize not only outstanding teaching by
faculty, but also by graduate teaching assis
tants.
While the extent to which the Senate will
be able to achieve these goals is yet
unknown, the Senate is to be commended
for its bold step in creating a Top Ten list.
Such an articulation of goals should
increase the focus of the Senate and will
hopefully lead to a productive legislative
program.
Moreover it should also be commended
for taking the risk, shied away from bv pre

vious senates, of putting itself on the line by
publicly declaring an agenda.
The Senate is not required by its Con
stitution to publicly declare such a list of
goals. Indeed, at present there are no
mechanisms between annual Spring Gen
eral Flections to ensure that senate mem
bers remain accountable to the student
population.
Perhaps the Senate's 11th goal should be
devising a system to guarantee long-term
Senate accountability to the student body.
Nonetheless the Senate must be sure to
remain concentrated on realistic and tangi
ble goals.
Proposals such as reforming the gradu
ate housing lottery and ensuring that e-mail
accounts remain available to students free
of charge will likely prove to be overly
ambitious. Rather the Senate should focus
on smaller, more realistic efforts such as
creating a committee to study the graduate
housing situation and commencing talks
with the university on the issue.
The ASSIJ Senate should keep in mind
that a reasonable proposal is one that does
not need the approval of associations
beyond the Senate.
Finally, goals should be well publicized
and forums for student input should be
encouraged. Proposals such as a bi-weekly
or monthly ASSIJ newsletter and a
e-mail site may prove to be
steps in that direction.
While the ASSU has historically been
criticized for its lack of action, we applaud
this new prioritizing system in the hope that
Stanford students, faculty and staff will be
able to see tangible results of this process
during the year.
