Freedom has boundaries
In "Destiny and Dying with Dignity"
(Oct. 2()). Kerry Rodgers addressed the
issue of self-induced euthanasia and "sell
sovereignty" in regards to recent Oregon
legislation allowing mentally competent,
terminally ill. people to induce their own
deaths.
Rodgers states that. "In terms of policy, 1
don't like the idea of the government decid
ing what I can or can't do with my body,
whether the issue be death, an unborn fetus
or chemical substances. I want self
sovereignty."
According to Rodgers, "what makes

America great is our freedom to think and
do whatever the hell we want." A scary
proposition. A wrong one.
America is wonderful, but this "land of
the free" was not founded on the notion of
"doing whatever the hell we want." We
have freedoms in this country that people
elsewhere only dream about.
I lowever. this does not mean we live our
lives without boundaries. We need laws
governing our behavior to protect our free
dom. to ensure that everyone has the free
dom to choose his or her "destiny" as long
as it does not infringe on or inhibit the abil
ities of others to express that same freedom.

This is far from "doing whatever the hell
we want."
"Self-sovereignty" is a catchy phrase, hut
it has its limitations within a society. If we all
had "self-sovereignty." we wouldn't have a
government; we would he subject to the
whims of people with different standards of
right and wrong.
The government does make "decisions"
for its citizens. It comes to some reasonable
and logical consensus as to what the stan
dards of our social behavior and interaction
should be. It will penalize certain actions
and behaviors that are violations of other
people's rights over their bodies.

Prostitution is illegal, drinking while
driving is heavily penalized, and smoking
restrictions are in place because of the lethal
dangers of second-hand smoke.
Legal repercussions may affect our
behavior, but do not deny us the ability to
make such decisions. We are free to decide
to do whatever we want. Only in this sense,
do we have "self-sovereignty."
Rixigers opposes the government decid
ing what she can do with her body, when the
issue is "an unborn fetus."
The dispute as to whether or not a fetus
is simply a mass of cells or a child has pro
gressed to the point where fully formed

babies are not considered alive, or even
human beings, until they actually take a
breath outside of their mothers.
Society has taken this notion of "doing
what I want with my body" to the point
where we condone partial-birth abortions.
Namely, babies are pulled from the womb,
legs first, their skulls then crushed and
drained with instruments. So it is not a
human with rights of its own. as long as its
head is still inside the birth canal.
How is this different from killing a child
right after it is born? We have a problem
with women killing their babies, our eye
brows furrow when we hear of women leav-
