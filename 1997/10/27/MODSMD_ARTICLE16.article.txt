## Finding your academic niche 
### 
I'M AT A dinner party
or a restaurant or sit
ting in the theater
before a movie — any
social situation where peo
ple get around to talking
about what everyone is
doing.

Inevitably some
body, perhaps a friend who has forgotten or
an innocent acquaintance who doesn't
know any better, asks, "What is your
major?"
I laugh and shrug my shoulders dismis
sively. Then I say with false formality, "I
have an individually designed major titled
Philosophy and Form of Visual Art."
I'm usually received with some combina
tion of bewilderment or confusion, so I
explain flippantly, "I basically take fun
classes in whatever I want."
This is only a partial truth, for while I
hand picked each of the classes in my major,
and while I enjoy them, it is not like I pulled
a fast one on the University and got to do
something entirely random.
My schedule basically consists of the fol
lowing: a third of my units are in Studio Art
and the rest are in inter-disciplinary courses
that deal with the philosophy of aesthetics
and the intersection of art with other intel
lectual fields. The courses are all upper-divi
sion and often are in departments in which
I have not taken intro courses, so it is not an
easy ride.
But once I get home from the social
event I end up thinking, in a moment of self
reflection right before I fall asleep, that
sometimes people don't take me very seri
ously.
There was a time when I desperately
needed people to take me seriously, and I
found that those who did were few and far
between. I felt this most acutely at the end
of my sophomore year, after I'd spent
numerous hours putting together my major
and was on the search for the three requisite
faculty advisors.
As a transfer student, 1 had spent the
majority of my sophomore year completing

"freshmen" requirements. Thus with the
exception of my CIV section leader (who,
I'd like to note, was incredibly helpful and
encouraging, though she didn't fit the bill as
an FA), I knew very few faculty members.
With my mission in hand I went knocking
on strangers' doors, with the hope that they
might take an interest in my proposal.
I quickly became accustomed to being
dissed by profs who couldn't understand
why I didn't just major in their departments.
I remember calling home one night early
in my junior year, a single sympathetic fac
ulty member yet unfound, and complaining
to my parents, "I don't know what to do. If
I can't find anyone to back me then my
major won't get approved. And I can't grad
uate without a major."
Poor Mom and Dad have seen me
through many such crises.
When I decided in 11th grade that high
school was no longer bearable, they helped
me to figure out which colleges accepted
high school dropouts, and they saw me off
to Swarthmore.
Then, after I decided to transfer to Stan
ford, Ma and Pa gave me the green light to
take a year off from school to work. Now
the individually designed major.
By this point, they had re-mortgaged
their house to pay for their children's high
er education, and I had their unequivocal
support to major in whatever the hell I
wanted.
But when push came to shove and I
didn't think I could get what I wanted, they
said, "it's not the diploma that counts, it's
the education."
I want to justify that I wasn't trying to go
against the grain just to be a pain. When I
started at Stanford I fully intended on
majoring in something traditional.
But after a few quarters, I had the real
ization that I couldn't feel satisfied going
through college neglecting my passion,
painting. And yet I didn't want to spend all
my time painting at the expense of my other
intellectual interests. I didn't have time for
both, so I took the road less taken.
Maybe somewhere deep in my subcon

scious I was testing my parents. If so, they
passed with flying colors. I d once heard a
dormmate say that her parents thought it
was ridiculous that she was wasting her time
taking a single art class, and I ve heard
many would-be art majors say that their
parents wouldn't allow it because art is use
less.
Art may be useless in the way that your
soul is useless. I'm convinced useful majors
are soulless. 1 may not find a job that direct
ly correlates with my undergraduate work,
but I have no doubt that I'll find a job that
I'll enjoy. So what if the company doesn't
have a table at the career fair.
I must be blessed with good karma since
my parents don't seem to be worried. Once
I had their support I was able to continue
my search for enlightened faculty advisors
with renewed confidence. And by the end
of the month, I had located three excellent
advisors who enthusiastically endorsed my
proposal.
It has been almost a year now since my
major was approved by the IDM board, and
I'm relishing every moment of it.
Except the part of trying to explain it to
other people.
Their expressions often make me feel
like I'm cheating, because I don't have a
painfully oppressive major. So I've devel
oped this coping mechanism: blowing
myself off before anyone else does.
Today I'm making a truce with the
world. Don't judge me for my major, and I
won't judge you for yours. There's enough
room in the universe for each of us to do our
own thing.
I won't laugh if you won't.
And if you are one of the unfortunate in
the midst of I-can't-decide-what-to-major
in blues, I offer this: listen to what your
heart tells you. And if that doesn't already
exist, don't be afraid to make it a reality.

between. I felt this most acutely at the end
of my sophomore year, after I'd spent
numerous hours putting together my major
and was on the search for the three requisite
faculty advisors.
As a transfer student, 1 had spent the
majority of my sophomore year completing

"freshmen" requirements. Thus with the
exception of my CIV section leader (who,
I'd like to note, was incredibly helpful and
encouraging, though she didn't fit the bill as
an FA), I knew very few faculty members.
With my mission in hand I went knocking
on strangers' doors, with the hope that they
might take an interest in my proposal.
I quickly became accustomed to being
dissed by profs who couldn't understand
why I didn't just major in their departments.
I remember calling home one night early
in my junior year, a single sympathetic fac
ulty member yet unfound, and complaining
to my parents, "I don't know what to do. If
I can't find anyone to back me then my
major won't get approved. And I can't grad
uate without a major."
Poor Mom and Dad have seen me
through many such crises.
When I decided in 11th grade that high
school was no longer bearable, they helped
me to figure out which colleges accepted
high school dropouts, and they saw me off
to Swarthmore.
Then, after I decided to transfer to Stan
ford, Ma and Pa gave me the green light to
take a year off from school to work. Now
the individually designed major.
By this point, they had re-mortgaged
their house to pay for their children's high
er education, and I had their unequivocal
support to major in whatever the hell I
wanted.
But when push came to shove and I
didn't think I could get what I wanted, they
said, "it's not the diploma that counts, it's
the education."
I want to justify that I wasn't trying to go
against the grain just to be a pain. When I
started at Stanford I fully intended on
majoring in something traditional.
But after a few quarters, I had the real
ization that I couldn't feel satisfied going
through college neglecting my passion,
painting. And yet I didn't want to spend all
my time painting at the expense of my other
intellectual interests. I didn't have time for
both, so I took the road less taken.
Maybe somewhere deep in my subcon

scious I was testing my parents. If so, they
passed with flying colors. I d once heard a
dormmate say that her parents thought it
was ridiculous that she was wasting her time
taking a single art class, and I ve heard
many would-be art majors say that their
parents wouldn't allow it because art is use
less.
Art may be useless in the way that your
soul is useless. I'm convinced useful majors
are soulless. 1 may not find a job that direct
ly correlates with my undergraduate work,
but I have no doubt that I'll find a job that
I'll enjoy. So what if the company doesn't
have a table at the career fair.
I must be blessed with good karma since
my parents don't seem to be worried. Once
I had their support I was able to continue
my search for enlightened faculty advisors
with renewed confidence. And by the end
of the month, I had located three excellent
advisors who enthusiastically endorsed my
proposal.
It has been almost a year now since my
major was approved by the IDM board, and
I'm relishing every moment of it.
Except the part of trying to explain it to
other people.
Their expressions often make me feel
like I'm cheating, because I don't have a
painfully oppressive major. So I've devel
oped this coping mechanism: blowing
myself off before anyone else does.
Today I'm making a truce with the
world. Don't judge me for my major, and I
won't judge you for yours. There's enough
room in the universe for each of us to do our
own thing.
I won't laugh if you won't.
And if you are one of the unfortunate in
the midst of I-can't-decide-what-to-major
in blues, I offer this: listen to what your
heart tells you. And if that doesn't already
exist, don't be afraid to make it a reality.

in philosophy and form of visual art, thinks
the most conventional part of her existence
is her individually designed major.
