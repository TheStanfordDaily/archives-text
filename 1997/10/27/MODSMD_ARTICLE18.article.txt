# Showering with the boys
## Vanessa Bartsch Just catching up on a Saturday night 
### 
THE DAMN SCREEN saver just came
on again.
One hundred and one Dalmatians play
fully run across the screen, jumping around,
losing their spots, joyously frolicking. The
one in particular that really cracks me up is
the puppy that throws up.
Actually. I think he is just shaking off soot
or whatever, but my freshman RA and 1 used
to sit in my room during winter quarter,
drinking hot chocolate with Kahlua and
laughing ourselves silly waiting for the dog.
Now I am not laughing. The maddening
little mutts are a reminder that 1 haven't writ
ten anything in 15 minutes. It is Saturday.
The day we all swear we w ill get "caught up."
Whatever.
Oh. don't get me wrong, 1 have managed
to get somewhat caught-up. ()n sleep, that is.
Thirteen blessed hours to be precise. A wild
Friday night consisting of a scrumptious, not
cooked-in-my-house dinner, a provocative
movie and a charming visit to the Sigma ( hi
house tuckered me out.
When 1 finally climbed over my books
that were lying accusingly on my floor and
tumbled into bed at 2 a.m., 1 was fully clothed
and barely coherent enough to kick oft my
shoes.
In the midst of a pleasant dream, the
phone jerked me toward reality. I answered
the call and checked the clock. Funny, I

thought, it looks like the clock says 3 o'clock.
But it is daylight, and I don't feel like I have
only slept an hour. 1 put my glasses on a
looked at my clock on the wall. It was indeed
3 p.m. Oh dear.
The thing is, when you wake up at 3 p.m.,
not only have you missed a couple major
meals, but also a significant portion of the
daylight hours. My awakening came with a
sick feeling of dread.
The wonderfully productive morning
hours 1 had so carefully planned the day
before had just been passed in a very
comatose stage. 1 was supposed to be catch
ing up.
Five weeks of unsurpassed fun and this
weekend was plotted just for work. But I was
not catching up on anything while lying in
bed.
After a shower and a bagel. I somewhat
frantically started Fhe List. I he I ist is ;i bad
sign. A terrible omen. When I start to list
anything it means that I am at a point beyond
where I can mentally handle all I have to do.
Mv big old filo-fax of a brain is just drop
ping the ball right and left. A list means that
I am turning to paper and ink to help me dis
tribute my seconds and hours that I have to
ration off. An eight-page paper, three musi
cal compositions, a course reader I haven't
opened — those took a few lines. I "lie rest
took a whole page.

I finished it and tried to get motivated.
But staring at that soi t of thing just makes me
depressed.
Because actually starting something
would be far too eas\ I did what any truh
clever student does. I procrastinated. I
checked my mail. I stopped by I he Daih to
get some film for a photo shoot three days
from now. I did ;i bunch ol useless things that
took me until \ p.m.. when the equestrian
team kindly and mercifully called me to piac
tice.
My day rumbled on. and I did a whole
bunch of really unimportant things, including
cleaning my room and thereby actually tern
porarih loosing the notebook with my list in
it.
Aftei a pseudo frantic search 1 found the
list and actually turned m\ computer on to
start a paper. But I couldn't think of anything
to write, even after having played two rounds
of I etris to help clear my mind.
So 1 decided to leave in\ room, which was
becoming an asylum. I wandered down to
Braun and sat in practice room three and
plunked away, trying to write something.
The only notes that were coming to nn head
were bits and pieces of "I ley hide" I hat
song was inhibiting every creative bone in my
body. 1 couldn't even cope with a measure.
Just "let it itut and let il in."
And worse than the mental block that

John's words were creating in my head was
the feeling ol silting in that damn room. I
started feeling like a fish jammed into a tank
that is too small.
With one wall of the piano room made
completely of glass, sound cannot travel in or
out ol the room. Thus the space is eerily
quite. People move by the outside and peer
in. I wished I could find a sunken ship to
swim Ivhind. I hit with only a bab\ grand ami
a bench, there was nowhere to go.
1 inall\ I gave in. Sometimes you need to
admit defeat and take it graciously. No more
fighting with words that won't let themselves
be typed. No more reading the same line
three times. No more playing wrong notes
again and again to the point where they
sound right.
Instead I got the hell off campus. I packed
myscll into my car and sang mv way down
2NO at a ever so slightl\ illegal pace. My dear
friend Ann's parents were traveling and her
house silting proved the perfect solution.
Within It) minutes o! my arrival, we were
in the hot tub. Silling in the steam bubbles
and actualh seeing the stars without the glare
ol the lights on ( ampus I )iive, we talked for
hours. We laughed until all our frustrations
were vented.
When we couldn't stand the heat any
more we crashed into the lamiK room and
threw in a perfect no-brainer movie, "The

I ruth About Cats And Dogs."
And tor two hours I slouched in a real
house. C )n a plush couch with a thick blanket.
With a golden retriever at my feet. And a cat
curled next to me. With my warmest fleece
pants and a huge swallowing Stanford sweat
shirt. With a mug o! peppermint tea and a
friend.
But it grew late and I had been awake
almost ii lull 12 hours. I felt tired. 1 got in my
car and headed oil to where the stars aren't
as bright. By the time 1 hit Page Mill. I had
already thought of a paper topic and a tune
was running through my head waiting to be
put on paper.
I figured that because we were switching
to standard time. I might as well kill my extra
hour, and I stopped oil at a little place that is
open all night.
I ordered ;i hot chocolate, and as I sipped
it this guy sat down next to me and we start
ed talking. I asked him what he had been
doing, and he said he had just gotten off
work. A late shift, lie asked me what I had
been doing. I laughed and said "catching up."

Vanessa Bartsch, a junior majoring in
music and political science, would like to
thank all the Jims for their courage in keep
ing their condoms ami their sense of humor.
She'd also like to say to all the Brians that
"llev, you've got me all wrong."

of I etris to help clear my mind.
So 1 decided to leave in\ room, which was
becoming an asylum. I wandered down to
Braun and sat in practice room three and
plunked away, trying to write something.
The only notes that were coming to nn head
were bits and pieces of "I ley hide" I hat
song was inhibiting every creative bone in my
body. 1 couldn't even cope with a measure.
Just "let it itut and let il in."
And worse than the mental block that

John's words were creating in my head was
the feeling ol silting in that damn room. I
started feeling like a fish jammed into a tank
that is too small.
With one wall of the piano room made
completely of glass, sound cannot travel in or
out ol the room. Thus the space is eerily
quite. People move by the outside and peer
in. I wished I could find a sunken ship to
swim Ivhind. I hit with only a bab\ grand ami
a bench, there was nowhere to go.
1 inall\ I gave in. Sometimes you need to
admit defeat and take it graciously. No more
fighting with words that won't let themselves
be typed. No more reading the same line
three times. No more playing wrong notes
again and again to the point where they
sound right.
Instead I got the hell off campus. I packed
myscll into my car and sang mv way down
2NO at a ever so slightl\ illegal pace. My dear
friend Ann's parents were traveling and her
house silting proved the perfect solution.
Within It) minutes o! my arrival, we were
in the hot tub. Silling in the steam bubbles
and actualh seeing the stars without the glare
ol the lights on ( ampus I )iive, we talked for
hours. We laughed until all our frustrations
were vented.
When we couldn't stand the heat any
more we crashed into the lamiK room and
threw in a perfect no-brainer movie, "The

I ruth About Cats And Dogs."
And tor two hours I slouched in a real
house. C )n a plush couch with a thick blanket.
With a golden retriever at my feet. And a cat
curled next to me. With my warmest fleece
pants and a huge swallowing Stanford sweat
shirt. With a mug o! peppermint tea and a
friend.
But it grew late and I had been awake
almost ii lull 12 hours. I felt tired. 1 got in my
car and headed oil to where the stars aren't
as bright. By the time 1 hit Page Mill. I had
already thought of a paper topic and a tune
was running through my head waiting to be
put on paper.
I figured that because we were switching
to standard time. I might as well kill my extra
hour, and I stopped oil at a little place that is
open all night.
I ordered ;i hot chocolate, and as I sipped
it this guy sat down next to me and we start
ed talking. I asked him what he had been
doing, and he said he had just gotten off
work. A late shift, lie asked me what I had
been doing. I laughed and said "catching up."

Vanessa Bartsch, a junior majoring in
music and political science, would like to
thank all the Jims for their courage in keep
ing their condoms ami their sense of humor.
She'd also like to say to all the Brians that
"llev, you've got me all wrong."

THE DAMN SCREEN saver just came
on again.
One hundred and one Dalmatians play
fully run across the screen, jumping around,
losing their spots, joyously frolicking. The
one in particular that really cracks me up is
the puppy that throws up.
Actually. I think he is just shaking off soot
or whatever, but my freshman RA and 1 used
to sit in my room during winter quarter,
drinking hot chocolate with Kahlua and
laughing ourselves silly waiting for the dog.
Now I am not laughing. The maddening
little mutts are a reminder that 1 haven't writ
ten anything in 15 minutes. It is Saturday.
The day we all swear we w ill get "caught up."
Whatever.
Oh. don't get me wrong, 1 have managed
to get somewhat caught-up. ()n sleep, that is.
Thirteen blessed hours to be precise. A wild
Friday night consisting of a scrumptious, not
cooked-in-my-house dinner, a provocative
movie and a charming visit to the Sigma ( hi
house tuckered me out.
When 1 finally climbed over my books
that were lying accusingly on my floor and
tumbled into bed at 2 a.m., 1 was fully clothed
and barely coherent enough to kick oft my
shoes.
In the midst of a pleasant dream, the
phone jerked me toward reality. I answered
the call and checked the clock. Funny, I

thought, it looks like the clock says 3 o'clock.
But it is daylight, and I don't feel like I have
only slept an hour. 1 put my glasses on a
looked at my clock on the wall. It was indeed
3 p.m. Oh dear.
The thing is, when you wake up at 3 p.m.,
not only have you missed a couple major
meals, but also a significant portion of the
daylight hours. My awakening came with a
sick feeling of dread.
The wonderfully productive morning
hours 1 had so carefully planned the day
before had just been passed in a very
comatose stage. 1 was supposed to be catch
ing up.
Five weeks of unsurpassed fun and this
weekend was plotted just for work. But I was
not catching up on anything while lying in
bed.
After a shower and a bagel. I somewhat
frantically started Fhe List. I he I ist is ;i bad
sign. A terrible omen. When I start to list
anything it means that I am at a point beyond
where I can mentally handle all I have to do.
Mv big old filo-fax of a brain is just drop
ping the ball right and left. A list means that
I am turning to paper and ink to help me dis
tribute my seconds and hours that I have to
ration off. An eight-page paper, three musi
cal compositions, a course reader I haven't
opened — those took a few lines. I "lie rest
took a whole page.

I finished it and tried to get motivated.
But staring at that soi t of thing just makes me
depressed.
Because actually starting something
would be far too eas\ I did what any truh
clever student does. I procrastinated. I
checked my mail. I stopped by I he Daih to
get some film for a photo shoot three days
from now. I did ;i bunch ol useless things that
took me until \ p.m.. when the equestrian
team kindly and mercifully called me to piac
tice.
My day rumbled on. and I did a whole
bunch of really unimportant things, including
cleaning my room and thereby actually tern
porarih loosing the notebook with my list in
it.
Aftei a pseudo frantic search 1 found the
list and actually turned m\ computer on to
start a paper. But I couldn't think of anything
to write, even after having played two rounds
of I etris to help clear my mind.
