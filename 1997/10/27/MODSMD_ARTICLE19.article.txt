their newborns.
This may sound worse, it may make lis
cringe and bring to surface our moral indig
nation, but it's not different. We turn our
faces in disgust at pictures of slaughtered
fetuses when protesters dare to post them.
Those images are too real, too disgust
ing. We don't want to see that, we don't
want to know that. But that is the status
quo, it is what we support and empower
when we throw around phrases like, "pro
choice" and "my body, my choice."
We are disgusted by our own actions
because what we do with our bodies has
dramatic implications not only to ourselves.

but on the state of the world around us.
We can and should be concerned about
what we or the rest of society "do with our
bodies." It suicide, the use of destructive
chemical substances and abortion go
unchecked, what happens to the responsi
bility of the government to protect the lives
and rights of its citi/ens?
We are killing our babies, and now we
are killing ourselves. We need to draw line
before we truly lose control of our destinies
and our world.
