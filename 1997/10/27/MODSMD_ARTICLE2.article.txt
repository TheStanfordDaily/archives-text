Orson Cutler Shepard, professor
emeritus of materials science and en
gineering. died of heart failure Oct.
16 at his campus home. I le was 94.
Shepard was a part of the Stan
ford community for 75 years and led
the way for Stanford's accomplish
ments in materials science.
"He was the father of our depart
ment in the modern form," said Ma
terials Science and F/ngkieciing De
partment Chair William Nix. "And
you can only have one father."
Nix learned from as well as taught
with Shepard. "He had a kind of
quiet courage that not everybody
has. He was quiet, understated and
very conservative, but he had a huge

impact at Stanford," explained Nix.
Shepard's family remains tied to
the University, as his son, Roger
Shepard. is the Ray Lvman Wilbur
Professor Emeritus of Psychology.
Shepard, called Cutler by his fam
ily. received both his bachelor's in
mining and metallurgy and his engi
neering degree at Stanford. He
taught process metallurgy and ce
ramics here during the 19305, and he
published a textbook on fire assay
ing. or analysis, in 1940.
"He really brought a scicnee
bitte'd approach to materials" by de
veloping new physical metallurgy
courses in the 19405, said Nix. "He
had a major impact on the teaching
of materials science at Stanford."
Metallurgy is the science of sepa
rating metals from their ores and
preparing them for use by smelting
and refining. Sheparrd focused on
physical metallurgy, the science of al
tering the ore's internal structure so
as to control its properties.
Shepard "really brought the Uni
versity into the field | of physical met
allurgy! ty recognizing its impact and

that the basic idea of metallurgy
should he expanded." said Nix.
Shepard was also one of the Uni
versity's first professors to direct
sponsored research on materials, in
cluding the study of the effects of the
environment on metals, materials
problems in nuclear reactions and
the wetting and mass transfer in solid
metal-liquid metal systems.
In 1957, Shepard headed the
newly formed Department of Metal
lurgy and changed it into the I Depart
ment of Materials Science in 1960.
"He was at the helm when the de

partment changed." Nix said.
He was the first head of that de
partment — soon to become one of
the nation's foremost materials sci
ence departments — and remained
its chair until 1967.
Shepard retired from Stanford in
1968 but still participated in Univer
sity events.
"Shepard was very engaged... in
life. He stayed interested in the de
partment and University long after
he retired," said Nix. "He still came
to seminars after his retirement."
Nix related that Shepard watched

a mediocre seminar and "as an KB
- man was able to put his lin
ger on the key thing that was wrong'
with the way the scientific processes
were described.
His wife, Grace, died last year.
They are survived by their son,
daughter, niece and grandchildren.
The family asks that contributions in
Shepard's honor be made to the O.C.
Shepard Fund. Department of Mate
rials Science and Engineering, or to
the Mid-Peninsula Hospice.
A campus memorial service will
be announced.
