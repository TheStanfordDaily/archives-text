After kicking off the weekend with a I
-0 overtime win over Washington State on
Friday. Stanford ended its home slate yes
terday with a hard-fought 3-2 upset of No.
11 Washington (6-10. 4-2) before fans
at New Maloney Field.
Stanford played a physical game Friday
against the Cougars (7-7.2-3). After a slug
gish start, the Cardinal soon found a
rhythm and controlled the ball for most of
the game.
"We adjusted, but the first 20 minutes
wasn't our game," said head coach Steve
Swanson.
The Cougars put together a good pos
session with 21 minutes left in the half, cul
minating in a near-miss on a shot that sailed
just above the crossbar. The attack seemed
to take something out of the (Cardinal, as its
defense began to falter. But Stanford fresh

man goalie Carly Smolak picked up the
slack, stopping several key attempts.
After Stanford failed to capitalize on two
key chances near the end of regulation, the
game then went into sudden-death over
time. Only 46 seconds into the extra period,
freshman midfielder Shauna Itri passed off
to senior forward Emily Burt, who redirect
ed it for the game-winning goal.
"1 was glad I made the last goal," Burt
said. "That should've made up for the one
at the end of regulation."
The entire game was one of adjustment
for the Cardinal.
"Oftentimes teams don't make those
adjustments, but we did this game," Swan
son said.
In a much more hard-fought and high
scoring game yesterday against the 11th
ranked Huskies. Stanford came out with
more intensity.
Senior midfielder Rita I lermi/exempli
fied the aggressive game plan when she
smacked into a Husky player in mid-air,
drawing a foul but slowing the momentum
of a potential drive. Not long after. I lermi/
headed in a cross pass from sophomore
midfielder Ronnie Fair to put Stanford up
1-0.
The first hall concluded without further
scoring. But only eight minutes into the
second half, Washington put together a
scoring drive of its own. as Jana Wilson
brought the Huskies back to 1-1.

Stanford pulled ahead again on Hurt's
second goal of the weekend — her 11th of
the year — on an assist from junior mid
fielder Tracye Lawyer with 26:04 left. But
the 1 luskies came hack with a game-tying
goal by Angie Crivello with only 7:50 re
maining.
It looked as if the match would be a re
peat of Friday's and head into overtime,
but Burt once again knocked in the game
winning goal on an assist by Lawyer with
just :38 left to lift Stanford to a dramatic 3-
2 win.
"It could easily have been a 5-2 or 6-2
game, but we let them back into the game."
said Swanson, who was nonetheless im
pressed with the Cardinal's play.
"We're excited we won the game
against one of the top teams in the country,
and I was happy 1 scored that one at the
end," Burt said. But "I wouldn't have made
it if Tracye Lawyer hadn't set it up."
Sunday marked the last home game of
the season for the Cardinal. "It was really
great for the seniors (Burt, Hermi/ and
midfielder Elie Foster) to end at home with
a win," Swanson said.
With the two victories, the once-strug
gling Cardinal now finds itself on the win
ning side of a modest four-game streak.
"We're winning games we lost earlier in
the season," Swanson said. "I think the
good measure of the team is how far they
come. We've come a long way this season."
