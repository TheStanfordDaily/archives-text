the Cardinal's 3-0 victory over Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo yesterday.
Clark said he thought the team
looked "a little bit scrappy," espe
cially in the first half. "1 don't think
we quite connected the way I would
have liked to."
But the game resulted in some
"real positives," he added.
The game also marked Senior
Day for the Cardinal. Clark got all

six seniors — including Jeff Szt'k
eres and Jason Roeder, both of
whom have been kept off the field
all season due to injuries — into the
game.
Clark and Sauer agreed that the
Indiana match remained on the play

a "one-game-at-a-time" philosophy.
"They're looking to Indiana. I
can't blame them," Clark said.
"I don't think I'll have to moti
