a team-high 15 kills for a .344 hitting
percentage. But the performances
of freshmen Robyn Lewis, a setter,
and Jennifer Detmer, a middle
blocker, were perhaps more no
table. I ,ewis totaled 27 assists filling
in for senior Lisa Sharpley in just
over two games, and Detmer got
five kills on six attacks while tally
ing three block assists.
"Oregon played well," Shaw
said. "It's a hard match for us to go
out and stay sharp the whole match.
(In game three) they made some
great plays, and we made some er
rors. We're playing tough match
es."
Yesterday's game two against
the Heavers may be the toughest

gut-check the Card has had in a
while. After the Cardinal cruised to
an 8-0 lead in game one and finished
it off easily 15-8. Stanford and Ore
gon State temporarily forgot which
team was which.
Amid a plethora of net violation
calls on both sides, Oregon State
built a 12-3 lead behind the hitting
of senior outside hitters Pia Ahlen
gard and Heather Lowe, who fin
ished the match with 16 and 15 kills,
respectively.
Hut the Cardinal block picked il
up and went on a 10-1 run to tie the
game 13-13. The Heavers never
gave up and pulled ahead for three
game points, as the score see-sawed
to 16-16. Hut Stanford scored the
last three points of the game on two
Folkl kills and a kill by senior mid
dle blocker Barbara Ifejika.
" The first part of game two is as

poor as we've played in a while,"
Shaw said. "And they were playing
well. They just couldn't quite sus
tain it. We changed up the timing of
our blocks and once we got a couple
of blocks in. [we were able to win].
That pretty much finished them
off."
Indeed. Oregon State was a de
feated team in game three, as Stan
lord cruised 15-4. Folkl and Ifejika
led the offensive charge with 26 and
14 kills, respectively, and co-cap
tain Sharpley posted a season-best
65 assists despite playing with the
II Ll.
"Folkl had a good match," Shaw
said. "She just played solid and
steady. For Lisa, that was a pretty
gutty performance. She wasn't feel
ing well. Now we've got seven
matches left and a three-game cush
ion. We're in pretty good shape."
