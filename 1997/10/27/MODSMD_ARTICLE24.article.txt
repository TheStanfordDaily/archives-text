The Cardinal duo, ranked No. 3
in the nation in doubles, followed up
their opening round disappoint
ment with a 6-4, 6-0 victory over
South Carolina's Karolina Bulat
and Tobi Rakic, ranked No. 8 na

Scott and Bleszynski then met the
top seed in the consolation final. Mis

"I had a few tough matches in the
qualifying draw." Ashley said. "I
think those matches prepared me
well for the main draw and I was real
ly ready to play in that match, while
[Schmidt] was playing her first match
of the year."
Unfortunately, the win meant a
meeting with Muzamel. the top-rated
singles player in the country. Ashley
put up an impressive battle after
nearly winning the first set and forced
Muzamel into a three-set match.
But the Mississippi junior proved
to be too much for Ashley, as Muza
mel advanced with a 7-5.4-6.6-4 vic

didn't gel to play at this level of com
