Change is good. And it was especially good for
the Stanford field hockey team this weekend at the
California Invitational.

FIELD HOCKEY
■ SATURDAY'S RESULTS: Stanford 1, Simon
I raser 0; Stanford 5, UC-Santa Barbara 0

The Cardinal shuffled its lineup but still man
aged to defeat Simon Fraser 1-0 and UC-Santa
Barbara 5-0 in Berkeley Saturday.
"In the first game, we were a little slow because
we knew we had another game afterwards," said
junior forward ('arey ('loyd.
It may have taken Stanford awhile to get going,
but once it did. the ( 'ardinal played solidly for the
remainder of the game.
"Once one person gets a spark of adrenaline, it
nets contagious." said freshman forward Nicole

Waskovich.
"Initially ... we weren't finishing our shots,"
said junior midfielder Jordyn Kramer. "We had
several opportunities that we did not capitalize
on."
It could be that after facing tough competition
on its recently concluded Boston road trip, the Car
dinal didn't take this less experienced team as seri
ously. But Stanford is taking steps to increase its
scoring output.
" This week in practice, we're working on re
ceiving the ball and finishing our corner shots,"
Kramer said.
Saturday's second match was a coming-out
party for senior goalkeeper Kelly Naylor — com
ing out of the goal, that is. Naylor stepped out of the
goal cage against UC-Santa Barbara and suited up
to play right midfield.
"She was awesome," Waskovich said. "She re
ally showed what an all-around great athlete she
is."
"We were all so excited to have Kelly in there,"
said senior midfielder Paige Mader. "And to add to

it, she almost scored a goal."
The UCSB match not only showcased the Car
dinal's depth, it also did wonders in terms of team
building. Everyone got playing time, and everyone
got the opportunity to show just what she could do.
"The younger players showed they were just as
competent out there as the rest of us," Kramer
said. "They had a lot of confidence and even more
enthusiasm."
The Cardinal came out strong from the start
and maintained a high intensity level throughout
the match. Mader cited Waskovich's goal as a shin
ing moment.
"She went down the left side of the field,
dodged her opponent with a pull and put in a great
shot," Mader said.
Playing back-to-back games didn't slow Stan
ford's momentum. The Cardinal played cohesive
ly against the Gauchos and even took advantage of
several give-and-go opportunities.
"We spread the field well and definitely gave
1 (K) percent the whole time," Waskovich said. "1
don't know it the other team did."
