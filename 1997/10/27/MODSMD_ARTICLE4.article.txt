# EL NIÑO
## Stanford officials gearing up for a wet winter 
### Brad Heinz 
In a normal year, "El Nino" is a term more
likely to eome up in a first-year Spanish class
than in a course on climate variability. This year,
however. El Nino raises the specter of severe
winter weather, perhaps resulting in wet bicycle
trips to class, canceled outdoor sporting events
and even Hooding, sandbagging, roof leaks and
power outages.
At Stanford, facilities managers have already
begun to gear up for a stormy winter. Rich
Daniels, projects coordinator for the Student
Housing Office's Special Projects Division, has

personally examined all student residences and
mapped the location of storm drains and catch
basins.
With Daniels' information, Roto-Rooter has
begun to remove debris and report any damage.
Daniels said this winter he expects to avoid the
kinds of losses that student housing experienced
in when Hooding caused water damage to
the ground floor of f>8() Eoinita.
The Facilities Operations Department is
testing some unique new equipment that auto
matically prepares sandbags, though the depart
ment has not vet determined whether to pur
chase the machinery.

the department's health and safety
specialist, said the University is re
viewing its emergency plans, en
hancing its emergency communica
tions and stocking extra supplies for
dealing with inclement weather.
Athletes playing winter sports
may need to adjust to practicing in
the rain. "()u(door sports will not be
played indoors," said (iary Migdol.
assistant athletic director for media
relations. Certain sports — such as
baseball and tennis — are always de
layed or canceled in case of rain.
While soccer might be played in the
rain, "there are conditions in which
any sport could be called." Migdol
said. "I Jmpiresand referees for each
sport make the decision [to cancel]
based on the game book [for the
sport |."
Does the campus really face a
winter that conforms to the most
dire weather predictions? Robert
I )unbnr, professor of geological and
environmental sciences, said there is
a probability that this winter will be

wetter than normal. Nevertheless,
the severe forecasts most people
have heard really apply to areas in
the southern part of the state. El
Nino may influence the amount of
precipitation here, but there are too
many other factors to know for sure
how El Nino will affect the wet sea
son in Northern California, Dunbar
said.
El Nino is a disruption of the
ocean-atmosphere system in the
tropical Pacific characterized by the
appearance of unusually warm
water in the eastern Pacific, accord
ing to a report of the ('ommerce De
partment's National Oceanic and
Atmosphere Administration.
It occurs every few years and is
blamed for drought and devastating
brush fires in Australia and Indone
sia, as well as increased rainfall and
destructive flooding in an area ex
tending from the southern part of
the I J.S. to Peru and Brazil.
Peruvian fishermen first recog
nized the recurrent appearance of
unusually warm water in the late
19th century, according to Dunbar.
They gave it the name "El Nino" —
meaning, the "male child" or "little
one" in Spanish — because of the
tendency of the phenomenon to
occur around C hristmas.

Dunbar explained that the effects
of El Nino are difficult to predict in
Northern California because it is lo
cated in a "telecommunicated re
gion" where winter storms generat
ed in the Gulf of Alaska track south
depending upon jet streams and
upper level winds. El Nino factors
affect the Pacific storm track, but no
one knows for sure what will emerge
in Northern California from the
"noise" created by all of these mete
orological events.
Scientists have noticed a particu
larly sharp increase in sea surface
temperatures — more than 5 de
grees Celsius (almost 11 degrees
Fahrenheit) — in the eastern tropi
cal Pacific this year, according to the
Commerce Department. Any in
crease over 2 degrees Celsius is con
sidered a "Type I El Nino Southern
Oscillation" event.
For the eight Type I winter El
Nino events since 1950. rainfall in
San Francisco has averaged about 37
percent above normal, according to
a report of the Geosciences Depart
ment at San Francisco State I Iniver
sity. For two of the eight events, rain
fall did not increase. However, in
1982-83, a winter also characterized
by particularly strong El Nino condi
tions, rainfall in San Francisco ex

ceeded ISO percent of normal. This
year. Stanford's Environmental
Safety and Health Department is
warning of National Weather Ser
vice predictions that the Bay Area
may receive 150 to 200 percent of
normal rainfall.
El Nino can affect both the total
amount of rainfall and the intensity
of individual storms, according to
Dunbar. A deluge that occurred
during the El Nino of 1992-93
brought widespread flooding and
devastation to parts of Northern
California. Moreover, this El Nino is
unprecedented because it devel
oped four to live months earlier than
normal, according to Dunbar.
"It started so early that it could
end early, but it could also mean that
it will extend longer and we'll have
wet weather for two seasons." Dun
bar said.
The Central American and North
American coasts have already expe
rienced the impact of this El Nino.
"It's fair to say that some of the
hurricanes that went further east (se
verely affecting Acapulco and af
fecting the entire coast north to
Southern California) are due to El
Nino," said Dunbar. "That's no
longer a prediction, it's something
that happened."

ing storm-related tips. Koni Gordon,
the department's health and safety
specialist, said the University is re
viewing its emergency plans, en
hancing its emergency communica
tions and stocking extra supplies for
dealing with inclement weather.
Athletes playing winter sports
may need to adjust to practicing in
the rain. "()u(door sports will not be
played indoors," said (iary Migdol.
assistant athletic director for media
relations. Certain sports — such as
baseball and tennis — are always de
layed or canceled in case of rain.
While soccer might be played in the
rain, "there are conditions in which
any sport could be called." Migdol
said. "I Jmpiresand referees for each
sport make the decision [to cancel]
based on the game book [for the
sport |."
Does the campus really face a
winter that conforms to the most
dire weather predictions? Robert
I )unbnr, professor of geological and
environmental sciences, said there is
a probability that this winter will be

wetter than normal. Nevertheless,
the severe forecasts most people
have heard really apply to areas in
the southern part of the state. El
Nino may influence the amount of
precipitation here, but there are too
many other factors to know for sure
how El Nino will affect the wet sea
son in Northern California, Dunbar
said.
El Nino is a disruption of the
ocean-atmosphere system in the
tropical Pacific characterized by the
appearance of unusually warm
water in the eastern Pacific, accord
ing to a report of the ('ommerce De
partment's National Oceanic and
Atmosphere Administration.
It occurs every few years and is
blamed for drought and devastating
brush fires in Australia and Indone
sia, as well as increased rainfall and
destructive flooding in an area ex
tending from the southern part of
the I J.S. to Peru and Brazil.
Peruvian fishermen first recog
nized the recurrent appearance of
unusually warm water in the late
19th century, according to Dunbar.
They gave it the name "El Nino" —
meaning, the "male child" or "little
one" in Spanish — because of the
tendency of the phenomenon to
occur around C hristmas.

Dunbar explained that the effects
of El Nino are difficult to predict in
Northern California because it is lo
cated in a "telecommunicated re
gion" where winter storms generat
ed in the Gulf of Alaska track south
depending upon jet streams and
upper level winds. El Nino factors
affect the Pacific storm track, but no
one knows for sure what will emerge
in Northern California from the
"noise" created by all of these mete
orological events.
Scientists have noticed a particu
larly sharp increase in sea surface
temperatures — more than 5 de
grees Celsius (almost 11 degrees
Fahrenheit) — in the eastern tropi
cal Pacific this year, according to the
Commerce Department. Any in
crease over 2 degrees Celsius is con
sidered a "Type I El Nino Southern
Oscillation" event.
For the eight Type I winter El
Nino events since 1950. rainfall in
San Francisco has averaged about 37
percent above normal, according to
a report of the Geosciences Depart
ment at San Francisco State I Iniver
sity. For two of the eight events, rain
fall did not increase. However, in
1982-83, a winter also characterized
by particularly strong El Nino condi
tions, rainfall in San Francisco ex

ceeded ISO percent of normal. This
year. Stanford's Environmental
Safety and Health Department is
warning of National Weather Ser
vice predictions that the Bay Area
may receive 150 to 200 percent of
normal rainfall.
El Nino can affect both the total
amount of rainfall and the intensity
of individual storms, according to
Dunbar. A deluge that occurred
during the El Nino of 1992-93
brought widespread flooding and
devastation to parts of Northern
California. Moreover, this El Nino is
unprecedented because it devel
oped four to live months earlier than
normal, according to Dunbar.
"It started so early that it could
end early, but it could also mean that
it will extend longer and we'll have
wet weather for two seasons." Dun
bar said.
The Central American and North
American coasts have already expe
rienced the impact of this El Nino.
"It's fair to say that some of the
hurricanes that went further east (se
verely affecting Acapulco and af
fecting the entire coast north to
Southern California) are due to El
Nino," said Dunbar. "That's no
longer a prediction, it's something
that happened."
