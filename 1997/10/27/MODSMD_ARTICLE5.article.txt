Many people simply talk or complain about the effects
of El Nino. Professor Robert Dunbar is actually doing
something about it.
A new professor in the (ieological and Environmen
tal Sciences I Department, I Dunbar is one ol Stanford's ex
perts on the El Nino climate phenomenon. I le has done
extensive research on the subject by journeying to areas
where previous I I Nino .Southern ()scillation cycles have
left their traces.
Last week. Dunbar returned from a tripto I aiming Is
land in the central Pacific, where he gathered samples ol
corals that were killed by the warm ocean currents that
typify El Nino. He hopes that the samples will help tie
termine the effects ol this year's I I Nino, which is pre
dieted to be one of the strongest ever recorded.
"This El Nino is unusual because it's starting early,"
Dunbar said. "It began showing effects in March and
April that we didn't expect to see until ()ctoher."
