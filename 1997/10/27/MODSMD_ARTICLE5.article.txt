# Stanford's own El Niño expert predicts stormy days to come

### Rito Treviño Staff writer 
Many people simply talk or complain about the effects
of El Nino. Professor Robert Dunbar is actually doing
something about it.
A new professor in the (ieological and Environmen
tal Sciences I Department, I Dunbar is one ol Stanford's ex
perts on the El Nino climate phenomenon. I le has done
extensive research on the subject by journeying to areas
where previous I I Nino .Southern ()scillation cycles have
left their traces.
Last week. Dunbar returned from a tripto I aiming Is
land in the central Pacific, where he gathered samples ol
corals that were killed by the warm ocean currents that
typify El Nino. He hopes that the samples will help tie
termine the effects ol this year's I I Nino, which is pre
dieted to be one of the strongest ever recorded.
"This El Nino is unusual because it's starting early,"
Dunbar said. "It began showing effects in March and
April that we didn't expect to see until ()ctoher."

Geological and Environmental Sciences Prof.
Robert Dunbar is looking for this year to be an
important one for his chosen field of study, the
climatic phenomenon known as El Nino.
If the latest El Nino turns out to
be as powerful as researchers specu
late, it would be the second of its kind
in 20 years. The strongest one on
record occurred in 1982-83. Dunbar
hypothesizes that this may have links
to global warming and human alter
ation of atmospheric carbon dioxide
levels.
"It would be unprecedented to
have two [major] El Ninos this close
together," he said. "It may be a sign
of anthropogenic influences on the
planet."
The phenomenon first piqued
Dunbar's interest when he was an
undergraduate at the University of
Texas at Austin. When he learned
that the 1972-73 El Nino caused the
unrecoverable collapse of the Peru
vian fisheries, resulting in the deaths
of thousands, he wanted to study the
force behind the devastation.
After obtaining degrees in
oceanography and earth science,
Dunbar spent 16 years at Rice Uni
versity. He decided to come to Stan
ford this fall as the first professor
hired in the University's Ocean Mar
gins Initiative, a new program geared

toward the study of land and sea in
teractions along the coasts of the
Americas.
After moving to California in
September, Dunbar wasted little
time preparing lor a trip into the
field. He targeted Fanning Island in
the Republic of Kiribati as an ideal
area for studying El Nino.
"This island is a 'sweet spot' for El
Nino," Dunbar remarked, pointing
out its location in temperature charts
from past El Nino Southern Oscilla
tion cycles.
Traveling to the island, particular
ly for an academic group on a tight
budget, turned out to be somewhat
of an adventure. According to Dun
bar, Fanning Island had not seen re
searchers since the l%()s.
" The island had a population of
2.(XX), of which 1,2(X) were children,"
Dunbar noted. "There was no elec
tricity and no medical services."
Dunbar's group consisted of two
graduate students from Stanford, as
well as a professor and a student
from the State University of New
York at Albany. With them they
brought 1,5(X) pounds of underwater
drilling equipment and scuba gear.
Dunbar said that a state-of-the
art geochemistry laboratory is being
set up in Stanford's Cireen Earth Sci

ences Building. When his coral sam
ples arrive from the central Pacific,
he will analyze their stratified growth
bands as one might study the rings of
a tree trunk.
The results of this and future stud
ies may help predict El Nino's effects
on areas as far as southern Africa,
Dunbar said. Nations such as Kenya
and industries such as the coffee
growers in Brazil, where El Nino
tends to dry out crops, are interested
in his type of work, he explained.
As far as El Nino's effect on the
Bay Area, Dunbar said he remains
speculative.
"We'd expect this year's weather
patterns to be analogous to the 19K2-
83 El Nino, when it was pretty wet
here," Dunbar said. "With this year's
El Nino, the storms of previous years
are statistically more likely to occur.
That's as much as we can say."
Dunbar was quick to point out
that the rumors of this being the
biggest El Nino on record will be
wr- ked out soon enough.
"The typical things that happen
are already happening," he said.
"The verdict isn't quite in. but we'll
get it within two to three months. So
why speculate?"
Dunbar's spectrum of work is
hardly limited to the subject of El

Nino. Among his past research ef
forts have been coastal sediment
studies in Peru and Chile and a study
of rainfall in Bolivia. He has also
been observing changes in the ice
sheets of Antarctica since 1982.
Student participation in field re
search is important to him, Dunbar
said. Over winter break, he will take
three Stanford students — two grad
uates and one undergraduate — on
his yearly trip to Antarctica. Next
year he plans to expand the same
trip to a two-month study with five
students and teach a class along the
way.
"I'd like to get more undergradu
ates involved," he said. "These trips
give diversity to the educational ex
perience."
As a professor in the Geology De
partment, Dunbar will also be an ac
tive lecturer. When he arrived at the
Farm, he made proposals for five
new classes, of which he'll teach two
this year.
His first class, to be offered next
quarter, will concentrate on climate
variability and forcing mechanisms.
There will be a special focus on. or
course, El Nino. Students will have
the opportunity to learn about the
wintertime phenomenon as it un
folds.
