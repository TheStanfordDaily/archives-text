## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Senior staff writer 
A major recall of condoms issued hv a
manufacturer last week prompted an ur
gent campus-wide warning to students,
raising student concerns and creating in
formation chaos.
Five brands of condoms were recalled,
among them products distributed to the
student body free of charge by the Stu
dent Health Peer Resource Center. The
center is an independent student-run or
ganization that deals with issues of sexual
health.
The products reported to be defective
were also among the condoms some of
the peer health educators had in their
possession for their residents.
"It was kind of scary," said sophomore
Melora Krehs-C'arter. a counselor at the
center who is also the peer health educa
tor in J unipero."()bviously, they've been
out there for a long time."
The ordeal started Thursday when

various media organizations reported
that Ansell Personal Products of Eaton
town, N.J. had announced that fears of
product breakage had led them to con
duct a nationwide recall of more than 57
million condoms.
The condom company said its
LifeStyles, Prime, and Contempo con
doms with spermicidal lubricant "have
been found to deteriorate before the end
of their shelf life and may not adequately
protect against pregnancy or sexually
transmitted disease," according to a
Reuters report on Thursday.
( arol ( arrozza, director of marketing
for Ansell, said, according to Reuters,
that after eight customer complaints on
product breakage, the company "tested
our own retained lots of these samples,
[and] they did not meet American Soci
ety for Testing Methods standards."
Numerous e-mail messages were sent
out to inform students of the situation and
to halt the spread of misleading rumors.
The members of the center got to

gether immediately following the inci
dent and sent back the defective brands
they had in stock at their offices in the
C owe 11 Student Health Center, accord
ing to Krebs-( 'artcr.
As a peer health educator, Krebs
C arter also got rid of some condoms she
had stored 111 her room lor her residents.
"I had two kinds that were |among|
the five brands," she said. "I just cut them
and threw them out so no one would use
them by mistake."
Krebs ( arter added that so far, none
of her residents have come to her with
specif ic concerns.
I lammerskjold resident assistant Vivi
Alyeshmerni, a senior, said she received
numerous e-mails warning her ab(>ut the
issue, first from the RA lists, followed by
her friends Irom out of state.
"What was amazing was how I re
ceived several e-mails within live min
utes." she said. "It was interesting be
cause I suddenly had to take inventory ol
who was having sex in the house and

whether il was my role |;is RA| to see if
they were sexually sale."
Alyeshmerni said she distributed the
warnings to the house e-mail list.
"I want my residents to be aware ol
this, especially be lore the weekend," she
said on I riday.
Specific affected brands include:
l.ileStyles Ultra Sensitive with spermi
eide, l.ileStyles Assorted Colors with
spermicide, I ileStyles Spermicidally I u
hricated, I ileStyles Vihra Ribbed with
spermicide, l.ileStyles l.xtra Strength
with spermicide and < 'ontempo Intensity
Assorted ( olors with spermicide.
According to Ansell, the condoms in
