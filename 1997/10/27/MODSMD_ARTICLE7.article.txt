# Panelists discuss genetic testing for Alzheimer's gene
## 
### Bill Bowen 
Continuing the recent debate in the
federal government over the implica
tions of genetic testing, geneticists, doc
tors. insurance executives and policy
makers discussed the issue Saturday in
Kresge Auditorium.
I he Stanford University Program in
Genomics. Ethics and Society spon
sored the all-day conference to discuss
the social, economic and ethical conse
quences of genetic testing, specifically
for patients with Alzheimer's disease.

With advances in genetic testing, pa
tients are beginning to question whether
the tests can be used to determine insur
arice premiums or to deny coverage.
For now. though, insurance policy
holders with the Alzheimer's gene wili
not be denied coverage, said Linda
Goodwin, a representative of the Amer
ican Council of Life Insurance Medical
Section. Research has not proven a sul
ficiently strong link between
Alzheimer's disease and the associated
gene, she said.
However, panelists raised concerns

about whether more accurate tesls
would be used to determine future in
surance coverage.
"If we were to use a genetic test to de
termine long-term care policy, it would
have to predict both il and when an indi
vidual would get Al/heimer's disease.
(ioodwin responded.
However, lawmakers have already
passed several bills protecting privacy ol
genetic information in anticipation ol
future genetic testing issues.
Unfortunately, this raises additional
problems in finding patients for re

search, panelists agreed. Legislation
that requires written authorization Cot
release of genetic test results would also
give researchers less access to inlorma
lion.
"We must make sure the rules work
to promote progress and research and
not hinder it. said Robert ( ook Dee
gan, director of the National ( anccr I'ol
icy Board
Cieorge Cunningham, chief ol the
Cienelic Disease Branch ol California's
Department of Health Services ad
dressed the need to educate citizens
about genetic testing and the related
issues. C alifornia currently has a
piovision that grades kindergarten
to 12 must have some genetics in the
curriculum.
"Unfortunately, this program is
implemented by more than 1.5(H)
local school boards with other prior
ities." ('unningham said. "It is a pro
gram that lias potential, but is as yet
unrealized."
While there was some disagree
ment on I utino implications of ge
netic testing, all panelists agreed
that current Alzheimer's tests are

not accurate enough to warrant con
cern.
"In resolving questions about the
importance of Alzheimer's tests, I
would have to resort to the Scotch
judicial system, rejecting the ver
dicts of 'guilty' and not guilty' for
'not proven'," ( unningham said.
In addition to concerns about ge
netic testing, speakers addressed
general problems with health care
coverage to seniors. Whereas
Medicare supports acute care needs,
long-term care for dementia is only
covered by Medicaid and private in
surance companies.
" I he problem of long-term care
will always be with us no matter how
long we can delay medical prob
lems." ("unningham said.
