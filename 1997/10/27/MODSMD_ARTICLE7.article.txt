### Bill Bowen 
Continuing the recent debate in the
federal government over the implica
tions of genetic testing, geneticists, doc
tors. insurance executives and policy
makers discussed the issue Saturday in
Kresge Auditorium.
I he Stanford University Program in
Genomics. Ethics and Society spon
sored the all-day conference to discuss
the social, economic and ethical conse
quences of genetic testing, specifically
for patients with Alzheimer's disease.

With advances in genetic testing, pa
tients are beginning to question whether
the tests can be used to determine insur
arice premiums or to deny coverage.
For now. though, insurance policy
holders with the Alzheimer's gene wili
not be denied coverage, said Linda
Goodwin, a representative of the Amer
ican Council of Life Insurance Medical
Section. Research has not proven a sul
ficiently strong link between
Alzheimer's disease and the associated
gene, she said.
However, panelists raised concerns

about whether more accurate tesls
would be used to determine future in
surance coverage.
"If we were to use a genetic test to de
termine long-term care policy, it would
have to predict both il and when an indi
vidual would get Al/heimer's disease.
(ioodwin responded.
However, lawmakers have already
passed several bills protecting privacy ol
genetic information in anticipation ol
future genetic testing issues.
Unfortunately, this raises additional
problems in finding patients for re

search, panelists agreed. Legislation
that requires written authorization Cot
release of genetic test results would also
give researchers less access to inlorma
lion.
"We must make sure the rules work
to promote progress and research and
not hinder it. said Robert ( ook Dee
