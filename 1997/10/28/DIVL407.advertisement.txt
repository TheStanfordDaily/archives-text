ASSU Top 10 List

Many at Stanford wonder what the ASSU-Stanford student government does for them. This year, the ASSU Senate has pledged to answer thee questions.
We're proposing this ASSU Top 10 list - a description of the projects the ASSU Senate pledges to complete by the end of our term in May.
These aren't the only goals for the Senate this year, just ones that we've started working on and have committed to. Let us know if you have any other
ideas or questions. We look forward to working with you!

of funding every year, while ensuring that student representatives govern the process.
