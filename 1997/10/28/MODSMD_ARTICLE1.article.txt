# Course guide, special fees among issues on agenda
## ASSU top 10 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
In an effort to enhance commu
nication between elected student
leaders and the student body, the
ASSU has released a top 10 list of
projects it pledges to complete by
the end of the year.
Among the items included arc
the creation of a student course
evaluation guide for winter quarter,
an overhaul of the special-fee fund
ing process by which student groups
receive funds, teaching awards for
professors and teaching assistants,
funding for a freshman executive
body and graduate student housing
lottery reform.
"The ASSU Senate released our
agenda to the public both to in
crease student awareness of the
ASSU activities and to increase our
accountability to students," said
ASSU Senate Chair Joe Freund, a
junior. "By clearly defining our

agenda, we ensure that at the end of
the year we will be held accountable
for our actions."
At first some within the ASSU
were unsure about making the sen
ate's goals public. "But it became
clear," said Senate Deputy Chair
Matt Spence, a sophomore, "any
type of successful agenda needs to
be made public."
The ASSU'sNo. 1 project for the
year, on which the ASSU has al
ready made substantial progress, is
the creation of a course guide by
winter quarter that would contain
quantitative data from student eval
uations of professors and classes.
"The course guide has universal
support from students," said ASSU
Vice President Ben Decker, a se
nior. "I don't think that there is a sin
gle student that doesn't think it will
be useful."
