# Course guide, special fees among issues on agenda
## ASSU top 10 
### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
In an effort to enhance commu
nication between elected student
leaders and the student body, the
ASSU has released a top 10 list of
projects it pledges to complete by
the end of the year.
Among the items included arc
the creation of a student course
evaluation guide for winter quarter,
an overhaul of the special-fee fund
ing process by which student groups
receive funds, teaching awards for
professors and teaching assistants,
funding for a freshman executive
body and graduate student housing
lottery reform.
"The ASSU Senate released our
agenda to the public both to in
crease student awareness of the
ASSU activities and to increase our
accountability to students," said
ASSU Senate Chair Joe Freund, a
junior. "By clearly defining our

agenda, we ensure that at the end of
the year we will be held accountable
for our actions."
At first some within the ASSU
were unsure about making the sen
ate's goals public. "But it became
clear," said Senate Deputy Chair
Matt Spence, a sophomore, "any
type of successful agenda needs to
be made public."
The ASSU'sNo. 1 project for the
year, on which the ASSU has al
ready made substantial progress, is
the creation of a course guide by
winter quarter that would contain
quantitative data from student eval
uations of professors and classes.
"The course guide has universal
support from students," said ASSU
Vice President Ben Decker, a se
nior. "I don't think that there is a sin
gle student that doesn't think it will
be useful."
Under the current Faculty Senate


Freund
bylaws each professor can choose
whether to release quantitative
data. A hill coming before the Fac
ulty Senate this Thursday would
give deans the power to release that
information.
"I'm confident that the Faculty
Senate will understand that the
ASSU will use this information for
the benefit of students in a responsi
ble way." Decker said. "Among uni
versities Stanford is an anomaly in
that it doesn't have a course guide."
Freund, who will attend the Fac
ulty Senate meeting along with
other ASSU representatives, ex
pects the senate will approve the
ASSU's request. "We don't want to
be argumentative," Freund said.
"But if need be. we are planning to
be very vocal."
Another issue the ASSU has al
ready made significant progress on
is expansion of ASSU Teaching
Awards. The expansion would
award teaching assistants as well as
professors and add an honorarium.
One of the issues on the list that
has already generated contentious
debate is special-fee reform. " The
biggest problem with the special-fee
system is that it's so opaque," said

Decker. "The system breaks down
because the majority of students
don't understand the complexity of
the system."
The ASSU is considering a pro
posal to assess the student body a
fixed fee, which the ASSU would
then distribute to student groups. In
so doing, the senate hopes to elimi
nate the alternating years of famine
and plenty that some student groups
have experienced in the past.
The ASSU compiled its list by
polling senators for the projects
they would most like the ASSU to
have completed by the end of the
year. "Some of these issues may
take more than one year to resolve,
but we plan to finish most of them
by the end of our term," Freund
added.
In formulating the list, the ASSU
has tried to balance goals that it can
complete quickly with goals that re
quire long-term effort.
"We tried to have a concrete,
tangible goal for every abstract,
nebulous goal," Freund said.
Other items on the list include
purchasing a golf cart capable of
transporting disabled students,
maintaining free e-mail for students,
developing a new Big Game Bonfire
tradition, creating a Student Politi
cal Union and improving lighting on
campus.
