## Clinton backs tax bill 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
provision in the legislation to over
haul the IKS could save taxpayers
more than $1 billion by placing new
limits on penalties for repayment of
back taxes.
It's among a host of taxpayer
rights initiatives, some benefiting
divorced spouses, the mentally
impaired and low-income workers,
that have gotten little notice in the
political maneuvering surrounding
agency restructuring.
"There are some immediate ben
efits from this legislation," says Rep.
Rob Portman, R-Ohio, an architect
of the legislation.
Most of the discussion and dis
pute on the bill has concerned such
broader issues as the proposed cre
ation of an 11-member oversight
board to draft the IRS' budget and
improve management of the agency.
Clinton's administration reversed
course last week and backed the bill
when sponsors agreed It) retain the
president's authority to hire and fire
the IRS commissioner.
The administration says il wants
further revisions to an item that
would shift the burden of proof from
taxpayers to the IRS when disputed
cases reach court. Treasury Depart

ment officials say the bill, as current
ly written,could strengthen the hand
of tax evasion artists, an assertion
disputed by the hill's sponsors.
The most significant piece of the
taxpayer-rights section involves a
change in installment agreements
for repayment of back taxes. It
could save taxpayers $1.03 billion
over five years, according to the
Joint Committee on Taxation.
Currently, taxpayers who fail to
pay their taxes are subject to a penal
ty of one-half percent per month of
the unpaid amount, up to a maxi
mum 25 percent penalty, plus inter
est. I 'he legislation would drop the
maximum penalty to 9.5 percent for
taxpayers who reach an installment
agreement to repay back taxes.
For example, a taxpayer who
owes $ 1 (X) and has failed to pay the
bill after two years would owe $125
plus interest under the current for
mula. This bill would reduce it to
$109.50 plus interest it the taxpayer
reached an installment agreement.
The bill's sponsor, I louse Wavs
and Means Committee Chairman
Bill Archer, R-Texas, said the pro
vision seeks to reverse a trend in the
l9<Sos in which several tax bills
boosted IRS penalties.
