### 
NEW YORK (AIM — The
Dow Jones industrial average mi!
fered ils worst single-day point
drop yesterday, tumbling 550
points and forcing the stock mar
ket to shut down for the first time
since the ! C >S I assassination
attempt on President Reagan.
I he market's best known
barometer fell 554.26 points to
7,1(11.15. surpassing the 508-point
Black Monday crash of 1987.
But on a percentage basis, yes
terday's 7.1S percent drop by the
Dow ranked as the 12th biggest
ever and didn't come close to the
22 percent loss on Oct. I 1 ). PJB7.
Although the Dow is still up 11
percent since the beginning of the
year, the sell-ofl put the Dow's
losses at about l '(H) points over the
past four sessions and 1,1(H) points
since it set a record high at
8.259.31 on Aug. 6.
"It's ;i bloodbath," s;iid Arnold
Kaufman, a market analyst at
Standard & Poor's. "It scares you
because when you get a decline
this fast, there's a risk it will keep
snowballing."
I lie Dow's drop triggered two
circuit breakers on the New York
Stock Exchange that had never
been set off. I he first circuit break
er, at 350 points, closed the market
for 30 minutes. I lie second, at 550,
halted trading for the day.
It remains to be seen how much
of yesterday's selling was fueled by
mutual fund investors.
"I wish I had more money to
invest." said I lelcn (iinty, 60, a sec
retary in New York, asserting that
she plans no change in her retire
ment investment strategy. "I don't

think people are as crazy as the\
used to be" duiing a downturn.
For many analysts, the drop
was notable because the Dow has
now fallen 13.3 percent from its
Aug. 6 record high of 8,25^.31, its
first downturn ol at least 10 per
cent in seven years, the longest
such streak since the l%os.
Declining issues also outnum
bered advancers b\ an astounding
16 to I margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume
came to 685.50 million shares, the
busiest day in its histon.
Stocks started the das lower as
another sharp sell-off in I long
Kong triggered another wave ol
selling in financial narkets around
the globe, but the selling didn't
pick up steam in the I Inited States
until yesterday afternoon. I lie
Dow. for example, was do i just
1 15 points at midday.
The mounting financial i is in
Hong Kong has ignited feats
about whether global business
conditions will be undermined In
Southeast Asia's shaky economics,
where mounting trade deficits
have sent interest rates soaiing
and local currencies plunging.
I long Kong's I lang Seng index
fell 7 percent, as foreign markets
also fell yesterday.
Kaufman, however,
asserted that a stream ol weak
earnings reports or a jump in intci
est rates could have set of! a sleep
decline just ;is easily as I long
Kong's problems.
"The Southeast Asia crisis is
just a trigger," he s;iid. "Something
would have come along at some
point. I Ins is what came along."
