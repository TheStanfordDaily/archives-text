Recent ban on halogen
lamps is a matter of
ensuring student safety

THE FIRE THAT broke out in
I'crra house last week has remind
ed many students of the reality that
fires do happen. Hut whether such inci
dents prompt students to follow safety pre
cautions more carefully is another matter.
In recent years, many students, discon
tent with the poor lighting in their dorm
rooms, have resorted to using halogen
torchiere lamps.
This is because these rooms provide
only ambient lighting, which is not suffi
cient for studying. And in many dormito
i ics. especially the older ones that have vet
to be renovated, the ambient lighting is
pretty minimal.
(liven this situation, the low cost and
exceptional brightness of halogen lamps
have made them an attractive remedy for
many students.
Hut despite their cost-efficiency and
good lighting, there has been rising
concern over their safety and energy
efficiency.
Generating intense heat in addition to
light, these 3(H) to S(H) watt lamps (with
surface temperatures between SOO-1200
degrees Fahrenheit) have touched off
numerous fires across the country.
lhe heat emitted from the lamps well
exceeds the combustion temperatures of
both paper and cloth. I lowcver. not only
paper and cloth but also the accumulation
of combustibles — such as dead insects in
the bowl of the torchiere — can cause tires.
The Consumer Product Safety Com
mission has recorded more than 100 I ires
started by halogen lamps, and two fires
have already been caused by halogen
lamps in Stanford housing. Many universi
ties have banned halogen torchieres alter
incidence of fire.
In addition to these salety hazards,
halogen lamps also consume large
amounts of energy, much of which is inel
ficientlv converted into heat rather than
light.
These safety hazards and inefficiencies
prompted the University to ban the use of

halogen lamps on campus. Last spring the
University warned all students about the
potential dangers of halogen lamps, and
required that students assigned to I Jniver
sitv housing sign an agreement not to have
a lighting source exceeding 150 watts in
their rooms.
I lousing and Dining Services also creat
ed a swap program last spring to begin dis
tribution of a new light called the compact
fluorescent torchiere. This light uses 07
watts of energy to produce light that is 20
percent brighter than that of a halogen
lamp. These "smart lamps" have received
nation-wide attention for their efficient
use of energy.
Students in Mirrielees and Lamda Nu
houses — which were found to have the
highest percentage of halogen lamps per
student — were able to exchange their
halogen torchieres for one of the lirst 150
new "smart lamps" arriving on campus.
We realize that many students were not
able to exchange their lamps during this
period, and we know that many people still
have halogen lamps in their rooms.
The "smart lamps," which cost about
$100. may not be as cost-efficient as halo
gen lamps. Hut their efficient use of ener
gy and light bulbs may in the long run be a
smarter investment than the energy-waste
ful and potentially dangerous halogen
lamps.
Many students don't have the extra
money to spend on these lamps, so lor
those who cannot pay for the new technol
ogy or choose not to. a number of other
alternative lighting sources exist, ranging
from $30 to $50.
While the University should be provid
ing better lighting in student rooms, stu
dents, in the interim, must take the initia
tive to be sure that their lamps comply
with the University requirement that no
lighting source exceed 150 watts.
Students should also be careful with the
use of electrical equipment in general.
Those who are caught still using halo
gen lamps will be fined, but the fines
should not be the only reason to pack them
up.
The fire hazard of halogen lamps is real;
it's a threat to you and your dormmates.
If a halogen lamp can cause a fire at
England's Windsor Castle, there's no
knowing when it might be the cause ot a
fire in vour own room.
