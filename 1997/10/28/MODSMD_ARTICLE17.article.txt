## Confronting the grind and the demons 
### 
TWO AND A quar
ter miles down.
Roughly one to go.
Around this point in a
high school cross-country
race. I would begin to real
ly feel the pain that every
long-distanee runner
experiences at some point.

There's the shortness (and sometimes
absence) of breath, as well as the occasional
cramps and the always-pleasant sensation
of muscle tissue feeling like Jell-O. Hut
there are also those "demons,'" as one of my
coaches would say. The ones that attack not
the body, but the will. And they offer the
masochistic runner the real battle â€” one of
fighting the temptation to wave the white
Hag and allow the run to become a trot or
even a walk.
Although a runner's high can probably
be explained chemically, there's something
else to it. And at the heart of that something
else rests the idea of fighting off those
demons. The chemical juices of a runner's
high just wouldn't be the same il struggle
had not been involved. The juices are not
the will's victory, and neither is anything
else.
Self-torturing tendencies similar to those
of a cross-country runner exist everywhere.
We all. at some point, face something like
the seemingly ridiculous task of sprinting a
loop of five or 10 kilometers. That is, as with
running in a circle, we will sometimes just

seem to finish where we started. Hut anyone
who makes the run and fights those demons
knows that the start and finish are two utter
ly different places.
I usually don't think about these battles
as being demonic, but the idea does offer a
nice metaphor in separating the moments
that seem to almost happen effortlessly and
those that really feel like a clash with a
demonically arduous task.
Downing five hamburgers in seven min
utes isn't the kind of challenge that I'm talk
ing about; hamburgers are relatively
demon-free. Hut when we look toward the
oftentimes sheltered environment of the
classroom, we see some true battles ol will.
Think of a mammoth paper that might
have left you not only feeling like you had
been hit by an 18-wheelcr but also feeling a
sense of fulfillment because you didn't step
away from (ioliath.
And of course, there are even more
imposing and elusive demons beyond
academia. Given that something can be a
struggle for one and a breeze tor another,
no formula exists for determining when
those big, bad demons are present.
Although the subject knows when it's a
helluva struggle and when it isn't, others
often don't. As a consequence, the funny
thing is that we often receive more credit
when it's a bree/e as opposed to when a
task presents grinding challenges.
Hut the possible lack of externally grant
ed credit, shouldn't strip away the funda

mental quality of a true battle of will that is
irreplaceable.
At the same time, 1 wouldn t suggest that
I'd like to be like Sisyphus and push a rock
up a hill all day, only to see it roll back down
when reaching the peak. Maybe a revised
way to look at the myth would be that Sisy
phus enjoys his time at the hilltop, but he
realizes that it is somewhat momentary.
And that the struggle will never disappear
forever.
But why would we want it to? C ould we
really live a life of pure pleasure without
deluding ourselves that we're happy ' Hap
piness seems to sometimes connote pure
pleasure. But don't we experience a feeling
of more intense happiness when it follows
kicking a demon in the butt?
Maybe a social psychologist would argue
that this notion of happiness is just a prod
uct of something like our so-called Protes
tant work ethic. And certainly we are influ
enced by our cultural standards.
But a "battle of the will" is not an idea
that is solely a product of recent centuries.
The sense of something like "happiness"
from butting heads with a demon is some
thing that seems basic to humanity.
So enjoy the moments on the hilltop, but
let's also be ready and willing to meet those
demons at hill's bottom.

Jon Servaites, a senior majoring in chemical
engineering, would like to take this time to
exorcise the demons from this essay.
