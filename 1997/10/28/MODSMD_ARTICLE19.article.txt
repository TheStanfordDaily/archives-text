The right to choose death
In Nakia Johnson's "Freedom lias
boundaries" letter, she comments on a
"slip-of-tongue" in Kerry Rodgers' "Dying
with Dignity" — namely, the brief men
tioning of the "unborn fetus."
From that arose an argument against
abortion. In the common sense view of
Johnson that people are free to choose
their destiny "as long as it does not infringe
011 or inhibit the abilities of others to
express that same freedom." I agree that
abortion is infringing on the right of the
unborn to live.
However. I have to disagree with John
son's implication that the act of suicide
should not be a right.
Why is it that living is a right and dying
is not? Is it based on the unfounded and
questionable ancient reasoning that "life is
good and therefore death must be bad?" II
we follow Johnson's definition of freedom,
suicide would be a freedom because it
doesn't involve infringing upon others'
rights. Surely, the pained and suicidal
might hurt the feelings of loved ones; but il
they don't love life anymore, why insist
that they keep tin living?
If they believe deep down that death
will be better than life, why don't we allow
them to test that theory out? If we can't
tell what exists after death, who are we to
say death is bad? If democracy is an ideal
in which even the tiniest minority can say
something, might we portray our using the

power of the life-loving majority to sup
press the actions of an undecided minority
as contradicting such idealism.
If we can't even make the choice on this
most important decision, namely, living
and dying, what are our rights? Can we still
say they exist?

Last week's column by Darron Evans
titled "Why not... design your own reli
gion'.'" caught my eye.
While I appreciated his willingness to
share his ideas and beliefs. 1 found his argu
ment one that has been frequently men
tioned in intellectual discussions of religion.
That view is that organized religion is
primarily or at least frequently backward
and dangerous, with a greater potential for
bad than for good, for stilling creative indi
viduality and personal freedom.
As a practicing Mormon. I want to pre
sent an alternative view, in order to fill in a
gap I feel exists in the discussion.
In contrast to glorifying an atomized
personal religion. I speak for organized
religion. While I feel that a certain amount
of spirituality consists of personalized
wrestling and communing with God. I
don't believe that is the extent of it.
1 have chosen to associate with an orga
nized religious group for several reasons.
The most important reason is. simply, that

I believe in its teachings. Among the teach
ings of my religion is the conviction that to
have a vital religious life one must be "will
ing to bear one another's burdens, that
they may be light; yea, and... to mourn
with those that mourn; yea, and comfort
those that stand in need of comfort...
(Book of Mormon, 1S1)
Secondly. I admire the organization's
efforts to do good and to buoy the lives
and hopes of others. I want to take an
active part in these efforts and feel I can
accomplish them more effectively by work
ing with others.
I also hope to personally benefit from
the associations — and not only the pleas
ant ones. I don't want merely a "comfort
able link between myself and God." I want
a context for challenge and growth that
prevents me from becoming complacent
and that forces me to adapt and change.
In my ease growth comes not solely
through introspection, or through late
night discussions with God. but also when 1
am thrust into human relationships: forced
to deal with and delight in. to learn from
and struggle with, to serve and be served
by others. Sharing a unity of purpose and
belief with members of a religious group
keeps me committed to it and to the
growth, pain and joy it provides
M\ religion is not always comfortable,
but it does help me grow. It would not if 1
were its only subscriber.
