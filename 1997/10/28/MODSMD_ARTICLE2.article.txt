# Skateboarders on campus face fines
## 
### Angel Flores Contributing writer 
Around the post office and near
Meyer and Green libraries, skate
boarders and in-line skaters jump
up stairs, cruise along benches and
slide down rails.
But, unlike the skateboarders, no
one on Rollerblades is risking a fine
or confiscation of their skates by the
police as a consequence.
A Santa Clara County ordinance
passed in April. 1992 prohibits
skateboarding within designated
areas of the University, specifically
the Campus Drive loop, extending
to El Camino Real.
Even though skaters are often
guilty of the same type of "tricking"
that skateboarders do — such as
jumping off ramps — it's not against
the law to in-line skate anywhere on
campus.
" This law is a prejudice against
those who law enforcers think are
delinquents," said skateboarder
Brad Hoppe, a senior. "It seems like
they're trying to keep a certain type
of person off campus."
"Rollerbladers fall through the
cracks," said Stanford Police
Deputy Kathleen Swineford. " They
can only get cited for vandalizing"
due to tricking.
When a person is caught skate
boarding, the police seize the skate
board as evidence until the violator

appears in court. The fines lor vio
lating this law can reach up to $I(K).
"We used to give a warning be
fore we'd enforce the law." Swine
ford said. "Now we just enforce it."
The law was imposed primarily
because of damage and noise caused
by the skateboarders who do trick
ing, specifically around the Quad,
Mudd Chemistry Building and
Green and Meyer libraries, accord
ing to Swineford.
"Still, you could get cited just
going to class, even if you're
not tricking," Swineford said.
Although the police, at times,
will use discretion in handing out ci
tations to skateboarders, they do re
spond to every complaint they re
ceive regarding noise or vandalism,
she said.
The skateboarding problem is
worst near the libraries "because it's
already a very high traffic area."
said Joan Krasner, head of access
services for the University libraries.
Krasner said the libraries' three
major concerns are the increase in
traffic the skateboarders cause,
their use of the handicap ramps and
the noise it causes which disturbs the
users in the Jonsson I ,ibrary of Gov
ernment Documents.
