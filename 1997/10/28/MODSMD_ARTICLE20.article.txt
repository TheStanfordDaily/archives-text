# Foreign Bureau: Moscow
## Re-living the challenges of adolescence 
### 
Kelly Young

IC'AME TO Moscow prepared to do
some growing up. Hut. I never expected
that I'd have to experience the awk
wardness of adolescence all ovei again.
When I first walked into my host family's
apartment, I was greeted by "beautiful
women" on display everywhere.
As my family and I sat down in the
kitchen to begin our introductions. 1 noticed
the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar
hanging on the wall with a U.S. Hag pinned
next to the buxom Miss September.
Okay, if it doesn't bother my host moth
er, it doesn't bother me. 1 tried to convince
myself.
I walked into my bedroom ready to begin
unpacking only to find a poster of this vers
American-looking bron/e woman lying on
the beach and sprinkled with sand. She |uM
happened to be lacking a bathing suit, anil
she happened to be hanging at the foot ol
my bed.
My host sister. Natasha, caught me cring
ing at the postei as I attempted to unpack
and candidly asked me, "You don't think
she is pretty, do you'.' You can take her
down if you like."
It's not that bronze beach chic wasn't
pretty. It's just that she made me so increil

ibly uncomfortable. This was my loom, my
three month haven from lien/ied city life.
As 1 continued to explori the small
apartment. I found similai pieces ol work in
the bathroom, in the enhvwas and in my
host parents' bedroom
Il was only mv lust week. I didn't want to
offend my hosts s<> soon altei n>\ arrival, so
1 didn't mention my uneasiness
Unfamiliar in the ways (>l Muscovite eti
quette. 1 left the bron/e beach chic up.
thinking il might please my lamily that I
appreciated their taste in... urn... art.
Hut 1 didn't appreciate it.and I don't
think 1 ever could. It makes me self-con
scious about my own appearance.
I. too, have an artistic body. in that unap
preciated. slightly rotund. Renaissance sort
of way. (I think meat friendly Moscow has
taken its toll on my hips.) I've nevet been
overly concerned with my appearance.
I'm normally a wash-and-go kind of girl.
In high school. 1 had an excuse to look run
down. 1 was a jock. At Stanford, that excuse
didn't work. I was simply au natui ale. take it
or leave it.
I guess in this way. I have hail trouble
connecting with Russian women. I he young
Russian women whom I have met are very

concerned with
their appear
anecs Perhaps it
is just another
wonile r 1 u I
Ainer i c a n
import.
I have vet to
come across a
woman my age
whose lips were
not coated in
some shade ol
Mary Kave and
whose hair color
could not be
found in the
Nice N' 1 asy aisle.

Mv host mother is always wonicd about
looking fat and lias even insisted on down
ing Slim l ast instead ol eating a normal
Russian dinner.
Natasha, like her mother, happens to be
on a crusade to lose weight. She also plays
with her Harbie dolls nligiously. Strange
coincidence? I think not.
Despite the similarities. I don't think this
whole image consciousness comes strictly
from America. I here is an old saying in

Russia, "A woman w ho laughs out loud has
a mouth like a horse." ()ka\. so now I'm
feeling like a fat adolescent li ll\.
Oh. but there's more. I here are mirrors
in the entrance ol the Finance Academy
where the Stanford center is located \\ hen
ever I whi/ past, there is always a Russian
git I carefully preening herself. (it anted. this
is not uniquely Russian I could see the
same thing anywhere in Anieiica 01
Europe.
Hut I'm not seeing it there. I his whole
issue is strangeh Russian.
I see two worlds collide when young,
borderline anoiexie women ride the same
Metro as hclty kihushkas with tlieii scarves
around their heads. It's a stark contrast, to
sav the least.
In addition, pornography is rampant
here. It's not uist in my apartment. I vei\
day as I exit in\ Metro station, I'm con
I routed b\ old babushkas selling this trash
right alongside the inoie respectable news
papers.
I lie olilei Russians blame this on \inei
ica and the e\ils ol capitalism. Sine we have
pornogiapliN in America, but old grand
mothers inn t selling it on every street coi

kitchen to begin our introductions. 1 noticed
the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar
hanging on the wall with a U.S. Hag pinned
next to the buxom Miss September.
Okay, if it doesn't bother my host moth
er, it doesn't bother me. 1 tried to convince
myself.
I walked into my bedroom ready to begin
unpacking only to find a poster of this vers
American-looking bron/e woman lying on
the beach and sprinkled with sand. She |uM
happened to be lacking a bathing suit, anil
she happened to be hanging at the foot ol
my bed.
My host sister. Natasha, caught me cring
ing at the postei as I attempted to unpack
and candidly asked me, "You don't think
she is pretty, do you'.' You can take her
down if you like."
It's not that bronze beach chic wasn't
pretty. It's just that she made me so increil

ibly uncomfortable. This was my loom, my
three month haven from lien/ied city life.
As 1 continued to explori the small
apartment. I found similai pieces ol work in
the bathroom, in the enhvwas and in my
host parents' bedroom
Il was only mv lust week. I didn't want to
offend my hosts s<> soon altei n>\ arrival, so
1 didn't mention my uneasiness
Unfamiliar in the ways (>l Muscovite eti
quette. 1 left the bron/e beach chic up.
thinking il might please my lamily that I
appreciated their taste in... urn... art.
Hut 1 didn't appreciate it.and I don't
think 1 ever could. It makes me self-con
scious about my own appearance.
I. too, have an artistic body. in that unap
preciated. slightly rotund. Renaissance sort
of way. (I think meat friendly Moscow has
taken its toll on my hips.) I've nevet been
overly concerned with my appearance.
I'm normally a wash-and-go kind of girl.
In high school. 1 had an excuse to look run
down. 1 was a jock. At Stanford, that excuse
didn't work. I was simply au natui ale. take it
or leave it.
I guess in this way. I have hail trouble
connecting with Russian women. I he young
Russian women whom I have met are very

concerned with
their appear
anecs Perhaps it
is just another
wonile r 1 u I
Ainer i c a n
import.
I have vet to
come across a
woman my age
whose lips were
not coated in
some shade ol
Mary Kave and
whose hair color
could not be
found in the
Nice N' 1 asy aisle.

Mv host mother is always wonicd about
looking fat and lias even insisted on down
ing Slim l ast instead ol eating a normal
Russian dinner.
Natasha, like her mother, happens to be
on a crusade to lose weight. She also plays
with her Harbie dolls nligiously. Strange
coincidence? I think not.
Despite the similarities. I don't think this
whole image consciousness comes strictly
from America. I here is an old saying in

Russia, "A woman w ho laughs out loud has
a mouth like a horse." ()ka\. so now I'm
feeling like a fat adolescent li ll\.
Oh. but there's more. I here are mirrors
in the entrance ol the Finance Academy
where the Stanford center is located \\ hen
ever I whi/ past, there is always a Russian
git I carefully preening herself. (it anted. this
is not uniquely Russian I could see the
same thing anywhere in Anieiica 01
Europe.
Hut I'm not seeing it there. I his whole
issue is strangeh Russian.
I see two worlds collide when young,
borderline anoiexie women ride the same
Metro as hclty kihushkas with tlieii scarves
around their heads. It's a stark contrast, to
sav the least.
In addition, pornography is rampant
here. It's not uist in my apartment. I vei\
day as I exit in\ Metro station, I'm con
I routed b\ old babushkas selling this trash
right alongside the inoie respectable news
papers.
I lie olilei Russians blame this on \inei
ica and the e\ils ol capitalism. Sine we have
pornogiapliN in America, but old grand
mothers inn t selling it on every street coi
ner.

Helore I arrived here in Soptembei.
