## Bowl or bust for Cardinal 
### 
For Stanford football fans. Oct. 4 is looking
more like a pleasant dream every day. I he
C aidinal s 33-15 win over Not re Dame was a
tnily delightful football game, complete with a
dominating performance on the field and a near-ca
pacity crowd in the stands.
Ihe details are already getting fu//\. Ihe game
seems buried in the past, clouded In a nostalgic
haze. Every day. I forget a little more.
1 he last three weeks have been a loolhall night
mare. and they are slowl\ hut sureh pet mealing ni\
mind.

I wo embarrassing losses lo schools from the
Grand ( anyon Slate knocked Stanford out ol the
Rose Bowl race and into a fight for any postseason
berth at all. After being trounced In Arizona State
Oct. 18, Stanford limped into its bye week like a
wounded deer seeking sheltei from a killing blow.
The week off couldn't have come al a bettei
time. I iist. it gave the ( animal seven extra da\s to
heal and prepare for the I'CI A Bi nins. who come
to Stanford on Saturday seeking their seventh
straight win. Second, il gets Stanford into the magi

II Stanford head coach 4 \ rone Willingham is
renowned for one thing, it's his ability to finish
strong. In his two years on the I ai in. W illingham is
6-1 in November, including last yeai s4 (> finish that
carried the once 2-5 ( aidinal into the Sim Bowl.
This year. Willingham finds himself in the same
situation, with the same Novembei schedule, own
ing a slightly belter record (4-3, 2-2 Pacific 10 ( on

a repeat peifonnance ol the IIW6l l W6 stretch drive
would be no less miiaculoiis

strangers to the big play.
I hink about this team for a while,
and you will remember what it is ca
pable of. You will picture Bookman
breaking through the line for a long
score, or Hutchinson coolly finding
open receivers with every throw.
You will remember just how good
the Cardinal looked beating the
Irish so long — three weeks? — ago.
Hopefully, Stanford has used its
week off to reflect on the type of
team it can be. And to reflect on the
mistakes (turnovers, poor blocking,
weak play in the secondary, etc.) it
made against the Arizona schools
that kept the Cardinal from being
that team.

Last year, Stanford's season
turned on an upset win at UCLA.
History needs to repeat itself this
week it Stanford is to retain any
hopes of salvaging its season.
A 4-0 or 3-1 finish would proba
bly send the Cardinal back to the
Sun Bowl or, at worst, to the Aloha
Bowl. If Stanford goes 2-2, we're
talking Humanitarian Bowl, at best.
New Year's Eve in El Paso.
Christmas in Hawaii. Some dreary
December afternoon in Boise,
Idaho, in a stadium with bright blue
artificial turf. You figure it out.
A win over the Bruins would be a
springboard for the brutal two-week
road trip that takes the Cardinal to
smoggy Southern California and
blustery Pullman, Wash. A loss
could mean some very, very long
plane rides.

It's time for the Cardinal to take a
gut check and figure out what kind of
team it is. Is this the never-say-die
Stanford group that rallied time and
time again last year and ended the
season playing its best football? ()r is
it the squad that, with all hopes of a
Pasadena New Year's on the line, got
thumped at home two weeks ago?
In football, fans are quick to for
get. They're also quick to forgive. A
month after the fact, as Oct. 4 fades
into the record books, it's time for
Stanford to give its fans something
new to cheer about.

Sophomore sports editor Jim
lankersley loves Stan ford football,
but for reasons of personal sanity
would refuse to accompany the team
to Boise, Idaho — Humanitarian
Howl or not.
