## Bowl or bust for Cardinal 
### 
For Stanford football fans. Oct. 4 is looking
more like a pleasant dream every day. I he
C aidinal s 33-15 win over Not re Dame was a
tnily delightful football game, complete with a
dominating performance on the field and a near-ca
pacity crowd in the stands.
Ihe details are already getting fu//\. Ihe game
seems buried in the past, clouded In a nostalgic
haze. Every day. I forget a little more.
1 he last three weeks have been a loolhall night
mare. and they are slowl\ hut sureh pet mealing ni\
mind.

I wo embarrassing losses lo schools from the
Grand ( anyon Slate knocked Stanford out ol the
Rose Bowl race and into a fight for any postseason
berth at all. After being trounced In Arizona State
Oct. 18, Stanford limped into its bye week like a
wounded deer seeking sheltei from a killing blow.
The week off couldn't have come al a bettei
time. I iist. it gave the ( animal seven extra da\s to
heal and prepare for the I'CI A Bi nins. who come
to Stanford on Saturday seeking their seventh
straight win. Second, il gets Stanford into the magi
cal month of Novembei
II Stanford head coach 4 \ rone Willingham is
renowned for one thing, it's his ability to finish
strong. In his two years on the I ai in. W illingham is
6-1 in November, including last yeai s4 (> finish that
carried the once 2-5 ( aidinal into the Sim Bowl.
This year. Willingham finds himself in the same
situation, with the same Novembei schedule, own
ing a slightly belter record (4-3, 2-2 Pacific 10 ( on
fere nee) and a slightly more experienced team But
a repeat peifonnance ol the IIW6l l W6 stretch drive
would be no less miiaculoiis
None ol Stanford's last loui games will be easv
Ihe Biuins aie tanked I in the eounliv Wash
ington State is loth I Inow in IJS(' at the I os An
geles ( oliseum where I lorida Slate onlv won In
a touchdown and the I OOtli Big( ianie. and a linal
record ol 4 7 or 5-6 suddcnl\ looks veiv possible.
This for a team that st a i ted J I and ga\e the sixth
ranked team in the counlty a run Ibi iis niontn.
But Willingham wins in Novembei because lie
knows how to motivate when the clock is miming
out. He has a team of savvy veteran skill players
who know how lo win in clutch situations, ( had
Hutchinson has quarterbackcd his share ol game
winning drives. I roy Walters, Damon Dunn. An
thony Bookman and Mike Mitchell are no
