It's difficult to believe that water polo stand

along v\ ith junior holcman I)avid I lay. serious

his sophomore year.
It becomes even more difficult to believe
aftei reviewing his list of past athletic accolades:

the IWS I Inited States Junior National l earn.

Beaubien had lost interest in water polo by the
conclusion of the IWS season.
I he sport that he had originally joined for
lint had become life-consuming. Despite am
team victories. Beaubien personally felt lost.
"It was taking its toll on him physically and
psychologically," said younger brother Brady
Beaubien. a freshman.
Things became even worse when the elder
Beaubien began skipping team practices and
losing interest in his classes.
"I le was kind of a lost soul." said Stanford
head coach Dante Dettamanti.
Aftei much consideration. Beaubien came

up with a solution, which he proposed to his
coach: take two quarters off and travel.
"I had this big talk with 1 )antc and I took off
and I went to Europe." Beaubien said. "The
deal with Dante was that I'd be back in the
spring."
When Beaubien returned, his athletic schol
arship would be waiting and his spring training
would begin.
"I felt really bad leasing, but I just had to."
Beaubien said. "It was just timing. I really need
ed to leave... A lot of people knew why I need
ed to leave ... M\ friends knew, and they felt
like it was a good thing."
Tor the next nine months. Beaubien trav
eled the globe alone, beginning with a two
month train trek through Western Europe.
His journey resembled the travels of Jack
Kerouae. the author he read along the way.
"1 went all around Western Europe. I ended
in Budapest, and then I hitchhiked through Ro
mania, Bulgaria ... and then I hitchhiked
through l urkey for three weeks and took buses
and stuff."

Layne Beaubien is back in top form after taking two quarters off last
year to go globetrotting in Europe ancf Central Amet ica
ter by traveling through Costa Rica
and Honduras.
I rue to his word, Beaubien re
turned for spring training in 19%.
And despite initial doubts about his
athletic capability, he has emerged
stronger than ever.
"I came back quicker than I
thought," Beaubien said. "After a
month or so I was all right."
Any further doubts about his ath
letic capability were permanently set
tled during the Northern California
Tournament at Stanford Oct. 18-19.
Beaubien racked up 11 goals in
five games, including a crucial two
point shot in the final seconds of a
dramatic comeback against No. 5
UC-Irvine and the game winner in
sudden-death overtime of that same
match.
For his efforts, Beaubien was

named the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Player of the Week.
"I really feel that Layne can be a
driving force in collegiate water
polo." Dettamanti said." If he puts his
mind to it.he could be on a national
team ... He definitely has come back
with a renewed vigor. He really is just
now starting to be the player we real
ly want him to be."
Beaubien agrees that his attitude
toward both life and water polo has
altered, and he speaks enthusiastical
ly about the squad's close chemistry.
"1 think a lot of people feel like
there's a new energy now. this spring
board tor the rest of the season." he
said.
As tor his own future, Beaubien
remains undecided.
"I'm sure I'll figure it out when it
comes ... maybe keep playing water
p010.... I'm taking it slow."
If history repeats itself, Beaubien
will come up with the perfect solu
tion.
