"We know this course very well,"
Renfrosaid. " There's one transition
on our course — you go up the lull

The men w ill also do their best to
hold off tough team competition.
Oregon, which enters the race
ranked fifth in the nation, lias quite
a winning tradition in the Pac 10:
'The Ducks have captured 13 ol 2N
Pac-10 titles, including five ol the
last nine.
Washington State enters the race
ranked 10th, while Arizona, Wash

ington and I K 'I A are ranked 14th,
I Sih and 22nd, respectively. All lour
could act as spoilers in the ('animal
quest to repeat as Pac-10 champi

The men's individual race should
be a barn burner. UCI A senior
Mebrahtom keflezighi, whose ex
perience on the course dates back to
his high school years, will be the
man to beat.
"Mebrahtom knows the course
very well," said senior Nathan Nui
ter. "I le's definitely beatable."
keflezighi hasn't been beaten in
his lasi three races on the Stanford
(i oll Course including last
month's Stanford Invitational
and holds the current <S,(MH> meter
course record with a time ol 23:45.
Washington Slate's Bernard
I.agat will figure heavily in the indi

vidual contest as well. The sopho
more has the 10th fastest course

pionships.
Junior twins Brad and Brent
11 a use i will do their best to stop ke-
Ile/ighi and Tagat from running
away with the individual title. Nut
ter will also be a part of the front
pack.
This year's conference champi
onships will be the last on the Stan
ford campus until 2006. Stanford
has hosted the men's event since
N73 and the women's since l l )X(>.
