# Stanford crew gears up for fall season
## 
### Bobby Blunt 
The fall training season started off well for
Stanford crew over the weekend.
Saturday, the teams traveled to Sacramento to
participate in a regatta sponsored by the Sacra
mento Aquatic Center, the Cardinal's first oppor
tunity to compete this year and a good chance to
evaluate early training.
Stanford's men's and women's teams compet
ed in the open bracket, which included several
club teams as well as collegiate boats. About 20
boats participated in each category, including
DC-Davis. California and Long Beach State.
The men's two varsity boats finished in first
and third place in their race, missing the second
place spot by 10 seconds.
The Stanford women also had a good day, plac
ing second (four seconds behind the Stanford
Club), third and fifth. Both teams' success was
also accented by a strong performance by Stan
ford's novice boats.
The competitive season does not start until
spring for crew, but these early regattas function

as a long training period. Fall events serve as an in
dicator of how well training is progressing and
give the team a chance to work together before ac
tual competition.
Early regattas also give coaches the opportuni
ty to test out new and different combinations ol
rowers in an attempt to determine the strongest
and fastest squads.
Men's head coach Wieslaw kujda was pleased
with Saturday's results and is optimistic about the
Cardinal's potential, lie stressed the importance
of working together as a team, especially during
the training portion of the year.
Kujda also said the men's winning boat wasn't
even the fastest Stanford could have fielded, but
that at this point, it's more important to develop
together.
Developing together seems to be exactly what
the crew teams are doing. I'he intensity of training
and work ethic are higher than in years past, and
team members are much more involved in deter
mining what types of workouts are needed to pre
pare for the spring season.
"We don"! have the international athletes,"

Kujda said, "but we have something better
competitiveness and we could come up with
some good surprises."
Saturday s men's races were conducted in a
time-trial fashion, with each boat starting at a 10-
second interval behind the preceding boat. Stan
ford's second eight man boat advanced close to
the boat in front of it. slowing it down. I he wake
of another boat handicaps a trailing boat by dis
rupting the smooth motion through the water.
In the women s races, the varsity group ran in
two-person boats without the aid i>t a coxswain.
I his was done to cinphasi/e the technique of the
rowers, a locus during fall training.
All ol the races were head races, conducted
over a distance of S.(XX) meters. I lead races, u Inch
do not take place in the spring, require a slower
stroke rate and involve much longer race limes,
l he long distance allows for training, but in the
competitive season the distance is shortened to
2.(M H) meters.
Stanford travels to the I lead ol the I ake com
petition Nov. 9 in Seattle and also hosts the Stan
ford Fall Kcuatta head race Now 23.
