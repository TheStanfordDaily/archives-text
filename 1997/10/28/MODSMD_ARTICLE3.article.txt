# New rules may affect Flicks
## Food concerns prompt proposal for non-student ushers 
### Kumar Narayanan Contributing writer 
Student organizers of Sunday Micks are con
cerned that possible new University regulations
may have a detrimental effect on the atmosphere
and viability of the popular weekend tradition.
Flicks may be required to hire I University per
sonnel as ushers if a proposal by Stanford Events
is adopted, according to its organizers.
Stanford Events, the entity that oversees
Memorial Auditorium, is considering increasing

regulation ovei Flicks operations in light of the re
cent $5 million remodeling of the auditorium.
" The problem is food and drinks," according to
junior .Ihin Man. the manager ol Micks, which is
run through Stanford Student Enterprises. Stan
ford Events is more stringently enforcing regula
tions preventing food and drink in the auditorium
because of the remodeling. I lan said.
But, he added, due to the sheer magnitude of
attendance, the regulations are immensely hard to
enforce.
The Axe Committee traditionally ushers

I licks, but ils members would be replaced bv non
student I Jniversity employees if Stanford l-vcnts
Director I ois Wagner I'ollows through with her
proposal.
" I hat is absolutely absurd," remarked Axe
Comm Chair Matt Uramlage, a junior. Wagner
could not be reached for comment.
Han concurred with Bramlage. "It is unrea
sonable to believe that Stanford students are not
capable ol ushering at Stanford events, such as
Sunday Flicks," he said. "There is
not a need for University staff to
oversee Sunday Flicks at Memorial
Auditorium."
The Axe Comm has done a
"marvelous job," according to Han.
Hramlagc added, "We have had
no incidents this year."
The Axe Comm staffs the doors,
ticket booth and stairways. Its mem
bers have removed unruly Stanford
students in the past and have tried to
keep food out of the auditorium,
Hramlage said.
I lan said the Axe ( omm also has
complied with Wagner's request
that flashlights be used in ushering.
The introduction of University
personnel would be financially un
profitable for Flicks, according to
former Flicks manager Matt Gar
linuhouse, a senior.

Han said the group could absorb
the cost, but the change would be
detrimental. "If necessary, we're
willing to manage that expense," he
said, "but this is a student enterprise.
We'd like to keep it that way."
Wagner also has expressed con
cern about students standing on
chairs, Han said. "It is hard to see
the people standing on the seats dur
ing the paper fight," he observed.
The paper fight, while undoubt
edly messy, is not an issue for Stan
ford Events, which manages Lively
Arts events in the auditorium. Flicks
has hired janitors to clean up after
the massive paper war.
In addition to hiring non-student
ushers, Wagner has proposed such
measures as ushers checking for
food during the movie and checking
bags at the door.
"We don't want to make Flicks
like Green Library," Han comment
ed.
Added pressure because of the

remodeling is unjust from Gaming
house's perspective.
Flicks, too, has contributed to the
upkeep of the auditorium. "We
bought a $ 1 (X).(KX) top-quality sound
system for Mem Aud," he said. Al
though Flicks bought the system,
the group still has to pay rent on the
system to Event Services, a different
office than Stanford Events.
Bramlage sees the move as just
another step in "a continuing cam
paign to take fun out of the Farm."
"Although [giving that impres
sion] is unintentional, it might ap
pear that way," Han said.
Flicks, which is celebrating its
60th anniversary, qualifies as one of
Stanford's oldest traditions. Every
10 p.m. showing has sold out this
year, according to Han.
Restrictions such as those pro
posed, he predicted, would destroy
the atmosphere at Flicks.
"The spirit of Flicks is to have fun
and forget about Stanford," he said.
