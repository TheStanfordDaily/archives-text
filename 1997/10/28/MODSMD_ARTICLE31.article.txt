# Students heed call to 'Save the Dream'
## 
### Leslie Gordon Contributing writer 
A Stanford contingent heeded Jesse Jackson's
call to "Save the Dream" by heading to a march
and rally in Sacramento at the crack of dawn yes
terday.
The march was intended to protest California's
Proposition 209, the anti-affirmative action mea
sure that passed last November, and a statewide
English-only initiative that would dismantle bilin
gual programs if it passes in June next year.
Jackson's "Save the Dream" tour, which began
in San Diego and culminated at the state Capitol,
brought him to Stanford last Wednesday.
Gary Flowers, national field director for "Save
the Dream", estimated that the march drew be
tween 13,(KK) and 15,000 people. "This is an un
precedented coalition," he said.
"I was incredibly impressed hy the number of
people who were there," freshman Vanessa Stew
art said.

Civil rights historian and West Lagunita Resi
dent Fellow Stewart Burns estimated that 20 Stan
ford students made the 125-mile trip to Sacra
mento. Burns leads weekly discussions on race for
his residents as part of President Clinton's Dia
logue on Race.
"California — even all of the voters in Califor
nia — does not have the right to overturn federal
civil rights laws and guarantees," he said.
Burns noted that opponents of Prop. 209 and
the English-only initiative see a distinct analogy
between California in 1997 and Confederate
states during the Civil War. Jackson has adver
tised the march as a parallel event to the 1965
march for civil rights from Selma to Montgomery,
Ala.
"We basically took over the front of the Capi
tol," Burns said, noting that the "Save the Dream"
march was probably the largest protest that Sacra
mento has seen in several years.
As late as Sunday night, a bus was scheduled to
leave Stanford for Sacramento at 6 a.m. yesterday.

However, sophomore Genevieve Aguilar. a rep
resentative of El Centro Chicano and the student
coordinator of Stanford's "Save the Dream"
marchers, said the bus was canceled due to lack of
interest.
Niro Anandasabapathy, Class of '97, consid
ered attending the march with other Stanford ac
tivists but decided not to Sunday night.
"1 think going [to the march] would be a good
idea," she said, "but it's just a matter of whether 1
can afford to work it into my schedule." Never
having attended a march, Anandasabapathy was
motivated largely by curiosity.
Burns said that, among others, labor unions.
Native American tribes and almost every college
and university in the California were represented
at the march.
"We marched as very lively, very enthusiastic
marchers," he said. The protest "truly represent
ed the emerging lace of California."
