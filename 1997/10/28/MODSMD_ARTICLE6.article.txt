put African American women ;md their is
sues at the forefront, millions of women

heard Among those women were a group
of Stanford women who recognized the
need lot Stanford to be present at the
march.
Prom the conception of the idea, the
inarch had ;i much different locus than the
Million Man March. I he women who ot
gani/cd the event also felt the need for the
event to be organized completely through
grassroots effort and with little help from
national organizations such as the
NAACP.
In turn, women hoping to attend the
event were expected to rely on their own
ingenuity instead of help from ;inv central
group.
I he march also lacked sufficient funds
to publicize the march heavily. ()rganizers

rcliccJ primarily on word ol mouth and e
mails. Mundi Attinasi. a senior and Ulack
Student 1 Jnion chair. Inst heard about the
march through a Iriend on e mail. "It
sounded like an event that Stanford
women should be definitely ;i part 01.
