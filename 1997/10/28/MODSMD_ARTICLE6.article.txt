put African American women ;md their is
sues at the forefront, millions of women

heard Among those women were a group
of Stanford women who recognized the
need lot Stanford to be present at the
march.
Prom the conception of the idea, the
inarch had ;i much different locus than the
Million Man March. I he women who ot
gani/cd the event also felt the need for the
event to be organized completely through
grassroots effort and with little help from
national organizations such as the
NAACP.
In turn, women hoping to attend the
event were expected to rely on their own
ingenuity instead of help from ;inv central
group.
I he march also lacked sufficient funds
to publicize the march heavily. ()rganizers

rcliccJ primarily on word ol mouth and e
mails. Mundi Attinasi. a senior and Ulack
Student 1 Jnion chair. Inst heard about the

against Africans in America, and
several other issues deemed impor
tant by the organizers of the march.
Two weeks before the march, a
group of women gathered at Ihe
Black Community Services Center
to discuss attending the march. The
women included seniors Imani I lay
good. Mundi Attinasi, Saidah
(irayson, sophomores Solange Ja
cobs and Marini Lee and Kimberly
I insley and Ayaba Worjoloh.
Limited time to plan was the
group's most obvious opposition.
Hut even without a hotel to stay in, a
plane to fly in, or money to spend the
group developed an attitude of in
vincibility. "We'll never know un
less we try" urged I laygood.
Group members attended dorm
meetings, solicited departments,
contacted alumni in the Philadel
phia area and even stood out in
White Plaza collecting money. A
proposal was created to help explain
the group's goals and objectives.
The proposal included discus
sions about the march and its impor
tance to the Stanford community

and proposals for a journal complete
with pictures from the trip, and a
video documentary.
"We have a responsibility to the
people who supported us to bring
back inspiration and insight from
the march" stated Attinasi.
A week before the march the
group collected enough money to
buy plane tickets.
" I was really pleased at the sup
port we received from the Stanford
community, lots of different people
gave a donation, all that mattered is
that we were doing something posi
tive for the Stanford community"
said Grayson.
Several changes occurred before
the trip. Lee was unable to attend
the march so senior Valerie Wilkin
son took her place. The group met
every night for four days to make
sure the trip went smoothly.
They set out for Philadelphia on
Friday, Oct. 24. A feeling of excite
ment and anticipation was shared by
all.
"We've worked so hard to make
this happen, it's so exciting to see
our dream turn into a reality" said
1 laygood.
The group arrived at the Million
Woman March in downtown
Philadelphia at S a.m. on Saturday

"It was the most amazing sight,
African-American women were
everywhere" exclaimed Jacobs.
Planners had created a program
lasting from 8 a.m. until ft p.m.
Speakers, singers, dancers, and
poets shared the message of "Love
and Respect" throughout the day.
"That became the major theme
for the day, that we need to respect
and love each other" observed Wor
joloh. At several times during the
day, the women in the crowd joined
hands showing their solidarity. Ihe
group decided to move around the
crowd and contact interviews with
several march participants.
Minnie Wally, from Delaware,
commented that the march, "is a
chance for us to work together for
one goal — to make our world a bet
ter placed."
A group of college students from
the University of Oklahoma created
a chant expressing their sentiments
about the march, "Women of
power, spreading inspiration. To
lead our women to greater expecta
tions."
Major emphasis was placed on
the woman's role as mother, career
woman, wife and political activist.
Speakers such as rapper Sister
Souljah and Eva Mohammad, a

representative of the Nation of
Islam encouraged women to rise
up against misogyny and degrada
tion of the African-American
woman.
Mandela focused on the bridge
between African and African-Amer
ican women. Waters called for an in
vestigation into alleged CIA activity
in narcotics dealing in Los Angeles.
As the day drew to a close, the
group experienced mixed feelings.
Attinasi expressed that "it was
amazing to see that many black
women but I wish there had been a
greater sense of sisterhood." Wor
joloh commented that "the march
was disorganized but in general was
a great experience."
The group returned Sunday
morning tired but ready to share
their experiences. The group's first
discussion was held Monday night at
a HSU meeting.
Tinsley summed up the event by
saying; "we all learned more about
self-love by interacting in a positive
way with all those black women
from everywhere. I say self-love
because in each black woman we
see ourselves. The best aspect is
that we all formed bonds with so
many people; so much sisterhood
was shared."
