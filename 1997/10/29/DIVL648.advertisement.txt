Will your company grow
as fast as you do?
Almost every company's recruiting ad promises you rapid growth. But
before making any decisions, ask them how fast they're growing. After all,
you're going to have trouble moving up if your company isn't.
Over the last five years, while economic conditions stalled many
organizations, Andersen Consulting averaged 20% growth per year.
Compare that figure to any other firm you're considering. It could be
the difference between getting ahead. And banging your head.
