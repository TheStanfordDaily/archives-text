Announcing courses a year
at a time hinders students'
lone-term academic planning

II "S A ('() MM( )N Stanford experience.
You Hip open the Stanford bulletin to
search for the class that fulfills a major
requirement or a (il R, only to see the infa
mous "not offered I9 1 )7-IW8."
()r else you discover that the course you
desire is being offered during the quarter
when you alreads have to take 20 units, and
you can't determine when the class will be
offered next.
If only lasl year's Hullctin had contained
more detailed information about which
year and quarter the course would be
offered again, perhaps you could have rear
ranged your schedule last year to accom
modate your academic passion. ()h. well.
As I hese examples demonstrate, the lack
of detailed information in the Hullctin
regarding future course offerings is a prob
lem ol considerable inconvenience to stu
dents in planning theii academic programs.
Perhaps, il you're lucky, there is a note
saying that the class will be "offered 1998-
1999," but more often than not students
have no idea il a specific course will be
offered the following year.
furthermore, courses listed as being
offered next yeai do not indicate during
which quarter the course will be taught.
I he lack ol such inl'oi mation also makes
choosing quarters to study abroad a cum
bersome experience. Because students gen
crallv have to apply to go abroad a year in
advance, they have to choose a quarter to
be awav without knowledge ol what cours
es they would be missing at Stanford.
Without detailed information about
when various courses will be offered, it
becomes difficult to go abroad for a quarter
while ensuring that all necessary require
ments are still fulfilled.
Currently departments compile course

information for the upcoming year in
March and then pass il on to the Registrar's
office. I lie Registrar uses this information
lo compile the Hullctin.
While we recognize that it may be diffi
cult for departments to plan courses more
than a year in advance, it is goal that depart
ments should work toward achieving.
Wc recognize that course offerings are
always subject to change professors take
time off, new faculty with new specialties
are hired, and new courses are created as
professors' research interests change.
Indeed, even under the current system
there me changes in courses after the Hul
letin has been printed.
While some might argue that asking
departments to plan their course offerings
two years at time will actually increase the
instance of last minute changes, we believe
the advantages of even somewhat tentative
longer term planning outweigh the current
situation in which students have no idea
when courses will next be offered.
We believe that long term planning
could also be advantageous to faculty. If
they could more or less solidify their sched
ules for the upcoming year prior lo March it
would enable them to begin preparations
I'oi courses more than a year in advance.
( hanging the current system will not be
an easy task, but the potential gains to stu
dents from long-term academic planning
and the facilitation ol study abroad will
enhance the I Jniversitv experience in ways
that outweigh the extra effort of a bit more
advanced planning by departments.
Moreover, because the Registrar has
raised the possibility of prc-registration. such
information is all the more vital for students
ha\ ing to commit to courses in advance.
112 inally, it is occasionally said that Stan
ford undergraduates lack academic focus.
Yet for students who have found their pas
sions. it is a shame that the lack of informa
tion resulting from current system hinders
students from pursuing those interests in
the most optimal way.
