## Serving up a toast to binge drinking 
### 
SOME VICIOUS
FIEND is spreading
a nasty misinterpre
tation of last week's col
umn as heart-warming.
Ye gods, people! I say
one joyous thing, and
suddenly I'm Barney the
Dinosaur.

Well, no more of that.
Our fair administration has been repeat
edly chanting that binge drinking is a horri
ble activity, the sort of thing that drives you
onto the road to oblivion posthaste.
This is utter bull. You're on the road to
oblivion no matter what you do. In the
interim, binge drinking can be a remarkably
rewarding and relaxing recreation.
First, let's consider the facts.
The clearest definition of binge drinking
I've found comes from a 1994 Harvard
School of Public Health study. It defines
binge drinking as having four consecutive
drinks if you're a woman — live if you're a
man — at least once in a two-week period.
It also correlates binge drinking with virtu
ally every social ill you can imagine.
Now for a few non-Harvard facts.
Since my freshman year, I've been a reg
ular binge drinker.
Most of my peers are or have been regu
lar binge drinkers. These are people who
have steadily advanced in their fields of
study, have established civic responsibility,
have usually pleasant attitudes and have
good health. They share a common trait:
they occasionally use alcohol to help
achieve mental quietude and happiness.

I don't consider this wrong, nor do I see
this as a failure on Stanford's part. There is
little Stanford can do to match the crazy joy
of some drinking experiences.
If anything, Stanford did a good job of
allowing me to freely decide how I felt
about alcohol. Bear in mind that many
schools use RAs only as stool pigeons and
propaganda spewers. It could be much
worse.
What concerns me is that it very well

might get much worse. Anti-

drinking rhetoric and party per
secution get a little heavier each
year. Consider what the associa
tion of alcohol with fraternities
has done to Greek-Stanford

relations. This is no joke.
Why this persecution?
There are plenty of stupid rea-

sons for it.
One is that booze is

dangerous and unnecessary

C ----- - j
Then again, so are driving, climbing
mountains, fighting big corporations and
daring to stand up for widely despised
beliefs. Dangerous and unnecessary actions
aren't always bad. They just require more
serious thought than usual.
Another had argument is that because
binge drinking makes non-drinkers uncom
fortable, non-drinkers have a right not to be
exposed to it.
I'm uncomfortable with tons of immedi
ate things that are outside my control,
including Catholicism, Spice Girls and
income taxes. Saying I have the right to be
free of these things is ludicrous.

If I don't like something, I have the right
to be free of it only insofar as I undertake
the responsibility either to avoid it or to
speak out against it. Making up rights that
don't correspond to cold, hard responsibili
ties is akin to leaping headfirst off the boat
of moral thinking into murky waters.
A final stock argument is that many of
Stanford's students are underage.
Now, 1 have no problem with Stanford

telling its young'uns not to drink
because of the law. 1 understand
that Stanford has to cover its butt
like any other business.

But Stanford should not

do the job of the
police. Moreover, it

must always remember
that moral development

should never be done for

a person.

Developing beliefs and accepting

the resulting consequences are the pillars of
ethical living. The thought of Stanford per
verting this process, even once, is so dis
turbing to me that it has made me deadly
serious for almost an entire column. Ye
gods again!
So the next time Stanford tells you not to
binge on booze, say in a polite but firm
voice that you'll decide for yourself.
And then welcome yourself back to the
world of free thought.
