Poverty exists at Stanford
From your story on Stanford's migrant
I.irm (Webb Ranch) students would never
know that farm workers live and work in
poverty on Stanford land.
Your reporter quotes ranch overseer
loin I iubbard. not workers, tin how work
crs fed about conditions at the ranch. I lie
onl\ worker who is quoted refers to a lot of
dissatisfied workers, bul treats them as
malcontents who divide the community.
I Ins is hardly fail or objective reporting.
Workers who make $(i.5() an hour, with
out benefits are poor. You say the top pay
is but you do not say how many
workers make that amount. 1 lie great
majority are closer to the lower figure.
As for the "dormitory" housing workers.
this sounds like a sick joke. "Sheds" would
be more descriptive. Stanford students
should msii the ranch and see how they 'd
like to live and work under such conditions.
I 'diversity President Gerhard Gasper's
refusal to intervene on behalf ol the work
ers represents a continuing shame foi Stan
lord.

I'oo bad President and Mrs. Clinton did
not go to the Ranch. I hey might have pro
voked action from a morally indifferent
Stanford community.

In June l l )%. former Music Department

years as lecturer in ja// studies with neither
a warning nor a hearing.
I Ic offered me reasons for this decision:
the grade complaints of two failed stu
dents. the unfounded personal complaint
ol one student who accused me of "racism"
and Chafe's plan to reorganize the Jazz
Program "to try out a variety of approach
es."
('hate's reorganization of the Jazz Stud
ies Program displayed a lack of experience
in this highly specialized field, with no
understanding of what students need to
know and what they do not need to know.
M\ jazz history courses designed to
introduce students to the Hachs. Mo/arts

and Stravinsky's of American music
Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Art
l atum. Coleman Hawkins, Bix Beider

C hafe to make room for "Workshop in
Pop / Rock Music Arranging" and "Cre
ative Processes in Popular Music Record
ing" focusing on Stevie Wonder, Michelle
Shocked. The Carpenters and Jewel.
Members of the Music Department fac
ulty unfamiliar with such performers are
urged to view MTV. the channel aimed
exclusively at a mass audience of culturally
deprived children.
Only then can the consequences of
Chafe's "reorganization" be fully grasped.
I do not believe that it is the function of
the University to legitimize and reinforce
the ignorance nnd bad taste media-foisted
on students during their impressionable
pubescence.
One hopes that the new chair of the
Music Department will act swiftly to rectify
the ill-considered changes wrought by his
predecessor.

Ban is unnecessary
Halogen lamps have been banned
from residences due to fire potential, and
The Daily supports this decision.
I do not. It is ridiculous.
A halogen lamp, properly used, has
virtually no potential to start a fire. That
it has done so in a few cases is more
indicative of a lack of knowledge about
how they should be used than of a lack of
safety.
What if Stanford banned all things that
were as "dangerous" as halogen lamps?
I'm sure more fires have been started on
stoves and in ovens. I'm sure more fires
have been started by careless smokers.
And I'm sure more fires have been start
ed by Christmas lights.
So why not unplug all stoves and
ovens, make on-campus smoking illegal
and banish Christmas lights?
Better yet. banish lights of any kind;
you never know who might put his or her
light near a box of matches.
There's a point at which risk is so
small that it's not worth making some-

thing illegal. I believe thai the risk is too
small in the case of halogen lamps, espe
cially considering the recent publicity sur
rounding their potential danger, to war
rant this policy.
Many others do too. In fact. 1 would
not be surprised if many students still had
halogen lamps in their residences and
many professors still had them in their
offices.
And that's where the real danger lies.
Rules that aren't respected cause a
decrease in respect for other, more
important rules, such as those regarding
drug usage, security and general civility.
I also find it especially ironic that Stan
ford has a rule for this and yet has no
rules lor. say. wearing bike helmets, con
sidering how many bike accidents occur
on campus yearly and how many non-hel
meted bicyclists 1 see every day.
I he point is that a lack of respect for
campus rules is far more dangerous than
allowing a few halogen lamps into our
midst.
