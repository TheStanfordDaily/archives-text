I DISCOVERED POETIC beauty in
Prague last weekend, but it didn't come
from any of the bridges, churches or the
palace for which the city has earned interna
tional fame.
Friday night, my friends and I were head
ing out to dinner. As we strolled along
Prague's main drag toward Old Town
Square, 1 saw a sight that almost reduced me
to tears.. .Dunkin' Donuts.
In the less than 48 hours we spent in
Prague, we ate there twice, consuming
among the four of us, about two dozen
doughnuts.
Such behavior is, I admit, a little odd.
especially for me. At home, 1 don't think I
have ever been inside a Dunkin' Donuts. In
fact. I even don't even like doughnuts. Yet
there was something comforting about sitting
in a Dunkin' Donuts chowing down on a del
icacy so decidedly American.
The familiarity of the doughnuts contrast
ed greatly with my non-existent knowledge
of Czech and the distinctly foreign feeling I
had hanging out in the city.
Before I went to Prague, mv knowledge
of the city consisted of a photograph on the

front of postcard 1 had received from a friend
and the first few scenes in "Mission Impossi
ble." I figured that this deep and significant
knowledge would prevent me from feeling
disorientated.
Warned again and again to stay out of taxi
cabs in Prague because they are completely
unregulated, on arrival, we took the Metro to
our pension. We did ourselves proud getting
on the Metro.
Once we got off, I felt a little bit like
Dorothy must have in that scene in the Wiz
ard of Oz when the movie suddenly switches
into color. Dorothy emerges from her house,
Toto in hand, and she realizes that she is far,
far away from Kansas,
As we emerged from the subway, signs all
around us pointed up and out of the subway
system. We struggled with the signs in the
station, hoping to match the indicated street
names with the names printed on our map.
At first we were confused because all of
the signs seemed to point lo the same street.
It had a long, complicated name that started
with a "v," which seemed strangely familiar. I
then realized that we had seen it in the train
station where we had boarded the Metro.

It slowly dawned on me that it was not the
name of a street in Prague, but rather the
Czech word for "exit."
Yet compared to our next debacle with
Czech, that incident proved relatively unhu
miliating. However, I'm sure the Czech com
muters had a good laugh at the four Ameri
can college students, who among the lour of
them had at least three maps and not a clue
as to where they were.
After dropping off our bags at the pen
sion. we left to go explore Prague by night.
We needed to take a tram to get into the city.
I Insure whether or not we were in the right
place, we decided to try communicating with
the locals.
A woman was standing a few feet away
from us and. unfortunately, she spoke nei
ther English, Cierman nor Spanish. Having
exhausted all of the possibilities for a com
mon language, we began pointing and signal
ing. She assured us that indeed we were
headed in the right direction.
()ne of my friend's had a Berlitz pocket
guide to Prague, which included a list of use
ful Czech expressions. To express our grati
tude, we flipped through the book and in

turn each of us put 011 our best Czech accent
and said thank you.
The woman smiled at us and laughed. She
looked highly amused, but I interpreted that
as a sign of her extreme gratitude for our
attempt to speak her native tongue.
The next day after having examined the
Berlitz guide more carefully, we realized that
we had said "very much" rather than "thank
you." The Czech woman laughed at us not
because she was impressed with our com
mand of the language, but rather because we
must have looked like total morons.
Being somewhere so foreign is somewhat
frustrating. However, it would be unfair to
say that the only reason I craved Dunkin'
Donutswas because I felt particularly out-of
place in Prague.
My quest for American items and the
comfort they provide began well before my
trip to Prague.
Two weeks ago while traveling in Ger
many, my Saturday was filled with famous
architecture, history and culture. Ihe high
light of my weekend, however, came when I
found a store that specialized 111 American
goodies, including Snapplc.

1 was traveling, will) a I'rieiul and the two
of us sat on ;i bench ami tlrank our Snapplcs.
As I sipped my lemonade, I lelt a bizarre
sense ol elation and a certain calmness.
A feast of Kraft macaroni and cheese
magically turned in\ foul mood into a decent
one.
I cannot even begin to count the numhci
of times 1 have broken dow u and ended up in
McDonald's since I arrived in Merlin.
Recently, the trips have become more he
quent. Chicken McNuggets and milkshakes
have taken on a w hole new meaning.
In a weird way. however, I think that eat
ing things that are shamelessly Ameiican
makes me leel connected to home. It's kind
of my own personal rebellion, against the
looming dangers ol assimilation.
Unfortunately. I have vet to find a
Dunkin' I)onuts in Uci tin.
l or now. I guess I'll |iist have to make due
with Mel)onald's.
