## Energetic Foster stands out Soccer senior calmly accepts leadership role as career winds down 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
From the sideline ol New Maloney lield, it's
sometimes tough to distinguish between players.
On the lar side ol the lield. colors blur together
and masses ol ( ardinal midfielders, indistinguish
able, coagulate around the white dot that is the
soccer ball.
But somehow you can always see F.lie Foster.
And its not just her hair, although on a sunny day
it shines as brightly white as the ball. It's not the
bright red bow she uses to tie her ponytail. either.
hosier is the player gesticulating madly, point
ing. yelling, vocalizing instructions to her troops.
See the player laughing, screaming or uttering
compliments to teammates as she passes by?
That's Foster.
In the meantime, she also plavs some wicked
soccer — and ;i lot ol it. The Stanford co-captain
has played in more games than all but one player,
fellow senior co-captain Fmily Hurt.
During her four starting seasons, Foster has
seen more than her share of accolades. After win
ning Rookie ol the Year honors as a freshman and
being named second-team All-Pacific 10 Confer
ence two years ago. Foster piled up more honors
last season: She was named first-team AU-Pae-10

and earned honorable mention l'ac-10 All-Acad
emic recognition.
She was also named co-captain at the end of
last season. Hut in typical modest Foster fashion,
she shrugged off the achievement.
"There were only three seniors on the team,"
she said. "It wasn't that big of a deal."
This year, her raucous manner on the field
helps lead a Cardinal squad centered around
communication, on and off the field.
"In our playing style, we have to talk ;i lot while
we're playing," Foster said. "Somehow that car
ries over to when we leave the field."
"We all hang out away from practice and
games, too. This team is the tightest I've ever been
on."
Until she was 15, Foster played soccer on
teams her dad coached. Eventually, she graduat
ed to more competitive club and high school
teams in her native Minneapolis.
"My older brother was always into soccer." she
said. "It seemed like I was just taking the natural
path."
When it came time to pick a college. Foster
narrowed her options down to Stanford and Dart
mouth. I he soccer program at Dartmouth, and
specifically its young coach, Steve Swanson. at
tracted Foster. Hut eventually Stanford won out.

"I had never been to California before," Foster
said. "But it seemed like soccer and academics
were less rigid than on the East Coast. Things
seemed more laid-back."
Swanson, the coach who had unsuccessfully
tried to woo Foster to Dartmouth, eventually
ended up in Palo Alto two years ago. Foster now
enjoys the best of both worlds.
And now. after four years, her life on the Farm
is slowly coming to an end. But Foster has yet to
make any concrete plans about the future.
"Mv parents keep asking me about that," she
admitted. "Some day 1 might want to go to law
school. And I'd love to go to a foreign country to
teach English."
Foster's future soccer plans are only slightly
more concrete.
"I'll continue to play on local club teams," she
said. She also said that she wouldn't rule out play
ing for the fledgling women's professional soccer
league if the option presented itself.
Most of all, though, she's disappointed to leave
her teammates behind.
"I think the team's headed in a very good di
rection," she said. "They will keep getting bettei
and better in the future."
By then, Foster might be in Spain teaching stu
dents the English word for "futbol."
