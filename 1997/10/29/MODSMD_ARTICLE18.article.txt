# Draft leads Card defense vs. Bruins
## UCLA star McElroy short on height, not confidence 
### Mark Dittmer Special The Stanford Daily 
On any given weekday afternoon, there
are two Jim MeMroys at lIC'LA football
practice.
It's pivi asy to tell them apart. ()ne of
them is «' -seel in pads. running routes,
catching passes and keeping his teammates
loi >se.
I'he other .irrives late to practice and sits
m the bleachers on the west side ol the Bru
ms' practice field. He wears plain clothes,
talks with people in the bleachers and occa
sionally yells encouraging words at players on
the field.
If need be. there is one surefire way to dis
tinguish one Jim McElroy from the other:
Only one ol them has the Roman numeral
"IV" tattooed on his right arm.
I hat would be wide receiver Jim McElroy
IV. who is having his best season as a Bruin in
his senior campaign.
Just eight games into the season. McElroy
has already set personal season highs in
catches (33). receiving yards (774) and touch
downs (7) ()l IJCLA's offensive weapons,
onlv Skip I licks is called on more often.
While McElroy's numbers are certainly
impressive. NIL scouts may not take notice
due to the receiver's small stature. McElroy
stands just 5-foot-l() and weighs 156
pounds.
"What do you think about his size?" Jim
McElroy responded with an edge when

asked whether si/e is an obstacle.
This is the other Jim McElroy, the one
who watches practice. McElroy 111 is the
proud father ol I K I .As star wideout.
"People who worry about things like that
let it become a handicap." McElroy 111 said.
"But if you're like Jim. you want people to
t;■ ke you for granted. I hen you knock the
heck out of them and they go. Damn! What
happened?"
"I read an article once.... It said. Despite
his si/e. he's still a great football player. I
thought. 'This is what we've been dealing
with all our lives
McElroy 111 is 6-foot-2,155 pounds ("I'm
not short. | list skinny," he said). 11 is best sport
in high school was track, but he also played
football and wrestled. I ike his son. he had to
prove himself against bigger opponents.
"I was a lot meaner than Jim was."he said.
"I always wanted to prove to people that even
though I was small. I was an animal. Jim
doesn't have that problem. I just had a worse
attitude. Jim's a nicer guy.
The receiver expressed his own desire to
follow in his father's footsteps.
"I used to always go running with him in
the mornings and stuff." McElroy IV said.
"My father is my idol. I look up to him. I feel
that it there's anybody I would ever want to
grow up to be like, it's him.
"He pretty much taught me to go out there
and just play. 1 wouldn't be here if I couldn't
