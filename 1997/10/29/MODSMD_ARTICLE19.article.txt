Hut there was a time when
Draft did not lit into Stanford's
defense as neatly he does now.
As a running haek at Valencia
High School in Anaheim, Calif.,
Draft rushed for 1,367 yards and
scored touchdowns his senior
year. ()n defense, he racked lip 65
tackles and 10 sacks while being
named a consensus high school
All-American and California In
terscholastic Federation I'layer of
the Year.
"I very major school was after
him, hut I thought that getting the
education that Stanford kids get
would he so valuable." said Valen
cia high school coach Mike Marru
jo. "I thought that it would be best
for him."
Cirowing up in Southern Cali
fornia. Draft hadn't heard much
about Stanford. It wasn't until the
Cardinal started recruiting him
that Marrujo told Draft about an
other Valencia running back who
decided to play football on the
Farm Darrin Nelson.
Nelson went on to gain over
4JKK) yards for the Cardinal from
1977-KI and still ranks as Stan
lord's all-time leading rusher.
"Physically they were different.
Darrin was a small, quick guy."
Marrujo said. "But their work
ethic and their desire were similar.
Moth were also so much better
than anyone else on their team
that it wasn't even funny."
Draft also had high hopes for
his collegiate career. Recruited as
as an offensive player, he was in
for a surprise when he arrived at
Stanford in the fall of 1994.
"I was told all through the re
cruiting process that I was going to

play fullback," Draft said, "lust
about the first day I was here. [tlie
coaches| said, 'We need a little bit
more help on defense.' I hey
switched me to strong safety."
From there Draft went on a
strange and difficult journey
through the entire defense.
After starting one game at
strong safety. Draft was moved to
outside linebacker. Later in the
season, he found hiinsell at del'en
sive end. while also sporadically
playing inside linebacker. Vei \ few
players ever move from the sec
ondary to the defensive line, much
less during their freshman yeai
"I wasn't disappointed moving
|positions]," Draft said. I was |iisi
disappointed by the fact that I
moved so much. I was never able
to get a total grasp of a particular
position."
lb make matters more difli
cult, the coaches were not iiist tin
kering with I)rafl, they were mak
ing adjustments to the entire de
tense.
"It was very frustrating. It was
live positions in name, but at that
time we were changing up the de
fensive schemes almost every
week, so it was more like eight po
sitions," I )raft said.
I he following year. Draft
found himsell penciled in at out
side linebacker, lint in the < ardi
nal's second game against pass
happy Utah. Stanford decided to
add a defensive back, so Draft
moved to inside linebacker. I tali
ended up trying to run f< >r much ol
the game, and Draft made Ins
mark, totaling 1 I tackles and
blocking a punt From that game
on. Draft made inside Imebackei

with 103 tackles and was voted
Most ()utstanding Sophomore In
his teammates. In last season's
Sun Howl. Draft forced a fumble
late in the game that preserved
Stanford's 3K 0 shutout over
Michigan State.
Despite suffering a hamstring
ni|iiry earlier this season. Draft
has continued to help a talented
defense stifle opposing rushers,
while also guiding the unit
through its rough times.
"He's a guy that's a big leader
for us. He's our play caller and
makes our adjustments," said se
nior Kailee Wong. "Not only that,
he makes big plays."
Ihe frustrations he went
through playing positions all ovei
the field may have actually given
Draft an improved perspective on
the game. As the signal caller for
the defense. Draft not onlv sees

what his teammates are supposed
to do, he has also been in their
shoes.
"I always felt like the strength of
mv game was being able to under
stand my position totally and un
derstand the other positions on the
field, to have a clear picture of
what's going on," Draft said.
Although it took time for Draft
to find his niche in Stanford's de
fense. his intense work ethic has re
mained with him. Wherever he's
played, he has carried with him a
mentality that may be the secret to
his success.
"I just want to get better," Draft
said. "I feel like if I'm ever sitting
around, like right now, someone's
getting better than me — putting
extra time in watching film, in the
weight room, or studying more than
me.

cruiting process that I was going to

play fullback," Draft said, "lust
about the first day I was here. [tlie
coaches| said, 'We need a little bit
more help on defense.' I hey
switched me to strong safety."
From there Draft went on a
strange and difficult journey
through the entire defense.
After starting one game at
strong safety. Draft was moved to
outside linebacker. Later in the
season, he found hiinsell at del'en
sive end. while also sporadically
playing inside linebacker. Vei \ few
players ever move from the sec
ondary to the defensive line, much
less during their freshman yeai
"I wasn't disappointed moving
|positions]," Draft said. I was |iisi
disappointed by the fact that I
moved so much. I was never able
to get a total grasp of a particular
position."
lb make matters more difli
cult, the coaches were not iiist tin
kering with I)rafl, they were mak
ing adjustments to the entire de
tense.
"It was very frustrating. It was
live positions in name, but at that
time we were changing up the de
fensive schemes almost every
week, so it was more like eight po
sitions," I )raft said.
I he following year. Draft
found himsell penciled in at out
side linebacker, lint in the < ardi
nal's second game against pass
happy Utah. Stanford decided to
add a defensive back, so Draft
moved to inside linebacker. I tali
ended up trying to run f< >r much ol
the game, and Draft made Ins
mark, totaling 1 I tackles and
blocking a punt From that game
on. Draft made inside Imebackei
Ins home. He finished the year
with 103 tackles and was voted
Most ()utstanding Sophomore In
his teammates. In last season's
Sun Howl. Draft forced a fumble
late in the game that preserved
Stanford's 3K 0 shutout over
Michigan State.
Despite suffering a hamstring
ni|iiry earlier this season. Draft
has continued to help a talented
defense stifle opposing rushers,
while also guiding the unit
through its rough times.
"He's a guy that's a big leader
for us. He's our play caller and
makes our adjustments," said se
nior Kailee Wong. "Not only that,
he makes big plays."
Ihe frustrations he went
through playing positions all ovei
the field may have actually given
Draft an improved perspective on
the game. As the signal caller for
the defense. Draft not onlv sees

what his teammates are supposed
to do, he has also been in their
shoes.
"I always felt like the strength of
mv game was being able to under
stand my position totally and un
derstand the other positions on the
field, to have a clear picture of
what's going on," Draft said.
Although it took time for Draft
to find his niche in Stanford's de
fense. his intense work ethic has re
mained with him. Wherever he's
played, he has carried with him a
mentality that may be the secret to
his success.
"I just want to get better," Draft
said. "I feel like if I'm ever sitting
around, like right now, someone's
getting better than me — putting
extra time in watching film, in the
weight room, or studying more than
me.
"Once you stop striving to get
better, you're going to get worse."
