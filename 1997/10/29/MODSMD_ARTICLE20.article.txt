lost. 29-23. And in 1970, Stanford's
first Rose Bowl team in two decades
dropped a 22-14 decision here.
Stanford will still go to the Gator
Bowl, but that game has lost much
of the luster it seemed to have w hen
the matchup was announced last
week
The Bears "came into the football
game with high intensity and emo
tion," Stanford coach Jack Elway
said. "You've got to give them credit.
There are no excuses as far as we're
concerned. We knew they're a tal
ented football team. We knew they
could salvage a lot from the disap
pointment they've had in the past."
"They played with more emotion
than we did." Stanford wide receiver
Jeff James said. "They have some
good athletes. I don't know why they
had the record they did."
Had the Bears played defense
like they did Saturday, they wouldn't
have. Stanford finished with only 41
yards rushing on the afternoon, and
running back Brad Muster, who car
ried 75 times for 373 yards in his two
previous games, carried IK times for

only 59 yards before leaving in the
third quarter with a contusion above
his right knee.
"I thought we'd have more suc
cess with the running game," said
Muster, who earlier last week was
named a first-team All-American by
Eastman Kodak. "Their defense pro
tected well on the outside. 1 thought
the cutback was there, but we had a
little trouble sustaining blocks."
The offensive line that had
looked so good in springing Muster
the last two games didn't Saturday.
Not only was the running game inef
fective, but Paye was rudely intro
duced to Cal defenders on seven oc
casions and forced to run. dodge and
scramble on several others.
"We really got whipped upfront,"
Elway said. "They were coming off
the ball and getting penetration...."
Paye was hampered by a severely
sore shoulder all game, but managed
to complete 23-of-35 passes for 224
yards with no interceptions. lake
away a 69-yard touchdown to James,
though, and Paye's average comple
tion was under eight yards.
