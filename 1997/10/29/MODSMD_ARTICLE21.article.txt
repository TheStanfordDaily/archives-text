Scientists research better ways to get gas

When you fill up the fuel tank
ol your car and reach for your
ever-thinning wallet, take solace
in the research conducted by
Martin Blunt, a petroleum engi
neering professor in the School
ol Earth Sciences. B lunt's

research is meant to improve the efficiency of oil
and natural gas recovery from underground
reservoirs.
While traditional methods only recover one
hall of the natural gas available in any given
reservoir. Blunt is developing a new method of
"gas injection." (las injection, an extremely effi
cient process, uses the fact that natural gas is col
lected as a by-product when oil is extracted and
piped. In fact, nearly all of the natural gas in the
reservoir can be recovered with this process.
The only problem, however, with gas injection
is that oil reservoirs are typically found in remote
areas such as Alaska and Russia. The remoteness
of the oil reservoirs makes the natural gas col
lected from these reservoirs difficult and expen
sive to transport to world markets.
In an attempt lo solve this and other problems,
graduate students in Blunt's group are working
with various oil and rock samples to gather quan
titative data. Other students are performing the
oretical and numerical work for the purpose of
creating various computer simulations that will
hopefully make gas injection more feasible.
A second and equally important application of
this work is in the field of environmental science.
The excavation of oil primarily involves work with
three fluid phases: oil. water and gas. Because
most pollutants in the soil also have the three fluid
phases of pollutant, water, and vapor or air,
Blunt's research can also be used to better under
stand the dynamics of groundwater pollution.
Chemists model biological processes

When of'models*
don't just think of massive com
puters churning out complex
streams of data and intricate
graphs. For Chemistry Prof.
Dan Stack, models are much
more than mathematical equa-

lions and numbers. Stack's research group is
working on a method to model some of the most
basic biological processes of the human body
through the use of chemistry.
Stack is examining the reaction of small iron
or copper complexes with dioxygen. The focus of
this research is to try and understand the prod
ucts and species formed in the reaction. In the
human body, certain enzymes use copper or iron
to bind dioxygen. Nature has evolved a unique
mechanism for this process that is unlike almost
anything else in the world.
Stack's work mimics this complex biological
mechanism. Simply put. Stack's research takes a
unique mechanism from one of nature's biolog
ical systems and moves the mechanism to the
test tube. The chemical mechanism is then avail
able for manipulation and use outside ol a spe
cific system. The exportable nature of the dupli
cated mechanism makes it far more useful for
study. Most importantly, the small molecule
chemistry truly mimics the process of the bio
logical system.
Stack's use of basic chemistry to model biolog
ical reactions may have important environmental
implications. At present, no good catalytic system
exists for the oxidization of compounds involving
iron and copper complexes. Potential applica
tions of the work include the development ol
environmentally friendly catalysts.
