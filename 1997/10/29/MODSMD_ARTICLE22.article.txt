# Scientists help create nature preserve

In response to heavy slash and burn techniques used
in Madagascar, a team led by Claire Kremen, a research
associate with Stanford's Center for ( onscrvation Biol
ogy, designed a 840-square-mile park to save some of
the island's valuable ecosystems.
Masoala, a peninsula located 011 the eastern side of
the island of Madagascar, contains some of the richest
biodiversity 011 earth. Unfortunately, local residents
have caused heavy destruction to the environment of
this region.
Between 1957 and 1991, 25 percent of the forests in
the peninsula fell prey to the plague of deforestation.
Many rare and exotic species faced endangerment and
possibly extinction. In the wake of this potential disas
ter. the Madagascar government, in conjunction with
the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), CAR!-
International and the Peregrine Fund, formulated a
plan in 1993 to create the Masoala National Park.
At the initial stages of planning, Kremen, who also
holds an appointment as an associate conservationist for
WCS. and her team decided to incorporate measures to
both sustain the natural habitat as well as respect the
needs of the local people. I he first task of the team was
to map the terrain, including the rain forests and coral
reefs.
With satellite imagery and topographic maps provid
ed by the Missouri Botanical (iarden and the U.S. Geo
logical Survey. Andrew Weiss of Stanford's Center for
Conservation Biology used the imagery to reveal which
areas of the land were most important to sustain the
species and which areas were most widely used for farm
ing. This information enabled the planning team to
decide which parts of the forest would be open to the
people for their own use and which parts would be pre
served for the natural habitat.
When the plan was first implemented, Kremen said
that there "was some resistance because the local peo
ple were concerned that projects signaled talking and 110
action." However, the plan allowed the local people to
participate in its formation. For example, the planning
team respected the traditional boundaries of the vil
lages, and they designed the park in such a way that the
people would still be able to use certain parts ol the for
est to sustain themselves.
Thus, part of the park was designated as a "multiple
use /one" for use by the peninsula's people, and the
other part was designated as the "core protected area,"
which would belong only to the national park for con
servation. Because the plan provided part of the forest's
resources It) the people, the rest of the forest was pre
served from encroachment.
The most important part of the program was the edu
cation of the locals. According to Kremen, "the main
challenge was how to manage resources sustainably."
Unfortunately, the local people had a "pattern ol using
resources until it ran out." Kremen said that she realized
that one "needs economic incentives" to involve people
on the "brink of survival."
The first initiative was to change the agricultural
methods of the people. For example, the team taught
locals to use crop rotation and diversification to prevent
soil depletion. Kremen also said that "training people
how to harvest the forest sustainably and get forest
products to worldwide markets"was crucial because the
local people could reap more benefits from the forest

while preserving more ol the forest at the same time.
Lastly, the team hoped that ecotourism would
increase on the island so that the local people would
have an incentive to preserve the forest. I litis, unlike
many other major preserves around the world, the pro
gram to establish the park involved the participation
and wishes of the local people as well.
When the park was officially dedicated on ()ct. IS. it
was greeted with enthusiasm and strong local support.

However, in order to ensure success lot the program
Kremen said dial the eliort to "educate people on tin
benefits ol sustainability" must eonliiuie ami the pu>
gram must adapt lo the changing circumstances ol I Ik
future.
Kremen added dial tins program "is a big succes
because we set up lite largest park in Madagascar,
park that sustains many valuable species ol Madagas
car."
