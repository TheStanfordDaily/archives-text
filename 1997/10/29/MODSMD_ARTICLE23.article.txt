# Inflationary cosmology:
## Physics professor modifies big-bang theory 
### Erika Check Contributing writer 
For Physics Prof. Andrei Linde, the
traditional non-religious story of creation
involving the big-bang theory is too sim
ple. Linde has been working for 15 years
on what he calls "inflationary cosmolo
gy." which answers some bothersome
questions that the big-bang theory just
doesn't explain.
According to Linde, the main prob
lem with big-bang theory is that it fails to
account for the incredihlv large size of

the universe or all of the matter con
tained within it.
Inflationary cosmology addresses
those gaps by proposing that the universe
began with an exponentially rapid expan
sion ol matter that happened within a
fraction ol a second. The initial period ol
inflation was triggered by a "scalar field."
which is a specific form ol matter that
may contain large amounts of energy.
After the initial inflation period, the
scalar field rapidly decayed into particles
to produce ordinary matter. I Ins leads
back to the original story of the big bang,

because alter the initial inflation and
decay ol the scalar field, a large-scale
explosion hurled the newly created mat
ter throughout space to create stars,
planets and galaxies. In other words,
there was a big hang, hut it was preceded
by a period ol massive inflation caused
by a scalar field.
Hut the best part ol the story is that
it's not over yet. In some parts ol the uni
verse, the scalar field may still be strong.
In such places, the universe may |tist be
beginning the process ol rapid expan
sion. I his means that new pockets ol uni

verse are continually forming.
Linde compared the initial expansion
ol the universe to the growth ol a large
bubble. As the bubble expands over
time, different areas ol the bubble take
on different scalar field values, and new
matter is produced in the form of every
thing from planets to people. In other
areas ol the large bubble, the universe
stops expanding altogether.
"The universe is alive," Linde
cxplaiiK d. " I his isn't physics, its biology
He added that the shape of the uni
verse is like a cactus that is continual
ly sprouting new growths from its cen
tral stem. "The universe is immortal.
Each piece of the cactus may die, but
the tree keeps growing indefinitely,"
he said.
According to Linde, the stan
dard big bang theory was not pow
erful enough to create the universe
as we know it. The reason is that re
gions of high density expand much
faster than regions of low density.
After the expansion of the matter
contained in the initial big- bang
explosion, the density of matter
contained in the universe should
have decreased, which would have
caused its rate of expansion to de
crease.
In Linde's words, "The main
problem with the big-bang [theory] is

that it's a hang, hut it's not big
enough. It starts hig hut it rapidly
slows down." The result should he a
universe that is much smaller than we
know ours to he.
Scalar fields don't have to contain
particles of matter — in fact, the orig
inal scalar field was probably a pure
field of high energy density. Because
the amount of ordinary matter con
tained in the field was negligible, the
density of energy in the field wouldn't
change very much even as it expand
ed, and the field would continue to
expand extremely quickly for the du
ration of its inflation.
"In standard hig-hang theory, the
universe expands two times and the
density of the particles decreases
eight times. Hut with scalar fields, an
expanding universe density decreas
es very little," Linde said, which al
lows the universe to grow much
faster than in the standard big-bang
theory and accounts for the large
size of the universe that we know.
