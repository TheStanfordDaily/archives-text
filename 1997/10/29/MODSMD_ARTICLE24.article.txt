eDear Tom.
My wife and I were won
dering about the costs and
benefits of eggs in our diet.
I think that a couple of eggs per
week is probably not too much of a
cholesterol risk and can be a good
source of protein. My wife feels
that eggs are probably bad in any
amount. What's the scoop?

A Brian,
There are a few answers
to your question, depend
ing on which point of view
you are considering. The dietary
guidelines handed down to us from
the American Dietetic Associa
tion. the American Heart Associa
tion and the Surgeon General rec
ommend that our diets consist ol

no more than two to three eggs per
week. Each egg yolk contains 375
ing of cholesterol on average and
the recommended guideline is to
consume no more than K) mg ol
cholesterol on a daily basis for
healthy Americans (barring any
special diseases or circumstances).
So. two to three eggs per week
probably isn't that much ol a risk
lor a healthy Stanford undergradu
ate or graduate student. You just
have to be conscious of your
cholesterol intake as a whole. So il
you're having eggs for breakfast, a
hamburger for lunch and some
tried chicken at dinner, you should
probably consider adjusting your
diet to cut out some of the choles
terol: getting rid of the egg yolks
could be a good start. The egg
yolks also contain a very limited
amount of fat, and the dietary
guidelines also recommend that 30

percent or less ol our total daily
caloric intake come from fat.
Hut you can avoid this eg
cholesterol issue and still benelit
from egg protein by eating the egjj
whites without the yolks. Almost
all of the protein that we derive
from eating eggs is contained with
in the egg whiles themselves and
not in the yolk of the egg. As ;i mat
ter of fact, the egg white is virtually
HK) percent protein.
Keep in mind that you can
include egg whites from hard
boiled eggs in your diet as a great

snack and protein source. What I
do, lor example, is boil a do/en
eggs every so often and store them
in a Tupperware eontainer in the
refrigerator. And any time when I
feel the urge to snack on some
thing. I cut the hard boiled egg in
hall, pop out the yolk, and eon
sume the egg whites as a fat free,
cholesterol free and protein filled
snack. ()i you could dice up Ihe egi'
whites from your hard boiled egi'
and include them in a salad as a
source ol protein. I he possibilities
are endless.
