# History prof's appeal denied
## Sawislak's tenure case goes to provost 
### T.J. Babbitt Contributing writer 
Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven for
mally rejected Asst. History Prof.
Karen Sawislak's tenure appeal yes
terday.in effect refusing to reverse
his own decision to deny her tenure.
Sawislak's appeal has moved up a
level, and now Sawislak's profes

sional fate lies in the hands of
Provost C 'ondoleeza Rice.
Sawislak was originally passed
over for tenure last spring. Although
the History Department recom
mended Sawislak for tenure nearly
unanimously — one person ab
stained — she was turned down by
the deans of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
To gain tenure, an applicant must
be approved by his or her depart
ment, the deans, an advisory commit
tee and the provost.
On Oct. 9. Sawislak appealed the
original decision to deny her tenure ,
asking Shoven to appoint a grievance
officer to investigate her case. Yester
day.he declined to do so.
That decision, Sawislak said,
means her next move will be to ap
peal to Rice. Shoven said this was the
course he expected the case to take.
"It would be better for the case to
be investigated by someone other
than the dean who made the original
decision," said Shoven. "We wanted
to get it to the provost prompty."
Sawislak said she was disappoint
ed by t he decision and plans to pursue
her appeal.
"I'm hopeful that I will receive a
full hearing on this matter," she said
last night.
Sawislak's case has reached the
provost's level much more quickly
than the tenure case of then-Asst.
Anthropology Prof. Akhil (iupta,
whose eventually successful appeal
languished for months before reach
ing the provost level. That case was
given to a grievance officer at the
school level because of a dispute over
some of the evidence considered in

the original decision.
Students who have worked for the
tenure of Sawislak were predictably
disappointed hut said that the real
fight has only begun.
"One of the problems with tenure
grievances is that the first step seems
like a formality because the dean is
reviewing his own decision," said
Chuck Carlson, a history doctoral
student who has campaigned for the
tenure of Sawislak.
Earlier in the day, the Student
Coalition to Tenure Karen Sawislak
had held a meeting in White Plaza to
discuss ways to support Sawislak's ap
peal. About 40 students attended.
"Professor Sawislak epitomizes
what a professor should be in terms of
both research and teaching," said
Bernstein at the meeting. "I don't un
derstand why they turned her down."
She echoed many students in her
characterization of the tenure deci
sion-making process as needlessly se
cretive.
Senior Aly Remtulla, an ASSU
senator who was active in the student
movement last year to support
C iupta, said that publicity was the key
to winning the tenure battle.
"One of the reasons (iupta got
tenure was because of undergraduate
support and a lot of public attention,"
he said.
Still, the students expected a pro
tracted process.
"This may be more of a siege than
anything else," Carlson said.
