necessary to adapt after living in the Stanford "bubble"

Ever wonder what life after Stanford is
like? How does it feel to live in a
1 new city? How does work compare
with school? What is it like to live on your own
and have to cook for yourself? To answer these
questions, we asked two recent Stanford
graduates to indulge us on adjusting to life after
Stanford.
Mauro Cardenas is an economics major from the class of '97. He is a research
analyst for the Law Economics Consulting Group in Berkeley, Calif.
Jack Mulder is an industrial engineering major, also from the class of '97. He
is a corporate development analyst at Lattice Semiconductor Corp. in Portland, Ore.
One of the hardest things about living in a new city is meeting new people. It
took both of them more than a month to find a new group of friends.
"At school, it was always fun to be able to walk outside the door and have
someone around to talk to. In the city, there aren't a lot of friends in a close
radius," said Mulder.
Both men live alone right now, but Mulder is moving in with a roommate soon,
because he said it's more fun.
It has also been difficult to keep up with what events are going on. "In school,
everything is right there. Now, you have to keep your eyes and ears open for
events," said Mulder.
For Cardenas, working has been a lot of fun. It's less stressful than school
because he can work at his own pace. He said the working environment is similar to
school.
"The atmosphere at work is very similar to Stanford in that it's very academic,"
said Cardenas. He works with senior economists, some of whom are economics
professors from Berkeley. "It's a lot like being in school and having professors
teach you economics theories."

Recently, Laura Tyson, former economics advisor for President Clinton joined
the firm.
Mulder felt, however, that work was more demanding than school. "At school,
you can get by sometimes without doing your best. At work, you can't do that,
everything has to be 100 percent right."
Although both men felt that the classes they took at Stanford prepared them
well for work, there was still a steep learning curve at the beginning.
"There's a lot to be said about experience. You may be highly educated
coming in, but you're still basically stupid," said Mulder.
Since working, both men have found there to be more time to explore the
things that interest them.
"There's a lot to do at Stanford, but there's not much time to do it," said
CtA. school, it was always fun to be able to walk outside the
door and have someone around to talk to. In the city, there aren't
a lot of friends in a close radius. 11

Cardenas.
Mulder agrees. "In school, there's always something over your head, whether
it's a midterm or a paper. Now weekends are real weekends, you can go do
whatever you want."
Cardenas has taken up wind surfing and piano lessons since starting work,
while Jack is taking a French class at night.
When asked if he missed Stanford, Mulder responded: "I miss having people
around. I miss my friends, especially friends who are still there."
Cardenas doesn't miss Stanford too much. "I had a lot of fun at Stanford, but
I'm having more fun now. Everywhere I go I have fun. Stanford is part of the past.'
And what about food? How do they like cooking for themselves? Mulder, a
recent resident of Roble Hall summed it up by saying, "As bad as Roble is, as least
you don't have to cook." Whenever possible, Mulder tries to visit his friends
during dinner time.
