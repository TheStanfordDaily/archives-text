CPPC SERVICES

time, permanent positions for graduating students.
There are many job opportunities in the fields of
engineering, investment banking and consulting.
■ ESTABLISH A REFERENCE FILE consisting of a
resume and letters of reference as seniors, graduate
students and I or alumni. A copy of your file will be
mailed to a prospective employer or to a graduate
school at your request.
■ CAREER FAIRS are intended to provide general
career information, help you develop contacts and
perhaps find an internship, summer or full-time job.
The three scheduled fairs are; the Stanford Career
Fair, the Public Service Career and Internship Fair,
and Job Connection Day.
■ WORKSHOPS cover more than a dozen topics, rang
ing from "Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Introduction,"
to 'Interviewing Strategies," to "Is This Job for You?
Evaluating Organizations and Negotiating Offers."
■ THE LIBRARY includes books, directories, periodi
cals and handouts covering every area of career
planning and the job search. The library also houses
a media room; the Rainbow File with information on
more than 700 nonprofit and public organizations;
multicultural resources; an alumni contact service; an
alumni mentor program; and a career shadow pro
gram.

"So, what are you doing after graduation?" begins
the barrage of questions. There is a bit of squirming
and hedging involved as the respondent tries to sound
calm, collected and in control of the

future.
Whether you are looking for a
summer internship, part-time work
experience or your first full-time job,
now is the time to visit the Career
Planning and Placement Center. A
common misconception among stu
dents is that the CPPC's sole purpose is
to list job openings and organize on
campus recruiting; in fact, for every
level of career development, the CPPC
has an array of resources to help guide
your search.
Still feel lost?
"Some students think they need to
come in with a clear plan in mind and a
resume — but they don't," said Lynne
H. Dotson, former acting director of the
CPPC.
A major role of the CPPC is to help
students with career planning.
One of the most important things
students can do is "answering the
question, 'Who am I?' " Dotson said.

"Even the students who think they
know what they want... need to know first who they
are."
The CPPC suggests a six-step strategy for career
planning beginning with the basics: 1) Know yourself;
2) Research what's out there; 3) Develop and focus
objectives; 4) Create a marketable profile;
5) Strategize the job search; and finally, 6) Pulverize
the long-awaited interview.
Resources that have proven useful to students are
abundant. The most widely read materials are the job
strategy handouts — growing off the flier-tree in the
CPPC — which offer tips on such topics as writing
resumes, networking and planning careers in areas like
the international or the public service sector.
Other services target a more specialized niche: the
organization of on-campus recruiting sessions, for
example. However, these activities can be a distraction

C {You don't stop
to think that there
are other avenues
to finding what you
want to do. (On
campus recruiting)
is a safe option,
(but) people should
look around more
on their own.
— Aaron Hallmark
Class of 1995

to those who arc still defining their personal goals.
"If you don't really know exactly what you want,
[the on-campus recruiting process] can psych you out,

and you end up following the pack
and getting caught up in the competi
tion," said Aaron Hallmark, Class of
'95.
Although Hallmark did find a job
through on-campus recruiting, he
wishes, in retrosect, that he had done
more exploring during his job search.
"You don't stop to think that
there are other avenues to finding
what you want to do," Hallmark said.
"(On-campus recruiting) is a safe
option, (but) people should look
around more on their own."
Going for the "safe option" has
deterred many students from using
less structured resources, such as
alumni contacts, which rely more on
student initiative, Dotson said.
"I think it's helpful to be open to
insecurity, to give yourself some
breathing room and be open to
different opportunities," said Jennifer
James, Class of '96.
James agreed that taking some
risks could lead to more creative ends.

Students who arc curious but not quite ready for
an overwhelming, formal job search can stop by the
CPPC for a brief tour from a staff member or student
peer counselor.
