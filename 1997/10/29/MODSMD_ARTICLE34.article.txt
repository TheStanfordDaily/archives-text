# The 						Medical School Application
## CRUNCH 
### Story by SHEENIE AMBARDAR 
Each year, at around this time,
legions of Stanford seniors can
be seen scampering around the

country, running the gauntlet from one
stress-filled medical school interview to
the next.
Ever-so-tastefully draped in their conservative blues and greys, they

are eager and ready to enter the deliriously fast-paced world of

medical school, provided the admissions committees will

let them.
These fortunate few have almost come full
circle in their quest: they've survived

Stanford's pre-med curriculum, taken the
MCATs, successfully completed towering
stacks of applications and are now in limbo
mode, watching and waiting for the brass
ring to come their way.
But what exactly is the brass ring like,
and will it fit once it is theirs?
According to Pei-Ran Ho, a fourth year
student at Stanford Medical School, many
would-be physicians don't really know what
medicine entails.

"They think, oh yeah, medicine is rad, and
sure, everything in theory is cool, but once you
actually see for yourself what goes on, it's a real
eye opener," said Ho.
Ho says it took him until his second year to
come to a very important realization, "In medi
cine, you don't just deal with people, you deal
with very, very sick people. You have to learn

how to be sensitive to patients' needs; you can't just walk up to a patient and ask,
how are you? Obviously, if they're in the hospital, they're sick as shit. It's a totally
different dynamic."
Another realization that came to Ho early on was the fact that, as a doctor, one
may not want to help all people at all times. He tells of an incident in the emergency
room, when two people were brought in from a car accident. One patient was a
drunk driver and the other was his 35-year old victim, a lady on her way to Bible
study. The lady ended up dying, but the drunk driver survived. "I had low motiva
tion to be nice to this guy, but I went through the motions. 1 didn't feel as neutral as
1 should have."
It is this sort of exposure to different types of people that has sped up Ho's
learning process. He advises aspiring doctors to "go out and interact with people.
Meet racist people, meet rich people, meet poor people, meet snobbish people.
Looking back on my undergraduate years at Stanford, I don't remember calculus,
CIV or Chem 31, but I remember the lessons I learned from people." He urges
undergraduates to "go to Screw Your Roommate and learn how to deal with a
complete stranger for five hours, go to frat parties. Now, when I walk into a hospital

room, patients put a lot of faith in me, 1 can tell
that they trust me; it's because I've learned how
to deal with people."

Another Stanford graduate, Belinda Fu,
now a second-year student at the Univer
sity of California at San Fransisco, relates
similar stories about the difficulty of

having to deal with different types of
people. She is currently doing a
preceptorship in the Department of Public

Health and comes across HIV infected

patients on a daily basis. "Coming from

Stanford, 1 wasn't prepared for this.
I'm not used to working with such

underprivileged people. It's been

intimidating. It's really sad to hear their

stories and to see how terribly ill they are

It's hard to know what your role as a doctor is.

Are we here just to cure physical sickness, or

should we do more?"
In addition to sorting out the psychologi
cal and emotional stresses of medical school,
students must learn to handle the hack-hreaking
academic demands.
Ho compares medical school to walking around

the world: "it's not necessarily hard, I mean, walking
itself isn't hard, hut it's long and tedious, you have to
do it day after day."
He warns that the first two years of medical

school involve learning facts, plain and simple. "You
don't really think like a doctor. It's just a lot of
memorization. Only later to do you start learning about
the actual art of medicine."
Fu stresses that the studying process itself carries
with it a burden of responsibilty. "When you're inun-

dated with a lot of material, it's very tempting to just
blow it off. But then you remember that this information

is really important — it's not just a bunch of facts, you're going to he using this to
take care of people later on."
According to both Ho and Fu, medical school is more difficult than under
graduate study, hut it is also more enjoyahle. In Fu's words, "as an undergrad, you
were studying just to become a doctor. Now you're studying so that you can heal."
When you're inundated with a lot of material, it's very tempt
ing to just blow it off. But then you remember that this information
is really important — it's not just a bunch of facts, you're going to
be using this to take care of people later on.
