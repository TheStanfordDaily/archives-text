# MAKING AN IMPRESSION
## Writings perfect resume.

It's the first step to the rest of your life, and you want to make it a good one.
Career couselor Veda Jeffries gives tips for getting started in ...

You have 93.5 square inches that must simultaneously
serve as an autobiography, a writing sample and a sales
pitch. You have to adhere to a common format, but you
also have to express your creativity.
Writing a resume is intimidating. After all, together
withyour cover letter, your resume will play a large part
in answering the paramount question of your post-
Stanford existence — known in business circles as the
McKinsey-McDonald's tossup.
"Your resume and your cover letter — that is your first
contact, your first impression," said Veda Jeffries, a career
counselor at the Career Planning and Placement Center.
"That is what is going to get you your first interview."
You can still put together an impressive resume even if you
haven't had much formal work

LJefore preparing a resume,
you should make a list of
all your employment,
academic or extracurricular
experiences, no matter how
irrelevant they may seem.

experience, Jeffries said.
"Students have a tendency to leave
out really important things because
they feel, 'Oh, this is not really
important,' or This is not a really
status kind of position,' This is not a
professional kind of thing,"' she said.
"This is not what employers are
looking for. Employers are looking
for the skills that you've developed."
Before preparing a resume, Jeffries
said, you should make a list of all your
employment, academic or extracur
ricular experiences, no matter how

irrelevant they may seem.
Some of these may unexpectedly turn out to he extremely
marketable resume items.
Group projects often show teamwork skills, and work in
extracurricular organizations can show leadership skills.
Overseas experience can show independence.
Perhaps the most important part of writing a resume is
maintaining coherent organization and presenting information
in a manner that is both visually appealing and easy to follow.
For most students just leaving school, Jeffries said, a
chronological format — that is. listing qualifications in order,
with the most recent first — is better than a functional format
grouping qualifications into different skill areas.
"Usually, a person with a functional resume has been out
of the job market for a while," she said.
As you list your qualifications, take advantage of boldface
type, capitalization, bullets and white space to separate and

highlight different elements and ideas. Keep the writing style
clear, concise and smooth and use vivid verbs in the active
voice to describe your experience.
Including some details about your experience can certainly
help, but it is more important to ensure that your resume gets
your main qualifications across quickly and effectively.
"Employers usually spend two or three minutes reading a
resume," Jeffries said. "They want to see what your skills are
— are your skills relevant to what they're looking for — and
to see what you have that's marketable and would make you a
good employee."
Your resume should be laser-printed on high-quality
resume paper in an easy-to-read font. An increasing number
of companies are now scanning resumes electronically,
Jeffries said. She pointed to a news report that said 75 percent
of Fortune 500 companies do at least some computer resume
scanning.
As electronic scanning grows more widespread, Jeffries
said, resume writers should be more wary of using graphical
objects, unusual symbols, dingbats, horizontal rules and
italicized and underlined text — elements that may snarl
equipment.
Jeffries recommends that most job-seekers keep their
resumes down to a page or less for most purposes. However,
Ph.D. graduates' resumes might spill over a second page, she
said.

Certain things should not he placed on a
resume, Jeffries said. She recommends leaving
out irrelevant characteristics like age, sex or
religion,
"You don't want to show any kind of infer
ence that could cause some kind of discrimina
tion," she explained.
Placing a statement of your employment
objective near the top of your resume is optional,
Jeffries said.
Jeffries also recommends leaving references
oil a resume. The names of specific co-workers
or supervisors should be omitted unless they are
nationally recognized figures.
Above all, you should make your resume an
accurate representation of yourself, one that you
are comfortable and familiar with, because when
it's all said and done, it's you who has to go to
that job every day. And your resume — it's just a
piece of paper.

the. DOs A DONTs

DO use a clear, readable font, keeping in mind that
© your resume may ho electronically scanned. Times or
Palatino work well. Bitmapped fonts, even if scanned
successfully, are generally not attractive to employers.
DON'T use strange symbols or dingbats. Once again,
your resume will be scanned. Graphic elements of any
sort are also a bad idea.
DO use clear, vivid language in the active voice. Be as
© concise as possible. Remember that potential employ
ers generally spend two to three minutes on each
rgsumg they read.
DON'T include the names of individual co-workers or
employers, unless these individuals were nationally
recognized figures.
DON'T allow spelling or grammatical errors to slip by
'" in your resume.
DON'T claim any false or exaggerated qualifications,
such as work done at a very young age. Additionally, ©
avoid vague or nondescripttve language or job titles
without some sort of description.
DON'T include references in your resume. It is genet
ally a better idea to state on your cover letter that
references may be furnished upon request.
DO include qualifications like language and computer
skills. Be specific with this information, such as what
programs you are proficient in.
n% DON'T include any irrelevant information which might
lead to discrimination, such as age, race or religion.
