# SURVIVING THE INTERVIEW
## 
### Story by RAJIV CHANDRASEKARAN 
It's the crucial factor in the world of employment and strikes
fear into potential employees.

Three years of resume packing. Three weeks of shopping for the perfect suit.
Three days of agonizing over your resume: Palatino or Times?
Three hours of combing your hair.
And it all comes down to the next 15 minutes.
Sure, going to all those get-acquainted-with-the-CPPC workshops was time
consuming, getting the Mac in your computer cluster to properly format your resume
made you scream and receiving one of those oh-so-tiny rejection postcards felt worse
than bombing a final.
Hut, according to those who have gone career-hunting, the interview is undoubtedly

the most harrowing experience along the path to a $40,0()()-a-year, BMW-in-the
garage, I-got-the-best-job-among-my-friends existence.
It's also the most important, they say.

"A resume and cover letter (are) simply a way to get an interview. The
interview really decides whether or not you get the job," said Kathy
Campbell of the Career Planning and Placement Center. "If you don't
come across well in an interview, you don't get the job."
To be more than just another name in a thick stack of resumes, you
must leave a strong — positive — impression with the interviewer. That
sort of "success" isn't hard, say career counselors. The key, they maintain,
is preparation.
"Before you go into an interview —just like an exam — do your
homework," said Campbell. "An interview is not the time to learn about an

organization."
She advises interviewees to research three important areas:
• Themselves. Job hunters should sit down and think about their skills, occupations
that interest them, what they do well and what they have to offer an employer, among
other topics.
"When people ask you a question about yourself, it shouldn't appear like you've
never thought about it," said Campbell.
• The occupation. "Know about the field you want to go into," said Campbell.
"What is a typical day like? What skills are needed?"
She advises interviewees to contact Stanford graduates for a real-life perspective on
potential careers. The CPPC and Bowman Alumni House have binders with alumni
contact numbers that are available for students to browse through.
The CPPC also has books, pamphlets and other information on a variety of careers.
• The employer. Career counselors suggest job hunters familiarize themselves with
a corporation before the interviewing process. "The employer wants to think you want
to work for them," said Campbell. "If they leave literature (at the CPPC), read it."
Recommended reading includes annual reports, informational brochures and news
articles about new products or large changes in the company. The CPPC keeps some
information on file, but Campbell recommends a trip to the library at the Graduate
School of Business. The library's Rosenberg Collection has information regarding a
myriad of companies, including articles and annual reports, on CD-ROM.
Although this research process is often tedious and seemingly useless, career
counselors and those on the other side of the table —job interviewers — strongly
recommend it.
"Preparation is the biggest thing," said Greg Paquin, a senior employment consult
ant with Apple Computer's research and development group. "You don't have to read
401-Ks, but you should know the basic information."
That knowledge, Paquin said, will be helpful when the interviewer asks that one,
fateful question: "So, do you have any questions for me?"
Although Paquin said interviewees don't always have to have them, doing your
homework is the best way to formulate insightful questions about a company.
"Some take the shortcut approach and interview with lots of companies without
doing the research," Campbell said. "Those are the folks who paste their doors with
rejection letters."
In addition to knowing about the company, CPPC advisers say interviewees should

expect some of the classic questions, in particular:
• What are your long-range career plans?
• Why did you choose to go to Stanford?
• How did you choose your major?
• What does it take to be successful in this business?
• Why did you apply to this company?
Don't just give extemporaneous answers, the counselors say, but instead, think
about each question carefully both before and during the interview. Interrogate yourself
and form concrete responses.
And always be ready for that where-do-l-start, please-help-me-out question: "Tell
me a little about yourself."
Paquin says it's natural to feel a sense of confusion if you're asked a question like
that. He suggests asking the interviewer to narrow the focus, asking him, for example, if
he wants to know about your honors thesis. "You should feel comfortable to ask
questions to set the interviewer's focus."
When responding to questions, interviewees should always follow "yes" or "no"
responses with descriptive and explanatory remarks.
According to Campbell, a greater number of employers are currently emphasizing
"behavioral questions," which require a little more thought and care on the part of the
interviewee.
"Employers are finding out that the past is the best predictor of future behavior,"
she said. "Often they will ask questions that will force you to draw upon experiences
from your past."
Campbell also warns students not to forget the basics: practice before the big day
and dress appropriately.
She also suggests interviewing either early or late in the day, but never right before
or after lunch.
Additionally, if the interview suddenly gets tense or you begin to feel like you're
bombing, a little humor can go a long way, says Paquin. "If you can laugh at yourself,
it's a wonderful way to deflect tension."
Finally, despite all the advice and preparation an interviewee may have, Campbell
and Paquin say honesty is the key to a successful interview. Interviewees should not try
to tailor their answers to what Apple or Microsoft or IBM want to hear.
