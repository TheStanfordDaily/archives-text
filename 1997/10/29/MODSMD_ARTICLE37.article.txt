# Graduates flock to Peace Corps
## Founded by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, Peace Corps attracts 1,240 Stanford graduates 
### Story by MOLLY MASLAND 
In Cabanas, a cool, mountain
village in western Honduras,
Peace Corps volunteer Tania
. Butkovic spent two years
training midwives in modern birthing
techniques and set up a clinic for
pregnant rural women.
Surrounded by coffee plantations
and jungle, Cabanas is a remote

community, yet for Butkovic, class of
'94, the hardships of isolation amounted to
little in comparison to the personal
rewards she gained.

Although her experience was unique,
Butkovic is representative of more than
1,000 Stanford graduates who have
enrolled in the Peace Corps during the
program's 36-year history.
In a letter to Stanford President
Gerhard Casper, Peace Corps Director
Mark Gearan announced this week that

Stanford ranks 10th among all colleges and

universities in producing Peace Corps
volunteers.
"Throughout its history, the Peaoe
Corps can trace much of its success to
the energy and idealism of American
college students," Gearan wrote in his
letter. "These colleges and universities

are to be commended for producing students
committed to making a difference, with a thirst for adventure, and with the desire to
experience a new culture in an ever-changing world."
Since the Peace Corps was founded in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy,
1,240 Stanford graduates have joined the program. UC-Berkeley tops the list with
2,%() graduates, followed closely by the University of Wisconsin, the University of
Washington and Harvard University.
According to Peace Corps Regional Director Maryann Murray, "For most
volunteers, the Peace Corps is a turning point in their lives. It is the start of a whole
new way of looking at the world."
Currently there are 6,500 Peace Corps volunteers serving in 87 countries,
primarily in Africa, the former Soviet Union, Latin America, Southeast Asia and
the South Pacific. Jordan and South Africa are the most recent countries to be added

to the program's area of service.
Most volunteers work in the fields of education, health care, environmental

protection and business development.
According to Murray, no previous language skills
are necessary to join the Peace Corps, although a
knowledge of French or Spanish is helpful. Degrees in
English or science-related fields are most desirable, as
is tutoring experience.
All housing, food, transportation and medical
costs are covered by the program. Volunteers also
receive an ample monthly stipend as well as $5,400
upon completion of the two-year assignment. In
addition, Perkins loans are reduced 15 percent for each
year of service and most other loans can be deferred.
For Butkovic, who graduated with a bachelor's
in human biology and is fluent in Spanish, the assign
ment in Honduras was ideal.
Living in a small room rented from the mayor's
office, she had her own latrine and took bucket baths.

"It sounds totally foreign here but it was really not that hard to get used to,"
she said.
One of the most challenging aspects of her assignment was overcoming
resistance to modern medical practices among the local women and convincing
them to use the maternity clinic she helped set up.
"Women there are used to giving birth at home in the dark with their
husband and children around," she said. "The idea of going somewhere else to give
birth was very strange, even if it meant less risk."
After recently finishing her two-year position, Butkovic went back home to
Fresno, Calif., where she is busy applying to medical schools. She credits the Peace
Corps and her experience in Honduras with helping inspire her to pursue a career in
medicine.
"I don't feel like my work dramatically changed the world but on a per
sonal level I really affected people's lives and they affected mine," she said. "It was
very hard to come home."
According to Murray, fall is the best time to apply to the Peace Corps
program since the application process takes six to nine months to complete.
"I would encourage anyone to join," said Butkovic, "and there's no better
time than when you're right out of college."

it I don't feel like my work dramatically
changed the world, but on a personal
level I really affected people's lives, and
they affected mine. JJ
