They still haven't found what they're
looking for. Without a definite purpose
or set goal, Stanford students
approaching graduation deal with the
problems of indecision.

A|re you feeling fuzzy about
what to do after Stanford?
Well, for many students, if
computer programming or medical

school doesn't seem appealing — or real
istic — life after Stanford is a big question
mark.

Senior Natalie Vaccarezza had plenty of trouble deciding on a major, let alone
her career. "1 really didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew I liked writing
and reading a lot." As a result, she became an English major.
Before the Career Fair in November, Vaccarezza was thrilled with her choice.

American studies
major Kim Griffin
and sociology
major Kelly
Richardson will
choose travel as an
alternative to
immediately enter
ing the work force
after graduating.

"1 was thinking I love my major. I'm so glad 1
chose this. Why isn't everyone an English major?"
Soon, once those tables filled with employers
came to Stanford, she realized why everyone else
hadn't become an English major.

While lots of employers were looking for
people of any major, prospects for computer
science majors seemed a lot brighter.
At first, Vaccarezza felt discouraged.
Then, she realized that "the jobs they wanted
those people for 1 wouldn't want anyway."

The big question for Vaccarezza, who will be
graduating at the end of this year, is "What's next?"
"I'm just going to keep on going to senior pub
nights and enjoy my last year. I'm young, I have
no dependents, if there's a time to take a risk, it's
now."
Kim Giffin, an Ameriean studies major, and
Kelly Richardson, a sociology major, both seniors,
are two women who would agree with Vaccarezza

on the idea of taking a risk. After graduation.
Griffin, Richardson and their friend Robin Davidson are planning to travel to 48
states, Canada, Mexico and eventually end their trip in Eureka., Calif.
Basically, said Griffin. "We all wanted to see Mt. Rushmore."
Figuring that they didn't have to pay off their student loans until 6 months after
graduation, exploring the world seemed like a logical next step before joining the

work force.
"You don't have responsibilities, husbands or children," said Griffin.
"The whole road trip thing came about a few weeks ago, when Robin, Griffin,
and 1 were sitting in my room talking about how we don't want to have to get office
jobs and go straight to work after we graduate." said Richardson. "My parents
think we're a little crazy, but they thought that before."
Ben Decker, a co terminal in economics and sociology, is taking the traveling
bit one step further. Originally, he planned to join a consulting firm.
"My father told me that was a stupid idea." said Decker.
Now, a world-wide trip seems to be in order.
"We know some guys in Guatemala," so Latin America will be the first stop.
Then, he's planning to visit the Mediterranean Sea. Afterward, he wants to go to
India and hike in the Himalayas. Finally, Decker said, his trip will end in Southeast
Asia.
With a little planning, even Fuzzy majors can have a world full of excitement.

They still haven't found what they're
looking for. Without a definite purpose
or set goal, Stanford students
