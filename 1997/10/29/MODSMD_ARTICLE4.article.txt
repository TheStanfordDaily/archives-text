### Saurabh Prakash Contributing writer 
Last night the ASS IJ Senate for
mally inducted 10 freshmen into the
senate as part of the newly estab
lished Freshman Senators program.
The senators were carefully cho
sen from an initial applicant pool ol
more than 140 freshmen. With the
exception of the right to vote, the
freshmen will share with their elect
ed colleagues many of the same
privileges and responsibilities in
cluding attendance at senate meet
ings and participation in floor de
hates.
"The freshmen senators are part
of the ASSI I effort to reach out and
five freshmen the opportunity to
bring their ideas into student gov :
eminent," said Senate Deputy
C hair Matt Spence, a sophomore.
'Those who were selected have

shown themselves to be extremely
knowledgeable and committed."
Within one week of being in
formed of their iippointments, the
freshmen senators have already ini
tiated several projects that they will
implement over the year.
()ne of these is a newsletter that
would distribute to students infor
mation about the ASSI J's goals and
accomplishments. Another is a
dorm outreach program which
would make senators available at
house meetings and dinners to dis
cuss student concerns and explain
ASSI J projects.
The Freshman Senators pro
gram is part of a concerted effort by
this year's ASSI I leadership to in
volve freshmen in student govern
ment^
"Our goals are to draw enthusi
astic, extremely qualified people
and bring them into the ASSU
while they are still enthusiastic and
help show them how the senate
works," Spence said.
In another bill, the senate ap
proved appropriation of more than
$30,000 to dozens of campus stu
dent groups this quarter. The funds
were disbursed by the Program
Board and the Community Service
Board, two boards that received
funding through general fees to dis
tribute funds to student groups.
Dean of Students Marc Wais was
also present at the senate session,
where he clarified the constitutional
status of the Greek Housing Task

Force.
The ASSU last week harshly
condemned the University for ap
pointing students without going
through the ASSU's Nominations
Committee. The ASSU contends
the University violated the constitu
tion.
Wais clarified that "the nomina
tions committee has the right to re
cruit, select and approve students to
be on University committees," but
the Task Force is not such a com
mittee.
The University, contended
Wais, tried nevertheless to ensure
student voice was represented.
" There were more students than
staff." Wais said. All the students on
the committee are members of fra
ternities or sororities.
