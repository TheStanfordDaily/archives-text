## 
### Sasha Polonsky 
The Big Game centennial poster,
designed by sophomore Drue Katao
ka, signals an innovative celebration
of bridging the arts and the world of
sports as it commemorates KM) years
of Big Game history.
On Monday Kataoka met with
football coach Tyrone Willingham to
symbolically merge the artistry and
athletics portrayed in the poster, as
they each signed copies of the Big
Game commemorative.
Kataoka crafted a design that re
lates the rich history of the Stanford-
Gal rivalry. The focus of the painting
is a kicker, poised on the Axe. repre
senting the anticipation of Big Game
ashe hangs in balance of both Hoover
Tower and IJC-Berkeley's Cam
panile.
The posters unique quality repre
sents a significant departure from
previous years' designs â€” it shows off
the elegance and style of sumi-e. an
ancient Japanese art form.
"It's about capturing the essence
of your subject." Kataoka said about
the passion she has pursued since the
age of five. "On this poster. c< ncen
tration. dedication and skill . c the
same things that go into sports.'
Kataoka. having received her han,
the stamp of the professional sumi-e
artist, has revolutionized the tech
nique of suini-e so as to demonstrate
the correlation between athletics and
art.
Sumi-e is an ancient traditional art
form, completely derived from living
material. The artist uses rice paper, a
bamboo brush with hair from a deer,
badger, horse or sheep, and the sub
ject matter has in tradition always fea
tured scenes from nature.

A musician as well as an artist,
Kataoka adapted her style after
performing on the flute with the
Kent Jordan Ouartet at the New
Orleans Jazz Heritage Festival. At
the age of 17. she realized the rela
tionship between her music and her
paintings.
Jazz and sumi-e both share ele
ments of improvisation, both take
enormous dedication, skill and disci
pline. and both exhibit similar move
ment and character. Kataoka said.
"In sumi-e these kinds of things
have never been captured before, but
it is very appropriate," Kataoka said
of her style. "It's a perfect match
taking an art form of 2(XX) years. rich
with tradition, and creating a new way
of seeing it."
The Athletics Department has en
couraged Kataoka's progress, specifi
cally in her athletic subject matter.
Exhibits in both the Arrillaga Family
Sports Center and the l aube Family
Tennis Stadium, titled "Explosive
Movement" and "Winning Strokes"
respectively, feature Kataoka's study
in athletic artistry.
"I continue to be impressed with
her energy, enthusiasm and ability."
s:>id Dick Gould, the men's tennis
coach, who discovered Kataoka's
work before she came to Stanford.
"Her work is very graceful, and the
How really docs lend itself toward ac
tion."
The Athletics Department
prompted the commission of Katao
ka's commemorative poster, titled
"Kickoff 100."
The creation of the poster in
volved field work as well as analysis
and interpretation. Kataoka spent
this fall on the sidelines, sketching
athletes as they charged into the end

zone. "They just told me to move out
of the way when [the players] came,"
she said.
The sketches in her studio accu
mulated and became inspiration for
the painting. Kataoka also met and
talked with several football players to
be sure she was accurately portraying
the essence of the sport in her paint
ing.
In addition. Kataoka spent several
weeks studying anil analyzing Big
Game programs dating back to
"I really wanted to look at the history
[of posters]," Kataoka said other de
sign process.
"I figured it should capture the tra
dition of the past as well asa kickoff to
the future the next UK) years." she
added, acknowledging the l(X)th year
as a pivotal and peak moment in Big
(iame history.
Kataoka noticed an interesting
trend in previous programs - in
some original versions, women were
pictured cheering, but suddenly they
disappeared as the posters pro
gressed. "1 feel it's very appropriate
that now in the -I XK. for the MXlth
game, a woman artist is being fea
tured," she said.
"Kickoff MX)" features a black
and-white kicker balancing on the red
Axe. framed between the Hoover
Tower and Berkeley's Campanile.
The athlete's arms are balanced like
ancient (ireek scales, offering a clas
sical feel and hinting at the C ireek
synthesis of art and athletics.
The uniform as well represents a
merge of new and old: the player's
pants are new and tight-fitting and his
front leg has a modern shoe, in con
trast with the old leather helmet and
back leg dressed in an earlier shoe.
The black-and-white design is es

peciallv defining this use is unusu
al and atypical, according to Kataoka.
"('olor would make it less powerful,"
she said, as the black-and-white rep
resents a polarization of the Bay Area
fans.
"The poster's uniqueness speaks
to the fundamentals and foundations
of the universities." Willingham said
of the adapted sumi-e technique.
The poster "adds another dimen

sion to the diversity of the history of
Big( iame," Willingham said. "It real
ly commemorates the many changes
over the past 100 years at both uni
versities."
Kataoka's work with Stanlord
athletics will continue beyond the
realm of Big Game. The Athletics
Department has commissioned her
to create an IK-by-14 foot
panoramic of Stanford athletics to

he kept on permanent display m
Arrillaga.
Like many other Stanford stu
dents, Kataoka admits tliiit she is
"caught up in the spirit, (lie excite
ment and the pride'" associated with
Big (iame. Indeed, students at both
Stanford and UC-Berkeley, much
like the kicker standing on the axe,
now wait in anxious anticipation of
the imminent "Kickoff MX)."
