### 
WASHINGTON (AF) In a
low-key opening to a splashy state
visit. President Clinton invited
Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
the White House yesterday night
as Washington and Beijing stood
on the verge of ending eight years
of diplomatic estrangement.
Clinton wanted to gieet Jiang
in the relaxed setting of'the White
House residence to review the
agenda for today's summit and
begin discussions, officials said.
Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright promised the talks would

be "candid and comprehensive."
Outside, Jiang's visit
promised to bring out one of the
capital's biggest demonstrations
against a foreign leader, uniting
critics on the left and the light
against ( liina's policies on abor
tion. human rights, religious
freedom, arms sales, trade. Tibet
and l aiwan. A huge demonstia
tion was planned today in
I afnyette Park.
Thirtx protesters stood on a
street corner and yelled "I ree
I ibet Now " and "Long Live the

Dalai Lama" as Jiang's 20-car
motorcade arrived. The Chinese
leader ignored shouted questions
about human rights.
A metal fence stretching across
Pennsylvania Ave. kept demon
strators from getting close.
Albright said meeting with
Jiang would not weaken U.S. crit
icism.
"Let me stress that in our rela
tions with China, engagement is
not the same as endorsement,"
Albiight told a State Department
news conference.
