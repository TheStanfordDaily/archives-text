Manager David Longbine said Crate & Barrel
was chosen to fill the vacancy because the compa-

Ny has "the best furniture around."
It took two years for the management compa
ny to reach an agreement with Crate & Barrel.
"We were after them," Longbine said.
Founded in 1962 as a kitchenware store by
Gordon and Carole Segal, Crate & Barrel grew
from a one-story, three-person operation into a
72-store chain.
The name of the company came out of the
Segals' decision to sell directly out of the crates and
barrels in which their merchandise was shipped. In
1973, the company entered the catalog business,
which is now a thriving $21-million venture.

The store is a two-story building with a curved
wall topped by a translucent glass tower. Several
deep-set windows bring in ample light.
Sharing its space with the Andronico's
gourmet grocery store, the first floor stocks all of
the housewares. The second floor accommodates
the entire furniture collection.
A preview party was held Tuesday evening to
benefit the Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hos
pital.
The store is open Monday through Friday from
10 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
