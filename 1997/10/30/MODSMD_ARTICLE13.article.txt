Weapons inspection disputed
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Iraq delivered a new
challenge to the United States yesterday, barring
Americans from the U.N. disarmament effort in Iraq
— a move that outraged the chief weapons inspector
and prompted him to suspend inspections.
The 10 American weapons inspectors — who are
among 40 inspectors now in Iraq — are being told to
leave within a week. Iraq also asked the United
Nations to stop using U.S. reconnaissance planes to
monitor Iraqi compliance in eliminating the
weapons.
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Ameri
cans must not participate in the inspections "until
America reconsiders its oppressive policy and its
aggressive behavior to the people of Iraq, and its pol
icy of espionage and intervention."
The United States and Britain, allied against Iraq
during the IWI Persian Gulf War and afterward in
insisting that Baghdad destroy its weapons of mass
destruction, were outraged. I*he Australian chief
inspector said U.N. employees would continue office
work but conduct no field operations.
"I'm not prepared to have this work continue on the

basis that Iraq can say to us which person from which
country is or isn't acceptable," Richard Butler said.
Butler also shelved plans to visit Baghdad on Nov.
7. He was to have been accompanied by the Special
Commission's deputy chairman, American Charles
Duefler.
The inspectors are trying to determine whether
Iraq has complied with IJ.N. orders to dismantle all
long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction,
a condition for ending crippling economic sanctions.
The Security Council has said it will lift the sanctions,
imposed after Iraq's 19W invasion of Kuwait, only
after inspectors certify full compliance.
White House spokeswoman Ann Luzatto called
the Iraqi demands "unacceptable."
Iraq's actions have "potentially grave conse
quences," Rubin said, without elaborating.
The U.S. aircraft carrier Nimitz is in the Persian
Gulf, rushing over earlier this month amid heighten
ing tensions after Iranian and Iraqi planes violated
the no-fly zone imposed at the end of the war
The Iraqi statement, however, does not appear to
be a fresh rejection of the zone, patrolled by the
United States and its allies. U.S. planes also provide
aerial photos to U.N. weapons inspectors.
