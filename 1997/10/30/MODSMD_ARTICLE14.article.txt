# U.S. and China: still at odds
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a state visit exposing
deep fault lines between Aineriea and China, President
Clinton and President Jiang Zemin spaned publicly
yesterday over human rights and the Tiananmen
Square massacre. They agreed, nonetheless, the long
diplomatic chill between the nations must end.
And on a day of blunt talk, they did precisely that.
I"he leaders found common ground in a $3 billion air
plane sale to China and Jiang's word that Beijing would
not help nations that covet nuclear weapons.
But it was their extraordinary public exchange over
fundamental differences that framed the one-day sum
mit.
Clinton said the United States and China have "pro
found disagreements" and that Beijing was "on the
wrong side of history" about Tiananmen Square. Jiang
defended the bloody crackdown as the "correct conclu
sion" by the government. And he insisted that China's
human rights policies were a matter in which other
nations should not interfere.
At a news conference both leaders stood their
ground, jumping in after each other to state their dis
agreements. Clinton and Jiang were at turns impassive,
grim, and awkwardly smiling.
As Jiang returned again and again to his standard
responses on human rights — reading prepared

answers at times — Clinton appeared more distracted,
fidgeting with his water glass, gripping the lectern with
both hands and closing his eyes briefly.
Aides said later Clinton was frustrated with Jiang's
unyielding stand. He knew the Chinese leader would
not backpedal on his positions during the visit, but he
expected a "far less brazen approach," said one senior
official.
In the end, the leaders shook hands, smiled and
Clinton put his arm at Jiang's back to escort him from
the room.
Outside the White House, more than I,(XX) demon
strators roared in protest as Clinton welcomed Jiang for
the first Chinese state visit in 12 years. The 71-year-old
Jiang was greeted with herald trumpets, a brass band
and a 21-gun salute. More than 230 guests were invited
to an elegant state dinner in Jiang's honor featuring
chilled lobster and pepper crusted beef.
Amid their differences, Clinton and Jiang struck a
major agreement by which China agreed not to help
spread nuclear weapons to Iran, Pakistan or other
nations. Clinton's certification of China's cooperation
opened the way for American companies to sell billions
of dollars worth of nuclear power equipment to Beijing.
China also agreed to its biggest ever airline purchase
in a $3 billion deal with Boeing to buy 30 planes.
