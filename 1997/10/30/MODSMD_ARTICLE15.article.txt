Bookstore's system
smart for store, hut
lacks student focus

REBATE CHECKS ARE in. This
year's checks amounted to an 11-
perccnt rebate for students for pur
chases ol textbooks and course readers.
Students flocked to the desks in Irrmt of
the Stanford Bookstofe last week to Yeceivu
their much-awaited checks.
A one-year wait, to be specific. Each year.
Stanford students, faculty and staff must
save their receipts from the start of the
school year for submission in June.
This process is a cumbersome one that
subjects students to higher up-front costs for
books and course readers with the promise
of an unspecified refund when all the
accounts are tallied.
The Bookstore is one of the largest, most
comprehensive bookstores on any university
campus. It rivals local bookstores such as
Kepler's and Barnes and Noble in services
ranging from food to clothing to computer
sales to film processing. Plus, the building is
beautiful and well maintained.
However, the rebate system, while pru
dent for the Bookstore, creates inconve
niences for the Stanford community, which
the Bookstore ostensibly wishes to serve.
Shoppers realize that the prices the Book
store offers are higher that those they would
pay at other stores, but the Bookstore's loca
tion on campus and its role as the only major
vendor for textbooks fosters its perception as
a monopoly.
After all. what other business guarantees
itsel! sustainability through higher prices,
rather than tried-and true formulas for success,
good service, competitive prices and variety?
The rebate system offers the Bookstore
exactly that, a guarantee at the expense of

shoppers — that it will make money. The
selling point is that the Bookstore gives back
a portion o! its surplus after the money is col
lected.
This poses several problems:
First, students, faculty and staff are
charged with keeping track of several small
slips of paper for nine months. Receipts are
lost. Students leave mid-year, and some for
get to turn in their receipts.
Secondly, customers must fund the pro
duetion and labor costs of tallying rebate
• cheeks and getting them printetl and dis
tributed. K
Additionally, Bookstore shoppers must
pay sales tax on the mark-ups. They lose
interest on the money spent and. most
important, the value of the money — its
opportunity cost — is lost for that time.
These are not earth-shattering dilemmas,
simply ones that need not exist. In fact most
nonprofit college bookstores across the
nation do not have a rebate system. Cus
tomers prefer to pay a lower up front cost
than wait for unknown returns.
The B(X)kstore claims that the rebate sys
tem allows it to adjust for unpredictable sales
last year's sales were down 11 percent,
which are amplified by a lack of a preregistra
tion system to determine demand for classes
and textbooks. However, the Bookstore docs
maintain capital reserves and clearly has been
working to improve efficiency.
Despite sales that were down 11 percent,
the Bookstore was commendably able to
offer a rebate of 11 percent, its highest in
three years. This was accomplished by
"efforts to reduce employee and general
costs and to the reduction in long-term debt."
according to a Bookstore press release.
The Bookstore has build a substantial
surplus despite decreased sales. The Book
store should reconsider its rebate system and
take its recent financial accomplishments
and improvements as an indication that it
can function successfully without a buffer at
the expense of its customers.
