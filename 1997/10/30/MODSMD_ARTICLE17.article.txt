## Faster, pussycat, graduate, graduate! 
### 
WHEN I
decided to
return to
school to pursue gradu
ate study, I looked for
ward to the respite from
the tumult of the worka
day world. Where else
hut in the ivory tower

could one find the opportunity to pause
and reflect and to move at the more regu
larized pace set by the heartbeat of a cam
pus?
I've always thought of education as one
of the few things left that we actually mea
sure in years rather than in nano-seconds.
(That is, excluding marriages.... That is,
unless you're Charlie Sheen or Jim Carrey.)
Nationwide, students in the humanities
spend on average more than eight years pur
suing a doctorate, students in engineering
around six and overall, all students spend
around seven. Yes. while Brad Pitt is spend
ing "Seven Years in Tibet," we're getting
Seven Years into Debt.
At Stanford, there are so many things we
can count on. All the new first-year students
who matriculated this fall are the Class of
2(K)1, and it is almost assured that four years
from now, most will take part in the campus'
most time-honored and valued tradition
(which is, of course, fighting over whether or
not they can do the "wacky walk" and com
plaining about the graduation speaker).
First-year doctoral students, on the other
hand, may join their undergraduate counter
parts in 2001, or maybe 2002, or 2003 if they
had some difficulty with the dissertation,
2004 (by December, but with just minor
revisions) 0r....
Education was once thought to be
steeped in tradition and ceremony, which
makes for a more systematic and predictable

lifestyle. We have convocation every fall,
graduation every spring (just in time for all
the great summer movies ... that is, unless
they star Charlie Sheen or Jim Carrey).
Fall quarter is followed by winter quar
ter; winter quarter followed by spring quar
ter. Every quarter, it's the same old thing:
Pay your fees, shop around for classes, shop
around some more for classes, forget to reg
ister on Axess by the deadline, pay more
fees. We've got it down to a system, and
campus life is a bit slower and a bit more
predictable.
Or so 1 thought.
We live in a fast-paced, ever-changing
society. We're surrounded by a turbulent,
chaotic culture in which time is of the
essence. We herald new technology as our
savior, making it possible to do more and to
do more faster. We face overnight delivery,
hourly photo processing, minute rice and
split-second timing.
It seems time has been compressed in our
world. Everything moves at a quicker clip:
from microwaves to drive-through windows,
video games to bullet trains — we seem
obsessed with doing things faster. No sooner
have you Mmmßopped with Hanson than
the Spice Girls implore you to tell them
what you want (what you really, really
want).
It seems like everyone is in such a hurry.
Movies that seemed like they were just in
the theater are already on video rental
shelves (like I was really in a rush to rent
"Booty ( all").
In much the same way, academic life
depends on doing everything faster. We can
now access more data, process it more
quickly and produce more sophisticated pre
sentations thanks to computers, the Internet
and other technological breakthroughs.
But at what cost? Taking more than four

years to complete a degree is seen as a fail
ure. People speak in hushed tones, in much
the same way one pities a social outcast.
("You see her? She's been here five years."
"Oh, how sad. What a plucky little troop
er.")
Forget the biological clock, for we face
the intellectual clock as the years of "wun
derkind" graduate slip by, and the years of
"it's a wonder he can't graduate" seep in. At
least half of my Stanford colleagues are in.
have been in (or should be in) counseling or
therapy, in part due to the stress of finishing
"on time."
As funding grows tighter, doctoral stu
dents must land running if they hope to
graduate before their assistantships run out.
It now seems a luxury to spend an extended
amount of time absorbed in course work
and pondering a research agenda.
Instead, one is best advantaged if one
arrives on campus not only with research
questions and possible data sources in tow.
It has become more difficult to take the time
to let ideas gestate.
The only solution? Don't be seduced by
the speed of technology. Don't succumb to
the social pressure to go faster.
Yes, intellectual Luddites unite! Just
because we can do things faster doesfl't
mean we have to do things faster.
Follow my lead. Get rid of the pager, the
cell phone and the laptop! Call instead of
sending e-mail, read the whole article
instead of skimming the abstract and actual
ly go to the library rather than only search
ing through Netscape.
Enjoy your time here rather than racing
through it.
