Halogens lamps are
misunderstood
I was surprised that The Daily's editorial,
"An enlightened approach." wholeheartedly
supports the I Jniversity's decision to ban
halogen lighting. The Daily argues that halo
gen lights are a safety hazard because the
lamps generate intense heat that could set
lire to a number of substances such as paper,
cloth and "dead insects."
In actuality, there are several reasons why
this should no longer occur:
1) Most new halogens have protective
covers over their light bulbs that make it
impossible for the aforementioned combus
tionablcs to come into contact with the
extremely hot areas of the lamp.
2) Because halogen desk lamps don't face
upward like torchiercs do. it is impossible for
eombustionables to come into prolonged
contact with the super-heated bulb.
3) In order to catch fire, eombustionables
have to fall into the bowl of torchieres and
touch the area around the bulb. This can be
easily prevented if students were made
aware of the risks and told not to place any

eombustionables such as posters and cloth
on the walls or ceiling above their halogen
torchieres.
But instead of educating students in the
hazards of halogen lamp use, the University
has simply banned them. To ease the transi
tion, I lousing and Dining Services created a
swap program in which students could turn
in their halogens for an University-endorsed
"smart lamp."
This lamp, which would fetch $ I (K) only at
the Bookstore's inflated prices, was sup
posed to be 20-percent brighter then a halo
gen. Anybody who got duped into getting
one can testify that they are not. A 67-watt
"smart lamp" is no match for a 150-watt
halogen.
Even so. Mousing and Dining Services
officials must have had long-term savings on
their minds when they financed the ill-con
ceived swap program. Indeed, the Universi
ty's ban on all forms of lighting exceeding
150 watts can only be motivated by utility
costs.
Students are already forbidden to have air
conditioners, microwaves and other energy
intensive appliances in their nxmis. Housing
and Dining Services is simply taking the

trend one step further.
Considering all the late night studying
that Stanford demands, its students deserve
the "luxury" of decent lighting or at least the
right to procure such lighting. If that leads to
higher housing hills passed on to the student,
so be it.

Flicks should remain
fun for students
Hmm. First Stanford Events Director
Lois Wagner attempts to end the tradition of
the "Wacky Walk." and now she's consider
ing turning Sunday Flicks into an orderly,
managed affair by hiring non-student ushers.
Has Wagner perhaps considered banning
cheering at athletic events? After all. the
noisy, boisterous students and alumni must
be quite bothersome to the many alumni
who prefer to sit and watch the games in
peace.
Or for that matter, why not ban parties in
campus buildings? After all. they're simply

invitations for underage students to get
drunk and cause damage to themselves and
others.
Or perhaps Wagner could do us all a
favor and resign her position so Stanford can
hire an events director who understands the
concept of "fun" and why it is such a critical
part of Stanford life. I'm sure there's a posi
tion for her at an art museum or an opera
house somewhere.

Hoover should confess
to conservatism
Last week, my class went to visit the
Hoover Institution and we met with one of
the collectors there. He tried to convince us
that Hoover isn't all that conservative
because they hold the largest collection of
the National Socialist Party's archives as well
as other material from various progressive
groups and political parties throughout the
world.
It seemed ironic in light of the recent
honor given to former Hoover Director W.

Glenn Campbell, a conservative, anti-affir
mative-action University of California
regent who has been a favorite target of stu
dent activists because of his unwillingness to
talk to students or openly discuss issues of
diversity.
In Brad Heinz's Tuesday article he men
tions that Hoover has commissioned a bust
to be made of Campbell and portraits of him
and his wife to be placed in the institution.
This kind of idolatry to me seems ridiculous.
Campbell was able to raise a lot of money
for the Hoover Institution through his ultra
conservative rhetoric, and now he is being
deified through the Junior Scholars Program
and establishment of an endowment in his
name.
I am not attacking Hoover's right to do
whatever it wants and to hold whatever polit
ical views it may, but it should at least
acknowledge that it is one of the most con
servative think tanks in this country.
No matter how much socialist propagan
da lies within the walls of that tower, it is an
institution that has shown exactly where its
priorities lie.
