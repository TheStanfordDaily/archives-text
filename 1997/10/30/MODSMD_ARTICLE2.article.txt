# Concerned about HIV or AIDS?

### Anh Bui 
For students concerned about HI V and
AIDS, there are many resources on cam
pus that provide education about the dis
ease, as well as free HIV testing and peer
or professional counseling services.
Though the number of deaths resulting
from AIDS has consistently dropped dur
ing the past few years, the number of

young people infected with HIV are ris
ing.
People usually do not die from I lIV it
self. The virus attacks T-4 lymphocytes,
white blood cells that are a part of the
body's immune system. Once the immune
system is impaired, other diseases take
(his opportunity to attack the body.
Often symptoms do not appear
for several years. In the meantime,
testing is the only means of know
ing whether or not one has the
virus.
Confidential testing is conducted
by professional counselors through
CAPS (Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services) at Cowell. The person's
name is taken down, but it is not
recorded on the computer or on the
patient's charts.
The patient meets with a clinician
for about 15 minutes before taking
the test. Blood test results are avail
able in 7-10 days.
One can also choose to take an
anonymous HIV test instead.
Anonymous testing is done by a
trained peer counselor. The patient
is asked to choose a fictitious name,
which is used only to make the ap
pointment.
Before any anonymous testing is
done, the patient meets with the
peer counselor for roughly 20 to 30
minutes to discuss the test, HIV and
the patient's sexual history.
"The pre-test counsel is an im
portant part of what we do," said se
nior Brandy Kaneshiro, one of six
AIDS / HIV Anonymous Test peer
counselors. "In a way, we are using
the test to educate people, to
change, and perhaps even save, their
lives."
After two weeks, the patient re
turns for the test results and a post

test counsel. If the patient requests
further counseling, he or she is re
ferred to the Bridge or to CAPS.
To be an HIV peer counselor,
one must take a peer counseling
class offered by the Psychology De
partment and attend extensive
training, which includes seminars on
HIV with speakers from various San
Francisco organizations. Prospec
tive counselors must also do a prac
tice counsel in front of an audience
of mentors and peers.
"We were group-coached to han
dle all the different types of ques
tions that could arise," Kaneshiro
said. "We had to learn how to ask
the right questions so that people
would feel comfortable talking to
us."
But HIV testing is not the only
AIDS service available on campus.
Volunteers Increasing the Visibility
of AIDS (VIVA) is a student orga
nization based in the Haas Center. It
has created partnerships with vari
ous AIDS awareness organizations
in the Bay Area in order to facilitate
volunteer placement for Stanford
students.
"Though VIVA only started dur
ing the spring of last year, we have
already invited many speakers to
come to the dorms and talk about
their personal experiences with
AIDS. I think it is this first-hand ac
count which really affects people,"
said VIVA co-president, Jessica
Werner. VIVA has planned a week
filled with AIDS awareness activi
ties in celebration of World AIDS
day Dec. 1.
