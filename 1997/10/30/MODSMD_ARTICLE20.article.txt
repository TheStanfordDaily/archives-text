## Therese Lee Losing arms and brushes with fame 
### 
LAS I WEEK, IWO men got their
arms ripped off during a tug of-war
match in Taiwan.
'• I here were about 700 people on each side.
\\ hese men had struggled hard for their teams;
in their heroic effoits, they wrapped the rope
aiound their shoulders and pulled with all
their might. The iope snapped. Their arms
'came off. A third man lost his right hand.
When I heard first this story, I didn't
know whether to laugh (which 1 did) or
'liown and call it a tragedy (which it is). Like
a "teacher" in Stanley Milgram's shock
'experiment. I laughed morbidly in the face
ot human suffering.
My thiid-grade teacher once accused me
of being morbid. Back then, we had a week
ly current events assignment, for which we
clipped a newspaper ailicle every Wednes
day and presented it to the class. Frankly,
the news boied me. I was too young to
understand either religion or politics, which
piettv much ruled out the entire front page.
1 ;ilways went for the juicy stuff: murders,
'robberies, death and molestation.
On one particular day, I brought in a
story on a priest who had been convicted of
molesting two boys. After my most elo
quent piesentalion. Ms. Van Ess asked me
il I knew what "molestation" meant.

She caught me off guard. 1 just brought
in the story because it was the only one that
could keep me interested to the very end. 1
admitted my ignorance, and she said some
thing along the lines of. "You're just a mor
bid one, aren't you?
"Do you know what 'morbid' means?"
she asked, tilling her head and cocking one
eyebrow.
Hmmm. Two new vocabulary words.
"Well, you can look it up."
I did and took her words as a compli
ment. I was morbid. 1 was cool.
I went through some strange phases as a
child. In fourth grade, I decided that being a
"nerd" was something desirable. I rushed
home and asked my sister, Vivian, if I was a
nerd or not. Five years my senior, she didn't
take me seriously and blandly answered, "I
don't know."
Disturbed by her apathy. I proceeded to
point out all the characteristics I had which
made me a quality candidate lor the title. I
had the glasses and the obnoxious know-it
all attitude. That was enough, wasn't it?
Vivian finally agreed after a couple of hours
of relentless re-education efforts.
Some things haven't changed in the past
10 years. Instead of asking my sister to veri
fy my nerd-dom, I now dress up in "power

clothes" and interview with potential
employers, asking them to verity my capac
ity to enter the work force. 1 lie vestiges of
my childhood fade with each resume 1 send
out.
Image control is the name of the game.
1 ley. look at me 1 can dress myself. 1 lire
me.
American politics and the media oper
ate in much the same way. It is a strange
hournalistic tug of war. and it threatens to
disarm the freedom to know and under
stand. Politicians prostitute themselves pos
itive television footage; the tube virtually
dictates how election campaigns are run.
We'll never have to worry about having a
president with a big wart; he'd never make
it past the primaries. Image is worth l >(> per
cent. thirst only 10.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's I Jnited
States itinerary this week was tailored to
maximize opportunities for quality photos
and sound bites. Not only did starting off in
Hawaii guarantee the shortest flight time
from Beijing, it also had Pearl I larbor.
With a single cemetery wreath, Jiang was
ever-so-subtly anti-Japanese and pro-Sino
American-alliance all at once. Replete with
a 21-gun salute at the White I louse, this visit
is no less than Jiang's coming out paity as a

powerful world leader.
Hut there's the image problem. Jiang has
no lips. As an American professor said on
the Hong Kong news earlier this week.
Jiang seems ill-at-ease all the time. "He's
not a cuddly figure," the Chinese studies
academic said. "He claps in a strange way."
I apologize for the 71-year-old Commu
nist.
China has been attacked on all sides by
the American media: 1 lie release of three
anti China films at roughly the same time
and the presentation of numerous pieces of
anti-China legislation by Congress have
fueled the anti-China sentiment already so
pervasive in the United Slates.
China is the sehoolkid to pick on in the
international affairs sandbox.
And when that kid has no lips and stiffly
reads from prepared texts during inter
views, it's easy for media bullies to make
Jiang into an evil, morbid old ('ommie who
delights in crushing dissidcnce and students
with tanks.
Put Jiang is also a former mechanical
engineer who speaks multiple languages,
including Russian and can recite the (iettvs
burg Address from memory. I le also appar
ently has 'o qualms about putting on funny
hats. "Some nights I cannot get to sleep," he

told I nnc Inc., when lie thinks of his respon
sibility for more than one billion people.
Jiang may very well be an "evil" man

of the Chinese Communist Party was 70

bad. It's difficult to judge when the Amen
can media slants coverage one way and the
self-censored I long Kong media tradi
tionallv the news ccntei of Asia leans the
other.
I wonder how different things would be il
Jiang were youngei and more cuddly.
Jiang may meet my grandfather this
week as he wraps up his seven city tour. I
think il could be the highlight of his trip

LAS I WEEK, IWO men got their
arms ripped off during a tug of-war
match in Taiwan.
'• I here were about 700 people on each side.
\\ hese men had struggled hard for their teams;
in their heroic effoits, they wrapped the rope
aiound their shoulders and pulled with all
their might. The iope snapped. Their arms
'came off. A third man lost his right hand.
When I heard first this story, I didn't
know whether to laugh (which 1 did) or
'liown and call it a tragedy (which it is). Like
a "teacher" in Stanley Milgram's shock
'experiment. I laughed morbidly in the face
ot human suffering.
My thiid-grade teacher once accused me
of being morbid. Back then, we had a week
ly current events assignment, for which we
clipped a newspaper ailicle every Wednes
day and presented it to the class. Frankly,
the news boied me. I was too young to
understand either religion or politics, which
piettv much ruled out the entire front page.
1 ;ilways went for the juicy stuff: murders,
'robberies, death and molestation.
On one particular day, I brought in a
story on a priest who had been convicted of
molesting two boys. After my most elo
quent piesentalion. Ms. Van Ess asked me
il I knew what "molestation" meant.

She caught me off guard. 1 just brought
in the story because it was the only one that
could keep me interested to the very end. 1
admitted my ignorance, and she said some
thing along the lines of. "You're just a mor
bid one, aren't you?
"Do you know what 'morbid' means?"
she asked, tilling her head and cocking one
eyebrow.
Hmmm. Two new vocabulary words.
"Well, you can look it up."
I did and took her words as a compli
ment. I was morbid. 1 was cool.
I went through some strange phases as a
child. In fourth grade, I decided that being a
"nerd" was something desirable. I rushed
home and asked my sister, Vivian, if I was a
nerd or not. Five years my senior, she didn't
take me seriously and blandly answered, "I
don't know."
Disturbed by her apathy. I proceeded to
point out all the characteristics I had which
made me a quality candidate lor the title. I
had the glasses and the obnoxious know-it
all attitude. That was enough, wasn't it?
Vivian finally agreed after a couple of hours
of relentless re-education efforts.
Some things haven't changed in the past
10 years. Instead of asking my sister to veri
fy my nerd-dom, I now dress up in "power

clothes" and interview with potential
employers, asking them to verity my capac
ity to enter the work force. 1 lie vestiges of
my childhood fade with each resume 1 send
out.
Image control is the name of the game.
1 ley. look at me 1 can dress myself. 1 lire
me.
American politics and the media oper
ate in much the same way. It is a strange
hournalistic tug of war. and it threatens to
disarm the freedom to know and under
stand. Politicians prostitute themselves pos
itive television footage; the tube virtually
dictates how election campaigns are run.
We'll never have to worry about having a
president with a big wart; he'd never make
it past the primaries. Image is worth l >(> per
cent. thirst only 10.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's I Jnited
States itinerary this week was tailored to
maximize opportunities for quality photos
and sound bites. Not only did starting off in
Hawaii guarantee the shortest flight time
from Beijing, it also had Pearl I larbor.
With a single cemetery wreath, Jiang was
ever-so-subtly anti-Japanese and pro-Sino
American-alliance all at once. Replete with
a 21-gun salute at the White I louse, this visit
is no less than Jiang's coming out paity as a

powerful world leader.
Hut there's the image problem. Jiang has
no lips. As an American professor said on
the Hong Kong news earlier this week.
Jiang seems ill-at-ease all the time. "He's
not a cuddly figure," the Chinese studies
academic said. "He claps in a strange way."
I apologize for the 71-year-old Commu
nist.
China has been attacked on all sides by
the American media: 1 lie release of three
anti China films at roughly the same time
and the presentation of numerous pieces of
anti-China legislation by Congress have
fueled the anti-China sentiment already so
pervasive in the United Slates.
China is the sehoolkid to pick on in the
international affairs sandbox.
And when that kid has no lips and stiffly
reads from prepared texts during inter
views, it's easy for media bullies to make
Jiang into an evil, morbid old ('ommie who
delights in crushing dissidcnce and students
with tanks.
Put Jiang is also a former mechanical
engineer who speaks multiple languages,
including Russian and can recite the (iettvs
burg Address from memory. I le also appar
ently has 'o qualms about putting on funny
hats. "Some nights I cannot get to sleep," he

told I nnc Inc., when lie thinks of his respon
sibility for more than one billion people.
