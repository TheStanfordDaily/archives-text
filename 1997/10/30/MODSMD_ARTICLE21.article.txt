## Best of the best Stanford-UCLA rivalry has no match in college volleyball 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Sometimes rivalries become so intense thc\ grow to
define a sport at its greatest Celtics-Lakers, Army-
Navy, North ( arolina-Duke.
In women's volleyball, it's Stanford-UCLA. The
names alone represent dominance in the sport, and the
success of these two programs speaks volumes for their
greatness.
The rivalry begins
Perhaps the fortune of being in the same locale and
the same conference added to the intensity. But whatev
er the reasons, no one can argue against the incredibility
of the rivalry.
"We both had great teams," said UCLA head coach
Andy Banachowski. "When we played there was a
tremendous amount of intensity and a lot of good play.
We had a lot of good. long, hard matches."
One of the longest and hardest for Stanford fans to
digest was the national championship match in 1984.

I'he Card finished the regular season with a conference
title (then the Western Collegiate Athletic Assoeia
tion) and headed into the NCAA tournament as the
top seed.

The Bruins were the No. 2 seed, and the showdown

Al Green Daily lile
The Stanford women celebrate their upset victory over top-ranked UCLA in the championship match of
the 1992 NCAA Tournament.
cific 10 Conference in 1986, and an
interesting trend developed: Stan
ford and UCLA began to dominate
the conference. In fact, no other pro
gram has ever won a Pac-10 title in
women's volleyball, and together
Stanford and UCLA are a combined
364-54 in conference play.
In 1990 UCLA had won its third
straight Pac-10 title, going 18-0 and
giving Stanford its only two confer
ence losses. When the NCAA tour
nament came along, the Bruins were
the top seed. The Cardinal, although
ranked third nationally, had the mis
fortune of being placed in the West
Regional.
The two teams met in the region
al final, and the Bruins were over
powering, taking a three-game victo
ry en route to their second national
championship.
"It's been a long history, and they
had the upper hand for a while," said
head coach Don Shaw. "There have
been some tremendous matches
down there and up here. For a long,
long time, that was women's colle
giate volleyball."

The one that got away
Stanford looked to gain some
ground on the Bruins in 1991. With
senior Kristin Klein and junior Bev
Oden leading the way, the Cardinal
took two matches from UCLA in the
regular season, claiming the confer
ence crown with a perfect record.
Again the two teams met in the
regional, but this time Stanford was
the favorite and the contest took
place at Maples Pavilion. UCLA was
stunning, winning game one 15-2
and then claiming a seesaw battle in
game two 15-12.
Game three epitomized the rival
ry. UCLA jumped out to a 7-1 lead,
but the Card rallied behind the sup
port of the home crowd, reeling off
10 straight points. Then the Bruins
surged ahead 14-11. What happened
next was unbelievable.
At 14-12, middle blocker Amy
Cooper went down with a sprained
ankle. Then-lreshman and current
Stanford assistant coach Anne Wicks
entered the match. Wicks served at
14-13, and UCLA star Natalie
Williams pounded a shot that looked
to be the nail in Stanford's coffin.
Klein wouldn't have that, howev
er, and made an incredible dig that
resulted in a game-tying kill bv

Oden. But that was all the Card
would got. A service error sent the
ball back to IJCLA, and after anoth
er Bruin point. Williams got the op
portunity again.
This time it was a spinning jump
serve that tailed toward the line. Ju
nior Jennifer Jackson couldn't de
cide if the ball was in or out and at
the last minute tried to retract her
outstretched arms. She was a half
second too late; the ball hit off her
arms and out-of-bounds for the final
point of the match.
"Down here, IJSC has been our
rival," Banachowski said. "But dur
ing that period, Stanford replaced
IJSC' as the must-win we had to have
to feel we had a good year.
"It wasn't always the champi
onship match, but when we met in
the regional, it did determine the
[national title]. We scored an upset
in '91. and [Stanford| repaid the
favor when [it| beat us in '92. Those
are key matches that stand out for
me."
Fourth time's the charm
The 1992 Stanfotd-IJCLA saga
was an encore performance of the
previous season with the roles re
versed. This time the Bruins took
two from the Cardinal during the

regular season, and the defending
national champions entered the
NC A A tournament as the top seed.
Stanford was seeded second and
shipped to the Mideast Regional in
Illinois. That set the stage for a one
two showdown in the championship
match. Stanford battled through
what was considered the toughest
bracket of the tournament, while
UCLA cruised to the Final Four in
Albuquerque, N.M.. riding a 43-
match win streak including three
straight wins over Stanford — and
looking invincible.
But Stanford's block proved oth
erwise, as the ( aid took the first two
games 15-8, 15-9. UCLA's hitting re
turned to the land of the living for
game three, with the Bruins winning
15-6.
Perhaps remembering Kim
Oden's loss of a 2-1 lead in 1984, sis
ter Bev took care of business in game
four. She guided the Card to a 15-10
victory and the school's first-ever na
tional championship.
Finally, after three heartbreaking
losses to IJ( IA in the N( 'AA tour
nament losses that let! to three na
tional championships for the Bruins
and three what might-have-been's
for the (ai d Stanford claimed the
bin one.

One last time
That's just when the rivalry was
hitting its peak. Growing up in near
by Los Altos. Calif., senior co-cap
tain Lisa Sharpley frequented the
annual Stanlbrd-UCLA match and
remembers just how exciting it was.
"Basically, the UCLA-Stanford
match was the match 1 dreamed of
playing in,"the setter said. "UCLA
had a dynasty and all these amazing
players. It was always an exciting
match."
Sharpley got a chance to play in
her dream match as a freshman.
That season Stanford went 17-1 in
the conference with its only loss
coming at the hands of I J("1 .A. And
once again, in the national champi
onship game it was Stanford-
UCLA.
The match wasn't dominated by
either squad, with the teams ex
changing blows the first two games.
With the match knotted at 1-1. the
Card took a pivotal l(>-14 win in
game three and carried that momen
tum into game four, claiming the na
tional championship 15-13.
With that victory came Stanford's
second national title and essentially
the end of an era. These days the
Bruins are struggling to stav above

,S(K(. Last season was the first in
UCLA's history that the women
didn't make the postseason, and the
Bruins aren't doing much better this
year with a 4-7 conference record.
" I hey still had a really good team
that year," Sharpley said ol IK LA's
season. "I clul get to play in UK
big match, but it's been anti-climac
tic. bach year it gets less and less. It's
kind ol sad."
According to Shaw. Sharpley and
her classmates are quite possiblv a
bij« reason lor IJCI.A's demise.
Shaw's acquisition ol Sharpley and
fellow seniors Kristin l-'olkl and Bar
bara llejika, all ol whom were con
sidering UCLA, won the recruiting
pri/e that year.
" That was a major turning point,"
Shaw said. Since then, "they've tried
to battle to catch up. and we've
leaned on three [four-year) starters."
So the I'( I A Stanford matchup
isn't quite w hat it used to be. Maples
won't likely till up for tomorrow
night's contest against the Bruins,
and the games may not even be
close. But that doesn't diminish the
incredible performances that took
place when these two teams met.
And if the Maples hardwood could
talk, that's exactly what it would tell
VOll.

Al Green Daily lile
The Stanford women celebrate their upset victory over top-ranked UCLA in the championship match of
the 1992 NCAA Tournament.
cific 10 Conference in 1986, and an
interesting trend developed: Stan
ford and UCLA began to dominate
the conference. In fact, no other pro
gram has ever won a Pac-10 title in
women's volleyball, and together
Stanford and UCLA are a combined
364-54 in conference play.
In 1990 UCLA had won its third
straight Pac-10 title, going 18-0 and
giving Stanford its only two confer
ence losses. When the NCAA tour
nament came along, the Bruins were
the top seed. The Cardinal, although
ranked third nationally, had the mis
fortune of being placed in the West
Regional.
The two teams met in the region
al final, and the Bruins were over
powering, taking a three-game victo
ry en route to their second national
championship.
"It's been a long history, and they
had the upper hand for a while," said
head coach Don Shaw. "There have
been some tremendous matches
down there and up here. For a long,
long time, that was women's colle
giate volleyball."

The one that got away
Stanford looked to gain some
ground on the Bruins in 1991. With
senior Kristin Klein and junior Bev
Oden leading the way, the Cardinal
took two matches from UCLA in the
regular season, claiming the confer
ence crown with a perfect record.
Again the two teams met in the
regional, but this time Stanford was
the favorite and the contest took
place at Maples Pavilion. UCLA was
stunning, winning game one 15-2
and then claiming a seesaw battle in
game two 15-12.
Game three epitomized the rival
ry. UCLA jumped out to a 7-1 lead,
but the Card rallied behind the sup
port of the home crowd, reeling off
10 straight points. Then the Bruins
surged ahead 14-11. What happened
next was unbelievable.
At 14-12, middle blocker Amy
Cooper went down with a sprained
ankle. Then-lreshman and current
Stanford assistant coach Anne Wicks
entered the match. Wicks served at
14-13, and UCLA star Natalie
Williams pounded a shot that looked
to be the nail in Stanford's coffin.
Klein wouldn't have that, howev
er, and made an incredible dig that
resulted in a game-tying kill bv

Oden. But that was all the Card
would got. A service error sent the
ball back to IJCLA, and after anoth
er Bruin point. Williams got the op
portunity again.
This time it was a spinning jump
serve that tailed toward the line. Ju
nior Jennifer Jackson couldn't de
cide if the ball was in or out and at
the last minute tried to retract her
outstretched arms. She was a half
second too late; the ball hit off her
arms and out-of-bounds for the final
point of the match.
"Down here, IJSC has been our
rival," Banachowski said. "But dur
ing that period, Stanford replaced
IJSC' as the must-win we had to have
to feel we had a good year.
"It wasn't always the champi
onship match, but when we met in
the regional, it did determine the
[national title]. We scored an upset
in '91. and [Stanford| repaid the
favor when [it| beat us in '92. Those
are key matches that stand out for
me."
Fourth time's the charm
The 1992 Stanfotd-IJCLA saga
was an encore performance of the
previous season with the roles re
versed. This time the Bruins took
two from the Cardinal during the

regular season, and the defending
national champions entered the
NC A A tournament as the top seed.
Stanford was seeded second and
shipped to the Mideast Regional in
Illinois. That set the stage for a one
two showdown in the championship
match. Stanford battled through
what was considered the toughest
bracket of the tournament, while
UCLA cruised to the Final Four in
Albuquerque, N.M.. riding a 43-
match win streak including three
straight wins over Stanford — and
looking invincible.
But Stanford's block proved oth
erwise, as the ( aid took the first two
games 15-8, 15-9. UCLA's hitting re
turned to the land of the living for
game three, with the Bruins winning
15-6.
Perhaps remembering Kim
Oden's loss of a 2-1 lead in 1984, sis
ter Bev took care of business in game
four. She guided the Card to a 15-10
victory and the school's first-ever na
tional championship.
Finally, after three heartbreaking
losses to IJ( IA in the N( 'AA tour
nament losses that let! to three na
tional championships for the Bruins
and three what might-have-been's
for the (ai d Stanford claimed the
bin one.

One last time
That's just when the rivalry was
hitting its peak. Growing up in near
by Los Altos. Calif., senior co-cap
tain Lisa Sharpley frequented the
annual Stanlbrd-UCLA match and
remembers just how exciting it was.
"Basically, the UCLA-Stanford
match was the match 1 dreamed of
playing in,"the setter said. "UCLA
had a dynasty and all these amazing
players. It was always an exciting
match."
Sharpley got a chance to play in
her dream match as a freshman.
That season Stanford went 17-1 in
the conference with its only loss
coming at the hands of I J("1 .A. And
once again, in the national champi
onship game it was Stanford-
UCLA.
The match wasn't dominated by
either squad, with the teams ex
changing blows the first two games.
With the match knotted at 1-1. the
Card took a pivotal l(>-14 win in
game three and carried that momen
tum into game four, claiming the na
tional championship 15-13.
With that victory came Stanford's
second national title and essentially
the end of an era. These days the
Bruins are struggling to stav above

,S(K(. Last season was the first in
UCLA's history that the women
didn't make the postseason, and the
Bruins aren't doing much better this
year with a 4-7 conference record.
" I hey still had a really good team
that year," Sharpley said ol IK LA's
season. "I clul get to play in UK
big match, but it's been anti-climac
tic. bach year it gets less and less. It's
kind ol sad."
According to Shaw. Sharpley and
her classmates are quite possiblv a
bij« reason lor IJCI.A's demise.
Shaw's acquisition ol Sharpley and
fellow seniors Kristin l-'olkl and Bar
bara llejika, all ol whom were con
sidering UCLA, won the recruiting
pri/e that year.
" That was a major turning point,"
Shaw said. Since then, "they've tried
to battle to catch up. and we've
leaned on three [four-year) starters."
So the I'( I A Stanford matchup
isn't quite w hat it used to be. Maples
