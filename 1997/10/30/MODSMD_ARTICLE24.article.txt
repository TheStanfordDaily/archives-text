Ice hockey
With one goalie in Italy this
quarter and one goalie trying out
for the Canadian women's (Jlympic
team, Stanford ice hockey is strug
gling to return to nationals after
placing sixth last year.
"I'm not really happy with the
way we're playing this season," said
junior defenseman Paul Heneman.
Despite a 1-2 start and its share
of problems, the team has depth at
most other positions. But a 9-5 loss
against Utah did not add to the
team's confidence.
Heneman hopes things will
change soon.
"We came out strong, but we

just fell apart defensively," he said.
The team has a big weekend
coming up, however, with three
games in three days. Stanford visits
California tonight, then travels to
San Jose to face the Bears again to
morrow and San Jose State on Sat
urday.
Bowling
Sophomore captain Ward
Bullard and the Stanford howling
team returned for another season
last week when they participated in
a tournament in Visalia.
Facing opponents from the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Bowling
Conference, the Cardinal managed
to take foui points from defending
conference champions Sacramento
State.
The team won a total of 10
points after Bullard recorded back
to-back 200 games, as the Cardinal
shocked UC-Davis.
