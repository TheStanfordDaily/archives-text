# Davis and Elliott make mark for Card
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
"Different" is the word Simon
Elliott and Gerard Davis use to de
scribe both the people and the soc
cer in the United States.
The two starters on Stanford
men's soccer team decline to elabo
rate on what they've noticed since
coming halfway around the globe
from New Zealand to play for the
second-ranked Cardinal.
"It's sometimes quite funny to
see the little differences that exist."
said Elliott, a junior midfielder. "It's
good to have two of us so you know
someone else will know what you're
talking about."
Davis, a sophomore defender,
and Elliott came to Stanford at the
urging of head coach Bobby Clark,
who spent two years in New Zealand
between his time at Dartmouth and

his arrival at Stanford in 19%.
In New Zealand, Clark coached
the national senior, ()lympic, under
-20 and under-17 squads. About 10 of
the players he met there now play
for American universities.
The alternative is playing soccer
part-time in New Zealand or travel
ing to a different country to try mak
ing it on a national team. Before
Clark suggested the United States,
many New Zealand soccer players
went to Scotland or England.
"Most would come back two
years later having given up their ed
ucation and having been disenchant
ed," said Clark, who advocates the
U.S. system because it allows the
combination of high-level sports and
high-level academics. "The failure
rate in England in the professional
ranks is pretty high. There's nothing
else to fall back on. because they've
missed a couple years of education."

When Clark went to New
Zealand, he took his son. Jamie —
now a junior midfielder for the Car
dinal — who helped train a national
team that hadn't been active for
nearly two years. The college-age
players asked how they might follow
in Jamie's footsteps and play at an
American university.
('lark suggested the names of
several coaches. His New Zealand
players are now at Dartmouth. Har
vard and Noire Dame, among other
schools.
Elliott transferred to Stanford
this year from the I 'diversity of Vic
toria in Wellington, New Zealand,
while Davis started for Stanford as a
freshman last year.
Knowing Clark and Stanford's
academic reputation, the decision to
cross the Pacific Ocean was easy,
they said.
"When you get an opportunity to

come to a place like this," Elliott
said, "you don't really want to turn it
down."
The closeness of the team — one
of the biggest differences Elliott and
Davis said they've noticed — has
made all the difference in moving to
a foreign country.
The players in New Zealand were
either students or adults with day
jobs, Clark said. "None of them are
professional players," he explained.
"They're all teachers and policemen
and carpenters. It's a totally differ
ent group."
That was due in part to the fact
that New Zealand's national league
had dissolved a few years earlier.
When New Zealand decided to re
vive the team, it advertised interna
tionally for a coach. Clark's oldest
son. Tommy, saw the ad, and know
ing his mother had always wanted to
visit New Zealand, called home with
the news.
After being hired, Clark traveled
around the country, choosing re
gional squads from which a national
team eventually was developed. El
liott was one of those players.
"He was one of the kids who came
out for the trials," Clark said. "I liked
him and thought he had potential."
Clark said that although he
hadn't been considering leaving
Dartmouth, he appreciated the
change.
"Suddenly," he said, "I was
thrown into a different environment
where I had to think differently. You
grow because you look at things
from different angles."
Elliott and Davis said they're get
ting used to the new environment
and can appreciate the differences.
Hut Davis said there's one change he
wishes people would make.
When he arrived at Stanford last
year, some of the seniors nicknamed
him "Foster" in reference to the
Australian beer. People never seem
to realize, he complained, that New
Zealand and Australia aren't the
same place.
"I think it was a beer reference,
although ask any New Zealander
and they'd be offended." he said.
"Foster's isn't the best beer."
