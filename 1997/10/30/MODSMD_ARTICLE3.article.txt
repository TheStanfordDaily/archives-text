# Engineering prof dies
## STS co-creator Kline remembered by colleagues 
### Karin West 
Stephen Kline — an emeritus professor of
mechanical engineering and one of the cre
ators of the Program in Science, Technology
and Society — died at his campus home on
Oct. 24 of liver disease. He was 75.
A Stanford faculty member for 40 years.
Kline was considered an innovator not only in
his award-winning research in mechanical en
gineering but in his groundbreaking work to
link the academic worlds of science and the hu
manities.
"His onlv hobby was his work." Naomi Jef

fries Kline, his wife of 20 years and a practicing
psychotherapist, said in a statement. "He liked
nothing better."
Kline had a long relationship with the Skin
lbrd community, graduating in 1943 with a de
gree in mechanical engineering. He worked
with the U.S. Army and as a research analyst
for North American Aviation (now Rocket
dyne) and returned to Stanford to obtain a
master's in mechanical engineering in 1949.
Kline earned a doctorate in 1952 from Mi l
and thereafter joined Stanford's faculty, a po-
sition he held until his retirement in
1992.
Aeronautics and Astronautics
Prof. Emeritus Walter Vincenti col
laborated with Kline and two hu
manities professors to create STS in
1970. The interdisciplinary program
enables undergraduate students to
study the interaction of science and
engineering with social sciences.
Vincenti recalled that Kline ex
pressed concerned that the engi
neering program didn't promote
study of technology as a human or
social activity. In creating the STS
Program, the first of its kind at a uni
versity. "Steve Kline probably
pushed more energetically than any
of the rest of us."

During the 1940s and 19505.
Kline studied what was then one of
the most important unsolved prob
lems in fluid mechanics, the nature
of turbulence. In 1968, he orga
nized a conference at Stanford on
turbulent boundary layer predic
tion which was heralded by the
American Society of Mechanical
Engineers International as a land
mark.
Kline's research earned him sci
entific medals in six countries, and
he was honored with an induction
into the National Academy of Engi
neering in 1981.
STS Chair Robert McGinn noted
Kline's remarkable ability to main
tain research at a high level while si
multaneously working to promote
the interdisciplinary study of the sci
ences and the humanities.
McGinn noted that both areas of

Kline's work helped to overcome
stereotypes about engineering being
"simply an applied science borrow
ing from other sciences. His own re
search made it difficult to uphold
these simplistic definitions."
Colleagues also recalled Kline's
strong yet kind nature. "He had one
of the most flexible minds of anyone
I've ever known," Vincenti said.
Kline was very determined in pre
senting his ideas, "but if you could
make a convincing argument against
one of his ideas, he'd listen."
McGinn added that Kline was
"an extremely supportive col
league" who "truly contributed to
the collegial spirit of exchanging
ideas and learning from disciplines
other than one's own."
Memorial services will be held on
Wednesday at 4 p.m. in Memorial
Church.
