## The
						Marriage of Figaro 
### Benjamin Lawrance Contributing writer 
San Francisco Opera's new production of Mozart's "The Marriage
of Figaro" is a delight not to be missed. Rarely does this opera come
across with such a pleasing combination of precision and surprise. Far
too often new stagings coUapse for want of timing or talent; or the op
posite, too much talent or ambition on the part of the director. Gra
ziella Sciutti earns the heartiest congratulations. Many famed years
singing the role of Susanna herself enabled Sciutti to look inside the in
tricate workings of one of Mozart's most complicated and puzzling
works and present a coherent and intelligent stratagem.
Friday featured the first of two casts for this extended run. And
while it would be vain to deny my disappointment in not witnessing
again the might of Bryn Terfel, the evening's Figaro (Giovanni Furlan
etto) did not disappoint. Indeed the entire cast seemed to melt
sonorously into one, and at times it was quite possible to believe they
were selected and hired as an ensemble. Fach and every soloist dazzled
in what has to be the most well-rehearsed show of the season.
"Figaro" is Lorenzo da Ponte's loose interpretation of the play of
the same name by Beaumarchais. The central figure, a servant to
Cxiunt Almaviva (Bo Skovhus), is betrothed to Susanna (Sylvia Mc-
Nair), and as the curtain rises, they plan their marriage. Susanna is fear
ful that the count may restore his "feudal right" for the maidens of the
manor and together they plot to ensure a trouble-free wedding.
Meanwhile, Marcellina (Judith Christin) and Doctor Bartolo
(Sorin Coliban) try to duplicitously pry apart this union â€” Marcelli
na replacing Susanna with herself. Then the hyper-hormonal Cheru
bino (Angelika Kirshschlager), who is fleeing the wrath of the Count,
enters to persuade Susanna to aid him in his courting of the Countess
(Solveig Kringelhorn). Finally the Count appears, makes advances to
Susanna, betrays himself to C.herubino and promptly banishes the
youth for eavesdropping. Thus is the flag of intrigue and deception un
furled upon high.
The three following acts chase this chaotic plot. Susanna, Figaro

and the Countess conspire to enmesh the unfaithful Count. Marcelli
na, Bartolo and Count plot to lever apart the impending union of the
loving servants. And Cherubino, aided by Barbarina (Peggy Kriha
Dye), desperately tries to avoid the military post awaiting him, while
making amorous advances to every woman he meets.
The key to this opera is timing and audacity. The cast had both in
abundance (though the surtitle operator lacked the former) and thus
never detracted from the mischief and romance. Of course a whole
some set design was a great a help as resourceful directing. The im
pressive scenery of Zack Brown resonated with the cast and audience.
They knew where to step, and they had objects with which to act. Mar
cellina, the Count and Countess displayed their skills prominently.
At times, though, scenic immensity countered the singers' ability,
almost as if the designer never sat further than five rows back in the
theater. For example, when Figaro measures the floor space for his
bed, the implication is that his room is tiny, while the lyrics suggest the
two have yet to take up residency. The chamber's depth and props
however, disagree with this. Nor did the final act give the cast ample
opportunity to become lost and then found. Far too much of what
should have happened on stage took place off. Movement was too
often stymied by functionless fountains and superfluous sculpture.
Susanna and the Countess responded to these slight tensions with
grace. The two have a remarkably similar sweetness in tone, though
McNair, the fainter of the two, struggled to fill the stage when alone.
While in ensemble she was sometimes overwhelmed, her technique
was never the issue. When solo, Kringelhorn has a crisper, more hol
low voice. She poured forth despair convincingly in both the second
and third act.
Figaro had large Welsh shoes to fill but never failed to impress.
Furlanetto is humorous, brisk and lively. Fie scurries about stage and
draws the finer lines together. His cunning is complimented by the
boldness of Skovhus. The Danish tenor was a delight. Handsome and
athletic, he carried off every scene with his crystal clear Italian and
warm resonance. Ifanyone upstaged him, it was Cherubino. The drag
subtext combined with a deliciously mellifluous voice, made Kirsh

schlager's one of the most exciting performances of the season.
Conductor Donald Runnicles held sway with his usual ease, pre
viding the linchpin to the unity of the production. Without doul
this is one of the most memorable performances in recent years an
will be missed at one's peril.
"The Marriage of Figaro" will be performed on Nov. 1 at the Sa
Francisco War Memorial Opera House and will return for four perfoi
mances with a different cast in January.
