## CALLING THE MOTHERSHIP: DUB NARCOTIC SOUND SYSTEM SETS DOWN 
### Zachary Roberts Editorial staff 
Sometimes you gotta work for it, and
sometimes you just get lucky. The
Stanford campus will get lucky
today, when the critically acclaimed band
Dub Narcotic Sound System jam out an
hour-long afternoon set in White Plaza
from 12 to 1 p.m., courtesy of Stanford's
own KZSU, 90.1 FM.
Take the dub rhythms of Kingston,
Jamaica, the funky soul blues of Mem
phis, Tennessee and add powerful late
70s bass riffs and the sensibilities of free
thinking Olympia, Washington. Then
quote Devo ("Are we not men?") and
layer bizarre effects into a pastiche of
sound.
The cool thing is that DNSS plays
music that demands dancing. Not just
easy head-bopping, I mean full tilt

body boogie. DNSS finds a
groove and works it hard;
George Clinton, Starchild
and Bootsy Collins would be
proud of these boys.
DNSS is a "project" for K
Records' partner Calvin John
son, which originated in his de
sire to create dance music that
could be played at the parties of
all the hip kids in Olympia. So far
it has resulted in two full-length
albums and several singles.
+The latest release for DNSS
was a four song HP titled "Bone
Dry," recorded during last
year's tour in support of its
album "Boot Party." "Bone
Dry" was released as both CD
and 12"; Johnson claims that
the 12" is connected to how
DNSS is reusing elements of
early '80s music. As strategical-

ly important, perhaps, is that by going to
the 12", DNSS has enabled its music to
get into the hip-hop departments of A
level radio as well as into the collections
of rave and club DJs.
Today's show comes close to the end
of a two-month tour that has been
booked into mid-sized clubs and college
campuses in more than 30 states, from
Rhode Island to Arizona. The afternoon
set is not listed on the tour itinerary,
which has I )NSS playing at Bottom of the
Hill in San Francisco this evening.
KZSU has been trying to provide
quality lunch time entertainment in
White Plaza for more than a year, with
varied success. It is an outgrowth of its
long-running "Wednesday Night Live"
program, which features a live, local
band in studio every Wednesday night at
9 p.m.
Today it has played its hand right, and
we get to reap the benefits.
