# Bird watching At The Coffee House
## 
### Eno Sarris 
If you like Beach Boys-type
crooning and up-beat guitar
rock, the Birdwatchers is the
band for you. If you don t, then
you're basically in my corner, al
though I thought the band was fun.
The band's performance at the
Coffee House on Monday, Oct. 27
was mostly made up of songs off its
freshman effort, "tales of Raven,
Sparrow, and Cuckoo." Overall, it is
a nauseatingly peppy aJbum. Some
how, though, the Birdwatchers were
able to get a little cynic like me to tap
my feet and smile.
The band is made up of two
brothers, Josh (percussion, accor

dion) and Sam (bass) Burbank,
joined by fellow San Franciscan
Daniel Plock (guitar). Their pop
sound is dominated by Sam and
Daniel's high pitched harmonies,
while Josh alternates between
drums and accordion.
The group's CD is remarkably
polished for the young band, which
has only been together for two years.
The enthusiasm with which they
dive into live performances is prob
ably symbolic of the overall effort
they put into their music.
The show at the CoHo started
out slow, but that might have been
just as much a function of the crowd
as it was the band. As with any show
at a coffee bar, the crowd had to sep
arate those wanting to listen to the

music and those just there for the
mocha.
To be fair, though, the first two
songs were, at least in comparison to
the rest of its music, remarkably
mellow. And indistinct. I found the
group's voices really meshed solidly
for the first time during "Don't My
Away," the number nine track on
"tales." The drums really kicked in
for the first time, too, getting most
listeners' fingers to wag along to the
quick-tempo tune.
Sam then declared that we were
approaching "long john weather"
and that, in the spirit of winter, the
next couple of songs were "long
john music." Although I didn't quite
understand what that meant, I thor
oughly enjoyed "Out of My Body."

The song was good. And it was good
in a catchy, poppy, Beach Boys way
even with the accordion.
As quickly as the Birdwatchers
got me, they almost lost me. The
next pair of songs had repetitive
choruses and overall unimpressive
lyrics. In particular, "Ix:t Me Love,"
sung by Josh, annoyed me. It was
way too happy for me.
Somehow another happy song,
"Let Myself," got me back into the
performance — perhaps because
the baseline was more peppy than
sappy, perhaps because Josh wasn't
the lead vocalist in "l>et Myself" and
perhaps because "Let Myself" was
simply more polished (it is the num
ber four track on the CD). The audi
ence was beaming even after Dan's

failed attempt to get people clapping
during an a cappella hit of the song,
and the Birdwatchers kept the crowd
smiling until the end.
If you want to hear its sound,
"tales of Raven, Sparrow, and Cuck
oo" is the way to go. Be sure to listen
to the number four track.
If you want to hear my favorite
Birdwatchers jam, turn on track
11 and fast forward a minute.
During "It was Me," the third to
last song of the group's set, Sam
performed a solo on his bass and
sunk his teeth into it. While listen
ing to him — still crooning while
picking away — I decided that the
Birdwatchers werefun.
So if you're a little down in the
dumps, maybe Josh, Sam and Dan
can help you out. They will at least
get you to tap your feet.
