## LET THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL SHINE A LIGHT ON ME: Late Night's Original Rock and Roll Show 
### Zachary Roberts Editorial staff 
To the Generation X, live rock
and roll on late night television
is no big deal. Countless talk
shows host musical guests, and MTV,
VIII and TNN provide C-ration re
runs until dawn.
But on August 19, 1972, when " The
Midnight Special" was broadcast on the
National Broadcast Corporation at 1
a.m., the children of the '60s witnessed a
revolution in late night television.
To commemorate the show, B.R.
Hunter has released "The Midnight
Special," a 160-page coffee table book
that will probably spawn as many take
offs as Rolling Stone magazine did.
" The Midnight Special" is construct
ed methodically, starting with the 1972
pilot episode hosted by the late John
Denver. It then proceeds to detail specif
ic episodes on a chronological basis, giv
ing each show a two-page spread.
These spreads are impressive. At
least a dozen pictures of guests on each
show are included, often in sequence.
I lunter has included a short text that

describes each act; his segments are
brief but colorfully descriptive. They
accurately place the musicians within
the parabolas of both their own careers
and the history of the show. Although
his sentimentalism sometimes verges
on overkill, the book would be incom
plete without his nostalgic touch.
The diversity of individual
episodes is astonishing. Indeed, I am
at a loss for a ny other way to give a se
lection of the thousand of guests that
appeared on "The Midnight Special"
that would accurately represent the
musicians who appeared, other than
through the pilot episode. This
ranged from the gentle folk pop of
John Denver, Mama Cass and Harry
Chapin, to the heavy English rock of
Argent, to the sweet pop of Linda
Ronstadt and the Everly Brothers, to
the R&B of The Isley Brothers and
the reggae-rock act War.
The book is designed to be
groovy, not psychedelic, but the line
between the two gets blurred more
than once. The gentle fades between
colors, and the repetitive dot designs
have a '70s disco-and-cocaine feel,
but many of the stars who graced the

show's stage had been spawned of
'60s rock-and-LSD. Those two eras
are juxtaposed both in the design of
the book and the story of the show
to create a tension that becomes
specifically addressed in several of
Hunter's textual segments.
It is clear from the details that a
lot of thought and passion went
into this book. At the back is an
index that not only lists the host
and performers of all 423 episodes
(95 of which were reruns), it gives
each song played by each artist, in
the order of the show.
Unfortunately, the spreads of
the book are heavily weighted to
wards the earlier years of the
show's existence. There are 12
episodes of 1972 detailed, 10 of
1974, six of'7s and '76, five of' 77,
'78, '79 and '80, and only four of
the 1981 episodes receive spreads.
Ideally, all 328 original shows
would receive the same care and
attention; although such a tome
would clearly be unwieldy, and
perhaps financially unfeasible,
"The Midnight Special" deserves
it. The love will not fade away.
