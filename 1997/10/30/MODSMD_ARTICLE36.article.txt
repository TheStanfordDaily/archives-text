# Headcrash: Don a skin suit and enter a video game as
## 
### Angela Lee Contributing writer 
What a trip! Bruce Bethke, the
man who coined the temi 'cy
berpunk,' has written a hilari
ous novel about one computer user's wild
adventures in cyberspace. "Headcrash"
thins the boundaries between virtual and
real reality in mind-blowing ways that may
become possible within a few years.
Winner of the Phillip K. Dick award,
"Headcrash" details the adventures of
young programmer Jack Burroughs, a
lowly peon in a large, mindless corpora
tion, who is about to lose his job. Free
lancing, he finds himself working as an
industrial spy in a virtual reality reminis
cent of a Dungeons and Dragons game..
. only it's the real thing.
This is fantasy in a way that might
actually come true. Bethke's vision of
virtual reality is one dreamed of by
many users, where all reality and all
sensations can be experienced in cy
berspace. How would you create
yourself if you could use a computer
to sculpt your physical appearance?
What if you had a super interface
that allowed you to taste, see, touch,
smell and even have sex online?
Would reality pale by comparison?
Jack's virtual alter ego, Max_Kool,

is everything that lack is
not — handsome, cool
and swaggering in his
black leather outfit. He
proudly rides a low
slung Harley motorcy
cle on the Infoßahn.
The character Inge,
whose virtual ego turns
out to be totally unex
pected, summed up her
decision to carve out her
character like this: "We
get to be what we
aren't... You get to be
hip. And me? 1 get to be
someone who really
could pack a suitcase full
of bearer bonds and hop
a plane to the Cayman
Islands! So why am I
doing this? Because I
wanted to see if I could
get away with it! lust
once, 1 wanted to do
something wild! Some
thing that 'nice little
Inge' would never in a
million years even think
of doing! And let me tell
you something, lack. IT
FEELS GOOD!"
Bethke's prose is bit
ingly funny, with its satir-

ic barbs at corporate life and
non-users. The plot is straight
forward and compelling, and
the dialogue is clipped and
crazy, a la Monty Python.
There are ample digs at spe
cial interest groups and polit
ical correctness. Bethke
writes of "the Portly Person's
Liberation Front crusading
for radical door enlarge
ment" in one example. Fven
funnier is a dialogue of the
tremendous speculation
caused by a new hire; "A mi
nority woman?. .. Nah, plain
black is passe. I'm betting
they found us a Haitian les
bian. .. You mean a disabled
Haitian lesbian... I mean a
disabled war veteran Haitian
lesbian, with a prison record
and a terminal disease."
Bethke, like many program
mers, has fun with words. One
chapter is titled, "Disaster
Strikes," the next — "Disaster
Fouls One Back Into the
Stands." The book is written in
the form of a World Wide Web
page containing asides that
Bethke coyly calls I nfonuggets.
Jack complains how they are
"a pain in the ass to code," yet

Bethke keeps writing them in, playfull
granting little bits of background infor
mation to keep readers up to speed,
Bethke also has his readers playin
along with hiin. He even inserts a for
gettable little coupon in an infonuggc
box, to which he refers 12 chapter
later, and I found myself checking t<
see if it really was there!
"Headcrash" is a great fast read. I wa
drawn into ever more grandiose adven
tures as Jack spends more time in virtu.i
reality, to the point where, at the end, hi
finds himself wishing he were then
rather than in his real life. Written in th<
form of a memoir of his own betrayal
the book outlines his life from the start o
his downfall at the faceless company U
his travails as a freelance hacker, t0...
very different life. You'll have to read th<
book to find out his eventual, and per
haps not unenviable, fate.
In cyberspace, you can create at
alter-ego to fit those ambitions tha
you can't achieve in real time. But o
the other denizens of cyberspace, whi
can you trust? Who are they in reality
Are their alter egos anything like theii
real selves? Is cyberspace an escapt
from reality? You could have wild vir
tual sex, but who really is your sex part
ner? And do you really need the excite
ment of a virtual life, or should yoi
just go out and get a real one?
