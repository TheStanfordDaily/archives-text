# A 						FEW GOOD THRILLS
## The 						3-D World of Terror in San Jose

(C 112 | exhibit is an authentic

Thus reads the warning at the front of
the line to this year's World of Terror IX,
the largest haunted house in the
A .1' LI

country, which happens to be
at the Pavilion in San j

Jose. After the two
hour wait in line,

it's a 10-
minute
thrill that «

rattles
all of
your J

senses. It's especially acute this year, due
to the addition of 3-D special effects.
Unlike in a classical haunted house,
you don't actually walk through rooms.
Rather, you pass through "areas" parti
tioned by cardboard walls.
From the moment you enter the
World of Terror, the 3-D action is in ef
fect: devils jump out at you from the
sides of these partitions. From there you
enter a maze of rooms depicting the
more gorier scenes from famous '80s
horror movies, like "Halloween" and
"Friday the 13th."
The "scenes," which

are like large dio
ramas with real
people, are staffed
by volunteer ac
tors who moan in
pain, ask you for
blood, or cry out
for help. None of

this is particularly frightening, but each
one makes for an interesting sight. It's
entertaining to discover what the plan
ners thought up next.
As you walk through the labyrinth,
staffers jump out of corners and scream
in your face. Meanwhile, the people in
front of you and behind you are experi
encing similar surprises, so everyone is
screaming, while theme songs from the
aforementioned horror movies play in
the background. This is by far the scariest
aspect of the event, because you are al
ways wondering who or what is lurking
around

the next corner.
The 3-D effect re
ally does work, unlike
other shows where
the claim "3-D"
means that you pay
more money to
watch a show with
cardboard glasses that
do nothing for you.
Here, "3-D" means
that while you walk
from one diorama to
the next, creatures
look as though they
have passed through
the walls and are actu
ally there next to you.

So it's not particularly terrifying, but
the show is well worth the 12 bucks just
to see what the people will come up with
next. When it s all over, you end up at the
ground fl<x>r of the Pavilion. Fade back
to reality; the music, screaming, gory im
ages and 3-D are gone.

But the fun's not over yet:
there's even a "Star Tours"-

like film series called "The
t Edge." I thought, "Oh,

great, a haunted
house and a ride,
I too?" So I shelled

L out the two
fl> bucks to see

"Dracula's
Haunted
House," a
[ four-
I minute
I film in
I which the
seats move
so you feel
as though
■ you are

rm o v i n g
through the
house.
But these

r seats move so
much they leave

m
' your back sore,

and the movie is

basically a rip-off of
Disneyland's Haunted

House, which you've
probably already been to at

least once anyway, '["hey try to
make it look as though you are in one

of those carriages at the Disneyland ver
sion, and they even show similar scenes
of ghosts feasting and merrymaking at a
ball.

Two dollars and a 20-minute wait
seem too steep for an attraction that's
only four minutes long.
