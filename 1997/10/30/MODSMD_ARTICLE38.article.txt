## A
						night at “The Oval” 
### Alex Tung staff writer Alex Tung 
Tucked away next to the Stanford Eat
ng Clubs outside Toyon Hall on the west
ide of campus, Stanford Cable Broadcast
;ig Network pounds out signals until 2
.m. every night, unbeknownst to a major
ly of the Stanford community.
Now a closed circuit channel in the
tanford University Network (SUNet),
.CBN broadcasts movies and student
>roduced shows to a campus-wide audi
ence and boasts a total of about 75 mem
>ers who write, direct and produce a vari
ety of different shows.
>CBN: Past and Present
The station started 13 years ago as X
IV and attempted to serve as a pirate TV
station, according to this year's station
manager, senior Tudor Havriliuc. Eventu
ally the station got a cable channel through
SUNet but didn't have much to broadcast.
I'here was a single student production that
an quarterly, but that wasn't enough for
the station to get noticed.
SCBN has been outside the Hating
Clubs for three years now, having moved
from cramped quarters in a back room of
the Women's Center. The current studio
was vacant office space for student groups,
but because it wasn't being used, the Uni
versity allowed SCBN move in. Staffing
the place was just "a matter of bringing in
friends," Havriliuc said.
Last year things started turning around
for SCBN. Teleflicks increased the sta
tion's popularity, and many students
came in with proposals for shows. I)epart -
merits were created within the station, and
a semblance of an organizational structure
came into being.
In the fall of 1996 the studio had a mea
ger program list, yielding one student
show, "SCBN Live," which entailed the
use of two chairs and two cameras for
filming a host and a guest, most notably
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo.
Early this year more shows came in, in
cluding "Nite Chat," a talk show that fea
tures Stanford "stars;" "The Oval," a
sketch-comedy show in the same vein as
"Saturday Night Live;" "Love Links," a
play off of "The Dating Game;" and "It's
All Good," a cooking show starring
French House cook Steven Reuben. This
quarter, a new show will be added called
"Critic," a game show in which contes
tants give two-minute arguments stating
why the movie was enjoyable or not. The
best argument wins.
Last year, SCBN received its special fee
from the ASSU for the first time, mosdy
due to student approval of Teleflicks. The
station used the money to buy a digital
video mixer, a new set that volunteers built
over the summer and some new Sony
camcorders. The technical crew is cur
rently working on building a dubbing sta
tion with a bunch of linked VCRs, so the
station can copy tapes of shows and cam
pus events for whomever may want them.

Although the station received close to
$40,000 from the ASSU, according to
Havriliuc, that amount is not very much.
Compared to the average local television
station with an audience of about 14,000
and a budget around $2 million, SCBN
doesn't have much to work with.
Still, it doesn't take a lot of money to
have fun. The audience sits upstairs in the
studio, but that area also doubles as a gath
ering place for SCBNers who get bored in
their dorms and want to come to the stu
dio to watch some movies or just hang out.
"We're proud of our lack of hierarchy
here," Havriliuc said. "We're all friends, so
it's more like a family business."
As station manager Havriliuc plugs in
tapes and generally makes sure things run
smoothly at the station. He said he spends
about 30 to 35 hours a week at the station.
There are about 75 people working on dif
ferent shows, but there's a core of about 30
people who work on all the shows, Havril
iuc said.
The studio draws in all types, including
those interested in drama and economics,
as well as communications. "We are the
only way that communications majors
can have hands-on experience," he said.
"Even the undergrad Communications
Department doesn't provide opportuni
ties to work in a studio."
Still, Havirlius notes, it's hard to excite
new interest.
"It's hard to recruit for the station,
since it doesn't lead directly to a career,"
Havriliuc said, "but we're all together

doing stuff."
The shows
Most of the shows are weekly because
of the amount of time each takes to put to
gether. They are fresh, exciting and ex
ploding with a kind of energy rarely seen
on television.
The Oval
Definitely one of the wackiest shows on
SCBN, "The Oval" is a sketch-comedy se
ries that airs live every Friday at 9 p.m.

Producer and founder of the show, senior
Sam Park said that this is the "only show
on SCBN that is purely entertainment
based."
In the same vein of "Saturday Night
Live" and "Monty Python's Flying Cir
cus," some of the humor on the show is
conventional, while the rest is completely

absurd. One sketch last year had Leo Tol
stoy hosting a talk show about punk rock
and another had a woman giving birth to
historical documents and basketballs.
"The sketches are really smart," Park
said. "We could do dumb humor,we but
choose not to."
The show started last spring, airing just

six episodes. Writing takes place early in
the week, and rehearsals go throughout.
"It's intensive, but it's a lot of fun and a lot
of crazy things happen," Park said.
Many of the crazy things that happen
are due to the show being filmed live.
"There's tension when people forget
lines," Park said, "but we almost hope that
things will go wrong; that's part of the en
joyment of the show. People get crazy and
improvise and ad-lib. There's just a huge
amount of energy."
Park created the show last year, mosdy
out of necessity. "There's really no oudet

for comedic writ
ing besides Gai
eties," he said. "1
had done some
theater, and I
knew a lot of
funny people. 1
just love comedy
and being
around comedy
and funny peo
ple, so 1 guess
that's sort of my
own selfishness,
too."
When asked
about the writ
ers' inspiration,
Park said, "The
humor comes
from their own
demented psy
ches. We have a
group of deeply
disturbed peo
ple, but the show

is therapeutic for them; it's a way for them
to channel their destructive energies. It's
really reflective of who are interested in
humor at Stanford Whoever's doing
comedy at Stanford is somehow involved
in The Oval.'"
The Call-in Show
Another popular show is "The (all-in
Show," which airs right before the 11 p.m.
Teleflicks movie on Saturdays. The show,
hosted by Havriliuc, gathers votes for the
11 p.m. movie. It also includes a feature
guest, usually a department manager of
Stanford Student Enterprises, which spon
sors Teleflicks. Viewers can call the studio
to cast their votes for the movie of their
choice and talk to the guest and host on the
air.
Calls to the show aren't screened, be
cause the studio doesn't have the capability
to employ a five-second delay and bleep
out obscenities. "At times we get drunks at
parties or whatever, and we have no way of
controlling what they say," said sopho
more Brian Karimzad, producer of the
show. "As producer, though, I encourage
the staff to use clean language."
In addition to the featured guest, each
show also includes reports on community
events and short news stories, produced by
the news department. These segments may
be used as a"

springboard into
the development
of a separate news
show in the fu
ture, Havriliuc
said.
Like the
other shows on
SCBN, this one is
all about fun. "I
enjoy doing it,
and it's kind of
my pet project,"
Karimzad said.
"We're not a pro
fessional crew, so
the quality of the
show changes
every week — but
that makes it fun
to watch."

Nite Chat
Joining the late night lineup is "Nite
Chat," which airs every Thursday at 9:30
p.m. "We wanted to bring something new
and entertaining and exciting to Stanford
TV," said host and founder of the show,
Peter Szeremi. "We also wanted to give
people something to watch between Sein
feld and ER."
Unlike other shows on SCBN, "Nite
Chat" is not recorded at the Eating Clubs
studio but at a public access studio in Palo
Alto. "We wanted a professional quality
show," said Szeremi, "so we decided to film
it off-campus in a professional studio."
The show is meant to feature "exciting,
interesting people at Stanford," including
professors, students and graduates. The
premiere, which airs tonight, will host
Bruce Gibney, co-editor in chief of the
Stanford Review, Jesse Oxfeld, former
Daily staff member, and Huatchye Lim, a
14-year-old freshman from Brazil and the
youngest student in Stanford history.
Other guests slated for later shows include
former Secretary of Defense William Perry
and Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo.
Critic
"Critic" 's basic premise is that anyone
can be a movie critic, but not everyone can
do it well. Senior Nkomo Morris produces
this movie game show, noting that contes
tants must have "a quick mind, a quick
tongue and the ability to argue."
Contestants can be anyone from the
Stanford community, including faculty,
staff and students. Contestants are sent to
free press screenings of movies and are told
to watch with as critical an eye as possible,
according to Morris. They are then
brought on the show and told to argue for
or against the movie — they don't know
which sideuntil the show starts — in a two
minute slot. A weekly judge decides who
makes the better argument, and that per
son wins prizes from the show's sponsors.
Some of the prizes include free readings
from astrologer Amber Flynn (which, be
lieve it or not, usually run about $ 150 a ses
sion), gift certificates from the Stanford
Bookstore and Blockbuster Music and
samples from Nantucket Nectars.
Morris came up with the idea after a
regular movie review show idea created too
many scheduling conflicts, due to the un
wieldy timing of some press screenings. "I
thought that the only way to make sure
people could make the screenings was to
open it up to more people," Morris said,
"and the way I thought of to do that was to
turn it into a game show."
It's All Ciood
Julia Child and Yan Can Cook can
move over, because "It's All Good" is the
next show to take on the intricacies of the
cooking world, and it does it Stanford -
style.
French House and Haus Mitt cook
Steve Reuben spices up the airwaves with
cooking demos and "culinary clips" every
Saturday at 9 p.m. The show mixes cooking
demonstrations with clips of scenes from
movies that have to do with food or cook
ing, along with a dash of music and humor.
"What I enjoy about the show is that
we're doing something constructive and
around that something funny can come

out, so there's no pressure to specifically
make it funny," Reuben said.
The show began in May last year with
three episodes, and this year, under the
guidance of alumnus Trevor Gattis, who is
the director of the show this year and was
general technical director for SCBN last
year as a senior, Reuben and company
hope to put out 10 new shows. Although
Reuben himself is not a student, others in
volved in the show are.
"I'm just totally enjoying |the show),
and it's been a great adventure," Reuben
said. "It's entertaining, and I've heard it's
funny... We understand that a lot of Stan
ford students don't necessarily have time to
watch TV, so we're not really concerned
about getting an audience; we're just con
cerned with making a good product."
The Future of SCBN
With all these shows running, SCBN is
still lacking in viewership, however. "We
need to advertise SCBN more, but it's hard
[to get viewers) because a lot of people
don't have TVs in their rooms, and that's
why we get mostly grad students watch
ing," Havriliuc said.
Still, as is evidenced by the approval of
special fees last year, the station's populari
ty is growing among undergraduates, and
this is good for SCBN. "We can tell by who
calls the call-in show how the demography
of our viewership is changing, and right
now it's going toward more undergrads."
The station is growing stronger than
ever and hopes to gain more help from the
University in achieving its long term goals.
Station members are planning to lobby the
University to build a specific place for the
studio, as other universities have for their
stations, Havriliuc said. "[ The current lo
cation | was not meant to be a studio. The
electric wiring doesn't support all of our
equipment, and we sometimes have fuses
blowing in the middle of a show."
Still, station members seem to be happy
with the way things are going for S(>BN de
spite these difficulties. Karimzad said, "I
think the studio has made a 180 degree turn
from the direction it was going last year."
Morris, who has been involved with
SCBN since her freshman year, said, "I
watched the station grow from no one
doing anything to a lot of people doing a lot
of things.... It's a lot of work, but it's a
shame that there aren't more people doing
shows, because there are a lot of people at
this school who would be good at it."
Havriliuc envisions a stronger, more
professional SCBN: "In my mind my
Utopia would be a nice, professional studio,
with studio cameras, a control room and
funding from the University, so we don't
have to beg the students for money. In ad
dition to financial independence, I'd like to
see all sorts of shows on, including a news
program. The Daily comes out every day
and people read through it, so why can't
everyone switch on SCBN everyday for a
couple minutes, just to see what's going
on?"
But for now, Havriliuc and the rest of
the SCBN crew will settle for just having
fun. "I worked for CNN this summer but I
didn't like it very much, because there was
a lot of competition.... This is really en
joying what you do."
