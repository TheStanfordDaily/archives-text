## Another Girl In the Galaxy 
### 
The most impressive thing about "In
the Galaxy" is that someone had the
balls (or rather, ovaries) to allow the
general public to have access to this.
Once again, we in the world are
faced with someone who clearly has a
great musical sense and absolutely
nothing to say. This translates into
repetitive lyrics, no subject matter and a

beat made for head nodding.
"Another Girl" is Lynne Kellman
and a 36-track makeshift studio in
her apartment. Each song is very
solid and steady and the unfortu
nate work of one mind only.
Her voice grows tiresome and
sounds babyish. Her lyrics flaunt the
lack of depth in her song writing

process. Her lyrics flaunt the
lack of depth in her song writing
process. Her lyrics flaunt the
lack of depth in her song writing
process. You get the point?
This is how Lynne Kell
man writes songs. She even
said so in an article in Song
writer's Monthly: "I begin
with a hook that I came up
with and that I like, one that I
can't put out of my mind."
And then she uses that
"hook" over and over again
in different permutations
that are not different enough
to justify the repetition.
In one song, she says "Don't
you know I would do anything
for you!" no fewer than 16 times
in a row. And that's only at the
very end of the song. 1 didn't
bother to count how many times
she said it per verse.
In the literature that you
many find and read about
Ms. Kellman, you will learn
that she did all of the guitar
ing, violining, bassing,
singing, whining, angsting
and all. That's great. But
that's not enough.
There are three good
songs on the album: "Grow
ing Gold," "Sometimes"
and the second version of
"Anything for You." The
first version of "Anything
For You," "Do You Want
Me To" and"The Day After
Xmas" are good to listen to
for laughs. The rest of the
album is poor.
Lynne Kellman needs to get a
band. She needs to collaborate.
She needs to use her aptitude for
finding tunes and playing in
struments and creating moods
to embellish songs that she has
written with someone else's
help. She needs to mature as a
songwriter. When she has done
all of those things, she will be
very much da bomb.
Until then, she's like Sting
without The Police. Except
bad.
