## Ethiopian Jews discuss travails in panel 
### Gaurav Misra 
Four black Jews originally from Ethiopia
talked about their life stories, their experiences
in the United States and their opinions on
racial tolerance yesterday at the Law School.
The panel discussion was part of the "Chil
dren of the Dream" project, organized by the
Anti-Defamation League to further racial un
derstanding between minorities and Jews in
the United States. Most students are unaware
that Jews of non-European backgrounds exist,
and the program is designed to "shatter stereo
types about Jews and Judaism," said Emeri

Handler, a representative of the organization.
Three of the four speakers — ail high school
students in Israel — were brought to Israel dur
ing the l l >S4 Operation Moses, which brought
more than N.(HK) Ethiopian Jews from Sudan to
Israel. Because the Ethiopian government
would not let Jews leave the country, they had
to escape into Sudan before being airlifted to
Jerusalem by Israel.

water. They often had to walk bare
loot while fending off robbers and
wild animals. Sahalo lost a sister to a
fever during the journey because
they did not have the resources to
keep up her health; Yitzhak also lost
his mother to the trek.
"I saw many people die along the
way," Levi said.
Despite their travails, Yitzhak
said they couldn't return to the per
secution they faced in their home
land.
"We knew that we were strong
enough, and we knew that we
mustn't give up," Yitzhak ex
plained.
The fourth student, Ora Kassay,
was born in Israel. Her parents came
to Israel seeking something better
than their farming life in Ethiopia.
Kassay's mother made the trip to Is

rael while seven months pregnant
with Kassay.
Students attending the discussion
were impressed with what they
heard. "It's amazing that they're
here and that they've come all this
way," said law student David Walk
er. "Their story is a true testament to
peoples' hearts and courage."
The plight of the Ethiopian Jews
has not received much attention
worldwide, Handler said.
In Ethiopia, small Jewish com
munities, mostly in villages, were
surrounded by larger, intolerant re
ligious groups. "We had to keep our
traditions and our holidays secret
ly," Sahalo said.
According to all of the students,
the persecuted Jews did not have
many places to go. In 19K4 the Is
raelis established ()peralion Moses,
a massive effort to help the Jews
win) had managed lo escape
Ethiopia. This was followed up in
1991 by Operation Solomon, which

rescued more than 14,000 Ethiopian
Jews from Addis Ababa. Ethiopia's
capital.
Handler said that Operation
Solomon was the inspiration for the
"( hildren of the Dream" project.
Bill Lambert, a member of the
Anti-Defamation League board in
Los Angeles and the Los Angeles
Teachers' Union, was watching a
documentary on Operation
Solomon in 1991. He decided that
bringing some of the Ethiopian Jews
over to the United States would help
reduce racial tensions among Jews
and minority groups in the Los An
geles area.
Soon, groups of teen-age
Ethiopian Jews were coming to the
I Jnited States annually to meet with
local high school students and pre
sent their stories. Each year, a select
group of high school students ex
posed to the program visit Israel to
see the lives of their new friends
firsthand.
