## Ethiopian Jews discuss travails in panel 
### Gaurav Misra 
Four black Jews originally from Ethiopia
talked about their life stories, their experiences
in the United States and their opinions on
racial tolerance yesterday at the Law School.
The panel discussion was part of the "Chil
dren of the Dream" project, organized by the
Anti-Defamation League to further racial un
derstanding between minorities and Jews in
the United States. Most students are unaware
that Jews of non-European backgrounds exist,
and the program is designed to "shatter stereo
types about Jews and Judaism," said Emeri

Handler, a representative of the organization.
Three of the four speakers — ail high school
students in Israel — were brought to Israel dur
ing the l l >S4 Operation Moses, which brought
more than N.(HK) Ethiopian Jews from Sudan to
Israel. Because the Ethiopian government
would not let Jews leave the country, they had
to escape into Sudan before being airlifted to
Jerusalem by Israel.
