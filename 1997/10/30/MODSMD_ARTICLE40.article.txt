# Marillion
## This Strange Engine 
### 
Venerable British art-rockers
Marillion have long led a double
life, selling out 10,000 seat arenas
in Europe while — virtually ig
nored on this side of the pond—
they play sweaty clubs to their
rabid American cult following.
How rabid? Earlier this year,
due to large losses on previous
North American tours, Marillion
announced they would not be
coming to the United States. In
response, their fans raised
$50,000 to bring them here. This
fine album goes a long way to
ward justifying such fanatical de
votion.
With a melodic, atmospheric
and occasionally majestic
sound, Marillion straddles the
musically territory of, alternate
ly, Rush and Enya. Vocalist
Steve Hogarth sings the intelli
gent yet highly emotional lyrics
in a soaring tenor above a sensu
ous, complex wall of sound.
The album opens in trademark
Marillion fashion with the an
themic "Man of a Thousand
Faces," which builds from a subtle
acoustic opening to a roaring
symphonic maelstrom. Borrow
ing from Joseph Campbell's theo
ries of universal mvth

(that every culture has
similar myths in different
guises), "Man of a Thou
sand Faces" manages the
difficult trick of being pro
found while avoiding pre
tentiousness. Its subject
matter is as amazing as its
complex sonic acrobatics.
Following the pleasant
ballad "One Fine Day"and
the Crowded House-ish "80
Days," the album builds to
another climax with the
achingly gorgeous "Esto-

<H nia." A heartfelt meditation on
death, "Estonia" belies its sub
ject matter with an uplifting tone
more cathartic than any gloomy
dirge: "No one leaves you / When
they live in your heart and
mind / And no one dies / They just
move to the other side."
The second half of the album
showcases Marillion's remarkable
musical vocabulary. The band goes
from the stately strings-and-vocal
arrangement "Memory of Water,"
to the fiery Police-inflected rocker
"An Accidental Man," to a tongue
in-cheek calypso tune, "Hope for
the Future." However, these are
merely enjoyable warm-ups to the
album's conclusion and focal piece,
the 15-minute title track.
"This Strange Engine" tells the
somewhat tragic story of Hogarth's
childhood against a musical palette
that encompasses everything Maril
lion has done over its 15-year histo
ry. Its length, as well as Marillion's
frequent use of loud and soft dy
namics and shifting time signatures
make it more symphonic than rock.
It coheres wonderfully, though and
builds toward an explosive, almost
primal finale that neatly summa
rizes Marillion's appeal: music that
is good for the heart and the head.
