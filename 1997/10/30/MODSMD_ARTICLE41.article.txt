# CONAN O'BRIEN: LIVE FROM 6A
## 
### 
Various Artists
When I first saw this CD, I was psyched to hear Conan O'Brien
singing or saying funny stuff or something. It turns out that the
album has very little to do with Conan O'Brien at all, other than
that all the performers appeared on the big red-haired man's show.
"Live from 6A" brings together different artists, in the same
vein as MTV's "Unplugged" series. They range from the "voodoo"
rock of David Bowie to artists like Squirrel Nut Zippers and Edwin
Collins. Although the album doesn't sport the golden voice of
Conan O'Brien, it's still an eclectic mix of strong performances.
Ani DiFranco starts the set with "Shameless," featuring her signa
ture scratchy vocals and quickly undulating guitar part. The song

has a lot of energy and moves quickly with a strong, forceful beat.
David Bowie puts in a solid rendition of "Dead Man Walking,"
hut it's a soft, sullen tune, like a song Neil Young would do with
extra whine. Bowie loses some of his grating '80s glamrock sound
in this one, but that's something I can deal without.
In fact, Edwyn Collins' "A Girl Like You" comes closer to tradi
tional Bowie than even Bowie does, but the repetitive chorus and
annoying guitar-laser sound effects probably won't carry him past
this one-hit wonder.
The album boasts a lot of famous names, but only a few actual
ly perform their more famous songs. On occasion this can be good
exposure for new material, but in this case, it was a relief to come
to Bjork's "Human Behavior" and Cake's "The Distance."
Each of these performers comes off well live, although Bjork
sounds a bit like she's losing her voice and doesn't have as much
power to her singing as she exudes on her albums. Cake, on the

other hand, is not lacking in energy, they strike with plenty offeree,
with the familiar rapping not missing a heat.
Another fast-paced, funked-out group, Jamiroquai pre
sents a very danceable "When You Gonna Learn," but "Virtu
al Insanity" flashbacks are hard to avoid while listening to this
one. The group is surprisingly together live, although the song
is not all that interesting in terms of melody.
Squirrel Nut Zippers definitely has the best name of any band
on the album, and their track "Lover's Lane" is also the most fun,
combining some kind of swing / ska / latin beat with a'3os barber
shop sound.
The album brings together a strange brew of different styles, but
the play list really is more impressive than the performances. And
Conan, if this is a publicity stunt, try including yourself in the pro
duction next time.
