There's a revolution going on — a
revolution known as Neo-Soul,
which is raining down on the world
of music. Fronted by artists like
Erykah Badu, D'Angelo and
Maxwell, Neo-Soul's quiet storm has
a new warm-hearted weatherman in
Rahsaan Patterson.
His self-titled debut on MCA is an
expressive journey that, while a plea
sure on the ears, proved two things:
Patterson is a gifted songwriter, and
the man begs more than Keith Sweat.
Patterson gets props for propping
up his songs with gooey lyrics guar
anteed to supply men with enough
pick-up lines to last a lifetime. "Stop
By" is an open invitation lined with a
groovy bass and has Patterson, with
an Eric Benet inflection, crooning
"The sun shines much
brighter / Now that you've come my
way."
Droning violins elongate the
tempo of "Spend the Night" as Pat
terson pledges to "Satisfy all your
achin' wants and needs." He bottoms
out his voice for "Where You Are,"

from the soundtrack of the movie
Bulletproof, a do-all-l can-to-get
there staple with a folk feel.
The real soul power is in "Can't
We Wait a Minute." The elegant bal
lad approaches on tiptoes, a flutter of
violins and violas. Patterson leaps
into a vocal prance and then tiptoes
out again, wanting to take it slow, be
cause "For the first time /1 feel like
I'm in love." His Babyface-esque high
notes are sure to make you think of
your first time, or just make you wish
you had one.
There is a much-needed thematic
switch in the sneaky "Come Over,"
where Patterson entices a taken
woman over the strums of a sitar.
Filled with ooh's and mmm's, "So
Fine" is Patterson playing with a bevy
of vocal ranges, from Prince's peak
pitch to Barry White's bassed out
boom.
Irony rears its head in "One More
Night." The opening line is "I can't
understand why you're leaving me"
Hell, I can't either; the man finally
gets the girl, and she's gonna make
him beg for one more night?
Patterson eventually gets revenge
in "Tears Ago." Buckets of tears take
the place of lost years, and he tells his

heartbreaker, "You want me
now / But it's too late."
According to the press release,
"The eye of this musical hurricane
is the voice of Rahsaan: artful, ex
pressive, inherently soulful." After
the storm, Patterson emerges as a
vocal force capturing strains of one
of his influences, the great Stevie
Wonder.
As a talented artist, Patterson
proves himself, co-penning and
carrying the vocal arrangement on
most of the collection. He has
cooked up palatable soul food that
is filling for a quiet Sunday after
noon or for making out on a sultry
Saturday night.
Patterson sets up the experience
of the album as a progression, a
play-by-play of his earthy mack
style. He begins wooing and want
ing and yearning. It builds, as he
gets what he thinks he's looking for.
A few heartaches later, fed up with
love and loss, Patterson finally sets
his "Soul Free."
A word to Patterson: Brother
man, you got the chops. Next time,
peep your predecessors and vary
the thematic angle.
