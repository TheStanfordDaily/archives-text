# The
						Verve Urban Hymns
## 
### 
The Verve's newest opus opens with a tri
umphant linking of past and future rock, anil
the band positions itself squarely in betwixt
'to mind the gap.'
Opening with a symphonic sample of a
Rolling Stones' song, "Bittersweet Sympho
ny" rings out boldly as a vigorous assertion of
The Verve's return to the music scene. In a
chilling reminder of their earlier years,
though, offstage developments threaten The
Verve's future: the Rolling Stones have a law
suit pending.
But singer Richard Ashcroft, ever the self
possessed front man, is nonplused by the law
suit. In the press packet, he states, "I'm not bit
ter about it, money ain't everything but credit
is important, where it's due, an' Jagger and
Richards haven't written a tune as good as that
for f* king 20 years."
Ashcroft's attitude portrays at once both
his grandfather's idealistic tutelage and the
band's.harrowing days in the early '90s, re
plete with drug addictions and bizarre off
stage mishaps. Consequently, the songs are
paeans to idealism that are tinged with sharp
reminders of reality; on "Sonnet," he sings,
"Yes there's love if you want it / Don't sound
like a sonnet."
From lead guitarist Nick McCabe's blues
riffs on "Sonnet," to the Beastie Boys-esque
opening of "The Rolling People" and ending
with the psychedelia of "Velvet Morning,
"Urban Hymns" finds The Verve hewing
songs from a melange of styles. At times they

want to be Pink Floyd, but the beat is wrong,
just as they try to be urban, but the beat is
wrong.
Within songs, the band is unafraid to mix
different elements in schizophrenic juxtaposi
tions. "Velvet Morning" opens with a woeful
slide gliss on electric guitar, and Ashcroft's vo
cals bespeak a shattered dream. Yet, the song
builds with the bridge, "Into the lamp
light / Another velvet morning for me / Yeah"
and climaxes with an uplifting chorus in dou
ble time.
The rather prevalent strings reveal the
band members' facility in the studio. Unfor
tunately, the band rarely utilizes such power
ful tools to propel the song forward. Similarly,
the inclusion of textures from the I-ondon
urban dance scene are often competing with
the songs themselves and hampering the ulti
mate effect.
The band's working relationship with
Oasis and the (Jallagher brothers can be felt
at times. Although The Verve approaches
this influence with trepidation, it resonates
loudly iii "I.ucky Man." The future single
potential of "Space and Time" also hints at
Oasis.
On first listen, the band's British sound is
intriguing. My the second time, however, the
sense of mystery has been lost. "Urban
Hymns" has been relegated to the back
ground music bin.
Still, throughout the album The Verve
claims full musical identity for itsalchemiesof
pop and realism, and rock and urban ele
ments. The ever present, heavily effected gui
tars create a soundscape that, at times reduces
the songs to random noise, but always re
mains uniquely ofThe Verve.
