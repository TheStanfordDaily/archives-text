## A 						Life Less Ordinary 
### 
Judging by the
title, it seems
clear that the

filmmakers behind "A Life Less Ordinary"
were attempting to make a film that was, well,
less ordinary. Coming from the Danny Boyle-
Andrew MacDonald director / producer
team behind "Trainspotting," that's not sur
prising. However, with this movie they were
starting out with more Hollywood main
stream plotlines, and as a result, go over the
top trying to be random and unusual for the
sake of being random and unusual. Unfortu
nately, these efforts don't succeed and get in
the way of the characters and the story.
The road-movie plot gives the film its
mainstream nature. Ewan McGregor plays
Robert, the recently fired janitor at the end of
his rope. He kidnaps the boss's spoiled daugh
ter, Celine (Cameron Diaz). The two head for

the hills and fall in love along the way.
Although Hollywood ScreenwritinglOl
would dictate that these two kids are on a
one-way track to screen bliss, in this film the
heavenly higher-ups aren't so sure. Dis
tressed by the rising divorce and sinking hap
piness rates on earth, two angels are dis
patched to make sure that Celine and Robert
don't evade Cupid's arrow. The angels (Holly
Hunter and Delroy Lindo) not-so-logically
decide that the best way to engineer the
match is to pose as bounty hunters, stalking
and shooting at the couple. Thus begins the
path to weirdness. Hunter is especially
bizarre, employing a high and breathy voice
that grates on the nerves.
The first three-fourths of the film is for the
most part wonderful. It succeeds in being less
ordinary than the average romantic road
movie 4 la "Excess Baggage" and allows Mc-

Gregor and Diaz to be very funny. McGregor is
especially fantastic, putting his facial expres
sions to comic use and charming Diaz even
with some of the worst hair ever seen in recent
cinema — think "The Partridge Family" but
more hair spray. The best and most watchable
aspects of the film are found in the least visual
ly innovative moments when the two charac
ters have down-to-earth interactions.
The last half hour completely ignores Ce
line and Robert and hones in on the angels'
ever more ridiculous escapades. Just at the
point where the film seems like it will resolve
on a comprehensible level, Boyle decides in
stead to dazzle the viewer with odd tricks, like
having Diaz and McGregor face out of the
screen, ostensibly talking to each other, while
clips from the last two hours of the film flick
er behind their heads. Ugh.
It is admirable to see the filmmakers ex
ploring their creativity and trying to be origi
nal. But it just doesn't work here. The audi
ence is alienated from the characters, and
rather than a cohesive transition to the won
derfully bizarre, Boyle throws in tricks that

look strange, but aren't actually saying any
thing new. His two lead actors and script were
doing a fine job of portraying less ordinary
lives without heavenly or flashy directorial in
tervention.
