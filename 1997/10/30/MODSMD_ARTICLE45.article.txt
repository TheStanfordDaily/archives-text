The artsy black-humor film
" The House of Yes" turned
out to be an unfortunately se
rious picture. Considering the
story, I can only hope that the film
makers were trying to make a funny
film based on outrageously uncon
ventional premises. If this is the
case, they largely failed because the
humor isn't convincing. If this film
was in fact meant to be serious, it
would probably qualify Mark Wa
ters, who wrote the screen adapta
tion, as an individual with a sick and

twisted mind.
The story goes something like
this. . . . It's Thanksgiving and
Marty Pascal (Josh Hamilton)
brings home his fiancee (Tori
Spelling) to meet his unusual fami
ly, or at least the members who
haven't yet disappeared — the fam
ily patriarch vanished under myste
rious circumstances the day of JFK's
assassination.
The troubles start with Marty's
sister, played by Parker Posey, the
most genuinely insane character.

She thinks that
she is Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis.
Her family calls
her Jackie-O, she

dresses like Jackie, and most dis
turbingly, she has a passion for
reenacting JFK's assassination. If
that was the extent of her mental in
stability, there wouldn't have been a
problem, but unfortunately for
Marty's fiancee, Jackie-O strongly
dislikes the fact that her brother has
brought home a girl.
As the evening progresses, se
crets that would better be left hid
den are revealed. Instead of an
evening of family bonding, Thanks
giving turns into a disaster. Fortu

nately, Mrs. Pascal has taken the
precaution of hiding the kitchen
knives, just in case emotions get out
of hand. All this craziness did draw
a few chuckles from the audience,
but at no point was the film con
vincingly comical. 1 think that the
unconventional subject matter left
the viewers not knowing how to re
spond. On leaving the theater, I felt
ambivalent about the film. While
the dysfunctional family was amus
ing, the lack of true comedy also
made it frightening.
All the characters are so twisted
that it is hard to judge the actors'
skills in portraying them. All did an
adequate job, except for Spelling,
whose performance is bad to the

point where it was actually annoy
ing. Maybe she thought that her
character was supposed to be the
same as the character she plays on
"Beverly Hills 90210." She could
have used this opportunity to prove
herself to be a good actress, but after
seeing her in this film, I doubt that it
will ever happen.
Overall, I can't recommend this
film for its entertainment value. On
the upside, "The House of Yes" does
contain social commentary that
might make it worthy of discussion
in a class dealing with family issues,
abnormal psychology or pretty
much any class that contains the
word "dysfunctional" in its title.
