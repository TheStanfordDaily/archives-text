# Gattaca
## 
### 
Whoa. Ethan Hawkc is a lot buffer than you might think.

The opening scene of "Gattaca" shows Hawke in the
shower sloughing off dead skin and shaving off excess hair.
He's Jerome Morrow — well actually, he's Vincent Freeman
pretending to be Jerome Morrow for the sole purpose of
working at an elite company called Gattaca.
Vincent's problem is that he's a "God-child" — his
parents made him the natural way and as a result, he has all
sorts of undesirable traits such as a possible heart condition.
He's genetically inferior to those conceived in labs by geneti
cists who engineer children out of the best traits the two par
ents have to offer.
When Vincent suffers genoism (discrimination due to
genetic make-up), he undertakes an elaborate scheme in
which he "borrows" the DNA of genetically superior Mor
row.
When a murder occurs at Gattaca, Vincent's eye-lash
is found at the scene of the crime, and it contains the only
DNA that cannot be accounted for. (Vincent takes those
extra long showers in order to prevent shedding, but this
time it's not enough). When Vincent becomes a murder sus
pect, his ruse threatens to fall apart and his spot on a rocket
scheduled to leave for Saturn is endangered.
Hawke slouchcs and wears stubble just right as the in
secure and angry Vincent before the Morrow-makeover.

After the makeover, he exudes a sleekness and intelligence,
but never forgets the underlying insecurities bound up is his
fears of being discovered. He makes Vincent vulnerable and
appealing all at once.
This appeal attracts the admiring attention of co-worker
Irene Cassini (Uma Thurman). As always, Thurman is the
statuesque beauty with very careful diction. The smooth
contours of her face and long lines of her body serve to
match the slick and polished interiors and the barren con
crete exteriors of the sets. Every camera angle takes advan
tage of the scenery with the exception of an upside-down sex
scene too difficult to describe.
Michael Nyman's gorgeous musical score, at once sweet
and sorrowful, highlights the triumphs and potential disas
ter in Vincent's life. Teamed with Hawkes performance
these elements turn the film into a character portrait at the
expense of the plot's suspense and romance.
But it doesn't matter because there is something extreme
ly appealing about a person who achieves what is presum
ably beyond his abilities and who pursues his goals despite
discrimination. In true "Star Trek" fashion, the film situates
intelligent ideas in the world of science fiction but does away
with the camp.
"Gattaca" has a plot with its share of holes. However, an
absorbing character, austere visuals, a moving score and
compelling issues are more than enough to hold the film to
gether and make "Gattaca" enjoyable and effectively unset
tling.
