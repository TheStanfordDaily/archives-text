### 
It would have been easy for director Paul
Thomas Anderson to make "Boogie Nights" a
sleek and stylish portrayal of a very hip era, and
nothing more. Loosely based on the life of John
Holmes, "Boogie Nights" tells the story of Lxjs
Angeles's hard-core porn industry in the late '70s
and early '80s and has been hailed as "Goodfellas
meets Pulp Fiction." The films pre-release pub
licity hints at yet another hip but hollow directo
rial ego trip, but it's exactly this erroneous con
ception that lays the trap with which the films
overwhelming power ensnares you.
Opening the film with a cinematic trick
borrowed from Martin Scorcese, Anderson
pays homage to his predecessors and then
quickly transcends them. The opening camera
shot is like a swooping eye that descends from
above into the Hot Traxx night club, graceful
ly following the characters as they spin and
glide through the colorful decadence of the

polyester era they
define.
Soon the
camera follows
' each character
home and the thin
sheen of the night
club's charm is in-

stantly removed as each is met with a pathetic
situation at home. In this very obvious and al
most painful juxtaposition of the two worlds
each character inhabits, it becomes clear that
this will not be a glamorous portrayal of an in
triguing business, but a tragically humanist
story of the very real people inextricably en
meshed in an industry intent on objectifica
tion. Anderson shuns a recent tendency to
favor style over story, choosing instead a nar
rative full of poignantly detailed realism.
Mark Wahlberg (a.k.a. Marky Mark) deliv
ers an incredible performance as the simple
but lovable Eddie Adams. Eddie struggles in
school, and after a gut-wrenching scene in
which his mother tells him he is "too stupid to
be any good," Eddie, who knows that "every
one is blessed with one special thing" follows
his, and ends up at the house of director Jack
Horner (Burt Reynolds). In a fabulous scene

of a pool party that could only occur in Los
Angelos, Eddie is introduced to his new fami
ly of "stars." Eddie becomes Dirk Higgler and
is soon on his way to XXX rated fame. Dirk's
first sex scene with the matronly Amber Waves
(Julianne Moore) provides a remarkably ten
der moment as the naive beginner wants to
"make it sexy" and have it "feel good;" the sim
ple hero has not yet become disillusioned.
Dirk discovers fame, vanity and drugs, and his
path soon follows the inevitable course of one
who flies too high. Anderson's masterful film
making and Dirk's tragic slip into rancor reach
their zenith simultaneously in an extraordi
nary scene wrought with so much tension it is
physically painful to watch.
But "Boogie Nights" is far more than just
Dirk Diggler's story. Interwoven throughout
are the tragic and comic subplots of the film's
spectacular, tightly defined and deeply devel
oped cast of characters. The inclusion of these
stories brings thought-provoking contrast
and timely comic relief to the film's central
story; their resolution provides a comfortable
wholeness to the film. "Boogie Nights"'s much
anticipated conclusion is a happy but ambigu
ous ending that leaves you satisfied but not
quite settled.

"Boogie Nights" is a masterpiece. It is hum
ble humanism on an epic scale.
