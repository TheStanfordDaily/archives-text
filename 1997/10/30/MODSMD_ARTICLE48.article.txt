You shut off your light. For a
creepy couple of moments the dark
ness has potential. Eventually the
light seeping around the edges of
your blinds illuminates the room
enough so you know that nothing
was ever standing over you with
sharpened, drippy fangs poised to
strike. Though fleeting instances of
black night might be uncomfort
able they can also be rather exciting.
So you look to the movies to
recreate the excitement of those
dark moments.
But, like the slice of moonlight

glaring through a crack in a window
shade, "Critical Care" refuses to
leave the viewer in darkness long
enough to contemplate the truly
dire possibilities of the issues it pre
sents. Promoted as a "dark comedy,"
"Critical Care" examines money
and morals in medicine but ends in
gende reassurance that the good
side of human nature will triumph
over greed.
Until now Dr. Werner Ernst
(James Spader) has been able to dis
tance himself emotionally from his
patients, under the tutelage of his
mentor Dr. Butz (Albert Brooks),
who is chief of the ICU and con
cerned only with keeping patients

alive as long as their insurance dol
lars are rolling in. Ernst does howev
er have twinges of conscience stem
ming from philosophical discus
sions with wise ICU nurse Stella
(Helen Mirren).
Emotional detachment becomes
impossible for Ernst as he is caught
in a struggle between two sisters
over the fate of their father, who is
on full life-support. Eelicia Potter
(Kyra Sedgwick) is the daughter
who pleads with Ernst to be hu
mane and pull the plug. The other
daughter, Connie Potter (Margo
Martindale), wishes to prolong her
father's life.
It's revealed that the actual strug
gle between the sisters is over their
father's $10 million estate. The
money will go to Felicia if the father
dies before his 75th birthday and

Connie gets the money if the father
makes it to 75. Now Ernst must
struggle with the emotional and ra
tional factors upon which his pro
fessional judgment must be based.
Dr. But/, also provides glimpses
of the dark side of selfish human na
ture with his focus on money. The
extreme nature of his character
makes him less frightening as an ac
tual representation of what might
be going on in the minds of those in
the medical profession. Subtlety
would have been more insidious.
The real star of "Critical Care" is
the set. Trapped in an ultra-modern
holding tank for human vegetables,
the patients in the ICU are already
in hell. The hospital interior is full of
tunnels, chrome and glaring white
walls and this effectively puts the
viewer in a nauseated mood.

Instead of leaving us with this
mood as a final striking example of
the potential for medicine to truly
alienate those it is designed to assist,
the story line of "Critical Care"
doesn't live up to the visual impact
of the set. Ernst is let off the hook as
his focus shifts from his own inter
nal struggle to the more defined
amorality of the tug-of-war be
tween the Potter sisters.
So, be forewarned, you will
breathe a sigh of relief at the end of
"Critical Care." Don't expect a truly
dark comedy — in the end, light
and morals and goodness rise to
the surface. How reassuring to
know that if in real life the light
doesn't always come seeping
through the blinds, at least it does
in the movies.
