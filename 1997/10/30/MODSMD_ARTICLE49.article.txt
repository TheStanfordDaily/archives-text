So, do you believe in
fairies?
Today's modern world
probably has enough un
believers to kill off Tin
kerbell and her buddies
many times over, but in
"FairyTale — A True
Story," the fairies are alive
and well. This film, set in
1917 England as World
War I rages, is part histo
ry, part philosophy and
part magic.
"FairyTale" centers
around two little girls —
Elsie Wright (Florence
Hoath) and her cousin
Frances Griffiths (Eliza
beth Earl) — who believe

in fairies and actually see
them buzzing about the
brook by Elsie's home.
They manage to take pho
tographs as proof of their
sighting.
The photographs stir
up the question of authen
ticity, and eventually they
come to the attention of Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle
(Peter O'Toole). Doyle
asks the cousins to take
more pictures, and when
the photographs are pub
lished, a big controversy
ensues.
The story has its fanatic
believers, but it also has its
critics, including sleazy re

porter John Ferret (Tim
Mclnnerny), who is ob
sessed with revealing the
"truth."
Another mind in the
mix is that of Marry Hou
dini (Flarvey Keitel),
whose personal mastery of
visual trickery leads him to
be skeptical of the story,
but not its positive impact
on the masses.
An interesting question
is posed for the audience:
just how much faith
should we invest in our be
liefs? On one hand, we
have a gaggle of people try
ing to rationally explain
the existence of fairies. On

the other, we have the al
luring presence of Houdi
ni, whose tricks we have no
trouble accepting.
And does the title, "A
True Story," give us any
more reason to take what
we're seeing as historical
fact?
The imagery in this
movie is great; we are given
a lush picture of the sum
mertime English country
side. However, the acting
isn't the best. In particular,
Harvey Keitel, in spite of
his extensive research on
Houdini, isn't convincing
as the infamous escape
artist.

I also felt the movie
falter when it let the au
dience know early on
that the fairies are real. It
takes a lot of the suspense
away from the plot, leav
ing us with nothing but
criticism for the cynical
characters and cheesy
images of little people
flying around.
Still, you have to love
the romantic, magical
spirit of the movie. Be
sides, there's a cameo by
Mel Gibson. Or is it really
him? You may just have to
cast aside those doubts
and believe.
