nitn the rally's home many limes
in the past was no longer suitable
lor any type of bonfire beeause ol
the threat it would pose to the tiger
salamanders that live in the lake.
I"he lake first eeased hosting the
bonfire in IIWl l W when il was found
that the giant blaze threatened the
salamanders' endangered existence.
I lus decision prompted the Axe
Committee, which organizes the
rally, to find a new location for the
annual event.
I his year's program will feature
an appearance by the football team
and the traditional telling of the
story of the Axe. Although other el
ements of the rally as well as certain
details remain to be worked out.
Axe Comm "is trying to make it a
very exciting program," said junior
Matthew Bramlage, the commit
tee's chair. Axe Comm is also trying
to involve freshman and drum up
support from all the dormitories, he
added.
According to Axe Comm mem
ber Matthew d'Alessio, a junior,
there will be a small bonfire at the
rally measuring 4' by 4' by 4' in size.
I le added that the committee has a
budget that includes fireworks in the
evening's festivities. Axe ( 'omni still
needs to obtain a permit for the fire,
but he expects no problems because

the rally and bonfire were held at the
amphitheater two years ago.
This year marks the third time
that the rally has been held at the
site. The amphitheater is considered
a temporary location until a site ca
pable of accommodating more peo
ple and a larger bonfire can be
found, said d'Alessio.
When the rally was last held at
the amphitheater in 1995, there was
a turnout of about 1,000 people, said
Bramlage, who is expecting a good
turnout this year as well.
Dean of Students Marc Wais
added that the committee has spent
an enormous amount of time and ef
fort in coordinating this whole event
and applauded their efforts.
"It's unfortunate we had such a
short time to plan, develop, and im
plement a new Big Game event,"
Wais said.
Nevertheless, Bramlage said, "it
should be pretty smooth sailing from
here once we get started on putting
together a good show."
Other locations the committee

proposed for the rally this year in
cluded the Foothills, the Oval and
Lot 10 near Stanford Stadium.
D'Alessio said Axe Comm mem
bers were frustrated with the way
the University handled the bonfire
issue and that the University has
tried to redirect attention away from
a bonfire event. However, Wais re
sponded, "A number of University
officials have made a concerted,
good-faith effort to work with the
Axe Committee in pursuing every
suggested option."
Wais added, "Each proposal has
been explored by University offi
cials. . .knowing that the Axe Com
mittee was adamant in maintaining
the concept of a bonfire but at a dif
ferent venue."
All of the proposed sites had to
go through a three stage approval
process. First, the site had to be re
viewed by the Stanford fire marshal
and environmental health and safety
officials. Second, the site had to be
inspected by Palo Alto officials, and
finally by Santa Clara County.
