As straightforward as Stanford's
student leader pay may seem in com
parison, ASSIJ salaries still cause
confusion. A common campus mis
conception is that ASSU leaders are
paid from association fee moneys,
said ASSU Financial Manager Don
Coleman. In fact, their salaries come
from the ASSU endowment, which is
supplemented by business returns
from Stanford Student Enterprises,
the business arm of the ASSU.
"We've made a really dedicated ef
fort to run the ASSU without charg
ing students for its operations," Cole
man said. Although students don't di
rectly pay for their elected officials,
some still wonder what functions they
perform to deserve financial compen
sation.
According to last year's ASSU
president, senior Bill Shen, the job
entails working on a variety of advi
sory committees, pushing legislation
and overseeing funding.
Shen said the job actually was more
than full time, 'in the end, this is still a
service position," he said. "You don't
do it for the pay."
"It's a big job; people deserve ade
quate compensation," said current
ASSU President Emily Andrus, a se
nior. In fact, she holds that the position
of president deserves more pay.
However, not all agree. "I don't
think that student government leaders
should be paid more" than resident as
sistants, said sophomore Melora
Krebs-Carter.
