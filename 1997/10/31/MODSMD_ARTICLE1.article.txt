# Apple co-founder Wozniak speaks
## 
### Sylee Gore Staff writer 
Jerry-rigged cattle prods, Dial-a-
Joke hotlines and a phone call to the
Pope are a few of the notable things
that Steve Wozniak has made in his
life. The first Apple computer is an
other.
Last night. Wozniak spoke to a
packed audience in the Burbank
lounge about the years that led up to
the founding of Apple Computer
Inc.. with a healthy dose ol pranks
mixed in for laughs.
By the fifth grade. Wozniak was
deciding between engineering or
teaching as a profession. "I thought.
Well, elementary school teachers
earn the most money, right? They
have to make more than engineers.' "
However. Wozniak was wooed
away by the intricacies of wires and
soldering irons. "Once, a group of
kids in my neighborhood ran fences
up and down the street and made an
intercom between our houses." he
said.
Speaking on electronics. Wo/niak
commented, "You throw a switch.
Something happens. That's what I
like." Noting Wozniak's Hair lor cir
cuitry. his electronics teacher in high
school arranged for him to learn the
FOR I RAN programming language
at a nearby engineering firm.
While there, Wozniak punched
cards to write a program that solved
the chess problem of the Knight's
Move. "I realized, after the program
kept failing, that the brute force of the
computer's speed isn't as important
as the human's algorithm." said Woz
niak.
Still in high school, Wozniak
found a book that described a com
puter's inner workings. Lacking any
formal training, he nonetheless

began cobbling together a computer
that maximized the use-value of each
chip.
"My goal became 'the smaller you
make it.the better the design." 1 didn't
have anyone to show il to. but I was
excited enough about it to keep
going." he said.
In college, Wo/niak handled his
share of punch cards and problem
sets. More memorable, though, are
the pranks he pulled.
"1 remember reading a piece in
Esquire |magazine] that was listed as
fiction," Wozniak reminisced. "It de
scribed a network of the brightest en
gineers in the country who could di
rect calls with these special blue
boxes they had built. Hut.. .the thing
that kept getting me was that the
numbers sounded too exact to be
made up."
Intrigued, Wozniak called up his
friend Steve Jobs — with whom he
later founded Apple and read the
article aloud to him. Determined to
investigate, the two snuck into the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
where "those high-powered brainy
guys don't lock things up real good."
In the library they found the informa
lion they needed to make free phone
calls to the Vatican.
After spending a few years in col
lege. Wozniak began designing scien
tific calculators for Hewlett-Packard
Co. While there, he learned of the
I lome Brew ( omputer C 'lub, a group
of computer enthusiasts who met in a
Menlo Park garage.
"These weren't the well-dressed
managers." Wozniak said. "These
were the technicians who wanted to
build the computers."
Wozniak exhumed his high school
schematics and began experimenting
with microprocessors. Wozniak
asked himself, "What do I want the

computer to he?"
I le explained th.it "too many peo
ple were locked into the idea of a
computer ;is ;in enormous hox"
sprouting wires and myriad switches.
Wo/niak. though, "wanted to type
Hnglish." With this in mind, he built a
computer that factored in ;i terminal
and ;i keyboard.
I Jp to that point, computers had
been built by hobbyists from kits.
However, as Wo/niak's design
evolved, he and .lobs began bandying
about the idea of selling pre-fabrieat
ed computers.

I he decision coincided perfectly
with a skyrocketing interest in com
puters. Intending to sell only a few
hundred, the nascent Apple Com
puter Inc. was soon gettingso.o(H)or
ders lor computers.
Despite Apple's successful debut,
Wozniak was not satisfied. "Why
should human beings have to memo
rize anything?" he asked himself and

based commands to a graphics user
interface. The famous Macintosh
