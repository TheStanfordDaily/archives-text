questions about allegations of forced abor
tions, religious persecution and the sale of
organs from executed prisoners.

since China opened to the world in the
19705, "The Chinese people have enjoyed a

much better life, and it has intensified

Democrats and Republicans closed ranks to
raise candid concerns about ( hina as Wash
ington and Beijing end eight years of diplo
matic estrangement.

positions we don't agree with."

got it from Congress." said Senate Demo
cratic leader I om Daschle a day after Jiang
heard a lecture about human rights from
President Clinton.

Square massacre, headed from Washington
to Philadelphia to visit such symbols ol

the heart ol American capitalism and ring
the opening bell at the stock exchange.

the capital with a speech acknowledging

th;it relations with (Ik- I' 11 ileel States have
been marked with "estrangement and eon
tacts, confrontation and cooperation, fric
tion and harmony."

the human lights issue ought to be
addressed through dialogue so confronta
lion could be avoided," Jiang said.
Addressing American trade concerns,
