Israeli teens indicted for killing
ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) —Two teen-agers accused in a slaying

who is lighting extradition from Israel, where he fled after the killing
and dismemberment of Alfredo Tello Jr.
"I think we're well on the way to extradition. I'm optimistic," said
Robert Dean, Montgomery County prosecutor.
Sheinbein and Aaron Needle, also 17. were indicted on one count
of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Needle faces a third
charge of being an accessory after the fact. They are accused of mur
dering Tello, whose charred body was found in a vacant home Sept.
IS with its arms and legs missing. The three teen-agers lived in Silver
Spring, Md.
Prosecutors would not elaborate on specifics of the case, but the
indictment indicates Tello likely died two days before his body was
found. There has been no mention of a motive.
A preliminary hearing for Needle had been scheduled for Friday,
but the indictments eliminated the need for that hearing. He has been
jailed in Montgomery County since his arrest.
Sheinbein has been fighting extradition, claiming Israeli citizenship
through his father. Under Israeli law. citizens cannot be extradited.
Woman expecting septuplets
CARLISLE, lowa (AP) — For at least four months, the folks of
Carlisle had kept a little secret: Their own Bobbi McCaughey was
expecting seven babies.
But when the pregnancy for the 29-year-old stay-at-home mom
entered its 2Nth week when doctors believed the fetuses had
reached a viable stage — lips started to loosen in this Des Moines bed
room community of 3,200.
"I imagine at least hall of the town knew and kept quiet," said
florist La Vena Owens, who sent flowers to Mrs. MeCaughey's home
and hospital room with discreet delivery me.
Word leaked to local media Wednesday, and by nightfall the world
knew of the pregnancy. There are no known living sets of septuplets
in the world.
While Mrs. MeCaughey's due date is not until mid-January, the
babies could come at any time. She went into the hospital ()ct. 15. and
husband Kenny said they could be delivered next week.
The last septuplet birth in the United States was in 1985 to an
Orange. Calif., couple. One was stillborn, three died within 19 days,
and the remaining three had medical and developmental problems.
Dr. Seuss promoting vaccinations
ATLANTA (AP) — Dr. Seuss is helping the government teach
parents that getting their children vaccinated is as basic as one fish,
two fish, red fish, blue fish.
Six posters leaturing Dr. Seuss characters were unveiled in Atlanta
yesterday to kick off a national immunization campaign. Each poster
has a rhyme about a particular shot.
"What's going on here? What's wrong with this fella? Why isn't he
protected against measles, mumps and rubella?" one poster says.
The art was donated by Audrey Geisel, widow of Dr. Seuss author
Theodor Geisel. Geisel. who died in 1991. wrote such children's clas
sics as "Green Eggs and Ham" and"The Cat in the Hat."

olds in the United States have received a full series of shots.
But the government said about 1 million children under age 2 still
haven't had all their shots.
