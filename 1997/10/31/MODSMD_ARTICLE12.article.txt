NF.W YORK (AP) — Steep drops overseas
gave Wall Street another littery day yesterday,
but its ability to withstand another freefall led
experts to predict the worst beating for Ameri
can investors in a decade may be over.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 125
points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,381.67 after briefly
bobbing into positive territory around midday.
Even with the decline, it was the second
straight day without any of the monumental
mood swings that had gripped the market over
the past week. The Dow had tumbled 875 points

in just three sessions, including a record 554-
point plunge on Monday that shut down the
stock exchange.
"I think we have seen our lows," said Hob
Dickey, managing directoi ol technical analysis
at Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis.
"Investors have had great reason for selling
stocks, and they've pretty much done their dirty
deed." said Dickey. "Anybody who would be
worried enough to sell on the international crisis
has done so. and that's why we're seeing the
market firm up."

But Ihe economic uncertainties ot the Pacific
Kim continued to weigh heavilv <»n I lie shares ol
IJ.S. technology companies, which have relied
on Asian markets for much ol their growth.

suffered the day's biggest losses, falling 2 per
cent.
Regardless of the global economic picture,
business conditions remain vigorous in the I Init

terday showed fewer claims loi unemployment
benefits and strong demand for new homes.
