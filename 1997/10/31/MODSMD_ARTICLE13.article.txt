KAJIAIX). Kenya (Af') Agnes Siyiankoi's luis
band used a wooden club the hist time he bent her. She
had to be carried to the hospital.
Alter 13 years of abuse, the 30-year-old Maasai
woman defied the tradition that she silently submit: She
took her husband to court.
The case is rare in a country where wife-beating is
not only prevalent but also largely condoned.
Siviankoi is a member ol the Maasai, a southern
Kenyan tribe that views women as property, first ol
their fathers, then ol their husbands. I raditionally, the
tribe's men use force to assert their authority, usually
without protest from the women.
"II a man does not beat his wile, he is looked down
upon as a weakling." Siyiankoi said.
Hut far from being confined to the Maasai. wile
beating is a practice that cuts across class lines in Kenya,
without regard to cultural, economic or educational dil
fcrences. Although the practice, like any other form of
assault, is illegal, women who complain face intense
social pressure to conform.
"When I run to my father's house after every severe
beating, my mother comforts me and tells me to return
to him." Siyiankoi said. " Look at the scars I've gotten
from your father's beatings, she says, telling me its ()k
for a wile to be beaten "
In a recent survey by the Women Rights Awareness
Program, a Kenyan advocacy group. 70 percent of the
men and women interviewed said they knew neighbors
who beat their wives. Nearly 60 percent said women
were to blame for the beatings, lust 51 percent said men
who beat their wives should be punished.
"Lvcn m the lew cases taken to court, most victims
are pressured by relatives and friends to drop the
charges, or settle the ease out ol court, or change the
charge to that ol minor assault." said Millie Odhiambo
ol the Kenyan branch of International Federation of
Women Lawyers.
Women are very angry with me," Siyiankoi said. "It
is unheard of in Maasailand to put your husband into
jail."
