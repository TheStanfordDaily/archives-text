## Notebook Stanford University: The 						freshman focus 
### 
ICONSIDI R MYSri.l- a Ivpical Stan
ford undergraduate. I'm an editor al I'lie
Daily, a theme associate al mv dormito
ry and a student in the midsl of finding a
niche in her department.
lUil occasionally, in the course of a con
versation with a new acquaintance. I'm
reminded that my Stanford experience lias
been somewhat atypical.
I Ins recognition is prompted when the
other person inevitably asks. "Where did
you live freshman year?"
I dread this question because I didn't live
m Brainier. Alondra. or I arkin. and I didn't
even live in Roblc or l oyon. I lived in I 10l
lis South in I larvard Yard.
As a sophomore transfer to Stanford. I
am reminded frequently in little ways of the
centrality ol freshman year at Stanford.
()n the surface level there are the obvi
ous differences 1 never experienced an
alphabet soup ol RAs. A As. Rlsand RCC's
screaming mv name as I approached the
dorm to my residence. Nor did 1 have a
chance to follow the Band with my class
mates during freshman week or to attend
the Class of IWs first BigCiamc.
And for better or worse I do not share
with my classmates memories of ( IV.
Bui far more importantly. I missed the
freshman dorm experience the late night
bonding, the freshman exuberance al house
meetings and the sense of community forged
when people attending college for the first
time live togethei and talk honestly about
the challenges they've faced and overcome.
Indeed the all-freshman dorm experi
ence has an extremely powerful resonance
in the minds of Stanford students.
Have you ever heard a senior talk about
being a I antana or (iranada junior with the
same sort ol fondness they recall being a
Rinconada or Donner Irtish?
For those of us who spent freshman year
elsewhere, we soon realize that the Stanford
freshman dorm experience is about much
nunc than the fact that the dorm often
becomes the source ol one's closest friends.
That phenomenon happens in freshman
dorms at universities across the country.
What makes Stanford freshman experi

cncc different is that il is characterized by a
comprehensive living environment in which
students interact and grow emotionally,
socially and academically in a unique way.
I lie Resld programming, multiple
upperclass advisers and the experience o!
eating together as ;i dorm unit stands 111
stark contrast to my own freshman year.
My most salient memories are of living in
a spiritless all-freshman dorm where stu
dents weren't formally encouraged to inter
act with one another and ol looking out into
a sea ol l(i(H> laces, trying to locate a dorm
mate or friend 111 the freshman dining hall.
II there is one key lesson I learned from
my freshman year, it is that the dorm envi
ronment is every bit as influential in defin
ing one's university experience as the aca
demic one.
While 1 realize that the existence of Stan
ford freshmen, even those in four-class
dorms, is a far more lively and personal one
than I encountered. I nonetheless wish that
all Stanford freshmen could enjoy the exu
berance of an all freshman dorm.
I thus encourage the University in its
endeavors to increase the number of all
freshman dorms to ensure that such an
experience is available to all freshmen who
desire it.
Don't get me wrong. I learned valuable
lessons from my freshman year, an experi
ence that has led me to deeply value the
openness and the sense of community that
exists here. And there is much that can be
enjoyed socially and academically when
coming lo Stanford as an upperclassmen.
Moreover. 1 have found my fellow class
mates in the Transfer ( lass ol l l )% to be
interesting and amazing people, each bring
ing diverse experiences from other universi
ties and the real world. 1 earning from them
has been an integral part of this past year.
So tonight, when I see packs of ghosts
and goblins from the Class of 2(M) 1 partic
ipating in their first Mausoleum party. I'm
not going to feel blue.
Instead. I am going to be relishing the
fact that I'm spending three years as a Stan
ford undergraduate.
