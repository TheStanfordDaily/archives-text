## Seven meatless days and nights 
### 
PICTURE IT:
Yost's kitchenette,
Oct. I 1 ), a mere 15
minutes to midnight.
Rummaging through the
cabinets, I searched for
sustenance to keep me
going into the wee hours

of the night as I diligently work on my hon
ors thesis (okay, maybe that's a little bit of a
stretch, but I swear the rest of the story is
true!). Pop-Tarts and Fig Newtons wouldn't
hold me over, this I knew. Continuing my
search. I opened the refrigerator door, my
eyes looking in vain from shelf to shelf, find
ing nothing but milk and other healthy
things.
And then, I saw IT.
The beating of my heart, its tempo
increased, became audible. My pupils dilat
ed My lips slightly parted. What I saw before
me was both beautiful and terrible at the
same time. There, on the bottom shelf, was a
big bowl of chicken (awww yeah!). My nor
mally reasonable and rational self became
overcome by a primal desire for something
my abnormally large incisors could sink into.
I wanted I needed meat.
Out of control. I threw four big pieces on
a paper towel, smothered il with mounds of
shredded chcddar and into the toaster oven
it went. You see, I had to hurry.... In a few
short minutes, when the clock struck mid
night. I wouldn't be myself anymore. 1
would turn into something completely con
trary to my nature: a vegetarian.
I can hear you gasping as you ponder the
weight of that last statement. Yes. for a guy
who never eats salad or vegetables of any

kind unless meat is somehow mixed in. a
guy who will order four double cheeseburg
ers at McDonald's when they've got the W
cent deal going — how did I survive to even
write about my ordeal? Well let me tell ya.
it wasn't easy.
I had entered a pact with two ol my
drawmates, pledging to be vegetarians lor
the week, until midnight the next Sunday
night, just to see what it was like. Inspired
by a fourth drawmate who had declared
himself a vegetarian at least until I hanks
giving (and who. by the way. is better at
darts than me and single. I might add), we
three boldly embarked oil a vegetable, fruit
and pasta journey. Together, we would be
strong.
Less than 24 hours later, one ol our
group had already "fallen off the wagon." il
you will, giving in to the meat side. Clearly,
this would be a greater struggle than either
I or my one remaining partner had imag
ined. Grilled cheese and peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches held me over that first day
through dinner.
Hut Tuesday night offered my greatest
challenge. The Public Service Scholars din
ner consisted of ( hinesc food and tried
chicken, two of my favorite things. Sitting
down with a plate of fried rice, noodles and
even lofu, I had to keep my eyes and nose
concentrated on what lav before me. Dis
covering small pieces of chicken and shrimp
in the rice. I slowly shook my head back and
forth in despair and picked the meat out.
Suddenly empowered, I ate my tofu with
delight.
The rest of the week, I treated my vege
tarianism not as a punishment but as what it

was and is: an incredibly interesting and
enjoyable lifestyle. Each meal became a
creative challenge as I put together varying
combinations of pastas, sauces, vegetables
and fruits, discovering my long suppressed
inner herbivore. Pineapple, mandarin
oranges, grapefruit, mushrooms... they had
never tasted so good. And my expectation
of decreased energy levels or sluggishness
proved untrue (and my tennis game greatly
improved).
Midnight the next Sunday came and
went with little fanfare. No Taco Bell runs
to chow down a 10-pack of tacos. I was.in
fact, asleep, and it wasn't until lunch that
Monday that 1 look advantage of my newh
restored meat privileges. When the chili
mac and HBO chicken passed through my
lips. I was thoroughly disappointed. The
steak that night and subsequent meals ol
chicken fajitas and hot dogs and the like no
longer brought pleasure to my taste buds.
Mut this realization is of no real discom
fort. I've gained a greater appreciation and
respect for eating habits that 1 previously
derided. Meat is no longer the dominant
feature of my meals. Salads and steaks now
peacefully reside together on my plate and
in my stomach.
There's a greater lesson in this. By real
izing that as individuals we all have different
sets of life experiences, we can gain a
greater appreciation and understanding of
others by placing ourselves, if even for a
moment, in their shoes.
