Apparently it is not ecologically sound

salamanders, but it is ecologically sound
to drive tractors over the salamanders

Nobel prize a sign
of great work
After reading I lubie Chen's letter to
the editor. 1 felt Chen was extremely bitter
about something, though I couldn't figure

out what it could be. The letter, in
response to an editorial written about the
recent Nobel prizes won by Stanford
researchers, was to the effect that one
should not place too much emphasis on the
Nobel prize. Emphasis in this ease being a
letter by the editor. Fair enough.
The prize is not a prerequisite lor ;i
great researcher, nor noble human being,
as I think Chu and ()sheroff would be the
first to say. But the prize is recognition of
great work: Chu and Osheroff are well
deserved winners. 1 he editorial, however,
said something more, which is worthy of
editorial space. As is common for profes
sors at research institutions, research
demands encroach upon teaching responsi
bilities. Students then suffer (though per
haps they gain in other ways). Hie point of
the editorial was that ("hu and ()sheroff.

despite the adverse effeets on their
research, make a concerted effort to he
good teachers. Ib them, this is a priority -
and one I admire.
I laving role models such as this can't
help but train the next generation of scien
tisis. Yes. as C hen mentions, these
researchers' primary concern is research
and thus should be focused toward this.
Hut training of the next generation is just
as important for the continuation of good
science. Now. do these awards inspire stu
dents in their research, as Chen asks? I
don't know. Hut it does motivate me to
study my quantum mechanics just a little
harder. Whether this is of anv help surviv
ing Chu's upcoming midterm, remains to
be seen.
