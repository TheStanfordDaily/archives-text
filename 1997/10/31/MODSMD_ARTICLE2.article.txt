# Reading the rings: Tree history

### Berra Yazar 
As the door opened, a whole forest of pines and
palms leaned casually in the free Room. Thev were
the retired Hand Trees. One of them came to life and
introduced himself; the man under the Tree was sopho
more Matt Merrill.
Halloween is the perfect day for investigating cos
tumes, especially the ones that represent Stanford spir
it and the Band's cra/y philosophy.
"People just like dancing Trees, hut the media like
the pine tree more." Merrill explained. "I guess it's he
cause it looks more like the [Stanford] emblem."
The Tree, the Band's infamous mascot, is sell-de
signed and mostly self-built by the man under the cos
tume. Funny Freddy, ;i fabric supplier 111 I ruckce.
Calif., supplies the material for the I ices, which are
built each summer.
The exterior of Merrill's current I rec costume is a
polyester and lycra vinyl mesh through which he can
see the outside world. I lie interior is molded from
kevlar. and the aluminum hoops give the I'ree its
shape. The costume fits on the person like a backpack.
Collapsible so that it can fit into a bag. the costume
must go under buses and in airplanes during the Tree's
numerous voyages.
The accessories of the exterior give the I'ree its
character. Merrill said. Ihe bug-eyes and triple
mouth are prominent features of this year's I ree. It
has three mouths separated by lips: one for smiling,
one for screaming and another for attacking with
bared fangs.
"In a previous Tree. I noticed that some of the kids
would say. 'Hey mom, look, it's frowning!" while turn
ing the smile upside down. It just inspired me to make
different mouths for different occasions."' Merrill said.
Being a mascot. Merrill attracts all the opposing
fans who focus their energy on the Tree, making it
quite dangerous for him at times.
"The Tree should be able to take care of himself."
explained senior Chris Bonzon. who donned the cos
tume two vears ago. "Selt-detense and self-awareness


Ted McGuire Daily
are what's important.'"
" The Dollies have ;i secret plan to
protect Matt at BigCiame. We don't
even want one string of his costume
to end up in some asshole Cal stu
dent's scrapbook," said Emily
Roley. a second-year Dollie. The
Dollies, according to Roley, are very
close to the Tree, especially since
they perform together as accessories
of the Band.
Merrill's Tree is the lightest ever.
It only weighs 35 pounds, Merrill
said. The previous palm Iree, which
had to be rebuilt after over-enthusi
astic Cal fans smashed it at last
year's Big (iamc, weighed 65
pounds.
The Tree is usually associated
with stunts and craziness, making it a
source of constant enjoyment and a
victim of harassment. "The Tree is a
big joke. I hate mascots, but the Tree
is the bomb. It has character, and it's
all about having a good time, unlike
all the other mascots." Bon/on
added.
"The Tree is like a favorite sock
that you knitted yourself. Even if it
gets holes in it, you still love that
comfortable feeling when you wear
it." Merrill explained.
Matt and Chris said they both
believe that being the Iree is an
out-of-body experience. Their
motto, "The I rce is to all as all is to
the I ree," relates to the concept of
\\'u-wei in Asian philosophy, they
said.
"The fuzzy electrical shimmer
that comes through my legs when I
am on a hardwood court or a grass
stadium is the only thing that can
keep me dancing sometimes." Mer
rill said.

In 1973, when the Indian was
dropped as the Stanford mascot,
student organizations came up
v\ith their own mascots. The Band
selected the Tree as their mascot,
according to Merrill, the 11th mod
ern Tree.
Four years later students voted
on the Stanford mascot, electing the
Robber Baron, but the University
overruled the decision and cardinal
red was named the Stanford color
mascot. Merrill said.
The Band decided to keep its
own mascot. A decade later the
Band started taking the Tree seri
ously and held Tree tryouts consist
ing of written applications, personal
interviews and various durability
tests. Bonzon explained.
Although the Tree has gradually
become the Stanford mascot, it is
still officially the Band mascot. "All
the Trees are outgoing, friendly and
dedicated to being Tree as well as
dedicated to the Band and Stan
ford." Roley said.
" The Tree is a lot of fun because
it's a visual representation of our
|Stanford| uniqueness," said Matt
I )iMaggio, a freshman who plays the
tenor saxophone in the Band. "The
Tree is essential to [the Band's]
shows because it helps set the tone
for our music."
Many do not consider trying out
for I ree because it is a huge time
commitment, one of approximately
23 hours per week, Merrill said. "F-ix
ing the I ree is what takes up most of
my time, besides rehearsals," he said.
"()n game days you have to show up
at 7 a.m. It's really hard on my acade
mies. Contrary to common belief,
some I rees do study."
After basketball season ends
next quarter, a new Tree will step in
and add to Stanford's growing forest
of Trees.

Although the Tree has gradually
become the Stanford mascot, it is
still officially the Band mascot. "All
the Trees are outgoing, friendly and
dedicated to being Tree as well as
dedicated to the Band and Stan
ford." Roley said.
" The Tree is a lot of fun because
it's a visual representation of our
|Stanford| uniqueness," said Matt
I )iMaggio, a freshman who plays the
tenor saxophone in the Band. "The
Tree is essential to [the Band's]
shows because it helps set the tone
for our music."
Many do not consider trying out
for I ree because it is a huge time
commitment, one of approximately
23 hours per week, Merrill said. "F-ix
ing the I ree is what takes up most of
my time, besides rehearsals," he said.
"()n game days you have to show up
at 7 a.m. It's really hard on my acade
mies. Contrary to common belief,
some I rees do study."
After basketball season ends
next quarter, a new Tree will step in
and add to Stanford's growing forest
of Trees.
