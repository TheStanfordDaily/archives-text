# Reading the rings: Tree history

### Berra Yazar 
As the door opened, a whole forest of pines and
palms leaned casually in the free Room. Thev were
the retired Hand Trees. One of them came to life and
introduced himself; the man under the Tree was sopho
more Matt Merrill.
Halloween is the perfect day for investigating cos
tumes, especially the ones that represent Stanford spir
it and the Band's cra/y philosophy.
"People just like dancing Trees, hut the media like
the pine tree more." Merrill explained. "I guess it's he
cause it looks more like the [Stanford] emblem."
The Tree, the Band's infamous mascot, is sell-de
signed and mostly self-built by the man under the cos
tume. Funny Freddy, ;i fabric supplier 111 I ruckce.
Calif., supplies the material for the I ices, which are
built each summer.
The exterior of Merrill's current I rec costume is a
polyester and lycra vinyl mesh through which he can
see the outside world. I lie interior is molded from
kevlar. and the aluminum hoops give the I'ree its
shape. The costume fits on the person like a backpack.
Collapsible so that it can fit into a bag. the costume
must go under buses and in airplanes during the Tree's
numerous voyages.
The accessories of the exterior give the I'ree its
character. Merrill said. Ihe bug-eyes and triple
mouth are prominent features of this year's I ree. It
has three mouths separated by lips: one for smiling,
one for screaming and another for attacking with
bared fangs.
"In a previous Tree. I noticed that some of the kids
would say. 'Hey mom, look, it's frowning!" while turn
ing the smile upside down. It just inspired me to make
different mouths for different occasions."' Merrill said.
Being a mascot. Merrill attracts all the opposing
fans who focus their energy on the Tree, making it
quite dangerous for him at times.
"The Tree should be able to take care of himself."
explained senior Chris Bonzon. who donned the cos
tume two vears ago. "Selt-detense and self-awareness
