# Foreign Bureau: Oxford
## Tienlon Ho Considering your life's consequences 
### 
A I 6 P.M. ON weeknights. every
bell tower in Oxford pours its per
sonal combination of scales and
clangs into the streets and alleyways.
Incompatible melodies bounce off the
crooked cobbles and shingles to create an
incredibly eerie mess of sound, something
that seems to make people disappear into
pubs or homes until the 15 minute attack is
over.
I was caught in the barrage last Tuesday,
heading back home from the warm
mahogany of the library, when I found
myself alone except for the sound ol bells
numbing my ears. I turned around and con
firmed that every other human being had
left me and the alley to ourselves. Except
for the bells, it was suddenly silent as if
everything had stopped moving. It was
something I have never experienced, a city
that felt as if it had been abandoned by its
people. It was then as if I could see the city
for the city and nothing more, no culture, no
social scene. Just construction.
I was in an allev between two rows of res

idential flats, with ik) little patches of grass
or even a window box to break the pattern
of door, window, door, window. Typical in
every way, it was likely one of the hundreds
of streets that had been laid-out during Eng
land's infamous industrial revolution. Hun
dreds of people crammed row upon row.
This is the way much of England has
become, where only 10 percent of any type
of land is still categorized as wilderness.
And as moves to use those lands as pasture
grounds or residential sites have relentlessly
been proposed, each proposal has succeed
ed piece by piece.
Most distinct about a few of these partic
ular flats were the elongated chimneys that
capped the scaled slate of their rooftops. It
was in 1952, when the notorious London fog
draped itself thick as pea soup over the city
and refused to leave for days and days. The
smog measured at a pH of 1.7, slightly more
acidic than lemon juice, and more than
4.(MH) people who decided to breathe ended
up dying that week.
The government responded to the out

cry. and suddenly everyone agreed it was
time to do something about the industrial
chimneys and the household fireplaces. I he
remedy was to build higher, taller chimneys,
up and over the cities so that the smoke
would drift above noses and lungs until it
was carried far away by the wind.
But, predictably to us these days, acid
rain formed where the smoke had been sent
and then fell down all over Europe. It still
falls down onto the slate of Oxford rooftops
and leaves little brown pock marks on the
black finish. It falls into the ponds and lakes
and turns them crystal clear and a beautiful
green.
I've had many people tell me, the ponds
around here are especially beautiful. There
is no silt or ugly brown plant rotting up the
scenery, they say. But it is because nothing
can live in them that the ponds are so clear.
The water of the Cherwell. which weaves
through Oxford, is much like this
extremely lifeless and stale. It is a branch of
the Thames, and like it, has no banks but is
guided by a cement gutter. A gutter it defi

nitely is. since convenient dumping grounds
for trash arc and have a I \\; â€¢ \ s been (lie near
est sewer grate.
I was not in a place much different from
home. I have felt this way before when
looking at familiar American icons in shops
on a bustling thoroughfare.
Hut the feeling was no different there in
the middle of .in empty alley. Ilia! familiari
tv was an extremelx hcaw recognition, more
a burden than a comfort. Before I came. 1
had somehow hoped that the trend to care
about but not necessarily address environ
mental problems had already passed through
the preteen stages and was actually being
tackled in the I 'K. Hut now I see that even
one, everywhere is avoiding the problem.
I didn't want to surrender to the extreme
pessimism I had begun It* feel, but at the
moment it was difficult to see it am other
way. We have been warned countless times
that human beings can't 1 ust go about doing
whatcvei they please. Hut we haven't lis
tened very much. I questioned whcthci the
reason really has to do economics or instead

the reality that people are unchangeable in
Iheii basic beliefs II we are bound to col
lapse as a species following chaos and star
vation. despite how much some cr\ for an
alternative, this is the natural course.
Animals in their own closed communi
lies often experience this themselves. I hey
grow and grow until their populations ti\ to
t ix the crisis b\ killing each other, eating
then young, stealing and plundering until
nothing is left. And then everything dies.
If human beings are so much more devel
oped than those animals. I haven't seen
much ol a difference in out reactions to
what is beginning to happen. I he only dif
fercnce is that some ol us stop and hope. It
was then that the bells slopped. I here was
total silence, before people came back into
the streets, and the alley was full again.
I'ienlon Ho, a junior majoring in political
si ience, wants von guys to know that she is
generally a very optimistic person. And
despite the thoughts in this column, she
hopes you all have n happy weekend.
