# Ram's Head to produce 'Chess'
## 
### Saba Bireda 
A tumultuous love story with a
Cold War spy twist will come alive
on stage in the Ram's Head spring
musical, "Chess."
Ram's Head, Stanford's oldest
student-run theatrical group, re
cently announced that it would pro
duce "Chess," written by Richard
Nelson, with lyrics by Tim Rice and
music from Benny Andersson and
Bjorn Ulvaeus. The show first
opened in 198X.
The show features the story of a
young Hungarian-American chess
player who falls in love with her
Russian opponent. Throughout the
play, the young woman, Florence,
struggles to find her father, herself
and love.
Every spring quarter a vote is
held at the general membership
meeting of Ram's Head to decide
what show to put on the next spring.
After that vote, the producer recom
mends the show to the group's
Board of Directors, which makes
the final decision.
Christina Drake, a senior and the
musical's producer, said she was in
terested in "Chess" because "the
show includes several strong female

roles." Two-thirds of the roles in
"Chess" are female roles, including
the lead. The play also appealed to
Drake because it lacked the "typical
happy ending of Broadway shows,'
she said.
Several factors go into producing
the spring show. Board of Directors
member Kim Coffey, a senior, said
one of those factors is the need for a
good ratio of male to female roles.
"One of our main goals is to do
the show without losing money,"
Drake added. Typically, one-third
of the show's budget goes to paying
for the rights of the show and use ol
Memorial Auditorium. Two years
ago. Ram's Head had to cancel its
spring musical because it was too ex
pensive.
Coffey also said, "The show
needs to attract a lot of people to au
ditions".
The show features a cast of 27
people: seven lead roles and 20
spaces in the chorus. "All students
are encouraged to audition, espe
cially strong dancers and strong
male singers," said Drake. Audi
tions will be held Jan. 12 through
14.
"Chess" is produced, directed,
designed and performed entirely by

students. Coffey said she is consider
ing auditioning because "it's amaz
ing how many students the show
brings together."
Those interested in being part of
the "Chess" crew should apply over
the World Wide Web at http://www -
leland.stanford.edu/group/rams
head/sprsho by tonight. Drake is
looking for several staff positions,
including technical support, set de
signers, costume designers and a di
rector. The crew will be working on
the show from November to mid-
April.
Drake added, "The show is a
great learning process for students
like me that are interested in theater
but would not ordinarily get the
chance to have such a big role in
putting on a show."
She hopes that "Chess" will at
tract more of the Stanford commu
nity because it has a more recent feel
to it with several songs being com
posed by classic '80s group Abba.
She also hopes the famous
Broadway show name will draw in
the Palo Alto community. "There's
not many Broadway shows that
someone can see lor $15," she said.
The show will run for five nights,
April 10, 11.16, 17 and IS.
