Freshman forward Corey Woolfolk and the Stanford men's soccer
team will play for the school s first-ever No. 1 ranking today against
Indiana.
Zapala has recorded 12 shutouts,
eclipsing the school record of 10 set
in 1985 by Tom Austin.
Indiana has allowed three times
as many goals this season, but the
Hoosiers more than make up for that
offensively. I heir 61 goals this sea
son include six each in games against
Butler and Rhode Island and a 9-0
drubbing of Kentucky.
Only one of Indiana's games has
gone into overtime, resulting in a 4-3
win, while Stanford has fought three
overtime battles, winning one and
tying the other two 0-0.
Ties also distinguish the series be
tween the Hoosiers and the Cardinal,
who have only met four times. Indi
ana won two of those matches, while
two resulted in ties — including the
teams'last meeting in 1991. When In
diana and Stanford met in the same
tournament in 1989. the Hoosiers
came out with a 1 -0 victory.
This year, the Cardinal enters the
game confident, Clark said.
"We know what got us where we
are," he said. "You've got to stick to
that. We know what we're doing."
The last several games have been
big ones for the team, Clark said, es
pecially because the Cardinal
clinched the MPSF Mountain Divi
sion title in a 3-1 victory over Califor
nia Oct. 19. Last weekend, Stanford
topped St. Mary's 4-0 and Cal Polv-
San Luis Obispo 3-0.
But Indiana will be the true test of
whether the Cardinal deserves its
No. 2 ranking — the school's highest
ever.
"The hard thing is knowing how
good Indiana is," he said. " They're
very good, but this is exactly what we
want to find out. This gives us an op
portunity to find out how good the
best team in the country is."
Junior midfielder Simon Elliott
said the team is looking forward to
the test.
"They're obviously deserving of
the No. 1 ranking," he said. "It's
going to be a good measure of where
we are and how we're doing and how
we can come together as a team."
The match is "in many ways a no
lose situation for us," Clark said.
"We'll gel experience playing against
a top team.... It's going to be so
valuable to this young squad."
Tonight's game, begins at 5 p.m.
at Negeosco Stadium on the Univer
sity of San Francisco campus.
