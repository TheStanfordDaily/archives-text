es with the same four teams. Stan
ford can only hope 1997 will pro
duce the same result — a perfect
November and a bowl berth.
One problem. The first team
Stanford faces in its push toward the
postseason, UCLA, is not the same
squad Stanford beat last year. T hat
win. highlighted by a game-winning
touchdown pass from Chad
Hutchinson to Brian Manning with
only 58 seconds remaining, resusci
tated the Cardinal's season.
IJCLA (6-2. 4-1) enters this
year's matchup at Stanford Stadium
ranked No. 12 in the country and
riding a six-game winning streak.
Right now the Bruins may be play
ing as well as anv team in the coun

try.
The I JCLA offense has been par
tieularly spectacular. The Bruins
feature the nation's highest-rated
quarterback, the country's leading
receiver in yards-per-catch, a run
ning back who ranks fifth in the
country in scoring and the nation's
top place-kicker. As a team. IK I A
averages 42.3 points per game, sec
ond-best in Division I.
The biggest difference is that ju
nior quarterback Cade McNown.
who in two previous years was wild
Iv inconsistent, has blossomed into
one of the nation's best signal
callers. Last season. McNown threw
three interceptions against Stan
ford. In the Bruins' first eight games
this year, he has thrown 16 touch
down passes and only four intercep
lions, earning the nation's highest
quarterback efficiency rating.

McNown "has started a lot of
games for us," said IK I A head
coach Bob Toledo, "lie's playing
with a lot of confidence and he
knows where people are on the
field."
Speedy senior wideout Jim
McElroy has been the main benefi
ciary of McNown's accurate arm.
McF lroy leads the nation with 23.5
yards percatch and has caught seven
touchdowns. In last week's 35-17
win over California, McE lroy had
touchdown catches of 56 and 58
yards and also ran foi a 23-yard
score.
Stanford's secondary, mean
while, has not played well. I he ( ar
dinal has surrendered 15 passing
touchdowns second-worst in the
Pac-IO and has allowed countless
big plays through the air. lb make
matters worse, the already linn unit

may be without senior cornerhack
Corey Mill, who is still recovering
from an injured hamstring.
When UCLA doesn't throw the
ball, the Bruins can also move it on
the ground. Senior Skip I licks is one
of the Pac-10's best runners and is
having a big year despite nagging in
juries. Hicks already has 17 touch
downs. just six shv of the I'ac 10 sin
gle-season record, and his 757 yards
are third in the I'ac 10.
Adding to the Bruins' firepower
is junior place kicker Chris Sailer,
one of college football s best. Sailer
has made 15 of IS field goals, includ
ing a 56-yarder.
" I lus is a team that is playing
very, very well." Willmgham said.
Meanw liile, the ('ardinal offense
has ground to <i halt after weeks of
high living. In the last two games.
Stanford has averaged 62 yards

rushing, five turnovers and four
sacks allowed. The Cardinal's
turnover margin has gone from
being one of the nation's best to the
second-worst in the Pac-10.
And taking advantage of
turnovers lias been a specialty ol the
Bruins defense. I J( I A leads the na
tion in turnover margin, having
forced an incredible 31 turnovers.
Its defense, while not big, is light
ning-quick exactly the kind of de
fense Stanford has struggled with
this season.
"We're playing with reckless
abandon it's a feeding frenzy,"
Toledo said. "We're creating a lot of
confusion. (Ours) is not a standard
defense."
To keep UCLA's offense in
check, Stanford must have offen
sive success of its own. Otherwise,
its already weakened defense will

wear clown.
"()neol the things you have to do
is keep their oliense oi l Ihe field,'
Willingham said. I h;ii means
putting points on the hoard and eon
trolling the clock."
I his game is critical for Stanford
considering the logjam at the lop ol
the l'ac-10. Four teams Washing
ton State (5-0 Pac 10), Washington
(4-0). I J( I .A and Arizona Stale M
I) are ahead ol (lie ( animal in
the conference race,and I JS( is tied
with Stanford at 2-2. A loss this
weekend would pul the Cardinal's
howl hopes m serious jeopardy.
"The (bye) week provided us an
opportunity to re-cncrgi/c and re

started the year, our No. I goal was
to play a 12th hallgame. I lie 12th

One problem. The first team
Stanford faces in its push toward the
postseason, UCLA, is not the same
squad Stanford beat last year. T hat
win. highlighted by a game-winning
touchdown pass from Chad
Hutchinson to Brian Manning with
only 58 seconds remaining, resusci
tated the Cardinal's season.
IJCLA (6-2. 4-1) enters this
year's matchup at Stanford Stadium
ranked No. 12 in the country and
riding a six-game winning streak.
Right now the Bruins may be play
ing as well as anv team in the coun

try.
The I JCLA offense has been par
tieularly spectacular. The Bruins
feature the nation's highest-rated
quarterback, the country's leading
receiver in yards-per-catch, a run
ning back who ranks fifth in the
country in scoring and the nation's
top place-kicker. As a team. IK I A
averages 42.3 points per game, sec
ond-best in Division I.
The biggest difference is that ju
nior quarterback Cade McNown.
who in two previous years was wild
Iv inconsistent, has blossomed into
one of the nation's best signal
callers. Last season. McNown threw
three interceptions against Stan
ford. In the Bruins' first eight games
this year, he has thrown 16 touch
down passes and only four intercep
lions, earning the nation's highest
quarterback efficiency rating.

McNown "has started a lot of
games for us," said IK I A head
coach Bob Toledo, "lie's playing
with a lot of confidence and he
knows where people are on the
field."
Speedy senior wideout Jim
McElroy has been the main benefi
ciary of McNown's accurate arm.
McF lroy leads the nation with 23.5
yards percatch and has caught seven
touchdowns. In last week's 35-17
win over California, McE lroy had
touchdown catches of 56 and 58
yards and also ran foi a 23-yard
score.
Stanford's secondary, mean
while, has not played well. I he ( ar
dinal has surrendered 15 passing
touchdowns second-worst in the
Pac-IO and has allowed countless
big plays through the air. lb make
matters worse, the already linn unit

may be without senior cornerhack
Corey Mill, who is still recovering
from an injured hamstring.
When UCLA doesn't throw the
ball, the Bruins can also move it on
the ground. Senior Skip I licks is one
of the Pac-10's best runners and is
having a big year despite nagging in
juries. Hicks already has 17 touch
downs. just six shv of the I'ac 10 sin
gle-season record, and his 757 yards
are third in the I'ac 10.
Adding to the Bruins' firepower
is junior place kicker Chris Sailer,
one of college football s best. Sailer
has made 15 of IS field goals, includ
ing a 56-yarder.
" I lus is a team that is playing
very, very well." Willmgham said.
Meanw liile, the ('ardinal offense
has ground to <i halt after weeks of
high living. In the last two games.
Stanford has averaged 62 yards

rushing, five turnovers and four
sacks allowed. The Cardinal's
turnover margin has gone from
being one of the nation's best to the
second-worst in the Pac-10.
And taking advantage of
turnovers lias been a specialty ol the
Bruins defense. I J( I A leads the na
tion in turnover margin, having
forced an incredible 31 turnovers.
Its defense, while not big, is light
ning-quick exactly the kind of de
fense Stanford has struggled with
this season.
"We're playing with reckless
abandon it's a feeding frenzy,"
Toledo said. "We're creating a lot of
confusion. (Ours) is not a standard
defense."
To keep UCLA's offense in
check, Stanford must have offen
sive success of its own. Otherwise,
its already weakened defense will

wear clown.
"()neol the things you have to do
is keep their oliense oi l Ihe field,'
Willingham said. I h;ii means
putting points on the hoard and eon

I his game is critical for Stanford
considering the logjam at the lop ol

"The (bye) week provided us an
