# Volleyball hosts double helping of LA
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Don't tell the USC women's vol
leyball team that a conference title is
out of its grasp.
With seven conference matches
to go, there's always a chance the No.
7 Women of Troy (lh-3, 8-3 Pacific
10 Conference) could make up the
three-match deficit separating them
from the fourth-ranked Cardinal
(20-2, 11-0).

VOLLEYBALL

■ TONIGHT: No. 4 Stanford (20-2,
11-0) vs. No. 24 UCLA 4-7) at
Maples Pavilion, 7 p.m. RADIO:

■ SUNDAY: Stanford vs. No. 7 USC
(16-3,8-3) at Maples Pavilion, I p.m.
RADIO: KZSU-FM (90.1)
Besides, if the Women of I'roy
had to accept the fact that Stanford
had gotten the better of them again,
we're not sure they could handle it.
Despite its best efforts, I JSC has
only taken one conference match
from the Cardinal in the H X)s. But
more painful for the Women of I'roy
is the fact that they have never beat
en Stanford in the postseason. I'he
Card h;is won all nine matchups in
the NCAA tournament, including
each of the last four years.
"They really want us in a big
way," said head coach Don Shaw.
" They're not real fond of playing us.
They feel this is their best shot in a
while."
But US(' won't get its chance
until Sunday at I p.m. First up for the
Card is tonight's 7 p.m. match at
Maples Pavilion against No. 24
UCLA (9-9,4-7).
The Bruins have watched their
season tailspin out of control, and
UCI.A's hopes of returning to the
NCAA tournament this season are
growing dimmer with each match.
Injuries were ;i problem earlier, but
head coach Andy Banachowski li
nally has everyone healthy and feels
Ins team can compete with the best.
"(letting everybody healthy is a
big part ol it," Banachowski said.
"We've played well, but not well
enough ;it certain points. I feel confi
dent that we can play against top
teams."
The Bruins won't find any team

tougher than the Card. Stanford
notehed win No. 21) last weekend to
ensure its eighth straight season \s ith
20 or more victories. Perhaps more
impressive is the fact that 18 of those
20 wins came in 3-0 sweeps of its op
ponent. Stanford lias not dropped
more than one game in any victory.
The ( aid barely broke a sweat
against I'( l A the first time around,
holding the Bruins to a .010 hitting
percentage (I'( I ,A's second-lowest
ever for a single match) in their ()ct
5 meeting. But don't expect Stanford
to look past the floundering Bruins
in preparation for Sunday's match.
"They're finally putting their line
up together." Shaw said. Sophomore
middle blocker "Tamika Johnson | is
back| and has been playing really
well. It's up to us to play well and
take I hem out of their game."
The bigger matchup for the C 'aid
this weekend is I ISC. Bui even that
contest isn't as big as it was shaping
up a week ago. At that point the
Women ol l roy had just two confer
ence losses and boasted a No. 5 na
tional ranking.
I'he contest promised to pit No. -4
against No. 5 and a chance for I IS(
to shrink Stanford's lead in the I'ac
10 to one. But that was before I JSC'
lost a close live-game match to
Washington last weekend.
"We're feeling really good about
it." said senior co-captain l.isa
Sharpley ol Stanford's lead. "We
have a nice cushion in the I'ac-10.
and we |iist want to play well and im
prove."
Stanford also wants to gel
healthy. I ast weekend Sharpley
played with the flu. and injuries have
been a hurdle for the squad all sea
son.
"It's been hard for us this year,"
Shaw said. "A lot of factors are keep
ing us limited in practice. So lai
we've pulled it together. Come
match time, we just have to see what
we can do."
So far Stanford has managed to
put it together pretty well when it
counted. When the ( animal faced
I JS( earlier this season, Stanford
sandwiched two IS 13 games around
a I IS(' goose egg for the VOwin.
"USC will be the toughest,"
Sharpley said. "They'll definitely
want some revenge against us for
that 15-0 game, but I think we can
plav even better than we did then."
