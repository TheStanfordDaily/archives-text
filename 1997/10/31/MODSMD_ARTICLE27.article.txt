# Meet with Texas a clash of titans
## Mens swimming meet at deGuerre could be national title preview 
### Andr√© Salles-Cunha 
The top two men's swimming teams will take to
de( iuerre Fool at l p.m. today when Stanford hosts
the Texas Longhorns, and though the season is
young, the match is huge.
"This is by far the biggest home meet inour time
here," said junior Blake I iolden.
The two teams will likely be battling it out for the
national title at the N( "AA championships in March.
Hut the Cardinal is ready for the Longhorns now.
"This team will be ready for Texas" said coach
Skip Kenney after the victory against San Francis
co State last week.
Stanford's team feature several swimmers from
Texas, but there will be no divided allegiances in

this match.
"No mercy for the home state." sophomore
(ilenn ('ounts promised.
The Longhorns will face a Stanford squad that
has swam well as a team in both its first two meets.
"The meet is a defining step in the season," ju
nior Dod Wales said. "We can measure ourselves
against the top teams. It will be a reality check. It
will show what we need to do to win N( 'AAs."
Texas comes in with possibly the best individual
swimmer in the country in senior Neil Walker. Last
year at NCAAs, Walker became the lirsi person
ever to go 44 seconds in the KM) yard backstroke,
and only the second person, behind former Stan
ford great Brian Ketterer, ever to break 46 seconds.
The Longhorns, like Stanford, did an excellent

recruiting job last year, a factor that could loom
large come March. The team that winsNC AAs will
probably be the one that gets the most production
out of their freshmen this year.
()ne reason to expect the newcomers to have an
impact is the slim margin by which second-place
Stanford beat fourth-place Texas last spring. Only
30 points separated the two teams at the NCAA
meet, and Texas finished without an expected 20
more points from Walker, who broke his hand on
the second day of the championships.
The rivalry extends well past last year, however.
The two teams have won 11 of the last 13 N( 'AA
swimming titles. Stanford's senior class has gone I-
I in dual meets against the Longhorns, including a
win last year.
