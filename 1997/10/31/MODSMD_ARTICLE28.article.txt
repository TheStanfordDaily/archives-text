### Leslie E. Wingard Contributing writer 
With its season rapidly winding
down, the Stanford field hockey
team is on top of its game and eager
to prove themselves this weekend
against California and UC-Davis.

FIELD HOCKEY

■ TOMORROW: No. 19 Stanford
(10-5) vs. California at the Field
Hockey Field, 11 a.m.
■ SUNDAY: Stanford vs. UC-Davis
at the Field Hockey Field, 2 p.m.
The Cardinal's potential was rec
ognized by the latest NCAA field
hockey poll, which ranked Stanford
No. 19 in the nation.
"Everybody is ecstatic about it,"
said junior forward Sarah Medeiros.
" The ranking definitely boosted
our confidence," said junior defend
er Stephanie Finkelstein. "But we
knew we deserved to be in the top 20
before the decision was made."
After hearing the news, the team
is even more eager to show off for its
fans, and the Cardinal is asking for
plenty of Farm support for this
weekend's home matches.
"Last year's fans were awe
some." said junior captain Justina

Williams. "The band even came. We
hope to get people there this year
too because a big turnout makes a
real difference."
The Cardinal certainly isn't tak
ing the Cal match lightly. Stanford
beat the Golden Bears 2-0 earlier
this season and hopes to outdo itself
tomorrow afternoon.
"Cal is the biggest game we have
left," Williams said. "We're all
pumped up for it."
Stanford has been playing in
creasingly well over the course of the
season, and the Cardinal is hoping
everything will continue falling into
place tomorrow.
"We've been scoring nice goals
on corners and nice breakaway
goals," Johnson said. "Plus, we've
been building our passing game
since day one."
Sunday's match against UC-
Davis. a club team, is expected to be
much less competitive.
Several of the Stanford women
are from California and are
friends with or have even played
with UC-Davis team members.
Finkelstein and Medeiros are both
from Davis.
The Cardinal isn't about to let its
guard down. "Playing Davis is al
ways a lot of fun, but we'll continue
to work hard." Williams said.
