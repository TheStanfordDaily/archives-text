## Just when you thought it was over... "Sculpture and 'Reality' in the Age of Post-Modernity."

Amaya's "Udder 1" has caused some controversy on the Stanford campus. Some student
groups, notably those who have seen it, express shock at its apparent lack of its similarity to any
thing pleasing to the eye. Among other papers presented at Stanford's academic conference Prof.
Manfre Manlisson took it upon himself to analyse the work's manifesto..

In this "essay" I intend to discuss the nature of "work" and finality
inherent in the work of Amaya, in particular her "Udder I," her latest
"work" commisioned by Stanford "University."
A new era of "art" has been ushered in by the arrival of Amaya's
"Udder I" on campus. The sculpture lies between Ginnever's "Luna
Moth Walk I" and Rosati's "Column I," both of which will later comprise
the leg and a bushy growth of the final masterpiece envisioned by the
artist more than 13 years ago. The "new" piece is a recent addition to the
"collection" of public sculptures on the grasses that surround Meyer. It
announces the completion of Phase II of the Santa Vaca de Mis Amores
Sculptural Conglomerate. "I wanted to show that America is hypocrisy
incarnate until it admits that it is a terrorist nation," explained Amaya,
"and to show this water squirts out of the teets every nine minutes."
Amaya explained the new sculpture thus: "'Reality' is an illusion, and
it is the object of 'art' to show us this. Indeed 'art' is such a subjective
word, depending as it does on now universally derided concepts such as
'taste,' 'medium,' 'aesthetics' and 'talent,' that I think it is better to do
away with it all together." Amaya's from El Paso, Texas and was accept
ed to Stanford after Berkeley rejected her for being "too controversial"
and ignoring their demands to stop shaving her armpits. Such is Amaya's
"commitment" to modern art that, in order to fully free herself from such
constraints of having to see what any of her work looked like, she gouged
"both" her eyes out. Her close "colleague" Yuck Foo has said, "Amaya
doesn't 'see' in the traditional sense of the word. Sometimes I think that
the best way to appreciate her art is through the eyes of a blind person."
Udder 1 has been "praised" by "the" "critics" as a "break"-through in
cubist intra-subjective art (Amaya claims she was nurtured by a mad
cow), and it meets all the requirements for public sculpture at Stanford â€”
these being: "Safety and stability during earthquakes," "Constructed
from material that is resistant to severe weather factors" and "A bunch
of other things."
Students "reactions" have been varied, to the "piece." "1... 'think'
that it is [good]." [italics mine] said "sophomore" Sweety Popcakes.
"It's... g... ood" said senior Michael Munching." "?," said juniour Hector
Freelydangling, before adding,
Amaya's "art" works to "perpetuate" the "thingness" of "the thing,"
or rather "the" inherent "plasticity" "of" it. As "D"errida has "shown"
