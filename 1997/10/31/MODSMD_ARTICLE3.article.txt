In an almost unanimous vote yes
terday.the Faculty Senate approved
a proposal that will make informa
tion from course evaluations avail
able to students.
The evaluations, which will con
sist of approval ratings of professors,
as well as student comments, will be
available to students unless the dean
of lhe particular school decides oth
erwise. C 'urrently, students, especial
lv in the School of Humanities and
Sciences, have minimal access to the
results of teacher evaluations that arc
filled out at the end ol each quarter.
A course guide would provide in
formation on demographics, such as
the year and major ol the students in
the class, as well as whether the stu
dents are taking the class to satisfy a
distribution requirement.
"Advising is not as good as il
could be at Stanford, and course
evaluations would just be one more
resource for students," said Vice
Provost for Faculty Development
Anne Fernald.
Although the policy was ap
proved nearly unanimously, some
senate members voiced their con
cans.
"I'm fearful that the course evalu
ations could be more harmful than
helpful lot non-tenured professors."
said Civil Engineering Prof. Paul
Roberts. "1 or instance, il evalua
tions include numerical data such as
approval ratings, this information
could be harmful to young faculty."
Dean ol the School ol I lumanities
and Sciences John Shoven said he

will not release eourse evaluations
unless a majority of students com
plete the forms.

vation ol the Stanford Museum. Hie
museum, which was severely dam
aged in Ihe I 0111 a I'rieta I lartlu|uake
in IW). is scheduled to be reopened
in January of l l ) l H said museum di
rector I 0111 Seligman.
" The museum was central to the
Stanlords' conception of what a uni
versitv should he," said Seligman.
Stanford is as much ;i service orga
ni/ation as an academic organi/a
lion: we are here to serve the Stan
lord community."
Although the museum has sul
fercd damages including some to
artwork clue to eartlu|iiakcs over
Ihe last century, Stanford is •build
ing its collection and hopes to offer
the community "diverse and broad"
collections in the future, said Selig
man.
" I he losses we have sustained
since I lie time ol the Stanlords are
substantial," Seligman said.
With the newly renovated build
ing, Seligman said lie hopes faculty,
students and community members
will be able to take advantage of Ihe
wide variety of art, including Native
American and contemporary art.
Furthermore, Ihe museum will
offer seminal rooms and studio
space where students will be able to
work with a kiln or a pi inting press.
Seligman said he also hopes the
exhibits the museum oflei s will be di
redly related to academic pursuits al
Stanford.
"We want to develop exhibits
that terminate from or are directly

related to academic studies," Selig
man said.
Also at I lie meeting, the senate

cy on retention of and access to re
