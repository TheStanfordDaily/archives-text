# A 						Taxi Driver Writes...

"...so anyway like I was saying, there's smart and there's smart, you know? I
mean, sure, you look at all these people with their fancy schmancy degrees: brains
the size of a planet and they can't even screw in a light bulb. I mean they don't
teach you nothing at those places. I'm a taxi driver, I learnt the hard way, crashed
nine cars before I got it right. But those people from their University, waving their
degrees thinking they're all swanky. But can they tie their shoelaces? Like fuck
they can. I mean let's say you breakdown on the Freeway. Yeah, you know all the
philosophy in the world, but is your degree going to change your tire for you?
Like fuck it is. Thing is, see, in real-life-everyday-situations your degree don't do
shit for you. Let's say you're in the wilderness being attacked by bears, what's
your degree going to do for you then? Are you going to say, 'Hey Mr. Bear I've
heard of Einstein' or whatever that guy who invented the micro wave's name is.
The bear'd just eat you, to him your big brains are just more meat. I mean, think
about it, where's your degree going to get you when your airplane gets hijacked
by terrorists, and you're the one passenger that escapes, and you have to rescue
300 hundred people, including the President, and protect American democracy
from the bloody hands of a madman using only a waffle iron and a fax machine?
Oh yeah, you know that ee equals em see hammer, but are you going to know to
hide in the cargo section and construct a miniature catapult out of a ba 11 -point pen
and contact the military using a pair of false teeth and a walkman to transmit
Morse code? You're probably too busy shitting yourself because you can't work
out if you exist or not. And let's say you're on Jupiter, where there's nothing but
noxious gases to breathe, and the gravitational pull of the planet collapses your
entire body into a volume of three cubic centimeters, where's all your book learn
ing going to get you then? Nowhere, that's where. Only place University educa
tion'll get you is flattened all over the fifth planet from the sun. So anyway, like
I was saying..."
