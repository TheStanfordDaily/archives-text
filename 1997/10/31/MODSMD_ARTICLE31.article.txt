### 
I simply don't think it's true that the videos on
the snow are all the same. Here's a random
selection of the shows funniest and whackiest
moments.
1) A skier falls over and hurts him / herself.
(Funny!)
2) A little boy hurts himself in a cruel and
unusual way and starts crying. (Very funny!)
3) A domestic animal runs into something and
hurts itself. (It can't get much funnier than
this!) 6
4) Someone's playing golf and lets go of the
club so that is hits someone on the nead, the
head belongs to a little boy who begins to cry. (If
you're not in hysterics, you can't be alive!)

5) During an amateur dramatics performance the stage collapses, crushing a
domestic animal. When someone tries to help Islhe slips in tne dog's entrails
and fall on his or her backside. (They fell over! It's so tunny!)
6) Someone's running to catch a bouquet at a wedding and runs into someone
skiing, who trips over a domestic animal. Everyone's hurt. (If I laugh any hard
er I'll wet myself!)
7) Someone's driving a car and in quick succession they run over a crying
cnild, a slipshod golfer, an amateur actor and a wacky domestic animal and
finallycrasn into a hotel hosting a convention for skiers who are always falling
over. The people who aren't hurt are dead. (Oh no, this is too funny, I did wet
myself!)
8) A fat man takes jumps on a diving board, breaks it and belly flops humili
atingly and painfully into the pool. Just at that moment a nuclear bomb comes
out of the sky and wipes out all of civilization. The only person who survives
is a little boy who slips on the radioactive mud, falls over, hurts himself and
starts to cry. (If you haven't seen it, you don't know how funny it is!)


Ha Ha. Fat boy's going to
take a spill.
