# McCloskey urges student activism

### Alicia McCann 
Stanford alumnus and former
California Congressman Pete Mc-
Closkey said last night he is con
cerned about apathy among today's
college students.
Speaking in the Branner Hall
lounge as part of the "Branner Pre
sents" series, McCloskey addressed
issues such as his work with the en
vironment, the resignation of Presi
dent Nixon and his own experiences
as an active member of the Repub
lican party.
McCloskey arrived at Stanford
in 1947 with no intention of ever be
coming a politician because "if you
look at the caliber of people that
govern our country, they are not the
ablest people," he said.
Stanford life was very different
when he was a student. For exam
ple, he said, "there was nobody who
would have dared admit they were
gay"
During his college years, he said,
"students were enormously active.
The student world I see today is
enormously apathetic.
"Where has a student spoken out
against injustice or oppression and
done something against it in the last
five years? I would like to see more
Stanford students getting involved
in the peace process."
When asked by students what
current issues lie felt were impor
tant, McCloskey responded by say
ing "there are injustices right here
on campus. For example, the treat
ment of women is a very serious
question," referring especially to
the situation of female faculty.
He encouraged students to re
search the issues they feel are im
portant. He said he believes getting
Israel to treat Palestinians with re
spect is the greatest problem facing
today's world.
After graduating from Stanford,
McCloskey went on to become a
prominent Palo Aito lawyer. In
1963, he was invited to the White

House along with 3(H) other lawyers.
At that meeting, President
Kennedy asked that, in the wake of
the recent race riots, the lawyers
form bi-racial committees in their
communities to ensure that African
Americans would he able to voice
their concerns.
Inspired by this experience, Mc-
Closkey returned to Palo Alto with
a strong desire to join the political
movement. To this day, he considers
the civil rights movement to be the
most meaningful cause he support
ed.
"You can't deny people fairness
without expecting a percentage of
them to be willing to die for justice,"
he explained.
One of the primary issues ad
dressed last night was President
Nixon. "I think (Nixon] was a very
knowledgeable diplomat." said Mc-
Closkey, who served as a California

congressman from 1972 to 1982.
"He was also a crook. What I hold
Nixon responsible for is causing an
enormous loss of faith in the Amer
ican people."
In 1972, McCloskey challenged
Nixon in the New Hampshire pri
mary elections. He said that he
chose to run for president because
of students in Stanford's Florence
Moore Hall who were preparing to
burn down the Stanford Research
Institute.
The students were opposed to
the institute — now SRI Interna
tional and no longer affiliated with
the University — because of its con
nection to bombings in Cambodia.
McCloskey, like the students, want
ed to take action to end the Vietnam
War, so he ran for office.
Another area in which Mc-
Closkey witnessed growing activism
was ecology. Following World War

11. according to McCloskey, "no
body cared about the environ
ment."
Working together with former
ASSIJ President Denis Hayes, he
began attempting to convince Con
gress of the importance of the issue.
With the help of Wisconsin Sen.
Gaylord Nelson and college stu
dents nationwide, fliers were mailed
declaring April 22 as "Earth Day."
By 1971, according to Mc-
Closkey. "everyone was an environ
mentalist."
Currently, McCloskey is working
as a lawyer in Silicon Valley. How
ever, he remains active in the politi
cal arena. In recent years, he has
supported several political cam
paigns.
"I've got more Democrats that I
like than Republicans," he said,
"but I haven't left the Republican
party."
