### Dana Mulhauser 
In Ins new role as vice provost lor student
affairs. James Montoya conducted four stu
dent focus groups over the hist two nights to
discuss general student issues and concerns.
The groups have a twofold purpose: to
help Montoya and other administrators see
whiit is on students' minds and to generate
topics for a survey on undergraduate life.
fvach focus group was composed ol eight
to 12 undergraduates. Two of the groups
were random samples of students, all of
whom were sophomores, juniors or seniors.
I he other two groups were more specialized:
one was made up ol President 's Scholars, the
other of students who thought they didn't gel
enough financial aid.
"It is important in my new role to under
stand the student experience," said Montoya,
who until tins year was dean of undertÂ»radu

ate admissions and financial aid. "I thought
these dialogues would he a wonderlul oppoi
I unity to hear directly from the students."
Ihe issues raised in the dialogue v\ 111 form
the basis lor a survey, which will serve as a
more general tool to gauge student satisfac
tion with campus life. I he survey will go out
by e-mail in the next few weeks to ;i latulom
sample ol 3(M) to S(M) undergraduates.
The meetings were held in the vice
provost's conference room, inside I residdei

and a moderator, Jerold I'earson, ilirector ol
