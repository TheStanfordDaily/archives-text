# Focus groups offer ideas for survey on student life
## Montoya hears concerns 
### Dana Mulhauser 
In Ins new role as vice provost lor student
affairs. James Montoya conducted four stu
dent focus groups over the hist two nights to
discuss general student issues and concerns.
The groups have a twofold purpose: to
help Montoya and other administrators see
whiit is on students' minds and to generate
topics for a survey on undergraduate life.
fvach focus group was composed ol eight
to 12 undergraduates. Two of the groups
were random samples of students, all of
whom were sophomores, juniors or seniors.
I he other two groups were more specialized:
one was made up ol President 's Scholars, the
other of students who thought they didn't gel
enough financial aid.
"It is important in my new role to under
stand the student experience," said Montoya,
who until tins year was dean of undertÂ»radu

ate admissions and financial aid. "I thought
these dialogues would he a wonderlul oppoi
I unity to hear directly from the students."
Ihe issues raised in the dialogue v\ 111 form
the basis lor a survey, which will serve as a
more general tool to gauge student satisfac
tion with campus life. I he survey will go out
by e-mail in the next few weeks to ;i latulom
sample ol 3(M) to S(M) undergraduates.
The meetings were held in the vice
provost's conference room, inside I residdei
I Jnion. The students sat with only each other
and a moderator, Jerold I'earson, ilirector ol
opinion research lor the Office ol Develop
mcnt. Montoya watched the meeting on
video m a separate room along with several
senioi members of his staff, including cm rent
Dean ol Undergraduate Admissions and I i
nancial Aid Robert Kinnallvand I Jndemad
uate Advising Director Lori White.
"We watched from outside so
students could share experiences
without me or other administrators
in the room," said Montoya.
Discussions covered a broad
range of topics.
"They gave us juice and cookies,
and started with somewhat general
questions," s;iid Jose Saenz, a junior
who was part of the President's
Scholar focus group. " I he questions
spawned a discussion, and they just
let us go on from there."
According to Pearson, the 1 (M)-
minute discussions focused on three
areas of interest to the administra
tion.
"We first asked what expecta
tions the students had before they
came to Stanford, what they thought
Stanford had to offer. We next fo
cused on their actual experience at
Stanford, at whether the school had
met those expectations," he said.
"The last part of the discussion was

an in-depth look at different areas:
the residences, extracurricular activ
ities. academics and a whole host of
others."
Students were then able to raise
their own issues of concern, which
included community meeting
places, the housing draw and theme
dorms.
"I don't know that I found out
anything surprising," said Montoya.
"but it was just helpful to hear what
was on students' minds."
Montoya and Pearson will re
view the tapes today, and Pearson
hopes to develop the survey next
week.
"The concept of using qualitative
research, such as the focus groups,
followed by quantitative research,
like the survey, is well-tested
method," said Pearson. "The focus
groups give us depth of information
that we can't get in a survey. They
tell us what the issues are and help us
design a more incisive survey. That
way we can be sure to ask for rele
vant information when we conduct
the survey."
Montoya said the survey results

would be primarily for his own use.
"The survey is mainly an internal
one, for me and my staff to decide
where to allocate resources," said
Montoya. "But we will, I'm sure,
share the results with the adminis
tration, faculty and concerned stu
dents."
The President's Scholars and fi
nancial aid students were asked ad
ditional specific questions relating
to their experiences at Stanford.
Moth groups are of special interest to
Montoya.
"One of my specific areas of in
terest is how families finance a Stan
ford education. I want to know the
impact of cost on a student's experi
ence here," he said.
"I am also interested in evaluat
ing the President's Scholars pro
gram. It's a three-year pilot pro
gram, and we want to see how it's
doing."
Students who participated were
pleased with the discussion.
"It is nice that they're seeking us
out," said Saenz. "I'm glad they're
listening to students and I hope
something good will come of it."
