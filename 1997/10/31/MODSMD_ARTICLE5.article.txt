# Venus and Mars compared
## Men and women investigate concepts of masculinity 
### T.J. Babbitt Contributing writer 
Men may he from Mars and women may
he from Venus, hut the two genders were
only about a half a mile away from each other
last night lor two discussions sponsored by
the Women's ( enter.
The men who participated in the talk, ti
tied "Investigating Masculinity/' went to the
I lumanities Annex while the women went to
the top of the I ire Truck I louse.
"What's really unique about this program
is that the Women's Center created a space
for men as well as a space for women to dis
cuss these issues," said senior Nathan Jones, a
volunteer at the center.

Advance publicity lor the discussions said
they were "lor women and men on campus to
identity gender relationship issues m order to
address campus safety, sexual assault and In
rassment on campus." hut only the women
stayed on topic.
I he forum for men focused on societal
conceptions ol masculinity and how they can
he limiting or confining. Iwo professional
mediators led about 2()sludcnts through a sc
ries of exercises designed toexplore the those
pressures. I hen the moderatois asked the
men to think of as many ways as they could t< >
improve male female relationships.
Victor I ewis. one ol the moderatois. was
pleased with the diversity of men who turned
out for the talk.
"It wasn't just New Age sensitive
groupie guys," lie said. " These were
regular guys who found a space to air
their common concerns.
They also found a place to share
their disagreements. Men disagreed
about whether the sexual objectifica
tion of women was necessarily bad.
Some said it was; others said it was
just natural.
While the moderators empha
sized the social construction of sex
roles and the possibility of changing
them, at least one student took issue
with the idea.
" There's a biological basis for

gender dimorphism," said Michael
Campbell, a postdoctoral fellow.
"To answer these questions [about
masculinity and femininity], you
have to ask why there are two gen
ders in the first place."
Fabienne McPhail. the director of
the Women's Center, led the
women's discussion, which drew
about the same number of students.
That discussion concentrated heavi
ly on the issue of women's safety and
campus issues.
"Men don't understand where
women are coming from" when
women raise issues concerning safe
ty. said freshman Nam Hee Kim, a
participant in the discussion. "Men
are not concerned about getting
robbed or mugged the same way
women are worried about rape."

The women's discussion also in
corporated more day-to-day issues
of male-female difference.
"A lot of women wanted to un
derstand if men feel that they need to
behave according to a masculine
standard," said sophomore Kimone
Gooden, also a discussion partici
pant.
"We were curious as to how men
feel about the effect of societal ex
pectations on their lives," added
Kim.
If all goes according to plan, men
and women will be able to pose ques
tions like this to each other directly.
The Women's Center is planning a
follow-up session for winter quarter
that will involve men and women in
Ihe same discussion, at the same
place, at the same time.
