JOHN MCLAUGHLIN & WARD WINSLOW
Silicon Valley did not acquire its nickname unlil the early 1970'5, about the time the microprocessor was
devised, and when integrated circuits, memory chips, and other electronic devices were pouring out if its
fabrication plants. But its origins trace much farther back—back to the founding of Stanford University
and early radio development in this area. This book and companion video, hosted by Walter Cronkite,
guides you through this fascinating, historical rollercoaster ride that has made this area the world's pow
erhouse of technology. John McLaughin conceived the book and video and wrote the introduction. He is
the publisher and president of the Santa Clara Valley Historical Association. Ward Winslow is the editor
of the book. He has spent 34 years reporting and has edited Palo Alto's daily newspapers, making him an
authority on Palo Alto and the surrounding high-tech communities.
