Congressmen urge quick action
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress' top four
leaders agreed yesterday that the United States
should respond quickly, including taking military
action, to show Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that
his decision barring Americans from U.N. weapons
inspection teams is unacceptable.
"The only thing that he (Saddam) seems to under
stand is action, and that's what is going to happen,"
House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt said.
Iraqi officials said last week that Americans could
no longer participate in inspections and gave 10 of
them until Thursday to leave Iraq. They also turned
away three Americans yesterday trying to enter in
advance of the teams' resumption of work today.

Jiang protesters strong in CA
LOS ANGELES (AP) — About 700 protesters
chanted and burned Chinese flags as China President
Jiang Zemin met privately yesterday with Gov. Pete
Wilson and asked business and political leaders for
patience and cooperation.
"As the old Chinese saying goes: A 10,(XX)-mile
journey begins with the first step," Jiang said in a lun
cheon speech in Beverly Hills on the final day of his
eight-day U.S. tour.
Speaking first in Chinese and then in English,
Jiang said efforts to enhance relations between
China and the United States shouldn't be deterred
by "differences that cannot be ironed out for the time
being."
