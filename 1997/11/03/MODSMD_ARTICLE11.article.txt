# Amtrak strike averted

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A labor agreement
reached yesterday between Amtrak and maintenance
workers averted a possible national passenger rail
strike that would have disrupted travel for hundreds of
thousands.
The threat of a shutdown had hung for months over
long-distance passengers nationally and daily com
muters in a half-dozen major cities, just as the railroad
has been fighting off bankruptcy.
The settlement gives workers "a fair and deserved
(wage) increase while preserving the financial integrity
of the company," said Amtrak Chairman Tom Downs.
For the agreement to hold, congressional approval is
required for an Amtrak rescue package already under
consideration on Capitol Hill. That package has been
stalled in Congress over provisions that would relax

some labor protections.
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who
brought the parties together for days of talks that
stretched overnight into Sunday, urged lawmakers to
act quickly.
A prolonged shutdown would have forced Amtrak's
54,(XX) daily passengers to find other travel and could
have led to the suspension of commuter rail services for
more than S(M),(KX) people in the Boston, Chicago, 1 os
Angeles, Philadelphia, New York and Washington
metropolitan areas.
Apart from its long-distance services, Amtrak pro
vides urban rail commuter transportation under con
tract in some cities. Overall, Amtrak serves 500 com
munities, scores of them with no air or city-to-city hus
transportation.
