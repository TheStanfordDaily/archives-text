## Editorial Expand Sand Hill 
### 
Measure O offers
clear answers and
solutions for area.

Tomorrow Stanford faculty,
staff and students who live within
Palo Alto city limits will have the
opportunity to vote on the expansion of
Sand Hill Road, an issue that will have sig
nificant impact on Stanford and its relation
ship with neighboring communities. The
issue is embodied in two alternatives on the
ballot: Measure O and Measure M.
The expansion of Sand Hill Road to El
('amino Real has been a contentious and
holly debated issue for more than 30 years.
Various proposals have been introduced to
ease the congested traffic situation over the
years, including the construction of a High
way K5-like freeway, but they have all failed.
Finally, in Measure O, a complete project
that addresses all of the issues surrounding
the expansion, has been proposed and voters
have a chance to solve not only the traffic
congestion, hut also some of Stanford's other
ongoing problems.
Measure O is an extensive project that
will expand Sand I lill Road to four lanes in
most places, connect it to HI (amino Real
and ease access to the Medical Center. It also
proposes building a new housing unit for
Stanford faculty and staff, building commu
nity senior housing and enlarging the shop
ping center.
While Measure O may seem like over
ambitious proposal at first glance, years have
gone into its making, and its planners have
looked extensively at the big picture. It's
important to note that although the Univer
sity will be responsible for financing the
entire plan, costing more than $20 million,
the project will pay for itself over time
through the new housing and shopping cen
ter expansion.
Stanford has been criticized as self-cen
tered in its efforts to expand, but thousands
of hours of neighborhood and city meetings
went into developing Measure O. It's hardly
what the University originally proposed.
Measure O reflects compromise between the
city's desires and those of Stanford.
I lowever. for faculty, staff and students,
Stanford's priorities should remain the focus
on important issues like expansion. Measure
O's benefits for Stanford are extensive.
I lousing for Stanford faculty and staff has

been a troubling issue for a long time. In fact,
the housing problem makes it an increasing
challenge to entice and retain high-caliber
faculty and staff. Measure O develops this
much-needed housing in one of the only
viable locations on campus, just west of the
Shopping Center. Proposed is a 628-unit pro
ject of rental housing, which will include
units that are offered at below market rate.
Unfortunately, the alternative sites pro
posed by Measure M are unfeasible for sev
eral reasons ranging from environmental
considerations in the Arboretum to using
other land marked for academic facilities.
Many environmental concerns were
raised when Stanford proposed building in
Stanford West, also known as Ohlone Field.
The Measure () proponents more than took
this into account: the housing is set back an
average of 290 ft. from San Francisquito
Creek. Both the Measure O and Measure M
supporters agree construction will not in any
way adversely affect the creek.
Another benefit of the expansion of Sand
I lill Road, along with the relief of the traffic
congestion, will be better access to the Med
ical Center. The proposal widens Quarry
Road from its current one lane, one way exit
off F.I ( amino toward the Medical Center to
four lanes — access desperately needed to
the emergency care unit of the center and to
the hospital in general. The Measure M
counterproposal, which provides for a third,
middle lane running the length of Sand Hill
Road that is reserved for emergency vehicles
and mass transportation, is actually a safety
hazard. Local ambulance drivers and fire
fighters are opposed to it.
The alternative to extensive Sand Hill
Road expansion. Measure M. will only per
petuate the bitter arguing that has gone on
for the past three decades. This proposal is a
series of recommendations and guidelines
for the University and the Palo Alto City
Council to work with, but not a complete
project in any form. In effect, it will send
everyone back to the drawing board with a
set of restrictions on land and building that
would stifle the city of Palo Alto for the next
decade.
Stanford is not in a position to go back to
the drawing board on this one. We've been
drawing for several years now, and the pic
ture we've finally come up with has been
altered by various editors along the way. We
urge a "yes" vote tomorrow on Measure ()
and a "no" vote on Measure M. As members
of the Stanford community, don't pull out
another eraser on this promising compro
mise.
