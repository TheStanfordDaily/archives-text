## Calling a square a square 
### 
Thank god I've
survived another
Halloween, man
aging to escape the may
hem by quietly excusing
myself from the vicinity.
This year I was camping
in the woods with friends
far away from the cos-

tumes and craziness. We were laughing and
singing around a campfire and snuggling
into our tents around the hour most parties
began.
I've been skipping out on Halloween
since junior high, that sad age when I
became too old for trick-or-treating, the
one good thing about this holiday. I never
successfully made the transition into grown
up traditions for All Hallow's Eve.
The typical Halloween celebration
seems to be no more than a good excuse for
bad fashion and self-destructive debauch
ery. For me it holds no appeal.
Simply because I'm square.
I don't subscribe to some organized reli
gion or moral philosophy that prohibits use
of substances. In fact, politically I'm even
pro-legalization of most drugs, because it
seems needless to me to criminalize people
who aren't hurting anyone but themselves.
I'm not even cool enough to qualify as
straight-edge, that hard core species of
squareness that listens to Minor Threat and
mandates substance abstinence as a requi
site for its breed of alternativeness.
This is just who I am. I don't ingest ille
gal substances, I don't inhale anything other
than air, the most I drink is a few sips of
wine at dinner once in a couple of lunar
cycles, and I don't consume caffeine.

Hell, I don't even eat meat. I rarely
indulge in dairy products. I avoid over the
counter medications and stick to organic
produce and natural detergents. And I'm
almost always in bed before midnight.
As you might have guessed by now, part
of my whole clean-living shtick is an exten
sion of my health kick. If there's a doctrine
I live by its one that goes: T his life is sacred.
Act accordingly.
My perspective stems from the fact that I
seem to have been given a body with a pre
carious homeostasis and have spent a con
siderable amount of my time on this planet
under the weather. In my mid-teens I was
diagnosed with a chronic illness called
lupus, a genetic auto-immune disease. Mine
is a relatively mild case, and while I'm
thankful that I have never had to battle with
more severe health concerns, I learned
young the preciousness of good health.
When waking up in the morning without
pain is a reason for celebration, it seems
absurd that people celebrate by feeding
their bodies substances that cause them to
wake up in pain.
All in the name of something called fun.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against fun.
For me, it usually means eating, dancing,
going to the theater or laughing around a
campfire with friends. Not the kind that
entails waking up with hangover.
I've had more than one friend try to con
vince me that some drugs have no negative
physical side effects, but instead are purely
psychological: that they aid relaxation and
can be a source of enlightenment. Well, last
time I checked, my brain was a part of my
body, and because I spend the majority of
my waking hours advancing my mind, I con

sider mental hygiene a good investment.
Besides, I think chemicals are poor sub
stitutes for yoga and a hot bath.
It's not that 1 think drugs are inherently
"had" â€” they are inherently neutral. But
the effects they have on our bodies is neces
sarily taxing, they pull us out of our balance
and away from mindfulness.
But the substance-free path is not neces
sarily superior to another path. Admittedly,
being sober has its downsides. It can be
socially isolating. Oh, I've learned to laugh
with my friends when they're drunk or high,
but ultimately the bonding that they get
from a shared experience is one that I'm not
in on.
Such is life when you've got your own
drummer.
I like the beat I'm marching to so I'll
stick to it. It tells me that nothing is worth
more than taking good care of myself, be it
fun, or even, (gasp) work. In academia
many seem to think its okay to abuse them
selves as long as it's in the name of good
grades. I say nothing is worth my well being.
My GPA is important to me as long as it
doesn't interfere with adequate sleep and a
good breakfast.
I'll write a ton of papers and go to a lot of!
classes in my time, but regardless of how;
many lives I have, I've only got one body
this time around. And I'm determined to
make the best of it.
Achieving goals may yield temporary
satisfaction, but this thing called health
gives perpetual joy.

Kerry Rodgers, a senior majoring in philos
ophy and form of visual art, promises to
make it to at least one frat party this year.
