Fond FloMo memories
1 read the opinion piece by F.lise Lip
kowitz on the Stanford freshman dorm expe
rience with tears in my eyes. I lived in Gavi
lan. in FloMo, 20 years ago. Seeing that in
print makes it look like a lifetime ago. but I
remember it as if it were yesterday. "1 still
identify myself as a (iavi, and I think of oth
ers who lived there in the same way. We had
Gavilan stationery. T-shirts and even a year
book full of pictures and our bizarre insiders
language ("steaming cleavages" comes to

mind). And my tics to my freshman dorm
remain evident in so many ways.
When I left Stanford for graduate school
at I larvard. seven out of 50 of my dormmates
showed up in Cambridge at one Harvard
program or another. It was like "going
home" whenever we were together. My most
treasured memory from my Harvard gradua
tion is the hug I shared with other Ciavis who
were getting Harvard graduate degrees that
day. We still stay in touch in many ways. Last
year, on the occasion of our 15th reunion, my
freshman dorm had a reunion on the side. It's
nice to know that life in the freshman dorms

is still so special. I often wish I could live that
way all over again.

Haeberle incorrect
about halogens
You bet! After reading Haeberle's letter
in The Daily, I decided to make a few simple
measurements to test his assertions. While a

borrowed 300-watt halogen torchiere pro
duced 10.4 footcandles of illumination on
my desk, a 65-watt compact-fluorescent
torchiere (smart lamp) produced 11.4 foot
candles. That's a 10 percent increase in illu
mination for one-fifth the energy, one-fifth
the carbon dioxide, one-fifth the nitrogen
oxides, one-fifth the carbon monoxide and
one-fifth the particulate matter put into the
atmosphere by our Cardinal cogen power
plant.
Of course if you want light on your desk
to help you with that late night studying that
Haeberle is so legitimately concerned about.

neither torchiere is going to do much good.
They're designed for background lighting.
My simple 18-watt fluorescent desk lamp is
right now putting 1(H) footcandles of illumi
nation onto tomorrow's lecture notes. That's
more dazzle than they'll have in the morn
ing.
Finally, to test the fire danger. I put Hae
berle's letter into the howl of the halogen
torchiere and measured the time needed for
ignition. Twelve seconds.
