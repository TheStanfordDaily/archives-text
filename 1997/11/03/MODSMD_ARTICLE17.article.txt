# Garry Grundy: Anything for the Kids
## The 						Jamba solution: boycott then bulldoze 
### 
I'VE NEVER HAD a Jamba Juice
smoothie before. Never! And 1 never
will.
Frankly, the whole idea of paying more
than three bucks for a drink that is neither
fermented, distilled or prescribed by a doc
tor sends chills down my pocket book!
Juices. Berries. A little secret sauce... el
voila. "$3.25, please."
That's some pretty damn expensive pro
duce. I mean — hell, you could get a value
meal at "Whopper World" for less.
However, it would be foolhardy of me to
demand that my fellow Stanford students
join me in boycotting of Jamba Juice mere
ly because I am poor and / or cheap. 1 would
have to serve up a really convincing expla
nation as to why you should jettison your
Jamba Juice fetish, take up a placard and
boycott what has come to epitomize the
Stanford dining experience.
Quite simply: the tone that Jamba Juice
has set for Tresidder Memorial Union is
unhealthy, divisive and limits the vibrancy
and animation of the student union.
Let's begin bv looking at the way they
reel students in. This would require that we
focus on Jamba Juice's advertising cam
paign on campus. The advertisement out
side of the "bar" at Tresidder proudly pro
claims: "Drink vour next meal!"

What kind of shit is that?
It sounds like a goddamn "Slimfast"
commercial: "Have a Jamba Juice smoothie
for breakfast, another for lunch and eat a
sensible dinner." People are meant to EAT
food; not drink it! 1 wonder how many other
primates "drink" their meals? Drink your
next meal?" Hell, these people are advertis
ing anorexia.
And the fact that this new health club
opened up right next door certainly doesn't
help the situation. Picture it: ultra-health
conscious Northern Californians and other
wanna-bees (i.e. most Stanford students)
sucking down a blended fruit salad through
a straw. I've heard 'em. It's disgusting. You
have too.
"I'm such a pig! I drank a whole Jamba
Juice smoothie for lunch. I've gotta' work
out." And after our favorite trend-following
Stanford student has emerged from the
ladies room (sequestered away for some
inordinate amount of time doing God
knows what), she hits the stair master.
Perhaps they are oblivious to the fact
that a health-kick can kill.
Then again, this whole hyper-health
thing is uniquely California!! — which is
reason enough for Jamba Juice's tremen
dous popularity.
Hut at what price?

From time to time, 1 go into trendy and
expensive downtown Palo Alto. The other
day, 1 had a revelation: these people up here
don't care about price. Just look at the
advertisements for some of these restau
rants: "Only six grams of fat." Or "1 ialf the
fat of a McDonald's Value Meal." 1 asked
myself: "Where is the price of the meal?"
The fact is. for these Stanford people,
price doesn't matter. Jamba Juice knows
this. It's all about looking good. At any
price.
That's why this whole juice bar / vegetar
ian / organic hoopla wouldn't fly where I am
from. Jamba Juice would go bankrupt in
South Phoenix — partly because residents
would be more willing to treat such an
establishment as an A IM than a juice bar.
II Dean Marc Wais was really on the
ball, he'd work on getting some good, clean
affordable eating up off in liesidder. 1
already have a few suggestions for our
enlightened dean.
First, let's run a hulldo/cr through
Jamba Juice; that would set the tone for all
other trendy, yuppie. California style estab
lishments that wanna transform all of Stan
ford into cherry-pickin'. bourgeois. Volvo
driving. anorexics.
Now. that we've eliminated the chief
offender, what do we put in its place?

How does a Kentucky Fried Chicken
sound? Or a McDonald's? Or better yet
a Popeye's Chicken and Biscuits! A Pop
eye's on campus would be ideal. (iood food,
and it won't set you back on paying this
quarter's tuition deferment. Moreover, a
Popeye's on campus would set many hearts
at ease; some of us gel tired of racing into
EPA before sunset so that we don't get
gunned down over a chicken leg and some
Cajun style mashed potatoes.
But if chicken isn't your thing, we could
certainly find something else to replace that
confounded juice bar.
1 low about a real bar? I have no doubt
that such a place could foster sentiments of
unity, fraternity and rapture. A real on
campus bar!
No more drunk driving to Fil Tori to try
ing to make Happy Hour. It'll all be at
l iesidder the students' union. We'd call
this new student bar "Wundcrßar" (in
honor of our exquisite Cierman president).
It would be divine. Fveryone would be
there. Imagine it! President Casper and Vice
Provost Montoya chillin' at Wiinderbar.
Casper booms: "1 vill hafv a schot of
Jaegermeister! And liii you, James?"
"Well. I'll take the Cuervo Ciold."
We'd have a certifiable, vibrant, active,
affordable hang out lor Stanford's All

American college hoys.
Some of you may have misgivings.
You're thinkin': "You carnivorous, eco
nomically-depressed, phallocrates. vou
you've already the C 'ol Id, Hon Appetit and
El Polio Key."
Whatever.
Ihe( ol 10. I I Polio Kipp ()IT and Had
Appetit are just as treiuh and expensive as
that cursed Jamba Juice. And now that con
struction's started on a Peel's C'oliee and
lea next to Green Library, our need lor
swift action becomes more urgent. My boy
cotling Jamba Juice, we let the world know
that we are fed up with the limited on cam
pus options at I'residder. We deserve a real
university student union not ilist an
extension of Palo Alto. But why limit iliis
boycott to jusi Jamba Juice? l et's include
all ol the restaurants at I'residder. Let's
send 'em all packin'! Right back where they
came from.
And il this boycott doesn't discourage
them, there's always time for another Big
(iame bonfire.

medietal studies, ircnch and lairo/wan Sunl

certainly find something else to replace that
confounded juice bar.
1 low about a real bar? I have no doubt
that such a place could foster sentiments of
unity, fraternity and rapture. A real on
campus bar!
No more drunk driving to Fil Tori to try
ing to make Happy Hour. It'll all be at
l iesidder the students' union. We'd call
this new student bar "Wundcrßar" (in
honor of our exquisite Cierman president).
It would be divine. Fveryone would be
there. Imagine it! President Casper and Vice
Provost Montoya chillin' at Wiinderbar.
Casper booms: "1 vill hafv a schot of
Jaegermeister! And liii you, James?"
"Well. I'll take the Cuervo Ciold."
We'd have a certifiable, vibrant, active,
affordable hang out lor Stanford's All

American college hoys.
Some of you may have misgivings.
You're thinkin': "You carnivorous, eco
nomically-depressed, phallocrates. vou
you've already the C 'ol Id, Hon Appetit and
El Polio Key."
Whatever.
Ihe( ol 10. I I Polio Kipp ()IT and Had
Appetit are just as treiuh and expensive as
that cursed Jamba Juice. And now that con
struction's started on a Peel's C'oliee and
lea next to Green Library, our need lor
swift action becomes more urgent. My boy
cotling Jamba Juice, we let the world know
that we are fed up with the limited on cam
pus options at I'residder. We deserve a real
university student union not ilist an
extension of Palo Alto. But why limit iliis
boycott to jusi Jamba Juice? l et's include
all ol the restaurants at I'residder. Let's
send 'em all packin'! Right back where they
came from.
And il this boycott doesn't discourage
them, there's always time for another Big
(iame bonfire.
