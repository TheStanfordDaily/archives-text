## Two roads diverged... Measure O 
### 
TOMORROW â€” FOR IHE first time in Stanford history the late of a
Stanford land-use proposal will be decided by Palo Alto voters. Two bal
lot measures claim to fix the long-standing Sand llill Road bottleneck,
improve traffic conditions and provide much needed rental housing and senior
housing on Stanford land. Only one does the job.
Measure () is the product of live years of hard work, extensive public scrutiny
and negotiation between Stanford and Palo Alto. T he details are spelled out in a
signed agreement between Stanford and Palo Alto that was unanimously
approved by the Palo Alio City Council.
Measure O approves a five-part system of roadway improvements. Measure
O will 1) widen Sand llill Road to four lanes west of Arboretum, 2) connect
Stockfann Road to ( ampus Drive. 3) create a new road. Vineyard Lane, behind
Nordstrom connecting Sand llill and Quarry Roads, 4) make major changes
in Quarry Road, including widening it to four lanes and connecting it to El
('amino with a new lull-service, stoplight-controlled intersection and 5) extend
Sand I lill Road to El ( amino Real.
( ollcctively, these roadway improvements will solve the Sand llill Road prob
lem and significantly reduce traffic congestion in the area. The rental and senior
housing are approved in detail, including exact locations, design, landscaping and.
importantly, special shuttle bus service and on-site child care for the rental hous
ing to reduce automobile use by residents.
I he environmental impacts of the Measure O projects are known. I hey have
been studied and evaluated in an approved eight volume Environmental Impact
Report (EIR). Funding for Measure O is also spelled out. Stanford University
will pay all costs, including more than $20 million for improvements to public
roads.
()pponents of Measure () condemn it for many reasons that stoplights will
bog down traffic, that Measure O is a "sausage" that cannot work and that the
housing should be relocated. Yet none of these charges can be sustained. I'he
stoplight system lias been evaluated: it improves traffic flow, not impedes it. Mea
sure ()'s five-part roadway improvement plan does not resemble the sausage car
toons that are a centerpiece ol the Measure M campaign.
Finally, the three housing sites specifically mentioned in Measure M were all
considered by the Palo Alto ( ity ( ouneil and rejected. For example. Measure M
suggests moving the Stanford West housing to the "Iloover Pavilion" site, but as
a Palo Alto stall report revealed, that really means putting the housing in the
Arboretum along Palm Drive and would require cutting down hundreds of trees.
No wonder Palo Alto and Stanford rejected M s "alternative" housing sites.
Measure M. in contrast to Measure O. does not approve any project at all.
Measure M is a set of general plan changes and instructions to the Palo Alto ( ity
( ouneil. it "requires" the extension of Sand I lill Road to I I ( amino Real, but it
does NOT provide any funding to do it.
Measure M also restricts Sand I lill Road from Santa Cruz Ave. to El ( amino
Real to two lanes for automobile traffic, with a possible third lane for emergen
cy and public vehicles.
Sand llill Road is failing now as a two-lane road, and the EIR shows that
restricting Sand 1 lill Road to two-lanes from Santa Cruz Ave. to El (amino Real,
as Measure M commands, will make traffic congestion worse than it is now. Fur
thermore, the professionals who use the Sand llill corridor Palo Alto lire
lighters. whose members provide paramedic transport to Stanford Medical Cen
ter. the bus drivers' union and the largest ambulance service in Santa Clara and
San Mateo counties are strongly opposed to Measure M. particularly the dan
gerous third lane (and they strongly support Measure O). Yet if Measure M pass
es. the two-lane restriction and the possible third lane will become law and can
not be changed before 2015 without a vote ol the people.
I he Measure M campaign tries to play the Menlo Park card to stop Measure
(). but it won't work. All nine Palo Alto City Council members (and the Palo
Alto Weekly and the San Jose Mercury News in their editorials) know ol Menlo
Park's particular opposition to the PaloAlto Stanford Sand 1 lill Road plan, now
embodied in Measure O. and they all concluded that the overall, long-run inter
est ol both Palo Alto and Menlo Park is best served by passage of Measure O.
As the San Jose Mercury News editorialized, "A vote for Measure O is a vote
for a better traffic circulation system through a regional commute corridor.... A
vote for Measure M is a vote for 20 more years of civic paralysis."
Lurry Norton is the director of the f>orernment and community relations at
Stanford.

Tomorrow palo alto resi
dents will vote on two proposals
regarding the future development of
Sand Hill Road and its surrounding area.
In recent years, Stanford has twice
approached the Palo Alto City Council
ahout the modifying the road and was twice
asked to revise its plan.
Measure O, Stanford's third and possibly
last attempt, proposes to expand Sand Hill
Road to four lanes, construct senior and
rental housing along Sand Hill and build an
additional 80,000 square feet at the Stanford
Shopping Center.
Measure M was placed on the ballot by
citizcn initiative as an alternative to Measure
O. Reflecting concerns of some Palo Alto
residents about increased traffic (low and
environmental damage. Measure M calls on
the University and the Palo Alto City Coun
cil to re-examine the proposal by placing
certain restrictions on the area's develop
ment.
This is a crucial referendum that will have
ramifications for the University's develop
ment into the 21st century and for the Uni
versity's future relationship with neighbor
ing communities.
