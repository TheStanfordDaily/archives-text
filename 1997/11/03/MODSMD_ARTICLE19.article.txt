# Measure M

### 
S TANFORD'S PROPOSED MASSIVE development on Sand Hill Road
(Measure O on Palo Alto's Nov. 4 ballot) is part of an overall University
growth strategy that threatens to seriously degrade the quality of life in
neighboring communities.
In an effort to reduce the social and environmental impacts of development
along Sand Hill Road, an alternative proposal, Measure M, was placed on the bal
lot by citizen initiative. A planning framework for sustainable development. Mea
sure M makes a lot more sense than Stanford's grandiose 1950s style development
scheme. II Measure M wins, Stanford will be forced to rethink its project.
Stanford's proposed development is problematic for several reasons. The envi
ronmental impact report predicts a near doubling of traffic on the road, yet its four
lanes would bottleneck down to two at each end, resulting in gridlock. The 2,(X)0-
plus people in the proposed mini-city next to the creek would further impede the
flow of traffic as they crossed the road by activating one of the proposed eleven
stoplights. And thousands of new workers and shoppers (lured from communities
around the Bay Area) would converge on the expanded shopping center (two foot
ball fields in size) and create even more congestion and pollution there and on
neighboring streets. ( These negative impacts would increase once Stanford's huge
medical center expansion is completed.)
In short, Stanford's proposed development is a dangerous boondoggle. Yet, it
stands on the verge of electoral victory. Why this suspension of critical assessment
on the part of thousands of intelligent people? The answer is that many people
have been seduced by Stanford and do not fully understand its objectives and mode
of operation.
In reality, there are two Stanfords. The first is the visible "do good, feel gtxxl"
institution dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge, rational discourse and service to
society. It is manifested by Nobel laureates, youthful scholars, stimulating cultural
events and alumni tailgate parties.
But there is a second, largely hidden, institution: "Stanford Inc." It is a state of
mind and mode of operation single mindedly devoted to increasing the wealth,
prestige and "greatness" of Leland Stanford Junior University. Stanford Inc. oper
ates on two basic assumptions: 1) for the University to thrive, it must constantly
expand physically and 2) to support this expansion, profits must be maximized. It
is manifested by the Stanford Land Management Company whose chief executive
receives a salary higher than the University's president.
Stanford Inc. wants to build out the entire Sand Hill side of campus (and, in the
process, foreclose future Palo Alto control over its expansion). From its perspec
tive, for the institution to remain competitive, every faculty member in science and
medicine must have his or, occasionally, her own lab and that requires constant
growth. Plus, this provides an opportunity to expand the mall and build senior
housing as "profit centers." And it can be packaged it as "traffic relief."
Stanford's Office of Government and Community Relations (an instrument of
Stanford Inc.) has attempted to exploit the University's beneficent image and
obscure its expansionist objectives. But. fortunately enough people are challenging
this mega project that, under pressure, the institution's dark side, Stanford Inc., is
starting to show through. For example, the University is:
•Violating the spirit, if not the letter, of non-profit tax law by spending enormous
amounts of money and engaging in hardball politics in order to win a local election
that serves its self interest.
•Employing thinly disguised intimidation tactics by surveying faculty and staff who
live in Palo Alto about their attitudes toward Sand Hill Road and offering to pay
them to do campaign phone banking.
•Deceiving the public about its Sand Hill project. A citizen-initiated law suit was
necessary to correct Stanford's false claim in the ballot argument that its measure
would widen the road to four lanes beyond the Menlo Park bridge.
Stanford's entrenched position on Sand Hill is unfortunate. With some down
sizing, relocation of facilities and creative traffic reduction strategies, the develop
ment would have been supported by the vast majority of people in neighboring
communities.
Instead, Stanford's administration has allowed itself to be ruled by the institu
tion's shadow side. Win or lose at the polls, the University is losing an enormous
amount of respect and community good will that will be difficult if not impossible
to recoup.

tomorrow's Palo Alto ballot.
