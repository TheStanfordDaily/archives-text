### Berra Yazar 
Laughing skeletons, pungent in
cense, candles and an aura of joyous
yet solemn remembrance character
ized this year's El Dfa de los Muer
tos, or Day of the Dead.
Friday night's celebrations began
with a ceremony in the memory of
Lora Romero. Casa Zapata's ex-res
ident fellow who died three weeks
ago in Pacifica. Her picture decorat
ed an altar amid candles, paper flow
ers, dancing skeleton cut-outs and
miniature painted skulls.
Last year's El Dfa de los Muertos
celebration was in the memory of the
late Jos£ Antonio Burciaga, the Za
pata RF before Romero, who died of
cancer almost exactly a year before
her.
Senior Migdalia Gamboa orga
nized this year's celebrations. "It is
an Amerindian Spanish tradition to
mock death on this day. It used to be
more religious when we celebrated it

at home, however," Gamboa said.
Freshman Dena Duthoy, who
celebrated the holiday in Mexico fre
quently, said they "use this day to
look at death differently. It's a cele
bration of our mortality, but it's not
so serious. In Mexico they have big
parties that require days of prepara
tion."
"It's a mixture of the Catholic
Halloween strongly tainted with na
tive Mexican superstition, since an
cestor worship is not a part of the
Catholic religion and that's mainly
what this day is."
Alan Aeosta, director of Stanford
News Service and the current RF in
Zapata, and senior Veronica Luna
led the ceremony, which began with
a blessing for mother Earth by David
Yanez. We must always remember
that there might not be a tomorrow
and live accordingly, said Yanez in
Spanish.
The Rev. Patrick Laßelle, a Do
minican priest serving the Stanford

Catholic community, said that he
was "convinced that only some peo
ple truly understand death" and that
"we must gain perspective through
celebrating it for it to make sense."
After the audience — to the
rhythm of light Latin American
music — placed momentos for their
dead on the altar, I .uis Fraga, associ
ate professor of Political Science,
talked about his friend Lora
Romero, as the Memorial Church
bells chimed in.
"Lora was full of surprises,"
Fraga said, "Hut the one part ol her
that would never change was her un
limited passion. She was one of the
most giving people I've ever known.
I know she must of had a sense of
how much love she left behind."
"The Wizard of Aztlan," a play
by Teatro Xicano, followed this
solemn yet amusing speech. The
play sought to draw attention to po
