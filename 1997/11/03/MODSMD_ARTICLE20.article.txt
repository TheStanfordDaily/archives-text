Stanford "bribing"
voters
I've got an ax to grind with Stan
ford over this Measure C) business.
I read somewhere that by the
end of this campaign. Stanford Uni
versity will spend way more than
$1(K) for each vote they get in favor
of Measure C); on marketing, image
consultants, political consultants, all
kinds of signs and mailers, lobbying
the city council and the elderly, cof
fee parties, out-of-town telemar
keters. etc. etc.
Well, that's just not fair. That
should be my $HH). and I won't see
a dime of it. It's my vote, for crying
out loud! What thev ought to do is
lust send me a check. What the hey.
I'll do it for $80 (after the check
clears, anyway), and they'll save
twenty bucks!
You see. here's what puzzles me.
Stanford is supposed to be about
enlightenment and learning. And
yet. it seems like they're going about
this thing in absolutely the dumbest
way possible.

Stanford seems to have com
pletely missed out on the real bene- s
fit of the project, namely that it 1
makes a zillion dollars for Stanford, 112
some of which could he spread a lit
tle. But instead of the direct
approach, they're fooling around
with the electoral process: finding c
people who don't understand these I
things, convincing them how twice t
the road plus four times the cars
make less traffic, and so on. 1
They try to explain how two-bed- J
room condos that sell for $500,000
will make living in Palo Alto afford
able and how everybody on Sand
Hill Road will commute on High
way 280 to Los Altos Hills, instead
of on Highway 101 through down- t
town Palo Alto.
Folks, this is just a waste of
everybody's time. Sharp money
buys wholesale! 1
You look at who's doing the 1
actual leg work on these campaigns: i
knocking on doors, phoning people s
at night and so on. Now, the "O"
people are leg professionals. But the I
"M" people all seem to be my 1
neighbors. (

It seems to me that anybody
spending their time walking around
knocking on doors and not getting
paid for it probably is just not real
sharp, and could use a few
simoleans.
You'd think Stanford University
could figure all this out. All those
Nobel Prize winners — what are
they doing there, anyhow?
When 1 was a freshman in col
lege. a nice couple named Dick and
Jing — one of whom was even a uni
versity president — came to my dor
mitory and hosted a coffee party
where thcv said things about com
munity responsibility, ethics, leader
ship and how there was more to life
than power and money.
It used to be that when an
entrepreneurial developer wanted
something that was good for him
but lousy for his neighbors, all he
had to do was go out and steal it; but
if that failed he could always bribe
somebody.
