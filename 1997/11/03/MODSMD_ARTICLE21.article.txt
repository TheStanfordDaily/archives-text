# Project not a winner in bottom line terms
## University says public benefit of traffic relief and housing justifies low investment return 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Regardless of how the University choos
es to finance the $342-million Sand Hill ini
tiative should Measure C) pass, the financial
return on its investment will be much less
than normal.
However, University officials say the in
tangible benefit of expected improved traf
fic on Sand Hill will make its investment
worthwhile.
The road improvements of Measure O
would create a true "free rider" situation,
whereby people benefit from a public utili
ty without paying for it. Fifty percent of fu
ture users of Sand Hill Road will have no
connection to Stanford, said Curtis Feeny,
an executive vice president of the Stanford
Management Company.
Normally, roads are financed through
taxes or taxpayer-approved bonds. In this
case, Stanford has consented to fund the
entire project.
"We are stepping into w hat is normally a
government-funded issue," Feeny said.
Stanford expects a lower return from the
development because of the tremendous

amount of non-project-related infrastruc
ture for which it will pay.
The project has two major sources of
revenue: rent from the housing projects and
rent from the additional space in the Stan
ford Shopping Center.
In addition to infrastructure expenses,
University revenues will also he con
strained by the types of housing it hopes to
huild.
The University has already agreed to sell
25 percent of its faculty / staff housing at re
duced rates to accommodate low- and
medium-income families. Additionally, the
University sometimes reduces housing ex
penses when recruiting top-notch profes
sors.
Further, the rent rate on Stanford's pro
posed senior citizen housing must remain
competitive with local market prices, Feeny
said.
"These projects are not attractive busi
ness deals because of the exceptionally high
public-benefit costs that are built into
them." said Larry Norton, director of gov
ernment and community relations.
"If this were a straight business proposi
tion based on rates of return, we would

have bailed oul long ago," Norton ex
plained.
In order to finance the project, Stanford
must receive approval from the Stanford
Management Company hoard of directors
and possibly from the University Board of
Trustees, Feeny said. If Measure O is ap
proved, Feeny said construction would
begin next fall.
Stanford will not consider how it will fi
nance the initiative until after the election,
but F eeny said the University has a number
of options. It could borrow directly from its
endowment, sell taxable commercial bonds
or borrow from a bank or life insurance
company.
Additionally, the University could bring
in outside equity, in which investors would
receive a portion of the return though not a
claim to Stanford's land.
Feeny said, however, that the financial
costs will be well worth the desired out
come.
"The hope is that we put to bed once and
for all the completely irrational traffic sys
tem that bottlenecks the Stanford Shopping
Center that has a real long-term threat to
the University," Feeny said.
