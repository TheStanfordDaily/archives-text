Sophomore defensive lineman Riall Johnson and senior defensive end Kailee
Wong take down UCLA quarterback Cade McNown.
"We need to focus," Willingham
said. "This is territory we've never
been in for probably the last 2 I /2or
2 3/4 years."
Stanford's recent offensive woes
continue. In its last five games, the
('ardinal has scored 58,33,22,14 and
7 points. Notice a trend?
"Emotion and intensity," said ju
nior center Mike McLaughlin, iden
tifying what he feels Stanford has
been missing in its last three games.

Stanford came within 42 seconds
of being UCLA's first Pac-10
shutout victim in 10 years. The Car
dinal scored its only points on a 35-
yard strike to senior Jimmie Johnson
from sophomore backup quarter
back Todd I lusak in the final minute.
The same problems that have
killed Stanford in its last two losses
hurt even more Saturday.
The first is turnovers. After com
bining for 10 giveaways in the previ
ous two games, Stanford turned it
over four times against UCLA.
But Stanford's biggest problem
was its complete lack of a running

game. The Cardinal totaled minus
-34 yards rushing, the fewest allowed
by UCLA in its 78-year history.
"Every football team tries to stay
away from being as one-dimension
al as possible," Willingham said.
The 47 yards lost on six UCLA
sacks didn't help the Cardinal's
rushing total. Redshirt sophomore
quarterback Chad Hutchinson hung
in all game, completing 18 of 36 pass
es for 197 yards, but when he wasn't
being sacked, Hutchinson was hit
nearly every time he threw.
" They bring a lot of heat," said se
nior fullback Jon Ritchie. "We were

prepared for what they brought to
the table, we just had a letdown."
The Bruins took the opening
kickoff and drove 59 yards, scoring
on a 4-yard run by senior tailback
Skip Hicks. Hicks, whose 20 touch
downs are a UCLA single-season
record, enjoyed a big day, rushing
for 121 yards and three touchdowns.
On IJCLA's third possession, the
Cardinal sacked Bruins quarterback
Cade McNown at the UCLA 9, forc
ing the Bruins to punt and seeming
ly shifting the momentum in Stan
ford's favor.
But the Cardinal was flagged for

a 15-yard personal foul for illegal
contact with the snapper, and
UCLA had a first down.
Shortly thereafter, Rodney Lee,
caught a screen pass near the line of
scrimmage and raced 73 yards past a
blitzing Stanford defense to the Car
dinal 1-yard line. Hicks scored on
first down for a 14-0 IJCLA lead.
The Stanford defense played well
after the first quarter, limiting
UCLA's high-powered offense to
just two field goals and a late fourth
quarter touchdown.
Stanford's much-maligned sec
ondary held McNown to his worst

day of the season. Senior end Kailee
Wong also dominated along the line
with eight tackles and 1 1/2 sacks.
Too bad the first-string Cardinal
offense couldn't muster a point.
Now. in just three games. Stan
ford has gone from a 4-1 team
ranked among the nation's best to a
.S(H) club struggling to find its way
out of a funk.
" There were a lot of expectations
this year." said sophomore Hanker
Troy Walters. "We're down. We just
have to stick together and finish
strong. We'll try to go to L.A. next
week and beat USC."
