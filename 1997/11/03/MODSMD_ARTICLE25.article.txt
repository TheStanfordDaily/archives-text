had the better of the play," Clark
said. "They played well. I have no
complaints."

of Indiana," ( lark said, the team is
reassured. "I think we know we can
outplay them," he s;iid.

be only the first meeting between

"We have six weeks now to get
ready for them, hopefully in the
Final Four," Clark said. "That's a
great incentive for the team."
In yesterday's meeting with the
Dons, the teams played evenly,
each taking nine shots on goal. Za

Vaughn, a junior, each made three

saves.
Neither team showed exception

the Dons outshot the Cardinal 5-2.

diana game, Stanford stepped up
the pace.
Hut IJSF slipped ahead just be
fore time ran out when junior for
ward Inge Klevberg took a cross
from senior midfielder Keith
Ratzburg and knocked it past Za
pala.
"It was a great game," Clark
said, i was really proud of the boys
for the way they played in the sec
ond half."
