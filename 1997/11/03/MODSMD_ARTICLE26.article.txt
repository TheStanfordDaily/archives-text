The Cardinal (22-2, 13-0 Pacific

end wilh a difficult three game win
over the Bruins 15 10,15 11.15-10.
I JC'LA (10 10. 5 8). not even close
ly resembling the Uruin team that's
struggled .ill year, was tenacious
from the start.
I he opening minutes ol game
one were little more than an ex
change ol sideouls. I list five points
into the game, Folkl pounded down
career kill No. 1 .MM).
The Card eventually pulled ahead
13-10. After an exchange of sideouts,
Stanlord pulled to game point on a
bullet by Folkl. then iced the win with
a Barbara Ifejika-Folkl block.
"I don't think we were real sharp
tonight," said head coach Don

Shaw. "But we played well enough
to win. We've been winning a lot of
rallies with our blocking defense,
and tonight we let a couple get
away."
Games two and three were char
acterized by early runs by the Cardi
nal that the Bruins rallied to answer.
Stanford had a 10-4 lead early in
game two, but UCLA fought back
with seven unanswered points to

take an 11-10 advantage.
1 hat's when the Stanford block
answered. Folkl and sophomore
outside hitter kerri Walsh put one
up to tie it 11-11. Then Walsh and
freshman middle blocker Jennifer
Detmer combined for two more.
Detmer notched a solo block for
game point, and Ifejika nailed the
sideline on a kill lor the game.
In came three. Stanford ran nut

to its biggest lead of the match, 11-4.
UCLA pulled within 13-10. but a
Bruin hitting error supplied match
point, and Folkl and Detmer won a
shoving match at the net for the win.
With four block assists against the
Bruins and two more against USC,
Ifejika passed Amy Cooper for fifth
place on Stanford's all-time total
blocks list with 352.
"I'm a little surprised." Ifejika
said of the accomplishment. "But
I'm happy."
Against I'SC. Stanford showed
off its acrobatic abilities, making
some of the best digs Maples has
seen all year. The intensity fueled
the Cardinal early on, as Stanford
claimed games one and two with
ease 15-3, 15-7.
"I was really happy with games
one and two," Shaw said. "In game
three we went a little flat and gave
them too many opportunities."
The Women of Troy (17-4, l M)
took advantage, running out to a 14-
en route to a 15-11 win that ended
Stanford's string of six straight
matches without dropping a game. Il
was just the second game the Cardi
nal has dropped in conference play.
But Stanford rebounded in game
four, as Shaw switched his lineup
around, starting Folkl in the middle
back position in the rotation for a
better matchup at the net. The strat
egy paid off as Folkl pounded down
kill after kill in the deciding game.
"That got us back into the
matchups we wanted," Shaw said.
"Forget about (lie offense. We just
had our best hitler against their weak
est blocker. It worked nicely lor us."
I he power-charged offense pro
duced the first nine points of game
four and the Cardinal never looked
back, winning the match 15-2 and os
tablishing a four-match lead in the
"ae-10 with jusi five contests re
maining.
