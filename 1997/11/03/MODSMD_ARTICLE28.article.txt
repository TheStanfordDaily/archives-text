Stanford 4, Oregon 0

The Cardinal took another step in
forgetting its troubled times, scoring
two more convincing wins over
league rivals — this time Oregon and
Oregon State — to extend its win
streak to six games.
The Cardinal, now 10-7 overall (5-
2 Pacific 10 Conference), needed the

victories to stay in the playoff hunt.
Only two games remain — next
weekend at Arizona and Arizona
State — and a third league loss would
end the Cardinal's postseason hopes.
In the meantime, the team has
been doing its utmost to keep those
hopes alive.
Friday the Cardinal offense put on
an show unequaled this season, rout
ing a hapless Beaver team 7-1.
Just 10 minutes into the match,
the Cardinal was up 2-0 and on its
way to its highest goal total since an
8-0 win over Sacramento State in
1995. Only a goal with five minutes
left allowed Oregon State to avoid
the shutout.
Senior captain Emily Burt had
three goals, giving her a team-high 15
on the season, and sophomore Jen
O'Sullivan notched three assists.
Burt's 15 goals are tied for third best
in Stanford history, behind only
Sarah Rafanelli, who scored 20 in

1993 in 16 in 1991.
As a team, the Cardinal outshot
Oregon State a whopping 31-2.
"We can't compete with that kind
of a team," said Oregon State head
coach Tom Rowney. "It's not possi
ble."
After beating the Beavers, the
Card took its must-win act to Eugene,
Ore., yesterday to face the Ducks and
emerged with a 4-0 shutout.
The Cardinal held Oregon to just
one shot while sending 16 balls to
ward Duck goalie Stacey 1 lebert.
Stanford jumped in front at 10
minutes, 44 seconds when junior for
ward Tracye Lawyer punched one in
off a cross pass from Burt. Freshman
forward Karin Brett then took a cor
ner pass from sophomore midfielder
Ronnie Fair and sent it into the net
for a 2-0 lead.
The score remained 2-0 until the
last five minutes of the game, when
junior Becka Livermore scored from

the right corner to put the Cardinal
ahead 3-0. Junior midfielder Christy
Stoffel put the cap on the victory
with less than a minute left.
The wins come at a critical time
for the Cardinal. The Oregon trip
was the first substantial road trip
since the beginning of September,
and the first against Pac-10 teams.
The team's matches next weekend
against Arizona and Arizona State
again take Stanford away from its
home turf.
With Arizona State's 3-2 upset
win over I JSC and 3-0 loss to UCLA
this weekend. Stanford has jumped
from fifth place into a four-way tie
for second, joining No. 19 USC (14-
3-1). Arizona State (10-7) and Wash
ington (7-10).
No. 22 UCLA (15-2, 7-0) has
clinched a lie for the Pac-10 title and
can secure the league's automatic bid
to the 32-team NCAA tourney with
one more win.
If there were any lingering doubts
about the Stanford women's soccer
team and its surprising turnaround
this season, they vanished into thin air
this weekend.
