Pepperdine 9, Stanford 8

The No. 3 Stanford men's water
polo team fell to top-ranked Pep

in a reprise of the Cardinal's 4-2
upset of the previously unbeaten
Waves Oct. 19.
Pepperdine senior two-meter
man Alan Hermann scored the
game-winning goal with only six sec
onds to play.
With the goal, the Waves (19-1,7-
0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) secured a 9-8 victory over the

Cardinal (13-5, 4-2) and clinched at
least a tie for the MPSF title.
Stanford junior defenseman
Layne Beaubien tied the match for
the fourth time with one second re
maining in the third quarter when
his left-handed shot sailed past
Waves goalie Merrill Moses,
evening the score 7-7.
Stanford then seized an 8-7 lead
with 2:45 to play in the fourth on a
trademark garbage goal by sopho
more fielder Andy Walburger.
But with less than a minute re
maining in regulation, the Waves
gained a 6-on-5 power-play advan
tage.
Both teams converged in front of
the Cardinal goal, and with 35 sec
onds to go, Pepperdine'sTodd King
netted a shot to tie the match 8-8 and
set the stage for Hermann's dramat
ic game-winner.
"11 bought we held our own," said
Stanford head coach Dante Detta
manti. "We are capable of beating
the best teams."

Senior holeman Nathan Osborn
agreed.
"Once again we proved we're as
tough as them in the water," Osborn
said.
Saturday the Cardinal defeated
No. 5 UCLA, the defending NCAA
champions, 8-7 at deGuerre in its
third win in as many tries against the
Bruins this season.
Sophomore driver Brian Heiffer
on sparked a four-goal Cardinal
scoring burst on a goal with 5:45 re
maining in the first.
The Cardinal then held on de
spite a Bruin counterattack that cul
minated in three consecutive fourth
quarter goals.
"UCLA, to their credit, bounced
back," Dettamanti said. But "we
had the lead the whole game, and we
were never in" any serious danger,
Dettamanti said.
The weekend split leaves the Car
dinal in third place in the MPSF, 2 1/2
Wavers ;ind jl, 1/2
back of No. 4 California (16-5,6-1).
