For hundreds of East Palo Alto chil
dren. Halloween was not spent cruising the
sidewalks for neighborhood goodies,
rather it was spent braving the spooky
haunted house labyrinth constructed by the
Theta Delta Chi fraternity and the Kappa
Alpha Theta sorority.
Trick-or-treating is prohibited by East
Palo Alto legislation, mainly due to the
city's crime rate and safety concerns that
generates.
"For me. Halloween was always one of
the most fun nights of the year, and I'd hate

to think that kids wouldn't be able to have
a good time on Halloween," said sopho
more Dan Perkel.
More than 50 fraternity and about 30
sorority members helped build the haunted
house from Wednesday to Friday, working
more than nine hours each day.
"It took a lot of time and effort on our
part, but it was definitely rewarding," said
senior Filip Vanaeht.
It was fulfilling "to have those kids have
something on Halloween," senior Jessica
Schulman added.
The event was held at the Bell Center,

an East Palo Alto community house.
Eighty boards were painted and dec
orated to form a maze, which was
covered by a large tarp. Guides in
costumes led groups of five through
the haunted house.
In the "arms room," slits were cut
into the panel walls, through which
hands grabbed passersby. The ceme
tery room was host to a smoke ma
chine and a coffin, from which a man

arose, scaring visitors.
Another room featured a strobe
light and a checkerboard design,
where Theta Delts stood still before
jumping from their crouches. Some
kids went through the maze as many
as seven times. Each time, students in
the maze hid in different places.
"Some of them even helped out,"
said Perkel. "There were kids that
came in and participated in helping
scare other kids."
Movies and games were available
in an adjacent room for kids who

didn't want to go in the haunted
house or were simply waiting for
their parents to pick them up.
"It must be pretty harsh for a par
ent to tell their kid that they can't
trick-or-treat," said Vanacht. "The
parents of the kids appreciated it as
much as the kids did because it wasn't
a wasted Halloween for the kids."
"I thought it was worthwhile to
help kids have a good time on Hal
loween, whereas otherwise they
wouldn't have been able to," added
Perkel.
