For hundreds of East Palo Alto chil
dren. Halloween was not spent cruising the
sidewalks for neighborhood goodies,
rather it was spent braving the spooky
haunted house labyrinth constructed by the
Theta Delta Chi fraternity and the Kappa
Alpha Theta sorority.
Trick-or-treating is prohibited by East
Palo Alto legislation, mainly due to the
city's crime rate and safety concerns that
generates.
"For me. Halloween was always one of
the most fun nights of the year, and I'd hate

to think that kids wouldn't be able to have
a good time on Halloween," said sopho
more Dan Perkel.
More than 50 fraternity and about 30
sorority members helped build the haunted
house from Wednesday to Friday, working
more than nine hours each day.
"It took a lot of time and effort on our
part, but it was definitely rewarding," said
senior Filip Vanaeht.
It was fulfilling "to have those kids have
something on Halloween," senior Jessica
Schulman added.
The event was held at the Bell Center,
