# Stanford's offense pulls disappearing act in loss
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
Here's a discouraging statistic:
minus-34 yards rushing.
That represented Stanford's of
fensive production on the ground in
its 27-7 loss to UCLA Saturday at
Stanford Stadium. A game that was
supposed to mark a new beginning
for the struggling Cardinal ended up
leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of
both players and coaches.
"I think when you face three con
secutive losses, it's frustrating," said
Stanford head coach Tyrone Will
ingham. "This is the most frustrated
I've been since I've been here."
Senior running backs Anthony
Bookman and Mike Mitchell com
bined for 19yardsonthegroundin 10
carries.
One problem was that Stanford
had the ball for only 4 minutes, 23
seconds in the opening period. The
Cardinal ran a total of nine plays
during that span, and each posses
sion resulted in a punt.
By the end of the first half, Stan
ford had gained only 16 yards rush
ing — 10 of them came on a run by
Mitchell with only 16 seconds left in
the half and UCLA aiming only to
prevent a big play.

"Through the course of the game,
we kept coming back to the running
game," Willingham said. "We were
never able to effectively get the run
ning game moving."
The running game was not the
only stagnant part of Stanford's
troubled offense. Cardinal quarter
back Chad Hutchinson struggled in
the early going, completing only two
of his first six passes.
It didn't help when UCLA
jumped out to an early 14-0 lead,
capitalizing on a bizarre call against
Stanford. The Card was flagged for
prematurely making contact with
the Bruin long snapper during a
punt. The opposing team must wait
one second before making contact
with the center during punts because
of his vulnerability.
Instead of having the ball at its
own 45 down seven points, the Card
soon found itself trailing by 14.
Unable to establish the run and
falling behind early, Stanford resort
ed primarily to the passing game. The
Bruins teed off on Hutchinson, blitz
ing relentlessly from all over the field
and giving him little time to throw.
"I would say they're one of the
better pass rushes (we've faced), said
junior center Mike McLaughlin.
"They definitely confused us and

they have a lot of speed, and that's
really important for a pass rush. I
would say they're up there."
Stanford didn't make a first down
until 12 minutes remained in the
half. On that drive, the Card finally
moved the ball, driving to the Bruin
35. Then on third and 11, the snap
sailed past Hutchinson and was re
covered by UCLA on Stanford's 44.
"I'm not going to place any
blame," Hutchinson said. "It's just
one of those things that happens. We
have to just get that straightened
out."
In the second half, the Cardinal
moved the ball occasionally but never
penetrated deep into Bruin territory.
Stanford found its way into the
red zone for a split second early in
the fourth quarter on a completion
to redshirt freshman receiver
Deßonnie Pitts. But Pitts coughed
up the ball, ending Stanford's drive
at the Bruin 8-yard line.
The only other time Stanford
moved past the IJC'LA 20 was in the
game's final minute, well after the
Bruins had called off the dogs.
"I thought we were prepared for
what they brought to the table, I just
think we had some letdowns as an of
fense," said senior fullback John
Ritchie.
