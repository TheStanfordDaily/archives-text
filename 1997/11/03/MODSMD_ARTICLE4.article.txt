The students at The Peninsula Chil
dren's Center were waiting impatiently for
the Stanford-based band. Canvas, to arrive.
"Am I going to be boogieing on down!"
said a young girl.
David Chen, a Stanford senior and
founder of Kids With Dreams, had
arranged for the band to play at the school's
afternoon Halloween party. While the
band set up their equipment, the kids
munched on cookies and dressed up as
M&Ms. goblins and bloody basketball
players. Once the music started, teachers

and students alike "boogied on down."
Chen created Kids with Dreams this fall
to provide Stanford students with an op
portunity to work with developmentally
handicapped children. "I wanted to address
a new under-served population," he ex
plained.
The Peninsula Children's Center pro
vides a supportive environment for chil
dren whose disabilities make it impossible
for them to function in the Palo Alto public
school system, according to David Lurie,
the school's director.
The students at the center have a
wide range of emotional distur
bances and mental disabilities, from
autism to schizophrenia. "These are
people who need to be understood,"
Lurie explained. "We provide them
with a place to remake their image of
themselves, somewhere they can
start to see themselves as a success."
The volunteers at the school serve
in a wide variety of programs. Some
work in the after-school recreation
program, using play to teach the chil
dren interactive and life skills. Others
volunteer in a group home for six
adolescent boys, developing pro
grams to teach them vocational and
daily living skills, such as gardening
and cooking.
Kids With Dreams has helped the
school set up a one-on-one mentor
ing program. Each volunteer acts as a
big sibling to a child, tutoring and dri
ving him or her home after school.
Corey Karlin, a Stanford senior,
works as a classroom assistant. Kar
lin volunteers three to four hours

every week, tutoring older children
in math. She even tutors one girl in
calculus, a subject with which her reg
ular teachers couldn't help.
The school, which serves 55 to 6()
students, specializes in personal at
tention. The student-teacher ratio is
often as high as two students per
teacher. "Our success is based on our
high staffing ratio," Lurie said. "The
volunteers really help that."
Kaneez Munjee, a music graduate
student at Stanford, volunteers at the
school's early intervention program,
which targets children from one to six
years old. It works to improve the
children's language, communication
and interactive skills before they
enter the school system.
"It takes a while to see the
progress, but these are little kids so
the improvement really does begin to
show," Munjee said.
"Children who go into this pro
gram have a better chance to develop
as normally as possible," Chen em
phasized. By working with the chil
dren early on, the program aims to in
crease their societal independence in
the future, he said.
Kids With Dreams currently has

twenty-five volunteers, who must
commit to the program for two quar
ters. Chen hand-picked each volun
teer after a personal interview. He
looks for people with "passion, pa
tience, sincerity and commitment."
Chen said he hopes to establish
Kids With Dreams as a state-wide
and perhaps even a national organi
zation. To pursue his dream, he's
considering applying for a Truman
Scholarship after he graduates so he
can work full-time on his budding or
ganization.
By the height of the party, three of
the children were jamming with the
band in the courtyard. Two played the
tambourine and one young man kept
time with the drummer. The refresh
ments, the costumes, even the party it
self all were signs of the diversity of ac
tivity that the school provided.
At the same time, the party was
closely supervised by the school's
staff. Not all the students were out
side dancing and eating cookies.
Some were required to stay inside the
classrooms. It served as a reminder
that underneath the Halloween cos
tumes were children with very special
needs.
