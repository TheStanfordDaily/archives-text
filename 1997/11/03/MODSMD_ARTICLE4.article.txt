The students at The Peninsula Chil
dren's Center were waiting impatiently for
the Stanford-based band. Canvas, to arrive.
"Am I going to be boogieing on down!"
said a young girl.
David Chen, a Stanford senior and
founder of Kids With Dreams, had
arranged for the band to play at the school's
afternoon Halloween party. While the
band set up their equipment, the kids
munched on cookies and dressed up as
M&Ms. goblins and bloody basketball
players. Once the music started, teachers

and students alike "boogied on down."
Chen created Kids with Dreams this fall
to provide Stanford students with an op
portunity to work with developmentally
handicapped children. "I wanted to address
a new under-served population," he ex
plained.
The Peninsula Children's Center pro
vides a supportive environment for chil
dren whose disabilities make it impossible
for them to function in the Palo Alto public
school system, according to David Lurie,
the school's director.
