# Sand Hill Project goes to the polls
## PA voters to settle expansion debate tomorrow 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Despite campaign promises that Measure M or Measure
C) will solve the current and future congestion problems on
Sand Hill Road, tomorrow's Palo Alto election is about
much more than traffic.

News
analysis

The resident-sponsored Measure M re
stricts Sand Hill to a maximum of three
lanes, and its supporters contend t hat real
traffic reduction will occur only if com-

muters use public transportation to enter campus from In
terstate 280.
Stanford's Measure O, which extends a portion of Sand
Hill to four lanes, also builds housing for 1 H) new resi
dents and brings many new traffic lights to the area.
Proponents of each measure claim that their respective
initiative is the best way to solve the traffic problem, and
though the University's claim is supported by volumes of
environmental impact documentation. Measure M sup
porters are using numerous tactics to discredit the research.
A major issue of this campaign, not uncommon to mu
nieipal politics, is whether voters will allow their communi
ty's largest, most powerful economic stimulus Stanford
to Ilex its muscle freely, in this case by building up to the

Palo Alto-Menlo Park border.
Stanford's light certainly has not been cheap. With $5
million already spent over the last live years and $342 mil
lion at stake, the I University hopes Palo Alto w ill finally ac
quiesce to a series of changes to the northwestern corner of
I .eland and Jane Stanford's farm.
Only three subsections of the Stanfords' original K,2(X)
acres remain viable for its inheritors to develop — the area
surrounding Sand Hill Road between Arboretum Road
and the Oak Creek Apartments, the arboretum on the
northeast section of the campus running past Palm Drive
and the westernmost region between the Stanford Golf
('ourse and San Prancisquito ('reek.
The growing demand for faculty housing over the last
decade has caused University officials it) prioritize how
each land sector will be used. The arboretum area will not
he built on, the University decided, and the western 139
acres have been reserved for any future academic expan
sion.
I his leaves the area surrounding Sand I lill, now occu
pied mostly by dirt, trees, squirrels and the occasional
heron. Stanford hopes lo build 638 residential units for fac
ulty and another 500 units for senior citizens, both across
Sand Hill on the Palo Alto-Menlo
Park border.
Stanford's project
To attempt to remedy the huge in
crease in traffic an additional 1,900
residents would bring, Stanford
hopes to widen Sand Hill to four
lanes from Arboretum Road to Santa
Cruz Avenue.
Stanford has spent $5 million
drafting a comprehensive environ
mental impact report and negotiating
with the Palo Alto City Council,
which unanimously approved Mea
sure O for tomorrow's ballot.
If Measure O is approved, Stan
ford will spend $342 million over the
next five years on a number of new
projects:
• Sand Hill Road, which now ends
at the Stanford Shopping Center
parking lot. will be extended to El
Camino Real. Measure C) calls for
only a two-lane road from Arbore
tum, though the University originally
favored a four-lane extension before
negotiations with the Palo Alto City
Council.
• Sand Hill will be extended to
four lanes from Arboretum to the
Menlo Park border, about 500 yards
before Santa Cruz Avenue. Stanford
eventually hopes to add an additional
two lanes on the Menlo Park strip of
Sand Hill as well.
• Quarry Road, now four lanes
from Campus Drive to Arboretum,
will be extended to El Camino where
a signal light will be added.
• Two new roads will be built con
necting Sand Hill to west campus.
Stock Farm Road, which currently
connects Campus Drive to Oak
Road will be extended to Sand Hill;
Oak Road will be extended to pro
vide better access to Stanford Med
ical Center. A new road will be added
connecting Sand Hill to Ouarry south
of the Stanford Shopping Center.
• Stanford will build and operate
628 apartments, mostly for faculty
and staff, on the open field next to
Sand Hill Road. Under an agreement
with the Palo Alto City Council, over
time 25 percent of these apartments
will be rented at lower rates for low
and moderate-income households.
• Stanford will lease to Palo Alto
for $1 a year one half acre in the fac
ulty apartment complex for a child
care center.
• Stanford will build a second
housing complex, for senior citizens,
east of the faculty apartments. Locat
ed at the site of the old children's hos
pital — formerly Leland and Jane
Stanford's summer residence — the
project will contain 388 independent
condominiums, 66 assisted living
units and 47 nursing rooms.
• Stanford Shopping Center will
be enlarged by 8().(XK) feet for new
stores and a new parking structure.
• Palo Alto will lease El Camino
Park from Stanford for $1 a year for
the next3s years.
• Development on the west corner
of Stanford land from the Stanford
Golf Course to the Santa Cruz-Sand
Hill intersection will be restricted
until 2021.
"Overwhelmingly, it solves the
Sand Hill road traffic bottleneck."
said Larry Horton, Stanford's direc
tor of government and community
relations. "And the corollary — it
provides assured and improved ac

cess to Stanford Medical Center."
Stanford has revised the total cost
of the road expansions from $20 mil
lion to $26 million, said Horton. Al
most half of that will be spent on the
four-lane Sand Hill expansion and
the two-lane extension to El Camino.
It will cost about $6.5 million to widen
the section of the road in Menlo Park
should the Menlo Park City Council
approve.
Menlo Park will be another hurdle
Receiving permission to expand
on the Menlo Park-operated section
of Sand Hill is not guaranteed, how
ever. Last year, Menlo Park voters
elected two members to its city coun
cil solely to oppose Sand Hill expan
sion.
Council members have said re
peatedly that they will not support
Sand Hill expansion, though Horton
believes that if Measure () passes,
they will.
"Menlo Park has a choice," Hor
ton said. "Do they want to have the
road repaired so it will benefit Menlo
Park? Or do they want to perpetuate
a congested roadway situation in
their jurisdiction which will only get
worse?"
The prospect of expanding Sand
Hill without the small section in the
Menlo Park jurisdiction all hut wors
ens the traffic problem, according to
Horton.
Cars entering Stanford from 1-280
would be forced to merge from tour
lanes to two lanes after crossing Santa
Cruz, then back to four lanes after
crossing San Francisquito Creek.
Similarly, cars leaving Stanford
would merge to two lanes for the
short stretch before heading toward
1-280.
Residents of the section between
the creek and Santa Cruz — whose
driveways exit onto Sand Hill — ef
fectively live in a political no-man's
land.
Though the region is operated by
Menlo Park, it is technically an unin
corporated area controlled by San
Mateo County. Residents do not vote
in either Menlo Park or Palo Alto.
Stanford has proposed to extend
this section of Sand Hill onto a por
tion of the current Stanford Golf
Course and create a separate parallel
road for residents between Santa
Cruz and the creek whose driveways
open onto Sand Hill.
"I think Menlo Park residents are
opposed to inviting people attracted
by Stanford development to use
Menlo Park streets as access," said
Menlo Park Mayor Steve Schmidt.
"I'm elected to protect the interests
of Menlo Park. An expressway or an
increased capacity roadway would
guarantee to attract 25.000 trips a day
additional to that area."
Horton said the University is pre
pared for another election if negotia
tions with the Menlo Park council
tail.
"If they don't approve it, they're
going to have one hell of a mess,"
Horton said.
Stanford must also combat law
suits disputing the environmental im
pact report and the language of Mea
sure O. The suits, brought by the city
of Menlo Park and a group of Menlo
Park residents, could delay construc
tion on Sand Hill or possibly derail
the project entirely.
Residents'counternieasure

Though Measure M will be ap
pearing first on voters' ballots, it is a
direct citizens' response to Stanford's
Measure O.
Measure M. supported by the
Mid-Peninsula Action for Tomor
row. limits development along Sand
Hill by changing Palo Alto's set of
rules for transportation and urban
design policy.
Proponents of Measure M believe
that the traffic problem on Sand 1 lill
can be solved by encouraging more
people to use public transportation
alternatives when commuting to the
Stanford campus or using the shop
ping center.
To facilitate this. Measure M sup
porters have proposed, though it is
not required by the measure, a third
lane on Sand Hill for use solely by
public transportation and emergency
vehicles.
The direction of the lane would
likely change from eastbound in the
morning to westbound in the after
noon if it is implemented, said Peter
Drekmeier, campaign manager for
Measure M.
"People would be cruising down
|Sand Hill] past their friends who in
sist on driving, and waving at them,"
Drekmeier said. "They get to work a
lot more easily and conveniently."
Besides restricting Sand Hill ex
pansion, Measure M requires that
Sand Hill be expanded to El Camino,
though it does not designate who will
fund the project. It also adds a series
of other land use restrictions:
• Road projects in the Sand Hill
region must not increase traffic on
Alma Street and residential streets.
• Palo Alto must consult with
neighboring cities on methods to re
duce traffic on Sand Hill.
• Palo Alto must attempt to find a
different area for the proposed facul
ty/staff housing and keep the field
Stanford proposes to build on unde
veloped. Because the field is Stanford
land, however, the University cannot
be forced not to build on this land.
• Stanford cannot expand the
shopping center more than the al
ready-approved 49,(XH) feet unless a
year of data analysis has shown that
the Sand 1 lill-El Canuno extension
has not increased traffic.
• The bulk of Measure M propos
als cannot be changed without voter
approval until 2016.
The most controversial element of
the measure is the proposed third
lane, which Drekmeier claims will
improve traffic How. 1 lowever, public
transportation and emergency trans
portation providers disagree. In a
show of support for the University,
the bus and lire department unions
and Stanford Hospital's primary am
bulance contractor endorsed Mea
sure O at a University-sponsored
press conference.
A leader of the bus union claimed
that traffic would worsen with the
third lane if buses were forced to pull
to the side of the road from the third
lane to make stops and then move
back into the third lane during trips
down Sand Hill.
Measure M proponents continue
to assert that the third lane speeds up
access to Stanford Medical Center's
emergency room, located near the in
tersection of Campus Drive and
Ouarry Road.
"If a loved one's life depended on
it, which Sand Hill would you

choose?" headlined a recent Mea
sure M advertisement in the Palo
Alto Weekly.
Horton, however, is not con
vinced. "If someone's life depended
on it, you'd go down Quarry," he said.
Long-standing conflict
The passage of Measure O could
effectively finalize 40 years of heated
controversy over how best to expand
Sand Hill Road.
Even before the l%os, the state of
California planned to incorporate
Sand Hill — then called Willow Road
— into a freeway linking the Dumb
arton Bridge with 1-280.
The proposal encountered resis
tance among both Menlo Park and
Palo Alto residents and was dropped.
Stanford University remained neu
tral on the issue, said Andy Doty,
Stanford's director of government
and community relations from 1%3
to 1993.
In 1968, the city councils of both
Menlo Park and Palo Alto approved
a measure to extend Willow Road to
El Camino and widen the road to
four lanes from Santa Cruz to El
Camino.
This proposal, supported by Stan
ford. succumbed to a series of legal
challenges charging conflict of inter

est among a number of city council
members, Doty said. The idea was
again dropped after it could not gar
ner enough city council support.
Almost immediately, some resi
dents brought up the idea of an ex
pressway, this time with stoplights.
Again, the measure failed to receive
Menlo Park support, losing in a refer
endum in 1971. Stanford again re
mained neutral.
"Stanford was not involved in the
issue," Doty said. "The position was if
this was something the people of
Menlo Park want or don't want,
that's their concern."
In the mid-1970s the idea of an ex
tension was again considered.
Though it garnered the support of
Palo Alto, the Stanford-supported
plan could not win over the Menlo
Park City Council, and legal chal
lenges by the city and by residents
over the environmental impact re
port again derailed the plan.
"Stanford at that time was tired of
the whole procedure, did not go
through with the new (environmental
impact report] and the project died
once again," Doty said.
Now, the 1997 initiative marks the
first time a Sand 1 lill extension plan is
being considered by Palo Alto voters.
And still, the approval of Measure ()

will not entirely end the debate.
Should voters pass Measure M in
stead, the Palo Altt) ( ity ( Council and
the University, whose relationship
over the years eould not be described
as overly amieable, would be forced
into negotiations over who w ill pay to
extend Sand I lill to F.l ('amino.
1 loi ton has already said Stanford
will not pursue any of the plans in
Measure () should Measure M pass.
Measure M proponents are not con
vinced.
Should both measures fail all
plans go back to the draw ing board.
Drekmeier would prefer not to have
to fight Stanford again, but if history
is any indicator, residents will be
quick to oppose Sand 1 lill expansion.
"If both were to lose, Stanford
would just come back in a few years
with another massive project." Drek
meier said. "Measure M creates para
meters."
Morton said this election is Sand
1 lill expansion's last test, and the I Uni
versity will not put together another
comprehensive plan should Measure
() fail. However. Stanford may con
sider individual projects, he said.
"1 don't think the city council will
feel comfortable approving projects
that were rejected by voters," I lorton
said.
