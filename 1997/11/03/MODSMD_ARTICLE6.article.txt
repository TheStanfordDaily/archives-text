## Conference draws women from 13 countries 
### Patricia Soung 
An international symposium titled "Towards a Com
passionate Society in the 21st ("entury," was held in Kres
ge Auditorium on Sunday.
Distinguished educators, public figures and leading
activists in women's rights from 13 countries gathered in
discussion and debate of how women in particular may
play a role in building a better society.
Organized by the Sisterhood Is Global Institute of
Washington, l).(\, the Shaler Adams Foundation of San
Francisco and the (ilobal Fund for Women of Palo Alto,
the free public symposium featured panel discussions on
topics including justice and human rights, women, reli
gion and the politics of spirituality, leadership with com
passion, and the relationships between families, values
and communities.
Debra Sat/, associate professor of philosophy and di
rector of the Program in Ethics in Society at Stanford, de
scribed conditions such as increasing discrepancies be

twecn the rich and poor, environmental degradation and
global diseases, as evidence of the need to take greater ac
tion in solving widespread problems.
(lender gaps. Sat/ stressed, remain a pervasive con
cern in all societies. Among the illiterate in the world,
women outnumber men two to one. Another instance of
gender inequality is apparent by the mere fi percent of
cabinet positions in the world held by women. In addition
to being undervalued, underpaid and at times legally un
recognized, Sat/ declared that "violence continues to
stalk the lives of women."
I )iu ing the morning session, Mahnaz Afkhami, presi
dent of the Sisterhood Is Cilobal Institute and former
minister of state for women's affairs in Iran, set the tone
by further illuminating the problems threatening world
security.
Afkhami, an exile herself, particularly feels connected
to the displaced persons and refugees around the world.
To confront totalitarian regimes, raging wars and other
problems, she urges people to as
sume a "fuzzy head grounded in
facts." That is. approach the matter
philosophically and theoretically but
realistically as well.
In a panel called "Justice and
1 luman Rights in a Humane World,"
both Alicia Partnoy, former vice
chair of the board of directors of
Amnesty International, and Char
lotte Brunch, coordinator of the
women's human rightscaucus for the
United Nations' fourth World Con
ference on Women in Beijing, felt
disturbed by the term "compassion"
and attempted to dissect its meaning.
Partnoy focused her discussion on
solidarity. She explained that the
word "compassion" offers a "some
what disempowering feeling for vic
tims in general." Rather than sympa

thy and pity, victims desire assistance
in achieving justice, an effort requir
ing collective action and responsibil
ity. hence solidarity.
Brunch further analyzed the sym
posium's theme in a warning not to
perceive "compassion" as the self
sacrifice women often take upon
themselves as caretakers for others.
Concentrating on the issue of human
rights, Brunch called on "men and
women to reclaim the definition of
human rights," which inherently sug
gests that a responsibility exists to
fulfill those rights.
One severely neglected area of
human rights is domestic violence,
Brunch explained. Children reared
in such environments learn to accept
violence, often as a means of acquir
ing power or resolving conflicts.
Brunch called for "domestic disar
mament" so that families could be
"locales of peace rather than locales
of domination."

Afkhami concluded the panel dis
cussion by addressing the relation
ship between culture and human
rights, especially pertinent in light of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit to the United States. Culture, as
a medium through which we com
municate, encompasses varying
ideas, traditions and customs, though
the submission of women seems to
be a common similarity running
throughout, she said.
Afkhami offered a strategy that
has been implemented in 10 Muslim
societies. The program does not pro
claim the "right answer," but allows
groups to evaluate and come to
terms with what they want in order to
build a more compassionate society.
By integrating and drawing upon cul
tural customs and stories, the ap
proach addresses culture, confronts
propaganda and taboos and mobi
lizes women for action.
