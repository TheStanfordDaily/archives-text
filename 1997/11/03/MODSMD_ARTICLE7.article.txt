## Cowell administrators find no problems so far with new student insurance setup

This tail marks the first year of
Cardinal Care, the new managed
health care insurance program, and
the program has so far gone without
a hitch, according to officials at
('owe 11 Student I lealth Center.
"We are very pleased with Blue
Cross," said Jane Meier, associate
director of Cowell. "Students ap
preciate the sense of choice."
( ardinal ( are, which is co-spon
sored by Cowell and Blue Cross of
California, allows students to seek
treatment from both Blue Cross
network providers and non-net
work providers as well as receiving
primary care from ('owell.
Under Cardinal Care students
can be reimbursed for NO percent of
costs incurred from a network
provider and anywhere from 6<) to
KO percent of costs they incur from
non-network providers. Meier says
it is too early to tell whether stu
dents are using these additional op
tions.
"We expect that most of the care
will occur at Cowell and Stanford
Medical Center," Meier said "We
expect that outside practitioners
will be used when students are away
from campus during breaks and

vacations.
I he initial decision to switch
health care plans occurred more
than two years ago, prompted by
student concerns that the old plan
did not minimi/c out of pocket ex
penses for students and did not pro
tect them Irom inflationary premi
ums. Under the new plan students
pay the same $IK2 per quarter pre
mium that they paid under the old
plan but receive much more com
prehensive care.

Students appreciate
the sense of choice.'

At least 50percent of the student
population was enrolled in the old
plan and all returning students pre
viously enrolled in the plan were au
tomatically switched to Cardinal
Care this fall. Hie number of stu
dents enrolled is up 4 percentage
points since last year and the old
program, Meier reports.
"I'm very pleased and excited
about the plan; it's a comprehensive
health insurance package for a very
reasonable price," Meier said.
