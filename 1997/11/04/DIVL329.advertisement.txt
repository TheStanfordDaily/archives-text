FERMAT'S ENIGMA: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem
In June 1993, Andrew Wiles stunned the international mathematics community when he announced that
he had a proof for Fermat's Last Theorem. A conundrum that had for centuries baffled the greatest
minds, Fermat's Last Theorem was considered the Holy Grail of mathematics. Wiles had worked for
seven years in solitude and secrecy, even from his colleagues. When a shocking flaw in his proof was
discovered, Wiles isolated himself for another year, at the end of which in a stroke of genius he corrected
his proof, thus culminating a quest that spanned three-and-a-half centuries. Simon Singh has written a
compelling account of the history of Fermat's Last Theorem. In it Singh describes in colorful and pas
sionate detail the quests of many to prove amateur French mathematician Pierre de Fermat's tantalizing
challenge.
