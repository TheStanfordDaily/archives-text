## 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
Andrew Smith, a second
year doctoral student in English,
died on Saturday. He was
rushed to the Stanford Hospi
tal's emergency room around
noon Saturday and died later
that day.
The precise cause of death is
unclear, but there is some indi
cation that he may have died of
an aneurysm. He was 25 years
old.
Smith's sudden death comes
as a complete shock to those
who knew him. He was not
known to have had any preexist
ing medical conditions. His
death is particularly upsetting
for the English Department,
coming as it does on the heels of
the death of Asst. Prof. Lora
Romero, who died Oct. 10.
Smith's adviser. Prof. Terry
Castle, department chair, de
scribed him as a "very shy, very
smart and very sensitive per
son. ... Andrew was a lovely
person and a brilliant student."
said Castle. "He had a wry sense
of humor and was a delightful
man to be around."
Smith was originally from
Scarsdale, N.Y. He received his
undergraduate degree from St.
John's College in New York and
came to Stanford in 19%. While
his primary concentration was in
18th-century British literature.
Castle said he"was good in all
fields."
As a student. Smith was ac
tively involved in expanding the
English Department library. He
was also an active member of

the department's Book Review
Club.
Smith was also a jazz fan,
maintaining a special interest in
the avant-garde variety. He
loved books and was especially
interested in rare and antique
books.
Many who knew him were
shocked at the swiftness of
Smith's death. "There is a heavy
feeling of loss in the depart-

mcnt," said Castle.
Smith's parents were notified
immediately and flew in Sunday
afternoon. They were eager to
see Smith's friends in the de
partment and spent several
hours at the department on
Monday.
The English Department
plans to have an informal
memorial gathering for Smith in
the next week or two. Castle is
also trying to endow a gilt to the
department in Smith's name.
