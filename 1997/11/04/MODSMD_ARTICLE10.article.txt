Negotiations off to shaky start
WASHINGTON (AF) — A new round of nego
tiations between Israel and the Palestinians got off to
a slow start yesterday as U.S. mediators complained
that the delegation sent by Yasser Arafat lacked
expertise in some areas.
The Palestinian leader sent three of his most
senior deputies to Washington, but not the backup
specialists that State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said were needed to deal with setting up a
Palestinian airport and seaport, an industrial zone
and a corridor for traveling between the West Bank
and Gaza.
Arafat apparently intended to underscore that he
wanted the talks mediated by Secretary of State

Madeleine Albright £nd U.S. envoy Dennis Ross to
concentrate on his demand for a substantial Israeli
pullback on the West Bank.
But Rubin said "we are concerned" that Pales
tinian specialists were not included in the delegation.
He said that "without them we won't be able to
make any progress" on the four issues.
The response from Arafat's headquarters was
chilly.
Marwan kanafani, an adviser to the Palestinian
leader, said the negotiators sent to Washington "are
more than experts" on all issues on Albright's agen
da. "It there is a positive development on these basic
issues, 1 think Arafat is prepared to dispatch a pri
vate plane now with all the experts needed."
Kanafani said.
