University isn't living up
to ils promise to educate
students on the grape issue

IN APRIL, IWS, the University presi
dent and provost promised increased
support lor educating students about the
grape issue.
I Jltimately, this is what the IW4 student
piotcst boiled down to — a pledge from the
highei i.inks of the administration that stu
dents would be better educated on the pros
and eons of voting for a grape boycott in
their dormitory's servery.
Ihe issue was settled in IWS on what
could be considered advantageous terms for
the University. Yet. the administration has
fallen shoii of its promise nut only to those
students who fought to change the system,
but also to the (irapes Policy Committee
that spent almost a year examining the issue.
Most significantly, lack of action on the
part ol the Dean til Students Office and the
()l t ice ol Residential I ducat ion has slighted
students in on-campus residences of the
promised education and has minimized the
significance ol the hunger strike.
Many undergraduates don't remember
the protest: die Class of IWN came to Stan
ford the fall after il had occurred. Evidently
some graduate students, faculty and staff,
who were here then have also forgotten
what happened.
In May. IW4. in one of the most grip
ping student led protests at Stanford of
the past decade, four students, concerned
with how the University was addressing
Chicano / latino issues, participated in a
three day hunger strike.
Although only four students were princi
pal! v involved, support for the strikers was
overwhelming. Several students joined the
hunger stnke for 24-hour periods in solidar
ity. and hundreds of students rallied in sup
port. The pictures tell the story.
Among many demands, strike partici
pants wanted a University-wide California
tabic grapes boycott in response to grape
fanners' treatment of their workers, who are
most I \ ol Chicano/Latino background. In
response to the strike, a committee of stu
dents and faculty members was formed to
examine the issue and its impact on Stan
ford.
After nearly a year of meetings and
town hall type discussions, the drape Policy
Committee issued ils recommendations in a
report to University President Gerhard
Casper in February. IWS.
" I he issue of grapes is of deep impor
tance to a significant segment of the I Jniver
sity's students." the report said.
In April IWS, recommendations were
made that Stanford "should require where
possible, and encourage where not possible,
all I Iniversity units to make regular, formal
decisions whether or not to boycott
grapes." Casper and Provost Cotidolcc/a

Rice said that Stanford would not support a
University-wide boycott of grapes. Instead
residences would be responsible for making
the choice of whether or not to serve grapes
and administrative units of the University
would avoid taking a political stance on the
issue.
A little known fact is that the Universi
ty's concession in the president and
provost's statement — that residences
would vote on whether grapes would be
served in their serveries — had been in place
for a while. Since Donald Kennedy's presi
dency, students had been voting on the
grape issue.
Most people agreed, however, that (lie
existing system of dorm-wide votes on the
grape boycott had never been implemented
clearly or consistently.
Casper and Rice's actions in 1995
charged the Dean of Students Office and
the Office of Residential Education to play
an active role in ensuring that balanced
information would be made available so
that students could make informed deci
sions.
Essentially the strike and the commit
tee's deliberations resulted in the Universi
ty's expressed acknowledgment of the inad
equacies of the old policy and a desire to
remedy them via new mechanisms.
I heir statement said that resident fellows
as well as resident assistants would be
"asked to ensure that there will be a fair
opportunity to raise the grapes issue in the
course of house meetings."
A follow-up article this fall in The Daily
demonstrated the ineffective nature of the
educational process. Several RAs didn't
even know a vote was necessary by the end
of fall quarter. Ask most people in your
dorm today about the grape policy and
chances are they don't know much about it.
In response to The Daily article, the dean
of students and the director of residential
education and graduate residences printed
an open letter (a rather visually unappealing
and uninviting one) to students requesting
their participation in the educational pro
cess.
Thank you for the encouragement, but if
we're not incorrect, you promised a little
more not so long ago. Giving out a stack of
papers to RAs and televising a debate on
( liannel 51 is clearly not enough.
While we recognize that Res Ed has
many other issues to deal with, a weakly
implemented promise on grape education
and voting should not be disguised with such
an excuse.
Students must be actively involved in this
process as well, and we encourage students
to watch the grape debate today at 2 p.m. on
Channel 51.
I or the Dean of Students Office and the
(HI ice of Residential Education, we encour
age you to make Casper and Rice's promis
es a priority. If not for the sake the students
who supported the IW4 strike and the cur
rent student body, at least do it to salvage
some of the I 'nivcrsitv's credibility.
