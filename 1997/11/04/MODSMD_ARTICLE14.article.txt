## Musings on the freedom of the Oasis 
### 
IN THE PAST, my
girlfriend (a non-
Stanfordite) would
frequently refer to Stan
ford as the "Oasis." As a
freshman and sometimes
as a sophomore, I would
take offense and could
feel my newly transfused

-j -
Stanford blood beginning to simmer. Hut
now. it's a little funny to think that 1 find
myself using the term more frequently than
she ever did.
The term is very indicative of the kind of
lifestyle that most of us live here. In one
respect, one sees Stanford's Oasis-ness in
the millions of dollars spent on palm trees
and its accept-all mentality. Hut beyond
that, I'm more concerned with the freedoms
that we have here, particularly as under
graduates.
For instance, the University does a very
good job of sewing a security blanket and
giving its undergrads the chance to have a
little extra freedom. We don't even declare
majors until our sophomore year to give us
the chance to find our academic niche. And
the University only begins to become a bit
disgruntled about a lack of direction if we
haven't declared a major by the beginning
of junior year.
Yes, we have required courses, and we
must think about finding a major and, even
tually, a career. However, as Oasis under
grads, we don't know what real responsibil
ities are. For example, to offer a contrast,
people who work at sustenance level don't
choose to work. They must! Parents don't
choose to change a baby's diaper. They
must! (Some of them are even still changing
those diapers when their kids enter Stan
ford.)
Mv point is that we have a lot of freedom
in choosing how to spend our time. We can
talk with a professor. We can tutor under

privileged kids. We can pick up a book at
the library and read it because we're inter
ested. There's a lot we can learn about our
selves and our world while we're here. And
we don't experience such learning by abus
ing our freedoms in the form of being in a
drunken stupor all weekend or memorizing
every table in our chemistry text.
Of course, there's nothing inherently
wrong with spending a lot of time on classes
or being an ASSII senator. Hut do we do it
because we "wanna" or because we think
we "gotta"? Are we really learning any
thing other than how to write the most
deceiving resume?
In thinking about some common
responses to our freedom, I stumbled upon
three general examples: the victim, the apa
thetic student and the passionate nerd.
(Warning: These are mere examples.)
The stressful victim is one who com
plains about ('hem 31, a paper or a problem
set. We're not some kind of victims without
the capacity to decide about our academic
lives at Stanford. We do make our own
decisions, even il it is deciding to let Dad
decide.
The apathetic student is someone who
divides school and the rest of life. They will
just "get it over with" without much bicker
ing. For them, school is basically a nuisance
that they'd like to take care of in order to
move on to more important things. (That's
a pretty expensive nuisance.)
The passionate nerds actually enjoy class
work (imagine that), but they basically put
the blinders on and have trouble seeing
beyond their own abstract academic world.
For instance, passion for computer pro
gramming can be a very admirable thing,
unless passion for nearly everything else is
lost.
Obviously, there are shades of each of
these types and most of us are characterized
by each description to some degree. But my

point is to look at how we respond to the
ehoices we are given.
When was the last time you spoke with a
professor because you were interested in
what they had to say? When was the last
time you read something and extensively
thought about it because you were interest
ed but. at first, didn't understand it?
We often take for granted our short
lived freedom and. as a consequence, do lit
tie to grow beyond our preset concerns
about what we "need" to do. And il it's not
something that we need to do, it's often
something about which we're just obsessed
(like making damn sure that we nail that
computer program).
Don't get me wrong. This not some dis
ease particular to Stanford nor does it infest
all Stanford undergrads. In fact, some Stan
ford people are ama/ing in their modest,
passionate and balanced pursuit of individ
ual growth.
Yet. many of us rationalize why we want
to be a doctor, politician, attorney, engineer
or consultant instead of really understand
ing what is personally important. By becom
ing lost in this way. we spend most of our
academic time paving a way for our precon
ceived post-graduation "ideals." But what's
so ideal about crafting a career of boosting
one's ego. seeking petty comfort or fever
ishly pursuing an abstract obsession?
Stanford may be a bit of an oasis. But.
you know, we can use or abuse that. We
make our decisions here, and one of them
can be the decision to figure out who the
hell we are. We have a brief time in our lives
to make this decision, because once the
security blanket is ripped away, so will be
some of our freedom.
