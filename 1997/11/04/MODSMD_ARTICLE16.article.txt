Preserve school spirit
In recent weeks, Stanford's administra
tion has undercut long-standing institutions
of school spirit on campus.
Specifically, the punishments handed
down to the Hand, the proposal to require
University-hired ushers at Flicks and the
lack of support for a revamped Big Game
rally all demonstrate that our administra
tors are oblivious to. if not actively opposed
to, any concept of school spirit and tradi
tion.
In its actions, the administration is not
only alienating the student body, but it is
also undermining its own attempts to
strengthen the long term financial security
and reputation of the University.
Since the day he arrived at Stanford,
University President Gerhard Casper has
concentrated heavily on improving alumni

donation rates (the percentage of alumni
that give money to Stanford).
Many students may be surprised to
know that Stanford's alumni donation rates
are strikingly lower than those of our peer
institutions. This not only hurts the finan
cial position of the University, but is also
held strongly against us by U.S. News &
World Report in its annual college rankings
â€” an annoyance to anyone who cares
about such things.
While his efforts are admirable, I believe
that Casper's strategy to this end has been
largely misguided. In countless public
speeches. Casper has stated that tuition fees
cover only a small portion of the actual cost
of each student's education, the remainder
of the expenses being met through alumni
donations and endowments.
In light of these facts, Casper reasons
that students have a "moral obligation" to
give back to Stanford after graduation. I do

not take issue with these facts about tuition,
nor with Casper's concept of a moral obli
gation to give back.
However. I feel his narrow focus on
these issues shows a real lack of under
standing of the true motivations of alumni
who donate money to their college.
As a member of the Class of 199 K. I will
be asked in a few short months to donate
$19.9(S as part of The Stanford Fund's
Senior Gift drive. And when that day
arrives. 1 will gladly whip out my check
book and make my gift. But my generosity
will not spring from any sense of moral
obligation. I, like most Stanford alumni,
will donate out of a sense of loyalty and
school spirit derived from four years of fun
memories. Big Game festivities, running
with the Band, attending Gaieties, cheering
in The Sixth-Man Club, paper wars at
Flicks; these will be the memories that stay
with me long after graduation. I will donate
