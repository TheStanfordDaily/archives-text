Preserve school spirit
In recent weeks, Stanford's administra
tion has undercut long-standing institutions
of school spirit on campus.
Specifically, the punishments handed
down to the Hand, the proposal to require
University-hired ushers at Flicks and the
lack of support for a revamped Big Game
rally all demonstrate that our administra
tors are oblivious to. if not actively opposed
to, any concept of school spirit and tradi
tion.
In its actions, the administration is not
only alienating the student body, but it is
also undermining its own attempts to
strengthen the long term financial security
and reputation of the University.
Since the day he arrived at Stanford,
University President Gerhard Casper has
concentrated heavily on improving alumni

donation rates (the percentage of alumni
that give money to Stanford).
Many students may be surprised to
know that Stanford's alumni donation rates
are strikingly lower than those of our peer
institutions. This not only hurts the finan
cial position of the University, but is also
held strongly against us by U.S. News &
World Report in its annual college rankings
— an annoyance to anyone who cares
about such things.
While his efforts are admirable, I believe
that Casper's strategy to this end has been
largely misguided. In countless public
speeches. Casper has stated that tuition fees
cover only a small portion of the actual cost
of each student's education, the remainder
of the expenses being met through alumni
donations and endowments.
In light of these facts, Casper reasons
that students have a "moral obligation" to
give back to Stanford after graduation. I do

not take issue with these facts about tuition,
nor with Casper's concept of a moral obli
gation to give back.
However. I feel his narrow focus on
these issues shows a real lack of under
standing of the true motivations of alumni
who donate money to their college.
As a member of the Class of 199 K. I will
be asked in a few short months to donate
$19.9(S as part of The Stanford Fund's
Senior Gift drive. And when that day
arrives. 1 will gladly whip out my check
book and make my gift. But my generosity
will not spring from any sense of moral
obligation. I, like most Stanford alumni,
will donate out of a sense of loyalty and
school spirit derived from four years of fun
memories. Big Game festivities, running
with the Band, attending Gaieties, cheering
in The Sixth-Man Club, paper wars at
Flicks; these will be the memories that stay
with me long after graduation. I will donate
because I hope thai in some way, my money
will enable future generations of students it)
enjoy these same memories.
But as time passes, administrators in the
Office of Student Activities continue to sys
tematically so;ik more and more of the fun
out of student life at Stanford, making these
memories less and less likely for future stu
dents. The examples are endless: the termi
nation of ;i real Big (iame bonfire, the strip
ping of houses from fraternities, the tighter
restrictions on student group fundraising.
the attempts to end the Wacky Walk.
Now the list expands: punishing the
Band retroactively for a script that had been
approved by the Athletics Department,
mandating university labor for Flicks, which
has run successfully under student manage
ment for 60 years, and promising for the
past year to work towards a new Big (iame
rally tradition, only to arrive back at the
same uninspiring four-foot Arrillaga bonfire
that has met with minimal success in previ

ous years.
In their war against spirit and tradition,
OSA administrators are working directly
against Casper's goals for increased alumni
satisfaction. II this hostility towards the con
cept of fun continues, the student body will
grow increasingly disgruntled over the next
few years.
More importantly, school spirit and loy
alty will continue to dwindle and. 20 years
down the road, alumni donation rates will
be as low as ever. Students will not feel ;i
moral obligation to Stanford once they
graduate unless the administration begins to
live up to its obligation to students while
they are here.

I just want to back up what I laeberle

wrote in his letter about the Bookstore's
new "smart lamps." For the hist year, we've
been reading statements in I lie Daily from
the Bookstore or Res lid that these 70 watt
lamps are designed to replace the popular
300 watt halogen torehieres and that they
are 20 percent brighter than halogen
lamps.
Many people probably assumed this
meant that they are 20 percent brighter
than the 300-watl torehieres that they are
supposed to replace, but ;is I laeberle
pointed out. they don't even come close.
I suspect that the original statements
actually meant that the new 70-watt lamps
are 20 percent brighter than a 70-watt halo
gen lamp.
From my own side-by-side comparison
of my old 300-watt halogen torchiere with
my new "smart lamp," with both lamps
turned to lull brightness. I estimate that it
would take about three ol the new lamps to
light up as much ol my bedroom as a single

300-watt halogen.
I'hiit means thai instead of replacing a
$2(1 halogen torchiere with a $100 smait
lamp (possiblv economical because ol
decreased energy use), you'd have to
replace the $20 lamp (300 watts) \\ ith $300
worth ol smart lamps (total ol 200 watts) to
light up the same room!
I hiit means spending 15 times as much
money to cut your energy costs In M) pei
cent, while at the same time taking up
about as much extra space as a good sized
roommate.
I'rol (ill Masters said that his (>5 watt
smart lamp out performed ;i borrowed
300-watt halogen, lbs numbers were con
vineing; however, having seen Inst hand
that the 300 wait halogen is a great deal
brighter, I suspect thiit Ins borrowed lamp
may not have been in the best condition.
I his idea is backed up by his statement
thiit the 3(H) watt halogen he used pro
duced only background lighting; mine

lights up hall .1 room quite nicely
()f course, the other possibility is that
mv new smart lamp was defective and si
was llachcrle's. but this would not hi
indicative ol a quality product u> be rccom

I'm sure that Res Id or whoever made
the decision to ban halogen lamps meant
well Ihe new lamps are indeed cooler am
wanting to prevent voiu dorm from burn
ing down is an admirable goal
However, at the current puces. I don't
think these smait lamps are going to be tin.

that has met with minimal success in previ

ous years.
In their war against spirit and tradition,
OSA administrators are working directly
against Casper's goals for increased alumni
satisfaction. II this hostility towards the con
cept of fun continues, the student body will
grow increasingly disgruntled over the next
few years.
More importantly, school spirit and loy
alty will continue to dwindle and. 20 years
down the road, alumni donation rates will
be as low as ever. Students will not feel ;i
moral obligation to Stanford once they
graduate unless the administration begins to
live up to its obligation to students while
they are here.

Shedding new light
I just want to back up what I laeberle

wrote in his letter about the Bookstore's
new "smart lamps." For the hist year, we've
been reading statements in I lie Daily from
the Bookstore or Res lid that these 70 watt
lamps are designed to replace the popular
300 watt halogen torehieres and that they
are 20 percent brighter than halogen
lamps.
Many people probably assumed this
meant that they are 20 percent brighter
than the 300-watl torehieres that they are
supposed to replace, but ;is I laeberle
pointed out. they don't even come close.
I suspect that the original statements
actually meant that the new 70-watt lamps
are 20 percent brighter than a 70-watt halo
gen lamp.
From my own side-by-side comparison
of my old 300-watt halogen torchiere with
my new "smart lamp," with both lamps
turned to lull brightness. I estimate that it
would take about three ol the new lamps to
light up as much ol my bedroom as a single

300-watt halogen.
I'hiit means thai instead of replacing a
$2(1 halogen torchiere with a $100 smait
lamp (possiblv economical because ol
decreased energy use), you'd have to
replace the $20 lamp (300 watts) \\ ith $300
worth ol smart lamps (total ol 200 watts) to
light up the same room!
I hiit means spending 15 times as much
money to cut your energy costs In M) pei
cent, while at the same time taking up
about as much extra space as a good sized
roommate.
I'rol (ill Masters said that his (>5 watt
smart lamp out performed ;i borrowed
300-watt halogen, lbs numbers were con
vineing; however, having seen Inst hand
that the 300 wait halogen is a great deal
brighter, I suspect thiit Ins borrowed lamp
may not have been in the best condition.
I his idea is backed up by his statement
thiit the 3(H) watt halogen he used pro
duced only background lighting; mine

lights up hall .1 room quite nicely
()f course, the other possibility is that
mv new smart lamp was defective and si
was llachcrle's. but this would not hi
indicative ol a quality product u> be rccom
mended.
I'm sure that Res Id or whoever made
the decision to ban halogen lamps meant
well Ihe new lamps are indeed cooler am
wanting to prevent voiu dorm from burn
ing down is an admirable goal
However, at the current puces. I don't
think these smait lamps are going to be tin.
ansvvei
My suggestion would he to lake whocv
ei is m charge ol making sure that there arc
no halogen lamps in doi 111 rooms, and liavi
them instead make sure that halogen lamp>
are not placed too close to easily com
bustible items
