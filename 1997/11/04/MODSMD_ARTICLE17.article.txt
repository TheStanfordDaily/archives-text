## Halloween, marines and life without inhibitions

MOSCOW DOES STRANGE
things to people. You find yourself
doing things you wouldn't normal
ly be caught dead trying.
While most of you were busy dancing
Halloween night away on Leland and Jane's
mausoleum. I too was having fun atop roofs.
Hut. again, I am getting ahead of myself.
On Halloween night, my friends, in their
quest for a good Halloween party, came
across some marines who invited us to their
party at th_ American Embassy on Saturday
night. With a little prodding, my friends con
vinced me to put aside my history paper and
join them for a party a la the U.S. Marine
Corps.
It was a warm night for Moscow. I could
still see my breath, but come on. This is
Moscow we're talking about, not Stanford.
The previous week's snow had already melt
ed. so I was able to go out wearing a short
sleeved shirt, plus my Thinsulate jacket.
We arrived at the back door of the
embassy without costumes. I told the guard
that we were dressed up like Americans. I le

was slightly amused.
We distributed our precious American
dollars accordingly so all of us could aftord
the $5 cover fee. We also had to Hash our
passports to the guards; this was an exclu
sively American party.
When we got inside, it was almost like
being at home again. Costumed rednecks
were lined up against the bar hogging the
chips and salsa. Marines drank Hud I ights
while they played foosball and pool. And the
marvelous thing was that they all spoke
unaccented English.
I was in a daring mood. After a bit of
dancing, my friends decided to cut outside
for a quick smoke. Even though I didn't
smoke, 1 decided to join them. It's a social
activity, I told myself.
I wound up smoking my first cigarette
that night.
One's not going to kill me. I tried to ratio
nalize. Why not? Of course. I immediately
wheezed and hacked upon inhaling, but I
guess that's to be expected. 1 was filling my
lungs with black goo, but overall, it actually

wasn't a horrible experience. In fact. I had
another one as my friends gave me a crash
course in smoking etiquette lean against
the wall, hold the cigarette low, curl in the
outer two fingers, slowly bring the cigarette
to your lips, inhale and nonchalantly blow it
all out. high up in the air so as not to offend
non-smokers.
After feeling I had learned everything
there was to know about the culture of
smoking, I decided to explore the com
pound. I had earlier noticed a metal spiral
staircase leading from our smoking landing
to the roof. It wasn't roped oil. so 1 thought,
"Why not?"
I carefully climbed the spiral staircase,
hoping that no ice had formed. As I pulled
myself up onto the roof. I was faced with one
of Stalin's scary towers looming over the
embassy. It was a scene straight out of
"Hurnt Hy the Sun."
No one else had yet ventured atop the
building. The noise of the party below res
onated on the rooftop. Squatting against the
wall looking at Stalin's tower. I had what von

could call a spiritual experience'. It's that
moment when you look down on a city and
realize how incredibly insignificant you real
l\ are in the grand scheme of things.
Then, at the height of my enlightenment.
I realized 1 really had to pee. While 1 had
been downstairs. I had already looked for a
rest room. 1 had noticed that part of the com
pound was off-limits to civilians, and I think
that included the ladies' room.
One small note needs to be made here.
From day one. I have been cursed with a
small bladder. My father even nicknamed
me "Squirrel Bladder." You can imagine
what ridicule from other children that nick
name provoked. My motto is. "When you've
gotta go. you've gotta go."
Now. I wouldn't take this whole incident
too seriously. It's not a huge political issue
about a Stanford student spiting everything
our country and its defenders represent. No.
I couldn't he that deep: I |ust have a squirrel
bladder. I |ust did w hat I had lo do.
Saturday night may have exemplified
how I have been living recent Iv without con

sequences. Anil really. it's almost ti ue Alter
all. except lor the Stanford students. I don't
plan on seeing any of these people ever
again.
I can essentially recreate myself for three
months. I can be a carefree, adventurous stu
dent instead ol an sell conscious, uptight
one. 1 never went through this phase in high
school. I think I was too bus\ worrsing
about getting into Stanford. As long as I
don't get arrested here. I should be fine
Several ol my friends here have recentb
been plagued with the question. "Win
now '" M\ answer to them as is my answei
to all ol the e\cuts of Saturday night. "\\ In
not?" Besides, it's only a couple cigarettes.
You couldn't tell the difference on the tool
anyway beeause ol .ill ol the melted snow.
()h yeah, and the hair dye will wash out soon
enough.
