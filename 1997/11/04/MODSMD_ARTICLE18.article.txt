## Kribel looks ahead to Nelson, Kuchar 
### 
Alter nine straight months of goll, a
summer of near-misses and an admit
tedly subpar fall season, Joel Kribel
w ill finally get some time off next week.
Since February, the junior Ail-American
on the ( ardinal men's golf team has not gone
more than three days without picking up a
club. He's jumped from a grueling NCAA
spring season to a high-profile summer back
to intercollegiate fall play. Along the way, he
lias experienced triumph and heartbreak at
both the I J.S. Amateur and the U.S. Open.

"I've been going pretty much non-stop
since February," the IMeasnnton, Calif., native
said. "I definitely need a break."
Hut first, Kribel added, he needs to take
care of some business.
Stanford C iolf Course will host The Nelson
this weekend, and in Friday's first-round ac
tion. Kribel will be paired with IVlatl Kuchar,
the Georgia lech senior who beat Kribel 2
and I in the championship round of the Ama
teur in August.
Kribel undoubtedly feels he will have
something to prove when he steps to the first
tee Friday. A loser in the semifinals of the 19%
Amateur to I iger Woods, Kribel roared
through the opening rounds of this year's

tournament and appeared destined to contin
ue Stanford's dominance of the Amateur.
But Kribel's trail to the title ran into a per
sonal landslide. In the final 36-hole match
against Kuchar, Krihel shot by far his worst
game of the tournament. I le played the first 27
holes without a birdie, and found himself
down seven holes with 10 to go. Finally, he
found his stroke and mounted a comeback,
but fell short on the 35th hole.
Kuchar is a good player who made a great
run through the tournament, kribel said. But
the man in the Cardinal baseball cap knew the
title was his to lose.
"I was in some positions where 1 could have
done some remarkable things," he said. "If 1
could have played up to my capabilities, 1
would have won."
The final-round loss,coupled with his miss
ing the cut at the U.S. Open by one stroke de
spite an opening-round 70 that tied him for
10th overall, turned Kribel's summer of fun
into a summer of discontent.
This was Kribel's chance to establish him
self as a young golf power, to break free of the
great Tiger shadow that will long cover any
top Stanford golfer.
And there he was. Joel Kribel, playing for
the Amateur title, hitting balls with the ()pen
pros at Congressional Country Club in Wash
ington, D.C.
Twice, victory was within his grasp. Twice,
it slipped away.
"It was a summer that had a lot of ups and
downs," Kribel said. "Overall, I can take a lot
of positives out of it, even from the disap
pointments."

Even as he begins focusing on
those positives, the healing and
learning processes that inevitably
follow such a roller coaster of emo
tion have not run full cycle for Kri
bel. They won't until he gets some
much-needed rest.
Kribel admits he has suffered
from a mild case of burnout this au
tumn. leaving his scores high and his
body weary. "I've been a little tired
all fall," he said.
Next Monday, he will finally earn

his break. After The Nelson, the
men's golf season slacks until Febru
ary, and he will use the time to relax
and take care of other parts of his
life.
That means the economics major
will take more academic units next
quarter, spend more time with his
Sigma Chi brothers and try to figure
out exactly what to do with large
blocks of leisure.
In the past year. Kribel has had
"a little bit of free time here and
there, but nothing where I've had a
couple of months off."
When Kribel does come back,
bet on him being in top form. He has

a date with Augusta — earned by his
making the Amateur finals — to
look forward to. He's dedicated to
his eollegiate golf career and. unlike
his famous predecessor, determined
not to leave Stanford early. He's en
joying the ride too much.
Most of all. look for Joel Kribel to
bounce back next year. At this time
last year, all he could think about
was getting back to the Amateur
and taking another shot. Despite the
disappointments of this summer, he
has not lost that drive.
"Now," he said. "I'm going to be
thinking about it all the way up to
next year's Am."
