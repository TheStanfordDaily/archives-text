# Hockey looks to recover from slow start

It's no secret that Stanford boasts one ol the
nation's premiere athletics departments, a de
partment whose unparalleled success has been at
tributable to the wide range of sports at which the
Cardinal excels.
But when one thinks of Stanford sports, it's
mostly teams like swimming, volleyball and v\ atei
polo that come to mind. Who would imagine that
the Card would have an ice hockey team?
Over the past several years, Stanford's ice
hockey team has in fact taken huge leaps forward,
establishing itself as one of the premiere club pro
grams in the nation.
Last season, the Cardinal won its third consec
utive Pacific S Conference title and was one ol
only teams in the nation to advance to the Na
tional Championship Tournament.

At nationals. Stanford advanced to the third
round before being eliminated by eventual run
ner-up I'enn State. This year, despite ;i complete
ly new look on the ice and behind the bench, the
Cardinal is looking to produce the same kind ol
results.
The most notable change for the team is the re
placement of long-time coach I rnie Ferrari by
Rich 112 alley.
Fahey inherits a Stanford team that h;is en
joyed much recent success, but one that will show
case a different lineup this season.
First of all. the ( ardinal's top goaltender from
a year ago is in Italy this quarter, and female pile
nom Sami Jo Small the team's other goalie hist
season is trying out for the ('anadian National
I'eam. But the Stanford coaching stall is confi
dent that this year's netminder. I airy Myers, will
be a more than adequate replacement in the

crease.
Ihe Cardinal also lost team captain Evan
Asano, a key offensive threat, when he broke his
hand against San Jose State Saturday.
"I wan's on ice leadership will be sorely
missed." I alley said.
Hccausc of changes in team makeup and
chemistry, it's not surprising the ( ardinal has got
ten oil to a sluggish start this season. Alter a split
oil the road against I !SC, Stanford fell to Utah
Slate, last year's No. I seed from the west region
al at nationals, by a 5 score.
Fast I hinsdav anil Friday, the Cardinal re
lumed home and thrashed a weak ('al team twice,
both times by the score of 9-0.
After two games in two nights, Stanford was
tired and had "run out ol legs," according to se
nior Paul Heneman, and proceeded
to lose to San Jose State Saturday.
"'I underestimated the ability of
San Jose State." Fahey said. "We
had a hard time adjusting to playing
a stronger opponent after the C'al
games."
Despite some early difficulties,
the general sentiment around the
locker room is that this year's team
has all the talent of last year's.
"We've got plenty of skill, we just
need to gel and come together as a
team unit," Heneman said.
The Cardinal gets a chance to
prove its progress this weekend
against Weber State, the Western
Conference's top-ranked team,
Thursday at 9:50 p.m. Friday at
10:15 p.m., it gets another shot at
San Jose State.
At this stage in the season, the
team is still experimenting with of
fensive strategies and getting a feel
for its strengths and weaknesses.
"We have proved that we can
score goals â€” now we just need to
focus on stopping other teams from
scoring," Fahey said. "Our offense
is always going to be there, so we
need to take a more conservative
approach, and try a strategy of con
tainment."
If the Cardinal defense, led by
sophomore defenseman Men
D'Fwart.can find a way to minimize
the opposition's scoring, and the of
fense. anchored by junior team cap
tain Tom Terbell. can maintain its
current offensive production, the
squad might just be in store for an
other successful season.
