It's no secret that Stanford boasts one ol the
nation's premiere athletics departments, a de
partment whose unparalleled success has been at
tributable to the wide range of sports at which the
Cardinal excels.
But when one thinks of Stanford sports, it's
mostly teams like swimming, volleyball and v\ atei
polo that come to mind. Who would imagine that
the Card would have an ice hockey team?
Over the past several years, Stanford's ice
hockey team has in fact taken huge leaps forward,

Asano, a key offensive threat, when he broke his
hand against San Jose State Saturday.
"I wan's on ice leadership will be sorely
missed." I alley said.
Hccausc of changes in team makeup and
chemistry, it's not surprising the ( ardinal has got

Slate, last year's No. I seed from the west region
al at nationals, by a 5 score.
Fast I hinsdav anil Friday, the Cardinal re
lumed home and thrashed a weak ('al team twice,
both times by the score of 9-0.
After two games in two nights, Stanford was
tired and had "run out ol legs," according to se
