l he integration of female faculty in the School of Medicine remains a
thorny issue, with many students and facult\ expressing dissatisfaction at cur
rent rates of promotion and reappointment for women.
Richard Popp. the School of Medicine's senior associate dean for acade
mic affairs emphasized that any perceived trend is in no way the result of a
concerted effort on the part of the school.
However, several cases have emerged in which a specific faculty mem
ber's lack of advancement has served to focus student attention on the per
ceived problem.
According to Lucy Ruwitch, a second-year medical student, " These spe
cific women that have left are women that are dedicated to teaching, who ac
tually showed their face at the medical school, lectured, sponsored research,
held students by the hand, took them to their surgeries, look them tosee their
patients and were especially outgoing to the students."
Popp. however, maintained that the school is "trying to increase the num
ber of women and minorities in the faculty. We're trying to not only bring
them on the facultv but also help them have positive careers and retain them
here and have them advance through the ranks."
Popp pointed out that there has been an increase in the number of women
in the higher ranks of the faculty, something he referred to as "very desir
able."
Though Popp could not comment on indiv iduat cases, he did s;iy that I ac
uity members w ho are not promoted or reappointed "are very high-quality
ople and ma iv times they have outstanding characteristics in one area,
but tlu. may not maun in another area.
But second yeai medical student Allison (irow said, "Because |these
women| are the kind ol people that 1 want to learn from, the mam issue for
me is. if they're going to be gone, you'd better put some people in their
place."
A group ol medical students met with Popp in early September to voice
I heir concerns about the loss of female role models and mentors and to lobby

for student input in hiring anil promotion decisions
