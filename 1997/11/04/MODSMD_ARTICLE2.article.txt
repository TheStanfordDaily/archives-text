# Med students concerned over situation of women on faculty
## 
### Ann Kim Contributing writer 
l he integration of female faculty in the School of Medicine remains a
thorny issue, with many students and facult\ expressing dissatisfaction at cur
rent rates of promotion and reappointment for women.
Richard Popp. the School of Medicine's senior associate dean for acade
mic affairs emphasized that any perceived trend is in no way the result of a
concerted effort on the part of the school.
However, several cases have emerged in which a specific faculty mem
ber's lack of advancement has served to focus student attention on the per
ceived problem.
According to Lucy Ruwitch, a second-year medical student, " These spe
cific women that have left are women that are dedicated to teaching, who ac
tually showed their face at the medical school, lectured, sponsored research,
held students by the hand, took them to their surgeries, look them tosee their
patients and were especially outgoing to the students."
Popp. however, maintained that the school is "trying to increase the num
ber of women and minorities in the faculty. We're trying to not only bring
them on the facultv but also help them have positive careers and retain them
here and have them advance through the ranks."
Popp pointed out that there has been an increase in the number of women
in the higher ranks of the faculty, something he referred to as "very desir
able."
Though Popp could not comment on indiv iduat cases, he did s;iy that I ac
uity members w ho are not promoted or reappointed "are very high-quality
ople and ma iv times they have outstanding characteristics in one area,
but tlu. may not maun in another area.
But second yeai medical student Allison (irow said, "Because |these
women| are the kind ol people that 1 want to learn from, the mam issue for
me is. if they're going to be gone, you'd better put some people in their
place."
A group ol medical students met with Popp in early September to voice
I heir concerns about the loss of female role models and mentors and to lobby

for student input in hiring anil promotion decisions

"When hiring or promotion decisions or evaluations aiv maile there
should he an explicit avenue for student input, said t now
1 he students felt that with their input, the hiring and
promotion decisions would take into account the impact a
faculty member has with students as a teacher and mentor.
Popp responded, "1 haven't been convinced that (the
review process] needs to be changed. It's a little difficult to
see a clear rationale for having students who aren't neces
sarily going to be here fork >ng peric>ds of time looking into
these things."
I lowever. Popp mentioned that as a result of his meet
ing with the medical students, he has asked that the Med
ical School Dean's ()tlice look into the data on retention
o! women faculty. I his data is not yet available.
Hui Popp cautioned that numbers often do not tell the
w hole story. " I here are lots of different reasons why peo
ple leave," he said. Private medical practice pays more,
and some people don't like the research requirement of
being on faculty, he explained.
Regarding the perception that the medical school has
problems retaining women faculty. Popp said he was "not
aware that there is a problem."
Hut Popp said he believes there is always room for im
provement. "We're trying really hard to attract women

and retain women," he said. "I think the more women we
have in the school, the more comfortable other women
will be in the school, the better women are succeeding in
the school, the more they will be role models for other
women, and the networks of women will work as well as
the networks of men."
Neurosurgery Prof. Frances Conley, chair of the Uni
versity's Faculty Senate, disagreed with Popp. "We're
doing a good job hiring, but the retention numbers are dis
appointing," she said.
Conley noted the rigors of academic medicine and the
larger toll this takes on women faculty. "I think women are
more hurt by it. We don't learn how to work the system."
"People may say that it's okay for a woman to take time
off to have a family, be with family, but a few months can
be injurious to a career path," said ( onley.
Regarding the environment for women at the medical
school. Conley said, "It's not as overtly sexist now, but it's
still there. There's a perception that women doctors arc
not quite as good. It's not stated to you. but the way you're
treated gives you that feeling."
A female member of the Medical Center's visiting clin
ical faculty who wished to remain anonymous added, "It's
my perception that the women who are leaving look at the
environment and say. 'Why bother to try and make a dent,
because it gets more and more evident that the kind of

changes that need to be put into place to retain women are
not happening.'"
The system by which medical faculty are reappointed
and promoted involves a review of the faculty member's
teaching, clinical skills and research by examining evalua
tions from students and colleagues both on and off cam
pus.
This process begins at the departmental level, then
moves on to the Dean's Office and the Provost's Office.
In addition, any faculty member who has been denied
a reappointment or promotion can appeal the decision.
The grievance can be filed with the department, the
Dean's Office or the Provost.
Grievants are always able to appeal their case to the
next level if their reappointment or promotion denial is
not overturned.
According to Popp, "It's always in the favor of the
grievant. If [the appeal] comes out positively for the griev
ant, [the process] stops. If it comes out negatively for the
grievant. they can always appeal again."
"It's a kind of balance that we hope is there to make
sure that there is not only objectivity but also some bal
ance in favor of the faculty member, because the faculty
member often feels less powerful than the department
heads," said Popp.
"It's the only process we have to keep the quality of

the faculty that makes us who we are." he said. "I cer
tainly understand when people are very unhappy and
disappointed when a denial occurs, but if denials never
occurred, we would also think the system doesn't work."
Kate O'Hanlan, a gynecological oncologist, was not
reappointed in 19% and is currently filing a grievance.
"She's a great teacher, and we all wanted to keep her
here," said third-year medical student Jennifer Mohr.
"What bothered us the most was that teaching didn't seem
to matter to the administration. Teaching is just not em
phasized here."
"To me it seemed like every patient I saw with her
loved her so much, and she was great with them." said
Mohr.
Another of O'Hanlan's students. Eve Zaritsky said,
"She was a great role model to a lot of people in the med
ical school and still is. 1 thoroughly enjoyed working with
her and got a lot of good exposure in the clinic with her."
Popp acknowledged that many valuable teachers do
end up in such situations.
"I think it's natural and maybe even newsworthy that
faculty leave and people say, 'Well how could it be that
this wonderful person left.' But what would happen if no
body ever left? .... An evaluation system is part of the
process that we have, and sometimes people pass that
threshold and sometimes they don't." said Popp.

A group ol medical students met with Popp in early September to voice
I heir concerns about the loss of female role models and mentors and to lobby

for student input in hiring anil promotion decisions

"When hiring or promotion decisions or evaluations aiv maile there

1 he students felt that with their input, the hiring and
promotion decisions would take into account the impact a
faculty member has with students as a teacher and mentor.
Popp responded, "1 haven't been convinced that (the
review process] needs to be changed. It's a little difficult to
see a clear rationale for having students who aren't neces
sarily going to be here fork >ng peric>ds of time looking into
these things."
I lowever. Popp mentioned that as a result of his meet
ing with the medical students, he has asked that the Med
ical School Dean's ()tlice look into the data on retention
o! women faculty. I his data is not yet available.
Hui Popp cautioned that numbers often do not tell the
w hole story. " I here are lots of different reasons why peo
ple leave," he said. Private medical practice pays more,
and some people don't like the research requirement of
being on faculty, he explained.
Regarding the perception that the medical school has
problems retaining women faculty. Popp said he was "not
aware that there is a problem."
Hut Popp said he believes there is always room for im
provement. "We're trying really hard to attract women

and retain women," he said. "I think the more women we
have in the school, the more comfortable other women
will be in the school, the better women are succeeding in
the school, the more they will be role models for other
women, and the networks of women will work as well as
the networks of men."
Neurosurgery Prof. Frances Conley, chair of the Uni
versity's Faculty Senate, disagreed with Popp. "We're
doing a good job hiring, but the retention numbers are dis
appointing," she said.
Conley noted the rigors of academic medicine and the
larger toll this takes on women faculty. "I think women are
more hurt by it. We don't learn how to work the system."
"People may say that it's okay for a woman to take time
off to have a family, be with family, but a few months can
be injurious to a career path," said ( onley.
Regarding the environment for women at the medical
school. Conley said, "It's not as overtly sexist now, but it's
still there. There's a perception that women doctors arc
not quite as good. It's not stated to you. but the way you're
treated gives you that feeling."
A female member of the Medical Center's visiting clin
ical faculty who wished to remain anonymous added, "It's
my perception that the women who are leaving look at the
environment and say. 'Why bother to try and make a dent,
because it gets more and more evident that the kind of

changes that need to be put into place to retain women are
not happening.'"
The system by which medical faculty are reappointed
and promoted involves a review of the faculty member's
teaching, clinical skills and research by examining evalua
tions from students and colleagues both on and off cam
pus.
This process begins at the departmental level, then
moves on to the Dean's Office and the Provost's Office.
In addition, any faculty member who has been denied
a reappointment or promotion can appeal the decision.
The grievance can be filed with the department, the
Dean's Office or the Provost.
Grievants are always able to appeal their case to the
next level if their reappointment or promotion denial is
not overturned.
According to Popp, "It's always in the favor of the
grievant. If [the appeal] comes out positively for the griev
ant, [the process] stops. If it comes out negatively for the
grievant. they can always appeal again."
"It's a kind of balance that we hope is there to make
sure that there is not only objectivity but also some bal
ance in favor of the faculty member, because the faculty
member often feels less powerful than the department
heads," said Popp.
"It's the only process we have to keep the quality of

the faculty that makes us who we are." he said. "I cer
tainly understand when people are very unhappy and
disappointed when a denial occurs, but if denials never
occurred, we would also think the system doesn't work."
Kate O'Hanlan, a gynecological oncologist, was not
reappointed in 19% and is currently filing a grievance.
"She's a great teacher, and we all wanted to keep her
here," said third-year medical student Jennifer Mohr.
"What bothered us the most was that teaching didn't seem
to matter to the administration. Teaching is just not em
phasized here."
"To me it seemed like every patient I saw with her
loved her so much, and she was great with them." said
Mohr.
Another of O'Hanlan's students. Eve Zaritsky said,
"She was a great role model to a lot of people in the med
ical school and still is. 1 thoroughly enjoyed working with
her and got a lot of good exposure in the clinic with her."
Popp acknowledged that many valuable teachers do
end up in such situations.
"I think it's natural and maybe even newsworthy that
faculty leave and people say, 'Well how could it be that
this wonderful person left.' But what would happen if no
body ever left? .... An evaluation system is part of the
process that we have, and sometimes people pass that
threshold and sometimes they don't." said Popp.
