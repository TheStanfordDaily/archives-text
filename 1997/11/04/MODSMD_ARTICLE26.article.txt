# Four faculty appointed to scientific society

### Erica Platt 
Four faculty members have recently received
recognition for their advancement of science and
their fostering of scientific and social applications.
Joining the 270 members of the American As
sociation for the Advancement of Science as fel
lows for 1997 are Steven Boxer, professor of
chemistry; Michael May, research professor of
engineering-economic systems and operations
research; Eric Shooter, professor of neurobiolo
gy and Richard Shavelson, dean of the School of
Education.
"The A A AS is a nonprofit professional society
dedicated to the advancement of scientific and
technological excellence across all disciplines, and
to the public's understanding of science and tech
nology," according to its statement.
Boxer researches heme proteins, including he
moglobin and myoglobin, along with electron
transfers within photosynthetic reaction centers.
In addition, he investigates microelectronics man
ufacturing techniques for placing millions of tiny
membrane patches on a computer chip. I lis group
has successfully cloned the gene for human myo

globin and created artificial proteins with the bio
logical activity of heme.
Shooter, who came to Stanford in 1%4 from
the University of London, has played a prominent
role in the understanding of the regulation of neu
ronal survival and regeneration.
In particular, he is interested in the action of
nerve growth factor and its receptors. Shooter has
identified the gene for the major inherited disease
of the human peripheral nervous system, Char
cot-Marie-Tooth disease and his findings may
provide the basis for therapies of similarly un
beatable neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's. Parkinson's and Huntington's dis
eases.
Shooter added that he was a chair of a new sec
tion for neuroscience at the Medical Center and a
member of several National Institutes of Health
committees and the National Institute for Neuro
logical Diseases and Stroke.
May, co-director of the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control and the former
director of the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory and an arms control negotiator in
1974, is currently interested in nuclear weapons

policy, increasing energy consumption in East
Asia and its resulting security issues, and nation
al security and the evolution of global informa
tion technologies.
May has also been a member of the Defense
Science Board, the Secretary of Energy's Advi
sory Board within the U.S. Department of Ener
gy and a part of the U.S. Delegation to the Strate
gic Arms Limitation Treaty talks from 1974 to
1976.
Shavelson has developed new ways to assess
performance in education and the workplace. By
examining alternatives to multiple-choice exams
in schools, the military and the working world and
by focusing current tools for scientific and math
ematical education assessment, Shavelson has de
veloped statistical methods for determining indi
vidual student performance.
Interested in the policy and practice issues of
measurement reform, Shavelson also chairs the
National Academy of Sciences' Board on Testing
and Assessment.
The new fellows will be presented with a cer
tificate and a pin at the association's annual meet
ing in Philadelphia in February.
