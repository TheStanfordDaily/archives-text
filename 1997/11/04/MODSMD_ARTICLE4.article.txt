In the question and answci session that lot
lowed, one audience inembei asked. "Mow dt
you know when a poem's finished?"
Crecley replied, "I don't know
how I write. It's like clay — when I
lose the rhythm, when it becomes
effort, when it becomes pushing, it's
over."
When asked to name his favorite
writers, Creeley first cited Sorrenti
no for his "endless inventions in
prose and poetry." Other influences
included Creeley's predecessors
Williams and Stevens, his Black
Mountain contemporaries, and the
poets Amiri liaraka and Ed Dorn.
Creeley also discussed his en
trance into the poetry world. "1
thought of poetry as the most deli
cious company I ever had in my
whole life. II you could dance, you
were welcome. II you could play.

you were welcome. There was a hi
erarchy. as in jazz, but no one was
excluded."
With respect to the act of com
posing, Creeley denied an attitude
of authorial intent. Rather, he de
scribed a sense of "not I but the wind
that blows through me... Poetry is
not an arbitrary situation: it tells you
want it wants to write."
Creeley criticized the tendency
of the poet to be "over-conscious of
what one is doing." Some poets
think "it isn't what I wanted to
write" and so "throw away what it's
meant to be."
( reeley closed by urging poets to
"write any poem don't just write
the one you're thinking of."
I lis presentation was part of the
Lane Lecture Series of readings.
Today Creeley will give a talk enti
tled "A Poet's Life" in Encina Com
