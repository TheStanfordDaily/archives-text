# Judicial panel pool named
## 
### Sims Ely 
In an effort to improve Honor C ode violation hearings,
the ASSU appointed 30 students last Tuesday to the new
Stanford Judicial Panel Pool.
The panel pool, composed of the students, 15 faculty and
15 staff, will hear all cases when formal charges of Honor
Code or Fundamental Standard violations are filed.
The pool was created last year when students, faculty
and University President Gerhard Casper ratified the new
Judicial Charter. The charter was drafted by the Commit
tee of 15, which debated proposed changes for more than a
year.
Under the new system, each case will be heard by a six
member group chosen from the larger pool. The groups will
each be composed of four students and two faculty or staff
members.
The new policy will create a kind of trial by one's peers
for accused violators.
"1 think that a student knowing that a group of his peers
disapprove of his actions is less likely to repeat the offense."
said pool member Lauren Travis, a freshman.
The judicial panel pool offers a dramatic increase in the
authority students have in decisions concerning the Honor
Code and the Fundamental Standard.
"By serving on the panel pool and becoming more active
in the student judicial process, I think students will better
understand the Fundamental Standard and its importance
to our community." said pool member Ryan Stuart, a
sophomore. "The value of students monitoring their own
actions under the Honor Code is immeasurable."
Any student can potentially serve in the panel pool.
There are now 30 students in the pool, but more positions
will be added. "Every student has the right and obligation
to be part of the process which determines how issues of
academic integrity are handled."
said pool member Cary Kadlecek, a
junior majoring in political science.
Applications for the pool are avail
able in the ASSIJ office in Tresid
der Union.
"Because the applicant pool last
spring was inadequate, the commit
tee decided to hold off on some of
the nominations until this quarter,"
said ASSIJ Nominations Commis
sion Chair Lisa Liao, a junior. The
commission is responsible for the
nomination of all student represen

tativcs to I Jnivcrsity committees.
Under the old charter. almost all
cases were decided by a single ad
ministrator with a judicial affairs of
ficer both advising and prosecuting
the accused student. Although
there was a provision allowing for
student-faculty juries, the process
took much longer.
Under the new charter, com
plaints must be filed within 60 days
of the alleged violation. A judicial
adviser will counsel both sides, and
a separate judicial officer will gath
er evidence and determine
whether charges against a student
are valid so that a case should be
brought.
