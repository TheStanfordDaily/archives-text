various clubs lor awhile, such as Par
adise Lounge in San Francisco and
The Cactus Club in San Jose. They
also toured Texas last summer and
play often in Los Angeles.
'The first place we played was at
the Coconut leaser on Sunset in
Hollywood. It was like a Stanford
reunion," King said. There were 50
people from Stanford down there. It
was really fun.
"Even though I always loved
music, I came [into Stanford] with
the mentality that I was going to get
an economics degree and play
music, and if something crazy hap
pens, then something cra/y hap
pens," said King, who is now a reli
gious studies major.
Putting the economics major be
hind him wasn't a difficult decision,
King said. "It wasn't hard but it's
definitely scary turning back on

everything you were supposed to do
all your life."
Although Mobley is excited
about the band's prospects, he said
he sees medical school in his future.
'Tm just in the band to have fun at
this point," Mobley said. "1 think the
rest of them are pretty serious about
it."
The band's willpower is not the
only factor contributing to their re
cent successes. They've also put in a
lot of time and effort.
According to King, every week
since the third week of September,
he leaves Thursday night to drive
down to Los Angeles in order to be
in the studio for the entire weekend.
Then he drives back Sunday night,
arriving at Stanford between 2 a.m.
and 3 a.m. Monday.
"They're two totally different
worlds," King said, referring to
Stanford and the studio in Los An
geles. "It's hard to jump back and
forth and it's really hard to concen
trate sometimes. I'll be sitting in a

midterm thinking about what vo
cals I'm going to be singing that
night."
King sings and plays the guitar
for the band. I le also writes most of
their songs, while Mobley plays the
bass and Labrosse plays drums.
"We've finally gotten to the point
where we've been together long
enough so that we can write music as
a band," King said.
He looks to the future with
hope, especially with the projected
release of their demo tape. In music,
sudden launches into fame are not
unheard of.
"The lead singer of Matchbox
20. Rob, is a good friend of mine,"
King said. "It happened so quickly
for them. They were playing the
Cactus Club in July or August and
now, just recently, they were play
ing to a sold-out audience at the
Fillmore."
For now. Canvas will be concen
trating on finishing their demo tape.
And after that, who knows?
