Additionally. Stanford will build
I.KH) units of housing for senior cit
izens. faculty and staff along Sand
1 iill and expand the Stanford Shop
ping center by SO.(KK) square feet.
"The community is going to
have an important new transit sys
tem on the Sand Hill corridor, and
the Sand Hill bottleneck will be a
thing of the past," said Larry I lor

ton, the University's director of
government and community rela
tions.
Hie final days of the campaign
were hard-fought for Stanford,
which accused its opposition of bla
tant misrepresentation in campaign
advertising. In total, the University
spent $35().(X)Oon the campaign.
Measure M would have restrict
ed Sand Mill Road expansion to a
maximum of three lanes and set
limits for land utilization in the
Sand I iill vicinity,
Stanford will now spend $342
million over five years to imple
ment the plan. Over the next eight
months, the Stanford Management
C ompany must determine how it
w ill finance the measure and submit
its plan for approval by both its own
board of directors and the Stanford
Board of Trustees.
Both campaigns held parties last
night within feet of Palo Alto City

At the Cardinal i lotel.some 2(H)
residents, Stanford executives and
volunteers watched as returns were
announced over a Palo Alto com
munity access cable channel.
Morton spoke to supporters be
fore 11 p.m. last night but said his
"conservative nature" would not let
him claim victory with only 40 per
cent of precincts reporting.
Morton thanked volunteers for
their work throughout the cam
paign.
"No matter what happens, it has
been a real privilege to work with
the team we've had working on
this," he said.

Government and Community Re
lations Office to walk precincts
throughout the clay, beginning with
a 5 a.m. sendoff from Provost ('on

Measure O supporters watch election results come in at a party last night in Palo Alto's Cardinal Hotel.
The measure would go on to pass with 55 percent of the vote, while the alternative, Measure M, only gar
nered 38 percent and failed.
ers watched the returns from the
Blue Chalk Cafe. Peter Drekmeier,
Measure M's campaign manager,
addressed the audience shortly after
9 p.m., before the bulk of the votes
were counted.
Though Measure M failed,
Drekmeier said afterwards that the
campaign sent a strong message to
Stanford which will affect any future
development plans.
"We did what we could," Drek
meier said. "It was a great citizen's
movement that raised a lot of
awareness."
Drekmeier is hopeful that Stan
lord's plans may still be thwarted by
a lawsuit that disputes the results of
the environmental impact report on
Measure ().
Stanford's battle to widen Sand
I lill Road to Santa Cruz Avenue is
not over, however. The University

must now negotiate with a hostile
Menlo Park City Council to re
ceive approvals to expand the por
tion of Sand Hill from the San
Francisquito Creek to Santa Cruz
Avenue. The narrow strip is an un
incorporated area of San Mateo
County and controlled by Menlo
Park.
After the Measure C) construc
tion is complete, there will he very
few areas for future expansion, and
the faculty housing crunch will still
not he solved, said Laurance
Hoagland, CEO of the manage
ment company.
Hoagland said the University
may consider purchasing more land
if necessary, hut said that currently
the idea is "quite speculative."
In his public comments last night,
Horton encouraged Measure ()
supporters not to give up fighting
until the entire project is complete.
"Should something happen in
the future, this is the coalition I'd
like to work with," he said.
