## Republicans top election Win governor of Virginia, mayor of New York City 
### 
(AP) — Republicans won off
year election runaways for governor
of Virginia, mayor of New York City
and a seat in Congress yesterday, but
New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman,
a GOP star nationally, was strug
gling to survive a Democratic chal
lenge.
Jim Gilmore was elected gover
nor of Virginia, Mayor Rudoph Giu
liani won a second term in New
York, and Vito Fossella became the
congressman from Staten Island.
While the close count in New Jer
sey mixed the GOP message, the
Republican Party chairman said the
elections of 1997 had built "great
momentum" for 1998.
Whitman was in a virtual dead
lock with Democrat Jim McGreevey
as the vote count passed 96 percent.
The upstart challenger, hardly
known when his challenge took
hold, trailed by 7,(XX) votes out of 2.3
million counted as both were gaining
46 percent of the total. A third entry,
Murray Sabrin. a Libertarian but a
foe of abortion rights unlike the
other two, was getting 5 percent.
lowa Gov. Terry Branstad, chair
man of the GOP governors, said
Whitman had suffered over the
abortion issue. She had vetoed a ban
on late-term abortions, stirring con
servative wrath.
Gingrich said it wasn't just that,
but lack of a clear message. "The
campaign was in a muddle," said the
speaker, who in 1996 had suggested
Whitman belonged on the short list
of vice presidential prospects.
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont,

chairman of the Democratic gover
nors, said running close, let alone
defeating, a front-rank Republican
was a boost for the next elections.
Republicans swept the other top
prizes.
In Virginia, Gilmore, who
resigned as attorney general to run
for governor, trounced Democratic
Lt. Gov. Don Beyer on the strength
of a tax cut pledge even Democrats
deemed a masterful campaign stroke
— repeal of an unpopular levy on
automobiles, which had come due
for payment just a month before
election day.
With the vote count nearing com
pletion, it was Gilmore 56 percent,
Beyer 42.
"A terrific victory," House
Speaker Newt Gingrich said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
"It means taxes continue to be an
important issue," said Branstad.
Gilmore's overwhelming victory
propelled the Republican ticket to
the election of a GOP lieutenant
governor, John Hager, and thus to
control of the evenly divided state
Senate, where he will cast the tie
breaking vote.
" This race in Virginia will be a
model for other races next year,"
said Jim Nicholson, the Republican
national chairman. He said people
are fed up with taxes, and when
Republican campaign on the issue,
they get enormous results.
It worked for Whitman the first
time she ran, four years ago, promis
ing a 30 percent cut in the New Jer
sey income tax, and delivering as

governor.
She reminded voters of that as
she campaigned for a second term,
but they had other concerns. "We
knew that it was going to he tough,
and it is," Nicholson said.
In New York City, Giuliani easily
outdistanced Ruth Messinger, presi
dent of the borough of Manhattan,
to become the first Republican
mayor to win a second term since
Fiorello LaGuardia in IIMI.l l MI.
His issues were crime control,
combating drugs, improving the
quality of life. Most New York vot
ers interviewed outside the polls
judged the economy improved and
their neighborhoods more orderly
with Giuliani as mayor.
He's avoided talking about his
future beyond city hall, but foreclos
es nothing. There will be a Senate
election for a Democratic seat in
2(KK) in New York.
On Staten Island, Fossella, 32, a
city councilman, trounced Eric Vital
iano, a conservative Democratic vet
eran of the state legislature, to win a
House seat Republicans have held
for 17 years. It was left open when
Susan Molinari resigned to go into
television, and the national party
had poured nearly $X(K),(XX) into the
campaign to keep it Republican,
with advertisements assailing Vital
iano as a supporter of state tax
increases.
Fossella won 63 percent to 37 per
cent, a startling margin in ;i contest
that had been rated a tossup, and a
GOP showing surely bolstered by
the strength of the Giuliani ticket.
