### 
WASHINGTON (AF) — Fresi
dent Clinton warned Saddam Hus
sein yesterday it would be "a big
mistake" to try to shoot down
American U-2 spy planes flying
over Iraq.
In his first public comments on
the escalating tensions with Bagh
dad, Clinton urged that efforts be
redoubled to end the crisis through
diplomacy. But the administration
made clear it was not backing down.
Defense Secretary William
Cohen warned of "serious conse
quences" if U.S. planes are attacked.
Clinton expressed determination to
prevent Iraq from acquiring
weapons of mass destruction.
In Iraq, Saddam's lieutenants
turned back U.N. weapons inspec
tors for a second day. Iraq has

threatened to expel seven Ameri
cans from the inspection team,
claiming they are spies.
White House spokesman Mike
McCurry, asked about Saddam's
intentions, mocked the Iraqi leader.
"It's just literally impossible to
imagine what goes into such a con
voluted and tortured mind,"
McCurry said.
Clinton urged Saddam to com
ply with IJ.N. resolutions and allow
weapons inspections to proceed
unhindered. "If he has nothing to
hide, if he's not trying to develop
weapons of mass destruction, then
he shouldn't care whether Ameri
cans or anyone else are on the
inspection team.
"This may be just another
dodge," the president said of Sad

dam's threats.
Asked how the United States
would respond if Iraq targets
American-piloted I'-2 (lights. Clin
ton replied: " That would be a big
mistake."
( linton, talking with reporters in
the Rose Garden, said the U-2
flights are carried out under the
authority of the I Jnited Nations for
a lI.N. mission.
"The world has an interest, stat
ed in the United Nations Security
resolution, in preventing Iraq from
developing weapons of mass
destruction," Clinton said.
Urging a peaceful solution. Clinton
said, "I believe at this moment we
should do everything we can to
resolve this diplomatically and wc
should reserve judgment."
