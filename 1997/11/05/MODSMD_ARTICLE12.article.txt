Terrorist trial winding down
NEW YORK (AP) — The man accused of
masterminding the World Trade Center bomb
ing was framed by overzealous federal agents
eager to make arrests at the expense of the
truth, a defense attorney told jurors yesterday.
"It doesn't make sense how Ram/i Yousef
was in the United States with no money and no
contacts and somehow becomes the master
mind of the World Trade Center bombing."
attorney Roy Kulcsar said in closing arguments.
Kulcsar suggested that Secret Service Agent
Brian Parr lied when he testified that Yousef
confessed after his 1995 arrest in Pakistan.
The attorney said he found it hard to believe
that Yousef openly recounted the bombing but
then refused to discuss how he met two of the
four men already sentenced to 240 years each
for the attack.
Yousef. an electrical engineer of uncertain
nationality, is accused of organizing a group of
accomplices and building a bomb that was
intended to topple the twin 110-story towers,
kill tens of thousands of people and shock the
United States into curbing aid to Israel.
The towers remained standing in the Feb.
26, 1993. attack, but six people were killed,
more than I.(KK) were injured and the complex
sustained more than $500 million in damage.
Yousef l(K>ked straight ahead throughout
Kulcsar s argument just as he had a day earlier
when a prosecutor described him as a "cold
blooded terrorist."
U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy said the jury
would get the case today after prosecutor's
make a rebuttal argument. Yousef and a 26-

year-old alleged accomplice, Eyad Ismoil, face
life in prison if convicted of conspiracy, the
most serious charge.
Internet tax ban endorsed
WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite objec
tions from state and local governments, a Sen
ate panel endorsed a hill yesterday that would
ban local taxes aimed at the Internet and online
computer services and transactions.
The bill, opposed by many states and cities
currently taxing Internet services, cleared the
Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation
Committee on a 14-5 vote.
"The Internet will be the business infrastruc
ture of the 21st Century," said Sen. Ron
Wyden, D-Ore., the bill's chief sponsor.
"To subject it to as many as 30.000 taxing
jurisdictions applying different rules of taxation
would be a mistake," he said.
The bill would declare a five-year moratori
um on any state or local taxes specifically direct
ed at Internet use or electronic commerce.
The Clinton administration opposes lederal
taxation of the Internet, where business deal
ings could rise to as much as $150 billion in the
next few years by some estimates.
Connecticut. Tennessee, Pennsylvania,
Texas, Ohio and Wisconsin are among states
taxing some Internet services, according to a
New York State Tax Department study
released earlier this year.
Ohio fiov. George Voinovich, chairman of
the NGA, said a few large corporations would
benefit from the legislation at the expense of
Main Street businesses, especially in rural
areas.

"The small corner hardware or clothing
stores in towns across America will not he ahli
to compete with businesses selling tax liei
goods on the Internet." he said.
Wyden said local governments still would hi
allowed to collect taxes from companies doinj
business on the Internet as long as the taxes arc
applied in a "technologically neutral way."
A similar measure has been introduced it
the 1 louse.
Pathfinder won't phone home
PASADENA. Calif. (AP) Scientists ant
engineers bid a reluctant farewell yesterday t<
Ihe successful Mars Pathfinder, which remain'
out of touch despite efforts to have it call hoim
once more.
( ontrollers will keep trying to make contaci
every two weeks through the end ol the yeai
because a chance remains of getting through
and "we don't want to give up on that yet." mis
sion manager Richard ( ook said.
The Pathfinder landed July 4 and was sup
posed to last at least a month. It delivered it
last batch of data Sept. 27 and uttered its last
peep from Mars on Oct. 7.
The spacecraft might have fallen victim t<
temperature-related problems stemming from
battery failure. Electronics that warmed the
lander each day stopped coming on and it was
hobbled by cold.
The foot-high Sojourner rover, expected t<
last at least a week after it rolled onto the sur
face of Mars, may still be circling the lander
trying like a lost child to call out to the mother
ship. However. Jacob Matijevic. the rover man
ager. suspects it might be stuck on a rock.
