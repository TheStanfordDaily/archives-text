University suggestions
threaten the ambiance
and tradition of Flicks.

Another Stanford tradition
is coming under fire front Universi
ty officials. In addition to the long
list of activities that have been the subject of
scrutiny over the years, most recently the
Big Game bonfire, we can now add Sunday
Flicks.
Stanford Events Director Lois Wagner
has put forth a proposal that would require
that Sunday Flicks be ushered by Universi
ty personnel.
Other requests by made by Wagner and
administrators in the Office of Student
Activities include having Flicks organizers
to institute a backpack check at the door
and discontinue the promotion of paper
fights.
Imagine it... Flicks minus the hype.
Flicks has been around for as long as
Memorial Auditorium has been around,
both are celebrating their 60th anniversary
this year. The paper fights and student
organizers and ushers are as much a part of
the Stanford Flicks tradition as the cartoon
previews, erratic film quality and loud com
ments during the show.
The University's request that the paper
fights not be advertised undermines the
spirit of Sunday Flicks. The paper fights act
as one of the biggest draws for students to
attend movies that were released months
ago or have already made it to video.
Students aren't paying to see movies on
the auditorium's big screen, we're paying to
have a fun time.
According to the administrators, these
requests are a consequence of more than $4
million in renovations to Mem Aud includ
ing new carpeting and new leather doors. In
fact much of the costs went toward renova
tions to accommodate disabled patrons, for

example, installing bathrooms on first floor
and new disabled seating.
Wagner claims that University ushers
are necessary to prevent damage to the
auditorium by food and beverages brought
in by Flicks patrons. However, the Axe
Committee currently ushers the Sunday
night films and sends 20 to 30 members to
monitor the doors and aisles.
Axe Comm ushers, especially now that
they are equipped with flashlights, are
equally as capable of enforcing the rules as
University ushers.
They possess the skills necessary to iden
tify and ask for the removal of food and
drinks, ensure that no one stands on the
chairs and keep patrons off of the balcony
railing.
The recent suggestions by Stanford
Events point to a fundamental mistrust for
students. After all, when Stanford Lively
Arts (which is run by Wagner) holds events
in the auditorium, it maintains a concession
stand for its attendees. Clearly, Wagner
believes that student ushers cannot perform
regulatory jobs as adequately as University
staff and that the student patrons of Flicks
cannot handle concessions without making
a mess. These same students cannot be
trusted to keep their bags with them during
the movie.
Hiring University ushers is also a waste
of money. ITiese usher would have to be
paid union wages, whereas the Axe Comm
charges about $1,000 a quarter to staff
Flicks — essentially volunteering services
to maintain this student tradition.
Stanford Events should allow the Axe
Comm ushers the chance to actively
enforce the rules and allow students to
carry their possessions where they choose.
Even the Bookstore has discontinued the
its restrictive backpack check-in.
Furthermore, the University should
work with the Flicks organizers to address
the concerns while maintaining the tradi
tion of Flicks, not only in name, but also in
spirit.
