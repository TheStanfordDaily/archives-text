## Accurately saying what you mean 
### 
Around 1946,
George Orwell
wrote in "Politics
and the English Lan
guage" that English
"becomes ugly and inac
curate because our
thoughts are foolish, but
the slovenliness of our

language makes it easier for us to have fool
ish thoughts."
In short, generally stupid thinking leads
to generally stupid ideas that become incor
porated into our language and — surprise!
— encourage us to have more generally
stupid thoughts.
For people who value free thinking and
who understand the resulting responsibili
ties, this sort of vicious cycle is beastly.
Orwell, for example, argued that this break
down of language was destroying political
discourse, with the potential to cause chaos,
loss of freedom and death.
Do you know what sheriffs in Humboldt
County do to peaceful logging protesters
under guise of "using minimal force"?
Did you know that the President of
China analogizes the occupation of Tibet
with Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation?
Do the phrases "energetic disassembly
event," "predawn vertical insertion" and
"target servicing" make you think of Three
Mile Island, invading Kuwait and dropping
artillery shells on people?
Orwell has a point.
But this decline in language affects more

than just politics. It works its way into every
thing.
Let's take a very simple example. I want
to talk about a word we use every single day
that, in and of itself, has come to mean very
little.
That word is "friend."
If Rene tells you that Bob is her friend,
what do you take that to mean? Does Rene
have to like Bob? What does Rene know
about Bob? If Bob walks up to Rene and
says "Hiya," will Rene remember his name?
After serious analysis, I've come to the
conclusion that the most we can expect is for
Rene to be able to pick out Bob in a police
lineup after three tries (two if Bob waves).
In short, it could mean anything and thus
denotes little.
I've heard people say the stupidest things
imaginable in an attempt to salvage this
word. We have the superlatives — "good
friend," "great friend," "really great friend,"
"really truly amazingly great friend" (trans
lation: can identify person and converse
pleasantly for five minutes).
Next, the follow-up cliches — "we go way
back" (translation: may not recognize the
person anymore), "he's a really nice guy"
(translation: he isn't a serial killer), "she's
really interesting" (translation: weirdo).
I've even had people tell me that some
one was a "friend friend" of theirs. Should
there be any other kind? That guy-I-hate
friend of mine? The person-I-don't-know
friend of mine?
What are the consequences of using this

meaningless term? We get into friendships
without trying to understand or describe
them, because we don't have the guts to say
what some interactions really are. This leads
to all sorts of nastiness. as many common
social ills stem from people ignoring how
they relate.
For example: you think you can trust
someone with something, but it turns out
you can't. Someone starts caring about you
too much. You find yourself spending all
your time with people who don't give a
damn about you — yet, these people are
your "friends."
Enough already! Take a stand for your
self and call it like you see it for a change.
The downstairs RA isn't your friend: you
"barely know him, but he seems pleasant."
Your soon-to-be-girlfriend Rene isn't your
friend: you "care about her very deeply and
want to see her more often." That evil
woman isn't your friend: she's a "stupid, self
centered little wench."
If you try hard enough, the people you
care about will benefit, and you'll better
understand how you interact with the world.
If you keep sliding, no one — not even
yourself — will know what you're saying
anymore, and Orwell's nightmare will
become your reality.
Good luck.

nicely.
