# 'We had a place we called home'
## Eviction of homeless causes hurt, confusion 
### Nadia Amer 
It's 1:30 a.m. and Katie shivers
under her plastic poncho as the
night chill and pregnant clouds
foreshadow the first rain of the sea
son. Three days ago, she would
have been at home, or at least what
she called home, but tonight she
wanders Fl ( amino Real wonder
ing where she will go.
On Oct. 7, a barrage of Menlo
Park and Palo Alto police and
Santa Clara County public works
crews evicted the homeless for the
final time from San Francisquito
Creek. At 7:30 a.m.. work crews
began clearing out the possessions
of about 15 homeless people, who
had for many years called the creek
their home. It was not the first time
they were told to move on. but it
was to bo the last.
"Now they've really displaced
us." said Katie, who would only
identify herself by her first name.
"We had a place we called home,
and now we don't. They took all
my stuff, I had a real nice black
leather couch, and they took that
away."
Although the creek dwellers
were given until Oct. 27 to collect
their belongings, they no longer
have anywhere to put them.
"When they picked this stuff up.
that was all these people had in
their lives," said Cliff Terrell, a
case worker for the Urban Min
istry in Palo Alto.
Also on hand the day of the
eviction were members of the
Santa Clara ( ounty Social Services
Homeless l earn and the Stanford
I lomeless Action ( oalition.
"We do not promote [the home
less) living in that kind of situa
tion." said Kathy Espino/a
-1 loward. the homeless coordinator
for Santa ( lara C ountv. "All of the

people living outside are living in
an unsafe and unhealthy situa
tion."
A special Homeless Team was
designed as a "multi disciplinary"
task force made up of members
from alcohol, drug, mental and
public health and social services to
provide assistance for people who
need it, explained Espino/a-
I loward.
Members of the team "were at
the creek all through the month of
September and the day of the actu
al cleanup, providing [the home
less] with opportunities for shelter
beds in Redwood City, San Jose
and San Francisco," Espino/a
-1 ioward said.
According to Santa Clara
County Social Services, before the
eviction there was one shelter bed
available at the Clare Mateo Shel
ter in Menlo Park and 12 beds
available in all to the homeless.
However, Espino/.a-Howard con
ceded that the shelter situation in
the Menlo Park and Palo Alto area
is "difficult".
Hut many of the homeless said
they do not find these accommoda
tions to be viable alternatives. ( ur
tis Roans, an on-and-oli resident of
the creek since 1991, decried the al
ternatives as being "cruel."
"The people from the creek are
family." Roans said. "These are the
only people I know, they are the
closest thing to family I got. Why
do I want to go to San Francisco or
San Jose?"
Roans' comments mirrored the
sentiments of other members of
the "creek crew."
"We watched out for each
other." Katie said. "When some
body needed a blanket or some
food, we gave it to them, but now
we have nowhere to go."
"For the people living there, this
was a huge shock and a lot of them
didn't know where they would be
sleeping that night," said senior
Bjorn Johnson, a SHAC member
who witnessed the eviction with
other Stanford students. "It was
very disturbing to see a policy of
sweeping out the homeless. At that
point, we all felt really powerless."
The homeless have been setting
up camp in San Francisquito Creek
for many years. They are used to
being asked to move on, but this
time, the eviction is permanent.
"There has been more concern
expressed in the last year by resi
dents for health and sanitation rea
sons," Menlo Park Police Chief
Bruce Cumming said. "There's a
strong movement now to not have
people living in the creek and pol
luting it." In order to enforce the
policy, ( ummingsaid police will be
making regular patrols of the
creek.
Hut many of the homeless ques
tion the reasons behind the evic
tion, calling them "politically moti
vated." Larry Duncan, a board
member for the Urban Ministry in

Palo Alto, warned that the "other
shoe hasn't dropped yet." Duncan
said he is skeptical about health vi
olations reported by a senior envi
ronmental specialist for San Mateo
County in May and believes law en
forcement will start citing for tres
passing on state property.
"The interesting thing with the
trespassing issue is that really no
body owns the creek," said Jim
Burklo, currently the campus min
ister for United Campus Christian
Ministry at Stanford University.
According to sophomore Shan
non Frank, student coordinator of
SHAC, there are more than 41 dif
ferent organizations, including
State Fish and Game, Parks and
Recreation, Caltrans, and Stanford
University, holding jurisdiction
over the corridor that divides
Menlo Park and Palo Alto.
" This new policy of zero toler
ance and absolute enforcement" is,
in part, the result of joint meetings
of the Menlo Park and Palo Alto
Neighborhood Associations over
the proposed Sand Hill Road Ex
tension Project, according to Burk
lo, who has worked with the home
less for many years.
The recent passage of the Palo
Alto "sit-lie" ordinance in July of
this year is one example that the

"Palo Alto City Council has be
come a lot less friendly to leaving
the homeless to their own means,"
Burklo said.
Katie, like the others who lived
in the creek, usually spends her
mornings at the Urban Ministry,
situated across the street from the
upscale Stanford Shopping Center.
The Urban Ministry, a place where
the homeless can get fresh cups of
coffee and oatmeal, also provides
bus passes and social service assis
tance programs.
"These people aren't transients.
These people have been down here
for a while. This is where they live,"
said Terrell. "It's like pulling up
roots and going somewhere else,
and that's why they don't want to
leave, just like anybody else."
"When my mother passed, I lost
it. That's when I really gave up,"
Katie said of the final straw that led
to her being homeless. At the mo
ment she is trying to find a job, but
said the eviction will make it more
difficult for her. She now sleeps in
whatever brush cover she can find
but worries about the safety of the
lack in numbers.
"The only place I know 1 11 be at
is [the Urban Ministry]," Katie
said. "But I never know where I
will be the next night."
