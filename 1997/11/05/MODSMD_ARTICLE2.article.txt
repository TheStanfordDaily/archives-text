## Eviction of homeless causes hurt, confusion

It's 1:30 a.m. and Katie shivers
under her plastic poncho as the
night chill and pregnant clouds
foreshadow the first rain of the sea
son. Three days ago, she would
have been at home, or at least what
she called home, but tonight she
wanders Fl ( amino Real wonder
ing where she will go.
On Oct. 7, a barrage of Menlo
Park and Palo Alto police and
Santa Clara County public works
crews evicted the homeless for the
final time from San Francisquito
Creek. At 7:30 a.m.. work crews
began clearing out the possessions
of about 15 homeless people, who
had for many years called the creek
their home. It was not the first time
they were told to move on. but it
was to bo the last.
"Now they've really displaced
us." said Katie, who would only
identify herself by her first name.
"We had a place we called home,
and now we don't. They took all
my stuff, I had a real nice black
leather couch, and they took that
away."
Although the creek dwellers
were given until Oct. 27 to collect
their belongings, they no longer
have anywhere to put them.
"When they picked this stuff up.
that was all these people had in
their lives," said Cliff Terrell, a
case worker for the Urban Min
istry in Palo Alto.
Also on hand the day of the
eviction were members of the
Santa Clara ( ounty Social Services
Homeless l earn and the Stanford
I lomeless Action ( oalition.
"We do not promote [the home
less) living in that kind of situa
tion." said Kathy Espino/a
-1 loward. the homeless coordinator
for Santa ( lara C ountv. "All of the

people living outside are living in
an unsafe and unhealthy situa
tion."
A special Homeless Team was
designed as a "multi disciplinary"
task force made up of members
from alcohol, drug, mental and
public health and social services to
provide assistance for people who
need it, explained Espino/a-
I loward.
Members of the team "were at
the creek all through the month of
September and the day of the actu
al cleanup, providing [the home
less] with opportunities for shelter
beds in Redwood City, San Jose
and San Francisco," Espino/a
-1 ioward said.
According to Santa Clara
County Social Services, before the
eviction there was one shelter bed
available at the Clare Mateo Shel
ter in Menlo Park and 12 beds
available in all to the homeless.
However, Espino/.a-Howard con
ceded that the shelter situation in
the Menlo Park and Palo Alto area
is "difficult".
Hut many of the homeless said
they do not find these accommoda
tions to be viable alternatives. ( ur
tis Roans, an on-and-oli resident of
the creek since 1991, decried the al
ternatives as being "cruel."
"The people from the creek are
family." Roans said. "These are the
only people I know, they are the
closest thing to family I got. Why
do I want to go to San Francisco or
San Jose?"
Roans' comments mirrored the
sentiments of other members of
the "creek crew."
"We watched out for each
other." Katie said. "When some
body needed a blanket or some
food, we gave it to them, but now
