Gender equity part of
social conscience
1 read with interest your article on gender / tenure
controversies in the medical school. Are we getting
the idea that this is a university-wide problem? Asso
ciate Dean [Richard] Popp's response to the proposal
that there may be deeper problems with the way
women faculty are assessed has a familiar ring "... an
evaluation system is part of the process we have, and
sometimes people pass that threshold and sometimes
they don't."
Problem is, more of those people who "don't"
seem to be women. If women arc being recruited and
hired at an increasing rate, but gender ratios among
tenured faculty are stagnant and in some departments
falling, how do you explain the disjuncture. If this is
pure meritocracy, then women must be inferior schol
ars. doctors, engineers, etc. Does anybody really buy
that?
Popp wonders why students (transients in his
mind) should care? I think if he had a social con
science. he might understand that not all of us are
only out for number one. Some of us care because we
want to leave a University behind that is more just.

more diverse and does a better job teaching than it
did when we attended. My sympathies to the med stu
dents, they are about to get a full repeat of the com
pany line developed in the Gupta and Sawislak cases.
D6ja vu all over again.

Look around and

This is a letter requesting Stanford members to do
something simple. The request is to appreciate the
great abundance here Stanford. There is a growing
mean streak at Stanford, which may be the effect of
growing complexity here. Hurried drivers cutting
crippled people off from their path, people nudging
away other people to get their exams first, people
arguing with each other over trifles are all instances of
antagonism I have seen.
With the infiltration of the business-warfare bot
torn-line mode of thought here, there cannot be any
thing other than increasing greed and animosity. Why

must this he so? Is life at large doomed to the vacil
lating influences of the corporation and the stock
market? Isn't Stanford an institution of higher learn
ing where we seek the light of truth and the better
ment of society? Or are we actually at a ruthless busi
ness institution under the pretense of higher learning?
Jiddu Krishnamurti once said. "The desire to gain,
individually or for a group, leads to ignorance and
illusion, to destruction and misery. This desire is not
only for more and more physical comforts, but also
for power: the power of money, of knowledge, of
identification." We don't have to choose the ticket to
collective misery; there is much to smile about
already.

Grundy's column poor excuse
for humor
Garry Grundy deserves a pat on the back. I
thought I'd have to wait until Friday's "Diversions"
for my weekly dose of poor humor â€” "The Jamba

Solution," I suppose, is an early treat.
In between hinging and purging and cramming in
episodes of "Baywatch" (while counting my money), 1
happened upon his glorious prose: "First, let's run a
bulldozer through Jamba Juice; that would set the
tone for all other trendy, yuppie, California-style
establishments that wanna transform all of Stanford
into cherry-pickin', bourgeois, Volvo-driving anorexi
cs."
Y'know, we bimbos can get touchy about that
stuff.
My (Californian) roommate's comment pretty
much covers my response to, like, Garry's critique of
health food: "Bullshit. It tastes good."
As for his off-color remarks on "our favorite trend
following Stanford student," I'd be more likely to
ignore the sick stereotyping if he was actually funny.
In the long run. though, I'm not bitter. It's hard to
take criticism seriously from someone who plunks
down $30,(X)0 a year to be part of a "California-style
establishment" just like I do. Why don't you put your
money where your mouth is, Garry? I hear the Har
vard Republicans have fried chicken at every meeting.
