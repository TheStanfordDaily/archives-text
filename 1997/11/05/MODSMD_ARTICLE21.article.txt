## Romance has no place in a train couchette 
### 
Marni Left

BEFORE 1 LEFT for Paris last week,
the prospect of taking a night train
held some kind of strangely romantic
appeal. I pictured myself lying on a
couchette, watching the lights of passing
cities reflected in the train's windows, the
motion of the train gently rocking me, lulling
me into a peaceful sleep.
I'd sleep soundly and awaken in time to
catch my connecting train and arrive in Paris
perhaps in need of a shower, but refreshed
and well-rested.
The day that I left, as I talked to a num
ber of people on the Stanford-in-Berlin pro
gram who'd done a lot of traveling at the end
of the summer; I suffered from a minor real
ity check. Still, I tried to remain optimistic.
Everyone seemed to agree that as long as 1
reserved a couchette, the overnight train
experience should prove painless.
Everyone except my friend Vanessa that
is. Aware of my feelings about youth hostels
and other such sub-par accommodations.

she overheard the end of the conversation.
She laughed and said to me, "You know you
really don't strike me as the couchette type."
At the time, 1 kind of resented her
remark, though I didn't really disagree with
her. I did. however, develop second, and
even third, thoughts.
11:06 p.m. I board the train and survey
my surroundings. Sure it's a far cry from the
Ritz, but it has a vaguely cozy charm of its
own.
11:23 p.m. Right on time, the train pulls
out of the station. 1 head to the bathroom.
After several attempts to balance myself
against the edge of the sink. I position myself
in such a way that I can see the mirror well
enough to remove my contacts. When 1 fin
ish. I notice that the edge of the sink left
large wet splotches on my t-shirt where I had
leaned against it for support.
11:42 p.m. I return to my compartment.
The elderly couple and random woman with
whom my friend and I are fated to spend the

night have all hopped into bed. I have the
distinct feeling that they are waiting for me
to turn off the light and do the same. Con
sidering the fact that I cannot sit up far
enough in my couchette to comfortably read
a book, I remove my discman from my bag,
figuring with a little bit of music, I'll be
asleep in a mater of minutes.
12:36 a m. I lie in my bunk turning over
and over again, trying to find a comfortable
position. I lie poor excuse for a mattress on
which I am sleeping is making my back ache.
The man above me is snoring, the woman
below me is thrashing. I look over to my
traveling companion, but she appears to be
asleep. I am already tired of U2's Joshua
Tree and wish that 1 had followed my
instincts and put in Paul Simon instead. As
my bag is totally unreachable. I resolve to try
my best to enjoy Bono.
1:34 a.m. I realize that the compartment
is growing increasingly warm. I remove the
blanket wrapped around me and doze off.

2:0(i a.m. I wake up sweating like cra/y.
Evidently, the woman assigned to the lumk
beneath mine is also frustrated with the tem
perature. I listen to her yell at the conductor
in the hall. In fact, 1 hear several sets of
angry voices, but the temperature remains
abnormally and comfortably high.
2:43 a.m. I'he batteries in my discman die.
1 open the window and then attempt sleep.
2:47 a.m. Someone closes the window.
2:51 a.m. I open the window again.
3:53 a.m. I wake up. I his time 1 am freez
ing. Apparently, one of the angry voices
succeeded in convincing the train crew that
the train was unpleasantly warm, lo solve
the little heating problem, someone had
decided to eliminate the heat all together. I
close the window and then take the sweat
shirt that I have been using as a pillow and
put it on.
4:37 a.m. I decide that there is nothing
even remotely romantic about night trains. 1
can't even see the window from mv perch.

Still slm cring, 1 switch on the little light next
to my bed and Hip the batteries in my disc
man around, hoping to eke out a lew more
minutes.
a.m. My discman dies for good.
(t:l4 a.m. I he conductor comes into our
compartment. I le announces that we will be
arriving in a I rankfurt in a lew minutes. We
are supposed to change trains there.
7:.?<S' a.m. I am settled on another train,
this lime headed toward Paris. I arrange my
things and change the batteries in my disc
man. I retrieve a Paul Simon CD from my
bag. Mright light streams in through the win
dows. I am stuck in an upright position. I
lean up against the window and listen to
Paul. Within minutes, I am drifting off to a
blissful slumber.
So much loi night trains.
