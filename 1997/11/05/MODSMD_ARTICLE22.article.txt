Morphogenesis of organs under scientific scrutiny

The next time you take a deep breath of cool, crisp
air and wonder at the power of your lungs, be assured
that Prof. Mark Krasnow of the Department of Bio
chemistry is wondering about your lungs too. Kras
now's research will eventually unveil how genes con
trol the morphogenesis of organs. His work is meant
to discover the basic causes of the growth, adaptation

and restructuring of organs.
For example, the human lung is constantly developing millions of
branches, the tracheal system, that provide surfaces for oxygen
exchange. Krasnow works with related organs in fruit Hies for the pur
pose of understanding these respiratory systems. Currently, he is study
ing the gene and gene byproducts that control the development of the
tracheal system.
The tracheal system develops by "branching out." Initially, it begins
with 20 amorphous sacs of cells. Soon, the cells migrate away from their
starting positions and much like a "finger extending from a glove." the
cells form primary branches of a tubular structure. The process contin
ues until a network (if thousands of branches is completed.
Krasnow wants to find the causes and criteria for cell migration and
the formation of tubular structures. In particular. Krasnow has worked
with a fibroblast growth factor. This growth factor directs the orienta
tion of the tubes as well as the extent to which the tubes extend.
Other research directions include the regulation of the growth factor
gene and crossover studies to human cells. In preliminary crossover
studies, Krasnow has discovered that fruit Hies and humans may have
related respiratory structures that would be conducive to the adaptation
of his work.

Group prospects for geological facts in Asia

Remember when you pretended to go prospecting
in search of gold and other valuable minerals as a
small child? John Liou, a professor of geology in the
School of Earth Sciences, is digging for rocks on a
much grander scale. Liou is working with a team of
researchers in the wildernesses of China and northern
Kazakhstan in an effort to better understand conti
nental collision.

Essentially, the theory of continental collision states that continents
were formed from collisions of several smaller land masses. In conjunc
tion with the Chinese government and a team of Chinese researchers
and armed with this theory, the team of earth scientists is working on a
project to drill a five km deep hole. The scientists are studying various
rocks and minerals as well as geochemistry. In China, they are studying
a relatively young continent of 250 million years.
I"he team of faculty members and graduate students has discovered
substantial liquidization of rock material beneath the earth. Further
more, they have unearthed diamonds and choesite, a silicon compound
also found in meteorite impacts, which are both substances formed
under extremely high pressure and high temperature in the range of S(X)
Centigrade. These substances first appeared at 1(X) km below the earth's
surface, relatively deep in the crust of the mantle. Iliis fundamental evi
dence substantiates the theory of continental collision while adding
detail to existing knowledge of the earth's formation and characteristics.
This research may also further the understanding of volcanic activity.
Unlike areas such as Alaska where similar subduction of the earth's
plates has occurred, China is volcanically inactive.
