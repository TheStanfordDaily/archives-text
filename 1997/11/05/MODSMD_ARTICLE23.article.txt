# Geologists explore Mesozoic Asia

Jurassic Park still exists for Stan
ford graduate student Todd
Greene. Greene studies the geology
of the Mesozoic era, which spans
the part of the Jurassic period from
250 million years ago up to 66 mil
lion years ago. During this time,
dinosaurs roamed the continents.
But other dynamic events were also
taking place. Microcontinents were
drifting about on the earth's sur
face, crashing into each other and
sliding under each other to form
larger continents.
For 12 years, the Stanford-Asia
Geosciences project has focused on
how geological events during this
period have helped to shape the
Asian continent as we know it
today.
About 24 people have participat
ed in the project. Recently, Greene,
along with graduate students Laura
Webb. Cari Johnson and Brad Kitts
and Geology Prof. Stephan Gra
ham, summarized the cumulative
findings of the project in a poster
presented at the Geological Society
of America meeting in Salt Lake
City.
At the end of the Paleozoic era,
the southern border of Asia lay just
south of present-day Mongolia, but
early in the Mesozoic era, as chunk
after chunk of the earth's crust
smashed into this land mass, much
of present-day China, Tibet and
Southeast Asia were added.
"We know that Southern China
slid under, or subducted, under
Northern China," Greene said,
"because exhumed rocks (rocks
which have risen back up to the sur
face) show signs of being buried as
far as 1(H) km below the surface."
These rocks contain microdia
monds, evidence of the depth to
which they were buried.
The tectonic pushing in Mongo
lia and eastern China created by
these collisions and subduetions
created a lot of compression. This
was followed by an era of relaxation
or extension, much like what hap
pened in the United States in Utah
and Nevada.
The result was a basin and range
geography that is similar to parts of
western North America. In North
west China, the basins filled with
sediment from the swamps and
lakes of the humid Jurassic era to
form the coal and oil fields of today.
Although there are no currently
active volcanoes in any of the eight

areas studied so far, there is evi
dence that they did exist, especially
in northeastern Russia.
Early in the era, an arc of island
volcanoes stretched from present
day southern China to the Bering
Straits.
Later, "Andean" volcanoes, sim
ilar to those on the west coast of
South America, formed on the

mainland.
The volcanic cones have long
since eroded away, but their lava,
ash, and pyroclastic deposits
remain, "'litis is frontier geology,"
said C Ireene. "What we are trying to
do is document the major geologic
events that shaped this continent."
I Tie project is unique in that "very
lew western geologists have been to

this area before," lie added.
Although Chinese, Mongolian
and Russian scientists have studied
some of the same areas, they have
published their results in their own
languages in their own journals, and
the areas have been restricted to
foreigners. "A lot of us are seeing

and interpreting these rocks, and
publishing our findings outside of
China for the first time," he said.
Graduate students in the Stan
ford in Asia project spend from six
weeks to three months at a time in
Asia. Greene has been to North
west China twice to study the sedi
ments in the basins. He said he is in
terested in basin history and how it
is affected by the mountain ranges
that surround it.
Not surprisingly, a few students
have had unexpected adventures.
Along the Mongolian / Chinese
border, students work next to tow
ers manned by guards armed with
machine guns. One student travels
alone, largely by boat, to areas
along the north coast of Russia,
where he meets with Russian col
laborators. Others have been hunt
ed by wild dogs, or subjected to
house arrest for not having the cor
rect papers to be in a particular
area. "But for the most part," said
Green, "we have had good luck,
good collaboration and good hosts.
We have a lot of cooperation, with
contacts set up before hand to make
sure things go as smoothly as possi
ble. Groups from other universities
have found out that things can go
wrong very quickly."
However, not all surprises were
unpleasant. Dinosaurs were ram
pant during the era being studied,
and it is not unusual to discover di
nosaur bones. In Mongolia, one
group stumbled upon what turned
out to be the oldest Sauropod bones
ever found in Mongolia. That dis
covery implied that some sort of
land bridge existed, even then, be
tween Asia and North America.
The GS A poster is based on nine
dissertations and 150 publications
by Stanford authors, and it assem
bles their findings together for the
first time. "This is the initial step,"
said Greene, "toward our goal of
putting together a book which will
incorporate all of the Stanford
based geologv throughout Asia."
