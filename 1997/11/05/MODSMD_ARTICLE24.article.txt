# Steven Chu explains lasers and life:
## A
						look at Stanford's new Nobel physicist 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
In 1985, Steven Chu developed a
method of using lasers to cool atoms,
slowing them to a speed at which they can
easily be studied.
He had no idea, however, how far
reaching the applications would be of the
work that won the Stanford physics and
applied physics professor this year's Nobel
Prize. Chu shared the prize with William
Phillips of the National Institution of
Standards and Technology in Maryland
and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of the Col
lege de France.
During the past 12 years, Chu. his stu
dents at Stanford and others around the
world have been developing applications
of laser cooling that range from physics to
biology.

Physics and Applied Physics Prof. Steven Chu's talent as a teacher has been
compared to that of Richard Feynman. The two met about 10 years ago.
