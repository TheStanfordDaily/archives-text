# Exploring laser cooling

The work stemming from Physics and
Applied Physics Prof. Steven Chu's
research on laser cooling of atoms has
grown tremendously in the past decade.
Several projects currently in progress at
Stanford are using the technique to
explore atomic structure more closely
Chu's outside interests range even fur
ther â€” from sports to crossword puzzles
to University governance.
Chi. comes from a family of scientists,
most of whom studied physics at one point
or another although he is the only one still
doing it. Mis brother is a professor at the

everyday workings of soeiety.
Chu's Nobel Prize-winning technique
employs several lasers and a magnetic
field, which work together to cool atoms
to a few millionths of a degree above
absolute zero, or minus 273 degrees Cel
sius. Absolute zero is the temperature at
which all motion stops, so a supercooled

A high school professor originally
turned him on to physics by allowing him
to create and carry out his own experi
ments. Chu said. He still likes the thrill of
having an idea, making a mathematical
model of it. developing predictions and
testing it.
Chu earned a bachelor's from the Uni
versity of Rochester in IV70 and a doctor
ate from I J(-Berkeley in l ( >76. Before
coming to Stanford, he worked at AI&1
Bell Laboratories in New Jersey.
At Rochester, it was obvious that Chu
was a talented physicist, said his room
mate from the time, Elliot Richman, who
was working on a chemistry degree. In
fact, he once made a bet with two other
friends about who would be first to win a
Nobel Prize.
" I hey had it on their minds even then,
and Steve won the bet," said Richman.

his bedroom walls during high school and
is delighted now to know one.
