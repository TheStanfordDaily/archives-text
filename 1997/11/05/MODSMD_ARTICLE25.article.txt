Applied Physics Prof. Steven Chu's
research on laser cooling of atoms has
grown tremendously in the past decade.
Several projects currently in progress at
Stanford are using the technique to
explore atomic structure more closely

A high school professor originally
turned him on to physics by allowing him
to create and carry out his own experi
ments. Chu said. He still likes the thrill of
having an idea, making a mathematical
model of it. developing predictions and
testing it.
Chu earned a bachelor's from the Uni
versity of Rochester in IV70 and a doctor
ate from I J(-Berkeley in l ( >76. Before
coming to Stanford, he worked at AI&1
Bell Laboratories in New Jersey.
At Rochester, it was obvious that Chu
was a talented physicist, said his room
mate from the time, Elliot Richman, who
was working on a chemistry degree. In
fact, he once made a bet with two other
friends about who would be first to win a
Nobel Prize.
" I hey had it on their minds even then,
and Steve won the bet," said Richman.

atom is barely moving and can be
studied under a microscope.
( hu said some applications, such
as a more precise atomic clock, were
fairly obvious.
"I knew that it could be used for
precision measurements," he said.
"Hui I didn't see applications in biol
ogy, polymers or high-energy
physics.... Neither did anyone else."
In fact, theoretical papers
explaining the phenomenon Chu
demonstrated had been published
several years before he did his work.
No one realized how quickly work
with laser cooling would progress
once it had been tried.
"It turned out to be easy," Chu
said. "People have been talking
about it for 20 years, but it was not in
the mainstream."
"Once it worked, it worked well
and it worked easily, he said.... It
could have been done 10 or 20 years
earlier; it's just that people didn't
realize it."
Perhaps the application with the
broadest range of uses is an "atomic
fountain," in which cooled atoms are
shot upward, then drawn back due to
gravity. At the top of the fountain,
the atom stops momentarily. Infor
mation provided at the stopping
point allows the development of a
moie accurate atomic clock, used in
everything fiom the (ilobal Position
ing Satellite System to fiberoptic
telephone lines.
Atomic clocks count the number

of cycles at atom makes between
cycles. The length of a second origi
nally was determined as being a frac
tion of the length of a solar year, but
when scientists became able to com
pare that to the cycles of a cesium
atom, they found time could be mea
sured even more accurately by
counting the cycles.
Chu's atomic fountain makes yet
more accuracy possible by allowing
researchers to learn more about an
atom's inner structure as it sits sus
pended at the top of the fountain.
When the atom is at the fountain's
peak, researchers beam a microwave
at it at a precise frequency. The more
precise that frequency, the more pre
cise the information provided about
the atomic structure.
If atoms are moving quickly, the
frequency can be less precise
because the beam will be absorbed
by some atoms, although not all.
Supercooled atoms require more
precision, or else none will absorb
the microwave.
Using this method. Chu's foun
tain has allowed an atomic clock that
is accurate to one second in 3 billion
years; before that, scientists could
assure accuracy only to one second
in 32 million years. The development
of the new standard also is notable
because it took only two years, Chu
said. Developing the previous stan
dard took 4() years of work.
One of the most obvious effects
of more accurate clocks will be bet
ter coordination of fiberoptic tele
phone lines. 1 housands of calls con
verge to travel through one line, and
a precise synchronization is neces
sarv to sort them out at the end.

Each satellite in the Global Posi
tioning Satellite System also includes
several atomic clocks. The satellites
allow someone on Earth to find his
location within a meter.
An important use of the satellites
is to measure the heights of the
oceans, particularly, Chu said, to
convince governments of the effects
of global warming.
"A sign of global warming is that
the average height of the oceans will
rise," he said. "A slight change in the
temperature could introduce big
changes," such as altering the path of
the Gulf Stream — which could leave
all of northern Europe frozen or cre
ate more severe El Nino effects.
Drought in some parts of the globe
and fUx>ding in others could result.
In biology, the technique that
slows atoms at extremely low tem
peratures can be used to slow
molecules at room temperature.
Once the molecules are slowed,
researchers can attach plastic
spheres only a micron in diameter to
either end. "Optical tweezers" are
used to hold onto the spheres.
When the molecule is decorated
with fluorescent dye, it can be seen
as a researcher controls it under a
microscope with a laser beam.
The technique should help scien
tists understand significantly more
about how polymers work, Chu said.
Other projects are improving the
precision of measurements of accel
eration due to gravity, which is useful
in finding oil-bearing rock among
other things, measuring the fine
structure constant and testing funda
mental symmetries.

Richman said he sometimes
would question Chu about physics
"just to hear his profound explana
tions. which were so aesthetically
pleasing."
When buying groceries during
college, Chu sometimes would ask
Richman how he though some
device used in the supermarket
worked.
"I would say something obvious,
the best I could do," Richman
recalled. "And he would say, 'No,
no. I mean fundamentally.' And he
would go on at some incredibly
deeper level about the physical
reality of whatever it was and the
fundamental operation of the phys
ical w0r1d.... It was really quite
thrilling to see how his brain
worked."
Students at Stanford have
noticed the same infectious enthu
siasm in Chu, who said his move
from Hell Labs to Stanford was
largely motivated by his strong
desire to teach as well as do

research.
Working with nine doctoral stu
dents. two postdoctoral fellows and
an undergraduate, Chu encourages
creativity and independence.
Doctoral student Cheng C'hin.
who is working on a technique
called Raman-Sidebrand cooling,
said he decided to join Chu's group
after being "attracted by his strong
physics intuition and keen sense of
many discoveries."
Richman called Chu's talent at
explaining physical phenomena
"positively Feynman-esque."
Chu and Richard Feynman met
about 10 years ago before Feynman
died, and the great physicist and
teacher took a liking to the young
researcher. Richman said.
"Steve was very proud of being
liked by Feynman," Richman said.
"I suppose in my experience there
are very few people who can
explain things, in terms of physical
reality, as well as Steve. Feynman of
course is the exemplar."
At Stanford, Chu has gone
beyond his commitments to teach
ing and research by serving on a

number of committees, including
the search committee that chose
University President Gerhard
Casper.
Outside the office, Chu enjoys
tennis, bicycling, swimming, cook
ing and the New York limes cross
word puzzles. Since the Nobel Prize
was announced Oct. 15. however, it
hasn't been easy to squeeze those
in.
"It's been absolutely crazy," ('hu
said. "I'm hoping that after a month
or so this will die awav."
Chinese communities have been
especially excited about the prize,
Chu said.
"Maybe it's because they value
scholarship," he speculated.
"Maybe it's because they don't
have rock stars. They've shown a
lot of interest."
That interest extended to a
meeting with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin last Sunday as the
leader completed his historic visit to
the United States.
Chu will travel to Sweden in
December to receive his award and
tiive a lecture.

An important use of the satellites
is to measure the heights of the
oceans, particularly, Chu said, to
convince governments of the effects
of global warming.
"A sign of global warming is that
the average height of the oceans will
rise," he said. "A slight change in the
temperature could introduce big
changes," such as altering the path of
the Gulf Stream — which could leave
all of northern Europe frozen or cre
ate more severe El Nino effects.

In biology, the technique that
slows atoms at extremely low tem
peratures can be used to slow
molecules at room temperature.
Once the molecules are slowed,
researchers can attach plastic
spheres only a micron in diameter to
either end. "Optical tweezers" are
used to hold onto the spheres.
When the molecule is decorated
with fluorescent dye, it can be seen
as a researcher controls it under a
microscope with a laser beam.
The technique should help scien
tists understand significantly more
about how polymers work, Chu said.
Other projects are improving the
precision of measurements of accel
eration due to gravity, which is useful
in finding oil-bearing rock among
other things, measuring the fine
structure constant and testing funda
mental symmetries.

Richman said he sometimes
would question Chu about physics
"just to hear his profound explana
tions. which were so aesthetically
pleasing."
When buying groceries during
college, Chu sometimes would ask
Richman how he though some
device used in the supermarket
worked.
"I would say something obvious,
the best I could do," Richman
recalled. "And he would say, 'No,
no. I mean fundamentally.' And he
would go on at some incredibly
deeper level about the physical
reality of whatever it was and the
fundamental operation of the phys
ical w0r1d.... It was really quite
thrilling to see how his brain
worked."
Students at Stanford have
noticed the same infectious enthu
siasm in Chu, who said his move
from Hell Labs to Stanford was
largely motivated by his strong
desire to teach as well as do

research.

said he decided to join Chu's group
after being "attracted by his strong
physics intuition and keen sense of
many discoveries."
Richman called Chu's talent at
explaining physical phenomena
"positively Feynman-esque."
Chu and Richard Feynman met
about 10 years ago before Feynman
died, and the great physicist and
teacher took a liking to the young
researcher. Richman said.
"Steve was very proud of being
liked by Feynman," Richman said.
"I suppose in my experience there
are very few people who can
explain things, in terms of physical
reality, as well as Steve. Feynman of
course is the exemplar."
At Stanford, Chu has gone
beyond his commitments to teach
ing and research by serving on a

number of committees, including
the search committee that chose
University President Gerhard

Chinese communities have been
especially excited about the prize,
Chu said.
"Maybe it's because they value
scholarship," he speculated.
"Maybe it's because they don't
have rock stars. They've shown a
lot of interest."
That interest extended to a

The work stemming from Physics and
Applied Physics Prof. Steven Chu's
research on laser cooling of atoms has
grown tremendously in the past decade.
Several projects currently in progress at
Stanford are using the technique to
explore atomic structure more closely
Chu's outside interests range even fur
ther — from sports to crossword puzzles
to University governance.

Chu's Nobel Prize-winning technique
employs several lasers and a magnetic

A high school professor originally
turned him on to physics by allowing him
to create and carry out his own experi
ments. Chu said. He still likes the thrill of
having an idea, making a mathematical
model of it. developing predictions and
testing it.
Chu earned a bachelor's from the Uni
versity of Rochester in IV70 and a doctor
ate from I J(-Berkeley in l ( >76. Before
coming to Stanford, he worked at AI&1
Bell Laboratories in New Jersey.
At Rochester, it was obvious that Chu
was a talented physicist, said his room
mate from the time, Elliot Richman, who
was working on a chemistry degree. In
fact, he once made a bet with two other
friends about who would be first to win a
Nobel Prize.
" I hey had it on their minds even then,
and Steve won the bet," said Richman.

atom is barely moving and can be
studied under a microscope.
( hu said some applications, such
as a more precise atomic clock, were
fairly obvious.
"I knew that it could be used for
precision measurements," he said.
"Hui I didn't see applications in biol
ogy, polymers or high-energy
physics.... Neither did anyone else."
In fact, theoretical papers
explaining the phenomenon Chu
demonstrated had been published
several years before he did his work.
No one realized how quickly work
with laser cooling would progress
once it had been tried.
"It turned out to be easy," Chu
said. "People have been talking
about it for 20 years, but it was not in
the mainstream."
"Once it worked, it worked well
and it worked easily, he said.... It
could have been done 10 or 20 years
earlier; it's just that people didn't
realize it."
Perhaps the application with the
broadest range of uses is an "atomic
fountain," in which cooled atoms are
shot upward, then drawn back due to
gravity. At the top of the fountain,
the atom stops momentarily. Infor
mation provided at the stopping
point allows the development of a
moie accurate atomic clock, used in
everything fiom the (ilobal Position
ing Satellite System to fiberoptic
telephone lines.
Atomic clocks count the number

of cycles at atom makes between
cycles. The length of a second origi
nally was determined as being a frac
tion of the length of a solar year, but
when scientists became able to com
pare that to the cycles of a cesium
atom, they found time could be mea
sured even more accurately by
counting the cycles.
Chu's atomic fountain makes yet
more accuracy possible by allowing
researchers to learn more about an
atom's inner structure as it sits sus
pended at the top of the fountain.
When the atom is at the fountain's
peak, researchers beam a microwave
at it at a precise frequency. The more
precise that frequency, the more pre
cise the information provided about
the atomic structure.
If atoms are moving quickly, the
frequency can be less precise
because the beam will be absorbed
by some atoms, although not all.
Supercooled atoms require more
precision, or else none will absorb
the microwave.
Using this method. Chu's foun
tain has allowed an atomic clock that
is accurate to one second in 3 billion
years; before that, scientists could
assure accuracy only to one second
in 32 million years. The development
of the new standard also is notable
because it took only two years, Chu
said. Developing the previous stan
dard took 4() years of work.
One of the most obvious effects
of more accurate clocks will be bet
ter coordination of fiberoptic tele
phone lines. 1 housands of calls con
verge to travel through one line, and
a precise synchronization is neces
sarv to sort them out at the end.

Each satellite in the Global Posi
tioning Satellite System also includes
several atomic clocks. The satellites
allow someone on Earth to find his
location within a meter.
An important use of the satellites
is to measure the heights of the
oceans, particularly, Chu said, to
convince governments of the effects
of global warming.
"A sign of global warming is that
