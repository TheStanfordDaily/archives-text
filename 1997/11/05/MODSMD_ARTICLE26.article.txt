el)ear Tom,
I hen to differ with the various
niitrilion experts around when they
claim that "trash dieting" doesn't
work. I have recently spent the past 3 weeks
restricting my food intake by using shake
supplements, and indeed, I've lost weight.
They do work! Wouldn't you agree?

A Maria,
I can't debate with you that
you've lost weight. What I can't he
sure of, however, is what kind ol
weight you lost. What do I mean? Well,
there is a good possibility that much ol the
weight that vou lost (interpreted by your
scale) consisted mostly ol water and muscle.
When we subject our bodies and theii
metabolic pathways to a type til "starvation
mode"' as suggested by a so called crash diet,
our body initially responds hy burning mus
cle tissue for fuel. When the muscle needs
A l l' to contract, it will look for the most
readily available and abundant energy
source to meet its metabolic need. The near
est energy source in this case happens to be
other muscle tissue that exists in close prox
imity to the cell in need of A 11'
So, in the initial stages ol starvation
mode, the body loses a small amount ol mus
cle mass. Unfortunately, this loss ol muscle
mass causes a reduction in the overall Rest
ing Metabolic Rate. I hus, the normal every
day caloric expenditure ol the hodv is
reduced, further adversely affecting the
body's l.nergy Balance Equation: l.nergy
Intake = l.nergy Expired - l .nergy Stored.

F urthermore, it is also important to
explain why much of the initial weight loss in
a crash diet program consists ol water. ( er
tain hormones called glucocorticoids stimu
late the breakdown ol muscle tissue. When
these hormones stimulate catabolic action
on the muscles, Tmethyl histidine is released
into the bloodstream. This amino acid is
imbedded in the contractile proteins of mus
cle. I Jnfortunately,once muscle tissue is bro
ken down and .Vmethyl histidine is released,
this substance is not capable of being reuti
li/.ed in protein synthesis and must be excret
ed by the hotly via the urine. Thus, the mus
cle tissue breakdown and weight loss com
plement further weight reduction in the
form of water excretion through urine.
Very little fat is metabolized in this pro
cess. Remember, weight loss in not necessar
ily fat loss. The best way that we can burn
the fat and keep the muscle is to eat propei
ly and participate in long, slow, distance
types of exercise such as running, brisk walk
ing, swimming, etc. I guarantee that you'll
see a change in youi body composition and
not just a change in where the dial on your
scale falls.
