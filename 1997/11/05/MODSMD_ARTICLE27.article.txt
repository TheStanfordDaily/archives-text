## McNamee finds stardom at the end of long road 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
When Paula McNamee moved from
San Diego to Wheaton, Mil., after her
sophomore year ol high school, she knew
slic wasn t headed lor a rnecca of women's
volleyball.
Alter two years of playing high school
and club ball on the West Coast. Sidwell
Friends School and the Washington, 1
area just didn't offer the same level of
plav.
Nonetheless, the senior middle blocker
continued to work on her game, playing
basketball and track in addition to volley
ball. McNamee knew her competition
wasn't on par with the West C 'oast but was
determined to return and pursue a colle
giate career at Stanford.
"I only applied here." McNamee said.
"I knew I was going to get in here for one
sport or the other. Somehow I was going
to get to Stanford."
McNamee h,»s played not one, but two
pO' >r t rdinal. Aft . lour sc;isi ••
«>l \oik\bail (v.iieasa redshirt). McNamee
joined the women's basketball squad last
year and even phved an instrumental role
m a three-point win at ()regon.
McNamee s athletic talent is evident in
her ability to play both sports, but upon
arri\ ing .is a freshman, one of her biggest
challenges was catching up to her volley
ball peers and cultivating the skills she
hadn't gotten at Sidwell.
"I just wasn't exposed to that level on

the day-to-day basis that they were on the
West Coast." McNamee said. "So coming
out 1 just was behind in experience and ex
posure. That put me at a disadvantage."
I lead coach Don Shaw agreed that Me-
Namee's background was limited in com
parison to other athletes, but he was will
ing to take a chance on a player of her ath
letic ability. As a result, McNamee spent
her first year on the Farm as a redshirt,
gaining valuable experience and learning
more about the game.
"If you could've seen her recruiting
tape," Shaw said with a laugh. "She played
in a private school league. She was pri
marily a basketball player who happened
to play volleyball. She had zero volleyball
skills, just really raw talent.
"We don't usually redshirt people. Hut
we knew from a skills standpoint, she was
behind as a freshman. She showed an in
terest in playing volleyball, and when you
have that, you have to take a chance. She
had that kind of ability, and il was defi
nitely worth the lr\
I he gamble paid off, and McNamee
has turned into a key player for the third
ranked Cardinal. Hut the transformation
into a starting middle blocker didn't hap
pen overnight. McNamee worked four
long years to get to (his position.
Shaw said she is one of the hardest
working players lie's ever had.
"I respect and admire her dedication
and her work ethic," said senior co-cap
tain Kristin 1 olkl. "From day one she
knew that she wanted to play here and

make a difference, and she's kept at it.
"At times its been a rocky road, but
that's the trait of a strong person the\
don't give up when the situation gets
tough. She's kind of had an unusual run of
things, but it just shows her true personal
itv."
McNamec'sgi it has finally paid oil tins
season. After a successful sophomore
campaign in IWS. she expected to con
tend for a starting spot as a junior. Hut a
shoulder injury suffered during the pre
season set her back again, and McNamee
had to wait yet another year for her op
portunity.
Hut listening to her now. von get the
idea that the disappointment ol that set
back and the hard work of hei previous
four years are just making her scnioi se.i
son that much sweeter.
"I've definitely been looking forward to
this point of being able to have a starling
position," McNamee said. " I hat w as w hat
I was working for. I knew coming in here I
wasn't going to have a starling position.
"It's been very special. I'm just very
glad that I'm playing because I've worked
so hard to get here, and it would be vcr\
disappointing not to be able to come out
my last year and have an impact on the
court."
