won the game for Stanford with a
35-yard field goal with eight sec
onds remaining. The field goal
was set up hv a final-minute John
Elway-led drive.
Stanford stood at fourth-and
-17 from their own 13-yard line
with 5N seconds remaining.
Elway stood in his pocket that
gave him all the time he needed
to hit Emile Harry with a 29-yard
bullet upficld.
The drive eventually led to
Harmon's dramatic field goal
and the Stanford bench piled
onto the field, causing a 15-yard
unsportsmanlike conduct penal

ty.
I larmon then kicked off from
the Stanford 25-yard line to set in
motion one ol the most bizarre
episodes to ever occur on ;m
American football field.
Harmon's squib kick was
fielded by Moen at the Cal 43-
vard line. Moen was immediately
covered and he pitched back to
Richard Rodgers near midfield.
Rodgers. who also found
nowhere to run.was hit but lat
eraled to Dwight Garner. Gar
ner was swarmed by Stanford de
fenders and driven backwards.
Two players charged onto the
field from Stanford's bench to
celebrate and were followed by
the Stanford band. Penalty Hags
flew as the field was flooded with
scrambling people.
Suddenly the ball squirted
from Garner's arms back to
Rodgers.
'I swear, my knee never hit
the ground," (iarner said. "I was
just about to fall, and then I saw
Rodgers. I remember him saying
in the huddle. 'Don't fall with the
ball."'
Rodgers rambled upficld to
ward the Stanford band and the
bath of confusion at that end of
the field before pitching the ball
to Mariet Ford who headed for
the right sideline.
Ford raced to the 20-yard line
when lie blindly ipped the ball

'We knev had t< ki. j» the
ball alive.' said Moen. who along
with Rodgers. was a veer quar
terback in high school. "I saw
maybe one white jersey and just
tucked the ball away. I wasn't
going to stop lor the band. I was
gonna score."
I here were so many people
on the field I didn't see any Stan
lord players." Rodgers said. "I
don't think they knew what was
going on. "
I he officials huddled on the
lield and moments later signaled
touchdown.
Stanford players argued that
an official had called the play
