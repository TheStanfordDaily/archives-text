Berkeley, Calif. — California
captured the <Ssth and best Big
Game Saturday with a chaotic
and controversial 57-yard kick
off return that never could have

Cal used
five laterals
on the re

defensive

Mocn took
the blind
final pitch

and crashed 25 yards through the
Stanford hand and into the end

won the game for Stanford with a
35-yard field goal with eight sec
onds remaining. The field goal
was set up hv a final-minute John
Elway-led drive.
Stanford stood at fourth-and
-17 from their own 13-yard line
with 5N seconds remaining.
Elway stood in his pocket that
gave him all the time he needed
to hit Emile Harry with a 29-yard
bullet upficld.
The drive eventually led to
Harmon's dramatic field goal
and the Stanford bench piled
onto the field, causing a 15-yard
unsportsmanlike conduct penal

ty.
I larmon then kicked off from
the Stanford 25-yard line to set in
motion one ol the most bizarre
episodes to ever occur on ;m
American football field.
Harmon's squib kick was
fielded by Moen at the Cal 43-
vard line. Moen was immediately
covered and he pitched back to
Richard Rodgers near midfield.
Rodgers. who also found
nowhere to run.was hit but lat
eraled to Dwight Garner. Gar
ner was swarmed by Stanford de
fenders and driven backwards.
Two players charged onto the
field from Stanford's bench to
celebrate and were followed by
the Stanford band. Penalty Hags
flew as the field was flooded with
scrambling people.
Suddenly the ball squirted
from Garner's arms back to
Rodgers.
'I swear, my knee never hit
the ground," (iarner said. "I was
just about to fall, and then I saw
Rodgers. I remember him saying
in the huddle. 'Don't fall with the
ball."'
Rodgers rambled upficld to
ward the Stanford band and the
bath of confusion at that end of
the field before pitching the ball
to Mariet Ford who headed for
the right sideline.
Ford raced to the 20-yard line

'We knev had t< ki. j» the
ball alive.' said Moen. who along
with Rodgers. was a veer quar
terback in high school. "I saw
maybe one white jersey and just
tucked the ball away. I wasn't
going to stop lor the band. I was
gonna score."
I here were so many people
on the field I didn't see any Stan
lord players." Rodgers said. "I
don't think they knew what was
going on. "
I he officials huddled on the
lield and moments later signaled
touchdown.
Stanford players argued that
an official had called the play

dead at midfield.
"I saw one official do this imply
ing he was down." said noseguard
Terry Jackson, moving his arms
back-and-forth like a baseball um
pire signaling safe. "Then 1 saw this
guy running with the ball. 1 didn't
know what the hell was going on."
"They robbed us of our victory. I
have been involved with some wild
things in high school games, but this
outdoes them all. It's hard for me to
take. 1 would feel better if they
would have beaten our kickoff team
fair-and-square, not this Mickey
Mouse stuff."
Referee Charles Moffett. in a
taped response to reporters' ques
tions, said, "We checked that. No
body thought he was down at any

time.
Moffett also explained that the
penalty flags were thrown because
of the Stanfoiu players on the field
and that they could have penalized
the Stanford band also.
"All 1 heard from the referee was
that as soon as Kevin (Moen)
touched a band member, it was a
touchdown." said Cal tight end
David Lewis.
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin was
vehement after the game.
"1 feel it was grossly unfair." Wig
gin said. "1 feel the last play was ille
gal. We saw it on the sidelines as
dead. The guy (Moen) never would
have scored if we didn't think the
play was dead. This is the biggest fi
asco of all time. I think it's tragic that
a California-Stanford game comes
down to this."
Ciordy Ceresino, former Cardi
nal linebacker and now a television

commentator, said. "The third man
((iarner) was stopped. He was strug
gling forward and then pushed back
to stop his momentum. Both knees
hit the ground before the ball came
out.
"On the replays it's fairly clear. 1
saw it 25 times. The question wasn't
really so much whether his knee
touched, although it looked like they
did. but his lack of momentum. He
was stopped."
Stanford athletic director Andy
(leiger said, "1 don't know of any
mechanism (to appeal the
game)...."
Stanford would have received a
bid to pla\ in the 1 lall-of-Faine Howl
in Birmingham, Ala. New Year's

"The gentleman (from the Hall

and that they could have penalized
the Stanford band also.
"All 1 heard from the referee was
that as soon as Kevin (Moen)
touched a band member, it was a
touchdown." said Cal tight end
David Lewis.
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin was
vehement after the game.
"1 feel it was grossly unfair." Wig
gin said. "1 feel the last play was ille
gal. We saw it on the sidelines as
dead. The guy (Moen) never would
have scored if we didn't think the
play was dead. This is the biggest fi
asco of all time. I think it's tragic that
a California-Stanford game comes
down to this."
Ciordy Ceresino, former Cardi
nal linebacker and now a television

commentator, said. "The third man
((iarner) was stopped. He was strug
gling forward and then pushed back
to stop his momentum. Both knees
hit the ground before the ball came
out.
"On the replays it's fairly clear. 1
saw it 25 times. The question wasn't
really so much whether his knee
touched, although it looked like they
did. but his lack of momentum. He
was stopped."
Stanford athletic director Andy
(leiger said, "1 don't know of any
mechanism (to appeal the
game)...."
Stanford would have received a
bid to pla\ in the 1 lall-of-Faine Howl
in Birmingham, Ala. New Year's
I 've day. had they won the game.
"The gentleman (from the Hall
of-Fame Bowl) said goodbye,"
(ieiger said."()bviously he was hop
ing we would win. 1 le was very nice."
