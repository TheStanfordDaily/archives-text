## Midfielder returns from U.S. team, lands NorPac Co-Player of the Year honors 
### Dave Shuman 
While most of the Stanford field
hockey team was on campus in late
August preparing for the upcom
ing season, junior captain Justina
Williams was attending to other
commitments.
It was hard for her Cardinal
teammates to blame her. Williams,
along with teammates Sarah
Medeiros and Carey Cloyd, were
on the other side of the world play
ing for the U S. Junior World ( up
Team.
After p';u »i' ing for a week in
July and it.in August, the na
tional icam picked up and Hew to
Korea for a week-long competition
against some of the best field hock
ey players in the world.
"Those girls grew up with sticks
in their hands," Williams said.
"The field hockey was much faster
paced than the collegiate game. My
goal was to bring back that pace."
When she returned to the Car
dinal three weeks into the season,
Williams quickly adjusted to her
new teammates and instilled that
sense of hard work and fast pace
into the team's play.
Senior co-captain Paige Mader
said Williams had no problem join
ing the squad late.
"The freshmen immediately

looked at her as tlieii captain."
Mader said.
Coach Sheryl Johnson echoed
Mader's characterization <>l the
center midfielder as a dedicated
player.
Williams "alwavs nivrs 100%
effort, even I' th I t sri n< <»t n<
game." .!< >l
W lll.mis has helped lead ilic
('ardinal toan 11 -6 record this year
10-3 since her return with
only three games remaining. While
there's no chance of qualifying for
the 12-team NCAA tournament.
Stanford can claim the Northern
Pacific Athletic ( (inference cham
pionship by beating ( alifornia I ri
day.
Known for her quick stick and
creative passes. Williams controls
the ( ardinal midfield. She also fills
the extremely important role of
passing the ball from the penalty
corners to set up shooters on top.
"I get a lot of satisfaction out of
faking someone out and giving a
good pass that leads to a goal."
Williams said.

It's |list that style ol play that
makes Williams and her Uam
mates so excited about the art ilicial
turf field something they've
been requesting lot yeats being
installed next yeat.
