# Woodward sees no let-up in denials

### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
A policy of official denial per
vades today's political scene, Wash
ington Post editor Bob Woodward
told a packed Kresge Auditorium
last night.

Twenty-five years after the Wa
tergate scandal, officials are denying
any wrongdoing in much the same
manner as President Nixon did, said
Woodward, who with Carl Hern
stein broke the story that led to
Nixon's resignation. 1 le now is assis
taut managing editor in charge of in

vestigations at the Washington Post
and author of several books.
His speech, sponsored by the
John S. Knight Fellowship program
for professional journalists, was a
mixture of memories of Watergate
and appraisals of both politicians
and the media in the scandal's after

math.
Watergate was unique in that it
offered two tilings most news inves
ligations don't: clarity and closure.
Woodward said. Tapes of Nixon's
conversations with advisers released
since his resignation gave a clear pic
ture of his guilt, and the president's
resignation allowed a closure.
"The scandals today following
Watergate tend to blur," Woodward
said. "There is not clarity. There is
not closure There is little agree
ment or consensus."
Although the Nixon tapes reveal
an "obsessed" and "ultimately in
competent" leader, other presidents
have activity to deny as well. Wood
ward said.
Clinton's denials of wrongdoing
related to campaign fund raising
have regularly been proven false, he
said. Had the president not prac
ticed official denial, he might even
have saved himself some grief.
Woodward added.
"Whitewater would have proba
bly gone away in the V2 campaign if
all the documents had been re

leased," he said. "Clearly official de
nial is alive and well in Washington.
What's scary is the mechanisms for
denial are much more sophisticated
than they were 25 years ago."
What was a lie or cover-up is now
called "spin," Woodward said — a
word that seems so benign that "the
public and the press have grown to
accept it."
But exploration of the "spin"
must be done responsibly, he added.
Watergate has become a myth, and
not many remember the long hours,
fighting and uncertainty surround
ing the newspaper's and reporters'
decisions.
The reality, Woodward said, is
"still what this business of journal
ism is about.... In journalism you
only find fragments."
Woodward encouraged journal
ists to dig deeper and look for prob
lems that may not be obvious.
The media, Woodward said,
should heed Washington Post
columnist Meg Greenfield's call to

"stop looking at the bizarre and
start looking at the seemingly nor
mal."
"The news has to probe institu
tions and look at large forces," he
said. "The key to reporting is under
standing."
The advent of CNN — and its
presence in newsrooms around the
country — has changed the way
journalists work. Woodward said.
"Everyone worries, Are we on
top of the news?'" he said. CNN
brings "the latest," but "first, it's
often just wrong, and second, the lat
est is often irrelevant," he said.
Taking time to be thorough will
help. Woodward said, but under
standing will remain limited unless
the pervasive policy of official denial
ends.
"Government now still depends
and thrives on secrecy," he said.
"The central reality, the biggest
stumbling block to delivering the
truth to the public, is the habit of of
ficial denial."
