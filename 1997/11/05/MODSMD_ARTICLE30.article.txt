# Coaching conflict hurts USC
## 
### Armen keuilian Special to the Daily 
LOS ANGELES — At the be
ginning of the season. USC offensive
coordinator Hue Jackson was quot
ed as saying there "won't be a play"
that won't go through head coach
John Robinson first.
But this season, there haven't
been many plays either coach has
wanted to take credit for, especially
in the Trojans' shutout loss to Wash
ington last Saturday.
Hired away from California last
season, Jackson has yet to live up to
his reputation as "a master of the
West Coast offense." And Robin
son's run-first philosophy has failed
to provide the consistency necessary
for the Trojans to rise above medioc
rity.
Last season. Jackson helped
mold the Golden Bears' passing
game into the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's best, averaging 321.5 yards
per game behind the arm of quarter
back Pat Barnes, who threw for a
conference-high 3,499 yards and 32

touchdowns.
Under coach Steve Mariucci,
Jackson was able to work with <i first
year. pass-minded coach in estab
lishing an offense that relied heavih
on the passing game.

When Mariucci left ( al, Jackson
came to USC in hopes of molding
another star quarterback, much like
he did with Barnes and Jake Plum
mer at Arizona State a year before.
But the only thing building up
around I !S( "s offense so fat is con
fusion and losses.
Hitting its apex during an on
camera confrontation during the
Arizona State t>anie, Robinson and

Jackson have not seen eye-to-eye
this season, probably stemming
from the coaches' conflicting offen
sive ideologies.
Robinson's offense is based on
"pushing the pile" and slowly mov
ing the ball upheld on the ground, a
theory that has won him a national
championship and four Rose Bowls.
But the West Coast offense has
never been Robinson's forte. By de
finition. the West Coast offense
makes the running game a sideshow.
One of the reasons I ISC hired
Jackson was to develop a young
quarterback, be it John Fox, Mike
Van Raaphorst or Ouinev Woods.
So far he hasn't even narrowed it
down as to which two quarterbacks
to use.
Jackson is right when he says the
"problem is with everyone," but
until somebody starts from square
one and decides which game plan to
use on offense, the problem will stick
at least until personnel ischanged.
