# Mountain bikers take first
## Men's lacrosse puts on impressive performance at Chico State; Horse polo, badminton easing into new season 
### Brian Eule Contributing writer 
Fifth-year senior Patty Ciesla is
used to winning and used to riding
with pain.
Having never lost a downhill
race, the mountain biker continued
her winning streak last Saturday at
the Stanford Wild Pigs Halloween
Downhill Race. With ailing knees,
Ciesla edged out Reno's Pip Martin
for first place in the women's A divi
sion, leading Stanford to a first-place
finish in the downhill event.
"Even if you're not hurting, the
burn is pretty painful," said Ciesla,
who raced earlier in her career with
pins embedded in her knees. "To be
injured on top of things makes it a
mental game to see how much you
can endure."
Ciesla's teammates are following
in her successful tracks. In addition
to the downhill team's victory, Stan
ford's mountain biking team took
second to UC-Davis Saturday.
Ciesla is excited because of the
team's youth.
"Essentially, what you are look
ing at are the results of a brand new
team," she said. "It's kind of a kick."
Stanford's Craig l.itherland
placed fifth in the men's downhill A
division, and Anona Dutton took
first in the women's cross country B
division.
Along with four other members
of Stanford's team, l.itherland and
( 'iesla will compete in the Mountain
Bike Nationals this weekend in
Madison, Wis.
"We don't expect to do tremen
dously well because our team is so
young," Ciesla said. "It's going to be
cold."
Mien's lacrosse
On the morning after I lallowcen,
the Stanford men's lacrosse team
met at 4:30 a.m. to head to a tourna

ment at ('hieo State. As if that wasn't
enough of a challenge, the Cardinal
arrived at 9:05 for a 9 a.m. game.
The team's subsequent 5-4 over
time loss to Sacramento State, there
fore, did not come as a huge shock.

CLUB SPORTS ROUNDUP

"We didn't get much time to
warm up," said senior captain Matt
Miller. "We woke up after that and
won our next two games."
Crushing Saint Mary's 9-1 and
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo 6-1, Stan
ford was pleased with its perfor
mance, especially considering it was
missing several key players.
"We're missing our goalie and
our attack," Miller said. "It was reas
suring to have such a strong perfor
mance in a tournament."
Offensive star Benton Williams,
for one, is spending the quarter in
Berlin.
"He's our offensive cannon,"
Miller said. "1 le's got a strong shot."
After a lull in the team's sched
ule, Stanford resumes play in Janu
ary with the return of Williams.
"We can expect him back in time
for the season to boost our offense,"
Miller said.
Although Williams has been
missed, his absence was less notice
able with the performance of senior
Jesse ()'l lanley, who scored of the
team's I l ) goals Saturday.
Ilorst* polo
Stanford's men's polo team re
turns to action in the next few weeks
minus two of its three starters.
Despite being a building year,
Stanford's polo teams are used to
molding athletes into polo players.
"Most people that come and play
with us have never even played
polo," said sophomore Bonnie I .ind,
a member of the women's team. "So
for the men's team, it will definitely

be a rebuilding year."
Returning two of three players,
including All-Western Conference
star Alexa Christy, the Cardinal
women appear to be strong.
"We've got a really strong team,
but it will still take a lot of work,"
Lind said.
Members of both teams will com
pete this Sunday in a casual game
with a local polo club. I lie more
competitive matches begin in two
weeks with a tournament in Santa
Barbara.
While graduate students are not
permitted to participate in regular
season matches, the Santa Barbara
tournament is an exception, allow
ing for an appearance by Stanford
grail student Nicolaf Luco.
"He's by far one of our best play
ers," Lind said. "They provide a dif
lerent outlook on the club. It's a lot
of fun to have them around."
Badminton
I'o the disappointment of Stan
ford's badminton team, the season
opener has yet to be played.
"There was a scheduling mix-up
at San Jose's gym last weekend,"
said team member Deborah-Anna
Reznek. "They called us the night
before to let lis know."
I he team is hoping the game will
be rescheduled soon. In the mean
time, Stanford hosts IJC-l)avis a
week from Sunday.
Kquestrian
After completing three shows
and finishing in the top two in each,
Stanford's equestrian team returns
to action this Sunday when it hosts
an intercollegiate horse show from
12:30-5:30 p.m.
Willi eight schools from North
ern ('alifornia, ()regon and Nevada
in attendance, the Cardinal will be
up against solid competition.
