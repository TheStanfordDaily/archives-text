Stanford bicyclists, beware. The Stanford
Police Department lias officially added po
lice officers on bikes to its routine patrolling
with the aim of enforcing bicycle laws and im
proving response time to crimes.
"People on bikes don't stop at the stop
signs and abide by the rules," said Stanford
Police Deputy Laura Wilson, who wrote the
proposal for the bike patrol and who current
ly trains the department's officers on bicy
cles. "This is an effective way to deal with vi
olators."
Although the police department is cur

rently issuing only warnings, officers have
given more warnings than they did before the
bike patrol position was created three weeks
ago.
Besides better enforcement of the law,
Wilson said this is a way for the police de
partment to get a better sense of the commu
nity through direct interaction.
"When the police officers are on a bike,
they seem less intimidating, more approach
able," Wilson said. "We're also more accessi
ble because we're less restricted and can go
through areas that cars aren't able to go
through."
Wilson said more people approach the of
ficers on bikes to ask questions and interact

with them.
Another advantage to the bike patrol is a
quicker response to calls and crimes when
they are called in.
"Because bikes are quiet and more incon
spicuous, you can surprise auto burglars and
others in the act of committing a crime," Wil
son said.
Up to two officers at a time are on bike pa
trol, provided there are enough officers on
staff available. They generally patrol within
the Campus Drive loop but are not limited to
this area.
Before going out on bike patrol, the offi
cers are trained in the classroom and learn
about bicycle laws and maintenance.

I'hey then practice on bikes to improve
their hiking skills and learn how to safely stop
cars and other bikes.
"Everyone likes it," Wilson said, 'it's va
riety for us and gives us a chance to interact
with the community in a non-enforcement
way."
Over the past year, the department has
used hike patrols only for certain events, in
cluding football games and visits to campus
by dignitaries.
"It is of greater importance because the
University is such a residential institution
with so many students living on campus," said
Dean of Students Marc Wais. "It makes it a
safer place to learn."
