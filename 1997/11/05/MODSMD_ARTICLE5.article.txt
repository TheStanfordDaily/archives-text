### Jason Engleman Contributing writer 
In recognition of his work in adopting
a number of innovations that have made
Stanford's introductory computer sci
ence courses popular. Prof. F.ric Roberts
has been named to a new. five-year ap
pointment as the Charles Simonyi Pro

lessor for Innovation in leaching at the
School of Engineering.
( harles Simonyi, the chief architect at
Microsoft and author of Microsoft Word
and Multiplan — the predecessor to
Excel — established the chair with a
$S(K).(KH) pledge.
Chair of the Computer Science De
partment Jean Claude-Latombe said

that Roberts won the award because he
contributed "to the department's under
graduate curriculum in computer science
in an outstanding way." Since he is "the
person in our department who does the
most for teaching." he was "by far the
best choice," ( laude Latombe added.
According to Roberts, winning the
award simply gives him the "challenge to

he able to do more."
Roberts said he intends to use this
added support to participate in a general
review of the core computer science cur
riculum being conducted by Ins depart
ment, study the possibility of changing
the programming language taught in the
introductory courses from C to Java,
explore ways that Stanford can ex
port more ol its instructional materi
als, work lor the establishment of a
national repository of computer sci
ence educational materials and
write a general-interest book that
explains the basic concepts involved
in computer science to intelligent lay
persons.
Roberts has been a leader in the
creation of successful teaching
met Ik >ds. Some of these methods in
clude the use of undergraduates as
teaching assistants, changing from
an academic to a commercial com
puter language in introductory
courses and using contests and
other methods to make these cours
es interesting and challenging to
students Irom a wide range of back
grounds.

At most Ivy League universities,
about 25 percent of undergraduates
take an introductory course in com
puter science. At Stanford, that
number is 80 percent.
This fact created a problem in
finding teaching assistants. About
five years ago, Roberts decided to
recruit undergraduates.
Using undergraduates as TAs
has turned out to have great advan
tages.. Roberts said.
They have lower salaries, are bet
ter able to establish a rapport with
introductory students and are more
familiar with campus computing fa
cilities and curriculum.
Looja Tuladhar, a senior major
ing in computer science, said she
loved her Computer Science 106
section.
"Roberts' concept of breaking
down the class into small sections
managed by individual section lead
ers, in particular, was very effective
as it provided a mentor who was

available in case anybody needed
help," she said. "The section leaders
also succeeded in motivating their
students to do well in the program
ming assignments."
In 1992, Roberts helped switch
the department's introductory
courses from a purely academic pro
gramming language called Pascal to
the commercial programming lan
guage C. Stanford was one of the
first universities to make this
change. The department had to de
velop its own programming environ
ment for C.
Although it was a difficult transi
tion. Roberts argued that it was nec
essary to make the courses interest
ing and relevant to students.
Since then, enrollments have
grown steadily and Roberts has writ
ten two successful textbooks that
use C to teach introductory pro
gramming.
Under Roberts' supervision, the
introductory classes have been

structured to accommodate stu
dents with a wide range of comput
ing experience.
Basic lessons are paced to allow
the computing novices to keep up,
but often challenges are snuck in to
keep experienced students inter
ested.
' The libraries and programming
assignments that Roberts has devel
oped for CS 1()6A allow students to
learn the fundamentals of computer
science while developing creative,
interesting programs," said Lee
Kenyon, a senior majoring in electri
cal engineering.
"This emphasis on creativity ap
peals to many people who otherwise
might not be interested in computer
science."
According to Roberts, a key as
pect of good teaching is caring about
the students.
"When I pay attention to them,
they know I'm valuing them," he
said. "I've always liked teaching."
