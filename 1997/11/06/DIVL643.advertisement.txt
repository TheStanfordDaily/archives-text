DRUNK DRIVING DOESN'T
JUST KILL DRUNK DRIVERS.
Alonzo Drake, killed 8/17/91 at
10:58pm an Rabbins Rd., Harvest, AL.
Next time your friend insists on
driving drunk, do whatever it takes to
stop him. Because if he kills innocent
people, how will you live with yourself?
FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS DRIVE DRUNK.
