# Bookstore sales down 11 percent
## 
### Daniel Wolk Staff writer 
The Stanford Bookstore's sales for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1997 were down 11 percent
from the preceding year, according to a Bookstore
statement released last week.
The decrease in sales, the statement said, can be
attributed to increased competition from outside
vendors as well as a drop in Microdisc computer
sales.

The decline in Microdisc sales, especially of
Apple computers was the greatest contributor to
the sales decrease, said C 'hief Financial (Officer Dan
Casper.
Bookstore Marketing Manager Anoop krish
nan attributed the drop to competition from Dell
Computer Corp., a manufacturer that specializes in
selling direct to consumers.
"Dell increased its competition in increasing its
direct sales to the Stanford community," explained
Krishnan.

Casper noted that another reason for the de
crease was a decline in the sales of technical books,
particularly at the Bookstore's branch in Palo Alto,
which specializes in such books.
Although net sales were down from $51.7 mil
lion in the preceding year to $4h million, the Book
store was still able to increase its net surplus from
$1.41 million to $1.46 million, of which $424,(XH)
was returned to students, faculty and staff in the
form of rebate checks.
According to the statement, the
increase in its net surplus can be at
tributed to efforts by the Bookstore
to improve employee efficiency and
reduce general costs.
"It's with very diligent cost control
efforts that the Bookstore has main
tained its net surplus in a difficult year
that saw an 11 percent decrease in

sales," said Krishnan.
"The bookstore will continue to
keep its costs down and maintain the
high levels of service excellence ex
pected on the Stanford campus," Kr
ishnan added.
According to ASSU Financial
Manager Don Coleman, the de
crease in sales cannot be attributed to
the newly-built Stanford Store, which
opened last November in Tresidder
Union. The Stanford Store, run by
Stanford Student Enterprises, com
petes with the Bookstore in sales ot

merchandise and clothing.
"Two-thirds of the Bookstore's
sales come in the fall." said Coleman,
who stressed that since the Stanford
Store did not open until late Novem
ber, its effect on Bookstore sales
could not have been that substantial.
Similarly, Students Monitoring
Organizations on Campus President
Eric Friedman, a junior, noted that
his organization was "not really a fac
tor" in the sales decrease.
SMOC, which was formerly
known as Stop Monopolies On Cam

pus, inaugurated a popular campaign
last year to sell used books at prices
lower than the Bookstore's.
"'We sold maybe 1,000 books at
most through SMOC last spring. At.
say, $50 per textbook, that's still only
$50,000, which is nowhere close to
the $5 million drop in sales," said
Friedman.
The Bookstore owns four sepa
rate stores: the Stanford Bookstore,
the Stanford Bookstore in Palo Alto,
the Track House, and Tresidder Ex
press.
