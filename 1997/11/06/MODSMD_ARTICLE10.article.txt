# Intel donates computer equipment

Intel — the company famous for its Pentium
processor — will donate $3.2 million worth of
computers and related equipment to various
Stanford departments over the next three years.
The company's gift of about 4(H) machines and
350 other pieces of state-of-the-art equipment is
part of an overall award to 13 universities totaling
$29 million under Intel's Technology for Educa
tion 2(KK) program.
"Intel is looking for ways to collaborate with
the University and the professors.," said Laura
Breyfogle, an assistant director at the School of
Engineering who worked on the grant. "It's good
business strategy as well as philanthropy. They
also seek to be visible among students."
Departments ranging from biology to statis
tics, as well as computer science, will benefit from
the donation of personal computers, workstations
and network hubs.
John Rick, associate professor of anthropolo
gy, said he aims to set up computer clusters to use

virtual reality technology to study faraway ar
chaeological sites.
One goal is to prepare precisely mapped,
three-dimensional models of the Chavin-de
Huantar site in Chile. The site was an early Native
American settlement with political complexity
and monumental architecture, according to Kick.
The computer science department will receive
three workstations and two PCs for developmen
tal work in image database navigation. Carlo
Tomasi, associate professor of computer science,
will lead a team to improve the problems related
to computer-aided image retrieval.
The grant will also aid an innovative project in
long-distance brain surgery led by Assoc. Neuro
surgery Prof. John Adler and Asst. Neurosurgery
Prof. Ramin Shahidi in conjunction with faculty in
the computer science department: associate pro
lessors Oussama Khatib and Serge Plotkin, Prof.
Jean-Claude Latombe and Tomasi.
"The point of this project is to make a surgeon
feel and see at a distance," said Tomasi.
The premise is that a surgeon will be able to

perform surgery many miles away by operating on
images of the patient shown on a workstation. The
surgeon slips his fingers into the thimble-like parts
of a machine called a haptic device and, through
the movement of his lingers, simulates an opera
tion which is then realized with the help of a robot
in contact with patient.
"The problem of the computer program is to
control the thimble so that as you push in, you
have the feeling of touching brain tissue. The re
sponse [of the thimble] has to be elastic and soft
enough to correspond with the feeling of touching
tissue," Tomasi said.
Intel will donate 12 to 15 machines, including
multiprocessors, for this complex project.
Computer Science Prof. Leo (iuibas and
Latombe are working on a project improving the
algorithms of motion.
"This [donation] is also a test-bed for the
equipment. Our faculty is inventive and Intel
wants to see what they can do," said Breyfogle.
The first equipment will arrive in the begin
ning of December.
