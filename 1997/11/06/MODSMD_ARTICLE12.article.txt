FOR THE RECORD...
Larry Duncan, portrayed in a Daily photo yesterday, is not, as he
was identified, a homeless person. He is a homeless activist.
An article in yesterday's Daily referred to Computer Science Prof.
Eric Roberts as having originated the use of undergraduates as section
leaders. In fact, the practice dates back to the early 1 980s and was orig
inated by Lecturer Stuart Reges.
The same article repeatedly referred to Looja Tuladhar in the fem
inine gender. Tuladhar is in fact male.
