i accurately about his relationship with James and Susan MeDougal and their failed
•1 Arkansas S&L. the witnesses said.

I been deposited in one of two Arkansas banks where the Clintons did business.
I The president's private lawyer, attorney David Kendall, scoffed at the discovery yester
day. declaring that prosecutors are conducting "an interminable, leak-ridden inquisition."
