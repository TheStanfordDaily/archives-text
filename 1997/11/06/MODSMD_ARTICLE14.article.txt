UNITED NATIONS (AP) â€” Taking
advantage of a halt to U.N. arms inspec
tions. Iraqis have hidden sensitive equip
ment and tampered with IJ.N. surveillance
cameras, a senior U.N. official said yester
day
The chief U.N. weapons inspector,
Richard Butler, said his teams would try
to inspect two sites today "to establish the
whereabouts" of material "which has been
moved."
Butler's vow came as U.N. envoys were
in Baghdad trying to persuade the govern
ment of Saddam Hussein not to interfere
with the inspections, after Iraqi authorities
turned back monitoring teams that includ
ed Americans for the third straight day.
Butler suspended U.N. weapons
inspections in Iraq last week after Bagh
dad ordered the expulsion of American
members of his team. Butler said the
inspections would go ahead as planned
Monday, but each day he has scrubbed
them after American inspectors were
barred from entering the country.
The inspections are meant to verify

whether Iraq has destroyed all long-range
missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
That was a condition for ending the 1991
Persian Gulf War. in which a U.S.-led
coalition drove Iraqi forces from neigh
boring Kuwait.
Destruction of the arms is also the main
condition for lifting crippling economic
sanctions the U.N. Security Council
imposed on Baghdad after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in August 199().
In a letter lo the Security Council. But
ler said there was evidence that since the
inspections were called off. the Iraqis have
been moving equipment that could be
adapted for military use and interfering
with U.N. surveillance equipment used to
monitor the sites.
The cameras may have been intention
ally tampered with, lenses covered and
lighting turned off in the facilities under
monitoring, Butler wrote.
The council offered no comment on the
letter, a copy of which was obtained by
I he Associated Press.
In the letter. Butler, an Australian.

noted that movement of the equipment is
prohibited without IJ.N. permission.
The apparatus includes test equipment
that could be used to calibrate prohibited
missile gyroscopes, he added.
He said it would "take only a few
hours" to adapt some of the sensitive
equipment "to produce seed stocks of bio
logical warfare agent."
In Washington, State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin called Butler's
disclosures "troubling."
"It indicates flouting of the will of the
international community by Iraq and it is
not a hopeful sign," he said.
In Washington, President Clinton said
he would be patient with IJ.N. weapons
inspection efforts near Baghdad and
urged U.S. allies to do the same.
"This is a frustrating policy, the one
we're following, because it requires long
term patience and discipline," Clinton told
reporters yesterday at the Oval Office. "1
would ask the American people and our
allies around the world not to get too frus
trated. to be patient but to be firm."
