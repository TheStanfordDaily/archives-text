University coultTve worked
more effectively with
Axe Committee on bonfire

IN NOVEMBER 1974, in preparation
for the Big Game bonfire, two Stan
ford students were seriously injured
when a telephone pole being used as a
structural support for the bonfire fell on
top of them. Later, during the bonfire, a
riot ensued as spectators hurled bottles
and rocks at local firemen who had
responded to Stanford police calls to
douse the bonfire. After much public
humiliation in local papers, the University
announced that the bonfire would no
longer be a Big Game tradition due to
safety, air quality and crowd control con
cerns.
In 1983, the Axe Committee, the care
takers of Stanford's Big Game traditions,
worked closely with the University admin
istration to bring back the bonfire. These
students and University representatives
used their creativity and engineering
know-how to create a newer, cleaner
burning bonfire that would provide mini
mal environmental impact.
In the fall of 1985, a pyre as tall and as
wide as the Old Union, with heat that
reached out to the audience a full 100
yards away, once again graced the Stan
ford faithful with flames that licked as
high as 250 feet into the air. Eight years
later would see the end of this tradition
again — all halted due to the presence of
tiger salamanders.
For the past four years, students have
been lead to believe that the University
administration has been working with the
Axe Committee to overcome this issue
and to resurrect the Big Game bonfire to
its past glory. Unfortunately, such is not
the case.
Since the discovery of the tiger sala
manders. the University has "addressed"
the issue of the bonfire and its impact on
the salamander through a series of habitat
studies and most recently, an environmen
tal impact report. Delivered this past
August, the report said that a bonfire in
Lake Lagunita would have a potential 13
percent impact on the current tiger sala
mander population. According to the Uni
versity, the bonfire poses too great an
impact on the salamander population.
But the University's concern for the
environmental impact on the salaman
der population has not stalled other pro
jects, such as the new Lyman Graduate
Residences, which was identified as
being along the salamanders' migration
path.
There has been speculation that the
decision to cancel the bonfire was a polit
ical decision used to reduce the potential
impact on the University's other four-year
old project Measure O — the Sand Hill
Road extension. The $8 million invested
in promoting, researching and planning
the proposed Sand Hill extension and the
University's future development plans

could have been threatened by adverse
public reaction to an environmental issue.
Measure O opponents had cited concerns
over the environmental impact of the
Stanford Sand Hill Road project in their
counter measure. Measure M.
Additionally, members of the adminis
tration seem to feel that students are
ambivalent about having a bonfire after
four years without having one. The last
undergraduates who saw the traditional
bonfire in 1992 have left the Farm.
"Why not start some new tradition?"
has been the suggestion from the Dean of
Students Office and other administrator.
The University, by its action (and inac
tion). has treated the Axe Committee, and
students in general, with more of the in
loco parentis attitude — where the stu
dents are considered children, to be man
aged and taken care of by their surrogate
parents, the University.
Someone seems to have forgotten the
premise behind the Fundamental Stan
dard where students are considered con
tributing adults to the life and direction of
the University, respected for their minds
and enthusiasm.
Rather than address the issue of the
tiger salamanders and how best to solve
this new environmental constraint, the
University focused its efforts on defining
the impact of the bonfire rather than
working with the Axe Committee to
develop a better solution.
In various meetings, the Axe Commit
tee spent more time as information
resources interrogated by the University
than being equal participants in address
ing the bonfire issue. Although the impact
study was completed two months ago, the
Axe Committee was unable to receive a
copy until recently. Had they had access
to its contents earlier, perhaps they could
have played a more active role in develop
ing a more environmentally safe bonfire
given the study's recommendations. Even
with the facilitation efforts of the Office of
Student Activities, the Axe Committee
found that the OS A was not an effective
means of reaching the decision makers in
Building 10.
We fully support the Axe Committee
in its bonfire plans for the 100 th Big Game
— although it will not hold the same
impact that would be felt with a pyre 1000
times its size. Although we realize that a
perceived apathy on the part of students
could have stifled the Axe Committee's
efforts this year, we feel that students feel
strongly about this issue.
The long term issue of how students
are integrated into life on the Farm must
be addressed. In 1983, the University and
students worked together to overcome
immense obstacles and resurrect the Big
Game bonfire.
In 1997, does the administration want
students to consider themselves equal
members of the Stanford community as
the Fundamental Standard suggests? Or
should we consider ourselves locked in a
top-down management structure where
students concerns rarely advance to the
members of Building 10?
