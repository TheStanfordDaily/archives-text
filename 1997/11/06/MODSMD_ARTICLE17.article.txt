## Gleaning the details of the fine print 
### 
AS A STUDENT.
I've always
learned to look
for the key point. When
reading an article, I isolate
the main thesis; when
perusing a book, I try to
find the most important
passages. I recently, how-

ever, came upon a powerful epiphany. What
I finally understood was that the most impor
tant insights come from the fine print.
I'm not talking about the fine print people
know they should pay attention to (but
unfortunately don't) like on contracts or
bank statements or cigarette packages.
I'm also not talking about the implied
fine print of official transactions (such as
when Greg Brady bought the Volkswagen
convertible from slick salesman buddy
Eddie, even though Dad warned him to
"caveat emptor"— which I believe is Latin
for the "cave is empty," which is odd,
because the caves they found in Hawaii
were anything but empty, what with the
giant tikis and Vincent Price and all). No,
I'm talking about the fine print in everyday
life.
For example, I remember reading that the
most important part of a letter is the
postscript.
I was reminded of this fact when I recent
ly received a letter from a friend who wrote:
Dear Marc, How are you? Blah blah blah.
Hasn't the weather been great? Blah blah
blah. Why aren't there any TV shows about
graduate students? Blah blah blah. Sincere
ly, Hortense. P.S. Can I borrow $5(X)? The
oddest part (aside from the fact that some
couple actually named their daughter Hort
ense) was that she actually wrote "Blah blah
blah."
Anyway, the key to the whole letter was
hidden at the very end.
This is true of e-mail as well, however, it is
exacerbated even further. The message of
the fine print is even more concealed by the
subject line. For example:

To: marc.chun@leland.stanford.edu
From: freakzilla@freaknet.com
Subject: Research project
I think the new research project looks
promising. Intriguing conceptual
framework, although the current
methodological approach is pretty
mediocre.
P.S. Can I borrow $500?
Once again, the key to the message is the
final four words.
And speaking of forwards (OK, this
would be a lot funnier if it had been read
aloud... that, and if it had been written by a
comedian), the key to a book isn't in the
body of the text, but in the forward and
appendices. Similarly, the key to reading
research papers is the footnotes.
In both cases, this is where wc learn of the
shortcomings of the study (typically phrased
in a footnote as: "Although the research
team was interested in classroom behavior,
we did not actually set foot on school
grounds, but instead came up with these
findings from the office. Empirical data col
lection is part of the future research agen
da").
Undergraduates may be surprised to
learn that the fine print of the Stanford Bul
letin outlines their graduation requirements,
including: "All students must (1) abide by
the Fundamental Standard; (2) complete all
requirements for the major; and (3) join at
least one campus a cappella group." Gradu
ate students, on the other hand, must "(1)
become bitter and jaded; (2) quickly dis
pense with any fashion sense; and (3) wear a
bike helmet at all times."
While we're on the subject, I can only
assume that hidden within the cycling codes
of Stanford, there must be fine print inform
ing students that they are supposed to ride
through all stop signs and stoplights, regard
less of (incoming automobile traffic. This all
doesn't quite make sense to me, but, hey.

they're the rules. I guess!
Fine print in the lime Schedule alerts stu
dents to the fact that thev must use the Stan
ford- Patented. Abbrevio-Language, where
Coffee 1 louse becomes ( oHo and Memori
al (Church b comes MemC"hu. I always found
this only ghtly less cryptic than the Uliby-
Dubby language on "Zoom. 1 guess shaying
off seconds by removing all those unneces
sary extra syllables can really add up
(enough so that you have time to make it to
a cappella rehearsal). Fine print or not. I still
say StuWhoOnly Talk In AbbrevAreFreak
sOfNat.
Also, if you read the fine print on your
Stanford apparel purchases from the Book
store. you'll see this warning: "Do not
bleach / machine wash cold separately/
must be warn with other Stanford apparel."
Around campus every morning, bleary
eyed students rely on these modern-day.
collegiate Granimals™. "What should I
wear with this Stanlord T-shirt? they
mumble to themselves. "How about the
Stanford sweatpants! And you know what
will really bring out the shade of cardinal in
the sweatpants? The matching cardinal
sweatshirt! And what to top it off with? Ah,
no need to wash my hair this morning "if I
wear the Stanford cap!" The really scary
part — aside from the fact that they are
actually narrating their process of dressing
is that they think they actually look good.
Finally, the fine print in the very newspa
per von are reading is also of great import.
The best jokes can be found in the cute nick
names in the staff box or in the egg and
sperm donor ads. •**
So. here we are at the end of the colurrui.
You might be wondering, "What does this all
mean? What was the main, underlying r|je£-
sage of the whole thing?" In which case,ybu
missed the whole point.

tion. Note, once again, that the most impor
tant information is in the fine print.
