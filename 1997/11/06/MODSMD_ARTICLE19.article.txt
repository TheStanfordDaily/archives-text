I am very concerned about Tuesday's
special feature titled "Avoiding The Real
World." Specifically, Joann Liao and
whoever wrote the headline displayed an
incredible amount of shortsightedness and
ignorance in their presentation of seniors
opting for"the road less traveled."
While I agree that many Stanford
seniors are swamped with job or graduate
school applications, interviews and cover
letters, your dismissal of the work that
goes into launching a music career is trou
bling.
Because the hand began performing
professionally. Canvas has thrust itself
into the "real world" of the entertainment
business.
We have, for over a year, met with
lawyers, record producers, song writers,
publicists, session musicians, music pub
lishers, record company representatives,
night clubs, hooking agents and reporters.

In every setting, the hand has had to he
professional or else those in the industry
who currently embrace the hand's music
would have dismissed it without worry.
1 am very confused ahout what The
Daily believes is the "Real World." Is
"The Real World" anything th;it is not
Stanford affiliated?
In that case 1 expect to see stories on
people who opt for graduate school or to
work on campus. Is "The Real World"
any occupation served by the career fair?
Judging by the companies represented
there, I expect stories on anyone who is
not planning a career in engineering,
management consulting or investment
banking.
Is "The Real World" a regular 9 to 5
job with an established company for
$25,000 a year? If so. 1 expect to see sto
ries on anyone willing to work for an
upstart technology company or anyone
with the audacity to serve the community,
working lone hours for little money.

In short, dismissing a carter in music as
"avoiding the real world" is elitist and
stupid.
It may also he The Daily's position
that steering away from "traditional"
forms of employment is taking the easy
way out. To that, I hope The Daily under
stands that the current music industry is
extremely competitive, thanks to an
increasingly fickle audience. Trying to
predict what is going to be a hit in a year
is infinitely more difficult than solving a
case study given hv a job interviewer.
I expect everyone ambitious enough to
follow their dreams is as angry at The
Daily as I am. I refuse to let The Daily
dictate what is and is not an acceptable
use of my Stanford diploma.
And to any Daily staffers hoping to
pursue a career in journalism. I wish you
the best ol luck. It is a tough world out
there... really tough.
