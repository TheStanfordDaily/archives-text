# Talking race
## Professors to speak today on ethnicity in America 
### Nicoli Richardson 
Stanford's Center for Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity kicks off a year-long lecture series today
with a forum about race issues in the United States.
Titled "Race in America: What's the Agenda? A
Campus Discussion with Stanford's CSRE Faculty on Is
sues of Race and Ethnicity in the United States," the
event will bring together four professors to discuss their
perspectives on race and ethnicity.
The event is scheduled from 4 to 6 p.m. in the History
Corner.
The entire series was created in response to the ad
dress given by President Clinton at UC-San Diego's
commencement last June. In his address Clinton chal
lenged Americans to communicate with one another
about the racial lines that are dividing the nation.
With this in mind the center hopes to examine the
"critical issues related to race and ethnicity, both in the
United States and abroad," a statement from the center
said.
Participating in today's event are Education Prof.
Kenji Hakuta, an experimental psychologist; Assoc. Po
litical Science Prof. Luis Fraga, the resident fellow in
Castano: Assoc. Philosophy Prof. Debra Satz, director of
the Ethics in Society Program; and Psychology Prof.
Claude Steele, whose research focuses on self-evalua
tion, the effects of stereotypes on particular groups of
people and addictive behavior.
CSRE Program Director Al Camarillo said people
must "be informed about the issues. The issues are com
plex and we will attempt to sort out many of them."
It is important "to get people
talking about matters of race and
ethnicity as President Clinton asked
in his June commencement speech,"

Camarillo said.
The second phase of the program
is scheduled in January, a "Summit
on Race in America."
This summit "will bring together
academics, public policy analysts,
elected and appointed officials,
government agency and nonprofit

organization leaders to discuss is
sues of great importance on mat
ters of race relations in America,"
the statement said. Many policies
of particular importance to Califor
nia will be discussed, such as the
anti-affirmative action initiative
Proposition 209. which voters

passed last November.
The center for CSRE was found
ed in 19%. It is "the first of its kind in
the United States to promote teach
ing and research on the topics of race
and ethnicity from both domestic
and international comparative per
spective," the statement said.
