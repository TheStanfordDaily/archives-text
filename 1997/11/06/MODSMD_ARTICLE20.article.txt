## Rejecting categories and being myself

I'VE BEEN BRUSHING up on my
acting skills as of late. Some may ven
ture to say I'm rather talented because
asl walk the streets of Hong Kong, I pre
tend to he a local.
On first glance, 1 blend right in, and it's
great. Cantonese people approach me to
ask for directions, hand me Chinese-only
mtnus and initiate conversations about my
injured foot and the weather.
I walk the walk and mute the talk. In
Cantonese settings, my adept counting
skills and profuse apologies can only get
me so far — my cover gets blown whenev
er an encounter lasts for more than 30 sec
onds.
Take yesterday for example. As I fum
bled for a $2 coin to pay for the HK$l.7O
Star Ferry, a woman approached me with
her assembly of coinage. I knew what she
had in mind.
Hong Kong ferries and buses don't give
Change. Strategic Hong Kongers will often
approach fellow passengers (who have
small change) and try to achieve a more
friendly balance of trade with the public
transport system.
The woman started spouting numbers
to me in Cantonese, calculating the neces
sary coin exchanges for each of us to end
up paying $1.70. But all I had was a $2

coin, and neither of us had anything small
er.
Frankly, I didn't care about losing the
30 cents, but 1 wanted to help her out if
possible. She started giving me instruc
tions while I piled all of my coins into my
left hand, hoping she would take the ini
tiative and just help herself to whatever
she needed.
I felt like I was in a bad comedy. Like a
deer in headlights, the mute college stu
dent (played by a Chinese actress, NOT
Ming Na Wen. which only leaves two
other Chinese women in Hollywood)
stands in the middle of the concourse,
looking like she's trying to feed pigeons.
The charade was failing. "I don't speak
Cantonese." I apologized in Mandarin. In
a rare show of Hong Kong kindness, my
linguistic ineptitude was forgiven. I was
lucky; this woman spoke putonghua, the
language of the mainland. The coin
exchange was made and we eo : H uered the
corporate greed embodied by the non
clumge-giving turnstiles. We didn't hand
over an extra cent.
In the last two months, I've developed a
standard operating procedure when it
comes to conversing with the local popu
lace. First 1 try some paltry Cantonese.
When that fails, I trv to mutate mv Man

darin into a unique brand of warped Can
tonese to see if that works. After I've
made a fool of myself, 1 try a combination
of Mandarin and English. Trial and error
often end up producing more error than
the trial is worth.
For second-generation Chinese immi
grants raised in the United States, lan
guage skills have long been the "cultural
heritage" litmus test. ABCs (American
born Chinese) are often mocked by first
generational immigrants lor their Western
accents and roundly criticized for their less
than extensive Chinese vocabulary. As
elders bemoan the cultural and generation
gaps that burden their families, ABCs are
left to fend for themselves in settings
where there are lew answers to their ques
tions of cultural identity.
Traveling in Asia has made me feel the
question of my identity even more sharply.
People spoke Mandarin to me in Beijing,
but that was fine. I speak the language
with relatively no accent and many asked
me from where in China I came.
For the first time in my life, I was sur
rounded by a society speaking my family's
language. 1 was no longer in the minority.
I was a member of the majority — my Han
pride swelled. At the same time, 1 felt
acutely Western and American during mv

stay there. 1 didn't belong.
A Chinese rural peasant woman had
told me her first impression of me was a
strange one: I had a Chinese lace and
Asian hair, but 1 "walked like a Western
er."
Interesting. There's just no way I can
win. I thought. My Western upbringing is
too pervasive. But then again, I'm not
really sure what kind of a game I'm play
ing and if winning is necessarily the goal.
All I knew was that the game was a com
plex one. where ever-shifting rules were
defined by convoluted semantics.
When I played the game in high school.
I had always called myself "Chinese." Hut
then I got to Stanford and AASA told me
I was "Asian-American." Ii followed that
I should call myself a "Chinese-Ameri
can." I wasn't sure how I felt about I his
new game piece I'd always found the
entire hyphenated business to be rather
trite and
annoying.
So I continued on the journey. The one
that involves soul searching, looking in
the mirror and talking long hours with
roommates, defining what "American" is
and if the term incorporates people of all
colors or just the ones with pink skin. We
talked about "The Hyphen" and whether

that conferred second class citizenship.
Alter much contemplation and travel
through Asia, I've come to an answer: I
just don't care. Call it profound. Call it a
cop-out. My apathy will frustrate you.
I don't have anything to prove to any
one: 1 don't need a label because it is just
a word, and I've already written too many
of those here. My identity has nothing to
do with whether I call myself Chinese,
Chinese-American or American because
in the end. I'll still have the same informa
lion and amount of "culture" in my head.
I will have the same capacity to take pride
in my ethnic heritage and appreciate
things like the variation ol lice prepara
tion across cultures.
So in the words of Jean Valjean, who
am 1? I am ethnically Chinese. Culturally.
I am a second generation Chinese immi
grant. born in Canada and raised in the
United States. I'm relatively well traveled
(and potty-trained) and speak enough
Mandarin to discuss my injured foot. And
I always carry lots of change.
