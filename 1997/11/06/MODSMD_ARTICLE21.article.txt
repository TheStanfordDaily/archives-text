## Finding my 'grass roots': my weekend with Perot 
### 
Nikki Love

For the past
live years, I've
been trying to
answer a question pre
sented to me in many dif
ferent forms.
"Why do you like Ross
Perot?" asked friends in
1992. 'Reform Party

bumper stickers? What for?" remarked
dormmates in 1996. And most recently,
"What brings you to this convention?"
inquired the Washington Post reporter.
And to each of these, I had no precise
answer. Why am I so into Ross Perot's
Reform Party?
Last weekend. I traveled to Kansas
C'itv, Mo. for the Reform Party National
Founding Convention, hoping to find the
answer.
The Reform Party and I go way back.
When I was 14. I campaigned for Perot

'92. At 16.1 attended the United We Stand
America Conference in Dallas. At 17. I
gathered petition signatures for Perot '96
and went to his rally in Valley Forge, Pa.
At IS, I cast my first ballot for the
Perot / Choate ticket. And now, after all
those years of unsuccessful attempts, the
new Reform Party held its first-ever con
vention. fighting against all odds to estab
lish itself as a viable third party — and
change American politics forever. If there
was ever a time the Reform Party needed
me. I thought that it was now.
So. last weekend. 1 put aside the books,
forked over some cash, and packed my
bags. I flew to Kansas City, tired and ner
vous about the schoolwork I left behind.
Sitting in the plane, I thought, "What am I
doing? I have two midterms and an eight
page paper! Why am I going to the
Reform Party convention?"
And then began the most exhilarating

weekend ol my lite.
1 arrived at the Kansas ( ity ( onvention
Center and registered as a Reform Party
State Delegate and as Hawaii State Chair.
I reunited with old acquaintances I had
met during other Perot campaigns. In the
main hall, I joined hundreds ol other
Reform Party members, enthusiastically
yelling "Yea!" as we formulated the party
platform. I strolled the halls of the con
vention center with Russ Verney, the
party's chairman and Perot's right-hand
man. I moderated a panel discussion for
the National College Reform Party and
introduced the guest speaker, Pat Choate.,
Could it get any better than this?
I rediscovered all the issues that were
important to me — the national debt,
campaign reform, entitlement costs and
the trade deficit. And I was inspired once
again by all those classic Perot principles
patriotism, democracy and honest gov

eminent.
Then 1 met the Washington Post
reporter, who asked me, "What brings you
to Kansas ( ity'.'" And I couldn't quite vei
bali/e inv response. My reason for sup
porting the Reform Party is intangible,
like a feeling or an emotion. It puis the
spring in my step, the glow on my lace and
the sparkle in my eye. W11;11 is that
answer? Wh;it made me come all the way
to Kansas ( ity?
Saturday evening, I sat in the main hall,
listening to Ross Perot's keynote speech,
(iood ol' Ross was better than ever, and
the.ciw.vl Reformers cheered him on. I
was on the edge ol my seat, hanging onto
each word, his colorful language and Ins
Texan drawl. And then, at the close of his
speech, came the answer: "You hear that
voice within you whisper, I his is worth
fighting for.' "
I hat's it. I hear a "whisper."

Having returned to Stanford, I've
noticed that it's often hard to hear thai
whisper. I hang out Willi my drawmates,
settle into campus life and dive into
schoolwork. Big goals and dreams shrink
down to a world view limited to Mavlicld,
I lie Quad and White I'la/a. At times, I
almost forget how much the Reform Party
means to me. Instead, I narrowly focus on
my schoolwork those two upcoming
midterms and that eight page paper.
In I lie midst ol the commotion ol lile on
I he I aim, it wouldn't hurt to take a step
hack and listen to a voice within yon. Do
you hear a whisper'.', I do. And 1 know this
is worth lighting for.

chapter oj the National College Ueform
