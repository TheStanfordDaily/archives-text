vs. Silute (Lithuania) at Maples Pavilion.
7:30 p.m.

Not only does Stanford return four starters
from last year's Sweet Sixteen team and own
one of the deepest front lines in the country, but
the ( ardinal also hoasts one of the top recruit
ing classes in the nation by far the most high
ly touted in school history.
Hut behind this lies the lingering question of
how the program will cope with the loss of that
fifth starter, point guard Hrevin Knight. The
Cardinal begins a new era without the Ail-
American whose name had become synony
mous with Stanford basketball.
Junior point guard Ai thin I ,ee will takeover
the reins this year after spending time at both
guard positions and starting in the last 11 games
last season, averaging 7.(i points and 1.8 assists.
1 ec's shooting skills 40 percent from the
field last year, 34 percent from three-point

range will help ensure no opponent lays too
far off. and his quick speed should help his tran
sition to full-time point guard status.
But despite Knight's prominence. Lee feels
perfectly comfortable taking over at the point.
"I've been waiting for this for two years," he
said. "I had a great teacher in Brcvin, and I'm
ready to keep it going, to keep the streak alive.
I know I've just got to plav my game.
"I'm just going to bring the things that I'm
capable of bringing to the table to lead the team.
I here's no pressure It's basketball, it's just hav
ing fun."
Backing up Lee will be senior Kamba
I shionyi, who saw action in 13 games List year
and made five of 16 shots from behind the arc.
Also in the hunt for playing time is freshman
Mike McDonald, one ol Stanford's three new
recruits.
"We feel very confident in Arthur's ability to
handle the job," said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "Kamba certainly ;is a senioi has the
intelligence and the experience to handle the
job, and we're high on Mike McDonald. But
you don't get a Brcvin very often and we have
to realize that and push on from that ami take
advantage of other parts ol the game."

(42.6 percent, fifth in the conference
and third among returning players).
Wecms averaged 11.7 points and 2.6
rebounds in 30 games.
Behind Wecms. sophomores
David Mosele\ and Ryan Mendez
bring their prolific shooting skills
back to the Farm. Mendez, who
earned honorable mention on the Pa
cific 10 C onference All-Freshman
team, also averaged 42.6 percent
from downtown on 29-of-56 shoot
ing.
Moseley contributed off the bench
last ycai and had ;i career day against
I JSC when he tacked up IM points,
including live three pointers. Along
with Wecms and Mendez. Moseley
will keep defenders honest with his
long-range abilities.

But the team's strongest asset is its
I'ront line, which boasts six players 6-
foot-K or taller, tops in the Pac-10.
Not included in that group is junior
forward Peter Sauer, who is 6-7.
Sauer started 2X games at power for
ward last year and will probably be
moved to the three spot.
The Cardinal's remarkable size
gives il one of the deepest fronteourts
in the country, and the arrival of Ail-
American freshmen twins Jarron and
Jason Collins is creating a buzz
throughout the nation.
"We're going to get the ball inside
a lot so the big guys in there can
pound it away," Lee said. "That'll
create a lot of available shots for the
perimeter players as well. People will
start converging on them, and they'll
be able to kick il out to us."
The front line is anchored by 7-1
center Tim Young, who led the con
ference with K. 4 rebounds per game
and uarnered All Pac-10 Honorable

Mention. I le is second in the league
among returning players with 1.7
blocked shots per game.
Young also averaged 13.7 points
while shooting 50.4 percent, fifth
among returning Pac-1() players. He
is already being touted as an All-
America candidate.
But while many are looking to
Young to become the new leader of
the team, he shies away from the
thought of setting the example.
"I think obviously all of us have to
pick up the responsibility after Brevin
graduated," Young said. "It's not just
the big guys. [ Lee J has to pick it up
and so do the other guards. I think
there's a lot more responsibility on
just playing better as a team."
Sophomore Mark Madsen's in
tensity in practice and in games have
helped make him a big-time contrib
utor. In 25 games last year. Madsen
averaged 5.M points and 5.0 rebounds
in 16.4 minutes.

Junior Mark Seaton and senior
Pete Van Elswyck add to the veteran
experience in the frontcourt. Both
can step up when called on, as they
demonstrated in the second round of
last year's NCAA tournament, when
Young got in foul trouble guarding
Wake Forest Ail-American Tim
Duncan.
Young's main backup, however,
appears to be freshman Jason ( 'ollins.
Montgomery has been impressed
with ('ollins' ability to stand in and go
toe-to-toe with the team's veteran
players.
Rounding out the frontcourt will
be 6-10 Jarron Collins, who will fight
for time at the power forward posi
tion. His ball-handling skills and
perimeter shooting make him a more
versatile player than his brother, and
both are expected to contribute along
with the team's already-strong big
men.
The freshman "are doing very

well." Montgomery said. "They've
come into a program that's fairly
strong, in that they've come into a
team that has good, solid players at all
the positions they're playing. Their
ability or even the need for them to
have to step in and be the guy right
away is different, but they've shown
the ability to learn."
Montgomery knows the Cardi
nal's schedule is one of the toughest in
years, but accepts that as the price of
national prominence.
" There's some really good teams
on the schedule, so it'll give us a little
bit of an opportunity to see where we
are." he said. "And of course, if you
can win some of those games, it can
definitely help you on a national
basis, but you have to recognize that
you also run the risk of not being able
to win some of those games."
The schedule includes a date with
(ieorgia in the Wooden ('lassie at the
Anaheim Pond Dec. 6, as well as

CBS-televised games against Con
necticut Feb. 7 and Arizona Feb. 28.
Hut perhaps the most daunting
part ot Stanford's schedule is Pac-1()
play, where the Cardinal must face
defending NCAA champion Ari
zona and three-time defending con
ference champion I'( LA.
"On paper it would look like
everybody else is chasing those two,
and there are probably two or three
teams that would have the best op
portunity to compete against them,
and we think we're one of those
schools," Montgomery said. "1 don't
think anybody's going to concede
anything. Even though Arizona did
win a national championship, they
were fifth in the league."
Though the Cardinal enters the
season with some of the highest ex
pectations in recent history, only time
will tell if it can find a leader to replace
Knight and continue its winning tra
dition.
Coming oil one of its most successful years
in school history, the CCardinal men's basketball

experience in the frontcourt. Both
can step up when called on, as they
demonstrated in the second round of
last year's NCAA tournament, when
Young got in foul trouble guarding
Wake Forest Ail-American Tim
Duncan.
Young's main backup, however,
appears to be freshman Jason ( 'ollins.
Montgomery has been impressed
with ('ollins' ability to stand in and go
toe-to-toe with the team's veteran
players.
Rounding out the frontcourt will
be 6-10 Jarron Collins, who will fight
for time at the power forward posi
tion. His ball-handling skills and
perimeter shooting make him a more
versatile player than his brother, and
both are expected to contribute along
with the team's already-strong big
men.
The freshman "are doing very

well." Montgomery said. "They've
come into a program that's fairly
strong, in that they've come into a
team that has good, solid players at all
the positions they're playing. Their
ability or even the need for them to
have to step in and be the guy right
away is different, but they've shown
the ability to learn."
Montgomery knows the Cardi
nal's schedule is one of the toughest in
years, but accepts that as the price of
national prominence.
" There's some really good teams
on the schedule, so it'll give us a little
bit of an opportunity to see where we
are." he said. "And of course, if you
can win some of those games, it can
definitely help you on a national
basis, but you have to recognize that
you also run the risk of not being able
to win some of those games."
The schedule includes a date with
(ieorgia in the Wooden ('lassie at the
Anaheim Pond Dec. 6, as well as

CBS-televised games against Con
necticut Feb. 7 and Arizona Feb. 28.
Hut perhaps the most daunting
part ot Stanford's schedule is Pac-1()
play, where the Cardinal must face
defending NCAA champion Ari
zona and three-time defending con
ference champion I'( LA.
"On paper it would look like
everybody else is chasing those two,
and there are probably two or three
teams that would have the best op
portunity to compete against them,
and we think we're one of those
schools," Montgomery said. "1 don't
think anybody's going to concede
anything. Even though Arizona did
win a national championship, they
were fifth in the league."
Though the Cardinal enters the
season with some of the highest ex
pectations in recent history, only time
will tell if it can find a leader to replace
Knight and continue its winning tra
dition.
Coming oil one of its most successful years
in school history, the CCardinal men's basketball
team finds itself with a lot of reasons to smile as
the new season approaches.

■ EXII1BIIIONOPLNLR: Monday, Nov. 10
vs. Silute (Lithuania) at Maples Pavilion.
7:30 p.m.

Not only does Stanford return four starters
from last year's Sweet Sixteen team and own
one of the deepest front lines in the country, but
the ( ardinal also hoasts one of the top recruit
ing classes in the nation by far the most high
ly touted in school history.
Hut behind this lies the lingering question of
how the program will cope with the loss of that
fifth starter, point guard Hrevin Knight. The
Cardinal begins a new era without the Ail-
American whose name had become synony
mous with Stanford basketball.
Junior point guard Ai thin I ,ee will takeover
the reins this year after spending time at both
guard positions and starting in the last 11 games
last season, averaging 7.(i points and 1.8 assists.
1 ec's shooting skills 40 percent from the
field last year, 34 percent from three-point

range will help ensure no opponent lays too
far off. and his quick speed should help his tran
sition to full-time point guard status.
But despite Knight's prominence. Lee feels
perfectly comfortable taking over at the point.
"I've been waiting for this for two years," he
said. "I had a great teacher in Brcvin, and I'm
ready to keep it going, to keep the streak alive.
I know I've just got to plav my game.
"I'm just going to bring the things that I'm
capable of bringing to the table to lead the team.
I here's no pressure It's basketball, it's just hav
ing fun."
Backing up Lee will be senior Kamba
I shionyi, who saw action in 13 games List year
and made five of 16 shots from behind the arc.
Also in the hunt for playing time is freshman
Mike McDonald, one ol Stanford's three new
recruits.
"We feel very confident in Arthur's ability to
handle the job," said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "Kamba certainly ;is a senioi has the
intelligence and the experience to handle the
job, and we're high on Mike McDonald. But
you don't get a Brcvin very often and we have
to realize that and push on from that ami take
advantage of other parts ol the game."

pointers last season in 155 attempts
(42.6 percent, fifth in the conference
and third among returning players).
Wecms averaged 11.7 points and 2.6
rebounds in 30 games.
Behind Wecms. sophomores
David Mosele\ and Ryan Mendez
bring their prolific shooting skills
back to the Farm. Mendez, who
earned honorable mention on the Pa
cific 10 C onference All-Freshman
team, also averaged 42.6 percent
from downtown on 29-of-56 shoot
ing.
Moseley contributed off the bench
last ycai and had ;i career day against
I JSC when he tacked up IM points,
including live three pointers. Along
with Wecms and Mendez. Moseley
will keep defenders honest with his
long-range abilities.

But the team's strongest asset is its
I'ront line, which boasts six players 6-
foot-K or taller, tops in the Pac-10.
Not included in that group is junior
forward Peter Sauer, who is 6-7.
Sauer started 2X games at power for
ward last year and will probably be
moved to the three spot.
The Cardinal's remarkable size
gives il one of the deepest fronteourts
in the country, and the arrival of Ail-
American freshmen twins Jarron and
Jason Collins is creating a buzz
throughout the nation.
"We're going to get the ball inside
a lot so the big guys in there can
pound it away," Lee said. "That'll
create a lot of available shots for the
perimeter players as well. People will
start converging on them, and they'll
be able to kick il out to us."
The front line is anchored by 7-1
center Tim Young, who led the con
ference with K. 4 rebounds per game
and uarnered All Pac-10 Honorable

Mention. I le is second in the league
among returning players with 1.7
blocked shots per game.
Young also averaged 13.7 points
while shooting 50.4 percent, fifth
among returning Pac-1() players. He
is already being touted as an All-
America candidate.
But while many are looking to
Young to become the new leader of
the team, he shies away from the
thought of setting the example.
"I think obviously all of us have to
pick up the responsibility after Brevin
graduated," Young said. "It's not just
the big guys. [ Lee J has to pick it up
and so do the other guards. I think
there's a lot more responsibility on
just playing better as a team."
Sophomore Mark Madsen's in
tensity in practice and in games have
helped make him a big-time contrib
utor. In 25 games last year. Madsen
averaged 5.M points and 5.0 rebounds
in 16.4 minutes.

Junior Mark Seaton and senior
Pete Van Elswyck add to the veteran
experience in the frontcourt. Both
can step up when called on, as they
demonstrated in the second round of
last year's NCAA tournament, when
Young got in foul trouble guarding
