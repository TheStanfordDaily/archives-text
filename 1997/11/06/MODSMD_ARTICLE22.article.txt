Not only does Stanford return four starters
from last year's Sweet Sixteen team and own
one of the deepest front lines in the country, but
the ( ardinal also hoasts one of the top recruit
ing classes in the nation by far the most high
ly touted in school history.
Hut behind this lies the lingering question of
how the program will cope with the loss of that
fifth starter, point guard Hrevin Knight. The
Cardinal begins a new era without the Ail-
American whose name had become synony
mous with Stanford basketball.
Junior point guard Ai thin I ,ee will takeover
the reins this year after spending time at both
guard positions and starting in the last 11 games
last season, averaging 7.(i points and 1.8 assists.
1 ec's shooting skills 40 percent from the
field last year, 34 percent from three-point

range will help ensure no opponent lays too
far off. and his quick speed should help his tran

perfectly comfortable taking over at the point.
"I've been waiting for this for two years," he
said. "I had a great teacher in Brcvin, and I'm
ready to keep it going, to keep the streak alive.
I know I've just got to plav my game.
"I'm just going to bring the things that I'm
capable of bringing to the table to lead the team.
I here's no pressure It's basketball, it's just hav

Backing up Lee will be senior Kamba

and made five of 16 shots from behind the arc.
Also in the hunt for playing time is freshman
Mike McDonald, one ol Stanford's three new
recruits.
"We feel very confident in Arthur's ability to
handle the job," said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "Kamba certainly ;is a senioi has the
intelligence and the experience to handle the
job, and we're high on Mike McDonald. But
you don't get a Brcvin very often and we have
to realize that and push on from that ami take
advantage of other parts ol the game."
