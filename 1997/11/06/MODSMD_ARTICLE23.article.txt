# Is USC victim of its glory daze?
## 
### 
Curious about (his "cool tradition" that Stan
ford marketing coined for Stanford football's
Lid campaign (Lord knows the "Rosy future"
is long gone). I Hipped through The Stanford Daily
archives and noticed something: The Stanford-USC
football game has provided some great games.
Oh sure, there was the barren wasteland from
1976-1990 when the Cardinal managed only one tie
against the likes of Charles White, Marcus Allen, Ted
Tollner and Rodney Peete. But prior to that, espe
cially during the John McKay era, a few of'the games
actually had Rose Bowl implications.

Take 1969, for example. Stanford's one confer
ence loss came against USC when Trojan place-kick
er Ron Ayala kicked a 34-yard field goal to beat the
Cardinal 26-24 on the last play of the game. He had
beaten Stanford with a similar kick the year before, as
Ayala and his teammates repeated as Pacific lOC (in
ference champs.
Stanford exacted sweet revenge the following
year, winning at home 24-14 and springboarding Jim
Plunkett and company to its first Rose Howl bid in 19
seasons.
There was also 1975, played 22 years to the day ol
this season's game. Kicker Mike Langford, who is
also known for winning the 1974 Big (iarne, nailed a
37-yard field goal at the gun to topple the Trojans in
Los Angeles, eliminating USC from the Rose Bowl
race. The win kept Stanford in the hunt until Chuck
Muncie and Cal steamrolled the Card at home two
weeks later.
How things have changed. Las Vegas Bowl, any
one?
Yes. Saturday's game is not exactly making the
hearts of people who were old enough to remember
these games race any faster.
Both teams are 4-4 and 2-3 in conference play.
Both are desperately trying to salvage hopes lost long
ago. My co-editor and our beat writers have already
gone on at great length about how Stanford's monu
mental goals have crumbled like the walls of C iibral
tar, so let's take a look at USC's situation.
Stanford fans are used to seeing sunny prospects
go by the wayside once the conference season starts.
But USC is a program with such a proud tradition
(the football media guide dedicates 144 pages to it)
that its struggles are really quite glaring.
The famed running game has been MIA since the
end of the 19% season. Last year, it could be attrib
uted to an inexperienced offensive line, but with the
offensive line returning intact in 1997. the lack of pro
duction has completely dumbfounded Trojans fans.
The team is ninth in the conference in rushing of
fense. averaging 117 yards a contest and only 3.1 yards
per rushing attempt. Hie team s leading rusher, se-
