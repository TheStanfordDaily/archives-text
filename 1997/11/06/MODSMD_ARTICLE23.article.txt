# Is USC victim of its glory daze?
## 
### 
Curious about (his "cool tradition" that Stan
ford marketing coined for Stanford football's
Lid campaign (Lord knows the "Rosy future"
is long gone). I Hipped through The Stanford Daily
archives and noticed something: The Stanford-USC
football game has provided some great games.
Oh sure, there was the barren wasteland from
1976-1990 when the Cardinal managed only one tie
against the likes of Charles White, Marcus Allen, Ted
Tollner and Rodney Peete. But prior to that, espe
cially during the John McKay era, a few of'the games
actually had Rose Bowl implications.

Take 1969, for example. Stanford's one confer
ence loss came against USC when Trojan place-kick
er Ron Ayala kicked a 34-yard field goal to beat the
Cardinal 26-24 on the last play of the game. He had
beaten Stanford with a similar kick the year before, as
Ayala and his teammates repeated as Pacific lOC (in
ference champs.
Stanford exacted sweet revenge the following
year, winning at home 24-14 and springboarding Jim
Plunkett and company to its first Rose Howl bid in 19
seasons.
There was also 1975, played 22 years to the day ol
this season's game. Kicker Mike Langford, who is
also known for winning the 1974 Big (iarne, nailed a
37-yard field goal at the gun to topple the Trojans in
Los Angeles, eliminating USC from the Rose Bowl
race. The win kept Stanford in the hunt until Chuck
Muncie and Cal steamrolled the Card at home two
weeks later.
How things have changed. Las Vegas Bowl, any
one?
Yes. Saturday's game is not exactly making the
hearts of people who were old enough to remember
these games race any faster.
Both teams are 4-4 and 2-3 in conference play.
Both are desperately trying to salvage hopes lost long
ago. My co-editor and our beat writers have already
gone on at great length about how Stanford's monu
mental goals have crumbled like the walls of C iibral
tar, so let's take a look at USC's situation.
Stanford fans are used to seeing sunny prospects
go by the wayside once the conference season starts.
But USC is a program with such a proud tradition
(the football media guide dedicates 144 pages to it)
that its struggles are really quite glaring.
The famed running game has been MIA since the
end of the 19% season. Last year, it could be attrib
uted to an inexperienced offensive line, but with the
offensive line returning intact in 1997. the lack of pro
duction has completely dumbfounded Trojans fans.
The team is ninth in the conference in rushing of
fense. averaging 117 yards a contest and only 3.1 yards
per rushing attempt. Hie team s leading rusher, se-


Ed
Guzman
nior tailback I )ch>n Washington, has
onl\ yards on the ground, nuni
bcrspast great I rojan tailbacks would
have surpassed by the third game of
the season.
With the running game getting
stuffed, the offensive load has been
plaeed nil the shoulders of new quar
terback lolin Fox. adding to Robin
son's frustrations.
"I feel like we've been regressing
ol fcnsivclv the last couple of weeks,"
Robinson said.
Robinson's return has not helped
much, either I S( has tried to put a

positive spin on Robinson's second
tenure, listing the following accom
plishments in the football media
guide:
"Won more games than any other
Pac-10 team (since IW), captured
two Pac-10 co-championships, won
three postseason bowls, ranked in the
I op 25 poll three times."
I Jnfortunately, when measured up
against what he did the first time
around (three outright conference ti
tles. three Rose Howl wins, three top
two finishes), it's obvious things have
changed for jolly John.
Funny, because when he returned
to I 'SC as successor to the belea
guered Larry Smith, Robinson
promised a return to Trojan football.

i.e. undefeated seasons and national
championships. This was an obvious
dig at Smith, who had moaned about
how logos meant nothing anymore
and the scholarship limitations made
il difficult for I JS( 'toremain a nation
al power.
(iuess a fish gets caught bv open
ing its month, because during Tues
day's weekly press conference,
Robinson was sounding eerily similar
to his predecessor.
" There have been changes where
the haves in one decade may not be
the haves in another decade," Robin
son said. "I think things are more
cyclical and more caught up in those
things now. ourselves included. Two
years ago, we were in the Rose Bowl.

but we were not the dominant team
that year.
"I think that Pac-10 has balanced
out and the scholarship level has bal
anced out. I think you will see cycles
change again and certainly, our pro
gram can come back very fast."
But at what price? Robinson has
already announced that he will resign
it the Trojans don't improve and his
team's erratic play appears to leave
him little choice. Tor every exhilarat
ing win (at Notre Dame), there are
lame efforts like last week's 27-0 loss
at Washington. II USC turns il
around, it will be doing it without
Robinson at the helm.
Flipping through the archives
again, I stumbled on something else.

Prior to the 1979 Stanford-USC
game, coach Robinson, riding a 13-
game winning streak, spoke to The
Stanford Daily's Sally Jenkins and
had the following tidbit when asked
about I JSC being "on top for so long
now."
"I think there are normal cycles. I
also think anyone in California has a
chance to be successful because ol the
enormous amount ol talent out here.
('a I is a very good team, I 'C 1 A. Stan
lord. They all have talent and of
course there's the weather thing."
Sound familiar? But while it was
little more than a throwaway com
ment to a school newspaper at the
time, it has turned into present-day re
ality, and as Smith and Robinson have

shown,a parting shot to the IJSC pro
gram.
To add insult to injury, Larry
Smith has led a mediocre Missouri
program to its first bowl-eligible sea
son since 1983. What was that about
logos?

how logos meant nothing anymore

ing its month, because during Tues
day's weekly press conference,
Robinson was sounding eerily similar
to his predecessor.
" There have been changes where
the haves in one decade may not be
the haves in another decade," Robin
son said. "I think things are more
cyclical and more caught up in those
things now. ourselves included. Two
years ago, we were in the Rose Bowl.

but we were not the dominant team
that year.
"I think that Pac-10 has balanced
out and the scholarship level has bal
anced out. I think you will see cycles
change again and certainly, our pro
gram can come back very fast."
But at what price? Robinson has
already announced that he will resign
it the Trojans don't improve and his
team's erratic play appears to leave
him little choice. Tor every exhilarat
ing win (at Notre Dame), there are
lame efforts like last week's 27-0 loss
at Washington. II USC turns il

Robinson at the helm.
Flipping through the archives
again, I stumbled on something else.

Prior to the 1979 Stanford-USC
game, coach Robinson, riding a 13-
game winning streak, spoke to The
Stanford Daily's Sally Jenkins and
had the following tidbit when asked
about I JSC being "on top for so long
now."
"I think there are normal cycles. I
also think anyone in California has a
chance to be successful because ol the
enormous amount ol talent out here.

Sound familiar? But while it was
little more than a throwaway com
ment to a school newspaper at the
time, it has turned into present-day re
ality, and as Smith and Robinson have

shown,a parting shot to the IJSC pro
gram.
To add insult to injury, Larry
Smith has led a mediocre Missouri
program to its first bowl-eligible sea
son since 1983. What was that about
logos?
