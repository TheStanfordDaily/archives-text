MEN S GOLF

â–  TOMORROW I lIROIK.II SUNDAY: The
Nelson at Stanford (iolf ( ourse

Sponsored hv Stanford alums Clarke and Hetty
Nelson, the event boasts a highly competitive field,
including top-ranked Arkansas and No. 3 Georgia
lech. Ihe first round begins tomorrow morning at X
a.m. and play runs through Sunday.
"With so many top teams, this is definitely one ol
our bigger points tournaments," said freshman
Jimmy Lee. "lt d be nice to have a good showing."
Despite the high level of team play, the top attrac
tion will be a highly anticipated first-round pairing
between Stanford junior Joel Kribel and Georgia
Tech's Matt Kuchar. The two battled lor the U.S.
Amateur title in August, with Kuchar prevailing 2
and 1 in the thrilling 36-holc final.
"This is a great matchup." said head coach Wally
Cioodwin. "Just seeing the level of play between two
of the nation's top collegians should be outstanding."
Apart from any individual subplots, the ( ardinal
looks to rebound from a tough 13th place finish at the

Lexus (iolf ('lassie in I resno, where aside from Kri
bcl's sixtli place finish, no Stanford golfer finished in
the top 50.
"We slipped a little in I resno." (ioodwin said.
"We played well at the Nike ( lassie before that and
hope we've come hack. I he qualifying rounds have
been good and our goal is to look solid and finish 111
the top six or so."
I fiat's a tall order for ;i team as young as (iood
win's. The Card features a pair of sophomores in
Dusty Brett and l ylar I ,unkc and a pair of freshmen
in Jimmy I ee and Alex Aragon. Kribel and Mretl are
the only returning starters on a team short on experi
ence.
"Our team is young, but I'm excited about it.'
(ioodwin said. "I low often do you see a team at this
level with two freshmen in the lineup? It gives you
some /ip, some frolic. Some of the young guys out
there might be a little inconsistent, hut those two are
tough "
Partially offsetting the relative lack of experience
has been the immense talent and strong team chem
istry.
" I liese guys are very compatible and play great
together," (ioodwin said. ' I his team should be very
good before the year is up. They've got all the ingre
dients."
In addition. Stanford should enjoy the home
course advantage, although even the Cardinal
golfers might have trouble with the deeper roughs
and faster greens groomed for this weekend's play.
"It's a home tournament, so of course we'd like a
strong showing from Stanford and we'd like to play
well," said Lee. "It's about time to put it all togctli-
