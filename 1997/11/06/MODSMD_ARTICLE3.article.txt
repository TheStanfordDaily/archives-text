In an effort to debunk what she saw as myths sur
rounding affirmative action and gender inequality, Law
Prof. Deborah Rhode addressed a nearly all-female
group of about 50 yesterday at Tresidder Memorial
Union.
In a speech entitled "Myths of Meritocracy: Affirma
tive Action Under Siege," Rhode challenged critics of
affirmative action who believe that merit should be the
sole criterion in admissions and employment. According
to Rhode, merit has always been accompanied by pref
erential treatment, even before present-day affirmative
action programs.
Rhode, the author of "Speaking of Sex: The Denial of
Gender Inequality," recalled a political cartoon several
years ago that caricatured members of the Clinton ad
ministration as "bean-counters." systematically parcel
ing out cabinet positions like beans to women and mi
norities.
Rhode noted, however, that cabinet positions have
long been parceled out under other criteria, such as
cronyism. "Bean-counting." Rhode said, "is not new in
American political life. What has changed is the type of
beans, and the willingness to count out loud."
Rhode said that Michael Kinsley, editor of the on-line
magazine Slate and noted political pundit, once spoke of
affirmative action as a program that grants white men
"whining rights ... in the victimization bazaar." She
added that affirmative action often serves as a "lightning
rod for white male economic insecurities."
As a result. Rhode said, arguments against aflirma
tive action often spring from group biases or self-inter
est. not from concerns for merit.
Rhode presented college admissions as an example of a
supposedly merit-naseu process mat
began favoring particular groups,
namely children of alumni, long be
fore affirmative action. At one Ivy
league school. Rhode said, the aver
age student's chance of admission was
found to be I in 7; for children of
alumni, the chance was I in 2.
Rhode cited the lirsi Supreme
Court case heard on affirmative ac
tion as an example where seeming
ly objective measurements of merit
are often biased. In the case, a man
sued Santa Clara County for
awarding a job to a woman who
scored three points lower on an
"â€¢objective" scale. While the woman

scored the same as me man on tlie
written portion, she lost points at
the interview stage. As it turned
out. Rhode said, the interviewers
were openly hostile to women can
didates.
Rhode also assailed other well
known arguments against affirma
tive action. According to Rhode, the
argument that affirmative action re
inforces race consciousness ignores
that group stereotyping predated af
firmative action.
Rhode's lecture was the first in
the IW7-9N.ling Lyman I .eellire Se
ries, "Women and Men: Public Poli
cies and Private Lives." organized
by the Institute for Research on
Women and (lender. Rhode, the
I rnest Mcl 'arland Professor of I .aw.
is the former director of the institute.
