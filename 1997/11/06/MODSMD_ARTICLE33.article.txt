## The 						Rothschild Collection: A Journey through Modern Art 
### Vanessa Stich 
"We approach a work of art,"
wrote collector Nanette Rothschild,
"primarily for the joy and excitement
that comes with being possessed by
it, rather than with the possessing of
it".
And indeed, it is the joy and ex
citement of art that is powerfully
conveyed by the impressive pieces in
her collection, now on exhibit at the
San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art. The show, "Encounters with
Modern Art: Works from the Roth
schild Collection," gives us the won
derful chance to share in this captiva
tion by bringing together works
from the luminaries of modern art:
Pablo Picasso, Piet Mondrian, Henri
Matisse, Paul Cezanne, luan Gris,
Constantin Brancusi and Fernand
Leger. "Encounters" chronicles a
rare passion for creative expression
and a near century of artistic and ide
ological innovation.
Herbert and Nanette Rothschild
began collecting after World War II
at the urging of their daughter Ju
dith, herself an abstract painter. The
couple continued to buy art fervent
ly until their deaths in the 19705,
amassing a collection that ranks
among the greatest and largest of its
time. With more than 100 pieces, in
cluding a preponderance of prints
and works on paper, it now fills six
rooms at SFMOMA.
While there are few real "master
pieces" in "Encounters," the collec
tion as a whole is awe-inspiring and
thought-provoking. Perhaps its
greatest strength is its simultaneous
diversity and coherence: "Encoun
ters" spans over five decades of mod
ern art, sweeping across the major
movements of the Rothschild's era
— Futurism, Constructivism, De
Stijl and Cubism — and encompass
ing French, Spanish, Dutch, Italian,
Russian, American and Mexican
artists.

There is a tremendous range of
art represented, yet the show is clear
ly connected by a common theme of
modernity. To walk through "En
counters" is to walk through the early
20th century, following evolutions
(and revolutions) in art, culture and
political ideology.
The first room in "Encounters,"
for example, contains a dynamic
sampling of small drawings and
paintings by the Italian Futurist Gia
como Balla. In the bright vectors and
geometric abstractions of his "Ab
stract Speed" (1912), we can discern
the era's intense fascination with new
technologies, especially the automo
bile. In his later drawings, made after
Uie start of World War I, we can see
how this fascination turned to disil
lusion, with the sharp linear forms of
cars and airplanes dissolving into
naturalistic swirls and free-flowing
curves.

Issues of technology and industri
alization are again expressed in other
rooms of "Encounters," primarily in
the works of French artist Fernand
Liger. Utilizing mixed media collage
and Cubist structural techniques,
L£ger constructed a powerful vision
of th? modern factory in "Untitled"
(1925). "Untitled" seems to lament
the mechanization of humanity,
even as its style and composition
themselves evoke the machine.
Leger's emphasis on industry is
carried on to his later paintings, in
which he examined the state of the
modern worker. "The Builders"
(1953) is a key example of this phase:
its construction workers stare out
from their scaffolding, themselves
living symbols of the city that they
have built. Their figures are almost
cartoon-like, fashioned with simple
thick black lines and devoid of detail.
It is instructive to contrast these
urban portraits with a distinctive wa
tercolor on the opposite wall: the
beautiful "Man with Lettuce" (1937)
by Diego Rivera. Although the Mex
ican artist also creates his figure with
a strong black outline, the "Man with
lettuce" represents a very different
mode of production. Unlike "The
Builders," Rivera's worker is painted
with rich, earthy colors and organic,
curving shapes. This is still a natural,
agrarian world, yet to be trans
formed by the stark forces of indus
trialization.
It is juxtapositions like these that
make the Rothschild collection so
engaging for both the serious stu
dent of art history and the novice art
lover. "Encounters" is so large and
varied, it offers infinite opportunities
to compare, contrast and ultimately
learn. Everyone is sure to find works

that they can personally connect to
and enjoy.
One painting that has drawn par
ticular attention is Piet Mondrian's
abstract vision, "Tableau No. IV"
(1924), positioned as the centerpiece
of the exhibition. In this diamond
shaped composition, the Dutch
painter has reduced art to its essential
elements —black lines, basic squares
and vivid primary colors — and
arranged these elements in an ab
stract grid.
Working within these fundamen
tal limitations, Mondrian investi
gates our process of perception and

creates a painting
that is simultane
ously simple and
complex, expres
sive and enigmat
ic. "Tableau" is
hung with earlier,
more impres
sionistic Mondri
ans, allowing us
to trace his grad
ual movement
from representa
tion to abstrac
tion. The other
Mondrian works
are not stellar, but
it is a fascinating
and educational
journey
nonetheless.
Another truly
exceptional addi
tion to the Roth
schild collection
is "Bottle of Anis
de Mono"
(1914), by the
Spanish Cubist
Juan Gris. Here
Gris has clearly
realized the car
dinal Cubist ob
jectives: he has
broken down and
rearranged the

components of the bottle, freeing his
image from conventional represen
tation.
We no longer imagine "Bottle" as
a three-dimensional object, but as a
set of shapes and forms that has
somehow been unfolded onto the
one-dimensional plane of the can
vas. We can still see the bottle, but it
now exists in a new realm of abstrac
tion and perception. "Bottle" is an
intriguing puzzle for the viewer and,
with its deep brown colors and well
balanced design, also realizes a
unique sort of beauty.
As if outstanding selections like
"Bottle" and "Tableau" weren't
enough, SFMOMA has also present
ed a set of European modernist
works on paper from its own perma
nent collection in a room alongside
the Rothschild collection itself. In-

eluded are pieces from Picasso, Ma
tisse, Rivera, Mondrian and the fore
runner of modern art, Cezanne.
While these drawings and prints are
primarily studies rather than large
scale paintings, this room is never
theless breathtaking. In these small
works, we find the unmistakable
mark of genius. It is an exciting expe
rience simply to share the same space
as these works and, in doing so, forge
your own connection with the great
est artists of our time.
All in all, "Encounters" is well
worth a trip to the city. In fact, it
probably warrants a repeat visit in

order to fully appreciate the vast
number of artworks on display. Ju
dith Rothschild once commented
that "art is to felt, not understood,'
and the feeling that pervades this
show is overwhelmingly positive. Sec
"Encounters" and let some of the
Rothschilds' passion for art rub off
on you.

"We approach a work of art,"
wrote collector Nanette Rothschild,
"primarily for the joy and excitement
that comes with being possessed by
it, rather than with the possessing of
it".
And indeed, it is the joy and ex
citement of art that is powerfully
conveyed by the impressive pieces in
her collection, now on exhibit at the
San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art. The show, "Encounters with
Modern Art: Works from the Roth
schild Collection," gives us the won
derful chance to share in this captiva
tion by bringing together works
from the luminaries of modern art:
Pablo Picasso, Piet Mondrian, Henri
Matisse, Paul Cezanne, luan Gris,
Constantin Brancusi and Fernand
Leger. "Encounters" chronicles a
rare passion for creative expression
and a near century of artistic and ide
ological innovation.
Herbert and Nanette Rothschild
began collecting after World War II
at the urging of their daughter Ju
dith, herself an abstract painter. The
couple continued to buy art fervent
ly until their deaths in the 19705,
amassing a collection that ranks
among the greatest and largest of its
time. With more than 100 pieces, in
cluding a preponderance of prints
and works on paper, it now fills six
rooms at SFMOMA.
While there are few real "master
pieces" in "Encounters," the collec
tion as a whole is awe-inspiring and
thought-provoking. Perhaps its
greatest strength is its simultaneous
diversity and coherence: "Encoun
ters" spans over five decades of mod
ern art, sweeping across the major
movements of the Rothschild's era
— Futurism, Constructivism, De
Stijl and Cubism — and encompass
ing French, Spanish, Dutch, Italian,
Russian, American and Mexican
artists.

There is a tremendous range of
art represented, yet the show is clear
ly connected by a common theme of
modernity. To walk through "En
counters" is to walk through the early
20th century, following evolutions
(and revolutions) in art, culture and
political ideology.
The first room in "Encounters,"
for example, contains a dynamic
sampling of small drawings and
paintings by the Italian Futurist Gia
como Balla. In the bright vectors and
geometric abstractions of his "Ab
stract Speed" (1912), we can discern
the era's intense fascination with new
technologies, especially the automo
bile. In his later drawings, made after
Uie start of World War I, we can see
how this fascination turned to disil
lusion, with the sharp linear forms of
cars and airplanes dissolving into
naturalistic swirls and free-flowing
curves.

Issues of technology and industri
alization are again expressed in other
rooms of "Encounters," primarily in
the works of French artist Fernand
Liger. Utilizing mixed media collage
and Cubist structural techniques,
L£ger constructed a powerful vision
of th? modern factory in "Untitled"
(1925). "Untitled" seems to lament
the mechanization of humanity,
even as its style and composition
themselves evoke the machine.
Leger's emphasis on industry is
carried on to his later paintings, in
which he examined the state of the
modern worker. "The Builders"
(1953) is a key example of this phase:
its construction workers stare out
from their scaffolding, themselves
living symbols of the city that they
have built. Their figures are almost
cartoon-like, fashioned with simple
thick black lines and devoid of detail.
It is instructive to contrast these
urban portraits with a distinctive wa
tercolor on the opposite wall: the
beautiful "Man with Lettuce" (1937)
by Diego Rivera. Although the Mex
ican artist also creates his figure with
a strong black outline, the "Man with
lettuce" represents a very different
mode of production. Unlike "The
Builders," Rivera's worker is painted
with rich, earthy colors and organic,
curving shapes. This is still a natural,
agrarian world, yet to be trans
formed by the stark forces of indus
trialization.
It is juxtapositions like these that
make the Rothschild collection so
engaging for both the serious stu
dent of art history and the novice art
lover. "Encounters" is so large and
varied, it offers infinite opportunities
to compare, contrast and ultimately
learn. Everyone is sure to find works

that they can personally connect to
and enjoy.
One painting that has drawn par
ticular attention is Piet Mondrian's
abstract vision, "Tableau No. IV"
(1924), positioned as the centerpiece
of the exhibition. In this diamond
shaped composition, the Dutch
painter has reduced art to its essential
elements —black lines, basic squares
and vivid primary colors — and
arranged these elements in an ab
stract grid.
Working within these fundamen
tal limitations, Mondrian investi
gates our process of perception and

creates a painting
that is simultane
ously simple and
complex, expres
sive and enigmat
ic. "Tableau" is
hung with earlier,
more impres
sionistic Mondri
ans, allowing us
to trace his grad
ual movement
from representa
tion to abstrac
tion. The other
Mondrian works
are not stellar, but
it is a fascinating
and educational
journey
nonetheless.
Another truly
exceptional addi
tion to the Roth
schild collection
is "Bottle of Anis
de Mono"
(1914), by the
Spanish Cubist
Juan Gris. Here
Gris has clearly
realized the car
dinal Cubist ob
jectives: he has
broken down and
rearranged the

components of the bottle, freeing his
image from conventional represen
tation.
We no longer imagine "Bottle" as
a three-dimensional object, but as a
set of shapes and forms that has
somehow been unfolded onto the
one-dimensional plane of the can
vas. We can still see the bottle, but it
now exists in a new realm of abstrac
tion and perception. "Bottle" is an
intriguing puzzle for the viewer and,
with its deep brown colors and well
balanced design, also realizes a
unique sort of beauty.
As if outstanding selections like
"Bottle" and "Tableau" weren't
enough, SFMOMA has also present
ed a set of European modernist
works on paper from its own perma
nent collection in a room alongside
the Rothschild collection itself. In-

eluded are pieces from Picasso, Ma
tisse, Rivera, Mondrian and the fore
runner of modern art, Cezanne.
While these drawings and prints are
primarily studies rather than large
scale paintings, this room is never
theless breathtaking. In these small
works, we find the unmistakable
mark of genius. It is an exciting expe
rience simply to share the same space
as these works and, in doing so, forge
your own connection with the great
est artists of our time.
All in all, "Encounters" is well
worth a trip to the city. In fact, it
probably warrants a repeat visit in

order to fully appreciate the vast
number of artworks on display. Ju
dith Rothschild once commented
that "art is to felt, not understood,'
and the feeling that pervades this
show is overwhelmingly positive. Sec
"Encounters" and let some of the
Rothschilds' passion for art rub off
on you.
