## Kiss of the Spider Woman 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Describing the horrors of the 1970s
Argentinian political regime in musical
form is hard to pull off.
The flaws in taking on such politi
cally charged and inherently serious is
sues in a traditionally happy-go-lucky
format are obvious in Terrence McNal
ly's "Kiss of the Spider Woman." But
Theatre Works' presentation of the
Tony Award-winning musical com
bines superb choreography with excel
lent acting to overcome most of those
problems.
It's still a little uncomfortable to find
yourself laughing while prisoners are
being tortured and are coming ever
closer to encountering the Spider
Woman's kiss of death. There is so
much sadness and pain in the stories of
prisoners Molina and Valentin, who
share a small cell and eventually much
more of their lives.
Molina (Francis Jue) has been incar
cerated for having sex with a young boy
in a restroom. He is unapologetically
gay, which seems remarkable consider
ing his position in society and history.
He's been in the cell for a few years
when a political prisoner, Valentin (lay
Montgomery), storms in with a revolu
tionary furor. The contrasts are imme
diately obvious: One is entrenched in
the world's bitter reality; the other is
lost in the world's escape, film.
Molina's escape of choice is the film
work of Aurora (F.lena Ferrante), who's
most disturbing role was that of the Spi
der Woman. The actress, too, empha
sizes the contrasts inherent in humani
ty. Most of her roles offer the perfect es
cape to an imaginary land, but as the

Spider Woman, she dealt with the most
bitter reality of all — death.
What makes "Kiss of the Spider
Woman" intriguing is how the con
trasts are blurred. By the end, it's not
clear who believes in what anymore, or
who feels what, or who is more in tune
with reality.
Jue and Montgomery complement
each other well as actors, making their
stories compelling. Both men show
considerable acting, singing and danc
ing skills, allowing for a smooth perfor
mance of a complex show.
The leads have clearly earned their
roles. Along with Ferrante, Jue and
Montgomery stand out with their tal
ents. The rest of the cast is more than
adequate, with the exception of the
Warden (Ron Obreg6n). Obreg6n
plays the role stiffly — but whether he
does this because he's trying to make
the guard look formal or because he's
uncomfortable with his lines isn't clear.
"Kiss of the Spider Woman" pushes
its cast to the limit. Nearly the entire
script is sung, requiring powerful vocal
skills. Montgomery especially demon
strates an impressive range and talent.
A lot of the dancing is very physical,
and the cast shows remarkable en
durance, especially during the 90-
minute first half.
The show's technical work is no less
exhausting. Lighting and sound are not
too complicated, but the set is elaborate
and is moved extensively every few
minutes.
The set consists of a series of bars,
the walls to prison cells. There are sev
eral layers of these, creating an impres
sion of how big the jail is. From the
middle of this mess emerges Molina
and Valentin's tiny room.
T"he entire stage is framed by a dif

ferent interpretation of the metal bars
— they are bent to create the edges of a
spider web. This web serves not only to
frame the stage nicely but it also acts as
a constant reminder that the Spider
Woman and her kiss of death remain
near.
Ferrante probably has the most de
manding part of all. As Aurora, she acts
out not only roles in her movies but
parts in Molina's dreams (and, eventu
ally, Valentin's dreams). She also does a
lot of climbing on that web.
Ferrante's skill is obvious both as a
soloist and as part of an ensemble. Her
powerful voice needs no backup, but
when she joins in a song or dance, she
doesn't assert herself too much.
The women in the prisoner's lives
— Molina's mother (Jeanne Cuffey)
and Valentin's girlfriend, Marta
(Jacqueline McSwanson) also balance
well with each other in duets. And the
ensemble cast of prisoners dances per
fectly in step, showing off the excellent
choreography of Bick Goss, who com
bines jazz, ballroom and modern dance
styles to create a frenzy of act ion that in
tensities the performance.
The Theatre Works production of
Kiss of the Spider Woman," directed by
Robert Kelley, succeeds in pulling to
gether a cohesive and engaging pertor
mance from a complicated set ot issues
and ideas.
