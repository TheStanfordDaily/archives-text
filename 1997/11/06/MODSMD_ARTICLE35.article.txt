## Something's Shaking On Harrison Street: The JGB Band, The David Nelson Band, Juggling Suns 
### Zachary Roberts Editorial staff 
In the city that Jerry Garcia built, the friends of
the late musician have kept it together.
It's somewhat surprising that the JGB Band
(formerly the Jerry Garcia Band) has persevered de
spite losing their linchpin. But in the city of San
Francisco, any band that plays Grateful Dead tunes
knows that it will at least get a listen.
The thing is, cover bands should be exactly that
— cover bands. But on Saturday night at the Mar
itime Hall on Harrison Street, the retooled JGB
Band played more Grateful Dead than it did lerry
Garcia.
The difference is important. Garcia was the
leader of the Dead, but he also had numerous
side projects that sounded very different from
the Grateful Dead. A partial list includes the Jerry
Garcia Band, New Riders of the Purple Sage
(country blues), Old and In The Way (blue
grass), Reconstruction (jazz-funk fusion) and
the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band (traditional
folk).
Starting in 1974, the Jerry Garcia Band played
much more soulful, R&B style rock than the Dead
ever did. It was, in fact, almost bizarre to hear the
JGB Band open its set with the classic Dead tune
"Shakedown Street" from the 1977 album of the
same name.
After that surreal, funky start, the JGB Band got
down to business. The set was well built and solid
from start to end, and it climaxed with a fast med
ley of traditionals. Along the way, the JGB Band

visited such classic Dead tunes as "Not Fade
Away" and "Franklin's Tower," but also paid trib
ute to the Jerry Garcia Band with "That's What
lx)ve Will Make You Do" and "Brothers And Sis

ters," two songs prominent in the Jerry Garcia
Band annals.
By the time of Jerry"s death in August 1995, the
Jerry Garcia Band had seen over a dozen members

come and go. At its core, the
JGB Band — who, through the
name change, has clearly rele
gated itself to the role of cover
band — is comprised of four
members that had been with the
Jerry Garcia Band since 1986:
the charismatic Melvin Seals on
organ, David Kempler on
drums and Gloria Jones and Ja
clyn Laßranch on backing vo
cals.
It is a testament to Garcia
that the JGB Band needs three
more members (two guitarists
and a vocalist) to replace that
unique musician.
But the story of the evening
was The David Nelson Band
(also known as the Freaks of
Nature). Playing as the first half
of the double bill, the band
completely upstaged the JGB
Band with a blistering, almost
two-hour long set.
The history of Nelson and
Garcia predates the Grateful
Dead: in the early 1960s the
two formed The Wildwood
Boys, a traditional folk band.
This connection brought

David into the short lived project The Jerry Garcia
Acoustic Band, which broke all previous Broad
way box-office records during an 18-day run in
the winter of 1987.
Nelson also helped Garcia found The New Rid
ers Of The Purple Sage in 1969, in which they ex
plored the connections of country, blues, folk and
psychedelic rock.
The David Nelson Band began its almost two
hour set with "John Hardy's Wedding," a tight
country blues. Nelson's voice is commanding; low
and gravelly, he sounded like a cowboy and played
guitar like one too.
The set wended its way from steel-pedal slide
guitar honky-tonk to insane psychedelia. Standouts
included "The Wizard's Son" and a long, drumless
psychedelic jam that sounded like it came straight
off of a vintage Dead bootleg (where it would be la
beled "Space").
The up-and-coming east-coast jam band, Jug
gling Suns (formerly Solar Circus), opened the
show with a well received, 45-minute set. In its San
Francisco debut, Juggling Suns choose to stick to
original tunes, and the mostly twenty-something
dread-headed audience dug the eclectic rhythms
and mixolydian solos.
I'd jump at the chance to hear the David Nelson
Band again or the Juggling Suns for that matter. The
music of the David Nelson Band is soulful and grip
ping, and the Juggling Suns have potential, but the
JGB Band is another story. Dead cover bands are
proliferating more than ever before, and if the JGB
Band wants to be anything but a cover band, it
needs to come up with a way to hold the audience's
attention.
