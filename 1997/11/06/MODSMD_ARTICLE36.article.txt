## elektra 
### Benjamin Lawrance Contributing writer 
The reworking of the bloodiest tale from ancient Greece, the
fall of Troy, is the subject of San Francisco Opera's "Elektra." The
sacking of the city is arguably the most popular story of the liter
ary theatrical genre. Seldom does vengeance hold such complete
sway throughout an entire play. Richard Strauss' opera requires
extreme dedication and precision on the part of the conductor
(Jiri Kout) and orchestra. The one-act format of a play, which is
longer and more torturous than most, results in shorter dynamic
scenes. It also demands coherent and efficient scene changes from
the director (Andrei Serban).
"Elektra" is dominated by a dynamic feminine triumvirate.
Elektra (Elizabeth Connell), Chrysothemis (Frances Ginzer),
Agamemnon's daughters and Klytemnestra (Jane Henschel), his
wife, are suffering and distraught. They have been plotted and
connived against and betrayed. Decades of warfare have taken
their toll and all three seek personal retribution.
Elektra is possessed by the memory of her father and, while
awaiting the return of her brother Orest (Alan Held), determines
to avenge his blood. Hers is a merciless character, one which ter
rifies the audience. Chrysothemis is prudent, disdainful of re
venge and tries to redirect her sister's hatred. She is poignant and
empathetic, but essentially ineffective. The role requires a melan
cholic submissiveness. Klytemnestra, on the other hand, is majes
tic due to her recent victory. The death of her husband Agamem
non, Elektra's father, has left the coast clear for her and her lover
Aegisth (Jon Mac Master). But she is unaware of the depth of Elek
tra's hatred and her quest for blood.
As the scenes unfolded and rotated, they enveloped and uti
lized the space created by Yannis Kokkos' spectacular set designs.
They throbbed around the sacrifices and bubbling cauldrons. The

staging, a workhouse meets royal palace, was guarded by shaved
head slave-drivers with whips. Turning on a central axis, the ani
mosity of each particular scene was dictated by lighting and
smoke.
Serban and Kokkos gripped the Trojan bull by the horns with
a dark and expressive staging, creating a variety of spaces â€” regal,
sepulchral, monumental. Agamemnon's memorial was by far the
most impressive scene. Connell danced before her father's image,
though with greater ecstasy her death would have proved more
convincing. A descending bovine carcass accentuated this momu
mentalism.
Connell is always an exciting performer. Though her dancing
was dull, her voice was quite the opposite. In the scenes before her
father's image, she delivered a full and exuberant tone. She cried
out and projected the true torment of parricide. Ginzer, as her sib
ling, was an excellent compliment. In her last solo moments she
stole the scene.
Henschel was a superb Klytemnestra; the feuding scenes were
carried by her regal presence. She wore traditionally sumptuous
operatic garb. Held, Mac Master and Orest's tutor (John Relyea)
were all fine. A bit bizarre was Orest's costume. He came in un
shaven and ragged, though of royal blood. This struck me as par
ticularly strange considering his handsome and well-kept tutor.
The lesser female roles were well cast and their
bondage / concentration camp attire added brutality. The second
(Sheng Gao) and third maidservants (Elizabeth Bishop) were es
pecially gripping. Likewise, the rich textures of Klytemnestra's
confidante (Nicolle Foland) and her trainbearer (Alison
Buchanan) were a very enjoyable ensemble. San Francisco's cast
offered ambitious and dramatic unity.
The entire production roared on swiftly. Kout gave careful at
tention to the difficult transitional passages accompanying the
scene changes. My pleasure was only dampened by excessive
blood-letting in the final scene. Over the top, there seemed more
corpses lying around than there were live actors at any one mo

ment throughout the opera.
Though not an ideal Sunday afternoon matinee, this produc
tion of "Elektra" is an enticing and lusty rendition and truly elec
trifying.
It runs at the War Memorial Opera House Nov. 8 and 13
Tickets can be purchased at the Box Office (415) 864 3330.
