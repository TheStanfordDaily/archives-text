# Oh Joy, Oh Rapture Unforeseen:
## The 						Stanford Savoyards Sail the "H.M.S. Pinafore" Into Dinkelspiel 
### Karin West 
The music that skipped down the hill was as crisp as the fall
morning breeze on which it was carried. It left no doubt that they
were here and ready to set their sails into that breeze.
"They" are the Stanford Savoyards, a group of light opera en
thusiasts who delight in performing two Gilbert and Sullivan shows
on the Stanford campus each year. The melodies dancing through
the autumn air were from a final rehearsal of "H.M.S. Pinafore," the
classic work chosen by the Savoyards to open their 25th anniversary
season this Friday, Nov. 7, at 8 p.m. at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The love these artists have for the work of the 18th century
British duo is evident in the rehearsal's atmosphere. Performers
and production staff alike joked with each other in an easy cama
raderie, yet the professionalism with which the cast moved through
the music and choreography demonstrated the seriousness with
which the company takes its craft.
The Savoyards: An Enthusiastic Crew
The Savoy Theatre in London was built in 1881 expressly for the
productions of William S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan; the 14 light
operas composed by the duo are consequently also known as "The
Savoy Operas." That term was adopted by the group of faculty and
students that formed the company in 1973.
In the years since the Savoyards' creation, the group has ex
panded to include community members and alumni as well. Many
members cited this unique blend of experience and background as
one of the company's strengths.
"It's really an international group," said Bob Bergman, who is
playing Captain Corcoran in the production. "We have people
from practically every continent in this show, and you don't always
have that in a community group."
Bergman knows of what he speaks, as this is his seventh involve
ment with a staging of "H.M.S. Pinafore" and his third portrayal of
Captain Corcoran. He has been involved with the Savoyards since
1990 and enjoys the rapport of "lots of people who have been work
ing together for lots of years."
The 100-plus performers who make up the Savoyards reflect the
diversity of Stanford, the Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay
Area. The group is also the only Gilbert and Sullivan company in
the country to boast five Nobel Prize winners, all of whom are
members of Stanford's faculty: William Sharpeand Kenneth Arrow
in economics and Burton Richter, Richard Taylor and Doug Os
heroff in physics.
"All the Nobel Prize winners I've ever met have been through
this group," said Neil Midkiff, who is a production assistant and ac
companist on piano for this fall's production. Midkiff has been in
volved in some capacity with every Savoyard production since
1981. He noted that the group was also an excellent forum in which
students could interact with professionals from the school and
community. "Many of the performers get paid to sing with other
people.. .and it's a unique opportunity for students to work along
side them on stage and learn things from them."
Leslie Cho, a Stanford senior who is performing for the first time
with the Savoyards, agreed. "It's so nice to meet people from out in
the community, " she said. "There is such a high level of profes
sionalism, and the Savoyards are so good at what they're doing. All
the people here love singing so much — and it's a lot of fun!"
"The Lass that Loved a Sailor"
The theme of lovers kept apart by conditions beyond their con
trol is common to many Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The story of
"H.M.S. Pinafore" follows this pattern, as the central story revolves
around lovers who cannot be together because of inequality in their
social ranks.
Ralph (played by Marco Remedios) is a lowly young sailor in the

British Navy who serves on the H.M.S. Pinafore. Ralph falls in love
with the lovely Josephine (Kathleen Robinson), who is the daugh
ter of Captain Corcoran (Bergman), the ship's commander; she
loves Ralph as well, but feels forced to spurn his affections because
of their differences in social class.
Captain Corcoran has a good rapport with and is respected by
his crew of loyal British "tars." He, too, is also separated from love
because of his rank in life; his affections are directed toward the
buxom peddler-woman Little Buttercup (Christie Young), who
regularly vends her wares to the sailors aboard the Pinafore.
The Captain has meanwhile made socially acceptable arrange
ments for his daughter to marry Sir Joseph Porter (Mark Blattel),
the First Lord of the Admiralty. Sir Joseph is quite the cream of the
upper crust. Although he's the highest officer in the Royal Navy, he
knows almost nothing about sailing — he worked his way up the

ranks from the position of a clerk by polishing door handles and
without ever setting foot on a ship.
In furthering the theme of social strata differences, Sir Joseph
encourages the crew by telling them that they deserve courteous
treatment from their captain and are worthy men — although not
nearly as worthy as himself, of course.
Sir Joseph arrives on the Pinafore with his cousin Hebe (Gosia
Holsztynska) and a group of female relatives who accompany him
throughout his travels.
Sir Joseph's female companions join with the manly Pinafore
crew to comprise the show's chorus. Gilbert and Sullivan's choral
ensembles play a unique role within the structure of the story. With
an identity unto itself, the chorus' role within the show is crucial to
plot exposition, explained Mark Baushke, who plays Dick Deadeye.
"It acts as an individual character."
The Savoy Operas have "none of the artificial distinction be
tween chorus and cast," said Midkiff. "Unlike other operas where
the chorus is just background, this ensemble is integral to plots and
music in nearly all [Gilbert and Sullivan] shows."
The chorus lends a sympathetic ear to the plight of Ralph and
Josephine. When the captain's daughter, no longer able to tolerate
Sir Joseph's pompous and self-righteous nature, finally confesses

her love to Ralph, the ladies and sailors of the crew hel the cou
ple plan to steal ashore and marry secretly.
The nefarious Dick Deadeye (Batik) is the essence of villainy and
is reviled by the rest of the crew. Deadeye enables Captain Corco
ran to discover the plans of Josephine and her sailor to eiope. Cor
coran is so enraged by the event that he swears aloud 'Damn!"
The degree to which this outburst shocks the crew and provokes
the scorn of the ever-proper Sir Joseph reinforces the iheme of
class expectations in the plot. The incident also foresnadows a
shakeup in the ranks. ..
Suddenly, Little Buttercup stuns the ship's company by reveal
ing a dark secret that she has been hinting the entire show: work
ing as a nurse many years ago, she practiced "baby-farming". She
then reveals that two of the infants she cared for were none other
than Ralph and Captain Corcoran, whom she had inadvertently
switched at birth!
Because the revelation leaves Corcoran well below his former
social station, a marriage between Sir Joseph and Josephine is also
rendered unacceptable. Happily for Corcoran and l.itlla Butter
cup, they, too, are now allowed to marry.
The oh-so-noble Sir Joseph is left temporarily without a part
ner, but he soon resigns to marry his cousin Hebe — pt tiaps the
inevitable fate of many a British royal.
Sailors and relatives alike celebrate the inevitable tnamph of
true love, although the sudden reversal ofdass distinctions ends up
reinforcing the exact divisions satirized by Gilbert's scrip .
Launching the Performance at Dinkelspiel
The Savoyards are plunging into their production ot "H.M.S.
Pinafore" with energy and dedication. Music Director I Jul Zaw
ilski has obviously highlighted the critical importance 01. nsp pro
nunciation for the singers. The clever word structure supporting
Gilbert's trademark sharp satire and sarcasm would be *>t on an
audience that is unable to decipher the lyrics.
And does" Pinafore" have lyrics! The task of mastering die rapid
pace and intricate text of the more lively songs is daunting, espe
cially when all the members of the chorus lend their voices to the
effort. The Savoyards' chorus, however, generally does a solid job
of keeping its diction crisp and the fast-moving melodie- light.

The cast's offstage rapport transfers well to the stage, as the
actors interact with each other and the script's humorous text
quite effectively.
Bergman and Blattel in particular create character traits
that are lightly overplayed in a manner very appropriate for
their classic G&S roles as commanding officers. Blattel brings
an irresistible pomposity to the overstuffed Sir Joseph, partic
ularly recalling his rise to glory in "When I was a lad."
Bergman creates just the right balance between the captain's
certain — well, almost certain — authority and his more
human ability to banter as he sings to "My gallant crew." Both
actors sing with confidence and move through the intricate
lyrics with apparent ease
Remedios' Ralph also lights up the stage with his soaring
tenor. He sails through the romantic melodies with sincerity
and grace, even when he is on the verge of taking his life rather
than living without Josephine ("Can I survive this overbear
ing?").
Robinson holds her own as the only student among the
lead players. Although her characterization of Josephine occa
sionally lacks the same confidence of her more experienced
counterparts, her clear soprano voice captures Josephine's
youthful innocence well, especially as she anguishes over her
love for Ralph in "Sorry her lot."
Young brings a flirtatious charm to her portrayal of the
working-class Little Buttercup, and her characterizations
play up nicely the double meaning of the "Things are sel
dom what they seem" duet with Captain Corcoran.
Baushke also brings the stereotypical villain-you-love
to-hate Dick Deadeye (who, of course, wears an eye patch!)
alive with an exaggerated Scottish brogue.
The classic score is supported by simple and effective
choreography and staging. And the full company's perfor
mances behind Sir Joseph's "I am the monarch of the sea,"
"Carefully on tiptoe stealing," and the finale are polished
and well-crafted.
G&S First Hit Show Sailed Rough Waters
"H.M.S. Pinafore" debuted in London's Opera
Comique Theatre on May 25, 1978. Unusually hot sum
mer weather kept audiences away at first, but by August,
Gilbert and Sullivan's fourth creation was well on its way
to becoming their first popular success.
Ironically, the show's "merry and spontaneous" music
was composed by Arthur Sullivan while he was suffering
from an extremely painful kidney disease. Sullivan himself
recalled, "1 would compose a few bars, and then be almost

insensible from pain... never was music written under such
disturbing conditions."
After Sullivan's health improved, collaboration with his
lyricist partner continued and soon the carefully crafted piece
was cast and being meticulously rehearsed.
"H.M.S. Pinafore" was performed a remarkable 571 times
during its initial run. Even by today's standards, this incredi
ble run illustrates the incredible popularity the show eventu
ally achieved.
Soon, nearby theaters opened rival productions and a wave
of "Pinafore mania" spread through Europe.
The enthusiasm reached "over the bright blue sea," as the
show's most unexpected success came from the United States.
In early 1879, a London Times newspaper correspondent in
Boston reported, "Such a furor as this opera has created 1 have
never known before in the history of the American stage."
"Pinafore" was playing in six Boston theaters within four
months of its debut there, and in as many venues in Philadel
phia and New York. Even audiences in the southern and west
ern parts of the country were soon humming the familiar
strains after performances in those areas.
One measure of the musical's incredible success was the
way in which music and quips from the script became popu

larized in conversations of the time. When Corcoran sings
out to his crew about the qualities that make him an ad
mirable captain, he assures them he never gets seasick or
swears aloud. "What, never?" asks the crew; Corcoran hes
itates: "We 11... hardly ever!" he admits.
"Pinafore"-crazed fans everywhere adopted the phrase
into their everyday conversations. In their 1914 book
"Gilbert and Sullivan and Their Operas," Francois Cellier
and Cunningham Bridgeman noted that the phrase "be
came a British proverb more familiar to all sorts and con
ditions of men and women than the Prince of Denmark's
famous "To be, or not to be."
In 1878, an frustrated American newspaper editor grew
weary of seeing the phrase woven into nearly every article
in the paper, regardless of topic. He gathered his reporters
together and informed them that they were no longer al
lowed to quote the line in their stories. Unable to resist the
opportunity, the reporters shouted back, "What, never?!"
Relinquishing, the editor had no choice but to reply: "Well,
hardly ever."
Unfortunately for the opera's creators, copyright agree
ments were not held with the United States at the time, so
they received no financial compensation from any of the
pirated American shows. Worse, in Gilbert and Sullivan's
view, was the fact that great liberties were taken in the pro

duct i on
of the
American
shows, so
that the
script,
music
and char
act e t s
were
some
times
barely
recogniz
able as
originat
ing in
their
original

"Pinafore." Determined to re-claim the
rights to their work, Gilbert and Sullivan
themselves opened an 'authorized' pro
duction of "Pinafore" in New York on
Dec. 1, 1879.
The "Pinafore's" Timeless Appeal
""PINAFORE" made a hit in New
York the other night. .. how well that
tripping Sullivan music wears; how fresh
those Gilbert jokes seem after a third of a
century!" The words of journalist 11 1..
Menken, written for the "Baltimore
Evening Sun" in 1911, still apply to
Gilbert and Sullivan shows — even 8(i
years after he wrote them.
The Savoy Operas continue to be a
phenomenon for modern audiences,
who can relate to the themes and satirical
humor of Gilbert and Sullivan's work.
"It's great to be having this much fun
doing musicals that are over 100 years
old," said Mark Baushke, who plays

"Deadeye Dick" in the production. "They are really timeless
sets of stories."
"I would encourage everyone out there who's never been
to a Gilbert and Sullivan show to come see it,"he said of
"H.M.S. Pinafore." "It really is a story about being from the
wrong side of the tracks."
Kathleen Robinson, a junior who is playing the role of
Josephine, agreed. This is her first performance with the Savo
yards, and she encouraged students to come to a performance
because "the show is absolutely hysterical and is a ton of fun!"
Desiree Ong, a junior majoring in symbolic systems and
also participating in her first Savoyard production, described
the company as a unique benefit for Stanford students. "It's
more professional than other drama groups on campus," she
said, "and it's a great benefit for students to be able to see a
professional show right here at Stanford."

"They" are the Stanford Savoyards, a group of light opera en
thusiasts who delight in performing two Gilbert and Sullivan shows
on the Stanford campus each year. The melodies dancing through
the autumn air were from a final rehearsal of "H.M.S. Pinafore," the
classic work chosen by the Savoyards to open their 25th anniversary
season this Friday, Nov. 7, at 8 p.m. at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The love these artists have for the work of the 18th century
British duo is evident in the rehearsal's atmosphere. Performers
and production staff alike joked with each other in an easy cama
raderie, yet the professionalism with which the cast moved through
the music and choreography demonstrated the seriousness with
which the company takes its craft.
The Savoyards: An Enthusiastic Crew
The Savoy Theatre in London was built in 1881 expressly for the
productions of William S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan; the 14 light
operas composed by the duo are consequently also known as "The
Savoy Operas." That term was adopted by the group of faculty and
students that formed the company in 1973.
In the years since the Savoyards' creation, the group has ex
panded to include community members and alumni as well. Many
members cited this unique blend of experience and background as
one of the company's strengths.
"It's really an international group," said Bob Bergman, who is
playing Captain Corcoran in the production. "We have people
from practically every continent in this show, and you don't always
have that in a community group."
Bergman knows of what he speaks, as this is his seventh involve
ment with a staging of "H.M.S. Pinafore" and his third portrayal of
Captain Corcoran. He has been involved with the Savoyards since
1990 and enjoys the rapport of "lots of people who have been work
ing together for lots of years."
The 100-plus performers who make up the Savoyards reflect the
diversity of Stanford, the Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay
Area. The group is also the only Gilbert and Sullivan company in
the country to boast five Nobel Prize winners, all of whom are
members of Stanford's faculty: William Sharpeand Kenneth Arrow
in economics and Burton Richter, Richard Taylor and Doug Os
heroff in physics.
"All the Nobel Prize winners I've ever met have been through
this group," said Neil Midkiff, who is a production assistant and ac
companist on piano for this fall's production. Midkiff has been in
volved in some capacity with every Savoyard production since
1981. He noted that the group was also an excellent forum in which
students could interact with professionals from the school and
community. "Many of the performers get paid to sing with other
people.. .and it's a unique opportunity for students to work along
side them on stage and learn things from them."
Leslie Cho, a Stanford senior who is performing for the first time
with the Savoyards, agreed. "It's so nice to meet people from out in
the community, " she said. "There is such a high level of profes
sionalism, and the Savoyards are so good at what they're doing. All
the people here love singing so much — and it's a lot of fun!"
"The Lass that Loved a Sailor"
The theme of lovers kept apart by conditions beyond their con
trol is common to many Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The story of
"H.M.S. Pinafore" follows this pattern, as the central story revolves
around lovers who cannot be together because of inequality in their
social ranks.
Ralph (played by Marco Remedios) is a lowly young sailor in the

British Navy who serves on the H.M.S. Pinafore. Ralph falls in love
with the lovely Josephine (Kathleen Robinson), who is the daugh
ter of Captain Corcoran (Bergman), the ship's commander; she
loves Ralph as well, but feels forced to spurn his affections because
of their differences in social class.
Captain Corcoran has a good rapport with and is respected by
his crew of loyal British "tars." He, too, is also separated from love
because of his rank in life; his affections are directed toward the
buxom peddler-woman Little Buttercup (Christie Young), who
regularly vends her wares to the sailors aboard the Pinafore.
The Captain has meanwhile made socially acceptable arrange
ments for his daughter to marry Sir Joseph Porter (Mark Blattel),
the First Lord of the Admiralty. Sir Joseph is quite the cream of the
upper crust. Although he's the highest officer in the Royal Navy, he
knows almost nothing about sailing — he worked his way up the

ranks from the position of a clerk by polishing door handles and
without ever setting foot on a ship.
In furthering the theme of social strata differences, Sir Joseph
encourages the crew by telling them that they deserve courteous
treatment from their captain and are worthy men — although not
nearly as worthy as himself, of course.
Sir Joseph arrives on the Pinafore with his cousin Hebe (Gosia
Holsztynska) and a group of female relatives who accompany him
throughout his travels.
Sir Joseph's female companions join with the manly Pinafore
crew to comprise the show's chorus. Gilbert and Sullivan's choral
ensembles play a unique role within the structure of the story. With
an identity unto itself, the chorus' role within the show is crucial to
plot exposition, explained Mark Baushke, who plays Dick Deadeye.
"It acts as an individual character."
The Savoy Operas have "none of the artificial distinction be
tween chorus and cast," said Midkiff. "Unlike other operas where
the chorus is just background, this ensemble is integral to plots and
music in nearly all [Gilbert and Sullivan] shows."
The chorus lends a sympathetic ear to the plight of Ralph and
Josephine. When the captain's daughter, no longer able to tolerate
Sir Joseph's pompous and self-righteous nature, finally confesses

her love to Ralph, the ladies and sailors of the crew hel the cou
ple plan to steal ashore and marry secretly.
The nefarious Dick Deadeye (Batik) is the essence of villainy and
is reviled by the rest of the crew. Deadeye enables Captain Corco
ran to discover the plans of Josephine and her sailor to eiope. Cor
coran is so enraged by the event that he swears aloud 'Damn!"
The degree to which this outburst shocks the crew and provokes
the scorn of the ever-proper Sir Joseph reinforces the iheme of
class expectations in the plot. The incident also foresnadows a
shakeup in the ranks. ..
Suddenly, Little Buttercup stuns the ship's company by reveal
ing a dark secret that she has been hinting the entire show: work
ing as a nurse many years ago, she practiced "baby-farming". She
then reveals that two of the infants she cared for were none other
than Ralph and Captain Corcoran, whom she had inadvertently
switched at birth!
Because the revelation leaves Corcoran well below his former
social station, a marriage between Sir Joseph and Josephine is also
rendered unacceptable. Happily for Corcoran and l.itlla Butter
cup, they, too, are now allowed to marry.
The oh-so-noble Sir Joseph is left temporarily without a part
ner, but he soon resigns to marry his cousin Hebe — pt tiaps the
inevitable fate of many a British royal.
Sailors and relatives alike celebrate the inevitable tnamph of
true love, although the sudden reversal ofdass distinctions ends up
reinforcing the exact divisions satirized by Gilbert's scrip .
Launching the Performance at Dinkelspiel
The Savoyards are plunging into their production ot "H.M.S.
Pinafore" with energy and dedication. Music Director I Jul Zaw
ilski has obviously highlighted the critical importance 01. nsp pro
nunciation for the singers. The clever word structure supporting
Gilbert's trademark sharp satire and sarcasm would be *>t on an
audience that is unable to decipher the lyrics.
And does" Pinafore" have lyrics! The task of mastering die rapid
pace and intricate text of the more lively songs is daunting, espe
cially when all the members of the chorus lend their voices to the
effort. The Savoyards' chorus, however, generally does a solid job
of keeping its diction crisp and the fast-moving melodie- light.

The cast's offstage rapport transfers well to the stage, as the
actors interact with each other and the script's humorous text
quite effectively.
Bergman and Blattel in particular create character traits
that are lightly overplayed in a manner very appropriate for
their classic G&S roles as commanding officers. Blattel brings
an irresistible pomposity to the overstuffed Sir Joseph, partic
ularly recalling his rise to glory in "When I was a lad."
Bergman creates just the right balance between the captain's
certain — well, almost certain — authority and his more
human ability to banter as he sings to "My gallant crew." Both
actors sing with confidence and move through the intricate
lyrics with apparent ease
Remedios' Ralph also lights up the stage with his soaring
tenor. He sails through the romantic melodies with sincerity
and grace, even when he is on the verge of taking his life rather
than living without Josephine ("Can I survive this overbear
ing?").
Robinson holds her own as the only student among the
lead players. Although her characterization of Josephine occa
sionally lacks the same confidence of her more experienced
counterparts, her clear soprano voice captures Josephine's
youthful innocence well, especially as she anguishes over her
love for Ralph in "Sorry her lot."
Young brings a flirtatious charm to her portrayal of the
working-class Little Buttercup, and her characterizations
play up nicely the double meaning of the "Things are sel
dom what they seem" duet with Captain Corcoran.
Baushke also brings the stereotypical villain-you-love
to-hate Dick Deadeye (who, of course, wears an eye patch!)
alive with an exaggerated Scottish brogue.
The classic score is supported by simple and effective
choreography and staging. And the full company's perfor
mances behind Sir Joseph's "I am the monarch of the sea,"
"Carefully on tiptoe stealing," and the finale are polished
and well-crafted.
G&S First Hit Show Sailed Rough Waters
"H.M.S. Pinafore" debuted in London's Opera
Comique Theatre on May 25, 1978. Unusually hot sum
mer weather kept audiences away at first, but by August,
Gilbert and Sullivan's fourth creation was well on its way
to becoming their first popular success.
Ironically, the show's "merry and spontaneous" music
was composed by Arthur Sullivan while he was suffering
from an extremely painful kidney disease. Sullivan himself
recalled, "1 would compose a few bars, and then be almost

insensible from pain... never was music written under such
disturbing conditions."
After Sullivan's health improved, collaboration with his
lyricist partner continued and soon the carefully crafted piece
was cast and being meticulously rehearsed.
"H.M.S. Pinafore" was performed a remarkable 571 times
during its initial run. Even by today's standards, this incredi
ble run illustrates the incredible popularity the show eventu
ally achieved.
Soon, nearby theaters opened rival productions and a wave
of "Pinafore mania" spread through Europe.
The enthusiasm reached "over the bright blue sea," as the
show's most unexpected success came from the United States.
In early 1879, a London Times newspaper correspondent in
Boston reported, "Such a furor as this opera has created 1 have
never known before in the history of the American stage."
"Pinafore" was playing in six Boston theaters within four
months of its debut there, and in as many venues in Philadel
phia and New York. Even audiences in the southern and west
ern parts of the country were soon humming the familiar
strains after performances in those areas.
One measure of the musical's incredible success was the
way in which music and quips from the script became popu

larized in conversations of the time. When Corcoran sings
out to his crew about the qualities that make him an ad
mirable captain, he assures them he never gets seasick or
swears aloud. "What, never?" asks the crew; Corcoran hes
itates: "We 11... hardly ever!" he admits.
"Pinafore"-crazed fans everywhere adopted the phrase
into their everyday conversations. In their 1914 book
"Gilbert and Sullivan and Their Operas," Francois Cellier
and Cunningham Bridgeman noted that the phrase "be
came a British proverb more familiar to all sorts and con
ditions of men and women than the Prince of Denmark's
famous "To be, or not to be."
In 1878, an frustrated American newspaper editor grew
weary of seeing the phrase woven into nearly every article
in the paper, regardless of topic. He gathered his reporters
together and informed them that they were no longer al
lowed to quote the line in their stories. Unable to resist the
opportunity, the reporters shouted back, "What, never?!"
Relinquishing, the editor had no choice but to reply: "Well,
hardly ever."
Unfortunately for the opera's creators, copyright agree
ments were not held with the United States at the time, so
they received no financial compensation from any of the
pirated American shows. Worse, in Gilbert and Sullivan's
view, was the fact that great liberties were taken in the pro

duct i on
of the
American
shows, so
that the
script,
music
and char
act e t s
were
some
times
barely
recogniz
able as
originat
ing in
their
original

"Pinafore." Determined to re-claim the
rights to their work, Gilbert and Sullivan
themselves opened an 'authorized' pro
duction of "Pinafore" in New York on
Dec. 1, 1879.
The "Pinafore's" Timeless Appeal
""PINAFORE" made a hit in New
York the other night. .. how well that
tripping Sullivan music wears; how fresh
those Gilbert jokes seem after a third of a
century!" The words of journalist 11 1..
Menken, written for the "Baltimore
Evening Sun" in 1911, still apply to
Gilbert and Sullivan shows — even 8(i
years after he wrote them.
The Savoy Operas continue to be a
phenomenon for modern audiences,
who can relate to the themes and satirical
humor of Gilbert and Sullivan's work.
"It's great to be having this much fun
doing musicals that are over 100 years
old," said Mark Baushke, who plays

"Deadeye Dick" in the production. "They are really timeless
sets of stories."
"I would encourage everyone out there who's never been
to a Gilbert and Sullivan show to come see it,"he said of
"H.M.S. Pinafore." "It really is a story about being from the
wrong side of the tracks."
Kathleen Robinson, a junior who is playing the role of
Josephine, agreed. This is her first performance with the Savo
yards, and she encouraged students to come to a performance
because "the show is absolutely hysterical and is a ton of fun!"
Desiree Ong, a junior majoring in symbolic systems and
also participating in her first Savoyard production, described
the company as a unique benefit for Stanford students. "It's
more professional than other drama groups on campus," she
said, "and it's a great benefit for students to be able to see a
professional show right here at Stanford."

the autumn air were from a final rehearsal of "H.M.S. Pinafore," the
classic work chosen by the Savoyards to open their 25th anniversary
season this Friday, Nov. 7, at 8 p.m. at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The love these artists have for the work of the 18th century
British duo is evident in the rehearsal's atmosphere. Performers
and production staff alike joked with each other in an easy cama
raderie, yet the professionalism with which the cast moved through
the music and choreography demonstrated the seriousness with
which the company takes its craft.
The Savoyards: An Enthusiastic Crew
The Savoy Theatre in London was built in 1881 expressly for the
productions of William S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan; the 14 light
operas composed by the duo are consequently also known as "The
Savoy Operas." That term was adopted by the group of faculty and
students that formed the company in 1973.
In the years since the Savoyards' creation, the group has ex
panded to include community members and alumni as well. Many
members cited this unique blend of experience and background as
one of the company's strengths.
"It's really an international group," said Bob Bergman, who is
playing Captain Corcoran in the production. "We have people
from practically every continent in this show, and you don't always
have that in a community group."
Bergman knows of what he speaks, as this is his seventh involve
ment with a staging of "H.M.S. Pinafore" and his third portrayal of
Captain Corcoran. He has been involved with the Savoyards since
1990 and enjoys the rapport of "lots of people who have been work
ing together for lots of years."
The 100-plus performers who make up the Savoyards reflect the
diversity of Stanford, the Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay
Area. The group is also the only Gilbert and Sullivan company in
the country to boast five Nobel Prize winners, all of whom are
members of Stanford's faculty: William Sharpeand Kenneth Arrow
in economics and Burton Richter, Richard Taylor and Doug Os
heroff in physics.
"All the Nobel Prize winners I've ever met have been through
this group," said Neil Midkiff, who is a production assistant and ac
companist on piano for this fall's production. Midkiff has been in
volved in some capacity with every Savoyard production since
1981. He noted that the group was also an excellent forum in which
students could interact with professionals from the school and
community. "Many of the performers get paid to sing with other
people.. .and it's a unique opportunity for students to work along
side them on stage and learn things from them."
Leslie Cho, a Stanford senior who is performing for the first time
with the Savoyards, agreed. "It's so nice to meet people from out in
the community, " she said. "There is such a high level of profes
sionalism, and the Savoyards are so good at what they're doing. All
the people here love singing so much — and it's a lot of fun!"
"The Lass that Loved a Sailor"
The theme of lovers kept apart by conditions beyond their con
trol is common to many Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The story of
"H.M.S. Pinafore" follows this pattern, as the central story revolves
around lovers who cannot be together because of inequality in their
social ranks.
Ralph (played by Marco Remedios) is a lowly young sailor in the

British Navy who serves on the H.M.S. Pinafore. Ralph falls in love
with the lovely Josephine (Kathleen Robinson), who is the daugh
ter of Captain Corcoran (Bergman), the ship's commander; she
loves Ralph as well, but feels forced to spurn his affections because
of their differences in social class.
Captain Corcoran has a good rapport with and is respected by
his crew of loyal British "tars." He, too, is also separated from love
because of his rank in life; his affections are directed toward the
buxom peddler-woman Little Buttercup (Christie Young), who
regularly vends her wares to the sailors aboard the Pinafore.
The Captain has meanwhile made socially acceptable arrange
ments for his daughter to marry Sir Joseph Porter (Mark Blattel),
the First Lord of the Admiralty. Sir Joseph is quite the cream of the
upper crust. Although he's the highest officer in the Royal Navy, he
knows almost nothing about sailing — he worked his way up the

ranks from the position of a clerk by polishing door handles and
without ever setting foot on a ship.
In furthering the theme of social strata differences, Sir Joseph
encourages the crew by telling them that they deserve courteous
treatment from their captain and are worthy men — although not
nearly as worthy as himself, of course.
Sir Joseph arrives on the Pinafore with his cousin Hebe (Gosia
Holsztynska) and a group of female relatives who accompany him
throughout his travels.
Sir Joseph's female companions join with the manly Pinafore
crew to comprise the show's chorus. Gilbert and Sullivan's choral
ensembles play a unique role within the structure of the story. With
an identity unto itself, the chorus' role within the show is crucial to
plot exposition, explained Mark Baushke, who plays Dick Deadeye.
"It acts as an individual character."
The Savoy Operas have "none of the artificial distinction be
tween chorus and cast," said Midkiff. "Unlike other operas where
the chorus is just background, this ensemble is integral to plots and
music in nearly all [Gilbert and Sullivan] shows."
The chorus lends a sympathetic ear to the plight of Ralph and
Josephine. When the captain's daughter, no longer able to tolerate
Sir Joseph's pompous and self-righteous nature, finally confesses

her love to Ralph, the ladies and sailors of the crew hel the cou
ple plan to steal ashore and marry secretly.
The nefarious Dick Deadeye (Batik) is the essence of villainy and
is reviled by the rest of the crew. Deadeye enables Captain Corco
ran to discover the plans of Josephine and her sailor to eiope. Cor
coran is so enraged by the event that he swears aloud 'Damn!"
The degree to which this outburst shocks the crew and provokes
the scorn of the ever-proper Sir Joseph reinforces the iheme of
class expectations in the plot. The incident also foresnadows a
shakeup in the ranks. ..
Suddenly, Little Buttercup stuns the ship's company by reveal
ing a dark secret that she has been hinting the entire show: work
ing as a nurse many years ago, she practiced "baby-farming". She
then reveals that two of the infants she cared for were none other
than Ralph and Captain Corcoran, whom she had inadvertently
switched at birth!
Because the revelation leaves Corcoran well below his former
social station, a marriage between Sir Joseph and Josephine is also
rendered unacceptable. Happily for Corcoran and l.itlla Butter
cup, they, too, are now allowed to marry.
The oh-so-noble Sir Joseph is left temporarily without a part
ner, but he soon resigns to marry his cousin Hebe — pt tiaps the
inevitable fate of many a British royal.
Sailors and relatives alike celebrate the inevitable tnamph of
true love, although the sudden reversal ofdass distinctions ends up
reinforcing the exact divisions satirized by Gilbert's scrip .
Launching the Performance at Dinkelspiel
The Savoyards are plunging into their production ot "H.M.S.
Pinafore" with energy and dedication. Music Director I Jul Zaw
ilski has obviously highlighted the critical importance 01. nsp pro
nunciation for the singers. The clever word structure supporting
Gilbert's trademark sharp satire and sarcasm would be *>t on an
audience that is unable to decipher the lyrics.
And does" Pinafore" have lyrics! The task of mastering die rapid
pace and intricate text of the more lively songs is daunting, espe
cially when all the members of the chorus lend their voices to the
effort. The Savoyards' chorus, however, generally does a solid job
of keeping its diction crisp and the fast-moving melodie- light.

The cast's offstage rapport transfers well to the stage, as the
actors interact with each other and the script's humorous text
quite effectively.
Bergman and Blattel in particular create character traits
that are lightly overplayed in a manner very appropriate for
their classic G&S roles as commanding officers. Blattel brings
an irresistible pomposity to the overstuffed Sir Joseph, partic
ularly recalling his rise to glory in "When I was a lad."
Bergman creates just the right balance between the captain's
certain — well, almost certain — authority and his more
human ability to banter as he sings to "My gallant crew." Both
actors sing with confidence and move through the intricate
lyrics with apparent ease
Remedios' Ralph also lights up the stage with his soaring
tenor. He sails through the romantic melodies with sincerity
and grace, even when he is on the verge of taking his life rather
than living without Josephine ("Can I survive this overbear
ing?").
Robinson holds her own as the only student among the
lead players. Although her characterization of Josephine occa
sionally lacks the same confidence of her more experienced
counterparts, her clear soprano voice captures Josephine's
youthful innocence well, especially as she anguishes over her
love for Ralph in "Sorry her lot."
Young brings a flirtatious charm to her portrayal of the
working-class Little Buttercup, and her characterizations
play up nicely the double meaning of the "Things are sel
dom what they seem" duet with Captain Corcoran.
Baushke also brings the stereotypical villain-you-love
to-hate Dick Deadeye (who, of course, wears an eye patch!)
alive with an exaggerated Scottish brogue.
The classic score is supported by simple and effective
choreography and staging. And the full company's perfor
mances behind Sir Joseph's "I am the monarch of the sea,"
"Carefully on tiptoe stealing," and the finale are polished
and well-crafted.
G&S First Hit Show Sailed Rough Waters
"H.M.S. Pinafore" debuted in London's Opera
Comique Theatre on May 25, 1978. Unusually hot sum
mer weather kept audiences away at first, but by August,
Gilbert and Sullivan's fourth creation was well on its way
to becoming their first popular success.
Ironically, the show's "merry and spontaneous" music
was composed by Arthur Sullivan while he was suffering
from an extremely painful kidney disease. Sullivan himself
recalled, "1 would compose a few bars, and then be almost

insensible from pain... never was music written under such
disturbing conditions."
After Sullivan's health improved, collaboration with his
lyricist partner continued and soon the carefully crafted piece
was cast and being meticulously rehearsed.
"H.M.S. Pinafore" was performed a remarkable 571 times
during its initial run. Even by today's standards, this incredi
ble run illustrates the incredible popularity the show eventu
ally achieved.
Soon, nearby theaters opened rival productions and a wave
of "Pinafore mania" spread through Europe.
The enthusiasm reached "over the bright blue sea," as the
show's most unexpected success came from the United States.
In early 1879, a London Times newspaper correspondent in
Boston reported, "Such a furor as this opera has created 1 have
never known before in the history of the American stage."
"Pinafore" was playing in six Boston theaters within four
months of its debut there, and in as many venues in Philadel
phia and New York. Even audiences in the southern and west
ern parts of the country were soon humming the familiar
strains after performances in those areas.
One measure of the musical's incredible success was the
way in which music and quips from the script became popu

larized in conversations of the time. When Corcoran sings
out to his crew about the qualities that make him an ad
mirable captain, he assures them he never gets seasick or
swears aloud. "What, never?" asks the crew; Corcoran hes
itates: "We 11... hardly ever!" he admits.
"Pinafore"-crazed fans everywhere adopted the phrase
into their everyday conversations. In their 1914 book
"Gilbert and Sullivan and Their Operas," Francois Cellier
and Cunningham Bridgeman noted that the phrase "be
came a British proverb more familiar to all sorts and con
ditions of men and women than the Prince of Denmark's
famous "To be, or not to be."
In 1878, an frustrated American newspaper editor grew
weary of seeing the phrase woven into nearly every article
in the paper, regardless of topic. He gathered his reporters
together and informed them that they were no longer al
lowed to quote the line in their stories. Unable to resist the
opportunity, the reporters shouted back, "What, never?!"
Relinquishing, the editor had no choice but to reply: "Well,
hardly ever."
Unfortunately for the opera's creators, copyright agree
ments were not held with the United States at the time, so
they received no financial compensation from any of the
pirated American shows. Worse, in Gilbert and Sullivan's
view, was the fact that great liberties were taken in the pro

duct i on
of the
American
shows, so
that the
script,
music
and char
act e t s
were
some
times
barely
recogniz
able as
originat
ing in
their
original

"Pinafore." Determined to re-claim the
rights to their work, Gilbert and Sullivan
themselves opened an 'authorized' pro
duction of "Pinafore" in New York on
Dec. 1, 1879.
The "Pinafore's" Timeless Appeal
""PINAFORE" made a hit in New
York the other night. .. how well that
tripping Sullivan music wears; how fresh
those Gilbert jokes seem after a third of a
century!" The words of journalist 11 1..
Menken, written for the "Baltimore
Evening Sun" in 1911, still apply to
Gilbert and Sullivan shows — even 8(i
years after he wrote them.
The Savoy Operas continue to be a
phenomenon for modern audiences,
who can relate to the themes and satirical
humor of Gilbert and Sullivan's work.
"It's great to be having this much fun
doing musicals that are over 100 years
old," said Mark Baushke, who plays

"Deadeye Dick" in the production. "They are really timeless
sets of stories."
"I would encourage everyone out there who's never been
to a Gilbert and Sullivan show to come see it,"he said of
"H.M.S. Pinafore." "It really is a story about being from the
wrong side of the tracks."
Kathleen Robinson, a junior who is playing the role of
Josephine, agreed. This is her first performance with the Savo
yards, and she encouraged students to come to a performance
because "the show is absolutely hysterical and is a ton of fun!"
Desiree Ong, a junior majoring in symbolic systems and
also participating in her first Savoyard production, described
the company as a unique benefit for Stanford students. "It's
more professional than other drama groups on campus," she
said, "and it's a great benefit for students to be able to see a
professional show right here at Stanford."
