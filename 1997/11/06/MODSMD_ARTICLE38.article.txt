## Nimrod Green Day 
### 
Give a band some fame and it's al
most guaranteed that it'll go through an
identity crisis or some freaky case of
style amnesia. You'll love its first album,
and then you'll wonder if the same band
produced the second one. Think U2 and
R.E.M: the world loved them, and in re
turn, they tried to grow up and please
the whole world.
Fortunately, Green Day doesn't have
this problem, which it proves in its
newest album "Nimrod." Sure, the band
has come a long way since its days of ob
scurity when members rode around
Berkeley in their Green Day van and de
livered gigs in local hangouts.
The group has been launched into
sky-high celebrity status since its major
label debut "Dookie" in 1994, but as it
proved in its second album "Insomniac"

and continues to prove in its newest
album, the band's style is pretty much
the same as it's always been.
The three-man band from Berkeley
plays as though it is oblivious to its fame.
The reality is that any members are just
not going to play differently because of
it. On "Nimrod," they continue to drum,
string and sing in the same jamming
punk rock style that has worked for the
past five years.
They retain their aggression from
"Dookie," but re-fresh it with newer,
livelier tunes. In "Hitchin a Ride," which
they played for Letterman audiences
early last month, they show that they're
back with that same no holds barred,
sing about whatever comes to mind
style.
Other songs have echoes of Weezer
and the Ramones, like "Grouch" for ex

ample. Here Billy Joe laments the idea of
becoming an old man who has no aspi
rations:
"I was a young boy that had big plans.
Now I'm just another shitty old man."
The song is cool because as he's ex
pressing his fears about growing up, the
audience (if feeling particularly deep)
can relate: we also don't want Green Day
to grow up.
It's the three-minute fits of uncon
trollable fury and passion, wrapped into
the lyrics about ordinary life and ordi
nary existence (all coming from guys
who happen to be world-renowned),
that make Green Day great. In "Nim
rod," the group sounds as fresh and
young and alive as it did before the
world knew or cared about who it was.
I hope they never grow up.
