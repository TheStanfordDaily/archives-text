# So Much For The Afterglow Everclear
## 
### 
If there's one group today that has perfect
ed the art of disguising pop garbage for au
thentic alternative music, it's Everclear: faith
ful vassal to MTV and the radio-friendly ear.
"So Much For The Afterglow" Firmly es
tablishes Everclear as a worthy heir to the
kingdom of superfluous mediocrity, current
ly ruled with an iron Fist by Collective Soul
and Dishwalla.
While previously successful groups have
used redundant, easy-to-play songs as an
artistic medium (for example, Nirvana),

Everclear simply uses these songs to till up
space on its recordings.
Jam session "El Distorto De Melodica"
and the catchy "Amphetamine" are relatively
harmless, yet they certainly fall well short of
rock and roll decency. In other words, guys,
'Is that the best you can do?'
None of "Afterglow's" songs capture the
fun of "Sparkle and Fade's" nor "Santa Mon
ica" or the energy of "Heroin Girl."
Instead, the substance of the latest 13
songs is repetitive, dull junk over-produced
and over co-produced by A.P. Alexakis and

Neal Avron, respectively (additional over
production assistance was provided by Lars
Fox, Greg Eklund, Craig Montoya and Jim
Rondinelli).
Well, what has Everclear done that's never
been done before? I can't remember the last
time that so many instruments were played
by this many 'musicians' on a rock album this
poorly.
In addition to singing, songwriting and
strumming his guitar, Alexakis plays steel
guitar, keyboards, banjo, mandolin and the
toy piano. Meanwhile, bassist Montoya also

sings, plays keyboards, the mandolin and
makes 'assorted chicken noises,' wasting time_
and energy that he most likely could've spent
refining his poor bass skills.
Talentless drummer Eklund pitches in
with vocals and keyboards as well. Oh, wait,
he plays the slide whistle too. Additional mu
sicians include a vox organist, a violist, a cel
list and three horn players.
The end result of this massive combined
effort is stale guitar riffs complemented by
miscellaneous and pointless background
noise. Everclear might not have released a
very good album, but at least the band did it
as a team.
