# Peace and Noise Patti smith

### 
"Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine," Patti Smith de
clared at the beginning of her 1975 album "Horses," and she
opened the door to a world where a female rock musician could
he, do or say anything.

Over the course of five minutes and 54 seconds, her epic revi
sion of Van Morrison's "Gloria" completely obliterated the rock
patriarchy, proving once and for all that a woman could play
rock music with all of the ferocity and confidence of a man.
While her latest release "Peace and Noise" doesn't offer that
same revolutionary thrill, Smith and her band still possess the re
markable ability to mix poetry with a vital and earthy rock and
roll, as if there was never any difference between the two.
"Waiting Underground," the opening track, is a perfect ex
ample. It begins with a raw and reverberating guitar and then
adds an ethereal piano, which floats above and eventually con
sumes the original riff. Then, with a visceral shock, Smith's deep,
almost ugly voice enters, and the song becomes the creepy story
of white-shrouded revolutionaries, waiting underground like ci
cada larvae for the time of change.
Likewise, "Death Singing" and the Pretenders-esque "1959"
are given an irrepressible power by the sheer force of Smith's
voice. Unlike dewy-eyed, whispering whiners such as Jewel or
Fiona Apple, Smith's bass snarl of a voice is filled with an invin
cible self-confidence, a vital intelligence and an absolute unwill
ingness to be a victim. Even in her most painful lines there is an
exact understanding of the limits of pain, as well as a deep and
abiding sense of hope.
However, the tragedy of "Peace and Noise" is that the lyrics
are no longer able to support the weight of the voice. Apparent
ly Smith forgot along the way that the most effective way to ex

plore society is through the individual. Too many of the songs fall
into trite social formulas of right and wrong, black and white,
justice and injustice.
This clumsiness is completely out of keeping with the ability
of the songwriter who once defined the exhilarating power and
crushing hopelessness of a whole generation with a single
snarled line: "I go to this here party, and 1 just get bored."
Thus, the best songs on the album are the most personal: the
gorgeous "Blue Poles" or the surprisingly good "Last Call," a folk
ballad about the Heaven's Gate suicides in which she finds in her
self both empathy and understanding for the members of the
cult.
Also, Smith seems to have lost some of her connection with
the classic rock that made "Horses" so gripping.
On that album she would ground her beat poetry in the rich
earth of classic motown and soul rhythms, creating a mixture
that was both experimental and completely natural.
"Memento Mori," which is basically a remake of the song
"Land" (on the "Horses" album), seems completely without
form or direction — a stark contrast to the original, which
achieved a frenetic energy by appropriating Wilson Pickett's
classic "Land of a Thousand Dances."
Despite these weaknesses, "Peace and Noise" stands out in
modern music for the sheer force of Smith's conviction. After
hearing countless adolescent bands dabbling in irony, it's an ab
solute relief to know that even after 22 years, two children and the
death of her husband, Smith is still standing in front of a raging
band and howling the new gospel of rock and roll.
