# Cold
## Lycia 
### 
I hadn't heard of Lycia before last week, so
when I looked at the cover jacket of its latest
album "Cold," I thought I'd been handed the
newest in Death Metal. The tracks are titled
"Frozen," "Bare," "Baltica," "Colder," etc... .
but any resemblance to my favorite headbang
ing songs ends there.
Lycia's genre is dubbed "Goth-Ambient." Its
sound is neither metallic nor violent; it is lone
ly, despairing and estranged. It brings to mind

the vastness and austerity of gothic cathedrals.
So my review of this album can really go two
ways. If you don't like feeling bereft of every
thing warm and good in the world, don't listen
to it. But if you already feel that way, or just
want to try it out, then this music will work for
you.
"Cold" succeeds in what it tries to do. It
evokes. It doesn't just sound sad and lonely—it
plays like a movie soundtrack to which your
mind provides the screenplay. The images are

all basically the same: emptiness, ennui, melan
choly and so on.
But they're supposed to he. Rather than try
ing to diversify its music, Lycia focuses in on
one single concept — coldness. Repetition be
comes a virtue instead of a fault. The songs are
generally comprised by a simple drum beat, a
four-chord progression and ample layers of
synthesized harmonics hovering over every
thing. Kach goes on for several minutes, totally
absorbing you in the repetition.
Tara Vanflower and Mike VanPortfleet take
turns whispering vocals and singing eerily into
the musical backdrop. It doesn't matter that

you can't make out the words — its all part of
the mood. Everything echoes and dissipates;
the pace is always slow and unrelenting. If
you've every listened to a Mazzy Star album, it
is like that hut moreso.
Nonetheless, the album sucks if you're not
ready to feel depressed with it. This goes, again,
to its credit. The three members of Lycia (Mike
VanPortfleet, David Galas and Tar a Vanflowcr)
have mastered their style like Metallica mas
tered heavy metal back in the early '90s.
But thinking about Metallica's albums since
then is more depression than I can stand....
