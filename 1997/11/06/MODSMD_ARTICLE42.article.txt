## The
						Elevator Drops 
### 
This is the kind of music that cool people listen to:
irreverent, electronic, sure of itself. Label-less, except
for the label that I just gave it.
The Elevator Drops reminds me of Jane's Addiction.
The band members have the same straining whine
sounding voices, the same kind of guitar sounds and
the same addictive energy. I mean all of this in a good
way.
However, where Jane's Addiction has a very specific
sort of driving, yet mellow sound in all their songs, The
Elevator Drops has what seems to be an infinite num
ber of influences in its music. Chances are that you will
never be in the mood to hear all of the songs on this
album in one sitting. They are all so different from each
other.
It's not uniformly bouncy enough to be considered
dance music, it's not droning or impressive enough to
be sex music, and it's certainly not mellow pot-smokin'
music. The band sounds like a Jane's Addiction salad
with a bit of Bob Dylan and Neil Young thrown in for
color, some Metallica for texture and a little bit of Bea
tles and disco for croutons. Some OMD on the side.
This is the kind of music that you listen to and nod
"yes," by yourself or with friends, always with an open
mind.
Actually there were couple of times when 1 shook my
head "no." You can't please all of the people. The Eleva
tor Drops doesn't try.

The band switches back and forth between acoustic
and electric, between pop and folkie and '80s radio
heavy metal, between cheesy lyrics and moving ones, be
tween punk and psychedelic surfer background music.
Oh, yeah, and some hip-hop sounding drum beats and
samples.
Tracks to look out for:
1: "Sentimental Love"—Disco and techno mushed
together, good vocal harmony, the kind of song that will
probably make it to the radio stations.
3: "Right Back Home"— Neil Young's voice, some
Bob Dylan organ, a flute. Very mellow. Folk sensibilities
and electric guitar. The Sundays minus the sentiment
and high voice.
5: "Proto" — Wildly electric Traveling Wilberry's
and Jane's Addiction love child.
9: "$7 Single" — Sounds like a really good '80s
song. This may make the radio, as well.
11: "The March of the Kraftwerk Replicants"
Sounds a little like "Spiderman" by The Cure.
12: "The Theme to the Gary Newman Show"—
Same mood as "If You Leave" by OMD without the vo
cals and a little more electronic.
13: "Proto Eleven" — An electric drum jam with
acoustic guitar and vocals.
17: "Morphiglobe" — "Octopus's Garden" by the
Beatles, water sounds and all (but with different subject
matter).
Take a risk on this album. Anyone who is at all en
amored of any of the musicians I've mentioned should
definitely take a chance on The Elevator I )rops.
