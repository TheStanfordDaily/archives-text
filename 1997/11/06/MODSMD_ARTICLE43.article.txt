# it means everything
## Save Ferris 
### 
Orange County, Calif. This hotbed of
pop / ska has christened the next major attrac
tion for the teenage and twenty-something
generation; Save Ferris.
Like No Doubt, Sublime and Reel Big Fish,
Save Ferris has burst onto the scene with catchy
tunes and a happy feel that counteracts the
angst of past years and drives another nail in
the coffin of grunge.
Led by lead singer Monique Powell, this
quirky group of eight combines the blues of
1940s swing, the horns and rhythm of '90s
third wave ska and contemporary pop to pro
duce a new and innovative sound. Combine
the swing of Squirrel Nut Zippers, the female
ska of Dance Hall Crashers and the feel of No
Doubt pop and viola, Save Ferris.
The band's first major release, "it means
everything," is a great follow up to its little
known debut album, "Introducing Save Fer
ris." Produced by the great Pete Collins and
Epic Records, "everything" has five songs from
the first album and new additions that war

ranted an opening at number 75 on the pop
billboard chart at its release.
The remix of the Dexy's Midnight Runners
'80s hit "Come on Eileen" is the first real smash
and serves as a spring board for the rest of the
album. This fast paced, pulsing roller coaster il
lustrates the vocal range of Powell in vivid
sound. Coupled with driving guitar riffs by
Brian Mashburn and bassist Bill Lechi, "Come
On Eileen" serves as a benchmark for the talent
and range of the band.
Horn fans will be pleasantly pleased by
"everything." T-Bone Willy, formerly of the
Knuckle Brothers, on trombone, Eric Zambo
ra on alto sax and Jose Castellanos on trumpet
form a well-balanced trio who add an essential
element to Ferris. The tracks "The World is
New," "Nobody But Me," "Sorry My Friend"
and "Lies" are excellent examples of these great
percussionists and are reminiscent of the great
horns of the Scofflaws or Specials of old.
For the blues and lounge singing element,
the band has "Goodbye" and "Super.py." The
listener feels right in a 1940s lounge complete

with blue smoke overhead and gangster hats.
Powell's jazz upbringing shines as she croons
over a failed love affair and James Bond sce
nario. These tracks are impressive examples of
range and gives the band a totally new flavor.
Save Ferris is a younger band and its youth
shows through on the fun "Spam" and "Under
21Spam is a playful ode to one of America's
most beloved meat by-products that, accord
ing to Ferris, is "made in Chernobyl." "Under
21" serves as the anthem for every teenager
who has gotten shut out of a bar or club and
knows that "it sucks to be under 21
The only downfall of "it means everything"
is it lacks any substantial lyrics. Any high
school garage band could write these songs.
But if one focuses on the words, the whole
point is missed. Save Ferris is about the music.
Amid the extraordinary horns, vocals and gui
tars, no one cares that the lyrics are sub par.
Overall, the album is an experience that should
not be missed.
