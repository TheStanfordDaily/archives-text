## Red Corner 
### 
The previews for "Red Corner" would lead
you to believe that the film is an action
packed, intense political thriller. Of course, if
you took every exciting scene from any movie
and crammed them into a 45-second mon
tage, that movie would probably seem pretty
intense, too.
In the case of "Red Corner," the previews
are designed to lure you in to see what is actu
ally a courtroom melodrama peppered with
political messages and vague attempts at for
bidden romance. Richard Gere plays Jack
Moore, an American lawyer who comes to
Beijing to negotiate a billion-dollar cable deal
only to find himself framed for murder.
On Jack's first night there, he gets to expe
rience the new, quasi-capitalist China: he

goes to a fashion show, he goes dancing, he
picks up a beautiful model — and then he
wakes up the next morning to find she's dead,
her blood covering his hands and his cloth
ing. The next thing he knows, he's being
charged with her rape and murder and is
whisked off to become a victim of the mas
sively abusive Chinese legal system. Examples
of Jack's ordeal include everything from the
standard strippings and beatings to having
his dishes washed in his urinal. (This is an ex
ample of an "intense" moment.)
The rest of the film centers around Jack's
relatively predictable trial, if you could call it
that. Deserted by the U.S. Embassy and forced
to rely on the court-appointed attorney (Bai
Ling), who (you guessed it) becomes his love

interest, lack becomes familiar with the infa
mous mantra of China's legal system, "Le
niency for those who confess, severity for
those who resist."
But"Red.Corner" isn't exactly an expose of
the brutality of the Chinese legal system —
most people are well aware of China's human
rights problem. Rather, the film is sort of an
opportunity for Gere, a well-known Tibetan
rights activist, to get on his soapbox and feel
like he's done his part in personally denounc
ing China.
This would be fine, were the movie not a 2-
hour denunciation. After all, a 45-second
montage could do the job — and maybe get a
little more of the message across, too
