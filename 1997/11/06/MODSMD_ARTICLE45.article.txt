# Eve's Bayou
## 
### 
"Eve's Bayou" opens quite dra
matically: "Memory is a selection of
images. Some elusive, others print
ed indelibly on the brain. The sum
mer I killed my father, 1 was 10 years
old. . .The 10-year-old is Eve
Batiste, maturely played by new
comer Jurnee Smollet. But, despite
a host of sparkling and inviting per
formances, the slow-moving film
lacks the verve and dramatic punch
needed to enrapture the audience.
Perhaps the best-kept secret
about the film is actress Kasi Lem
mons ("Silence of the Lambs"). She
is a wisened Hollywood staple, and
she unveils a directorial style

unique to other modern filmmak
ers. She artfully includes soulful
looks across placid swampy waters
and rugged tropical terrain during
Eve's wistful monologues. The
songs and dances of the Creole cul
ture in Louisiana magnify the effect
of the setting. "Eve's Bayou" truly is
beautiful, both in its haunting visu
als and its poetic words.
But as the plot slogs along, slow
ly revealing the problems of the
Batiste family, the movie quickly
becomes tiresome and over-dra
matic. Patriarch Louis (an unim
pressive Samuel L. Jackson) leads
his family as the successful doctor,

husband and father to three kids.
He is a complicated character, pri
marily because of his unending love
for both his family and the beautiful
women around him. His womaniz
ing eventually catches up to him,
and it provides one of the movie's
better climactic sequences.
His wife, Roz (Lynn Whitfield,
"Josephine Baker Story"), embod
ies the grace and elegance of the
Southern mother. She fears that a
tragic accident due to a curse might
befall her children. "Eve's Bayou"
often delves into this world of spiri
tuality and magic. There are many
occasions when a character utilizes

voodoo or hand-holding to reach
the mystical world. It is yet another
example of Lemmons' mindful use
of Southern cultural aspects.
In yet another strong perfor
mance, Meagan Good, as the eldest
daughter Cisely, has an intimate re
lationship with Eve. They are able to
communicate with ease and few se
crets are kept between them. Hence,
when Cisely suddenly becomes in
troverted and yearns to leave the
Batiste household, Eve turns suspi
cious and pushes Cisely to reveal
her innermost secret. It's quite a
shock to watch Cisely's story unfold
on screen in a revealing flashback.

Unfortunately, Eves reaction to the
tale — and her subsequent actions
— make little sense in light of past
events.
I really wanted to embrace "Eve's
Bayou' for all of the style and char
acterization so carefully inserted by
Lemmons. Smollet nearly steals the
show as the 10-year-old with the
emotional weight of a middle-aged
woman. It is very rare, indeed, for
the Southern black family to be
shown on the big screen, but this
latest effort is barely recommend
able as a detailed study of family,
culture and memory
