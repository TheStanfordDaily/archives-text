# Year of the Horse
## 
### 
You don't have to be a huge tan of Neil
Young and Crazy Horse to enjoy the docu
mentary film about their 1996 tour, "Year of
the Horse," but it's a whole lot better if you
are. Band members Ralph Molina, Frank
Sampedro, Billy Talbot and Neil Young are
fun to watch off stage, though loads of con
cert footage become a little trying. Crazy
Horse alternately performs and reflects on
its music as recent concert scenes and
footage from past tours are mixed in with
home-video style interviews.
As each of its members faces the camera,
the history of the band unfolds. During
these mildly revealing monologues each guy
at some point makes the revelation that the
essence of Crazy Horse just can't be cap
tured on two hours of film. However, there
is time enough to grasp the implications of
spending most of adult life in a rock band.
Drummer Molina recalls that Crazy
Horse has had its share of "heavy" experi-

ences, including
the drug-related
death of original
member Danny
VVhitten and later,
the loss of produc
er David Briggs.
There are also sev
eral references to
the difficulty of
trying to hold to
gether a family
while on the road.
The magic that
occurs when Crazy
Horse is together
on stage makes all
of their hardships
worthwhile —
magic that can real
ly only be experi-

enced firsthand. There is a lot of footage of
the band jamming together for prolonged
periods of time. The band members are
right when they predict that the film version
of what they do just won't get it right. At the

concerts you can tell the crowd is having a
great time, the band is having a great time,
everyone is grooving. But the purist style
that is so effective live is a little dull on film.
Having previously done video work

with Crazy Horse, director Jim Jarmusch
has an entertaining relationship with the
band. Far from remaining a fly on the
wall, Jarmusch has an ongoing banter
with the band members. He captures
amusing human moments and inter
sperses them with the rock star lifestyle
scenes — the band members smoke a
joint, talk about religion on the tour bus
and vex over computer problems.
It's cool to see a band that has been to
gether this long without burning out or
clinging embarrassingly to a youthful
image that the members' soft bellies can
no longer tuck into. Casual, grungy and
lacking inflated egos, Neil Young and
Crazy Horse make no pretense about who
they are. Their off-stage persona changes
little once they are performing in front of
a crowd.
The band's unique personality creates

a stimulating film. If you can make it
through the extensive concert footage, "Year
of the Horse" offers a refreshing look at a tal
ented group of people who really care about
what they do.
