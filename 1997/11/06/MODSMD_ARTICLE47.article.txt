# Fast, Cheap and Out of Control
## 
### 
Pure zaniness! "Fast, Cheap and Out of
Control," a documentary by director Errol
Morris, is sometimes serious, sometimes
wacky or just plain bizarre, but always strik
ing and delightfully zany.
Morris, whose earlier work includes "The
Thin Blue Line" and "A Brief History of
lime," has definitely crafted another gem.
With curious and unexpected camera angles,
stark transitions from grainy to crisp images
and a magical eye for captivating details, he
springs a viewer into his uniquely textured
and peopled world.
The film has four primary subjects, all of
whom certainly classify as eccentrics and are,
in some way, linked to animals. Dave Hoover
is a lion tamer who is enamored of Clive Beat
ty, the late circus baron and Hollywood actor.

Interwoven with clips of Hoover practicing
his art is marvelously corny footage of Beatty
in a laughably low-budget Hollywood movie.
Ray Mendez, who wears a hilarious bow tie
throughout, is obsessed with ugly, hairless
and wrinkly little critters known as mole rats
that live underground and gnaw through iust
about everything with their two huge front
teeth.
"There's nothing like the hand shears," said
George Mendonca, a topiary gardener who
occupies his time maintaining an expansive
landscape of hedges that he has fashioned to
look like gigantic zoo animals.
And then there is Rodney Brooks, an
M.I.T. scientist with bulging eyes and a smile
that ranges from goofy to maniacal, who has
designed amazingly realistic insect-like ma
chines.
If you can't quite find the connection be
tween these four individuals, don't worry,
you're not supposed to. Instead, Morris draws
us through an ingenious web of loose associ

ations, jumping from character to character
through visual, verbal and theoretical paral
lels.
The overall effect is a rich impressionistic
composition that simultaneously highlights
the comic and strangely brilliant qualities of
his four subjects.
Not oniv are we intimately introduced to
these characters, but also we pick up a bunch
of oild and nutty information along the way.
lor example, did vou ki that mole rats roll
around in on^ 1 inoti rr 'i so as to assume
a common scent or that t legs of a lion
trainer's .. ir can <ii t and pacify a
iion?
Toward the end of "Fast, Cheap and Out of
Control," Brooks hypothesizes that robots
might be "our legacy in the future." For histo
ry's sake, our robot heirs might want a copy of
this film as a reminder of those qualities that
are human.
