Seeing "Switchback" is not exactly the
most worthwhile way to spend $7. Howev
er, the consolation here is that, if you do
spend the money, you get two movies for
the price of one. The drawback? They're two
totally different, and not exactly comple
mentary, movies.
The first of the two movies presented for
your viewing pleasure is a bizarre road trip
movie, featuring Jared Leto as a secretive
medical school drop-out who hitchhikes a
ride from a former railroad worker, played
by a jovial Danny Glovei.
The two are a pretty odd combination

for a buddy film, so. .. another plot is
thrown in altogether — about an over-in
volved FBI agent (an oddly monotonous
Dennis Quaid) on the trail of a vicious seri
al killer. That's a pretty safe plot, seeing as
it's the basic premise for about 90 percent of
the films in current release.
The use of these two plots in conjunc
tion, however, makes not only for a weird
movie, but for a relatively predictable one as
well. We're pretty safe in assuming the killer
is someone to whom we've been introduced
on-screen, narrowing down the possibili
ties, and the suspense, considerably.
And why would screenwriter Jeb Stuart
(who wrote the script while at Stanford) in
clude the road trip plot unless it had at least
some bearing on the film, i.e. one of the
road trippers is actually the killer.

The film also falls into the familiar trap
of making the killings a personal cat and
mouse game between the killer and the FBI
agent. Even the movie's promotions hock
the fact that the killer "is setting the trap"
for his hunter.
The previews also do a good job of letting
you know who the killer is. They do that
subtle leaving-out-just-enough-info
about-a-main-character thing that serial -
killer movie previews do, so that you begin
to wonder why they didn't give you more i n -
formation. . . oh, wait, is it because he's the
killer?
But if you see the previews for "Switch
back" and can't figure out the entire movie,
then go see it. In it's own weird way, it's a
bargain.
