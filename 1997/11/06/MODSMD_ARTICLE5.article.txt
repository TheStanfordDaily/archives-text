# Existing handbooks offer model to ASSU
## Course guidance 
### Allison Hays Staff writer 
As the ASSU Senate begins to
plan its recently approved course
guide, existing handbooks could
provide insight into what to do as
well as what not to do.
There are several course guides
created by students for individual
academic areas such as economics,
earth sciences and engineering.
These are distributed to students on
paper or electronically, usually once
a year.
According to ASSU Senate
1 )eputy ("hair Matt Spence, the new
course guide will concentrate quali
tative and quantitative information
for students who now only have ac
cess to "scattered information."
A guide in the School of Engi
neering produced by Tau Beta Pi,
the Stanford engineering honor so
ciety. has met with some success al
though several problems exist, said

Tau Beta Pi Vice President Jeshuah
Sniderman, a eoterminal student.
Started several years ago, the
course guide provides descriptions
of student opinion based on class
evaluation forms and is available
online. The University provides the
honor society with comments from
evaluations but not quantitative
data.
"We review all the course quotes
and pick the ones that are indicative
of the general nature of the course,"
explained junior Karthik Rau, sec
retary of Tau Beta Pi. "The guide is
mostly helpful for the ... courses
where engineering students have
more flexibility in their schedules."
Engineering professors say stu
dent opinion consistently influences
course enrollment. Assoc. Mechan
ical Engineering Prof. Rolf Paste
has had to limit the enrollment of
some of his classes in the past few
years.
"I don't know whether it is
through word of mouth or through
the course guides," he said, "hut
these factors do make a difference as
to how many students show up."
According to Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Umran Inan, the
guides are most helpful in selecting
electives. "In classes which are not
required hv the major, it is clear that
the opinions in the guides are very
influential," he said.
Students have responded posi
tively to the course guides but iden
tify a few problems, such as that the
guides are not up to date, do not pro
vide quantitative data and are not

widely advertised.
"I was vaguely aware that they
existed," said Matt McCambridge. a
senior majoring in mechanical engi
neering. "However, they are useful
in theory. There are certain courses
that everyone has to take, but know
ing what quarter to take the course
and getting the lowdown on certain
professors is crucial."
But senior Kurt Gross, also a me
chanical engineering major, said he
didn't know the guide existed.
"They are probably not publicized
well," he guessed.
Many of the descriptions in the
course guides are not updated, some
dating back to the 1989-90 school
year. But not all student are both
ered by that.
"I feel that teaching styles do not

change drastically over the years for
a given class, and it is not a big issue,"
said senior electrical engineering
major Bennet Tarng.
Sniderman's response to the crit
icism is that they are valid. "Our top
priority is to update the whole sys
tem which has moved from paper to
Internet," he said. "We do not have
access to quantitative data, and we
plan on advertising after the system
is updated."
The ASSU officers in charge of
the course guide are optimistic
about its success. "One of the
ASSU's major strengths is its ability
to publicize its own efforts," ex
plained ASSU Vice President Ben
Decker, a coterminal student. "The
course guide will be distributed on a
large magnitude, and you won't
have to actively seek it out. It will

seek you out."
Paper copies will improve stu
dents' access to the guide, said
ASSU President Emily Andrus, a
senior. "Many other course guides
are solely on the [World Wide)
Web." she said. "However, the win
ter course guide will be in a hard
copy form so that there will not be
any technical or access difficulties."
In order to determine how often
the guide should be distributed, ac
cording to Decker, the ASSU will
consider student input and conduct
a demand analysis. In addition, the
nature of this course guide will be
largely quantitative, providing rat
ings on textbook prices, the distribu
tion of students of various majors
taking the class and the quality of
teaching.
