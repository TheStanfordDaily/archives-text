# Existing handbooks offer model to ASSU
## Course guidance 
### Allison Hays Staff writer 
As the ASSU Senate begins to
plan its recently approved course
guide, existing handbooks could
provide insight into what to do as
well as what not to do.
There are several course guides
created by students for individual
academic areas such as economics,
earth sciences and engineering.
These are distributed to students on
paper or electronically, usually once
a year.
According to ASSU Senate
1 )eputy ("hair Matt Spence, the new
course guide will concentrate quali
tative and quantitative information
for students who now only have ac
cess to "scattered information."
A guide in the School of Engi
neering produced by Tau Beta Pi,
the Stanford engineering honor so
ciety. has met with some success al
though several problems exist, said

Tau Beta Pi Vice President Jeshuah
Sniderman, a eoterminal student.
Started several years ago, the
course guide provides descriptions
of student opinion based on class
evaluation forms and is available
online. The University provides the
honor society with comments from
evaluations but not quantitative
data.
"We review all the course quotes
and pick the ones that are indicative
of the general nature of the course,"
explained junior Karthik Rau, sec
retary of Tau Beta Pi. "The guide is
mostly helpful for the ... courses
where engineering students have
more flexibility in their schedules."
Engineering professors say stu
dent opinion consistently influences
course enrollment. Assoc. Mechan
ical Engineering Prof. Rolf Paste
has had to limit the enrollment of
some of his classes in the past few
years.
