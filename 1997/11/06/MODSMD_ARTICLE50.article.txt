## Vertigo 
### 
Obsession. Desire. Mystery. Love.
Alfred Hitchcock understood these things like no one else
and brought them to life on the screen like no one else. As an
embodiment of those troublesome emotions and ideas, "Ver
tigo" is a Hitchcock gem. A semi-precious stone. Well, okay, a
hunk of diamond.
The late Jimmy Stewart is John, or "Scottie," Ferguson, a
detective who retires from the police force after a bad rooftop
chase in which he discovers he has acrophobia. He's scared of
heights and whenever the fear hits him, he gets dizzy — a.k.a.
vertigo. An old college friend calls him up and asks him to fol
low his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak) who's been acting funny.
Scottie takes the job after seeing that Madeleine is one very
beautiful woman. While following her around San Francisco
and eventually rescuing her from drowning in the Bay, he falls
madly in love with her. And after the rescue, Madeleine begins
to return the feeling.
The whole rescue scenario is kind of interesting. After
Scottie plays lifeguard, he brings the semi-conscious
Madeleine to his apartment. When she comes to completely,
she's in his bed with all of her clothes off. Of course the clothes
were wet and all, but really Scottie!
The movie doesn't end there, but I don't want to give any
thing away. Scottie eventually becomes obsessed with a
woman who closely resembles Madeleine, and he decides to
try to remake her in his love's image. This film definitely has
its surprises, which makes up for the sometimes lagging pace.
There isn't much dialogue in this movie. Instead, visuals
cram the viewer's brain with ideas and understanding. Red
and green dominate the Film's palette and for a good reason.
Hitchcock wanted the red to connote desire and the green,
mystery. When Madeleine wears a shimmery green cape in the
blood red backdrop of Artie's, the restaurant where Scottie
first sees her, the image is magnificent.
Images like these deserve more than one look so that's why
now is the time to buy "Vertigo" on tape. That's right — don't

bother renting it — just buy it, especially if
you missed the re-release in San Francisco
last fall and the Stanford Film Society's
showing of it this fall. You can get a really
nice widescreen recording of the newly re
stored version, digitally mastered with THX.
What does that mean? It means that you can
get the best-looking and best-sounding
video copy of this classic that has ever been
available. This matters because Hitchcock
filmed "Vertigo" using Vista Vision, a
widescreen filming process which "pan and
scan" video versions mutilate.
So maybe there wasn't as much fuss about
the restoration of "Vertigo" as there was of
the Star Wars Trilogy — no new aliens or
added footage — but Universal did pull out
over $1 million to have it restored by Robert
A. Harris and James Katz, who also restored
"My Fair Lady." They made new prints of the
film because the old ones were deteriorating,
and not only that, they went the whole nine
yards and made the print 70 mm. This trans
lates into a very impressive widescreen, or
"letterbox," video version.

They also re-recorded the soundtrack from the original
music recording and newly made sound effects. (All this nec
essary info can be gleaned from the AMC documentary at the
end of the new video version).
Another great thing about "Vertigo" is that it's a virtual
tour of San Francisco and the vicinity. Coit Tower can be seen
from the window of Scottie's apartment and the Exploratori
um can be seen in the background of another shot. When
Scottie follows Madeleine around, she goes to the Mission
Dolores and the Palace of the Legion of Honor.
The climactic rescue takes place at Fort Point, which is a
very romantic spot right under the San Francisco side of the

Golden Gate Bridge, and is still pretty much as it was in the
movie. A tender moment between Scottie and Madeleine
takes place in a redwood forest, possibly Muir Woods and the
two share an extremely passionate kiss at the pacific shore,
punctuated with crashing waves. Several key scenes take place
at the mission at San Juan Bautista, about an hour and half
south of here. The place looks pretty much the same today,
but don't look for the tower— Hitchcock had it built for the
film.
Tourist-value aside, "Vertigo" is a great film, worthy of a
massive restoration and worthy of your obsession.
