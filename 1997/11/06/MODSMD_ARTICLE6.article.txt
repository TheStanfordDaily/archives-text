.Stanford students will be given
the opportunity to assess the rela
tionship between theology and acad
emia this weekend at an on-campus
forum sponsored by several local
( hristian organizations.
The Veritas Forum, a four-day
event, will feature speakers as well as
music and theater performances
about truth and faith. Neurobiology
Prof. Mill Newsome will kick off the
forum on Thursday evening at Krcs
ge auditorium with a speech entitled
"Science & Faith: A Personal
View."
Many other Stanford professors,
as well as Virginia Congressman
Frank Wolf and Christian intellectu
al Os Guinness, are scheduled to
speak later in the weekend. Mroad
way actor Mruce Kuhn and The Ba
sics, a musical duo of Stanford grad
uates. will also perform.

Senior Cameron Doolittle, stu
dent co-chair of the project, said he
feels that the forum is intended for
both Christians and non-Christians.
"We want to increase dialogue on
truth,"he said. "If there is a capital T
truth out there, we want to know
what it is. The scientific community
often runs under the assumption that
there isn't one."
Doolittle added that the forum
has been sponsored by a majority of
the different Christian organizations
on campus including Campus Cru
sade for Christ, Intervarsity Christ
ian Fellowship and the Catholic
( ommunity at Stanford.
The forum has been a joint effort
among these Christian communities
as well ascertain off-campus congre
gations. Dave Dettoni, assistant di
rector of university ministries at the
Menlo Park Presbyterian Church,
heads a group which has worked two
years to bring the forum to campus.
The first Veritas Forum took
place in IIW2l l W2 at Harvard University.
Independent forums based on the
original model have been held at uni

versities all over the East Coast, in
cluding Yale University and the Uni
versity of Florida. The Stanford pro
ject, and a another forum taking
place this weekend at UC-Berkelcy,
are the first Veritas Forums on the
West Coast.
After attending the forum at
Yale, Dettoni thought it would be in
teresting to try the same thing at

Stanford. He went on to discuss and
formulate the idea with Dean of the
Chapel Robert Gregg and Christian
groups across campus.
Events are scheduled throughout
the day at Tresidder Union, Kresge
Auditorium and Memorial Church.
Musical performances will also be
held in the Coffee House on Friday
and Saturday evenings.
