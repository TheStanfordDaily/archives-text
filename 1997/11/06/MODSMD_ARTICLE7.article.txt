# Sleep: 'Balm of hurt minds, chief nourished
## 
### Ariana Garfinkel Contributing writer 
Macbeth may not have been the
brightest guy in Shakespeare, hut he did
get one thing right: the value of sleep. I le
calls sleep the "balm of hurt minds, great
nature's second course, chief nourisher in
life's feast." Nearly 4( K > years later, sleep
remains just as crucial, but Stanford stu
dents live in a chronically sleep-deprived
culture.
Students should average eight or nine
hours of sleep per night, according to Jed
Black, a researcher at the Stanford Sleep
Disorders Clinic and Research Center II
that statement makes you snicker, consid
er how many lectures you have dozed
through in the past week or how many
mornings your alarm has failed to wrench
you from bed.
Not surprisingly, sleep deprivation is
extremely high among college students.
A lW3studv by Cowell found that on the
average, a mere 8.7 percent of students
feel they get adequate sleep.
"The biggest sleep disorder in college
age students is not getting enough sleep."
Black said. People can cope with substan
tial sleep debt to some extent, but a num
ber of immediate consequences of poor
sleep habits have been observed in re
search subjects.

Some of the symptoms Blaek listed as
occurring "directly proportional to the
amount of sleep" include difficulty re-

maining awake, decreased ability to con
centrate or locus, lowered reading com
prehension and trouble memorizing new
information.
Evidence of insufficient sleep also ap
pears in the form of consistent daytime
tiredness or napping, according to Black.
"II you are well-rested, no matter how
boring the topic you're listening to. you
shouldn't fall asleep during a talk or
class," he said.
Though many students intentionally
sacrifice their rest for the sake of acade
mics or their social life, not nil lossol sleep
is by design. Sleep disturbances such as
insomnia, sleep apnea and narcolepsy
keep many students from achieving
healthy sleep patterns.
"Just about every sleep disorder that
we can diagnose, we see in college stu
dents," said William I)ement, director ol
the Stanford Sleep Disorders Research
Center.
Senior Ryan Snyder said he has had
difficulty falling asleep at night for as long
as he can remember. "I was an insomniac

at eight years old." he
recalled. "It's be
cause I'm always
thinking. my
mind's still working.

and I can't fall asleep
until I solve something."

Chronic insomnia affects up to
one in three adults in America, and can
involve difficulty falling asleep, early

waking or frequent awakenings in the
night with trouble falling asleep again.
Stress is often an important factor in the
onset of insomnia, though Black ex
plained that a biological predisposition to
the disorder must exist for it to develop.
"Everyone doesn't have the same po
tential lor insomnia, there are people who
will not have it," Black said, even if po
tentially triggering conditions such as
stress are present.
Another common disorder among col
lege students is delayed sleep phase syn
drome. Someone with this condition
might think of herself as a "night person"
because she can't fall asleep until late at
night and then wakes up late in the day.
Dement said the ideal sleeping hours
are midnight to K a.m., but if one's biolog
ical clock is delayed, one simply cannot
fall asleep that early.
"Students tend to reinforce this whole
process by their actual activity," Dement
said. Hut they can also combat the syn

drome by
waking

early for several days and getting bright
light exposure, which causes the sleep pe
riod to occur earlier, he said.
Some students try to induce sleep
quickly through the use of sleeping pills
or alcoholic drinks, hut the experts said
these techniques rarely solve sleeping
problems, and, in fact, can exacerbate the
condition.
Sleeping pills lead to unnatural sleep
and shifts in sleep phases, while alcohol
can actually reduce sleep efficiency over
time and make it more difficult to fall
asleep, Black said.
"I don't believe in sleeping pills," Sny
der said. "I'd think I'd be better off just
not being able to sleep than being
drugged."
Proper treatment of clinical sleep dis
orders must depend on the individual, as
sleep is complex and varies from person
to person, Black added.
