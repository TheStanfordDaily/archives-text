# Just say 'No more'
## Revising the war on drugs 
### Molly Masland 
Former Secretary of State George Shultz and Nobel
Laureate economist Milton Friedman advocated educa
tion, treatment and legalization yesterday as a new ap
proach to solving the U.S. drug problem.
As part of a conference that continues today at the
Hoover Institution, Shultz and Friedman, along with a
panel of distinguished public policy researchers, argued
that current U.S. drug enforcement measures have
failed.
"Despite massive government spending and enforce
ment efforts, the basic problem is still there." said Shultz.
"If anything, it's worse and is spreading around the
world."
Organized by Joseph McNamara, a I loover research
fellow and the retired police chief of San Jose, the con
ference is being attended by law enforcement leaders
from around the country.
"The area of drug control is highly controversial."
said McNamara. "The purpose of this conference is to
bring people together to think collectively, and hopeful
ly by tomorrow we will get some solutions."
The primary goal of yesterday's panel discussion was
to examine why U.S. drug policies have failed and to ad
dress specific solutions.
According to Shultz. a Hoover distinguished fellow,
the criminalization of drug use creates an enormous
profit incentive and has resulted in a thriving interna
tional drug trade amounting to $4(H) billion per year.
"It is an immensely profitable criminal industry and
any real solution has to start by getting the profits out of
the system," Shultz said.
He also argued that the government needs both to re
examine how it views drug users and concentrate on
their treatment instead of incarceration.
"How should we regard a drug user â€” as a criminal
or a person with a health problem?"
Shult/ asked. "We need to focus on
treating the drug problem as a pub
lic health issue, not a criminal
issue."
Friedman's presentation focused
on the harmful effects of U.S. drug
policies on American society and
compared the criminalization of

drug use to that of alcohol during the
Prohibition. He argued that these
policies have resulted in widespread
law enforcement corruption and in
fringement (>n constitutional rights.
" There are 1.6 million people in
prison on drug charges, even more
when the numbers on parole or su
pervision are added," said Fried
man, a Hoover senior research fel
low. "The U.S. government has no
responsibility to use force to restrict

or prevent adults from taking
drugs."
Friedman also said drug enforce
ment efforts have reinforced racism
and destroyed the inner cities.
"The objects of enforcement are
disproportionately black," said
Friedman. "The I Jnited State's clos
est competitor in the incarceration
rate of blacks is South Africa under
the apartheid system."
Lindesmith Center Director

Ethan Nadelmann, who runs the
think tank established to examine
drug policy issues, gave an impas
sioned presentation outlining pos
sible solutions. He criticized the
current policy approach emphasiz
ing abstinence from drugs and ar
gued that "the challenge is learning
to live with drugs so that they cause
the least possible harm to our soci
ety.
"America has never been drug

free, is not now drug-free and never
will be drug-free," said Nadelmann.
"Drugs are here to stay."
Nadelmann argued that research
shows the "Just Say No" approach
advocating drug abstinence does not
work on kids. Simply telling kids not
to take drugs is not effective in re
ducing drug problems, according to
Nadelmann.
In addition to education, Nadel
mann advocated a public health ap

proach. similar to the "harm reduc
tion" policy used in many European
countries, by providing services such
as needle exchanges and methadone
clinics for heroin addicts.
Above all, the panelists agreed
that American society as a whole
should take a humanitarian ap
proach toward solving the drug
problem instead of relying on dra
conian drug enforcement policies
that don't work.
