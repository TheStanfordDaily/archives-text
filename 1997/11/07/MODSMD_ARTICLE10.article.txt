United States warns Iraq
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Clinton adminis
tration warned Iraq yesterday it could face military
action or economic sanctions if it continues to bar
U.N. inspections of its weapons facilities.
"I think sufficient warnings have been given,"
Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters at
the Pentagon, asserting that Iraq's blockade of U.N.
inspection teams and its admitted tampering with
surveillance cameras are clear violations of the 1991
cease-fire accords that ended the Persian Gulf War.
For the fourth time yesterday, Saddam Hussein
barred U.S. members of an international weapons
inspection team from entering the Persian Gulf
country to look for biological and chemical
weapons.

guin province, a sugar-producing area near the
island's eastern tip, according to a reporter in
Havana contacted by telephone.
Hie bus, operated by the Giron line, apparently
tried to out-run the train at a railroad crossing, strik
ing the center of the bus and dragging it several yards
down the tracks, the reporter said.

guin province; the other was a Havana resident.
Yesterday's crash was the deadliest traffic acci
dent in Cuba in recent years.
