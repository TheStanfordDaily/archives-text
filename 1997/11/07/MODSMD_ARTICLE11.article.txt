SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A
judge withdrew his nomination for a
seat on a federal appeals court yes
terday after admitting he lied about
being the brother of a black boy shot
to death by whites in Birmingham,
Ala., in 1963.
"1 am sorry that my misstate
ments about my background have
caused such unintended conse
quences," U.S. District Judge James
Ware said in a statement.
"I am deeply committed to the
cause of civil rights and do not wish
to be seen, as is being suggested, as
using the unfortunate tragedy which
befell Virgil Ware as trying to better
myself at someone else's expense."

The 51-year-old judge, who had
been nominated to the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals by Presi
dent Clinton, has been telling inter
viewers and legal audiences for sev
eral years that his life changed
direction the day his 13-year-old
brother Virgil was shot while riding
on the handlebars of Ware's bicycle
in racially turbulent Birmingham.
From then on. Ware was quoted as
saying, his mission in life was to see
that justice prevails.
Early yesterday, however. Ware
issued a statement to The Associat
ed Press saying his tale was "not the
truth."
"I regret my lack of honesty," he

said.
His admission came after he
learned that The Birmingham News
reported that the family of Virgil
Ware disputed his claims.
Later yesterday, Sen. Jeff Ses
sions, R-Ala., a member of the .Sen
ate Judiciary Committee, called on
Clinton or Ware himself to withdraw
the nomination. "1 was deeply trou
bled to learn that Judge Ware has
not been truthful regarding his child
hood in Birmingham," Sessions said.
The shooting of Virgil Ware
came the same day as the infamous
Sixteenth Street Baptist Church
bombing that killed four little
black girls.
