## Notebook Searching for altruism 
### 
COMMIJNI FY SI KVK I is no
novel concept lo us. Neither is
kindness or altruism or charity. As
part ot an enlightened institution ol learn
ing. we all like to hope that we are good
peopk with compassionate hearts. It's
part ol our American ethos to want to
care loi the needs of the less fortunate;
it's part of oui individual impulse
whethei by religious conviction, moral
principle or personal nature to want to
do good.
Hut as heartening oui benevolent aspi
rations may he. altruism is not what our
society needs. Not that it is a had thing to
want to do good; we all know the world
needs more good hearted people. ( haiity
becomes a bad thing when il is the extent
ol the good we are willing to do, a veneer
ol Millie marked by token acts ol kind
ness to cover up the real impulse in us.
v\ liieh is not to really care about whatever
doesn't concern us.
It took me a while to realize this hum
bling reality about myself. I grew up
doing community service at soup kitchens
and nursing homes, donating old clothes
and even some nice clothes to charity,
making lood packages with classmates for
homeless shelters whenever the holidays
came around. I considered all these things
an expression ol my goodwill toward the
unfortunate; not once did it cross my
mind that it was wrong that they were
there 111 the first place.
It's hard to continue with token acts of
goodwill after we realize they are but
scratches 011 the surface. What is one lunch
out of a lifetime ol hunger? The more we
think about the true magnitude ol the
problems, the more powerless we feel and
the more we turn to apathy. So we try not
to think 100 hard. We consider it a simple
fact ol life that some people go hungry,
and we tr\ to comfort ourselves with the
thought that il we can't solve the prob
lems. at least we've done something good.
Mill that perspective is not enough to
keep compassion alive. We grow up being
taught the values ol kindness and empa
thy trademarks ol the American people:
oui high schools encourage or sometimes
require us to lullill community service

hours; institutions are eager as always to
organize community service activities for
us to participate in. Mut for all our eager
ness to do good, we have difficulty con
ceiving of the situations we see as any
thing but opportunities for us to extend,
out of the goodness of our hearts, some of
our blessings to those beneath us. Rarely,
11 ever, do we question why we are so for
tunate while they are not, or why we sub
consciously view ourselves as above
them.
It's a big step from secretly considering
yoursell a person with a heart of gold to
realizing with humility that your heart is
only gold plated. It's a humiliating real
ization. but one that we need to make at
some point in order to really make a dif
ference. (ioodness isn't about stooping
down from your pedestal to lend a hand
to someone below you; it isn't about
packing lunches for the homeless at
I hanksgiving and donating your old
clothes at Christmas. I ruly understanding
what goodness is reaches deeper than
that, so deep that it pulls you down from
your pedestal and shames you.
In our academic circles we criticize
America's pride in iis virtue and point to
the inherent selfishness of its professedly
humanitarian missions around the world.
Mut we fail to see the ambivalence in our
own attitudes and actions. Not that peo
ple who do community service or philan
thropic acts ire acting out ol selfishness;
far from it, I know and deeply respect
many people who are genuinely commit
ted to doing good things in this world.
The point is that many of us like to
believe we are doing good without realiz
ing the extent to which goodwill or
perhaps simple morality calls us to act.
Community service and philanthropy
may not be difficult to embrace, but going
beyond these to what lies below the sur
face is. It is a worthy challenge to look
into ourselves and see how deep the gold
in us goes whether it will wear off and
expose simple rock when we enter the
world ol politics, business, finance and
law. or whether it is deep enough to last.
