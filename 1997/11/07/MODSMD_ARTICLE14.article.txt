## Stop being actively passive! 
### 
WHEN I gradu
ated from high
school, I took
advantage of my few min
utes at the podium to
declare my candidacy for
the 2012 presidential
election. And yeah, it got
a good laugh and some

grins from most of the crowd, and I smiled
along with them because, after all, how
could I blame them for not knowing I was
serious? And here I am now, rapidly near
ing the four-year anniversary of that day,
only this time I don't know where I'll be
come next September.
But come November 2012.1 know exact
ly where I want to be: on your ballot. You
may be wondering: 1) how am 1 going to get
there, and 2) what I am going to do in the
meantime. They are particularly relevant
questions because soon 1 will leave the
"academy" for the "real world," if you will,
and apparently I'm supposed to get a job.
I see my senior colleagues dressed up
more and more often, going to this or that
interview. At the Career Fair sponsored by
the CPPC not so long ago, table after table
of well dressed people were recruiting and
schmoozing and giving out free stuff. They
blocked the mosÂ» bike populated areas on
campus, causing tremendous traffic jams
that forced us all to mingle with the corpo
rate elite. Just flip through today's Daily
and you'll see lull page ads (is that suppose
to impress us?) for various consulting firms
or investment banking companies trying to
seduce members of our talented masses.

And the scary thing is, some of you peo
ple are falling for it! Is this the same campus
that refused to let Taco Bell move in to
Tresidder Union because it's owned by Pepsi
Co.? Is this the same campus that complains
about how the ASSU Senate doesn't do any
thing? Is this the same campus that fills all ol
White Plaza to cheer on Jesse Jackson as he
blasts Props 187 and 209 and the proposed
English-only initiative? Is this the same cam
pus where thousands of students perform
some kind of public service?
Correct me if I'm wrong (e-mail
prez@leland), but I was under the impres
sion that the great majority of us were
interested in making a positive impact on
people and society. Somehow, I just don't
think consulting and investment banking
mesh with that idea.
Last year's Public Service Career Oppor
tunities Fair was held in the Oak rooms of
Tresidder. Manning a table for Stanford in
Government, there were so few students
milling around that I had time to hit on my
future girlfriend for half an hour (awww
yeah!). Is your commitment to society and
your fellow men and women so superficial?
What is your selling price? Can you be
bought off by the promises of a $60 K or
more a year job?
Yes, it sounds like I'm admonishing the
entire Stanford student body, but people,
you need it! I realize that as a student, no
matter what year you are, you're pretty
darn busy with classes and such. Perhaps
when I say to you that there are children in
the surrounding communities who would
love to have a tutor or a big brother or a big

sister, you can honestly tell me you are too
busy. Perhaps when I ask if you can spare a
few hours one weekend to help build low
income housing, or an afternoon to play
soccer with some kids, you can honestly tell
me you are too busy. Perhaps you can go
out and party all weekend long, and once
you recover from your drunken stupor you
can tell me you are too busy. But if you
accept a job that has little or no usefulness
for humanity just because you can, you have
no excuse.
You may think my presidential aspira
tions too high or my e-mail address a bit
presumptuous or my tone overly self-righ
teous. But I consider it a right and a duty for
each and every one of us to make our most
valiant effort to leave the earth better off
than when we entered it. I choose the role
of president as my vehicle for affecting
social change because I cannot think of any
occupation more suited for the task. You
and 1 both can and should use the skills and
experiences we have gained at Stanford (no
thanks to the administration) to help
address the social inequities that we all
seem so very willing to demonstrate against.
But if getting a high paying job is really
all that you're here for, we might as well
quit the "social justice charade" and polite
ly tell our surrounding communities and the
rest of the world that Stanford students and
graduates actively endorse the status quo.

Darron Evans, with his public policy
degree next June, refuses to be any useless
company's biatch.
