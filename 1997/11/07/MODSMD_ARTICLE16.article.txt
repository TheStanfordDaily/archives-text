Inconsiderate morons
on bikes at Stanford
Stanford students arc supposed to be
among the best and brightest in the world,
but it is amazing how so many of us become
complete morons when we hop on our
bikes. For this reason, I was very interested
to read your article on Wednesday, Nov. 5,
about "Police on Bicycles."
While 1 could rant for several pages
about the idiotic habits that Stanford bikers
adopt, there is one particularly infuriating
biking offense that I hope this new policy
will help to eliminate. 1 speak of the practice
of leaving bikes so that they block the free
movement of the disabled.
1 he front of Green Library makes a won
derful example. There is a blue sign there

that savs: "HANDICAPPED ACCESS —
DC) NOT BLOCK." Still, almost every time
\ ride past Green, 1 see at least two bikes
directly blocking the entrance to the
wheelchair ramp. I have heard that before I
arrived at Stanford, there was an individual
who would throw offending bikes in the
Hoop. I don't know if he / she / it still does
this, but I do not intend to find out.
The folks in wheelchairs are not the only
disabled people who have problems with
bikes. Students tend to leave their bikes in
front of Meyer Library on the side that faces
"The Thinker." While there may be enough
room for a wheelchair to pass (and fre
quently. there isn't even enough room for
that!), a blind person using a cane is bound
to get tangled in the mass of spokes, pedals,
kick stands and handlebars. Not only will
vour bike bo knocked over on the next bike.

which will tall on ihc next bike, which will, in
turn, fall on the hike after that, etc., but the
blind person in question runs a good chanve
of being injured.
Some time ago. the Stanford Police
promised the disabled community at Stan
ford that they would start to ticket and
remove bikes that blocked disabled-accessi
ble routes. Now thnt they have this program.
I ask them to start living up to this promise,
lo the students, I ask consideration and
respect. Look before you park your bike.
Ask yourself if you are blocking a
wheelchair path or if your bike will surprise
a blind person. It only takes a second to
check, and it can spare someone else a huge
amount of grief.
