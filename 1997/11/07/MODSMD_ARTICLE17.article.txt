44"\7DURE EITHER VERY
smart." lie said, "or very rich."
JL I started to explain oh. no,
actually I wasn't an Oxford student but just
visiting from Stanford — when I realized
this wouldn't change his opinion much.
Anyway, the subway train drowned me out
and for the rest of the ride, he grimaced
across the aisle at me and shook his head
back and forth ever so slightly — "another
rich American."
Apparently, Stanford has a reputation
even in England. We are all extremely
wealthy, mostly smart and eat health food
like granola and sunflower seeds all day.
We dress badly.
"Americans pull their socks all the way
up," one Oxford student informed a friend
of mine. I've heard equally shocking things,
mostly all accusations that are about a
decade late. 1 tried to persuade a guy over
dinner that most of us do wear things other
than yellow I shirts and sweat pants. We're
not all into grunge: nappiness is only when
necessary.
In general, through all the misconcep
tions that a few perhaps nonrepresentative
English have shared with me. I realize it's
regarded as pretty unfortunate to be an

American over here.
First of all. we stole everything.
One guy tried to persuade us that Amer
icans copied our sports from England.
"Baseball is in essence cricket," he said and
actually believes that too. The similarities,
however, only go so far as the rules of the
sport and not necessarily the skill of the
players.
For instance, even though we suddenly
have professional football / soccer teams,
American football is a terrible attempt at
playing England's game. Rather ungrate
fully, we call the game soccer and further
demonstrate our disrespect by calling
"football boots," cleats. For shame.
I've been told that overall, Americans
aren't too bright.
Because most of the subjects in my ran
dom sample (1 talked to whomever was sit
ting nearby in a pub called The King's
Arms) had not found time to make a trip
across the Atlantic, 1 assume they get most
of their information from the Baywatch
and Friends episodes broadcast on televi
sion. They also tune into Zena and Battle
ship (ialactica. which I guess don't do much
to defend us either. In any case, most of
what they see suggests we're lacking

upstairs.
1 have to admit, this perception is a little
harder to disprove than the others. Take a
look at their quiz shows like 15-to-l and a
room of average Stanford students
wouldn't even understand some of the
questions (partly because of the host's thick
accent). In any case, we probably wouldn't
bother trying since the prize for enduring a
round is usually something like a dictionary
and never $20,000 in cash.
Furthermore, at every cross walk in
London road crews have painted bright flu
orescent reminders to "Look left!" On the
other side, predictably, are equally shock
ing "Look right!" signs splattered across
the blacktop. Despite this, we always look
the wrong way. Silly Americans.
And I can't help but notice every time I
board the Underground, London's subway
system, I hear a distinctly American accent
repeat over and over to all of us dazed pas
sengers to "Mind the gap!" between the
train and the platform.
T his is particularly striking because
American English is definitely a different
language from English English "I was
queuing for a bap when I realized I was
skint." It's like playing a recording of a

Southern gentleman in the middle of the
Boston subway. So. 1 must wonder whether
the Underground administration thought
perhaps that confused Americans would
understand a little faster, hearing the direc
tions corning from one of their own. I may
be looking to much into this.
We're too loud.
English people jump back when an
American stalls talking. We may be the
perfectly reasonable volume for a street
conversation in New York. but for some
reason to them we're incredibly rude.
An obviously American student walked
into the used books section of Mlackwells'
Bookshop and called out as he made Ins
way to the counter. "I le\, can you take me
to where there are books by. like, Virginia
Woolf. please?" The employee took at le;isi
three steps back and counted to four before
she softly asked him to repeat the question.
She had to recuperate from the shock.
It has gotten to the point where I try to
deny my identity as a tourist, at least one
from America. I thought that was some
thing you only need to do in I ranee. Israel
or I londuras.
Last week I guess I had succeeded in
covering up my identity pretty well. "Are

you from Japan?" a man asked as he leaned
toward me and scrutinized.
Something in the way I sal 01 breathed
suddenly gave it away and he laughed."()h.
an American." I smiled but looked a little
milled.
"Oh, well don't fee I had." he said with a
little pat on the arm, "Now, German,
now that would be bad."
Well, now I feel bad enough to go ahead
and defend the tourists of the world, inehul
ing those who pile out of the buses onto lite
Stanford Oval each weekday. I'm glad lhc\
come and take pictures and ask for directions
to the I residdcr Rodin Auditorium. I'm glad
they like us enough to leave beautiful < »ei
many, Japan and Ingland to visit. I'm son\
they have to endure tourist prejudice.
And I'm sorry a couple Americans
thought it proper to warn me that the
I nglish would be sourlv traditional,
unfriendly and pungent l out ism is a chance
to find out everyone was wrong all aloin>.
