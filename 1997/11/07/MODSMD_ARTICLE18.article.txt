## Bouncing back Soccer seeks to rebound in regular-season finale 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
The No. 10 Cardinal men's
soccer team closes out the regular
season and looks to bounce back
from last weekend's losses against
Santa Clara Sunday.
The match against the Broncos
brings to a close an 18-game sea
son that saw Stanford (13-2-2,3-0-
1 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) go unbeaten for the first 16
games.

MEM'S SOCCER
■ SUNDAY: No. 10 Stanford (13-
2-2, 3-0-1) at Santa Clara (6-6),
7 p.m.

That streak built up to a show
down against No. I Indiana last
Friday, which the Hoosiers won 2-
1. Two days later, the Cardinal
lost again — this time a 1 -0 loss to
unranked San Francisco — drop
ping the team eight notches in the
national rankings, from No. 2 to
No. 10.
Unranked Santa Clara enters
Sunday night's match near the
end of a mediocre season. Going
into last night's game against San
Francisco, the Broncos were 6-6
(1 -0 West Coast Conference).
Traditionally, the Stanford-
Santa Clara matchup results in "a
very ugly game." said junior for
ward A.J. Sauer. "We both plav
the same style. It's going to be a
game where the team that works
the hardest and keeps their shape
wins."
Last weekend the Cardinal
lost some of that shape, Sauer
said, and discussion this week has
focused on working hard and
working together.
"We looked at both games as
setbacks, but it's not the end of
the world." Sauer said. "It was
kind of a team check."
Especially against USF, he
said, "the effort just wasn't where
it needs to be."
This weekend's game offers a
fresh start for the Cardinal as well
as a launching point for postsea
son play. Head coach Bobby
Clark gave players a mini-vaca
tion this week.
After a few days without prac

tice to "clear our heads," Sauer
said, the team returned to the
field yesterday for "one of the
best practices of the year."
Offensively, Santa Clara is led
by Derrick Harris, who has 13
points and live goals this season.
With a .89 goals-against average.
Bronco goalkeeper Joe Cannon
hardly matches up to Cardinal
redshirt freshman Adam Zapala.
A win this weekend would put
a revitalized ( ardinal in good po
sition for next weekend's MPSF
championship game. Stanford
clinched the MPSF Mountain Di
vision title Oct. 19 and will meet
the Pacific Division champion
either No. 5 UCLA or Cal State-
Fullerton — Nov. 16 in Los Ange
les.
A federation title would give
the Cardinal a guaranteed bid to
the NCAA tournament. The
Final Four will be played in Rich
mond, Va., in mid-December.
"All of this other stuff has just
built us up to this point." Sauer
said. "We have 5 1/2 weeks left to
get to where we want to be. Each
game will be a little preparation
for the week ahead."
The nine consecutive weeks
Stanford has spent in the national
rankings marks a school record,
one of many set this year. The '97
Cardinal has established season
records for the longest winning
streak and longest unbeaten
streak, climbed to the highest na
tional ranking ever (No. 2) and
earned Stanford's first-ever No. I
position in the Far West Region.
And by the time the postsea
son is over, the C ardinal may have
several other records — most
wins, highest v\ inning percentage,
fewest losses, most shutouts,
fewest goals allowed and lowest
goals-against average.
Zapala is keeping Stanford on
track for those last two records.
Despite allowing three goals last
weekend, Zapala continues to
have the nation's lowest goals
against average, .34 in 1596 min
utes of play.
Offensively, Sauer leads the
team with 18 points on nine goals.
Freshman forward Corey Wool
folk has four goals and five assists,
and junior midfielder Simon El
liott has three goals and five assists.

Junior midfielder Simon Elliott has three goals and five assists
for the 10th-ranked Cardinal, which wraps up the regular season
