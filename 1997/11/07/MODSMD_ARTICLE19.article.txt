Stanford can ensure a tie with
today's 2 p.m. match against the Sun
Devils (12-11, 3-9). Arizona State
has struggled all year, and the loss of
sophomore setter Jolynn I aatulu to
injury has compounded the prob
lem.
"Arizona State is struggling."
said head coach Don Shaw. "Their
setter got injured, and without her
they're in big trouble. I heir backup
is a walk-on."
While the Sun Devils struggle to
slay above .500, Stanford looks to
continue its reign in the Pac-10. And

been. Arizona State shouldn't be ;i
problem.
Arizona, on the other hand, of
fers a bigger challenge. The Wildcats

(l(i-4, X-4) took a game from the
Cardinal when these two teams met
Oct. 10. Hut more memorable than
the score or Arizona's performance
was the Wildcats' constant trash
talking through the net.
Sunday's noon match will tell
whether or not the Wildcats can

back up their words. Hut the possible
loss of standout sophomore middle
blocker Erin Aldrich could make
that almost impossible. Aldrich went
down with a sprained ankle in game
two against No. 11) Washington State
last weekend and is questionable for
Sunday.

"1 can only assume and expect
that she'll play," Shaw said. "An
zona is probably one o! the toughest
teams we've played this year I Ins
hopefully our last road trip before
(the i-'inal Four in) Spokane."

Stanford's hopes for a top seed in
the NCAA tournament get better
with every easy win. so the matchup
against Arizona is key.
"We just want to work as hard as
we can to put awav these teams
quickly so that our seed goes up, and
we can stay here rather than getting
shipped out," said senior middle
blocker Paula McNamee.
While Stanford is poised to take
its fourth straight Pac-IO champi

battling it out lor second place and a
higher NCAA tournament seeding.
Arizona. Washington State. No.
I c ) Washington and No. 7 USC are
deadlocked in second place, each
with four conference losses. And
the way the Pac-IO standings are
shaping up, the team that emerges
from the pack has a shot at one of
the tournament's top eight seeds.
"The second-place team in the
Pac-10 could be up there." Shaw
said. "The strength of scheduling is
going to come into play. All these
games are big. We just need to take
care of business like we've done all
year and let all that mayhem take
place right below us."

lions for the Pac-10 race, last week

picture. With its loss to then-No. 7
Wisconsin. Penn State toppled from
the top spot in the national rankings,
a position the Nittany Lions have
occupied since beating Stanford
Aug. 23.
Wisconsin moved to fifth and
Penn State dropped to No. 2. allow
ing I ong Beach State to take over as
No. 1.
"It just brings them down to our
level." McNamee said. "Before they
were unbeatable, and having them
lose to Wisconsin takes off the
edge."
Meanwhile, Florida dropped
from the No. 3 position it has held
most of the year, allowing the Cardi
nal to move up a notch. Florida won
three matches over the weekend,
but the questionable strength of the
Southeastern Conference makes
the Gators' 23-1 record less impres
sive.
"Unless [Penn State] has a com
plete collapse, they're going to be a
top seed." Shaw said. "Wisconsin is
right in there. I'd think those two
teams would be high seeds. Now
you have to question Florida's
schedule. Long Beach State is cruis
ing along. Thev would have to be a
top seed. It's going to be interest
