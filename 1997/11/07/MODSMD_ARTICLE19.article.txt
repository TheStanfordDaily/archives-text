Stanford can ensure a tie with
today's 2 p.m. match against the Sun
Devils (12-11, 3-9). Arizona State
has struggled all year, and the loss of
sophomore setter Jolynn I aatulu to
injury has compounded the prob
lem.
"Arizona State is struggling."
said head coach Don Shaw. "Their
setter got injured, and without her
they're in big trouble. I heir backup
is a walk-on."
While the Sun Devils struggle to
slay above .500, Stanford looks to
continue its reign in the Pac-10. And
if the ('ardinal plays as well as it has
been. Arizona State shouldn't be ;i
problem.
Arizona, on the other hand, of
fers a bigger challenge. The Wildcats

(l(i-4, X-4) took a game from the
Cardinal when these two teams met
Oct. 10. Hut more memorable than
the score or Arizona's performance
was the Wildcats' constant trash
talking through the net.
Sunday's noon match will tell
whether or not the Wildcats can

back up their words. Hut the possible
loss of standout sophomore middle
blocker Erin Aldrich could make
that almost impossible. Aldrich went
down with a sprained ankle in game
two against No. 11) Washington State
last weekend and is questionable for
Sunday.

"1 can only assume and expect
that she'll play," Shaw said. "An
zona is probably one o! the toughest
teams we've played this year I Ins
hopefully our last road trip before
(the i-'inal Four in) Spokane."
