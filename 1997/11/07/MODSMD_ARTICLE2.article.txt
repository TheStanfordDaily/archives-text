Romero was gunned down by

revenues.
"The play is a compilation of tes
timonies from various victims of
SOA in Central and South America
that we obtained from the SOA
Watch in Georgia," Rehm said. "A
version of it was performed earlier
this year on the steps of the Capitol.
I shortened the testimonies and
rewrote some transitions so that it
would suit our means."
Participants were motivated to

speak out against the school after
learning of alleged abuses.
"The SO A saddens me greatly,"
said junior Jill Shenker. "It is a bla
tant example of the coercive and vi
olent role the U.S. has consistently
played in Latin America in an at
tempt to maintain power and eco
nomic control.
"They even have a written hand
book on torture techniques,"
Shenkeradded.
"As an American citizen I have
some responsibility for the actions
of the government, and 1 don't want
to be responsible for the abuse and

death of other individuals for any
reason," said junior Lauren
O'Brien. "The people being hurt by
those trained at SOA are simply
folks trying to organize to improve
their lives."
Rehm added that he thinks "the
SOA and the policy it represents is
an abomination. It should be closed,
and the U.S. policy in the region rad
ically changed."
Emily (ioodwin, a freshman actor
in the play, said, "I live in Atlanta,
Ga., and it's an atrocity that 1 have to
live in the same state as SOA."
Schmidt explained that closing

the school is long overdue and said
he wishes that President Clinton
would speak out against it.
In 1986, an unofficial sanctuary
for fleeing El Salvadoran refugees
was created on campus by students.
Because guests may only stay two
weeks on campus according to Uni
versity policy, Schmidt said they
would move the refugees from
house to house to keep them here.
"The tangible stories and faces
were overpowering," Schmidt re
membered.
"We also took a group of Stan
ford students down to Nicaragua

that year. Some of them are still
down there, helping the villagers re
build their lives. The bullet holes in
the walls were proof of the devasta
tion," Schmidt said. "That trip af
fected the lives of many Stanford
students."
Today, about 1,600 Latin Ameri
can and Caribbean soldiers graduate
from the school with most on the pay
roll of the CIA, according to Rehm.
The United Nations Truth Com
mission Report on El Salvador, re
leased in 1993. cited more than 60Sal
vadoran officers for the worst atroci
ties during El Salvador's civil war.

More than two-thirds of the officers
cited were alumni of the school.
In 1993, Massachusetts Con
gressman Joseph Kennedy intro
duced an amendment to the De
fense Appropriations Bill to elimi
nate Department of Defense fund
ing to the school. However, Con
gress voted down the amendment.
Last year, Kennedy introduced a
refined amendment suggesting a
partial cut-down of funding. The
measure failed hy three votes.
" The school is our own and so is
the responsibility," Rehm told the
crowd.
