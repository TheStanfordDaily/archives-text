# Respect on the line in Los Angeles
## Stanford-USC will showcase two teams falling short of expectations 
### Dave Flemming Contributing writer 
I lie Rose Bowl is certainly no
longer pari of the picture, l or that
matter, even last year's postseason
destination the Sun Howl
seems out of reach.
So what's left for a Stanford team
that started the year hoping to con
tend for the conference champi
onship?
Respect.

â–  K)M()RI<( )W: Stanford (4 4,
2-3) at USC (4-4, 2-3), 12:30 p.m.
TV: AIM ' (S I V ('hannels and
27). Radio: K/SD-IM (MO.!).

Alter three straight losses, the
( ardinal (4 4.2 3 Pacific 10 < <>nfer
ence) realizes the general consensus
is that Stanford was overrated at the
beginning of the year and is not as
good as first thought. And that's ex
actly how the players don't want to
he remembered.
"With each game we've lost a lit
tie identity and a little respect, said

seniot tackle (ieoll Wilson. "Hut we
still feel like we're not playing at the
level we're capable of."
"We're ready to go out and win
the next three."
I IS( (4 4,2 3), tomorrow'soppo
nent at the I os Angeles ( oliseum, is
having an equally ft ustrating season
having seen high hopes fade into in
tense criticism.
I hat's why head coach John
Robinson realizes this game means
more than a final hope for the post
season.
When you're sti uggling like both
I JSC and Stanford, "you're fighting
for your sell respect," Robinson said
earlier this week.
It seems each ol the last three
weeks has been a must win situation
for Stanford, but each I'oi dillerent
reasons. Alter the loss to Arizona
Stanford needed a vic tory to stay in
the Rose Howl hunt After falling to
Arizona Stale, a win last week
against I)( I A would have kept the
( ardinal in good position lot one ol
the four bowl berths guaranteed to
the Pac-10.
Hut last week 's 27 7 loss to Hiuirjs
lias pushed Stanford to the re.ll
brink. I he edge of the cliff.
This is it for the < ardinal.

Guard Andrew Kroeker (bottom) and the Stanford offensive line
must improve their protection of quarterback Chad Hutchinson for
Stanford to upend USC tomorrow.
