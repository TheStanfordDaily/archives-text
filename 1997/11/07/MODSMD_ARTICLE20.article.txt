# Respect on the line in Los Angeles
## Stanford-USC will showcase two teams falling short of expectations 
### Dave Flemming Contributing writer 
I lie Rose Bowl is certainly no
longer pari of the picture, l or that
matter, even last year's postseason
destination the Sun Howl
seems out of reach.
So what's left for a Stanford team
that started the year hoping to con
tend for the conference champi
onship?
Respect.

Alter three straight losses, the
( ardinal (4 4.2 3 Pacific 10 < <>nfer
ence) realizes the general consensus
is that Stanford was overrated at the
beginning of the year and is not as
good as first thought. And that's ex
actly how the players don't want to
he remembered.
"With each game we've lost a lit
tie identity and a little respect, said

seniot tackle (ieoll Wilson. "Hut we
still feel like we're not playing at the
level we're capable of."
"We're ready to go out and win
the next three."
I IS( (4 4,2 3), tomorrow'soppo
nent at the I os Angeles ( oliseum, is
having an equally ft ustrating season
having seen high hopes fade into in
tense criticism.
I hat's why head coach John
Robinson realizes this game means
more than a final hope for the post
season.
When you're sti uggling like both
I JSC and Stanford, "you're fighting
for your sell respect," Robinson said
earlier this week.
It seems each ol the last three
weeks has been a must win situation
for Stanford, but each I'oi dillerent
reasons. Alter the loss to Arizona
Stanford needed a vic tory to stay in
the Rose Howl hunt After falling to
Arizona Stale, a win last week
against I)( I A would have kept the
( ardinal in good position lot one ol
the four bowl berths guaranteed to
the Pac-10.
Hut last week 's 27 7 loss to Hiuirjs
lias pushed Stanford to the re.ll
brink. I he edge of the cliff.
This is it for the < ardinal.


Kwesi Legged Daily file
Guard Andrew Kroeker (bottom) and the Stanford offensive line
must improve their protection of quarterback Chad Hutchinson for
Stanford to upend USC tomorrow.

"We're all looking at it as a do
or-die," said senior safety Alistair
White. "Now we're down to our last
life. It's do it. or look forward to next
year for the younger guys."
If Stanford does beat the Tro
jans, a trip to the Las Vegas Bowl or
the Humanitarian Bowl might still
be a possibility. But the Cardinal
much more desperately needs a win
simply to save its season.
"This is a ballgame that we have
to win," said Stanford head coach
Tyrone Willingham.
First Stanford must correct some
recurring problems that have
plagued the team during its three
game losing streak.
First and foremost. Stanford's of
fense has to regain control of the line
of scrimmage. In each of its last
three losses, Stanford's opponent
has primarily used eight and nine
man fronts, stacking the line and try
ing to take away the running game.
And it's worked. In three games,
the Cardinal rushing game has
dropped from second to eighth-best
in the Pac-10, averaging barely one
yard per carry.
"()ur inability to run the football
has been a distinguishing mark (in
the losing streak)," Willingham said.
According to Willingham, even if
teams crowd the line, Stanford still
must run the ball to be successful.
"You have to find a way to bal
ance it up," Willingham said.
One way of making opponents
back off is to throw the ball success
fully. But the Cardinal hasn't been
able to protect quarterback Chad
Hutchinson long enough to make
big plays.
Hutchinson has been sacked 31
times this year and has been bat
tered in the last few games. The
Stanford offensive line, after playing
so well in early October, has simply
not gotten the job done.
"It's been less of a physical
issue," Wilson said. "We need to be
executing better — 50 percent is
knowing where you're going to go."
"We've just had a problem get
ting the protection set."
Things won't be any easier to
morrow against a IJSC team that
uses a similar attacking defense and
leads the Pac-10 in both rushing de
fense and sacks. The Trojans are
seventh-best in the nation at stop
ping the run, allowing a paltry K7
yards per game.
Surprisingly, USC's weakness
has been its secondary. The Trojans'
pass defense ranks worst in the Pac
-10 despite the presence of two All-
America-caliber cornerbacks in ju
nior Daylon McCutcheon and se
nior Brian Kcllv.

Actually, not much has gone as
planned at USC the last two sea
sons. The Trojans were just 6-6 last
year, including a 24-20 loss to the
Cardinal — the first time in 11 sea
sons Robinson had not won at least
eight games. This year IJSC is in
danger of recording back-to-back
non-winning seasons for the first
time since 1961.
USC started poorly this season,
losing its first two games before win
ning four of five. But that hot streak
included narrow wins over
mediocre teams. Last Saturday,
IJSC was crushed 27-0 by Washing
ton.
"Last week," Robinson said, "we
stunk."
While the defense has not played
as well as expected, USC's offense
has been the main problem. The
Trojansare last in the Pac-10in scor
ing offense, averaging only 17.6
points per game.
"We have an offense that seems
to have regressed the last few
weeks." Robinson said. "()ur offen
sive performance is mystifying me.
11 we'd have played any offense up
to this point, I think our defense
would be considered exceptional."
Last week the Trojans hit bot
tom. It was the first time in seven
years IJSC had been shut out, as
Washington limited the Trojans to
157 total yards — only K7 passing.
USC never moved the ball past the
1 luskies' 35-yard line.
Perhaps most disturbing for Tail
back U. has been its pathetic run
ning game, long a source of pride for
a school that produced Frank Gil
ford, Ricky Bell and lleisman Tro
phy winners O.J. Simpson, Mike
Garrett, Charles White and Marcus
Allen.
This season USC is ninth in the
Pac-10 in rushing and does not have
a single back on the conference's
top-10 rushing list. Senior Delon
Washington leads the team with 3X
yards on the ground per game.
The Trojans now have a quarter
back controversy as well. Sopho
more John I ox has been the starter
for most of the year, but with I ISC
last in the conference in total of
fense, Robinson made freshman
Mike Van Raaphorst the starter last
week. Both are listed as possible
starters for Saturday's game.
Stanford's defense has actually
been playing better during the los
ing streak. I cd by senior end Kailee
Wong, who leads the Pac-10 in sacks
and tackles for loss, the defense
hasn't been dominant but has kept
Stanford in games despite poor of
fensive performances.
Judging from how these two
teams match up, tomorrow's game
could end up 9-6. At this point,
though, Stanford will take a win any
way it can get it.
