(8-9-1,2-5)

Stanford (10 7, 5-2 Pacific 10
Conference) faces Arizona State
today, a team fighting as hard as the
Cardinal in its last-ditch effort to
make the playoffs.
I ,ast weekend the Sun I)evils (II

charged victory over then No. I ( >
USC. handing the Women ol hoy
their first loss ever al the Los Ange
les ('oliseum.
Stanford laces a less threatening
opponent Sunday at I p.m. in Ari
zona (K- 1 M,2-5), a team that's been
down on ils luck since Pac I') play
began.
!• ven il the Card wins both
games, the decision will lie out ol its
hands.
The Pac-10 champion earns an
automatic bid to the N( AA tourna
ment, and another lb at large bids
are granted to second place teams

Presently, UCLA leads the Pac

way tie lor second.
"We have to win these iwt

"We have to finish strong, saii
head coach Steve Swanson. I hat':
the only thing we can control
II all goes well in Arizona, the
( ardinal would have a strong case to
take to the NCAA playoft selection
committee: a 7-2 league record, eight
straight wins, a large share of over
time and come-from-behind victo
ries. and a distinguished history.
"()ne thing that might work in our
favor." Fair said, "is that we have a
generally good standing in the
NCAA. Our teams have made it to
the postseason for the last seven
years."
Early in the season, the Cardinal
almost fell out of the hunt. After
going 3-2 in the first two weeks of the
season, the Card proceeded to drop
six of its next seven.
When it lost its first two Pac-1()
matches to CSC and UCLA. Stan
lord's record sagged to a season
worst 4-7.0-2 Pae-10.
Then something snapped. Since
then, the Cardinal has won six
straight, five against Pac-I() teams.
"To be honest, this team's playing
was the most consistent I've ever
coached." Swanson said. "But it's im
portant to get confidence. When we
were playing well but not getting re
sults earlier in the season, our confi
dence suffered."

Hint's all changed in the last three
weeks.
"Our confidence is great right
now, and we're really fighting hard."

Fair said. "But there are always
things to work on. We're still trying
to get everything tightened up in
hack."
