# Gay? Not Gay?

If you read Might magazine, then you know that the following is a cheap and shameless rip-off of their pop
ular outing feature. But if you don't read Might, then you will be completely fooled and fall under the delu
sion that this is an entirely original concept! Three cheers for democracy!
Besides throwing buckets of paint at innocent passerbys in White Plaza and asking embarrassing sex-relat
ed questions for White Plaza Watch, Diversions likes to do some hard-hitting, wife-slapping, man-baiting
investigative journalism. This week, we give you the answer to the question that's been bugging you all year!
Gay or not gay?


Condi Rice
Likes to play the piano, has been spotted at several Indigo Girls concerts
wearing a butch dyke outfit, and is rumored to be trying to get Ellen
Degeneres a tenure track position in the Comparative Literature Department.
Hum.... plus there's that never-fully-explained trip she made to Russia right
before glasnost. Well, perestroika that! Gay? Mas oui!


Gerhard Casper
Besides the fact that his wife Regina is actually a 3-D hologram he ordered
from Industrial Light & Magic, there's that wall-sized picture of Engelbert
Humperdinck resting on his mansion's living room. Plus if you spell his name
backward, you read "Repsac Drahreg," which is clearly German for "Come
over here pretty boy." Oh, and the accent! Who's he trying to kid? Gay!


Marc Wais
A tough one. Yes, it's rumored that our Dean of Students likes to
dress in drag, but his idea of drag is a shirt and tie that don't match.
And yes, it's said that he knows all the lyrics to "South Pacific," but
he can't tell Elaine Page from Betty Buckley. Oh, no sir, not gay!


Emily Andrus
Little do people know that Emily's obsessed with Jodie Foster and
one of the reasons she ran for ASSU President was to impress Jodie.
Reliable sources (her roommate's friend's cousin's boyfriend) attest
that Emily spends Faculty Senate meetings in a daze and mutters
under her breath the whole time, "Jodie! Give me Jodie! Oui gay or
pas gay? You make the call!


Nanci Howe
Okay, so she wants to close all fraternities and open a bunch of
sororities, defined in her working report as "Row houses where only
women live and frolic and give each other back rubs." Hum... Gay!
