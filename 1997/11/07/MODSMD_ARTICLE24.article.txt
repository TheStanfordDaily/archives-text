# THE 						SECRET DIARIES OF AIMEE THANATOGENOS!
## 'My life as a sex toy!' 
### 
Over the past few months, I, Aimee Thanatogenos, have been indun
dated with letters from readers curious about my sex life, and so I've
decided to indulge them. (Actually, most of the letters were misdirected
mail to Santa Claus and only one had to do with my sex life, and that was
from my gynecologist telling me that I had herpes and breaking our next
date.) So here it goes, an unabridged account of my erotic experiences.
First, I lost my virginity to a speck of dust that accidentally landed on
my shirt while I walked down Market St. I had a huge orgasm and stayed
the next few days in bed, smoking cigarettes and inhaling deodorant. A
month later, when my period didn't come and I stayed stuck with commas
and colons, I tried to track down my culprit, only to find out it had fallen
into a ditch and disappeared.
xfrer that I had a dry period broken only by the occasional hooker
and hardware appliance. There were no civilians on the horizon. One,
because I don't sleep with ugly people on principle (it just seems wrong,
like eating leftovers from Thanksgiving on Christmas). And two, because
I resent pretty people; they're able to get sex, attention and love for free,
which isn't fair.
So I eventually resigned myself to sitting in my room listening to the
Boiling Suite and reading astrology magazines when finally one of my for
mer stalkees, John, called up and asked if I was free for coffee. There
was nothing weird about our date except for the fact that he kept staring
at my ears and gritting his teeth. Afterward we went to my place, where
we smoked crack on the balcony. Eventually I got tired of his company
and pushed him off and he fell to the ground. Which was good 'cause on
the landing he crushed a huge bug that I just knew was going to fly into
my room and bite me all night, which, as a matter of fact, I find to be one
exchange of fluids too much.
