Enema-at-Home: These days, medical treatments are getting more and more expen
sive, consequently becoming less accessible to the common man. Don t let your pock-

etbook stop you from enjoying the pleasures of everyday medical operations. Now, you
never have to leave your house if you need an enema, just attach your household vacuum pump and suck away. Sure,

Barbie Beheader: Do you have a young child at home? Does your child enjoy playing with Barbie dolls and rip
ping their heads off in the process? If so, then you can save your child the struggle of wrenching the head on by
simply using your wonderful household vacuum pump to reduce the once five minute battle to tive seconds of indus-

trial strength suction.
Satanic Ritual Tool: The people are Acme are also interested in serv
ing minority racial, ethnic and religious groups. This new non-dis
crimination policy led to the idea of the Satanic Ritual Tool, which is
now widely used in Satanic churches all across the country. Now, you
closet Satanists at home can enjoy the same quality of ritual behavior
as most major Satanic organizations. You no longer have to feel s vft
out.
Viscera Remover: For those of you who do not follow the Unholy
Church of Satan, but would like to use the Satanic Ritual Tool for
other, non-Satanic purposes, we offer the same concept to the layman
as our Viscera Remover. Great for at home embalming, persecution of
Scottish knights and taking care of that nosey lady across the street.
