# Bonfire controversy rages forward
## 
### Brad Heinz Contributing writer 
As the Axe Committee prepares its Big Game Bon
fire. controversy still smolders over the University's
decision in September to cancel the annual event in
Lake Lagunita, the bonfire's traditional home.
Phis year's bonfire will be a scaled down M-cubic
foot version in Arrillaga Amphitheater on Nov. 20.
The University agreed with the County of Santa
Clara in May I^%— as a condition of receiving build
ing permits to develop the Lyman Graduate Resi
dences — to cancel the bonfire if necessary to protect
the tiger salamanders living in the lake, according to
documents obtained by I he Daily.
The I Jniversity did not seek student input as part of
the Lyman permitting process, according to Catherine
Palter, environmental planner at the University Plan
ning ()ffice.
I he ASSU and the Axe Committee, the organiza
tion that plans most Big Game activities, announced
on Wednesday the formation of an ad hoc student task
force to study the process that resulted in the cancella
tion of the Lagunita bonfire.
"Students right now aren't happy with the way the
bonfire has been dealt with," said ASSU Vice Presi
dent Ben Decker, a coterminal student. "The task
force is a way to channel those feelings toward a con
structive end."
The task force has been charged with reviewing and
explaining the process that resulted in the I Iniversity's
decision and making recommendations about the fu
ture of the rally and bonfire, according to Decker.
Axe Comm voluntarily discontinued the bonfire in
Lagunita in IW4 after scientists discovered the
lakebed served as a habitat for the tiger salamander
named "a state species of special concern" by the I J.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service. Since that time, the commit
tee has sponsored a rally or scaled-down bonfire in
other campus locations.
The Conservation Agreement agreed on by the
University and Santa Clara County, which is still in
draft form, requires Stanford to undertake a variety of

activities to mitigate environmental
impact on the salamander habitat in
the area of the lake and the nearby
Foothills.
The agreement also calls for a
"biological study" of the bonfire's
impact on the salamander and re
stricts the University from re-estab
lishing the bonfire for the l(K)th an
niversary of the Big Game unless the
study indicates "minimal impacts"
on the species.
"The impacts of this bonfire
would then be assessed to determine
if the bonfire could return to this lo
cation as an annual event with mini
mal impacts to the species," the
agreement reads.
Stanford's Center for Conserva
tion Biology completed the required
study on Aug. 1. 1997, and issued a
report concluding that the Lagunita
bonfire would probably "impact" a
minimum of 13 percent of the sala
manders in the lakebed. "Impact"
refers to the effects of construction,
vehicular and crowd trampling, heat
and toxic residue.
The report's authors, Wendy Fox
and Alan Launer, concluded. "At
the present time there is no way to
precisely ascertain the impact of the
bonfire on the California tiger sala
mander population breeding at La
gunita. However, given the sheer
number of threats faced by the Cali
fornia tiger salamander population

at Stanford, all threats need to he
taken seriously."
The report also included an ex
tensive list of ways to minimize im
pact on the salamander population,
including reducing the size of the
bonfire and keeping crowds away
from sensitive areas.
The University requested the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and
the California Department of Fish
and Game to assess the impact of the
bonfire on the basis of the report.
Both agencies disapproved of the
bonfire.
In a letter dated Sept. 10, 1997,
and addressed to Palter. Fish and
Game Assoc. Fishing Biologist Pa
tricia Anderson advised the Univer
sity to assess the bonfire "along with
the other adverse impacts occurring
on Stanford University property,"
referring to the Lyman residences
and other development projects.
It was shortly after learning of
these agencies' decisions that the
University issued a press release say
ing that Vice Provost for Student
Affairs James Montoya and Vice
Provost for Institutional Planning
Geoffrey Cox, in concurrence with
University President Gerhard
Casper, determined the lakebed was
no longer suitable for any type of
bonfire.
Decker and ASSIJ President
Emily Andrus, a senior, ran for office
on a platform of bringing the bonfire
back to Lagunita. When asked for a
response to the agreement restrict
ing the Lagunita bonfire, Andrus

said, "It's the first I've heard of this
previous commitment."
Decker said. "1 never heard any
body admit that. A lot of activities are
damaging [to the salamander], and
they choose the bonfire to eliminate."
Decker objected especially to the
lack of student input before the I Jni
versitv signed to the agreement.
"I think a lot of people are con
cerned about the way this university
makes decisions," he said. "People
feel sometimes that this university
loses sight for whom it was built
when decisions are made about
things that students care a great deal
about."
Both Montoya and Cox were out
of town and unavailable for com
ment. University Communications
Director Terry Shepard also could
not be reached for comment.
Housing and Dining Services Di-

rector Keith (iuv
said. "The process
wouldn't normally
include the partic
ipation of students. I
don't find it unusual
in this case that stu
dents weren't in
cluded."
Dean of Students
Marc Wais said he
was not familiar with
the permitting
process at Lyman or
the conservation
agreement because
he was not at the
University during

the time those matters were consid
ered. However, Wais said he be
lieves that the University's decision
is clear about ending the bonfires in
Lagunita.
Wais said he thinks clarifying
how the decision was made is "fine
and fair. 1 expect officials of the Uni
versity will speak forthrightlv on
what took place."
Wais suggested, however, that
some graduate students might not
agree that it was a wrong decision if
the University had sacrificed the bon
fire for graduate student housing.
The ASSU task force will focus
on many issues surrounding the bon
fire. Decker said.
"I think that the task force fits
into a broader context of when stu
dent input is relevant to decisions by
administrators," he said. "The ad
ministrators I've worked with are

concerned about student input; I
think it's an issue of the students and
the University working together to
make that happen."
Axe Comm Chair Matt Bram-

lage, a junior, char
acterized students as
"very angry and
frustrated" about
cancellation of the
bonfire in Lake La
gunita.
Although the
University's deci
sion will force Axe
Comm to scale down
the size of the Kin
fire this year, the
committee promises
that the event will
encourage school
spirit anyway. The
committee has

added skits, fireworks and a new
multimedia presentation.
Andrus encouraged students in
terested in serving on the task force
to e-mail rally@assu.stanford.edu.

explaining the process that resulted in the I Iniversity's
decision and making recommendations about the fu
ture of the rally and bonfire, according to Decker.
Axe Comm voluntarily discontinued the bonfire in
Lagunita in IW4 after scientists discovered the
lakebed served as a habitat for the tiger salamander
named "a state species of special concern" by the I J.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service. Since that time, the commit
tee has sponsored a rally or scaled-down bonfire in
other campus locations.
The Conservation Agreement agreed on by the
University and Santa Clara County, which is still in
draft form, requires Stanford to undertake a variety of

activities to mitigate environmental
impact on the salamander habitat in
the area of the lake and the nearby
Foothills.
The agreement also calls for a
"biological study" of the bonfire's
impact on the salamander and re
stricts the University from re-estab
lishing the bonfire for the l(K)th an
niversary of the Big Game unless the
study indicates "minimal impacts"
on the species.
"The impacts of this bonfire
would then be assessed to determine
if the bonfire could return to this lo
cation as an annual event with mini
mal impacts to the species," the
agreement reads.
Stanford's Center for Conserva
tion Biology completed the required
study on Aug. 1. 1997, and issued a
report concluding that the Lagunita
bonfire would probably "impact" a
minimum of 13 percent of the sala
manders in the lakebed. "Impact"
refers to the effects of construction,
vehicular and crowd trampling, heat
and toxic residue.
The report's authors, Wendy Fox
and Alan Launer, concluded. "At
the present time there is no way to
precisely ascertain the impact of the
bonfire on the California tiger sala
mander population breeding at La
gunita. However, given the sheer
number of threats faced by the Cali
fornia tiger salamander population

at Stanford, all threats need to he
taken seriously."
The report also included an ex
tensive list of ways to minimize im
pact on the salamander population,
including reducing the size of the
bonfire and keeping crowds away
from sensitive areas.
The University requested the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and
the California Department of Fish
and Game to assess the impact of the
bonfire on the basis of the report.
Both agencies disapproved of the
bonfire.
In a letter dated Sept. 10, 1997,
and addressed to Palter. Fish and
Game Assoc. Fishing Biologist Pa
tricia Anderson advised the Univer
sity to assess the bonfire "along with
the other adverse impacts occurring
on Stanford University property,"
referring to the Lyman residences
and other development projects.
It was shortly after learning of
these agencies' decisions that the
University issued a press release say
ing that Vice Provost for Student
Affairs James Montoya and Vice
Provost for Institutional Planning
Geoffrey Cox, in concurrence with
University President Gerhard
Casper, determined the lakebed was
no longer suitable for any type of
bonfire.
Decker and ASSIJ President
Emily Andrus, a senior, ran for office
on a platform of bringing the bonfire
back to Lagunita. When asked for a
response to the agreement restrict
ing the Lagunita bonfire, Andrus

said, "It's the first I've heard of this
previous commitment."
Decker said. "1 never heard any
body admit that. A lot of activities are
damaging [to the salamander], and
they choose the bonfire to eliminate."
Decker objected especially to the
lack of student input before the I Jni
versitv signed to the agreement.
"I think a lot of people are con
cerned about the way this university
makes decisions," he said. "People
feel sometimes that this university
loses sight for whom it was built
when decisions are made about
things that students care a great deal
about."
Both Montoya and Cox were out
of town and unavailable for com
ment. University Communications
Director Terry Shepard also could
not be reached for comment.
Housing and Dining Services Di-

rector Keith (iuv
said. "The process
wouldn't normally
include the partic
ipation of students. I
don't find it unusual
in this case that stu
dents weren't in
cluded."
Dean of Students
Marc Wais said he
was not familiar with
the permitting
process at Lyman or
the conservation
agreement because
he was not at the
University during

the time those matters were consid
ered. However, Wais said he be
lieves that the University's decision
is clear about ending the bonfires in
Lagunita.
Wais said he thinks clarifying
how the decision was made is "fine
and fair. 1 expect officials of the Uni
versity will speak forthrightlv on
what took place."
Wais suggested, however, that
some graduate students might not
agree that it was a wrong decision if
the University had sacrificed the bon
fire for graduate student housing.
The ASSU task force will focus
on many issues surrounding the bon
fire. Decker said.
"I think that the task force fits
into a broader context of when stu
dent input is relevant to decisions by
administrators," he said. "The ad
ministrators I've worked with are

concerned about student input; I
think it's an issue of the students and
the University working together to
make that happen."
Axe Comm Chair Matt Bram-

lage, a junior, char
acterized students as
"very angry and
frustrated" about
cancellation of the
bonfire in Lake La
gunita.
Although the
University's deci
sion will force Axe
Comm to scale down
the size of the Kin
fire this year, the
committee promises
that the event will
encourage school
spirit anyway. The
committee has

added skits, fireworks and a new
multimedia presentation.
Andrus encouraged students in
terested in serving on the task force
to e-mail rally@assu.stanford.edu.
