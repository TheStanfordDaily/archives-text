As the Axe Committee prepares its Big Game Bon
fire. controversy still smolders over the University's
decision in September to cancel the annual event in
Lake Lagunita, the bonfire's traditional home.
Phis year's bonfire will be a scaled down M-cubic
foot version in Arrillaga Amphitheater on Nov. 20.
The University agreed with the County of Santa
Clara in May I^%— as a condition of receiving build

on Wednesday the formation of an ad hoc student task
force to study the process that resulted in the cancella

"Students right now aren't happy with the way the
bonfire has been dealt with," said ASSU Vice Presi

force is a way to channel those feelings toward a con
structive end."
The task force has been charged with reviewing and
explaining the process that resulted in the I Iniversity's
decision and making recommendations about the fu
ture of the rally and bonfire, according to Decker.
Axe Comm voluntarily discontinued the bonfire in
Lagunita in IW4 after scientists discovered the
lakebed served as a habitat for the tiger salamander
named "a state species of special concern" by the I J.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service. Since that time, the commit
tee has sponsored a rally or scaled-down bonfire in
other campus locations.

University and Santa Clara County, which is still in
draft form, requires Stanford to undertake a variety of
