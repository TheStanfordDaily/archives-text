three solid games in three days, he
ginning with today's Northern Pacif

against California.

Santa Barbara tomorrow and Pacif
ic on Sunday.

FIELD HOCKEY
■ TODAY: No. 19 Stanford (12-6.
3-1) at California, 3 p.m.
■ SATURDAY: Stanford vs. IJC-
Santa Barbara at the Field Hockey
Field. I p.m.
■ SUNDAY: Stanford vs. Pacific at
California

Hut lirst things first. Beating Cal
ifornia is the top priority because a
win will give No. 19 Stanford the
NorPac championship. Stanford's 2-
1 loss to Cal last Saturday forced
today's playoff tie-breaker.
"We're not thinking about the
other two (games) right now," said
junior forward Monique Leroux.
"Cal is by far most important."
Stanford isn't used to playing
three consecutive games, but it is
used to playing on California's artifi
cial turf, having played six matches
there this season. And two of this

weekend's games — against Cal and
Pacific (a Western Collegiate Tour
nament match) — will be played on
this well-known ground.
In between, the Cardinal plays its
last home match, against UC-Santa
Barbara.
"The weekend would be tiring,
but we've been doing a lot of run
ning in practice this week," said ju
nior midfielder Jordyn Kramer. "So
I know we'll be more than ready."
The Cardinal has virtually no
chance for an NCAA tournament
berth, so it wants to close the season
with a bang this weekend, going out
with intensity in all three games.
" The last time we played Cal, we
had moments of brilliance followed
by low moments," Kramer said.
"And we definitely can't afford the
lows this time."
Head coach Sheryl Johnson sec
onded Kramer's motion. "Last Sat
urday's match vs. Cal was an unusu
al lull for us. We're a better team
than that."
Playing at home, the Bears are
likely to come out even more psy
ched today. And Cal is known for
having a large fan following.
But the Cardinal won't let the
Bears or the Bears' fans stop its mo
mentum.
"We have nothing to save any
thing for." Kramer said. "We're
going there to claim what we came
for and to show them why we got
ranked."
