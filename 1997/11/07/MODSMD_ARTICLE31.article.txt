WATER POLO
■ TOMORROW: No. 3 Stanford
(13-5,4-2) at No. 2 USC (14-4,3-2)
■ SI JNDAY: Stanford at No. 9 IJC-
Santa Barbara (10-7, 2-4)

Tomorrow's match against the
Trojans (14-4, 3-2 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) will largely de
termine the Cardinal's (13-5, 4-2
MI'SF) seeding in the MPSF tourna
ment in I ong Beach Nov. 28-30.
"We have the toughest schedule
of anyone right now," said Stanford
head coach Dante Dettamanti. "In
order to be seeded third, we need to
beat I 'SC."
"We're peaking right now. I think
the guys are ready to go."
I he Cardinal last faced the Tro
jans in the championship match of
the Northern California Tourna

ment Oct. 19 at deCiuerre Pool. De
spite a strong fourth-quarter coun
terattack by the Cardinal. USC held
on for a 6-5 victory.
Led by seniors Simun Cimerman
and Mateo Juric and junior Marko
Pintaric — three powerful drivers
from Croatia — the Trojans are
coming off a pair of victories over
UC-San Diego and UC-Santa Bar
bara.
According to Stanford junior de
fenseman Layne Beaubien. shutting
down the Croatian trio is the key to
a Cardinal victory.
"If we play our game right, we
should be able to beat them."
Beaubien said. "We pretty much
hold our destiny in our hands."
Sunday's match against the Clau
chos (10 7. 2 4 MPSF) shouldn't be
as hotly contested.
"They've got a lot of young
guvs," Dettamanti said. "They're
kind of up and down this year."
Stanford already sunk the Ciau
chosina 13-9 victory at the Southern
California I ournament Sept. 21.
According to Dettamanti. the
Cardinal will run its unique rotating
holeman offense against the (Jau
chos when they face off again Sun
day.
"It's a completely different of-

fense than any other team runs in the
nation." Beauhien said.
The attack proved effective
against No. I Pepperdine last week
end.
Sophomore holeman Michael
l.ipinski came off the bench in the
second quarter and utilized the strat
egy to draw a penalty shot, a Pepper
dine kickout and a goal.

An effective offense could prove
the ultimate key to a favorable seed
ing in the MPSF tournament if it
produces a pair of wins this week
end.
"The thing that's important tome
is that we're battling for a spot." Det
tamanti said. "We're in the thick of
it. That's what being in sports is all
about."
