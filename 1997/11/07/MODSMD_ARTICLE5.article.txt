## Student-led dance troupes bring culture and rhythm off-campus

With initiative and a love for movement, a lew
Stanford students are using their bodies and their
minds to bring new meaning to the word "dance."
Freshman Nathan Osborne, junior Sara bar
ley and seniors Issac Roth, Rebecca Brams and
James Jhun all are working to expand the dance
options on campus.
Osborne is a founder ol one of several inde
pendent groups that formulate original concepts
of dance. Instead of going to college right after
high school. ()sborne decided to take a year off to
"serve the world community." which is a tenet ol
the Baha'i faith.
Osborne did that by joining a globe-trotting
Baha'i dance troupe called "The I diversity I )ance
Workshop" for a year.
"Our shows would have many different types
of dances," Osborne said. " There was a dance
about racism, equality between men and women,
poverty, drugs, and at the end we would have a
multicultural dance. But we'd always start out
with a step dance."

Once at Stanford, Osborne fell that a
Stanford step-dancing group would be
fun. Tveryone can do it. that's the
thing," he said. "One ol the first days I
was in the dorm. I was doing a step dance.
People were like. What s that? l each me
it. so I would teach it to them."
Osborne's group isn't the only on
campus that does step. African Amen
can sororities and fraternities often use
step da ii< ing as a wav to show the outside
community their dedication to their
African roots.
"Stepping is like the African Ameri
can's version of African tribal dances,
said junior /akiyyah l.angford. a mem
ber< >1 Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. " I he
stomping, clapping and slapping are used
to imitate African drum beats and other
African musical instruments. Stepping
also represents unity between the mem
hers which isoneol the essential purpos
es of all black fraternities and sororities.
