# Steps closer to strengthening community
## Student-led dance troupes bring culture and rhythm off-campus 
### Nkomo Morris Contributing writer 
With initiative and a love for movement, a lew
Stanford students are using their bodies and their
minds to bring new meaning to the word "dance."
Freshman Nathan Osborne, junior Sara bar
ley and seniors Issac Roth, Rebecca Brams and
James Jhun all are working to expand the dance
options on campus.
Osborne is a founder ol one of several inde
pendent groups that formulate original concepts
of dance. Instead of going to college right after
high school. ()sborne decided to take a year off to
"serve the world community." which is a tenet ol
the Baha'i faith.
Osborne did that by joining a globe-trotting
Baha'i dance troupe called "The I diversity I )ance
Workshop" for a year.
"Our shows would have many different types
of dances," Osborne said. " There was a dance
about racism, equality between men and women,
poverty, drugs, and at the end we would have a
multicultural dance. But we'd always start out
with a step dance."

Once at Stanford, Osborne fell that a
Stanford step-dancing group would be
fun. Tveryone can do it. that's the
thing," he said. "One ol the first days I
was in the dorm. I was doing a step dance.
People were like. What s that? l each me
it. so I would teach it to them."
Osborne's group isn't the only on
campus that does step. African Amen
can sororities and fraternities often use
step da ii< ing as a wav to show the outside
community their dedication to their
African roots.
"Stepping is like the African Ameri
can's version of African tribal dances,
said junior /akiyyah l.angford. a mem
ber< >1 Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. " I he
stomping, clapping and slapping are used
to imitate African drum beats and other
African musical instruments. Stepping
also represents unity between the mem
hers which isoneol the essential purpos
es of all black fraternities and sororities.

Step Out is a new student group that teaches dance
to children in under-priveledged elementary
schools.
The dance form has been "limited
to certain communities, and now, it's
possible for everyone to do it," Os
borne said. His step group meets
weekly. Alpha Kappa Alpha usually
has a couple of step performances
each quarter.
Step-Out is another new Stanford
dance group, formed with a goal to
bring dance to off-campus communi
ty. However, Step-Out is not a step

dance group; its name stems from the
group's philosophy.
Members go into under-privi
leged elementary schools in East Palo
Alto to teach dance as a self-esteem
building tool weekly.
"We're stepping off of the Stan
ford campus into the larger commu
nity," said Farley, the group's
founder.
Step Out's efforts culminate in
"Celebration," which is a White
Plaza dance show presented in the
spring by the East Palo Alto school
children involved with the program.
Roth and Brams are also planning

a dance show in the spring and are
looking for people from all different
fields to help.
"We wanted to do something that
was multidisciplinary — that brought
together different artistic communi
ties on campus and possibly academ
ic communities," Brams said. Their
project will center around the topic of
violence.
"We want dancers, singers, actors,
physicians, engineers and social sci
entists," Brams said. "So we're look
ing for people who not only want to
be in the project team hut also people
who might have something to add to

the project.
"If there's a poet, and they write
something that really inspires me,
then 1 goout and I come back the next
week with a piece of movement to
that poetry — which hopefully sets
off the poet thinking again or another
person in the group." Brams added.
"It's awesome to work with
dancers," said Roth, whose back
ground is in lighting design. "People
in the industry will tell you that
dancers are the most neurotic people
to work with but also the most fun
and challenging."
Jhun would probably agree. His

new dance session, called "Contact
Jam," allows both beginning and ad
vanced dancers to relate to the
dancers around them in an uncon
ventional way.
"The whole point of it is to have
this dance with somebody where you
communicate through touch," Jhun
said. "It's the cooperation of momen
tum, weight and energy between two
or more people."
Tony Kramer, a senior lecturer in
the Dance Department, teaches a
class in contact improvisation that
Jhun called "a wonderful first class of
any dance form to take because it al

lows you to really explore move
ment."
"But it becomes a frustration to
come back [the next quarter] and
then start over," he added. "So 1
wanted to offer something that is
steady and has no rules, where you
just dance. Basically, I am just offer
ing a space for people to come and
dance with each other. It's for every
body."
Jhun's group meets every Mon
day from 7 to 10 p.m. in the Roble
Dance Studio. "Contact Jam" is free
for Stanford students and $2 for oth
ers.
