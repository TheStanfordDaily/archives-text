ITic police department has been
having trouble recently with a for
mer graduate student whose bizarre
behavior is no stranger to the com
munity, said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. Chukwuma Ken
neth Uzo, Class of '92, first came to
the attention of police in 1988 for
driving without a valid driver's li
cense.
" There were chronic reports in
past years with him having strange

and intimidating behavior as a stu
dent, but he was never physically vi
olent," said Niemeyer.
None of these allegations were
ever proven, and he was not arrest
ed for any of his behavior.
Last month, Uzo returned to
campus and was spotted near some
of the University libraries, acting
strangely, Niemeyer said. Because
of his previous reputation, he
caused some concern among library
employees.
Uzo was then asked by police to

stay off campus, and the librarians
were informed to notify the police if
Uzo was seen again. Uzo was arrest
ed Oct. 30 on outstanding warrants
while visiting the Engineering Li
brary.
Uzo was released soon after,
only to be arrested again. On Tues
day, a math professor smelled
smoke coming from a closet inside
his classroom in the basement of the
Math Building, Niemeyer said.
When the professor opened the
door, he found Uzo lying on the

floor smoking a pipe. The professor
closed the door, opened it again and
then Uzo allegedly asked, "May 1
help you?"
TTie professor notified the police
who found Uzo outside the building.
They took him into custody for tres
passing and interrupting business.
Uzo refused to sign a trespassing
agreement in which the University
would agree not to prosecute pro
vided Uzo stays off campus, accord
ing to Niemeyer.
