# Final Gaieties show oversold
## 
### Dave Halsted 
Because of unexpectedly high demand, many dormi
tories and groups that had purchased block seating for
this year's final Big Game Gaieties show are being told
they must attend an earlier night.
Jennie Caleshu, a senior and the producer of Gaieties,
said almost 6(X) tickets too many were sold for the popu
lar Friday, Nov. 21, show. That show, which follows the
Wednesday and Thursday performances, is the tradition
al final rallying event for students before Saturday's Big
Game football match against UC-Berkeley.
Because this year is the 100 th Big Game, demand for
advance block reservations among student groups and
dormitories for the Friday show is unusually high,
Caleshu said.
The ticketing process could not accommodate this.
Because Stanford is such a residentially based campus,
the bulk of student tickets are sold in group-seating
blocks that dorms and other student groups reserve.
Resident assistants and other group leaders submit a
block payment and reserve seats; the actual tickets can be
picked up today in White Plaza. Ram's Head Theatrical
Society, the student group which produces the show, sets
no limit on the number of groups that reserve seats.
Once the deadline for reservations had passed. Ram's
Head realized that 2,285 seats had been reserved and paid
for while the capacity of Memorial Auditorium, where
the show is held, is only 1,7(X). The Gaieties leadership de
cided to bump the extra students down to the Wednesday
and Thursday shows, which still are not sold out, based on
in-group participation.
Dormitories that had less than the overall average of
62 percent of their members reserving attendance were
told by e-mail that they had to choose one of the earlier
nights. Given that this year five houses had 100-percent
participation, Caleshu said — an unprecedented number
— it seemed fairest to deny those with the least.
"It kind of pissed us off a lot" was Loro RA Lewis
Fanger's account of his dormitory's reaction to the news
that it had not made the cut-off. Because Loro is a Struc
tured Liberal Education dormitory, the residents have
night class Wednesdays and Thursdays; Fanger said that
his residents have decided to skip class to see Gaieties on
