# Final Gaieties show oversold
## 
### Dave Halsted 
Because of unexpectedly high demand, many dormi
tories and groups that had purchased block seating for
this year's final Big Game Gaieties show are being told
they must attend an earlier night.
Jennie Caleshu, a senior and the producer of Gaieties,
said almost 6(X) tickets too many were sold for the popu
lar Friday, Nov. 21, show. That show, which follows the
Wednesday and Thursday performances, is the tradition
al final rallying event for students before Saturday's Big
Game football match against UC-Berkeley.
Because this year is the 100 th Big Game, demand for
advance block reservations among student groups and
dormitories for the Friday show is unusually high,
Caleshu said.
The ticketing process could not accommodate this.
Because Stanford is such a residentially based campus,
the bulk of student tickets are sold in group-seating
blocks that dorms and other student groups reserve.
Resident assistants and other group leaders submit a
block payment and reserve seats; the actual tickets can be
picked up today in White Plaza. Ram's Head Theatrical
Society, the student group which produces the show, sets
no limit on the number of groups that reserve seats.
Once the deadline for reservations had passed. Ram's
Head realized that 2,285 seats had been reserved and paid
for while the capacity of Memorial Auditorium, where
the show is held, is only 1,7(X). The Gaieties leadership de
cided to bump the extra students down to the Wednesday
and Thursday shows, which still are not sold out, based on
in-group participation.
Dormitories that had less than the overall average of
62 percent of their members reserving attendance were
told by e-mail that they had to choose one of the earlier
nights. Given that this year five houses had 100-percent
participation, Caleshu said — an unprecedented number
— it seemed fairest to deny those with the least.
"It kind of pissed us off a lot" was Loro RA Lewis
Fanger's account of his dormitory's reaction to the news
that it had not made the cut-off. Because Loro is a Struc
tured Liberal Education dormitory, the residents have
night class Wednesdays and Thursdays; Fanger said that
his residents have decided to skip class to see Gaieties on
one of the two new dates.
Eddie Chang, a freshman and
resident of Roble, another dormito
ry turned away from the Friday
show, was similarly disappointed. "I
wanted to go on Friday," he said.
" That would have been best."
Caleshu stressed that while the
solution did make many people un
happy, it increased ticket sales for
the less popular nights. On top of the
block seating reassignments, many
dorm residents who had previously
opted not to see the show are using
this as an opportunity to attend with
their groups after all.
"The entire Stanford campus can
come," she said, because the earlier
nights are not sold out; sales for
those two nights open in White Plaza
today, and she anticipated that peo
ple could still buy tickets at the door.
Despite the change, Fanger

said he and his dormitory are
still excited to see the play and
rally for Big Game.
"We can't complain too much,"
he said, "because we had crap seats
for Friday anyway."
Caleshu said nothing like this has
happened in recent history and
Ram's Head has no plans to change
its policy to prevent overbooking
from happening again. In fact, she
said, she will write an addition to the
ticketing policy to "do what we've
done this year if Friday ever sells out
again."
In years past, advance group tick
eting was carried out through a lot
tery system. Because the lottery
would be held at a particular time in
White Plaza, those who simply could
not get to it lost out.
Caleshu said this new system is
more equitable because it allows
ample time for any group to make a
bid for Friday's show, the success of
which is based on their own partic
ipation percentage.
