Clinton wants China-like Cuba
WASH INCHON (AP) — President C linton said yesterday he
wants to develop "an ongoing relationship" with Fidel Castro's ('uba
much like the one he has with China, but only alter America's com
munist neighbor moves toward democracy.
In an interview on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," Clinton said he
had been working toward "a gradually evolving relationship" with
Havana until Cuban fighters shot down two small planes piloted by
Cuban-Americans in February IW>. Until then, Clinton had resisted
tougher anti-Cuba legislation in Congress, but he signed the so-called
Helms-Burton Act after the attack.
Clinton stopped short of saying he wants diplomatic relations with
Cuba, as his reference to China tics would imply, and White House
officials said it was not his intent to indicate he wants such tics.
The Cuban president himself nixed prospects for change in the
near future. "In Cuba there was, there is and there will be a revolu
tion based on principles that are not for sale," Castro told 21 heads ol
state Saturday at the annual Ibero-American summit in Porlamar,
Venezuela.
Baby found in restroom
ORLANDO. Fla. (AP) — A woman found a live newborn girl in
the toilet of a W;ill Disney World rest room with the baby's head
sticking out of the water and the umbilical cord wrapped around her
neck.
The 7-pound baby was hospitalized in good condition yesterday,
one day after being discovered Saturday night in the Magic Kingdom.
No one came forward to claim the infant.
"We put the baby in a warmer for about two hours to bring her
temperature and her pulse rate up," said Martha Johnson, a
spokeswoman for Arnold Palmer Hospital for ( hildren and Women.
"All her vital signs are good now."
Johnson said the baby was found apparently minutes after being
born. A doctor in the park administered cardiopulmonary resuscita
tion to the child until emergency workers arrived.
(■row your own bypass
ORLANDO. Fla. (AP) - Scientists tinkering with gene therapy
think they have found a way to make bad hearts grow their own
bypasses.
The idea is to inject extra genes directly into the heart that will trig
ger it to sprout new blood vessels within two to three weeks. If all
goes well, these will work at least as well as the ones surgeons stitch
into place during coronary bypass surgery.
So far. doctors from Boston have tried the gene therapy on people
with dangerously clogged arteries in the legs, where it seems to have
spared some from threatened amputations.
For several years, scientists have talked about manipulating genes
to cure a variety ol human ills. But until now. there has been little firm
evidence that it will do any good.
Reports by Isner and another team working on a different gene
therapy approach were presented yesterday at a meeting ol the
American Heart Association.
