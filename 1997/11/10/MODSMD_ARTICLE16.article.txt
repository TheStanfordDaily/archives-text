ASSU frosh senator
program improves
old associate system

WHEN YOU NEED energy and
excitement, there is no substitute
for freshmen.
This maxim is well known; it explains
why some upperclassmen are anxious to
live in four-class houses, to become all
frosh RAs and to recruit freshmen for ser
vice groups and social organizations.
The ASSU Senate, too, has long since
jumped on the bandwagon by offering
incoming students positions as "senate
associates," the legislature's ex officio offi
cers. It should be congratulated for recently
improving this program.
Historically, the senate associates pro
gram has been somewhat disorganized and
chaotic. Freshmen were thrown into the
politics of the senate — not a pretty sight, to
be sure — where they were often used as
free labor.
At best, they could be described as
active interns, which is still a far cry from
the dignifying "ex officio officers." An ex
officio officer is a member of the senate by
virtue of his position as a senate associate.
It's hardly surprising, then, that a number of
the senate associates were soon fed up with
the senate and disappointed in student pol
itics altogether. While some did go on to
become ASSI I leaders, it is probably fair to
say that the success rate of the program left
much to be desired.
That questionable legacy should change
after this year.
Sophomore Matt Spence, the senate's
deputy chair, has taken an active role in
improving the structure of the freshmen
program — now called freshman senators

thus making it a potentially more enrich
ing experience for participants. Although,
like senate associates, freshman senators
cannot vote.
During the first quarter, the freshman
senators are focusing on specific projects,
such as the ASSU newsletter, the course
guide, the political board and other recent
priorities in student leadership. The selec
tion process sought freshmen with specific
skills necessary for these projects, instead of
those with general student government
experience.
People should also realize that the com
petition to become a freshman senator was
far from trivial: only l() were chosen from a
pool of 140. According to Spence, howev
er, most of the interested freshmen still
found a way to get involved in the ASSU,
often in positions as interns or presidential
aides.
Another important provision holds the
fresh.nan senators accountable for com
pleting their projects. If they don't com
plete these by a set deadline, they may be
replaced.
Meanwhile, Spence is focusing on build
ing group cohesion among the freshman
senators before integrating them fully with
their elected colleagues.
This new approach is a marked improve
ment on the traditions of the past: it gives
freshmen a project for which they are
specifically qualified, helps them ease into
the senate's work and provides mechanisms
of oversight and accountability.
Of course, the program will only succeed
as long as Spence continues to watch its
progress closely.
Having shown much needed leadership
in getting new students involved in the
ASSU, he is certainly on the right track.
Even more importantly, freshman sena
tors will likely gain more from the program
than their predecessors. Their remarkable
energy will be used better, too.
