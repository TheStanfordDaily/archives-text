## Taking the time to just listen 
### 
LAST Saturday
night began to feel
like a disappoint
ment when what was to
be a romantic evening
disintegrated into a
lovers' quarrel.
Because my boyfriend
and I negotiate the majori-

ty of our relationship across 3(X)+ miles, I
couldn't help but feel a bit frustrated that
we were wasting our time together arguing.
But I admit, I started it.
I felt unresolved about an old issue and
couldn't resist drudging it up. But I was
unwilling to completely open up, so I
dropped the bomb and then sat silently fur
rowing in my disgruntlement.
Patiently my boyfriend urged me to tell
him what I was feeling.
I uncorked my bottled emotions, and
when I was done, he didn't become defen
sive or try to convince me of the error of my
perspective. He didn't give me unwanted
advice or offer false optimism. He didn't
pretend to understand everything I had
experienced. He simply looked at me com
passionately and said, "I hear you."
Those three words brought unbelievable
comfort and made me realize that being lis
tened to was all I had wanted in the first
place, but I hadn't had the clarity to say it.
It's such a simple thing, really: talking
and listening. But when you experience it
most genuinely, you realize how rare and
powerful it really is.
I think somewhere in the socialization
process we have been taught that it's more
important to assert our own point of view
than to listen to others. We've been taught
that all receptivity is a sign of weakness, and
proactivity is strength. It's a dysfunctional
mode of being, but one that's become nor

malized hy its prevalence. Not only does it
take its toll on our inter-personal relation
ships, but it also has larger implications.
This past week I attended a faculty dis
cussion sponsored by the Center for Com
parative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. One
of the presenters. Psychology Prof. Claude
Steele discussed his studies, which have
shown that when subjects know that their
racial group is negatively stereotyped in the
academic domain it disrupts their perfor
mance. Conversely, erasing such a threat,
(i.e. convincing test-takers that they are
about to take a "race-fair" test), improves
performance.
Steele noted that it is often difficult for
non-minorities to see such systems of disad
vantage.
During the question-answer period, a
half African-American woman gave testi
mony to this fact. She was adopted by a
white family who raised her with the policy
that "since race doesn't matter to us, it's not
an issue."
She embraced this doctrine until a point
in her early adulthood when she noticed she
was being subject to other people's racist
assumptions. She realized that race did mat
ter. She got angry.
"My father still doesn't get it," she
explained to me after the forum. "He thinks
I'm over-reacting.... If you can live with
somebody of color and still not see the dis
crimination, how can we make others see
it?"
There are no easy answers. As Steele
said in his presentation, "Race is not rocket
science, it's much harder than that."
My own education in racial awareness
came in the form of a dormmate my fresh
man year at Swarthmore College. He was
the president of the Swarthmore African-
American Student Society and was kind

enough to take me under his wing.
One evening, he complained to nu
about how frustrating it was to talk to white
people about these issues. So I asked him
why he bothered to speak to me.
"Because you're interested," he
explained, "and because you listen."
I learned then that maybe listening was
the first step in this l(XX)-mile journey
toward racial harmony.
Listening to friends and to lovers, listen
ing to faculty discuss race and ethnicity.
And most of all, listening to oneself. For
it is listening to and trusting one's own inner
wisdom that allows one to discuss sensitive
issues without hurting other people.
One of the audience members corn
mented that race is "difficult to talk about
because it's personal."
It seems outrageous to me that we spend
our lives easily talking about those things
that are not personal, that don't matter to
us, that we don't care about. In our egoistic
efforts to avoid sticking our foots in our
mouths, we waste our words.
While I agree that talking about things
close to our hearts is not always comfort
able, the alternative, silence and alienation,
is abhorrent.
So maybe Saturday evening wasn't such
a flop. It helped me to appreciate the power
of openness. I've learned that there's no use
in remaining mute about those things that
go on inside oneself.
And I've learned by observation the
grace and strength of these words: I hear
you.
