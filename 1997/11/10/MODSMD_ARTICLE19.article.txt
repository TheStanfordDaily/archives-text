Lee's column raises
questions about Mao
and communism
I commend Therese Lee's tribute to
open-mindedness and empirical observa
tion in her essay of Oct. 23. The continuing
reverence of many Chinese for Mao
Zedong is a fact worthy of note. Lee would
no doubt acknowledge, however, that Mao
remains highly controversial on the main
land. As she spends more time there, and
more among emigrant Chinese, she will find
no shortage of persons who believe that
"Mao was a very bad man," or who would
set 1949 as the endpoint of his career as a
great patriot. Unfortunately he ruled, with
remarkable harshness, for another 27 years.
If Lee has the opportunity to travel and
visit people in Germany, she will also find
that some older people speak fondly of "der

Hitler." This too is a noteworthy fact. But
interpreting such facts is tricky. In some cases
reverence for a departed dictator may simply
signify a slap in the face of the status quo —
a muffled threat, seldom carried out, to
invoke terror to achieve one's desires. This is
usually the case when ill-informed young
persons embrace such heroes as Mao and
Hitler (as in the "search for Mao" among
young people in China in the late '80s and
early '90s). The content of the hero for such
persons is mainly protest or resentment.
Those who affect reverence for Mao may not
really want to perpetuate the institution of
slave labor, just as those who wear swastikas
may not really want to bring back concentra
tion camps. They just want to register their
dissent and dissatisfaction, sometimes to the
point of hatred. (Buchi Emecheta observed
the prevalence of the name "Adolf' among
Nigerians born during World War II.)
But if we take reverence for Mao (or
Hitler) at face value, as Lee properly asks us

to do, we may conclude that a leader who
embodies an ideal of national rebirth to a
discontented, humiliated people can contin
ue to command their nostalgia, regardless of
the high cost of the promised rebirth or
even the ultimate falsity of the promise. Lee
suggests as much. A leader promising such
rebirth can inspire people to pay any price
— to surrender every scrap of personal lib
erty, to live in poverty, to labor like slaves,
to wallow in hatred of foreign and domestic
enemies and to commit hideous atrocities
against their neighbors — to achieve the
desired measure of self respect.
Mao and Hitler readily put to the sword
all infidels who would not worship them as
the incarnation of the highest good or as the
supreme political and spiritual authority.
But it is not their doctrines that inspire the
reverence of ordinary people; it is what the
leaders told people about themselves.
"You are somebody!" Hitler cried.
"You're German! That's great!"

"You are somebody!" Mao told the Chi
nese people. "You have stood up!"
No matter how much people have suf
fered as a result of their leader's folly, they
retain a warm feeling for the original
promise. (It would be a mistake, however,
to exaggerate the extent to which people
willingly paid the required price for the
promised rebirth, because these religions
became compulsory as soon as their parti
sans seized power.)
When Lee continues her travels in
China, she may encounter people who have
informed themselves about Hitler and his
"national socialism." Shirer's Rise and Fall
of The Third Reich was popular there at
one time. I venture that few persons among
those she meets will give much credence to
the Party's old distinction between proletar
ian dictatorship and fascist dictatorship.
Common traits between Communist
China and Nazi Germany are legion:
autarky: xenophobia; mass mobilization;

mass militarization; mass regimentation: a
Party elite untrammeled by law or morality;
labor camps; death camps; a monolithic
state ideology enforced by terror. The
founders of Nazi Germany and Communist
China were all apt students of the Soviets
the great and gifted pioneers of 20th-centu
rv totalitarianism. Educated persons in
China understand this perfectly well.
When people attempt to satisfy the
hunger for self-respect by embracing a
nationalistic dictatorship, the food may kill
them, but they will retain an appetite for it.
It would be best if they satisfied their hunger
in some other way. but that is difficult where
the cultural and institutional infrastructure,
not to mention political and economic disar
ray, makes them vulnerable to authoritarian
political solutions. 1 wish Lee good luck in
her academic career and hope she will con
tinue to seek truth from facts.
