# Vanessa Bartsch: Showering with the boys
## Co-ed naked showers: some good clean fun 
### 
£ £ AM. PASS ME the shampoo."
Extra volume or nor-
V*«Jmal?" he said.
"Normal. Like I need extra volume."
Sam chuckled and passed me the Costco
econo-sized l()-gallon jug. I managed to
pour out an aptly female-sized dollop and
prepared to tackle my out-of-control fro.
I rubbed my hands together and started
to lift my arms. But a nasty fall involving a
friend's horse that reared up and flipped
over onto me at practice the day before left
me in pain. I tore muscles in my left shoul
der and scraped most of the skin off my
right bicep. This was resulting in a good deal
of pain with each little movement.
I did my best to get the shampoo onto
the top of my head, but it just hurt too much
to lather. I thought about just skipping it
and hoping a long body scrub with the
loofah oatmeal soap might make up for
dirty hair. But I was going out — on a sort
of date, nonetheless.
Now back in those early Branner days I
would have been shit out of luck. Me alone
behind that curtain rubbing my head against
the wall, madly trying for a lather, softly cry
ing for Mom. What a lonely, ugly scene that
would have made!
But being that I had the good sense to hit

the co-op community, 1 reaped the benefits.
I simply turned again to Sam and asked for
assistance.
Now not only did he do a pretty darn
thorough job of working the shampoo in.
but he even took my long tendrils and made
me one of those neat sudsy mohawks.
Not too shabby. For a guy with about an
inch and a half of fuzz to deal with. 1 was
rightfully impressed. He even conditioned.
My hair had more sheen, gloss and man
ageability than I ever had achieved. Aikl
there was no frustration or grout scratches
to deal with in attempting it with mv gimpy
arms.
Sometimes you just have to ask for help.
And if I was willing to ask my teammates to
help me wiggle into my knee-high riding
boots and ask my house-manager to ban
dage my bloody arm, then I'd he damned if
I wasn't going to ask Sam to do a little Vidal
Sassoon action in the shower.
That is the beauty of the co-ed shower.
The house that liveth together, showereth
together.
Now before anyone shoots off into one
of those over-sensitive tizzies that this cam
pus has become so accustomed to. let me set
down some facts. The shower is one room,
three shower heads, no curtains.

It is not mandatory. No one forces all 2K
of us to hop in and scrub together. It is not
one giant sudsy orgy either. Nor is there any
obligation or pressure to even shower with a
single member of even the same sex.
No siree. You are guaranteed the right to
a private shower if you wish. There is a
strictly enforced "knock and holler" policy.
If you want to enter while occupied you
knock and the current cleanser has the light
to accept or deny you access.
And frankly there are times when show
er time is alone-time for me. When 1 want to
shave my legs, for instance. That takes some
skill and concentration; singing old Aero
smith tunes with the girl down the hall can
be down-right distracting.
But you know, when two of you are in a
rush and there is only one shower, it really
isn't a big deal.
As Mom says, "What's the big deal?
You're all just naked." Go Mom.
So 1 shower with guys, girls, whatever. It
is just a shower. Something we all do.
Everyday. For some obsessive types, more
than that. For some frantically occupied C S
students, markedly less.
Anyway you turn it. showering is an
everyday thing. You don't ask the guy at the
sink next to vou to leave the bathroom so

you can floss. You don't stare at your neigh
bor while he uses the urinal. And one can
pee just as well in a frat house as in Roth.
Yet people seem to balk at the showers
constantly.
People always say. "You mean you have
co-ed naked showers?" I find that particu
larly ridiculous, let's put our thinking caps
on — like you can shower any other way but
naked. And being naked doesn't have to be
sexual.
Every clear evening of the summer my
friends and I drive to this little pond by the
ocean, get buck and go for a dip. It is an
amazing way to spend a warm evening
under the stars.
So what's is the problem? I am comfort
able with my body. I laugh when the very
same people that run campus drive like a
gerbil spinning its wheel and meekly pick at
salads in the name ol fitness, drop their half
eaten power-bats when they see the show
ers.
What is the point of being healthy and
active it I am ashamed of my body? I am not
saying that I want everyone and their Pro-
Fro to see me with my clothes off. II that
was the case you would find me hanging
bare-bottomed from the bars ol the cage in
White Plaza sinuinu show tunes in a colic

giate second.
But 1 am doing nothing of the sort. I
shuffle my flip-flops right on past those
Ram's Head tables nine, 10 times a day
without ever feeling the need to swing.
However, in my own house, in the show
er, it really is pretty harmless. No one stares.
No one cares.
So why not?
At Full Moon on the Quad while one of
my playful hallmates was running about in
his birthday suit doing the co-op lull
"Moon," he came upon a frosh who took
(•no look at his nakedness, screamed
"NAKED HIPPIE!" and ran off like a
scared rabbit. Happily, the majority of the
open-minded freshman darlings just
laughed and gave him a kiss.
I don't understand where this sort of
thing comes from. Being naked doesn't hurt
anyone. It doesn't threaten personal safety.
St) let's ;ill just settle down. And get
naked if you like. Try a shower with a
friend. You might like it.

£ £ AM. PASS ME the shampoo."
Extra volume or nor-
V*«Jmal?" he said.
"Normal. Like I need extra volume."
Sam chuckled and passed me the Costco
econo-sized l()-gallon jug. I managed to
pour out an aptly female-sized dollop and
prepared to tackle my out-of-control fro.
I rubbed my hands together and started
to lift my arms. But a nasty fall involving a
friend's horse that reared up and flipped
over onto me at practice the day before left
me in pain. I tore muscles in my left shoul
der and scraped most of the skin off my
right bicep. This was resulting in a good deal
of pain with each little movement.
I did my best to get the shampoo onto
the top of my head, but it just hurt too much
to lather. I thought about just skipping it
and hoping a long body scrub with the
loofah oatmeal soap might make up for
dirty hair. But I was going out — on a sort
of date, nonetheless.
Now back in those early Branner days I
would have been shit out of luck. Me alone
behind that curtain rubbing my head against
the wall, madly trying for a lather, softly cry
ing for Mom. What a lonely, ugly scene that
would have made!
But being that I had the good sense to hit

the co-op community, 1 reaped the benefits.
I simply turned again to Sam and asked for
assistance.
Now not only did he do a pretty darn
thorough job of working the shampoo in.
but he even took my long tendrils and made
me one of those neat sudsy mohawks.
Not too shabby. For a guy with about an
inch and a half of fuzz to deal with. 1 was
rightfully impressed. He even conditioned.
My hair had more sheen, gloss and man
ageability than I ever had achieved. Aikl
there was no frustration or grout scratches
to deal with in attempting it with mv gimpy
arms.
Sometimes you just have to ask for help.
And if I was willing to ask my teammates to
help me wiggle into my knee-high riding
boots and ask my house-manager to ban
dage my bloody arm, then I'd he damned if
I wasn't going to ask Sam to do a little Vidal
Sassoon action in the shower.
That is the beauty of the co-ed shower.
The house that liveth together, showereth
together.
Now before anyone shoots off into one
of those over-sensitive tizzies that this cam
pus has become so accustomed to. let me set
down some facts. The shower is one room,
three shower heads, no curtains.

It is not mandatory. No one forces all 2K
of us to hop in and scrub together. It is not
one giant sudsy orgy either. Nor is there any
obligation or pressure to even shower with a
single member of even the same sex.
No siree. You are guaranteed the right to
a private shower if you wish. There is a
strictly enforced "knock and holler" policy.
If you want to enter while occupied you
knock and the current cleanser has the light
to accept or deny you access.
And frankly there are times when show
er time is alone-time for me. When 1 want to
shave my legs, for instance. That takes some
skill and concentration; singing old Aero
smith tunes with the girl down the hall can
be down-right distracting.
But you know, when two of you are in a
rush and there is only one shower, it really
isn't a big deal.
As Mom says, "What's the big deal?
You're all just naked." Go Mom.
So 1 shower with guys, girls, whatever. It
is just a shower. Something we all do.
Everyday. For some obsessive types, more
than that. For some frantically occupied C S
students, markedly less.
Anyway you turn it. showering is an
everyday thing. You don't ask the guy at the
sink next to vou to leave the bathroom so

you can floss. You don't stare at your neigh
bor while he uses the urinal. And one can
pee just as well in a frat house as in Roth.
Yet people seem to balk at the showers
constantly.
People always say. "You mean you have
co-ed naked showers?" I find that particu
larly ridiculous, let's put our thinking caps
on — like you can shower any other way but
naked. And being naked doesn't have to be
sexual.
Every clear evening of the summer my
friends and I drive to this little pond by the
ocean, get buck and go for a dip. It is an
amazing way to spend a warm evening
under the stars.
So what's is the problem? I am comfort
able with my body. I laugh when the very
same people that run campus drive like a
gerbil spinning its wheel and meekly pick at
salads in the name ol fitness, drop their half
eaten power-bats when they see the show
ers.
What is the point of being healthy and
active it I am ashamed of my body? I am not
saying that I want everyone and their Pro-
Fro to see me with my clothes off. II that
was the case you would find me hanging
bare-bottomed from the bars ol the cage in
White Plaza sinuinu show tunes in a colic

giate second.
But 1 am doing nothing of the sort. I
shuffle my flip-flops right on past those
Ram's Head tables nine, 10 times a day
without ever feeling the need to swing.
However, in my own house, in the show
er, it really is pretty harmless. No one stares.
No one cares.
So why not?
At Full Moon on the Quad while one of
my playful hallmates was running about in
his birthday suit doing the co-op lull
"Moon," he came upon a frosh who took
(•no look at his nakedness, screamed
"NAKED HIPPIE!" and ran off like a
scared rabbit. Happily, the majority of the
open-minded freshman darlings just
laughed and gave him a kiss.
I don't understand where this sort of
thing comes from. Being naked doesn't hurt
anyone. It doesn't threaten personal safety.
St) let's ;ill just settle down. And get
naked if you like. Try a shower with a
friend. You might like it.
