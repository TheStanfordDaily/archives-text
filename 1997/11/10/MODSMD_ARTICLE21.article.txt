Thief still at large
In the past month, a string of
thefts — all linked to one man —
has hit campus. The suspect is a
white male in his mid-30s. He is
about 5-foot-10 and is described
as being overweight at about 2(K)
pounds. He has brown hair and is
balding. Sometimes he wears
overalls and poses as a construc
tion worker, Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said.
The thief has stolen wallets out
of backpacks and purses at the
Graduate School of Business, 655
Serra, the Economics and Gilbert
Biological Sciences buildings, and
the University libraries, Niemeyer
said.
He has also has been using the
credit cards found in the wallets.
While the trend seems to have
tapered off, students should still
be careful with their belongings,
Niemeyer urged.

Suspicious salesman in
Escondido
A man posing as a magazine
salesman was wandering around
the high-rise apartment building
in Escondido Village on Oct. 16.
He knocked on a resident's door
and asked to use her restroom, ac
cording to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. The resident,
the wife of a graduate student, re
fused to let him in.
He returned to the same apart
ment later and asked the woman
to use her restroom, and again she
refused, Niemeyer said. The man
is described as a white male in his
20s of average height. Although
the suspect has not been known to
repeat the incident or harm any
one, the Stanford Police Depart
ment would like to have the com
munity alerted of any further sus
picious activity.
