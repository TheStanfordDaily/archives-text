With two easy wins over No. 12
Arizona and Arizona State this
weekend, the Cardinal (24-2, 15-0
Pac-10) clinched its third straight
conference crown and continues to
cruise toward a top seed in the
NCAA tournament.
"It's an accomplishment we're
really proud of," said head coach
Don Shaw. "It's a tough confer
ence, and winning four in a row,
that's really satisfying. We've
played well and beaten some good
teams. We've made really good
teams look had at times. It's a great
accomplishment, but we still have
three to go."
Against Arizona State (12-13, 3-
11). the ( 'ardinal ran out to an in
surmountable lead in game one but
had difficulty putting the Sun Devils
away. Stanford notched game point
quickly, 14-3. behind the hitting of
senior outside hitter Kristin Folkl.
'Folkl finished the contest with a
[match-high 1 7 kills for a .455 hitting
•percentage.
But the ('ardinal offense stalled,
•and Arizona Stale worked three
-points into a slew of sideouts. Stan
ford got its serve hack at 14-b when
[senior setter Lisa Sharpley went
[over on a quick dump.
I he ('aid then scored the game
winner on an illegal back-row at
tack hy backup Arizona State setter
( armen I usco.
Game two saw Arizona State
take ;i 3-0 lead before freshman set
tei Robyn Lewis, who replaced
Sharpley in games two and three,
served off 11 straight points.
I he run was fueled by the in
credible blocking ol Folkl, senior
middle blocker I'aula McNamee
and sophomore outside hitter Kerri

Walsh. The trio put up a dominating
wall, and Arizona State could do
nothing to stop the run. It finally
ended when McNamee was called
for going over the net at 11 -3.
Hut Stanford had trouble ending
the game again, and Arizona State
rallied to 14-10. A crosscourt kill
from Folkl brought the sixth game
point, and the Card finally finished
it on a lilt call against Sun Devil out
side hitter Lindsay Priest.
Lewis "was serving well," Shaw
said. "Arizona State was really
struggling with their backup setters.
We got ahead, and winning so easi
ly gets tough. We weren't really mo
tivated once we got ahead."
Stanford came out of intermis
sion firing on all cylinders and ran
out to a 12-0 lead. Arizona State an
swered with lour straight points, but
kills from Folkl and middle blocker
Jennifer Detmer put the game at
match point, where sophomore out
side hitter Sarah Clark ended it on a
service ace.
Yesterday against Arizona (17-
5,9-5), Stanford put on a more dom
inating display.
A team hitting percentage of
,43b (compared to Arizona's .195)
was the sign of an offense in cruise
control, as the Cardinal displayed
great all-around play.
Stanford captured game one
with ease, jumping out early and fin
ishing oil the Wildcats 15-5. Stan

ford seemed a little sluggish at the
start of game two. hut shook off the
cobwebs to claim a 15-6 win.
"We played very well," .Shaw
said. "We threw a different look at
them with our lineup. We served
very well and got some blocks early.
We opened up the offense more
than we have."
Stanford's offense was pumping,
as Folk I and Walsh finished the
match with 14 and 12 kills apiece.
But it was the Card's defense that
stilled the Wildcats.
As a team Arizona hit .089
through two games, but even more
noticeable were the numbers of
sophomore middle blocker Erin
Aldrich. The Wildcats' big gun had
just one kill and a minus-. 154 hitting
percentage at the break.
But Arizona woke up during in
termission, and game three was
more of a battle. Amid a barrage of
sideouts, Stanford crept to a 7-1
lead, but Arizona came back to 8-4.
Willi (he support of the McKale
Center crowd, the Wildcats
seemed to be gaining momentum.
But Folkl quelled those thoughts
and added insult to injury for
Aldrich when she hit an attack oil
Aldrich's face for an overpass that
Sharpley put down easily. Stanford
again crept ahead 12-6. and Clark
served out the match, notching an
ace and getting the final point on a
Walsh kill.
