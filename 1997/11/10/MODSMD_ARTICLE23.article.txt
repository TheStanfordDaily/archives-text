## Defense allows most points in Willingham era 
### Dave Flemming Contributing writer 
LOS ANGELES — Just when you thought
the season couldn't get any more disappoint
ing for the Stanford Cardinal, now this.
The USC Trojans, who entered Saturday's
game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum
as the worst offensive team in the Pacific 10
Conference, rolled up 511 yards of offense —
including 309 on the ground — and nearly
tripled its average scoring output in crushing
Stanford 45-21 in front of 58,900.

Stanford 21

The loss was the fourth straight for the reel
ing Cardinal (4-5, 2-4 Pac-10), its longest los
ing streak since 1994. Stanford falls below .500
for the first time in a year and also plummets
into a three-way tie for sixth place in the con
ference. The 45 points were the most allowed
by Stanford in head coach Tyrone Willing
ham's three seasons.
"Right now we are not executing." Willing
ham said. "We've got to eliminate some mis
takes. If you don't do that, you don't give
yourself a chance."
It has been a precipitous fall for the Cardi
nal, which one month ago had a 4-1 record, sat
in first place in the Pac-10 and was ranked No.
16 in the country. Now, thoughts of a Rose
Bowl berth are long gone. While an invitation
to a bowl is still a remote possibility, it now ap
pears Stanford will struggle to finish with a
winning record.

Early in the first quarter, the Cardinal ac
tually looked like it might snap out of its losing
streak. Less than four minutes into the game,
sophomore receiver Troy Walters received a
punt and, with the help of three outstanding
blocks, raced 66 yards through the Trojans'
coverage for a 7-0 Stanford lead.
But that was the lone highlight for the Car
dinal. as USC took over the game, scoring 31
straight points over the next 28:35.
The Trojans entered Saturday's contest av
eraging only 18 points per game, worst in the
conference. But its offense performed like it
had spent the week sitting in on Stanford's de
fensive meetings, taking advantage of all the
Cardinal's weaknesses and moving downfield
at will.
"They made plays," Willingham said, "and
we weren't able to stop them from making
plays."
Four minutes after Walters' score, USC
tied the game 7-7 to cap a drive highlighted by
a 69-yard run from speedy sophomore Chad
Morton on the Trojans' first play of the series.
It was the first carry of the season for Mor
ton. who is mainly a defensive back, and was
by far the longest carry of the year by a USC
back. The Trojans entered the game averag
ing only 118 yards on the ground. Their previ
ous longest carry had been a measly 23 yards.
Stanford got the ball back and advanced to
the USC 25 on the strength of senior Mike
Mitchell's 30-yard run. But senior Anthony
Bookman fumbled on the next play and
USC's Lawrence Larry recovered.
On the next play, Soward took a reverse
and sprinted 39 yards down the sideline. Three
plays later, junior Daylon McCutcheon, an
other defensive back playing offense, fooled

Stanford on another reverse and scored from
18 yards away for a 14-7 USC lead.
The turnover was the first of three in the
first half for the Cardinal. Stanford now has 17
turnovers in its four-game skid.
After a 13-play, 80-yard drive gave I ISC a
21-7 lead, redshirt sophomore quarterback
Chad Hutchinson threw one of his worst pass
es of the season, which was picked off hy ju
nior safety Rashard Cook.

209 receiving yards.
Hutchinson, who threw for just 75
yards. Hutchinson has led only one
scoring drive in the last three games,
and although not all of the Cardi
nal's offensive woes have been his
fault, the coaches obviously felt a
change was needed.
As a result, sophomore Todd
Husak started the second half and
played fairly well, throwing for 2f>6
yards and two touchdowns — both to
Walters — without an interception.
The change of quarterbacks
"was a surprise." Walters said. "I
didn't know until we got out on the
field and saw [Husak] warming up. I
didn't know if Hutch was injured or
not."
Hut the second half production
didn't matter, because Stanford
couldn't stop the I ISC offense. On
its first possession after halftime,
USC went straight down the field
and scored on a 18-yard pass from
freshman quarterback Mike Van
Raaphorst to junior wideout Billy
Miller.

Van Raaphorst, making only the
second start of his career — last
week he threw for just 46 yards and
had two interceptions against Wash
ington — looked like a seasoned
veteran against Stanford. Before
leaving the game with an injury, Van
Raaphorst completed 12 of 21 pass
es for 128 yards and a touchdown
and led USC to a 31-7 advantage.
Stanford still gained 453 yards of
its own, but many of those came
with the game out of reach.
The only bright spots for the Car
dinal — aside from Husak's nice
performance — were the continued
outstanding play of Walters and se
nior defensive end Kailee Wong.
Walters, who caught 11 passes
for a career-high 209 yards, remains
on pace to break the single-season
Stanford reception record. Wong
finished the game with two sacks
and three tackles for loss.
But there wasn't much more to
smile about after a punishing loss to
a team that had been struggling as
much as the Cardinal. A winning
season, once considered a formality,
now might be too tough a task for
this Stanford team.

LOS ANGELES — Just when you thought
the season couldn't get any more disappoint
ing for the Stanford Cardinal, now this.
The USC Trojans, who entered Saturday's
game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum
as the worst offensive team in the Pacific 10
Conference, rolled up 511 yards of offense —
including 309 on the ground — and nearly
tripled its average scoring output in crushing
Stanford 45-21 in front of 58,900.

■ SATURDAY'S RESULT: USC4S
Stanford 21

The loss was the fourth straight for the reel
ing Cardinal (4-5, 2-4 Pac-10), its longest los
ing streak since 1994. Stanford falls below .500
for the first time in a year and also plummets
into a three-way tie for sixth place in the con
ference. The 45 points were the most allowed
by Stanford in head coach Tyrone Willing
ham's three seasons.
"Right now we are not executing." Willing
ham said. "We've got to eliminate some mis
takes. If you don't do that, you don't give
yourself a chance."
It has been a precipitous fall for the Cardi
nal, which one month ago had a 4-1 record, sat
in first place in the Pac-10 and was ranked No.
16 in the country. Now, thoughts of a Rose
Bowl berth are long gone. While an invitation
to a bowl is still a remote possibility, it now ap
pears Stanford will struggle to finish with a
winning record.

Early in the first quarter, the Cardinal ac
tually looked like it might snap out of its losing
streak. Less than four minutes into the game,
sophomore receiver Troy Walters received a
punt and, with the help of three outstanding
blocks, raced 66 yards through the Trojans'
coverage for a 7-0 Stanford lead.
But that was the lone highlight for the Car
dinal. as USC took over the game, scoring 31
straight points over the next 28:35.
The Trojans entered Saturday's contest av
eraging only 18 points per game, worst in the
conference. But its offense performed like it
had spent the week sitting in on Stanford's de
fensive meetings, taking advantage of all the
Cardinal's weaknesses and moving downfield
at will.
"They made plays," Willingham said, "and
we weren't able to stop them from making
plays."
Four minutes after Walters' score, USC
tied the game 7-7 to cap a drive highlighted by
a 69-yard run from speedy sophomore Chad
Morton on the Trojans' first play of the series.
It was the first carry of the season for Mor
ton. who is mainly a defensive back, and was
by far the longest carry of the year by a USC
back. The Trojans entered the game averag
ing only 118 yards on the ground. Their previ
ous longest carry had been a measly 23 yards.
Stanford got the ball back and advanced to
the USC 25 on the strength of senior Mike
Mitchell's 30-yard run. But senior Anthony
Bookman fumbled on the next play and
USC's Lawrence Larry recovered.
On the next play, Soward took a reverse
and sprinted 39 yards down the sideline. Three
plays later, junior Daylon McCutcheon, an
other defensive back playing offense, fooled

Stanford on another reverse and scored from
18 yards away for a 14-7 USC lead.
The turnover was the first of three in the
first half for the Cardinal. Stanford now has 17
turnovers in its four-game skid.
After a 13-play, 80-yard drive gave I ISC a
21-7 lead, redshirt sophomore quarterback
Chad Hutchinson threw one of his worst pass
es of the season, which was picked off hy ju
nior safety Rashard Cook.
