■ FRIDAY'S RESULT: Stanford 1.

■ SATURDAY S RESULT: Stanford 3
UC-Santa Barbara 1
■ SUNDAY'S RESULT: Stanford 3.
Pacific 1

With back-to-back-to-back wins over
California, UC-Santa Barbara and Pacific.
Stanford ended the year with a 16-6 record,
its highest victory total ever.
After splitting two games with Cal earlier
in the season .the Cardinal faced the Bears in
a tie-breaker playoff Friday to determine the
conference champion. After a scoreless first
half, sophomore forward Mallory Chambers
provided the margin of victory, scoring what
would be Stanford's only goal with just over
six minutes remaining in the match.
The difference in offensive strength was
evidenced by Stanford's 25 shots on cage,
which forced Bears goalkeeper Karen
Hagan to make 15 saves. Stanford senior

Kelly Naylor had more of a relaxed after
noon in Stanford's cage, as Cal took only
four shots.
"It was better than a 1 -Ogame," said head
coach Shervl Johnson. "We had three really
close plays that could have gone in."
The Cardinal's hot streak didn't end Fri
day. Stanford returned to the Farm for its last
home game of the season Saturday and re
fused to let emotions prevent another victory.
"It was a gradual process of realizing our
season was over." said junior captain Justina
Williams. "We said goodbye to our seniors
and had a presentation of flowers for them."
Stanford defeated IJCSB3-1 in the home
finale, outshooting the Gauchos 18-1.
Williams scored two goals and junior Carey
Cloyd added a third.
The Cardinal concluded the season yes
terday with a 3-1 victory over Pacific on Cal's
field. Junior forward Monique Leroux led
Stanford with two goals, and Williams added
another in the dominant victory.
With an at-large bid to the 12-team
NCAA tournament a very slim possibility
come Wednesday's tournament selections,
Stanford is already looking toward next sea
son. Artificial turf will be installed at Old
Maloney Field in the off-season, allowing the
Cardinal to play more games at home — in
stead of using Cal's field.
"Our passing skills are excellent right
now." Williams said. "It's very advantageous
to play on turf, especially when you are a
passing team like us."
