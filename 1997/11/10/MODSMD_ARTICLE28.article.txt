# Stanford gets locked in Nelson
## Men's golf team fifth, Kribel seventh individually at home tourney 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Battling some of the best squads
in collegiate golf, the Stanford men
showed flashes of brilliance this
weekend before fading to finish
fifth at The Nelson at Stanford Golf
Course.
Colorado State edged out No. 3
Georgia lech and Louisiana State
in the final round to take the team
title.
"The team was a little disap
pointed to close the fall like this, - '
said sophomore Tylar Lunke. "We
did lose to some pretty good teams,
but we still didn't plav to our expec
tations."
After a sparkling first round and
a solid follow-up Saturday, Stanford
was unable to close in on the leaders
in yesterday's final round, sliding

out of contention by posting a 10-
over-par Junior AH-American
Joel Kribel led the way, firing a 2-
over 215 en route to a seventh-place
finish. Sophomore Dusty Brett
joined him in the top 15 with a 2IS.
Freshman Alex Aragon and
Lunke ranked 31st and 41st, respec
tively, with freshman Jimmy Lee
rounding out the Cardinal effort
with a tie for 65th.
"We were playing on our home
course and we didn't take advan
tage of it," Lunke said. Coach Wally
Goodwin "did a good job of tough
ening the course. The roughs were
long, the greens were fast, and the
pins were tucked.
"Still, we definitely didn't play
our best golf."
Fielding a relatively young team,
the Cardinal turned heads in the
first round by shooting a 6-over 2 l )()

and grabbing a share of second
place with Georgia lech behind
KribtTs (i l >. Consistency was the
order of the day as Kribel, Lunke
and Brett all shot within two strokes
of par.
In what was anticipated as the
marquee matchup of the tourna
ment, Kribel momentarily bested
the Yellow Jackets' Matt Kueharby
two strokes before notching consec
utive over-par scores in the next two
rounds to finish four strokes behind
Kuchar.
Behind Aragon's 70 — sweet re
demption for a 9-over SO the previ
ous day — the ('ardinal stayed with
in striking distance of second-round
leader L SI I on Saturday by dupli
cating its first round 2 ( >().
In yesterdays final round, how
ever, Stanford was unable to muster
a sol ill fourth score behind a pair of

72s by Kribel and Brett and a 73 by
Aragon. The Cardinal posted a 10-
ovcr 294 and lost its hold on fourth
place to top-ranked Arkansas. All
four of the squads ahead of the C ard
were ranked in the top 20.
"The chance to play against
some top programs is always a great
experience," Goodwin said, " lech
and Arkansas are clearly two of the
top teams, and Colorado State is
fielding its best squad ever."
With the fall schedule now over,
Stanford must work to overcome
the youth and inexperience that
have been evident thus far this sea
son.
"Experience is everything,"
I.unkc said. "Hopefully a couple of
months will allow us to regroup, and
we'll be ready for some of our more
important tournaments in the
spring."
