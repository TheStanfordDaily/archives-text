There were times during last
night's match at Buck Shaw Stadium
when the Stanford men's soccer
team looked like itself.

■ SUNDAY'S RI-SULI
Sailtii Clara 5, Stanford 1

But more often, the team could
hardly be recognized, resulting in a 5-
I rout at the hands of Santa ('lara
the Cardinal's third consecutive loss.
The No. 10 Cardinal (13-3-2) was
a far cry from the team ranked No. 2
in the nation just more than a week
ago. The West Coast Conference
champion Broncos (10-7) dominated
the game from start to finish.
"Don't ask me to explain it, be
cause I can't," said head coach

Bobby Clark after the game, shaking
his head. The three-game losing
streak — which came on the heels of
a 20-game unbeaten streak spanning
two seasons — takes Stanford into
next week's MBSI championship
match.
That match,against lICLA in 1 .os
Angeles next Sunday, now becomes
a crucial factor in the Cardinal's bid
for an N( AA tournament berth.
Santa ( lara came out firing on its
home turf last night. Less than three
minutes into the game, the Broncos
got on the scoreboard on a goal by se
nior midfielder Derrick I lan is.
Stanford came back to tie the
match before the half when fresh
man forward Corey Woolfolk
knocked in a pass from junior de
fender Jamie Clark in the 34th
minute.
While the score was tied at the
half, Santa Clara clearly had out
played the C 'ardinal,and the Broncos

only re-emphasized their dominance
in the second half.
I wo minutes after halftime, Santa
Clara forward Joe Ascolese scored,
followed in similar fashion by fresh
man forward Aristotle Rodopoulous
four minutes later and freshman for
ward Michael Goehring eight min
utes after that.
The ( 'ardinal held off the Bronco
offense for only 10 more minutes he
fore Santa ('lara sealed the victory
with its fifth goal, another by As
colese, in the (V7th minute.
1 he ('ardinal responded to Santa
('lara's early lead hy shifting its con
centration from defense to offense.
"We actually played quite well
going forward," he said. "But we lost
discipline. ()nce you get behind, peo
ple start going forward and looking
for an opening. And you open your
self up at the back."
With the defense moving for
ward, Stanford goalkeeper Adam

Zapala let through nearly as many
halls in one game as he had all sea
son. I"he scene was often the same:
Zapala moving forward, expecting
backup from the back line, and a
Bronco player slipping past to score.
Santa Clara, which plays a style
similar to Stanford's, demonstrated a
good understanding of the Card's
/one style of play. Broncos seemed
to outnumber the Cardinal on the
field, and Stanford passes often went
right to the feet of its opponent.
Clark remained philosophical
about the loss, although he admitted
"it's not happened for a long while."
I here are a lot of lessons to be
learned from the game, he said, that
will need to be applied in next week 's
match.
(ioing into the Ml'Sb ehampi
onsliip game after three losses will
"test the mettle ol the squad," ( latk
said. "We've got to get back together
again."
