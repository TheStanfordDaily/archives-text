Stanford Physics Prof. Leonard
Susskind recently was awarded the
1998 J.J. Sakurai Prize, one of the
highest honors given for work in
theoretical particle physics.
According to the citation,
Susskind received the award "for
his pioneering contributions to

hadronic string models, lattice
gauge theories, quantum chromo
dynamics and dynamical symmetry
breaking."
The American Physical Society
will present the award on April 21
in Columbus, Ohio. Susskind was
nominated and chosen by fellow
physicists for the $5,000 prize.
"It's very nice to be appreciated

by my colleagues," said Susskind,
adding that the prize will have no
affect his plans for future research.
Susskind and his colleague. Y.
Nanibu from the University of
Chicago, revolutionized the field of
theoretical physics with the 1969
development of the string theory.
Historically, scientists have consid
ered the basic building blocks of

matter to be tiny points or spheres,
hut according to Susskind's string
theory, these basic units more
closely resemble tiny vibrating
strings.
Today, Susskind is working on
his newest theory, matrix theory,
which he described as a "more pro
