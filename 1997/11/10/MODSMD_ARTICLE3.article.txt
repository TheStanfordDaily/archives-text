# Susskind wins Sakurai physics prize

Susskind recently was awarded the
1998 J.J. Sakurai Prize, one of the
highest honors given for work in
theoretical particle physics.
According to the citation,
Susskind received the award "for
his pioneering contributions to

hadronic string models, lattice
gauge theories, quantum chromo
dynamics and dynamical symmetry
breaking."
The American Physical Society
will present the award on April 21
in Columbus, Ohio. Susskind was
nominated and chosen by fellow
physicists for the $5,000 prize.
"It's very nice to be appreciated

by my colleagues," said Susskind,
adding that the prize will have no
affect his plans for future research.
Susskind and his colleague. Y.
Nanibu from the University of
Chicago, revolutionized the field of
theoretical physics with the 1969
development of the string theory.
Historically, scientists have consid
ered the basic building blocks of

matter to be tiny points or spheres,
hut according to Susskind's string
theory, these basic units more
closely resemble tiny vibrating
strings.
Today, Susskind is working on
his newest theory, matrix theory,
which he described as a "more pro
found and distinct" version of his
earlier string theory.
"An expansion and improve
ment of the ideas that string theory
started," this groundbreaking the
ory solves a major contradiction in
theoretical physics, Susskind said.
The first theory to combine with
some success the theory of quan

tum mechanics — which describes
the motion of subatomic particles
— and Einstein's theory of relativ
ity — which describes the forces
governing cosmic space and time
— matrix theory "will govern all
kinds of physical phenomena," in
cluding black holes, he added.
Black holes embody Susskind's
related area of concentration. By
applying quantum mechanics and
string theory, he has attempted to
resolve the "information para

dox."
Basing his research on pure
gravity, Cambridge University
physicist Stephen Hawking lias
proposed that black holes perma
nently siphon information from the
universe. However, if Hawking's
proposal were true, the heat re
leased by black holes would have
long ago burned up the universe.
Instead, Susskind hypothesized
that black holes do indeed suck up
information but that after reaching

a certain size, they begin to evapo
rate, re-releasing their information
in a new and random state.
Doctoral student Barak Kol
said there are not yet any everyday
applications of Susskind's work.
"These things take many years
to become fruitful," Kol explained.
Right now, Susskind researches
for"the sake of knowledge and un
derstanding," Kol said. "He is a
very nice person; it's fun to work
with him."
