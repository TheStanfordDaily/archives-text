# QB controversy?
## Husak stakes claim in second half 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES — With the de
fense collapsing, the running game
stifled and the Stanford Cardinal in
a four-game freefall, what's left to
talk about?
How about a quarterback con
troversy?
Starting quarterback Chad
Hutchinson was lifted in favor of
sophomore Todd Husak at halftime
of Stanford's 45-21 loss to USC, and
after the game head coach Tyrone
Willingham did little to clear up the
question of who will start next week
at Washington State.
"We will look at it," Willingham
said.
The Card put itself in a 31-7 hole
early in the third quarter using the
same recipe for disaster as in its
prior three games: giving up big
plays and committing confidence
deflating turnovers. Husak had per
formed mop-up duty the last two
outings, directing touchdown drives
against both Arizona State and
UCLA.
But this was different. Willing
ham, seeing the game get away from
him fast, decided to sit Hutchinson
at halftime. Hutchinson's play dur
ing the first 30 minutes provided lit
tle argument to the contrary.
Aside from a 23-yard completion
to senior wide receiver Damon
Dunn toward the end of the half,
Hutchinson was only 7-of-13 for 53
yards with an interception and an ill
fated fumble at the Cardinal 9-yard
line that soon became a 22-yard
field goal by Adam Abrams to put
the Trojans up 24-7.
The decision to change quarter
backs "was made as we came in at
halftime because we felt like it
would give the team a boost and
give us a chance to execute a little bit
better." Willingham said.

Hutchinson, in his typically un
derstated manner, offered no words
of discouragement about being
benched or about his starting status
being suddenly up in the air.
"You just deal with it," Hutchin
son said. "It's not my call. Right
now, I'm just disappointed with the
loss."
With the Cardinal down by 24,
Husak tried to make the best of
things. Twice, Husak directed the
Stanford offense downfield, only to
be stopped on downs inside the
USC 30.
Apparently, the third time was
the charm. With great field position
at Stanford's own 49 early in the
fourth quarter, Husak found flanker
Troy Walters for 12 yards, hit senior
tight end Derek Hubbard for six
more and finally lofted a sideline
pass that Walters ran under for a 38-
yard strike. Suddenly it was 31-14
with only 56 seconds gone in the
final stanza, providing a faint glim
mer of hope for the Cardinal.
But those hopes were dashed by
the Trojans, who continued to
throw deep on the beleaguered
Stanford secondary, as wide receiv
er R. Jay Soward scored on a 30-
yard pass play on fourth-and-9, up
ping the score to 45-14.
Husak did lead one last touch
down drive, once again finding Wal
ters in the end zone for his third
touchdown of the game (he also
scored on an electrifying 66-yard
punt return) with 2:40 left.
Husak finished 18-of-36 for 266
yards. Granted, he was passing on
nearly every down with a 24-point
deficit, but he did enough to open a
few eyes and suddenly cast some
doubt on the starting position.
"I believe coach (Willingham)
will stick by" Hutchinson, Walters
said. "I don't think it's the quarter
back's fault. I don't think you can
just switch them and start winning."
