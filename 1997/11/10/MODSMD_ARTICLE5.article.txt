## Stanford now choosing PCs over Macs

Apple Macintosh computers
used to be a Stanford standard.
They're not any more.
In response to student and facul
ty demand. University departments
that provide computing resources
and training are doing so increasing
ly on computer platforms that run
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 op
erating system.
Meyer Library just installed 30
new Windows PCs in its computer
cluster. Tresidder Union LaIR may
replace some or all of its Macintosh
es with Windows-based PCs over
the next few years.
The Computer Science Depart
ment is considering changing some
Macintosh-based curriculum, espe
cially in its foundation courses, to
the Windows operating system or at
least giving greater support to the
use of Windows programs. Even
Residential Computing is consider
ing purchasing Windows PCs for
dorm computer clusters.
"We're responding to what fac
ulty and students need to do their

work," said Philip Gibson, head of
operations of the Research and In
structional Technologies Support
group, which oversees the computer
clusters at Tresidder and Meyer.
Gibson said that if demand con
tinues for Macintosh computers,
they will continue to be supported.
He noted that while Windows PCs
were added to the Meyer cluster,
newer Macintoshes also are still
being purchased.
But it is questionable whether
that demand will hold up, especially
if the Computer Science Depart
ment starts supporting Windows in
some of its higher-enrollment class
es.
Last year Gibson's department
did a survey of Tresidder Lai R users
to determine what kind of computer
platform they preferred.
"My an overwhelming margin,
they supported making the LaIR ei

Demand for Macintoshes is
falling among Stanford students and
faculty, just as it has plummeted in
