# End of an era
## Stanford now choosing PCs over Macs 
### T.J. Babbitt Contributing writer 
Apple Macintosh computers
used to be a Stanford standard.
They're not any more.
In response to student and facul
ty demand. University departments
that provide computing resources
and training are doing so increasing
ly on computer platforms that run
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 op
erating system.
Meyer Library just installed 30
new Windows PCs in its computer
cluster. Tresidder Union LaIR may
replace some or all of its Macintosh
es with Windows-based PCs over
the next few years.
The Computer Science Depart
ment is considering changing some
Macintosh-based curriculum, espe
cially in its foundation courses, to
the Windows operating system or at
least giving greater support to the
use of Windows programs. Even
Residential Computing is consider
ing purchasing Windows PCs for
dorm computer clusters.
"We're responding to what fac
ulty and students need to do their

work," said Philip Gibson, head of
operations of the Research and In
structional Technologies Support
group, which oversees the computer
clusters at Tresidder and Meyer.
Gibson said that if demand con
tinues for Macintosh computers,
they will continue to be supported.
He noted that while Windows PCs
were added to the Meyer cluster,
newer Macintoshes also are still
being purchased.
But it is questionable whether
that demand will hold up, especially
if the Computer Science Depart
ment starts supporting Windows in
some of its higher-enrollment class
es.
Last year Gibson's department
did a survey of Tresidder Lai R users
to determine what kind of computer
platform they preferred.
"My an overwhelming margin,
they supported making the LaIR ei
ther half-and-half Macintoshes and
l'( \ or all P( V (iibson said.
Demand for Macintoshes is
falling among Stanford students and
faculty, just as it has plummeted in
the rest of America. While Mi
crosoft's operating system has long
dominated in the business market,
over the past several years Windows
has taken over traditional Apple
niche-market strongholds, such as
education, desktop publishing and
multimedia applications.
Overall sales at the Stanford
Bookstore's Microdisc department,
which still emphasizes Macintosh
over Windows, have been dropping.
The decrease in sales has been dri
ven largely by poor sales of Apple
computers, according to Bookstore
Chief Financial Officer Dan Casper.
In the short term, the largest
Macintosh representation at Stan

ford is likely to remain with Res
Comp. While it too is considering
buying Windows PCs, a massive
switchover is unlikely to come any
time soon.
"We do all of our upgrades in the
summer. We haven't decided what
we're going to do next summer,"
said Res Comp Asst. Director
Jamey Frank.
Frank said that given the limited
staff resources of Residential Com
puting, which has only four profes
sional staff members, any large-scale
move to Microsoft Windows would
be difficult.
"The Macintosh is just a lot easi
er to support," he said.
Gibson agreed that Windows
PCs are harder to network. "The
Macintosh Chooser is better for the
printing services we need to provide

than the Windows Network Neigh
borhood," he said. "So we're a step
behind on supporting PC s."
Even though Res Comp does not
currently maintain any Windows
PCs in its clusters, it is still trying to
better serve those students who con
nect their Windows PCs to Stan
ford's network using in-room con
nections. Res Comp hopes to find a
way to allow Windows users to print
to dorm clusters over the network
this year.
On campus there is widespread
attachment to the Macintosh operat
ing system, and many students and
system administrators say they pre
fer it. But there is an equally wide
spread feeling that the Macintosh
operating system is on its last legs
and that Windows has incorporated
most of the advantages of the Mac

intosh operating system into its
newer versions.
Moreover, computer science stu
dents express a desire to work with
an operating system that most of
them will use in their professional
life.
Andrew Woodworth, a junior
who currently owns a Macintosh,
said his next computer will be a Win
dows computer.
"I still prefer the Macintosh, but I
feel like it's on its way out," he said.
"Buying one now would be kind of
like buying a Commodore 64."
The Commodore 64 home com
puter was an immensely popular
model in the early 1980s and had a
large and loyal following, but it too
fell victim to intense competition —
that time, the winner was Apple
Computer.
