### Juno Nakamura 
Max Dresden - a close friend ol
Albert Einstein and an emeritus
physics professor at Stanford died
Oct. 29 of cancer.
At the time of his death, Dresden,
79, was working at both the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center and in
the Program in I lislory and Philoso
phy of Science.
As a theoretical physicist, he
made many contributions in statisti
cal mechanics, superconductivity,
quantum field theory and elemen
tary particle physics. I Ic was also in
terested in the history and sociology
of modern science.
Born in Amsterdam in 19IS,
Dresden earned his doctorate from
the University of Michigan in 194(i

and became a I J.S. citizen in 1949. •
Through the Program in History
and Philosophy of Science, Dresden
inspired local high school teachers
with insights on the history ol sci
ence. I lis lectures were infused with
personal anecdotes of the great sci
entists of the 1920s and the 19305.
SLAC Assoc. Director P.A.
Moore, who was a colleague of
I)resden, said he was ahle to "let the
history of science come alive" and
excitc the "hij>h school teachers,
who only knew the world of text
books" up till their encounter with
I )rcsdcn.
Dresden was also author <>l a
1987 biography of the Dutch physi
cist 11.A. Kramers, titled "Between
Tradition and Revolution."
SLAC theoretical physicist
Helen Quinn, who worked with
Dresden on lectures for high school
teachers, called him "an incredible
resource."
Quinn recalled an anecdote that
one time when Dresden was visiting
his uncle in Princeton, his uncle sug
gested that he join a young man who
was playing the piano in the lounge.
The young man turned out to be
Einstein, and through their mutual
interest in physics and music, the
two became close friends.
According to Quinn, Dresden
proposed that the two take classes
together, but Einstein wasjust inter
ested in talking and playing the
piano for hours on end.
Moore remembered Dresden
personally for his "wonderful sense
of humor." Quinn said he was"de-

lightful" and "intense, always inter
ested in what he was telling you."
Quinn said everyone who met
Dresden "fell in love with him." In a
survey Quinn conducted to the high
school teachers on how to improve
lectures, the majority response was
"more Max."
Prior to coming to Stanford,
Dresden was a faculty member at
the State University of New York-
Stony Brook. While there he helped
to found the Institute for Theoreti
cal Physics. Dresden also worked at
Fermi Lab in Illinois, the University
of lowa, Northwestern University,
Argonne National Laboratory in
Illinois, Johns Hopkins University
and the University of Kansas.
A memorial service is scheduled
for 1 p.m. Saturday in the SLAC au
ditorium complex.
Contributions in his memory
may be made to the Max Dresden
Memorial Fund, which will support
bringing physicists and physics
teachers together.
