# Bonds can't be broken among 'Hermanos'
## 
### Rito Treviño Staff writer 
Many campus groups focus on the goals of
Chicano / Latino students, from academic ex
cellence to community service and social events.
Los Hermanos de Stanford covers all of these
grounds but goes one step further by establish
ing unbreakable bonds among its members.
According to junior Jose Ferrel, a 3-year
member of Los Hermanos, the unique thing
about the group is the sense of hermanilad,
which he describes as a synthesis between fel
lowship and culture.
"Uermundad is the thing that binds us to
gether." Ferrel said. "We share many of the
same components as other groups, but what's
different is that we're close enough to consider

every other member a true friend."
The concept of brotherhood has led many to
believe that Los Hermanos is an unofficial Lati
no fraternity. Junior Anibal Sanchez, the
group's president, asserted that this is not the
case.
"Our organization has its own identity, and
its direction is different from that ol the Greek
system," Sanchez said
"A Latino fraternity would totally miss the
point of the group," Ferrel added, citing Los
Hermanos' primary goals of academics and
community service.
The divergence from the Greek system goes
back to the group's roots. According to Jose
Gordon, the Los Hermanos administrative as
sistant. the first group met informally in 1 to
discuss the needs of male Latinos. They began

by approaching an olf-campus ('hicano fratci 111-
ty, Ciamnia /eta Alpha, lint a conflict in goals
led to the formation of an autonomous group.
In the fall of 1994, Los I lermanosdc Stanford
became official, Ferrcl said. The "founding la
thers" ol the group have since graduated, and
the remaining 16 members uphold their tradi
tions.
When the UC Berkeley chapter ol (iamma
/eta Alpha invited them to join the fraternity
last month, the members ol Los Hermanos po
litely declined, Sanchez said.
"Los I lermancis de Stanford is largely a com
munity service organization," said junior Lmilio
Acevedo, the group's vice president Ihe group

Among the group's continuing
service efforts is a tutoring and
mentoring program at Menlo
Atherton High School, Ferrel said.
He added that beginning in the
spring of last year, Los Hermanos
was able to provide two $S(K) col
lege scholarships to teenagers in
the program.
According to Ferrel, Los Her
manos facilitated a peer pressure
workshop with teens during the
on-campus Raza Day event put on
by MeCHA. Acevedo added that
Los Hermanos has also helped out
with the community's yearly Di'a
de Los Muertos event, and most
recently the group volunteered at a
haunted house in East Palo Alto
for I lalloween.
Los Hermanos has its social
side, too. According to Sanchez,
the group puts on a yearly dance
party called Club Caliente, whose
proceeds supported the Los Her
manos high school scholarships.
Within the group, members

hone their service skills to support
each other's academic efforts.
"To help each other, we've held
Weh page workshops, resume
workshops, and '4.0' workshops,"
Ferret said. "We hold group study
sessions and set GPA goals for
each quarter to bring about self
motivation."
The members of Los Hermanos
also get together to relax. In addi
tion to their weekly meetings, the
group has regular "kick-back" ses
sions from watching movies to
horse races, Acevedo said.
They've also gone on retreats to
Carmel Valley and survived white
water river rafting trips.
"The retreats we have every
quarter tend to produce the great
est memories," Gordon said.
Sanchez hopes to bring 10 to 15
new members to the group this
year, as replacements for the eight
that graduated last year. Hut as the
current members of Los Her
manos describe it, the group's re
cruiting process is by no means a
simple one.
"It works over the span of three
quarters," Acevedo explained.

"During the fall we hold informa
tion sessions and social activities,
so they can get to know us. The ac
tual process begins winter quarter,
and it lasts indefinitely."
"It's a process of self-selection,"
Sanchez continued. "We make it a
bit rigorous to see whether people
are really committed to joining the
group."
Sanchez declined to disclose the
details of the recruiting process,
but he stressed that they empha
sized social interaction and includ
ed absolutely no hazing. Acevedo
said that a special induction event
is held in the spring for those who
continually show full interest in the
group.
Ferrel emphasized the advan
tages of a small group with a re
cruiting process compared to one
with an open membership policy.
"We're not interested in a long
roster of people," Ferrel said. "We
want sincere friendships. Think of
the potential of a group where you
consider everyone to be your
brother. There's a lot of power
working side by side with those
people."
