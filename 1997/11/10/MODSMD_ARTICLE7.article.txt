Many campus groups focus on the goals of
Chicano / Latino students, from academic ex
cellence to community service and social events.
Los Hermanos de Stanford covers all of these
grounds but goes one step further by establish
ing unbreakable bonds among its members.
According to junior Jose Ferrel, a 3-year
member of Los Hermanos, the unique thing
about the group is the sense of hermanilad,
which he describes as a synthesis between fel
lowship and culture.
"Uermundad is the thing that binds us to
gether." Ferrel said. "We share many of the
same components as other groups, but what's
different is that we're close enough to consider

every other member a true friend."
The concept of brotherhood has led many to
believe that Los Hermanos is an unofficial Lati
no fraternity. Junior Anibal Sanchez, the
group's president, asserted that this is not the
case.
"Our organization has its own identity, and
its direction is different from that ol the Greek
system," Sanchez said
"A Latino fraternity would totally miss the
point of the group," Ferrel added, citing Los
Hermanos' primary goals of academics and
community service.
The divergence from the Greek system goes
back to the group's roots. According to Jose
Gordon, the Los Hermanos administrative as
sistant. the first group met informally in 1 to
discuss the needs of male Latinos. They began

by approaching an olf-campus ('hicano fratci 111-

led to the formation of an autonomous group.
In the fall of 1994, Los I lermanosdc Stanford
became official, Ferrcl said. The "founding la
thers" ol the group have since graduated, and
the remaining 16 members uphold their tradi
tions.
When the UC Berkeley chapter ol (iamma

last month, the members ol Los Hermanos po
litely declined, Sanchez said.
"Los I lermancis de Stanford is largely a com
munity service organization," said junior Lmilio
