Meet the editor, Stewart Burns. Wednesday, H/12, at 4 p.m.
The Montgomery bus boycott was a formative moment in twentieth-century history. In his new book
Stewart Burns presents a groundbreaking documentary of the boycott. Using an extraordinary array of
more than one hundred original documents, he crafts a compelling account of this celebrated year-long
protest of racial segregation. Stewart Burns is a historian and resident fellow at Stanford University,
and former editor of the Martin Luther King Jr. papers.
