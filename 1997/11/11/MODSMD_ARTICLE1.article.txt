# From MTV to Stanford
## Soren spends year on the Farm

She's danced on tables until 3 a.m. with R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, con
ducted the first interview with President Clinton after the infamous Dick
Morris debacle and commentated at galas from the MTV Video Awards
to an inaugural ball.
Having reached her loftiest goals, MTV News anchor Tabitha Soren
has just one question.
"I'm only 30. Now what do I do?"
To help figure out just what to tackle next, Soren has taken a one-year
respite from MTV to participate in Stanford's Knight Fellowship Pro
gram for journalists. As a fellow. Soren takes classes — minus the re
sponsibilities of homework, tests and grades — in order to help her grow
as a journalist.
In between her busy class schedule, Soren found time last month for
a honeymoon with her new husband — best-selling author and journal
ist Michael Lewis — whom she met on the campaign trail.
As she flirtatiously waved good-bye to Lewis at the door of the Com
munication Department's lounge, flung her backpack to the ground and
curled up on the large couch to chat, it was clear Soren fits in at Stanford
just fine.
Of Prof. John Taylor's Economics 1 class, Soren said. "It's incessant.
It's bloody awful."
"Damned if I'm going to my discussion group at 7:30 on Thursday
nights," she added. "I cut myself some slack in those areas."
English classes, a business school class, photography and yoga round
out her schedule, although she finds time for extracurriculars such as
swimming and tanning at deGuerre pool.
Soren lived in Greenwich Village as an undergraduate while attend
ing New York University and was part of the "punk rock, downtown
New York scene." Not surprisingly, Stanford feels entirely new.
"I don't feel like I've gone back to school because it's so differ
ent. . .It's a joy," Soren said. "1 feel like I'm at a country club."
In her own college days, Soren majored in journalism and politics and
took advantage of internship opportunities, working at CNN, MTV,
ABC and NBC, as well as a cable access station.
Her first job out of college was covering the Vermont state govern
ment for an ABC affiliate.
