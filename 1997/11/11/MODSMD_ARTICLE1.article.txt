# From MTV to Stanford
## Soren spends year on the Farm

She's danced on tables until 3 a.m. with R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, con
ducted the first interview with President Clinton after the infamous Dick
Morris debacle and commentated at galas from the MTV Video Awards
to an inaugural ball.
Having reached her loftiest goals, MTV News anchor Tabitha Soren
has just one question.
"I'm only 30. Now what do I do?"
To help figure out just what to tackle next, Soren has taken a one-year
respite from MTV to participate in Stanford's Knight Fellowship Pro
gram for journalists. As a fellow. Soren takes classes — minus the re
sponsibilities of homework, tests and grades — in order to help her grow
as a journalist.
In between her busy class schedule, Soren found time last month for
a honeymoon with her new husband — best-selling author and journal
ist Michael Lewis — whom she met on the campaign trail.
As she flirtatiously waved good-bye to Lewis at the door of the Com
munication Department's lounge, flung her backpack to the ground and
curled up on the large couch to chat, it was clear Soren fits in at Stanford
just fine.
Of Prof. John Taylor's Economics 1 class, Soren said. "It's incessant.
It's bloody awful."
"Damned if I'm going to my discussion group at 7:30 on Thursday
nights," she added. "I cut myself some slack in those areas."
English classes, a business school class, photography and yoga round
out her schedule, although she finds time for extracurriculars such as
swimming and tanning at deGuerre pool.
Soren lived in Greenwich Village as an undergraduate while attend
ing New York University and was part of the "punk rock, downtown
New York scene." Not surprisingly, Stanford feels entirely new.
"I don't feel like I've gone back to school because it's so differ
ent. . .It's a joy," Soren said. "1 feel like I'm at a country club."
In her own college days, Soren majored in journalism and politics and
took advantage of internship opportunities, working at CNN, MTV,
ABC and NBC, as well as a cable access station.
Her first job out of college was covering the Vermont state govern
ment for an ABC affiliate.

MTV journalist Tabitha Soren is spending a year at Stanford in the
Knight Fellows Program.
"I w;is bored out of my mind."
she said.
She opted to return to New
York and landed a spot on MTV
News, substituting lor Kurt Loder.
She interviewed then-presidential
candidate Clinton in 1991 and
earned a permanent spot as an
chor.
She has since covered two presi
dential elections and worked with

the MTV Choose or Lose cam
paign. which encourages young
people to vote. Motivating groups
which tend to vote in low numbers
such as young people, women
and the homeless is important
for the I J.S. democracy to work, ac
cording to Soren.
"II we're going to go around
forcing democracy 011 the rest of the
world, we might as well make an at
tempt at having a real one here."
she said.
Though MTV may not seem the
likeliest place to turn to stay abreast

of current events. Soren said MTV
News is an essential part of the net
work.
"Videos get boring," Soren said.
"Young people are interested in
more than just music. You get their
attention with the entertainment,
but then you can talk about the vote
on Capitol Mill or the anxieties of
getting pregnant. You might as well
give them something good along
with the music."
Soren also interacts with celebri
ties on a regular basis as part of her
work at MTV. although meeting

stars isn't as fun as it may seem to
the audiences at home, she said.
"Celebrities are rarely memo
rable people. They get boring be
cause they only know how to talk
about themselves," she noted.
With all the apparent excite
ment of meeting celebrities and
politicians on a regular basis, some
may wonder just why Soren would
give it up for a year to come to the
Farm.
"The Knight Fellowship Pro
gram is an incredibly unique situa
tion," Soren said. "It allows jour

nalists to pursue for a year knowl
edge for the sake of knowledge. So
often, journalists are all assigned
the same stories. You all get the
same information from the same
people. This gives you different ref
erence points."
Though she said MTV is a "lux
urious situation." she might like to
make documentaries and pursue
other goals in the future.
"I just want to be inspired to do
it again," Soren said. "1 think a year
here will open my mind to what's
available."
