Woodward's conviction reduced
CAMBRIDGE. Mass. (AP) — A judge reduced
Louise Woodward's murder conviction to
manslaughter and set the English au pair tree yester
day in hopes of bringing "a compassionate conclu
sion" to a case that threw a spotlight on everything
from working moms to the American legal system.
Judge Hiller B. Zobel sentenced Ms. Woodward
to the 274 days served since her arrest last February
in the death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen.
The round-faced 19-year-old showed no reaction
in court, not even the enigmatic smile that crossed
her lips from time to time during testimony. Her
lawyers said she would have no comment. Accompa
nied by her parents, she got into a vehicle with tinted
windows and left with a police motorcycle escort.
Hours earlier, the judge ruled that she killed the
baby bv shaking him violently but that her actions
did not constitute second-degree murder because she
did not act with malice. Second-degree murder car
ries a mandatory sentence of life in prison with the
possibility of parole after 15 years.
"In selecting the sentence here 1 do not denigrate
Matthew Eappen's death nor his family's grief,"
Zobel said. But he added: '"It is. in my judgment,
time to bring the judicial part of this extraordinary
matter to a compassionate conclusion."

MCI-WorldCom make mega-merger
NEW YORK (AP) — World Com Inc.. an upstart
Mississippi company led by a former high school bas
ketball coach, beat the telecommunications giants
yesterday to win a takeover battle for MCI with a $37
billion deal - the biggest merger in U.S. history.
The deal, which is subject to approval by regula
tors. would transform the landscape of the telecom
munications industry. It could also speed up merger
talks by other companies trying to take advantage of
changes in federal rules governing competition.
The combined company would be a behemoth
selling a full range of services — from local and long
distance to Internet connections — to 22 million cus
tomers in more than 200 countries.
WorldCom's bid. made up mostly of stock,
leapfrogged a $2N billion cash offer from CITE Corp.
and also thwarted a $24 billion merger agreement
with British Telecommunications PLC.
MCI already is the nation's second-largest long
distance company, behind AT&T, and would remain
so after the merger with No. 4 World Com.
"CITE is a fine company. We didn't dismiss it
lightly." MCI chairman Bert Roberts Jr. said. But
"MCI has made the best possible choice with this
alignment with World Com. I he two companies have
complementary strengths."
