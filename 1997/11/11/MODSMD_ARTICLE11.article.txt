# U.S.-Iraq standoff continues
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (Al>) â€” The United Slates
asked the U.N. Security Council yesterday to condemn
Iraq and threaten it with "serious consequences" unless
Baghdad backs down from its refusal to cooperate with
Americans on I I.N. weapons inspection teams.
Despite the harsh words, the I Inited States appeared
more interested in preserving council unity than pun
ishing Iraq.
Russian Ambassador Sergey l.avrov said his govern
ment opposes "any threat or use of force" in the crisis
and indicated Iraq's complaints needed to be heard.
I he U.S. envoy to the I Inited Nations. Bill Richard
son, said the I Inited States opposes Iraq's request for a
Security Council hearing to air its grievances. Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister lariq A/i/, who made the
request, wants to argue Baghdad's case that the Amer
icans are manipulating the U.N inspection teams.
Arriving for the private council meeting, Richardson
said he would ask the 15-member body to adopt a
"strong resolution" to condemn Iraq, demand full com
pliance with U.N. orders, impose a travel ban on Iraqi
officials who interfere with inspections and warn of
"serious consequences to follow."
Richardson said if the council refuses, "all bets are
go, all options are open."
Significantly, council diplomats, speaking on condi
lion of anonymity, said the American proposal did not
declare that Iraq had breached the IWI (iulf War
cease-fire - a condition for military action to force

compliance.
Il appeared the U.S. priority \\;is to get all 15 coun
cil members to state lor the record that what Iraq did
was illegal rather than push for punishing measures or
military action.
l hc council meeting ended alter about 2 1/2 hours
and there was no indication when a vote would be
taken. I I.N. officials said they expected it by midweek.
Ihe diplomatic sources s.iul I ranee argued that
Baghdad should be given more time to comply with
I'.N. orders before the council adopts punitive mea
sures.
I'hcy s;ml I Sand British diplomats were working
last night on a draft resolution. I aced with Russian and
French objections, the final draft was expected to soft
en the warning from "serious consequences" to simply
"consequences."
Washington is furious at Iraq for refusing to cooper
ate with American weapons inspectors and threatening
to fire on I'.S -piloted I'-2 surveillance planes flying
I I.N. missions.
I ranee. China anil Russia have joined with Wash
ington in demanding that President Saddam Hussein
rescind his decision to expel the six American inspec
tors from Iraq.
A I I.S, British proposal imposing an automatic trav
el ban failed last month to gain support of five ol the 15
council members. But U.S. and British officials were
hopeful they would change their minds.
