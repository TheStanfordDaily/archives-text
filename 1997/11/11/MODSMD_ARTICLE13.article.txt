Despite less than
stellar Pac-10 play,
there's still Big Game

I I DOI .SN' I SEEM like very long ago
that we had rosy hopes of a bowl game
in Pasadena. After our crushing Oct. 4
victory against Notre Dame, it seemed like
nothing could make lired up Stanford foot
ball drop the ball.
But we did. And then we did again. And
again. And again.
The last month has been a football night
mare. Alto four straight losses to Arizona.
Arizona State, IJC'LA and IJSC, it seems
like Stanford's record can't get much worse.
I his is the longest losing streak the ( ardinal
has had since l l > ( M. and we have dropped to
a tie for sixth place in the conference.
()ver the last lour games, our offense has
not done well. We have been unable to
niustci a good rushing game or maintain con
trol at the line of scrimmage. The Card quar
terback. sophomore Chad Hutchinson, has
been left unprotected and has been sacked
more than 30 times this year.
Our defense is lacking as well. The sec
ondary and defensive ends don't have the
fire they did against Oregon and Notre
Dame. We have had turnover after
turnover. The situation became even worse

Saturday against IJSC, who pretty much
ran against us at will, and then scored.
Where there had been burning bowl
hopes iu sight, there is now only a team
hoping only to finish the season above .S(H).
Despite the disappointing losses that
Stanford has incurred this tall and regard
less of how bad the team has been looking
so far, all is not lost. Everything can be
redeemed in the fans' eyes in a single game.
Nov. 22 will mark the 1 (K)th Big (iame in
Stanford history, and for Stanford lans one
of the most important objectives we charge
to the football team is keeping the Axe
where it belongs, at Stanford.
Students, faculty, staff, alumni and all
the rest of the Cardinal fans are primed and
ready to watch you crush those wimpy
Weenies.
It's been more than five years since Stan
lord Stadium has been sold out for Big
(lame. Students have been clamoring to
bring back a Lake Lagunita bonfire, and
enthusiasm and support for the football
team and excitement is impassioned and
running high.
The time is here.
Above all games, this is the one we need
to win; this is the game where all respect
lies. We want this win more than any other,
and we support you.
Fight your hardest and put the rest of the
season behind you. Look forward and
make sure to BEAT ( AL!
