## An unhappy mix The 						human mind and Mother Earth 
### 
I SOMETIMES worry
about the human
mind. Say that I steal
Hobby's truck because I
simply want a truck to
play with or because a
part of me just wants to
feel the rush of power in
stealing one.

c
My mind will be absolutely persistent in
maintaining that these desires have nothing
to do with my actions. Instead, it will argue
something along the lines of: Hobby has
plenty of trucks and taking one off his hands
is far from criminal. In fact, I'm alleviating
him of some excess baggage!
The mind can be so amazingly powerful
in justifying actions, which are largely based
upon unconscious choices. To use Freud's
terms, it's as though the id and the ego have
teamed up. as the ego takes on the job of
rationalizing the senseless decisions of the id.
Now let's say that I treat the earth like I
treat Hobby. That is, I continually kick
Mother Earth in the butt through my mod
ern-day habits of consuming and producing,
and yet all I do is rationalize my behavior. I
possess strong unconscious desires of want
ing a 'comfortable' life, but my conscious
mind fabricates intricate reasons to explain
what is really a product of these desires.
1 am almost acting in accordance with
the law of physics that states that all systems
will tend to go from higher levels of energy
to lower levels. It is easier for me to create a
web of rationalization for my environmen

tally destructive habits, rather than to face
the heart of the matter and recognize that
humans cause the gradual death ol Earth.
For instance, I will sometimes deny that
there's even an environmental crisis by
pointing out that the earth is resilient. Nat
ural disasters inflict plenty ol damage, and
Mother Earth always bounces back. In fact,
natural disasters are beyond harmless —
they are actually essential to the cycles ol
nature.
I will make the "clear" conclusion that
human-induced destruction will have the
same effects: the earth will find a way to go
on. It's like the human body that becomes
injured and then heals. 1 will just happen to
forget that excessive damage to the body
(i.e. damage that the body is riot designed to
handle) causes death.
Further, statistics (from multiple
sources) say that as many as 6().(KX) U.S. cit
izens die every year from breathing legal
levels of particulates. With glazed eyes, I
respond by saying: "Oh well. You know,
we've gotta go somehow."
Sometimes, when I'm feeling small and
irrelevant. I use the "drop in the bucket"'
argument. That is. somehow, my faulty logic
leads me to say that it's okay for one indi
vidual to neglect environmental responsibil
ity. We should only be concerned when it's
a group of individuals.
Again, unconsciously, 1 just want to be
lazy. I want to throw away my will and
transport myself to the lowest level of ener
gy. By making myself a mere drop in the

bucket. I achieve this and don t need to be
responsible for my actions.
I also look at those young environmental
maniacs and their complete naivete, and I
want to laugh. 1 hey re always looking at
something that may very slightly perturb
the state of the environment and condemn
it as if it were the work of the devil.
And as for changing the ways of the
world, 1 must even laugh harder. How can
some environmentalists be so distanced
from the world that they really think that
society will radically change its ways?
Ironically, while recognizing their
neglect to face reality, I forget to under
stand that I err in the same way. I then
scream out with unintentional foresight:
"Such narrow-minded and near-sighted
judgments are going to be the downfall ot
this world!"
What the hell is the point? Its that most
of us, at times, are foolish in the sense that
we rationalize away the reality ot this plan
et's gradual death. And it we're not being
like Rush Limbaugh and idiotically denying
that there even is an environmental crisis,
we're overcome by indifference and usually
justify the inaction, rather than facing the
fact that it exists.
So we can have our heads where the sun
don't shine, like Rush, or we can recognize
that we can't buy new and clean planet at
Wal-Mart.
