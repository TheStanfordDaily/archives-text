MEChA banner stolen
On Tuesday night a banner stating "NO
on GRAPES" was placed up on the cage
in White Pla/a by MEChA (Movimiento
Estudantil Ghicanode Aztlan). The fol
lowing morning this banner was gone.
Countless numbers of banners are dis
played on the cage daily.
The disappearance of this banner con
cerns me. At first. I wondered why it may
be that a banner would have been taken
down so soon after placing it up on the
cage. In my search to find out why this
had occurred I went to the Office of Stu
dent Activities with the thought that 1
might have violated some kind of rule for
placing a banner up on the cage. No. it
wasn't that.
After examining the location where the
banner was placed 1 soon realized that the
tape holding the banner up scented to have
been carefully taken off. Someone must
have consciously taken some time to
remove the banner. If this is the case 1 ask
what happened to respect and free speech?
As students we have the right to voice
our opinions. It is one matter to disagree
with a person's opinion. However, it is
another issue to disrespect other people by
taking a direct action against their opinions.
I had hoped that Stanford might foster

socially responsible people that would at the
least respect other's opinions. Unfortunate
ly, it seems that my hope is wrong. Not only
(Jck's the violation of the principle of free
speech and respect bother me. but the con
tent of this specific banner also concerns me.
The issue of grapes is of special concern
to myself and the Latino community as a
whole. The fact that this banner advocating
against the serving of grapes on our cam
pus was taken down during the voting pro
cess on grapes makes me a bit suspicious. I
have one word to say to the person who
took the banner down: RESPECT.

Maybe the bonfire is a
salamander aphrodisiac
1 have been reading the current debate
over the Big Game bonfire with great
interest as to me the bonfire was always
one of the major highlights of the school
year.
I would like to suggest that the bonfire
is not at all a threat to the tiger salaman
der's habitat in the lake bed and nearby
foothills but is really a romantic aphrodisi
acal interlude causing them to increase

their mating activity.
If this were not true, why have they sur
vived so well in this area after years of
bonfires and have died out in other bon
fire-free habitats?

Despite the fact that the street play
script announces repeatedly that the
School of the Americas is located in Fort
Benning. Ga.. the caption under the
photograph of the play in Friday's Daily
still managed to place the school in
Panama.
The stories of pain and suffering that
were recited during the street play are not
"alleged;" they are well documented real
life nightmares. Only a handful of thou
sands of SoA graduates were charged in
the street play. All of them have commit
ted egregious violations of human rights by
any standard, and they learned many of
their tactics from our tax-funded school
run by the U.S. Army.
