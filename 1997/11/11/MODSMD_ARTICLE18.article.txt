## Just a country girl with a slick city soul

Kelly Young

I HAVE BEEN obsessed with the word
"pulse" since I was young. I think it
really hit me as a 6-year-old. The doctor
couldn't lind my pulse and teasingly asked
me il 1 was still alive. Naturally. 1 took him
seriously and took a few deep breaths
just to make sure.
But whether things are alive or not. I've
always believed that they still have a pulse.
After all. everything has a pulse. You. Me.
Rocks. Trees. Cars. My left shoe. Here, let
me give you a more concrete example.
My parents are country people. There's
no changing that. They hate driving in the
city. They hate the hordes of people. They
hate the tilth, the smell, the smog. You can
imagine what our European vacation was
like. We saw a lot of tiny villages. We
delighted in the German countryside. We
saw "quaint." like "quaint" was meant to be
seen. However, every time we got into a big
city, my parents would freak out after only
an afternoon of said city elements. We
would have to abandon the wonderfully

loud culture of the city for a quiet bed and
breakfast in a small Bavarian village. Oi.
I just didn't think we were doing justice
to the major European cities. That's what
our entire European vacation was like,
whiz/ing from city to city, never stopping
long enough to get a feel for any of these
cities. I wanted to hear a symphony in
Salzburg, take a canal trip in Amsterdam
and just relax in Munich.
I am obviously my parents' mutant child.
I have a chronic condition called "The
Urban Factor." Somewhere along the rural
genetic line, I inherited a love for the city.
Granted, I love the open space almost as
much as my parents do, but for me, a good
city can be just as satisfying. A city has its
own pulse like a good song. Since becoming
a student at Stanford, I've really come to
appreciate the multi-colored pulse of San
Francisco. You can't always find this pulse
in a Fodor's three-hour scenic walk. You
need to explore a city on your own, getting
trapped in its little intricacies.

Luckily, I have the fortune to be spend
ing an entire quarter in a major city. For
three months, I get to put my own two fin
gers on the carotid artery of Moscow, the
political capital of a "society in transition."
However, this is only a small part of Russian
culture. All quarter, 1 anxiously awaited the
center's annual excursion to St. Petersburg,
Russia's capital of culture.
1 hat's where we met her. I ler name was
Lena. She had long brown hair that she kept
tucked up in her gray stocking cap. She had
a bit of a gap between her two front teeth.
She, like other Russian women, wore skirts
on the coldest of cold days. Little did we
know that underneath that sweet exterior
lay a drill sergeant in training. That's right.
She was (dramatic pause) our tour guide.
Thanks to our Tour Na/i... er... guide,
my experience at the Hermitage strangely
mirrored my European tour. Lena first led
us up to the third floor ol the Hermitage
museum, Russia's premier art collection
and basically told us, "You have 20 minutes

to look at ;ilI ot the Hermitage's French
Impressionists. Well, what are you waiting
for? Move! Move! Move!"
1 think I saw some of the greatest works
ol Matisse, Van Ciogh. Picasso, Pisarro,
Monet, Serot and Rodin, but I can't really
be sure. It was all a blur of color. I here went
Van Ciogh! Oh, did you blink? Sorry, you
missed it.
1 couldn't allow myself to get engrossed
in any one painting. 1 here was too much to
see. 1 ime was precious. After 25 minutes (I
think the extra five minutes was for good
behavior), Lena shuffled us along to the
tapestries, the Dutch artists, the restoration
ol Danae, Catherine the Cireat's carriage,
some ancient Egyptian stuff, some furniture
and some other stuff. My attention span
dwindled as we neared the end ol our tour,
and we only saw about 20 percent of the
museum's collections.
I just wanted to get lost in the I lennitage,
away from this hideous tour group. I want
ed to see the actual brushstrokes of paint

ings that many Stanford students buy in
I runt dI the Mookstorc every quarter, hut
alas, there was no time. I had to resort to
buying, the gilt store version ol everything I
missed.
I'm no art connoisseur, but 1 know what
1 like. When I like something, whether it's a
painting, a city or a song. I want to dive into
it. I want to become completely and utterly
absorbed in it. There is no halfway. Unfor
tunately at the Hermitage. I couldn't do
this. 1 didn't have enough time to connect
with the individual works.
1 understand what Lena and my parents
were trying to do â€” see as much as possible
in the short amount ol time allotted. I'hey
were trying to give me breadth and not
depth. Stanford students face this battle
every quarter when they choose their class
es. It's called the (iER.
