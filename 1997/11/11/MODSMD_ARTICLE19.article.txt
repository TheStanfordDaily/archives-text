// | REEDOM IS
|-H NOT free," a
JL poem pro
claims, then supports the
point with several emo
tional examples. I share
this feeling, revere my
freedom and even hold
idealistically the belief that

everyone who enjoys freedom should appre
ciate it — if not make some personal sacri
fices to preserve it for the people they care
about. For those who don't seem to appreci
ate it, I don't hope they lose it someday —
that would be far too cruel. I do hope they
talk to some people who have lost their free
dom. For those sensitive enough for true
empathy, this would instill some apprecia
tion for their own freedom.

When 1 was a child, 1 was convinced there
was a "Right" thing and a "Wrong" thing to
do, and I was told very early that I was "old
enough to know the difference." The more
I've learned and experienced, the ha/ier the
dividing lines have grown on many issues —-
particularly choosing sides in disputes
between individuals or organizations.
Despite the valid grievances both sides may
hold. I still watch the way each side treats the
people they control during conflicts as a lit
mus test to determine who is on the side of
"Right" and who is on the side of "Wrong."
For example, if only one side in a war tor
tures prisoners and needlessly sacrifices the
lives of its own troops for short-lived tactical
victories, I'd say they are on the side of
"Wrong" even though legitimate grievances
may have started the conflict. I give this test

litmus authority because ol my reverence for
freedom relative to other values that may
have initiated the fight.
1 won't insist everyone use this lest I'd
rather persuade you to dwell on what losing
your freedom would mean to you and how
you d feel i) someone abused then power
over you. Many victims of crime will relate to
this immediately. Now imagine enduring that
situation all day, every day! Surely, some
people reading this will think of an employei
or instructor and joke: "I do endure an abuse
of power all day and every day." Still, I
implore you to estimate the level of vour
abuse relative to torture or murder.
For those of you unwilling to make per
sonal sacrifices for the sake of preserving
the freedom this country enjoys, at least
respect those of us who make sacrifices on

your and your children's behalf. More
important than giving respect, please don't
punish those who volunteer to make sacri
fices on behalf of our freedom by excluding
them from reasonable opportunities. With
out employei tolerance lor personnel with
part time military reserve and guard panic
ipation, the strength of American forces in
crisis situations would be severely dimin
ished. While laws protect the employment
rights of guard and reserve personnel,
opportunities are ultimately created or
destroyed by the attitudes ol employers.
Employers who make it possible for
reservists to take time away from work for
military service deserve acknowledgment.
The perturbation to continuous productivity
in the workplace is a significant sacrifice
many employers are unwilling to make. For

I hose o! us who desire an active role 111 pre
serving freedom while enjoying civilian free
doms in l imcs ol peace, we dearly appreciate
your attitude. Reservist and guard personnel
maintain continual readiness, in part, due tit
your compassion and teamwork. In opera
tions around the world, our lives depend on
our readiness. In maintaining adequate
readiness, we can deliver reliable and suffi
cient strength when freedom is challenged
and have a better chance of paying less than
the ultimate price for our roll in preserving
freedom.
Surely, freedom is not free. For all who
dare to sacrilice: Po freedom! I low sweet it
is.
