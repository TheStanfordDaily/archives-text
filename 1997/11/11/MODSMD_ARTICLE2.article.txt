The computer clusters in Meyer Library and
Tresidder Union will begin supporting a new
printing system under the Stanford Card Flan
today.
According to Phil Gibson, head of opera
tions for Research and Instructional Technolo
gy Support. "The new printing system will be
one unified account under the [plan]."
KITS, which currently runs the quota sys

tem at the Meyer and Tresidder clusters, will
not abolish the old quota system. I lie new and
old systems will run simultaneously but sepa
ratelv on different printers, though the old s\s
tem will gradually be phased out. according to
Gibson.
To distinguish between printers on each sys
tem, the names of printers on the old system
will remain the same, while the names of print
ers on the new system will be preceded by a
prefix that indicates that it accepts the card
plan.
