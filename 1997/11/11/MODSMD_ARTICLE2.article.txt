# Card Plan accounts come to clusters
## 
### Arthur Hu Staff writer 
The computer clusters in Meyer Library and
Tresidder Union will begin supporting a new
printing system under the Stanford Card Flan
today.
According to Phil Gibson, head of opera
tions for Research and Instructional Technolo
gy Support. "The new printing system will be
one unified account under the [plan]."
KITS, which currently runs the quota sys

tem at the Meyer and Tresidder clusters, will
not abolish the old quota system. I lie new and
old systems will run simultaneously but sepa
ratelv on different printers, though the old s\s
tem will gradually be phased out. according to
Gibson.
To distinguish between printers on each sys
tem, the names of printers on the old system
will remain the same, while the names of print
ers on the new system will be preceded by a
prefix that indicates that it accepts the card
plan.

I he cost <>l .ill black ami while laser prinl ing
will he reduced to seven cents per page, from
ten cents per page.
I residder and Meyer will each start with one
printer under the new system. I he number ol
printers on each system will change depending
on demand and user response, according to
(iihson.
I he new system means that users will have to
enter their user name and password alter initi
ating a print job, even if they are
already logged on. This is because
"the new system will have a sepa
rate user authentication from
MacLeland," said Greg Chalfin,
the system integration manager
for RITS.
In addition, the new system will
not allow users to carry a negative
balance, as the old system does.
The policy for refunds under the
old system will remain the same:
users printing to the old system who
need refunds will be refunded into
the old system. However, there are
two options for users needing re
funds under the new system.
Since the new system works
under the card plan, KI TS cannot
directly issue refunds to a stu
dent's account. Instead, e-mail
must be sent to the Bursar's Of
fice by RITS, which will then re
imburse the student, said Chalfin.
The other option allows students
to be reimbursed into their old
quota account.
At Meyer, people who wish to
print from the PC workstations
must use the old printing system.
RITS does not yet have software for
PC printing under the new system.
Chalfin said Residential Com
puting is working on an interim
World Wide Web-based printing
solution for PCs under the new
system, but it is not yet available.
Students can add money to
their card plan accounts by using
machines located on the first floor
of Green Library and next to the
ticket office in Tresidder.
Card reading machines have
been ordered for the two clusters as
well. These machines will allow stu
dents to purchase items such as
transparencies, diskettes and data
cartridges using the card plan
rather than by check. The machines
will also allow students to buy
quota in the old system for PC
printing using their card plan ac
counts.
