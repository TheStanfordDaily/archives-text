### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
It was a no-lose situation for Stanford in yester
day's singles final at the Rolex Regional Tourna
ment, where Cardinal senior Julie Scott captured
the crown by defeating teammate Teryn Ashley in a
three-set match.
It will also he a no-lose situation for the Cardinal
in tomorrow's doubles final, which pits the top-seed
ed duo of Scott and senior Ania Blcs/ysnki against
Ashley and sophomore Anne Kremer. The final is
scheduled for 2 p.m.
Bleszynski and Scott defeated teammates Jenn
Heiser and Sarah Pestieau in one semifinal round,
while Kremer and Ashley upset Cal's Amanda Au
gustus and Amy Jensen in the other.
Scott, the draw's No. 1 seed, outlasted the sixth
seeded Ashley in a back-and-forth match. Scott
took advantage of a service break in the first set. but
Ashley bounced back in the second after breaking
Scott early on. Rain forced the match to I aube Fam
ily Stadium's indoor court with Scott leading the
third set 3-0.
Ashley hung tough, holding serve twice to bring
the score to 4-2. But Scott held on for a 6-3,2-6,6-3
win and the championship.
"I thought it was really good tennis," said head
coach Frank Brennan. "I was pleased with that and
with the fact that [ Ashley) stayed in control. She has
really come a long way.
"And [Scott] is just really good. She is relentless.
It's a trite phrase, but nobody really lost that match."
Ashley's quality performance two weeks ago in
the All-American Championship seemed to carry
over into this draw. The sophomore cruised to the
final, winning all four of her matches in straight sets.
