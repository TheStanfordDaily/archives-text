"We're trying to play American-style bas
ketball," said Kairys, head coach of Silute,
which lost iiti exhibition game to Stanford last
night M.V7I. "We're the most Americanized
team 111 I ithuania."
Until Lithuania's independence from the
Soviet Union. Kairys had few chances to see
American players in action. Hut now, as Silute
begins the second half of an eight-school ("ah

add a new element to his team when it contin
ues its season back home 111 I ithuania.
" I rips like this were impossible during So
viet times," Kairys said.
Si kite's trip to California is barely afford
able, but the financial support it receives from
its eight opponents ami Kairys' commitment
to Westernizing Silute's offense makes it
worthwhile.
Despite a third-place finish in the Lithuan
ian league last year, Silute opted not to play in
the European Cup, which would have cost
$1(),(MK) for one game.
Mayers for Silute receive about $S(K) a

month, Kairys said, $3(H) more than the aver
age Lithuanian salary, lust seven years ago,
though, Kairys was coaching for a mere $15 a
month.
Although NO percent of the team is I ltluian
ian, Kairys speaks 1 inglish during timeouts and
encourages all his players to learn English as
quickly as possible. Always the educator, Ik

their quest to play college basketball in the
I Jnited States.
"It's a tradition to learn two things at the
same time: basketball and English," he said.
"English is the language of basketball."
Hut when it comes to learning American
basketball, nothing beats having a couple
Americans on your side. Kairys imported
Dion Cross, the top three-point shooter in
Stanford history, and Shawn Myers of West
C ieorgia University.
