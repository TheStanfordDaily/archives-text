Stanford I

Mut following a week plagued In injuries and
sickness, such a turnaround became improbable,
and Stanford fell 12-3 to Weber State and 3-1 to
San Jose State.

As il playing Weber Slate — the top-ranked
team in the Western Conference — was not a
daunting enough task, the Cardinal (3-5) entered
last Thursday's contest severely undermanned
and was unable to keep up with the Wildcats' end
less reserve of well rested skaters.
"We had four ol our six best offensive players
out Willi injuries," said coach Rich I alley. "We had
110 depth on the bench, which made it nearly im
possible lor us tocompete as the game wore on."
Stanford managed to slay in the game early
only by capitalizing on Weber State penalties.

period. Stanford defenseman I ilip Running, a
graduate student, capitalized on the lirst of these
man advantages, blasting in a slap shot to knot the
score at 11.
I hen, with just over a minute left in the same
period, medical student lirad I lelms took advan

After I hursday's rout, I inlay's matchup with
San Jose State figured to make for another long
night. But a determined ( ardinal team came out
of the locker room ready to battle.
Late in the first period, sopho
more Gabe Miller found the back of
the net to even the score at 1 -1.
Stanford came out roaring in the
second period, and an early goal
seemed to give the Cardinal its first
lead, but the score was disallowed.
When Stanford continued to con
trol the action, however, the game
looked like an upset in the making.
But the Spartans struck back
later in the period on a quick goal,
taking the lead for good.
"We dominated the second peri
od,-' Fahey said. " The disallowed
goal was obviously a bad break, but
our guys continued to play with
heart."
The final period was wide open,
featuring fast-paced and exciting
end-to-end play. But despite plenty
of scoring opportunities, the Cardi
nal simply couldn't score. A late
goal helped the Spartans escape
with a narrow victory.
Even in losing, though, the Car
dinal seemed to gain momentum
and steer itself in the right direction.
"1 think we all viewed this as a
turning point in our season," Fahey
said. "We played with a lot of heart
and really started to play like a
team."
