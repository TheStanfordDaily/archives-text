### Katie Chang 
Acclaimed fiction writer Randall Kenan
spoke last night at Yost House, reading his short
story "Now Why Come That Is" in a small and
intimate setting.
A young African-American writer and the
current John and Kenee Grisham Visiting
Southern writer-in-residence at the University
of Mississippi at Oxford. Kenan has published
both a novel, "A Visitation of Spirits," and a
short story collection titled "Let the Dead Bury
the Dead."
"|Kenan] is one of the premier writers of
our time," said Sharon Holland, an assistant
professor of English and resident fellow at
Yost. "I feel it is important to expose young
writers to up-and-coming writers. When
Kenan wins a Pulitzer or something, these stu
dents are going to be like Wow. I met that guy
in college.'"
The more than 20 students and faculty pro
vided a responsive audience to Kenan's animat
ed reading of his colorful story.
His selection for the reading as well his other
work reflect his North Carolina nxrts. "North
Carolina is so culturally dynamic and complex,"
explained Kenan. "I think that even if I tried to
write about California it would end up being
about North Carolina."
In the question-and-answer period following
the reading Kenan shared his experience of be
coming a writer with students as well as briefly
discussed the meanings of his own works.

He explained that "Now Why ( ome That Is"
was written with the motivation of creating a
more multi-dimensional character for its pro
tagonist, Percy Terrell, a recurring character in
Terrell's work.
"1 wrote the story to allow the character to
have a chance at redemption because in my
other stories, he has always been this Hat. 1111
sympathetic character," Kenan said.
To questions about his inspiration to write in
general. Kenan answered. "I love a good story: I
am addicted to narrative."
Kenan called writer GabrieK iarcia Marque/
one of his heroes and drew upon C iarcia Mar
quez's words to explain the difference between
short story writing and novel writing.
"With short stories, you need to maintain a
level of intensity the entire time, while in novel
writing, you put that intensity up front and then
kind of fall into the world" of the novel.
Kenan found the reading enjoyable. "Read
ing a story is helpful both technically and per
sonally. Technically because it is helpful to see
how people respond to my work and pers<>nallv.
because it is gratifying to see people enjoying
your work."
Kenan is currently working on a novel ami is
publishing a nonfiction work titled "Walking on
Water." which is about being black.
He has been a contributor to I he New York
Times and The Nation and an assistant editor at
Knopf Publishing. He has taught writing at Co
lumbia University and English at Sarah
Lawrence College.
