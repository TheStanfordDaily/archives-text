## Police debunk rumors of abductions 
### Gaurav Misra 
An e-mail message circulated this
weekend warning of gang-related
abductions is a hoax, according to the
Palo Alto Police Department.
I he message states tli.it a gang of
Mexican youths from l ast Palo Alto
was sneaking into women's cars at
gas stations and then forcing them to
drive to remote locations. I'lie pur
ported initiation rite required gang
members to then rape their victims
and "take a souvenir."
Women were warned not to leave
their cars unlocked when the went to
pay lor their gas, since that is when
the attackers supposedly snack into
the cars.
I'he message identified three tar
get gas stations: the Palo Alto Shell at
I.vtton Avenue and Alma, the

Menlo Park I Jnocal 7fton II ( amino
Real and an unnamed station in
Menlo Park.
I he Palo Alto Police Department
said in a statement that they have no
information regarding such initiation
rites. Also, there have been no re
ports ol crimes resembling the sup
posed incidents.
()nce the message was released,
dozens of inquiries began arriving at
the Palo Alto and Stanford Police
I )cpartments. According to Stanford
Police ( aptain Raoul Niemeyer, the
Stanford Police have looked into this
matter "to the best of their ability,
and |we| are satisfied that this is a
non-event."
I he Palo Alto Police Department
was the supposed originator of the
warning, but they issued no such
alert. When they began to receive
complaints, they contacted "intelli
gence people" in East Palo Alto and
the Sheriff's Office before concluding
that the message was a hoax.
The Palo Alto Police said that
they are trying to identify the source
of the hoax, but Detective Jim Coff
man of the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment said so far he has spent most of
his time debunking the e-mail.
The hoax caught many people off

guard because of its unusual nature.
"It's unlike other hoaxes; it's a loeal
hoax. It's not the same as a chain mail
which asks you to forward it. This is
something you would only forward to
people who might be affected," said
Bill Bauriedel, a former security offi
cial for Information Technology Sys
tems and Serv ices.
"It's a first for me," Coffman said.
"I've heard of these hoaxes before."
he added, noting that last year there
was an e-mail that suggested turning
on your high beams on some roads
could be taken as a gang sign.
As for the perpetrators of the
hoax, it is unknown if any legal action

can be taken against them. "I don't
even know if this is a crime. There just
don't seem to be any laws against it."
Niemeyer said.
According to Bauriedel, there is
no penalty for students who forward
ed the message. The message ap
peared completely legitimate, and it
was in the best interests of many stu
dents to pass the information on.
Despite the fact that the message
was a hoax, "it is still a sound message
about safety," Niemeyer said. People
are advised not to leave their cars un
locked when stopping at gas stations
or supermarkets, even if they are only
going to be gone for a few moments.
