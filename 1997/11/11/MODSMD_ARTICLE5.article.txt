## 
### Dan Arnold 
I'lie Ouad, Stanford's yearbook,
eon tin ues to he delayed and criti
cised. Senior I'ony I in, the Quad's
editor Ibr the second year 111 a row,
cited prior debt and mismanagement
as the reason for the delay and said
that the IW7- l )KQuad would not he
affected.
I he IWS-W hook is still being
mailed and the 1 W6- l / 7 yearbook has
not yet been printed.
( hough the Quad lias been in and
out of debt since IWI, according to
I in.the current problems began with
the I W5-% book, edited by Hobby
( hen. ('lass ol H )7. whom he said was
inexperienced.
As well as being 13 months late,
( hen ran up a huge debt. I 111 became,
editor 111 IW6 and was faced with Ihe
problem ol finishing ( hen's book

while starting his own, with very little
money with which to work.
I in was heavily criticized by for
mer photography editor (iarth I'atil.
a senior, for his handling of the IW6-
l ) 7 Ouad. I'atil, who had hoped toedit
the current yearbook, said that while
Lin did save the Ouad financially,
"the method that he took under
mined the ultimate quality of the
book it looks like something that
my high school would have pro
duced."
Lin admitted that the 19%-M7
Quad had to be scaled down but
pointed out that Ihe Quad now has a
$1(),()(X) surplus.
Beginning this May. I'atil began to
meet with Nanci Howe, director of
the Office of Student Activities, to
discuss "a complete overhaul ' ol the
Quad.
Patil felt that there were serious
flaws both in the Quad's governing
document and Lin's management
style, which had resulted in the delays
and the poor quality. In particular
Patil objected to the small number of
people who wrote and took pho
tographs for the 1996-97 Quad and
felt that Lin was trying to do the
whole book by himself. "The book
did not represent the work of a lot of
people," Patil said.
Lin said that there were four pho
tographers, live editors and four or
live contributing stall, though Patil
said that the numbers were much
lower.

Over last summer, Patil wrote and
presented a governing document in
an effort to prevent future problems.
The new constitution created an ad
visory committee to oversee the pro
duction of the Quad and to choose
each year's editor by application.
Under the old constitution, the new
editor was picked only by the former
editor.
Patil. Howe, Lin and ('hen met to
gether in August to discuss the 1997-
98 Quad. At that meeting, Lin decid
ed to reappoint himself, and not Patil,
as editor and then to adopt Patil's
governing document. Lin said, "I re
ally. really wanted to do my senior
year book." He cited Shannon
Resnick's reappointment of herself
in 1992 as a precedent.
According to Patil. the problems
with the 1996-97 management have
not gone away. He believes there are

still very few people working on the
Quad and that little work on this
year's book has been done. "All the
Quad's photographic equipment is in
my possession." Patil said, "and it has
not been touched by anyone."
According to Howe, "The Quad is
now pointing in the right direction."
Although she said there had been
"ineffective management" in the
past, she noted that several of Patil's
ideas would, in fact, be implemented.
Lin, however, was very enthusias
tic about the 1997-98 Quad and said
that it would not be delayed by work
on the 1996-97 yearbook, which is
now completely in the hands of the
printer.
"This year's Quad is well under
way," Lin said, adding that the book
has been redesigned to be larger and
cover more individual students and
groups.
