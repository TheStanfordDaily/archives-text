PEACE CORPS DISCUSSION PANEL
Meet Peace Corps veterans
Craig Carrozzi
and
Eileen Drew
Thursday, November 13
At 4:00 P.M.
What is it really like to be a Peace Corps volunteer? What are
the risk factors involved? These and many other questions
will be discussed by two people who have been there. Their
experiences will give new insights into this very recognizable
organization and address what, if anything, has changed in the
last few years. Craig Carrozzi worked in a juvenile prison and
in the streets of several Colombian cities. He has served as a
Spanish translator for the FBI. His third novel, The Road to
El Dorado, is based on his experiences in Columbia. Eileen
Drew is a child of diplomats and author of the award-winning
collection of stories about Africa, Blue Taxis and the novel
The Ivory Crocodile, which examines the cultural differences
and gross inequalities of power in Africa.
