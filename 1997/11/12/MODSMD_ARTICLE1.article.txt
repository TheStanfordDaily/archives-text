# Admissions officers shed some light on 'mysterious' methods
## 
### Alison MacKinnon Contributing writer 
One of the often-overlooked
questions on Stanford applications
asks, "Have you ever been convict
ed of a criminal offense?"
"It's exciting when someone
checks 'yes,' " joked Holly Thomp
son, senior associate director of ad
missions, speaking to a room of stu
dent affairs staff members at the sec

ond monthly meeting focused issues
in the division.
"The meetings give us an oppor
tunity to focus in on students," ex
plained Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs James Montoya. Each month,
the meeting features a different as
pect of student affairs â€” this time the
undergraduate admissions process.
Montoya emphasized the human
factor present in undergraduate ad
mission decisions.

"We have seen today that it is a
very human process that sets a tone
for all of the work we do in student
affairs," he said.
Montoya jokingly remarked that
there has been an increase in appli
cations since his departure from the
admissions office last summer. He
then introduced Robert kinnally,
the new dean of undergraduate ad
missions and financial aid. who
spoke briefly about Stanford's ad

missions process, acknowledging the
method seems "mysterious to those
not Jirectly connected to it."
Kinnally expressed hope that the
discussion would help other stall
members gain a better understand
ing of the process. Before introduc
ing Thompson, the featured speaker,
Kinnally distributed envelopes to
each member of the audience con
taining four completed Stanford ap
plications so others could see what
successful and unsuccessful appliea
tions look like.
Audience members raised sever
al questions, including the role of
ethnicity and socioeconomic back
ground in considering an applicant.
Thompson said the admissions offi
cers look at what the individual sin
dent has done with his or her avail
able opportunities. She said she was
struck by the number of applicants
who have started out with little
parental encouragement but have
managed to accomplish a great deal
on their own.
Thompson spoke at length about
the admissions process, likening it to
points on a line, hirst, applications are
divided into two groups: competitive
and non-competitive. At this point in
the process, students who arc termed
"clear admits" because of exception
al qualifications are admitted.
Each application in the competi
live group is read in lull detail, and
some are discarded while others re
main for the next round. I his
process is repeated lor another two
rounds, Thompson said.

a "swim round," in which applica
tions that were not found com
pelling at other points in the
process are considered as a group.
Some of these applicants are ad
mitted. depending on how many
places remain in the class. Other
top candidates from the "swim
round" are then put on the wait list.
This is the point at which one
finds the greatest variability,
Thompson said. Some years, 25
percent of "swim kids" may gain
admission, while in other years the
percentage is much smaller.
Thompson then asked the audi
ence to Hip through the applications
and explained the importance of
the essays and recommendations.
She stressed the need for students
to reflect breadth, depth and com
mitment on their application.
