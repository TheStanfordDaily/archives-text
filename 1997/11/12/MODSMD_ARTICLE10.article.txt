### 
WASH INC. lON (AP) — I he
Internal Revenue Service begins
its most visible response to taxpay
er complaints "problem-solving
days" — starting Saturday in 33
cities. The lax agency hopes to
handle at least some problems on
the spot and send a message of a
new commitment to personal
attention.
Citizens can get the ear ol IKS
employees and talk about their lin
gering and unresolved tax prob
lems. which could range from unre
solved bills to errors with payments
or IRS collection tactics.
"Having a national day, it's
almost the equivalent of a military
-stand down," said Phil Hrand. a for
mer IRS chief compliance officer

now at the accounting firm kl'MCi
Peat Marwick. "I think it has a
chance of being almost a seminal
event for the service."
Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence 11. Summers agreed that
beyond tackling taxpayer problems
head-on. the sessions carry symbol
ic weight.
"Over time, problem-solving
days and steps like it. (such as)
strengthening the taxpayer advo
cate. will create an IRS with a dif
ferent culture." Summers said 111 an
interview yesterday.
I he problem solving days also
allow the agency to present itself in
a more positive light, particularly
after Senate hcrrringK into alleged
IRS abuses last September.

" This is our chance to show what
we can do and to tell our own
story," said I - lien Murphy, the IKS
assistant director in Dallas.
Nationwide, the IKS has
received 1,600 calls from taxpayers
inquiring about the problem solv
ing days, said Summers, who over
sees the administration's efforts to
overhaul the IKS. I he IKS urges
people to make appointments
before Saturday so it can research
cases beforehand.
"One of the very encouraging
things is with many of the calls,
there wasn't a need to schedule an
appointment because it was possi
ble to work out the problem right
then and there," Summers said.
I hose without appointments won't

be turned away.
I he IKS plans to hold Saturday
problem solving days each month
m different cities in each of the 33
IKS districts. Senior managers in
those districts will be on hand.
Some districts will have private
accountants or enrolled agents on
hand to offer free taxpayer assis
tanee.
The idea was part of the Clinton
administration's response to the
Senate Finance Committee over
sight hearings into IKS mishandling
of taxpayer cases. At those hear
ings, IKS agents hidden behind
screens leveled allegations of uneth
ical collection practices and abuse
of lower-income taxpayers least
able to defend themselves.
