### 
WASHINGTON (AP) Aim
ing to improve Catholic unity and
penitence, the nation's bishops are
considering a return to meatless Fri
days, a practice that hasn't been
mandatory since the l%()s, except
during I ,ent.
Members of the National Con
ference ol Catholic Bishops Pro-
I ife ('onmiittee, where the propos
al originated, say reinstating meat
less Fridays would give Catholics a
way to publicly display their peni
tence on Fridays the day the
Bible says Jesus suffered and died
on the cross.
"Maybe we need to return to
that, but more broadly, we're
studying the very nature of Friday
as a penitential day and how do we
better call ourselves to observe it,"

says Cardinal Bernard l aw ol
Boston, chairman ol the pro life
committee.
The proposal also is intended lo
be a way for the nation's 61 million
Catholics to express themselves
against abortion, euthanasia, war
violence, drugs and other "attacks
on human life and human dignity."
" The question now is. 'Did we
lose the whole notion ol Friday
being a penitential day?"' I .aw said.
"Our pastoral experience is that
people have tended to lose sight ol it
since the obligation ol abstinence on
Friday was removed."
And there is another question: Is
giving up meat a sufficient sign ol
penitence. "Fish is very good I
have to say that coming from
Boston," says Faw, who abstains

from meat in Ins home on I ridays.

( animal Adam Mania ol I )etroit
says that il the proposal is endorsed,
( atholies might not turn to fish.
"I know people who on their last
days do bread and water," Maida
says. "When I was a child, our staple
on I-'ridays was potato soup and
potati > pancakes."
Bui he savs the proposal is not
just about not eating meat on In
days. Catholic beliefs have become
homogenized into American cul
lure, he said.
