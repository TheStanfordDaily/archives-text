Unabomber trial to begin
SACRAMENTO. Calif. (AP) The cen
terpiece of the Unabomber trial will be the
mind of Theodore Kaczynski. the brilliant boy
who turned into a technology-hating hermit
embittered against everything from planes to
pay phones.
With a mountain of evidence found in his
Montana cabin pointing to him as the
Unabomber. the trial that begins with jury
selection today will focus on whether Kaczyns
ki was a man with a "mental defect." not
responsible lor his actions, or prove that he's a
rational, cold-blooded killer.
Kaczynski's own letters and journals pro
vide the raw material for both sides.
One item, a letter in which Kaczynski wrote,
"I can't wait until you die so I can spit on your
corpse," suggests that the veneer of a socially
concerned viuilante could well have masked
childhood hatreds looking for an outlet, said
Dr. Eugene Schoenfeld. a psychiatrist and
forensic consultant.
" There's a lot rage building up in this guv."
he said. "And people will rationalize anger and
violence through a cause a greater good that
justifies destruction and murder.'
In the Sacramento case. Kaczynski is
charged with bombings that killed two and
maimed two. Separately in New Jersey, he's

charged in one death.
In all, the government laims Kaczynski is
behind 16 bombings that killed three people
and injured 23 over IK years.
No longer the scruffy, wide-eyed mountain
man arrested in April 19%, Kaczynski now
appears in court wearing a tweed sports jacket
with his hair and beard trimmed, looking every
bit the professor he once was.
That courtroom image is more in keeping
with the bright young boy whose mother read
him Scientific American on their porch in
Evergreen Park, 111. But his mother, Wanda,
has said she believes her son's problems began
shortly after his birth.
At () months, Kaczynski was hospitalized
with a d. • ig reaction. I le was forcibly pinned to
a bed for a week, and lay virtually untouched
by human hands. His mother says Kaczynski
came home listless, and believes her son was
never the same.
