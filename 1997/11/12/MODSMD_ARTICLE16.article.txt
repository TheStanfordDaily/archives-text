Stanford Police iniative
will lead to crack-down
on cycling violations

Because STANF()RD'S VERDANT
and beautiful campus is also quite
immense, many students use bicy
cles to cut down on lengthy commutes on
foot.
Thus, the bicycle has almost become a
requisite for life on The Farm; an ingrained
part of Stanford culture almost as Ã¼biqui
tous iis the bike racks that front virtually
every building.
Unfortunately, good biking habits are
not nearly as prevalent among those who
choose this method of transportation. Poor
habits run the gamut from a lack of com
mon courtesy when parking bikes to lack of
respect for the rules of the road.
The lack of common courtesy is most
visible in the parking habits of some cyclists.
Students, especially when running late to
class, tend to park their bicycles anywhere,
often blocking access for the disabled.
It's nice to park as close as possible to
the door, but is saving 30 seconds for your
self really worth causing a major headache
for another? This situation is easy to reme
dy. It is about acting with respect and
decency, and perhaps allowing an extra
minute or two in your schedule so that you
arrive at your destination with enough time
to park your bike properly.
What is equally flagrant is the lack of
respect for or knowledge of the various
laws that cyclists must follow. Inside the
bollards, chaos often rules. Hut outside the
bollards, bicycles are vehicles and must fol
low the same basic rules that cars and other
vehicles do when they are on the road.
There are five especially egregious viola

tions that occur daily at Stanford:
1) Cycle on roads, not sidewalks. Bicy
cles arc vehicles and vehicles belong on
roads, not sidewalks. Keep in mind that it is
illegal to ride a bicycle on a sidewalk; that is
why bicycle lanes have been created on the
street.
2) Stop at stop signs. As mentioned
above, bicycles are vehicles and are there
fore subject to all of the rules of the road.
3) I Jse a bike light at night. This is vital
ly important if you do not want to be
smeared across the pavement by a car. It
you've ever driven in a car on this campus
at night, you know how hard it is to see
cyclists who don't have bike lights. It's also
the law.
4) When you turn, indicate your inten
tion to do so with a turn signal. Once again
this is about following the rules of the road.
5) Register your bicycle. This is impor
tant in case it is ever stolen. Keep in mind
bicycle theft is the most common crime on
campus. In addition, it's the law.
In an effort to remedy this situation, the
Stanford Police Department has added
police on bicycles to its routine patrols. As
a result of this action, bicycle laws will be
more closely enforced and response time to
crimes will become faster.
We congratulate Police Deputy Laura
Wilson for proposing the idea and to the
Police Department for implementing the
proposal.
Currently the police are only issuing
warnings to errant cyclists, but soon they
will be issuing tickets. So now is the time to
commence mending your ways.
So stop at those stop signs, use a bike
light after dark and show some basic cour
tesy to both those who cycle and those who
do not. You should follow these basic rules
because common sense suggests that this is
the intelligent and decent thing to do. You
should also do it because now the Stanford
Police are watching.
