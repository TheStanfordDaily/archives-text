## Marijuana: You make the call 
### 
Last week, our
fair university host
ed a conference on
the state of the war on
drugs in the United
States. During the pro
ceedings, economist Mil
ton Friedman and former
Secretary of State George

Shultz argued that the war had failed miser
ably.
This should come as no surprise. Fried
man and Shultz have been saying these
things for years.
All too often, we see people's opinions
on the war on drugs without exploring the
hard facts behind those opinions.
Enough is enough. Below is a scattering
of facts culled from articles and government
reports (references provided on request).
Much of what you are about to read is due
to the hard work of Prof. Charles White
bread. Dr. Thomas Szasz and Eric Schlosser.
Consider marijuana.
According to a Justice Department
study, average punishment for a violent
offender in the US in 1992 was 43 months in
prison, as compared to 50 months for mari
juana offenses.
According to the Justice Department,
there were 600,000 marijuana-related arrests
in I lie United States in 1995, more than ever
before.
More people are in jail for marijuana
offenses than for manslaughter or rape.
No fewer than 15 states now require life
sentences for some nonviolent marijuana
offenses.
What good has all this enforcement done?
Since 1992. teenage marijuana use in the
United States has doubled.

In comparison, between 1979 and pas
sage of stringent federal laws in 1986,
teenage marijuana use dropped 4() percent.
How feasible is this methodology in the
long term ?
Almost 60 percent of current Federal
prisoners are drug offenders.
Incarceration of all the people who use
illegal drugs would require construction of a
prison that could hold the combined popula
tions of California, Arizona and New Mexi
co.
What are the negative'side effects of the
war on drugs?
Nearly $1.5 billion of property was seized
in 1994 under state and federal drug laws. In
80 percent of these cafcesfowners were never
charged with crimes^
There ate cases where entire /arms have
been seized based on finding a single mari
juana plant.
Justice Department officials have admit
ted that raids are often intended more to
meet yearly budget projections than to
enforce laws.
Around 12 percent of the people
involved with illegal drugs are black.
Around 44 percent of those arrested for
possession of illegal drugs and 57 percent ol
those arrested for drug sales are black. If
these trends continue until the year 2000,
nearly half of all black men in America will
have gone to prison, mostly for non-violent
drug charges.
How dangerous are illegal drugs?
Consumption of illegal drugs kills about
4,5(X) people per year, around one percent of
the number killed by consumption of alco
hol and tobacco.
How are the laws determined?
Marijuana was made illegal in 1937.

Hearings regarding the bill lasted two
hours. Testimony against marijuana was
essentially a single statement by the director
of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, who
said "Marihuana is an addictive drug which
produces in its users insanity, criminality
and death."
The Chief Counsel to the American
Medical Association then testified that the
AMA had no knowledge of marijuana being
dangerous or addictive. After hounding the
Counsel for a few minutes, the committee
dismissed him for wasting Congress' time.
After the hearings, Congress quickly
passed the bill — due, in no little part, to the
committee's interpretation of the Counsel s
remarks as "100 percent support" for the
bill.
Things haven't improved much since.
According to an assistant Congressional
counsel, the drug quantities now in use for
determining when federal minimum sen
tencing applies were chosen "out of thin
air."
Here 's one last fact for good measure.
It is against the law for a producer of pre
scription drugs to describe the said drugs in
terms that are accessible to the layperson.
The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
states that indicators for prescription drugs
must be presented "only in such medical
terms as are not likely to be understood by
the ordinary individual."
Hope this helps you think about your
opinion.
