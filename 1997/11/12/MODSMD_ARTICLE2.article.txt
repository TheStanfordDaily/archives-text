# Grad student okay after car blows up
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Editorial staff 
When Wendell Pascual turned
the ignition key in his car Saturday
night, it exploded into flames.
Pascual, visiting from Eos Ange
les, was sitting in the car with his
friend. Dawn Mabalon. a Stanford
doctoral student, outside Ma
balon's apartment in San Francis
co's Haight-Ashbury neighbor
hood.
The location seemed innocent
enough, but the car was parked
above a gas leak emanating from
pipes underground. The gas drifted
up through a manhole into Ma
balon'scar.
"Flames were coming out of both
sides of the car." Mabalon said. "I
was running and screaming for some
one to call 911. The boom from the
explosion was so loud that my neigh
bors thought it was an earthquake."
Flames from the car reached 10 to
15 feet in height, according to wit
nesses.
Mabalon and Pascual suffered
minor burns, scrapes and bruises,
and the explosion burned off much
of their eyebrows, eyelashes and
hair. They were treated at the scene
of the accident by paramedics and
went to Saint Mary's Hospital in San
Francisco for follow-up appoint
ments on Monday.
Judy Peterson, a spokeswoman
for Pacific Gas & Electric Co., said
an investigation into the accident in
still in progress. Preliminary find
ings. however, indicate that the
leak was created when crews plac
ing a new gas line in October at
tached a new pipe to an abandoned
pipeline.

Mabalon got to the Hay Area in
September to begin classes as a first
year doctoral student in history. She
said she now feels frightened and iso
lated in her new home.
Mabalon, who received her mas
ter's in American history from
UCLA, added the accident has
added to the usual strain caused by
the typical doctoral student work
load.
"It's hard because I'm in the mid
dle of my most intensive program at
Stanford," Mabalon said. "The pro
gram itself is stressful enough."
Mabalon has missed class all this
week, although she hopes to get back
to classes by Friday. In addition to
the practical problem of not having a
car. Mabalon said she also is emo
tionally vulnerable because of the
accident. PG&E recently provided
Mabalon with a rental car, but she
said that since the accident, her fear
of driving has made it difficult for her
to be in the car.
According to Peterson, PG&E's
Safety, Health and Claims Depart
ments have been in contact with the
victims. Mabalon said PG&E has ac
cepted liability for the accident;
meanwhile, she has contacted a
lawyer.
PG&E currently believes no fur
ther damage is posed by the leak. The
leak. Peterson said, is being "watched
very carefully," and the gas is being al
lowed to vent into the atmosphere.
However. Mabalon said she is
worried thai PG&E has not put up
any signs in the neighborhood to in
form people about the accident. Al
though the manhole from which the
gas is leaking is blocked off. Mabalon
said people are still parking near the
accident site.
