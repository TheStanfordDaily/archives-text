Punish e-mail senders
As the person who personally phoned
the police to verify whether there was any
truth to thee mail message distributed on
Friday. I am appalled at the review you give
of it in your paper.
I was entirely responsible for draw ing to
the attention of the police the nature of
this misinformation. I spent much of the
day arguing with the originator(s) of the
message and posting to various lists in
order to alert people to what 1 knew to be
a hoax.
I was also the person, who in the late
afternoon, sent a campus-wide message to
officially contradict the misinformation.
I was immediately suspicious of the e
mail's content, and I can't imagine that any
one with an intellect would not have also
been suspicious.
In the past the police and others have
issued formal warnings, and they read very
differently. The alleged purpose of this mes
sage was to warn women (and men) of an
alleged danger in the vicinity. However, its
alarmist tone, its sexism and its OVFR 11 Y

racist content meant that it offended almost
all the people to whom it was directed. (I
am aware that in some cases, the racist tone
was edited, though this was not frequently
done).
This is quite clearly an ineffective
approach in alerting a campus to a particu
lar concern. The only people who were gen
erally not offended by the content were
white males.
Thus, the question of whether or not
such messages in the future should be dis
tributed. regardless of whether they hold
such overtly offensive views, in the interest
of security, is a mute point. They are entire
ly unsuccessful in their intent. It is quite
clear that there is no point in sending such a
message out.
The SUPD spent most of their day
researching the allegations and wasting
their time. Women and men phoned them
all day long, and they were unable to offer a
conclusive answer until the late afternoon
when their investigation was complete.
Thus. I turn to the question of whether
or not such action is a crime or offense. It is
both. It is a criminal offense to waste police

time. It is a criminal offense to cause undue
panic and alarm. It contravenes the Honor
Code to distribute (not simply write, hut
disseminate) messages that are offensive
racist, sexist, alarmist or otherwise.
As to the opinion of Mr. Bauriedel. 1
think this matter needs to go before the
Dean of Students for adjudication. For the
reasons stated above it clearly DOES con
travene the Honor Code.
I was not aware that a former security
officer for Information Technology Systems
and Services had the power to make deci
sions about the applicability of the Honor
Code. 1 happen to know that there are
many more suitable authorities from whom
The Daily could have taken a statement.
For all of the above reasons the initial
senders of this message to lists, can, and in
my view, ought to be punished appropriate
ly*
I hope this message clears up some con
fusion and inaccuracy in your Tuesday arti
cle.

I am writing in regards to the Thurs
day. Nov. 6 edition of The Stanford
Daily. On the front page, you featured a
black junior. Adeh de Sandies, doing
what looked like somersaulting or break
dancing. Above the photograph is a state
ment "Great God Almighty. I'm free at
last."
I cannot believe that you would take a
statement that has such strong historical
and cultural implications, and use it in
such a jovial manner.
When the late Dr. King coined this
phrase in his 1960s speech, he was speak
ing about the end of oppression, racism.
Jim Crow laws, as well as other injustices.
And I know that as an educated staff,
you completely understand the meaning
behind this phrase.
This is why the fact that you used it to
celebrate the end of something as trivial as
mid-terms appalled me.
Though I do not work with you at The
Daily. I know that every issue of newspa
per must go through various checks

before it is ready for print. The fact that it
went through all these different checks
and no one stopped this distasteful cap
tion from going to print really bothers
me.
It scares me that even here, at Stanford,
an institution that prides itself for compil
ing a group of some of the most intelligent
and enlightened young people in this
country, we still have a mentality that per
mits such ignorant, racial innuendoes to
slip through the cracks.
Though I realize that in all likeli
hood. you did not fully comprehend the
implications of this caption, it does not
take away from the fact that you have
deeply offended not only myself, but a
large portion of the black community as
well.
1 hope that in future issues, you re-eval
uate your line of thinking and deeply con
sider the possible effects your statements
might have on all members of the Stanford
community.
