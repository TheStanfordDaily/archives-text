# Foreign Bureau: Berlin
## Marni Leff Confronting the lessons of history 
### 
WHEN I ARRIVED at Sachsen
hausen, a former concentration
camp just outside of Berlin last
Friday morning, I paused for a moment
before entering. An irrepressible urge
struck me to turn around and run.
As 1 stood outside the camp. 1 could see
trees neatly lined up along a road that lead
into the camp. From my vantage point, the
trees obstructed the watch towers, bar
racks and barbed-wire fences. They
blocked my view of the remains of the cre
matorium and the pits where the Na/is
piled prisoners before shooting them.
Yellow and orange leaves covered the
ground and as I looked away from the
camp 1 realized that no more than a few
hundred feet separated it from homes in
the neighboring community. An eerie
silence lurked. I walked through the gates
and into the camp. I studied the trees,
angry that a place that had witnessed such
atrocities was so calm, and.in an odd way.
almost beautiful.
Again I thought about bolting.
Instead I remembered a talk I'd heard
this summer. A survivor and volunteer at

the Holocaust Memorial Museum in
Washington, D.C. spoke about her life as a
prisoner at Auschwitz and her subsequent
trips back to the concentration camp.
Someone asked her how she could
work at the museum and how she could
return to Auschwitz. She told us that when
her transport arrived at Auschwitz and the
Nazis made the first selection sending
those they deemed "too weak" to the gas
chambers, she remembered hearing them
screaming, begging not to be forgotten.
She answered, "How could I not?"
Her reply has haunted me since then,
hut at the same time it makes sense. As the
museum's mission proclaims. "For the
dead and the liv ing we must bear witness."
Living in Berlin, I have come to fully
appreciate the importance of bearing wit
ness. In 1933, with 160,564 Jewish resi
dents, Berlin was home to Europe's third
largest Jewish community. Before the war
about 600,000 Jews lived in Germany. I lie
World Jewish Congress found in a recent
census that about 60,000 Jews presently
live in (iermany.
But sadly, my visit to Sachsenhausen

was not just about remembering the past.
Originally built to contain foreign and
political prisoners only about 10,000 to
20,000 of Sachsenhausen's 204,000 prison
ers were Jews. The Na/is treated the Jew
ish prisoners more brutally than the others
and confined them to their own barracks.
On Sept. 25. IW2, Neo-Nazis set fire to
two of those barracks, 10 days after then
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had
toured the camp, Rabin had visited a
memorial at the camp and an exhibit
inside a barrack formerly used for Jewish
prisoners. Many think the fire was a form
of retaliation against Rabin's visit.
Regardless, it was most certainly an
attempt to obliterate the memory Sach
senhausen's Jews.
Sunday marked the completion of a $2.5
million restoration of the burned barracks,
including a small museum detailing the Ins
tory of' Jews in Sachsenhausen. I visited the
concentration camp on Friday afternoon to
attend a press conference about Sunday's
ceremonial opening of the new museum.
As I rode the train toward Sachsen
hausen Sunday morning for the ceremony.

I couldn't help but he struck by the bitter
irony of my journey. More than 50 years
ago many of Berlin's Jews rode down
those very same tracks. SS men and Na/is
packed them into cattle cars, while point
ing riffle butts at their heads.
Sixty of those former inmates attended
the ceremony on Sunday afternoon. l\vo
of them addressed the group, others just
came to observe. I'wo older men were
seated in front ol me. both wearing special
name badges over their hearts, in place of
the red and yellow star that had once
branded them as Jewish prisoners.
The two men stood on their chairs sev
eral times during the ceremony video cam
eras held high, carefully recording every
thing that happened. One of the men
turned around three or four times to film
the crowd. I had the distinct feeling that he
liist wanted a tangible record of all in
attendance.
Several important (ierman dignitaries
spoke, among them Manfred (arstens, a
senior official in the (ierman Interior Min
isti \ ( arstens spoke on behalf of the federal
government, and he gave a speech that pro

voked angry jeers and boos from the crowd.
Choosing, to t.ilk about the Nazis'
wartime crimes, Carstens ignored the
burning of the barracks in thus miss
ing the point ol the entire ceremony.
1 he generation of Holocaust victims
who survived is growing older and dying.
is the generation of perpetrators.
Although the original perpetrators will
soon be gone, unfortunately ;i younger
generation has taken over and the Nazi's
cause lives on. It is now our generation's
turn to keep the "never again - ' vow sacred.
That's why as much as I wanted to. I did
not run away.
At Sachsenhausen last weekend, 1
joined others in saying kaddish. the Jew
ish prayer of mourning for the dead. Yet
being there meant much more to me than
just bearing witness to crimes of genera
tions past; it meant bearing witness m the
present and promising to continue to bear
witness in the future.
