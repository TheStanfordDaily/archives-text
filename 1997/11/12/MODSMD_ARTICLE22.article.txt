.A. -M-keep silent
when his students are
beaten, arrested and con
victed only because they
want to study in their
mother tongue?"
I remembered t lie-

words of Professor Ejup Statovci, rector of
the University of Prishtina, when the press
reported student demonstrations in Koso
vo last month.
Did he know when we talked last spring
in his tiny office in a private house in
Prishtina that he would be among those
who were beaten and arrested just four
months later?
Much earlier, however, Statovci made
his decision, choosing to continue his work
as a rector of a university, which had not
existed since 1991. And he had paid for it.
Serbian authorities previously sent him to
prison twice because of his determination
to demand Albanian language instruction
in Kosovo.
The second time Statovci was convicted
only because he dared to write an official
letter to Serbian President Slobodan Milo
sevic. pleading for returning the university
buildings to the Albanian students.
Almost seven years ago. 1.000 Albanian
professors and 27,000 Albanian students
were expelled from university buildings by
a Serbian police force. This resulted from
compulsory emergency measures taken by
the Serbian government in June 1991.
Teaching in the Albanian language was
lorbidden in every school in Kosovo,
including the University of Prishtina. What
was formerly the only bilingual university
in the former Yugoslavia, the University of
Prishtina was established in 1970 in order
to educate the children of about three mil
lion Albanians living in Kosovo, Macedo
nia, Montenegro and Serbia. Today it is
accessible only to the lew Serbian and
Montenegrin students in the province.
Serbia did not want to lose Kosovo
when the Yugoslav Federation fell apart.
Through changes in the Yugoslav Consti-

tution, Slobodan Milosevic managed to
retain Kosovo within Serbian borders,
abolishing the region's autonomy in 1990.
Kosovo, where 92 percent of the popu
lation is ethnically Albanian, became a
province under Serbian military control.
Seven years is a long time. Long enough
lor a child to be born and to learn how to
walk, speak, read and write. Albanian stu
dents learned how to resist. Peaceful resis
tance became the philosophy of Kosovar
society.
Kosovars have completely boycotted
Serbian authorities â€” for seven years they
have not participated in any Serbian elec
tions, Albanians have not worked for the
local governments and their children have
not attended public schools because class
room instruction is given in Serbian.
Kosovar Albanians have created a
shadow-state in the state of Serbia since
the formal declaration of Kosovo's inde
pendence in September 1991.
The shadow-structures have been so
well organized that they probably could
become effective state institutions immedi
ately il Kosovo were to gain sovereignty.
The shadow-state has been led by Presi
dent Ibrahim Rugova and ruled by a gov
erning party, the Democratic League of
Kosovo, which is opposed by the Parlia
mentary Party of Kosovo. Seven seats in
the shadow-Parliament have been
reserved for Serbs and Montenegrins
(together constituting eight percent of
Kosovo's population) in case they want to
join the institutions, created by Albanians.
The shadow society has established a
shadow-Financial Council, which collects
money for alternative educational institu
tions, justice organs, health-care facilities,
welfare and cultural activities. The Finan
cial Council provides money for 25,000
teachers in primary and secondary schools
and for the University of Prishtina. All
these institutions, in every town and village
in Kosovo, are located in private homes in
spaces donated by citizens.
Even the huge University of Prishtina
with its 17.000 students and 1,000 profes
sors has functioned in a number of private

houses and despite poor conditions has
offered every possible level of education.
After having received much interna
tional pressure last year ex-Serbian, now
Yugoslavian, President Slobodan Milose
vic signed with Kosovar President Rugova
an agreement to restore Albanian educa
tion in Kosovo, but it has yet to be imple
mented.
However, the Serbian government's
reluctance to re-establish education in
Albanian was not the only reason for
bringing about student protests in Octo
ber. An even more important motive was
the persistent Serbian police terror. Stu
dents have often been objects of police
brutality during the last several years, since
Albanians were deprived of university
premises.
"Leaving for school in the morning we
never know whether we will come back
home or not," said the students from
Prishtina. Many of their friends and col
leagues have experienced cruel treatment
at police stations or in prisons. Some have
never come back. The number of murders
in police stations has been increasing every
year. The local human rights organizations
reported that at least 20 Albanians were
killed by the police this year.
Last spring a group of young people was
accused of terrorist actions and sentenced
to 10 or more years in prison. And last
week, the Serbian regime started a new
trial against 19 young Albanians for sepa
ratism. terrorism and attempts to under
mine Serbian power. This is the third such
trial this year.
I he Kosovar political leaders consider
the police brutality directed at young peo
ple to be part ol Milosevic's deliberate pol
icy of ethnic cleansing. The military terror
in Kosovo drove away hundreds of thou
sands Albanians, who now live abroad.
Despite the number of young people leav
ing the country every year, the Albanians
in Kosovo are still the youngest population
in Europe: about SO percent are under 30
years of age.
During the last several years the out
rage and anger at Belgrade's policy of ter-

ror and discrimination have been growing
among young people, although they have
continued to resist peacefully. However,
recently they have become frustrated with
peaceful resistance and now many Albani
ans, as well as some political leaders, insist
on a more radical strategy of resistance in
order to attain Kosovo's independence.
Now students in Prishtina demonstrate
against the apartheid in education, which
has taken place in the Balkans against one
of the region's oldest ethnic groups. They
started peaceful protests on Oct. 1, but
faced police attacks, tear gas and arrests.
At least 100 students were injured and
many were detained by the Serbian police.
According to the press, among those
arrested were Statovci and the Vice-Rec
tor Ahmet Geca.
After the violence against students, the
tensions between Serbian authorities and
the Albanians escalated. As a result sever
al young Albanians were tortured and at
least one died in prison, and several explo
sions in Serb residences followed

the student demonstrations. Ser
bian police were accused of terror
izing some clandestine Albanian
radical groups, but the Albanians
remained convinced that the Ser
bian secret services conducted the
terrorist actions.
Meanwhile, no progress has
been made in negotiations with
Belgrade to end apartheid in the
university and other educational
institutions in Kosovo.
Last week the demonstrations
started again. And the police once
again blocked the towns in Koso
vo. There were no reported inci
dents in Prishtina, but the police
ended the peaceful protest in Fer
izaj, detained number of students
in Peja and Podujeva and beat a
lot of young people in Prizren.
Obviously this time the Serbian
regime somewhat decentralized
the attack against students, avoid
ing violence in the provincial capi
tal, where foreign diplomats and

international organizations have observed
such rallies in the past. But in small towns
the Serbian regime again showed its truly
inhuman face by sending riot police
against its own citizens.
Nevertheless, the students do not seem
frightened by the violence. "We will never
give up our demands," declared the leader
of the Students Union. Bujar Dugolli.
before 15,00() demonstrators in Prishtina
last Wednesday.
It is possible for the Albanian students
to choose another, more radical, way to
achieve their goals if the Serbian govern
ment continues to reject reintegration of
Albanians pupils into the state school sys
tem.
For the time being, nobody can predict
peace in Kosovo.
