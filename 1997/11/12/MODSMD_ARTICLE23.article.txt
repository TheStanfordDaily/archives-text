Scientist hopes to ascertain how tumors form

An almost omnipresent aspect of modern life,
cancer has been likened to a deadly plague that grad
ually spreads throughout the body. Indeed, countless
numbers of researchers dedicate their lives to the
study of cancer. Amato Giaccia, a professor of radia
tion oncology at the Medical School, is interested in
studying the tumor microenvironment and the for-

mation of cancer cells in tumor tissue.
Typically, a solid tumor develops from the presence of certain cell
types. A normal cell must mutate a total of six times before becoming
cancerous and spawning tumor formation. Some cells mutate four or
live times whereas other cells produce multiple clones with all six
mutations. Giaccia is attempting to determine whether the mutation
process is a result of statistical or random probability or if the muta
tions provide some sort of biological advantage.
In hopes of better understanding cancer processes. Giaccia is also
studying specific events in tumors. In particular. Giaccia's interest lies
in the early stages of tumor formation. His project compares tumor
development and the developmental events in embryogenesis. Giaccia
hopes to determine whether or not the tumor events are actually
uncontrolled parodies of normal regulated processes in the earliest
stages of life, the embryonic stage.
New Web page helps match protein sequences

From its basic roots as a tool for scientific endeavor,
the Internet as an entertainment utility has blossomed
and has come to span the entire world. Douglas Brut
lag, a professor of biochemistry, and a team of
researchers has brought the Internet back to its most
fundamental roots — as a scientific research tool.
Brutlag has just completed a project to create a

World Wide Web page, appropriately titled "Identify," for the pur
pose of identifying protein sequences. In essence, this web page beats
conventional methods in accuracy, simplicity and speed. If given an
unidentified protein sequence, a relative neophyte using the Web page
could produce results comparable to that of an experienced bio
chemist.
"Identify" works by first prompting the user for a protein sequence.
Then, the program taps into an extensive database with more than
5().(H)() sequence motifs. With a sort of tree-structure refining method,
the program attempts to line up the protein with these motifs in search
of a consensus sequence. The program uses a new way of matching
sequence motifs that is analogous to matching words instead of char
acters. Only homologous proteins share these motifs.
"Identify" has important implications for the Genome Project,
which aims to sequence the entire human genome. The program might
eventually be capable of searching the entire genome without return
ing any false positives. In addition, the program can identify the func
tion of all genes in a certain genome. The Web page can be found at
