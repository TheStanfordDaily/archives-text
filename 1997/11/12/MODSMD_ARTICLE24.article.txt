# Stereotactic radiosurgery:
## New method used to destroy tumors 
### Lynne Mercer 
Imagine being told that you have
a brain tumor and that the only
treatment available is surgery. It is a
terrifying prospect and not without
considerable risk. The risk is signif
icantly greater, however, if the
tumor is at the base of the skull,
where critical blood vessels and cra
nial nerves enter and leave the
brain. I Jntil fairly recently, no effec
tive alternative treatments for such
patients existed, but neurosurgeons
at the Stanford Medical Center
have been working to change that.
In a paper published in the
November issue of neurosurgery,
Steven Chang, a neurosurgery resi
dent, and John Adler, associate
professor of Neurosurgery, report
that patients with skull base menin
giomas can be successfully treated
with a noninvasive procedure called
stereotactic radiosurgery.
Meningioma is a tumor that
develops from the meninges, the
membranes that cover the brain.
"They are the third most common
brain tumor, after metastatic
tumors and glioblastomas," said
Chang. Although they are usually
benign, the tumors can grow to a
large size and put pressure on the
brain. Neurological symptoms and
even death may result.
According to Chang, about 60
percent of meningiomas occur on
top of the brain. "If the surgeon can
[remove] the entire tumor, the
patient is cured," he said. "But 25
percent occur along the base of the
skull."
If the tumor has infiltrated into
the base of the skull, surgery is diffi
cult i)r impossible. liven if the sur
geon gets most of the tumor, he can
injure nerves or the carotid artery,
the main artery that supplies blood
to the brain. Injury to the carotid
artery can cause a stroke.
"In these cases, most neurosur
geons elect to remove as much of
the tumor as possible and then fol
low the patients," said Chang. "The
tumors invariably grow back, and
the patient has to endure another

surgery. I his will continue, so lliat
some patients end up having sever
al high risk surgeries over a period
of years."
These patients are prime eatidi
dates lor stereotactic radiosurgery.
I lie technique can also be used as
the initial treatment on patients

with small meningiomas, who are
thus spared surgery entirely.
With conventional, or fractional
ed radiation therapy, small doses ol
radiation are delivered each day to
a large area for example, the
entire head. Stereotactic radio
surgery, on the other hand, uses 3 I)

computer targeting lo concentrate
a single, large dose of a highly
focused beam ol radiation dircctK
onto the tumor. I lie Stanford

radiation treatments.
There are significant advantages
to using radiosurgery. Not only is
the patient spared the ordeal of a
difficult and risky surgery, but the
treatment is delivered in a single
dose in an outpatient setting over a
period of about a half hour.
In addition, there is minimal
radiation to surrounding normal
tissue. The beam can target an area
as small as smm, with a margin of
error of o.3mm. Nerves and blood
vessels in a small halo immediately

adjacent to the tumor may be dam
aged, producing symptoms similar
to those the tumor would have
caused. Hut, they are fairly resis
tant to radiation. According to
C hang, there is only about a three
percent risk of radiation injury to
the brain using this technique, with
zero percent procedure mortality.
1 his is opposed to conventional
surgery, where there is a 10 percent
mortality rate and a 30 percent
morbidity rate for skull base
meningiomas.
"The goal in treating benign
tumors." said Chang, "should be to
make available to the patient a
treatment combination that leads to
the best result with the least risk."

In their study of 55 patients, 10
experienced transient neurological
damage and only two suffered per
manent nerve damage. After four
years of follow up, only one tumor
appeared larger on follow-up MRI
scans of the brain.
In addition to treating menin
giomas, radiosurgery can be used
for metastatic malignant brain
tumors, malignant glial cell tumors
and vascular malformations. "Any
tumor in the brain could be treated
with this technology," said Chang.
"The major limitation is size."
When large tumors press on the
brain, surgery becomes the pre
ferred option, providing immediate
relief. With radiosurgery, on the

other hand, results may not be evi
dent for several months.
Stereotactic radiosurgery does
have one major drawback in that
the targeted area must be absolute
ly immobile. For that reason, it is
not suitable for treatment of soft tis
sue tumors. Hut another type of
radiation device being developed
exclusively at Stanford does not
require rigid head fixation. The
Cyberknife, as the new device is
called, tracks and makes real time
adjustments to body movement.
The result is less patient discomfort,
and it can be used more easily on
young children, who frequently
must be subjected to general anes
thesia when current radiosurgery

techniques are used.
Because the Cyberknife has not
yet received FDA approval, its use
is generally restricted to treatment
of malignant brain tumors and
benign spinal lesions. But it has
the potential to be used to treat
tumors throughout the body.
•'Neurosurgeons at Stanford have
used it to treat neck tumors," said
Chang, "and software is currently
being developed for Cyberknife
treatment of lung and prostate
tumors."
The device has been submitted
for FDA approval, and clinical
testing has begun at several other
facilities in both United States and
Japan.

as small as smm, with a margin of
error of o.3mm. Nerves and blood
vessels in a small halo immediately

adjacent to the tumor may be dam
aged, producing symptoms similar
to those the tumor would have
caused. Hut, they are fairly resis
tant to radiation. According to
C hang, there is only about a three
percent risk of radiation injury to
the brain using this technique, with
zero percent procedure mortality.
1 his is opposed to conventional
surgery, where there is a 10 percent
mortality rate and a 30 percent
morbidity rate for skull base
meningiomas.
"The goal in treating benign
tumors." said Chang, "should be to
make available to the patient a
treatment combination that leads to
the best result with the least risk."

In their study of 55 patients, 10
experienced transient neurological
damage and only two suffered per
manent nerve damage. After four
years of follow up, only one tumor
appeared larger on follow-up MRI
scans of the brain.
In addition to treating menin
giomas, radiosurgery can be used
for metastatic malignant brain
tumors, malignant glial cell tumors
and vascular malformations. "Any
tumor in the brain could be treated
with this technology," said Chang.
"The major limitation is size."
When large tumors press on the
brain, surgery becomes the pre
ferred option, providing immediate
relief. With radiosurgery, on the

other hand, results may not be evi
dent for several months.
Stereotactic radiosurgery does
have one major drawback in that
the targeted area must be absolute
ly immobile. For that reason, it is
not suitable for treatment of soft tis
sue tumors. Hut another type of
radiation device being developed
exclusively at Stanford does not
require rigid head fixation. The
Cyberknife, as the new device is
called, tracks and makes real time
adjustments to body movement.
The result is less patient discomfort,
and it can be used more easily on
young children, who frequently
must be subjected to general anes
thesia when current radiosurgery

techniques are used.
Because the Cyberknife has not
yet received FDA approval, its use
is generally restricted to treatment
of malignant brain tumors and
benign spinal lesions. But it has
the potential to be used to treat
tumors throughout the body.
•'Neurosurgeons at Stanford have
used it to treat neck tumors," said
Chang, "and software is currently
being developed for Cyberknife
treatment of lung and prostate
tumors."
The device has been submitted
for FDA approval, and clinical
testing has begun at several other
facilities in both United States and
Japan.
