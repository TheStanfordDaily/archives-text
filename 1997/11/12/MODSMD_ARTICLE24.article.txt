# Stereotactic radiosurgery:
## New method used to destroy tumors 
### Lynne Mercer 
Imagine being told that you have
a brain tumor and that the only
treatment available is surgery. It is a
terrifying prospect and not without
considerable risk. The risk is signif
icantly greater, however, if the
tumor is at the base of the skull,
where critical blood vessels and cra
nial nerves enter and leave the
brain. I Jntil fairly recently, no effec
tive alternative treatments for such
patients existed, but neurosurgeons
at the Stanford Medical Center
have been working to change that.
In a paper published in the
November issue of neurosurgery,
Steven Chang, a neurosurgery resi
dent, and John Adler, associate
professor of Neurosurgery, report
that patients with skull base menin
giomas can be successfully treated
with a noninvasive procedure called
stereotactic radiosurgery.
Meningioma is a tumor that
develops from the meninges, the
membranes that cover the brain.
"They are the third most common
brain tumor, after metastatic
tumors and glioblastomas," said
Chang. Although they are usually
benign, the tumors can grow to a
large size and put pressure on the
brain. Neurological symptoms and
even death may result.
According to Chang, about 60
percent of meningiomas occur on
top of the brain. "If the surgeon can
[remove] the entire tumor, the
patient is cured," he said. "But 25
percent occur along the base of the
skull."
If the tumor has infiltrated into
the base of the skull, surgery is diffi
cult i)r impossible. liven if the sur
geon gets most of the tumor, he can
injure nerves or the carotid artery,
the main artery that supplies blood
to the brain. Injury to the carotid
artery can cause a stroke.
"In these cases, most neurosur
geons elect to remove as much of
the tumor as possible and then fol
low the patients," said Chang. "The
tumors invariably grow back, and
the patient has to endure another

surgery. I his will continue, so lliat
some patients end up having sever
al high risk surgeries over a period
of years."
These patients are prime eatidi
dates lor stereotactic radiosurgery.
I lie technique can also be used as
the initial treatment on patients

with small meningiomas, who are
thus spared surgery entirely.
With conventional, or fractional
ed radiation therapy, small doses ol
radiation are delivered each day to
a large area for example, the
entire head. Stereotactic radio
surgery, on the other hand, uses 3 I)

computer targeting lo concentrate
a single, large dose of a highly
focused beam ol radiation dircctK
onto the tumor. I lie Stanford
group uses a I INA( machine, :i
