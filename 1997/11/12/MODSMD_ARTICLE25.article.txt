# Loss of populations key to environmental woes
## 
### Vijay Rao 
Around the world, countless
populations of various species are
being eradicated, and this destruc
tion affects not only the ecosystem
that contains the population but
also the biodiversity of the global
ecosystem. According to research

recently published by Biology Prof.
Paul Ehrlich, research assistant
(iretchcn Daily and graduate stu
dent Jennifer Hughes in the Oct. 24
issue of Science, new methods need
to be developed to combat the
decreasing numbers of populations.
()ne of the most important meth
ods is to change the way society

views ecological conservation, said
Hughes. In order to save popula
tions, conservationists must use dif
ferent methods than they employ
for species. Despite the far reaching
implications of population loss,
many conservation movements con
centrate on a particular species
rather than on the populations of
different species around the world.
This approach ignores the impor
tance of all the other populations of
the earth, and fails to iiddress the
specific problems that each local
region faces.
A population is a usually a subset
of a species. Although an entire
species may contain only one popu
lation. it may contain more. Ivsti
mates ol worldwide population
numbers range from one to six bil
lion. These high numbers under
score the magnitude of the prob
lems involving population eradica
tion. however. Because each popu
lation is genetically different from
the other populations of within a
particular species, it plays a signifi
cant role in the ecosystem in which
it exists.
According to the research, new
steps must be made to save the
habitat of populations in specific
regions and more emphasis must he
placed on concentrating on each
particular region so that the unique
populations and habitats are taken
into account when trying to con
serve the local ecosystem.
The floods that ravished the
Northwest of the I Jnited States last
year provide a go<id example of why
populations are critical to the exis
tence of the entire ecosystem. In
certain areas, trees had been clear
cut. freeing land for agricultural or
residential use. When flooding
arrived in those areas, the magni
tude of the damage surpassed those
of other areas because the loss of
trees caused erosion of the soil, and

much of the water that would have
been soaked up by the trees and the
surrounding soil escaped, causing
worse damage. Thus, in the local
region, the loss of an entire popula
tion of tree species affected the
entire ecosystem within that area.
According to Hughes, these
issues are not specific to the Mid
west and they often have huge
financial implications. She
explained that because many popu
lations of pollinators have been
eradicated in the United Stales,
there is a dearth ol "native pollina
tors" such as honeybees, which pol
linate many important agricultural
crops. Consequently, many farmers
must hire beekeepers from Europe,
often at the expense ol millions ol
dollars per year.
Because many agricultural and
pharmaceutical companies use cer
tain strains with the same genes for
various purposes, population loss
can also impact the food and drug
supply for humans. As populations
are lost, genetic variability within
the population is reduced. I his lack
of variation within strains can create
environments where pests arise that
can destroy entire strains that would
normally be used by the companies,
Hughes said.
In Asia, for example, only a lew
strains ol wild rice were used for
agricultural purposes, said Hughes.
When a virus called the grassy stunt
virus started to plague the rice
crops, many crops were lost because
there was not enough genetic diver
sity to stem off this pest. II this type
of situation occurs to a major crops
around the world, the consequences
could be deadly.
Another crucial aspect of popu
lation depletion is related to the
role certain plants, such as trees,
play in the regulation ol atmospher-

ic gases. Hughes said that there
are many "trace gases controlled
hv plants... it populations of trees
important to the regulation of car
bon dioxide are lost, we could
potentially lose this global and far
reaching service." This type of sce
nario could lead to even worse
ecological disasters, from the
greenhouse effect to perhaps even
widespread Hooding. Thus, only a
preservation of all the populations
involved could prevent these types
of disasters from occurring.
Whereas 0.1 to 0.3 percent of
species, or 2 to 5 species per hour,
are lost each year in tropical
forests, 0.8 percent of populations
are lost each year in tropical
forests. This translates to 1800
populations lost each hour alone.
Because populations are being
eradicated at a much faster rate
than species, population preserva
tion is vital in eliminating these
det rime ntal conseq uenees.
