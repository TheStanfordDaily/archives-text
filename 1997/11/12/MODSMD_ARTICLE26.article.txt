I have a friend who is
pregnant hut smokes
casually. She doesn't
think that a casual cigarette is
very much harm, but I do. What
can I tell her to convince her to
stop smoking while she is preg
nant?

You can start by point
ing out the Surgeon
(iencral's warning that
musl appear on every cigarette
advertisement, billboard, carton
and package by law.
I he warning states that preg
nant women should not smoke. It
may be detrimental to the health
ol the mother while her body and
its systems are in such a sensitive
strained state, and il may also be
harmful to the fetus. I wen though
these occasional cigarettes may
not amount to very much for your
friend, the carcinogens and other
cancer-causing impurities can
have a greater impact on her fetus
because of the relative dosage.
In other words, the mother's
body and systems therein are big
enough to temporarily ward off
the harmful effects of an occa
sional cigarette. I Icr body has the
si/e and capacity to diffuse small
amounts ol tar. nicotine, etc. with

relatively little to no harm. Her
baby, however, is significantly
smaller in si/e and mass and does
not have the capacity to withstand
the same doses ol carcinogens
thai the mother can withstand.
I race amounts ol tar or nicotine
can therefore cause a baby to be
born with severe health problems
that will remain for the rest ol his
or her life.
The health problems that
occur in adults should neverthe
less not be taken lightly with ref
erence to age. liven il you're only
IK, nicotine will still stimulate
nicotinic receptors of the sympa
thelic nervous system to cause
your blood vessels to contract and
produce high blood pressure.
High blood pressure at IN?
Sounds silly, I know, but that is
exactly what happens.
I hese issues are not at all tnv
ial, and you should tiy to make it
clear to your friend th.it she i>
putting herself and hci baby at
risk Unfortunately, because ol
nicotine's effect on the nervous
system, it is one ol the toughest
addictions for people to break II
your friend needs more convinc
ing than you can give, trv to get
her to talk to her primary care
physician, OH '(iVN or a coun
selor at ('owe 11 Student Health
Services. Perhaps it she hears the
same warnings from a few differ
cut professionals, some red flags
might start to go up. (iood luck.
