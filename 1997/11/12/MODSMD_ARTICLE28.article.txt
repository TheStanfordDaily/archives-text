## Bikers battle in nationals 
### Dave Shuman 
Last Saturday, five members of
the Stanford mountain biking team
wove in and out of flag poles on
their way down the slick grass side
of a ski slope at the National Moun
tain Biking Championships in Mer
rimack, Wis.
They then arose early the next
morning — still recovering from
their Saturday wipeouts — to com
pete in a grueling 25-mile course
featuring hairpin turns, narrow
paths enclosed by rows of trees and
log jumps of up to one-and-a-half
feet high.
Both the men's and women's
competitions were split into A and
B divisions, and while the Stanford
bikers normally race in the B divi
sion, they opted to race in the A di
vision to accrue points for the Na
tional Cycling Championships.
Despite the increased level of
competition and the lack of practice
on the tougher A courses, the team
stepped up to meet the challenge.
Overall, Stanford finished a
strong 22nd out of 60 teams to earn
points that will be counted toward
the cycling omnium, a sum total
composed of points earned in
mountain, track and road biking.
The Stanford cycling club has won
the national title three years run
ning and hopes to defend it again
this year.
"It was a really great opportuni
ty for the team," said senior Sarah
Vestal.
Five Stanford riders navigated
the very wet course. Dual-slalom
specialist Craig Litherland quali
fied for the second round of compe-
tition, but a slip-out on his next run
prevented Litherland from advanc
ing further
Sunday .> cross-country course
was a six-and-a-half-mile lap of
tremendous technical difficulty.
Creeks, 15 logs and sharp turns
with tree roots were the course's
major obstacles.
In the three-lap women's A divi
sion, senior Patty Cisla led the way
with a time of two hours and 35
minutes, good for 40th place out of
65 racers. Vestal followed close be
hind in 48th place.
Cisla, who finished 10th at last
year's nationals, was happy just to
finish after recently returning from
an entire summer of rehabilitation
for serious back and knee injuries.
Graduate student Dan Lyons
finished first among the Stanford
men who competed in the four-lap
men's division A race. He placed
102 nd out of 146 racers with a time
of 2:43.
After getting off to a slow start,
freshman Forest Ray amazingly
passed 15 racers in his third lap, fin
ishing 107 th. Sophomore John
Bilderbeck crossed the finish line
soon after in 123 rd place.
"It was a lot of fun because there
were competitive riders of all dif
ferent levels," Bilderbeck said.
"Next year I'll come back with
some training," Ray added.
The mountain bikers close out
their season with a race at Chico
State this weekend, followed by the
Regional Competition at Reno in
two weeks.
