## Bikers battle in nationals

Last Saturday, five members of
the Stanford mountain biking team
wove in and out of flag poles on
their way down the slick grass side
of a ski slope at the National Moun

their Saturday wipeouts — to com

log jumps of up to one-and-a-half
feet high.

competitions were split into A and
B divisions, and while the Stanford
bikers normally race in the B divi

Despite the increased level of
competition and the lack of practice
on the tougher A courses, the team
stepped up to meet the challenge.
Overall, Stanford finished a
strong 22nd out of 60 teams to earn
points that will be counted toward
the cycling omnium, a sum total
composed of points earned in
mountain, track and road biking.
The Stanford cycling club has won
the national title three years run
