# New mindset for women's hoops

### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
Moving on with a different type
of team.
That's the attitude women's
basketball coach Tara Van-
Derveer has taken on the eve of
the 1997-98 season, and with good
reason. With this year's team re
turning 11 players, including four
seniors, the fourth-ranked Stan
ford Cardinal is set to reload and
make a run at its fourth consecu
tive Final Four appearance, start
ing with tonight's 7:30 exhibition
opener against Slovakia.

Besides, VanDerveer has been
in the business of running a high
profile basketball program too
long to let last season's disappoint
ing 83-82 overtime loss to Old Do
minion in the national semifinals
linger on her squad.
"It's such a different team,"
VanDerveer said. "For the people
that were there, there was a
tremendous amount of pain be
cause you had invested so much. I
think there might be a tendency to
say, if it could hurt that bad, why
invest that much?' If there's any
thing you want to look at, it's 'How
can I improve? How can I do bet
ter?' "
Despite losing Naismith Player
of the Year Kate Starbird, West
Regional MVP Jamila Wideman,
C'harmin Smith arid Tara Harring
ton. there is still enough optimism
and motivation on this year's

squad to capture the team's ninth
Pacific 10 Conference title in 10
seasons.
"Last year's team kind of felt
like an old shoe — you just slip
right back into something," Van-
Derveer said. " This year's team
sometimes is giving me blisters.
"It's going to be great, it's just
going to take a lot of work. We've
got players who have been to three
Final Fours and they want to go
back to the Final Four. To do that,
we've got our work cut out for us,
and we're going to have to really,
really improve."
One area that doesn't need
much improvement is the front
court. That's where the team
brings the most firepower and
depth, and that's not counting red
shirt junior Kristin Folkl, who will
join the team when her stint with
the third-ranked volleyball team
ends — most likely in late Decem
ber.
With the rash of injuries that hit
the frontcourt last year, Folkl was
prompted to return for the final 10
games and delivered, averaging
10.7 points and 5.2 rebounds per
game.
Seniors Vanessa Nygaard,
Olympia Scott, Naomi Muli
tauaopele and Heather Owen are
the other key returnees in what
many consider the nation's deepest
frontline. Combined, they return
63 percent of last year's offense,
with Scott's 16.2 points per game
highest among returning players.
The senior center was also the
team's leading rebounder, tearing
down nearly eight boards per
game.
Nygaard, while technically a
post player, is better known as one
of the team's deadliest three-point

shooters. Last season, she nailed >X
three-pointers, including (hiMII
against Michigan 111 the Wahine
Classic and four of her first font at
home against Washington.
I he one setback so far has been
the status ol Mulitauaopele, who
has been slow to recover from
major offseason knee surgery.
Mulitauaopele started 2(1 games
last year and scored in double fig
ures 12 times.

"With ()mi out, you've got
|()wen| emerging and taking ad
vantage ol that opportunity," Van
I )crveer said.
Indeed, the senioi forward con
tinned to show improvement last
season, highlighted by her 24
points and 10 rebounds in a tough
road win at Washington.

settled, the backcourt looks like an
other matter.
The heirs apparent to Starbird
and Wideman are sophomore
guards Christina Batastini, Milena
Flores, Melody Peterson and
Yvonne Cibalazeh, four who are
short on experience but not on tal
ent.
'Tin really pleased with the im
provement that our players have
made over the summer," Van-
Derveer said. "I think [Batastini
has| improved tremendously, I

think [Peterson] has improved
tremendously, |Flores| and [Clbal
a/eh|. Our sophomore guards are
really a special group."
Because Flores was the only one
of the four to play in all 36 games
(including two starts), it would ap
pear she is the frontrunner to run
the point. Hut all four showed good
backcourt skills, and with the appar
ent improvement made over the
summer, the situation may not be so
clear-cut.
VanDerveer sees it as a great op
portunity lor the four to get serious
playing time, as well as a chance to
mold her team to her backcourt
play.

"In 1991, we went from having an
All-American point guard in Sonja
Henning to winning a national
championship with Molly Gooden
baur the next year," VanDerveer
said. "That was taking advantage of
her strengths.
"The only question about them is
their experience. But the way I look
at it. they played against an All-
American everyday in Kate Star
bird, a top draft pick in |Wideman|
and a great defender in Charmin
(Smith), so they're ready."
Also ready to contribute is an
other strong Cardinal recruiting
class. Adding depth to the back
court will be 6-foot-1 guard Naila

Mosely and 6-0 guard Sarah Dim
son. Mosely will add strong defense
while Dimson will contribute some
rebounding.
Pushing the established front
court players will be Karesa
Granderson, a 6-2 power forward
and high school All-American, and
6-6 Carolyn Moos, one of six final
ists for the 1997 Boost / Naismith
National High School Player of the
Year.
"I'm really impressed with our
freshmen," VanDerveer said. "I
think our freshmen are doing really
well and they all give us different
things. The best thing is. we don't
depend on our freshmen to start for

us, so they'll be able to ease into the
college game."
So while this year's team will
likely not challenge last season's 34-
2 record, it still carries the high
hopes and expectations that a No. 4
ranking provides. For VanDerveer,
it means trying to be more involved
with day-to-day things that maybe
leaders like Wideman took care (if.
" Things were so much more set
in a way," VanDerveer said.
"You've got [Starbird], [Wideman]
and [Nygaard]. That was almost the
same lineup as the year before....
For me, I just try to be very direct
and learn from the things that
maybe held us back last year."

Regional MVP Jamila Wideman,
C'harmin Smith arid Tara Harring
ton. there is still enough optimism
and motivation on this year's

squad to capture the team's ninth
Pacific 10 Conference title in 10
seasons.
"Last year's team kind of felt
like an old shoe — you just slip
right back into something," Van-
Derveer said. " This year's team
sometimes is giving me blisters.
"It's going to be great, it's just
going to take a lot of work. We've
got players who have been to three
Final Fours and they want to go
back to the Final Four. To do that,
we've got our work cut out for us,
and we're going to have to really,
really improve."
One area that doesn't need
much improvement is the front
court. That's where the team
brings the most firepower and
depth, and that's not counting red
shirt junior Kristin Folkl, who will
join the team when her stint with
the third-ranked volleyball team
ends — most likely in late Decem
ber.
With the rash of injuries that hit
the frontcourt last year, Folkl was
prompted to return for the final 10
games and delivered, averaging
10.7 points and 5.2 rebounds per
game.
Seniors Vanessa Nygaard,
Olympia Scott, Naomi Muli
tauaopele and Heather Owen are
the other key returnees in what
many consider the nation's deepest
frontline. Combined, they return
63 percent of last year's offense,
with Scott's 16.2 points per game
highest among returning players.
The senior center was also the
team's leading rebounder, tearing
down nearly eight boards per
game.
Nygaard, while technically a
post player, is better known as one
of the team's deadliest three-point

shooters. Last season, she nailed >X
three-pointers, including (hiMII
against Michigan 111 the Wahine
Classic and four of her first font at
home against Washington.
I he one setback so far has been
the status ol Mulitauaopele, who
has been slow to recover from
major offseason knee surgery.
Mulitauaopele started 2(1 games
last year and scored in double fig
ures 12 times.

"With ()mi out, you've got
|()wen| emerging and taking ad
vantage ol that opportunity," Van
I )crveer said.
Indeed, the senioi forward con
tinned to show improvement last
season, highlighted by her 24
points and 10 rebounds in a tough
road win at Washington.

Senior Vanessa Nygaard is one of the top returnees for head
coach Tara VanDerveer's Cardinal, which meets Slovakia in an
exhibition game tonight at 7:30 p.m.
settled, the backcourt looks like an
other matter.
The heirs apparent to Starbird
and Wideman are sophomore
guards Christina Batastini, Milena
Flores, Melody Peterson and
Yvonne Cibalazeh, four who are
short on experience but not on tal
ent.
'Tin really pleased with the im
provement that our players have
made over the summer," Van-
Derveer said. "I think [Batastini
has| improved tremendously, I

think [Peterson] has improved
tremendously, |Flores| and [Clbal
a/eh|. Our sophomore guards are
really a special group."
Because Flores was the only one
of the four to play in all 36 games
(including two starts), it would ap
pear she is the frontrunner to run
the point. Hut all four showed good
backcourt skills, and with the appar
ent improvement made over the
summer, the situation may not be so
clear-cut.
VanDerveer sees it as a great op
portunity lor the four to get serious
playing time, as well as a chance to
mold her team to her backcourt
play.

"In 1991, we went from having an
All-American point guard in Sonja
Henning to winning a national
championship with Molly Gooden
baur the next year," VanDerveer
said. "That was taking advantage of
her strengths.
"The only question about them is
their experience. But the way I look
at it. they played against an All-
American everyday in Kate Star
bird, a top draft pick in |Wideman|
and a great defender in Charmin
(Smith), so they're ready."
Also ready to contribute is an
other strong Cardinal recruiting
class. Adding depth to the back
court will be 6-foot-1 guard Naila

Mosely and 6-0 guard Sarah Dim
son. Mosely will add strong defense
while Dimson will contribute some
rebounding.
Pushing the established front
court players will be Karesa
Granderson, a 6-2 power forward
and high school All-American, and
6-6 Carolyn Moos, one of six final
ists for the 1997 Boost / Naismith
National High School Player of the
Year.
"I'm really impressed with our
freshmen," VanDerveer said. "I
think our freshmen are doing really
well and they all give us different
things. The best thing is. we don't
depend on our freshmen to start for

us, so they'll be able to ease into the
college game."
So while this year's team will
likely not challenge last season's 34-
2 record, it still carries the high
hopes and expectations that a No. 4
ranking provides. For VanDerveer,
it means trying to be more involved
with day-to-day things that maybe
leaders like Wideman took care (if.
" Things were so much more set
in a way," VanDerveer said.
"You've got [Starbird], [Wideman]
and [Nygaard]. That was almost the
same lineup as the year before....
For me, I just try to be very direct
and learn from the things that
maybe held us back last year."
Moving on with a different type
of team.
That's the attitude women's
basketball coach Tara Van-
Derveer has taken on the eve of
the 1997-98 season, and with good
reason. With this year's team re
turning 11 players, including four
seniors, the fourth-ranked Stan
ford Cardinal is set to reload and
make a run at its fourth consecu
tive Final Four appearance, start
ing with tonight's 7:30 exhibition
opener against Slovakia.

Besides, VanDerveer has been
in the business of running a high
profile basketball program too
long to let last season's disappoint
ing 83-82 overtime loss to Old Do
minion in the national semifinals
linger on her squad.
"It's such a different team,"
VanDerveer said. "For the people
that were there, there was a
tremendous amount of pain be
cause you had invested so much. I
think there might be a tendency to
say, if it could hurt that bad, why
invest that much?' If there's any
thing you want to look at, it's 'How
can I improve? How can I do bet
ter?' "
