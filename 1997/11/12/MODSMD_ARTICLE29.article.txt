# New mindset for women's hoops

### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
Moving on with a different type
of team.
That's the attitude women's
basketball coach Tara Van-
Derveer has taken on the eve of
the 1997-98 season, and with good
reason. With this year's team re
turning 11 players, including four
seniors, the fourth-ranked Stan
ford Cardinal is set to reload and
make a run at its fourth consecu
tive Final Four appearance, start
ing with tonight's 7:30 exhibition
opener against Slovakia.

Besides, VanDerveer has been
in the business of running a high
profile basketball program too
long to let last season's disappoint
ing 83-82 overtime loss to Old Do
minion in the national semifinals
linger on her squad.
"It's such a different team,"
VanDerveer said. "For the people
that were there, there was a
tremendous amount of pain be
cause you had invested so much. I
think there might be a tendency to
say, if it could hurt that bad, why
invest that much?' If there's any
thing you want to look at, it's 'How
can I improve? How can I do bet
ter?' "
Despite losing Naismith Player
of the Year Kate Starbird, West
Regional MVP Jamila Wideman,
C'harmin Smith arid Tara Harring
ton. there is still enough optimism
and motivation on this year's

squad to capture the team's ninth
Pacific 10 Conference title in 10
seasons.
"Last year's team kind of felt
like an old shoe — you just slip
right back into something," Van-
Derveer said. " This year's team
sometimes is giving me blisters.
"It's going to be great, it's just
going to take a lot of work. We've
got players who have been to three
Final Fours and they want to go
back to the Final Four. To do that,
we've got our work cut out for us,
and we're going to have to really,
really improve."
One area that doesn't need
much improvement is the front
court. That's where the team
brings the most firepower and
depth, and that's not counting red
shirt junior Kristin Folkl, who will
join the team when her stint with
the third-ranked volleyball team
ends — most likely in late Decem
ber.
With the rash of injuries that hit
the frontcourt last year, Folkl was
prompted to return for the final 10
games and delivered, averaging
10.7 points and 5.2 rebounds per
game.
Seniors Vanessa Nygaard,
Olympia Scott, Naomi Muli
tauaopele and Heather Owen are
the other key returnees in what
many consider the nation's deepest
frontline. Combined, they return
63 percent of last year's offense,
with Scott's 16.2 points per game
highest among returning players.
The senior center was also the
team's leading rebounder, tearing
down nearly eight boards per
game.
Nygaard, while technically a
post player, is better known as one
of the team's deadliest three-point

shooters. Last season, she nailed >X
three-pointers, including (hiMII
against Michigan 111 the Wahine
Classic and four of her first font at
home against Washington.
I he one setback so far has been
the status ol Mulitauaopele, who
has been slow to recover from
major offseason knee surgery.
Mulitauaopele started 2(1 games
last year and scored in double fig
ures 12 times.

"With ()mi out, you've got
|()wen| emerging and taking ad
vantage ol that opportunity," Van
I )crveer said.
Indeed, the senioi forward con
tinned to show improvement last
season, highlighted by her 24
points and 10 rebounds in a tough
road win at Washington.
