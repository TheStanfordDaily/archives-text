### Ben Freda Staff writer 
I lie Stanford women's soccci
team's season came to .111 abiupt
and surprising halt yesterdas
when the NCAA announeed 41
large bids to the team NC\A
tournament and passed over all
but one I'acilie It) Conference
team.
I he announcement came two
days aftei Stanfoiil (I I 7 I, <> 1 I
I'ac 10) closed out the rcgulai sc;i
son with a victors ovci Arizona
that extended the team's unbeaten
streak to eight games.
"I think the most difficult thing
is that it's a sad situation toi 0111
seniors." s;iid head coach Steve
Swanson
" I hey ve helped build the pro
gram and helped us out so much
It's disappointing to see theii ca
reels end."
11( IA(IS J. <) ()), Ihe I'ac 10
champion, was the conference's
lone NCAA representative Ihc
Bruins were granted an automatic
bid along with the l> olhet teams
that won their conferences out
right.
I he ( aidinal s chances toi one
ol the remaining 16 at large bills
rested primarily on the team's re
cent resurgence a lie 1 a rocky eai ly
season.
Alter losing to I SC ;ind
I HI A in t lie opening weekend ol
I'ac-10 play, the team found itsell
at a dismal -1 /. having lost six ol its
last seven games.
Ibit the < ardinal turned its toi
tunes around, starting with wins
over ( alifornia and San I raiu isco
the following weekend. Stanloid
would then uosi\ straight matches
without a loss to end the season,
boosting its hopes for an at-large
tournament berth.
"In so many ways, our team
has progressed enormously,"
Swanson said. "We didn't reach
our goals, but we've progressed
an enormous amount."
Before last weekend's play,
Stanford was stuck in a four-way
tie for second place in the Pac-10
with Washington, Arizona State
and No. 23 USC.
But before the weekend was
over, Washington and Arizona
State had dropped out of the race
with losses, and USC had taken
advantage of Stanford's tie with
Arizona State to squeak ahead of
the Cardinal in the Pac-10 stand
ings and gain a leg up on an at
large bid.
But Swanson contended that
Stanford's tough schedule made
the Cardinal a stronger candidate.

"Year after year, strength of
schedule has been important for
getting into the tournament." he
said. "We played six teams that
eventually made it into the tour
nament. and USC only played
two."
In the end, though, the NCAA
chose neither the Trojans nor the
Cardinal.
"This is hard to believe," said
USC head coach Jim Millinder,
alter he and his players heard of
the NCAA's decision. "You look
at everything we did and I can't
believe it. 16-3-1 should be good
enough to be in.
"I'm shocked only one Pac-10
team made it in."
USC had a better winning per
centage than 19 of the 32 teams
that made it into the tournament.
And of the 16 at-large teams se
lected yesterday, six were ranked
lower than the Women of Troy.
UCLA was announced as one
of the sites for the first round of
the NCAA tournament, which
begins Nov. 16.
