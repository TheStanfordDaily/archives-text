# Fullbacks excel in low-profile role
## Senior duo of Ritchie and Cornelia revels in dirty work of Cardinal hack field 
### Ren Hur Staff writer 
When most fans talk about Stanford's fine pair of
running backs, they're usually not referring to seniors
Jon Ritchie and Greg Cornelia.
The two fullbacks are often overshadowed by tail
backs Anthony Bookman and Mike Mitchell, but that
suits them just fine.
"I take great pride in watching [Bookman and
Mitchell] rush for lots of yards and score a lot of touch
downs," Cornelia said. "If Anthony's and Mike's num
bers aren't where I feel they should be, I have trouble
sleeping Saturday night becausc there's something I

didn't do."
Although the rewards of playing fullback may differ
from those of more glamorous positions on the field,
they are no less important.
"I think something that's really special that comes
from this position is the bond between the fullback and
tailback," Ritchie said. "I take it upon myself to do all
that I can to protect the guy that's carrying the ball. It's
a special feeling."
That passion for blocking and creating holes for
other running backs took time to develop. Although
Cornelia and Ritchie may not carry the ball much, it's
not due to any lack of ability.
At Cumberland Valley High School in Pennsylvania,
Ritchie was a consensus All-American and tabbed the
No. 1 prep fullback in the nation by one publication after
rushing for 1,925 yards and scoring 29 touchdowns his
senior year.

"In high school. I didn't block. II I wasn't running
with the ball. I was a decoy or else catching passes,"
Ritchie said. "Coming out of high school, I think every
one buys into the hype surrounding themselves that the
media creates. I felt like I was a ball carrier."
Cornelia earned Massachusetts Flayer of the Year
honors as a senior at Xaverian Brothers High School by
racking up more than I.(XM) yards and averaging almost
10 yards per carry. He left having totaled more than
3,800 all-purpose yards and 40 touchdowns.
"It's an adjustment," Cornelia said. "It comes back to
being team-oriented. If you want to be successful in col
lege, you have to understand that you're not the only
All-America kid there."
Honing the set of skills needed for the college game
didn't come easy. With little experience blocking, both
players soon realized the intricacies and complications
of playing fullback at a high level.
"(At first] I had no clue what I was doing," Ritchie
said. "I had no technique. I would just run in there as fast

as I could and smash my head into things."
"People who are doing well at 112 ullback are the older
guys juniors, seniors, super seniors. I here is so much
involved."
Cornelia arrived on the Farm in IW3 and quietly
made an impact. He gained more than 500 yards ol all
purpose yardage his Ireshman year and moved into tln
starting lineup by the end of the season.

"I believe that football is a teacher in life," ('omella
said. "People say it's just a game, but I think it's more
than that. It was a great challenge when I injured tin
knee. I wasn't going to let anything gut in the way ol my
goals and desires."
When Cornelia returned for the IWS season, he
found Ritchie, a transfer from Michigan, waiting in the
wings. Alter verbally committing to Stanford as ,i high
