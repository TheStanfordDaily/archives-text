With I 1 seconds on the clock thousands ol ( ill

fornia students mobbed the field.
Stanford had just capped a dramat
ic drive by pulling to within one
point. Quarterback Jason Palumbis
had moved the Cardinal 87 yards in
1:42, throwing key completions to
Chris Walsh and Milburn, handing
it off to Milburn for long gains, and
downing the ball in critical situa
tions to stop the clock. With 17 sec
onds remaining Palumbis hit in
jured All-America receiver Ed Mc-
Caffrey with a 19-yarder in the end
zone. Cal 25, Stanford 24.
Go for the tie or the win?
There was no question in coach
Denny Green's mind. Or in the play
ers'.
"If you're down it's ludicrous not
to go for it," Gillingham said. "We
worked all year for a situation like
that. Basically we had said on the
sideline if we get caught in a situation
like that we're going for two."
Palumbis dropped back, going
for the two-pointer through the air.
Primary receiver Jon Pinckney ap

peared to be covered, but McCaffrey
was free deep in the right side of the
end /one. The ball was headed home
to McCaffrey's familiar grasp and
the victory, when senior cornerback
John Hardy stepped in from
nowhere. Interception!
The home crowd went cra/y.
Chanting "We want the Axe,"
Berkeley students, and a few play
ers, ran onto the field in celebration
wallowing in the joy of defeating
Stanford for the first time since 1986.
In their unadulterated excitement,
little did they know they were be
coming the equivalent of the Stan
ford Band in 1982.
For the game was not over.
Twelve seconds remained, as the
frenzied blue and gold crowd
seemed to have forgotten.
And in Big Game, 12 seconds can
be an eternity.
An announcement of "Everyone
clear the field. The game is not
over," greeted the rejoicing Golden
Bears. The officials joined in the cel
ebratory mood by awarding Cal a
15-yard delay of game penalty for
the premature celebration, just as
Stanford was penalized in That

Other Big Game.
Stanford would kick off from the
50 instead of the 35. An onside kick
was the only way to go.
John Hopkins' squib bounced up
the right side, and fittingly lept into
the arms of Cal's player of the game,
running back Russell White. And as
onside kicks often do, squirmed
right out.
"Cal's back line came and landed
right on it, but it squirted right out of
his hands and headed out of bounds
so I just dove and held onto it and
(the referee] blew the whistle," said
Kevin Scott.
Stanford ball at the 37. Nine sec
onds to go.
Palumbis threw his last pass in
complete, overthrowing a covered
McCaffrey — but a Hag was down.
Cal's John Belli was called for
roughing the passer. The ball was
moved to the 22 with five seconds to
go.
The Bears called the obligatory
timeout to ice Hopkins.
"1 was making sure there was no
time on the clock. You don't want to
leave time on the clock because if
you do the damndest things can hap

pen," Green said. "And I had our
number one security guy go down
and make sure the band was off the
field and I had our number two se
curity guy make sure the team
stayed off the field. If there was one
second left there were no Stanford
students who were going to be on
the field."
Hopkins trotted back onto the
field for his sixth field goal attempt of
the evening. A 39-yarder. The snap
was good. The kick? A little to the
right, but strong, and the Cardinal
knew this one was theirs.
Stanford 27, Cal 25. And the
clock showed (X):(X).
"Wcnv, that's all you can say,"
said Pinckney.
"1 don't know if there's a more fit
ting way to end the ballgame. If we
earn it, and 1 think we earned it,"
Green added. "That's football. We
never made any excuses, we never
asked for any. It was a great football
game. If there was a better football
game in the history of Big Game I
guess we'd all like to have it."
While 75,662 fans doubted that
Stanford had a prayer of pulling it
off, the Cardinal knew that it was

going to win. As soon as the team
methodically marched 83 yards for a
chance at victory, Stanford players
had a feeling the 93rd Big Game was
theirs.
"When I got ahold of the ball (on
the onside kick) all I could do was
smile in anticipation because I knew
the ball had bounced our way for
once, and finally we were going to
pull it out," said Scott.
"No one died down the stretch. It
looked like it was over but every
body stayed in the game, and every
one played his ass off," Gillingham
said. "I knew it we had a chance we
could take advantage down the
stretch."
And no one had the slightest hes
itation to call the victory well de
served. Unusual penalties may have
aided the Cardinal in reaching the
climax, but labeling the plot cheap or
unearned wasn't even a considera
tion. Cal's five laterals got the ball to
the end zone in '82, band or no band.
Hoppy's kick cruised through the
uprights just the same.
" 1 112 we did not win it we did not de
serve to win. You just have to play
it," Green said.

field for his sixth field goal attempt of
the evening. A 39-yarder. The snap
was good. The kick? A little to the
right, but strong, and the Cardinal
knew this one was theirs.
Stanford 27, Cal 25. And the
clock showed (X):(X).
"Wcnv, that's all you can say,"
said Pinckney.
"1 don't know if there's a more fit
ting way to end the ballgame. If we
earn it, and 1 think we earned it,"
Green added. "That's football. We
never made any excuses, we never
asked for any. It was a great football
game. If there was a better football
game in the history of Big Game I
guess we'd all like to have it."
While 75,662 fans doubted that
Stanford had a prayer of pulling it
off, the Cardinal knew that it was

going to win. As soon as the team
methodically marched 83 yards for a
chance at victory, Stanford players
had a feeling the 93rd Big Game was
theirs.
"When I got ahold of the ball (on
the onside kick) all I could do was
smile in anticipation because I knew
the ball had bounced our way for
once, and finally we were going to
pull it out," said Scott.
"No one died down the stretch. It
looked like it was over but every
body stayed in the game, and every
one played his ass off," Gillingham
said. "I knew it we had a chance we
could take advantage down the
stretch."
And no one had the slightest hes
itation to call the victory well de
served. Unusual penalties may have
aided the Cardinal in reaching the
climax, but labeling the plot cheap or
unearned wasn't even a considera
tion. Cal's five laterals got the ball to
the end zone in '82, band or no band.
Hoppy's kick cruised through the
uprights just the same.
" 1 112 we did not win it we did not de
serve to win. You just have to play
it," Green said.

With I 1 seconds on the clock thousands ol ( ill

Stanford had just capped a dramat
ic drive by pulling to within one
point. Quarterback Jason Palumbis
had moved the Cardinal 87 yards in
1:42, throwing key completions to
Chris Walsh and Milburn, handing
it off to Milburn for long gains, and
downing the ball in critical situa
tions to stop the clock. With 17 sec
onds remaining Palumbis hit in
jured All-America receiver Ed Mc-
Caffrey with a 19-yarder in the end
zone. Cal 25, Stanford 24.
Go for the tie or the win?
There was no question in coach
Denny Green's mind. Or in the play
ers'.
"If you're down it's ludicrous not
to go for it," Gillingham said. "We
worked all year for a situation like
that. Basically we had said on the
sideline if we get caught in a situation
like that we're going for two."
Palumbis dropped back, going
for the two-pointer through the air.
Primary receiver Jon Pinckney ap

peared to be covered, but McCaffrey
was free deep in the right side of the
end /one. The ball was headed home
to McCaffrey's familiar grasp and
the victory, when senior cornerback
John Hardy stepped in from
nowhere. Interception!
The home crowd went cra/y.
Chanting "We want the Axe,"
Berkeley students, and a few play
ers, ran onto the field in celebration
wallowing in the joy of defeating
Stanford for the first time since 1986.
In their unadulterated excitement,
little did they know they were be
coming the equivalent of the Stan
ford Band in 1982.
For the game was not over.
Twelve seconds remained, as the
frenzied blue and gold crowd
seemed to have forgotten.
And in Big Game, 12 seconds can
be an eternity.
An announcement of "Everyone
clear the field. The game is not
over," greeted the rejoicing Golden
Bears. The officials joined in the cel
ebratory mood by awarding Cal a
15-yard delay of game penalty for
the premature celebration, just as
Stanford was penalized in That

Other Big Game.
Stanford would kick off from the
50 instead of the 35. An onside kick
was the only way to go.
John Hopkins' squib bounced up
the right side, and fittingly lept into
the arms of Cal's player of the game,
running back Russell White. And as
onside kicks often do, squirmed
right out.
"Cal's back line came and landed
right on it, but it squirted right out of
his hands and headed out of bounds
so I just dove and held onto it and
(the referee] blew the whistle," said
Kevin Scott.
Stanford ball at the 37. Nine sec
onds to go.
Palumbis threw his last pass in
complete, overthrowing a covered
McCaffrey — but a Hag was down.
Cal's John Belli was called for
roughing the passer. The ball was
moved to the 22 with five seconds to
go.
The Bears called the obligatory
timeout to ice Hopkins.
"1 was making sure there was no
time on the clock. You don't want to
leave time on the clock because if
you do the damndest things can hap

pen," Green said. "And I had our
number one security guy go down
and make sure the band was off the
field and I had our number two se
curity guy make sure the team
stayed off the field. If there was one
second left there were no Stanford
students who were going to be on
the field."
Hopkins trotted back onto the
field for his sixth field goal attempt of
the evening. A 39-yarder. The snap
was good. The kick? A little to the
