ty is considering
adding C"rothers
Memorial Hall
and Kingscote
Gardens to the
undergraduate
housing I )raw.
The graduate

dormitory and apartments are two
of the buildings that could he recon
figured to help solve a housing
crunch on campus that affects both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents.
The conversion of Crothers
Memorial into undergraduate hous
ing faces opposition by graduate stu
dents Inn is more likelv to happen
than changes to Kingscote (iardens,
a Stanford-owned apartment build
ing on Lomita Drive, said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya.
liuilt in I 1 )1K, Kingscote has 41)
apartments, ranging from studios to
two bedroom units. Ninety percent
ol the apartments are currently rent
ed by Stanford students, according
to I.conic liatkin, a representative
of Stanford Management Co.
I lie management company over
sees the apartments, which attract
students unable to obtain housing
through the University system,
liatkin said.
"It's been a property that's had
an appeal," said Keith (iuy, director

ol housing and dining services.
I lie I Inivcrsitv performed an as
sessment ol the building structure of
Kingscote (iardens last year, and
the results raised certain quality and
safety issues, according to hatkin.
These issues, as well as wiring for
computer use, would have to be set

ly be considered as campus housing,
she said.
"Kingscote would require exten
sive reworking before il would make
an adequate student residence,"
Montoya added.
( \>nverting < 'rothers Memorial is
a more viable short term alternative
to the housing shortage, he said.
"We're looking at a variety of
strategies to resolve the housing
issue," said Montoya "It might be
possible to reconfigure current grail
uatc student housing, like ('rothers
Memorial, to create additional
space for both graduates and under
graduates."
Crothers Memorial has been
home to 12(1 master's and doctoral
students since its construction in
l l >S4. These students live in single
rooms, l M ol which could potentially
be turned into doubles for under
graduate use.
"These rooms that are currently
singles were designed to be dou
blcs," said Montoya. "II we utilize
them as undergraduate doubles, as
thev were intended, we could create
