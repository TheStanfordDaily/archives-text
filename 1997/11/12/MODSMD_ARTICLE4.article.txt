# Cro Mem may become home to undergrads

The Universi
ty is considering
adding C"rothers
Memorial Hall
and Kingscote
Gardens to the
undergraduate
housing I )raw.
The graduate

dormitory and apartments are two
of the buildings that could he recon
figured to help solve a housing
crunch on campus that affects both
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents.
The conversion of Crothers
Memorial into undergraduate hous
ing faces opposition by graduate stu
dents Inn is more likelv to happen
than changes to Kingscote (iardens,
a Stanford-owned apartment build
ing on Lomita Drive, said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya.
liuilt in I 1 )1K, Kingscote has 41)
apartments, ranging from studios to
two bedroom units. Ninety percent
ol the apartments are currently rent
ed by Stanford students, according
to I.conic liatkin, a representative
of Stanford Management Co.
I lie management company over
sees the apartments, which attract
students unable to obtain housing
through the University system,
liatkin said.
"It's been a property that's had
an appeal," said Keith (iuy, director

ol housing and dining services.
I lie I Inivcrsitv performed an as
sessment ol the building structure of
Kingscote (iardens last year, and
the results raised certain quality and
safety issues, according to hatkin.
These issues, as well as wiring for
computer use, would have to be set
tied before Kingscote could serious
ly be considered as campus housing,
she said.
"Kingscote would require exten
sive reworking before il would make
an adequate student residence,"
Montoya added.
( \>nverting < 'rothers Memorial is
a more viable short term alternative
to the housing shortage, he said.
"We're looking at a variety of
strategies to resolve the housing
issue," said Montoya "It might be
possible to reconfigure current grail
uatc student housing, like ('rothers
Memorial, to create additional
space for both graduates and under
graduates."
Crothers Memorial has been
home to 12(1 master's and doctoral
students since its construction in
l l >S4. These students live in single
rooms, l M ol which could potentially
be turned into doubles for under
graduate use.
"These rooms that are currently
singles were designed to be dou
blcs," said Montoya. "II we utilize
them as undergraduate doubles, as
thev were intended, we could create


Montoya
more spaces.
Montoya said at least some of the
additional slots created elsewhere
would be used to house graduate
students.
"Under this proposal," he said,
"the number of graduate student
housing slots would actually in
crease." The extra graduate students
spaces would probably be located in
apartment- or suite-style housing
units that are currently reserved for
undergraduates, like Mirrielees or
the Suites. Like Mirrielees, Crothers
Memorial has no dining facility,
which would give undergraduate
students not wanting a meal plan an
other housing option.
"If we could take two graduate
students out of Crothers Memorial
and place them into a suite currently
containing two undergraduates,"

Montoya explained, "then we would
be able to move four undergradu
ates into those same spaces in
Crothers Memorial."
Although they understand the
housing shortage, many Crothers
Memorial residents and staff mem
bers are reluctant to give up their
dormitory.
"It's frustrating that S(H) graduate
students were kicked off campus last
year, and something needs to be
done about that," said doctoral stu
dent Catherine Rose, a graduate res
ident assistant in Crothers Memorial,
"but the way to solve that is not by
killing our community. They would
destroy the atmosphere that so many
of us spent years and years creating."
Some stressed the advantages of
living in one of the few dorm-style
graduate residences.
"I like the camaraderie, the abili
ty to talk to my neighbors, that I have
in Crothers Memorial," said doctor
al student Francis Rotella. another

Crothers Memorial graduate RA.
"Apartments are more isolated."
"There is a functioning graduate
community at Crothers Memorial,
and that is rare." said one resident.
Susan ( hven. who also is a member
of the Graduate Student Council.
"Why tear that apart? I Jnless Hous
ing and Dining has a really com
pelling reason, they should keep
Crothers Memorial as an all-gradu
ate dorm."
Montoya stressed that no deci
sion has yet been made. "We're still
in a period of exploration, although
this does seem to me a question
worth pursuing," he said. "Ultimate
ly, any decision will disappoint some
students, but we're really looking for
a win-win situation here."
Montoya will next meet with the
Housing Office and the Office of
Residential Hducation to discuss this
and other options. The final decision
rests with Montoya and University
Budget Director Tim Warner.
