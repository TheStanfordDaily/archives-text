( 'asa /apata residents have abandoned tlieii ellort
tÂ«> rename the dormitory after lormei resident lellows
I ony and ( eeilia Hureiaga.
1 he idea was considered last February by students in
Casa /apata, the ( hicano I Latino theme house in
Stern I lall. Hureiaga. a nationally esteemed artist who
trailed many ol the murals that line the walls ol Xapa
ta, died olcancer in 19%. I le anil Ins wife were Kl s lot
nine years, until I W4.
Ihe prop(>sal was initiated by the /apata staff, aeeord
ing to former resident assistant Linda I'rielo. who eur
rently works with the ()l I ice ol Residential Lducation.
"It was really an idea that began with the students,"
noted the current KL, Alan Acosta. I here are current
ly no plans underway to introduce the proposal will) this
year's staff.
"We haven't talked about it," said ethnic theme as
sociate Adriana Ibarra, a sophomore. "We want to
honor I ony Hureiaga in other ways."
The proposal to rename the dorm also came in the
wake of the elimination ol ( eeilia Hureiaga's position.
I he position of assistant dean ol students was terminal
ed m IW4. I he layoll, along with several other events,
sparked a three-day hunger strike by loin students who
demanded that Hureiaga be reinstated.
( as;i /apata residents worried last year that the con
troversy surrounding the I Jniversity's relationship with
( eeilia Hureiaga would impede their attempt to rename
the dormitory. ()ther concerns also were taised. includ
ing how to include /apata alumni and the general com
inanity in the decision making process
I lie combination ol these problems stalled the ellort
to change Zapata's name, some residents said. I lowev
er. I'rieto - whose sister participated in the hunger
strike speculated that the idea eventually sputtered
out "probably due to a Lick ol student interest."
A University memo on naming policies and proce
dures dictates buildings can only be named after Stan

years.
The house currently honor Mexican revolutionary
Lmiliano /apata, who fought ;i guerrilla war in the
