Who's the Social
Security beneficiary?
You can't tell just by looking who's getting Social Security benefits because
a parent died, is disabled, or retired.
Today, 3 million kids under age IK get monthly Social Security benefits,
based on a parent's earnings. And, Social Security protects more than
70 million kids.
To learn more about Social Security, call 1-81)11-772-11'1,5. Ask for the
booklet Basic Fuels About Sociui Security.
