## Student groups plan coordination 
### Patricia Soung 
The Organization of Arab-American Students In
Stanford and Stanford Israel Alliance have forged a new
collaborative relationship to address issues pertinent to
both groups, especially relating to continuing violence in
the Middle East.

The groups will be sponsoring
a speech by Palestinian scholar Fouad
Moughrabi next Thursday in History
Corner â€” the first product of their co
ordinated efforts.
The talk will focus on the day
to-day lives of the Palestinians and the
possibility of peace among the religious
and ethnic groups.
The decision to plan some joint events

is unprecedented.
Doctoral student Nabeel Ibrahim, president of
OASIS, admits, "What we're doing is really controver
sial." Already, some students, including those involved
with the two organizations, have questioned the alliance.
1 lowever. Ibrahim describes this inevitable opposition as
a motivating factor to increase cooperation.
"Our goal is to provide mutual trust and understand
ing. [ The opponents are] not going to understand unless
we educate them," Ibrahim said.

Junior Maia Daniels, chair of SI A,
has also been confronted by Jewish stu
dents doubtful of the interaction be
tween the organizations. For instance,
Moughrabi is expected to be contro
versial since he will discuss actions
committed by Israelis against Arabs.
Daniels says that "many of the Jews
just don't want to hear about that."
Daniels attended a conflict resolu
tion program called "Seeds of Peace"

this past summer with IXO young teenagers from the Unit
ed States and the Middle East. She witnessed that "Jews
and Arabs had much more in common than either group
had with the Americans. There's every reason for them to
get along. It's just a matter of educating the other side."
She further explained that the general public fails to
comprehend fully the conflicts between Arabs and Jews.
After attending the program, at which Secretary of State
Madeline Albright spoke, Daniels noted, " These kids

have been educated and brain
washed to hate each other."
Ibrahim agreed with the need to
work together in the face of an ailing
peace process in the Middle East. He
stressed working at a grassroots level
to eventually decrease tensions be
tween Arabs and Jews. Because
many Jews and Arabs live in the Bay
Area. Ibrahim and Daniels said they
feel Stanford is an ideal environment
to deal with existing hostilities and
conflicts.
In the past and present, OASIS
members have experienced first
hand anti-Arab sentiment, often the
result of negative media portrayal,
Ibrahim said. During the Persian
Gulf War. the group disbanded
under pressure and opposition from
other students. Two years ago, the
group reformed.
Only last year, Ibrahim recount
ed, a woman spat on the OASIS
table set up at the annual activities
fair during Admit Weekend for
prospective freshmen. Other stu
dents have been told that all Arabs
are terrorists.
Both Ibrahim and Daniels said
they hope that their groups can dis
pel such stereotypes by working to
gether to educate others. This Satur
day Daniels and Ibrahim will attend
a "living room dialogue group." fea
turing Dennis Ross, the I J.S. Special
Middle East (bordinator. In a com
fortable setting, the discussions will
promote an exchange of thoughts on
issues and controversies surrounding
the Arab and Jewish communities.
()ASIS and SI A also plan to openly
voice concerns by writing letters to
I'he Daily.
Underscoring all their efforts is
the aim of educating interested stu
dents about political, cultural and so
cial issues pertaining to the Middle
East. Daniels said she believes that
"the future leaders of America need
to know about this issue" so that ef
fective measures can be taken to
achieve peace.
OASIS and SI A also plan to
protest the screening of "G.l. Jane"
at Sunday Flicks on Nov. 23. believ
ing much of the language and por
trayals of Arabs to be offensive, false
and unfair.
