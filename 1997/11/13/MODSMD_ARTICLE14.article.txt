Strive to avoid letting
Measure O mentality
politicize Stanford.

AFTER 20 YEARS of fighting, the
University finally won permission
in last week's vote to proceed with
its plans to develop land and improve tran
sit in the Sand l lill corridor.
Measure O, which was approved by 55
percent of Palo Alto voters last Tqesday,
will enable Stanford to expand Sand Mill
and Quarry Road, extending I hem to El
C amino Real, expand the Stanford Shop
ping center by KO.tKH) square feet and build
I,KM) units of housing for senior citizens,
faculty and staff along Sand I lill.
Measure M, which would have restrict
ed Sand I lill Road expansion and set limits
for land utilization in the Sand Mill vicinity,
lost wilh only 38 percent of the vote.
The developments planned by Measure
() will bring much-needed improvements
to transit and housing arrangements in the
area, as well as preserve other areas for the
expansion of academic facilities. But while
the passage of Measure O was indeed an
important step for the University, its tactics
in achieving that end are questionable.
The I Jniversity spent a total of $350,000
on the campaign to pass the measure. Thir
ty-five grand is not a negligible sum of
money.
Money was not the only campaign tactic
in question. In September the University
sent all 1,600 faculty and staff living in Palo
Alto a letter asking for their opinions on
Measure O. then followed up with a blan
ket e-mail to those who failed to respond.
The University also conducted phone
banking to garner support for Measure ()
in the weeks before the vote.
There was also an e-mail sent to a num
ber of departments and faculty / staff mem
bers. asking for support conducting the
phone bank. The e-mail was not authorized
by the University.
According to legal reporting require
ments. all employee time spent on the cam

paign must be reported and only autho
rized individuals are to permitted to work
on the campaign. Stanford seems to have
failed not only to respect the privacy and
integrity of voters, but also to restrict cam
paign activity to authorized persons.
The effects of the campaign to pass
Measure () may well reach into other areas
of student life as well. There has been spec
ulation that the decision to cancel the Big
Game bonfire was a political decision used
to reduce the potential impact on Measure
O, which could have been threatened by
adverse public reaction to the controversy
over liger salamanders living in the
lakebed. Measure () opponents had cited
concerns over the environmental impact of
Stanford's Sand Mill Road project in their
counter proposal. Measure M.
And finally, such rigorous efforts to
overturn a measure expressing the con
cerns of the community are not the best
way to improve relations between the Uni
versity and residents of the area.
While we recognize the benefits that
Measure () will bring to the University and
to transit in the Sand I lill vicinity, and that
its passage was therefore an important
step, we feel the University could have
been more considerate in its campaign.
Sending letters, e-mails and phone calls
to urge a vote on either side of the issue is
not what University employees should do.
Neither are faculty, stall and students to be
exhorted in such ways.
Furthermore, political campaigns
should not be taken up by departments,
faculty and stall as a means for urging fel
low scholars and workers to a certain deci
sion.
Community concerns also deserve more
respect, and it is negligent to satisfactorily
claim that the passage of Measure () indi
cates the community's support of the Uni
versity's plans. Ihe concerns of residents
who will be impacted by the measure
deserves continued attention, rather than
disregard now that the vote has been cast.
Finally, we hear enough about the vices
and excesses of campaign finance in the
world of politics; we don't want our aca
demic institutions to become political
machines as well.
