# Marc Chun
## Nothing like brutal honesty 
### 
MY ACADEMIC
life was quickly
passing before
my eyes. Starting col
lege. Graduating college.
Applying to graduate
school. Enrolling at
Stanford. Taking cours
es. Writing a paper. Sub-

mitting it to a conference. Having it accept
ed. Flying to Albuquerque to attend the
conference. Presenting the paper.
Which brings me back to the present.
I'm dressed in my ill-fitting suit, sitting at a
table at the front of a hotel meeting room,
sweat beginning to roll down my forehead.
I have a near catatonic look on my face, try
ing to avoid the gaze of students and facul
ty members in the audience.
"Is she ever going to stop?" 1 wonder to
myself, as I politely smile and nod at a pro
fessor who continues to tear apart my pre
sentation. "Point number five, Mr. Chun's
paper was completely unconvincing
because..." she begins. I nervously thumb
through my multi-colored transparencies
that are still warm from having sat on the
overhead projector just minutes before.
"Point number 11. Mr. Chun was unclear in
his explanation 0f..." I sink further down
in my seat.
For the uninitiated, scholarly meetings
are an annual ritual for academics. Every
year I attend this conference, which osten
sibly offers opportunities for intellectual
exchanges between hundreds of faculty,
researchers and graduate students interest
ed in education.
This mass of people descend upon a
hotel somewhere and spend a week attend
ing roundtable discussions, poster sessions
and research paper presentations. At a
paper session, three or four projects are
presented one at a time, and each
researcher attempts to squeeze six or 12
months of work into a 15-minute talk. At
the conclusion of the session, a discussant
comments on the papers. generally offering
helpful suggestions to the authors, synthe
sizing the seemingly disparate research pro
jects or posing thought-provoking ques

lions for the panelists and audience to con
sider.
Or, in this case, completely trashing my
paper. "Point number 17, Mr. Chun unsuc
cessfully argued..
I'm all for feedback, and I realize a crit
ical review of our work can help us to learn
and improve. But unlike comments on a
class paper that remain between you and
the professor, or feedback on a journal sub
mission which for the most part is anony
mous, a discussant's comments at a confer
ence are public. Very public.
I glance over to the audience and catch
the eyes of my friends in the back row, who
are sympathetically smiling back at me. I
sense that they don't know exactly where to
look, in much the same way one feels when
passing a wreck on the side of the freeway.
"Point number 22, Mr. Chun did not
specify the way in which..
I know I should be listening to this
"helpful feedback," but my mind starts to
wander. I ask, "Why in the world am I
here?" "Could I possibly be the stupidest
person at this conference?" "Hey, really,
why ctren'/ there any television shows about
grad students?"
I again look out across the audience and
try to figure out which faculty member will
be on the search committee for some job I
eventually apply for, and then I look for the
researcher who will review some article I
eventually submit to a journal. I speculate
on the odds that they'll remember this
humiliation as well as I will.
"Finally, point number 27, Mr. Chun's
ineffective and unsophisticated use of.. ."
I sigh.
The session ends, and as I gather up my
notes, the discussant passes by the table.
"Thank you so much for the suggestions," I
say. surprising myself with the sincerity of
this reflex reaction. 1 leave the room and
collapse on a chair in the hallway, and my
friends gather around. "Oh, man, she was
way off base." says one. "What was her
problem?"" says another. " That was unnec
essarily brutal." says one more. I manage a
weak nod and a offer half-hearted shrug,
thankful for my friends' unconditional sup

port, appreciative that no matter how had
the paper really was, they'd nevertheless
offer their lull support.
1 have learned that to be an academic,
you have to develop a thick skin. You (ace
relentless rejection: rebuffs from post-docs,
from jobs, from publishers, from funding
sources. There's something about bringing
all these brilliant folks together that height
ens their competitive tendencies.
There's some unwritten assumption that
all's fair not only in love and war, but also
in scholarship. Facing ferocious intellectual
critiques are "valuable growth opportuni
ties," and one is supposed to learn to just
ignore those folks who, in essence, tell you
and an audience of your peers that you are
an idiot. Why anyone wants to be one of
them is beyond me.
Fast forward 24 hours, and I'm browsing
at an airport newsstand waiting tor my
flight, wondering if the S(H) bucks I spent
for airfare, hotel and food (not to mention
the emotional drain) was worth the extra
line on my resume. Someone taps on my
shoulder, and 1 turn to see a gray-haired,
bespectacled man who introduces himself
as a professor.
"Excuse me," lie starts. "1 just wanted
to tell you I thoroughly enjoyed your pre
sentation. It was really interesting. Don't
get too discouraged by the discussant's
comments." 1 thank him for his kind words.
"By the way. didn't you present a paper on
chaos theory five years ago?" "Urn, yes," I
replv, a bit startled that he knows this. "Ah.
1 went to your session. After hearing your
paper, I became fascinated by the topic and
started doing research in that area. It really
got me thinking in this exciting new field.
Thanks. And keep up the good work."
With that, the man smiled, turned and dis
appeared into the crowd.
After a 30-second exchange with this
nameless professor, I crack my first smile of
the entire conference. Now I know why I
want It) be one of them.

Point number 2S, Mr. Chun is a doctoral

sentation. "Point number five, Mr. Chun's
paper was completely unconvincing
because..." she begins. I nervously thumb
through my multi-colored transparencies
that are still warm from having sat on the
overhead projector just minutes before.
"Point number 11. Mr. Chun was unclear in
his explanation 0f..." I sink further down
in my seat.
For the uninitiated, scholarly meetings
are an annual ritual for academics. Every
year I attend this conference, which osten
sibly offers opportunities for intellectual
exchanges between hundreds of faculty,
researchers and graduate students interest
ed in education.
This mass of people descend upon a
hotel somewhere and spend a week attend
ing roundtable discussions, poster sessions
and research paper presentations. At a
paper session, three or four projects are
presented one at a time, and each
researcher attempts to squeeze six or 12
months of work into a 15-minute talk. At
the conclusion of the session, a discussant
comments on the papers. generally offering
helpful suggestions to the authors, synthe
sizing the seemingly disparate research pro
jects or posing thought-provoking ques

lions for the panelists and audience to con
sider.
Or, in this case, completely trashing my
paper. "Point number 17, Mr. Chun unsuc
cessfully argued..
I'm all for feedback, and I realize a crit
ical review of our work can help us to learn
and improve. But unlike comments on a
class paper that remain between you and
the professor, or feedback on a journal sub
mission which for the most part is anony
mous, a discussant's comments at a confer
ence are public. Very public.
I glance over to the audience and catch
the eyes of my friends in the back row, who
are sympathetically smiling back at me. I
sense that they don't know exactly where to
look, in much the same way one feels when
passing a wreck on the side of the freeway.
"Point number 22, Mr. Chun did not
specify the way in which..
I know I should be listening to this
"helpful feedback," but my mind starts to
wander. I ask, "Why in the world am I
here?" "Could I possibly be the stupidest
person at this conference?" "Hey, really,
why ctren'/ there any television shows about
grad students?"
I again look out across the audience and
try to figure out which faculty member will
be on the search committee for some job I
eventually apply for, and then I look for the
researcher who will review some article I
eventually submit to a journal. I speculate
on the odds that they'll remember this
humiliation as well as I will.
"Finally, point number 27, Mr. Chun's
ineffective and unsophisticated use of.. ."
I sigh.
The session ends, and as I gather up my
notes, the discussant passes by the table.
"Thank you so much for the suggestions," I
say. surprising myself with the sincerity of
this reflex reaction. 1 leave the room and
collapse on a chair in the hallway, and my
friends gather around. "Oh, man, she was
way off base." says one. "What was her
problem?"" says another. " That was unnec
essarily brutal." says one more. I manage a
weak nod and a offer half-hearted shrug,
thankful for my friends' unconditional sup

port, appreciative that no matter how had
the paper really was, they'd nevertheless
offer their lull support.
1 have learned that to be an academic,
you have to develop a thick skin. You (ace
relentless rejection: rebuffs from post-docs,
from jobs, from publishers, from funding
sources. There's something about bringing
all these brilliant folks together that height
ens their competitive tendencies.
There's some unwritten assumption that
all's fair not only in love and war, but also
in scholarship. Facing ferocious intellectual
critiques are "valuable growth opportuni
ties," and one is supposed to learn to just
ignore those folks who, in essence, tell you
and an audience of your peers that you are
an idiot. Why anyone wants to be one of
them is beyond me.
Fast forward 24 hours, and I'm browsing
at an airport newsstand waiting tor my
flight, wondering if the S(H) bucks I spent
for airfare, hotel and food (not to mention
the emotional drain) was worth the extra
line on my resume. Someone taps on my
shoulder, and 1 turn to see a gray-haired,
bespectacled man who introduces himself
as a professor.
"Excuse me," lie starts. "1 just wanted
to tell you I thoroughly enjoyed your pre
sentation. It was really interesting. Don't
get too discouraged by the discussant's
comments." 1 thank him for his kind words.
"By the way. didn't you present a paper on
chaos theory five years ago?" "Urn, yes," I
replv, a bit startled that he knows this. "Ah.
1 went to your session. After hearing your
paper, I became fascinated by the topic and
started doing research in that area. It really
got me thinking in this exciting new field.
Thanks. And keep up the good work."
With that, the man smiled, turned and dis
appeared into the crowd.
After a 30-second exchange with this
nameless professor, I crack my first smile of
the entire conference. Now I know why I
want It) be one of them.

Point number 2S, Mr. Chun is a doctoral
student in education.
