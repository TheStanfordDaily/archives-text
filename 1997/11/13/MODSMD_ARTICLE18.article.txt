Daily article off-base
about Quad
As a former editor-in-chief of the Stan
ford Quad, 1 was appalled to read some of
the criticisms being leveled at the organi
zation in Dan Arnold's [Nov. 11| article.
"Yearbook still behind schedule."
Although I admit 1 was extremely inex
perienced in assuming the job of yearbook
editor, resulting in serious delays and mis
management of the Quad during the 95-%
school year. I did not run up a "huge
debt." I he organization's financial deficit
was initiated under the leadership of
Michael Nichols during the publication of
the IW4 yearbook. I took every measure
in my power to prevent our budget from
contributing further to that debt.

Upon inspection of the financial
records during the l ) 5-% school year, stu
dents will be interested to discover that
the majority of costs and expenses
incurred by the Quad fell under the pho
tography department. I'his portion of the
budget came to me under recommenda
tion from the photo editors. Garth Patil
being one of them. As I have nowhere
near the vast experience in the field of
photography as did my photo editors. I
followed their recommendations, with the
belief that they would responsibly control
the costs of film and development to the
best of their ability. In retrospect, that
hope may have been a naive one. In all
other aspects, however, I did my best to
keep expenses from escalating beyond our
means.
Furthermore. Tonv Lin. the current
editor, was not "faced with the problem of

finishing Chen's book while starting his
own." At no time did I relinquish respon
sibility for eompleting the l l >% yearbook
before it was entirely finished and printed.
I continued working on the 1996 Quad
and never once asked [Lin] to pick up
extra work after September l l >%.
1 fail to follow [Patil's] reasoning in his
criticism of [Lin's) management of the
Quad during the past school year. [Lin]
has virtually eliminated the debt that has
plagued the organization for the past four
years, and with his expertise in yearbook
publishing, he was able to create a good
yearbook at the same time. I saw a sub
stantial number of the proofs from the
1997 yearbook and am happy to report
that the quality was not compromised.
Given that [Patil] has not been associated
with the Quad since the summer of 19%.
except to retain possession of official

Quad photography equipment and use the
(Juad office and its darkroom as personal
storage and work space. I would be inter
ested in hearing him elaborate more on
his doubts about how [Lin] "undermined
the ultimate quality of the book."
1 would also like to take the opportuni
ty to point out that the revised constitu
tion of the yearbook organization was cre
ated during several meetings in a joint
effort among Nana Howe. [Patil], [Lin]
and myself.
"[Patil's] governing document." which
the article claims was adopted, was no
more than a very general, nonspecific pro
posal of how the constitution should be
reformed. Although his proposal was
instrumental in initiating reform. I took it
upon myself to create a comprehensive
document that specifically outlined the
structure of an advisory board, the elec

tion dI editors and other officials and
other administrative details that were
neglected in [Patil's] original draft. This
document was discussed extensively and
revised by all four of us, and it is this doc
ument that is now the governing constitu
tion of the Stanford Quad.
I encourage I he Daily's readership to
consider that the harshest criticism of the
Ouad comes from a person who has
admitted that he wants the editor-in-chief
job but who. due to his absence from the
organization over the past year, knows lit
tle about what we have tried to do in the
best interests of the yearbook. Please
keep that fact in mind when listening to
tuture criticisms of this student organiza
tion.
