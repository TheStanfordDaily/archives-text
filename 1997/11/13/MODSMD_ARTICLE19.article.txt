# Foreign Bureau: Hong Kong
## Resiliency in the face of natural disaster 
### 
Therese Lee

AFTER LIVING IN my little two
bedroom Hat for two months. Hong
Kong was beginning to feel just a lit
tle too small and settled. So I pondered what
I always ponder (to travel like a maniac) and
referred to my trusty Lonely Planet guide
book. The Philippines caught niv eye.
Having already seen exotic jungle and
tropical beaches in Thailand. I Hew to Mani
la in pursuit ot a volcano — Mount Pinatubo.
Its monumental eruption on June 15, I<Wl
had changed sunsets around the world.
Twenty million tons of sulfur dioxide were
unleashed 15 miles into the stratosphere.
Debris circled the globe twice and changed
the orange shade of dusk to pink.
I'd nurtured a romantic vision of volca
noes ever since a National (ieographic docu
mentary I saw in seventh grade biology class.
I wanted to hike Pinatubo and see the power
of nature up close. I wanted to see lava.
Two days after landing in the Ninoy
Aquino International Airport. I found
myself standing on a plain of white sand
meters above the homes of S.IKK) families.
This was Pampanga. the site of a disastrous

lahar. or volcanic mudflow, that had buried
the town while it slept in IW2.
Annual monsoon rains generate repeat
ed lahars. which destroy bridges and houses
and wreak economic devastation.. There
was no lava to see. In fact, there was noth
ing to see except a church steeple breaking
the monotony of the white plain. There was
nothing I could do but take a picture — of
nothing.
Twelve thousand people live in evacua
tion centers, waiting to be relocated by the
government. Clark Air Base, the site of a
largest center, now houses thousands of
Pinatubo survivors instead of American mil
itary personnel. I had the opportunity to
speak to one of the leaders of ( lark Air Base
( ommand evacuee community that day. I le
told me of repeated eviction threats and the
frustration of having It) wait years for reloca
tion. Many have been living in Clark Air
Base since the original eruption six years ago.
A natural question, then, was why the
government didn't just let these families live
on the air base permanently. Many have
even found jobs and have begun to rebuild

their lives. The answer: industrialization.
Clark Development Corporation needed
the area eleared for the completion of the
Clark-Manila Railway Pioject. The air base
had also been deemed a Special Economic
Zone by the Philippine government: the land
was to be allocated for the use of foreign
investors an integral element of Southeast
Asian economies. This designation is indica
tive of the export-or-die attitude many
nations in the region share toward economic
development. But the economies are now
suffering the consequences of over consump
tion and cheap capital.
Casualties have been manifest in the res
ignation of Thailand's Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. the plunging of
1 long Kong's I lang Seng Index and a contin
uing currency devaluation race in the region
as countries like Taiwan, South Korea and
the Philippines try to maintain their compet
itiveness in the export market.
I'lie export-driven growth that sustained
the economy before the stock market crash
es led to chronic over-investment: Shanghai
and Bangkok will soon have more empty

office space than anywhere else on earth.
( hina currently has over five year's worth of
demand for men's shirts in stock.
Meanwhile, deforestation in Thailand,
Indonesia and the Philippines is occurring at
a frightening rate. In Indonesia, this con
tributed to the disastrous fires that have
raged for months now — smothering several
citizens of its own country (and neighboring
ones) to death. Just earlier this week, its
smoke reached Australia.
It was against this backdrop of economic
decline and rapid industrialization that I
journeyed to Manila. 1 had gone with a
romantic notion of seeing a natural super
power. Instead. I saw more evidence of the
region's declining economic power.
However. I also witnessed the resilience
ol the Filipino people. ( ecilc. a family friend
I was staying with, shared a Filipino saying
with me it went along fhe lines of, "When
it's cold and you have a small blanket, curl
up." II unfortunate circumstances befall you,
you fake it. I his embodies the strength with
which Filipinos have persevered through
colonial rule, martial law and continuous nat

Ural disasters. "It takes a lot to make Fil
ipinos stand up and tight." she said.
But that is what the evacuees have had to
do to ensure themselves of the most basic
necessities. Brought together from different
towns by circumstance, they mobilized to
light for things such as school for their chil
dren and a fresh water supply, these families
were living on land the U.S. Air Force had
formerly used as a motor pool, (irease and
other chemicals contaminated the environ
ment. The people fought, and they won.
Each eviction notice initiates a new round of
mobilization and protest.
The stories of tragedy, loss and unfair
bureaucracy were less than romantic. I his
wasn't National Geographic. As cliche as i(
sounds, I realized how lucky I was. I have the
luxury of traveling 111 search ol adventure.
After all. my pocketbook is hacked by the
almighty American dollar. I had nothing to
lose and all the world to learn from.

I herese would like to thank I ess ie and her
family for housing, feeding and generally
pampering her during her stay in Manila.
