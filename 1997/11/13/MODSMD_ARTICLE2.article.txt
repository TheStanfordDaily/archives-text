# Powell stresses service as a solution
## Students hear about community involvement 
### Marcella Bernhard Editorial staff 
When Colin Powell was a child
living in Harlem, his aunts would
lean oul of their windows and
watch him as he walked down the
street to school. 1 his network of
family members made sure that
Powell didn't find any trouble on
his way to school, and more im
portantly, that 110 trouble found
him.
Powell, a highly decorated gen
eral who served as ('hairman ol the
Joint Chiefs of Stall under Presi
dents Hush and Clinton, said that
without this support "1 could have
gone either way.. I lived in a neigh
borhood with drugs and violence."

organization leaders held at the
Law School yesterday. Powell said

that by volunteering their time,
Americans can provide this sort of
network of support for disadvan
taged youth.
Powell is the chair of America's
Promise, a organization created b\
Clinton and former Presidents
Hush and Ford last April to help
disadvantaged young people.

gram from politicians, corporations
and individuals. America's Promise
has pledged to provide services to 2
million American youngsters by the
year 2000.
Powell has considerable support
as a potential Republican presiden
tial nominee in the 2000 election but
has said he prefers to serve the na
tion in private life and will not run.
Yesterday, Powell urged Stan
lord students to get involved in com
munity service in I-ast Palo Alto and
other disadvantaged communities
and to stay involved in service
throughout their lives.
"You don't have to go more than
a lew miles to get to" East Palo Alto,
a poor city which is "in the shadow of
this beautiful, prestigious institu
tion," Powell said.
"When you leave here, whatever
you do, make sure in your quest for
success you save enough of yourself
for someone who's not on the ladder,
someone who doesn't know the lad
der exists," Powell added.

I Jniversities, Powell said,can take
a key role in promoting community
service among its students. He gave
the example of DePauw University
in Indiana, where three-quarters of
the student body volunteer.
"Some universities make service
a part of the university culture,"
Powell said. "I would love to see this
extended to all of the universities in
America."
Alter his brief speech, Powell ad
dressed questions from students,
many of whom voiced the concern
that volunteerism is not an adequate
solution to the problems faced by
poor neighborhoods.
Matt Messinger, a junior, said
that with public schools and other
public institutions failing due to lack
of federal funds, asking people to try
to make up the difference is both un
fair and ineffective.
Senior Amanda Atwood, who is
active at the Haas Center for Public
Service, said she worried that "the
glamour of helping youth is blinding
our eyes" to broader societal prob
lems of economic disparity that can
not be solved by individuals volun
teering a lew hours each week.

Powell acknowledged these
problems but promoted volun
teerism as a current solution of
proven effectiveness.
"I agree with you that wealth in
consistencies and opportunity incon
sistencies exist," Powell said. "I don't
have the answer; I don't know how to
cross these economic bridges."
Powell also addressed what some
perceive to be a failure of govern
ment anti-poverty programs, but he
did not weigh in on either side of the
debate.
"1 don't know if more govern
ment spending or redistribution of
wealth really helps the problem...
some people say these actions have
failed because they have created de
pendencies. but I'll let the people in
Sacramento and Washington debate
that," Powell said.
"We can't sit around waiting for
magic answers to rearrange the
economy so that there is no one with
want or need. Your two hours a
week might not be the answer, but it
might be." Powell added.
Powell's visit was sponsored by
Stanford in Government and the
Haas Center for Public Service.
