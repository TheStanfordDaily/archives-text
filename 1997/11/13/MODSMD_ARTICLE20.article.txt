TUESDAY: The Rolex Regionals
at Tauhe Family Tennis Center

For the past lour years, a Stan
ford player has won the Rolex title.
Two years ago Paul Goldstein won
it as a sophomore, and current
sophomore Hob Bryan took home
the title last year.
"We want to uphold this tradi
tion if we can," said head coach
Dick Gould. "There are a lot of fa
mous names on that trophy. It's a
nice title to have."
Bryan will not compete in this
year's singles tournament because
he has already qualified for the Feb
ruary indoor championships by w in
ning the All-American Champi
onships last month.
Neither Goldstein nor senior
Charles Hoeveler will compete.
Both stopped out for the quarter to
play in professional tournaments.
Except for those three, however,
all Stanford men's players will be
competing this weekend. The Car
dinal holds five of the tournament's
top eight seeds in junior Ryan
Wolters (No. 1). sophomore Mike
Bryan (2). freshman Alex Kim (3).

sophomore Geoff Abrams (6) and
freshman Ali Ansari (K).
The seedings were based on last
year's regional individual rankings
as well as preseason rankings.
Ninety players from colleges
throughout Washington, Oregon
and Northern California will vie for
the singles title at the Rolex, which
serves as the qualifying tournament
for February's Rolex National In
door Tournament in Dallas.
Because the Western section has
been divided into northern and
southern divisions, only the tourna
ment champion will travel to Dallas
to compete for the national title.
Stanford also has four doubles
teams competing in the 38-team
draw. Mike and Bob Bryan are top
seeded, and Abrams and Kim are
seeded sixth. Scotty Scott and Ansari
and sophomores David Mauser and
Vijay Sekhon will also be competing.
Although tournament results
will not affect team standings, they
will help individual rankings. Re
sults of matches between Stanford
players may also help determine the
Cardinal's lineup later in the year,
Gould said.
"I think we're ready for a tour
ney. because we've been practicing
a lot." he said. " This basically culmi
nates fall practice, because it's real
ly the one team event we have this
fall. We're really proud and excited
to he hosting this tournament."
Play will begin at 8 a.m. Saturday
and Sunday morning on the varsity
and west campus courts. Admission
is free.
