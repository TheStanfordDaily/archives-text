honors lor volleyball in lW4and is
a three time All-American in that
sport. In basketball. Folkl's time
has been limited lo just 34 games
over two seasons, but she's been
impressive enough to be named a
preseason candidate lor the Nai
smith Player ol the Year award.
With all the success Folkl has
achieved, you would expect these

to have nothing but happy, upbeat
experiences to share about the
sport that took her to the I
()lvmpics as a first alternate.
Hut that's not necessarily the

Sure. Folkl is happv with her
teams' achievements and even
proud of her personal accomplish
ments. But there's an individual
standard by which the great ones
measure their success, and for
Folkl, it's a standard she hadn't
been competing at in recent s ears.
"Personally, this has nothing to
do with not loving the sport or not
loving my team." Folkl said. "But
not including this season, the last
two years ol the sport have not
been good for me. I haven't been
happy with how I played and
where I got, and that's pretty well
known."
After a stellar freshman cam
paign that earned her first team
All America honors .is well as na
lional and Pacific 10 Conference
Freshman of the Year, Folkl spent
hci summer touring with the U.S.
National I'eani. She joined the
Cardinal 10 matches into her
sophomore season and finished a
second-team All American.

ters of 19% training with the na
tional team in hopes of earning a
berth on the Olympic squad. The
decision came down to the very last
spot, and Folkl ended up as the first
alternate.
Folkl's return last season saw her
put up the best numbers of her ca
reer. but in the end, politics and the
performances of some of her team
mates played a role in Folkl again
being relegated to second-team All-
American.
"That was a joke last year," said
head coach Don Shaw. "There's a
mentality to let everybody play and
give everybody a chance. With | Lisa
Sharpley and Kerri Walsh], we had
two players on the first team, so they
moved Folkl down.''
After a year of the most intense
volleyball of her life, Folkl needed a
break. She opted not to play basket
ball. but joined the team in midsea
son when an injury plague thinned
out coach Tara VanDerveer's
squad. Folkl enjoyed tremendous
success in her 10 games, and after
spending spring with the volleyball
team, she took the summer off.
"I think having this past summer
of I helped me a lot because I felt to
tally refreshed, and essentially I was
ready to come in and give volleyball
my all." Folkl said. "I was very excit
ed to play. I didn't feel burned out.
I'd attribute a lot of what I'm doing
now to the fact that I didn't do any
thing in the summer."
II Folkl's performance this sea
son is any indication, Shaw may
begin prescribing a few hoops

games in the winter and summers
off for his players. Folkl is having a
career year, even by a three-time
All-American's standards.
She's currently in the top 20 na
tionally in hitting percentage (.380)
and the top 10 in kills with 456 (5.56
per game). And while her hitting
percentage is the lower-ranking sta
tistic. it is easily the most impres
sive.
Most players in the top 20 are
middle blockers, a position that
leads to fewer attacks and higher
hitting percentages. Secondly, a
large portion of the nation's statisti
cal leaders are from weaker confer
ences than the Pac-10, racking up
big numbers against lesser competi
tion.
And finally there's the injury to
Walsh. Folkl has been called on to
carry a large portion of the offensive
load this season, and with Walsh not
swinging at full speed, defenses have
been able to key on Folkl. Logic
would dictate that her percentage
would decrease, but so far she's
managed to put up the best numbers
of her Stanford career.
"Her hitting percentage is espe
cially impressive," Shaw said. "For
an outside hitter to hit that high a
percentage is pretty amazing. When
I knew that Kerri wasn't full
strength, I can remember saying,
'Folkl's going to have to put up big
numbers." And she has."
In fact, she's putting up the kind
of numbers that get people talking
about Player of the Year honors.
Alter posting 22 kills against 11( 'I .A
Oct. 31 and following up with a ca
reer-high 33 against USC Nov. 2,
Folkl was named AVCA National
Flayer of the Week.

But that's just one weekend.
Folkl has been big all year, leading
an injury-stricken squad to a perfect
conference record in the toughest
conference in collegiate women's
volleyball.
"I think she's a legitimate candi
date," Shaw said. "But who knows
how those things go. I think she's
had a tremendous year, and she's on
a great team. Sometimes that takes
away from a player."
But Folkl will quickly tell you
she'd rather be on a great team than
the only good player in a mediocre
program.
"If you don't have a great team,
you won't get great digs, to get great
sets, to get easy kills," Folkl said.
"It's also being in an environment
with other great athletes that push
you. that keep you on top and keep
your ego in check. You keep work
ing hard, and you keep improving."
So Folkl is working hard and im
proving. She's having fun with vol
leyball again, and it shows. But tak
ing a page from her own history,
Folkl is quite content to enjoy her
last season on the Farm and leave all
that talk about national honors to
somebody else.
"I've gotten my hopes up too
high for too many things in this sport
and fallen short, so I'm not expect
ing anything," Folkl said. "You're
supposed to do it because you enjoy
it. I don't have a good answer for
why I've been having fun this year
or why it's been a good year.
"This season is a lot more excit
ing just because it's my last year,and
you go out and play with a desire
that you can only get when you
know it's your last time to be out
there."

has been limited lo just 34 games
over two seasons, but she's been
impressive enough to be named a
preseason candidate lor the Nai
smith Player ol the Year award.
With all the success Folkl has
achieved, you would expect these

ranked women's volleyball team

to have nothing but happy, upbeat
experiences to share about the
sport that took her to the I
()lvmpics as a first alternate.
Hut that's not necessarily the

Sure. Folkl is happv with her
teams' achievements and even
proud of her personal accomplish
ments. But there's an individual
standard by which the great ones
measure their success, and for
Folkl, it's a standard she hadn't
been competing at in recent s ears.
"Personally, this has nothing to
do with not loving the sport or not
loving my team." Folkl said. "But
not including this season, the last
two years ol the sport have not
been good for me. I haven't been
happy with how I played and
where I got, and that's pretty well
known."
After a stellar freshman cam
paign that earned her first team
All America honors .is well as na
lional and Pacific 10 Conference
Freshman of the Year, Folkl spent
hci summer touring with the U.S.
National I'eani. She joined the
Cardinal 10 matches into her
sophomore season and finished a
second-team All American.

ters of 19% training with the na
tional team in hopes of earning a
berth on the Olympic squad. The
decision came down to the very last
spot, and Folkl ended up as the first
alternate.
Folkl's return last season saw her
put up the best numbers of her ca
reer. but in the end, politics and the
performances of some of her team
mates played a role in Folkl again
being relegated to second-team All-
American.
"That was a joke last year," said
head coach Don Shaw. "There's a
mentality to let everybody play and
give everybody a chance. With | Lisa
Sharpley and Kerri Walsh], we had
two players on the first team, so they
moved Folkl down.''
After a year of the most intense
volleyball of her life, Folkl needed a
break. She opted not to play basket
ball. but joined the team in midsea
son when an injury plague thinned
out coach Tara VanDerveer's
squad. Folkl enjoyed tremendous
success in her 10 games, and after
spending spring with the volleyball
team, she took the summer off.
"I think having this past summer
of I helped me a lot because I felt to
tally refreshed, and essentially I was
ready to come in and give volleyball
my all." Folkl said. "I was very excit
ed to play. I didn't feel burned out.
I'd attribute a lot of what I'm doing
now to the fact that I didn't do any
thing in the summer."
II Folkl's performance this sea
son is any indication, Shaw may
begin prescribing a few hoops

games in the winter and summers
off for his players. Folkl is having a
career year, even by a three-time
All-American's standards.
She's currently in the top 20 na
tionally in hitting percentage (.380)
and the top 10 in kills with 456 (5.56
per game). And while her hitting
percentage is the lower-ranking sta
tistic. it is easily the most impres
sive.
Most players in the top 20 are
middle blockers, a position that
leads to fewer attacks and higher
hitting percentages. Secondly, a
large portion of the nation's statisti
cal leaders are from weaker confer
ences than the Pac-10, racking up
big numbers against lesser competi
tion.
And finally there's the injury to
Walsh. Folkl has been called on to
carry a large portion of the offensive
load this season, and with Walsh not
swinging at full speed, defenses have
been able to key on Folkl. Logic
would dictate that her percentage
would decrease, but so far she's
managed to put up the best numbers
of her Stanford career.
"Her hitting percentage is espe
cially impressive," Shaw said. "For
an outside hitter to hit that high a
percentage is pretty amazing. When
I knew that Kerri wasn't full
strength, I can remember saying,
'Folkl's going to have to put up big
numbers." And she has."
In fact, she's putting up the kind
of numbers that get people talking
about Player of the Year honors.
Alter posting 22 kills against 11( 'I .A
Oct. 31 and following up with a ca
reer-high 33 against USC Nov. 2,
Folkl was named AVCA National
Flayer of the Week.

But that's just one weekend.
Folkl has been big all year, leading
an injury-stricken squad to a perfect
conference record in the toughest
conference in collegiate women's
volleyball.
"I think she's a legitimate candi
date," Shaw said. "But who knows
how those things go. I think she's
had a tremendous year, and she's on
a great team. Sometimes that takes
away from a player."
But Folkl will quickly tell you
she'd rather be on a great team than
the only good player in a mediocre
program.
"If you don't have a great team,
you won't get great digs, to get great
sets, to get easy kills," Folkl said.
"It's also being in an environment
with other great athletes that push
you. that keep you on top and keep
your ego in check. You keep work
ing hard, and you keep improving."
So Folkl is working hard and im
proving. She's having fun with vol
leyball again, and it shows. But tak
ing a page from her own history,
Folkl is quite content to enjoy her
last season on the Farm and leave all
that talk about national honors to
somebody else.
"I've gotten my hopes up too
high for too many things in this sport
and fallen short, so I'm not expect
ing anything," Folkl said. "You're
supposed to do it because you enjoy
it. I don't have a good answer for
why I've been having fun this year
or why it's been a good year.
"This season is a lot more excit
ing just because it's my last year,and
you go out and play with a desire
that you can only get when you
know it's your last time to be out
there."
