I iiushmg as Northern Pacific
Athletic ( 'onfercnce champions for
the third straight year may have
been enough to earn Stanford field
hockey coach Sheryl Johnson con
ference Coach ol the Year honors,
but it wasn't enough to earn the ( ar
dinal a berth in t his year's N( AA
tournament.
Ihough the ( animal was ranked
l l )th during the season, the NorPac
does not get an automatic bid to the
12-tcani NCAA tournament. As a
result. Stanford was forced to com
pete for an at large bid, and the < ar
dinal was shut out for the second
season in a row.
Finishing 16-fi, the Cardinal was
a unified team with a powerful pass
ing game at season's end. Farly on.
though, a third consecutive NorPac
championship was less predictable.
With three players absent the
t iist few weeks of the season to com
pete on the I J.S. Junior World ('up

justment somewhat challenging.
"It was difficult in the sense that
we lost three starters (from last sea

the Year last week after leading the Cardinal to its highest victory
total in team history.
you have to play with that person
for a while," Chambers said. "I
think it only took a couple of games
for that to happen."
Midway through the season, the
Cardinal traveled to the East Coast,
where it won three of four games in
a tournament at Boston College.
With its only loss coming to then-
No. 15 Boston College in the final
seconds, the Cardinal considered
the trip a success.
"We definitely came away satis
fied," Chambers said. "It was a
tough loss (to Boston College), but
the game could have gone either
way."
Defeating California in a tie
breaker playoff the final weekend
of the season gave Stanford its con
ference title, after having split two
earlier matches with the Bears.
"All season long we did really
well preparing for our games,"
Finkelstein said. "But we weren't
mentally prepared for that game,"
she said of the loss to Cal.
Without postseason play, the
team must now look to the future.
With 20 of 22 team members re
turning and artificial turf replacing
the Cardinal's grass field, the future
is a bright one.
"We have a lot of depth,"
Finkelstein said. "We are losing
two key players, Kelly Naylor and
Paige Mader, but I think we will do
awesome next season."
The turf field is highly anticipat
ed by players, who spent much of
the season hosting teams on Cal's
field.
"I cannot tell you how long
we've been waiting for the turf,"
Chambers said. "We have a lot of
speed, and we can really utilize that.
Your passes are so much more pre
cise and faster."
