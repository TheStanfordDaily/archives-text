# Community service common at Stanford
## 
### Robert Chiles Staff writer 
While volunteerism has been at
critically low numbers for several
groups this year. Stanford eontin
lies to yield a high proportion of
graduating seniors who have been
involved in community service, ac
cording to officials al the Haas
('enter for Public Service.
"In a survey of graduating se
niors m IW3-W4, 70 percent re
sponded that they had been in
volved in a community service ac
tivity while they had been at Stan
ford," said Jackie Schmidt Posncr,
assistant director for the center.
"1 would guess that with the in
creasing number of service learn
ing courses and other opportunities
that even I hough this survey is a
few years old, the number is still ae

curate," Schmidt I'osner said.
Service learning courses, such as
I listory 251 A: Poverty and I lome
lessness in America and IJrhan
Studies l l )4: Directed Individual
Study in ( ommunity ()rgani/ation,
require students to participate in
either ;i community group or a local
government agency.
Senior Amanda Atwood, a
member of the Haas Unifying
Hoard, a panel ol live students that
oversees all llaas groups, said the
increase in such coui ses is the result
ol several factors.
She noted that the I laas ( enter
runs a service learning institute
every year where faculty can re
ceive assistance in prepai ingeours
es, and that a number ol professors
who had participated in public sei
vice earlier in their lives wanted to
see more improvement in social and
economic conditions. Atwood also
mentioned that students who spent
many hours volunteering felt com
munity service should count toward
academic credit.
Darron Evans, a senior and
member of the board, remarked that
the focus of the center has not been
the quantity of the work produced,
but the quality.
"It's more important to enhance
the quality of the service," Atwood
said.
"There are people in the Haas
Center who are analyzing the

greater issues of service." said
Evans. "Haas itself is trying to foster
this thinking among its leaders and
its volunteers."
Evans also mentioned that the
University should play an increased
role in public service by encouraging
faculty to do research beneficial to
the community at large.
In addressing the issue of student
involvement. Evans pointed out that
some groups were in more jeopardy
than others, urging that students
should attempt to work within pre
existing groups before starting their
own.
"In general. Stanford has a
plethora of groups." especially those
targeting East Palo Alto and youth,
said Atwood. "Obviously there's a

temptation" to start your own orga
nization and be the head of it. but
"it's more respectable" to look at the
existing options first. "Individuals
have to get over the ego mind-set,"
she added.
Schmidt-Posner also pointed out
that many students pursue public
service outside of the Haas Center
through the Office of Residential
Education, cultural groups and indi
vidual effort.
Groups incorporated in the Haas
Center tackle a variety of issues: cam
pus education, community / grass
roots organizing, government,
health, hunger and homelessness, the
international community, society and
cultures, youth and education, and
technology.
