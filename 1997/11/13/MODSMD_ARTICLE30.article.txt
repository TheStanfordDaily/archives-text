In "Feeding the Body, Nourishing the Soul,"
nutritionist Deborah Kesten reveals how our
hectic, eat-on-the-run lifestyle has resulted in
the loss of a spiritual connection to food. There
are scores of books, videos, programs and per
sonalities out there telling us what to eat. Until
now, no book has addressed the need to under
stand not only what to eat, but how to form a
relationship to food. Kesten draws on sacred
and ancient rituals, dietary guidelines and cus
toms of the world's wisdom as guideposts for
reclaiming a spiritual connection to food. The
reading begins at 7:30 p.m. at Borders, 456 Uni
versity Avenue, Palo Alto. Free. Call 326-3670
for details.
