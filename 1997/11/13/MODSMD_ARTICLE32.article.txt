## Apricot Jam, we bay-bay 
### Nkomo Morris Contributing writer 
There are six kinds of music: dance music,
listening music, bob-your-head music, oh
shit-I-love-this-part music, man-do-they
have-energy music and how'd-they-play
that music.
A damn bad band tries to play each of
those styles and plays them ail really badly. A
bad band can only play one or two of those
styles, but not very well. A good band has the
ability to play each of those kinds of music,
but opts to play one or two of those styles
well, sometimes adding a third and combin
ing styles whenever they get sick of the sound
or just feel inventive. A damn good band can
play all of those styles and plays all them well.
Apricot Jam is a damn good band.

Even though the group is fairly new, Apricot
lam has already played hundreds of places and has
shared the stage with names like Zuba, Jambay,
David Grisman, Michelle Shocked, Ani DiFranco
and Leftover Salmon.
Apricot Jam is Lewi Longmire (lead guitar, lead
vocalist), Sean O'Brien (rhythm guitar, vocals)
and James Whiton (stand-up bass, vocals). That's
right, no drums.
The members of Apricot Jam met at a Hal
loween party thrown by a mutual friend in 1991.
Soon after they sat down together, they knew that
something good was happening. The emphasis in
their music is on listening to one another and cre
ating musical ideas improvisationally, according
to a press release. There's a snap in the music that
the listener can feel as well, a groove that connects
the musicians to each other and to the audience.
Apricot Jam manages to turn three very wood
en, very acoustic instruments into the most body
movingest, foot-stompingest, voice-holleringest
psycho-organic-acoustic-boogie-rock that I have
ever heard. It's hippie music, no doubt about it.

humor of Phish and the energy of Jimmy Hen
drix all come together gracefully in Apricot Jam.
But there are also some James Brown sounds,
some rock influences, some blues, some blue
grass, a whole lot of funk, plus some love ballads
thrown in for flavor.
By plucking and snapping their strings and
using the sides of their instruments as hand
drums, Apricot Jam creates an unmistakable
beat, a painfully persuasive argument for danc

ing your white or brown or tan or olive or burnt
sienna or black ass off.
1 first heard Apricot Jam accidentally one Fri
day evening about two years ago when the
group's van broke down on the way to a gig in
San Francisco. The joint in Davis, Calif, where
they ended up playing instead was small and
could barely contain the energy or dancing glee
of the surprised crowd. A friend of mine, moved
to pieces by the sound, began playing aiong with

the band on a napkin holder. We got him to stop,
but it was hard. Apricot Jam makes it hard to re
main silent and still.
Apricot Jam will be on campus on Nov. 19 for
Happy Hour at the Enchanted Broccoli Forest.
This will be its second year in a row of playing at
EBF. Last year, the crowd was small, because the
event wasn't advertised that much. However,
anyone who was at that party will tell you that
Apricot lam was one of the best bands to come to

Stanford all year.
The small crowd made it easier to do as many
arm-stretchin,' bootie-shakin' dances as possi
ble. Kven after they'd played for a full four hours
(with one 10-minute break), the crowd was not
ready for Apricot Jam to stop playing. The band's
music is invigorating and enlightening, and any
one too busy to come see them will miss out on a
music and dancing bonanza phenomenon â€” the
likes of which they may never see again.
