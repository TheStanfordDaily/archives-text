## Apricot Jam, we bay-bay 
### Nkomo Morris Contributing writer 
There are six kinds of music: dance music,
listening music, bob-your-head music, oh
shit-I-love-this-part music, man-do-they
have-energy music and how'd-they-play
that music.
A damn bad band tries to play each of
those styles and plays them ail really badly. A
bad band can only play one or two of those
styles, but not very well. A good band has the
ability to play each of those kinds of music,
but opts to play one or two of those styles
well, sometimes adding a third and combin
ing styles whenever they get sick of the sound
or just feel inventive. A damn good band can
play all of those styles and plays all them well.
Apricot Jam is a damn good band.

Even though the group is fairly new, Apricot
lam has already played hundreds of places and has
shared the stage with names like Zuba, Jambay,
David Grisman, Michelle Shocked, Ani DiFranco
and Leftover Salmon.
Apricot Jam is Lewi Longmire (lead guitar, lead
vocalist), Sean O'Brien (rhythm guitar, vocals)
and James Whiton (stand-up bass, vocals). That's
right, no drums.
The members of Apricot Jam met at a Hal
loween party thrown by a mutual friend in 1991.
Soon after they sat down together, they knew that
something good was happening. The emphasis in
their music is on listening to one another and cre
ating musical ideas improvisationally, according
to a press release. There's a snap in the music that
the listener can feel as well, a groove that connects
the musicians to each other and to the audience.
Apricot Jam manages to turn three very wood
en, very acoustic instruments into the most body
movingest, foot-stompingest, voice-holleringest
psycho-organic-acoustic-boogie-rock that I have
ever heard. It's hippie music, no doubt about it.
