# Lisa Cannon: More Than 12 Stories Under The Sun
## 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
Take an economics major, a lawyer
and a musician, put them in the same
smiling, piano-playing frame and you've
got Lisa Cannon, a queen of many trades
but a pursuer of one.
An alumna of Stanford ('77), Can
non has recently produced her first
album, "More Than 12 Stories Under
the Sun." It is a collection of folk-rock
tunes rich with emotion and stories of
life. Cannon uses her piano and warm
voice to wrap you cozily in a blanket of
idly wandering nostalgia.
(Gannon has not always been a per
forming musician. She had been playing
piano since she was eight, but as an un
dergraduate student at Stanford she
hadn't really considered music as a ca
reer. "I thought about majoring in
music, but I didn't think of myself as a
concert pianist," she said.
It was in her first year at Brigham
Young University law school that she
said melodies just started popping into
her head. "It was just a wonderful re
lease, a creative explosion in my brain,"
she said.
After graduating with a combination
law and business degree, Cannon
worked by day and played her original
music in various San Francisco clubs by
night. Eventually leaving the corporate
world to pursue her musical interests,
she moved to Los Angeles to start her

own band.
With an unsuccessful first attempt
at a musical career, Cannon returned
to law and later became Buzz Aldrin's
personal attorney. Now working for
him out of her home, she has more
flexibility in following her musical in-

terests.
