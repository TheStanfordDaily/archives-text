# Lisa Cannon: More Than 12 Stories Under The Sun
## 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
Take an economics major, a lawyer
and a musician, put them in the same
smiling, piano-playing frame and you've
got Lisa Cannon, a queen of many trades
but a pursuer of one.
An alumna of Stanford ('77), Can
non has recently produced her first
album, "More Than 12 Stories Under
the Sun." It is a collection of folk-rock
tunes rich with emotion and stories of
life. Cannon uses her piano and warm
voice to wrap you cozily in a blanket of
idly wandering nostalgia.
(Gannon has not always been a per
forming musician. She had been playing
piano since she was eight, but as an un
dergraduate student at Stanford she
hadn't really considered music as a ca
reer. "I thought about majoring in
music, but I didn't think of myself as a
concert pianist," she said.
It was in her first year at Brigham
Young University law school that she
said melodies just started popping into
her head. "It was just a wonderful re
lease, a creative explosion in my brain,"
she said.
After graduating with a combination
law and business degree, Cannon
worked by day and played her original
music in various San Francisco clubs by
night. Eventually leaving the corporate
world to pursue her musical interests,
she moved to Los Angeles to start her

own band.
With an unsuccessful first attempt
at a musical career, Cannon returned
to law and later became Buzz Aldrin's
personal attorney. Now working for
him out of her home, she has more
flexibility in following her musical in-

terests.

she moved to Los Angeles to start her own band.
With an unsuccessful first attempt at a musical
career, Cannon returned to law and later became
Buzz Aldrin's personal attorney. Now working for
him out of her home, she has more flexibility in fol
lowing her musical interests.
Despite her budding success, Cannon is still
surprised by the current direction of her life. "If
someone had told me while I was a student at Stan
ford that I'd be coming back to campus to perform
music, I would have thought that was great," she

said, "but I wouldn't have believed it."
Cannon describes the album as being very
"warm," a mix of acoustic folk-rock, with a little bit
of blues and jazz. "1 wanted the album to have an
earthy feeling, but 1 still wanted it to have the ener
gy from rock music."
That energy is evident throughout the album,
and a slew of different instruments gives each track
inklings of various musical styles. Imagine Tori
Amos, Lisa Loeb and Bonnie Raitt sitting in a stu
dio making music together and you have a sense of

the depth which Cannon's music reaches.
"Old Man at Point Reyes" and "Delia's Cafe"
are filled with stories of American culture personi
fied in characters with grand hopes.
"Delia's Cafe," highlighting the various person
alities that the character Delia encounters, is an up
beat but floating piece that blends undulating
piano with a bit of funk guitar and jazz organ
spritzed into the background.
"Some kind o' Ixwe" exemplifies Cannon's
variation of style, sporting a motown blues-coun

try sound, with blended female backup vocals and
a dash of bright horn.
Cannon's experiences with people and life
shine through in her music with a poignancy rarely
found in modern rock. "More Than 12 Stories
Under the Sun" bounces lightly with heart and
soothes the troubled mind.
Describing her own experience, Cannon said,
"If you are open to life and where it leads you, and
you follow your heart, it will take you in exciting
directions."
