"Who thinks Jennifer Aniston should get a mohawk?"
This was Dexter Holland's question to the audience before dedicating the song
"Hate Stuff' to the pop-phenomenon show "Friends."
Coming from a group that has been known to bust out tongue-in-cheek "Spice
Girls" imitations, the question was not as bizarre as it sounds. Surprises such as these
were a constant throughout the Offspring's concert Tuesday night at the Warfield.
Frontman and vocalist Holland even organized a mini-stage diving contest, after de
ciding that the audience participation in the activity was too low. The first guy flipped
into the sea of drunken hands, and the next girl tripped pathetically, at which point Hol
land asked a security guard to jump. (The guard jumped and was caught.)
The show began after the performances of two bands, One Bad Habit (too bad they
didn't seem to have even that much) and Good Riddance (that's right).
F.nter the Offspring, after a mild delay filled with the sounds of lions roaring piped
through the speakers. Despite this esoteric beginning, the show picked up when the first
sounds of "Bad Habit," their first song last night, were uttered.
Old songs or new, the Offspring rocked with verve and energy in everything. Their
songs were short and fiery, which is good for on stage performance. No time was wast
ed on long instrumental sessions.
Other show highlights were the five-minute jam session in which they played se
quences from songs by the Cult and by Leonard Skynard. Another was the song "Inter
mission," in which a transvestite dressed in a fish-net bodice held a sign with the song's
title and walked coyly with a banana placed delicately his legs. In the middle of another
song, the Warfield was filled with so many bubbles that the air seemed saturated.
But surprise alone can not make a concert, it can only enhance what the group does
or does not deliver. For the Offspring, these added features just made their one-hour
performance more exciting. "Token" Offspring songs ("Self Esteem," "Come out and
Play (Keep 'Em Separated") were played with older hits such as "Kick Him When He's
Down." This makes sense from a band that fought to stick with their independent label
Epitaph, even after gaining national fame.
Only when they found out that Epitaph was considering selling out to a mega label
(and thereby cheating the band out of profit) did the Offspring turn to Columbia which
produced their album "Ixnaye on the Hombre," released February 4 of this year.
Given this bit of Offspring history, it's nice to see that a band can still preserve its styl
istic roots and deliver new material. And even have enough fun to come out and share
a beer with the audience for the encore song "Gone Away."
