## Tales from the Peace Corps 
### Meredith Alexander 
Craig Carrozzi joined to seek adventure in
Latin America. What he found were cocaine
dealer friends and a prison full of child prosti
tutes.
liileen Drew volunteered because she wanted
to break down the barrier that had held her back
from Africans as a child of diplomats, when the
only African she had known was her family's
houseboy. She ended up realizing that the for
eigness of the place would never fade away.
What both had in common was their need to
write about these experiences, to tell the world
about the realities of life in developing countries
and to flesh out theirown perspectives on the
world-famous group John F. Kennedy started in
1961: the Peace Corps.
The name "Peace Corps" has a mythical ring,
conjuring images of strong, committed Ameri
cans providing basic services in countries where
"America" still symbolizes the good life. The
books written by Carrozzi and Drew add a new
dimension to the optimism of this portrait by
telling nuanced, personal — and sometimes
surprisingly critical — stories about their im
pressions as volunteers from 1978 to 1981.
Both authors will be coming to read from
their novels at the Stanford Bookstore today,
Thursday, Nov. 13, at 4 p.m.
Drew won a Peace Corps alumni prize this
year for her book, "The Ivory Crocodile." As the
fictionalized account of her two years in Zaire,
this novel offers a rich coming-of-age narrative.
The main character, Nickie, who gives voice to
this story, spent years in Africa as a child, as
Drew did. But her desire to really know Africans
remained frustrated.
Drew recalls that in real life,*"l had experi
enced Africa in a very insulated context, because
1 was among Americans. In the diplomatic com
munity, you basically hung out with foreigners."
Attracted to the Peace Corps because its

members live "out there in
the bush," Drew felt a new
connection with Zairians
when she first arrived.
"They're a very hospitable
people," she remarked.
"You're wonderful, just be
cause you're a stranger."
Drew worked as an Eng
lish teacher in a remote vil
lage, as her protagonist
does. She said she was
shocked by the respect she
was given. "People re
sponded as if I was a great
expert on things, even
though it was the first time
I'd ever taught."
In the novel, Nickie
fights against the distances
— both respectful and
strained — between her
main character and the
Africans who surround her.
She misunderstands her
students' attitudes, which
differ from the ones she
knows at home. Her stu
dents' cheating, she has
trouble seeing, is not just
laziness. Her fellow teacher,

Bwadi, informs her, "You Americans have ideas
about competition, that everybody must suc
ceed alone, but this is Africa. Here, what you call
cheating, we call cooperation."
Yet Nickie is anything but pro-American. She
often reflects on the loneliness of American life,
its lack of social cohesion. Her family is distant
physically and emotionally. Her mother died in
a car crash, "alone... It was such an American
death."
"America's neon and steel and suburbia did
not appeal" to Nickie, who seeks something

deeper. America also comes under
fire for its high suicide rate, and Nick
ie responds by reciting her existential
ist take on American society. "People
want too much," she tells her African
friend. American "independence"
makes people crazy. "We're so indi
vidualistic that ultimately we don't
care enough about each other."
So Nickie makes every effort to fit
into the authentic, communal life she
dreams of being a part of in Africa.
She tries dressing like a Tambalan
woman and makes friends.
Rut when she gets involved in a ro
mance with Bwadi, he reacts to her at
tempts with animosity, saying,
"You've never been in my world." An
anti-imperialist, Bwadi accuses her
and other Americans of "making our
children want to be American, like
you."
As it turns out, the very respect peo
ple show her is a tremendous barrier:
"the layer of respect that shut me off,
white and female, foreign" can never
quite disappear.
But the most arresting realization
that Nickie makes is the sense of lim
its imposed on Africa's children. Chil
dren are "petits," little ones, made to
do the bidding of their elders without
questioning. Girls are expected to

fetch a high bride price, marry and
have children; those who do not want
to, are literally cursed by their fami
lies.
Drew says that "most white people"
in Zaire "were transient," and able to
leave when they desired. Nickie's free
dom to leave, as well as the basic free
dom to chose her own life, are un
bounded, which sets her apart.
The story is told with tremendous
sensitivity. The reader makes these re
alizations along with Nickie. Drew's
style is natural yet polished, and her
fully-fleshed characters leap from the
page. One comes away with a lumi
nous picture of the fictionalized vil
lage of Mampungu, as well as the
knowledge that Nickie has discovered
something vital about herself, some
thing that makes the reader think
about Americans' place in the world.
Carrozzi's book "The Road to El
Dorado" centers on Vachio, the
young adventurer who heads to
Colombia to work at a juvenile prison
for street kids. His story is more
straightforward and much less psy
chological. While Drew's character
narrates her voyage into her soul
from the first person and limits her
self to a few key characters, Carrozzi's
book gives the reader a third person
narration and a panoply of colorful
strangers.
Carrozzi wanted to tell readers
about the darker underside of life for
a Peace Corps volunteer. The group's
representatives, Carrozzi says, "try to
downplay a lot of stuff," but he want
ed to tell a true story of the seediness
he encountered.

cruits said "man, that's true what

you said, but they're not supposed to know that till they get
there!"
Carrozzi grew up in the Mission District of San Francisco, as
did his main character. He said he "didn't have any money,"
when he graduated from college, but he wanted to live abroad in
a place "on the edge, on my own."
His main motivation was to find adventure and to flee the
materialistic consumerism of the United States. He found in
Colombia a country that "surprised me, because it was signifi
cantly more developed than I thought it was."
As one man says in the novel, "Colombia is a poor and under
developed country. But there are also unbelievable quantities of
money circulating here, che."
The character Vachio is shocked to see how many people in
Colombia are just as materialistic as Americans — they're all
looking for "El Dorado," the fabled city of gold that attracted the
Spanish conquistadors to Latin America. Carrozzi said he in

tended the book as "a remake of The Treasure of the Sierra
Madre,'" the 1948 |ohn Huston movie starring Humphrey Bog
art. But while Vachio faces unpredictable children at the juvenile
center, sadistic guards and a lying boss, his story creates little of
the tension that made this movie a classic.
Vachio tries to make a go of his job as recreational director,
but fails because of the lack of government funds. Finally, he
turns to a drug-dealing friend who gives him money for sport
ing equipment.
But he sees how impossible his endeavor is. The kids break his
equipment within days.
Meanwhile, he has interacted with local men and women,
finding romance and treachery.
What's unsatisfying here is the lack of development in Va
chio. One doesn't get the sense that he's learned from the expe
rience, and the prose sometimes falls into repetitive patterns.
Several women are described as "willowy" and "attractive," for

example. Some comparisons don't work well: Vachio is strange
ly likened to a "puppy dog."
But the dialogues have a real feeling, and in fact the frustrat
ing meandering of his story probably speaks to the realities of
Carrozzi's less-than-ideal Peace Corps experience.
Drew and Carrozzi are showing us that in going to work for
the Peace Corps, you don't always get what you bargained for.
But they took home more than their experiences — they found
material for lively fiction.
