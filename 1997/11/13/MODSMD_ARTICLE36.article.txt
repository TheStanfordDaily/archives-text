# Intermission talks with Eileen Drew
## 
### Meredith Alexander 
Intermission: Did people from the Peace Corps read
your novel, and what was their response?
Eileen Drew: 1 got a very positive response. Frizes are
awarded each year for returned Peace Corps volunteers.
They gave me the prize for fiction this year. That's the
best compliment possible. People who've lived the ma
terial you've used award it.
I: Were you responding to previous writings on Africa,
classics like Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" or
more modern works?
ED: Yes. I really like V.S. Naipaul. He wrote a novel set in
Zaire, "A Bend in the River." That's what 1 was shooting
for, something critical as well as evocative. There's a little
bit of Conrad in every cross-cultural novel about Africa.
South African writer Nadine Gordimer wrote very sen
sitively. She made stories out of the news. Paul Bowles, of
the '40s and '505,-was a little before my time, but very
good. Maria Thomas, a Peace Corps volunteer who
worked in Ethiopia, wrote some great fiction, like
"Come to Africa and Save Your Marriage." She passed
away very young in a plane crash in Africa. Of African
writers, there's Amis Tutuola, who is very fantastical
And Ngugi Wa Thiongo, who is Kenyan and writes in a
very Western style. He created a few characters who were
colonialists, and he wrote from their points of view, as
well as that of Africans. I like the idea that you can cross
boundaries like that.
I: How did Zairians react to you as an American, and did
people's ideas change when they got to know you?
ED: The Zairian response to Americans and also to
Westerners happened on a lot of different levels. They're
a very hospitable people. Everybody loves you, they
make you feel at home, feel special... As a white per
son, there's the colonial background to it, and I think
there was also a custom in the 20th century of being re
ally respectful to white people. I felt guilty, that I was ex
ploiting it. For example, to get around, I had to go hitch
hiking. The only vehicles were trucks full of people. You
always got the front seat. It was unfair, but there was a
residual respect And also a real class awareness — any
body from the West is rich by their standards. Most
white people were transient It was a realization, that
that's what really sets you apart Students would ask you
why you were there. They'd say, 'if we could leave, we
would go. What are you doing here?' Hopefully they
came to understand that I was there to learn about them.
I had my own personal reasons for being there. But in
addition to being white, I was American, and all U.S. po
litical policies were attached to me. People would ask me
if I was C.l. A.! Maybe it's true, some volunteers were, but
I didn't know any!
I: Did you feel compelled to fictionalize your experience?
ED: Even before I went to Zaire, I wanted to be a writer.
But I really did feel I had to write about it Back in college,
I thought it was fun to write, but I didn't know what to
write about I thought I'd have time to write in the Peace
Corps, but it was actually too overwhelming. But I did
keep a 200-page journal while I was there. After I came
home, I knew I had to write about it Even to my best
friends, I couldn't express it in conversation. Part of it is
that I wanted to explain it to myself and to other people.
I wanted people to know. As material, it wasn't a choice
— it chose me.
