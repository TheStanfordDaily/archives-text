## Intermission talks to Peter Speek, director of 'Snowriders 2' 
### Eno Sarris 
Many people don't know this, but Warren
Miller doesn't direct his own movies anymore.
He has actually had very little to do with it other
than some writing and most of the narrating
since he sold his company, Warren Miller Enter
tainment, in 1989. He sold the company to his
son Kurt and his business associate Peter Speek.
1 had a chance to talk to Peter Speek, director of
"Snowriders 2," over the phone on Saturday, and
he had some interesting things to say about
WME and its future.
The first thing I had to ask about was, of
course, Miller's future with the company. The
rumors flying about his retirement range from
this being his last movie to him having many,
many more left in him. Speek confirmed that
Miller is calling this film his "First Annual
Farewell Tour," in typical Miller charm, but that
the 73-year-o!d is still loving it and will try to last
as long as he can.
Getting the rumors out of the way, I asked
Speek about his role in directing such an uncon
ventional movie. Behind-the-camera, Holly
wood-style directing isn't really possible when
the material is real life skiing. Speek agreed, say
ing that his movies were really "directed in post
production" and that the cameramen were the
"Hollywood-style directors" of his movies. He
was especially proud of his cameramen, calling
them the "dream team of ski and snowboard"
cinematography.

After 47 years of movies, it must be hard to
come up with new material every year. Speek
pointed out that Khazakhstan was a new loca
tion this year, and that there are still exotic places
left to go to. He joked that maybe "space is next"
in their search for interesting locales.
In the ski industry, the major conflict of in
terests is between the skiers and the snowboard
ers, as any skier or snowboarder would know.
Skiers complain that the boarders ruin the
mountain by carving all the snow away, and
boarders complain that skiers are boring. 1 asked
Speek about how the rising popularity of the
snowboarding industry was affecting his
movies, and he replied that Miller gave the in
dustry "major support from the get-go" and that
their movies attempt to reflect "reality to the in
dustry" by giving them equal highlight time.
Miller seemed to agree in his newest movie.
When asked about his snowriding tools, he says
in "Snowriders 2" that when "I go out to play
golf, I don't use just one club in my bag. So why
should 1 use just one piece of snowriding equip
ment?" Speek added that this gets to the essence
of being a snowrider: you're on the side of the
mountain with friends.
A relative newcomer to the snowriding tool
bag is the hourglass ski, a ski whose dimensions
are radically different (and surprisingly shaped
like an hourglass). Speek claimed that the im
pact of these skis on the entire industry was
mostly on the intermediate skier, by making ski
ing "easier and more fun." He likened it to the

oversized racket in ten
nis, believing that it will
broaden the appeal of
skiing.
In "Snowriders 2,"
there are multiple shots
of the new Nissan
Pathfinder, a sponsor
of the movie's tour
around the country,
that some people find
to be gratuitous adver
tisement. I asked Speek
about the commercial
ization of the Warren
Miller movies. He said
that he believed people
understood that with
out the Pathfinder, his
company really
couldn't exploit the
beautiful wilderness
that they do. "Its not

like we're telling people to buy a two-seater
sports car," he added, defending the choice of the
Pathfinder.
Miller found the music to be a background
thing according to Speek. During Speek and
Kurt Miller's time owning the company howev
er, the two have added importance to the role of
music in their movies.
The new duo likes to spend more time choos
ing the music, mixing it up with popular bands

like the Counting Crows, and cutting across
most musical genres from punkish Offspring
and the ska of Horny Toad to the folksy Indigo
Girls and Samples.
In closing, I asked the director about movie
number 49. Ile responded that "short of being
physically unable," Miller will be doing the voice.
He added that it should be just as exiting as
"Snowriders 2," as they had already filmed in
Chile at I'ortillo, and from what he'd seen, the
cuts were choice.
