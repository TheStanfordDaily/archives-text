# "Twelfth Night" Revisited 60 Years Later

"So full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical" — Orsino
Ulyria, the mythical setting of Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night," suggests
the presence of illusion and delirium in its very name. ITiis week, the Drama
Department will commemorate the 60th anniversary of Memorial Audito
rium's construction with a visually fantastical voyage into the heart of that
imaginary world.
Director Aleksandra Wolska and a collection of professional designers
have proposed a challenge to the audience — and to "conventional Shake
spearean theater — by incorporating surreal and darker aspects into what
others might play as a straightforward romantic comedy.
"There is a lot of fun and merrymaking (in the play)," said Wolska, a
Drama Department graduate student who dnected " Hie Inspector Gener
al" last fall. "But at the same time there is havoc and suffering. Love has a
ridiculous aspect but it also has a dark facet and there is a deep sadness in it."
The central story of "Twelfth Night" follows a shipwreck, in which iden
tical twins Viola and Sebastian are separated, each presuming the other
dead. To get her bearings in the unfamiliar country where she lands, Viola
(played by junior loya Martuscello) disguises herself as a man and offers
herself as an attendant to the governing Duke of Illyria, Orsino, with whom
she promptly falls in love. Orsino (freshman David Joseph Regelmann? is
himself ruled by love for a neighboring countess, Olivia (junior Doan Ly),
who — in mourning for her dead brother—will not grace the smitten Orsi
no with the time of day. When Viola, concealing herself as the male "Ce
sario," visits Olivia to plead her master's love-struck case, she finds herself
the unwitting obje "How does love work? No one knows," Wolska said.
"Love just strikes every which way and you can't control it The play say
"How does love work? No one knows," Wolska said. "Love just strikes
every which way and you can't control it.... The play says that human sex
uality is complex and it accepts it — it doesn't judge it."
The capricious quality of love is further illustrated in this show by a cupid
figure (sophomore Larissa Eisenstein) who loiters around the stage at vari
ous points, stealthily aiming a bow and arrow at the oblivious characters
below.
What enables Cupid, along with a chorus of übiquitous (yet silent) mu
sicians, to constantly appear simultaneous with the main action of the plot
is one of the most unusual aspects of this production. A gigantic rake has
been built across the Mem Aud stage, meaning there is a steep incline slop
ing up toward the back of the stage. The rake allows multiple actors to per
form at once without upstaging or blocking one another.
"You can construct scenes on many levels and have simultaneity of char
acters, show what is happening in the back of the play and reveal the im

portant connection', v Iska said.
The rake itself is r t a new theatrical concept, but the peculiarity of this
rake is that it taper n point at the end, like a triangle, giving one the
sense of an endless r< | tiling away from the stage into uncertainty.
"This is a precar land governed by love and its many guises, associ
ated with chance, , ite, accident," said Wolska. "The precariousness
ot the land is mani' j m the steep rake. Because their lives are unstable,
like the forces of; wafting. Their world is not stable."
The rake also .ii, d lumber of technical advantages. "It's such a big
stage, it needed to I adc smaller by the rake," explained William Eddel
man, an associate | K sor in the Drama Department and the set's design
er. "It also allows p. • to see better and helps the voices to carry."
In a show with n. implication of voices, an enormous audience and
mostly young actor ound is a major consideration. "I think everyone
went into it a little i onfident alxiut their ability," said Regelmann. "Re
cently they brought x-ch coach in who basically ripped us apart and con
sequently whipped ito shape. Now we're enunciating madly. It sounds
like we all have braii i nage on stage, but out in the audience, you'll be able
to hear."
Many actors feel loss of subtlety when acting on such a large stage. "I
much prefer a sniali. jace," said Ly, who plays Olivia. "Here everything is
magnified 1 00 perc nd you're definitely losing some of the connections,
the relationships. Bui also allows you to be much crazier."
Senior Geoff Sotu who just finished a run of "Cowboy Mouth" on the
intimate Nitery stage 'i is month, agreed that acting on Mem Aud's main
stage was "Nuts. IV V er been on this big a stage before," he said. "The
space before you is si ge that the first time we started rehearsing out there,
I felt like I was acting a tiny raft floating beneath the prow of the Titanic,
ready to descend and inihilate. It just felt like something so much bigger
than you. The distan from floor to ceiling was like nothing I'd ever seen
before."
Sobelle plays Sir I iy Belch, the ringleader of what is often called the
subplot of "Twelfth Nicht." Olivia's uncle, Sir Toby is the life of the party, a
drunken carouser wht gathers his friends and goes to bat against Olivia's
moralizing killjoy of j - rvant Malvolio (junior Robin Moroney). While the
fun the revelers have at vialvolio's expense constitutes much of the play's hi
larity — watch for an ncredible clowning routine between Sobelle and se
nior George Mitchell a;. Fabian in the second half of the show — this aspect
also provides some of t he deepest pathos. Malvolic's suffering is perhaps the
sharpest contrast to any assumption of a purely comic text.
The other character wrho.se presence undermines the purported frivolity
of the play is the fool, I xte (Jarek Truszczynski). Wolska creates Feste as a
Beckett-influenced clovvn,a traveler with no destination. Through his pan
tomime, song and woniplay, Feste becomes our guide through the play, as
well as beyond it. "Festi doesn't really belong in any of these situations, he
maintains an ironk distance," Wolska explained. "The sadness in him
comes from the fact th.it he knows more than the others do about how im
permanent human i.(inflections are, about alienation. He is also in touch
with the absurd. With i este's entrance, we have the intrusion of the surre
al."
Some of the most ;jowerful moments in the production are Feste's
songs, when the action ireezes and artificiality overcomes any pretext of re
ality. The music itsell imposed by Doug Fulton, is haunting. Feste's per
formance is accentuated by some of the most sophisticated lighting designs

ever used at Stanford, which seem to transport the audience into a world re
moved from the logical progression of plot and scene.
"Unlike most theater, the lighting in this case is not based on realism,"
said Michael Ramsaur, the lighting designer. "The lighting takes its cues
from the emotions of the scene, it is very fanciful." Sometimes the stage is
bathed in fuschia. At other moments, the stage benefits from psychedelic
effects.
"Twelfth Night" is the first show on campus to use automated light fix
tures, which senior Chad Bonaker, the assistant lighting director, described
as "easily 16 times more complex than what we had before." The comput
erized fixtures allow designers to incorporate shape, color and movement
into the lighting, adding diversity and innovation to the look of the show.
Bonaker explained how the advanced lighting system connects with the
idea behind performing this show for the 60th anniversary of Mem Aud.
"This production is a revival of the first Twelfth Night,' but it takes the old
ideas and gives it a sense of now, integrating tradition with new ideas and
new technology. This is the show they first did, but 1 guarantee they didn't
do it like this," said Bonaker.
Lighting isn't the only area in which classical theatrical norms were set
aside for this show. Using Mem Aud's main stage has created the opportu
nity for "a total spectacle," according to Martuscello. "All the designers are

loving it, they can do anything, it's a dream," she said.
Warren Travis, the play's costume designer, said lie elected to mix peri
ods to get away from the idea of a period play. "We tried to costume each
character in a period that becomes them. We've chosen the period to suit
the character rather than force all the characters into one period," said
Travis. Some characters seem to belong in Renaissance or 18th -century at
tire, others in Medieval garb.
The design of the set, which began last July, has similarly evolved into
what Eddelman terms "a more post modern approach" than most Amen
can theater going experiences. "It doesn't stick to a particular style or f>eri
od, it's really a collage," said Eddelman of the set. "C )nce you begin to break
it apart stylistically, it's almost like modern art, the audience has to analyze
and use their imagination a bit. Some will say they hated it, some will say
they loved it, and some will say, at least 1 was stimulated."
If it sounds like Kddelman is exaggerating, picture topiary hedges, cut
into shapes of a giraffe, swan or rabbit, moving across the stage. ()r a char
acter entering through a giant cardboard replica of Spain's Infanta. Or the
attack by an enormous dragon made of suitcases.
"We need to experiment," Eddelman said. "We could always do some
thing sale and boring. We need to open people's eyes. I'm not saying it's al
ways going to work, but it's not going to be traditional Shakespeare."

"This is a precar land governed by love and its many guises, associ
ated with chance, , ite, accident," said Wolska. "The precariousness
ot the land is mani' j m the steep rake. Because their lives are unstable,
like the forces of; wafting. Their world is not stable."
The rake also .ii, d lumber of technical advantages. "It's such a big
stage, it needed to I adc smaller by the rake," explained William Eddel
man, an associate | K sor in the Drama Department and the set's design
er. "It also allows p. • to see better and helps the voices to carry."
In a show with n. implication of voices, an enormous audience and
mostly young actor ound is a major consideration. "I think everyone
went into it a little i onfident alxiut their ability," said Regelmann. "Re
cently they brought x-ch coach in who basically ripped us apart and con
sequently whipped ito shape. Now we're enunciating madly. It sounds
like we all have braii i nage on stage, but out in the audience, you'll be able
to hear."
Many actors feel loss of subtlety when acting on such a large stage. "I
much prefer a sniali. jace," said Ly, who plays Olivia. "Here everything is
magnified 1 00 perc nd you're definitely losing some of the connections,
the relationships. Bui also allows you to be much crazier."
Senior Geoff Sotu who just finished a run of "Cowboy Mouth" on the
intimate Nitery stage 'i is month, agreed that acting on Mem Aud's main
stage was "Nuts. IV V er been on this big a stage before," he said. "The
space before you is si ge that the first time we started rehearsing out there,
I felt like I was acting a tiny raft floating beneath the prow of the Titanic,
ready to descend and inihilate. It just felt like something so much bigger
than you. The distan from floor to ceiling was like nothing I'd ever seen
before."
Sobelle plays Sir I iy Belch, the ringleader of what is often called the
subplot of "Twelfth Nicht." Olivia's uncle, Sir Toby is the life of the party, a
drunken carouser wht gathers his friends and goes to bat against Olivia's
moralizing killjoy of j - rvant Malvolio (junior Robin Moroney). While the
fun the revelers have at vialvolio's expense constitutes much of the play's hi
larity — watch for an ncredible clowning routine between Sobelle and se
nior George Mitchell a;. Fabian in the second half of the show — this aspect
also provides some of t he deepest pathos. Malvolic's suffering is perhaps the
sharpest contrast to any assumption of a purely comic text.
The other character wrho.se presence undermines the purported frivolity
of the play is the fool, I xte (Jarek Truszczynski). Wolska creates Feste as a
Beckett-influenced clovvn,a traveler with no destination. Through his pan
tomime, song and woniplay, Feste becomes our guide through the play, as
well as beyond it. "Festi doesn't really belong in any of these situations, he
maintains an ironk distance," Wolska explained. "The sadness in him
comes from the fact th.it he knows more than the others do about how im
permanent human i.(inflections are, about alienation. He is also in touch
with the absurd. With i este's entrance, we have the intrusion of the surre
al."
Some of the most ;jowerful moments in the production are Feste's
songs, when the action ireezes and artificiality overcomes any pretext of re
ality. The music itsell imposed by Doug Fulton, is haunting. Feste's per
formance is accentuated by some of the most sophisticated lighting designs

ever used at Stanford, which seem to transport the audience into a world re
moved from the logical progression of plot and scene.
"Unlike most theater, the lighting in this case is not based on realism,"
said Michael Ramsaur, the lighting designer. "The lighting takes its cues
from the emotions of the scene, it is very fanciful." Sometimes the stage is
bathed in fuschia. At other moments, the stage benefits from psychedelic
effects.
"Twelfth Night" is the first show on campus to use automated light fix
tures, which senior Chad Bonaker, the assistant lighting director, described
as "easily 16 times more complex than what we had before." The comput
erized fixtures allow designers to incorporate shape, color and movement
into the lighting, adding diversity and innovation to the look of the show.
Bonaker explained how the advanced lighting system connects with the
idea behind performing this show for the 60th anniversary of Mem Aud.
"This production is a revival of the first Twelfth Night,' but it takes the old
ideas and gives it a sense of now, integrating tradition with new ideas and
new technology. This is the show they first did, but 1 guarantee they didn't
do it like this," said Bonaker.
Lighting isn't the only area in which classical theatrical norms were set
aside for this show. Using Mem Aud's main stage has created the opportu
nity for "a total spectacle," according to Martuscello. "All the designers are

loving it, they can do anything, it's a dream," she said.
Warren Travis, the play's costume designer, said lie elected to mix peri
ods to get away from the idea of a period play. "We tried to costume each
character in a period that becomes them. We've chosen the period to suit
the character rather than force all the characters into one period," said
Travis. Some characters seem to belong in Renaissance or 18th -century at
tire, others in Medieval garb.
The design of the set, which began last July, has similarly evolved into
what Eddelman terms "a more post modern approach" than most Amen
can theater going experiences. "It doesn't stick to a particular style or f>eri
od, it's really a collage," said Eddelman of the set. "C )nce you begin to break
it apart stylistically, it's almost like modern art, the audience has to analyze
and use their imagination a bit. Some will say they hated it, some will say
they loved it, and some will say, at least 1 was stimulated."
If it sounds like Kddelman is exaggerating, picture topiary hedges, cut
into shapes of a giraffe, swan or rabbit, moving across the stage. ()r a char
acter entering through a giant cardboard replica of Spain's Infanta. Or the
attack by an enormous dragon made of suitcases.
"We need to experiment," Eddelman said. "We could always do some
thing sale and boring. We need to open people's eyes. I'm not saying it's al
ways going to work, but it's not going to be traditional Shakespeare."

"So full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical" — Orsino
Ulyria, the mythical setting of Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night," suggests
the presence of illusion and delirium in its very name. ITiis week, the Drama
Department will commemorate the 60th anniversary of Memorial Audito
rium's construction with a visually fantastical voyage into the heart of that
imaginary world.
Director Aleksandra Wolska and a collection of professional designers
have proposed a challenge to the audience — and to "conventional Shake
spearean theater — by incorporating surreal and darker aspects into what
others might play as a straightforward romantic comedy.
"There is a lot of fun and merrymaking (in the play)," said Wolska, a
Drama Department graduate student who dnected " Hie Inspector Gener
al" last fall. "But at the same time there is havoc and suffering. Love has a
ridiculous aspect but it also has a dark facet and there is a deep sadness in it."
The central story of "Twelfth Night" follows a shipwreck, in which iden
tical twins Viola and Sebastian are separated, each presuming the other
dead. To get her bearings in the unfamiliar country where she lands, Viola
(played by junior loya Martuscello) disguises herself as a man and offers
herself as an attendant to the governing Duke of Illyria, Orsino, with whom
she promptly falls in love. Orsino (freshman David Joseph Regelmann? is
himself ruled by love for a neighboring countess, Olivia (junior Doan Ly),
who — in mourning for her dead brother—will not grace the smitten Orsi
no with the time of day. When Viola, concealing herself as the male "Ce
sario," visits Olivia to plead her master's love-struck case, she finds herself
the unwitting obje "How does love work? No one knows," Wolska said.
"Love just strikes every which way and you can't control it The play say
"How does love work? No one knows," Wolska said. "Love just strikes
every which way and you can't control it.... The play says that human sex
uality is complex and it accepts it — it doesn't judge it."
The capricious quality of love is further illustrated in this show by a cupid
figure (sophomore Larissa Eisenstein) who loiters around the stage at vari
ous points, stealthily aiming a bow and arrow at the oblivious characters
below.
What enables Cupid, along with a chorus of übiquitous (yet silent) mu
sicians, to constantly appear simultaneous with the main action of the plot
is one of the most unusual aspects of this production. A gigantic rake has
been built across the Mem Aud stage, meaning there is a steep incline slop
ing up toward the back of the stage. The rake allows multiple actors to per
form at once without upstaging or blocking one another.
"You can construct scenes on many levels and have simultaneity of char
acters, show what is happening in the back of the play and reveal the im

portant connection', v Iska said.
The rake itself is r t a new theatrical concept, but the peculiarity of this
rake is that it taper n point at the end, like a triangle, giving one the
sense of an endless r< | tiling away from the stage into uncertainty.
