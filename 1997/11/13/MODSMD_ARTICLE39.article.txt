# Memorial Auditorium Gets a Face Lift

When the doors to Memorial Auditorium open for pen <r
mance, a few members of the audience might experience just a hint <>t c
vu. "Twelfth Night" was the first production ever performed in Meni And
when it was completed in 1937, and this year's 60th anniversary akl ra
tion coincides with the Drama Department Alumni Reunion weekend.
But this time, Mem Aud will greet them with $3 million worth ot im
provements.
This summer's extensive renovation of Memorial Hall — the building
across from Hoover Tower that houses both Mem Aud and the Little! he
ater —serves for many as a tribute to the construction, over half a century
ago, of an extraordinary college auditorium.
"This building was really a special building," said Wendell Cole, 'pro
fessor emeritus in Drama. "Most colleges didn't have anything com ua
ble when it was first built."

Memorial Hall was built as a memorial to students, staff and faculty
who were killed during World War 1, but plaques have since been added
with names from the second World War and the Korean and Vietnam
Wars. Stanford needed a building that could handle large-scale dramatic
productions, symphony and orchestra performances and speakers ranging
in recent years from Mikhail Gorbachev to Alice Walker.
"Mem Aud at that time seated 1,700: it was larger than the Curran or
the Geary theaters in San Francisco," said Cole. Now, he says, Mem Aud —
at 40-feet wide — is just a little bit smaller than the San Francisco Opera
House. "We used to have operas each year," said Cole, "for which you need
a space this size, since there are large choruses, large casts and lots of scene
changes."
These days, the Drama Department rarely mounts shows in Mem Aud,
as the majority of productions take place in the smaller Little Theater, the
Nitery or Eleanor Pressor Studio. But Cole recalls, "We used to do as many
as 10 shows a year on Mem Aud stage. Of course, everything was a lot
cheaper. In the '30s and '40s, when this was built, you could do a tremen -

dous amount on a very small budget, but you certainly can't any longer."
The $3 million budgeted for this year's renovations were allocated by
the Provost's Office. One of the major additions was a custom-made or
chestra pit elevator that rises to become an extended apron for the stage.
Wheelchair-accessible bathrooms were constructed in the foyer, more
space for wheelchairs was made available inside the theater, and ramps for
easier disabled access were built in the front and back sides of the building.
Med Aud's exterior was pressure washed, restrooms were renovated,
and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems were improved. Re
painting and re-carpeting took place in the auditorium, the lobby, the
green room and the lecture room.
The refurbished Mem Aud may host more drama productions in com -
ing years, but mounting shows on such a large scale always poses a greater
expense. The special "Twelfth Night" production was partly made possible
by a gift from the President's fund. In addition to the performance, re -
unioi participants ire invited to a disco dance party with the cast of
"Twelfth Night" after the performance on Saturday night.
