## 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
It is an unlikely connection: the popu
lar card game Uno and homelessness.
However, making unlikely connections
is one of the things the campus humor
magazine Chaparral does best.

This weekend the Chaparral is spon
soring an Uno marathon that will donate
money to Comic Relief, a nonprofit or
ganization dedicated to helping the
homeless.
Donors will pledge money to partici
pants — composed of both Chaparral
staff and other fun-seekers — for each

hour of Uno played.
"It's a silly-sounding fund-raiser, so
we had to do it." said Chaparral Presi
dent Santos Marroquin. a junior.
However, Marroquin pointed out
that the"I ino-thon" is not just about fun
and games. Preparing for I I Nino,
Comic Reliel will use the money raised

to purchase water-repellent ponchos,
hats and other protective clothing for
San Francisco homeless.
"It's some of your time lor a good
cause, and its not hard labor," said Mar
roquin.
