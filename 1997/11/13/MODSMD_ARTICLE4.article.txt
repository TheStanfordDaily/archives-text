# Uno marathon to benefit SF homeless
## 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
It is an unlikely connection: the popu
lar card game Uno and homelessness.
However, making unlikely connections
is one of the things the campus humor
magazine Chaparral does best.

This weekend the Chaparral is spon
soring an Uno marathon that will donate
money to Comic Relief, a nonprofit or
ganization dedicated to helping the
homeless.
Donors will pledge money to partici
pants — composed of both Chaparral
staff and other fun-seekers — for each

hour of Uno played.
"It's a silly-sounding fund-raiser, so
we had to do it." said Chaparral Presi
dent Santos Marroquin. a junior.
However, Marroquin pointed out
that the"I ino-thon" is not just about fun
and games. Preparing for I I Nino,
Comic Reliel will use the money raised

to purchase water-repellent ponchos,
hats and other protective clothing for
San Francisco homeless.
"It's some of your time lor a good
cause, and its not hard labor," said Mar
roquin.
Stanford is one of eight universi
ties nationwide participating in the
first-ever College Uno Marathon.
II the Stanford community raises
more money than any of the other
participating universities, Comic
Relief will send a headliner from its
comedy show, such as Robin
Williams or Whoopi Goldberg, to
perform on campus.
Homclessness is serious busi
ness. but the Chaparral staff plans
to keep the game fun. "IJno is a
pretty entertaining card game il
you're high enough," said Marro
quin.
Encouraging all to attend, he

proclaimed that everyone will
have a good time. "Everyone loves
Uno," insisted the enthusiastic
Marroquin. "Who doesn't love
Uno?"
For those people who do love
Uno, all they need is to donate, or
get their dormitory to donate, a
small amount of money to com
pete. The Uno marathon, starting
Friday at 8:00 p.m., will run all
weekend at the Storke Publica
tions Building.
Non-players can also contribute
to the cause by pledging money to
the players. Chaparral staff visited
dormitories yesterday to raise
pledge money.
The staff will continue to collect
money for the next couple of weeks
and will be visiting more dormito

lies next Wednesday.
Phis is not the 112 irst charity work
sponsored by the Chaparral. "The
Chappie has done some charity
work in the past, and we wanted to
continue the tradition," said Chap
arral Business Manager Marc
Mezvinsky, a sophomore.
A few years ago, the Chaparral
distributed literature about infant
mortality in Eastern European
countries and helped raise money
for public health care and econom
ic reform advocacy in those coun
tries.
Despite its community service
work, the Chaparral staff spends
most of its time producing its bi
quarterly humor magazine. The
next edition should be coming out
soon, Marroquin said.
