## The 						Apples in Stereo Tone Soul Evolution 
### 
The big question for indie rock these days,
as well as for all modern art, is "Where do we
go next?" Artists have rebelled against every
thing oppressive and broken down every bar
rier, and now everyone is standing around
waiting for a new direction to appear.
While Sonic Youth writes 10-minute static
collages and Tricky composes endless ab
stract trip hop, The Apples in Stereo believe
that music's real salvation has been and al
ways will be the three-minute ecstasy of pure
pop.
The band's new album, "Tone Soul Evolu
tion" turns the clock back to the psychedelic
60s, when people like Brian Wilson and Phil
Spector spent hours in the studio turning
sugary love songs into exquisite bursts of
aural pleasure, tweaking each hook until it
reached divine perfection.
What's really surprising, though, is how
well it works. Robert Schneider, the band's
songwriter, has the incredible ability to create
perfect imitations of the best songs by the
Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Kinks and the
1 lollies, while maintaining a sound that is all
his own.
More importantly, there's never the slight

est hint of post-modern irony — the only way
you can tell this is retro pop is to look at the
release date.
From the first song, there's no doubt that
you're in the hands of a master of the genre.
"Seems So" bounces sweetly through the
story of a UFO sighting, rejoicing in the per
fection of its melody.
"What's the #?" rocks a bit harder and then
"Shine a Light" arrives in a burst of glory, re
plete with an irresistible hook, handclaps and
the catchiest chorus this side of "I Wanna
Hold Your Hand."
In the meantime, the sensuous harmonies
and wistful melancholy of "About Your
Fame" could almost be an outtake from the
Beach Boys classic "Pet Sounds." "Tin Pan
Alley" has the same sort of sadness, but is pro
pelled by an energetic guitar riff that sounds
surprisingly like a banjo.
However, the album's greatest triumphs
are its two all-out excursions into psyche
delia. "Silver Chain," written and sung by
drummer Hilarie Sidney, is a scintillating
swirl of arpeggiating guitars and "ba ba ba"
lyrics that is so beautiful that it invokes a kind
of despondency. "The Silvery Light of a

Dream" answers in epic fashion, mixing
sound effects, a Robert Fripp guitar riff and
spiraling harmonies that beg you to put on
those bulky headphones your parents were so
proud of.
"Tone Soul Stereo" has two flaws, however,
that keep it from being a perfect album. The
first is that it drags a bit at the end. "Try to Re
member," "Find our Way" and the useless
"Coda" seem a too much like derivative
clones of Beach Boys songs, and they don't
have the same vitality as the others.
The second flaw is in the philosophy itself.
Just because all this sugar tastes great, doesn't
mean it's good for you.
The paradox of the continuing popularity
of the sweet psychedelic music of the 60s is
that it is popular precisely because it doesn't
correspond to the social upheavals of the
time, it creates a fantasy world of sun, surf
and summer — a nostalgia for a time that
never happened.
Still, even the grumpiest social critic will
have a hard time resisting the urge to put on
the headphones, crank up The Apples and
wait for the next evolution.
