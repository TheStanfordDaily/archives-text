# Get in SHIFT
## 
### 
After hearing the first two tracks on this
album, my first question was, are these guys
trying to be like Offspring? And my second
question was, why?
Sporting the same heavy, distorted guitars
and strained yelling for vocals, Shift is trying to
capitalize on the same novelty of an almost
heavy-metal sound and clever lyrics that pro
pelled Offspring into the mainstream limelight
a few years ago.
This band doesn't have nearly the same in
terest value as Offspring's catchy though repet
itive guitar refrains and dismally humorous
lyrics. Shift seems to have a few gritty guitar
chords down pretty well, but not enough to

propel the group beyond garage-band status.
I guess I could imagine these guys playing at
a frat party or something of the same caliber,
but beyond that, the group just isn't mature
enough in its musical abilities. The constant
shouting of lyrics and repetitive guitar chords is
such that it's really hard to discern one song
from the next.
It's really kind of a shame, because some of
the lyrics hint at a budding cleverness, although
a lot of the album comes off sounding preten
tious. Basically, the band takes itself too seri
ously.
Songs with titles like "The best song I ever
wrote," "In honor of myself" and"I want to be

rich," will broadcast a serious ego trip, no mat
ter how much self-mockery might be intended.
"In honor of myself" does include a decent
guitar solo, but it's nothing spectacular. And
one solo doesn't help the song get any better, es
pecially because the chorus spurts nonsense
like, "Running back and falling down / in
honor of myself again / running down and
falling back / in honor of myself."
Many of the songs are some variation on the
traditional strained mad love theme. Vocalist
Joshua Loucka sings on "Dizzy," "I know you
think you know what I want /1 know you like
the way I'm upside-down, mixed up all over
you / I'm weak-kneed, head-over-heels cause I

fell for you, I fell for you /1 get dizzy (pretty
baby)."
The band at least keeps a good beat, and
Loucka does pull off tone variations in his
singing, as opposed to merely shouting his way
through the album. The better parts come
when the guitars aren't playing, though, and
the beat slows down. Otherwise the album
sounds like one big mess of guitar distortion
and feedback, with some percussion thrown in.
Loucka sings, "I want to be rich / beyond
my wildest dreams" — an admirable aspira
tion, I suppose — but he'd better plan to realize
his dream outside of the music industry.
