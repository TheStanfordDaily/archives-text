# U.S. Aliens captain T

### 
Rock and roll has a long legacy of cannibalizing itself. A
number of the Beatles and Rolling Stones early hits were cover
songs. Van Halen got its first commercial break by recording
the Kinks' "You Really Got Me." And Oasis has built a career
by stealing licks from the Beatles.
In recent years, however, remakes have developed a new di
mension; while cover songs used to be made as homage to a
band's roots, they are now often chosen solely for potential
shock value — hence, the Lemonheads accelerated "Mrs.
Robinson," Cake dulled "1 Will Survive" and Marilyn Manson
dirtied "Sweet Dreams." Unfortunately, like young brats beg
ging for attention, these songs got airplay.
In this tradition, the four-piece band Captain T has re
leased a techno-rock version of "We Are The World" on its
new album "U.S. Aliens." Those of us who own Duran Duran
on CP would be advised to avoid this track.
Not much is still sacred in popular music, but one wonders
what might be next. A trip-hop version of "Sweet lane?" A

lounge version of "Anarchy in the U.K.?" An adult-contem
porary version of "Layla?" (00p5... Clapton already did that
himself).
Unexpectedly, Captain T finds a way to work a groove into
Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie's familiar, stale melody. As
for the song's contemporary shock value, the 1980s died off
years ago when Kurt Cobain named this decade's definitive
song after a deodorant marketed for teenagers.
Furthermore, Michael lackson (whose "Dangerous" was,
of course, symbolically knocked out of the No. 1 spot on the
charts by "Nevermind") did not exactly become a role model
after the days of "We Are The World."
Nevertheless, the song does deliver an interesting surprise
by fitting nicely into the album's overall theme, a mixture of
extraterrestrial theories and government conspiracies. As the
cover declares, "You'd be paranoid too if everyone was trying
to kill you."
Instead of being a plea to end world hunger, "We Are The

World" becomes a ominous warning about alien abductions.
Lyrics such as "There comes a time / when we heed a certain
call / when the world must come together as one / there are
people dying" are cast in a brand new light.
Unfortunately, the aura surrounding "We Are The World"
overshadows the rest of the album, which features some un
expectedly melodic heavy metal. On "America's Free" and
"Disturbing Abduction," the band flexes some significant in
strumental muscle. More importantly, on tracks like "Aqua
Blue" and "Banner," Captain T reveals an ability to mix some
eloquently softer moments with hard rock.
Although "U.S. Aliens" is consistently strong musically, the
album suffers from its short playing time.
Nonetheless, clocking in at just more than 25 minutes, the
work walks that fine line between an EP and a LP, which is un
fortunate as the public rarely gets excited about albums with
only six songs.
