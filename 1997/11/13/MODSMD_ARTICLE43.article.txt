# Tear It Up: The SKA Album Floyd Lloyd
## 
### 
I wish everyone who battles over
which of the three waves of ska is
the best would shut up and listen to
Floyd Lloyd. On "Tear It Up: The
SKA Album," Lloyd expertly com
bines strong first-wave horn or
chestrations, the energy of two
tone and a third-wave edge. The re
sult is a record that would make
even the grouchiest person skank.
Lloyd and crew kick things off
with "Big City," a swing-inspired
ska tune that reflects Lloyd's strong
ties to lamaican greats such as Lau
rel Aitken, Tommy McCook and
Don Drummond.
The tune is catchy, the beat is
strong and the mood is set for a col
lection of musical fun: exactly the
thing for the discriminating ska
tan.
The horn section rocks us with
"Jesse Jackson," a cut that is as
modern as anything the Scoftlaws
or the Toasters would provide. The

ska beat is nicely emphasized by the
bass, by the horns and by Lloyd's
scatting. Though the lyrics are sim
ple, the music is enough to carry
the listener happily skanking to
ward the title track of the album.
"Tear It Up" revives the two-tone
era in its straightforward horn
solos, positive energy and sing
along chorus.
Lloyd keeps it going with "West
ern Special," the American frontier
twist of the Train to Skaville. Amid
rather odd train and bullet sound
effects, Lloyd and friends execute a
musically tight showcase of instru
mental talent that juxtaposes the
movie theme sound of "High
Noon" and"The Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance" with classic rude
boy ska.
Though "Spin on Your Head" is
nothing special, "Bye Bye" is a root
sy tune that shows us where Dr.
Ring-Ding got his style. Its first

wave feel leaves the listener content
but ready for something a bit more
modern; Lloyd fortuitously pro
vides with "You're For Real," a reg
gae powerhouse complete with
echo effects and Marley-like emo
tion.
"I'll Take You Home" demon
strates the ska-injected soul of
many of the early Jamaican artists,
complete with characteristic simple
progressions and cheesy lyrics.
Sadly, it just never achieves the spir
it that Lloyd is aiming for.
However, this is more than com
pensated for with "Ska Party," one
of the most upbeat songs on the
album. !n "Ska Party," the discern
ing listener finds references to the
Maytals, the Skatalites and Sir Cox
sone Dodd. Lloyd does them all
proud.
The end of the album is disap
pointing. The final two tracks,
"Easy Times" and "Game Wav," re

veal Lloyd's interest in the evolving
dub style. These tunes are decent,
hut not catchy. 1 feel like he was fol
lowing a formula for dub and creat
ing songs that are musically articu
late but devoid of feeling. The
album could have ended four songs
early.
Taken song by song, Lloyd
doesn't provide the infectious ska
that one would expect. But as an
album, "Tear It Up" is definitely a
great effort. Take the time to listen
to the hour of musical expertise
that Lloyd and backing bands Pota
to Five, Red Cloud and the New Or
leans I a/7. Stars provide. The beau
tiful synthesis of elements both old
and new will have die-hard tradi
tionalists doing the ska alongside
madly skanking ska-punks, groov
ing soul brothers and dancing
swing kids. Lloyd definitely de
serves our respect.
