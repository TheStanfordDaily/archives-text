# Living it all wrong Lee Feldman
## 
### 
As Dorothy Parker once said in a review,
"What fresh hell is this?"
Lee Feldman — wonderful pianist, beautiful
lyricist, innovative songwriter — needs to stop
singing.
His voice is Mr. Rogers meets They Might Gi
ants, Hilly Joel, Beck and Barry Manilow, with
just enough Broadway musical song #299
thrown in to be annoying.
If someone else were singing on this album,
all would be well with the world. I would happi
ly give "living it all wrong" three or four stars,

and we could all go about our days and nights
feeling happy that one more starving musician
has "made it"and can finally join the ranks of
beauties like Fiona Apple alter years of failed at
tempts to be "a name" in"the industry." Hurrah!
And we would all to bed.
However, what makes Lee Feldman such a
good songwriter for a singer type of song is that
the music draws the attention of a careful listen
er toward the lead singer. The background music
is pure accompaniment for the voice, thus the
music and the singer enhance each other. If ei
ther one is not up to par, the whole (beautiful)

structure falls to pieces.
This album falls to pieces over and over again.
The introduction music to each song raises your
hopes, and Feldmans voice slaps you in the face.
1 can imagine hearing these songs in a movie
soundtrack while watching the movie — loving
them until I got home and listened to them again
with no visuals to distract me.
On the positive side, Feldman has an uncan
ny sense of how to make a piece relaxing anil chill
yet emotionally charged at the same time. His
lyrics are simple, in the way that children's songs
have simple lyrics, but the themes his songs por

tray are mature, with just enough humor to be
cute. Here's my favorite lyric: "If 1 were you, I
would love me. I'm not as bad as I seem 11 go to
sleep and I dream, just like everybody else
does / If you were me, you'd be lonely. You
wouldn't know what todo / And you'd lie think
ing of you, and you'd miss yourself, I know you
would."
It you have the courage to ignore voices and il
you like good lyrics and harry Manilow, l-eld
man may well be the man lor you to go out and
buy. You will not see me in the (!l) store.
