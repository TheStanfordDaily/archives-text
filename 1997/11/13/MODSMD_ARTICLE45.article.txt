# I Know What You Did Last Summer: The Album Various Artists
## 
### 
There is always something comforting about
popping an album into your stereo and singing
along to tunes that are brand new yet somehow
familiar. "I Know What You Did Last Summer"
has this effect. A psychotic pastiche of punk,
rockabilly, electronic and rock provides some
thing for everyone.
Kula Shaker kicks off the album with "Hush,"
a bouncy blend of easy-to-remember choruses,
pleasing keyboard solos and a strong bassline.
One of the best songs on the soundtrack, it is not
only musically articulate, but also is the kind of
cut you suspect had even the engineers bopping
during the recording session.
Type O Negative is up next with its emphasis
on guitar and bass, slow pace and surreal quali
ty. Though the band isn't bad, the preceding en
ergy of Kula Shaker leaves the listener wanting
something more. The droning repetition of one
simple chord progression loses its relaxing effect
and becomes positively lethargic by the end of
the five-minute-long "Summer Breeze."
Luckily Offspring revives the listener with
"D.U.1." Though this is not one of the band's best
offerings, the catchy chorus and repeatable lyrics
are enough to make this track a worthwhile ad
dition to the album.

Similarly, when Soul Asylum dives into "loos
ing It," one has the sense that although it's a de
cent tune, its very obviously Soul Asylum, re
calling tracks like "Somebody to Shove" and
"Keep It Up" too closely.
The surprise of the album is Toad the Wet
Sprocket's remake of Lennon and McCartney's

"Hey Bulldog." Trying to
beat the BeaUes is usually
a foolish effort, but Toad
proves its worth in its ren
dition of this hard-rock
ing classic. The band stays
true to the original, but
does add its own energy
and musicality, yielding a
track that is terrific, albeit
quite a bit louder than
typical Toad.
In a nod to less main
stream music, Southern
Culture on the Skids boo
gies through the speakers
with "My Baby's Got The
Strangest Ways." Employ
ing a Mancini-like
bassline, Southern Cul-

ture electrifies the listener with its strutting com
bination of psychobilly and surf. One of the truly
unique songs on the album, "My Baby" is deli
ciously close to a spoof, but still retains all the el
ements of the best "serious" tracks.
"I Know What You Did Last Summer" is not
just a showcase for big-name bands, but also a

variety show of unknowns. While these tracks
are decent, none stands out. (ireen Apple Quick
Step and Mick turn out ho hum alternatunes.
The I Jin Pedals inspire the listener to wail along
with them on "Waterfall," but this is due more
to the prevalent Radiohead influence than to
the band's own style.
Goatboy and I looverphonic have the same
problem — decent songs with no real spark of
creativity. The catihy familiarity of many of the
better trades on the album is transformed into
the"been there, done that" sound of many of
these obscure cuts
"I Know What You Oid I-ast Summer" is a
perfectly decent album. Like most soundtracks,
it provides a few gems, a few losers and a lot of
middle-of-the-road efforts. Its greatest flaw is
the track order. Jumping from style to style
with little regard for the mood created by the
previous song is disconcerting and frustrating.
If the listener is willing to deal with this annoy
ance and tolerate some less-than-worthwhile
tracks, the album can certainly provide a pleas
ing listen.
