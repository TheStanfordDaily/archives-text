## Starship Troopers 
### 
Even the snootiest cultural critic has to
admit that cartoons are a lot of fun. Who can
deny the enjoyment in a world of bright col
ors, cardboard characters, simple love and
nasty monsters? Given that enjoyment, I'd
be hard-pressed to find a movie more car
toonish than "Starship Troopers." Everyone
has fun, the good guys win, and uniformed
men and women do a lot of shooting. How
can you beat that?
Paul Verhoeven clearly knows what he
wants out of this movie — a return to the
dramatic war movies of yesteryear, a casting
away of today's "moral" questions. It begins
with a sort of propaganda film, a newsreel
style report on how the war against the evil
civilization of the Bugs is faring, a war
spurred by an unprovoked Bug attack on
Earth.
The first encounter with the Bugs — a
"live" slaughter of the news anchor — is a
succinct microcosm of the rest of the movie:
a plastic-looking character, extras running
around in confusion, uninspired cine
matography and the most visually stunning

creatures ever placed on the big screen. The
short glimpse is enough to whet our ap
petite for more Bugs, and the transition into
the alleged plot of the movie isn't much of a
distraction.
The movie tracks the paths of a group of
trim, happy high school friends — Rico
(Casper Van Dien), Carmen (Denise
Richards) and Carl (Neil Patrick Harris) —
in a future world run peacefully by the mil
itarized Federation. Michael Ironside
("Top Gun") is a veteran political science
teacher who manages to inspire these
youngsters to join the military, fight the
Bugs and, more often than not, die like
flies. And that's, more or less, the story: a
fairly bland, straightforward tale of cannon
fodder.
When the fighting starts, though, the
movie gets fun. The Bugs themselves are in
credible feats of computer-generated effects,
moving with astonishing speed, fluidity and
ferocity. The sheer numbers of their attacks
make for half a dozen heart-stopping battle
shots as they mow down the hapless Earth-

lings — and, boy,
do they mow. This
movie will go
down, if nothing
else, as the bloodi
est flick of the era.
Hardly two min
utes go by without
a soldier being
ripped limb from
limb, being decapi
tated, being dis
solved by acid, hav
ing his brains
sucked out, being
nuked; you name
it, they do it to
these poor slobs.

Between the brilliance of the effects, the
well-placed sexual subplots (Verhoeven di
rected "Basic Instinct" and "Showgirls," and
he hasn't forgotten the lessons he learned
about gratuitous nudity) and the rather
staggering carnage, "Starship Troopers"
manages to totally mask its obvious lack of

character or dramatic tension. In a cartoon,
it would be a work of genius; in a two-hour
movie, it's mindless fun. The Bugs are far
more compelling stars than the humans,
and they steal the show with style. The
movie's worth every penny, just to see them
at work.
