# Mad City

### 
The picturesque town of Made
line, California in "Mad City" is al
most too perfect. So when a laid-off
museum security guard named
Sam Baily (John Travolta) threatens
his former boss with a Remington
rifle, the fragile balance of the town
is upset and a media frenzy erupts.
Therein lies the basic idea behind
director Costa-Cavras' latest effort.
Though "Mad City" most likely will
not garner as much praise for
Costa-Gavras as "Z," winner of two
Oscars in 1969, it remains a worthy
effort comprised of issues highly
relevant to today's TV-fueled cul
ture.
Reporter Max Brackett (Dustin
Hoffman) has looked for the big

story to get him back to prime-time
news coverage. The crazed Baily
provides him with the hook, line
and sinker: Brackett finds himself
caught in a hostage situation inside
the Museum of Natural History.
Hoffman perfectly plays Brackett
whose despicable and immoral de
termination to garner attention
largely overshadows his electric
personality.
Among the captives are curator
Mrs. Banks (Blythe Danner) and an
assortment of kids on a field trip.
The children view the situation
with wide-eyed curiosity and
naivete, often playing games and
listening to stories with Baily. In
contrast, a hardened Banks finds

the ordeal torturous and often
pushes Baily to release the youths.
This unstable atmosphere inside
the museum forces Baily to lose
control, which increases the film's
levels of tension and intrigue.
Brackett's assistant during the
ordeal is intern Laurie Callahan
(Mia Kirshner). She quickly learns
the ropes of broadcasting — she is
told by Brackett to never lose sight
of the story at any cost, and she du
tifully follows the advice. It is fasci
nating to watch even the most inno
cent kid-on-the-block turn greedy
for juicy tidbits on the hottest news
in the nation.
Threatening Brackett's hold on
the exclusive is Kevin Hollander
(Alan Alda), the hot-shot veteran
from New York. Hollander desper
ately wants to bury Brackett be
cause of a past interview between
them. Brackett's boss, Lou Potts

(Robert Prosky, "Veronica's Clos
et"), has little say in the matter, and
soon Hollander gains possession of
the story. And, with the passive
local Sheriff Alvin Lemke (Ted
Levine) slowly handing power over
to the trigger-happy FBI, the "mad
city" of Madeline is pushed to the
brink.
Costa-Gavras has recreated the
fervor and insanity of high-profile
news stories of this decade: the OJ
Simpson trial, the Waco siege and
the Atlanta bombing immediately
come to mind. When, exactly, does
the media cross the line between
objectivity and ratings-hungry sen
sationalism?
By unmasking the people behind
tabloid television, "Mad City" takes
a bold step with its impartial state
ment about the sad condition of
American journalism.
