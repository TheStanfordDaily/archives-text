# Slaves to the Underground
## 
### 
A lesbian man-hater, a zine producing
slacker male and a limp dishrag of a woman
who can't quite figure out her sexual orien
tation are the three characters that are sup
posed to embody Generation X in "Slaves to
the Underground," a film that continually
reaffirms the stereotypes it attempts to break
down.
The film revolves around Shelly, played by
newcomer Molly Gross, a confused, twenty
something who wants to find herself and
fight for"the cause." Never explicitly defined,
"the cause" probably has to do with youthful
idealism: solving world hunger, establishing
racial and gender equality, ending oppres
sion and the like. Such issues of potential so

cial and personal importance arise through
out the film, hut as they are generalized and
largely undefined, their impact is lost.
On breaking up with her boyfriend
Jimmy (Jason Bortz), Shelly joins an all-girl
rock band called the No Exits and becomes
involved in a relationship with the band's
lead singer, Suzy (Marisa Ryan). The rela
tionship proves to offer Shelly little emo
tional satisfaction, and she returns to Jimmy.
Jimmy, who originally refers to Bill Gates as
Satan, eventually sells his soul and goes to
work for Microsoft in order to provide
Shelly with material comfort. Shelly, apa
thetic to the pain she causes those who love
her, leaves Jimmy again and continues soul

searching on her own. Overall, Shelly is pre
sented as a soft-spoken bimbo, whose only
redeeming quality is sex appeal. Shelly's in
difference about her chaotic life proves con
tagious, and it is difficult for the viewer to
empathize with her.
Honest, unadulterated emotion is occa
sionally spoon fed to the viewer throughout
the course of the film, as each of the charac
ters has a brief confrontational scene with
the audience. These scenes successfully pro
vide insight into the character's minds, but
further emphasize the limitations in the rest
of the film.
Two redeeming qualities salvage the film
and maintain the viewer's interest: the music

and Suzy. The film features appropriately
harsh, punk rock by Stone Fox, Starfish, Ani
Difranco and Suzie Gardner from L7, and the
music conveys the powerful emotions that
the characters fail to express. Suzy's energy as
the lead singer, her spontaneity, strength and
occasionally maternal attitude toward Shelly
also add much needed emotional depth.
"Slaves to the Underground" attempts to
define the youth of the 90s, a goal that in
evitably lends itself to stereotyping. Howev
er, unemotional acting and a predictable
plot brimming with diched characters ulti
mately fails to define anything except for a
nonexceptional film.
