Fire, fondue and Frances O'Connor's per
formance can't save "Kiss or Kill" from medi
ocrity. The Australian thriller is the latest ef
fort from director Bill Bennett, who also
wrote and produced the film.
"Kiss or Kill" follows Nikki (O'Connor)
and Al (Matt Day), a couple whose small
time scam takes a deadly twist. Nikki picks up
married men in bars, lures them to hotel
rooms and spikes their drinks. Then her re
form school sweetheart Al helps her clean out
their wallets.
It's a tidy operation — the men rarely re
port the crimes. But one of Nikki's marks
dies, leaving behind a videotape of his friend,

aging football star "Zipper" Doyle, climbing
into bed with a young boy.
Nikki and Al head for the plains of West
ern Australia followed by two detectives who
want them for the perceived murder. As the
body count rises at each stop, Nikki and Al
start to suspect each other of the killings.
Subtle this is not. Having somehow
missed the theme in countless crime films,
Bennett wants to show how little we all really
know each other. Lest we overlook this bit of
profundity, he gives plenty of hints. One
amusing scene shows how little the detec
tives, well-played by Andrew S. Gilbert and
Chris Haywood, really know the details of

each other's family lives.
The threadbare concept isn't the film's
only problem. Bennett spoon-feeds his view
ers the suspicion that both Nikki and Al are
capable of murdering the men.
The film's opener shows a 4-year old Nikki
watching a man set her mother on fire. Logi
cal result: Nikki grows into a manic depres
sive who hates men and fire. When her sleeve
catches on fire from a fondue warmer, Nikki
lashes out at her waiter, who later turns up
dead. She's also a violent sleepwalker.
Al has a matching dark side. He's a loose
cannon, apt to rough up truck drivers who
hog the road. He also sti indiscriminately
and without always telling ..k!;i.
O'Connor's perfotman as the hard but
child-like Nikki is so mature it's hard to be
lieve she only made her feature film debut in
"Love and Other Catastrophes" (1996). Her
ability to act giddy with affection for Al one

moment and consumed with suspicion the
next carries the film a long way. O'Connor
shines in spite of the film.
Bennett's pretentiously jagged editing is as
annoying as his heavy-handed philosophy. In
one scene, he shows a cheap picture of the
ocean hanging over a motel bed, then cuts to
the real ocean. Maybe there is a grandiose
message to be found about imitation vs. life,
but it only brings to mind Bennett's last film,
the bland "Two if By Sea" starring Sandra
Bullock.
Bennett does make good use of stark land
scape shots. He's also not a victim of the I 10l
lywood soundtrack frenzy: "Kiss or Kill" is
tune-free, allowing his characters to take
over. But the whole concoction is tepid, and
Bennett takes no chances with the ending.
