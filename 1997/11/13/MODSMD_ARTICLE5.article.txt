# A 						wink, a smile and, with a little luck, a date
## Flirting expert Talley insists that starting a relationship isn't that difficult 
### Nicole Kidd 
Some stu
dents may agree

with former soci
ology professor
Jerry Talley that
dating at Stanford

is like "starving to

death in the land

of plenty." But

Talley insist
ed that it's

possible to find
a date on the
Farm through

* methods other
than "Screw
Your Room
mate.'"

Luckily for

those who
wish for a

reason to
"sex-ile"

their

room-

mates, Talley. who has received several
degrees from Stanford, has spent years
becoming an expert on the art ol
courtship and is generous enough to
share his wisdom with the Stanford
community.
"Flirting is a lost art on campus."
Talley lamented. Sitting in Junipero
lounge Monday night, T alley proceed
ed to educate about 30 freshmen on the
finer points of flirting. For romance
starved students, there are only four
simple rules to effective flirting, I alley
said.
"Good flirting is inviting without
being demanding," Talley began. "It
should never involve pressure or coer
cion." The ideal flirt leaves a potential
date with an easy and polite way to turn
down the offer. Talley said. This not
only makes you look skilled and tactful
to people who are definitely interested,
he noted, it saves you from being
slapped in the face bv people who defi
nitely aren't.
"Good flirting is an ongoing series of
invitations and counteroffers," accord

ing to I alley's second tenet. I le offered
an example: You coyly mention you've
been on campus lor two weeks and still
haven't received a lull tour: she says she
knows the area well and loves to show
people around; you tell her you're Irec
on Saturday. In flirting. I'alley empha
sized, "neither party is ever forced to
say ves unequivocally."
"(iood flirting leaves the other per
son feeling flattered whether they take
you up on it or not," I alley preached.
For example. I alley said, indicate your
interest in a woman by saying to a her
that whoever gets to be her boyfriend
would be the luckiest man on earth.
"(iood flirting means you are willing
to clarify your intentions," I alley con
cluded. He empha? zed the need to let
the other person know ol your willing
ness to make the next step. I alley cau
tioned against leaving the other person
wondering, "Are you flirting with me or
are you just flirting?"
If I alley's formula sounds nice but
you're still paralyzed by the thought ol
approaching a total stranger, take com-

suggested thai
friends are
often the best
sources ol inti

mate relation
ships. even

though moving
from being

11 lends to lovers is

often confusing.
"Sexual ten

sion is ;i simple
fact in relation

ships." I alley
said. He ad
vised that you

accept it and
deal with it
openly. After

all, Talley
pointed out.

them as attractive?
II you want to move beyond basic
friendship, followTalley's next set of
tactics. "To flirt, break the rules of
the 'friendly hug,'" Talley advised.
I le suggested giving a longer or clos
er hug than usual, sitting closer to
the other person and leaning on
their shoulder. These are subtle cues
that allow a friend to respond by ei
ther reciprocating or ignoring what
you're doing.

Talley's presentation was well
received by the Junipero residents.
Laughing, freshman Alexandra De
Zwart admitted she had fun being
pulled to the front of the room to
help Talley demonstrate flirtatious
body language. She and her dorm
mates joked that after hearing Tal
ley's talk, flirting lias almost lost
some of it's subtle ambiguity for
now, everyone will be on the look
out for the tricks Talley mentioned.
"I'm glad he was straightfor
ward," said freshman Michal Paster
nak. "I hadn't thought about flirting
as rules before."

Peter( astorena.alsoa freshman,
said that although he'd certainly
thought about all the ideas in the lec
ture, lie doesn't usually rely on spe
cific flirting techniques to meet girls.
"You just talk to girls... you put
yourself out there and see what they
say," he said.
But that may be hard advice to
follow 011 a campus where many stu
dents see relationships as just anoth
er time commitment. AsoneofTal
ley's students once explained. "A re
lationship is like a four- or five-unit
class. I'm already taking l l > units, so
I can't handle it right now."
