Normally films don't gross over
$ 100 million at the box office before
even opening in America. But who
said Mr. Bean was normal? This out

rageously abnormal character's new
film "Bean" has proven not only his
own abnormality, but also his im
mense popularity. Rowan Atkinson,

who plays Bean, is easily one of the
funniest actors alive, and now he has
successfully made the transition
from British television to interna
tional cinema.
Having seen almost all of Bean's
television skits in "Mr. Bean," I was
afraid that the movie would just be
an endlessly long compilation of all
of the show's old jokes. Even though
some of Bean's best jokes are recy
cled for this film, these scenes arc
kept so brief that they remained
funny. Someone made a good deci
sion by not trying to overextend the
film's length. At 91 minutes, "Bean"
is short but very sweet.
The plot is fairly straightforward.
Bean is a guard at the British Nation
al Museum. His blunders would
have cost him his job a long time ago
if it were not for the fact that the mu

seum's chairman thinks very highly
of him. The members of the board
do not think so highly of him and in
order to get rid of bean, they decide
to send him on an assignment to I.os
Angeles, where he will represent the
British as Dr. bean, an art expert. He
will be responsible for accompany
ing "Whistler's Mother," a $50 mil
lion painting that has recently been
purchased by an American philan
thropist.
Being Bean, everything around
him quickly turns into a disaster,
first he wrecks the family who's
hosting him, and not much later, he
manages to destroy the priceless
painting. By the end of the movie
however, Bean has somehow man
aged to save the lives of two people,
restore the painting and fool the
public into thinking that he's a ge
nius.
This innovative story contains
many new Bean-jokes, making it a
worthwhile movie to see, even if

you've never missed a single televi
sion episode. During one of the fun
niest parts, Bean, who has just ar
rived at the LA. airport, decides to
tool the police into thinking that he
is carrying a gun. They go on a wild
chase through the airport, and even
tually the joke's on the police when
Bean publicly mocks them. It's hard
to describe Bean's particular humor,
but believe me when I say it's tunny.
The other actors did a great job
working with Atkinson. The fact
that everyone but Bean is playing his
or her role with great seriousness
only enhances Atkinson's visual
humor.
In the end, I find it hard to say
whether this film will really appeal to
the American public. Bean talks for a
total of about three minutes. How
ever, if you've enjoyed watching"Mr.
Bean" on television, you'll probably
enjoy seeing him on the big screen as
well.
