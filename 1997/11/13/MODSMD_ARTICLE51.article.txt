# SICK: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist
## 
### 
Hanging suspended from the ceiling of a
Los Angeles art gallery with weights dangling
from his testicles, Bob Flanagan grins down at
onlookers below. He is an artist, an artwork, a
live exhibit, a human spectacle, and he has
cultivated his unique talent to the extreme.
Bob Flanagan laughs in the face of pain.
An unblinkingly honest documentary,
"SICK: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan,
Supermasochist" forces us to explore this
man's extreme capacity for suffering and to
examine at the same time the limits of our
own inner strength. The film weaves together
intimate aspects of Flanagan's life as a perfor
mance artist, an S&M enthusiast and a man
who has been sick for his entire life with cys
tic fibrosis. The disease causes digestive prob
lems and constant pain, and it inflicts a
painstaking, suffocating death.
Having spent most of his life expecting to
die and constantly in and out of hospitals,
Flanagan has understandably developed an

extreme relationship with his body. He has
come to terms with the pain of his illness,
which he must passively endure, through the
self-infliction of a different kind of pain, a
pain which he enjoys. A pain he can control.
Flanagan likes to be spanked, stuck with
pins, cut, choked, burned and pounded with
nails. Aiding him in these and countless other
rituals is partner and sadist Sheree Rose. Giv
ing and receiving of pain is mingled with af
fection, and the strange intimacy and devo
tion between the two is striking.
It's all striking because the intuition of
filmmaker Kirby Dick makes it so. He guides
the camera into the innermost details of
Flanagan's life. Dick's incredibly shocking
footage of human suffering has spared us
nothing; we have been brutally assaulted by
the reality of the mental and physical pain of
the disease of another person. And it is in
credibly effective.
This film could have left us feeling nothing
but horror and disgust and pity for this sick

person. Instead we are somehow inspired.
Most would consider a lifestyle masochist to
be sort of a weak, sniveling and pathetic per
son. Flanagan points out that it actually takes
an incredible amount of inner strength to
know the limits of one's own body so well.
Dick's all-inclusive filming technique helps us
to somewhat fathom this strength.
Hut why? Why would someone do this to
himself? Why didn't he just go into therapy
like everyone else? In his public presentations
Flanagan unabashedly answers the questions
of the horrified and the awestruck. Me recites
from his own writing, .. because it flies in
the face of all that's normal (whatever that is);
because I'm not normal.. . because my par
ents loved me even more when 1 was suffer
ing; because I was born into a world of suffer
ing. .. because it is an act of courage; because
it does take guts; because I'm proud of it; be
cause I can't climb mountains..
