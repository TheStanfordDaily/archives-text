Warren Miller's still got it.
After 47 years of making highlight reel style ski (and snow
board) movies, his 48th, "Snowriders 2: The Journey Contin
ues," managed to impress me with its new twists and loca
tions. The 73-year-old Miller may not make any more than 50
films, and I implore you — catch one of the next two if you
haven't ever seen a Warren M'lltr movie.
Warren's voice adds much to what might otherwise just be
a skier highlight movie. Th; basic setup of his movies are
pretty simple: send camera crews with the best snowriders of
the world to exotic locations and film every minute of every
crash and every jump. Peter Speek, the director of the films
since Warren gave up the reigns, chooses his cuts and his
music well.
During the opening sequence, I decided that it has been
way too long since I've dusted off my skis and headed for the
mountains. Warren, with his dry wit and somewhat flat tone,
instilled in me an unshakable desire to tumble around in the

snow. Lake Tahoe, here I come.
The unshakable longing for powder just got stronger the
rest of the way through the movie. During the next hour and a
half 1 alternated between bouncing my feet along with the
mogul skiers, oooh-ing at big air, aaaah-ing at big powder,
wincing at big diggers and becoming increasingly jealous of
people that get paid to live out my dreams in places as exotic as
Kazakhstan.
My favorite line in the movie came while the skiers were hit
ting the "Volkswagen-sized bumps" in Winter Park. Warren
explained that all we have to do to become as good as his skiers
is to "quit whatever job [we] have now... get a night job and
then ski six or seven days a week for the next eight to ten years."
Is that it?
Next up on the list were mountain bikers in British Colum
bia. Warren again: "Remember when you go for big air [on a
mountain bike]... [in a falsetto] never be sitting down when
you land." It was hilarious in a nice, juvenile way to watch in

credibly brave idiots ride down the mountain and crash in hu
miliating ways.
The new twist in this movie that entertained me were the re
cent appearance of new ways to snowride. This year there were
mountain bikes, kayaks, windsurfing boards and body bags.
Yes, body bags. And where else but Los Angeles would people
zip up the old body bag and throw themselves down the side of
a hill with less than two inches of snow on it? I know you want
to see this, 1 just do.
And next time I see a Warren Miller movie, I think I'll pick
a better location. Towne Theater in San lose was fine, but only
half a house came. 1 want to see his movies like I remember
seeing them in high school, with a full pack of rowdy snow
lovers.
No matter what, though, see either this or one of the next
two movies. If not for pure love of snow, then for Warren, who
might be retiring soon.
