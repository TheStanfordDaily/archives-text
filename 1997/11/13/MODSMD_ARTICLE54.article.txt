## The
						Nixons The Nixons 
### 
The Nixons latest release brings the group
a big step closer to becoming a heavy-hitting
success. Before this can happen, though, the
band is going to have to figure out what it
wants from its music.
On this self-titled album, The Nixons
switch-hits between quality grunge and corny
pop music — and throw in a couple of power
ballads to boot. Not that I mind the diversity.
I just don't like the teeny-bopper hard rock
that comes across on songs like "Miss USA,"
which talks about vanity in the United States.
Sometimes one song like that can spoil the
whole album.

But other tracks reveal that the Nixons can
write good, original rock n' roll. "Baton
Rouge," "Screaming Yellow" and .. at the
Sun" are three solid songs that would rally a
crowd at any live performance.
You can hear the influence of producer
Toby Wright on these tracks. Wright engi
neered Alice in Chains' albums, and he gives
the Nixons the same thick and heavy guitar
sound. Like Alice in Chains, the Nixons end
up with a great sound that makes its endless
power chords tolerable.
Power chords don't dominate everything,
though. The Nixons show some real musi

cianship — even on "Miss USA" there is a
fretless bass track that carries its own
melodies and motifs. "The Fall" is a power
ballad that verges on corn, but saves itself by
virtue of the interplay between singer, bass
and drums.
"Shine" is probably my favorite track:
after a few minutes of power-ballad, the song
hits a mellow groove that combines bass,
drums, guitar, keyboard and trumpet.
"Shine" shows that these guys have plenty
more to offer than the pop-grunge and
power-ballads that dilute much of the
album.
The Nixons should focus on the good
stuff and go for quality, not quantity. Jesse
Davis, the guitarist, said the band's goal "was

to have 20 or 30 songs to choosc from." That
may work fine it you're trying to play at frat
parties. But if you want people to spend $15
on an album, you can't just record 80 min
utes of filler music. The only songs that
count are the ones that are the great.
Now that the Nixons have 30-t songs,
maybe the band will start cultivating ideas in
stead of its repertoire. There's plenty of po
tential for a five-star album — it's got musi
cianship, originality and energy. The band
just needs more of these things. It is a matter
of refinement now, of pushing to a higher
standard. Once the group does that, the pop
pish-rockish songs are sure to get the burial
they deserve.
