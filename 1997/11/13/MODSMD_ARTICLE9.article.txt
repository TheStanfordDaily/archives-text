### Terry Hwang 
A committee of Stanford faculty members awarded
Turgut C iur, associate director of the Center for Mate
rials Research, the Marshall D. O'Neill award yester
day for his undying support of Stanford research.
The award, first presented in 1990, acknowledges
staff members "for exceptional and enduring support
of Stanford University's research enterprise." Each re
cipient also receives a check for $2,000. In past years
the committee has recognized a wide range of Stanford
staff, from research administrators to librarians.
(iur, hired as a technical director in 1990, has since
guided the center through many triumphs and tribula
tions.
"In my mind, he's the hidden hero of ("MR," said
Malcolm Beasley, the director of'the center. "He's very
insightful about the organization of projects and con
sistently insists on a high level of excellence and fair
ness."
The center has experienced many challenges in the
past few years involving budget cuts, layoffs and prob
lems with its research facility. "Those of you who have
been with ('MR will remember 'the flood,' the 'power
outage' and 'the second flood,' " said Beasley with a

chuckle. (iiir's insight into the strengths and weakness
es of various research tools and his help in renovating
the lab has put the center hack on the cutting edge of
materials research.
Funded entirely by the National Science Founda
tion. the center works closely with Stanford faculty on
projects concerning the behavior and properties of var
ious materials, Gur himself holds two patents in re
search related to solid-state electrochemistry.
"He really displays an unfailing sense of academic
values," said Beasley. "He's always harder on himself
than on colleagues."
In addition to the $2,000 check, the selection com
mittee last night presented Gur with a certificate signed
by University President Gerhard Casper. An addition
al surprise was the appearance of Gur's two sons who
flew up from San Diego to congratulate their father.
The committee chose Gur for the annual award
from an initial nomination pool of 55 staff members. In
a break from past trends, the committee decided to
limit the award to one extremely qualified nominee.
"This award will always have a special place in my
heart," said Gur. " This room is full of people who have
enriched my life on a personal, social and professional
level."
