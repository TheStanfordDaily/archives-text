# Changes to Draw proposed
## Housing report suggests more freshman housing, resident tutors 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
Reformatting the housing Draw
and creating additional all-freshman
housing are among the suggestions
made by the Task Force on Residen
tial Programs and Student Housing
for Undergraduates in a report to be
released today.
The task force laid out several
goals in making its recommenda
tions, including greater integration
between academics and residential
life and greater differentiation of re
sources by year.
Among its other recommenda
tions were redefining resident fel

lows' roles, forming a freshman /
sophomore residential cluster and
creating "resident tutor" positions
that would be filled by graduate stu
dents.
The report was prepared over a
six-month period by the 16-person
task force, which included four stu
dents and four former RFs.
"Because so many of us have
been involved in dorm life as either
students or RFs, we felt that we had
a good grasp of the housing issues at
hand," said Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ramon Saldi
var, chair of the committee.
Win, lose or Draw

Among the proposals in the re
port are several ways to improve the
housing Draw.
Instead of having two preferred
years — with Draw numbers from 1
to 2,(KX) — and one unpreferred year
— with Draw numbers from 2.001 to
3,(XX) — the report proposes estab
lishing a system with one preferred
year and two guaranteed years. In
the preferred year, the student
would have a Draw number from 1
to 1.2(X); in the guaranteed years, the
Draw numbers would be from 1.201
to 3,6(X).
The proposed system is designed
to ensure that, for at least one year,
students will have the chance to live

in one of their top housing choices.
Another possible change would
have the Draw conducted in rounds.
After groups drawing S(H) and lower
are assigned, each remaining group
can rearrange its choices based on
what housing is left open. The same
process would be followed alter each
set of S(H) numbers.
The report also proposes giving
students the option of keeping their
Draw group together, even if it
means dropping down to a lower
housing preference. Currently, even
a group that draws a relatively low
number such as 3(H) is sometimes
