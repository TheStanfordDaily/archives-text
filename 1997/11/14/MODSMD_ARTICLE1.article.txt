# Changes to Draw proposed
## Housing report suggests more freshman housing, resident tutors 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
Reformatting the housing Draw
and creating additional all-freshman
housing are among the suggestions
made by the Task Force on Residen
tial Programs and Student Housing
for Undergraduates in a report to be
released today.
The task force laid out several
goals in making its recommenda
tions, including greater integration
between academics and residential
life and greater differentiation of re
sources by year.
Among its other recommenda
tions were redefining resident fel

lows' roles, forming a freshman /
sophomore residential cluster and
creating "resident tutor" positions
that would be filled by graduate stu
dents.
The report was prepared over a
six-month period by the 16-person
task force, which included four stu
dents and four former RFs.
"Because so many of us have
been involved in dorm life as either
students or RFs, we felt that we had
a good grasp of the housing issues at
hand," said Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ramon Saldi
var, chair of the committee.
Win, lose or Draw

Among the proposals in the re
port are several ways to improve the
housing Draw.
Instead of having two preferred
years — with Draw numbers from 1
to 2,(KX) — and one unpreferred year
— with Draw numbers from 2.001 to
3,(XX) — the report proposes estab
lishing a system with one preferred
year and two guaranteed years. In
the preferred year, the student
would have a Draw number from 1
to 1.2(X); in the guaranteed years, the
Draw numbers would be from 1.201
to 3,6(X).
The proposed system is designed
to ensure that, for at least one year,
students will have the chance to live

in one of their top housing choices.
Another possible change would
have the Draw conducted in rounds.
After groups drawing S(H) and lower
are assigned, each remaining group
can rearrange its choices based on
what housing is left open. The same
process would be followed alter each
set of S(H) numbers.
The report also proposes giving
students the option of keeping their
Draw group together, even if it
means dropping down to a lower
housing preference. Currently, even
a group that draws a relatively low
number such as 3(H) is sometimes
split up ii there is only space for part
of the group in their preferred
house.
Another proposal suggests in
creasing the number of choices stu
dents can rank on their Draw prefer
ence sheet. The current limit is eight.
The report also recommends
adding the options of "any self-oper
ated Row house" and "any coopera
tive Row house." This would acco
modate students who wish to live on
the Row but have no strong prefer
ence for a particular house.
Freshman housing
Oi.. motivation for creation of
the committee was to respond to in
creasing demand for all-freshman
housing.
This year, 1,100 freshman re
quested all-freshman housing, but
only 700 slots were available, ac
cording to Saldivar.
The report proposes both in
creasing the number of all-freshman
dorms and forming freshman /
sophomore residential clusters.

These clusters would provide ad
ditional staff and resources for fresh
men and sophomores, including the
implementation of a "residential life
curriculum." Freshmen who lived in
these clusters would be encouraged
to return as sophomores, creating a
continuity and sense of community
over the first two undergraduate
years.
"We know that the first two years
are crucial to development," said
Saldi'var. "We always knew that the
freshmen needed additional re
sources, but we've been finding out
that sophomores also need distinct
support."
The report suggests alterations in
residential staffing, including a shift
in the role of the RFs. Their role as
"crisis managers" would be turned
over to the residence deans, so that
RFs could focus on the academic life
of the dormitory. This would include
both specific planned programs and
general academic mentoring.
RFs would also receive addition
al resources in the form of summer
salaries, sabbatical accrual credits
and refurbished living quarters,
which are perks enjoyed by faculty
in similar positions at Harvard and

Yale universities.
The new position of resident
tutor would be filled by graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows,
who would live in the dormitories
and aid the RFs in the academic de
velopment of the residence.
Class distinctions
A major focus of the report is the
allocation of different types of re
sources to students at different stages
in their academic development.
"This report has helped us deter
mine what students need at each
stage of their university life," said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya. "It will help us dis
tribute resources more evenly."
This means greater numbers of
staff and advisers in the freshman
and sophomore residences. Advis
ing associates, who now do not nec
essarily live in the same dormitories
as the freshmen they oversee, would
live with their advisees.
For upperclassmen, the proposal
means more career planning and
long-term mentoring, as well as the
implementation of a residential hon
ors program to aid students doing
honors work.

What's next?
Montoya and Saldivar — along
with an implementation team com
posed of administrators, faculty
members and students — will be
charged with evaluating and imple
menting the proposals.
"We won't be able to do it all at
once," said Saldivar. "It has to be
prioritized and will be implemented
over a two- or three-year period."
Some changes, however, should
be in place much sooner than that.
"We do hope and expect to have
several of these proposals active by
this fall," said Montoya.
The task force was formed last
fall by University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice, who felt that a reassessment of
the residential system was necessary
in light of recent changes in the un
dergraduate curriculum. Programs
such as Stanford Introductory Stud
ies and Sophomore College were
designed to strengthen Stanford's
focus on the first two years of under
graduate education.

The new position of resident
tutor would be filled by graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows,
who would live in the dormitories
and aid the RFs in the academic de
velopment of the residence.
Class distinctions
A major focus of the report is the
allocation of different types of re
sources to students at different stages
in their academic development.
"This report has helped us deter
mine what students need at each
stage of their university life," said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya. "It will help us dis
tribute resources more evenly."
This means greater numbers of
staff and advisers in the freshman
and sophomore residences. Advis
ing associates, who now do not nec
essarily live in the same dormitories
as the freshmen they oversee, would
live with their advisees.
For upperclassmen, the proposal
means more career planning and
long-term mentoring, as well as the
implementation of a residential hon
ors program to aid students doing
honors work.

What's next?
Montoya and Saldivar — along
with an implementation team com
posed of administrators, faculty
members and students — will be
charged with evaluating and imple
menting the proposals.
"We won't be able to do it all at
once," said Saldivar. "It has to be
prioritized and will be implemented
over a two- or three-year period."
Some changes, however, should
be in place much sooner than that.
"We do hope and expect to have
several of these proposals active by
this fall," said Montoya.
The task force was formed last
fall by University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice, who felt that a reassessment of
the residential system was necessary
in light of recent changes in the un
dergraduate curriculum. Programs
such as Stanford Introductory Stud
ies and Sophomore College were
designed to strengthen Stanford's
focus on the first two years of under
graduate education.
