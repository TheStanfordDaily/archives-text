AIDS cure dimmed
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
drug "cocktail" that revolution
ized the treatment of AIDS is
unable to wipe out reservoirs of
virus hiding in certain blood cells,
researchers find in a discovery
that dims hopes for a cure.
The finding means that
patients may have to take the
AIDS drugs for the rest of their
lives — while hoping for new
types of treatment to stamp out
the final traces of infection by the
virus that causes the disease.
Three separate teams ol scien
tists reported finding evidence
that the HIV virus lurks in inac
tive white blood cells in patients
who have been taking the drug
cocktail lor up to three years and
seem otherwise virtually free of
the virus.
Two papers, by researchers
from four different laboratories,
will be published today in the
journal Science. Another paper,
by scientists at the National Insti
tutes of Health, will be published
later this month in the Proceed
ings of the National Academy of
Sciences.
Combinations of drugs that
block two enzymes that the HIV
virus uses to reproduce have
been enormously effective in
stopping the infection. In thou
sands of patients. HIV virus in
the bloodstream has been
reduced to near undetectable

levels, and CD4 blood cells, the
principal target of HIV. have ral
lied to normal levels.
The success of the drugs raised
hopes by some experts that HIV
could be eradicated completely
from the bodies of patients.
Dieters warned
ATLANTA (AP) — Dieters
who have used fen-phen or
Redux for any amount of time
should see their doctor and get a
physical exam, even if they feel
fine, the government said yester
day.
The advice comes two months
after fenfluramine — the "fen" in
the diet drug combination fen
phen — and Redux were pulled
from the market because they
had been linked to potentially
deadly heart valve damage.
Previously, the government
had recommended that dieters
who had shortness of breath and
other symptoms of heart damage
after taking the drugs should
have an echocardiogram, a pain
less test that uses sound waves to
get a picture of the heart in
action. Hut the government had
no advice lor those who appeared
to be fine.
"( onsumers have been calling
in and doctors have been calling
in asking. What are we supposed
to do now?"' said Dr. Murray
Lumpkin of the Food and Drug
Administration.
