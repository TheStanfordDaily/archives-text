## Editorial Playing it safe with e-mail Paying attention 
### 
Incident reminds us
that careful examination
of e-mail is critical.

AN E-MAIL WAS distributed cam
pus-wide last week warning
women and men that a gang of
Mexican youths from East Palo Alto was
sneaking into women's cars at area gas sta
tions and then forcing them to drive to
remote locations.
According to the e-mail, this initiation
rite required the members to rape the
women and "take a souvenir." Women
were warned not to leave their cars
unlocked when they paid for gas. because
that was when the attackers supposedly
snuck into the cars.
The e-mail proved to be a hoax.
As alarmist, racist and sexist the e-mail
message may have been, the recent incident
is not an example of problems intrinsically
wrong with electronic message distribution
and notification. The system is an appropri
ate avenue for notifying students, faculty
and staff of important subject matter, not
only events 011 campus but also other infor
mation including warnings that could
impact their safety.
This hoax demonstrates the need to
exercise judgment when reading messages,
to critique them closely before sending
them along to the next person or distribu
tion list.
Although the many senders failed to
check the authenticity of the message, its
most likely that the intent was not mali
cious.
While the message contained explicit
stereotypes and generalizations, its warning
immediately caught the attention of many
readers. It named three local gas stations,
the Palo Alto Shell at Lytton Ave. and
Alma, the Menlo Park Unocal lb on El

( amino Real and another in Menlo Park,
as targets of the gang and warned women lo
be careful.
Despite its language and tone, it hinted
at a potential harm that could have impact
ed a significant part community if it had
been true. II the message was valid, e-mail
would have provided an efficient mecha
nism for disseminating the information.
The e-mails that circulated campus sev
eral weeks ago about the Ansell condom
recall demonstrate this point.
What's different about last week's mail
is that it contained misinformation, and
people seem to be processing these results
differently.
To people who were offended by the
message's content, we encourage you to
think about the vital information that
you've received electronically. It's easy to
respond to this event by criticizing the sys
tem, which is overall, very valuable.
To those people who saw the message
and responded to it in an effort to debunk
its validity and to use the situation as an
educational tool, we applaud your efforts it)
increase people's awareness of the harms
associated with spreading information with
out checking sources and perpetuating
broad generalizations and stereotypes.
lo the people who blindly sent it along
without thinking about the content and/or
offensive tone, we implore you to critique
messages you receive. Not all mail is
authentic and can cause more harm than
good, as demonstrated by this event and
others last year at Stanford as well as other
universities.
I lowever you feel about this event, look
at it as a lesson in taking your share of
responsibility for managing electronic
information.
Discriminate 111 pressing "control X" or
"send," and ensure that you don't inadver
tently perpetuate abuse of a system in
which the advantages clearly outweigh the
disadvantages.
