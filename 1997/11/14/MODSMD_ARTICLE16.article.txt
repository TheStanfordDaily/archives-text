## Sweetening the sting of the police 
### 
My rapidly
FADING park
ing sticker did
me no good on Tuesday
because some maniac who
gets off giving impover
ished Stanford students
parking tickets (K. Bryan,
badge number 80742)

found me in violation of 21113(a) of the Cal
ifornia Vehicle Code: Non-designated park
ing.
Granted, I was parked on a curb, but it
wasn't painted red. There were no signs say
ing that I couldn't park there. I wasn't block
ing anybody, and there was absolutely no
place else to park. Thus I'm out $25. Is this
justice? As if my $30.(KH> a year isn't enough!
And now they're going to have police on
bike patrol. Though veiled as a PR move to
get better acquainted with students, the
police say they're going to crackdown on
bike rule enforcement, like stopping at stop
signs.
When's the last time you stopped at a
stop sign when you were running late for
your 1:15 p.m. class? Yes, bike safety is
important and perhaps the parking permit
system is the best it can be under current
space limitations, but couldn't and shouldn't
police resources be used in a more student
friendly way?
1 say yes. Why give a student a parking
ticket if they've paid $70 for the appropriate
permit especially when it is clear that there
were no other places to park? And what
good will giving tickets to bikers do? Writing
tickets will not make students safer bike rid
ers. II you're running late for a meeting or a
class, you're still going to just bike on
through those stop signs.
Though the intention of the police is to
encourage bike safety, writing students tick
ets will onlv breed resentment and create an

oppressive campus atmosphere. Nearly all
of us break these rules now and again, and
we'll continue to do it. hoping all the while
that we don't get caught.
Instead of lining students for their ratio
nal behavior, the police could better serve
the campus while improving police / student
relations by working with students to
address legitimate campus concerns.
Let's start with smokers. It's bad enough
that occasionally we have to sit next to
smokers in class and try and concentrate on
the lecture while holding our breath because
of their stench. But once I have to inhale
even the tiniest bit of their awful habit just
because they're walking in front of me and
the wind's blowing the right way. it gets per
sonal.
Though a campus smoking policy does
currently exist, it isn't widely known and is
thus ineffective. Instead, Stanford should
quickly move to adopt and aggressively pub
licize a strict no smoking policy effective
everywhere on campus, particularly for
places like the CoHo where it's nearly
impossible to sit outside if you value your
health.
Biker cops, as they work to improve rela
tionships with students, could enforce this
policy, ripping cigars and cigarettes and
pipes out of people's mouths as they cruise
by. Now that would be a good PR move,
helping rid the campus of those who light-up
at the expense of everyone else's health.
Non-smokers and police alike should active
ly work to socially stigmatize those who vio
late such a policy.
And then let's deal with another issue
that has become tacitly accepted as part of
the Stanford experience: bike theft. It's the
most pervasive crime on campus (sans what
the Bookstore does to us every quarter) and
yet nobody is actively doing anything to stop
it.

It should not he a fact of Stanford life that
you are very likely to have your bike stolen
durinii your tour years here. I don t recall
this issue being part of the ASSU Senate's
10-item agenda, but this is an area where
they could actually make themselves useful.
Because we can't expect the police alone to
tackle such a huge problem, student involve
ment is necessary. The Senate, in conjunc
tion with police, can form a committee to do
research aimed at identifying 1) areas on
campus that have the highest rates of bike
theft, 2) the most theft plagued times of the
year and 3) the time of day when such theft
usually occurs.
Perhaps funded by legitimate parking
ticket revenues, teams of students and police
could put these areas under surveillance,
staking out bike racks and kickin some bike
thief booty (awww yeah!). Bike thieves
come to Stanford because history has
proven they can get away with it. If we step
up and take some action, the word will get
out that Stanford students aren't taking that
crap anymore and thieves will go to Cal
instead.
We as students are the life of this univer
sity. We have the numbers and the power to
really have an effect, among other things, on
the quality of student life. Do we really want
the police to give us biking tickets? Do we
really want the police to give us parking tick
ets because the University doesn't have ade
quate parking space? Instead of giving more
tickets and sucking money out of us, how
about they do something constructive like
working with students to enforce a non
smoking policy or address rampant bike
theft? II you agree or have other ideas, call
the ASSU Senate at 5-1463 or the Stanford
police at 3-9633.
