Keep CroMent a grad dorm
It h;is conic to our attention that Resi
dential I ducation and Housing and Dining
Services is considering converting (Yothers
Memorial Hall, a graduate residence, into
undergraduate housing. Though we realize
no decision has yet been reached, we feel
strongK that this action would be ill-advised.
In its 43-year history, (Yothers Memorial
Hall has provided a home and outstanding
community lor generations of Stanford
graduate engineering students. Because it is
a dormitory rather than an apartment com
plex. CroMem encourages a closeness and
camaraderie that is not always found in
other graduate residences.
As graduate resident assistants, we have
taken advantage of the dormiton environ
ment to build a stronger community, foster
communication among different disciplines
and encourage discussion among the
"diverse cultures represented in CroMem.
In fact, manv students choose CroMem

specifically for these reasons, and that
choice is reflected in their housing lottery
selections: most CroMem residents listed
CroMem as their first option.
I ike C Yothers I lall for the School of Law
and Schwab Residential Center for the
School til Business. CroMem provides for
the School of Hngineering an environment
where graduate students can interact infor
mally and form social and intellectual bonds.
Neighbors who have been at Stanford for
years can provide advice on classes, qualify
ing exams. I'll.I), defenses and dissertations.
Furthermore, students at CroMem come
from a wide variety of disciplines, which fre
quent!) affords opportunities for sharing
expertise: mechanical engineers, for exam
ple. can ask an electrical engineer for help
on a circuit problem; an electrical engineer
can find a computer science major to help
with a programming problem. For many of
its residents, living in CroMem has been an
invaluable educational asset.
CroMem has a long history as a graduate
residence. It was founded in 11>54.l l >54. with

money willed by George Crothers, as a dor
mitory lot engineering students and has
housed graduate engineers ever since (but
for a brief period after the PW) Loma Prieta
earthquake, when roughly 15 percent of the
rooms were used for temporary undergrad
uate housing).
Many prior residents hold fond memo
ries of the dorm: a number return to visit the
dorm and to relive those memories. Tradi
tions. such as "Cool Ray Flicks" every
Wednesday evening, go back well over a
decade. (The actual Ray. who visited the
dorm last year, was very proud that the
event he started has remained over the
years.) The dormitory even has a business to
its credit: in the late 70s. a group of residents
founded a computer company they named
Cromemeo.
CroMcm has been and should continue
to be a graduate dorm with a continually
evolving history.
The future of CroMem should not be
considered a matter of concern merely to
graduate engineers. Making CroMem an

undergraduate dormitory would either lead
to the loss of graduate housing spaces or else
require the conversion of a corresponding
number of undergraduate spaces.
Reducing the number of graduate spaces
is unacceptable: already in this year's hous
ing assignments there was a record 51K) grad
uate students who sought but failed to
receive on-campus housing. Putting gradu
ate students into now-undergraduate spots,
on the other hand, would not be effective
either.
We have heard the Suites in Governor's
Corner and Mirrielees mentioned as possi
bilities. But unlike all current graduate hous
ing. the Suites provide no kitchen facilities.
And while Mirrielees consists of true apart
ments. they are onc-bedroom / double
occupancy, an option that has proven
unpopular in F.scondido Village. At the
same time, these resident-per-room accom
modations are among the most attractive
living arrangements for undergraduates,
who would find them replaced with pre
dominantly one-room doubles in CroMcm.

In short. Crothers Memorial Hall has
been a long-time asset to the graduate com
munity. and turning it into an undergraduate
residence would serve neither graduates nor
undergraduates well.
We encourage others to express their
opinions on this matter. To do so, contact
Jane ( amarillo, director of Residential Edu
cation. Keith (iuv. director of Housing and
Dining Services, or James Montoya, vice
provost tor Student Affairs. We are confi
dent that by communicating our concerns
we can find ways to improve the on-campus
housing situation for everyone.
