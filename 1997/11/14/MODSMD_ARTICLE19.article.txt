Angela and her mother got
on at Victoria station and sat down
next to me for the next four stops
to Euston. In that time, Angela told me all
about her school, her book report, her
teacher and showed me Sam, her new pet.
When she told me she wanted me to
meet him, 1 looked around and didn't see
anything resembling a leash, fur or feathers.
So 1 thought she was either going to make
me pantomime a handshake or pat the
cricket beeping in her pocket.
Sam was indeed the thing beeping, but
he was no more organic than my watch. He
was a Tamagochi, about six centimeters tall,
banana yellow and orange orange.
He was beeping a little as he walked
around on his microcosm of a computer
screen, ever so often leaving a little pile of
pixel poop that Angela mopped up by
selecting an icon and then pressing "B."
She told me how special he is, that she
always knows when lie's happy or sad. And
how when he's not feeling so well they play
games or she feeds him treats. That sounds
quite nice, 1 said, and then tried to flash a

grown-up secret-club smile at her mother.
But Angela's mother was behind a paper
headlined with something like "Louise
Woodward; Exploited Au Pair or Ruthless
Murderer?"
Meanwhile, Angela had moved on to
Sam's habits like how he needs to be fed or
at least acknowledged about every 30 min
utes or else he "gets bad." As a baby, Sam
beeped just to beep but Angela fixed him
through regular discipline sessions. And she
explained how they learned about nutrition
together. "1 always have to feed him, but
not too much because," Angela observed,
"the fatter he is, the meaner he gets."
I realized as she continued describing
their daily regime of arbitrary sleep, break
fast and play, that if she didn't take care of
the thing, he would croak and go off to
cyberheaven as a winged blob flitting across
the screen. Luckily, it is possible to reset and
hatch another egg. but I don't think Angela
realized this.
I suddenly took on a new respect for her:
Angela, the 7-year-old mother. At this point
in life, Sam would be my worst nightmare.

nut apparently lie s everyone else s
dream. A UK World Wide Web advertise
ment flashes a blue-light special: "Genera
tion 1 and 2 Tamagochis. NanoKitties, Pup
pies and Babies, Dinkv Dinos and Giga
Pets! Generation i in green, yellow, purple
only 21. i >9 pounds?*' What a bargain! Let's
pay a ludicrous sum for something that
requires vast amounts of superficial care in
order to Lilsely fulfill a need to nurture and
get programmed love in return.
It's ludicrous, that is, unless you're a lit
tie kid on a subway train, sitting next to
your mom who shakes her head and "tsks"
as she reads about neglectful parents and
exploited, convicted au pairs ami doesn't
notice as you stare out into the black of the
tunnel counting the bumps. At least it's not
ludicrous if everyone else has one or wants
one. and you can jack the price up during
the holidays.
There will be parents who go out this
December and fight their way through lines
at Toys R' Us to get their hands on the
promised gilt. It happens every year, and I
remember it well myself, crying for the red

haired, freckled Cabbage Patch lor $61.99.
I he next year it was Optimus Prime.
December is too often marked by wasted
energy and money and dysfunctional mes
sages about religion. It seems that the sole
thing gained is show-and-tell rights. And
with the ramagochi, wouldn't it be fun to
drop Angela ofl at school only to spend the
afternoon cleaning up Sam's little presents?
Neglecting a eyberpet is worse than killing
off a luck of the-scoop goldfish. they're
one in a tank of MX). Sam grows and cries
and follows a distinct program: no push but
tons, no live. Angela would eventually fig
ure out you'd pushed reset.
I've seen many owners, young and old
faithfully toting those Handai creations on
their key chains, confusing their mobiles
with the beeps ol their babv egg. Ilandai lias
a knack for exploiting our most sensitive
and vet stupid purchasing nerves, for exam
