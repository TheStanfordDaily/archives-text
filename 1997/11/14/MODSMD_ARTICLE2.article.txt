Solving problems in graduate
student housing should be a priori
ty for the University, members of
the Faculty Senate said yesterday.
Although no official decisions

graduate housing and the progress
of the Stanford Introductory Stud
ies Program.

Prof. Edward Mocarski, chair of
the senate's Committee of Gradu
ate Studies, said his committee has
not focused on graduate housing
but will in the future.
"Graduate housing has become
more of a problem, especially with
the price of rental housing going
up," he said.
Provost Condoleezza Rice men
tioned that the waiting list for grad
uate housing rose nearly 50 percent
for this quarter to 850, of whom
only 590 were accommodated.
Rice added that in the short term
the University must reconfigure its
housing allocation and, eventually,
must reconfigure Escondido Vil
lage and even build new housing.
Rice added that although cur
rent space for new housing is limit
ed. the recently passed Measure C)
will add more graduate student
housing. The measure, approved by
Palo Alto voters Nov. 4, allows the

University to build apartments on
Ohlone Field near Sand Hill Road,
as well as expand the road.
"Sand Hill will help, but we just
don't have the space to build right
now," said Rice.
Rice also introduced recommen
dations made by the Task Force on
Residential Programs and Student
Housing for Undergraduates,
which are being officially released
today. Those recommendations in
clude increasing the amount of all
freshman housing and adjusting the
Housing Draw to give students one
guaranteed year with a Draw num
ber of 1,200 or better, as opposed to
the current two preferred years bet
ter than 2,000.
In other business, the senate
heard a report from Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education
Ramon Saldfvar concerning the
Stanford Introductory Studies Pro
gram. The program includes sopho
more seminars and dialogues, as
well as the new freshman seminars,
among other programs.
Saldivar had many good things
to say of the seminar program.
"I've talked to a lot of students
who were absolutely enthusiastic
and positive regarding the semi
nars," said Saldivar. "The seminars
have made a tremendous differ
ence in the students' experience at
Stanford."
