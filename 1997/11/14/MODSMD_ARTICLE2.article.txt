## 
### Daniel Wolk Staff writer 
Solving problems in graduate
student housing should be a priori
ty for the University, members of
the Faculty Senate said yesterday.
Although no official decisions
were made at the meeting, the sen
ate discussed many substantive is
sues including undergraduate and
graduate housing and the progress
of the Stanford Introductory Stud
ies Program.
Microbiology and Immunology
Prof. Edward Mocarski, chair of
the senate's Committee of Gradu
ate Studies, said his committee has
not focused on graduate housing
but will in the future.
"Graduate housing has become
more of a problem, especially with
the price of rental housing going
up," he said.
Provost Condoleezza Rice men
tioned that the waiting list for grad
uate housing rose nearly 50 percent
for this quarter to 850, of whom
only 590 were accommodated.
Rice added that in the short term
the University must reconfigure its
housing allocation and, eventually,
must reconfigure Escondido Vil
lage and even build new housing.
Rice added that although cur
rent space for new housing is limit
ed. the recently passed Measure C)
will add more graduate student
housing. The measure, approved by
Palo Alto voters Nov. 4, allows the

University to build apartments on
Ohlone Field near Sand Hill Road,
as well as expand the road.
"Sand Hill will help, but we just
don't have the space to build right
now," said Rice.
Rice also introduced recommen
dations made by the Task Force on
Residential Programs and Student
Housing for Undergraduates,
which are being officially released
today. Those recommendations in
clude increasing the amount of all
freshman housing and adjusting the
Housing Draw to give students one
guaranteed year with a Draw num
ber of 1,200 or better, as opposed to
the current two preferred years bet
ter than 2,000.
In other business, the senate
heard a report from Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education
Ramon Saldfvar concerning the
Stanford Introductory Studies Pro
gram. The program includes sopho
more seminars and dialogues, as
well as the new freshman seminars,
among other programs.
Saldivar had many good things
to say of the seminar program.
"I've talked to a lot of students
who were absolutely enthusiastic
and positive regarding the semi
nars," said Saldivar. "The seminars
have made a tremendous differ
ence in the students' experience at
Stanford."
More than 175 small-group
courses will be offered for fresh
men and sophomores this year,
which, according to Saldivar, ex
ceeded all expectations. The semi
nars are designed to allow students
to explore a potential field of intel
lectual interest while enhancing
opportunities for the development
of relationships with tenured facul
ty.
"The aim is to create a sense of
intellectual excitement and to set a
standard of critical inquiry among
students at the crucial beginning
point of their college careers," said
Saldivar.
He added that many faculty
members have told him that lead
ing a seminar has been the "high
light of their teaching experience at
Stanford."
History Prof. David Kennedy,
who teaches a freshman seminar ti
tled "Reflections on the American
Condition: American History
Through Literature," reiterated

many of Saldi
var's points.
"I can't imag
ine a more eager
and bright
group of stu
dents," said
Kennedy.
The senate
also heard a re-

port from Dean Franklin Orr con
cerning the School of Earth Sci
ences.
The school currently includes
120 undergraduates, 230 graduate
students and 40 professors in four
major disciplines — earth systems,
geological and environmental sci
ences, geophysics and petroleum
engineering.
Orr said he hopes to bring the
School of Earth Sciences to "No. I
in its various disciplines."
"Earth scientists will play im
portant roles in satisfying society's
needs in the decades to come," said
Orr. "Our primary goal is to build
the base of science of the Earth,
both for its own sake and for its ap
plication to the problems and op
portunities our societies face."
