Ten groups from campus and the
Bay Area will perform at Roble
Gym today as part of "Elements and
Traditions of Hip-Hop," which will
examine the evolution of present
day hip-hop.
"We want people to think a little
hit about what has led to the cultural
evolution of hip-hop. We want to
give people a flavor of the cultural
influences on hip-hop," said Kim
Fowler, the program and develop
ment coordinator at the Committee
on Black Performing Arts.
The event, which is sponsored by
the committee and the Drama De

partment. will feature various dance
and musical styles including tradi
tional African, stepping and fusions
of rap, jazz and hip-hop. said
Fowler.
Kuumba, an African / Caribbean
dance ensemble on campus, will per
form a Mandingo children's dance
from West Africa called the "Kouk
ou," which traditionally is per
formed to provide children with
strength and vigor.
According to Kuumba President
Amber Marie Irving, a senior, the
connection between the ensemble's
traditional dance and modern hip
hop will be apparent to the audience.
"In a lot of the movements, you'll
see things reminding you of modern-

day dance," she said.
Step groups from the Alpha
Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma
Theta sororities will also be fea
tured.
"Step goes back to African and
African-American roots," said ju
nior Amber Abraham. Alpha
Kappa Alpha's step master. "It's
kind of like African tribal dancing
where the step represents the beat of
the drum, and the music that you
hear through our beats represents
unity amongst the people perform
ing. in this case our sorority sisters,"
Willi regard to step's place in the
evolution of modern dance, Abra
ham said. "Step would be in between
African tribal dancing — the root of

hip-hop dancing — and modern hip
hop, jazz and swing dance.
"There is a beat, and it is more of
a performance than doing it for
yourself like tribal dancing," she
said, "but it doesn't use music like
modern dance and hip-hop."
Jam Pac'd, Stanford's jazz and
hip-hop dance troupe, will be fea
tured as well.
Performers from off campus will
be the hip-hop groups Culture Shock
and Brothers and Sisters, as well as
Tu Bob Sava, a West African dance
company. Master reggae drummer
Leroy Mattis will also perform.
"Elements and Traditions of
Hip-Hop" will begin at 5 p.m.; at
tendance is free.
