But it only gets worse for the
Cardinal. Tomorrow Stanford (4-
5, 2-4 Pac-10) travels to Pullman,
Wash., to taee No. 14 Washington
State (8-1, 5-1), which features the
Pac-10's most powerful offense.
That doesn't bode well for a

Stanford team trying to snap a
four-game losing streak. The Car
dinal lost last week 45-21 to I ISC
and is in danger of losing live
straight for the first time since 198^
Last season. Stanford defeated
the Cougars 33-17 in the third of
live consecutive victories to end
the year. For Washington State,
that loss was one of four straight
that ruined a promising season.
This season, Stanford is the one
struggling, while the Cougars are
oil to their best start in 67 years.
In fact, Washington State is hav
ing one of its most successful sea
sons ever. If they win their last two
games, the Cougars have a great
chance of advancing to the Rose
Bowl for the first time since 1930.
Washington State's success has
been the result of its outstanding
olfensive play. Led by junior quar
terback Ryan Leaf, a serious Heis
man Trophy candidate, the
Cougars average a whopping 43

points and 507 yards of offense per
game, both second-best in the na
tion. Washington State has been
virtually unstoppable, as evi
denced by last week's 77-7 annihi
lation of Southwestern Louisiana.
Leaf is the third highest-ranked
passer in the country, having
thrown for 3,201 yards and 29
touchdowns. He needs just three
more touchdowns and 607 yards
over the last two weeks to break
the Pac-10 single-season records
for each.
Many scouts think Leaf could
be the first player taken in the NFL
draft if he makes himself eligible.
He has been compared favorably
to former Cougar Drew Bledsoe.
Leaf "is probably the best pass
er in the league." said Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham.
Leaf's success is partly attribut
able to the other weapons sur
rounding him in the Cougars' of
fense. Senior running back
Michael Black is the fourth-best
rusher in the league and on course
for a second-straight 1,000-yard
season — helping take pressure off
the passing game.

But what makes this Cougar of
fense so difficult to handle is the
corps of wide receivers known as
the Fab Five. Washington State
has five experienced and talented
wideouts and occasionally uses
them all at the same time. The Fab
Five have combined for 147 recep
tions and 26 touchdowns. By con
trast, Stanford receivers have only
nine touchdown receptions.
As if the task of shutting down
the Cougars' prolific passing at
tack was not enough, Stanford will
have to do so using a secondary
crippled by injuries.
Even when healthy, Stanford
has struggled to defend the pass.
But the Cardinal will face Leaf and
company extremely short-handed.
Already saddled with the loss of
safety Tim Smith, now it appears
that starting senior cornerback
Corey Hill and backup redshirt
freshman Mark Sanders will miss
tomorrow's contest with injuries.
The injuries "make us thinner
than a bone," Willingham said.
Stanford has only two healthy
cornerbacks who have any experi
ence against the Fab Five. Red
shirt freshman safety Than Mer
rill, walk-on junior Evan Herring
and redshirt freshman Che Hol
loway may see significant playing

time against the nation's fourth
best passing offense.
"We're going to have to give
[Leaf] a lot of looks and find some
pressure," Willingham said.
Stanford might try to blitz more
often than usual. The only team to
beat the Cougars this season —
Arizona State — won in large part
because its blitzing caused Leaf to
make mistakes near the end of the
game.
But no matter what the defense
does, it's unlikely to completely
shut down the powerful Cougars.
The Stanford offense, which has
struggled so much during this four
game losing streak, must produce
to give the Cardinal a chance.
Redshirt sophomore quarter
back Chad Hutchinson, who was
benched for the second half of the
USC loss, will start for the Cardi
nal. Willingham said he never seri
ously considered keeping Hutchin
son out this week, despite the fact
that he has only led one scoring
drive over the last three games.
The Cardinal has dropped from
second to ninth in the Pac-1() in
rushing offense and turned the ball
over 17 times over the last month
— glaring problems that must be
corrected if its offense is to keep up
with the Cougars'.
