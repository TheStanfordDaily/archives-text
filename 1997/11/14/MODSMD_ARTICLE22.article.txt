■ SUNDAY: Stanford (13-3-2, 3-0-
I) at No. 5 UCLA (16-2.4-1), I p.m.

The Cardinal (13 3-2, 3-0-1
MPSF) and the Bruins (l(i-2, 4-1)
have met 24 times, and UCLA has
won 21 of those games, including
the most recent meeting in 1 l > l >4.
The Bruins are also hungry lor their
fourth straight MI'SF champi
onship, and a victory Sunday would
represent their coach's 3(K)th career
win.
For the Cardinal, a win would
ensure continued postseason play:
The winner of the match at I J( 'l.A's
Spaulding Field earns an automatic
bid to the N( A A tournament.
It would also be Stanford's first

MPS! championship.
"Stanford's record against
UCLA is not good." said head
coach Bobby Clark. " The history
books don't favor us."
But, lie added, "I think this team
has done a fair hit of making its own
history. This is another opportunity
to add a chapter."
I'he game will also offer Stan
ford a chance to prove itself after
three straight losses that toppled
the ( ardinal from its No. 2 national
ranking. After a 5-1 loss to Santa
( lara last weekend, Stanford is un
ranked for the first time in 10 weeks.
The No. 5 Bruins, also ranked
No. 2 at one point during the sea
son.claimed the MPSF Pacific Divi
sion championship with ;i b-1 win
over UC-Santa Barbara last week
end to earn ;i meeting with Moun
tain Division champion Stanford.
The Cardinal's loss to No. 23
Santa Clara came on the heels of
two other losses against No. 1 In
diana and San Francisco which
ended a 20-game unbeaten streak.

Shawn Gaw and the Stanford men's soccer team will chase the
school's first-ever MPSF title and an NCAA berth tomorrow at UCLA.
The difference in this weekend's
game. CMark said, is that the Cardi
nal lias a locus after losing two
games that didn't seem to matter
much.
"We know what we're doing
now," lie said. "We're playing for
the championship.... It's very easy
lo focus on this game."
Stanford's strong defense will be
tested against a IJCLA team that is
strong overall. Against Santa Clara,
with defenders focusing on offense,
redshirt freshman goalkeeper
Adam Zapala let five goals through,
nearly as many as he had all season.

I le now has a .59 goals-against aver
age, fifth-best in the nation.
Stanford still has allowed only 11
goals ;ill season, hut the Bruins de
fense can nearly match that, with 13
goals allowed. Offensively, UCLA
has scored 57 goals, most in the
MPSF.
The ('ardinal has played in three
MPSI postseason games since the
federation was created in 1992. and
it remains positive about its chances
for victory Sunday.
Whether Stanford will receive an
at-large bid to the NCAA tourna
ment it it loses to I)('LA is unclear.
"They don't worry about that,"
he said of his players. "It's out of
their control. The thing that is in our
control is to beat I JCLA."
