I) at No. 5 UCLA (16-2.4-1), I p.m.

The Cardinal (13 3-2, 3-0-1
MPSF) and the Bruins (l(i-2, 4-1)
have met 24 times, and UCLA has
won 21 of those games, including

The Bruins are also hungry lor their
fourth straight MI'SF champi
onship, and a victory Sunday would
represent their coach's 3(K)th career
win.
For the Cardinal, a win would
ensure continued postseason play:
The winner of the match at I J( 'l.A's
Spaulding Field earns an automatic
bid to the N( A A tournament.
It would also be Stanford's first

MPS! championship.

UCLA is not good." said head

books don't favor us."

has done a fair hit of making its own
history. This is another opportunity
to add a chapter."

three straight losses that toppled
the ( ardinal from its No. 2 national
ranking. After a 5-1 loss to Santa

ranked for the first time in 10 weeks.
The No. 5 Bruins, also ranked
No. 2 at one point during the sea

over UC-Santa Barbara last week

tain Division champion Stanford.
The Cardinal's loss to No. 23

two other losses against No. 1 In
