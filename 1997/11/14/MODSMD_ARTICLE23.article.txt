Shooting 124 in a golf tourna
ment might make you hurl your
putter into the water hazard. But if
you had only played the game for
one week, and two months later
you shot an N9, it might make you
switch from the high school swim
team to the golf team.

WOMEN'S GOLF
â–  TODAY THROUGH SlIN
DAY: The Golf World / Palmetto
iDunoo Invitational in Hilton Head,
S.C.

That's exactly what happened
to Hilary Homeyer, the Stanford
freshman playing No. 1 this week
end at the Palmetto Dunes Invita
tional in Hilton Head, S.C.
"I don't know anyone in the
country that has accomplished
such a feat," said Stanford
women's golf coach Caroline
O'Connor of Homeyer's meteoric
improvement.
Homeyer set a goal to break 90
during her first summer of golf in
1993.
"I improved really quickly," she
said. "If I hadn't, my interest would
have died out."
Homeyer first got interested in
the game while caddying for her fa
ther, Bill Homeyer, who played
collegiate golf at Minnesota. She
attributes her rapid development
to being surrounded by golf.
"I already knew so much from
caddying," Homeyer said, "and
Dad helped me out a lot."
Homeyer has been racking up
golf accomplishments at a break
neck pace since first picking up the

sport less than live years ago. Her
Edina High School goll team won
the Minnesota State Champi
onship her sophomore and senior

years. Last year she made it to the
round of 16 at the I S Amateur
Championship, competing against
women of all ;iges. Ciolf World

magazine ranked her the No. 9 ju
nior golfer in the world in 19%.
And if her first lour years were
not impressive enough, 1997 was
spectacular.
Alter years of Hilary lugging
around his clubs, I lomeyer's father
returned the favor last year by cad
dying lor her at the Women's
Western Amateur. Iloineyer lost
the match-play final to Stanford
teammate Stephanie Keever.
In June, Honieyer qualified for
the Women's U.S. Open in Port
land, Ore., competing agumsl golf
superstars like Annika Sorenstam
and Hetsy King. Hut Honieyer
failed to make the cut.
"It was my worst tournament of
the summer," she explained. "You
wake up one day and can't play,
out of nowhere."
lint rather than get discouraged
by her performance on national
television, Homeyer said she kept
saying to herself. "I can't believe I
am playing at the I I.S. ()pen."
"I would look over the fairway,"
she said, "and instead of seeing my
friends, I would see Nancy I ,opez."
Homeyer's string of accom
plishments can be appreciated by
any serious golfer. Hut Honieyer
can also laugh at the game, and she
sees that positive mental attitude
as her greatest strength.
"(ioll is important, but (it's) not
everything in my life," she said.
"You have to keep things in per
spective (and) |ust laugh and blow
off a bad round."
It's an outlook that has worked
well for her this season. In her first
collegiate tournament, Homeyer
