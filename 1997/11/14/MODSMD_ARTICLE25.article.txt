Desilets is a 6-foot 2 middle
blocker who leads the nation in
blocking. In just K6 games, Desilets
has racked up 175 blocks includ
ing 37 solo stuffs and is the only
collegiate player averaging over two
blocks per game (2.03).
Desilets has a strong supporting
cast in the 16th ranked I luskies( 15-
K, 10-4 Pacific 10 Conference),
which could make tonight's contest
against No. Stanford (24-2, 15-0)
the best Maples has seen all year.
When the two teams met in Seat
tle Oct. IK, Stanford capped oil an
ama/ing weekend that saw it sweep
both Washington schools without
the hitting services of sophomore
outside hitter Kerri Walsh.
Walsh had an exceptional defen
sive performance that weekend (35
digs and 5 I / 2 blocks) and has spent
die last lour weeks slowly working
back to full speed.
Walsh "is such a powerful and
smart hitter that it she is swinging
away full strength, it will help our
team tenfold," said senior co-cap
tain Kristin Folkl.
Folk I should know. With the in
jury to Walsh, lolkl has been called
upon to carry a large portion of the
offensive load. So far she has re
sponded. And with Dcsilets bring
ing the big block, tonight's matchup
promises to be exciting.
"I )esilets is amazing," l olkl said.
"She's an incredible, national team
caliber athlete. She's one we really
need to pay attention to."
Things don't get any easier for
the C ard tomorrow night against

No. 12 Washington Slate (15-H,y-5).
A three-game loss to Washing
lon last weekend dropped the
( ougars into a tie lor fourth place in
the l'ac-10. Hut Washington State
still has a higher ranking than the
Huskies, and a win over Stanford
would make a great ease for a high
er seed in the N< A A tournament.
" I hey're fighting for second, and
a win against us is something no one
has done in the conference," Shaw
said of both Washington schools.
" I heir focus is coming down here to
get us Right now people are playing
lor seedings
With its fourth straight confer
ence crown wrapped up, the ( ardi
nal could cruise through its final
four matches ot the season Hut as
Shaw points out, seedings are a big
focus, and Stanford is bidding to
host one < >1 four NC AA regionals.
"We need to keep our national
ranking high to get a good region,"
I olkl said "And losing to the Wash
ingtons would not help us keep that
rank. We have a lot ol incentive to
play well Hut it won't he easy I hey
have a lot ol great players."
