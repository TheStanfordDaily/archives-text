Despite the frequency of sexual
assault, many people are unprepared
to deal with the suffering of a friend
or loved one who has been raped,
counselors said last night at a work
shop on "Being a Friend to a Sur
vivor of Sexual Assault."
The workshop began with small
group discussions and anecdotes,
followed by a general discussion of
rape stereotypes and the recovery
process a survivor faces.
One purpose of the workshop,
said Diana Swart/ a counselor with
the Mid-Peninsula Rape Crisis Cen
ter. was to "break down the myths
surrounding sexual assault."
The "typical" rapist is not a gruff,
hulking stranger, she said; in fact,
most rapists are someone the victim
knows. According to Swart/ S3 per
cent of rapes are acquaintance rapes.

and 93 percent occur within the vic
tim's own ethnic group.
Acquaintance rape often leads to
a greater loss of trust, and workshop
leaders emphasized that when
women choose to tell someone that
they have been raped, students need
to know how to best respond.
When a victim chooses to confide
in someone, the first rule for that
person is to believe the victim.
"Doubt continues to hurt the vic
tim." Swart/ said. "You should be
lieve her wholeheartedly."
Swart/ and co-counselor Kiran
Malhotra also encouraged friends of
survivors to listen and refrain from
asking "why" questions, which
Swart/ said imply blame.
"When you ask someone, Why
did you go into his car? Why were
you dressed like that?' you imply [the
rape) was her fault," Swart/ said.
Although friends of survivors
should offer options to the victim, ul
timately. victims should be left to
choose their course of action, coun
selors suggested. ()ne choice is to ei
ther receive a standard medical
exam or to undergo an evidence-col
lection exam, called a Sexual Assault
Recovery Team (SART) exam.
'The medical evidentiary exam
is not to see it the person is OK but
instead, the purpose is to collect ev
idence," said Rape Crisis Center Di
rector Michelle Osborn. "Although

SARI nurses arc em pathetic. they
are not advocates for the victim.
They're not working in opposition
(to advocates], hut we all have our
separate roles."
For this reason, a victim of sexu
al assault is accompanied to SAR I
exams by a designated advocate
from a local rape crisis center, Os
born said. The Mid-Peninsula Rape
Crisis Center offers drop-in, one
on-one counseling for survivors.
The center is located at 4Hi I Alma
St.in Palo Alto, and its hotline num
ber is 443-7273.
Seven women and two men at
tended the workshop, sponsored by
the Women's Center in conjunction
with the Rape Crisis Center.
