# An exerpt from the recent Mean Streets: Memoirs of a Stanford campus policeman,
## 
### Lieutenant "Fatty" Wilkins 
I'll never forget Tuesday the 7th. 1996 as the clay the
Stanford police lost one of the best on the force, and I lost a
personal friend.
I'd been assigned to patrol with Henry "Nosey" Smith
for about 10 weeks, and we'd both become close as a result.
Nosey had been in the campus police force for 20 years and
had the stories to prove it: the parking tickets, the minor-in
possesion tickets, the breaking up of parties at freshman
dorms. He could talk the language of the street. He was a
man who'd seen it all. a man as tough as nails.
You have to understand that to survive on the job you
have to destroy everything human within you. The campus
gets to you: everywhere is danger: every breath you take
might be your last. After a while you start to think that the
campus is a living, breathing creature. Whether you're
cruising around in an electric uolf cart with a yellow light on

top, or just cycling, you have to stay alert. If you take the
campus for granted for even one instant, it'll pounce on you.
Anyway Nosey and 1 had been giving out tickets that
fateful day. That's what we call it when we look to see
whether cars parked in "A" zones have "A" zone badges. If
they don't have "A" /one badges, we put a sticker on the
windshield. If they have an "A" zone badge and it's out of
date, we just give theni a warning. It's one of the most dan
gerous jobs a Stanford policeman can do, only the most
experienced cop is allowed to do it, and even then it can only
be done in pairs.
I'd been giving a Buick a ticket for having an illegally
colored bumper sticker, it was getting dark, when Nosey
silently motioned to me. I knew something was wrong from
the expression on his face. I turned around and saw what he
saw, a girl riding a bicycle on the sidewalk with no bike

light, her tire pressure clearly below the minimum limit...
That's what it's like on the campus. Laws are made only
to he broken. The rules of society are destroyed by the mad
ness of the streets. Bicycles become instruments of death,
driven by 'students' who no longer care about the conse
quences. You'll see students riding bikes through stop signs,
riding bikes without a license, riding bikes on a sidewalk.
We knew that we could get this girl, but we needed back
up. We called in two cars that surrounded her. Despite my
warning, she reached into her backpack, so I whacked her
with my night stick. I looked over and saw Nosey trembling.
He said, "We're pathetic. I've just realized it. All we do
is act tough breaking up parties and giving people tickets. 1
can't do this anymore. I'm leaving.
The campus is a funny place. It can destroy the best of
men. That day it got to Nosey.
