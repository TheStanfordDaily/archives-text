# Proposed Housing Changes
## 
### 
1. Create a freshman / sophomore resi
dential cluster and learning community
2. Concentrating first-year students in
residences with populations large enough
to maintain a "critical mass" of freshman
students.
3. Revise current "guaranteed year / pre
ferred year" policy from the present "two
preferred years, one unpreferred year"
system to a system that offers one pre
ferred year (Draw numbers 1-1,200), and
two guaranteed years (Draw numbers
1,201-3,600)
