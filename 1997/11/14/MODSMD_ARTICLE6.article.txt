### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
Yesterday at Hishop Auditorium, jazz musician
Herbic Hancock spoke on "Music, Technology and
Humanity", proposing a community center that in
corporates music and technology to increase job op
portunities in disadvantaged communities.
Oscar and (irammy award-winning ja// musician
Hancock was on campus as a part of the (iraduate
School ol Business' Public Management Initiative
speaker series. I he initiative's goal is to bring public
issues into the classroom, analyze them and apply the
solutions to real life. This year's initiative is technolo
gy and social change.
"We are trying to sort out the patterns in technolo
gy and social change. What are the hidden effects of
quickening the pace of change and life with technolo
gy? I liis is our main question, " said Jonathan I loyt,
one of the business students who brought 1 lancock to
speak.
Hancock founded the San Francisco-based organi
zation Rhythm ol Life last year to reduce the gap be
tween technology "haves" and "have-nots." "Pretty
soon, without a computer, you're going to be out ol
the game," Hancock said.
In his address, Hancock discussed how music and
technology influenced his life. 11c began with insights
into his childhood. "When I was 5 years old, I took
apart electric trains and watches, but I couldn't always
put them back together again. I wondered what made
things tick." flic focus of his curiosity gradually be
came "what makes the world and human beings tick?"
This analytical state of mind brought him to jazz
music, allowing him to combine theory and harmony.
"Jazz is a constant decision making process. It is mys
tical and mysterious and has a direct correlation to
function and the most interesting aspect of humans:
creativity," I lancock said.
"I began to cry a lot more when I read the papers
and watched the news as I got older," Hancock said,
"Hut I tired ol crying eventually, and I decided to
do something. I realized that technology led to the iso
Ia t ion ol human beings from their community, caus
ing, for example, young people to become remorse-
less murderers."
Hancock suggested looking into
the problems caused by technologi
cal advancement before they hap
pen and thinking about preventive
measures. "I want to be a part of
swinging the pendulum back on
track, so that it focuses on humani
ty, rather than on ceaseless techno
logical advancement and the
thoughtless accumulation of power
and wealth," Hancock said.
Hancock mentioned another
community center, the Bedwell
Training Center, which is extreme
ly successful in increasing young
people's academic success, "simply
by giving them more self-esteem
through music and dance," Han
cock explained.
Joe Mou/an, Hancock's col

league who helped found Rhythm
of Life, was also present at Han
cock's speech. He said fresh minds
were necessary to help research the
needs of businesses in the area and
residents of the community.
"We're going to use capitalism to
induce social change. We can do
this through job training and teach
ing programs," Mouzan explained.
Lauren Dutton, academic resi
dent and program manager of the
Public Management Initiative, said
"the results obtained from the com
munity center will be applicable to
businesses as well as other organi
zations."
Dutton added that the project is
at its official planning stage. Han
cock, Mouzan and Bill Strickland,
who spoke at Stanford as part of last
year's Public Management Initia
tive on social entrepreneurship, are
collaborating with Stanford busi
ness students to establish the com
munity center in San Francisco.
