### Nathan Watanabe 
For those who have fell ma

Directory comes out.
This year's Directory promises
easier access and a greater variety ol
features for the inquiring student,
said Project Director Matt (iarling
house, a senior.
"It's the largest and most com
prehensive Directory yet," he said.
" There are a couple new sections
and the [campus organization sec
tion] has been completely re
vamped."
Encompassing 9(X) pages of Uni
versity phone listings and highlights.

the Directory now contains ;i career
guide section, an outdoors section
and a night life section to helter re
fleet the diverse interests o( the stu
dent body, (iarlinghouse said.
In addition to the information i!
provides, the Directory also in
cludes coupons for restaurants and
local stores. Along with the afore
mentioned improvements, this
year's hook contains a greater sclec
tion ol coupons than previous years.
"The Directory's more specific
than the White Pages and the Yel
low Pages, lor it caters primarily to
the University, offering student
geared information, said Produc
tion Manager Chris ()nstad, ( lass of
'97.
Students who submitted their

name, pin>nc number and e-mail ad
dress into I lie computer vi;i Axcss by
Oct. will have their data listed in
the I directory.
Student groups and athletic
teams are being paid to pass out the
book Monday morning for fund
raising purposes. Unlike past distri
hutions, on-campus undergraduates
can now pick up their I )ircctories in
the lounge of their dormitories in
stead ol having to solicit them from
their resident assistant.
"We figured it would be more el
ficicnt for the students to pick up
their Directories this way since in
past years it was real hectic for the
RAs to pass them all out them
selves." said (iarlinghousc.
Off-campus undergraduates will

receive a post
card m the mail,
which they can
then redeem for a
Directory at the
Stanford Store in
I rcsidder I Jnion.
(Jraduate stu
dents will receive
their hooks

through their departments.
I hough in service since the I Jm
versity's founding, the Directory is
only in its second year as an inde
pendent student-run business. Due
to tax issues, the ASM I took control
of the Directory last year from the
(>1 lice ol Student Allairs.


Garlinghouse
As part of the ASSI J's business
arm. Stanford Student Hnterprises,
the Directory represents, "one ol
the largest and most complex stu
dent-run business on campus," ac
cording to Onstad.
"With no administrative au
thority on the University's part, it
gives one a very practical business
experience," said (iarlinghouse.
Advertisements make up the bulk
of the Directory's funds, but the
I Iniversity does help cover costs if
necessary.
