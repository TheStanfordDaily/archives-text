The Stance Of Atlas by Peter F. Krickson ('6l) Examines
Ayn Kami's Philosophy of Ob jectivism
Ami Rand s major teachings are considered in detail In addition to tins
special attention is given to the relation of her philosophy of Objectivism to
linstein s theory of relativity and also to Dialectical Materialism (the
intellectual basis of Marxism)
Avn Rand s rejection of collectivism is not disputed Her position on the
cllicacy of reason remains-also her acceptance of freewill
Ami Rand's episternological and metaphysical teachings are subjected to
extensive criticism I ler attempt to solve the problem of umversals is shown to
be a failure The Stance <)f Atlas actually provides the correct solution She
believed, incorrect 1\ that Objectivism has the kev to answering the problem of
induction The Stance Of Atlas shows that this problem was basically solved bv
a forgotten Imglish logician early in this century Contrary to Rand's
Objectivism, it is established that reason is open to the possibility of God s
existence
Ayn Rand s attempt to found a new morality is shown to be less than what
she took it to be Ihe defense of fractional reserve banking made bv Alan
(Jreenspan in Rand's book on capitalism is refuted < >ther important issues are
discussed
( onsiderably less relativists than Objectivism, /he Stance Of Atlas is also
implicitly more individualistic If read with care this book is capable of
providing a portion of the deep intellectual improvement promised ( but not
reall\ delivered) b\ Objectivism
