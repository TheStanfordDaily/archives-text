J technologies. In disk applications, we're
y I accelerating the transition to Spin Valve,
(liant MR, (Colossal MR, Spin Dependent lunneling
detectors, and Magneto < )ptics. And we're pursuing multi
channel recording and digital video recording for tape drive
apnlu ations.
We've embarked on long reac lung ex plot at ions ol
new technologies we know we'll need, as well .is some we
want to know .ill about just in case.
We're committed to writing to disks at ever higher
data rates, developing evei more accurate thin film depi
tion and controls, stretching the envelope ol recording
physics in new technology sensors, and pioneering new
pathways in reducing recording error rates.
