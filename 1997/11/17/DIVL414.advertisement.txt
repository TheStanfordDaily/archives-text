1 Junior Jose Chow likes to joke that he was born carry
jP® li s n ' n 9 a ball. But the truth is, he didn't discover
/J his passion for bowling until the ripe old age of seven.
V That was more than a decade ago in his hometown of
El Paso, Texas, and Jose has been a regular at the
lanes ever since. He joined Stanford's year-old Club
Bowling Team this season and before long wowed both competitors
and teammates with his stellar scores.
In his first outing for Stanford, Jose posted the highest score on
the Cardinal team In that tournament, he narrowly edged out a rival
bowler from Sacramento State 195-194, bowling four strikes in a row to
win. His career highlights include three perfect games and a defeat of
a PBA tour pro in a Pro-Am last year.
Keep watching Sportsl/2Page to find out when and where Jose
and his teammates plan to hit the lanes this winter.
