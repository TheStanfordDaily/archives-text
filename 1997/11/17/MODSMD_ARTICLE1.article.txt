# Students rally for activist's freedom
## 
### Saba Bireda 
Members of the Stanford Amer
ican Indian Organization rallied in
San Francisco yesterday to champi
on the cause of imprisoned political
activist Leonard Peltier.
Peltier was convicted in 1975 of
the murder of two FBI agents. Since
then. Peltier's allies have claimed
that he was wrongly imprisoned and
should be released.
Desert Horse Grant, a sopho
more, attended the event with about
10 other Stanford students. She first
heard about the Peltier rally in Oc
tober when a representative of the
National People's Campaign — a
human rights organization — visit
ed campus and conducted a work
shop informing students about
Peltier's struggles.
Peltier and Horse Grant belong
to the same tribe. Oglala-Lakota,
and have roots in the same reserva
tion— Pine Ridge in South Dakota.
"Mv entire family is from Pine

Ridge; they know a lot about this
ease. They all feel that Leonard is a
wonderful man. He doesn't deserve
to be in a prison — this is criminal in
justice," Horse Grant said.
At the rally, Horse Grant read a
speech written for the occasion by
Peltier. In it. Peltier listed numerous
grievances of Native Americans,
most of them relating to perceived
mistreatment at the hands of feder
al and state governments,
Peltier especially noted the ac
tions of FBI-sponsored Native
American police who he said killed
64 people on his reservation over a
two-year period who were active in
the American Indian Movement.
That period came to a head on
June 26,1975, when FBI agents Jack
Coler and Ronald Williams went
outside of their jurisdiction to enter
Pine Ridge and arrest a Native
American man for stealing. A
shootout ensued between inhabi
tants of the reservation and 200
members of the FBI and other law
enforcement agencies. Coler and
Williams died in the shootout.
A massive government investiga
tion followed; three members of the
American Indian Movement were
charged. Two men were acquitted.
Only Peltier was convicted of the
crime and sentenced to two consec
utive life sentences.
From the beginning of the gov
ernment investigation, civil and
human rights organizations have
protested the case, arguing that the
FBI framed Peltier because he was a

major leader in the fight for Native
American rights.
He has been imprisoned for 21
years and was denied his last possi
ble appeal in 1995. With no appeals
left, Peltier's only hope is presiden
tial clemency.
In the address read by Horse
Grant, Peltier said that "the issues of
yesterday are still very much with us
today" and encouraged American
youth to act so as to make people in
the future "say we knew what was
wrong and moved ahead on to bring
about change."
Sophomore Enei Begaye, co
chair of SAIO, was one of the stu
dents representing Stanford at the
rally. A Navajo from Arizona, Be
gaye said, "It's good for Native

American students to get off campus
and attend functions important to
Native Americans. The SAIO sup
ports events like this and will contin
ue to do the same here at Stanford."
Stanford's were not the only stu
dents attending the rally. Students
from several campuses around Cali
fornia were present. Brenda Sand
berg, one of the NPC organizers of
the rally, commented, "I have never
seen this much support for Peltier
from college students. I am
amazed."
The rally was held from 2-6 p.m.
at Mission High School in San Fran
cisco. Scheduled speakers included
former U.S. Attorney General
Ramsey Clark and AIM founder
Dennis Banks.
