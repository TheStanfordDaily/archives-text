### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) â€” Iraq ordered
Baghdad hospitals to evacuate non-emergency
patients yesterday in preparation for a possible
U.S. air attack over Saddam Hussein's refusal
to comply with I ! .N. weapons inspections.
Ihousands of Iraqi civilians, meanwhile,
flocked to Saddam's palaces in Baghdad and
industrial installations around the capital to join
other people serving as human shields.
The United States yesterday pressed for
ward with its military buildup, sending the air
craft carrier I)SS George Washington through
the Suez Canal toward the Persian Gulf.
Kuwait and Syria, which supported strikes
against Iraq during the 1991 Persian Gulf War,
said they were opposed to the use of force in the
current standoff, which began on Oct. 29 when
Iraq decided to expel American weapons
inspectors working for the I Jnited Nations.
"We do not support any military action
against Iraq." said Kuwait's foreign minister.
Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
Kuwait usually is unsparing in its criticism of
Iraq, which invaded the emirate in 1 WO. trig
gering the Gulf War.
At the end of the 1991 war. the United
Nations ordered Iraq to destroy its weapons of
mass destruction and sent in a multinational
team of inspectors to month, Iraq asserted that
the American inspectors were spies intent on
prolonging U.N. economic sanctions imposed
after the Kuwait invasion. Though the Security
Council warned of consequences if Iraq expelled
the monitors, Iraq went ahead with the move
Thursday, deepening fears of a military strike.
Richard Butler, the chief IJ.N. weapons
inspector, warned in an interview with CNN
that Iraq could resume building biological

weapons within a week.
In Baghdad, fuel rationing forced U.N. mon
itors overseeing an oil-for-food program to halt
their work yesterday. The monitors, who were
unable to drive to work, said they expect to
send teams out today after they secure fuel sup
plies.
The lightly monitored program allows Iraq to
sell $2 billion in oil for six months in exchange
for food and other humanitarian goods.
Iraq, fearing the United States might target
oil refineries and storage tanks in the event of a
military strike, announced Saturday it was
introducing gasoline rationing.
The government yesterday ordered non
emergency patients to be removed from hospi
tals in Baghdad. It was not clear how many peo
ple would be evacuated.
The United States and Britain, meanwhile,
worked to rally support for strong action
against Saddam.
"1 le is not a man that is going to listen to any
language of reason or sweetness unless the per
son using it is also carrying a big stick." British
Prime Minister Tony Blair said in a BBC televi
sion interview.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright cut
short a visit to Qatar and left for neighboring
Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to discuss
the standoff.
In Qatar. Albright lashed out at Baghdad for
refusing to comply with U.N. resolutions
demanding the elimination of its weapons of
mass destruction.
"Unfortunately for the Iraqi people, instead
of meeting these requirements, for six years,
Saddam Hussein has lied, delayed, obstructed
and tried to deceive," she said.
