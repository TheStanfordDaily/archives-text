# Political prisoner released
## China frees pro-democracy campaigner after 18 years 
### 
BEIJING (AP) —Ailing
but unrepentant, China's
most prominent pro-democ
racy campaigner was
released from prison and left
yesterday for medical treat
ment in the United States.
Wei Jingsheng, who has
spent all but about six
months of the past IS years
in prison, left aboard a flight
to Detroit, his sister and
brother told The Associated
Press. They said he hopes to
return to China but didn't
know when he would be
able to.
The 47-year-old Wei.
who suffers from heart prob
lems, high blood pressure
and other ailments made
worse in prison, was
released on medical parole,
said Wei Ling and Wei
Xiaotao. They said he had
been unable to get adequate
treatment in prison for wors
ening medical problems.
The dissident had said
previously that he didn't
want to leave China. But his
poor health and harsh prison
conditions compelled him to
leave, his siblings said. But
they also said he remained

committed to his belief in
democracy.
"He is firm and unshak
able. No situation would
make him give up his pursuit
and ideals," Wei Ling said.
"He thinks the sacrifices he
has made for a just cause are
worthwhile."
Wei's release came less
than two weeks after Chi
nese President Jiang Zemin
returned from a state visit to
the United States. Chinese

officials had denied sugges
tions they would release Wei
or other dissidents as a
goodwill gesture, describing
the prisoners as common
criminals.
But Chinese leaders are
also sometimes happy to see
dissidents go into exile
because they frequently sink
into obscurity. None, how
ever, has ever been as high
profile as Wei, who has been
mentioned for years as a

leading contender for the
Nobel Peace Prize.
Since last year, Wei had
been placed under 24-hour
watch in a cell with two glass
walls and a light that was
never switched off, his sister
said. He was imprisoned on
a salt farm east of Beijing.
Human rights groups
appealed to Clinton before
Jiang's trip in late October
to demand the release of
Wei and other dissidents.
