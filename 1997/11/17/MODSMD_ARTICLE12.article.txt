# History of disappointing moves makes some say:
## China is playing games

BEIJING (AP) — The last time Wei
Jingsheng was released from prison was 1993
— China was wooing Olympic organizers,
trying to land the 2000 Summer Games for
Beijing.
The games went to Australia, and Wei
went back to prison.
This time, Chinese officials had denied
they would release a dissident as a goodwill
gesture to President Clinton. But in the end,
they stuck to their script, freeing Wei two
weeks after President Jiang Zemin returned
in triumph from a state visit to Washington.
Wei's release highlights the fact that Jiang

is relying on using prisoners as an instrument
of policy even as his government seeks a
major role on the world stage.
"I would imagine this is Jiang Zemin's
thank-you present to the Clinton administra
tion for giving him full a ceremonial visit to
Washington," said Robin Munro, Hong
Kong director of Human Rights Watch.
Jiang's mentor, Deng Xiaoping, won over
Americans during a 1979 visit to the U.S. by
wearing a cowboy hat and frolicking at Dis
neyland. Then he returned home to launch
the crackdown that landed Wei in prison for
his first 15-year stretch behind bars.
