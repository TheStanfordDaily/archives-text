Security and flexibility are
pluses to CowelPs Cardinal
Care insurance program

STANFORD'S NFW HEALTH
insurance program. Cardinal Care,
offers students the benefits of higher
coverage maximums, lower overall costs
and access to a wider range of network
providers.
Cowell Student Health Center's move
to address its former program's weakness
es. by assembling student and administra
tor input and taking the measures neces
sary to affect change, represents a level of
responsiveness that should be commend
ed.
Cardinal Care, co-sponsored by Cowell
and Blue Cross of California, replaces the
old program that was co-sponsored
MEGA Life and Health Insurance Com
pany.
While on the surface, the more than
6.000 students enrolled in the plan may not
notice significant differences in Cardinal
Care's coverage — after all the in-network
coverage went from 70 percent after the
deductible to SO percent after the
deductible while out-of-network coverage
actually decreased from 70 percent cover
age after the deductible to 60 percent after
the deductible — the real advantages lie
just below the surface.
Most students will not experience the
added benefits that Cardinal Care pro
vides. Cowell will likely remain the first
stop for students needing medical care. In
terms of coverage at Cowell. these services
will still be fully covered, as will services at
the Medical Center provided a Cowell
physician refers the patient.
The increase in maximum coverage
from $250,000 to $5 million probably won't

directly benefit the hulk of the student
population given that fewer than five stu
dents generally exceed $100,(MX) in medical
expenses per year. Additionally, the
changes to mental health care do not affect
most patients who use Counseling and Psy
chological Services as their therapy
provider.
The key advantage in the Cardinal Care
plan lies in the expanded options for stu
dents covered by the plan. Whether stu
dents utilize them or not, these expanded
options are valuable for the sense of secu
rity they provide. After all, the logic behind
comprehensive medical care is protection
for the unanticipated illness.
For Cardinal Care this means that stu
dents. when off-campus, who unexpectedly
need care can receive medical treatment
where ever they happen to he. Almost 70
percent of physicians and hospitals in the
United States are Blue Cross members.
Additionally, the increase in catastrophic
coverage provides just a little more sup
port.
Cardinal Care also limits out-of-pocket
expenses — something Mega Life failed to
do. Furthermore, students needing extend
ed mental care now have a national net
work called Value Behavioral Health that
provides such services. Another perk is
that prescriptions filled at Cowell are cov
ered at (SO percent, with no deductible.
All in all. the more than two year dis
cussion that went into affecting this change
has proved worthwhile, and the plan has
adequately taken into account the input of
the four students and 10 administrators
who worked on the insurance committee
not to mention concerns voiced
throughout the years.
The best part is that Cowell was able to
do all of this without raising premiums.
Student may not even realize that they are
getting more for their money, hut if the
unexpected arises they will certainly be
thankful.
