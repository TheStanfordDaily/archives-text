## Rejecting the Big Game brew-ha-ha 
### 
A MONSTER has
invaded this
campus, and it's
not pretty. It's monopo
lizing the presses, the
freshmen dorms and even
student theatrical produc
tions. No one is safe from

this plague that causes
abominable traffic, redundant journalism
and hordes of people to wear ridiculous red
outfits on a Saturday morning.
I'm no "Big Game" ignoramus. I speak
from experience.
Since my brother walked on the team his
sophomore year, I've been obliged to attend
many a Stanford football game. Even
Christmas break was once dominated by the
sport, when my family interrupted our fes
tivities to follow the team to Tennessee for
the Liberty Bowl.
Thankfully, my short-lived career as a
football spectator ended in Memphis on
Dec. 31, 1995. It was my brother's last game
as a player, and though my parents continue
to chase the Cardinal around the globe to
witness the fruits of my brother's behind
the-scenes graduate assistant coaching job, I
opt for the condensed version over Sunday
brunch.
It's not that I'm against football, as I'm
accused of being by gung-ho relatives.
My relationship with football is less like
my relationship to meat, which I choose not
to consume because I find it morally repre
hensible, and more like my relationship with
asparagus: I don't eat it because I don't like
it, that's all.
However, if the rest of the world gave
asparagus more undue attention than any
other vegetable, insisted that I should eat
asparagus to be a decent member of the
community and condemned me as some sort
of scrooge for disliking it, I might find it a bit
irritating.
Although I am able to recognize that

asparagus is a beautiful plant and surely is
chock-full of good vitamins, I think I have
valid reasons not to consider it the side dish
of choice.
And so with football.
I openly acknowledge that my brother
inherited all the competitive athletic genes in
the family, and I have witnessed the long
hours he spends training and strategizing
with the team. So it's not difficult for me to
admire the strength and skill of the players
and the intelligence and hard work that con
tribute to a good game. Still, all the brew-ha
ha over a brown leather ball and a red axe
leaves me feeling a bit petulant.
First of all, there's something inherently
distasteful about a bunch of grown men

clobbering each
other so violent-

ly that they must

wear protective

gear fit for crash

test dummies.
Even with the

padding, it's not

unusual for them to

break each others' bones

and dismantle joints. Some
where in all the gore I think the

finer athletic virtues of grace and

honor are overshadowed

Secondly, regardless of whether sports
men are brutalizing themselves or turning
pirouettes, any game that inspires its specta
tors to yell such things as '"Kill, maim, dis
member," seems lacking in a certain conge
nial attitude.
I know what you're thinking: 'it's just a
game, don't take it all so seriously."
But I wish it were just a game, and that all
those involved would consider it with
according seriousness. But the reality is that
I've seen coaches, players and fans after
many a game either celebrating as if world
peace had finally taken hold or mourning as
if an atomic bomb had been dropped.

1 distinctly remember riding back to the
hotel on a Stanford chartered bus after the
Liberty Bowl defeat when the gloom in the
air was as thick as molasses.
Certainly, people react to football out
comes with gravity because it is a serious
business enterprise. Football tickets and
television rights are lucrative enterprises for
our Athletic Department.
I only need to take one glance at all the
swoosh-emblazoned gear given to my broth
er to know that corporate interests are
stronger in this sport than in any other activ
ity on campus. Simply, people attend foot
ball games in Hoods and Dance Department
performances in dribbles.
I'm not bitter that the vast majority of
Stanford affiliates find football more inter

esting than art. Just don't accuse me of
being apathetic because my kind of

school spirit is the thing that makes

me want to paint a pretty pic

ture of the Quad,
k If your notion of

school spirit makes you
want to burn an effigy

of a cute little bear,
don't let me kill your
buzz. Everyone
needs their own

sacred bonding rituals.

Go ahead, wear red, yell weird things and

have lots of fun.

Just don't get so caught up in this con
structed rivalry that you forget that the only
thing big about this game is the big deal that
everyone makes of it. In truer perspective,
asparagus is good for you, and football is just
a little game.

ophy and form of visual art, hopes that Kit
may one day find it in his heart to forgive his
sister for writing this column. Beat Cal.
