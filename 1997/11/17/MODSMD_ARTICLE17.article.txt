Leave grads in CroMem
I am writing to protest the proposed clo
sure of Crothers Memorial Hall as a gradu
ate engineering dormitory. CroMem is one
of the few graduate "communities" at Stan
ford. It is a place where graduate engineers
of many disciplines, backgrounds and cul
tures come together as friends and col
leagues to create a social and intellectual
environment that is truly unique.
Moreover, it is an island of sanity and fun
that sustains and nourishes graduate stu
dents through the demanding and stressful
course of engineering study. Stanford
should support CroMem and the long tradi
tion of community that it represents.
Undergraduate students should also he
concerned. The Daily article did not point
out that CroMem is required to house engi
neering students.
It isn't likely that students are going to
line up to draw into one-room doubles in an
engineering theme dormitory. And I have
two words: CroMem. Do you know of any
undergrads who actually want to live in
CroMem? Maybe ask some residents of the
Suites or how happy they would

be to lose their spots to graduate students
and move to CroMem?
Clearly this proposal is a lose-lose situa
tion for everyone involved. It would destroy
a vibrant graduate community that already
exists in CroMem. and it would stick a num
ber of unlucky undergraduates into an
undesirable living situation. 1 urge graduate
and undergraduate students to unite and
urge Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya and Budget Director Tim
Warner to keep CroMem as a graduate res
idence and to find other creative solutions
to the housing problem.

Tenure Sawislak
In the midst of palm trees and sunshine,
men in black and the Mausoleum, a truly
disturbing event shook Stanford to its
rafters the week before last.
Did you notice? A seemingly obscure
decision was passed down from the Dean of
Humanities and Science's Office — Karen

Sawislak. they said, would not be heard
from, at least from their corner. In her quest
for tenure, for the affirmation of her inno
vative and controversial work, she was
given a flat denial and shown the door. The
aftershocks are still being felt.
It is important to remember the facts
when the University is shoving them under
the rug — blindfolding students and telling
them to enjoy their smoothies while it
repeats historic outrages that should have
everyone taking notice.
The fact is that Asst. History Prof. Karen
Sawislak's tenure denial is stunning — sim
ply shocking — in its injustice. The fact is
that the Dean Shoven's Advisory Commit
tee in charge of Sawislak's case looked at
four criteria: 1) the professor's teaching file,
2) the support from the professor's depart
ment, 3) an academic review by other histo
rians in the field and 4) her academic pro
duction. First of all, her teaching file is
unquestionably outstanding; her students,
peers and advisees think the world of her.
On the second criteria — every single pro
fessor from her department voted to give
her tenure (save one abstention).
It was the third and fourth criteria — the

ones that have little to do with the funda
mental values of teaching and mentoring
that students truly appreciate and values
that are growing increasingly rare — that
the committee focused on for its disap
proval. even though she clearly fulfilled the
department's standards.
Actually, Sawislak's academic record
and reputation are remarkable. She is high
ly praised by the likes of History Prof.
George Fredrickson. who proclaims that in
five years she will be the top historian in her
field; he is merely the President of the Orga
nization of American Historians.
But instead, the deans (with NO person
al knowledge of Sawislak's work or the field
itself) ignored the opinions of supporters
like Fredrickson — why? Are the commit
tee members afraid of innovative scholar
ship — are they too timid to put their
weight behind someone who goes against
the grain?
Several recent decisions give us a damn
ing answer — it is not only the deans who
are hesitating, but Stanford as well. We are
up against an institutional resistance to
change that threatens to strangle the voices
of innovation, of refreshingly new perspec

tives. The numbers alone speak volumes:
while half of Stanford students are women,
only 13 percent of Stanford faculty are —
which places it third-to-last out of 21 peer
institutions in a 1993 survey.
Only 12 of the 90 associate deans and
department heads are women, and not a
single dean of the University's seven
schools is female. This ruinous record is
especially incriminating when it comes to
the History Department — consider that
since 1982, the deans approved 18 of the 19
male professors recommended for tenure
(The 19th was later approved).
But for the nine female professors rec
ommended, the deans denied tenure to
three, postponed one and even demoted
another! But the University avoids dis
cussing these numbers like the plague, even
when a former dean admits that women do
suffer from a bias in tenure decisions.
So what, you might say. Why should I
care about some random professor whom
I've never heard of? Because this fight con
cerns itself not with a single professor, but
with disturbing trends with deep roots —
black clouds of reactionism are gathering
on the horizon, seeking to assault the very
