# Garry Grundy: Anything for the kids
## Abolishment of grades would foster education 
### 
DO YOU REMEMBER how well
you did when learning how to ride
a bike? What about the grade you
received when you took your first and sec
ond tour around the block in tluit ol' Cadil
lac de Ville? Or better yet — what was the
grade you got on that lirst meal you tried to
cook?
I hat fact is: you never received grades
lor these momentous learning experiences:
just a lot ol loving constructive criticism
from many different angles.
So why then cannot Stanford operate in
the same fashion? Why should higher learn
ing be any different than operating a vehicle
or cooking up chitterlings? How would you
take it if someone told you: " These pig feet
ain't cooked right. C+."
Hell, make your own damn pigs' feet!
One must understand that issuing grades
stifles the spirit of learning more than any
other component of the university experi
ence.
So lets get rid of them. Abolish grades
entirely — and replace them with written
evaluations formulated by the professor. I
know it sounds a bit absurd, but it's exactly
what this campus needs to foster a healthy
intellectual spirit.
First, let's understand what "education"

means. It conies from the I atin cducere,
which means "to draw out or lead forth."
What better way "to lead" a student into a
classroom than knowing he cannot fail, that
he can only grow, and that his sweat won't
be cheapened by its rendering into a letter
grade.
Wouldn't it be nice to take as many
courses as one desires Japanese history,
computer science, I'rench literature, studio
art. Students could taste every dish at Stan
ford's buffet without worrying about suffer
ing from the indigestion of letter grades.
No guilt. Just pure unmitigated learning
for the sake of learning. A true academic
paradise that would even make Dante
blush. And think of how interactions with
faculty would change as a result of uproot
ing the standard grading system that now
fetters us.
Professors will have to place that new
book they're writing on the back burner and
serve some love and attention to the under
graduate population at this research
obsessed university. Writing student evalua
tions for every student, though il sounds
taxing, will keep those esoteric academics
on their toes and in touch with their stu
dents.
I'liink about those papers that you nor

mally get back with just a few comments
and a letter grade plastered to the last page.
What do you look at first? Your eyes run
immediately to that one dominate squiggle
011 the page: B . "This paper wasn't that
bad!" you think. Comments become a moot
point.
Now, il the paper had 110 letter grade
merely comments then the response
would be quite different. "So, you find niv
writing rich, though at times obscure and
cryptic; analysis is also lacking, yet niv paper
is well-constructed. "Cool. I'll re-work it."
Suddenly you are "led" (as education
should do) to an understanding of yourself
and the subject that you may have ignored
had there been a "B " on the page.
I lie closest 1 have evet seen Stanford
come to a grade-less system was my fresh
man experience in SI E. Our term papers
were clothed with comments from the pro
fessor and writing instructor there were
no grades placed on the papers; the grade
was secondary to understanding the buffet
of books that the directors had prepared. In
fact, the liist time I evci s;iw a letter grade
lb 1 niv work 111 SI I was 011 the computer
monitoi after I hail logged onto Axess.
I hat was when the indigestion set in.
I felt as if the value of all ntv work had

been bitterly diminished, translated into
one capital letter that summed up my entire
learning experience for those weeks.
I low quaint?
Imagine the end of a course under a
gradeless system. Students would log onto
axess not to see several letters on the moni
tor next to a course title; rather, students
would flock to see a written evaluation of
their progress, progression being the
quintessential element to education: move
ment. motion, "to lead forth."
No one could go awry under this system;
we are all moving at different paces, all
being led toward the same site of truth and
illumination. Who cares if you arrive before
I do? We'll get there — without enduring
the intellectual combat that we are forced to
engage in under the current grading system.
Ask yourself: why do you need a grade?
1 can only think of one reason: to feel supe
rior to your peers. In essence, is that not
what an "A" represents that you can
bullshit a little better than I can or that you
can derive a formula with a little more
speed? Ctrades inspire competition; they
even inspire dishonesty, promoting students
to cheat and enroll in courses that they
know will not hurt their transcript and
thus improve their chances of getting a job

or gaining admittance to graduate school.
So what then do we use to gauge the per
formance* of our academic all-stars consid
ering that grad schools and jolts are grade
obsessed?
As an alternative to the primitive all
against all and in conjunction with quarter
ly evaluations, 1 propose that professors also
serve up elaborate evaluations for students
at the end of students' four years here. I he
student shall seek out two or more profes
sors who will be responsible for a "Senior
Academic Appraisal," which aims to high
light the extraordinary accomplishments ol
a student over his four years on The Farm.
In the end. this new and progressive
approach toward learning will increase
interaction between students and professors
while encouraging a very genuine spirit of
curiosity and experimentation, thus holding
professors more responsible for undergrad
uate needs. I Jnder such a gradeless system,
minds will truly move, and studies will most
certainly blossom.
As for our professors' publishing... well,
that's another story.
