forces of progress and innovation that have
kept American academic discourse
indeed, American society — alive and fresh.
Three thousand miles away. Harvard
and Yale have also denied tenure to accom
plished and innovative women scholars, in
cases strikingly similar to Sawislak's. ( an
there be no connection? Hie fact is that the
record of tenure-granting all over this coun
try for women, minorities — anyone who
seeks to challenge the status quo, the old
boy network — is abysmal.
One cannot avoid the fact that this cast' is
intricately tied to the current battle in our
society between the forces of reaction, fear
ful of those who threaten their comfortable
thrones, and the people who seek to right
historical wrongs, who call for long-term
vision and.do NCll pander, lu -tlic
quo.
Will we stand idly by while the IK'
regents say that racism is dead? Will we tui 11
the page when we read of hate mongering
xenophobes targeting immigrants even
legal ones — who not so coincidentallv are
of color? Will we ignore a symbolic in justice
— a woman in an overwhelmingly white
male world who dares challenge the norm,
who seeks to shed new light and overcome
the shackles of intellectual stagnation and is
in turn rudely shown the door?
It is time for this to stop. It is time to throw
a wrench into the old, irrelevant bureaucrat
ic machinery that seeks to make Stanford as
unthreatening and safe as possible. It is lime
for the students at Stanford to take a stand
against those who seek to rid this campus of
those who challenge the norm, who show us
a new way of doing things, who seek to
enlighten us. It is time to make our voices
heard to those who might listen.
Will you?

Valuable safety reminder
Thanks for reminding students to obey
traffic laws when biking on campus.
Last week while driving across campus
after dark. I encountered 27 cyclists. Only
one was wearing a helmet. Only three had
bike lights (and one of those was a hand
held flashlight). Not one stopped at stop
signs.
Groups of four or five straggled all over
the street, using both lanes and forcing an
oncoming car to stop to avoid hitting them.
Others dashed clown the sidewalks and

crossed streets in pedestrian walkways. ()ne
turned left in front of a car at a stop sign
without waiting to see whether the driver
had noticed him passing on the right.
Please, students: wear light or reflective
clothes after dark. I Jse a bike light. Ride
with traffic, not against it. I)on't assume that
drivers will expect you to seize the right of
way they are bigger than you are.
We'd all like to see you survive to gradu
ation.

Smokers have rights
Tn DaiToTT Fvans' Nov. 1 iToTiimn that
concerned the injustice of his getting a tick
et while illegally parked, he suggested that
instead of cracking down on parking viola
tions. the police should instead crack clown
on smokers.
Smokers are a small minority at Stan
ford, so I suppose that's why 1 vans thought
he could use lis as a smoke screen (pardon
the pun) for his illegal parking activity. Well
damn it. I won't be oppressed!
What I vans has suggested is illegal and
against University policy: smokers arc
allowed bv law and University policy to
smoke out of doors away from entrances to
buildings. Conversely, the law and I 'niveisi
ty policy make it quite clear that one cannot
park in a /.one for which you do not have a
permit.
Now I understand that there are those
who sympathize with I vans. I liev sa\ that
because smoking harms both smokers and
non-smokers, it should be outlawed I must
remind these sympathizers that we live in
what is known as a society. I hat means that
there are lots of people all around you doing
things that potentially cause y>u harm.
Among these activities are: smoking, drink
ing. riding a bike, playing I lisbee golf, erect
ing power lines and. ironically for I vans,
driving.
Driving is particularly bad. as it killed
43,363 Americans in IWS alone (source:
N( I IS). I could smoke five packs a day.and
get run down in mv prime by Evans as he
attempts to get his cai out ol the red zone
before the 5-0 (police) arrive.
Thus you must acknowledge my (iod
given right to inhale tar and to blow it down
your lungs too. unless you also want to give
up the ear that you illegally park. II you
decide to keep the car and be a part ol soci
ety. you must not only deal with smoking,
but congested highways. Hustler maga/inc,
the Christian Coalition, the I JI'N fall sched
ule and the Fleetwood Mac reunion torn.
But look on the bright side, you could be
living in Europe. How can people who live
in the most smoke free part of the world

bitch about the lew smokers who do exist?
lo the police: keep writing those parking
tickets when people knowingly break the
law. In tact. I think you should crack down
on illegal parking even more. And while
you're writing that ticket. I eel free to light up
your favorite smoke. < iod Bless America.

Decrying intrusive cyclists
In his column on I inlay. Nov. If. I Jarron
I vans complained of the intrusiveness ol
smoking: "(when) they're walking in front
ol me and the wind's blowing the right way,
it gets personal." Campus Police, he
believes, should pa\ moie Tilknlion to
smokers and less to bikeis. "What good will
gi\ing tickets to bikers do? Writing tickets
will not make students safer bike riders."
During my brief tenancy here, it has
become c|iiite cleat, however, that there is
no more intiusive campus entity than the
student biker.
I.very weekday, bikeis consistently
harass pedestrians Hikers ride at high
speeds through individual pedestrian's safe
space, a space in which one would never
allow anothci unknown human being to
walk or stand without eliciting a violent
action or outburst.
I hey regularly assume light ol way
when intersecting a pedestrian and dial
lengc the right-ol way ol'othei bikers. I Ins
violation of space produces unnecessary
and constant fear in the campus pedestrian
and is a potential source ol more serious
trouble.
I here is no doubt that pedestrians (and
other bikers) are struck by bikeis every day.
I am a victim and a regular witness. I his is a
grave situation lor the I Jniversity, which has
failed to provide adequate conveyance
structures to protect pedestrians and has
tailed l<> enforce basic mlcs ol the road to
protect bikers from vehicle traffic (and vice
versa).
I he operative expression here is fear. I
know that when I am on a bike, I feel that I
am operating quite safely when close lo
pedestrians. However, the actual state of
nsk cannot be considered a legitimate sur
rogate for the perceived fear by the campus
pedestrian. I hat fear is very real and sen
oitsly degrades the pcdestiian experience.
I undatncntally, a university campus should
be first and loiemost a pedestrian-friendly
venue.
I he fact that bikers rarely stop at stop
signals is symptomatic of the greater irre
sponsibility ol the biking community. While
most riders have no respect lor vehicular
traffic, they further have no respect lor
pedestrian traffic. As a motorcycle driver, I
am more fearful ol bikers on campus than I

am of rush hour traffic on Alma, and if that
were not illustration enough, my fear dou
blcs when I dismount and walk to class.
I he same biker who I almost killed while
exercising my right-of-way for a simple right
tinn later impedes my walk so as not to hit
another biker. Crossing the main walkway
(fiom the Business School to Bookstore
fountain) during class transitions, is nearly
impossible. I now must resort to swinging
my backpack wildly as I cross so as to deter
bicyclists from invading my space.
I vans is right that penalties are not the
answer. Bicycles have been traditionally
treated as sub vehicular and must follow
some different rules in order to remain safe
themselves. However, the answer to the
problems ol road bikers and sidewalk hikers
can be found <>nlv through the bikers the ip
se Ives and the I Jniveisity.
Stanford must take responsibility for the
danger posed to its student pedestrians.
What is required is obvious: the main cam
pus thoroughfares must have bike lanes and
pedestrian safe crossings.
Riders must be restricted from narrow
walkways and elevated sidewalks intended
for pedestrians. I his can be achieved by
designating areas where bicycles must be
walked. I liese changes do not infringe on
biker's ability to travel the campus efficient
ly, nor do they proffer an unreasonable bur
den on the I Jniversity.
Certainly it is the cheapest and most
humane insurance Stanford can buy. Stan
ford, you cannot afford litigation resulting
from your negligence on this issues.
II you or someone you know has been
stiuck by a cyclist on campus, has struck or
been struck by a bicycle while in a motor
vehicle, or il you have a story to tell ol your
own. please e-mail: gooleyfr' I 'stanford.edu.
We need your voice, and you may have
legal recourse.

Si den (ilk preferable to road
I'd like to lake issue with p<lint one of the
"Cycling courtesy" editorial that appeared
in the Daily on Wednesday, Nov. 12. Il
essentially says that bicycles belong on the
road because they are vehicles, and vehicles
belong on the road.
Il also gives the justification that il is ille
gal to ride a bike on a sidewalk.
II you've ever walked / hiked around the
Stanford campus, I would bet a year's
tuition, you've seen a cyclist crash into a
pedestrian. What is the outcome of these
minor mishaps? Some cuts and bruises and
a great deal ol embarrassment. II people
bicycle on the sidewalks, this same breed of
mishap can happen (although it usually
doesn't because there is little congestion.

Congestion is the K1 • AI. cause of these
accidents).
()n the other hand, most of us have never
seen a bicyclist and a car collide. 11 lIS IS A
( K )()l) I 111 N< i! I fortunately have not
either. I lowever, a friend of mine has. I le is
now dead.
( ars are vehicles, and they belong on the
road; and yes, bicycles are vehicles, but I
would not make the logical jump that
because a bicycle is a vehicle it belongs on
the road (alter all, helicopters are vehicles).
And the second point, that we should
ride our bicycles on the road because that is
the law. Well, l\l like to direct your atten
tion to the column and letter that ran the
same day. I lie Hauer's column highlighted
the ridiculousness ol marijuana laws, while
Kimbcrly Maker's letter commented on a
phrase made bv Martin I uther King. And it
anyone in history lias showed us the impor
tance ol not following iui|iist laws, it was
him.
Them cycling cops can write me as many
tickets as they want, but when they travel
oil of the road onto the sidewalk, they
should thank me, after all, it's safer over
here for them too!

Sincere pity for Soren
Oh, how I feel lor poor, poor labitha
Soren. What a tough life she leads.
Never mind that she recently married a
brilliant writer who just happens to be a mil
lionaire. Never mind that at the age ol <0
she's interviewed the President of the Unit
ed States a lew times and covered two elec
tions. Never mind that she was the anchor of
a national cable network's news program.
I he reality is that unfortunate |Soren]
has been forced to "interact with celebrities
on a regular basis," a task she apparently
finds horribly distasteful because, world
weary "journalist" she is, she linds celebri
ties to be deathly boring.
I wen worse, she now faces the onerous
obligation ol spending a year at Stanford,
with the Knight Fellowships Program foot
ing the tuition bill and providing a
stipend.
While here, she's been forced to endure
such difficult classes as yoga, photography
and John Taylor's I con I, which, although
one ol the most popular classes among non
celebrity students, she linds "incessant" and
"bloody awful."' (Perhaps it takes time from
her extra-curricular interest, "swimming
and tanning at dc(iuerre pool ")
I thank (iod each morning that my 111 c is
not as unpleasant as (Soren's),
