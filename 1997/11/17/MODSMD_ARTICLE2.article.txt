# Smith remembered by friends, teachers
## Memorial service held for graduate student 
### Alison MacKinnon Contributing writer 
Andrew Smith's life and
achievements were celebrated Fri
day at a memorial service dedicat
ed to the doctoral student who died
last Saturday
For many, he was there in spirit,
among the students and faculty
gathered in the Briggs Room, next
to the English Department's li
brary where he spent much of his
time.
Friends and faculty who knew
Smith were encouraged to share
thoughts and memories of him dur
ing the gathering Friday afternoon.
Smith. 25, a second-year doctoral
student in English, died suddenly
last Saturday, possibly from an
aneurysm.
Originally from Scarsdale,
N.Y., Smith graduated from St.
John's College in Annapolis, Md.
and came to get his doctorate Stan
ford last year, where his main focus
of study was lXth-century British
literature.
Even those who did not know
Smith well were moved to speak
about this talented young man who
in a short time at Stanford had
touched so many lives.
To many, he was Andy, lover of
words and books, the hard-work
ing young man who had volun
teered to be the librarian, and who

had single-handedly organized the
English Department's library.
He spent long hours catalogu
ing hooks, ordering new volumes,
compiling questionnaires about
what books to buy and encourag
ing faculty to contribute their own
work to the library. He was so ded
icated that, as a co-worker joked,
she had to remind him to punch his
timecard, because she knew he
would put in overtime without get
ting paid.
There were tears and some
times laughter as each person
shared his or her own personal ex
periences with Smith. Perhaps
most moving was when a friend of
Smith's thanked the Stanford stu
dents and faculty for their help and
support.
Members of the department
have chosen to remember Smith in
several ways. Renaissance maps
that he was currently working on
will be hung in Briggs and later in
Margaret Jacks Hall, when the
English Department relocates
there.
Smith's family has also donated
many of his books to the depart
ment. The books are currently
being catalogued and will occupy a
place of honor on the shelves, each
stamped with a special seal from a
John Taylor poetry book, the liter
ature Smith was researching and a
favorite of his.
