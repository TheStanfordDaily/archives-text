Boycott mistaken

II IA VF PIC KF:I) grapes in California for most of my life, and I urge students
to he familiar with both sides of the boycott issue before voting in their resi
dence halls. I am disappointed to hear that MEChA continues to support
such ii negative action against grape workers.
First of all, over the past 14 years (the duration of its current table grape boy
cott), the United Farm Worker's union has chosen to abandon the vineyards and
has done very little organizing. In fact, many grape workers have voted to decer
tify the UFW as their collective bargaining representative. One of the reasons for
this is the UFW grape boycott. We reject the UFW boycott because it threatens
our jobs and livelihood. II students really want to help farm workers, they should
encourage more people to eat grapes.
Secondly, grape workers are among the highest paid workers in agriculture,
and we are treated fairly. California has perhaps the most restrictive health, safe
ty and labor laws in the country. It is quite disappointing to hear the UFW say
that these abuses are the industry norms. We own houses, we own cars, and we
have kids in college. The IJFW wants you to think that we live like savages so
that you will feel sorry for us. Those stereotypes are untrue and are insulting.
Thirdly, the original reason for the boycott was not pesticides. The UFW
called for the boycott in IW4 because it was unhappy about then Governor
Deukmejian's appointments to the Agricultural Labor Relations Board
(ALRB). Only later did the UFW mention pesticides. The five pesticides target
ed by the UI'W have either been eliminated or are currently scheduled to be
eliminated. II pesticides were really the issue, then why does the UFW boycott
organic grapes?
Freedom of choice is the real issue. Cardinal Roger Mahony rejects the boy
cott because farm workers are protected by California's unique labor relations
law, which enables workers to select what, if any. union membership we want
through certified secret ballot elections.
I urge Stanford students to reject the boycott so as to respect our freedom to
decide whether or not we want a union.
Please feel free to contact us for more information.

Grape Workers & Farmers Coalition

In response to the findings
of the Grapes Policy Com
mittee, University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost
Condoleezza Rice in 1995
charged the Dean of Students
Office and the Office of Res
idential Education to make
information available to stu
dents on the issues surround
ing the United Farm Work
er's ban on California table
grapes. Because many Stan
ford students come from
farm worker communities,
this issue is important to our
community.
According to the policy, all
dormitories must vote on the
grape issue by the end of fall
quarter. In an effort to edu
cate and to further dialogue
regarding the policy, The
Daily has gathered opinions
endorsing and discouraging
Stanford's participation in the
UFW's ban on grapes.

Boycott beneficial

MANY QUESTIONS HAVE arisen recently about banning California
table grapes in campus residences. In our eftorts to inform students on
this issue we have discovered some ot the most frequently asked ques
tions are those regarding the harmful health effects of pesticides, the rationale for
banning organic grapes and the status of worker wages. We would like to clear
up some misconceptions regarding these questions.
First of all, more pesticides are used on grapes than on any other agricultural
product (California Department of Food and Agriculture. 1992). The boycott
was originally formed with the intention of curbing the usage of captan. methyl
bromide, dinoseb, parathion and phosdrin.
Although progress has been made toward reducing pesticide usage, captan
and methyl bromide, which are two extremely harmiul chemicals, continue to be
used. Methyl bromide will be phased out by the year 2001. Yet, until then, thou
sands of workers will remain at high risk for chronic health problems caused by
their severe exposure to the above mentioned chemicals.
During our time at Stanford, we have the direct opportunity to impact the
health of these individuals by banning grapes in our residences.
People wonder why organic grapes have also been included in the ban on Cal
ifornia table grapes. There are two main reasons why organic grapes are includ
ed. One reason is that most of the grapes labeled organic may not necessarily be
so. For example, Dolores Huerta, co-founder and current vice president of the
UFW, personally witnessed growers placing non-organic grapes in boxes labeled
organic grapes.
Secondly, many organic growers are subsidiary entities of non-organic grow
ers. Many times this correlation means that fields are close enough together to
have the residue of pesticides drift to the organic fields.
The most frequently asked question is "How much do the workers earn?" The
median salary is $5,000 to $7,499 for those who are legally eligible for employ
ment and $2,500 to $4,999 for those who are unauthorized workers (Report of
the Grape Policy Committee Stanford University). This is hardly enough money
for subsistence. Both of these numbers are substantially below the poverty line.
Not only do people not have enough money for shelter and food, but they do not
have the funds to combat the illnesses that pesticides cause.
The United Farm Worker's union has helped farm workers gain various rights
for decades. The union was founded by farm workers, primarily grape workers,
and it continues to advocate for the rights of all farm workers.
The UFW is comprised of farm workers and their elected representatives. Its
gains have not only benefited its members, but have affected changes across the
board to non-union farm workers. The UFW has raised the American public's
awareness to the plight of the farm worker. The UFW and consumer boycotts
help workers who lack political and economic leverage to demand the rights they
deserve.
