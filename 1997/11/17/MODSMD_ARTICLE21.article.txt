### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — The Stan
ford men's soccer team s quest for
its first-ever Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation championship
was crushed by questionable offici
ating yesterday at UCLA's Spauld
ing Field.
The unranked Cardinal (13-4-2,
3-0-1 MPSF) lost its fourth straight
match, a 1-0 heartbreaker to the
No. 5 Bruins (17-2,4-1), leaving the
team in an uncertain position as se
lections are made for the NCAA
tournament. UCLA now receives
an automatic bid; Stanford will
learn its fate this afternoon.
The Bruins claimed the victory
— and their fourth MPSF champi
onship — in front of a home crowd
of more than MX) on a penalty kick
in the 75th minute. The decision to
award UCLA that kick was only
one of several calls during the game
that frustrated the Stanford bench.

"It was definitely a soft penalty
kick," said head coach Bobby
Clark. Bruin sophomore midfielder
Pete Vagenas converted on the
score.

The Cardinal got its 112 irst glimpse
of what lay ahead when junior de
fender Erie Vandevelde was ejeet
ed from the game five minutes he

the Bruins three yellow cards, but
only Stanford found itself down a
man.
Despite that, the Cardinal kept
the Bruins at bay, exhibiting a
strong defense for the first time
since its 2-1 loss to Indiana two
weeks ago. When the offense tried
to match up, though, it was again
shot down by the referees, who dis
counted a Cardinal goal in the hist

minute.
To the crowd and most of the
players on the field, the goal looked
good, leading Stanford goalkeeper
Adam Zapala, a redshirt freshman,
to leave his position to join in the
celebration. By the time he realized
the ball was back in play, it was
closer to the Cardinal goal than he
was.
Clark wouldn't comment further
on the legitimacy of the referees'
calls.
"We'll have to see the decisions
t)ii video," he said. "But it's tough
when you get a goal disallowed,
have a player thrown out and then
there's a soft penalty kick."
He commended the Stanford
players for continuing to play the
honest style he emphasizes despite
growing frustration.
"I really admired the way the
boys kept their composure," Clark
said. "1 feel sorry for them. For the
