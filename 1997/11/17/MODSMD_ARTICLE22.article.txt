FOOTBALL

■ SATURDAY'S RESULT:
Washington State 38; Stanford 28

No. 11 Washington State used the power
ful legs of running baek Michael Black and
the golden arm of quarterback Ryan Leaf to
shake off the upset-minded Cardinal 38-28 at
Martin Stadium Saturday.
Stanford (4-6, 2-5 Pacific 10 Conference)
lost its fifth straight game — the Cardinal's
longest losing streak since 1989 — in front of
;i Washington State-record 40,306 fans. The
loss was also the Cardinal's first to the
Cougars since that five-game skid eight years
ago.
Stanford is now guaranteed a losing season
despite starting the year as a favorite for the
Rose Bowl. The Cardinal is also eliminated
from bowl consideration for the first time in
Tyrone Willingham's three seasons as head
coach.
But the heavy underdog Cardinal had a
real chance for victory. Sophomore Troy
Walters returned a punt 77 yards for a touch
down 28 seconds into the fourth quarter to
give the Cardinal a 28-27 lead. It was the Wal
ters' second punt return for a touchdown in
two weeks and bis second in two years against
the Cougars (9-1.6-1).

But with its back against the wall and the
chance for a Pac-lO championship on the line,
Washington State roared back on its next pos
session, showing why it entered the game with
the nation's second highest-ranked offense.
Washington State drove 66 yards straight
through the Stanford defense, with Black
scoring on a 4-yard touchdown run for a 35-28
lead the Cougars never relinquished.
Black carried 27 times Jar .173 yards in the
game, taking advantage of the Cougars' wide
open offense to find holes in the Cardinal
front.
"This is one of those days where wc turned
it up a notch," Black said.
Meanwhile, Leaf, who struck a Heisman
Trophy pose at midfield during the Cougars'
postgame celebration, put on a performance
worthy of the award.
Leaf completed 23 of 37 passes for 258
yards and two touchdowns against a banged
up Stanford secondary, but even those num
bers do not tell the full story. Leaf, the na
tion's third highest-rated passer, consistently
made brilliant throws in critical situations
throwing on the run and under pressure, split
ting some good coverage with pinpoint accu
racy and even running 4 yards for Washington
State's first touchdown.
With his performance. Leal tied the Pac-10
record for most touchdown passes in a season
(31) and set a new Washington State record
for single-season passing yards.
Stanford's quarterback situation changed
quickly at the outset. Redshirt sophomore
quarterback C had Hutchinson
sprained his right thumb on just the
second play from scrimmage.
Sophomore Todd Husak, who
started the second half of last
week's game against IJSC and
threw for 266 yards, replaced
Hutchinson and played the rest of
the game. Husak had an inconsis
tent day. making some good throws
and tossing two touchdowns hut
also throwing four interceptions.
"I've got to make smarter deci
sions and better plays." Husak said.
"I played really poor."
Stanford scored its most points
in five games largely because of
trick plays and returns the Cardinal
used to fool the Washington State
defense and special teams.
Trailing 10-0 in the first half.

Husak faked a reverse to senior
wideout Damon Dunn and found
Walters wide open in the secondary
for an easy 59-yard touchdown
strike to make it 10-7.
On the Cardinal's next posses
sion. Stanford faced a fourth down
from the Cougars' 32 and lined up
tor a field goal. But Husak sprang
into the shotgun formation and the
Cardinal broke into a wide-open
set.
Husak took the quick snap, and
with the Washington State special
teams in complete confusion, found
senior tight end Derek Hubbard
wide open at the 8. Three plays
later, Walters caught his second
touchdown for a 14-10 Stanford
lead.
It was yet another outstanding
day and record-setting perfor
mance for Walters, who had eight
catches for 1 IS yards to go along
with his spectacular punt return.

Walters now has 80 receptions on
the season, surpassing the single
season Stanford record held by
Brad Muster and only 10 shy of the
Pac-10 single-season mark.
Walters also moved into second
place on the Stanford single-season
receiving yardage list with 1,106.
He needs just 12 to break Gene
Washington's record.
Stanford had more trickery up
its sleeve in the second half, scoring
its third touchdown on a 9-yard re
verse play to Dunn.
But Walters' individual effort
and the wide-open Cardinal plav
book still weren't enough for a win
over a team playing in front of a
wild crowd and gunning for the
Rose Bowl. Stanford simply com
mitted too many costly mistakes.
The Cardinal had five more
turnovers Saturday and has com
mitted a whopping 22 during its
five-game skid, compared to only

seven takeaways.
Perhaps Stanford's most critical
turnover came at the end of the first
half. After Washington State took a
16-14 lead on a touchdown pass to
receiver Chris Jackson with just
over a minute to go in the half,
Dunn returned the kickoff 87 yards
before being pulled down at the
Cougar 4. Stanford had a first and
goal with a chance to take the lead
and the momentum going into the
locker room.
Stanford moved to the 1, but a
holding penalty moved the ball
back to the 11. Husak then threw a
bad pass right into the hands of
Cougars linebacker Brandon
Moore and the Cardinal came away
empty-handed.
"It was a turnover and you can't
have those in the red /one." Will
ingham said.
So, despite all the trickery, lead
changes and the fact that Stanford

had a fourth-quarter lead in a game
no one gave it a chance to win. the
outcome was predictable. Wash
ington State finished 6-0 at home
for the first time in Cougar history
and moved closer to its first Rose
Bowl appearance in 67 years, while
Stanford continued to struggle with
the mistakes that have derailed its
season.
Now the ( ardinal has nothing to
play for but bragging rights in the
100 th Big C iame Saturday. The only
surprising thing about that is that
IW7 was supposed to be Stanford's
year. Washington State seems to
have taken the Cardinal's place.
NOTES: Stanford fans who don't
have a ticket it) the 100 th Big (.iame
Saturday will be able It) watch the
game on ABC (ST V Channels 27
and 31), which was relieved of con
tractual obligations to the AB(' re

and the wide-open Cardinal plav
book still weren't enough for a win
over a team playing in front of a
wild crowd and gunning for the
Rose Bowl. Stanford simply com
mitted too many costly mistakes.
The Cardinal had five more
turnovers Saturday and has com
mitted a whopping 22 during its
five-game skid, compared to only

seven takeaways.
Perhaps Stanford's most critical
turnover came at the end of the first
half. After Washington State took a
16-14 lead on a touchdown pass to
receiver Chris Jackson with just
over a minute to go in the half,
Dunn returned the kickoff 87 yards
before being pulled down at the
Cougar 4. Stanford had a first and
goal with a chance to take the lead
and the momentum going into the
locker room.
Stanford moved to the 1, but a
holding penalty moved the ball
back to the 11. Husak then threw a
bad pass right into the hands of
Cougars linebacker Brandon
Moore and the Cardinal came away
empty-handed.
"It was a turnover and you can't
have those in the red /one." Will
ingham said.
So, despite all the trickery, lead
changes and the fact that Stanford

had a fourth-quarter lead in a game
no one gave it a chance to win. the
outcome was predictable. Wash
ington State finished 6-0 at home
for the first time in Cougar history
and moved closer to its first Rose
Bowl appearance in 67 years, while
Stanford continued to struggle with
the mistakes that have derailed its
season.
Now the ( ardinal has nothing to
play for but bragging rights in the
100 th Big C iame Saturday. The only
surprising thing about that is that
IW7 was supposed to be Stanford's
year. Washington State seems to
have taken the Cardinal's place.
NOTES: Stanford fans who don't
have a ticket it) the 100 th Big (.iame
Saturday will be able It) watch the
game on ABC (ST V Channels 27
and 31), which was relieved of con
tractual obligations to the AB(' re

FOOTBALL

■ SATURDAY'S RESULT:
Washington State 38; Stanford 28

No. 11 Washington State used the power
ful legs of running baek Michael Black and
the golden arm of quarterback Ryan Leaf to
shake off the upset-minded Cardinal 38-28 at
Martin Stadium Saturday.
Stanford (4-6, 2-5 Pacific 10 Conference)
lost its fifth straight game — the Cardinal's
longest losing streak since 1989 — in front of
;i Washington State-record 40,306 fans. The
loss was also the Cardinal's first to the
Cougars since that five-game skid eight years
ago.
Stanford is now guaranteed a losing season
despite starting the year as a favorite for the
Rose Bowl. The Cardinal is also eliminated
from bowl consideration for the first time in
Tyrone Willingham's three seasons as head
coach.
But the heavy underdog Cardinal had a
real chance for victory. Sophomore Troy
Walters returned a punt 77 yards for a touch
down 28 seconds into the fourth quarter to
give the Cardinal a 28-27 lead. It was the Wal
ters' second punt return for a touchdown in
two weeks and bis second in two years against
the Cougars (9-1.6-1).

But with its back against the wall and the
chance for a Pac-lO championship on the line,
Washington State roared back on its next pos
session, showing why it entered the game with
the nation's second highest-ranked offense.
Washington State drove 66 yards straight
through the Stanford defense, with Black
scoring on a 4-yard touchdown run for a 35-28
lead the Cougars never relinquished.
Black carried 27 times Jar .173 yards in the
game, taking advantage of the Cougars' wide
open offense to find holes in the Cardinal
front.
"This is one of those days where wc turned
it up a notch," Black said.
Meanwhile, Leaf, who struck a Heisman
Trophy pose at midfield during the Cougars'
postgame celebration, put on a performance
worthy of the award.
Leaf completed 23 of 37 passes for 258
yards and two touchdowns against a banged
up Stanford secondary, but even those num
bers do not tell the full story. Leaf, the na
tion's third highest-rated passer, consistently
made brilliant throws in critical situations
throwing on the run and under pressure, split
ting some good coverage with pinpoint accu
racy and even running 4 yards for Washington
State's first touchdown.
With his performance. Leal tied the Pac-10
record for most touchdown passes in a season
(31) and set a new Washington State record
for single-season passing yards.
Stanford's quarterback situation changed
quickly at the outset. Redshirt sophomore
quarterback C had Hutchinson
sprained his right thumb on just the
second play from scrimmage.
Sophomore Todd Husak, who
started the second half of last
week's game against IJSC and
threw for 266 yards, replaced
Hutchinson and played the rest of
the game. Husak had an inconsis
tent day. making some good throws
and tossing two touchdowns hut
also throwing four interceptions.
"I've got to make smarter deci
sions and better plays." Husak said.
"I played really poor."
Stanford scored its most points
in five games largely because of
trick plays and returns the Cardinal
used to fool the Washington State
defense and special teams.
Trailing 10-0 in the first half.

Husak faked a reverse to senior
wideout Damon Dunn and found
Walters wide open in the secondary
for an easy 59-yard touchdown
strike to make it 10-7.
On the Cardinal's next posses
sion. Stanford faced a fourth down
from the Cougars' 32 and lined up
tor a field goal. But Husak sprang
into the shotgun formation and the
Cardinal broke into a wide-open
set.
Husak took the quick snap, and
with the Washington State special
teams in complete confusion, found
senior tight end Derek Hubbard
wide open at the 8. Three plays
later, Walters caught his second
touchdown for a 14-10 Stanford
lead.
It was yet another outstanding
day and record-setting perfor
mance for Walters, who had eight
catches for 1 IS yards to go along
with his spectacular punt return.

Walters now has 80 receptions on
the season, surpassing the single
season Stanford record held by
Brad Muster and only 10 shy of the
Pac-10 single-season mark.
Walters also moved into second
place on the Stanford single-season
receiving yardage list with 1,106.
He needs just 12 to break Gene
Washington's record.
Stanford had more trickery up
its sleeve in the second half, scoring
its third touchdown on a 9-yard re
verse play to Dunn.
But Walters' individual effort
and the wide-open Cardinal plav
book still weren't enough for a win
over a team playing in front of a
wild crowd and gunning for the
Rose Bowl. Stanford simply com
mitted too many costly mistakes.
The Cardinal had five more
turnovers Saturday and has com
mitted a whopping 22 during its
five-game skid, compared to only

seven takeaways.
