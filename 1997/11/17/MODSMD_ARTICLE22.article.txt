■ SATURDAY'S RESULT:
Washington State 38; Stanford 28

No. 11 Washington State used the power
ful legs of running baek Michael Black and
the golden arm of quarterback Ryan Leaf to
shake off the upset-minded Cardinal 38-28 at
Martin Stadium Saturday.
Stanford (4-6, 2-5 Pacific 10 Conference)
lost its fifth straight game — the Cardinal's
longest losing streak since 1989 — in front of
;i Washington State-record 40,306 fans. The
loss was also the Cardinal's first to the
Cougars since that five-game skid eight years
ago.
Stanford is now guaranteed a losing season
despite starting the year as a favorite for the
Rose Bowl. The Cardinal is also eliminated
from bowl consideration for the first time in
Tyrone Willingham's three seasons as head
coach.
But the heavy underdog Cardinal had a
real chance for victory. Sophomore Troy
Walters returned a punt 77 yards for a touch
down 28 seconds into the fourth quarter to
give the Cardinal a 28-27 lead. It was the Wal
ters' second punt return for a touchdown in
two weeks and bis second in two years against
the Cougars (9-1.6-1).

But with its back against the wall and the
chance for a Pac-lO championship on the line,
Washington State roared back on its next pos
session, showing why it entered the game with
the nation's second highest-ranked offense.
Washington State drove 66 yards straight
through the Stanford defense, with Black
scoring on a 4-yard touchdown run for a 35-28
lead the Cougars never relinquished.
Black carried 27 times Jar .173 yards in the
game, taking advantage of the Cougars' wide
open offense to find holes in the Cardinal
front.
"This is one of those days where wc turned
it up a notch," Black said.
Meanwhile, Leaf, who struck a Heisman
Trophy pose at midfield during the Cougars'
postgame celebration, put on a performance
worthy of the award.
Leaf completed 23 of 37 passes for 258
yards and two touchdowns against a banged
up Stanford secondary, but even those num
bers do not tell the full story. Leaf, the na
tion's third highest-rated passer, consistently
made brilliant throws in critical situations
throwing on the run and under pressure, split
ting some good coverage with pinpoint accu
racy and even running 4 yards for Washington
State's first touchdown.
With his performance. Leal tied the Pac-10
record for most touchdown passes in a season
(31) and set a new Washington State record
for single-season passing yards.
