WATER POLO

■ SATURDAY'S RESULT: Stanford 12.
UC- Davis 9
■ SUNDAY'S RESULT: Stanford 9. USCS

Led by a defensive wall, the No. 2 Stanford
men's water polo team soundly defeated
third-ranked USC 9-5 yesterday after regis
tering a 12-9 victory over No. 14 I ( -Davis
Saturday in a pair of nonconference matches
at deCiuerre Fool.
"The defense has won a lot of games for
us," said Stanford head coach Dante Detta
manti.
"One of the parents bought T-shirts for the
guys, and they said Stanford water polo on the
front and D.O.D. on the back — Department
of Defense." he added with a smile.
The newly appointed department targeted

USC's ( roatian scoring trio — senior drivers
Mateo Juric and Simun Cimerman and junior
driver Marko Pintaric — in order to force
passes to Trojan players unaccustomed to
shooting.
And when that plan failed, the Cardinal
simply crashed in for the steal.
"We consistently stole the ball from their
center forwards." Dettamanti said. "But we
stole selectively [from Juric, Cimerman and
Pintaric]."
Stanford held the routinely overpowering
threesome to two goals. And its offense
wasn't too shabby either.
Cardinal junior holeman David Hay took
advantage of Stanford's unique rotating hole
man offense to net a blind shot with 4 minutes.
12 seconds left in the first quarter.
But I JSC fought back, resulting in a closely
fought match that was tied 5-5 at the end of the
third quarter — the fourth tie of the match.
But the Trojans' fate was sealed in the
fourth, when they were outscored by the Car
dinal 4-0.
