WATER POLO

■ SATURDAY'S RESULT: Stanford 12.
UC- Davis 9
■ SUNDAY'S RESULT: Stanford 9. USCS

Led by a defensive wall, the No. 2 Stanford
men's water polo team soundly defeated
third-ranked USC 9-5 yesterday after regis
tering a 12-9 victory over No. 14 I ( -Davis
Saturday in a pair of nonconference matches
at deCiuerre Fool.
"The defense has won a lot of games for
us," said Stanford head coach Dante Detta
manti.
"One of the parents bought T-shirts for the
guys, and they said Stanford water polo on the
front and D.O.D. on the back — Department
of Defense." he added with a smile.
The newly appointed department targeted

USC's ( roatian scoring trio — senior drivers
Mateo Juric and Simun Cimerman and junior
driver Marko Pintaric — in order to force
passes to Trojan players unaccustomed to
shooting.
And when that plan failed, the Cardinal
simply crashed in for the steal.
"We consistently stole the ball from their
center forwards." Dettamanti said. "But we
stole selectively [from Juric, Cimerman and
Pintaric]."
Stanford held the routinely overpowering
threesome to two goals. And its offense
wasn't too shabby either.
Cardinal junior holeman David Hay took
advantage of Stanford's unique rotating hole
man offense to net a blind shot with 4 minutes.
12 seconds left in the first quarter.
But I JSC fought back, resulting in a closely
fought match that was tied 5-5 at the end of the
third quarter — the fourth tie of the match.
But the Trojans' fate was sealed in the
fourth, when they were outscored by the Car
dinal 4-0.
I played 11 guys in that game,"
Dettamanti said. "That gave our
starters a chance to rest. In the
fourth quarter they were really
scoring.... We're always telling
the guys [in practice], 'This is for
the fourth quarter.'"
With the victory, the Cardinal
(17-5, 6-2 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) extended its winning
streak to four games, gained a 2-1
advantage over the Trojans (16-6,
4-3) on the season and edged one
step closer to an NCAA Champi
onship bid.
"I think we're the team to beat,"
said senior defenseman Nathan
Osborn. "No one wants to play us..
.. We're kind of the wild card."
In Saturday's 12-9 victory
against the Aggies, Walburger
kicked off a four-goal Cardinal
scoring barrage with one of his
patented garbage goals with 4:10
left in the first.
A UC-Davis counterattack in
the fourth cut the lead to three, but
the Cardinal held on.
"The only thing I can say is we
got through the game with a win,"
Dettamanti said. "Human nature
being what is, they (were) all look
ing ahead to [ USCJ."
Next up for Stanford: the Big
Splash against Cal Saturday morn
ing at deGuerre Pool.
