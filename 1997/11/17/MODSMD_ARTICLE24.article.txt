Tti6 Cardinal will be joined by the
Oregon men's and women's teams,
which finished second in the race at Dell
Urich Golf Course.
The men totaled 50 points on the

10,000-meter course, which was 2,(HM)
meters longer than the Stanford course
used for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships. The length increase
didn't prevent the Cardinal from claim
ing the top spot, 34 points ahead of the
Ducks.

Championships

"We wanted to come together and

run strong together," said head coach
Vin Lananna. "We were aiming to score
50 points, and that's exactly what we
did. The team did all we could do to
qualify."
Senior Nathan Nutter was the top
Stanford finisher on the men's side,
placing fourth with a time of 30 minutes,
37 seconds. Junior Brad I lauser finished
a close fifth with the same time.
Juniors Jason Balkman and Brent
Mauser finished seventh and ninth with
times of 31:09 and 31:19, respectively.
Stanford's final scored runner was ju-
nior Jonathan Weldon, who fin
ished 25th overall with a time of
32:05.
"We were light in the back posi
tions because we made a couple of
substitutions right before the start,"
Lananna said.
The men's individual champion
was UCLA's Mebrahtom Ke
flezighi, who finished the course in
30:15. Second place went to Pac-10
champ Bernard Lagat of Washing
ton State.
The women's race shaped up
much like the Pac-10 Champi
onships. Arizona's Amy Skieresz
ran away from the field again, fin
ishing the 5,000-meter course in
16:59. Skieresz has won 13 consecu
tive races over the last three sea
sons.
Stanford freshman Julia Stamps
was 14 seconds off the lead — good
for second place, the first in a string
of Stanford runners. Her time of
17:13 was four seconds better than
sophomore teammate Sally Glynn,
who finished third.
Junior Mary Cobb was fourth in
17:18, just ahead of fifth-place
Sarna Renfro (17:20), a senior. Se
nior Sara Moore, the final scored
runner for Stanford, finished 23rd
in 18:22.
"I felt they all raced extremely
well by running in a close, tight-knit

pack," said assistant coach Beth Al
ford-Sullivan. "That's what it is
going to take for us to do well at the
NCAAs. Our top kids had a day
that shows what they are capable
of."
The women's total for the race
was just 37 points, 41 ahead of sec
ond-place Oregon. Marie Davis

and Milena Glusac had a good
showing for the Ducks — as they
did at Pac 10s — finishing sixth and
seventh, respectively.
Stanford now has a week to pre
pare itself physically and mentally
for next Monday's NCAA Champi
onship, where it will defend its na
tional title of a year ago.
