If the good teams are the ones who make it look
easy, then the No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball
team must be one of the best.

■ SUNDAY S RESULT: Stanford defeated
Washington State 15-7,15-5,15-3

With No. 16 Washington and No. 12 Washington
State coming to town, the Cardinal (26-2, 17-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) was geared up for what was ex
pected to be its most competitive home weekend all
season.
But Stanford must have been a little more pre
pared than the competition, because it notched a
nice three-game win Friday over Washington 15-12,
15-7, 15-9 before completely dismantling the
Cougars Saturday 15-7,15-5,15-3.
"I think we were really anxious to get these two
matches out of the way," said senior co-captain Lisa
Sharpley.
"We knew this would pretty much clinch a top
seed for us. I think we came out knowing what we
had to do, and we played really well."
(lame one was a back-and-forth battle featuring
five lead changes, six ties and a barrage of sideouts.
Washington senior middle blocker Makare Desilets,
the nation's leading blocker, was big for the Huskies
(16-9, 11-5) but could only get support from senior
outside hitter Amy Tutt, as the rest of her team
mates floundered offensively.
With the score at 13-12, sophomore outside hitter
Kerri Walsh, finally swinging hard after her recov
ery from a shoulder injury, made a big crosseourt kill
for the sideout. Freshman middle blocker Jennifer
Detmer. who usually doesn't play through the back
row, nailed the back line for the service ace and
game point.
Walsh ended things with authority, completely
stuffing the Huskies' Dana Netherby, and Stanford
carried that momentum into game two. Senior co
captain Kristin Folkl got things rolling in that game

Senior middle blocker Barbara Ifejika hits through the Washington
defense.
with a powerful kill that sat one
Husky defender flat on her butt.
The Card then ran out to a 6-0
lead behind Sharpley's serving and
never looked back. Washington cut
the lead to K-7 on a Tutt service ace,
but the Huskies slipped from there,
while Stanford did everything
right.
The Card made all the great
plays, including senior middle
blocker Barbara Ifejika lunging
from her knees to hit a ball into the
open court and Sharpley playing a
ball off the raised basketball hoop
for a Walsh kill.
" I his was a tough match against
;i tough team," said head coach
Don Shaw. "We didn't let their
middles get away; we served tough.
'■Their outside hitters need to
carry more of the load. (Their per
formance) is not going to do it
against a team like us."
After the intermission Washing
ton fired out to a 5-0 advantage be
hind Tutt and Desilets.
But Washington would need
more than that. Beyond Tutt and
Desilets, only two I luskies hit over
.000 — Netherby (.148) and Kristi
na 1 .affling (.067).
Stanford pounded back to go up
7-5 on a kill from Folk), who fin
ished with a match-high 23. Then
sophomore outside hitter Sarah
( lark (10 kills, eight digs) got in on
the action to help stretch the lead,
and Stanford finally ended it with a
block from Detmerand Sharpley.
"Sarah Clark is on lire." Walsh

said. "All this season she's been
amazing in practice, and she's final
ly showing it in games. We came
out really fired up. We touched a
lot of balls (at the net), and we were
working really hard."
Stanford picked up right where
it left off against Washington State
Saturday, demolishing the Cougars
(22-6, 10-6) in under 90 minutes.
The Card hit an amazing .407 com
pared to Washington State's .149
and more than doubled the
C ougars' total team blocks (14-6).
"That was surprisingly easy,"
Shaw said following the match. "I
thought we did a pretty good job."
Shaw's concerns that his squad's
blocking time might be off facing a
tactically different team than the
over-the-top-hitting Huskies were
put to rest early. The Cardinal
spread out its offense, executed its
defense and made the Cougars
look like a fish out of water.
"They've got some problems of
their own," Shaw said. "They
haven't looked like a solid, chem
istry-type team all year."
Meanwhile, Stanford cruised.
Walsh led the way with a match
high 13 kills, while Folkl and Ifejika
added 10 apiece.
Having Walsh back "adds so
much to our offense," Sharpley
said. "It's not only having her hit,
but making other teams worry
about her. It's nice to have her
back."
The Cardinal closes out Pac-10
play this week with a rare Thursday
night match against California.
Stanford then concludes its regular
season Sunday night at 5 p.m. with
a home game against I iawaii.
