If the good teams are the ones who make it look
easy, then the No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball
team must be one of the best.

■ FRIDAY'S RESULT: Stanford dcfealed
Washington 15-12, 15-7,15-9

■ SUNDAY S RESULT: Stanford defeated
Washington State 15-7,15-5,15-3

With No. 16 Washington and No. 12 Washington
State coming to town, the Cardinal (26-2, 17-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) was geared up for what was ex
pected to be its most competitive home weekend all
season.
But Stanford must have been a little more pre
pared than the competition, because it notched a
nice three-game win Friday over Washington 15-12,
15-7, 15-9 before completely dismantling the
Cougars Saturday 15-7,15-5,15-3.
"I think we were really anxious to get these two
matches out of the way," said senior co-captain Lisa
Sharpley.
"We knew this would pretty much clinch a top
seed for us. I think we came out knowing what we
had to do, and we played really well."
(lame one was a back-and-forth battle featuring
five lead changes, six ties and a barrage of sideouts.
Washington senior middle blocker Makare Desilets,
the nation's leading blocker, was big for the Huskies
(16-9, 11-5) but could only get support from senior
outside hitter Amy Tutt, as the rest of her team
mates floundered offensively.
With the score at 13-12, sophomore outside hitter
Kerri Walsh, finally swinging hard after her recov
ery from a shoulder injury, made a big crosseourt kill
for the sideout. Freshman middle blocker Jennifer
Detmer. who usually doesn't play through the back
row, nailed the back line for the service ace and
game point.
Walsh ended things with authority, completely
stuffing the Huskies' Dana Netherby, and Stanford
carried that momentum into game two. Senior co
captain Kristin Folkl got things rolling in that game
