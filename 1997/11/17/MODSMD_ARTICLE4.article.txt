# Houses see cash surplus
## Dorm funds from past years pile up into significant sums 
### Patrick Bernhardt Editorial staff 
Many Row houses are finding themselves with an em
barrassment of riches as house funds, taken from money
hilled to residents, are accumulating surpluses whose
ownership is often uncertain.
I he Row housing office and house managers have
now developed policies to ensure that extra money is re
turned to residents at years' end.
Row house staff members, including financial man
agers, are selected winter quarter from among house res
idents and serve for a year, inheriting budgets and bal
ances from their predecessors for spring quarter.
As such, financial managers often have little knowl
edge of their houses' past financial history.
" The way it came in for me. we had a pretty substan
tial bank account balance." said junior Tyler Dennis, fi
nancial manager in Grove. "I don't know where that
came from."
Dennis declined to state how much he thought that
initial figure had been but indicated that Grove, after
making several purchases, now has a surplus of $I8,(XX).
Over the summer. Dennis attempted to determine if
IW(>-97 residents had been overcharged and should re
ceive a refund.
"We looked at the amount of money we had and
looked at the amount we had taken in from residents (in
1996-97]," he said. "We'd actually spent more than we
took in, so it wasn't their money."
I he money. Dennis suggested, had been accumulated
from earlier years.
"The way we see it, it's the house's money, so the res
idents here this year get to decide how to spend it."
I hat. said I aurette Beeson, the ()ffiee ol Residential
Education's assistant director of student management, is
consistent with University policy.
"If houses have reasonable ways
they want to spend excess money, if
they want to make purchases for the
house or improvement to the build
ing or grounds, that's entirely accept
able." she said. "But we don't want
managers to be making those deci
sions by themselves, we expect there
to bu discussion within the house."
Specific plans, she said, are han
dled on a case-by-case basis.
"I've just been here for two
years," Beeson said, stating that in
that time she's attempted to define
guidelines for financial management
in student houses.
Beeson said the residence agree
ment makes clear that houses that fail
to cover their expenses will have their
members individually billed to cover
the defecit.
That, however, has not happened
in her time on the Row, she added.
As for leftover funds, the Row of
fice is "just now beginning to look at
how much is a reasonable amount of
money to keep in reserve," she said.
Houses are expected to maintain
a "comfortable reserve" of 10 per
cent of one quarter's budget to han
dle emergencies and annual start-up
costs, according to Beeson.
For most houses this translates to
between $3,(XX) and $S,(XX), she said.
"If a house takes in more money
than it spends and it has an accept
able reserve, the expectation is that
they will be refunding that money,"
Beeson continued.
When junior Paul Taylor took
over as financial manager in Clifford
1 louse last year, that is what he did.
"We had $15,(XX) left over in our
account that we hadn't spent" at the
end of the year, he said, "so we re

funded about $3(X) per resident."
Taylor said, however, that that
was done without guidance from
Beeson or the Row office.
"I think it's kind of unclear
whether it's an official Row office
policy or if it's done because it's what
should be done," he said. 'The stu
dents should receive some of the
money back that wasn't spent; it's
their money."
According to both Beeson, Taylor
and Dennis, unintentional over
billing leading to refunds is common
among Row houses.
"In both of the past two summers
[Clifford] has refunded money," said
Taylor. And Beeson suggested that a
majority of Row houses conduct
year-end refunds.
"A lot of it has to do with inexpe
rience," said Dennis. "A financial
manager without experience in mak
ing a budget will make sure he has
enough extra, knowing he can return
it at the end of the year."
Hut the Row office is wary of re
taining too much money.
"We certainly prefer having too
much money to too little," she said.
"But we don't want to be doing any
thing to jeopardize the University's
nonprofit status."
Beeson said she and Ann Porteus,
associate director of Residential Ed
ucation. are currently talking with
University lawyers to determine how
to handle extensive reserve accounts.
In the interim, Beeson has begun
a series of quarterly reviews.
But she said she does not want to
be perceived as micro-managing,
adding that individual house man
agers have great discretion.
"1 think its a good system. You get
a lot of support from the Row office,
but it gives a house as a whole the
feeling that they're an independent
group," said Dennis. "I think it's
something that makes Stanford a lit
tle unique."
