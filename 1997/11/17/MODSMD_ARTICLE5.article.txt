### Dan Arnold 
In a precursor to this Saturday's
Big Game, a Stanford team heat a
team from IJ(-Berkeley Sunday in
the first annual Big Case, spon
sored hy Bain & Co. consulting
firm.
A business case involving Col
gate toothbrushes was given to each
team Friday afternoon. Teams then
had the weekend to put together a
marketing strategy which they pre
sented yesterday to a panel of
ludges from Bain. To examine the
case, teams used a mixture of tactics
ranging from computer models to
knowledge of consumer trends.
The judging was based on rigor
ol analysis, general business judg
ment and teams' ability to think on
their feet.
In a preliminary round, three
teams from each school competed
and the field was narrowed to one
team from each selected to go into

the finals. The Stanford team, con
sisting ol senior Michele Hwu and
Rajesh Shenoy and coterminal stu
dents Allen Chi, Claudio kni/ek
and Li-Cheng Wang impressed the
judges with its marketing plan and
professional demeanor and went on
to win the Big Case.
"Overall it was a pretty exciting
competition," said Kni/ek.
The winning Stanford team was
"a group ol friends who wanted ex
perience in doing case studies,"
Wang said. "The Big Case was a
perfect way to do some real-time
consulting."
"[The competition] was on our
home campus.. .we had to win."
Wang added.
Chi said he felt winning the Big
Case competition was like a sports
team winning a championship.
At the end of the day, detailed
commentary was give to all teams
based on the overall impression
they made and specific areas of

analysis. The Big Case was de
signed to he hoth a competition and
"a learning experience," according
to Cierald Chen, judge and associ
ate consultant at Main.
Members of every team were
given a mug, I shirt, and tooth
brush for their efforts. I he top two
teams also received trophies.
While most teams were com
posed of majors in fields related to
business, Leslie Lane, a manager at
Bain and one of the chief organizers
of the event said that an effort was
made to involve "as many people as
possible not just business or [eco
nomics] majors."
I he finalist team from ( al, com
posed of officers from the Honors
Students' Society, had no business
majors on the team. Peter Allen, a
junior majoring in Lnglish, said that
the Big( asc "was a challenge to see
what consulting was all about."
Team member Julia l eng added
that not being business majors

meant that they could draw on a
more diverse problem-solving
background.
The idea for the Rig Case was
originally introduced in the fall of
I l )% by Lane and associate consul
tant Shogo Tsuru. I he final form of
the competition was arrived ;it last
spring. According to I suru, at least
15 people from Bain have worked
on the competition either as judges
or organizers.
The three Stanford teams were
selected by submitting an applica
tion to Stanford Consulting, Stan
ford's student-run management
and consulting firm.
For the competitors, the Big
Case was a chance to exercise cre
ative problem-solving skills outside
of the normal pressures of school
life.
Asked if he was nervous, Stan
lord master's student Jorge Muhlia
said, "No, there are no grades or
teachers here, this is just for fun."
