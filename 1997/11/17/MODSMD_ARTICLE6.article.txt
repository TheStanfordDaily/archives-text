# Gates exhibit shows rich history of computers

A new exhibit highlighting the 50-year
development of computers is now on dis
play at the Gates Computer Science
Building. The exhibit, titled "Memories,"
is a joint production of the Computer Sci
ence Department and the Computer II is
tory Center in Mountain View.
Photographs and actual equipment
tracing the evolution of the desktop com
puter and the Stanford Computer Sci
ence Department fill the display cases
throughout the building.
Len Shustek. chairman of the Com
puter I listory Center and a former Stan
lord professor, said the Gates exhibit
shows not just a history of computing ma

chines, but the people who developed
and used them, and the society that has
been changed by them.
"We hope students will be encouraged
by learning the human stories that go
along with the development of the tech
nology. There will be students looking at
these exhibits who w ill become as signifi
cant in the computer business as those
whose pictures they see there." he said.
Several of the displays focus on the
late George Forsythe. professor and first
chairman of the Computer Science De
partment. The displays document the
people who built a world-class depart
ment from scratch in the mid-19605.
"Stanford recognized earlier than
most universities that computers were

more than (list another tool lor science
and engineering, and that they deserved
to be studied in their own right. Stan
ford's computer science department
played an important role in the develop
ment and use of theory, systems, scientif
ic computing and artificial intelligence,"
Shustek said.
Another portion of the exhibit stress
es the work of Stephen Cray, who de
signed the world's fastest supercomput
ers in the 1960s and early 19705. Ihe
CRAY-1, one of his most famous large
mainframe computers, weighed 5.3(H)
pounds.
"People who have grown up with per
sonal computers have no idea how huge
the room sized computers of Cray's era

were, and how limited in speed and ca
pacity, Shustek said. "It is a tribute to the
designers and users of those machines
that they were able to get so much out of
so little."
Other displays trace the evolution of
personal computers from the Xerox Alto
through the Apple 11. Radio Shack I US
HO and Commodore IT I Ironically, the
IBM Personal Computer, which began
the term "personal computer" and domi
nated the market for a number of years, is
represented only by its keyboard, which
some critics at the time considered one of
Ms weakest features.
Shustek said he hopes the exhibit
