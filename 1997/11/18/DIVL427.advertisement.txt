Twenty-five years ago, a young Stanford-educated
psychologist published a book that not only changed
our way of thinking about the mind, but changed
people's lives. The book was The Psychology ol
Consciousness and the psychologist was Robert
Ornstein. After a quarter century, Dr. Ornstein returns to
the subject of sidedness in The Right Mind. This book
is a thought provoking update that offers a new interpre
tation of the two sides of the brairi based on the latest
research.
