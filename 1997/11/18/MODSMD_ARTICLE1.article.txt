## Rally supports labor unions 
### Kumar Narayanan Contributing writer 
Speakers from several area unions
spoke yesterday at noon in White Plaza
about workers' rights and labor.
The event, titled "Labor Day: Work
ers Speak Out," kicked off a series of ac
tivities centered on workers' rights, cul
minating Wednesday in a speech by Unit
ed Farm Workers President Arturo Ro
driguez. The UFW represents many of
the immigrant farm workers who are the
main source of labor for the fruit industry.
The week is being sponsored by the
Coalition for Labor. Dignity and Justice,
a group made up of activists from Stu
dents for Environmental Action at Stan
ford and MEChA, a Chicano / Latino

student organization.
The event involved a diverse array of
speakers, from Antonio Abarca of Justice
for Janitors to a local United Parcel Ser
vice truck driver. Many union organiza
tions were represented, including the
Local Service Employees International
I Jnion 790. which was active in the recent
Bay Area Rapid Transit strike, as well as
the International Brotherhood of Team
sters and the AFL-CIO.
The common theme for many of the
speakers was student activism.
"I hope you balance your success with
involvement," said Keith Barros, who
helped organize in the recent I IPS strike.
"Find a way to help this world and the
people in it.... We can work together to
solve these problems."

Some of the problems addressed by
the speakers were close to Stanford.
Abarca urged students to sign a petition
circulating through the audience and join
a delegation to present the petition to the
Department of Athletics Friday.
Ihe Athletics Department recently
hired a new cleaning contractor. TOM,
which is under fire for its labor practices.
In a flier distributed at yesterday's event,
the union accuses I'OM of paying sub
standard wages and not offering medical
benefits.

workers at Bon Appetit, the company
