# Organizers, union representatives speak to open a three-day series
## Rally supports labor unions 
### Kumar Narayanan Contributing writer 
Speakers from several area unions
spoke yesterday at noon in White Plaza
about workers' rights and labor.
The event, titled "Labor Day: Work
ers Speak Out," kicked off a series of ac
tivities centered on workers' rights, cul
minating Wednesday in a speech by Unit
ed Farm Workers President Arturo Ro
driguez. The UFW represents many of
the immigrant farm workers who are the
main source of labor for the fruit industry.
The week is being sponsored by the
Coalition for Labor. Dignity and Justice,
a group made up of activists from Stu
dents for Environmental Action at Stan
ford and MEChA, a Chicano / Latino

student organization.
The event involved a diverse array of
speakers, from Antonio Abarca of Justice
for Janitors to a local United Parcel Ser
vice truck driver. Many union organiza
tions were represented, including the
Local Service Employees International
I Jnion 790. which was active in the recent
Bay Area Rapid Transit strike, as well as
the International Brotherhood of Team
sters and the AFL-CIO.
The common theme for many of the
speakers was student activism.
"I hope you balance your success with
involvement," said Keith Barros, who
helped organize in the recent I IPS strike.
"Find a way to help this world and the
people in it.... We can work together to
solve these problems."

Some of the problems addressed by
the speakers were close to Stanford.
Abarca urged students to sign a petition
circulating through the audience and join
a delegation to present the petition to the
Department of Athletics Friday.
Ihe Athletics Department recently
hired a new cleaning contractor. TOM,
which is under fire for its labor practices.
In a flier distributed at yesterday's event,
the union accuses I'OM of paying sub
standard wages and not offering medical
benefits.

Tresidder Union. The employees
and the management last spring
reached a tenuous labor agreement
after several months, according to
Enziso.
Workers deserve to have their
voices heard, said Bob Blanshay, an
international representative from
the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. "A lot of people don't
have the opportunity to have a col
lege education," he said. "They just
want job security and some basic
rights."
Several speakers discussed larger
issues, including the UPS and
BART strikes. Ray Kwon, a BART
mechanic and member of the Local
SEIU 790, stressed students need to
"realize that we have more in com
mon than separate We're all
fighting for this together."
Sarita Gupta, president of the
United Students Service Associa
tion, a national student action
group, emphasized the need to

spread awareness.
"It's our responsibility to educate
those who are riding by on their
bikes around us and tell them about
those who are struggling," she said.
"We need to live social justice."
Many presenters also addressed
the changing climate of labor. "A lot
of the children I talk to don't even
know what a union is," commented
Kwon.
About 100 students listened to
the event.
"It's exciting to see labor back on
college campuses and linking to
gether," said doctoral student Ethan
Kaplan. "Over the last 30 years, the
U.S. has seen a drop in issues of class
and of labor."
Organizers were pleased with the
turnout.
"We've been planning this event
for a long time," said senior Sa
lomon Varela, a co-chair of
MEChA and facilitator of the event.
"Originally, we just planned to have
[Rodriguez]."
In addition to yesterday's rally and
the Rodriguez speech later this week,
a poetry workshop is scheduled for
today at noon in White Plaza.
