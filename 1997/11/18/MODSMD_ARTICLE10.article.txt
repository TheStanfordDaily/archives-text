## Carey ousted 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —Teamsters President
Ron Carey was disqualified from a rerun union
election yesterday by a former federal judge who
found that Carey participated in an illegal scheme
to divert union funds into his campaign.
Carey said he will fight the ruling by Kenneth
Conboy. a special adjudicator in the federal
cleanup of the union. But challenger James P.
Hoffa emerged as the clear front-runner for the
presidency of the 1.4-million-member union.
Conboy's decision, which implicated other labor
figures and a Clinton-Gore campaign official, was a
devastating blow to Carey, who was known as a
champion of reform in a union long plagued by cor
ruption. Conboy also suggested yesterday that the
rerun, scheduled to end in March, could be delayed.
Carey "tolerated and engaged in extensive rules
violations" and authorized spending $735,000 in
union treasury funds "to help his flagging cam
paign," Conboy said.
"1 have determined that the appropriate exer
cise of discretion in this case is to disqualify Mr.
Carey from participating as a candidate in the
rerun election." Conboy wrote. He said it was
impossible to "excuse the impact of such significant
electoral misconduct."
Carey attacked the credibility of the witnesses
Conboy relied upon, and declared: "1 have done
nothing wrong and I will fight this decision until it
is overturned."
U.S. District Judge David Edelstein would hear
any appeal of Conboy's decision, and a decision at
that level could be appealed to a higher court.
But Conboy also ordered the election overseer
to investigate Carey's allegations that the Hoffa
campaign broke fund-raising rules. He suggested
that she petition Edelstein to delay the election
turn to the FBI for extra resources.
In his 74-page decision, Conboy also implicated
the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of State.
County and Municipal Employees, and a New York
labor lawyer in alleged illegal fund raising. Conboy
reported that Carey was aware of any conspiracy.
He also said Carey was told that Terence
McAuliffe, finance director for the CLinton-C Jore '%
campaign, helped raise prohibited funds for Carey's
campaign. McAuliffe has denied wrongdoing.
