LUXOR. Egypt (AP) — There were six men,
dressed like police in black sweaters with shoulder
pads and black trousers. Emerging from a white Peu
geot, they strode up to the ticket taker at the Hat
shepsut Temple, one of Egypt's archeological won
ders.
Ahmed Gassem remembers asking for their tick
ets. and what happened next.
"You want tickets? Here are tickets," said one of
the men. brandishing a gun. He fired twice at the 40-
year-old Gassem, hitting him in the shoulder and but
tocks.
Then, the six unleashed chaos, a firing frenzy that
seemed to drag on all morning but probably ended
after 20 minutes, soaking the dry. pale dust with the
blood of dead and dying.
The assailants fired randomly at tour groups leav
ing buses and walking into the temple. Hundreds of
tourists and Egyptians dived to the ground or scram
bled for shelter behind temple pillars, as police rushed
to the scene and returned fire. Police said they killed
all six gunmen.
"They started shooting everyone Egyptians, for
eigners. children." said a ticket taker at the temple.
Said Ahmed Gassem. "They were like madmen. Any
one moving they shot."
The massacre at the 3,400-year-old temple in
southern Egypt is an enormous blow to Egypt's cam
paign it) revive the tourism crucial to its economy.
Some travel agencies immediately canceled tours.
Egypt's Information Ministry said 70 people died
in the shooting: bO tourists, two police, two Egyptians
and the six attackers. The Middle East News Agency
said a Colombian woman died later after surgery in
Luxor.
As of late yesterday, police had identified 24 bod
ies. according to the news agency: 14 Japanese, six
Swiss, three Egyptians and one German. I he British
Embassy said five Britons were killed. There were
also reports that French tourists were killed in the
mountain shootout.
Egypt's Interior Ministry reported 24 injured: 12
Swiss, two Germans, one French, one Japanese, and
eight Egyptians. Eight of the wounded were in critical

condition.
I he attack began about 1 ):30a.m.. when si\ gunmen
dressed in black sweaters similar to the winter uniforms
ol Egyptian police climbed from a cat and started
shooting automatic rifles wildly.
Police killed one ol the gunmen outside the temple
after an hour-long gunbattle. Ihe other five assailants
hijacked a tour bus and then fled into nearby moun
tains. where police shot and killed them as well, the
Interior Ministry said.
As police brought the attackers' bloodied corpses
down from the mountain, about 100 Egyptians who
depend on tourism for their livelihood gathered at the
temple. Some spat on the uncovered bodies: others
shouted "No to terrorism!"
President llosni Mubarak called an emergency
meeting ol his ( abinet after the attack and was expect
ed to visit 1 uxor today.
Dressed in traditional black gowns, Egyptians lined
up outside Luxor's small hospital yesterday afternoon
waiting for news ol loved ones.
The militants hail been armed with six machine guns,
two handguns and ammunition all police issue.
Police also recovered two bags ol home-made explo
sives from the militants.

I'here was no immediate claim of responsibility, hut
the government blamed Islamic militants in southern
l .gvpt who have waging a violent campaign since IIW2l l W2
to oust Mubarak's secular government and impose
strict Muslim rule.
More than 1.150 people have been killed in the
insurgency, which at Inst focused on tourists, trains to
southern Egypt's main towns and Nile River cruisers.
In the past year, however, the violence has been
mostly battles between bands ol militants and police.
Many victims have been the militants themselves, who
demand the imposition of Islamic law, including a ban
on alcohol and the veiling of women. I hey consider it a
religious duly to light the government for not imposing
the Islamic code, known as Sharia.
I .uxor, ,M 5 miles south of ( airo. is within the sphere
ol militancy, but yesterday's slaughter was the first
major attack there. Ihe city's ancient temples and
tombs including that ol the boy king l utankhamun
makes it one ol lEgypt's top tourist destinations.
I he massacre look place on a broad courtyard facing
the mortuary temple, which is carved into the side of a
mountain rising from the desert and reached by a wide
flight ol steps. It was constructed bv Hgypt's only
