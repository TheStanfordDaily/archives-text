# Healthcare company to restructure
## 
### 
NASHVILLE. Tenn. (AP) â€” Faced
with a federal investigation into alleged
Medicare fraud, Columbia / HCA Health
care Corp. offered a restructuring plan yes
terday commitment to downsizing that
could include the sale of more than 1(H)
hospitals.
Columbia's board has approved a plan
to cut overhead and administrative costs
by rearranging regional operating units
and halving the number of divisions within
them. Later, board members will decide
whether to go further by selling nearly
one-third of Columbia's hospitals and
other assets.
The restructuring takes effect Jan. 1.
Any spin-offs could occur in a year to 18
months.
"This reorganization clearly signals our
intent to spin off in some form some of our
strategically aligned units into smaller
companies and reflects our commitment to
downsizing... to return the focus to local
hospitals and local groups of hospitals,"
Columbia President Jack Bovender said.
Company managers said they had not
vet determined how much money the plan
could save or how many employees might
lose their jobs. But Bovender said many

workers would simply be transferred from
Columbia's employee payroll to those of
local hospitals.
"If jobs are eliminated, many people
will be offered jobs back in the hospitals,"
he said. "As we downsize, our intention is
to take the overhead out. not to be reduc
ing costs at the caregiver level."
Columbia, the nation's seventh-largest
private employer, has about 2N5.000 work
ers and annual revenues of about $20 bil
lion. The company has been the subject of
a federal investigation since at least March,
when offices in El Paso. Texas, were raid
ed. That was followed in July by a seven
state raid in which truckloads of docu
ments were seized from Columbia hospi
tals and offices.
Federal investigators are focusing on
whether Columbia overcharged the gov
ernment's Medicare health care program
for the elderly, but they also have exam
ined the company's billing of the Medicaid
program for the poor and a military health
program.
()n July 25. company founder and ( hief
Executive Officer Richard Scott and Pres
ident David Vandewater were forced to
resign. On Julv 30. three Columbia middle

managers were indicted in Florida on
charges they overcharged Medicare bv at
least $I. K million. I hev have pleaded inno
cent.
Federal investigators say Columbia
itself is a target ol the probe, which means
the company could be indicted.
Since I homas Frist Jr. replaced Scott,
he has sought to soften ( olumbia's aggres
sive image. Unlike Scott, who sought to
make Columbia the McDonald's ol health
care. Frist said he's sending a message:
"bigger is not better."
Frist earlier announced plans to sell
Columbia's 1)1 billion home health care
business and most ol a benefits managing
company. Value Health, bought for $1.3
billion under Scott.
Now. pending board approval, the com
pany will spin oil three regional units
the America, Atlantic and Pacific units,
with 21. 45. and 42 hospitals each.
It does what we kind ol suspected it
would do. organize the company in a way
to enable the eventual sale or spin-off ol
hospitals." she said. "We still don't know
whether all or any of the entities will be
able to grow or even what they'll be worth
following the investigation."
