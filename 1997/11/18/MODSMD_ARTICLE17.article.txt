## Editorial Taking on the task 
### 
Fulfillment of report's
potential rests on how it
is ultimately implemented

Willi IN THE NEXT several years
Faculty Fellows and Residential
Tutors may take their place along
side RFs, RAs, I As, AAs and RCCs in
Stanford's residential education lingo.
Creating these two positions are among
the myriad suggestions for improving resi
dential life included in the report of the Task
Force on Residential Programs and Student
I lousing.
We commend the task force for endeav
oring to improve integration between aca
demic programs and undergraduate resi
dences, for emphasizing (lie enhancement of
academic and social support through the cre
ation of programs designed to meet student
needs at the various stages of their Stanford
careers and for trying to foster greater facul
ty / student interaction.
However, we caution that the realization
of these goals will be contingent on how the
report's suggestions are implemented.
Indeed, its provisions contain both the possi
bility for creating a model residential system
and the potential to adopt some ol the worst
aspects of residential life that currently exist
at several Ivy League institutions.
One of the centerpieces of the commit
tee's proposal is the creation of a fresh
man / sophomore residential cluster, which
would better integrate in-class and out-of
classroom learning and provide underclass
men with the guidance needed to make opti
mal use of their first two years. Programming
would be geared toward introducing stu
dents to the resources available on campus
and toward choosing a major.
Not only would this living arrangement
provide greater continuity between fresh
man and sophomore years, but freshmen
would also benefit from the guidance of
sophomores, many of whom would serve as
AAs in the residential cluster. This environ
ment could also combat the "sophomore
slump" by providing sophomores with lead
ership roles in their residences.
However, there are potential drawbacks
should the recommendations be implement
ed in a certain manner. As long as participa
tion in this cluster remains optional, fresh
men and sophomores who do not choose it
would not receive the full benefits of the
enhanced freshman sophomore interac
tion it provides.
Furthermore, associating the cluster with
Stanford Introductory Studies or Introduc
tion to the I lunianities programs favors stu
dents m the cluster over their classmates by
providing students in the cluster with in-resi
dence discussion groups and priority seminar
enrollment. With the choice to opt out of this
living situation, students not in the cluster
could be left out of these discussions and not
garner the full benefits of these classes.
However there could also be significant
drawbacks if all freshmen and sophomores
were required to live in a freshman/sopho
more cluster. Not onl\ would it drain four
class and three-class housing of the vital
encrgs ol underclassmen, but it would also
create an artificial divide between the sopho
more and junior year. Such is the case at

Princeton where as a result of a similar hous
ing model, underclassmen and upperelass
men rarely affiliate.
We suggest that these drawbacks can by
addressed bv preserving the residential clus
ter as a housing option and by concomitant
ly reducing the ambitiousness of the attempt
to integrate the in-and out-ol class compo
nents. ("onsidering that the whole purpose of
restructuring the housing system is to ensure
that all freshmen and sophomores receive
more effective guidance and support. efforts
should be directed toward integrating aca
demic and dorm life in ways attainable for
freshmen and sophomores in various dorm
settings.
Although we agree with the task force
that space within dorms could be used more
effectively, we believe that any move to con
solidate dorms into larger clusters along the
model of Florence Moore Hall or West
I agunila thwarts the committee's stated goal
of fostering student / faculty interaction.
(Yeating an aggregate "Wilbur" community
with a Wilbur identity and a reduced number
of RFs would be a prelude to the develop
ment of an impersonal living environment,
resembling the House and College systems
at 1 larvard and Yale. The popularity of Row
houses testifies to the premium Stanford stu
dents place on smaller residential communi
ties.
The benefit of adding graduate students
or postdoctoral fellows as Resident Tutors
who serve as assistants to the RFs is ques
tionable. Many graduate students were not
Stanford undergraduates and therefore few
would be intimately familiar with the Stan
ford undergraduate experience. Additional
ly. the presence of these students in the dor
mitory might provide an incentive for RFs to
be more distant from their residents by
charging graduate students with crisis man
agement.
As for changes in the advising system, we
believe that the committee is taking a posi
tive step in differentiating among the three
types of advising students need during their
time at Stanford advice on formal degree
requirements, advice on available resources
and advice on long-term career and scholar
ly matters and is adjusting the system to
address these needs more effectively.
The creation of a Resident Fellows pro
gram bringing faculty routinely into dorms
to work with students considering an area of
study is an improvement over the current
system. I his system would result in profes
sors spending their time advising students on
issues related to career and research oppor
tunities in their fields rather than helping stu
dents decide on classes to take to fulfill
(iERs. Ihe nuts and bolts advice of what
classes are best for fulfilling CiF.Rs is gener
ally better met by AAs and upperclassmen.
FinalK we heartily support the commit
tee's suggestion to create more all-freshman
housing and to require greater accountabili
ty for focus, academic and ethnic theme
houses.
While we commend the committee for its
efforts to increase the intellectual life of
dorms and to provide more resources for
freshmen and sophomores, we ask that in
the forthcoming implementation stages that
neither the informal, congeniality that char
acterizes the Rl /student relationship nor
the intimac\ of the small, multi-class dorm
community be sacrificed.
