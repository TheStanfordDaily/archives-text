## Slowing down and taking note 
### 
A SENSE OF
responsibility in
one's life is
important. For instance,
unless an utter lack of
social order is desired, it's
needed to live in pseudo
peace with others. Unless
one cares to have abso-

lutely no sense of self, it's even needed to
help you know who you are.
Hut beyond some of the more necessary
responsibilities in life, sometimes we add
plenty of unnecessary ones. For example,
one might buy too many toys like over
priced cars or stereos. ()r one can hide from
the rest of life by becoming obsessed with a
new hobby. These are "responsibilities" in
the sense that one then feels responsible for
making car payments, in protecting one's
possessions or in devoting all of one's free
time to the hobby.
We've seen the slogans: "Golf is life:"
"Reading is life;" "Football is life." Basical
ly, we often find ourselves sometimes mak
ing a hobby more than just a hobby or mak
ing stuff more than just stuff. We make
these things god-like.
We devote ourselves to them, thereby
filling up our days so that we don't need to
think about our lives.
The fact that this can happen makes
sense given that we humans are often devot
ed. passionate creatures. Hut in being so. we
can also find ourselves sucked into a one
dimensional world. That is. we make some

external factor (like a career or football)
LIFE. And without that particular obses
sion / passion, we find nothing.
Whoa, hold up! This does not mean that
I'm not criticizing all notions of "passion.
In fact, for me. some of the most admirable
people I know are the most passionate ones.
Only these people avoid the obsessive.
For instance, one's love lor football can
go beyond just that if it becomes obsessive.
The wife is okay. The kids are okay. Read
ing a great book is okay. Church is...
HELLISH because it interferes with Sun
day football!
Hut I would be careful to not snicker at
that Niner fan next to you. because it seems
to me that we all, at times, attach ourselves
to something, someone, an idea or whatev
er.
For instance, particularly at Stanford, we
often find ourselves concerned with new
responsibilities that allow us to feel a sense
of importance. That is, beyond the neces
sary duties ol life, we become obsessed with
doing and achieving more and more.
I've gotta spend all weekend doing prob
lem sets. I've gotta be a work for l )() hours
this week. I've gotta spend my 20s making a
lot ol money. I've gotta devote the rest of
my life to my career.
Despite how deeply ingrained our work
ethic may be, we need to strive to better dis
tinguish between true responsibilities and
illusory ones.
It's as though one day we saw the ham
ster spinning in its wheel and screamed out:

"I ean do that too!"
This is not it) say that some of us suffer
beeause we're motivated to take on more
"responsibility" than watching IS hours of
television in one weekend. But we do suffer
when we take on these activities for the
sake of collecting trophies, rather than for
the sake of developing as human beings.
The ancient l aoist text, The Chuang
T/u, says it well: "The fish trap exists
because of the fish; once you've gotten the
fish you can forget the trap... Words exist
because of meaning; once you've gotten the
meaning, you can torget the words. Where
is a man who has forgotten words so I can
have a word with him?"
But we often cling onto the "fish trap" or
the "words" â€” and forget the meaning of
what we're doing. I hat is, we pursue the
achievements of a well-respected career,
comfortable life or whatever it might be.
and we forget that there's more than the fin
ish line.
Life is about pursuing "passions." And
it's completely natural to become engrossed
in this pursuit. However, it would help to
stop in think about the motivation behind
our actions: Are wc pursuing the trophy of
ego-boosting success or are we actually pas
sionately involved in the experience or pro
cess? Sometimes, we're just too busy to
realize what we're missing.

engineering, is entirely too busy to think
about his by-line.
