# Stanford team wins programming tourney, ready to go international
## 
### Jaime Adame 
Teams from Stanford finished first and
third in a regional computing contest this
weekend, with the first place team advanc
ing It) the World 112 inals.
Six Stanford students participated in the

Pacific Northwest regional competition of
the Association for Computing Machinery
International Collegiate Programming
Contest.
The contest, which drew 51 teams from
Alaska to the northern half ol California,
was held concurrently at two locations:

Eastern Washington I 'diversity anil ( hiu
State, where Stanford eompeted. Aeeord
ing to Kris Rubin, the regional eontest di
rector, this year marked the lirsi time mori
than 50 teams had eompeted in the event
which is sponsored bv IBM.
Each three-member team at
tempted to solve six complex real
world problems using programming
skills, creativity and logic in the five
hour contest.
The first place Stanford team,
consisting of juniors Hubert Chen
and Chad Whipkey and doctoral
student (irigori Humphreys, solved
live out of six problems posed using
the (' programming language. Scor
ing wiis based on the number of suc
cessful programs, with time used as a
tie-breaker between teams that

solved an equal number of prob
lems.
"Stanford did very well," said
sophomore Dave Weekly, a mem
ber of the third-place team, along
with sophomore John Bauer and
doctoral student Mark Gritter. "It
was a good feeling to know Stanford
got five out of six and four out of six.
Many schools didn't even solve
one.'"
As an example of the problems
presented, Whipkey said the group
had to take two Boggle boards and
devise a program to find the words
common to both of them.
Rounding out the top five were
I JC-Berkeley, second place; Univer

sity of the Pacific, fourth place; and
I University of British Columbia, fifth
place.
Established in 1970, the contest is
the oldest and largest of its kind. The
first-place team in each region re
ceives a bid to attend the finals, and
additional wild-card teams are invit
ed as well. College students from
five continents vie for the right to be
one of the 50 teams that compete at
the World Finals, which this year will
be held in Atlanta, Ga., on Feb. 27
and 28.
The first-place team at the finals
receives a scholarship of $9,(XX), with
second place receiving a prize of
$4,5(X), and $1,5(X) being awarded to

third through 10th place.
"I was on the team last year that
finished 16th [at the World Finals]."
said computer science major Wlup
key. "I hope to do a little better this
year."
According to ('hen. a mathemat
ics major, the team already has an
idea of how to prepare for the finals.
"Of course, we'll lift weights and
drink lots of Gatorade." he joked.
"We'll also try to convince some
cheerleaders and the I'ree to join lis
in Atlanta, as psychological factors
are highly influential in determining
who wins competitions of this sort.
"Finally, we might also do a few
old problems."
