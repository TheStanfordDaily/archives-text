Define tasteful politics
The University should be. and no doubt
is. grateful for your support of Measure O
for the development ol roads, housing and
the shopping center, both before the voting
and again in your editorial, "Distasteful
Polities" (Nov. 13). But after reading what
you found wrong with the University's
effort to accomplish these things one is left
asking, what sort of polities would you be
willing to consider tasteful?
You never explain why sending "all IbOO
faculty and staff living in Palo Alto a letter
asking for their opinions on Measure ()"
represented a "failure... to respect the pri
vacy and integrity of voters." How does
sending people a letter, even one contain
ing an inquiry, invade their privacy? (If it
does, commercial interests invade my priva
cy on a daily basis.)
Still more mysterious is how the voters'
"integrity" was threatened. How else can
one recruit volunteers for a campaign than
to ask if they are sympathetic to it? And
what does it mean to urge the University to
"restrict campaign activity to authorized
persons"? Were those of us who wrote let
ters to the editor backing Measure () and
criticizing the content (such as it was) and
tactics of Measure M somehow unautho
rized to do so?
A University is not "politicized" when it
engages in political action in support of its

own interests, unless you believe that it is
barred from any and all political activity.
Suppose an effort were underway to
extend Prop. 209's ban on affirmative
action in public institutions to non-public
ones, such as Stanford not an entirely
fanciful supposition: would you then argue
that the University could not with propriety
communicate to faculty and staff its opposi
tion to such a measure?
If you believe that $350,000 (which
included prorated amounts of relevant Uni
versity salaries) was too much, just how
much would have been appropriate?
University President Gerhard Casper
has said that biggest single obstacle to
attracting new faculty and staff to Stanford
is the shortage of affordable housing. The
University cannot "solve" the problem, but
provision of rental units with a priority
for University faculty and staff is a step in
the right direction.
Hie average price of a house sold in Palo
Alto last year was about $500.(HX). Was the
expenditure of $350.CKX). 30 percent less
than the cost ol a single dwelling, truly out
rageous when the object was to secure pas
sage of a measure to assist the University in
coping with what its president considers its
most urgent need of all.
In deploring "such rigorous efforts to
overturn a measure expressing the concerns
of the community you seem to be equating
"the community" with the 38 percent of
Palo Alto voters who backed Measure M.

And if "rigorous efforts" are beyond the
pale, how flabby (and how cheap) a cam
paign could Stanford have run and still got
the job done?

I'm writing in response to Hobby Chen's
misrepresentation of my work during my
employment with the Stanford Quad. Stan
ford's student-run yearbook that has
recently fallen under much public scrutiny.
Chen's criticism amounts to nothing more
than unloundcd slander of my professional
ism and honest) while I served as co-photo
editor ot the '95-'% Quad, and I refuse to
engage in such destructive behavior.
He admits to knowing next to nothing
about .photography and then has the audac
ity to place responsibility for the explosion
of debt on the photo editors.
Just to clear the air. I spent an hour tin
the phone with some Ivy League yearbooks
and found that it is fairly common to spend
15-20 percent of a yearbook's total revenue
on the photo department — this makes
sense because a yearbook is essentially a
picture book.
