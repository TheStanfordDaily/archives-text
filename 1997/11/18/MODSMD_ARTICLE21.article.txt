# Foreign Bureau: Moscow
## Kelly Young Cosmonauts, Collins and experiencing history 
### 
FOR THE CASUAL observer, it
would appear that I have put aca
demics on the back burner this quar
ter. (iranted. this could be because I spend
a lot of time exploring Moscow and
attempting to understand this diverse cul
ture.
One part of my academic quarter that 1
have taken seriously is my tutorial that
Overseas Studies arranged with the chief
curator of the Memorial Cosmonaut Muse
um in Moscow.
I wanted to contrast the histories of the
American and Soviet space programs
how the "official" stories, in other words,
the products of Soviet engineering, differed
from first-hand accounts. After my summer
stint as a counselor at U.S. Space Camp, I
was well-versed on the American side of
things. I just had to gel the "real" story
about the evolution and demise of the Sovi
et / Russian space program, something tra
ditionally shrouded in secrecy and mystery.
Every Wednesday, I would take the
Metro to the exhibition center. VDNKh.
for my lesson with my tutor, Olga Niko

laevna. The museum itself is a symbol of
Soviet grandeur. Above the museum is ;i
metal arch reaching high into the air. A sil
ver rocket sits atop the arch. 1 his architec
tural wonder is visible from anywhere in
VDNKh. It's 50... 50... Soviet.
On one side of its single modest exhibi
tion hall, the museum displays scale models
of the Soviet Union's big "firsts" in space
like Sputnik 1 and Yuri Gagarin's flight
capsule.
On the other side, the first Russian dogs
to return to earth from orbit, Byelka
("Squirrel") and Stryelka ("Little Arrow"),
have been stuffed and eternally bask in the
museum's spotlights (What is il with Rus
sians and eternal preservation?). Although
they were originally mutts taken oil the
street, Byelka and Stryelka were wor
shipped in this country when they returned
to earth. The government even gave their
puppies to important foreign dignitaries.
In another display case, they show some
examples of Russian space food. I hey have
the typical spread — instant coffee, nuts
and cherries in a scary pasty sauce. I Jpon a

sccond look. I saw a toothpaste tube
labeled "Borscht." Yes. I would like to
squeeze my beet soup into my mouth. 1
think I'll stick to I ang. thank you very
much.
A few scant flecks of moon dust are dis
played in another glass ease as il they are
precious metals. I Ins is definitely a far cry
from the chunk of moon rock on display at
the NASA Antes Visitors Center in Moun
tain View.
In my first few weeks in Moscow, being
at the museum helped me realize the dis
tinct differences between our two coun
tries. 1 lie United States has an overabun
dance of goods. We can waste nearly every
thing and without tremendous conse
quences because. " There's always more
where that came from."
In the former Soviet Union, the people
waste very little, especially when it comes
to money Masbe that's part of why Mir is
still in free fall up there. I hey are trying to
hold on to what little they have left from
their great dynasty as a world superpower.
As much fun as I was having in the

museum. 1 still felt like I wasn't getting, the
whole story. Last week. 1 experienced what
I'd been hoping for. When I arrived at the
museum, Olga Nikolaevna took me behind
a big red curtain and down a long, dark
hallway, livery once in a while, she would
stop and silently flip a few random switches
in the hallway. (Now, this is Russian, I
thought.)
After following the hallway's twists and
turns, she eventually stopped and unlocked
a heavy door with her huge master key. It
was the museum's storage room. 1 his \vas
the stuff that the museum didn't put on dis
play. for one reason or another. Collecting
dusi on the shelves and on the floor were
busts of I enin and of cosmonauts, not all of
which were standing upright. Many more
scale models of planetary probes and other
space memorabilia occupied the floor and
shelves.
()n one shelf. I came across a plastic gar
incnt bag that I proceeded to open. My
tutor called it. "a most pri/ed possession of
the museum." Inside was an American
space suit. I looked at the name tag across

the front. li read, "COl I INS." It was
Michael Collins' space suit from Ins Apollo
II mission with Neil Armstrong and Bu//
Aldrin. Olga Nikolaevna let me play with
the suit a little bit. everything, short ot try
ing it on. What a random place to find this.
I thought. Amid pro Soviet memorabilia
lay a trophy of its former arch-rival, a rem
nant of one of its humiliations.
1 o me, this room was much more fasei
nating than the main exhibition hall with all
of its fancy lighting. 1 had stumbled upon a
treasure chest of museum rejects. I was
physically transported to Mikey Walsh's
attic in "('monies."
lo me, this is part of what history is all
about, rinding era/y relics and trying to
make a complete story out of them. My
academic life is not on hold. It's actually
progressing quite nicely, jlist without the
same structure as a typical Stanford lecture
class.
