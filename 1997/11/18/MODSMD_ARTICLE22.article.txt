was the only branch of the hook that fin
ished its work in a timely fashion, I d say we
did a more than adequate job of supplying
Chen with the tools to bring the book in on
time and under budget.
On a more positive note (because all
we've heard so far is the shortcomings of
past books and Chen's slander), I am
thrilled that I he Daily article has seemed to
revive a pulse in the organization.
Since the article ran, the Quad office
and darkroom has seen a flurry of activity.
Nanci Howe changed the code to the
office door, Fonv Lin has brought the
office to a semi-organized state, and the
28-year-old photographer who was the
sole supplier of sports pictures for the '97
Quad has been evicted from working in
the darkroom.
Whether this activity was merely a fran
tic response to the sudden publicity or was a
truly monumental shift in the organization's
recent behavior. I can only speculate.
Even though my plan to help overhaul
the Quad was defeated by the bureaucracy
and conservatism that is the Stanford
machine, I have only the best wishes for the
organization's future and hope that this
recent press will be the turning point in
securing a successful and nourishing year.
Finally. I plea to those concerned readers
who have been following how this story has

unfolded to recognize that the history ol the
Quad has proven that when highly talented
and motivated students come together with
the common goal of producing a book of
outstanding quality, it can be achieved.
If you are concerned about the most
important piece of physical memorabilia
that you may take away from Stanford
do something about it! Express your con
cerns to your class presidents, call the editor
and see how things are going or even go
share your talent with the yearbook. I his
whole episode will have been for nothing il
it doesn't help turn the organization around.
The future of the Quad is in your hands.

because il would serve my needs quite nice
ly. Stanford should quickly move a ring of
police people around Mb and aggressively
enforce a stiict no garlic policy everywhere
I go on campus, particularly in places like
the CoPo, where all that pizza makes mv
Inngs bleed.
I he SWA I team could enforce this pol
icy. following Mb everywhere I go, ripping
meatball sandwiches, garlic bread and pesto
pi/za out ol people's hands as they cruise
by. Students, police, administration, faculty,
and University President (ierhanl Caspei
himself should work together to see that
MY needs are met.
And now let's deal with another issue
that has become tacitly relegated to the
platforms ol freshman ASSI I Senate hope
tills; food service. Cause, like, man, I went
over to the Kow yesterday, and, like. I hail
lunch with my AA in Hob, and il was like,
sweet! Man. lunch on the Kow II rocks!
And then, like, I had to go back to Koblc
and eat dinner. I here was like, nothing
good to eat there. Man. it's gotta be like

the biggest crime on campus, ami, like,
nobody is like, doing anything about it.
That sucks.
I can see it now. 1 ear no more, friendly
diner. Police officers, mercifully being
freed of their regular duties of preserving
justice and preventing crime, are now here
to help YOU! Zuni Stew again? We'll see
what ()flicer (iibson has to say about that.
"That's it, Gerard, this was your last
chance. You and youi little chef jacket are
spending a night in the box. Book 'em,
l)an(). I list degree blandness, five to
seven minimum."
Darron, they're police officers. I hey're
supposed to be law abidcr friendly, not stu
dent friendly.
And you know what, I like the police
here. I like what tlicv do. I like Deputy
Swineford, who look a police report for the
kitchen I manage when she could have been
out there, walking the beat to search loi and
ticket your BMW.
And I like Harold (iibson, who helped
vim house onl when people like you were
parking where they weren't supposed to
and causing gridlock in the paiking lot
And I don't even know K Bryan or any
of the parking enforcers, but now, I like
them |list a little I>il more.
