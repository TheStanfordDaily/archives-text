# Tech program finds success
## Ventures co-op encourages engineers to be entrepreneurs

With unparalleled enthusiasm
among its participants, the School of
I ngineering's Technology Ventures
( o ()p program prepares to greet its
third generation ol students.
Founded in l l )%, TVC is part of
the Stanford lechnology Ventures
Program, which was designed to
stimulate entrepreneurial leader
ship among engineering students.
According to loin livers, con
sulting associate industrial engineer
ing professor and director ol the pro
gram. TVC is a work/study pro
gram that "provides students with
both academic training and hands
on entrepreneurial experience"
through courses and paid summer
internships.
()nc of the program's unique as
pects is its requirement ol having its
fellows chronicle their daily experi
ences within their working environ
mcnts. Keith Rollag, a doctoral stu
dent in industrial engineering and
engineering management, is cur
rently working on a research project
to analy/c students' diary entries.
" I he journaling project helpsstn
dents process tlicit experiences bet
ter. I hinkinuand writingahout theii

day's activities helps them make bet
ter sense of their emotions and work
environment, which can improve the
overall learning experience," Rollag
said.
I FEE Spectrum, a trade maga
zine for engineers, published an arti
cle in its November issue about five
ol the students' experiences with ex
cerpts from their diaries.
A combination of academic in
struction. opportunities for students
to join prominent engineers at the
cutting edge ol technology and a
chance for personal growth earn the
program its position as "one of the
best programs that Stanford has to
offer." said Cynthia Yu. a cotermi
n a I student in electrical engineering
who interned this summer at MMC
Networks, Inc.
For Alison I In. also a coterminal
student in electrical engineering,
who worked at NeoMagic ( orpora
tion as a !'.>% fellow, " TVC was a
big-eve opener. . . In TVC, you
don't just learn about successful en
trepreneurs and what they've done;
you actually meet them, talk to them
and in some cases, work with them.
You are totally immersed in Silicon
Valley entrepreneurial culture."
To Sean Hansen, current TVC

fellow and co-terminal student in
electrical engineering, the benefit of
an internship program that "com
bines theory, practice, and reflec
tion" is "the mentoring relationship
with upper management."
At Lightwave Microsystems,
Hansen "regularly met with the
CEO and vice president of the com
pany to discuss their engineering, fi
nancing. and market strategies."
Byers said he is extremely
pleased with the results of the pro
gram. Long-term plans include
"making the program larger, but at
the same time retaining the intimacy
and special nature of it." Currently
the program has 12 members and
will soon begin its selection process
for the third generation of fellows.
The program's parent, STVP, is in
the process of raising a $5 million en
dowment. of which $1.5 million has
already been raised.
Students interested in the TVC
program are encouraged to attend
information sessions scheduled for
Nov. I 9 at 5:30 p.m. and Nov. 25 at 12
p.m., both in Thornton Km. 102. In
formation on eligibility require
