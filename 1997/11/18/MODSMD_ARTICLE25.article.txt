0) vs. San Diego (0-0) at Maples

In its two exhibition games last
week, the Cardinal totaled 35
turnovers, including some particu
larly disturbing numbers against
Lithuania's Silute team last Mon
day: IS turnovers versus only 16
assists.
The team was able to redeem
itself against Athletes in Action
last Thursday, as nine different
players dished out a total of 27 as
sists. Hut their 17 turnovers are
still alarming.
"I think that just in the first cou
ple of exhibition games, a couple
of mistakes were to be expected,"
said sophomore forward M;irk

Madsen. "It was our first time
playing in front of our home crowd
this year, and I think there was a
little bit of nervousness out there."
The team has to work on "just
learning to play in the game situa
tion as a new group," Madsen said.
"Last year we had [point guard
Brevin Knight J, and Brevindid the
majority of the ballhandling. And
[junior point guard Arthur Lee] is
doing a great job, but we just have
to learn to play a little bit of a dif
ferent type of style."
Some of the problems may sim
ply have to do with rust. Against
Silute. Madsen and junior center
Tim Young shot a dismal b-of-20
from the field. They came back
with 19pointson 56 percent shoot
ing against Athletes in Action.
One dI the brighter spots has
been junior forward Peter Sauer.
who averaged 14 points and 5.5 re
bounds in 22 minutes per game
last week.
The exhibitions also allowed
head coach Mike Montgomery to
test out the depth of his roster.
Freshman center Jason ( ollins
showed his dependability off the
bench, averaging I I points and 5.5
rebounds in IS minutes per game.
