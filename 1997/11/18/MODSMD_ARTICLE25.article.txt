In its two exhibition games last
week, the Cardinal totaled 35
turnovers, including some particu
larly disturbing numbers against
Lithuania's Silute team last Mon
day: IS turnovers versus only 16
assists.
The team was able to redeem
itself against Athletes in Action
last Thursday, as nine different
players dished out a total of 27 as
sists. Hut their 17 turnovers are
still alarming.
"I think that just in the first cou
ple of exhibition games, a couple
of mistakes were to be expected,"
said sophomore forward M;irk

Madsen. "It was our first time
playing in front of our home crowd
this year, and I think there was a
little bit of nervousness out there."
The team has to work on "just
learning to play in the game situa
tion as a new group," Madsen said.
"Last year we had [point guard
Brevin Knight J, and Brevindid the
majority of the ballhandling. And
[junior point guard Arthur Lee] is
doing a great job, but we just have
to learn to play a little bit of a dif
ferent type of style."
Some of the problems may sim
ply have to do with rust. Against
Silute. Madsen and junior center
Tim Young shot a dismal b-of-20
from the field. They came back
with 19pointson 56 percent shoot
ing against Athletes in Action.
One dI the brighter spots has
been junior forward Peter Sauer.
who averaged 14 points and 5.5 re
bounds in 22 minutes per game
last week.
The exhibitions also allowed
head coach Mike Montgomery to
test out the depth of his roster.
Freshman center Jason ( ollins
showed his dependability off the
bench, averaging I I points and 5.5
rebounds in IS minutes per game.

Junior forward Mark Seaton and the 14th
ranked Cardinal tip off the regular season
tonight against San Diego.
Backup point guard Kamba
Tshionyi got nine assists versus
just three turnovers in the 34 min
utes of exhibition play he saw. And
sophomore guard I forward Ryan
Mendez. lit upSilute with 21 points,
nailing five of six from downtown.
The only question Mont
gomery faces is whether his de
fense will hold up against quicker
opponents.
The Cardinal and its new front
line did show off their ability to
crash the boards, outrebounding
its opponents by 35 in the two ex
hibitions. Perhaps more impres
sive is that 38 of its ( >l rebounds
came off the offensive glass.
"When we as post players are
finishing plays and getting three
point plays, our confidence is high
and we're very aggressive," Mad
sen said. "When that's not happen
ing. our play goes downhill."
Last year in San Diego, the
team just escaped an upset. After
falling behind by lf> late in the first
half, the Toreros mounted a sec
ond-hall comeback that fell just
short, as the ( 'ardinal held on for a
72-70 victory behind junior guard
Kris Weems' IS points.
Tonight's game doesn't figure to
be as close. San Diego lost starters
Brian Bruso and Sean Flannery to
graduation and 6-foot- 1 ) forward
Brian Smith to New Mexico.
Kven though Montgomery
won't be spreading out minutes as
generously ;is he did in the presea
son, fans should get used to seeing
a lot of substitutions on the floor.
Montgomery hopes to capitalize
on the team's depth by having
players go hard for short spurts.
The problem is making sure
players aren't too preoccupied
with counting their minutes and
with racking up too many fouls.
