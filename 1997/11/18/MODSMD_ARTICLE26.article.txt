The bad man in question is Scott
( hapman. fifth-year senior and co
captain of the Stanford wrestling
team. "( happy." as lie's known, has
built a reputation as the Pacific 10
( onlerence's resident wild man in a
sport full of them. As an honorable
mention All-American. Chapman
has backed up that reputation with
an enormously successful wrestling
career.
"I began wrestling at age eight."

Chapman said. Asked why he took
to the sport. ( hapman replied,"()h.
I don't know. I guess I was just kind
of overly aggressive."
That aggression served him well
at Rim of the World I ligh School in
Twin Peaks, ( alii., where ( 'hapman
won three consecutive st;ite chain
pionships. Ihe highly recruited
Chapman came to Stanford and
wrestled during his freshman year,
but redshirted his sophomore year
because of stiff competition in his
weight class. ( hapman was then
forced to sit out again in 1995-%
due to a knee injury.
Chapman returned from surgery
last year and en joyed a monster sea
son. notching a 39-10 overall record
with a team-leading 11 I points and
finishing ranked No. 3 in the Pac-1().
In the NCAA tournament. Chap
man pinned his first opponent be
fore losing to the second seed and
eventual champion. Rebounding
quickly, he won three more match
es before losing again on a ques
tionable call by the referee.
"Ultimately, though, I guess
that's just the way it goes," he said.
Chapman's exploits have won
him the respect of teammates and
wrestlers throughout the league.
"Aside from the fact that he's a
bulldog, and an excellent techni
cian. he's got this something extra,"
said freshman Andrew Hunter. "If
you piss him oil. he'll just lind this
strength to beat you, regardless of
what you do. It's like running into a
brick wall."
In its loss to Oregon Nov. 8.
however, the Cardinal found itself
without Chapman, who missed the
meet due to a torn MCI . in his right
elbow.
Chapman blew out the elbow
during the Sunkist Tournament,
one of America's few international
competitions. Face down on a gut
wrencher (with his right elbow
pinned underneath him), C hapman
rolled over and felt the elbow give.

"I lost that match because 1
couldn't stop the gut wrencher,"
Chapman said
After extensive rehabilitation.
Chapman plans to return in time for
a Jan. 5 meet against Lehigh. He'll
face stiff competition from the six
wrestlers ranked above him in the
177-pound weight class, (one of
whom wrestles for Lehigh), but
even with his injury. Chapman re
mains confident.
"I feel like I'm up there with any
of those guys," he said.
He will no doubt pursue his ulti
mate goal of a top ranking with the
same flair that earned him both his
success and reputation.
"I just basically like to have fun."
Chapman said. "People just don't
know really how to have fun, let
their hair down. You know. I usual
ly try to let my hair down a little
bit."
Alter graduation. Chapman
plans to pursue a job in the real
world — or at least a world real
enough to allow him to keep
wrestling after he heals from recon
structive elbow surgery.
"Not part-time, but flexible
hours," he said with a grin.
