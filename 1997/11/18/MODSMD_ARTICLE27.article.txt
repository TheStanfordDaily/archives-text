# Soccer makes NCAAs No. 4 Washington up first for Cardinal
## 
### 
l lie Stanford men's soccer team will make
iis first NCAA tournament appearance in
live years Sunday when it meets Washington
in a first-round matchup in Seattle.
Yesterday's announcement of tourna
ment brackets erased fears that the Cardinal
would he passed over for the second year in a
row. Stanford missed its chance for an auto
matic hid with Sunday's loss to UCLA in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation champi
onship match.
Last year, the Cardinal was hopeful for a
berth in the 32 team tournament after fin
ishing the season 10-4-4. but was left empty
handed. t his year, despite a 13-4-2 record
(3-0-1 MPSF). a season-ending four-game
losing streak made an at large berth less cer
tain.
I lead coach Bobby Clark said the players
are thrilled to be in the tournament after los
ing the MPSF championship on ;i late-game
penalty kick the team considered unfair.
"Last year, il was so close but so far.
1 here's no guarantee," he said, pointing out
that Duke, which finished the season 15-5,
did not receive a bill.
Only four teams from the Far West Re
gion made the tournament this year, as op
posed to six last year. Joining Stanford,
Washington and UCLA is Santa Clara, a
team thai dealt the Cardinal its most severe
loss ol the season, 5-1.
In their first meeting with Washington
this season, the Cardinal beat the Huskies I
-0 in Seattle. Hut even assuming a repeat per
formance. Stanford won't be off the hook: A

win would set up a second-round meeting
against either fifth-seeded UCLA or Santa
Clara.
The N( AA tournament is single-elimina
tion format, with games being played each
weekend until the Final Four, scheduled for
Dec. 12and 14 in Richmond, Va. I his will be
Stanford's fifth appearance in the tourna
ment.

again after playing poorly against Santa ('lara
and San Francisco in the preceding weeks.
The tournament offers the kind of challenge
the team looks forward to.
"I think we deserved it." Clark said. "The
team has put so much into the season."
Hopefully, he said, the recent road losses
will leave Stanford well-prepared lor what
( lark called "not an easy route" to the cham
pionship.
" The four final games, none of which have
been plaved at home, will have gotten
us battle hardened for playing tough
games away from Stanford," he said.
Postseason pressure is of a very dil
ferent sort than regular-season pres

sure. ( lark added.
"livery team that gets to the play
ofl has had a good season." he ex
plained. "The pressure is off you for
making your record.
"Now it's the team that can get in
there and enjoy it and use the experi
encc they've built up over the season.
We've learned a lot ol lessons, espe
cially over the last four games."
