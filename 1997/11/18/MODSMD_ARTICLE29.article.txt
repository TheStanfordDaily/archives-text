cluding a 77-yard punt return. In the process, Walters' eight
catches gave him 80 on the season, surpassing Mrad Muster s sin -

Another homestand. another pair ol conference victories.
Walsh and the third ranked Cardinal volleyball team made
mince meat ol the Wellingtons, sweeping both schools out ol
Maples Pavilion in straight games. I or her part. Walsh averaged
12 kills, live assists. 11 digs (14 against Washington State alone),
and a solid s()2 hitting percentage as Stanford rolled to its 57th
Pac-10 win in its last matches.
