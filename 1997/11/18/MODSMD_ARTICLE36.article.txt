I (linn 's note: When Stanford meets
( alifornia Saturday at Stanford Sta
dium, it will mark the KlOtli Hig
(iame. I o celebrate the history of the
cross-Hay rivalry, The Daily bring*
you the story of the Immortal 21, the
brave voting men who stole the Axe
from ( aland brought it back to its
rightful home, litis story, with its
original body and headline, first ran
prior to the 1V57 liig (lame, a game
in which Stun ford regained the Axe,
14-12.
()f all the symbols of tradition at
Stanford University, the best
known and best loved is the Axe,
the Stanford Axe. The Axe is Stan
ford spirit immortalized in metal.
I he Axe is Big (iame and the Im
mortal Twenty-one.
In April 1930, 21 stalwart Stan
ford men crowned three years of te
dious planning with one of the neat
est robberies prior to the Brinks
Case I he Axe returned to Stanford
after an absence of 31 years. The
whole Peninsula went mad with ex
citement. San Francisco newspa
pers headlined, "AXE RE
11JRNED." Thus the Stanford Im
mortal Twenty-one became heroes
in a non-heroic age.
The theft was executed with au
dacity and dash that would have
done credit to Odysseus and crew.
I Jnder the tutelage of Don Kropp,

the 21 waited and watched for op
portunity. They patrolled the
Berkeley campus for a year, noting
the behavior and customs of the
Californians. When the right time
had come, they knew it, and struck
like lightning.
On Their Shoulders
On the morning of April 3, 1930,
three cars rolled out from the Farm,
headed for Berkeley. In one car, a
rented black Buick roadster, sat the
live key men upon whose shoulders
rested success or failure.
Art Miller carried what ap
peared to be a camera: in reality a
box with an ink bottle lens, loaded
not with film but with a homemade
tear gas bomb. On his lap Warren
(iage lovingly cradled a container
of flash powder. The men in the cars
were dressed in typical California
fashion: dirty blue jeans, open
shirts.
They knew that their presence
would not be detected.
At ("al's Greek Theater, the Axe
Rally was in progress. The Axe,
having been carefully removed
from its bank vault under armed
guard, was carefully guarded by
several large careful Cal men. No
one was taking any chances.
But the 21 knew that success was
to be theirs. So confident were they
that entering Berkeley they had
jeered al policemen, hurling catcalls
and obscene epithets. But their Cal

ifornia disguise led no one to sus
pect anything out of the ordinary.

100 th BIG GAME

■ SATURDAY: Stanford (4-6. 2-5)
vs. California (3-7, I-6) at Stanford
Stadium, 12:30 p.m. TV: ABC (STV
Channel 27). Radio: KZSLJ-FM
(90.1), KSFO (560 AM)

Burning Broom
Arriving, they joined into the en
thusiasm of the rally. Big Harold
Avery, moved by the ceremonies,
waved a burning broom as the
crowd intoned the ('alifornia hymn,
but the plotters were not undone.
Unnoticed the five left the rally.
Parking the roadster in a strategic
position before the First Berkeley
Branch of the American Trust, they
awaited the arrival of the Axe-bear
ing armored car.
Everything went according to
schedule; there was no tenseness,
only anticipation of the deed's suc
cess.
The armored car, bearing driver,
guard. Axe and Cal student Norm
Horner, pulled up before the bank.
I lorner had that day assumed office

as custodian of the Axe. His tenure
was to be short lived.
The Stanford "camera men"
drove hack the crowd. "Smile for
the picture," shouted Warren (Jage,
pointing Ins pseudo-camera at the
unwitting Berkeley boy. Norm
smiled and in a second Howard
Avery wrenched the Axe from his
hand.
Not In Sight
Enraged Californians surged in
to forestall disaster, but POSH! the
flash powder ignited in the faces.
When sight returned, the Axe was
nowhere to be seen.
Hob Loofbourow, taking the
Axe from Avery, tucked it neatly
underneath his shirt and walked ca
sually. disinterestedly back to the
car.
"The Axe is gone! They've
stolen the Axe! Kill Stanford!,"
went up the cries from the crowd
"To the Campanile, let's orga
nize." shouted an enterprising Stan
fordite, and the Berkeleyites began
to disperse in all directions. By this
time the Axe was indeed gone,
speeding at SO miles an hour back to
it rightful home. For its pains the
mob received only Art Miller's
deftly tossed tear gas bomb. But all
the tears in Berkeley that day were
not chemical.
I he Stanford Axe. first stolen by
Cal students on its maiden appear
ance at a baseball game in 1899, re

turned. And unlike Cal's theft.
Stanford won back the Axe without
the nefarious aid of the weaker sex.
Brute Force
When C'al men stole the Axe in
1899 they did it by brute, unthink
able force. At the end of the game —
which Stanford lost — Cal's Paul
Castlethum yanked it out of Carl
Hayden's hands and ran. In a scuf
fle, Stanford's hurdler, Frank
Strout, recovered the Axe and head
ed out. But Jimmy Hopper. Cal's
offseason quarterback, threw a liv
ing tackle and Stanford lost the day.
Students made a final attempt to
recover the Axe at the Oakland
ferry. Police were instructed to
search everyone. But the Axe-bear
ing Cal student spotted a girl he
knew |and| purchased two tickets.
Arm in arm the two strode on
board: the Axe concealed some
where about their persons.
Hack on the Farm
With the Axe back on the Farm,
students agreed that it should re
main here. The Immortal Twenty
one feared that open display of the
Axe might incite riots, but they ex
pressed the hope that it should be
displayed to the student body at
least once a year.
The 21 voted unanimously that
the Axe should not be established
as a trophy for winning the Big
(iame. The Daily's front-page edi

torial pointed out that it was only
common sense that we should re
tain possession of the Axe hence
forth. After all, it's our Axe.
But Cal would not have it. The
executive manager of the UC alum
ni organization vowed that Cal
would get back the Axe if it took a
hundred years. The Axe disap
peared again in 1933 and the uni
versity administrations stepped in
to end the fun.
Big Game Symbol
The Axe, turning up once more,
officially became the symbol of Big
Game victory. The nonaggression
pact between Cal and Stanford was
inaugurated between the respective
student bodies. It was the beginning
of another great tradition.
What sort of men were the 21? In
1955, the 25th anniversary of the re
turn of the Axe, James Trimming
ham. who piloted the legendary
Buick roadster, characterized them
as "average loyal Stanford men,
who would rather play a rousing
game of touch tackle than attend an
extracurricular discussion of a tech
nical subject."
None of the group was a varsity
athlete, but "we were all athletes at
heart." In recognition of his achieve
ment, each of the Immortal Twenty
one was awarded a varsity letter.
California has the Axe today,
but tomorrow may bring a different
storv.
