"It's extraordinary 11 wit someone Ins age
that lias seen the eye ol the hurricane is here at
Stanlord," siiiil l-dward Seaton, editor ol a
Manhattan, kau paper, the Manhattan Mci
iiny. and an expert on I atm America.
Seaton was referring to( hamorro's unique
place in 20th century history. Ills family and
Nicaragua's volatile past are closely intei
twined and yyl, ('hamorro's countenance is
one ol quiet dignity and calm demur.
Mis lathei I'edro ( hamorro, puhlishet ol
the newspapei I a Prcnsa. was assassinated in
I ( J7K. Many felt that his death was due to Ins
outspoken oppttsition to the Somo/as, the po
litical group in power at the time.

lamily. but also for the Nicaraguan people,
who felt that Pedro ( hamorro was their voice.
I lie assassination ol the eldei (hamoiro

the Soint)/as
( hamorro s mother, Violeta ( hainoiio.
was elected president of Nicaragua
in 1990. Chamorro recalled that his
mother was not a professional politi
cian, rather, she became a symbol of
national reconciliation.
The Chamorro family has be
come a national symbol of hope for
Nicaraguans. Like the country, each
member of the large family has his
own political opinion.
"My father educated us under
strong principles of pluralism and to
be respectful of others opinions,"
Chamorro said.
In fact, when Violeta Chamorro
was running for president, Carlos
decided he would not vote for his
mother because at the time, he was
the editor in chief for the Sandinista
political paper, Barricada, which
supported an opposing political
party.
A year after the election, the San
dinista party decided to let the paper
become autonomous.
"We went through a very rich and
fruitful experience of developing a
much more credible, influential
journalism in our country,"
Chamorro said.
But after three years as an inde
pendent paper, the Sandinistas
wanted Barricada to become their

party's mouthpiece once again.
Subsequently, Chamorro and
about 85 percent of his staff were
fired.
"It's not that we lost a newspaper,
it's that the public lost an important
outlet of pluralism and that creates
damage to a nation —to the whole
political culture of the country,"
Chamorro reflected. "You go one
step forward, but then you reverse
two steps backwards."
After his career at Barricada,
Chamorro decided to work on
small-scale independent projects.
Thereafter, he produced and host
ed a weekly television news pro
gram called "Esta Semana," which
aired on every week on Sunday
morning.
Chamorro said people made fun
of him at first because Sunday morn
ings are traditionally reserved for
the children in Nicaragua. Thus, no
adult would watch television during
that time.
After a few months passed, how
ever, his audience steadily began to
grow. Even in this time slot, people
perceived it "as a serious and influ
ential program," explained
Chamorro.
"I would have everybody that
had something important to say...
in that program, no matter if that
person was from the left or from the
right or from the center. I would try
and measure them with the same

yardstick."
"Esta Semana" even included a
humor segment during the program.
Chamorro lit up when he described
a piece he produced during
Nicaragua's electoral campaign.
While there were about 20 candi
dates. the two key players in the
campaign refused to go head-to
head with each other. As a result,
Chamorro and an actor parodied
several debates between the two
contenders.
"The segment was very success
ful and I ended up writing humor
scripts —that's what 1 enjoy most."
Chamorro said.
The two candidates took the seg
ment in good stride, he added.
Chamorro recalled how the presi
dent-elect said the humor that ap
peared on "Esta Semana" kept the
campaign running easily—not too
rough or violent.
For the time being, Chamorro is
focusing his attention 011 his varied
course load at Stanlord. For the tall
quarter he is doing a little hit ol
everything —journalism, political
science, fiction writing and some
business courses.
As he reflects on his fiction writ
ing class, Chamorro said. "It has
been painful at some points, espe
cially when I have been forced to re
flect or describe events that have
been very sad—personal events that
have marked my life."
