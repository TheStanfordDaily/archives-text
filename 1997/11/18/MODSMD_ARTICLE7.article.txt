When former Haitian President
.lean Hertrand Aristide spoke at
Stanford in 1994, the Rev. Herb
Schmidt was moved by Aristide's
commitment to the grassroots move
mcnt for greater democracy and dc
velopment in his country.
Aristide. who in 1990 became the
first democratically elected presi
dent of Haiti, sought a newcoopera
tion between the I faitian people and
American students to improve rela
tions between the two countries.
Soon after, Schmidt, head ol the
Lutheran branch ol Stanford's cam
pus ministry, joined with local reli
gious. academic and community
leaders to form I et Ansanm. which
means "Heads together"' in Haitian
( reole.
The group, which is not religious
Iv affiliated, unites students from
I J( -Berkeley, IJC -Davis, IJ( Santa
Cruz. Santa Clara University and
Stanford, who spend five weeks ol
the summer working with grassroots
members in I laiti.
"I think that any time that stu

dents have the privilege ol working
with oppressed people ... is a real
transforming experience foi them."
said Schmidt, who has facilitated stu
dent involvement in I I Salvador and
on the Israel Palestinian border.
Monisha Hajaj. a senior majoring
in sociology, was one <>l live Stan
lord students hi the lirsi delegation
to travel to I laiti in the summer of
1995.
"It was a really politically tense
time." said liajaj. who is now the stu
dent coordinator for let Ansanm.
I here were [United Nations]
tr<«>ps everywhere, and tanks rolling
down the streets. You still saw bul
lets in the street from the violence
that had happened so recently."
I he stay began with a 10 day in
tensive language immersion pro
gram in Haitian Creole, dining
which time the students met with
leaders ol the grassroots movement.
I hey then spent three weeks living
with Haitian families and working
with different grassroots organiza
tions in both rural and urban I laiti.
Since 1995, students have worked
on projects in photojournalism, re

lore-station ami vaccination. I hey
have researched human rights abus
es and worked in a shelter lor street
children.
Student experiences in I laili have
olten proved more challenging than
expected. Angelica Kampal. a scni<>i
majoring in hiology, worked in ;i
charity hospital lor children She
said that I hough she had seen povcr
l\ while visiting India, her experi
l nee in I laid was different.
You've seen |povcrty| but
y<u've never held it Kampal said.
V» Hi ve never gone and taken a kid
out ol a mother's arms or seen a
mother who wants to get her child
admitted into this charily clinic ...
hut the nun turns the mother away
because the child's not sick enough
to take up a crib in the clinic and the
mother is sitting there crving and
crying."
I he students also laced difficult
questions about the roles they
played in Haiti. Hujaj said that let
Ansanm's emphasis on cooperative
work within the people's movement
is crucial.
" I his program was more in soli

clarity Hajaj said. "It was like
( onic down, learn about oui strug
gle. lit into it. incorporale yoursell
into it and then learn from il in thai
way.' "
Paul Namphy. ' lass ol grew
up par lly in I laiti and has been on all
three delegations. "A lot ol the mis
conceptions that people might have
about Haitian society and culture
are due lo limited access to infoiina
lion. 01 information that's faulty,"
Namphy said.
Namphy said one ol the primary
aims ol lel Ansanm is to maintain
public awareness ol Haiti's condi
lions Ihe group strongly encour
ages students lo commit to at least
one year ol speaking to dilfcrent
groups about their experiences in
I laiti and helping lo organi/c liuul

long-term basis. Bajaj, who is writ
ing her thesis on the human rights vi
olations of Haitian women immi
grants to the Dominican Republic,
returned to Haiti this past summer
to conduct research. She said she in
tends to go into the field of interna
tional development.
Despite the difficulties she en
countered in Haiti, Rampal says
that she would definitely recom
mend the experience to others.

"There were a lot of times when I
wondered... whether it was worth
not having the luxuries I was used
to, what I was trying to prove. By the
end, there was no answer to a lot of
those," Rampal said.
"I may or may not be a better
person," she added, "but I'm defi
nitely a more learned person. I don't
know many things that can teach
you so much about your limitations
and your hopes and your desires."
Applications for the program,
due Dec. 1, are available in the Haas
Center for Public Service, the Black
Community Services Center, El
