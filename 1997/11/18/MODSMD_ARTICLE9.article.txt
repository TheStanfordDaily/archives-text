FOR THE RECORD...
Knight Fellow Tabitha Soren's characterization of Economics 1 as "in
cessant" and "bloody awful" that appeared in Tuesday's Daily was not in
tended to apply to t he whole class, only to the homework.
A Daily article on proposed changes to the Draw incorrectly stated
that the proposal considered the possibility ot the Draw being carried out
in rounds of numbers 1 -S(H) and so on at intervals of 500 students. In fact,
the proposal provides for a new round every 600 students.
