# University cites insurance concerns
## Possibility of Black Muslim speaker debated 
### Marcella Bernhard Kumar Narayanan Contributing writers 
More than 50 students packed in
to the ASSU meeting last night to
confront University President Ger
hard Casper on the issue of contro
versial speaker Khallid-Abdul
Muhammad, a member of the Na
tion of Islam who was invited to
speak on campus on Nov. 7, but

could not when no insurance could
be secured to cover his visit.
Students alleged that the Univer
sity's refusal to cover Muhammad's
visit under its own insurance policy
was academic censorship, but
Casper insisted the decision was
based solely on financial concerns
and University precedent.
"Events of this kind are public
events â€” we do not control them,
and vou do not control them"

Casper said. "Views are not in
volved."
The heated discussion between
Casper and student groups including
the Black Student Union, the Black
Pre-Law Society, the Real News,
Alpha Kappa Epsilon, the Society
for African American Students at
Stanford, The Time is Now, Stu
dents for Environmental Action at
Stanford and MEChA lasted tor
about 45 minutes.
Muhammad, whose appearance
was planned by the student group
The Time is Now. has appeared on
college campuses throughout the
country, often inciting controversy.
Muhammad was fired from his posi
tion as senior aide to Nation of Islam
head Louis Farrakhan in 1993 after
he made anti-Semitic remarks dur
ing an address at a New Jersey col
lege.
What worries both the University
and other insurance providers more,
however, are the incidents of
Muhammad's 1994 visit to UC-
Rivcrside, in which Muhammad and
three others were shot by a former
Nation of Islam member.
Because of what he percieved to
be the high degree of risk involved in
bringing Muhammad to campus. Di
rector of Risk Management Jeffery
Scilbach determined that $5 million
in insurance would be needed for
Muhammad's visit, and that the Uni
versity would not accept this liability.
Instead, Seilbach said that The Time
is Now would have to find an outside
insurance carrier to cover this cost.
Several students, however, felt
the University was adhering to a
double standard hy requiring that

Muhammad be insured by outside
companies while other speakers on
campus, such as H. Ross Perot and
Jesse Jackson have been covered by
the University's insurance policy.
"We must delve into which com
munities are being censored," said
one BSU member who wished to re
main anonymous.
" The issue is racism." comment
ed Cesar Cruz, a poet on campus as
part of Labor Week of Action. Cruz
attended both the ASSU senate
meeting and the meeting before
hand.
Seilbach said that in his time at
Stanford he is not aware of any other
speaker or event except for Muham
mad that has been unable to appear
because of insurance problems.
However, he added that I he I ime is
Now is not the first student group to
have to seek outside insurance for an
event.
Sigma Phi Epsilon was required
to take out a million-dollar policy for
their Dish Dash Marathon last year,
Seilbach said, and the Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority took out a $2 million
policy to cover their Theta Breakers
Marathon race.
Stanford has frequently used the
carriers Cigna, American Interna
tional Group, Firemen's Fund and
Reliance National Insurance Co. to
cover extremely prominent speakers
or risky events.
Supreme Court Justices Sandra
Dav O'Connor and William Rehn

quist's visit to campus this year was
insured for $10 million. The 1994
World Cup soccer game was insured
for $30 million and the Big Auction,
which will be held on Friday, is in
sured for $10 million.
The premiums taken out on huge
policies such as this, which can run
up to $50,000 for a $30 million policy,
must be paid by the group bringing
the speaker or other sponsors.
Students characterized this issue
as one of free speech and acadamic
freedom. "This is an issue of acade
mic censorship," said sophomore
Brian Rikuda, a member of The
Time Is Now.
Seilbach, however, said that
"there is so much litigation in the
state of California ... I'm not trying
to limit anyone's free speech, I'm
protecting the University" from lia
bility costs.
Members of The Time is Now,
however, said in a statement that
based on their consultation with at
torney Leo Bazile, Class of '71, "it
has come to our attention that it is
against standard procedure for the
Office of Risk Management to use
the events that transpired at UC
Riverside as a basis for assesing what
might happen at Stanford-Universi
ty-"
After the shootings in 1994 at
UC-Riverside, the school was hit
with two lawsuits, one from Muham
mad. However, the University was
not found liable in either case.
