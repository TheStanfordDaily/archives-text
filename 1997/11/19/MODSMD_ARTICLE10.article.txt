employee was charged with burgiary
and possession of stolen property
after allegedly stealing money col

Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said.
Police arrested 37-year-old
Harold Gibson Nov. 13 during a po
lice surveillance operation where he
was caught transferring a heavy hag
of coins from an unmarked depart
ment car into his own personal car.
Ciihson, employed for eight years
as a community service officer, spent
the weekend in jail and is currently
out on bail. He has been placed on
administrative leave without pay.
The department employs 20 com

munity service officers who perform
non-svsorn duties such as directing
traffic and parking enforcement.
A second community service offi
cer. who also was allegedly involved
in the theft, has been placed on ad
ministrative leave with pay. pending
developments in the investigation.
Herrington said.
"We are seeking a warrant for his
arrest." he said.
Although it is still unclear how
much money has been stolen. Her
rington estimates '"hundreds, possi
bly thousands of dollars" over sever
al months.
The department has requested an
audit of the income from parking
meters which are handled by Trans
portation Programs.
"I'm very disappointed and dis
turbed that department employees

could do something like this.'' Her
rington said. "We take it very seri
ousl\. and we are dealing with it.
Police uncovered the alleged
scam when an employee in the 655-
651 Serra Street office complex ob
served suspicious activity by (iibson
on several occasions and reported it
to the police. The department set up
surveillance and subsequently ar
rested Gibson.
According to Herrington. a simi
lar case occurred about 15 years ago
in which a department employee
was pilfering money as he was col
lecting it from a parking gate. This
employee was caught and convicted.
"We're looking at methods and
procedures to tighten up things to
ensure this won't happen again."
Herrington said. "But it seems noth
ing is foolproof."
