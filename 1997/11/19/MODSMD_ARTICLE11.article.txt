### 
WASHINGTON (AP)
Strengthening his hand in the
standoff with Iraq, President Clin
ton ordered a fresh buildup of U.S.
firepower in the Persian Gulf yes
terday even as signs emerged of an
accelerated push for a diplomatic
solution.
Clinton told the Air Force to
dispatch six of its F-117 stealth
fighters, six B-52 long-range
bombers and four refueling planes.
Pentagon officials said the decision
was based in part on a heightened
state of alert by Iraq's air defenses.
A IJ-2 surveillance plane flew
over Iraq without incident
despite Iraqi threats â€” and the
Pentagon said at least one more
mission would be flown this week.
The fresh warplanes are to
arrive in the region by the end of

the week, officials said.
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon said the president also
authorized Gen. Anthony Zinni,
commander of I J.S. forces in the
Middle 1 ast. to send up to M) other
warplanes including 115 and 1
16 fighters and B-l bombers if
he deemed it necessary.
The president's national securi
ty adviser, Sandy Berger, said the
addition of U.S. aircraft, pushing
the total to more than 3(H) in the
Gulf region, was a precautionary
step not a signal that Clinton
had concluded ;i military clash was
inevitable.
"This is part of our effort to be
prepared in ;i prudent way lor am
contingencv that ma\ arise in the
region." Berger said at the White
1 louse.

Merger said the buildup was nut
related to a I '-2 surveillance flight
over Iraq yesterday morning. I he
spy plane, operating in support of
I'.N. efforts to monitor Iraq's
weapons program, completed its
mission without incident, he said.
Iraq had threatened to shoot down
the 11-2. but U.S. officials said it
did not try.
Bacon said the U-2 flew for
about one hour just west of Bagh
dad, and he added that at least
one more surveillance mission
would be flown by the end of the
week.
Berger confirmed that the Clin
ton administration was prepared
to consider altering a I'.N. "oil
for-food" program under which
Iraq currentK is allowed to buy $4
billion a vcai in food and medicine

from U.N. supervised Iraqi oil
export revenue. One possibilit\ is
that Iraq would be allowed to buy
more goods.
Berger said Iraq would first
have to comply with a I N.
demand that it permit U.N.
weapons inspectors back, includ
ing the American team members ii
kicked out last week.
In New York on Monday.
Iraq's II.N. ambassador. Ni/ar
Hamdoon. called the proposal a
"no-starter."
Although a senioi administra
lion official traveling with Sccrc
tarx of State Madeleine Albright
in Pakistan had characterized the
"oil-for food" suggestion on Mon
day as a "little carrot" for Iraq.
Berger insisted the administration
was not negotiating
