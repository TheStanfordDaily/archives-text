NEW YORK (AP) — After
scrutinizing more than 1 million
pieces of wreckage, conducting
7.(KH) interviews and spending up to
$20 million, the FBI officially pulled
out of the probe into TWA Might
S(H) yesterday, saying the explosion
was not caused by a criminal act.
Investigators also released a
videotaped simulation of the jet's
last minutes to back up their con
clusion and explain what scores ol
witnesses actually saw when the
plane plunged into the Atlantic
()eean.
"We ran out of things to do,"
Assistant FBI Director James Kail
stroni said at a news conference.
"Following 16 months of
unprecedented investigation... we
must now report that no evidence
has been found which would indi
cate that a criminal act was the
cause."
The Associated Press reported
last Wednesday that the F BI had
told families of the 230 victims that
it would suspend the probe, turning
the investigation over to the Nation
al Transportation Safety Board.

Kennedy Airport for Paris on July
