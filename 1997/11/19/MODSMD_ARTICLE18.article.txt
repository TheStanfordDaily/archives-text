## Editorial Draw improvements

Suggested revisions to
undergraduate Draw
will improve system.

NOBODY LIKES I 111 Draw. This
process of assigning undergraduate
housing consistently stands out as a
particularly unpleasant experience for stu
dents in a university that otherwise prides
itscll in the quality of its residential educa
tion.
We believe that reform of the Draw is
long overdue and support the specific
changes proposed last week by the Task
I orce on Residential Programs and Student
I lousing for I Jndergraduates.
Currently, undergraduates have two
"preferred years," in which their Draw num
bers range between I and 2(KX). and one
"unpreferred year" with Draw numbers
above 2(XX). I he task force correctly noted
that the range of the "preferred" category is
so wide that many students in it still don't get
one ol their top housing choices because
their numbers are too high.
lo address this concern, the task force
suggests offering each undergraduate only
one "preferred year" and two "guaranteed
wars." I his change would lower the number
ceiling in the preferred pool to 1.2(H). making
the most desirable housing options available
to most students for at least one year.
Another legitimate criticism of the Draw
is that students essentially make housing
choices without knowing their lottery num
ber m the Draw. Undergraduates are, thus,
forced to strategically list both lop picks (in
case their number is low) along with safely
unpopular houses (if lliev have bad luck).
I lie task force suggested a possible
approach that would give students consider
abb more useful information about their
realistic residence choices.
Idcalh. Draw groups should receive their
number before compiling their lists of hous
ing choices. Hie Draw would then be con
ducted in stages ol h(K) numbers at a time,
allowing the underuraduates with liiuh num

bers to gage which houses still have spaces
available.
The Draw group with the "preferred"
number 643, for example, would participate
in the second wave of the Draw. After look
ing at the results from numbers I to 6(H), its
members may realize that many Row hous
es and Kimball Hall are lull, while Lantana
still has openings, and file a list of choices
accordingly.
I o be sure, such specific information will
help undergraduates make housing choices
that reflect their preferences under the cir
cumstances more clearly than the current
system allows. The benefits are so apparent
that students probably won't mind a some
what lengthier process of step-by-step hous
ing assignments.
I inallv, the task force accurately identi
fied several instances when the Draw fails to
reflect common student sentiments.
Some Drawmates, for instance, would be
willing to forfeit an attractive housing assign
ment in order to live together. At present,
the Draw often splits up groups when the
students' house of choice cannot fit all the
group's members. By allowing undergradu
ates indicate whether they would rather pre
serve the group's integrity and drop to a
lower house on their list, the task force's pro
posals give a number of students the option
they need.
I lie same is true of its suggestion to
introduce an "any self-operated Row house"
and "any co-op Row house" option. After
all. many undergraduates have an acute
desire to live on the Row without particular
ly strong preferences between individual
houses. I lie task force should be commend
ed for recognizing that such attitudes exist
and for attempting to accommodate them in
the housing process.
No doubt, the report of the task force is
not a panacea. 1 lowcver. its suggestions pro
mote more equity, better information and a
wider array of options for students. In this
sense, the lask force produced a set of firmly
student-oriented proposals.
Considering the anguish many under
graduates feel about the current Draw , this is
a definite step forward.
