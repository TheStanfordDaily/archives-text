## An absence of intellectual discourse The
						Stanford conspiracy theory 
### 
HOW HAS Stan
ford managed to
shut everyone
up so well? In my six
years here, I've seen
more people run naked
through classrooms than
ask or answer intelligent
questions in classrooms.

The few people left with a voice are in
White Plaza selling things I don't want and
/ or reminding me that I'm going to Hell.
Where's the great intellectual discourse
I was promised? So many other schools
have it. Why not Stanford?
Over the years, my initial hypothesis —
chemicals in the water supply — has blos
somed into a conspiracy theory that would
cause Fox Mulder to drool before Scully's
visage much like a male engineer on a Sun
day night.
Draw closer and listen....
Suppose you're a major private universi
ty that wants to keep its student population
docile and silent. Moreover, you have to go
about ensuring this using only standard
educational techniques. Obviously, you
tackle the problem long-term. You start
with a given freshmen class and allow the
changes to filter down.
Fortunately, most frosh (despite being
quite intelligent) are inarticulate, misdi
rected and think very highly of themselves.
So all the university needs to do at first is to
enforce inarticulateness, impose the need
to tow the line and pop each over-inflated

ego.
Suppose the university makes all its
frosh take a course in language skills that is
so badly organized that it actually makes
students' already shaky language skills
worse.
This course has lots and lots of variants,
each of which optimizes its own set of petty
and useless criteria. Hard elements of lan
guage like syntax and logical argument
structure are vastly de-emphasized in favor
of mushy concepts like style and sound.
Suppose the university makes all its frosh
take a course in cultural works that is
designed to enforce thinking by rote.
This course is broken into two compo
nents. The first is a weekly lecture where
students are actively discouraged from par
ticipating. The lecturers are professors who
consider the course utterly secondary to
their work. Thus, it's so offensively bad that
most students try their hardest not to think
about it.
The second is a weekly set of sections
led by people incapable of inspiring inter
esting inquiry. The material discussed con
sists of painful, minute rehashing of the lec
tures. In short, the sections make the pro
fessors' opinions horribly clear.
Tying these components together are
assignments (typically grandiose or trivial)
that are graded using two criteria. The first
is totally random. The second is how well
work applies the opinions of those teaching
the class.
Suppose, finally, that the university

emphasizes to its professors that research
takes precedence over teaching. This causes
teaching to suck, as I've discussed previously.
It also ensures that professors will think
very little about the questions they ask in
their classes, leading to a mix of conde
scendingly easy and impossibly difficult
questions.
Taken together, these results make it
painfully clear to frosh that the people
teaching them don't even vaguely care
about their existence. For people who
value little more than their education, what
blow could be harsher?
The overall result?
A university where the few hard ques
tions asked echo hollowly in rooms of
stunned students — stunned at how stupid
they've become, at how easy it is to mind
lessly repeat what they're told and at how
badly the university is teaching them.
So I must ask — does University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper chain-smoke when
no one's looking? If 1 tape an X to my
office window, will 1 start getting mysteri
ous tips about CIV section leaders who
want to spill the beans? Am I now due a
visit by men in black? Or is all this just a
dumb coincidence?
Who knows? The truth may be out
there, but it'll take a hell of a lot more than
the truth to fix this place.
