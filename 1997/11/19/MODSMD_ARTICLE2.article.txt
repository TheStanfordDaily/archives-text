### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
Thanks to some Stanford and
UC-Berkeley alumni, it no longer
takes talent to play with the 4 L )ers.
act on "Melrose Place" or have a
name in a top-selling book. It just
takes a winning bid.
On Nov. 21. the Big Auction is
putting glamorous items on the auc
tion block to raise money for Stan
ford and UC-Berkeley athletic
scholarships.
"There are three things we're try
ing to do: have fun, raise cama
raderie and now, raise some
money," said Ted Leland, Stan
ford's athletic director.
The fund-raiser is expected to
bring in a whopping $2 million and
promises to be the richest charity
event held by either school.
The 2,2(X) auction tickets — rang
ing from $250 to $ 1 ,CX K) per scat —
are already sold out.
There will be 64 live auction
items, all valued at more than

$S,(KK). There will
also be more

than 4(X) items
up for

bid in a silent auction. Organizers
made more than 4.IXX) contracts to
put the live and silent auction lots to
gether.
Stanford and UC-Berkeley had
never joined forces financially be
fore, but organizers report that they
can already see there is strength in
numbers.
"Together we are able to lever
age and increase our potential for
the project as a whole," said Linda
Meier, co-chair of the auetion.
A 3(X)-member volunteer com
mittee, composed of Stanford and
DC-Berkeley alumni, has worked
hard over the past year to make the
auction both fun and profitable.
"Given the potential the alumni
had with their connections, an aue
tion was a logical choice," said Dan
Coonan, an assistant athletic direc
tor at UC-Berkeley.
Stanford and IJC-Berkeley com
peted in claims to wealth and con
nections. and both sides cashed in
their status commodities to bring
some unusual items to the table.
For example, Kimberlv Belton, a
1980 erad-

uate
and for-

mer Stanford
varsity basket-

ball star. will
take a

w inning
bidder and

guest into
the ABC

broadcast trail
er for a sporting
event. Former
UC-Berkeley
basketball star
Jason kidd is of
fering up spots at
his basketball
camp.

"We have two outstand
ing institutions, and it's wonder
ful to see what they can do to

get her." Meier said.
The rival alumni will be
brought together at the Cow

Palace, an arena which will he
transformed into a football stadi
urn complete with goal posts. A
fully accommodated locker room
will he the site of the silent auction.
Patrons are encouraged to wear
school colors. School hands,

singing groups and cheerleaders
will be in the stands and a blimp
will be roving the arena to take pic
tures of auction-goers.
Organizers hope the lun event
will bring rival-school members
together.
"We can be proud that we did
something together," said
Cameron Bianehi. chair of the c
live auction. "More friends are
made."

This concept of sharing also
extends to the finances. All pro
ceeds will be split evenly between

the two schools,

"It's going to be great fun,
and it sends a great mes
sage to Cal and Stanford

for sharing this equally."
said Leland.
This sharing may verv well

continue in the future. Some arc
already looking forward to more

Stanford /IK' Berkeley events.
"We're having a lot of fun witli
the l(X)th Big (iame, and I am hop
ingwe have more joint functions to
gether in the future." said I .eland.
