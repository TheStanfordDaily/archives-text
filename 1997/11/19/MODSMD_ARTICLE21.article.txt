Unfair politics hurt
Kill Lann Lee
What does the bin ruckus regarding Hill
1 ami Lee's nomination reveal?
lii be sure, it reveals nothing about his
qualifications. In fact, few question Lee's
qualifications to become the next assistant
attorney general for ei\il rights. Clint Bolick
of the Institute ol Justice, who has led the
anti-l.ee charge, readily concedes that Lee
"possesses the professional qualifications to
serve.' Senator Strom I hurmond circulated
;i letter ol support before being pressured by
the Republican leadership to recant. 1..A.
Asst. City Attorney Robert Cramer, who
regularly faced Lee in civil rights cases,
defends I ec's litness for public office and
renounces "unwarranted conclusions" made
by Newt ( iingneh. And. of course, almost
every major cml rights organization in this
country endorses Lee.
What then does this dispute reveal? For
starters, it reveals that opponents ol affirma

live action do not take seriously their own
arguments about "merit and track record" as
the "sole criteria" for candidate selection.
II merit is indeed the only criteria, then
Lee is undoubtedly the superior candidate.
As a student at Yale. Lee graduated with
honors and then went on to Columbia Law
School. Despite myriad high-paving corpo
rate job opportunities. Lee chose to devote
his eareer to civil rights law. Me has been
active in a wide range of civil rights cases,
including health care accessibility, public
transportation equity, federal financial assis
tance cases and school desegregation. Lee's
rejection would only serve to reinforce the
suspicions of so many Americans that "mer
itocracy" in the I 'nited States is a sham.
What else does the opposition to Lee
reveal? It shows that Republican senators
are sorely misinformed about the position
that Lee would occupy. Lee has been nomi
nated for a civil rights enforcement post a
position that in no way intrudes upon the
authority of our elected officials to make law
and sel the boundaries. If Sen. I latch and the

other Republican members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee are opposed to affirma
tive action, it is they who are in the position
tn challenge the current law: Lee would have
no choice but to enforce it. Nevertheless, a
number of Judiciary Committee members
;ire using Lee's nomination, not for its
express purpose — to evaluate Lee's qualifi
cations — but instead, as an opportunity to
attack affirmative action as a whole. And this
diversionary tactic serves them well.
Most observers agree that put to a plenary
vote, the Senate would likely approve Lee's
nomination. Moreover, the Republican lead
ership has clearly violated the American
adage of "not shooting a cowboy in the
back" by waging the full-scale attack on Lee
only after his nomination hearing, leaving
Lee with no opportunity to respond.
The opposition to Lee also illustrates how
nominees of color are subjected to a double
standard. Prior to this debate, the Senate
Judiciary Committee saw fit to fill two other
high-level Justice positions with two white
individuals who. like Lee, were clearly cho

sen to further the goals of the current admin
istration. The Committee gave Joel Klein the
notl to head the Justice Dept.'s Antitrust
Division and likewise, approved Seth P.
Waxman's nomination to become the next
Solicitor General. Sen. Hatch, chair of the
committee, expressed his ideological dis
agreements with both candidates, yet
approved them nonetheless.
What distinguishes Lee from Klein and
Waxman? Surely not his record of service,
which is uncontested. Racism against Asian
Americans takes a unique form; toting Asian
Americans as a "model minority" is a fre
quent tactic of those opposed to affirmative
action. Conservatives point to high econom
ic mobility and SAT scores among certain
Asian Americans groups as "proof' that sys
temic racism no longer exists.
These arguments completely ignore mas
sive — and growing — poverty and under
education among large sector of Asian
Americans, particularly inner-city residents
and recent immigrants. At the same time,
despite all the accolades, when the opportu

nity arises for Lee to become the first Asian
American to hold the position and to
become one of the highest Asian American
government officials ever, suddenly he is
painted as an affirmative action "oppor
tunist whose success is cause for suspicion,
rather than applause. So much for being a
"model" of American success.
What is the message that this sends to
young Asian Americans? ITiat they will be
applauded tor winning a national spelling
bee but attacked for seeking positions of
political leadership? The Asian American
community cannot help but take personally
the opposition to Lee.
Lee. a son of Chinese immigrants, is the
quintessential embodiment of the so-called
American Dream. His father, an American
hero, served in military combat for the U.S.
Army. Despite encountering extensive big
otry from people for whom he risked his life.
Lee s father continued to emphasize the
abundance of opportunities available in this
country.
Lee grew up playing with Jews. Germans
and Puerto Ricans. Lee's children have
prown up with a African American god
mother and attend an Episcopal school
where the majority of students are Korean.
Lee has represented all persons who have
needed his assistance — regardless of their
race. 1 le has fought for the rights of African-
American postal employees, Latino job
applicants and white women in the South.

Lee has fought to preserve and enforce the
same anti-discrimination laws which ensured
that his father could become an American
and which paved the way for an immigrant's
son to receive an education from one of the
nation's most prestigious institutions.
Lee embodies our nation's best hope lor
achieving a society without racial bound
aries. To reject Bill La nil Lee is to reject the

promise of equal opportunity on which the
United Suites h;is continually prided itself.
We call on members ol the Senate Judiciary
("ommittee to cast their votes based on I .ee's
qualifications and to refrain from abusing
their power in the name of political payback.
We cannot afford to give birth to yet anoth
er generation disillusioned with the promise

become one of the highest Asian American
government officials ever, suddenly he is
painted as an affirmative action "oppor
tunist whose success is cause for suspicion,
rather than applause. So much for being a
"model" of American success.
What is the message that this sends to
young Asian Americans? ITiat they will be
applauded tor winning a national spelling
bee but attacked for seeking positions of
political leadership? The Asian American
community cannot help but take personally
the opposition to Lee.
Lee. a son of Chinese immigrants, is the
quintessential embodiment of the so-called
American Dream. His father, an American
hero, served in military combat for the U.S.
Army. Despite encountering extensive big
otry from people for whom he risked his life.
Lee s father continued to emphasize the
abundance of opportunities available in this
country.
Lee grew up playing with Jews. Germans
and Puerto Ricans. Lee's children have
prown up with a African American god
mother and attend an Episcopal school
where the majority of students are Korean.
Lee has represented all persons who have
needed his assistance — regardless of their
race. 1 le has fought for the rights of African-
American postal employees, Latino job
applicants and white women in the South.

Lee has fought to preserve and enforce the
same anti-discrimination laws which ensured
that his father could become an American
and which paved the way for an immigrant's
son to receive an education from one of the
nation's most prestigious institutions.
Lee embodies our nation's best hope lor
achieving a society without racial bound
aries. To reject Bill La nil Lee is to reject the

promise of equal opportunity on which the
United Suites h;is continually prided itself.
We call on members ol the Senate Judiciary
("ommittee to cast their votes based on I .ee's
qualifications and to refrain from abusing
their power in the name of political payback.
We cannot afford to give birth to yet anoth
er generation disillusioned with the promise
of an American Dream. We cannot allord to

lose. We will all lose il the Republicans sue
cectl in killing I ee's nomination. II that hap
pens, neithei we Asian Americans 1101 0111
Iriciuls will soon forget 01 forgive such an
injustice.
