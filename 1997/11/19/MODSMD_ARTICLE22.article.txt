## E-mail and me: moving out of denial 
### 
Marni Left

Last week tragedy struck
Stanford-in-Berlin. This catastrophe
did not make the news — internation
al, local or otherwise — yet this in no way
reduces the significance of this calamity. Last
Thursday, due to some technical problem
well beyond my fuzzy comprehension, we
lost access to the Internet.
E-mail died.
1 didn't make it to the Stanford Center
that day until 3 p.m. On Thursdays, 1 have no
classes, and 1 had gone adventuring in the
city. After my excursion, my master plan
called for a prompt return to the center and
spending a few hours plugged into my disc
man in front of the computer before contin
uing with my day.
Alas when 1 returned to the center that
day around 4 p.m., my fellow Stanford-in-
Berliners informed me that e-mail was down.
At first, I thought that it was some kind of
sick joke.
Though I must admit that perhaps I was
more distressed by the e-mail failure than
anyone else, all of us on the program wan

dered around the villa, seeking something
else to fill the void, looking like we had lost
our best friends. Indeed, in a way. we had, or
at least we had lost the only logical means of
communicating with them, albeit somewhat
temporarily.
The timing of The Big Crash was kind of
ironic. The night before, we were sitting at
dinner, and one of my friends on the pro
gram called my e-mailing habits pathetic.
Another friend substituted the word "obses
sive" for "pathetic."
1 don't handle criticism very well. When
my friends started attacking my e-mailing
habits, I was decidedly annoyed. As I sat
around off-line and lonely, deprived of e
mail for what amounted to no more than 24
hours. 1 began trying to figure out exactly
why I feel compelled to get the center early
enough each morning to check mail before I
head to class and why the last thing I do
before I go home at night is a quick mail
check.
In a lot of ways, I think my attachment to
e-mail stems from the fact that I really like

being around people. It's been pointed out to
me once or twice that I talk a lot. When 1 was
in high school and taking an SA I class, my
friend Alex made up pneumonic devices to
remember words like "loquacious" and "ver
bose" that involved me.
Back in lovely Palo Alto. I normally
spend hours and hours each day talking on
the phone, hanging with friends and commu
nicating in general. Ilete in Berlin. 1 have
fewer opportunities.
When 1 find myself suddenly nostalgic for
a friend from my frosh dorm who I occasion
ally run into at the Bookstore or the post
office, I send e-mail. Since arriving in Berlin,
1 have created an incredibly complex web ol
people with whom I e-mail. My e-mail gen
erally falls into two categories: friends and
family members who I e-mail often enough
to make folders for and people whose mes
sages 1 transfer into the "other" folder.
In large part, my love of communications
accounts for my constant need toe-mail. Yet
I think my attachment to e-mail goes beyond
that: a lot of people who love the sound of

their own voices spend a whole lot less time
on e-mail than I do.
When I'm at Stanford. I work at the
Bridge. I tutor in 1 ast I'alo Alto and I work
for 1 he Daily. Here in Berlin. I don't really
have an\ extra curricula! activities. M\ class
cs arc lew and when I go home at night, as I
have my own room and no one to proerasti
nate with. I tend to get m\ work (.lone with
remarkable speed.
I he Stanford in Berlin center has its own
little computer cluster. I he program can
accommodate almost twice as main students
as are here this quarter, which means thai
computer access is virtualK unrestricted. So
instead of finding a constructive acti\ ii\ into
which I can channel m\ extra lime and enei
gv. 1 e-mail.
As I sal around Thursday afternoon,
completely e-mailless. I felt totally discon
nected. Unable to read the messages that I
was sure were piling up in my inbox. I won
tiered what was going on in the lives ol my
friends. I was panicked by the possibility
that e mail would not be up and working

again soon.
I hat night. I went home sans ;i dails c
mail check. I he next morning, e mail again
was working. I cheeked ins messages to lind
that no one hail noticed ins cyber absence,
except loi my roommate and mother. No
earth shattering revelations were contained
in any ol the messages in ms inhox.
Perhaps the onls thing that came out ol
my 24 hont lorced hiatus Irom e mail is the a
realization on ins part that I am indeed quite
dependent on e mail. I hough I .1111 not reads
to change ms habits 1101 am I looking into
ans 12 step programs. I reali/e that the liist
step 111 dealing ssiih ans kind ol an addiction
is admitting that sou liasc it.
Ms name is Marni I ell. and I am addict
eel to e-mail.

Marni I elf, a junior majoring in history,
maintains that licr tiddiiiion to e mail is nei
ther obsessive nor /uillh in , bill instead re/tre
