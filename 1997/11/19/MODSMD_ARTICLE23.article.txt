## Examining priorities; Leonardo, yaya and Gelernter

THE ADMIRABLE SISTER Wendy
got the Mona Lisa all wrong: obvious
ly, Da Vinci wouldn't have carried
everywhere with him an image of woman as
a stone wall of mystery, impenetrable to him
because of his supposed homosexuality
(unproven); rather she is a muse, quietly
standing for life itself, with a distant memory
of his long-lost mother Cristina. From the
sky-earth hori/on through the snaking path
leading up through nature of her enigmatic
hut very womanly smile, she is.
A subtle cross is centered on her mouth as
hi is. in a sublime sketch for an oil painting, on
the conjoined laps of the Virgin and St.
Anne, her mother, source of a supreme fer
tility: the x of multiplication and mystery
whence we are born. In her we no more than
Da Vinci are "frustrated" but, oh, ecstatical
ly in touch with deep Being. No painting has
ever filled more people with a sense of
divine-earthly beauty and meaning. She
heals.
I still think Wendy is wonderful, even if
she has a strange notion about God's accep
tance of any behavior, e.g. sexual. For most
of us. Catholic or not, sexual license is at least
problematic. That is apparent form the earli
est pages of the Bible when the nakedness of
Adam and Eve becomes shameful in the fall
en state of existence where we all. ever since,
live. Sister Wendy saw only the pristine inno

cence before the Fall. Ahh!
The apparition of David Gelernter drew
me back to Da Vinci, whom he resembles in
important ways: he is a distinguished com
puter scientist along with a painter, musician,
writer. (True, he is not as handsome, nobody
is, especially since the IJnabomber blew oil
part of one hand, etc.)
But, like the unsurpassable Florentine, he
is impatient with his contemporaries, who
generally made his life miserable. A recent
article of his commentary sends his political
ly-correct Yale (and other) colleagues to
'hell." Paul Valery. in an essay on Leonardo
("and the Philosophers,") sees him at the
zero point of a web of universal — like his
mentor Mallarme's "sacred spider" — his
mind could see far in all directions, at times
even simultaneously.
For example, in him. there is a rare fusion
of art and science (broad sense), notably in
the living central miracle of his painting
(drawing on his anatomy of sketches), but
also in his many other endeavors including
the philosophy that Francis I admired. I le
also fused the sacred and the profane, male
and female and so on around the campus.
What keeps Cielernter irate in academia.
no doubt, it is the utter collapse of that cen
ter, announced by T.S. Eliot's dissociation of
sensibility and Yeats' "the center cannot
hold." Where the humanities, includingespe

daily great literature, held synthesizing sway
at the eore of the true university, at Yale (inv
own graduate school) as at .Stanford et al.,

imitative repetitious literary (etc.) theory in
the direction of the scientific wing, isolated
self-expressive spontaneity in the other, the
