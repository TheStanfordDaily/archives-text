Researchers hope to
analyze functions of
newly sequenced genes
Over the years, scientists
have realized that at the simplest
level, genes direct all aspects of

the development and metabolism of the human
body. Research underway by Biochemistry Prof.
Richard Brown and scientists working in his lab is
revealing even more about gene function.
Brown's lab is working on a project to analyze
genes identified in the recently completed yeast
sequence. Through a process of "genetic footprint
ing," by which scientists can determine the specific
contributions of each gene. Brown hopes to analyze
the functions of each of the genes in the yeast
genome in an extremely detailed manner.
In addition. Brown's team is interested 111 the
development of a new method for gene mapping
called "(ienomic Mismatch Scanning." In this pro
cedure. special enzymes are used to detect the dif
ferences between two I)NA sequences. I hough
work has been conducted using this procedure on
non-luiman genes. Brown is working on the adapta
tion of this mapping procedure to the human
genome.
F inally. Brown's group is also working with HIV
on a molecular level. This research aims to discover
certain enzymes that can inhibit integration of viral
RNA into DNA. I he research has important impli
cations in terms of agents that may prove effective
against viruses.

Various methods used
lo analyze plant
canopy characteristics
The study of plants has
intrigued naturalists for centuries.
Biology Prof. David Ackerlv is

contributing to man's growing knowledge of the
plant kingdom by studying plant canopies using spe
cific methods of plant analysis.
Currently, Ackerly is researching both the struc
ture and function of leaf canopies. He is particular
ly concerned with the carbon acquisition of certain
plants and the details of leaf development, and he
would like to develop a model of carbon balance in
plants.
I.eaf'data for this model is gathered by field stud
ies in various communities. Once the model is fully
developed. Ackerly hopes to use it to determine the
effect of different harvesting practices on the pro
duction of leaves. Eventually, when combined with
a population model, the model can be used to eval
uate the suitability of various harvesting practices.
Ackerly's research has important direct implications
for the agricultural industry.
Ackerly is also employing various computer
models to study changes in specific characteristics ol
trees. I liese models can simulate canopy structure,
which allows researchers to evaluate the effective
ness of light interception by the canopy.
Another project that Ackerly is working on
involves the evolution of plant characteristics. One
related study involved the comparison of character
istics of 20 species ol Japanese and North American
maples using DNA sequence analysis. Ihe study
created a molecular family tree for the group of
maples. Ackerly hopes to use the family tree as a
data set to search for correlated evolution lor char
acteristics like canopy structure.
