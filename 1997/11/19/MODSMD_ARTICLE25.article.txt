# Stanford provides haven to numerous species in addition to the salamander
## 
### Erika Check Contributing writer 
Quick — let's play a round of "Name
that Endangered Species." Today's ques
tion: What species lives at Stanford, is a
candidate for federal protection and is the
focus of both controversy and conserva
tion efforts? If you guessed the tiger sala
mander, give yourself 10 points — but
don't think that the tiger salamander is
the only animal resident of Stanford that
is threatened by human activities. In fact,
the tiger salamander is just one of many
species, including bats, cats, frogs and
butterflies, that must coexist with human
beings on Stanford lands.
According to Alan Launcr, a research
associate at Stanford's ('enter for ('onser
vation Biology. Stanford has the potential
to be a haven for manv indigenous

specics that are disappearing in the
Peninsula area. Stanford owns large tracts
of land, and much of this land remains
undeveloped as agricultural or open
space. Because of this. Launer explained.
"Stanford has quite a hit ol the native
diversity left here, which is great il you're
into conservation and natural resources,
and nol so great if you run into problems
with permits and regulations."
As a major developer, the University
often has trouble securing permits for
potentially harmful activities ranging
from building bridges and dorms to hold
ing Big (lame bonfires. While the Bonfire
is the most puhlici/ed case of a 1 Iniversi
tv event that threatens the survival of a
species, namely the tiger salamander,
I .miner cited other cases as examples of

potential conflict between conservation
ists and Stanford developers.
Bats and cats
For example, most students and facul
ty don't know that hundreds of thousands

of Mexican free-tailed hats live in the
eaves of University buildings from the
Ouad to (ireen library. While the bats are
not ;i protected species ;ti Stanford, their
presence does create a conservation
problem because their colonies are vul
nerable to disturbance caused by con
struction during their breeding season.
"It's easy to rip off a roof and kill S(H) to
I.(HK) baby bats," I auner said. "It's not
good lor the bats, and it's public relations
nightmare." He also explained that the
I Jniversity does a good job of adjusting its
construction schedules to avoid the bats'
late spring breeding season, so that build
ing and remodeling projects do minimal
damage to the bat colonies.
Another species that makes its home
on I Jniversity land is a semi-wild version
of an animal that most students know as a
furry domesticated pel. I auner estimated
that a couple hundred feral cats live on
campus, while an additional population
ol 40 cats lives at SI .A(While many wild
cats are captured by animal control units,
an organization called the Stanford Cat
Network believes that il is unfair to euth
anize the cats. I he S('N works to pre
serve the cats by capturing them, spaying
or neutering individuals, vaccinating
them and releasing them.
After the cats are released, the SCN
continues to feed the cats. According to

I.aimer however, the cats can create
problems because even well fed cats can
be "very efficient predators" who prey on
the birds and other animals on campus.
Additionally, the food that SON puts out
for the c;its attracts pesky raccoons,
skunks and possums. 1 he I 'niversitv has
reached an agreement with the SCN to
allow a limited number of cats on campus.
Frogs and fish
In addition to the species th;it live in
the urban campus environment. Stanford
lands are also home to species that prefer
more natural settings. I'wo creeks run
through campus the San I'iancisquito
Creek flows on the North side ol Stan
lord, and the Matadero( 'reek runs on the
South side. I he creeks are "loaded with
native species," according to I auncr. ()ne
of those native species is the red legged
frog, a federally protected species that
used to he so widespread in California
that it was eaten extensively In prospec
tors and miners.
Steelhead trout also li\c in San I ran
cisquito ( reek. Steelhead are a migratory
form ol rainbow trout that spend their
adult life in the ocean and return lo the

creeks on Stanford lands to spawn before
they retui n to the ocean. 1 he creeks raise
important conservation questions
because a large portion of Stanford's
water supply comes from diversions ol
the creek water, and these diversions ere
ate problems for the species living in the
creeks
Stanford has been working with the
('allforma I )epaitnienl ol I ish and (iaine
for several years to try to solve the proh
lems created by water diversion. Stanford

and llie ('l)l(i have implemented solu
lions such as a "fish fi ieiulK " water ilivei
sion and fish ladder, which allows the
I Jniversity to divert water lioni the creek
during pei iods ol high water How aiul also

However, native species such as the
steelhead are also threatened In hiologi

Itcaiitiful hulU'i llit-s
Another resident ol Jaspci Ridge is
the bay checkerspot butterfly, which has
been studied extensively since the 1 K
since Miologv I'i«>t. Paul I hrlich started
researching the species. Ihe bay check
erspol is listed as ;i threatened species
under the I ndangercd Species Ait. and
according to I .auner, biologists found less
than 10 bay checkerspot butterflies at
Jasper Ridge this year.
I.aunei explained that while the but

si/e of its habitats is decreasing while the

very small population, such as the
one at Jasper Ridge, is valuable to
conservationists.
Stanford's response
As a conservation biologist,
Launer said that he believes that
keeping Stanford's natural diversity
should be a priority for two reasons.
I'lie first is that rare species are a
valuable academic resource for
teaching and learning about conser
vation and biological issues. Ihe
second reason is that preserving
diversity is consistent with "a gener
al desire to do the right thing in
terms of conservation ideals."
( hcrall. the University lias been
active in trying to preserve its natu
ral resources. Launer said.
So next time you hear someone
complaining that the tiger salaman
der isn't worth canceling the Big
(lame bonfire, you can remind them
that Stanford believes in sharing its
land and resources not only with the
humans who own it, but also with
the animals who lived here first.
