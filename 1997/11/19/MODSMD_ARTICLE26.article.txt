## Prof. Feigenbaum and his thinking machines 
### Michael Hope 
More than 30 years ago. Computer Sci
ence Prof, Fdward Feigenbaum pioneered
the field ol artificial intelligence, loday, the
technology he helped set in motion lias a vast
spectrum ol applications, ranging from med
ical diagnoses to submarine detection to the
authorization ol credit cards. The notion ol
"thinking" machines no longer exists only in
the realm of science fiction.
As an undergraduate at ( arnegie Mellon.
Feigenbaum was in the right place at the
right time for a career in the then nascent
field of artificial intelligence. In 195 ft he was
a senior engineering student, "bored with
thermodynamics and electric motors.'" who
was fortunate enough to be in a seminar
taught by I lerb Simon.
Simon, now a Nobel laureate, returned
from ( hristmas break that year with the curi
ous news that he and co-worker Allen
Newell had created a "thinking machine."
Feigenbaum, understandably, was baffled by
this strange assertion.

Computers in the early 1950s were far
from what they are today. For millions ol
dollars, 112 eigenbaum explained, you could
buy a gigantic, cumbersome machine with
barely the power ol a standard wristwatch.
I he difference between the computer pro
gram Simon and Newell crafted and the pro
grams that typically ran on these prehistoric
beasts was that theirs could reason, whereas
earlier programs could only calculate.
Reason? Indeed reason, in the sense that
their program was capable <>l such feats as
searching enormous decision trees for the
best possible solution to a problem or trans
forming information, by wav <Â»l a system ol
rules, from an inscrutable lorm into one that
was meaningful for humans.
Feigenbaum remembered slaying up all
night reading the instruction manual for tins
new system as if it were a riveting novel. It
goes without saying that he was hooked.
Because he was so enthralled hy Simon
and Newell's invention, Feigenbaum stayed
on at Carnegie Mellon to earn his Ph.D..

working with Simon to create a computer
model of how humans memorize verbal
material. Ihe model he developed, called
"EPAM" for "Elementary l'erceiver and
Memorize!," was quite successful at simulat
ing human responses to such basic cognitive
tasks as memorizing lists of jargon.
But Feigcnbauni was not satisfied with the
scope of this work. I le was interested in doing
something beyond simple psychological mod
cling. To use his words. Feigcnbauni "wanted
to be Boeing and not just an ornithologist
studying birds."
What Feigcnbauni saw as lacking \\;is dis
ability. on the part of the computer, to lorm
hypotheses to jump to conjectures from a
scattering of data. Instead ol using deduction
to solve problems, lie envisioned computers

interpreting information and actually making
inferences of their own. His aim was to use
computers to solve complex, real-world prob
lems.
Now known as "the father of expert sys
tems." Feigenbaum has succeeded in that
goal by creating systems that can evaluate
data, ranging from chemical spectra to credit
card histories, and reach conclusions that eas
ily parallel those of even the most sophisticat
ed human analyst.
The key to the success of his "expert sys
tems'' is not their advanced reasoning capa
bilities. but their enormous databases of
knowledge. Feigcnbauni. in essence, has
modeled Ins systems on the most intelligent
minds of the field in question.
For example, when a project he was
working on called lor precision analysis of
the chemical spectra of molecules, Feigcn
bauni recruited Chemistn Prof. Carl Djeras
si, inventor ol the birth control pill. Using

Djerassi's expert analysis as a model.
Feigenbaum created an intricate set of rules
that were able to replicate Djerassi's knowl
edge.
Feigenbaum's ingenious systems have not
only found their way into most avenues of sci
entific analysis, but have also catapulted him
to the top of the field of artificial intelligence.
In the words of colleague Raj Reddy, Feigen
baum's work "certainly had the most impact
of any in the '80s."
l o the degree that awards are an indica
tion of success, Reddy s statement has cer
tainly been validated. Not only has Feigen
baum been the recipient of the prestigious
A.M. luring Award and an award estab
lished in his honor by the World Congress on
Expert Systems, but the importance of his
work has also been honored bv the U.S. Air
Force; he was the first computer scientist ever
to be named their ('hief Scientist in IW4. and
he recently received the Decoration for

Exceptional Civilian Service, the highest
award given to civilians by the military.
Feigenbaum called his work with the Air
Force, "the experience of a lifetime." I le was
able to "see anything, go anywhere and have
access to all technology." lo establish con
tacts with scientists in countries soon to join
NATO. Feigenbaum visited Poland, the
Czech Republic and Hungry during his
three-year position. I le also was instrumental
in forming domestic liaisons between scien
tists; chuckling, he recalled the serendipitous
pairing of he and now good friend ("hemistry

ence Foundation, on a research venture to

Feigenbaum is certainly flying high with I he-
Air Force and his "expert systems." which
can transform even the most mediocre ana
lyst into the genius on which they are mod
eled.
