## Prof. Feigenbaum and his thinking machines 
### Michael Hope 
More than 30 years ago. Computer Sci
ence Prof, Fdward Feigenbaum pioneered
the field ol artificial intelligence, loday, the
technology he helped set in motion lias a vast
spectrum ol applications, ranging from med
ical diagnoses to submarine detection to the
authorization ol credit cards. The notion ol
"thinking" machines no longer exists only in
the realm of science fiction.
As an undergraduate at ( arnegie Mellon.
Feigenbaum was in the right place at the
right time for a career in the then nascent
field of artificial intelligence. In 195 ft he was
a senior engineering student, "bored with
thermodynamics and electric motors.'" who
was fortunate enough to be in a seminar
taught by I lerb Simon.
Simon, now a Nobel laureate, returned
from ( hristmas break that year with the curi
ous news that he and co-worker Allen
Newell had created a "thinking machine."
Feigenbaum, understandably, was baffled by
this strange assertion.

Computers in the early 1950s were far
from what they are today. For millions ol
dollars, 112 eigenbaum explained, you could
buy a gigantic, cumbersome machine with
barely the power ol a standard wristwatch.
I he difference between the computer pro
gram Simon and Newell crafted and the pro
grams that typically ran on these prehistoric
beasts was that theirs could reason, whereas
earlier programs could only calculate.
Reason? Indeed reason, in the sense that
their program was capable <>l such feats as
searching enormous decision trees for the
best possible solution to a problem or trans
forming information, by wav <Â»l a system ol
rules, from an inscrutable lorm into one that
was meaningful for humans.
Feigenbaum remembered slaying up all
night reading the instruction manual for tins
new system as if it were a riveting novel. It
goes without saying that he was hooked.
Because he was so enthralled hy Simon
and Newell's invention, Feigenbaum stayed
on at Carnegie Mellon to earn his Ph.D..
