There are several
health factors that you
can analv/e to evaluate
vour risk lor cardiovascular disease
with respect to your age group and
demographical information. /\
quick and easy way is to consider
your lat patterning with a tech

nique physicians and dietitians
refer to as the "waist to hip ratio."
Studies have shown that the loca
tion ol body lat may predict the
risk ol coronary heait disease.
112 irst, take a measurement
around your waist with a tape mea
sure and record the reading. Sec
ond. take a measurement around
your hips (including buttocks) with
a tape measure and record the
reading. I hen. divide the waist
measurement by the hip measure
ment to calculate the waist to hip
ratio, lor men. a waist to hip ratio
greater than 1.0 may put you in the
risk category for coronary heart
disease; for women, a waist to hip
ratio greater than O S may put you
at risk.

I hose people with ratios indi
eating that their hip measurement
is greater than their waist measure
