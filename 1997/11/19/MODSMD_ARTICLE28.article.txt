# Alum markets kosher beer

### Liz Brooks 
Cheers and chug-a-lugs may get
the buzz going for Jeremy Cowan's
recently brewed-up brainchild: He
brew, "the chosen beer."
As a fresh entrepreneur, this 28-
year-old Stanford graduate may
have a recipe for success and a
"shtick" to push his home-made
business, Shmaltz Brewing Compa
ny. out of the barrels and onto the
taps.
In his first pint-sized creation,
Genesis Ale, Cowan showcased a
mouthful — a microbrew souped
up with Hebraic humor on the
label, ranging from a quotation
from the book of Deuteronomy to
the ingredient list touting "no
gefilte fish".
"Don't Pass out, Passover" was
the tag line for a would-be brew
concocted nearly 10 years ago with
Menlo Park high school friend Josh
Weinstock.
"We were thinking that we
needed our own beer to be drink

ing," said Cowan, who graduated
with a bachelor's from Stanford in
1991.
After a string of art-related jobs,
Cowan was jubilant when the first
batch of beer was bottled last
Hanukkah. Surprised by the recep
tive responses, he jumped on the
chance to quit his job at a San Fran
cisco-based technology start-up
and launch his brewing business.
With his love for laughs and a
good ale. Cowan said he wanted to
create a "hilarious, delicious expe
rience" for the Jewish community.
Chuckles aside, his standards for
making sure the batches of brew
are kosher led to numerous consul
tations with rabbis from the Los
Angeles area.
"I wanted to make sure every
one could feel confident they were
getting a product that was up to
kosher standards," Cowan said as
suringly. "It was a commitment to
the community."
Through his efforts to get his
bottled baby approved by kosher
boards. Cowan asked a rabbi to
check out the facilities at the manu
facturer headquarters, Anderson
Brewing Company in Boonesville,
Calif.
Cowan received the stamp of ap
proval, a certified letter from the
Kosher Supervision of America,
saying the beer's ingredients and
brewing process had met the re
quirements. The kosher bottles
were ready to hit the shelves
throughout California.
Since Cowan moved to stock his
"prized product" at Molly Stone's,
Andronico's and several local
stores, customers have piled Gene
sis Ale into their shopping carts. In
addition to retail distribution.

Cowan organizes Bay Area tasting,
including an upcoming pint night at
Jupiter's in Berkeley on Dec. 11.
Cowan has made a mark, spawn
ing Yiddish puns while supple
menting sales nationwide over the
telephone and on the World Wide
Web, particularly during the holi
day season. Cowan has a handful of
other brews in the works, including
Messiah Stout, "the beer you've
been waiting for."
The beer has also led to plenty of
star mingling opportunities, such as
Cowan's backstage appearance a
lew weeks ago on the "Friends" set,
where he handed out beers and
"chotchkies" — pint glasses and T
shirts — to the actors. Among this
illustrious ilk of see-and-be-seen
types, Steven Spielberg, Phish and
Adam Sandler have also been sent
bottles of "the chosen beer."
"Jeremy is a neat guy with a lot
of ideas. Over time we plan to put
more and more of his ideas to
work." said Lauren Allen, brew
master of Anderson Brewing Com
pany.
With his hot pursuit, Cowan
hasn't forgotten Stanford. In fact,
his mother, Mikael Cowen, is assis
tant dean of Graduate Affairs at
the Medical School and is instru
mental in advancing the product
through I lillel as well as a network
of friends on campus.
Working in the catering business
to pay rent. Cowan still manages to
give back to the Jewish community
by donating to fund-raisers, Jewish
community centers, synagogues
and the I raveling Jewish I heater.
His expansion plans include the
Stanford Coffee House and the top
20 Jewish populated cities in the
country.
