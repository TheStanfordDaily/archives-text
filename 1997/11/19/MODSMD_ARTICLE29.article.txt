## Big Game sells out for atmosphere 
### 
The 100 th Big Game may be the best $4 you
spend this year. Forget that the two teams
on the field Saturday have a combined 7-13
record and have lost 12 out of their last 13. This
matchup is about more than football — it's enter
tainment. And the price of a now-unavailable stu
dent ticket promises a better time than a matinee
date at Shoreline or lunch on University Ave.

On Saturday. $9 buys you the chance to see
Stanford Stadium transform into a real-life col
lege football field.
For about half of the Stanford undergraduate
population, the game will be their first taste of the
Stanford-California rivalry at Stanford Stadium.
For anyone who isn't a grad student or a sixth
year senior, it will also be their first taste of a Stan
ford football sellout.
The last time Stanford played before a full
home crowd was in 1991, when Big Game drew a
then-capacity crowd of 86,019. The closest the Car
dinal came to a sellout earlier this year was Oct. 4.
when Stanford-Notre Dame attracted 75,651.
On most other game days, the stadium looks
and sounds hollow. Vacant seats ring the field and
fill the areas behind the end zones, adding to the
already-substantial buffer between fans and foot
ball created by the track. Watch a televised game
from Washington or Nebraska or Michigan, and
compare the atmosphere created by throngs of
ffotball-crazed fans that pack those stadiums with
a'typical afternoon at Stanford! ■ .
The difference isn't enthusiasm, it's participa
tion. I have no doubt that Cardinal football fans
are just as devoted to their team as Husky or
Wolverine boosters. The Bay Area simply offers
one of the greatest sports entertainment varieties
in the country. With two professional (one of
which never comes close to filling the Oakland
Coliseum) and three college teams all playing
within an hour's drive, it becomes nearly impossi
ble for Stanford to ever sell out.
Stanford Stadium finally looked like a real-life
college football field when the Irish came to town,
with large patches of red and gold checkering the
stands, and empty seats a scarce commodity. But,
with momentary exceptions, it still lacked the
electricity, the noise, the fire of big-time college
football.
That will change come Saturday, when Stan
ford Stadium will be very full and very, very loud.
The 100 th Big Game will be my second trip to
a sold-out Stanford Stadium, and I fully expect it
to be just as wild as the first. That trip came in
1994, when I watched a World Cup soccer game
with my brother, our Swedish exchange student
and 85,000 partying Brazilians.
The World Cup game had an atmosphere that
transcended sports. It was a soccer match, a street
fair and a reggae festival rolled together. I re
member my parents parking somewhere near ( al
ifornia Avenue, and the ensuing hike to the stadi
um was a parade through a living rhythm section.
From the time we left the car until well alter the
final whistle ended the match, our ears were filled
with a constant barrage ol cheers and song and
drums. It turned a blowout Brazil win into three ol
the most enjoyable hours in my lite.
Few Brazilians will be on hand Saturday, and
the Stanford Band will do most of the drumming,
but I expect the atmosphere to be just as electric.
Big Game isn't just about football. Like the
World Cup. it's a cultural event. This year, that
will especially be true, as alumni and fans of both
schools will make noise for the sake ol history.
Who cares if both teams are struggling? Who
cares if no bowls are on the line? Regardless ol
whether Saturday's game is a 50-point shelling or
The Play revisited, it will be remembered as a clas
sic.
That's the irony of the 100 th Big Game: The
hype surrounding the game, and not the action on
the field, is what most people are paying to see.
They want to be a part of history, and in doing so
have sold out the stadium. They will create a true
football atmosphere with little regard to football
itself.
Enjoy every minute of it. Who knows it and
when Stanford Stadium will be a true football
field again. And for $9, it's a great deal.

Sophomore sports editor Jim Tankersley has since
learned not to park on California A ve. for sporting
events.
