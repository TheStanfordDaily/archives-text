players often let easy rebounds get away from them.

what we need to do and not let things rattle us." said

the boards. That's something we've got to do."

Lee finished the night with 11
points and had three assists in his
first official start since taking over
lor Brevin Knight at the point. But
his three turnovers have some ques
tioning how comfortable he is at the
position.
"I had too many turnovers. I

started the night with a turnover."
Lee said. "But I feel great, and I
learned from a great guy [Knight]
the past two years. I'm just trying to
get the hall to the big guys."
"It's unfair to put all the things on
[Lee]." Montgomery said. "He's a
great defender, and I know he can
defend anyone. We've got the per
sonnel that can be effective, we've
just got to get the ball in the right
places."
