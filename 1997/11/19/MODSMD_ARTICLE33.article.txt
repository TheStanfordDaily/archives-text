# Middle East peace advocate conducts workshop
## 
### Sarah Ruby 
Shai Schwartz, an advocate for
Israeli / Palestinian peace, shared
his hope yesterday that by working
on a personal level, larger prob
lems of ethnic tension can be
solved.
Schwartz, an actor, playwright
and storyteller, led a workshop at
noon in ()ld Union designed to dis
sect what lies at the root of ethnic
tensions. "I use storytelling and
dramatic techniques in a workshop
fashion in order for people to bet
ter understand the conflicts around
us." said Schwartz.
Schwartz's workshops and per
formances are based upon his life in
the only Jewish Palestinian collec

tive village in Israel. It is called Neve
Shalom / Wahat. and the communal
nature of ethnic relations in the vil
lage inspires Schwartz.
People with a range of back
grounds, including members of the
Palo Alto community, affiliates of
Hillel, graduate and undergraduate
students, and Palestinians and Jews
shared personal experiences and
discussed ethnic conflict.
A main point of Schwartz's
workshop is that while a problem
may seem to be personal in nature
on its surface, closer examination
reveals that it has ethnic roots.
"'I found in cooperative villages,
conflicts seemed to be on a person
al level," said Schwartz. "I realized
that they were actually cultural or

ethnic conflicts colored on top with
personal traits."
The workshop was sponsored
jointly by the Israel Project and
Stanford Hillel. Donna Ben
Moshe, senior program director of
the Israel Project, is largely respon
sible for bringing this workshop
and others like it to campus.
"[The presentation] uses story
telling to shed light on ways to live
in peace." said Ben Moshe. "It dra
matizes and brings hope to the
peace process."
Schwartz delivers two types of
presentations, one of which is the
workshop that took place yester
day. The other is a dramatic perfor
mance called "Weaving." which is
accompanied by Palestinian musi

cian Nazih Mugraby. The story
telling drama combines Arab and
Jewish folk tales with anecdotes of
Schwartz's life. Its goal is to drama
tize the struggle and help to allevi
ate the tension involving Jews and
Palestinians.
Yesterday's workshop attempted
to draw out of its participants their
own personal experiences with cul
tural struggle. Schwartz emphasized
that each faction views itself as a vic
tim of the other. Schwartz used tech
niques to uncover and work through
communication barriers. Ultimate
ly. the hope is that by dealing with
these problems on a small scale, the
looming issues between Palestinians
and Jews can be effectively tackled,
he said.
