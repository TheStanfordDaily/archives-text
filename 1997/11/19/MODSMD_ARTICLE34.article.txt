# Grad students have first mixer of year
## 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
Traditionally graduate students
have had few social opportunities
outside of their departments and res
idences. This Friday, the University
will try to change that with the year's
first graduate student mixer.
The event is being sponsored
jointly by the Graduate Student
Council; graduate student resi
liences; the Dean of Students' Of
fice; the Vice Provost for Student
Affairs; and two Business School or
ganizations, Environmental Man
agement ("Ilib and Students for Re
sponsible Business.
The gathering will feature a jazz
festival with food and drinks. It also
serves to kick oil Big Game week
end for the students.
The Jazz band Sliuht Blue, com

prised of two Stanford graduate stu
dents and two Stanford alumni will
perform at the mixer. Food will be
catered by Senor Taco.
Roy Vella, a joint JD-MBA can
didate, and one of the organizers of
the Mixer said the purpose of the
event is to increase communication
between the different schools on
campus and to help graduate stu
dents socialize.
"Graduate students usually don't
get to interact very much socially
outside of their departments and
sometimes even outside of their re
search group," Vella said.
According to Dean of Students
Marc Wais, increasing the opportu
nities for graduate students to meet
each other is a priority for the ad
ministration. as well.
"The University is making a
much more concerted effort" to help

graduate students socialize, he said.
Friday's event is just "part of the
continuing efforts" on behalf of the
University to enhance social oppor
tunities for graduate students. Wais
added.
Last May. the University held its
first ever graduate student mixer
event, and more than <S()() students
showed up. This year, the (iraduate
Student Council plans to have at
least one mixer event every quarter.
"I think you'll be seeing much
greater resources" committed to this
effort of creating social opportuni
ties for graduate students, said Wais.
Students from every school on
campus have been meeting for three
to four weeks to plan for the event.
Wais said he is "very delighted bv
the level of interest" shown by the
students despite their very busy
schedules.

Other graduate student events
have also been planned for the year,
including a graduate student Sunday
Flicks night held two weeks ago.
More than S(H) graduate students at
tended the Flicks showing of "Con
tact." The Graduate Student Coun
cil hopes to also increase interaction
between undergraduates and gradu
ates on-campus.
"The undergrads and the grads
have a lot to learn from each other,
particularly the undergrads who
have a huge resource of grad stu
dents available to them right here on
campus," Vella said. "We think that
the more interaction we have be
tween the grad students, the better
the campus will be."
The Mixer will take place Friday
from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Willis
Lounge in Rains residences. All stu
dents are welcome.
