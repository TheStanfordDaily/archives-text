### Allison Hays Saurabh Prakash Contributing writers 
University President Gerhard
Casper addressed the ASSU last
night, answering questions from an
unusually large crowd of more than
200 students. Topics included the

shortage of graduate student housing
and Stanford's investments in an al
legedlv racist I'cxaco ( orporation.
Almost a third of the students at
the meeting were graduate students
concerned about the shortage of hous
ing.
Due to a steep rise in the price of
off-campus housing, graduate stu

dents in search of affordable resi
dences have been Hocking to campus
in record numbers. The University
w as unable to accommodate all the re
quests this year.
Doctoral student Doug Natelson,
a C 'onstitutional ( ouneil member, de
nounced the University's neglect of
graduate student housing needs.
(>ne reav>n that our reaction is so
strong is that no one really visualizes
that the grad students are the ones
beinK shoved around." Natelson said.
Casper disagreed with Natelson's
claim, saying. "We are making certain
that currently enrolled graduate stu
dents are given as much priority as
possible."
The I niversity has a Graduate
Housing Commission charged to
evaluate short-term fixes that would
prevent a shortage next year.
"We want to he able to come up
with some plans by no later than mid-
January," Vice Provost for Student
Affairs James Montoya said. "I need
to be concerned, and we need to be
concerned about attracting and en
rolling the best graduate students in
the country."
I he administration is considering
solutions but was not able to offer any
plans. I am wary of creating expecta
tions on which I cannot deliver."
( asper cautioned.
He did however announce that,
starting this year, room and board
rent increases for graduate students
will be held to the rate of inflation to
keep the cost of living down.
One of the particular issues that
provoked a debate was the possibility
of the University's turning Crothers
Memorial, now a graduate student
dormitory, intoan undergraduate res
idence.
Jesse Adams, a doctoral student in
mechanical engineering, offered a
plea to C asper in defense of ( rothers
remaining a graduate dorm. "Please
take ( rothers off your list as part of
your solution," he said. "We realize
that you face other pressures, but we
have come out in full force."
( asper responded to this com
plaint saying, "no final decision has
been made. There was just an initial
discussion of a possibility."
Sophomore Jamal Watkins, a
campus affairs liaison representing

the Black Student I nion. along \Mth
50other BSI members asked C asper
to explain Stanford's investment in
Texaco, a company that in 19% was
found guilt\ of discrimination against
blacks. The Stanford Management
( ompany, which oversees Stanford's
endowments, owns 150.000 shares of
Texaco stock. Watkins said.
Last year, student advocates — in
cluding members of Students for En
vironmental Action at Stanford
brought responsible investing to the
forefront of campus concerns by
protesting Texaco's involvement in

Burma. Texaco eventually divested
from Burma.
"I am concerned about the mes
sage that Stanford sends to everyone
b\ investing in a company guilty of
racism." Watkins said.
Casper said that the University's
investment decisions should not be
subject to what he deemed political
concerns.
"This is the way to destroy a Uni
versity. to use it as a political vehicle."
Casper said. "If we get involved in
every issue we will have 110 invest
ment or endowment at all." he added.
