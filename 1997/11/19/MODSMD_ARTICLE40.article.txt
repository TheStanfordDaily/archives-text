Stanford's 42-2/ win in Herkeley
last year.

IList before kickoff in the 99th
installment ol the Big Game, the
Stanford football team marched
through the crowd on its way to the
field. During the Big Game, the
Stanford football team marched all
over ('alifornia 42-21.
Willi the win, Stanford (6-5,5-3)
earned its second straight bowl ap
pearance under head coach Tyrone
Willingham by clinching third place
in the conference and a berth to the
Sun Bowl, a Dec. 31 game in El
Paso, Texas.
"A lot of the cheers you hear in
the locker room are a reaction to
that." Willingham said after the
game. "Our young men are quite
excited about this opportunity.
Most importantly, though, they are
excited about what thex have done
and what they have accomplished.
Because to be at 2-5 at one point in
the season and coming back is a
tremendous accomplishment."
I )espite its fifth loss in six games.
( al (6-5. 3-5) still earned an invita
tion to play in the Aloha Bowl in
I lawaii.
The ( ardinal offset 375 yards of
total offense by the Golden Bears
by forcing three turnovers, record
ing six s;icks and accumulating

more than 4(K) yards on offense.
The victory marked the fourth
straight for the Cardinal, who com
pleted a sweep in the month of No
vember and a sweep over its Cali
fornia opponents.

After Cal pulled to within 34-21
early in the fourth, Stanford put the
game out of reach with S minutes
left, engineering an 11 -play, 75-
yard touchdown drive, capped off
by a senior running back Mike
Mitchell 3-yard touchdown recep
tion from sophomore quarterback
Chad Hutchinson. It was Mitchell
himself who sustained the drive
with a 24-yard run on third and
eight from the Cal 27.
"I think the real momentum
changer. the real key to the game
was when they went down and
scored, and we came back with a
score," Willingham said. "I thought
that really dictated the outcome of
the ball game because they were
poised and gaining momentum at
that point, and we came back and
answered. That was a sign of a foot
ball team that had its mind made up
about victory."
Stanford jumped out to a 17-0
lead early in the contest. ()n the first
series of the game, a hit by senior
free safely Josh Madsen jarred the
ball from the hands of Cal's fumble
prone freshman running back.

Deltha O'Neal. The recovery by ju
nior cornerback Alistair White
gave the Cardinal the ball on the
Bears' 36-yard line. Stanford failed
to get in the end zone but took a
three-point lead on a 24-yard field
goal by junior Kevin Miller....
It was the same old story for the
slumping Bears. The first-posses
sion fumble by O'Neal was Cal's
16th fumble in the last six games
after losing just five fumbles in its
first five. In total, Cal's three
turnovers translated into 13 Stan
ford points....
On the other side of the ball, the
Stanford offense enjoyed its best
performance of the season. In addi
tion lo tallying more than 200 yards
rushing, Hutchinson completed 16
of his 25 passes for IK4 yards and
three touchdowns. And for the first
time all season, the Cardinal did not
turn the ball over.
"Offensively, we felt like we
were going to score some points,"
Mitchell said. "Every week we have
been getting better. We knew we
were coming together as a group,
and there were very few times
today where guys made mistakes."
Mitchell finished the game with
127 rushing yards on 24 carries, giv
ing him three 100-plus perfor
mances of the season. As a team,
the Cardinal gained a season-high
220 net yards on the ground.
" That really helped," Hutchin
son said. "We knew then that in the
fourth quarter when we were up
that we could run the ball and run
some time off the clock."
So at just 2-5 through seven
games, the Cardinal could only
qualify for a bowl by running the
table and winning its last four

games in the conference. The Car
dinal did just that in beating
UCLA, USC, Washington State
and Cal in successive weeks.
"It's very difficult to put in
words what these last few weeks
have been like," Willingham said.
"It's been a tremendous effort by a
group of young men and coaches in
one of those against-all-odds situa
tions. It's just exciting, and one of
my most cherished moments."

Mitchell also commented on the
turnaround.
"I think we are definitely proud
of where we came from,"he said.
"Being 2-5, not many people
thought we could do it. We knew
deep down inside that we had the
players to do it. To win four in a row
against some better teams is great
for us, great for the program."
With four straight wins in this
month, Stanford extended their

record in November to K-l under
Willingham and won Iheir second
straight Big Game. The Cardinal
has now won six of its last eight
clashes with the Golden Bears.
While the Cardinal will ride a
wave of momentum into the Sun
Bowl, Cal heads to Hawaii for its
Christmas Day bowl game having
lost five of their last six games.
Stanford now holds a 49-39-11
lead in the overall series against Cal.
