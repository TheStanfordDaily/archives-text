### Theresa Vargas Contributing writer 
I he battle between Menlo Park
and both I'alo Alto and Stanford
over the expansion ol Sand Mill
Road lias moved into the judicial
ring. In a lawsuit, the city of Menlo
Park is now attempting to overturn
the expansion plan based on what it
says is an "inadequate" environ
mental impact report.
I he repot t relates to Measure (),
which was approved by the Palo
Alto ( ity Council and then passed
by Palo Alto voters this month. It al
lows for the widening ol Sand Mill
Road, the expansion ol the shopping
center and the c< >nsti action ol lacul
ty and stall housing on < )hlone field.
"[The report) is like somebody
throwing their garbage ovei the
fence into someone else's yard,"
Menlo Park Mayor Steve Schmidt
said, referring to his belie! that area
traffic will increase .
I lowever, I any Morion. Stan
ford's directoi ol government anil
community affairs, said the eight
volume environmental impact re
port "is the most extensive and thor
ough environmental report ever
prepared in Palo Alto, adding the
recent >5 percent voter approval of

Measure () adds to the validity.
"It is no longer a debate," I lot ion
said. "Il has been approved In the
voters. I lie election is over we
won."
Measure <) went through five
years ol review and the report
makes up most of the $N million
Stanford paid for the total approval
process.
"We spent so much time and
looked al il from so many different
angles" that the findings in there
port should be justified, said Palo
Alio Mayor loe I luber.
"We had 20 to 21 sessions at city
council alone on Sand I lill," he said.
It addressed everything and pro
vided solutions lot somethings. You
are not required to create a project
thai has no impact whatsoever."
I le added thai the worst outcome
of tile trial would be "for some judge
to look al the |report | and throw the
whole Ihingout."
According to Menlo Park city at
lorney William Mc( lure, the law
suit was filed in Santa ( lata ( ounty
on Aug. 14 within the required 30
days ol lhe certification ol the report
and will be heard in court middle

make a decision within l ) 0 days.
