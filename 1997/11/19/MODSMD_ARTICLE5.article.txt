# Sand Hill debate enters the courts
## Menlo Park calls EIR "inadequate" 
### Theresa Vargas Contributing writer 
I he battle between Menlo Park
and both I'alo Alto and Stanford
over the expansion ol Sand Mill
Road lias moved into the judicial
ring. In a lawsuit, the city of Menlo
Park is now attempting to overturn
the expansion plan based on what it
says is an "inadequate" environ
mental impact report.
I he repot t relates to Measure (),
which was approved by the Palo
Alto ( ity Council and then passed
by Palo Alto voters this month. It al
lows for the widening ol Sand Mill
Road, the expansion ol the shopping
center and the c< >nsti action ol lacul
ty and stall housing on < )hlone field.
"[The report) is like somebody
throwing their garbage ovei the
fence into someone else's yard,"
Menlo Park Mayor Steve Schmidt
said, referring to his belie! that area
traffic will increase .
I lowever, I any Morion. Stan
ford's directoi ol government anil
community affairs, said the eight
volume environmental impact re
port "is the most extensive and thor
ough environmental report ever
prepared in Palo Alto, adding the
recent >5 percent voter approval of

Measure () adds to the validity.
"It is no longer a debate," I lot ion
said. "Il has been approved In the
voters. I lie election is over we
won."
Measure <) went through five
years ol review and the report
makes up most of the $N million
Stanford paid for the total approval
process.
"We spent so much time and
looked al il from so many different
angles" that the findings in there
port should be justified, said Palo
Alio Mayor loe I luber.
"We had 20 to 21 sessions at city
council alone on Sand I lill," he said.
It addressed everything and pro
vided solutions lot somethings. You
are not required to create a project
thai has no impact whatsoever."
I le added thai the worst outcome
of tile trial would be "for some judge
to look al the |report | and throw the
whole Ihingout."
According to Menlo Park city at
lorney William Mc( lure, the law
suit was filed in Santa ( lata ( ounty
on Aug. 14 within the required 30
days ol lhe certification ol the report
and will be heard in court middle
to late spring I he judge should then
make a decision within l ) 0 days.
While Hliber admits to not know
ing the "standard," he said that he
doesn't suspeet the ease will linger
around very long.
"It isn't the type of litigation that
hangs on for months, because it has
some consequences," he said.
Menlo Park argues that a major
injustice of the project is that that
city did not have a say in accepting or
rejecting these consequences.
" This w;is a regional issue, but
only one community | Palo Alto J was
allowed to vote on it," said Peter
Drekmeier. founder of Mid-Penin
sula Action for lomorrow, adding
that the alternative arguments pro
vided by Measure M. which his
group supported, were defeated be
cause' of polities.
"They were trying to take set
blueprints and fit them into an area.
| It was) like a child trying to fit
square blocks through circular
holes." he said.
Schmidt argues that the structure
of the project approval process was
designed to exclude Menlo Park res
idents.
"Stanford made sure we weren't
going to have a voice in it other than
to show up to city council meetings
and complain," he said. "We have
been systematically excluded from
the process."
However, even if Menlo Park
does win its lawsuit, they will still not
get a vote. I hose parts of the report
deemed inadequate by the court
would be rest udied and redrafted
and then presented to Palo Alto vot
ers again.
11 Ã¼ber saicl that because "the en
tire project is in the city of Palo
Alto" it was only necessary that Palo
Alto residents vote.
I lowever. he agrees that the Sand
I lill project would have an impact on
Menlo Park roads.
Schmidt argues that the traffic
implications of the Sand I lill project

affect land in Menlo Park far more
than land in Palo Alto. He estimates
that at the intersection of Sand Hill
and Santa Cruz Avenue, the 2S,(KK)
car trips there daily will rise to
M.(KK).
"The traffic that everyone hates
doesn't go to Palo Alto, it goes to
Menlo Park," Schmidt said.
Agreeing, Drekmeier added that
the increased traffic, "will work |its|
way through the residential areas of
Menlo Park."
Huber, on the other hand, said
that the project aims at having a
magnet effect, pulling people to
wards the expanded Sand Hill Road
and away from residential streets in
Menlo Park.
Under the currently approved
Measure O. Menlo Park is not left
completely powerless. It has the
ability to grant or deny permission
for road construction in their juris
diction. a power Schmidt said they
plan to use with respect to the small
area of Menlo Park land around the
interstection of Sand Hill and Santa
Cru/. which borders on the land af
fected by Measure ().
"We can't force them to do any
thing with that [part of the road],"
Huber said, adding that Stanford
will pay for any improvements
Menlo Park agrees to.
While the report's traffic data re
mains one of the most questionable
aspects, according to McC'lure, the
lawsuit deals with "a number of in
adequacies."
Huber said that the main prob
lem with studying the environment
is that one is forced to guess. "You
are forced today to look ahead 15
years and you make a decision
today. II it doesn't work |down the
line] then you can't do anything
about it."he said.
I lorton said that the earliest con
struction could begin some time next
year and hopes it will only take 32
months from start to finish.
"Whatever obstacles come up
will not stop the project. . .there are
remedies." he said.
