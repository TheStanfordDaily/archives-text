Global Warming Update
During the first ten days of December, international negotiators
from more than 100 countries will meet in Kyoto, japan, to set
legally-binding limits on global warming pollution. Thousands of
scientists tell us we must reduce pollution substantially to protect
the planet and put us on a path to a sustainable future. But big
coal, oil and auto companies are spending millions to mislead the
public and intimidate politicians. This pressure has had its effect.
President Clinton has announced an inadequate U.S. position that
could actually allow industrialized country pollution output to
increase.
NRDC and our 350,000 members call on the President to stand up
to big polluters and commit to the real reductions needed to save
our future.
