Looking for something FUN
'to do that doesn't revolve
around food or booze? Burnt out
on the geek life? Okay, if you
must, think of it this way: hirez
color mapping on a 3D surface
with intuitive user interface and
multiple levels of undo. If you
didn't already know, the basic
idea is this: we have lots of
interesting unfinished pottery.
Come in, pick a piece, choose
some colors, and have a blast. You
design it, you paint it, we fire it.
We supply every thing you need. We
are here to guide you and to insure
a professional results every time.

plates, capuccino mugs, bud
vases, and of course, Christmas
ornaments.
Come to Petroglyph.
It's fun.
It's not digital.
And we promise, you can do it.
