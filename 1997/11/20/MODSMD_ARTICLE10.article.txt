Heroin addiction is a medical piob
leirr that can be cured il doctors are
freed from heavy-handed restric
tions on the use of methadone, a
federal scientific panel concluded
yesterday.
The report by a committee at
the National Institutes of Health
supports an earlier White House
call for more physician control ol
dosing and distribution of
methadone, a synthetic narcotic
used to wean addicts from heroin.
Committee chairman Dr. Lewis
L. Judd of the University of Cali
fornia. San Diego, said physicians
are reluctant to treat heroin addic
tion because of mountains *>l
paperwork and "onerous" regula

tions imposed on tlu* use of
methadone by federal agencies ami
state governments.
"We know of no other area of
medicine where the federal govern
ment intrudes so deeply ami eoei
eively into the practice of
medicine," .ludd said. "II extra lev
els of regulation were eliminated,
many more physicians and pharma
cies could prescribe ami dispense
methadone" and make the ticat
ment more readily available.
Methadone is a pill thai lias
some of the same physiological
effects on the brain as heroin,
which helps blunt the effects ol
heroin witluhawal. Methadone
does not pioducc a "high' that
most addicts crave, and it takes sc\

eral hours I'm its biological effects
to occur. lor these reasons, ludd
said, methadone is not considered a
diug that is attractive to abusers
ami should be available for pre
sci iption.
"l aws to control methadone
divetsion are no longer necessaiy."
.ludd said I lie laws were passed, he
said, to limit distribution ol
methadone because of apptchen
sion it could be sold on the black
matkcl to heroin addicts.
