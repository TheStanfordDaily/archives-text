## Editorial Undergraduates in CroMem? Solving the crunch 
### 
Preserve a variety of
housing options for
grads and undergrads

Despite our iendency to
complain about our dorms and the
stress associated with the Draw
every spring, Stanford undergraduates have
a privilege that students at many other uni
versities don't enjoy: four years of guaran
teed on-campus housing.
Hut whether or not such a guarantee is
truly a blessing has recently come into ques
tion. Phis year, the I Jniversity had to stretch
its resources to the limit in order to accom
modate students who wanted to live on cam
pus. A larger incoming freshman class result
ed in cramming more students into under
graduate residences, and rising rents in the
local area precipitated an increased demand
for on-campus graduate housing.
In the case of undergraduates, various
non-residential spaces were converted into
student residences, and a number of students
weren't assigned housing until after the
quarter commenced. Housing space was also
unavailable for many graduate students.
One proposal that emerged last week to
solve the housing shortage was to convert
Crothers Memorial Hall into an undergrad
uate residence. Most of the rooms in
CroMem — which has been home to 120
masters and doctoral students for over 30
years — would be re-furbished to create
one-room doubles for undergraduates,
thereby enabling the dormitory to house
twice the number of students it currently
accommodates.
(iraduate students would be moved into
residences such as the Mirrielees apartments
and the Suites in Governor's Corner, where
undergraduates currently live.
While such a conversion would indeed
increase the number of undergraduates
accommodated by University housing, it
solves little more than the numbers crunch

and eliminates some of the opportunities
currently available to both graduates and
undergraduates in campus housing.
Converting CroMem into undergraduate
housing would destroy a valuable communi
ty that many graduate students feel is
unavailable in apartment-style housing
options. A community of isolated apart
ments is not as cohesive as a community liv
ing in a dorm setting. The community life at
CroMem demonstrates that single rooms off
a long corridor facilitate interaction with
one's neighbors.
Furthermore, moving graduate students
into apartments or suite-style housing units
where undergraduates currently live would
reduce the number of alternatives under
graduates have to dorm-style housing. Mir
rielees and the Suites may not rank highest
in the Draw, but for those undergraduates
who want to cook for themselves or live with
a group of friends in a larger shared space,
these are among the few available options.
Not only would converting CroMem to
an undergraduate dorm strip graduates of
one of the few residences that fosters a close
graduate community and further limit the
housing options of undergraduates, it would
also increase concerns about the availability
of graduate housing in general.
Many graduate students perceive that the
University has promised to increase the
amount of graduate housing. However, they
also realize that closing one housing complex
and opening another instead does not lead to
a significant aggregate gain. Graduate stu
dents simply want new complexes.
Until the University can take further
actions to resolve the housing crunch in ways
that meet the needs of both undergraduate
and graduate students, we realize that we
will all need to sacrifice a bit of comfort and
choice. Perhaps having our options limited is
the price we must pay for guaranteeing hous
ing to all undergraduates. We hope that
there are more effective ways to accommo
date students' needs, however, without tak
ing away some of the residential options they
value most.
