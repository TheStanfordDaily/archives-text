## Finding a place: Generation Ph.X. 
### 
WE'VE ALL
been inundat
ed with talk
of "Generation X," and
the so-called portrayals
of this so-called group,
which ranges from
"Reality Bites" to the

cover of Newsweek,
from Douglas Copeland books to Budweis
er beer commercials.
Although I, like most, reject the Gen-X
label as a crass marketing scheme, I still feel
there is a nugget of truth hidden in there
somewhere. People born between the mid
'6os and the early 'XOs have inherited a
world of disarray and do share — even if
only at some superficial level — a common
culture. Gen-X-ers are portrayed as
detached, dazed and confused; they were
raised on mass media and are living in a
consumer culture. They are for the most
part open-minded with short attention
spans, hoping to do some good in the
messed up world the boomers left behind.
Most of my friends fit the general Gen-X
description but with one slight difference:
they either have (or will soon have) Ph.D.s.
We're slackers with advanced degrees.
We're Generation Ph.X.
Gen-Ph.X.-ers are a complicated mix
ture of the popular culture of our era and
the high culture of the ivory tower. We're
walking contradictions.
We're partial to the cartoons of both
"Rocky and Bullwinkle" and The New
Yorker — although only now do we really
get the subtle humor (of the former that is:
z gets the subtle humor of The New York
er). We've programmed our car stereos for
both NPR and hip-hop / modern rock sta

tions (and are therefore equally conversant
on "Fresh Air" and "Lilith Fair,'' on
"Rhythm Nation" and "Talk of the
Nation"). We watch both MTV and CNN,
"Melrose Place" and "Nova." We've mem
orized lines from"The Breakfast Club:"
we've joined the Sierra Club. We've read
Calvin, and we've read Hobbes: we've read
"Calvin and Hobbes." We're children of
Watergate who are working for Bill Gates.
Like other Gen-X-ers, we've come ol
age amid fears of AIDS, the recession,
nuclear annihilation and the hole in the
ozone. We too are filled with angst. Gen-
Ph.X.-ers, however, did not settle into the
nearest coffee house to bemoan our plight;
we settled into the nearest graduate school
to bemoan our plight (heading to The Cof
fee House is just an added bonus).
Being a young academic at this point in
time also brings new challenges and dilem
mas. In our relationships with our thesis
committees, Gen-Ph.X.-ers are reliving the
psychological damage of divorced parents
who neglected their children while
indulging themselves. We criticize the
oppression of the class system while partic
ipating in an educational enterprise that
sorts us into the top tier of that system.
Like our Gen-X brethren, most of us not
only realize that we won't be as financially
well-off as our parents, but that we also
won't be as scholarly well-off as our advi
sors. Long gone are the days of academic
growth when faculty jobs were plentiful and
where research funding was abundant. Gen-
Ph.X.-ers are left picking up the academic
crumbs left by the academic boomers.
Gen-Ph.X.-ers face a market of academ
ic McJobs; although we've been trained at
elite research universities, our only job

offers come from regional state colleges.
We're conflicted because we are unwilling
to go anywhere for a job. but the middle of
nowhere seems to be the only option. We
desperately want to have an impact and do
meaningful research and teaching, but we
realize tenure review committees often
don't share this perspective. We want to do
serious research, but we don't take our
selves too seriously.
Like Gen-X-ers, we're numb, detached,
wry and alienated. However, we can also
write a 30-page refereed journal article on
the social construction of a postmodern
world that results in the psycho-social man
ifestations of feeling numb, detached, wry
and alienated. We fetishize 70s television
but could also teach an undergraduate cul
tural studies seminar on it.
So, is it any wonder that grad students
are so conflicted and are taking longer to
finish their degrees? We're caught in what
we know is our last holding pattern, unwill
ing to venture out from the safety of this
secure haven. We're trying to make sense of
this disillusioned world, still hoping our
degrees will allow us to do some good and
not just escort us into the dominant, middle
class culture. We don't quite fit in with the
other Gen-X-ers in our world, we don't
quite fit in with the other academics in our
universities. We know we're actively creat
ing the drama of our lives, but we secretly
hope John Hughes will write the ending.

Dear Mr. Vernon: We think you're crazy
for asking education graduate student Marc
Chun to write a column on who he thinks
we are. We 're a scholar, a slacker, a doctor
al student, a rebel and a basket case. Sin
cerely yours, the Generation I'h.X.-ers.
