Mac is high quality
The article on the decline of the Macin
tosh at Stanford ("End of an Era." by T.J.
Babbitt, Stanford Daily. 11/ l()/ l ) 7) was
indicative of another sad decline as well
that of well-researched, responsible jour
nalism.
The article establishes that Wintel
machines are making in-roads into tradi
tionally all-Mac areas on campus, and from
that, the article ultimately suggests that
Macs will go the way of the Commodore 64.
To buttress this weak conclusion, the
reporter introduces the patently false
notion that "Windows has taken over tradi
tional Apple niche-market strongholds,
such as education, desktop publishing and
multimedia applications." Taken over?
Hardly. Reliable information to the con
trary. from a number of sources, is readily
accessible.
Macs still remain the machine of choice
in the publishing, educational and multi
media markets, in percentages that are all

the more remarkable given the overall mar
ket share of Macintoshes.
Most galling, perhaps, was the decision
to use a quote from a student declaring that
buying a Mac now "would be kind of like
buying a Commodore 64." Puh-leeze!
Micro-lemmings indoctrinated by a steady
stream of negative media reports (to which
this article is one more contribution) can be
quoted all day, but how much more inter
esting and informative it would have been
to quote someone with a broader perspec
tive.
Rather than point out the absurdity of
the quoted comment, the reporter tacitly
acknowledges it with the dramatically omi
nous — not to mention spectacularly irrele
vant — comment that competition from
Apple snuffed out the Commodore 64.
Is it too much to ask to have a reporter
lend a little context to the issue? If Apple
killed the Commodore 64, it's because
Apple took the home computer to another
level. How does that compare to the current
standing of the Macintosh in the market
place?

The technology employed in the Macin
tosh remains superior to that of Wintel
machines, and top-line Macs outperform
anything Microsoft and Intel currently have
on the desktop. Commodore 64? I think
not.
The way the industry is developing —
particularly with respect to the rapidly
evolving on-line environment — Apple will
carry on, at the very least, past the point
when these platform differences are no
longer meaningful.
Apple is a $10 billion company with an
installed base of upwards of 57 million
machines. They are as well positioned as
anyone, and better positioned than most, to
remain a significant player in the realm of
the Internet for many years to come.
For the Commodore f>4 to have sur
vived. its builders would have had to
remake it into a better computer. Apple
established itself by making a better com
puter. Apple will continue to survive
because it still makes a better computer.
