# Foreign Bureau: Hong Kong
## Therese Lee Small steps mask fundamental issue 
### 
HUMAN RIGHTS HAS seemingly
undergone a face lilt in China over
the past few weeks. Days before
the Sino-US summit last month. IJ.N.
human rights workers were allowed to enter
Chinese prisons and interview prisoners
including political dissidents — for the first
time.
Newspapers confirmed Tuesday that a
former part-time employee at the Washing
ton Post's Beijing Bureau was released Oct.
20. IS months before the end of her six-year
jail sentence.
And Wei Jingsheng. China's most
famous pro-democracy activist, was released
on Sunday after nearly IS years prison. Peo
ple worldwide are relieved that he can now
rest and receive proper medical care.
But it is too early to celebrate the appar
ent political liberalization of China. Count
less political prisoners remain locked away
as leaders of democratic countries claim vic
tory in the struggle for human rights and as
the public pats itself on the back for the suc
cess of its mainland-C'hina bashing.
A Chinese professor has just been
detained for writing letters to President
Jiang Zemin calling for the release of politi
cal prisoners and a reversal of the verdict on

the Tiananmen Massacre. Democracy in
1 long Kong continues it) be eroded with
questionable election reforms and represen
tation in the National People's Congress.
II Beijing were truly prepared for a freer
society and"The Fifth Modernization," it
would have allowed Wei to remain free in
his homeland. Indeed, among the things
being cited in Hong Kong as motives for his
release are a possible secret deal with the
I Jnited States and a public relations move to
enhance China's bid for the 2(X)4 Olympics.
" There is nothing for the world to cele
brate," said Democratic Party Chairman
Martin Lee. "If I were to be thrown out of
Hong Kong. I wouldn't want people to cel
ebrate for me."
Given the choice, Wei would not have
wanted to leave prison on the condition of
exile. On his first release in 1993 (as China
bid for the 2(KM) Olympics), he had the
opportunity to leave his country, but he
chose to stay. Six months later, he was
thrown back in prison after having met with
John Shattuck. who was the U.S. Undersec
retary of State for humanitarian affairs at
that time.
Beijing can only win from its release of
Wei. First, it looks great to the international

community. Secondly, the Chinese leader
ship probably hopes that Wei. like so many
political dissidents before him. will become
insignificant once he leaves the country.
Third, it makes the I Jnited States look good.
That can only work to nurture relations
between the two economic superpowers.
But there is a flip side. Coming less than
a month after the Jiang-C'linton summit, the
release is simply one calculated gesture in a
series, manifesting China's policy of using
its own citizenry as political pawns in the
game of international politics, l or this rea
son, people like Lee query the wisdom ol
demanding the release of individuals, for it
accomplishes little (or nothing) in the big
picture of Chinese human rights and the
rule of law.
Last month many Chinese immigrants in
the I Jnited States — who do not harbor the
(much-justified) bitterness that political dis
sidents do — watched the mainland-China
bashing with disappointment. Sharing a
deep, genuine concern for the welfare ol
their country of origin, they witnessed I l»>l
lywood celebrities, legislators and activists
demand for the better treatment of dissi
dents, Tibetans, Christians and Chinese
people in general.

I 'hose immigrants reali/o something that
tew of those protesters do: poverty per
vades ('hina. W hen people are too hns\ 11 \
ing to figure out lum they will fill their lam
ilies' stomachs, the causes of I ibet and Wei
Jingsheng fail to register as urgent con
cerns.
So is it the place of well intentioned
Americans lo till this vacuum ol political
activism and speak out against the oppres
sive ( ommunist regime? After all. there are
few fights more noble than calling for the
liberation of an entire nation of people. ()ne
can never be on the wrong side ol the issue.
Hut good intentions can fall short: they only
go so far when theii owners lack a proper
understanding ol the people ilic\ claim to
be fighting for. As ing Ma. a research asso
ciate of the U.S. Council on I oreign Kola
lions, wrote: "We askvery simply. can one
cat liberty?" "
Noble ideals and causes are fine. Hut
when tliev are backed In emptv rhetoric
and blanket condemnations, their nobility
recedes and is replaced with naive opti
mism. Unfortunately, the lalter lacks both
the powei and the means to provide for
( hina's peasant population
What it comes down to is this: Hcijing is

ni>t going to live I ihct. Jiang is not going to
wake up tomorrow and realize the error ol
his ways. Hashing China will not help.
Demanding the release ol one or two
prominent dissidents will not help.
What will help is assistance that builds
toward the establishment ol institutions that
will guard against human rights abuses in
( liina.
F.ndcavors to form a sound legal system
and the promotion ol human rights aware
ness in ( hinese eivil society will be far more
effective than sanctimonious reprimands.
I he progress China lias made in the last
20 years in its social and economic realms
should not be underestimated, .lust last
vcar, China revised lis lawbooks to discard
all counter-revolutionary statutes, replacing
them with a tough state-security law. I low
ever. until the rule of law is given full reign,
there is little cause for missionaries of
democracy to celbrate and claim a little vic
tory.
Iherese Lee, a junior majorini> in history, is
just jealous of those who haw ideals to
for. She welt tunes anyone to diseuss ideals
with her on her return to Stan ford. . . if they
buy her a eu/t of eojfee.
