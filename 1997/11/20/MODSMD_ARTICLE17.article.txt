## Neal comes a long way for Cardinal Lone junior goes from walk-on frosh to budding senior leader 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
When Sarah Neal walks into practice, she doesn't
even have to look around to know that the junior class is
all present and accounted for.
Whether the team is working out in the weight room,
watching films or just hanging out. Neal's got tabs on all
the juniors on the third-ranked Stanford women's vol
leyball team.
That's because she's the only one.
"Being the only sophomore or the only junior isn't
that exciting." Neal said. "But being the only freshman
was definitely exciting. You get a little more attention,
and you're the young one of the group.
"Being the only senior is going to be a huge step be
cause I'm going to have to take on some leadership
roles."
Being the lone senior on any team is a big responsi
bility. But when you consider what the Cardinal will be
losing after this season, it makes the transition that
much bigger. The team's five seniors constitute one of
Stanford's best classes ever, and replacing their leader

ship on and off the court would be a monstrous task for
anyone.
"Ever since she's been here, she's had the upper
classmen to be the leaders on the team," said senior out
side hitter Debbie Lambert. "But 1 think she's a really
good person to fill that role. It's going to fall on her lap,
and she's going to have to deal with it. But I think she's
had the preparation and the understanding to take on
that role."
It isa bigstep.and it shows just how far Neal has come
from the day she showed up on the Farm. Back then,
Neal was just an intimidated freshman determined to
walk on to the defending national champion volleyball
team.
"Coming in I was really intimidated because 1 didn't
know what to expect." Neal said. "I wasjust excited to be
a part of a national championship team. I didn't know
what they would expect of me, so I just said Tm just
going to do the best that I can, I'm going to work the
hardest that I can and just see what happens.' "
But one shouldn't expect any less of a person with
such a long family tradition in athletics. Sarah's older
brother. Tyler, is a member of the national champi

unship men's volleyball team; her mother played tennis
at Stanford; her father was a Harvard football player;
and her uncle was on two national championship tennis
teams for the Cardinal. Neal's great-grandmother even
started the first women's field hockey team when she at
tended Stanford.
Neal's accomplishments on the Farm are impressive
in themselves.
Walk-ons aren't necessarily that unique, but It) walk
i)n as a defensive specialist is. What's more. Neal earned
a scholarship this season, making her one of only two de
fensive specialists to ever do so.
"The whole scholarship thing took me by surprise,"
Neal said. "Coming in I was just excited to be a part of
the team. I knew I was going to work hard, and it was just
such an honor to feel like I had earned the respect of the
coaches and the rest of the players."
Her teammates and coaehcs say Neal's hard work has
been the key to her impact on the squad.
Neal is the first player off the bench, replacing senior
middle blocker Paula McNamee in the back row, and
