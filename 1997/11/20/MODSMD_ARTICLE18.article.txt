# Big Spike!
## Cal comes to town in final Pac-10 match 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Tonight s contest against California isn't the biggest
match on the No. 3 Stanford women's volleyball sched
ule.
It isn't the last game of the season; it isn't the toughest.
It probably won't be the most exciting, and with the con
ference title wrapped up. it certainly isn't the most im
portant. But it's still Cal. and that always means some
thing.
"I think Cal is always going to be a big game just be
cause they're Cal," said junior defensive specialist Sarah
Neal. "It's always going to be one of those things where
you go out and really want to win badly, just because
they're Cal."
Tonight's 7 p.m. contest against the C Jolden Bears (N
-18, 3-14 Pacific 10 Conference) is the last conference
match of the year, and the Cardinal (26-2. 17-0) is look
ing to finish Pac-10 play with a perfect record for the sec
ond time in the last three years.
The Card went unblemished in IWS and only had one
conference lost last season, a four-game defeat at Wash

ington State.
It's also the last Pac-10 match for the five seniors on
the squad, a group that has amassed an incredible 69-2
conference mark in four years.
()ver that time Kristin Folkl, Lisa Sharpley. Barbara
Ifejika, Paula McNamee and Debbie Lambert have
won four Pac-10 titles and two national championships,
making them one ol the most highly decorated classes
ever.

■ T()N I(iI IT: No. 3 Stanford (26-2, 17-0) vs. (al (S IX, 3-
14) at Maples Pavilion, 7 p.m. RADIO: K/.SI )-I M ( l )().l)
"It's kind of anticlimactie," said Sharpley, a setter and
co-captain. "It's kind of weird to end with Cal. They're
not our toughest match of the year. But I'm excited to go
undefeated in Pac-IOs."
That 's not to say the ( ardinal is looking past ('aland
on to Sunday's senior night match against Hawaii. The
(iolden Bears may be a struggling team, but they always
manage to motivate lor a Stanford matchup.

Last season ('al surprised all ol' Maples Pavilion (and
mosi i»l the free world) by extending the ( ardinal lo five
games before falling short 12-15, 15-7. 15-7, 13 15. IK
-16.
Sharpley spent that weekend on the sidelines recov
ering from an injury, and the All American setter's ah
sence was felt, as Stanford looked completely out ol
sync.
"The thing is. it's Stanford and ( al," said head coach
Don Shaw. "Last year they came m here and had us on
the ropes in a match that shouldn't have been that close.
We can't take these guys lightly. ( al's not going to be in
timidated by us. It's still going to come down to us play
ing well."
( al may have been ready when it came to Maples last
season, but when the C ard visited Berkeley for their lirst
conference match Sept. lb, the (iolden Hears lasted |list
70 minutes.
C'al put up a miserable .115 hitting percentage, and
C al's kill leaders for that contest, junior middle blocker
Elena Merman and senior outside hitter Michelle Wiek
man, posted just seven kills apiece.
And the defense wasn't much
better. Ihe Golden Bears didn't
record a single block, and the Stan
ford offense cruised to a 15-5, 15-6,
15-3 win behind McNamee and Ifeji
ka, senior middle blockers, who had
1 2 and eight kills, respectively.
"They're not that strong, but
they're Cal," Neal said. "The ongo
ing rivalrv is going to motivate us in

the locker room, and we're going to
come out and not let what happened
last year happen."
With just two matches left, Stan
lord could easily be looking past this
weekend toward NCAA selection
day Sunday, Nov. 30. But after last
season, that's not likely.
"We take one game at a time,"
Neal said, it's always the match
we're playing that's the most impor
tant, hut on: sights are definitely
past Cal."
Those sights are set on being a
top seed for the N( AA tournament

and hosting a regional.
And with no big-time national
matches taking place this weekend.
Stanford's hopes will likely be real
i/cd — assuming, of course, that the
Card doesn't lose.
"I don't know if any of these
matches have a national impact,"
Shaw said, "unless we were to get
upset. We'd like to have good
crowds, and I hope that this match
will get the Big Cianie festivities
rolling. It'll be a good chance to get
a little Stanford-Cal competition
in."
