# Aguilera high-minded netminder
## Senior blossoms into one of nation's best for No. 2 Stanford 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
It's hard to believe that junior goalie ( hris
Aguilera's eareer as a starter began with a de
moralizing 15-7 road loss to U(-Irvine last
year.
It seems almost impossible after reviewing
a list of Aguilera's athletie accolades: lirst
team Mi-American out of San Jose's Bel
larmine Prep in both water polo and swim
ming: starting goalie for the U.S. Junior Na
tional team at the IW World Champi
onships: third-team All-American and sec
ond-team All-Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration last season.

Aguilera. now considered one of the top
two goalies in the nation sharing that dis
tinction with Pepperdine's Merrill Moses
remembers the loss to the Anteaters with a
grin.

WATER POLO

â–  SATURDAY: No. 2 Stanford (17-5.6-2) vs.
No. 4 C 'alifornia (19-5, 7-1) at deCiuerre Pool.
10 a.m.
"It was probably the worst game." Aguil
era said. "It was the first game last year, and
our team got whupped. It was probably good
for the team in the long run. It just made us
work harder."

Indeed, anchored by Aguilera's goaltend
ing, the '% squad finished the season with an
18-7 record and a No. 3 national ranking and
just missed a bid to the NCAA Champi
onships.
()n the season, Aguilera chalked up a stag
gering 221 saves, including 14 against defend
ing N( AA champion I J( 'LA.
Despite an occasionally painful elbow in
jury first suffered during a world champi
onship match against Hungary in '95, Aguil
era is currently in hot pursuit of last year's
record.
As co-captain of this year's squad cur
rently ranked No. 2in the nation Aguilera
has tallied 189 saves.
In a crucial 4-2 victory over top-ranked
Pepperdine at the Northern ( alifornia I our
nament Oct. 19, Aguilera collected 11 saves,
effectively shutting down the nation's top
scoring team.
"He's one ol the main reasons our defense
has played so well." said Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti. "He's saved us in many
games."
Dettamanti selected Aguilera to be the
team co-captain before the start ol the season
based upon his defensive leadership.
"He's the leader of the defense," Detta
manti said. "He's a quiet individual ... but
when he goes in the goal, something happens
to him."
( ardinal sophomore driver Brian I leiffer
on agreed.
"He's a very low-key individual, very re
served. He's not loud. He gets the job done."
I leifferon said. "It's a really comfortable feel
ing having C hris in the goal I Ic's really con
sistent."
And if Aguilera continues on his current
path, he will almost certainly follow the hal
lowed footsteps of past Stanford water polo
greats onto the NCAA All-American and
Olympic rosters.
"Stanford's always had really good
goalies," Heifferon said. "And Chris is just
carrying on the tradition."
Aguilera and his Cardinal teammates
wrap up the regular season Saturday with the
Big Splash, the team's annual grudge match
against California.
