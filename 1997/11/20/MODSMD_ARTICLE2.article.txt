# A 						speech, an Axe, a little fire
## Big Game rally tonight 
### James Pritchard 
While some traditions will stay the same lor tonight's
rally for the 100 th Big Game, others promise to quite lit
erally go up in smoke.
Gone are Lake Lagunita and the towering bonfire that
have been hallmarks of rallies past. In their place, the Axe
Committee, which organizes the event, is planning a
scaled-down fire at Arrillaga Amphitheater and the cus
tomary appearance of the Cardinal football team, along
with other surprises.
Even with all the changes, committee chair Matt
Bramlage, a junior, assured students that this year's rally
"should be a lot cooler than earlier years."
The rally will take place at 10 p.m. at the amphitheater
nestled between Arrillaga Family Sports Center and
deGuerre Pool.
Football Coach Tyrone Willingham and members of
the team will kick off the event with an inspirational ad
dress intended to energize the students. This speech will
be followed by a fireworks show and a video featuring
highlights from Stanford's Big C lame victory against I J( '-
Berkeley last year. The traditional presentation of the
Axe will be made. In addition, a history of the Axe will be
told bv Hal Michaelson, a former band announcer.
Senior Derek Norman and sophomore Anne-Caro
line Gamier, members of the committee, have put to
gether a slide show of pictures from previous games and
rallies. Also, Donner. which beat Branner and other
freshman dormitories in a contest in White Plaza I ues
day. earned the right to perform at the rally.
And. of course, there will be the bonfire. University
Bursar Jon Eriekson, faculty advisor to the committee
and a licensed pyrotechnician. will help oversee the blaze.
The committee has been planning and preparing for
this year's rally since the decision this September to keep
the rally out of the lake. I his decision was made jointly by
Vice Provosts James Montoya and (ieoffrey ( ox in con
currenee with I Jniversity President (ierhard ( asper. The
rally was moved from the lake after the 1992 rally in part
due to environmental concerns about protecting the tiger
salamanders' habitat.
Subsequent rallies have included a laser light show at
Hoover lower in 1993 and last year's small bonfire at
Wilbur field.
Since the September decision, committee members
have considered different venues and considered differ-
ent ideas lor this year's and future
rallies. In the end. the amphitheater
was decided on as the best place for
the event.
"Very early on, it was made very
clear that the Axe Committee was
wedded to the idea of a bonfire,"
said Dean of Students Marc Wais.
who helped oversee the decision
making process.
Norman, co-chair of the rally
with senior Erin Kassov. said. "We
wanted to preserve the basic ele
ments of what the Big Game rally is
with the presentation by the team
and the bonfire."
However. Norman is not entirely
satisfied with the current situation.
"We're hoping the administration
changes their mind (about Lake
Lag] when the climate here
changes," he said.
