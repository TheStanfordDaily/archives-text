"God's definition of love in
cludes many things but it does not in
clude homosexuality."
That was one of the controversial
things that Floyd Shaw of the Choic
es Ministry told a group of students
last night at the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center.
A student group of lesbian and
bisexual women invited Floyd and
other representatives of the Red
wood City Christian ministry to
speak at the center.
The ministry's mission is to try to
help gay Christians who want to be
come heterosexual. It has worked
with campus groups such as Campus
Crusade for Christ and Intervarsity
( hristian Fellowship.
Most of the students present
were gay men and women who
seemed more curious than personal-

Iv moved by the testimony of "ex
gays" and their friends. In fact, most
audience members who spoke made
it clear that they vehemently dis
agreed with the ministry's basic
premise.
"I was interested to get a differ
ent perspective and understand why
people have such a problem with ho
mosexuality." said Ciinny I'atton, a
second-year business school stu
dent.
Members of the ministry group
emphasized that while they consider
homosexuality to be an aberration
and a sin against God, they are not
trying to force anyone to do any
thing.
"We don't have enough time in
the day to answer all the phone calls
and letters from people who arc
struggling with their homosexuali
ty." said one group member. "We're
not at a loss for people to help."
Members of the group said they

thought homosexuality is a sinful
choice that is often the result of trau
matic early childhood experiences
such as distant or absent parents or
child abuse. All of the audience
members who spoke, however, said
that their own homosexuality was
not a choice.
For most of the meeting, the
panel and audience seemed relative
ly reserved. Sparks flew, however,
when panel member Jessica Stone
compared homosexuality to alco
holism and said that homosexual
love is a type of love that (iod con
demns.
In response to a student who said
that it was hypocritical for a Christ
ian to condemn love. Stone coun
✓
tered, "If a man has love for a child,
then it's molestation. Is that love
OK?"
Several audience members then
said that it was outrageous to com
pare their same-sex relationships to

child molestation, and Stone backed
off.
The tension between panel
members and the audience
prompted another member of the
panel to say, "We're there for the
men and women who have chosen
not to be gay. We're not here to
hurt you."
The decision to invite the group
to campus was in itself controversial.
"Why should we legitimize orga
nizations which are built around the
assumption that homosexuality is
morally wrong and that to be les
bian or gay is to be afflicted with dis
ease?" wrote a University staff
member to Stanford's gav e-mail
list.
Doctoral student Cora Schmid
responded, "Don't you think it will
be affirming to have us saying to
them 'Look, I'm glad you guvs are
happy now, but your experiences
are different from ours'?"
