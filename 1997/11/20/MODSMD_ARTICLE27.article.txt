# Stanford volunteers bring medical aid to New Guinea

### Dave Halsted 
A group of Stanford medical stu
dents. physicians and a pre-medieal
undergraduate are planning this
summer to embark on a medical
training trip to teach basic medicine
to the people of Papua New (iuinea.
Peter I u. a clinical instructor in
the Department of Dermatology
and a postdoctoral fellow at the
Howard Hughes Medical C enter, is
one ol two co ordinators for the
journey and led the program, now in
its third year, in IW6. "The central
theme of the missions is that we are
not there to help them," he said. "We
are there to serve them."
I raditionally, he said, short med
ical missions to needy peoples
amount to a quick fix and elevated
local expectations which cannot he
maintained. However, by doing as
little as possible to impose our first -
world values on them. Lu said, we
can "intervene in a way which truly
helps."
I acking all basic modern services
such as power and motorized trans
portation. Papua New (iuinea is a
collection ol small, isolated villages.
I .u said. I he culture is divided into
traditional gender roles, and hunting
and gathering is still the method of
subsistence.
Because almost no medical
knowledge exists on the island, peo
ple there commonly die from easily
treatable illnesses that, in some
cases, a simple Band-Aid could pre
vent. I ti explained. Only two part

time nurses are employed in the en
tire country, and they are inaccessi
ble to most of the population.
The first year's mission was an ex
ploratory one and established a clin
ic in each village visited. Many of
these villages had never met out
siders. and Lu found them very re
ceptive to the help.
The Stanford group operated a
one-day clinic for each village and
left behind one year's worth of the
most basic medical supplies.
A local was selected from each
village to attend a group training ses
sion, which Lu called "all of medical
school compressed in one week." In
dividual village medics were certi
fied through an arrangement with
the government and sent back to
their villages to maintain the clinics.
The second year, the Stanford
group discovered a surprisingly large
success rate lor the clinics and both
retrained medics and raised the total
number of villages involved.
Two new goals will be carried out
this summer. First. Lu said he wants
to encourage villagers to train each
other, ensuring that they won't de
pend on Stanford volunteers for
good basic health. Village medics
will be encouraged to present semi
nars 011 standard topics to their own
villages.
The second major goal is to train
female medics because cultural
norms there dictate that only women
can assist each other in matters such
as childbirth. Because only men have
been trained so far, conditions such

as the "outrageous" maternal mor
tality rate of 25 percent persist, said
Janelle Delp, staff physician in gen
eral pediatrics and adolescent medi
cine.
That and other women's health
data was collected last year and sug
gested simple solutions that can be
taught to improve women's health
there, said Shaine Muller, a senior
majoring in biology. This year, fe
male medics will be trained along
side men. Delp added that it will be
necessary to encourage the men in
the villages, who control all re
sources, to support this.
The trips prove as valuable to the
Stanford staff involved as they do to
the recipients of the help. Delp
stressed, "The most educational
thing for anybody is to teach other
people." She said it is "eye-opening"
to see medicine practiced where a
doctor's only resources are "your
eyes and ears and your two hands."
Lu said he hopes that funding for
the trip, which previously came
largely from the group's own pock
ets and the ( hristian Medical Dental
Society, will be easier to obtain this
year now that the School of Medi
cine has officially adopted the pro
gram. Now students can also earn
credit for the trip, though they must
still donate $I.(XK) to the project to
signify their commitment.
Lu still plans to limit the group to a
do/en people and said the "success of
the project is based on the participant
his or her ideas and motivation, no
matter what their prior training."
