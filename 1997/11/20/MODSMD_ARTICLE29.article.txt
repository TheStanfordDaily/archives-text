Art
NOW-JAN-16
Go see the latest exhibit at the Stanford Facul
ty Club called "Jinshan Folk Art Painting."
Jinshan is a rural Chinese village located out
side of Shanghai in the Yangtze River delta.
During the past 2.0 years, folk painting has
emerged as a thriving local art form. The
painters, mostly women, have had no formal
art training and have never been taught per
spective, so it is difficult for them to achieve a
three-dimensional effect in their painting.

Most of the paintings depict Chinese legends
and folk tales. Free. Stanford Faculty Club.
