# Two years of the 'W'
## Grade changes receive mixed student reviews 
### Arthur Hu Staff writer 
I'vvo years alter several changes to the grading poli
cy were first implemented, students have mixed leel
ings about them while the advising community believes
the changes have had little elTect.
In the fall quarter of the IWS-% academic year.
Stanford implemented the grade of "W", which signi
lies a student's withdrawal from a class after the fourth
full week of the quarter. Students who drop a class after
the eighth full week of the quarter receive the grade
they had at the time of the drop.
Previously, students were able to drop a class at any
point up to the final exam without anything showing up
cm their transcript.
Among seniors the only class that has experi
eneed both systems there is not complete agreement
over whether the changes were for the better.
Senior John Bcrbcrian, a biology major, said he feels
satisfied with the new system. "I 'nder the old system, a
lot of people could withdraw before the final, which
would raise the mean. 1 "his punished those who stayed
in the class but were not among the elite performers.
I he new system keeps the mean a lot truer. If you real
ly need to take a class, you're going to take it."
I )andre DeSandics. an associate director of the I In
dergraduate Advising Center, said he feels that the
changes have not had a significant impact on students
or advising.
"It hasn't changed mv way of givinc advice. Students
were always discussing reasons for
adding and dropping. However, it
does change the way students ap
proach advising.,. .There is more
strategizing over whether or not to
drop, withdraw or petition," said
DeSandies.
"For students very concerned
about grades, a 'W' makes a huge
difference, and these students talk
about how to avoid them. Others are
still fairly happy that they still have
such a late deadline to decide," he
added.
Verity Powell, an advising con
sultant at the IJAC who has been at
Stanford for 17 years, said that
under the old system there was noth
ing to force students to work hard in
a class, knowing they could drop it at
anytime. The withdrawal deadline
forces students to choose a little ear
lier on, Powell explained.

Tran said she felt the deadline
could cause students to drop a class
prematurely just because they did
not do well in the beginning. "There
is always room for improvement."
said Tran, noting the deadline may
limit how much a student is willing to
risk in a class.
On the other hand. Powell said,
even with the deadline, students
may not realize that a course has its
workload heavily distributed to
wards the end of the quarter.
The "withdraw" grade, though it
appears on a student's transcript, is
not figured into one's grade-point
average. DeSandies said the regis
trar and some faculty felt it was un
fair for people to look at a transcript
that might not show a student's com
plete history.
Other changes to the grading sys
tem included the extension of the
Pass/No Credit option into the
sixth week of the quarter, as well as
a symbol on the transcript indicating
that a course has been repeated.

Similar to the " W." these ehanges
haven't had a substantial impact. "1
haven't heard one student make an
issue out of this, so it can't have af
fected them too much. Practically
though, an adviser must be aware of
these deadlines, so that they can
help students make decisions in a
timely way." said Kathv Wright, as
sociate director of the center.
"Any concerns I had about the
new system were quickly alleviat
ed," she added.
Powell said she also feels the new
system does a good job addressing
issues other than a student's acade
mic history. "1 had more concerns
about the perception lhat somehow
there was rampant grade inflation
here because personally I didn't see
it," she said.
DeSandies said the changes have
been, overall, for the best. "It's been
helpful to students because now they
have to really think about what class
es they want to take. The attitude is
not as cavalier as used to be." he said.
