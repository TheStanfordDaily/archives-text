## Director David Mackay returns to the Farm 
### Benjamin Howell 
English majors who fear a bleak future of ana
lyzing Chaucer and economics majors dreading
that instant sweep into the corporate ladder can
sigh a breath of relief and find inspiration in the
career path of filmmaker David Mackay. Mackay,
who graduated from Stanford in 1985 as an eco
nomics major, has directed two Hollywood fea
tures and has taken films to the prestigious
Cannes and Sundance festivals.
Mackay also served as producer for his latest
film, "The lesser Evil," with his background in
economics serving him well. Independent film's
biggest enemy is financing, and Mackay's clever
solution was to construct a three-pronged finance
system of investors, foreign pre-sales and bank
loans. The film has been pre sold to many foreign
markets and is currently being reviewed by the
major U.S. distributors.
Mackay's interest in film began in high school,
where he discovered a love for still photography.
He continued his hobby at Stanford as a photog
rapher for The Daily. "On a whim," Mackay en
rolled in a film production class his senior year. "I

had to sort of sneak in the class at first and just
audit it until one of the comm majors dropped,
and 1 could take their place."
After graduation and a couple of years in the
investment banking world, Mackay applied to
graduate school. "I couldn't decide between busi
ness or film school, so I applied to both. When I
got into all of the film schools 1 applied to, I decid
ed to pursue film."
Mackay chose to attend the renowned Univer
sity of Southern California Film School and was
soon making short films in both the Super 8 and
16mm film format. His thesis film, titled "Provi
dence," tells the story of a precocious high school
er who sneaks into classes at Brown in search of an
intellectual challenge. Mackay and his film were
awarded with an invitation to the Sundance Film
Festival where "Providence" was well received.
Mackay found an agent, and offers to direct a
feature-length version of "Providence" soon fol
lowed. Though the film did not survive Holly
wood's laborious process of revisions required to
make a "good" film a "marketable" one, "Provi

dence" brought Mackay the attention he de
served. The young director was soon working on
his first feature film — rewriting and directing
"Breaking Away," which premiered on the Disney
Channel.
Mackay had a great premise for a movie. After
an accidental shooting, a group of teenagers are
faced with a horrible moral dilemma: do they take
the dying man to a hospital and face the conse
quences or let him die alone in the woods and at
tempt to forget the entire incident? Two friends of
Mackay began work on such a screenplay and
turned out a short, 70-page skeleton of the plot
that was to become "The Lesser Evil."
The script opens with a priest's interior mono
logue confessing to a murder that was linked to
the earlier accidental death. "We were working
from a great premise — a priest commits murder
and a crime long concealed comes back to haunt
the accidental criminals. We knew we wanted a
big twist at the end, but we didn't know what it
should be," Mackay said. Working closely with
the writers, Mackay had an interesting task: to
construct a tight chain of facts that lead logically
from the premise to a shocking but substantiated
conclusion.

"We wanted to make a film
with a surprise ending like 'The
Usual Suspects,' but one in which
the facts all add up," Mackay said.
"This is not easy to do because the
ending won't be satisfying if the
facts are too obvious and the viewer
can figure it out. The element of
surprise is essential but under that
surprise must be an authentic string
of facts." "The I-esser Evil'"s shock
ing conclusion reveals which char
acter's corpse is in the casket in the
opening sequence. "Everyone
should be culpable of something, so
in the end you don't know who gets
it," Mackay said.
"The L-esser Evil" opens with
long, slow panning shots of a funer
al accompanied by a somber mono
logue. As the camera travels up the
casket to the priest standing before
it, it becomes apparent that the
monologue is the priest 's just as he
utters: "He was my best friend...
that is why it was so hard to kill

him." The premise is set, and the intrigue, now es
tablished, can only increase.
"The Lesser Evil" is a film in two parts about
one unfortunate incident: Four high school bud
dies are reunited after 22 years when Derrick, now
the owner of a local lumberyard, mysteriously
summons them to his cabin. 1 le reveals that he is
under investigation for murder; his gun has been
found in a sunken car in a drained quarry lake. As
the details of the pending investigation are re
vealed, flashbacks to the same four characters in
high school reveal the context of the crime. By de
veloping both the present crisis and the details of
the 22 year old crime simultaneously, the intrigue
is maintained, and the plot progresses like a two
faced mystery toward the foretold second murder.
There is a constant and purposeful contrast be
tween the scenes in the cabin and the flashbacks.
While the cabin scenes begin with tense hellos and
quickly proceed to much needed drinks being
shared nervously by all, the flashback opens with
jocular punches, teenage pranks and the illicit
purchase of beer.

As the details of the present investigation of
Derrick unfold, so too do the circumstances of the
crime. The four teenagers are harassed by arche
typal "bullies-in-lettermen's-jackets," and plot
their revenge. Their "foolproof" plan to frighten
the bullies is, to any movie-literate viewer, a sure
sign of a plan about to go horribly wrong: when
the bullies pull up to the quarry, they'll just "scare
the shit" out of them with Derrick's gun. Let's just
say that the red Camaro that pulls up and looks
;i«f like the bully ringleader's, is not, and things go
downhill quickly from there.
Not only did Mackay choose parallel yet con
trasting action to distinguish between the present
and the flashbacks, but he employed formal tech
niques, shot selection, editing and filters to elicit
distinct emotional responses for each time period.
The cabin scenes, full of close-ups and warm, well
lit shots are described by Mackay as "color satu
rated" and are meant to evoke a claustrophobic
environment wrought with introverted tension.
The flashback scenes use "desaturated color,"
which gives them a dated look and reminds the
audience that they are in the past. The flashback

sequences feature wide, expansive
shots and few close-ups which speak of
youthful freedom and its invincible vi
sion.
Shots of the cool blue and sheer
gray walls of the quarry lake must be
noted for their remarkable cinematog
raphy and the flashback's establishing
shots for their sleek, stylish portrayal of
the 19705. A black Cadillac convertible
and wrap around shades combined
with sweeping long shots paint an al
most romantically hip portrait of the
era, but the careful attention paid to
the flashback's aesthetic becomes less
apparent as the dramatic action inten
sifies.
As the tension of both crises
mounts, the psychological machina
tions of the characters grow more
complex, and soon the friends, young
and old, are taking sides, yelling and
cursing each other. The parallels con-

tinue, and soon it is every man for himself as ill
loyalties are thrown out. Long hidden secrets of
the crime are revealed in the cabin, and what was
once a simple accident becomes a tangled web of
plots and counter plots.
While the flashback sequences conclude anti
climatically with the four friends parting ways, the
cabin sequence reaches a climax when the priest,
off screen, fires two shots. An immediate cut to tin
same funeral does not reveal the victim until after
the ceremony when the surviving three appear u
gether in the rain. Mackay does a truly remarkable
job in drawing out the film's central intrigue
"Who is in that casket?"
"The Lesser Evil" is a fun movie to watch — the
intrigue is established from the opening scene and
continues throughout the film. The final twist in
the plot is a shocker, and while it may not seem to
follow from the facts at first, a moment's thought
will bring it all together. Mackay has granted the
Stanford Film Society the privilege to show an ad
vance screening of "The Lesser Evil." I suggest th.u
you do not miss this unique opportunity to see h
film before the rest of the world does.

;i«f like the bully ringleader's, is not, and things go
downhill quickly from there.
Not only did Mackay choose parallel yet con
trasting action to distinguish between the present
and the flashbacks, but he employed formal tech
niques, shot selection, editing and filters to elicit
distinct emotional responses for each time period.
The cabin scenes, full of close-ups and warm, well
lit shots are described by Mackay as "color satu
rated" and are meant to evoke a claustrophobic
environment wrought with introverted tension.
The flashback scenes use "desaturated color,"
which gives them a dated look and reminds the
audience that they are in the past. The flashback

sequences feature wide, expansive
shots and few close-ups which speak of
youthful freedom and its invincible vi
sion.
Shots of the cool blue and sheer
gray walls of the quarry lake must be
noted for their remarkable cinematog
raphy and the flashback's establishing
shots for their sleek, stylish portrayal of
the 19705. A black Cadillac convertible
and wrap around shades combined
with sweeping long shots paint an al
most romantically hip portrait of the
era, but the careful attention paid to
the flashback's aesthetic becomes less
apparent as the dramatic action inten
sifies.
As the tension of both crises
mounts, the psychological machina
tions of the characters grow more
complex, and soon the friends, young
and old, are taking sides, yelling and
cursing each other. The parallels con-

tinue, and soon it is every man for himself as ill
loyalties are thrown out. Long hidden secrets of
the crime are revealed in the cabin, and what was
once a simple accident becomes a tangled web of
plots and counter plots.
While the flashback sequences conclude anti
climatically with the four friends parting ways, the
cabin sequence reaches a climax when the priest,
off screen, fires two shots. An immediate cut to tin
same funeral does not reveal the victim until after
the ceremony when the surviving three appear u
gether in the rain. Mackay does a truly remarkable
job in drawing out the film's central intrigue
"Who is in that casket?"
"The Lesser Evil" is a fun movie to watch — the
intrigue is established from the opening scene and
continues throughout the film. The final twist in
the plot is a shocker, and while it may not seem to
follow from the facts at first, a moment's thought
will bring it all together. Mackay has granted the
Stanford Film Society the privilege to show an ad
vance screening of "The Lesser Evil." I suggest th.u
you do not miss this unique opportunity to see h
film before the rest of the world does.

English majors who fear a bleak future of ana
lyzing Chaucer and economics majors dreading
that instant sweep into the corporate ladder can
sigh a breath of relief and find inspiration in the
career path of filmmaker David Mackay. Mackay,
who graduated from Stanford in 1985 as an eco
nomics major, has directed two Hollywood fea
tures and has taken films to the prestigious
Cannes and Sundance festivals.
Mackay also served as producer for his latest
film, "The lesser Evil," with his background in
economics serving him well. Independent film's
biggest enemy is financing, and Mackay's clever
solution was to construct a three-pronged finance
system of investors, foreign pre-sales and bank
loans. The film has been pre sold to many foreign
markets and is currently being reviewed by the
major U.S. distributors.
Mackay's interest in film began in high school,
where he discovered a love for still photography.
He continued his hobby at Stanford as a photog
rapher for The Daily. "On a whim," Mackay en
rolled in a film production class his senior year. "I

had to sort of sneak in the class at first and just
audit it until one of the comm majors dropped,
and 1 could take their place."
After graduation and a couple of years in the
investment banking world, Mackay applied to
graduate school. "I couldn't decide between busi
ness or film school, so I applied to both. When I
got into all of the film schools 1 applied to, I decid
ed to pursue film."
Mackay chose to attend the renowned Univer
sity of Southern California Film School and was
soon making short films in both the Super 8 and
16mm film format. His thesis film, titled "Provi
dence," tells the story of a precocious high school
er who sneaks into classes at Brown in search of an
intellectual challenge. Mackay and his film were
awarded with an invitation to the Sundance Film
Festival where "Providence" was well received.
Mackay found an agent, and offers to direct a
feature-length version of "Providence" soon fol
lowed. Though the film did not survive Holly
wood's laborious process of revisions required to
make a "good" film a "marketable" one, "Provi

dence" brought Mackay the attention he de
served. The young director was soon working on
his first feature film — rewriting and directing
"Breaking Away," which premiered on the Disney
Channel.
Mackay had a great premise for a movie. After
an accidental shooting, a group of teenagers are
faced with a horrible moral dilemma: do they take
the dying man to a hospital and face the conse
quences or let him die alone in the woods and at
tempt to forget the entire incident? Two friends of
Mackay began work on such a screenplay and
turned out a short, 70-page skeleton of the plot
that was to become "The Lesser Evil."
The script opens with a priest's interior mono
logue confessing to a murder that was linked to
the earlier accidental death. "We were working
from a great premise — a priest commits murder
and a crime long concealed comes back to haunt
the accidental criminals. We knew we wanted a
big twist at the end, but we didn't know what it
should be," Mackay said. Working closely with
the writers, Mackay had an interesting task: to
construct a tight chain of facts that lead logically
from the premise to a shocking but substantiated
conclusion.

"We wanted to make a film
with a surprise ending like 'The
Usual Suspects,' but one in which
the facts all add up," Mackay said.
"This is not easy to do because the
ending won't be satisfying if the
facts are too obvious and the viewer
can figure it out. The element of
surprise is essential but under that
surprise must be an authentic string
of facts." "The I-esser Evil'"s shock
ing conclusion reveals which char
acter's corpse is in the casket in the
opening sequence. "Everyone
should be culpable of something, so
in the end you don't know who gets
it," Mackay said.
"The L-esser Evil" opens with
long, slow panning shots of a funer
al accompanied by a somber mono
logue. As the camera travels up the
casket to the priest standing before
it, it becomes apparent that the
monologue is the priest 's just as he
utters: "He was my best friend...
that is why it was so hard to kill

him." The premise is set, and the intrigue, now es
tablished, can only increase.
"The Lesser Evil" is a film in two parts about
one unfortunate incident: Four high school bud
dies are reunited after 22 years when Derrick, now
the owner of a local lumberyard, mysteriously
summons them to his cabin. 1 le reveals that he is
under investigation for murder; his gun has been
found in a sunken car in a drained quarry lake. As
the details of the pending investigation are re
vealed, flashbacks to the same four characters in
high school reveal the context of the crime. By de
veloping both the present crisis and the details of
the 22 year old crime simultaneously, the intrigue
is maintained, and the plot progresses like a two
faced mystery toward the foretold second murder.
There is a constant and purposeful contrast be
tween the scenes in the cabin and the flashbacks.
While the cabin scenes begin with tense hellos and
quickly proceed to much needed drinks being
shared nervously by all, the flashback opens with
jocular punches, teenage pranks and the illicit
purchase of beer.

As the details of the present investigation of
Derrick unfold, so too do the circumstances of the
crime. The four teenagers are harassed by arche
typal "bullies-in-lettermen's-jackets," and plot
their revenge. Their "foolproof" plan to frighten
the bullies is, to any movie-literate viewer, a sure
sign of a plan about to go horribly wrong: when
the bullies pull up to the quarry, they'll just "scare
the shit" out of them with Derrick's gun. Let's just
say that the red Camaro that pulls up and looks
;i«f like the bully ringleader's, is not, and things go
downhill quickly from there.
Not only did Mackay choose parallel yet con
trasting action to distinguish between the present
and the flashbacks, but he employed formal tech
niques, shot selection, editing and filters to elicit
distinct emotional responses for each time period.
The cabin scenes, full of close-ups and warm, well
lit shots are described by Mackay as "color satu
rated" and are meant to evoke a claustrophobic
environment wrought with introverted tension.
The flashback scenes use "desaturated color,"
which gives them a dated look and reminds the
audience that they are in the past. The flashback

sequences feature wide, expansive
shots and few close-ups which speak of
youthful freedom and its invincible vi
sion.
Shots of the cool blue and sheer
gray walls of the quarry lake must be
noted for their remarkable cinematog
raphy and the flashback's establishing
shots for their sleek, stylish portrayal of
the 19705. A black Cadillac convertible
and wrap around shades combined
with sweeping long shots paint an al
most romantically hip portrait of the
era, but the careful attention paid to
the flashback's aesthetic becomes less
apparent as the dramatic action inten
sifies.
As the tension of both crises
