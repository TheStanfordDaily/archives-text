## Intermission talks to Jodi Benson, voice of 'The little Mermaid' 
### Randy Mano Contributing writer 
Believe it or not, "The Little Mermaid" has not played in theaters
since the 1980s. Until Nov. 30, the digitally-restored sound and color
of the aquatic adventure will be capturing the delight of audiences,
young and old, across America.
Eight years ago, a little-known actress named Jodi Benson cap
tured the title role of Ariel, a 16-year-old mermaid longing for a
human body. As a performer, Benson actually wanted to focus on
taking parts in Broadway musicals, not in animation. But she em
braced the opportunity to work with producer-songwriter Howard
Ashman.
As her voice director, Ashman had given her "two pages of dia
logue. .. and her personality" to make a demo tape of the songs. Be
cause voices are typically recorded prior to the completion of the final
drawings, Benson had to figure out how to play Ariel without seeing
what her character would eventually look like.
"Animation is more mental preparation in establishing the char
acter [compared to stage acting]. In the studio, it's a lot more unin
hibited. The more uninhibited and child-like I can become, the more
opportunities they have to really get playful with the character," Ben
son said.
In essence, Benson never met the other people involved in the film
until the first day of rehearsal — a first in Disney history. The idea was
to get the voice-over actors to record simultaneously and make the
pencil sketches come to life. The various characters, with wholly new
personalities and appearances, would evolve from the tapes that the
actors made.
A native of Rockford, 111., Benson has used "The Little Mermaid"
as a springboard for other jobs in the family entertainment industry.
In 1990, she used her voice to give full life to Barry Manilow's songs

in "Thumbelina." Benson had grown up a devoted Manilow-fan, but
ironically enough, he shook Zierhand when they first met and told her
what a big fan he is of her singing! Although she admits that the low
grossing film most likely used her as a marketing ploy, Benson
doesn't regret her decision to take the role. It was a fun and cute out
ing. .. plus she got to see Barry Manilow.
This Thanksgiving, Walt Disney Pictures will release "Flubber," a
comedy starring Robin Williams as a mad scientist. In this case, the
film was already completed, and writer )ohn Hughes instructed Ben
son to improvise with Williams by tilling in the voice for Weebo, a
strong-willed and sassy robot. This is no small task, given that she had
to compliment the flamboyant Williams, so she conjured up the tal
cnt that had shined so brightly in " The Little Mermaid." She is hop
ing to see Williams at the premiere because she didn't get to meet him
personally on the film set.
As a devout Christian, she believes that her God-given talent to
sing and act should be used for the benefit of children.
"1 don't want to go taking my clothes off, and I don't want to go
talking about subject matter that I feel uncomfortable with. I want to
feel proud of my work. I don't think I'll see myself in (a movie) like
'Pulp Fiction.' It's just not me; it's not where my strengths lie," she
said.
In addition, she has used her unshaking religious faith to educate
kids about the Bible. Under Sparrow Records, she has assisted in the
Beginner's Bible I and II projects as a narrator. A video series, com
plete with singing and dancing, was later released in 1994, and it is still
selling in children's stores.
Yet her life has not been perfect, as one might imagine of a talent
ed singer and actress. I ler parents disapproved of her aspirations to
become a stage star when she switched from pre-law to theater dur
ing her freshman year at Decatur University in Illinois. She dropped
out of school, traveled to New York and managed to get a Tony- nom

inated role in the Broadway production "Crazy for You." Ten years
later, she returned to school to obtain her degree. Now, whenever she
talks to students, she no longer feels inadequate about her own edu
cational background.
Benson and 1 are in agreement that it is a shame " The Little Mer
maid" appears to be the last hand painted, hand drawn, full-length
animated feature from the Disney studios. Benson's life changed for
ever when she decided to audition for the role of Ariel. Though she
hasn't watched the film in five years, she plans to see there released
version, along with others (including myself) of the "new generation"
who have not gone under the sea.
By the way, for those of you who are curious, she truly does have
a small fin protruding from her body. Well, maybe only in spirit.
