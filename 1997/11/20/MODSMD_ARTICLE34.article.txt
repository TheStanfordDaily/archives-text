# A 						Rugrats Thanksgiving
## 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
Think cartoons. Think
overblown imaginations driven
by innocence. Think oversized
heads and talking 2-year-olds.
Think all these things, and
you've got "Rugrats."
When we were younger,
Nickelodeon attempted to feed
and nurture our thriving child
minds, and now the only kid's
channel continues to mix enter
tainment with lessons of life in
its programming.
"A Rugrats Thanksgiving" is
the station's second straight-to
video "Rugrats" title, and
though it may not own up to the
same caliber of entertainment as
its cartoon cohorts "The Simp
sons" and "South Park" (for
Stanford students anyway), this
is definitely something to keep in
mind for use in keeping those
cousins, nephews and nieces
busily entertained over the holi
days coming up.
The most remarkable thing
about "Rugrats" is the way in

which it captures the innocent
thoughts of children. The sim
plistic views of the babies
Tommy, Chuckie and the twins
Phil and Lil hint of the indelible
characters from Winnie-the-
Pooh stories. In addition to the
children's view, however, "Ru
grats" includes an adult perspec
tive in the form of the babies'
parents and friends, and it shows
us how truly foolish grown-ups
can be in their complicating
views of life.
The video includes three
"Rugrats" episodes, the first of
which is titled, "The Turkey
Who Came to Dinner." In this
one, the families of the main
characters are gathering for
Thanksgiving dinner. All the
adults are bickering over various
things: the women fight over
how to cook the turkey, the men
argue over which football game
to watch on which of the many
television sets they bring for the
occasion, and conniving and
self-centered Angelica is dead set
on forcing the babies to help her
put together her own Thanksgiv

ing parade in the backyard.
Meanwhile the babies are busy
planning their own Thanksgiv
ing dinner.
Trouble ensues when a live
turkey is delivered to the house
— the grown-ups try to eat it
while the babies try to befriend
the confused fowl and invite it to
a dinner of cereal and milk. The
episode is full of laughs and crazy
grandpas and, of course, ends
with a message about the true
meaning of Thanksgiving.
This episode is done well and
promotes its message amid a dis
array of multiple "subplots" that
come together in the end. Of
course, political correctness
cleverly finds its way into the
show, as the babies play "Naky
Americans" and "Penguins."
The second episode, "Chuck
ie is Rich," explores how people
can change when they come into
money. Chuckie's father, Chaz,
wins $10 million in a Publisher's
Clearing House-type sweep
stakes, and he immediately
moves into a lavish mansion and
buys far too many clothes and

toys than either father or son
knows what to do with.
The plot is a bit rushed, but it
is meant to be run in a half-hour
time slot with commercials, so
that's forgivable. The episode
gets its point across, although it
promotes the idea that all people
who suddenly come into money
become instant jerks.
The last episode, titled "Home
Movies," has the babies drawing
their own home movies in place
of watching their parents' actual
movies. This one is really cute, as
the babies' crayon sketches come
to life in animation as each tells a
story from his own perspective,
and eventually the adults aban
don their actual home movies to
view the sketched imaginings of
their children.
"Rugrats" is first and fore
most a kids' show, and it's prob
ably not something that Stan
ford students are going to run
out and buy because of this arti
de. Still, definitely keep this one
in mind when all the little tikes
gather with family for Thanks
giving.
