# book review / interview
## Ethan Hawke is a really nice guy 
### Catherine Quinones Editorial staff 
"Write something nice about me!" Ethan
I lawke shouted as I was leaving his book signing
at Printers, Inc. in Palo Alto last Saturday.
"OK," I nodded and turned to go.
There was a slight pause and then he called
out, "Hey! You don't have to write something
nice if you don't want to!"
All I could say was "OK" again because the
whole time I was thinking: "Well, of course I'm
going to write something nice. You're a nice guy."
That's right — Ethan Hawke is undeniably a
nice guy. Despite being an accomplished actor of
stage and screen, as well as a published novelist,
Hawke does not have an attitude. He is easy to
talk to and has a great sense of humor that can put
anyone at ease.
Go back seven years and you'll remember
I lawke as baby-faced worrywart Todd Anderson
in "Dead Poets Society." Then "White Fang" and
"Alive" happened. And then "Reality Bites" and
"Before Sunrise" made him the scruffy-looking
Generation X poster boy. Last month he shed that
image and more in "Gattaca," a futuristic film
that takes a look at the implications of genetic en
gineering. (It's pretty cool — go see it.) Next
month, Hawke plays Finn (a.k.a. Pip) in an up
dated version of "Great Expectations" with
Gwyneth Paltrow.
I lawke's impressive list of credits does not end
there. He studied theater in England wiih the
British Theater Association and at Carnegie Mel
lon University. He's performed with the Nation
al Actors Theater and Steppenwolf Theater, a dis
tinguished theater company in Chicago that
sports other critically-acclaimed alumni like
Gary Sinise and Joan Allen. He's also founder and
artistic director of Malaparte, a theater company
in New York.
As if that wasn't enough for a 27-year-old, his
novel "The Hottest State" (Vintage Contempo
raries, $11) is in its second printing. This some
what autobiographical book is a good read.
William, a young actor in New York City and
the narrator of "The Hottest State," falls in love
with Sarah, a somewhat mysterious pre-school
teacher with aspirations to be a singer. William
falls in love hard, but Sarah doesn't fully recipro
cate. The first half of the novel details their short
lived, yet passionate relationship, and the second
half drags the reader through the misery of
William's crushing rejection.
Interspersed between scenes from this rela
tionship are flashbacks from William's child
hood. His parents divorced when he was very
young and the last time he saw his father was
when he was 7 years old. William feels the pain of
growing up without his father keenly.
There are some corny moments, some mo
ments of solemnity, some of absurdity and some
of absolute hilarity. And everything rings true.
Hawke understands relationships.
"It's the story of a young man who places all
his identity—" Hawke tried to sum up his book
but cut himself off, searching for the right words
and muttered resentfully, "This is one of those
'in 20 words or less' things." He paused and ad
mitted, "It needs to be late at night for me to dis
cuss that intelligently at all." After another pause,
he seemed to have found more appropriate
words. "It's about finding some sense of self
from the relationships we have with people."
Hawke was on a roll but cut himself off again and
gave up with exasperation, "I don't know — read

the book!"
And you should. Hawke creates quirky char
acters, but keeps them believable. William
wears a dress one moment, takes the Concord
the next (see sidebar), complains about his con
tacts and then sleeps with three women in two
weeks. Sarah is somewhat pudgy — this is a
turn-on for William — and has some problems
with intimacy. Put them together and you get
quite a pair.
Here's a little taste: early on during the break
up phase of their relationship, William starts
howling at Sarah's apartment window.

When Sarah walked out she was
wearing a bright-red rain jacket with a
hood. I could tell she was pissed.
"Oh come on," 1 said to her scowling
expression. Still holding the fluorescent
orange cone, I pointed to my tuxedo.
"How do you like my outfit?... It smy
'I'm sorry' outfit."
"It's nice. Why are you wearing it?"
she asked, immediately beginning to
walk down the sidewalk.
"Because I'm sorry."
"Look, I have to go to work," she said.
I know. Can I walk you?"
It was a cool November morning, and
we both had hair that was still damp
from the shower. She didn't have any
stockings on and her legs were all pink
and prickly. So was her face. The cold
light made her eyes look fiercely green. I
wondered again if she was Irish. I
couldn't believe that I didn't know.
"Are you Irish?" I asked.
"What?" she asked. She wis walking
with purpose.
"Nothing," I said. "Okay, so here's
the deal. I'll do the talking, all right? Be
cause I have some things to say and be
cause you don't look particularly talka
tive. Not that you don't look good, be
cause you do. That's why I asked the
thing about if you were Irish. . .
The whole Irish thing. I couldn't
help but ask if he has a thing for Irish
girls. In response he explained that
Sarah "is based on my sister. I admire
a lot of qualities about her. I'm not
sleeping with my sister or anything!"
he laughed, "It's just that you learn a
lot about the opposite sex from your
siblings."
Hawke said that the book came
from "a collection of short stories and
it just kind of evolved into what it is."
I le worked on it off and on for three
and a half years and wrote wherever
he happened to be. And how did he
find time to write an entire novel?
"Being an actor, you have these long
stays of unemployment, when the
phone doesn't ring," he explained.
Hawke said he would be disap
pointed if he didn't publish anymore
books and is working on something
right now. "I'm always working on
different things and just see what it
amounts to," he said.
With so much going on with his
multiple careers, it's hard to imagine
what Hawke would do if he just had
some free time. Hawke seemed to find
this hard to imagine too.

"I'd go eat something. I don't know.
Am I in San Francisco?"
"Wherever you want," I said. This seemed
like a new idea for him.
"I'd go to a museum. It depends if I have any
friends around," he said with an abashed laugh,
"If I do, if something groovy's going on I'd find
out what it is and go do it. I can't believe that I
just used the word 'groovy!' " he exclaimed with
embarrassment, then burst out with, "What
would you do?" I admitted that I would catch up
on some sleep. "Yeah, me too. Sleep," still not
sounding entirely comfortable with his answer.

Hawke may be doubtful about what occupies
his down time, but he is clear on the motivation
that drives his otherwise busy life. "There's a
preschool down the street from my house and
[the kids] scream and holler. That gets me out of
the bed in the morning. They scream 'Look at
me! Look at me!' That's what I've been doing my
whole life."
When asked if he had anything else to add to
the interview, he replied, "That's all. 1 don't have
any sage wisdom for the world, you know? I just
go about my business." Given a little more time
to think, he changed his mind and said simply,
"This too shall pass."

"Write something nice about me!" Ethan
I lawke shouted as I was leaving his book signing
at Printers, Inc. in Palo Alto last Saturday.
"OK," I nodded and turned to go.
There was a slight pause and then he called
out, "Hey! You don't have to write something
nice if you don't want to!"
All I could say was "OK" again because the
whole time I was thinking: "Well, of course I'm
going to write something nice. You're a nice guy."
That's right — Ethan Hawke is undeniably a
nice guy. Despite being an accomplished actor of
stage and screen, as well as a published novelist,
Hawke does not have an attitude. He is easy to
talk to and has a great sense of humor that can put
anyone at ease.
Go back seven years and you'll remember
I lawke as baby-faced worrywart Todd Anderson
in "Dead Poets Society." Then "White Fang" and
"Alive" happened. And then "Reality Bites" and
"Before Sunrise" made him the scruffy-looking
Generation X poster boy. Last month he shed that
image and more in "Gattaca," a futuristic film
that takes a look at the implications of genetic en
gineering. (It's pretty cool — go see it.) Next
month, Hawke plays Finn (a.k.a. Pip) in an up
dated version of "Great Expectations" with
Gwyneth Paltrow.
I lawke's impressive list of credits does not end
there. He studied theater in England wiih the
British Theater Association and at Carnegie Mel
lon University. He's performed with the Nation
al Actors Theater and Steppenwolf Theater, a dis
tinguished theater company in Chicago that
sports other critically-acclaimed alumni like
Gary Sinise and Joan Allen. He's also founder and
artistic director of Malaparte, a theater company
in New York.
As if that wasn't enough for a 27-year-old, his
novel "The Hottest State" (Vintage Contempo
raries, $11) is in its second printing. This some
what autobiographical book is a good read.
William, a young actor in New York City and
the narrator of "The Hottest State," falls in love
with Sarah, a somewhat mysterious pre-school
teacher with aspirations to be a singer. William
falls in love hard, but Sarah doesn't fully recipro
cate. The first half of the novel details their short
lived, yet passionate relationship, and the second
half drags the reader through the misery of
William's crushing rejection.
Interspersed between scenes from this rela
tionship are flashbacks from William's child
hood. His parents divorced when he was very
young and the last time he saw his father was
when he was 7 years old. William feels the pain of
growing up without his father keenly.
There are some corny moments, some mo
ments of solemnity, some of absurdity and some
of absolute hilarity. And everything rings true.
Hawke understands relationships.
"It's the story of a young man who places all
his identity—" Hawke tried to sum up his book
but cut himself off, searching for the right words
and muttered resentfully, "This is one of those
'in 20 words or less' things." He paused and ad
mitted, "It needs to be late at night for me to dis
cuss that intelligently at all." After another pause,
he seemed to have found more appropriate
words. "It's about finding some sense of self
from the relationships we have with people."
Hawke was on a roll but cut himself off again and
gave up with exasperation, "I don't know — read

the book!"
And you should. Hawke creates quirky char
acters, but keeps them believable. William
wears a dress one moment, takes the Concord
the next (see sidebar), complains about his con
tacts and then sleeps with three women in two
weeks. Sarah is somewhat pudgy — this is a
turn-on for William — and has some problems
with intimacy. Put them together and you get
quite a pair.
Here's a little taste: early on during the break
up phase of their relationship, William starts
howling at Sarah's apartment window.

When Sarah walked out she was
wearing a bright-red rain jacket with a
hood. I could tell she was pissed.
"Oh come on," 1 said to her scowling
expression. Still holding the fluorescent
orange cone, I pointed to my tuxedo.
"How do you like my outfit?... It smy
'I'm sorry' outfit."
"It's nice. Why are you wearing it?"
she asked, immediately beginning to
walk down the sidewalk.
"Because I'm sorry."
"Look, I have to go to work," she said.
I know. Can I walk you?"
It was a cool November morning, and
we both had hair that was still damp
from the shower. She didn't have any
stockings on and her legs were all pink
and prickly. So was her face. The cold
light made her eyes look fiercely green. I
wondered again if she was Irish. I
couldn't believe that I didn't know.
"Are you Irish?" I asked.
"What?" she asked. She wis walking
with purpose.
"Nothing," I said. "Okay, so here's
the deal. I'll do the talking, all right? Be
cause I have some things to say and be
cause you don't look particularly talka
tive. Not that you don't look good, be
cause you do. That's why I asked the
thing about if you were Irish. . .
The whole Irish thing. I couldn't
help but ask if he has a thing for Irish
girls. In response he explained that
Sarah "is based on my sister. I admire
a lot of qualities about her. I'm not
sleeping with my sister or anything!"
he laughed, "It's just that you learn a
lot about the opposite sex from your
siblings."
Hawke said that the book came
from "a collection of short stories and
it just kind of evolved into what it is."
I le worked on it off and on for three
and a half years and wrote wherever
he happened to be. And how did he
find time to write an entire novel?
"Being an actor, you have these long
stays of unemployment, when the
phone doesn't ring," he explained.
Hawke said he would be disap
pointed if he didn't publish anymore
books and is working on something
right now. "I'm always working on
different things and just see what it
amounts to," he said.
With so much going on with his
multiple careers, it's hard to imagine
what Hawke would do if he just had
some free time. Hawke seemed to find
this hard to imagine too.

"I'd go eat something. I don't know.
Am I in San Francisco?"
"Wherever you want," I said. This seemed
like a new idea for him.
"I'd go to a museum. It depends if I have any
friends around," he said with an abashed laugh,
"If I do, if something groovy's going on I'd find
out what it is and go do it. I can't believe that I
just used the word 'groovy!' " he exclaimed with
embarrassment, then burst out with, "What
would you do?" I admitted that I would catch up
on some sleep. "Yeah, me too. Sleep," still not
sounding entirely comfortable with his answer.

Hawke may be doubtful about what occupies
his down time, but he is clear on the motivation
that drives his otherwise busy life. "There's a
preschool down the street from my house and
[the kids] scream and holler. That gets me out of
the bed in the morning. They scream 'Look at
me! Look at me!' That's what I've been doing my
whole life."
When asked if he had anything else to add to
the interview, he replied, "That's all. 1 don't have
any sage wisdom for the world, you know? I just
go about my business." Given a little more time
to think, he changed his mind and said simply,
"This too shall pass."
