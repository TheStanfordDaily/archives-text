# Ethan Hawke gets random
## 
### Catherine Quinones 
Read "The Hottest State,"and you'll know
why the first couple of questions were asked.
Have you ever taken the Concord?
Yeah, a bunch of times.
What's it like?
It goes really fast. I don't really like trav
eling so I'll spend more money than I have to
spend less time doing it.
Have you ever worn a dress?
No.
What's your favorite piece of clothing?
A T-shirt that I wore in "Buried Child."
"Buried Child" is a Sam Shepard play Hawke
performed with Steppenwolf Theater. I
swiped it when the production was over.
What's your favorite play?
I like Tennessee Williams and Chekov in
general. He explains that he played Tom in
"The Glass Menagerie" during high school
He says he also enjoyed a Steppenwolf produc
tion of "The Grapes of Wrath." Finally he set
tles on "Waiting for Godot." Why? It's just
perfect.
Can you dance?
You know it.
What can you do?
No, see, the question is 'What CANT I
do?' He laughs. You can see a few of his moves
in "Gattaca" with Uma Thurman.
You're going to work on a movie, and
you've got your pick of directors. Who
would you pick?
Stanley Kubrick.
Even if it takes 400 days?
Yeah, I wouldn't care... Woody Allen,
Spike Lee â€” if Spike Lee ever had need of a
white guy.
