## The 						Playful Genius An exhibit of Alexander Colder at the San Jose Museum of Art 
### Vanessa Stich 
Alexander Calder once declared, "I want to
make things that are fun to look at, that have no
propaganda value whatsoever." His new show at
the San Jose Museum of Art, tided "Flying
Colors: The Innovation and Artistry of Alexander
Calder," demonstrates that he has realized this
goal.
Calder, now counted among the seminal fig
ures in American sculpture, was a serious artist.
Yet, the very power and vibrancy of his work flow
from its joyful refusal of the serious. His art is im
portant because it eschews the dogmatic and the
pedantic for the playful and the happy. It fully re
jects political or social rhetoric, reminding us of
the simple wonder of sight.
Calder's work—from his floating mobiles to
his colorful prints — expresses a child-like fasci
nation with the forms of the natural world. In
"Fronton," a lithograph from 1965, Calder jux
taposes basic thick black lines with primary-col
ored shapes: a black spiral, a red circle, a blue
and yellow arc. These are all familiar motifs, the
forms that we see repeated again and again in art
and life, yet Calder has renewed their vitality.
"Fronton" displays a vivid palette and balanced
composition that inspires us to re-evaluate their
meaning and find new beauty in these old
shapes.
Calder also utilizes primary colors and fun
damental shapes in his three-dimensional, sus
pended mobiles. Trained as an engineer, Calder
invented the ground-breaking mobiles in the
19305, noting that "art was too static to reflect
our world of movement."
These floating creations earned Calder his
greatest acclaim and are indeed the most com
pelling manifestations of his fanciful vision.
Constructed primarily of steel wire and plating,
these mobiles liberate and enliven Calder's visu
al elements, which allows the mobiles to sway
and move with their own energy. They are no
longer confined to a flat pictorial plane or a sta
tic sculpture.
The incredible genius and beauty of these
mobiles is epitomized in "Roxbury Flurry"
(1948), a banging assemblage of small, white
steel disks diffused over a large space. Delicate

and ethereal, "Roxbury Flurry" also evokes a
sense of nature: perhaps it is a flurry of snow, a
constellation of stars, sparks of light falling to
earth. It conjures up all of these images simulta
neously, yet it is ultimately abstract. It has its
own life, its own meaning beyond mere repre
sentation.
The longer we spend with "Roxbury Flurry"
and the other mobiles, the more completely we
come to understand Calder's great gift. These
objects are ever-changing: each moment offers a
new angle, a new experience. As the mobiles ro
tate, we can observe the subtle effect of our own
breathe and movement on their motion. They
are responsive, registering the external world in
their rhythmic swaying. We identify with these
pieces as living creatures, finding a physical and
emotional connection to them.
Calder's vast creativity was not confined to
the mobile medium. "Flying Colors" also in
cludes three "stabiles" — huge stationary con
structions of painted steel plate. Whereas the

mobiles dance lightly in the air, these black sta
biles are firmly anchored to the ground.
Nonetheless, the stabiles also possess a sense of
life and a grace that defies their bulk.
"Seven-foot Beastie," for example, reminds
us more of an undulating sea anemone or the
fanning petals of a flower than a hulking mon
ster. Like the mobiles, its appearance also
changes as we move around it: "Beastie" is sta
ble, but not inert.
Both "Beastie" and "Roxbury Flurry" hint at
Calder's whimsical side. At other moments in
"Flying Colors," however, this whimsy turns to
downright comedy, with wonderful results. One
of the triumphs of the show is the aptly titled
"Toilet Paper Flolder," a wire bathroom fixture
in the shape of a bird. This work demonstrates
Calder's mastery of wire, but more importantly,
it evinces the joy of the constructive process.
Calder clearly didn't take himself too seriously.
Fun is also the focal point of "Chock" (1972),
a flying chicken made of an old tin can. Open
mouthed and squawking, this gangling red bird
embodies a crazy kind of freedom. The can's
label, "chock full of nuts," amplifies the work's

playfulness, implying that eccentricity may be
the best path to happiness.
Unfortunately, much of the freedom that
Calder releases in his works is constrained by
their poor presentation in the SJMOA gallery.
The two rooms of the show have been divided
by several partitions, which limits the space
given to the large mobiles and stabiles. In many
cases, the assemblages have been pressed awk
wardly against the walls, reducing our view to a
single perspective. This is certainly not the way
in which Calder's pieces were meant to be seen,
and it is frustrating to have your experience
with his art mediated by an outside force.
Moreover, the gallery is crowded by an excess
of written commentary and photo-documen
tation on Calder's life. Panels of text are
directly behind several mobiles and .1 video of
Calder's circus performance blares out inces
santly. These additions, while vaguely interest
ing, distract from what should be the definitive
focus of the exhibition: (heart itself.
In spite of these problems, "Flying Colors"
remains a very engaging show. Calder's work is
able to hold its own, transcending its sorry set
ting. Calder's fascination with the world is con
tagious, and his essential happiness pervades
the exhibition space.
"Flying Colors" may not warrant a trip to San
Jose, but if you find yourself there and can ig
nore the problems of presentation, the light
headedness of the exhibit is a refreshing change
from the usual gravity of modern art.
