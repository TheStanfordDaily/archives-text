# Gaieties:
## "Not just a show — a CATHARSIS!" 
### Wenhsin Lee 
For a minute I'm not sure
whether sophomore Jennifer
Chau is still in acting mode while
I interview her; after ali, I did pull
her out after an intense song and
dance routine. She repeats this
statement several times to me,
even suggesting, or rather stating,
that it should be my lead sen
tence. Chau shouts out her line to
everyone that passes by, "Gai
eties: not just a show — a
CATHARSIS." Instead of looking
at her strangely, they readily
agree.
And so begins my main ques
tion — Gaieties: a catharsis of
what? Listening to participants
from all aspects of the produc
tion, I learn that it is a catharsis
on every level, from writing the
show last spring to putting to
gether the set several weeks ago.
Gaieties is put on every year
before Big Game by Ram's Head,
Stanford's student-run theatrical
society. Now in its 76th year, Gai
eties has changed immensely in
the past decades. Starting out as a
Big Game rally called "The Foot
ball Follies," the show used to
contain no real plot or purpose.
In the past couple years, writers
have tried to piece together a co
hesive plot, making the show
more interesting.
According to head writer Matt
Pearl, "Lach new group of writers
have a different vision, even
though you are making fun of the
same institutions." Last spring, a
group of nine writers met twice a
week to brainstorm ideas for this
year's show. Their purpose was to
find a diverse group of characters
that represented the Stanford
community and bring those char
acters out onto paper.
"Gaieties is basically a big
Stanford inside joke; it is an initi

ation into the humor of Stanford.
Hut I didn't want to gear it only to
the freshmen; 1 wanted to include
jokes that everyone could relate
to and understand. When I was
writing this script 1 did not want
to be hindered by anything,"
Pearl said.
Mugging for the crowd
In September, director Holly
Crafts had the script in her mind
as shie watched hopeful actresses
and actors parade on MemAud
stage to show off their talents. "In
auditions, I was typecasting for a
certain look, and in one moment
1 could tell that a person was per
fect for a part. I had a vision of
each part in mind, and my next
step was to fill out the script with
flesh and voice," she said.
The auditions process began
with a five-page application, each
page a separate application for
various department leaders.
Questions ran the gamut of the
relevant to the random, including
one question that asked, "Pretend
that you are taking a bubble bath
in Uruguay; you suddenly have
the urge to sing. Why?"
After filling out the applica
tion, aspiring Gaieties thespians
spent two hours learning a dance
routine and performing it,
singing a song of their own
choice, telling a joke and doing a
few cold readings and improvisa
tional activities.
"There is definitely a 'Gaieties'
type of person. We look for peo
ple who love to get up on stage
and make people laugh. The 'Gai
eties' person is really energetic
and excited about getting on
stage," said Asst. Director Nathan
Vaynard.
Freshman Jacob Klein, who
claims that he has "a voice to
make children cry," belted out
"Who am I?" from Les Miser

ables. He said that he had little ex
perience in acting and that his
main stage for showcasing his tal
ents was entertaining 6-year-olds
as a camp counselor. Neverthe
less, Klein was called back to au
dition a second time and made
the cast.
Despite the intimidation of
performing on MemAud stage in
front of complete strangers, Klein
found his auditioning experience
fun and enjoyable. "Since most of
the staff has been in Gaieties be
fore, we try to make it as fun as we
can," Vaynard said.
Klein soon found his place
among his fellow Gaieties per
formers, claiming, "The cast is
the largest collection of freaks

I've ever seen, and I feel right at
home." Undoubtedly, Klein will
remember this experience not
only for the six weeks of intense
rehearsal, but also for the unique
group of people involved in every
step of the production.
"We are such a compact group
— a very supportive group. We
don't just work together; we hang
out after rehearsal and during
breaks. It's a great atmosphere.
Not only that, but the direction
from all three sides is supportive
and encouraging — the acting,
the singing and the dancing," he
said.
Though many Stanford stu
dents may hear disconcerting ru
mors about the Gaieties group,
Klein said that the cast is like the
4-H club on stage. "We are a
wholesome group — none of
those group orgies that people
talk about," he joked.
Having spent six nights a
week rehearsing for six weeks,
Klein is known in his hall as "the
guy who is never in.' "Gaieties is
such a huge time commitment. I
teel like it is all worth it, but I
know I'll be making up for this
by backpacking in Green Library
for the rest of the quarter," Klein
said.
In for the long haul
Many Stanford students claim
that one's Stanford experience is
not complete without watching
Gaieties. For junior Adriennc
Watt, seeing Gaieties in her
freshman year inspired her to try
out the following year. "I was so
intimidated, but I knew that I
just had to try out. It has really
been the best part of my Stanford
experience so far," Watt said.
This year is Watt's second
year as an actress in Gaieties,
and she credited her choice to
come back with the intense expe

rience she had last year.
"Last year's group was so close
that many of them decided to
come back again this year. This
year's group is incredible. At re
hearsal I sit in awe of how funny
these people are. I think we really
bounce off each other's energy;
when you are with such a hilari
ous group of people, you can t
help but have fun. After a hard
day of academics, it's great to

come to rehearsal and just laugh,"
she said.
While Watt claimed that she
was always an outgoing person,
she said she believes that Gaieties
has made her even more open to
people. "Gaieties liberates your
freaky and zany side. I think that I
was somewhat serious in high
school, but Gaieties has made me
realize that I am funnier than 1
thought 1 was. Sometimes I come
back from rehearsal with so much
energy that people step back and
say, 'Whoo, Adrienne — you're
still in Gaieties mode.' I think the
people at Gaieties act with no fa
cades; they make me realize that
people should be themselves and
that they are hilarious when they
are themselves."
According the Watt, the center
of Gaieties is based on collabora
tion and teamwork. "This is not
about who the stars of the show
are; it's about giving each actor
and actress an outlet for his or her
talent. Gaieties is a synthesis of
everyone's own unique style."
Watt pointed out that the di
rectors look for special talents
during the auditions, including
crazy human tricks, accents and
imitations. One of Watt's special
talents is the ability to speed read
out loud, a talent that she thinks
was her ticket into the Gaieties
cast.
Although she believes that she
will not be acting in Gaieties next
year because of the time commit
ment, Watt said she knows that
she will suffer from post-Gaieties
withdrawal. "Last year, we had a
Gaieties e-mail list that people
constantly wrote to throughout
the year with messages like, 'I
miss all of you.' There's some
thing about the intensity of
spending six weeks with people in
a close environment that brings
people together. You spend
everyday together, and all of a

sudden they're not there any
more," she said.
Despite having acted in Gai
eties last year, Watt said she is still
excited about first walking on
stage this year. "Acting on the
MemAud stage is such a big rush.
Last year I walked out and the
every seat was filled — I can't wait
to walk out again this year. What
we really do on stage is just have
fun with each other, have fun
with the show."
No experience necessary
According to Crafts, Gaieties
helps introduce people to liking
Stanford. "When you see Gaieties
as a freshman, it helps with the
transition to Stanford. We're not
high drama; we're popular the
ater," she said.
Crafts also explained that in
the future when she thinks of her

Stanford experience, she will au
tomatically think of Gaieties.
"Every fall quarter, I live, sleep
and breathe Gaieties. Actually,
part of the reason i stayed at Stan
ford was because I got involved in
Gaieties; it gave me a venue to be
the freak show that I am," she
said.
This year, Crafts is working
with her best friend to direct the
show. She hired Vaynard as assis
tant director last spring, and he
has worked closely with her
throughout the year. "Nathan
and I are an amazing team," she
said. "That is what Gaieties is all
about — a team effort."
The directors claim that the
Gaieties motto is 'No experience
necessary.' Asst. manager Steven
Aronowitz agreed. "None of us
really know what we're doing. It's
a sink-or-swim process, and
everyday I learn something new
about theater."
Producer Jennie Caleshu said
that the most incredible aspect of
Gaieties is the student collabora
tion that creates the show.
"Where else can you find a com
pletely student-run production
that is so popular? Gaieties is a
show made from scratch. Every
aspect of the show is created by

students. It is really the embodi
ment of Stanford spirit and entre
preneurship," Caleshu said.
The Gaieties 27 member staff
tries to involve the actors and ac
tresses in other aspects of the
show, including building the set.
"On weekends, the cast helped to
paint the set, which really bridged
the technical side of the show and
the acting side," said Crafts.
With 'Twelfth Night' perfor
mances this past weekend, the
technical crew has had to work es
pecially hard this year.
"The tech crew pulled an all
nighter on Saturday to take down
the 'Twelfth Night' set so we
could begin setting up. The work
they have put into building the set
is incredible," said sophomore
David Chen, now in his second
year as an actor in Gaieties.
Sophomore Mandy Khosh
nevisan said that working in this
year's Gaieties has made her real
ize how amazing the production
is and how much work goes into
making the show. "Acting in Gai
eties this year has given me much
more respect for the people who
worked in last vear's (iaieties
You begin to see how a solely stu
dent produced show comes to
gether," she said.

It's all about tun
This year's show is not the
100 th Gaieties, but Aronowit/
said he believes that the show will
be commemorative because of
the spirit of the audience. "I think
that the audience will change the
show — they will be bringing the
energy and excitement of the
100 th Big Game," he said.
Caleshu said that ticket sales
are extremely high this year, and
many alumni are calling for tick
ets. "Peoplecall and tell me, 'I was
in Gaieties when I went to Stan
ford, it was such a great experi
ence!' We often read about local
actors and actresses who talk
about their Stanford Gaieties ex
perience in newspaper articles."
Not only is Gaieties a Stanford
tradition before Big Game, but it
is also the main fund-raiser lor
Ram's Head, bankrolling the or
ganization for the rest ol the year
According to Grafts, "Without
Gaieties, we wouldn't be able to
produce winter one acts and our

spring show."
This year, Gaieties claims to be
'The Usual Gaieties,' but Caleshu
said that she thinks this title is
ironic. " This year's (iaieties has a
cohesive plot; it includes smart
humor. It's not just the usual
'Heat Cal' motif," she said
Aronowitz agreed. "This show
works on many different levels
social satire, silly humor and trass
physical humor."
Every year, Gaieties repeats
some of those diehard traditions,
including showcase perfor
mances from several of Stanford's
finest. "Where else can you find
President Casper doing the Mac
erena'" said Chau. This year also
marks the last performance of
Vice Provost of Student Affairs
lames Montoya.
While the (iaieties tradition is
to make fun of UC—Berkeley,
Aronowitz said that the show al
lows Stanford students to admit
that the rivalry with Cal is all in
fun "The best part of (iaieties is
that we can joke about this rivalry
and even make fun of ourselves
That's what Stanford students
love best — being able to poke
fun at ourselves in a way that only
we can understand."

as a camp counselor. Neverthe
less, Klein was called back to au
dition a second time and made
the cast.
Despite the intimidation of
performing on MemAud stage in
front of complete strangers, Klein
found his auditioning experience
fun and enjoyable. "Since most of
the staff has been in Gaieties be
fore, we try to make it as fun as we
can," Vaynard said.
Klein soon found his place
among his fellow Gaieties per
formers, claiming, "The cast is
the largest collection of freaks

I've ever seen, and I feel right at
home." Undoubtedly, Klein will
remember this experience not
only for the six weeks of intense
rehearsal, but also for the unique
group of people involved in every
step of the production.
"We are such a compact group
— a very supportive group. We
don't just work together; we hang
out after rehearsal and during
breaks. It's a great atmosphere.
Not only that, but the direction
from all three sides is supportive
and encouraging — the acting,
the singing and the dancing," he
said.
Though many Stanford stu
dents may hear disconcerting ru
mors about the Gaieties group,
Klein said that the cast is like the
4-H club on stage. "We are a
wholesome group — none of
those group orgies that people
talk about," he joked.
Having spent six nights a
week rehearsing for six weeks,
Klein is known in his hall as "the
guy who is never in.' "Gaieties is
such a huge time commitment. I
teel like it is all worth it, but I
know I'll be making up for this
by backpacking in Green Library
for the rest of the quarter," Klein
said.
In for the long haul
Many Stanford students claim
that one's Stanford experience is
not complete without watching
Gaieties. For junior Adriennc
Watt, seeing Gaieties in her
freshman year inspired her to try
out the following year. "I was so
intimidated, but I knew that I
just had to try out. It has really
been the best part of my Stanford
experience so far," Watt said.
This year is Watt's second
year as an actress in Gaieties,
and she credited her choice to
come back with the intense expe

rience she had last year.
"Last year's group was so close
that many of them decided to
come back again this year. This
year's group is incredible. At re
hearsal I sit in awe of how funny
these people are. I think we really
bounce off each other's energy;
when you are with such a hilari
ous group of people, you can t
help but have fun. After a hard
day of academics, it's great to

come to rehearsal and just laugh,"
she said.
While Watt claimed that she
was always an outgoing person,
she said she believes that Gaieties
has made her even more open to
people. "Gaieties liberates your
freaky and zany side. I think that I
was somewhat serious in high
school, but Gaieties has made me
realize that I am funnier than 1
thought 1 was. Sometimes I come
back from rehearsal with so much
energy that people step back and
say, 'Whoo, Adrienne — you're
still in Gaieties mode.' I think the
people at Gaieties act with no fa
cades; they make me realize that
people should be themselves and
that they are hilarious when they
are themselves."
According the Watt, the center
of Gaieties is based on collabora
tion and teamwork. "This is not
about who the stars of the show
are; it's about giving each actor
and actress an outlet for his or her
talent. Gaieties is a synthesis of
everyone's own unique style."
Watt pointed out that the di
rectors look for special talents
during the auditions, including
crazy human tricks, accents and
imitations. One of Watt's special
talents is the ability to speed read
out loud, a talent that she thinks
was her ticket into the Gaieties
cast.
Although she believes that she
will not be acting in Gaieties next
year because of the time commit
ment, Watt said she knows that
she will suffer from post-Gaieties
withdrawal. "Last year, we had a
Gaieties e-mail list that people
constantly wrote to throughout
the year with messages like, 'I
miss all of you.' There's some
thing about the intensity of
spending six weeks with people in
a close environment that brings
people together. You spend
everyday together, and all of a

sudden they're not there any
more," she said.
Despite having acted in Gai
eties last year, Watt said she is still
excited about first walking on
stage this year. "Acting on the
MemAud stage is such a big rush.
Last year I walked out and the
every seat was filled — I can't wait
to walk out again this year. What
we really do on stage is just have
fun with each other, have fun
with the show."
No experience necessary
According to Crafts, Gaieties
helps introduce people to liking
Stanford. "When you see Gaieties
as a freshman, it helps with the
transition to Stanford. We're not
high drama; we're popular the
ater," she said.
Crafts also explained that in
the future when she thinks of her

Stanford experience, she will au
tomatically think of Gaieties.
"Every fall quarter, I live, sleep
and breathe Gaieties. Actually,
part of the reason i stayed at Stan
ford was because I got involved in
Gaieties; it gave me a venue to be
the freak show that I am," she
said.
This year, Crafts is working
with her best friend to direct the
show. She hired Vaynard as assis
tant director last spring, and he
has worked closely with her
throughout the year. "Nathan
and I are an amazing team," she
said. "That is what Gaieties is all
about — a team effort."
The directors claim that the
Gaieties motto is 'No experience
necessary.' Asst. manager Steven
Aronowitz agreed. "None of us
really know what we're doing. It's
a sink-or-swim process, and
everyday I learn something new
about theater."
Producer Jennie Caleshu said
that the most incredible aspect of
Gaieties is the student collabora
tion that creates the show.
"Where else can you find a com
pletely student-run production
that is so popular? Gaieties is a
show made from scratch. Every
aspect of the show is created by

students. It is really the embodi
ment of Stanford spirit and entre
preneurship," Caleshu said.
The Gaieties 27 member staff
tries to involve the actors and ac
tresses in other aspects of the
show, including building the set.
"On weekends, the cast helped to
paint the set, which really bridged
the technical side of the show and
the acting side," said Crafts.
With 'Twelfth Night' perfor
mances this past weekend, the
technical crew has had to work es
pecially hard this year.
"The tech crew pulled an all
nighter on Saturday to take down
the 'Twelfth Night' set so we
could begin setting up. The work
they have put into building the set
is incredible," said sophomore
David Chen, now in his second
year as an actor in Gaieties.
Sophomore Mandy Khosh
nevisan said that working in this
year's Gaieties has made her real
ize how amazing the production
is and how much work goes into
making the show. "Acting in Gai
eties this year has given me much
more respect for the people who
worked in last vear's (iaieties
You begin to see how a solely stu
dent produced show comes to
gether," she said.

It's all about tun
This year's show is not the
100 th Gaieties, but Aronowit/
said he believes that the show will
be commemorative because of
the spirit of the audience. "I think
that the audience will change the
show — they will be bringing the
energy and excitement of the
100 th Big Game," he said.
Caleshu said that ticket sales
are extremely high this year, and
many alumni are calling for tick
ets. "Peoplecall and tell me, 'I was
in Gaieties when I went to Stan
ford, it was such a great experi
ence!' We often read about local
actors and actresses who talk
about their Stanford Gaieties ex
perience in newspaper articles."
Not only is Gaieties a Stanford
tradition before Big Game, but it
is also the main fund-raiser lor
Ram's Head, bankrolling the or
ganization for the rest ol the year
According to Grafts, "Without
Gaieties, we wouldn't be able to
produce winter one acts and our

spring show."
This year, Gaieties claims to be
'The Usual Gaieties,' but Caleshu
said that she thinks this title is
ironic. " This year's (iaieties has a
cohesive plot; it includes smart
humor. It's not just the usual
'Heat Cal' motif," she said
Aronowitz agreed. "This show
works on many different levels
social satire, silly humor and trass
physical humor."
Every year, Gaieties repeats
some of those diehard traditions,
including showcase perfor
mances from several of Stanford's
finest. "Where else can you find
President Casper doing the Mac
erena'" said Chau. This year also
marks the last performance of
Vice Provost of Student Affairs
lames Montoya.
While the (iaieties tradition is
to make fun of UC—Berkeley,
Aronowitz said that the show al
lows Stanford students to admit
that the rivalry with Cal is all in
fun "The best part of (iaieties is
that we can joke about this rivalry
and even make fun of ourselves
That's what Stanford students
love best — being able to poke
fun at ourselves in a way that only
we can understand."

Jeff Tabaco '99 and a puzzled Corinne Chapman '99 go over their parts.
For a minute I'm not sure
whether sophomore Jennifer
Chau is still in acting mode while
I interview her; after ali, I did pull
her out after an intense song and
dance routine. She repeats this
statement several times to me,
even suggesting, or rather stating,
that it should be my lead sen
tence. Chau shouts out her line to
everyone that passes by, "Gai
eties: not just a show — a
CATHARSIS." Instead of looking
at her strangely, they readily
agree.
And so begins my main ques
tion — Gaieties: a catharsis of
what? Listening to participants
from all aspects of the produc
tion, I learn that it is a catharsis
on every level, from writing the
show last spring to putting to
gether the set several weeks ago.
Gaieties is put on every year
before Big Game by Ram's Head,
Stanford's student-run theatrical
society. Now in its 76th year, Gai
eties has changed immensely in
the past decades. Starting out as a
Big Game rally called "The Foot
ball Follies," the show used to
contain no real plot or purpose.
In the past couple years, writers
have tried to piece together a co
hesive plot, making the show
more interesting.
According to head writer Matt
Pearl, "Lach new group of writers
have a different vision, even
though you are making fun of the
same institutions." Last spring, a
group of nine writers met twice a
week to brainstorm ideas for this
year's show. Their purpose was to
find a diverse group of characters
that represented the Stanford
community and bring those char
acters out onto paper.
"Gaieties is basically a big
Stanford inside joke; it is an initi

ation into the humor of Stanford.
Hut I didn't want to gear it only to
the freshmen; 1 wanted to include
jokes that everyone could relate
to and understand. When I was
writing this script 1 did not want
to be hindered by anything,"
Pearl said.
Mugging for the crowd
In September, director Holly
Crafts had the script in her mind
as shie watched hopeful actresses
and actors parade on MemAud
stage to show off their talents. "In
auditions, I was typecasting for a
certain look, and in one moment
1 could tell that a person was per
fect for a part. I had a vision of
each part in mind, and my next
step was to fill out the script with
flesh and voice," she said.
The auditions process began
with a five-page application, each
page a separate application for
various department leaders.
Questions ran the gamut of the
relevant to the random, including
one question that asked, "Pretend
that you are taking a bubble bath
in Uruguay; you suddenly have
the urge to sing. Why?"
After filling out the applica
tion, aspiring Gaieties thespians
spent two hours learning a dance
routine and performing it,
singing a song of their own
choice, telling a joke and doing a
few cold readings and improvisa
tional activities.
"There is definitely a 'Gaieties'
type of person. We look for peo
ple who love to get up on stage
and make people laugh. The 'Gai
eties' person is really energetic
and excited about getting on
stage," said Asst. Director Nathan
Vaynard.
Freshman Jacob Klein, who
claims that he has "a voice to
make children cry," belted out
"Who am I?" from Les Miser

ables. He said that he had little ex
perience in acting and that his
main stage for showcasing his tal
ents was entertaining 6-year-olds
as a camp counselor. Neverthe
less, Klein was called back to au
dition a second time and made
the cast.
Despite the intimidation of

and actress an outlet for his or her
talent. Gaieties is a synthesis of
everyone's own unique style."
Watt pointed out that the di
rectors look for special talents
during the auditions, including
crazy human tricks, accents and
imitations. One of Watt's special
talents is the ability to speed read
out loud, a talent that she thinks
was her ticket into the Gaieties
cast.
Although she believes that she
will not be acting in Gaieties next
year because of the time commit
ment, Watt said she knows that
she will suffer from post-Gaieties
withdrawal. "Last year, we had a
Gaieties e-mail list that people
constantly wrote to throughout
the year with messages like, 'I
miss all of you.' There's some
thing about the intensity of
spending six weeks with people in
a close environment that brings
people together. You spend
everyday together, and all of a

sudden they're not there any
more," she said.
Despite having acted in Gai
eties last year, Watt said she is still
excited about first walking on
stage this year. "Acting on the
MemAud stage is such a big rush.
Last year I walked out and the
every seat was filled — I can't wait
to walk out again this year. What
we really do on stage is just have
fun with each other, have fun
with the show."
No experience necessary
According to Crafts, Gaieties
helps introduce people to liking
Stanford. "When you see Gaieties
as a freshman, it helps with the
transition to Stanford. We're not
high drama; we're popular the
ater," she said.
Crafts also explained that in
the future when she thinks of her

Stanford experience, she will au
tomatically think of Gaieties.
"Every fall quarter, I live, sleep
and breathe Gaieties. Actually,
part of the reason i stayed at Stan
ford was because I got involved in
Gaieties; it gave me a venue to be
the freak show that I am," she
said.
This year, Crafts is working
with her best friend to direct the
show. She hired Vaynard as assis
tant director last spring, and he
has worked closely with her
throughout the year. "Nathan
and I are an amazing team," she
said. "That is what Gaieties is all
about — a team effort."
The directors claim that the
Gaieties motto is 'No experience
necessary.' Asst. manager Steven
Aronowitz agreed. "None of us
really know what we're doing. It's
a sink-or-swim process, and
everyday I learn something new
about theater."
Producer Jennie Caleshu said
that the most incredible aspect of
Gaieties is the student collabora
tion that creates the show.
"Where else can you find a com
pletely student-run production
that is so popular? Gaieties is a
show made from scratch. Every
aspect of the show is created by

students. It is really the embodi
ment of Stanford spirit and entre
preneurship," Caleshu said.
The Gaieties 27 member staff
tries to involve the actors and ac
tresses in other aspects of the
show, including building the set.
"On weekends, the cast helped to
paint the set, which really bridged
the technical side of the show and
the acting side," said Crafts.
With 'Twelfth Night' perfor
mances this past weekend, the
technical crew has had to work es
pecially hard this year.
"The tech crew pulled an all
nighter on Saturday to take down
the 'Twelfth Night' set so we
could begin setting up. The work
they have put into building the set
is incredible," said sophomore
David Chen, now in his second
year as an actor in Gaieties.
Sophomore Mandy Khosh
nevisan said that working in this
year's Gaieties has made her real
ize how amazing the production
is and how much work goes into
making the show. "Acting in Gai
eties this year has given me much
more respect for the people who
worked in last vear's (iaieties
You begin to see how a solely stu
dent produced show comes to
gether," she said.

It's all about tun
This year's show is not the
100 th Gaieties, but Aronowit/
said he believes that the show will
be commemorative because of
the spirit of the audience. "I think
that the audience will change the
show — they will be bringing the
energy and excitement of the
100 th Big Game," he said.
Caleshu said that ticket sales
are extremely high this year, and
many alumni are calling for tick
ets. "Peoplecall and tell me, 'I was
in Gaieties when I went to Stan
ford, it was such a great experi
ence!' We often read about local
actors and actresses who talk
about their Stanford Gaieties ex
perience in newspaper articles."
Not only is Gaieties a Stanford
tradition before Big Game, but it
is also the main fund-raiser lor
Ram's Head, bankrolling the or
ganization for the rest ol the year
According to Grafts, "Without
Gaieties, we wouldn't be able to
produce winter one acts and our

spring show."
This year, Gaieties claims to be
'The Usual Gaieties,' but Caleshu
said that she thinks this title is
ironic. " This year's (iaieties has a
cohesive plot; it includes smart
humor. It's not just the usual
'Heat Cal' motif," she said
Aronowitz agreed. "This show
works on many different levels
social satire, silly humor and trass
physical humor."
Every year, Gaieties repeats
some of those diehard traditions,
including showcase perfor
mances from several of Stanford's
finest. "Where else can you find
President Casper doing the Mac
erena'" said Chau. This year also
marks the last performance of
Vice Provost of Student Affairs
lames Montoya.
While the (iaieties tradition is
to make fun of UC—Berkeley,
Aronowitz said that the show al
lows Stanford students to admit
that the rivalry with Cal is all in
fun "The best part of (iaieties is
that we can joke about this rivalry
and even make fun of ourselves
That's what Stanford students
love best — being able to poke
fun at ourselves in a way that only
we can understand."
