## Seven Mary Three and The Honeyrods at the Edge Bust out the flannel 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
It's been one long road trip for
Seven Mary Three. The group has
been touring since its first album, and
its music is reflective of the wandering
muse that it follows.
Seven Mary Three will soon make
a stop at the Hdge in Halo Alto with the
Honeyrods to promote its new album
"Rockcrown," an introspective collec
tion of dark, frustrated songs. For the
most part, the album showcases a
deep, soft sound that holds energy
The group has come a long way
since its meager beginnings as a col
lege rock band. Its unique form of
grunge rock continues feeding the
flames thai groups like Nirvana and
Pearl lam started burning in the early
19905.
Its first album, "Churn," was
released under an independent label
and was played extensively on an
()rlando radio station. Selling all 5,000
copies of that album led the group to
its first ina)or label debut, "American
Standard," on Mammoth Records.
Rapidly making its way up the
charts, the groups single
"Cumbersome" spurred "American
Standard" to hit number one on
Billboard's "Heatseekers" chart at the
end of 1995. This stint at number one
on the rock chart lasted five weeks into
the new year.
The group's new album, according
to singer lason Ross, is "about our
young lives in the last two years. It's
about four guys who have been
together for around five years playing
rock and roll music and having a ball
doing it. It's about a long, long road
trip."
The album is fairly fame compared
to what you may be used to from this
group, sporting only a few loud tradi
tional grunge songs. The rest are
thoughtful acoustic tracks, in which
the group runs through various emo
tional tones.
Ross goes overboard with yelling
on "1 lome Stretch" and capitalizing on
the fact that his notes indistin
guishable through a scratchy strained
voice. He sounds much better when
he's not trving so hard to sound angry,
but these loud tracks do allow you to
appreciate the rest of the album —
when he's not veiling.

"Player Piano" seems completely
out of place on this album. With its
upbeat, happy intonations, the song is
off-tone with the rest of the album,
and it is noticeable and appreciated as
a consequence.
Seven Mary Three should perform
a decent show, although it will be
toned-down from its regular signature
sound if much is played off of this
album.
The Honeyrods, who will open for
Seven Mary Three playing songs off its
self-titled album, should provide a fit
ting complement to the hard-grunge
gone-acoustic sound of the main
attraction.
The Honeyrods are fairly grunge
less in sound and move more toward
the rock-pop side of things, sporting
lots of U2-ish guitars and distorted
vocals. l"he band is versatile, though,
and finds room lor acousuc guitar, ska
Iwals and a bit of Blind Melon vocals.
This group has a lighter sound than
Seven Mary Ihree and consequently is
actually more fun to listen to. l"he
Honeyrods haven't tasted mega-suc
cess yet, and therefore band members
don't feel they have to take themselves
as seriously — the result is a bunch of
guys who are having lots of fun and
want people to know it.
"Love Bee" exemplifies this playful
ness in its upbeat rhythms and head
bobbing guitar chords, and "Soap
Opera" pokes fun at the notion of day
time TV stars and how people act like
them.
ITie members in The Honeyrods
capture happiness, forlornness and
frustration, and they seem content in
their playing. It may be worth going to
the concert just to check this group
out.
All in all, The Honevrods and
Seven Mary Three should bring down
the Edge on Sunday night. And if
things go well. The Honeyrods just
may end up stealing the show.
