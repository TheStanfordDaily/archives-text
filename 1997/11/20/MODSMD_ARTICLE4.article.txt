In comparison with last year's over
spending by then-ASSU President Bill
Shen, this year's ASSIJ leaders are well
within budget. Their main financial com
mitments, according to current president
Emily Andrus, are the course guides and
the "buck-a-bike" program, a service that
subsidizes student bike registration.
"I am committed to paying attention
to details and responsibly spending the
presidential budget only on events that
will benefit the Stanford community,"
Andrus said.
The office of the president is also try

ing to avoid unnecessary expenses. ASSI I
Vice President Hen Decker said, "This
year we are really trying hard to econo
mize bv cutting clown on overhead cxpen
ditures such as office supplies."

Shen went over bud
get by about $10,000
last year, while Andrus
and I )ecker have spent
close to $ 1.7(H), about
12 percent of their total
programming and pro
jects budget.
The total presiden-

tial budget for this year
is $2X.|(X). Out of this sum. half is a

worthwhile service and it sent out a
message about campus security
right at the beginning of the year."
At this year's first ASSU Senate
meeting, ASSU financial manager
Don Coleman outlined a plan to
keep tabs on spending in order to
avoid the problems of last year's ex
penditures.
One of the new policies for this
year is that before senators commit
to an expense, they must obtain ap
proval of their account holders. The
account holders are members the
ASSU Budget and Finance Com
mittee.
According to Coleman, "The
Budget and Finance Committee can
only disapprove projects if they are
not within limits. This committee
ensures that there is enough money
to be spent."
