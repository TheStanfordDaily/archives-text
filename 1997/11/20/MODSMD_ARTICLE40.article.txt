# Bridging generations: The Rolling Stones and Pearl Jam at The Oakland Coliseum
## 
### Soren Johnson Staff writer 
In 1964 and 1991, two musical rev
olutions saved rock and roll from a
world of saccharine pop music. While
the Beatles and Nirvana have always
been seen as the leaders of those two
movements, the Rolling Stones and
Pearl Jam are the most important sur
vivors of those times.
The strange similarities between
the latter two bands are striking. Few

groups have been able to
change their membership
as often and stay so success
ful. Both are seen as living
artifacts of a mvthologized
musical movement, a view
which each group has
fought for much of its
career.
Friday, Nov. 14, at the
Oakland Coliseum, these
two survivors united for a
truly unforgettable concert.
While Pearl Jam trimmed
its set down to conform to
the limitations of being an
"opening" act, its music was
a powerful testament to the
group members' ability to
perform together.
Starting with a strong
version of "Hail, Hail," the
group launched into a one
hour tour through its past.
Pearl lam played as if it had

something to prove, which
was probably true consid
ering the average age of the audience
was approximately 40.
In particular, "Even Flow" received
an inspired reading, including an
astonishing solo from guitarist Mike
McCready. The band appeared relaxed
throughout the concert; McCready
and Jeff Ament, the bassist, played
rock-paper-scissors during a quiet
moment of "Eyes Wide Open."
Eddie Vedder's vocals on "Better
Man" and "Black" were beautiful and
poignant. Indeed, Vedder seems to
have righted himself from the vocal
debacle of "Vitalogy." His voice has
always been the most distinct instru
ment of the band, and on "Last Exit"
and "Corduroy," the improved singing
rescued some previously forgettable
songs. Although Vedder still appeared
to be suffering from demonic posses
sion at times, he was also in an ami
able mood and even smiled from time
to time. Perhaps time really does heal

all wounds.
Time, however, is no longer on the
side of the Rolling Stones. Now the
butt of old-age jokes around the
world, the Stones are on a mission to
prove that rock and roll is about one s
heart, not one's age. Incredibly, the
group's members now meet that chal
lenge better than they have in years,
possibly since the days of "Some
Girls."
Richards' opening riff to
"Satisfaction" actually overshadowed

the exploding stage behind him. The
mind boggles at how many times the
group has performed that song in the
last 30 years, but the Stones made it
sound as fresh as its newer material.
The band played some impressive
material from its latest album,
"Bridges to Babylon." Most notably,
"Saint Of Me" and "Out Of Control"
were strong rockers that should take
proud places in the Stones' canon.
When interspersed with "Let's
Spend The Night Together" and "19th
Nervous Breakdown," the new music
demonstrated how much the song
writing talents of lagger and Richards
have developed over time. One won
ders whether in 20 years, Pearl Jam
will be performing music that makes
"Jeremy" sound quaint in compari
son.
Artistically, the night's peak came
with a powerful and beautiful version
of "Gimme Shelter," highlighted by

the gorgeous vocals of Lisa Fischer.
However, the most interesting
moment came when the band moved
to a smaller stage within the crowd.
From this tiny platform, the band
recreated the playing conditions that
the Stones left behind years ago. Mick
focused on singing instead of pranc
ing, and the instrumentation was
stripped down to basics. The group
played a set of straight-ahead rock
and roll, including a cover of the
Chuck Berry's classic "Little Queenie.'

The performances were
strong, refreshing the band for
the main stage finale.
The Stones also deliv
ered an ironic moment by
playing "Dead Flowers," a rare
concert selection. The song
was written as a criticism of
the Utopian fantasies of the
'60s, addressing the specter of
the deadly Altamont concert,
an event intimately connected
with Bay Area culture.
Were the Stones still
debating the responsibility for
the deaths that occurred? The
group never connected itself
with hippie culture as the
Beatles did, preferring to criti
cize from a distance. Time,
however, does heal wounds,
and perhaps the concert itself
was a gift to the Bay Area, per
haps even a plea for forgive
ness.

As the only three dates with
Pear! Jam opening, the
Oakland concerts are extraordinary
events. Indeed, they are the first time
Pearl lam has played at a non-charity,
Ticketmaster event since its legal bat
tle years ago, sacrificing a bit of its
own Utopian vision of self-promo
tion.
In fact, Pearl Jam's insistence on
maintaining this dream is perhaps
what separates them the most from
the Stones, who hardly ever enter
tained such a notion. Despite Pearl
Jam's "difficulties" with fame, the
band has inherited a populist
approach that originated in the San
Francisco hippie culture the Stones
have discounted.
Nonetheless, Pearl Jam is not
exactly blind to the world around
them. Vedder even joked that during
the next concert there would be "as
much rain as groupies at Altamont,"
showing that his group shares another
trait with the Stones, a love of irony.
