## Kettle Whistle Jane's Addiction 
### 
Damn cool. The "relapsed"
lane's Addiction is on the road tour
ing to support its new album, "Ket
tle Whistle."
I do feel a little strange saying
that. Not very much is new with
lane's Addiction: the personnel re
main the same with the exception of
new bassist Flea (original bassist
Eric Avery declined to rejoin the
band), and there are only four new
tracks on the new album.
And the sound? The same mind
blowing blend of acoustic and elec
tric poppy-yet-razor-edged an
tliemic rock that brought Perry Far
rell and crew to fame in the late
1980s. I mean that literally. The 11
live cuts, demos and studio outtakes
that fill up this album are from 1986,
'88, '89, '90 and '91.
It's difficult to combine live and
studio tracks on an album, but in
this case it works. The album has a
retrospective feel that comes from
nixtaposing the grinding rock of
"Whores" (live from 1986) with the
folksy acoustic "City" (live from
1988) with the slinky jazz-funk of
"My Cat's Name is Maceo" (1987
demo with additional recording in
1997).
"Kettle Whistle" starts with the
title track, an ethereal new trance
that proves that the new Jane s Ad
diction can write tunes as well as the
old Janes Addiction. But the ful
crum of the album is thelO-minute
long "Slow Divers," recorded live in
1986 and layered with overdubs
from the recent Jane's Addiction
sessions in Los Angeles.
Other highlights include a funky
1 989 outtake of "Been Caught Steal
ing" with Farrell scatting in place of
Navarro's ripping guitar solo and a
brilliant version of "Jane Says"from
Lollapalooza's 1991 kickofftour.
It may not be completely indica
tive of what the "relapsed" Jane's
Addiction sounds like, but "Kettle
Whisde" will not disappoint
