# Gipsy Legend
## Los Reyes 
### 
Take six iightning-fast guitarists, dip
them in a gypsy community in Aries in the
south of France, sprinkle them with Span
ish, French and North American ethnicity
and blend well.

Then let them age for five years, experi
menting with traditional and contemporary
musical accompaniment; they're bound to
produce an amazing CD. Case in point: Los
Reyes, with its newest album, "Gipsy Leg
end."
Related in style and in blood to the more
famous Gypsy Kings, Los Reyes distin
guishes itself by combining irresistible,
toe-tapping rhythm with lyrics that ad

dress contemporary as well as traditional
themes.
The six acoustic guitars of Los Reyes
strum along with an incredibly varied ac
companiment, including bass, keyboard,
trumpet, trombone and a wide range of per
cussion. Similar but less staccato than Fla
menco, the result doesn't fall under any pre
defined musical genre.
Unique, the style is European but exot
ic, neither old nor new, neither tame nor
wild.
The lyrics, which shift between Spanish,
French and English, (and which all have
English translations in the disc jacket) are

rich with emotion and imagery. In one of
the most romantic songs of the collection,
"Sabor Caramelo," the singer woos in Span
ish, "Your kisses of brown sugar / Are the
color of roses when I kiss them / You are the
grand love that I live for." Other song
themes include pregnancy, dance and social
concerns such as drunkenness, violence and
persecution.
With lyrics that stroke your emotions
and a danceable rhythm that threatens to
drag you from your seat, "Gipsy Legend" is
an enjoyable album that suits a wide range
of moods and tastes.
