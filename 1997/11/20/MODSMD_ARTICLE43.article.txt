# Around the Fur
## Deftones 
### 
Take the music of Rage
Against the Machine minus
the politics, throw in the
singing style of Tool and the
occasional angriness of Korn
and you get the Deftones.
The band's new album
"Around the Fur," follows this
pattern slowed down 10 per
cent. It is a very general pur
pose album with great poten
tial for parties, studying or
wallowing in depression.
Because I'm a fan of Korn,
Rage and Tool, the Deftones'
music calls to the sulking beast
of anger within me. Tracks like
"Dai the Flu" start out very
slow and melodic, abruptly
jump to angry, loud choruses
that keep you attentive, if
nothing else.
It doesn't matter which
track you listen to, because in
dividual songs lack cohesion.
If you take the album as one
70-minute song, though, it
contains enough variety with
in its distinctive style to avoid
excessive repetition.

The last track, "MX," is 30
minutes long with about 20
minutes of dead air in the mid
dle. Other than that, this
album has great shelf life. You
probably won't get to know
any one song well enough to
become bored with it.
"Lhabia," in particular, has
a great distinctive sound with
at least five different melodies
fighting each other to be
heard, and the vocals follow
the music surprisingly well.
The title track is the loudest
and most like earlier Deftones
songs.
On the whole, "Around the
Fur" will definitely spend
some time in my discman. It's
a perfect supplement while I'm
waiting for the next album
from the more mainstream
Korn or Tool. Perhaps the
Deftones will earn a place in
the halls of the "sad violence"
genre. The group has a great
start.
