# Zaireeka
## The
						Flaming Lips 
### 
The face of music is changing with
the help of The Flaming l ips. For the
first time on CD, the listener and the
musician can work together to create a
piece of music. The spirit of |ohn (lage
lives.
Here's how it works: "Zaireeka"
consists of four CM )s that you can play
AT THE SAME TIME. You get yourself
three other friends and four CI) play
ers. You each grab a (II), and one two
three-four of you all push 'play' simul
taneously.
"I loly shit!" was my reaction.
What the celluloid album gave to
the listener, the audio tape took away,
and the CD attempted to return.
Records allowed a listener the ability to
play a piece of music at a number of
speeds, to pick the song he or she was
going to play, to capitalize on the
record player by scratching.
Tapes made listening quicker. You
could bring your music with you and
choose whether or not to turn your
walkman off or put in half dead bat
teries. CDs got closer to the record
ideal. You could pick your tracks and
hall dead batteries.
"Zaireeka" lets you pick your tracks,
the fullness of your sound (you don't
have to play all four CDs), how in
synch the CDs are and which part is
most prominent. You are the I )|.
So what's the next step? buy the (>D
set. But make it even more yours. Play
three of the CDs and sing the fourth.
Play four different (II >s by four differ
ent artists. Take control of your music.
Make your music. Buy this album. If
not for the sound, for the experience.
