# Big Beat from Badsville
## The
						Cramps 
### 
Wh.it is'rockabilly' music? If the an
swer is "The Cramps" then I'm sorry I
asked.
"Big Beat From Badsville" is swanky,
swingin' down-home bluesy crap. The
exotic Poison Ivy, who poses on nearly all
of the group's covers, contributes more
to the group as a skin-flashing seductress
than as an actual guitar player. Ivy's rills
are slow, drab and toothless.
The baik cover of the album reads,
"Here, caught in the merciless coil of
their primitive passions, I'he Cramps are
driven to new highs and lows unimagin
able before." It is pretty hard to imagine a
group hitting lows deeper than the hot
toinless void of "Big Beat."
Singer Lux Interior comes across as a
cheap Elvis impersonator covering clas
sic Iggy Pop tunes in a Nashville karaoke
bar at 2 a.m., walking the fine line be
tween heaving his scrambled eggs on the
P.A. and alcohol poisoning.
Regardless, lew can deny that Interior
loves to sing songs with an almost fright
ening passion — he wails and rocks out
on every track, showing drunkards with
microphones young and old how it's
supposed to be done. Make no mistake,
he's the real deal.
I />ve 'em or leave 'em, you can't refute
the fact that The Cramps picked up an
utterly useless drummer in Harry
Drumdini, a grown man handling his
slicks like a two-year old with a plastic
hammer and a brand new snare drum.
Ugh. This album is guaranteed to leave a
bad taste in your mouth and an ache in
your gut.
