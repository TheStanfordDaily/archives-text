## The 						Jackal 
### 
With an intriguing storyline, a talented cast
and a huge budget, it would seem director
Michael Caton-Jones couldn't possibly go
wrong with "The Jackal;" but somehow, he
manages to do so. With flops like "Rob Roy"
and the half-baked "Doc Hollywood" under
his belt, "The Jackal" will do little to boost
Caton-Jones' reputation as a director.
Based on Kenneth Ross's 1973 screenplay,
"The Day of the Jackal," "I'he Jackal" clings
only loosely to the outlines of its older counter
part.
The story opens when the Jackal, a ruthless
assassin played by Bruce Willis, accepts a $70
million hit job from a wealthy Russian mobster.
His target is a top U.S. government official
whose identity remains unknown to the audi
ence for the majority of the film. When FBI
Deputy Director Carter Preston (Sidney Poiti
er) learns of the Jackal's mission, he enlists the
help of Russian Major Valentina Koslova
(Diane Venora) and political prisoner Declan
Mulqueen (Richard Cere). Together, the trio
launches an international manhunt for the
Jackal without knowing his timetable, target or
location.
Gere's character becomes increasingly inter
esting as the search turns personal and the life
of his old flame (Mathilda May) is threatened.

He falls comfortably into the courageous,
world-weary role of Mulqueen, though his
character's past is under-explained and his Irish
accent makes Brad Pitt sound like the Lucky
Charms leprechaun.
Also notable is Venora's portrayal of by-the
book Russian officer Koslova, whose bravery
and stability eventually have a profound im
pact on FBI Deputy Director Preston. In an era
where Alicia Silverstone is Hollywood's norm,
a Dana Scully or Koslova-type female lead can
add uniqueness to an otherwise typical sus
pense film.
Unfortunately, the strong performances of
Cere and Venora are dragged down by virtually
every other aspect of the movie. Seemingly un
easy in a villain's role, Willis gives an awkward
performance. With a slew of disguises that pale
in comparison to those in"The Saint," the Jack
al bounds from country to country with a dozen
hijackers and FBI agents on his back. His
clipped humor merges with horrific violence to
form an uncomfortably sadistic result.
Excessive, graphic violence is littered hap
hazardly throughout the film, and an ax mur
der in the first five minutes makes it clear that
"The Jackal" is not for the faint of heart. Deaths
are so graphic, frequent and random that they
only detract from the already meager plot. All

that really keeps the movie flowing is its sound
track, coordinated by Carter Burwell, which
boasts tunes from Prodigy, Bush and Ani
DiFranco.
As "The Jackal" veers arbitrarily from one
scene to the next, it seems to be searching for an
identity. The exploitation of Cold War stereo
types and Willis' on-scrcen smooch with a ho
mosexual White House official suggests vague

political undertones, but neither these, actual
humor, nor hard-core suspense ever rises to the
surface. The movie careens toward its gruesome
finish until most of the interesting characters
have been killed, most of the standard suspense
movie lines have been recited, and most of the
audience is fed up with plot twists that require
leaps of logic far too large to be forgivable.
