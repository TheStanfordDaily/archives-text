# The 						Wings of the Dove
## 
### 
Following in the oh-so-British footsteps
of lane Austen, Henry James is hot stuff on
the screen right now. So much for giant
alien bugs and the trials of the genetic elite;
the newest jamesian flick, "The Wings of

the Dove," shows that early 20th-century
class tension, sex, corruption and love
laced into a corset are where it's at.
But to leave "The Wings of the Dove" at
that would be to sell it drastically short.

While the love triangle plot of the film ex
ploits those four qualities and makes doing
so look beautiful, the characters of
"Wings" have more to show for the frailty
of humanity than the corruption of it.
Kate Croy (Helena Bonham Carter,
"Howards End") has just been taken in by
her wealthy Aunt Maude after the death of
her mother. While the world of soirees and
aristocrats is dazzling, it is not enthralling
enough to keep her from remaining deeply
in love with Merton Densher (Linus
Roache, "Priest") a "common" journalist.
Unfortunately for Kate, Aunt Maude is
supporting Kate's addicted-to-everything
father, and she has made it clear that she
can either be happy and poor with the love
of her life or devastatingly rich and mar
ried to a boorish aristocrat.
lust as Kate reaches her saturation point
of secret meetings in parks and the frus
trating reality that she can never have the
best of both worlds — a setback that
doesn't bother Merton in the least — Mil
lie Theale (Allison Elliot, "The Spitfire
Grill") arrives on the scene.
Millie is harmlessly flirtatious, Ameri
can and rich. In Millie, Kate finds a friend
who craves modernity as much as she, as
she discovers when Millie, without a hint
of Victorianism, remarks frankly that Mer
ton "is beautiful."

Kate also discovers that Millie, like her
self, has something to hide from the upper
crusts — she is dying. And she wants no
one to pity her for it.
As the three depart for Venice, Kate sees
in Millie's problem an answer to her own
— marry off Merton to Millie, wait for
Millie to die and save herself and her father
from the gilt-edged clutches of her aunt.
What results is a spiral of visual and
verbal deceits, metaphors and contradic
tions. Director lain Softly ("Backbeat")
creates a 1910 that straddles the constric
tive Victorian era and the more relaxed
early 20th-century with both ease and
confusion, mirroring the psychological
games the characters play and trap one an
other in. While the cinematography bathes
pale faces, sumptuous costumes and state
ly homes in rich colors and soft light, the
script reveals dark, marred depths far un
like the surface.
Between the stodginess of London and
the sensuality of Venice, ties between Kate,
Merton and Millie are fused, warped and
broken in the sweetest and most painful of
ways. Though the film is a marked depar
ture from the classic novel, perhaps Henry
James could have imagined "The Wings of
the Dove" like this — because the play of it
all is far too captivating to ignore.
