The concept behind the new Bill Murray
flick, "The Man Who Knew Too Little" is,
despite its obviously-spoofy title, original
and potentially hilarious.
Unfortunately, something gets lost in the
translation. What could have been an inven
tive, unique spoof of both Alfred Hitchcock
and James Bond becomes a tired, one-joke
movie that has to extract laughs like it's
pulling teeth. It's not Murray's fault,
though. He plays his formulaic character for
every laugh it's worth, and he manages to
drag out more than a few.
Murray plays Wallace Ritchie, your typi
cal Murray-style loser, a Blockbuster Video
clerk from lowa. He travels to London to
surprise his younger brother, lames (Peter
i .allagher), an investment banker, on his
birthday. But James has other plans, mainly
an important dinner he's hosting that night.
So James packs his brother Wallace off to
the "Theater of Life," a participatory theater
production that involves the audience in its
drama. But Wallace answers the wrong

phone call, and instead ot being part of the
theater production, Wallace becomes part
of an espionage plot by British and Russian
intelligence agents to sabotage an Anglo-
Russian peace treaty. So the whole time,
Wallace thinks he's in this play, and the
saboteurs think he's trying to sabotage
them.
That's the movie's main joke. Actually,
that's the movie's only joke. All laughs to be
had are derivative of that single joke, which
barely even gets reworked for each "new"
joke. It really is a shame, because with a lit
tle more originality in the script, the natu
rally humorous concept behind the movie
could have really worked.
Were it not for Murray's ad-libbing and
over-the-top comedic skills, this movie
would fall totally Hat after the first joke. For
tunately, Murray has experience with spruc
ing up totally ridiculous or tired scripts, so
he does just fine in"The Man Who Knew
Too Little."
