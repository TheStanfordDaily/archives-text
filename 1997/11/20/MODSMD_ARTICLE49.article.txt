# One Night Stand
## 
### 
British director Mike Figgis has
made his latest effort, "One Night
Stand," quite accessible to American
audiences. I personally found his ac
claimed "Leaving Las Vegas" to be
sabotaged by a relentlessly depress
ing story line. Here, however, Figgis
has recaptured the jazzy soul of love
and transplanted it into a fiery, liv
ing film about happiness and carpe
diem.
"One Night Stand" focuses on

two couples, one living in New York
City, the other in Los Angeles. The
California couple is headed by Max
Carlyle, exuberantly played by Wes
ley Snipes as a successful Hollywood
insider, husband and father. He
makes it clear from the start that he
is perfectly straight (though he
probably isn't) and that he is happy
with his wife (though he probably
isn't). His sassy and sharp-minded
spouse, Mimi (Ming-Na Wen, "Joy

Luck Club"), has apparently tried to
inject more punch into their love life
by listening to some self-improve
ment tapes.
The New Yorkers are Vernon
(Kyle MacLachlan) and Karen (Nas
tassja Kinski). We don't really see
Vernon until the second half of the
movie, but he holds a pivotal roie in
the film. Karen is a "rocket scientist,"
or so she describes herself, and she
falls hard for a man with an ink blot

stain on his dress shirt. Eventually,
the two of them sleep together, af
fair-style, and part the next day.
In the center of "One Night
Stand" is Charlie (Robert Downey,
Jr.), who is Vernon's brother and
Max's long-time friend. Charlie
contracts the HIV-virus and spends
much of his on-screen time posi
tioned in a hospital bed. Hy far the
most sympathetic and jovial char
acter, Charlie doles out advice ("life
is an orange") and laughter to those
around his deathbed. In particular,
he insists that Max seize the day, in a
way, and make himself happy.
This doesn't seem that compli-

cated or interesting, does it?
But the affair comes hack to
haunt Karen. I was pleasant
ly surprised when Figgis
found a way to reincorporate
her "one night stand" into
the rest of the story line.
Karen's moral dilemma is
certainly plausible, and it
provides fuel for the passion
ate scenes of lovemaking and
flirting.
At the conclusion, I felt
overwhelmed. The sumptu
ous pieces of jazz and Asian
instrumentation are careful
ly juxtaposed in steamy or
climactic moments. In par
ticular, I am reminded of a
scene in a Japanese sushi
restaurant when the pot
boiler tension is ahout to ex
plode with gusto.

While not perfect, the acting
meets up to liggis' challenging dia
logue and characterization. I
haven't looked too favorably upon
the past work of any ol the main
players in "One Night Stand," but
none of them drag down this film.
Even if the ending itself is a tad dis
appointing, l iggis gives it fresh life
with the use of a black and white
photograph, a device he employs
throughout the film. ()verall, I com
mend the ability of "One Night
Stand" to not leave you feeling
empty and duped like a cheap pros
titute.
