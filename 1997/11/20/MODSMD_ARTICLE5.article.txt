## 
### Ann Kim Contributing writer 
United Farm Workers President Arturo
Rodriguez lauded Stanford's grape boycott
movement and placed this student activism in
the larger context of labor organizing during
the past 30 years in a speech last night.
Rodriguez was brought to campus by the
Coalition for Labor, Dignity and Justice a
student group composed of members ol
ME( hA, a Chicano / Latino group, and St u
dents for Environmental Action at Stanford.
Speaking to an audience of about 200 peo
ple in Annenberg Auditorium, Rodriguez
pointed to his organization's ongoing strug
gle to obtain for farm workers their basic
rights including fair wages, bathrooms and
drinking water in the fields, medical benefits
and pension plans.
"These are things that we all take for
granted, things that we expect wherever we
go to work." said Rodriguez. "You don't
have to go to any third-world country to find
this, it's right here."
Sexual harassment, child labor and poor
housing conditions lor workers are addition
al issues that Rodriguez discussed.
Currently, the union is working to orga
nize more than 20.(XX) strawberry workers in
California.
A strawberry field worker who had ae

companied Rodriguez to last night's speech
described to the audience the conditions he
and his fellow workers face.
"We as workers sometimes work for 10 to
11 hours a day.for six days a week." said the
worker, with Rodriguez translating. "We
work in the rain, we work with the fertilizers
and pesticides that are used out there, that
impact especially those women that are preg
nant and on occasions cause them to lose
their children."
California produces HO percent ol the
strawberries consumed in the I'nited States,
said Rodriguez, and more than 10.(MX) acres
ol land in the state are devoted to the growth
of strawberries.
The primary region ol the California
strawberry industry is Santa ( ruz and Mon
terev counties.
I lie average income ol residents in Santa
( ruz ( ounty places it anu»ng the nation's ten
wealthiest, said Rodriguez, leading to a situa
tion of "simultaneous poverty and wealth
with farm workers living in depressed condi
tions in the same county.

never worked in a strawberry field. Ro

give you a feel for the conditions"
that strawberry workers face.
Rodriguez emphasized that
these workers remain stooped over
for as many as 12 hours a day, pick
ing strawberries as quickly as possi
ble because they are paid on a piece
work basis.
Rodriguez said that HO percent of
strawberry field workers in the
country are less than 30 years old be
cause older workers "can't take it —
physically they can't take it."
Rodriguez's speech was preced
ed by a short video titled "Strawber
ries, the Fruit of Injustice," which
contained clips of past union march
es and interviews with field workers.

One female worker interviewed
for the video said that her husband
had been fired from his field job be
cause she would not have sex with
their supervisor.
The video also showed footage of
children working in the fields and
the lesioned arms of workers ex
posed to harmful pesticides.
Through the course of his speech.
Rodriguez recounted the history of
the union, from its founding in 1%2
by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huer
ta, to its many recent successes and
ongoing campaigns.
"We've had some tremendous
successes in the past four or five
years now and we're moving for
ward." he said.
Rodriguez talked about recent
agreements signed with lettuce and
mushroom growers, a winery in

Washington state and rose plant
growers. Negotiations are currently
under way with Gallo Vineyard in
Sonoma.
"Soon, you can sit down at your
table and have a complete union
meal," he joked.
Rodriguez encouraged student
activism, starting with the basic act
of wearing a IJFW pin so that others
will ask what the pin stands for.
"That's what makes a movement,
people doing simple things," he said.
In response to arguments that
boycott participation should be
avoided due to its political nature,
Rodriguez said. "It's not a political
issue. We're talking about basic
human rights. There's nothing polit
ical about people being treated with
dignity and respect."
