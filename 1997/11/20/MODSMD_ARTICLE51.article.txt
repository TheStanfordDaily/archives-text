## Obsessed with John Cusack 
### 
Fame just isn't his
thing. Whether we see him
with minor roles or in
leading parts, he always
seems to be on the side
lines. And that's the way he
wants it. Despite being re
cruited for films of the likes
of' Apollo 13," actor John
Cusack avoids them care
fully, leaning toward the
roles that offer little glam
our, but true potential.
This true potential,
however, is not immedi
ately obvious if viewers
take a casual glance at
some of Cusack's earliest
work in the film industry,
formerly trapped in the
realm of' Bos teeny-bopper
tlicks, Cusack reeled out a
chain of mostly forgettable
movies that rated pretty
high on the cheese factor.
While the plot and script of
these films could've pro
vided inspiration for the
writers of "Full House," it's
amazing how watchable
they become once Cusack
comes on screen.
In two of his early '80s
movies, "Better Off Dead"
and "One Crazy Summer,"
we begin to get a taste of
how cheesiness can be
come wit in the hands of
Cusack. Perhaps it is his
willingness to treat these
roles with complete seri
ousness that gives the
cloud its silver lining. In
both films, Cusack plays a
hopeless, hapless cartoon
ist searching for love in
mid-'Bos high school sub
urbia, where everyone
wears high tops and listens
to Debbie Gibson.
That's probably why

watching these videos with
a little '90s hindsight gives
them a new twist — Cu
sack, playing the loser
artist, was considered a
nerd in the last decade's
bubble-gum era, but
today, would be looked at
as a real poster boy for '90s
angst. In "Better Off
Dead," Cusack plays Lane,
who after being dumped
by his girlfriend, attempts
to kill himself in a variety
of ways but is always un
successful.
"One Crazy Summer"
is not much more promis
ing, although it is interest
ing to see Cusack co-star
with a pre-fame Demi
Moore, who, since then,
has of course gone on to
better things like, ahem,
"Striptease." Cusack and
Moore play two teenagers
spending their summers in
Nantucket Bay, who even
tually fall for each other
despite hindrances such as
half-witted bullies and
pesky landlords. (Don't
ask.)
Thankfully, in the late
'80s, Cusack began to get
cast in better films that ac
tually matched up to his
talent. The comedy "The
Sure Thing" was a prede
cessor to one of the best
films of the '80s that ranks
right up there with Molly
Ringwald fare — "Say
Anything..." Lloyd Dob
bler, Cusack's character, is
sensitive and pensive, set
ting his eyes on a girl with
brains — Diane Court
(lone Skye). Cusack is en
dearing as the everyman
who can be a gentleman —

he's the guy
who doesn't
drink at par
ties and con
sequently
ends up
being "the
keymaster"
— he drives
home those
who can't.
Diane and
Lloyd's rela
tion s hi p
makes for a
good movie,
especially as
troubles
ensue when
Diane's gruff
and finan
cially irre
sponsible fa
ther ("Frasi
er's" John
M a ho n e y)
disapproves.
Lloyd's sere
nade is prob
ably one of
the most
memorable

scenes of the movie, as he
stands outside Diane's
window with a boom box
playing "In Your Eyes."
The quintessential ro
mantic: that's exacdy what
you get in one of Cusack's
most recent endeavor,
"Grosse Pointe Blank," re
leased last spring in the
aters. Now on video, the
film revolves around the
escapades of Martin Blank,
a "professional" assassin
who reluctantly returns to
his hometown of Grosse
Pointe for his high school
reunion, hoping to also
rekindle a relationship

with his former girlfriend,
Debi (Minnie Driver). The
contrast between Martin
and his former classmates
is undeniably hilarious, as
Martin states himself:
"They've all got children
and homes. What am I
going to say? 1 killed the
president of Paraguay with
a fork." The dark humor
that is pervasive in the film
is reminiscent of "Pulp
Fiction."
While "Grosse Pointe"
played out more like an
indie flick, Cusack s recent
entrance into some main
stream films such as "Con
Air" and the upcoming
"Midnight in the Garden
of Good and Evil," are tes
taments to his diverse act
ing talent. Regardless of
the fact that Cusack is
rarely in the Hollywood
spotlight, it is his claim to
fame that the roles he tack
les would be dishearten
ingly difficult for any other
actor. But the very ease
with which he plays "the
romantic" makes the role
seem all the more captivat
ing and each of his films
entirely worthwhile.
