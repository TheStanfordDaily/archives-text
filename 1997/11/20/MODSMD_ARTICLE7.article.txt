# Haas Center hosts dialogues
## Year-long series will help students reflect on service experience 
### Jaime Adame Contributing writer 
Stanford students participating in
public service will have an organized
forum in which to share thoughts
about their efforts when the new
"( hallenges and I )ilcmmas of Public
Service" dialogue series begins today.
Ken Reardon, professor of urban
and regional planning at the I Jniver
sity of Illinois, will facilitate the year
long series' first event which begins at
7:30 p.m. in the Donald Kennedy
Room of the I laas ( enter for Public
Service.
The dialogue, titled "University-
Community Partnerships," will ad
dress the tension that can arise be
tween the community and a universi
ty, as well as the question of research
as a form ol public service. Most of
the meeting, however, will deal with

the students' own experiences.
"A lot of students involved in pub
lic service have articulated a desire
tor a program such as this," said ju
nior Elizabeth Pianca.
"The Haas Center is a busy, active
place," said Nadinne Cruz, the cen
ter's associate director. "It's hard for
people to take the time and talk to
each other. This program is trying to
address this."
Cruz added that the benefits of
volunteering are not self-evident.
"The purpose of the dialogue is to
provide a structured forum for stu
dents to reflect on their public ser
vice," she said.
Tonight's talk is sponsored by the
center and the Public Service Schol
ars Program. The program consists of
about 12 students who have been in
volved in community service
throughout their Stanford careers.

According to Pianca, who helped
coordinate the event, three to five di
alogues are planned for both winter
and spring quarters, on such topics as
"Art as Activism" and "Solidarity."
The dialogues are meant for stu
dents who already have a commit
ment to public service but are not lim
ited to those working out of the cen
ter. Those involved in tutoring pro
grams, summer projects or any other
type of service are welcome.
Cruz emphasized that the pro
ject's aim is not to convince students
to volunteer, but to strengthen the ex
isting service community at Stanford.
"A lot of students find themselves
at somewhat of a loss," Pianca said.
"We're providing something that is
out there but not formalized. Our
goal is to build a community of stu
dents that ask questions about why
they volunteer for public service."
