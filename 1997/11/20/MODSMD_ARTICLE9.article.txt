Records shredded
WASHINGTON (AP)
Naval Research Laboratory
records that "chronicle some of the
most significant technical achieve
ments in the 20th century" were
inadvertently destroyed by the
National Archives.
They were "pulped beyond
recognition," the archives said yes
terday. The archives and the Navy
blamed each other.
Fed into the pulper sometime
last summer were 4,2(X) scientific
notebooks and 6(H) boxes of corre
spondence and technical memos.
" The historical record of our
nation's scientific and technologi
cal heritage has suffered a serious
and irreparable loss." Rear Adm.
Paul (i. (iaffney 11, chief of Naval

Research, wrote National
Archivist John Carlin, protesting
the destruction of the records.
Among the lost records,
Ciaffney said, were the correspon
dence of American pioneers in
high frequency radio, work of the
inventors of radar "and the war
records of the application of these
technologies in the campaigns
against Na/i C icmany and Imperi
al Japan."
Also lost were records of "path
breaking acoustic and occano
graphic research" and materials
tracing the early history of the
American space program with V-2
and Viking rockets, records of
Vanguard, the first U.S. satellite
program "and much more,"
(iaffney said.
Phe papers, dating from the

1430s through the 1980s, were
destroyed at the archives' facilities
in Suitland. Mil., and the remain
ing pulp was sent out for recycling,
the agency said.
I he archives said that "in accor
dance with established procedure"
it had sent the Office of Naval
Research notice that the records
would be routinely destroyed 90
days later unless it heard otherwise.
" Though the Navy responded
lo other notices that came with this
one, it raised no objection to carry
ing out the scheduled disposal of
the laboratory material." the
archives said.
Dick Thompson, a Navy lab
spokesman, said the laboratory did
not receive the notice and did not
know ol the records' destruction
until last July.
