## Mexico City mayor speaks to Kresge crowd 
### Adam kemezis Editorial staff 
A near-capacity crowd in Kresge Auditori
um last night gave two rousing standing ova
tions to Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the newly
elected mayor of Mexico City, who spoke on
past and future changes in the politics and soci
ety of Mexico.
Cardenas was elected mayor of the world's
largest city in July, and is leader of the largest
opposition party to the PRI, the party that has
governed Mexico for 70 years. That election
also relegated the PRI to a minority in one
house of the legislature and represents an un

precendented crack in the PRl's monopoly on
power.
Cardenas' overriding theme was the re
assertion of the rule of law in Mexico, the elim
ination of corruption and the need for govern
ment to live up to its social as well as its eco
nomic responsibilities.
Much of Cardenas' speech was taken up in
assailing the current national government in
Mexico, for its corruption and "neoliberal eco
nomic model."
That model, he said, had led to "the conver
sion of [Mexico's] national economy into ;i sub-
sidiary" of the United States.
This had led, he said, to concen
tration of wealth in the hands of a
few and falling living standards for
ordinary Mexicans, which in turn
had led voters at last to turn their
backs on the PR 1..
Now. he said, the task of his party,
the PRI). is "to show that there are
alternative ways to govern."
This, he said, meant redefining
government's relationship to the
people, curbing corruption and in
sisting that "social and economic
policies should be built around peo
ple and the needs of people."
Instead of the "clientistic," bribe
ridden relations that persist between
Mexicans and their government,
Cardenas said he hoped for a gov
ernment that would follow the rule
of law and provide useful services to
ordinary citizens.
Cardenas spent most of his time
answering questions from a panel
on stage and from the highly sup
portive audience. 1 he heavily Span
ish-speaking audience also respond
ed with applause to mention of Car
denas' father Lazaro, who was a pop
ular president of Mexico during the
l l )3()s. The younger Cardenas has a
doctorate in engineering, and is
often known in Mexico simply as
"The Engineer."
