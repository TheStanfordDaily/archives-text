BETHESDA, Md. (AP) â€” Promising new help
against crippling osteoporosis, government advisers
recommended approval yesterday of a drug that
mimics estrogen's hone-saving effects hut without the
breast cancer risk.
But the long-awaited raloxifene does not protect
bones as well as estrogen, the gold-standard treat
ment. advisers to the FDA said yesterday.
"I'd like to refer to it as 'estrogen light." It does the
same thing as Premarin but not as well," said Dr.
Cilenn Braunstein of Cedars-Sinai Medical (enter in
Los Angeles, referring to the top estrogen brand.
Doctors told the advisers that raloxifene could be
an important option for women afraid of estrogen,
because long-term use can increase the risk of breast

cancer. Others simply won't take it because il brings
back their menstrual period, said Dr. Ethel Siris of
Columbia University.
"I don't think anybody thinks raloxifene is going
to replace estrogen," she said. "If I can give estrogen
I will, but it's a lovely option... for a substantial num
ber of women."
I lie FDA advisers voted N-4 it) recommend
approval of raloxifene, to be sold by Fli Lilly undei
the brand name Evista. I he FDA is not bound by the
advice of its panels but usually follows it.

them at risk for the disease.
