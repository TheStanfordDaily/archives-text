## Editorial 100 years of great tradition The 						big Big Game 
### 
This year's Big Game
brings tradition and
energy to Stanford.

OVER ONE CENTURY asojthe
first Stanford-California football
game was played and subse
quently dubbed Big Game. Tomorrow,
the tradition will continue with the 100 th
Big Game at 12:30 at Stanford Stadium.
It marks a significant moment and rep
resents the most prominent symbol of the
history of rivalry between Stanford and
Cal. Big Game has served as a model for
other rival match ups that can only aspire
to be Big Game Big Splash (Water
Polo), Big Skate (Ice Hockey) or Big
Swim (Swimming).
The first Big Game was a 14-0 Stan
ford rout of Cal played March I 1 ), 1 S c >2;
tickets were $1, and the Stanford team
had exactly 11 players.
Since then there have been periods of
hiatus, numerous thefts of the coveted
Axe (which surfaced in l<S l ) 9) and bizarre
games that will live forever in people's
memories.
One hundred four years later, how
things have changed. Tickets now run at
least $50 for regular patrons, and at least
$35 for students (the season ticket price):
and the team is comprised of over SO
players. But one thing has remained con
stant, Stanford's dominance on the field.
The Cardinal has bested Cal in 4 l ) of W
match-tips, including I I ties. Stanford

also enters this year's game, hearing the
Axe and having won three of the last four
Big Games. But no matter whieh team is
ranked, whieh team is better or how the
rest of the season has gone â€” the Stan
ford and Gal fans take none of that into
consideration. It's always been a game in
which anything can and has happen.
In addition to tlie nostalgia that has
surrounded I his Big Game in particular,
there is also a renewed enthusiasm and
energy for a game that only last year
failed to meet even the lowest expecta
tions of ticket sales.
I'll is year, tickets are sold out for every
single seat in the 85,500 person stadium
scalped tickets are going for as much
as $75 dollars each, more than eight times
the nine dollar face value of a student
seat. Gaieties tickets for Friday were so
overbooked that many dorms had to have
their requests pushed to another night.
And even though the Lake Lagunita bon
fire seems like a thing of the past, stu
dents are planning parties and tailgates to
boost the spirit.
Sd. despite the dreary weather, and
despite the fact that we have Thanksgiv
ing, dead weak and finals on the horizon,
Stanford students have shown that this
Big Game is worth putting aside worries
for and worth enjoying.
We're perfectly capable of setting
down those books, projects and problems
sets and getting out there to have a good
time watching the Card crush the Wee
nies.
It's not like something like this comes
around everv century.
