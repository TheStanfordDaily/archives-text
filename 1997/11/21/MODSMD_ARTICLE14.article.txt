## Taking advantage of diversity 
### 
MULTICU L-
T URALISM
and diversity,
however they may be
defined, are two things
that most Stanford stu
dents will say they value.
Except for some of the
Stanford Review staff

and various others, I think a good chunk of
us will openly agree that Stanford as an insti
tution should actively promote multicultural
ism and diversity in various ways.
Do current University efforts in this arena
do that? And is it enough to stop at multicul
turalism without examining racial tensions or
at diversity without examining levels of inte
gration?
There seems to be a major contradiction
on this campus. We rallied vehemently
against Proposition 2()9, in part because we
justifiably believe that it will deny admission
to countless minorities applying to public
universities. We support race-specific affir
mative action policies because we believe
diversity in the workplace and on campus to
be a good. We support Stanford's enlight
ened admissions policy, which does take race
into account, because we believe the experi
ences people of varying backgrounds can
bring to this campus are valuable experi
ences we all can learn from. We also form
student groups specifically geared toward
gaining tenure for minorities and women.
The principles of diversity and multicul

turalism, it would seem, are highly popular in
the general Stanford student population.
Many students continue to argue that we
indeed need MORE diversity and a greater
focus on multiculturalism, which we will
nearly all openly agree is a very respectable
position.
Yet I would argue our own behavior typ
ically runs contrary to these principles, that
we have so deliberately and wisely placed on
pedestals. Though we have a certain degree
of diversity on this campus, it doesn't take
much more than a glance around your aver
age dining hall or frat party to figure out that
diversity doesn't mean integration. It also
doesn't mean understanding or sensitivity or
even tolerance. How can this be?
We have certain student groups, the most
well known of which are AASA, MEChA,
the BSU and SAIO, that are organized
around particular racial or ethnic groups.
These groups put on various events all year
long that are sometimes educational, some
times cultural. The LGBCC, Women's Cen
ter and numerous religious groups each have
a plethora of events and programs designed
to increase awareness. In addition, the Uni
versity has graciously supplied us with four
ethnic theme dorms, residential education
programs and the wildly popular CIV in an
attempt to foster an overriding sense of com
munity among each other.
All of these student groups, and countless
others, offer opportunities for students who
are not part of "their" group to learn what

"their" group is about. Similarly, Stanford's
institutionalized programs work toward this
general goal as well by attempting to expose
students to different cultures and back
grounds.
But few students take advantage of these
opportunities. Some students may simply
wish to stay in a distinct comfort zone by
"sticking with their own." Others decry the
existence of such groups as separatist and
thus may see their motivations and ideology
as too extreme or foreign. Others just don't
care. This, apparently, is the reality of how
much we value diversity.
Groups need to aggressively increase
their outreach efforts to try and include ALI.
students in events and activities. Simply invit
ing them isn't enough. Why not encourage
group members to bring at least two friends
of different backgrounds to every event?
Similarly, we as students need to be much
more receptive to such efforts. There is no
reason why there shouldn't be a large group
of Mexican Americans, blacks and whites at
a conference on Asian-American issues.
The mentality that certain issues are
exclusive to certain groups needs to be aban
doned in favor of a much more inclusive
vision: that their issues are our issues.
Because the grape issue is particularly
important to the Chicano community, it
should be important to nil of us. Because
racism and sexism affect the daily lives of
many students on campus, fighting them
should be important to all of us.
Folks, if we are to have any legitimacy in
our calls for diversity at Stanford and else
where, we've got to demonstrate we mean it".
Otherwise, what's the point?
