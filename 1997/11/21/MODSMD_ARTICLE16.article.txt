G.I. Jane insults Arabs
We arc the Stanford Israel Alliance, an
organization devoted to increasing both cam
pus awareness and tolerance of Israel and
Middle-Eastern issues. We recently began to
meet with OASIS (Organization lor Arab-
American Students in Stanford), the Arab
student group on campus. Perhaps you have
not heard of them. 1 his may be because they
felt pressure to disband in IW2 when there
was an increase in anti-Arab sentiment on
campus following the Gulf War. During a
meeting with OASIS they mentioned to us
that "(j.I. Jane." the movie about a female
Navy Seal that will be shown this week at
Flicks, ended with Demi Moore killing a
group of Arabs. I hey felt that it was unnec
essary to have the "bad guys" be Arabs with
out the movie showing positive Arab charac
ters. much as is the case in many action
thrillers today.
After seeing the movie, we could not
agree more. I lie ending was completely
unrelated to the plot, and one can only
assume that movie makers saw the Arabs as
an easy target for such a scene. All Arabs are
bad. right? Of course not. But that seems to
be the way many people feel. I his prejudice
is why ()ASIS disbanded for three vears. But

when you look around campus and see Arab
students in your classes, or in you dorm,
think whether they really are terrorists them
selves. For sure, they are not.
After seeing the movie our eyes have
been opened to many small, but noteworthy,
anti-Arab messages in our country today. ()n
Nov. 23. Flicks will be showing "Ci.l. Jane."
We urge you to attend. We do not want you
to miss this blatant display of prejudice. We
need you to see it and think about it. so that
you also may begin to see how unfairly
Arabs are treated in our society. At the
movie showing, members of both SI A and
OASIS will be circulating a petition directed
to Disney, the film's parent studio, protesting
the unfair and prejudiced portrayal of Arabs
in this and many other Disney productions.
We hope you will join our protest by signing
the petition.

Colin owes apology
Robert Greet Gohn's crotchety letters in
the past have been funny when they were not
impenetrable, but Ins letter of Nov. was
inexcusable. After calling Gerhard Casper
"insensate and arrogant." Colin wrote.

"Alter Casper's compatriots had murdered
six million Jews..thus graciously associat
ing Stanford's president with one of the most
horrendous acts in history. Cohn may criti
cize Stanford's president all he likes, but to
associate him with the Holocaust, as he clear
ly did is irrational and unconscionable. It's
easy not to take Cohn seriously, especially
when he blames contemporary culture and
other villains for the absence of students
from his seminars, but in this case he owes an
apology to the Stanford community for vio
lating standards of civility.

Cro Mem builds a sense
of community for grads
Why would a bunch of grad students in
their mid-20s want to live in a dormitory?
The answer is community. For over 40 years.
Crothers Memorial Hall has been a graduate
residence that gives priority to engineering
students. By offering single rooms, it gives
the students the privacy and separation that
graduate students need, yet at the same time,
it gives them a feeling of community by keep
ing neighbors in close proximity.

Thanks to such advantages, the students
of Cro Mem have been able to create the
ideal university community. However, the
Cro Mem community is being threatened by
a proposal to move graduate students out in
an effort to ease the undergraduate housing
crunch. I strongly suggest that the adminis
tration do what it can to preserve the Cro
Mem community and use it as a model for
other on-campus residential communities.
I am a first year masters student in electri
cal engineering and a resident of Cro Mem.
When I applied for housing at Stanford. I list
ed Cro Mem as my first choice because it
offered single rooms and a dormitory setting.
As a 24-year-old graduate student. I am not
as willing to share a dormitory room as I was
when I was 18 or l l ). Yet I appreciate the dor
mitory setting because it is ideal for someone
who has just moved to the area. It allows me
to easily access 120 possible new friends. I
would not have this opportunity if I lived in
apartment-style housing.
The dormitory setting benefits all of the
students in Cro Mem by building a commu
nity. The kind of community we have here
could not be created in am setting other than
a dormitory. Whenever any of us needs com
pany. we are free to wander the halls and
stop by any of our friends' rooms. Many of us
leave our dcx>rs open for this reason.

Clearly, this social dynamic could only be
possible in a dormitory setting. In addition to
the random scxial activities, there are also
many organized social opportunities that
could only be possible in a dormitory setting.
Every Wednesday night we have the offi
cial Wednesday night study break and the
"Cool Ray Flicks" night. About 30 to 50 stu
dents always gather together for these
events. I his Cro Mem tradition has contin
ued lor well over 10 years now, and I hope
that this tradition will continue indefinitely.
I lie dormitory also offers a great setting to
organize and take field trips, as well as to
plan other social outings. All these social
benefits create a feeling of community
among the residents of Cro Mem.
In my opinion, this is the tvpe of commu
nity that all university residence halls should
be striving to create. Cro Mem is a model
community and should therefore be pre
served. I encourage all the residents of Cro
Mem. all those concerned about graduate
housing, and all those who want to preserve
an ideal residential community to show their
support tor keeping Cro Mem "as is." I also
strongly encourage the administration to
reconsider its proposal to disassemble the
community of CroMem.
