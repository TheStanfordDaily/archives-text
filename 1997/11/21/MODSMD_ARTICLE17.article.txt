## Orchestra dreams: tougher than the NFL

Young women all over
Europe carried handkerchiefs
emblazoned with the profile of the
most famed and desirable artist of their
time, Ludwig van Beethoven. Their fathers
warned them that their virtuous souls would
be corrupted by the passion of his music.
But their mothers swooned along with
them.
How times have changed.
Last week the Royal Opera House,
which is based in London and is one of the
premier opera companies in the world, was
relieved to announce they are five million
pounds in debt. They were relieved because
just the week before, administrators had
crawled on their knees into the House of
.Commons begging for help. Luckily, many
patrons, wealthy and not, heard the plea
and donated several million to help them
out. So the performances will go on with the
fat lady hanging by a thread.
In England, this is a new experience. The
threat of losing an ensemble the caliber of
the Royal Opera House and its partner, the
Royal Ballet, is a shocking and unaccept
able thing. Unlike in the United States
where orchestras and opera companies are
either striking or filing for Chapter 13 every
other year, the cause for the money troubles
Jiere weren't because of a lack of concert
goers but because of poor accounting skills
of their management.
They decided to build a beautiful 213
million pound concert hall in Covent Gar
den. If only the San Francisco Symphony

could be so lucky.
In the United States orchestras play to
empty halls, renovated or crumbling. Just
last year, three major orchestras, Atlanta,
Philadelphia and San Francisco, went on
strike. The players wanted reasonable ben
efits, but the managers had no way to pay
for them. In the meantime, record compa
nies started pulling those orchestras" main
source of income â€” recording contracts.
Somehow those orchestras pulled back
together but with debts unlikely to be paid
anytime soon and wounds that clearly
show they aren't supported by the general
public anymore.
Newspapers compared the San Fran
cisco Orchestra strike to those in baseball,
spoiled managers and players ruining the
spirit of the game. But there's a big dif
ference between baseball the enterprise
and classical music the art.
What a surprise, classical musicians are
not rich. All that the orchestra strikers
were asking for were reasonable benefits
every worker in America deserves.
Because an orchestra job pays only during
the concert season, players often boost their
salaries by teaching little kids who don't
practice. While they're paying their rents,
they're also paying off their instrument; a
reasonably good violin for a professional
can run more than $35,(HH), plus a bow at
more than $S.(XH), plus annual insurance,
maintenance, strings etc. And then there are
the medical bills.
The state of employment in the classical

and jazz music world, other than those
who write techno songs and commercial
jingles, is so bad that music conservatories
try to scare off students by letting them

know the odds. The odds of making it as a
full time player in a major orchestra are
worse than becoming a player in the NI L.
I lie training lasts a lifetime an average
of four hours each day as a little kid until
your dead, which undoubtedly leads to
tendentious or carpal tunnel syndrome.
The probability of risk of injury is equal to
that for players of professional contact

sports. That may be the closest this gets to
baseball. The biggest difference is that
Americans just don't know about classical
music anymore, whereas the know the
stats of so many players in whatever
league.

Everywhere in England, in the taxis
and coffee shops, in the workshop of the
metal worker to the dentist, radios arc
tuned to a BBC broadcasting a program
on the Liszt Piano Concertos. Ask them
whether they like classical music, and they
wonder why you even bother asking. Ask
them whether they like pop, and it's the
same thing. They like music.
As Americans, we are taught to trade
one for the other. People who play piano
or flute most often keep that part of their
lives hidden. Who ever admitted having to
practice violin after school? Chat's why
most of us quit our instruments in middle
school when parents lei us make our own
choices and when best friends convinced
us that clarinet was just not cool.
And now the only things that ever com
bats that negative peer pressure music

education programs don't even bother
with elassieal anymore. Young children
don't sit down and pay attention to it. teach
ers say. Maybe it's because lor the first time
ever, an entire generation of parents don't
know anything about classical themselves,
and so their little kids haven't heard any
thing other than pop music since they were
born. Doesn't anyone remember those
studies about how attention span, 10 and

coordination arc linked to studying an
instrument and Mo/art?
I won't deny that it's important to learn
about pop music. It sounds good, offers a
new angle, represents a whole new move
ment. Hut I offer this test: Name any pop
song that does not take its chords and pro
gressions from classical or jazz. Ask John
I'esh to play Rachmaninoff, and then ask
Andre Watts to play John I'esh. Convince
me that am rock song is in any way more
sophisticated than even the simplest Haydn
symphony.
I'm taking art for art's sake. I'm not
putting pop or whatever music below any
thing else. I'm just pulling classical music
hack up to everything else.
A guy m high school tried to persuade
me that classical is that it's just too damn
slow. 'Violins are so medieval,' he threw at
me. as lie strummed the only three chords
he knew on his guitar. Well, apart from the
anachronism (violin's aren't that old), lie's
right. I he only classical piece he probably
ever heard was I'aehelbcl's Canon, and
while that can be nice on some days, there's
a hell of a lot more out there. 1 his is not a
passing of an era. II it were, every other
country in the world would be following our
lead. ('onipared to the world. America's the
one that's behind.
