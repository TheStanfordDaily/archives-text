■ LAST NIGHT'S RESULT: Stan
ford def. California 15-9, 15-2, 15-1
■ SUNDAY: No. 3 Stanford (27-2,
18-0) vs. No. 14 Hawaii (23-5) at

No. 3 Stanford (27-2, IS-0 Pacific
10 Conference) wiped up the floor
with Cal (8-19.3-15) and finished off
a perfect conference record in con
vincing fashion. Cal hung around
for part of game one before losing
15-9. but Stanford rolled in games
two md three, 15-2 and 15-1.
'It's the kind of match where you
don't know how a team is going to
go." said head coach Don Shaw of
( al. "It's their last match. They may
want to go out on a blaze of glory, or
they may just want to get it over
with."
Senior middle blocker Barbara
Ifejika got things going for the Car
dinal early and kept them going all
night. Down 1-0 in game one, Ifejika
rattled off back-to-back service aces
to put Stanford out front for good.
I he i losest Cal ever got was 6-5
on a kill I senior outside hitter Jes
sica Dinabcrg. Dinaberg and fresh
man Alicia Perry led the Bears of
fense with nine kills apiece.
But Stanford's serving, Stan
lord's defense, Stanford's every
thing was just too good for Cal. The
Card capitalized on several Golden
Bear errors and some nice blocking

from llejika and sophomore outside
hitter Kerri Walsh to go up 13-6. Cal
got three more after that on an over
pass and two Cardinal errors, but
Stanford finished it off 15-9.
"We came out a little bit rusty in
the first game." said senior co-cap
tain Lisa Sharpley. "But we decided
to take care of business in games two
and three. It was our chance to show
off what we could do against a weak
er opponent."
The Cardinal did just that in the
final two games, allowing Cal just
three points. A kill by Cal's Perry
cut the Stanford lead to 4-2 in game
two, but the Golden Bears were
shut out for the remainder of the
game. Stanford chipped away,
never allowing Cal to capitalize on
sideouts and gradually building its
lead.
llejika came up with an impres
sive serve once again, allowing se
nior outside hitter Kristin Folkl to
get the easy overpass and then
recording the third ol her four aces
to help the Card go up <S-2. Ihe
evening was particularly special for
llejika. because the senior's parents
were in the crowd for the first time
in her four-year Stanford career.
"I'm so elated." said llejika, who
finished with six kills, 10 digs and
five block assists. "I can't wait to go
give them a hug. It's great to finish
the Pac-10 undefeated and win with
authority. And I'm very excited for
senior night — that's going to be
special."
It seemed like everyone on the
squad was ready to fast-forward to
Sunday's season finale against No.
14 Hawaii. I he Card cruised
through the rest of game two with
out dropping another point and
then finished the Bears off 15-1 in
game three. Folkl guided the Stan
ford offense with a match-high 15

kills dm a .5 l l > hitting percentage.
The Cardinal concludes the regu
lar season Sunday ;it 5 p.m. against
the Rainbow Waliine (23-5, 14-0
Western Athletic ( onference). I he
match represents senior night for

the team's live seniors, and is a re
match of last year's national chain
pionsliip game.
Stanford won that contest 15 7,
15-3, 15-5. in the most lopsided
N( 'A A championship match ever.
