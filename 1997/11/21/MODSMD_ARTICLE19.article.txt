WATER POLO
â–  lOMORROW: No. 2 Stanford
(17-5. (v2) vs. No. 3 ( alifotnia (I 1 ) 5.
7 I) at dcCiuerre Pool. 10 a.m.

1 wo of (lie nation's best colle
giate water polo programs do battle
again in the annual Big Splash to
morrow at 10 a.m. at deduerre

Pool.
No. 2 Stanford (17 5. o 1 Moun
tain Paeilie Sports Federation) will
challenge No. } ( al (l l )-5. 7 1). And
for hoth squads, ;i vietorv will he
worth a lot more than just bragging
rights.
"Ihe winner ol this game will
have the edge going into the confer
enee tournament." said Stanford
head coach Dante Dettamanti
And an uppei hand heading into
the Mountain Pacific Sports l edci
ation tournament No\. 2X-30 in
Long Beach could be the ultimate
key to receiving a bid to the NCAA
Championships. An easy victory for
either squad this weekend is highly
unlikely.
Together, Cal and Stanford have
captured 19 out of 28 NCAA water
polo championships. In addition, ei
ther the Bears or the Cardinal have
captured the national title 15 times
in the past 17 years.
" This is the greatest rivalry in col

lege water polo," Dettamanti said.
"We've been going at it since the
early l9(K)s."
According to sophomore driver
Brian Heifferon, this year's match
should be no exception.
"It's going to be a really physical
match with everything that's on the
line," Heifferon said. "It's going to
be really intense."
In their only previous matchup
Oct. 3 at Diablo Valley College, the
Bears handed the Cardinal a 7-4
loss.
lied 4-4 heading into the fourth
quarter, three Bear goals sealed the

game as then-No. 2 Cal beat then-
No. 4 Stanford.
But as the season has progressed,
the tables appear to have turned.
The Cardinal has won four con
secutive matches, most recently a 9-
5 victory over No. 4 IJSC at
deGuerre Nov. lb.
Aside from a 7-6 defeat to
IJCLA Nov. 2, Cal's only losses
have been to squads that the Cardi
nal has defeated: namely No. I Pep
perdine and the Trojans.
But whatever the statistics, the
Big Splash will almost certainly be a
tightlv fought affair.
