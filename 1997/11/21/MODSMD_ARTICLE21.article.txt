Stanford, meanwhile, is riding a
four-game losing streak that pre

being played on home turf.
The Cardinal flies to Seattle this
afternoon and will practice on the
Huskies' field tomorrow. The
schedule should allow the team to
be well-rested and relaxed. On its
last trip to the Northwest, the team
had to fly into Portland and drive to
Seattle due to budget constraints,
Clark said.
"We did a fair bit of miles last
time," he said. "It will be a fair bit
easier just flying into Seattle."
If Stanford wins Sunday, it will
meet either IJCLA or Santa Clara
in a second-round match. Both
teams have beaten the Cardinal in
