lour starters from last year's 16-11
squad to face Stanford for only the
second time in the team's history.
Leading the way is senior guard
Katie Voigt, who sat out last season
with a torn ACL. She has come back
strong, displaying pinpoint shooting
in exhibition play, where she aver
aged 18 points.
The Badgers are under the tute
lage of fourth-year coach Jane Al
bright-Dieterle, who has led them
to the NCAA tournament's second
round twice, including 19%, when
Wisconsin finished 21-8 — its best
record ever. They, too, have only
played exhibition games thus far,
tailing to Athletes In Action and the
Russian Select Team.
As for Purdue, the Boilermakers
have literally made hiring a new
coach a yearly ritual. Carolyn Peck
takes over for Nell Fortner, who
after one season left the program to
become head coach of the USA
Basketball National Team. Peck is
no stranger to big-time basketball,
having served as an assistant under
I'at Summitt at Tennessee for two
vears before working under Fortner

last season.
The team itself returns eight
players from a squad that went 11 -4
to close the year before falling in
overtime to Old Dominion in the
second round of the NCAA tourna
ment. Last season, Purdue dropped
a 83-57 decision to the Cardinal in
Maples Pavilion.
The Boilermakers already have
one game under their belt, having
downed Indiana State 89-58. Ukari
Figgs led the way with 21 points, in
cluding two three-pointers. Purdue
will rely on the junior point guard
heavily, along with junior shooting
guard Stephanie White, who at 16.4
points per game returns as the
team's leading scorer.
"We are playing an incredibly
tough schedule," VanDerveer said.
"But I think it's something that's
good for the team and the develop
ment of the team.
"Last year, we had a great record
and we played a tough schedule.
But now, we've even made it
tougher, and it's just so the team
isn't afraid of any situation and
they're ready for anything.
"So much for rankings and
records. Let's just accept the chal
lenge of playing great competition
and get better."
