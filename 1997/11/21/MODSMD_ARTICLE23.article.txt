# 100th BIG GAME
## Cardinal season rests on Biggest of Games Despite 4-6 record, five-game losing streak, Stanford can salvage pride 
### Dave Flemming Contributing writer 
This is what's great about the
Stanford-Cal rivalry.
In many of the 99 meetings be
tween these two teams — and. in
deed, in this year's matchup as well
there hasn't been much to play
for except the all-important Big
Game bragging rights.
But the fact that Stanford and
Cal have not played with national
championship hopes hanging in the
balance on a yearly basis has not
stopped this matchup from becom
ing one of the greatest rivalries in
college athletics.
In a year in which Stanford (4-6,
2-5 Pacific 10 Conference) has fallen
short of meeting its lofty expecta
tions, the Big Game offers an op
portunity for the Cardinal to re
deem its season. Stanford brings its
longest losing streak since 1989 into
tomorrow's 1 (K)th Big Game at sold
out Stanford Stadium. But if the
Cardinal beats the Bears (3-7, 1-6),
many Stanford fans will forget those
struggles and rejoice in a third
straight Big Game triumph.
"Our football team is looking

forward to a one-game season," said
head coach Tyrone Willingham. "1
don't know if you can say the season
will be saved, but if you look at the
magnitude of this game, you can see
the precedence it takes."

100 th BIG GAME

■ TOMORROW: Stanford (4-6, 2-
5) vs. California (3-7.1 -6) at Stanford
Stadium, 12:30 p.m. TV: ABC (STV
Channel 27). Radio: KZSU-FM
(90.1), KSFO (560 AM)

Last year, Stanford steamrolled
Cal 42-21 at Memorial Stadium on
its way to a Sun Bowl appearance. It
appeared midway through this sea
son that the Cardinal would once
again dominate this year's contest:
Stanford was flying high at 4-1.
while the Bears were struggling. But
five straight losses have wrecked the
Cardinal's hopes for a third consec

utive postseason under Willingham
and have ensured Stanford a losing
season.
Meanwhile, the Bears have had
an even tougher time. Cal has lost
seven of its last eight games and sits
in ninth place in the Pac-10. But de
spite both teams' recent difficulties,
if the l(H)th Big Game is at all like
the 99 before it, it will make for an
exciting contest.
The Cal-Stanford rivalry has pro
duced more games that have been
won on the final play — four — than
any other series in college football.
Remarkably, 46 Big Games have
been decided by a touchdown or
less. And since the first Big Game in
1892, Stanford — which holds the
series lead 49-39-11 has
outscored Cal by a total of only 109
points, barely one point per game.
"The tradition was taught to me
by (former Stanford coach and cur
rent Minnesota Vikings head coach
Dennis) Green," Willingham said.
"It was taught to Green by coaches
before him. (This game) doesn't
need anything surrounding it to
make it special."
Tomorrow's game has the poten

tial to be a cliffhanger not only be
cause of the tradition of fantastic fin
ishes between the two teams, but
also because Stanford has played so
poorly of late. Now Big Game
seems more like an even match than
it did just a few weeks ago.
Stanford's troubles are numer
ous. Injuries in the secondary and
along the offensive line have forced
inexperienced players into crucial
situations. Turnovers have also
killed Stanford. During its losing
skid, the Cardinal has given the ball
away 22 times while forcing just
seven turnovers.
In last week's 38-28 loss at Wash
ington State, Stanford turned it over
live times, including four intercep
tions by sophomore quarterback
lodd liusak. (Mhcrwisc, the ('ardi
nal played by far its best game since
early October, nearly upsetting the
No. 11 Cougars.
Redshirt sophomore quarter
back Chad Hutchinson will proba
bly return to his starting role for the
season finale The thumb injury that
Hutchinson suffered on the second
play of last week's game apparently
has healed sufficiently.

The Stanford offense
might have its best chance
in weeks to regain its
early-season productivi
ty facing a porous Cal de
fense. The Bears'defense i:
last in the I'ae-10, allowing
32 points per game, and
has surrendered an
alarming 41 plays of 25
yards or longer. Cal has
one defensive star, senioi

tackle Brandon Whiting, and an
otherwise youthful squad featuring
only one other senior starter.
I his should come as a relief for
Stanford, which has faced five tough
defensive squads in the last live
games.
()ne player that undoubtedly will
produce for Stanford is sophomore
receiver Troy Walters. Amidst a dis
appointing Cardinal campaign,
Walters has had the greatest receiv
ing year in Stanford football history.

Keyshawn Johnson. Walters needs
only 12 yards tomorrow — for a
total of 1,118 — lo break Gene
Washington's 29-year old Stanford
record for receiving yards in a sea
son.
Walters has also returned two
punts for touchdowns in the last two
weeks.
Another Cardinal standout this
year has been senior defensive end
Kailee Wong. Wong, who leads the

Pac-10 in sacks and tackles for loss,
last week became the first Stanford
defensive lineman in 21 years to be
named an Ail-American when
Football News placed him on its first
team.
Wong is one of many Cardinal
senior standouts playing their final
collegiate game tomorrow. Run
ning backs Anthony Bookman and
Mike Mitchell third and fourth,
respectively, on the all-time Stan
lord rushing list — finish their ca
reers against the Bears, as does
wideout Damon Dunn — the great
est kickoff returner in Stanford his
tory — and fullbacks Jon Ritchie

and Greg Comella.
On the defensive side, tackle
Carl Hansen, linebackers Chris
Draft and John Haskins, end Bryan
Werner and safety Alistair White
are all starters playing their final
game.
It would certainly be a bitter pill
for this group of veterans to swallow
if Stanford lost the 100 th Big Game
at home and ended the season with
six straight losses.
The 100 th Big Game will not
produce a Rose Bowl champion.
But like so many Stanford ( al clas
sics of the past, it is sure to be enter
taining.
