# Getting a last laugh from 'The Play'
## 
### 
Now that we're finally on the eve of the l(H)th Big
Game, I'm sure everyone has been well-versed on
all the great names and amazing finishes in this
cross-Bay rivalry. No stranger to this list is the 1982 Big
Game, which forever will be defined by "The Flay," the
one with the five laterals, Stanford's band on the field and
Cal radio announcer Joe Starkey capturing the moment
with his immortal call (even if you have no idea from lis
tening to it what exactly transpired).

So, you're Stanford. You've just been felled in the most
bizarre play in the rivalry's history. There's no bowl game
for the Cardinal, and the Axe is in Berkeley. What do you
do to get some measure of revenge?
How about an elaborate hoax by The Stanford Daily?
The erstwhile student newspaper was no stranger to
pulling pranks at the expense of Cal. In some Daily
staffers produced a bogus issue ol the Daily ( alilornian
that had a story declaring the football team ineligible for
collegiate play due to N( A A violations.
Adam Berns "had always talked about that, said
Mark Zeigler, now a sportswriter for the San Diego
Union-Tribune, in reference to the 72 hoax. "From the
time 1 knew him. he just kept talking about it. Alter Ihe
Flav.' he just said It's time.'
The Stanl d Daily was about to further immortalize
an unforgettable moment in the Stanford-C al rivalry. It
was going to piece together a lake Daily ( al with the
screaming headline "NCAA awards Big Game to Stan
ford."

The three main
perpetrators were
sportswriters
Mark Zeigler,
Class of '85. and
Adam Berns <S4.
and entertainment
editor Tony Kelly
\S6. However, this
immortal trio first
had a few prob
lems to overcome,
namely midterms
and ethics â€” in
that order
"It snowballed

pretty quickly,' recalls Kelly, now a director tor the the
ater company Thick Description in San Francisco. I here
was a fake Daily Cal before. That led to a frenzied look
around the office for a Daily Cal to copy its masthead.
