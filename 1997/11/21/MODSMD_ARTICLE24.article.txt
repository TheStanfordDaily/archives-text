# Getting a last laugh from 'The Play'
## 
### 
Now that we're finally on the eve of the l(H)th Big
Game, I'm sure everyone has been well-versed on
all the great names and amazing finishes in this
cross-Bay rivalry. No stranger to this list is the 1982 Big
Game, which forever will be defined by "The Flay," the
one with the five laterals, Stanford's band on the field and
Cal radio announcer Joe Starkey capturing the moment
with his immortal call (even if you have no idea from lis
tening to it what exactly transpired).

So, you're Stanford. You've just been felled in the most
bizarre play in the rivalry's history. There's no bowl game
for the Cardinal, and the Axe is in Berkeley. What do you
do to get some measure of revenge?
How about an elaborate hoax by The Stanford Daily?
The erstwhile student newspaper was no stranger to
pulling pranks at the expense of Cal. In some Daily
staffers produced a bogus issue ol the Daily ( alilornian
that had a story declaring the football team ineligible for
collegiate play due to N( A A violations.
Adam Berns "had always talked about that, said
Mark Zeigler, now a sportswriter for the San Diego
Union-Tribune, in reference to the 72 hoax. "From the
time 1 knew him. he just kept talking about it. Alter Ihe
Flav.' he just said It's time.'
The Stanl d Daily was about to further immortalize
an unforgettable moment in the Stanford-C al rivalry. It
was going to piece together a lake Daily ( al with the
screaming headline "NCAA awards Big Game to Stan
ford."

The three main
perpetrators were
sportswriters
Mark Zeigler,
Class of '85. and
Adam Berns <S4.
and entertainment
editor Tony Kelly
\S6. However, this
immortal trio first
had a few prob
lems to overcome,
namely midterms
and ethics â€” in
that order
"It snowballed

pretty quickly,' recalls Kelly, now a director tor the the
ater company Thick Description in San Francisco. I here
was a fake Daily Cal before. That led to a frenzied look
around the office for a Daily Cal to copy its masthead.

That led to thinking if we Ocould do
it physically, and then if we could do
it morally."
Daily Editor in Chief Richard
Klinger was extremely hesitant to
go through with the prank. Torn, he
sought the advice of Tom Mulvoy,
deputy managing editor of The
Boston Globe, who was attending
Stanford as a Knight Fellow. Mul
voy minced no words in his reply,
telling Klinger to "go for it. If you
don't, you'll kick yourself in 20
years."
"I think kindly of the Knight lei
lowship because of that," Kelly said.
So with the approval of the edi
tor in chief and Mulvoy, the three
merry pranksters proceeded to pull
an all nighter on Monday, writing
six stories and three letters to the
editor. Kelly, who was also on the
paper's edit board at the time,
wrote a bogus editorial with a doc
tored editorial cartoon while also
handling layout. Zeiglcr put togetli
er a story allegedly gauging Cal
head coach Joe Kapp's reaction,
making him look like a buffoon.
"Yeah, that was written at like
four in the morning when I was a bit
punchy," Zeigler said, laughing.
But the funniest part had to be
the story announcing the alleged
decision written by Mulvoy him
self along with a box containing a

fake NCAA rule that stated the
means whereby an "injustice"
(which it was) may be corrected.
Accompanying this story was ;i doc
tored photo showing a referee
blowing The Plav' dead.
I 'sing bylines and a staff box ol
nearly identical Daily ( al staffers,
they further added to its alleged
credibility by running an ad that
called for a noon protest rally.
"Although, looking back on it.
the other ad (calling for a 2-for-1
sale at a record store) may have
been the one that caused the
biggest uproar," Kelly said.
So with the deed complete, Xci
gler, Berns and Kelly picked up the
7,000 printed copies and piled into
Kelly's 1971 Plymouth Duster
"with 108,000 miles on it"and
drove up to ( al on the Wednesday
morning before Thanksgiving.
"I ill ink the reason we decided
to take my ear was because il had a
( al sticker on it," Kelly said. Hie
car "used to belong to my brother
who had gone to ( a I for a d;iv be
fore dropping out. Apparently he
was there long enough to buy a
sticker."
112 ortunately, the real Daily Cals
were late, allowing tliein to safely
distribute and wait around to see
the reaction. Screams of "Oh no!"
and other unprintable choice words
were heard muttered around
Berkeley.
Mission accomplished.
"The funniest moment was

when their business manager came
out of the Daily ( al offices and
looked disgusted, Kellv said. "()b
viously, he knew it was a hoax. So
he starts picking up all the copies,
and he just has an absolute arm
load."
"But as lie's talking to a reporter
(who had tagged along with Kelly
and company to see the scope of the
hoax), students kept walking up to
him and taking copies thinking it
was the real thing. That was proba
My the high point."
Hie conquering heroes returned
to the biggest campus reaction this
side of the Immortal 21. Several
news services called, and the San
Francisco ( hronicle ran a front-page
story, declaring that Stanford had
achieved "a soothing last laugh."
So even if the names Moen,
l yrell and Starkey are the ones re
inembered, it was Xeigler, Berns
and Kellv who, for one brie! mo
inent. fooled them all and added
themselves to Big (iame lore.
"When | Berus| was trying to talk
us into doing it." Xeigler said, "he
said *30 years from now, when
we're sitting in my yacht in the
(Ireek Islands, we won't remember
the midterms we failed, but we will
remember the Daily C'al we pro
duced."
I njov the (lame.
Id's note to Bonnie: lllis hoax is
only slightly cooler than Operation
(iumhy I)r<>i>.
