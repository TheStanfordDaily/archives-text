They are.among the Itnest football players to suit
up in Cardinal nihil while. They include an All-Ann 11
can, two of Stanford's .ill time leading rushers and 12
starters in tomorrow's Big (iame against ( ;il
I hey are Stanford football's senior class.
I )uring the lasl three seasons, I his group has helped
the Cardinal earn hack-to-hack Big (iame victories
along with a resounding win in lasl season's Sun Bowl.
"I think thai is one heck ol a contribution." said
coach Tyrone Willingham. "Hopefully they have
he gun to lay a foundation for (he success for this pro
gram over the years."
I he 1 (H)th Big( iame,steeped in tradition and flow
ered with hoopla, often takes time to appreciate. I o
morrow, senior running hack Mike Mitchell and 17 «»l
his teammates will make llus historic contest their last

collegiate lootball game.
"It means so much to be part of
this great tradition over the years,"
Mitchell said. "You're going to see a
lot of seniors going out there and
giving it all. This is our Super Bowl."
Mitchell has spearheaded the
Cardinal rushing attack in the last
two Big Games, totaling 265 yards
rushing on 50 carries. 1 le also ranks
fourth on Stanford's all-time rush
ing yardage list.
Senior defensive end Kailee
Wong has also made his mark
against the Bears, scoring a touch
down on a 53-yard interception re
turn in last season's contest. He cur
rently leads the Pacific 10 Confer
ence with 11 sacks and 21 tackles for
loss, and is the first Cardinal defen
sive lineman to earn All-America
honors since 1976.
"The Big Game is huge," Wong
said, "no matter what the records
might be. or what we've done to this
point. It wouldn't matter if we were
undefeated and they were complete
ly defeated, it would still be huee."

Despite all the Big Game media
saturation, some Cardinal seniors
would have been hard-pressed to
even name Stanford's opponent in
this Bay Area rivalry four years ago.
Growing up in Southern Califor
nia. senior inside linebacker Chris
Draft didn't find out about the Big
Game until he actually arrived on
the Farm.
"I didn't know tin) much about
it." Draft said. "But right when 1 got
here, I heard Cal jokes. When some
thing went badly, people would say
'that's how they do it at Cal' — stuff
like that to let you know there was a
rivalry there."
Senior running back Anthony
Bookman, the Cardinal's third all
time leading rusher, was in for a sur
prise when he made his first visit to
Cal in 1994.
"1 didn't know too much about
the rivalry," Bookman said. "It was
one of the more intense games 1
played in because of the hvpe and
how important it is around here. It
was an eye opener."
Although this season's Big
Game doesn't have the bowl impli
cations it has in the past, a win to
morrow will offer some consolation

for a disappointing season.
"We had so many expectations,"
said senior wide receiver Damon
Dunn. "1 don't think one game can
salvage the entire season. But it can
do a lot for us, more than any other
game this year.
"We are representing a lot of
people, people who played so many
years before us. This game is really
played for those people as well, not
just for us. It's a huge game."
Tomorrow's contest is important
for fans and alumni alike, but it's the
seniors who will retain the most
vivid memories of what transpires at
sold-out Stanford Stadium. For
many Cardinal seniors, the 100 th
Big (iaine will be a fitting end to
their football careers.
"It's hard to convey what it
means," said senior fullback Jon
Ritchie. My entire life has been de
voted to football in a large part. It's
something that I've come to depend
upon. This is my last game. For all
intents and purposes, this is it for
me.
"1 expect that we will play with
tons of emotion and the best we pos
sibly can. because this is our last op
portunity to go out and do it."
