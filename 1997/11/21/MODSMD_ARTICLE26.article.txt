# When Big Game was the only game
## 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
To most of us, what's important
about Big Game is recent history. The
Play in I9N2. John Elway or Jim Plun
kett at quarterback. Twelve seconds to
victory in 1990.
Hut this isn't a story about our wacky
band, nor is it another talc about the
Axe or the Immortal 21.
This is a story about the decade in
which Big Game truly lived up to its
name.
Big (lame's beginnings were humble
enough. When Stanford heard Califor
nia's first football challenge in the fall of
IK91, the ( ardinal captain declined, say
ing his rookie troops weren't prepared.
But the captain left the door open for
a game during the spring semester, and
t he following March, the twosquads met
on the Haight Street Grounds on the
corner of I laight and Stanyan Streets in
San Francisco for a game at 3 p.m.
But by 10 a.m.. thousands had al
ready poured into the city by train and
carriage, outstripping by 10.000 the
5.000 tickets printed.
Forty years later, a 1931 pre-Big
Game Stanford Daily recounted the
story in lurid detail.
"It was a heyday in San Francisco liv
ery stable history every hansom cab,
buckboard and draycart had been mobi
lized. And still there were hardly enough
draught horses to go around. The cable
cars labored mightily. So did the football
teams.
"Here it was — the first Big Football
Game. And no football was in sight. It
was believed that one of the assistant

managers, a moon-faced engineering
student who parted his hair in the mid
die, chap called I foover, I lerh I loover,
had forgotten to bring one along.'
The 1 .S,(KM) onlookers in the grands
tands waited live. 10, then 15 minutes
past the announced starting time as the
hand played through its three-song
repertoire, then started again. I he fans,
demanding attention, began slamming
their feet against the bleachers, creating
a deafening ruckus.
Here accounts of the story diverge.
The 1931 Daily claims that "an obscure
youth" ventured out in the city to un
cover another ball, but all stores and
sporting goods outlets in the area were
padlocked in honor of the game. ()thers
say that a local sporting goods store
owner went to his home and returned
with a ball that resembled a football on
the outside, but the interior lacked an
airbag, which made kicking it a futile ex
ploit.
Stanford went on to win 14-0. Ac
cording to the San Francisco Chronicle
Sporting (ireen's report a day later, the
city was painted an immaculate red,
"while ( alifornia's supporters could be
found all over town drowning their sor
rows."
Despite a colorful first day, the game
went through 30 years of growth before
reaching its heyday in the 19205.
By then, the game had been moved to
the schools' home campuses with the
construction of 15.000-scat grandstands.
Both schools had banned football in
favor of a less violent alternative
rugby - then returned to the gridiron
after World War I.
But with the inauguration of Warren

I larding as president and the dawning of
the roaring '20s. the Big Game earned
unprecedented prestige, which lasted
until the end ol the '30s ;md made ii the
biggest sporting event on the West
( oast.
I cw realize how "big" the BigCiame
was. Although it is just the nation's lOtli
oldest rivalry, it is the oldest on the West
( oast.
Ami in the hast, there was profes
sional baseball and hockey and huge
sporting events like the World Series.
All Palo Alto had was the I'alo Alto
Oaks, a semi professional baseball
team. I he town ol Mayfield had a mu
nicipal ball team before the eitv was
swallowed by the I Jniversity, anil in San
Francisco the ( lass A Seals drew
crowds in the thousands. Paly High
sometimes played women's basketball.
So for all sporting fans on the Penin
sula, the Big (iame was the best and
biggest event this side of the Mississippi.
Stanford responded in 1921 by build
ing the biggest sporting venue wes! of
New York, Stanford Stadium. Spending
$570,000 on the project, the University
took what would become the biggest
step in the explosion ol Big (iame by
creating a stadium that could accommo
date 60, (KM) onlookers.
In the 1921 Big (iame the first
played in Stanford Stadium 62,740
fans packed the brand-new facility, set
ting a West Coast record. I rainload
alter trainload <>l California fans, with
blue and gold streamers anil confetti,
polluted the town and campus with yells
and shouts for their beloved Bears.
They had reason to be exuberant:
their team was the heavy favorite for the

first game in the modern era ol Hii'
(iames, according lo a game-day article
in I lie San I'raneisco Examiner:
"Stanford is to he slaughtered to
make a ( alilornia holiday, according t<>
this dope, and the Inst victorious ser
penline to he staged in the splendid new
stadium will he put oil hy the ( aliloi nia
students and not the Stanford hoys."
The final score was 42-7, ( al.
During the rest of the 2()s, the Rig
(iamc had ;i momentum all its own.
I hrcc years later, in legendary Stan
lord coach Pop Warner's debut, 77.0(H)
people showed up to watch Big (lame in
the newly built Memorial Stadium,
I(),(KK) of them relegated to a free view

from "Tightwad Hill" behind the
field. Rumor had it that a pair of
scalper's tickets went for $ 1(H) in the
parking lot — almost unbelievable
in an era of 15-cent hot dogs and 25-
cent programs.
1926, the best year ever for Stan
ford football, featured one of the
most important Big Games ever,
pitting a 10-0 Cardinal team against
a 10-0 Cal squad. 90,000 people
watched the game, and it was stand
ing room only on "Tightwad 1 fill."

Barring additions to Memorial Sta
dium or Stanford Stadium, the
90,000 attendance benchmark will
never be reached again. Stanford
won the game and went to the Rose
Bowl.
By the end of the '20s, Stanford
and Cal had combined for six Rose
Bowl appearances, and many claim
it would have been eight had the ( al
administration not had a falling out
with the Rose Bowl Selection Com
mittee. Both teams had established
national dominance and earned na
tional recognition. And the gridiron
classic between the teams had
reached its height.

In 1929, the stock market
crashed. With it sank attendance at
and interest in the Big (lame.
And by the time the Depression
ended a decade later, two factors
had already rang the death knell for
the heyday of the Big Game: the in
vent ion of television and the notori
ety of professional football leagues.
So tomorrow's Big (lame will
compete for attention with the
Raiders and 49crs and (iolden State
Warriors, even with the San Jose
Sharks. And although the Stanford
( 'al rivalry can hold its own. its swa\
over the life of the Peninsula
been beaten back.

5.000 tickets printed.
Forty years later, a 1931 pre-Big
Game Stanford Daily recounted the
story in lurid detail.
"It was a heyday in San Francisco liv
ery stable history every hansom cab,
buckboard and draycart had been mobi
lized. And still there were hardly enough
draught horses to go around. The cable
cars labored mightily. So did the football
teams.
"Here it was — the first Big Football
Game. And no football was in sight. It
was believed that one of the assistant

managers, a moon-faced engineering
student who parted his hair in the mid
die, chap called I foover, I lerh I loover,
had forgotten to bring one along.'
The 1 .S,(KM) onlookers in the grands
tands waited live. 10, then 15 minutes
past the announced starting time as the
hand played through its three-song
repertoire, then started again. I he fans,
demanding attention, began slamming
their feet against the bleachers, creating
a deafening ruckus.
Here accounts of the story diverge.
The 1931 Daily claims that "an obscure
youth" ventured out in the city to un
cover another ball, but all stores and
sporting goods outlets in the area were
padlocked in honor of the game. ()thers
say that a local sporting goods store
owner went to his home and returned
with a ball that resembled a football on
the outside, but the interior lacked an
airbag, which made kicking it a futile ex
ploit.
Stanford went on to win 14-0. Ac
cording to the San Francisco Chronicle
Sporting (ireen's report a day later, the
city was painted an immaculate red,
"while ( alifornia's supporters could be
found all over town drowning their sor
rows."
Despite a colorful first day, the game
went through 30 years of growth before
reaching its heyday in the 19205.
By then, the game had been moved to
the schools' home campuses with the
construction of 15.000-scat grandstands.
Both schools had banned football in
favor of a less violent alternative
rugby - then returned to the gridiron
after World War I.
But with the inauguration of Warren

I larding as president and the dawning of
the roaring '20s. the Big Game earned
unprecedented prestige, which lasted
until the end ol the '30s ;md made ii the
biggest sporting event on the West
( oast.
I cw realize how "big" the BigCiame
was. Although it is just the nation's lOtli
oldest rivalry, it is the oldest on the West
( oast.
Ami in the hast, there was profes
sional baseball and hockey and huge
sporting events like the World Series.
All Palo Alto had was the I'alo Alto
Oaks, a semi professional baseball
team. I he town ol Mayfield had a mu
nicipal ball team before the eitv was
swallowed by the I Jniversity, anil in San
Francisco the ( lass A Seals drew
crowds in the thousands. Paly High
sometimes played women's basketball.
So for all sporting fans on the Penin
sula, the Big (iame was the best and
biggest event this side of the Mississippi.
Stanford responded in 1921 by build
ing the biggest sporting venue wes! of
New York, Stanford Stadium. Spending
$570,000 on the project, the University
took what would become the biggest
step in the explosion ol Big (iame by
creating a stadium that could accommo
date 60, (KM) onlookers.
In the 1921 Big (iame the first
played in Stanford Stadium 62,740
fans packed the brand-new facility, set
ting a West Coast record. I rainload
alter trainload <>l California fans, with
blue and gold streamers anil confetti,
polluted the town and campus with yells
and shouts for their beloved Bears.
They had reason to be exuberant:
their team was the heavy favorite for the

first game in the modern era ol Hii'
(iames, according lo a game-day article
in I lie San I'raneisco Examiner:
"Stanford is to he slaughtered to
make a ( alilornia holiday, according t<>
this dope, and the Inst victorious ser
penline to he staged in the splendid new
stadium will he put oil hy the ( aliloi nia
students and not the Stanford hoys."
The final score was 42-7, ( al.
During the rest of the 2()s, the Rig
(iamc had ;i momentum all its own.
I hrcc years later, in legendary Stan
lord coach Pop Warner's debut, 77.0(H)
people showed up to watch Big (lame in
the newly built Memorial Stadium,
I(),(KK) of them relegated to a free view

from "Tightwad Hill" behind the
field. Rumor had it that a pair of
scalper's tickets went for $ 1(H) in the
parking lot — almost unbelievable
in an era of 15-cent hot dogs and 25-
cent programs.
1926, the best year ever for Stan
ford football, featured one of the
most important Big Games ever,
pitting a 10-0 Cardinal team against
a 10-0 Cal squad. 90,000 people
watched the game, and it was stand
ing room only on "Tightwad 1 fill."

Barring additions to Memorial Sta
dium or Stanford Stadium, the
90,000 attendance benchmark will
never be reached again. Stanford
won the game and went to the Rose
Bowl.
By the end of the '20s, Stanford
and Cal had combined for six Rose
Bowl appearances, and many claim
it would have been eight had the ( al
administration not had a falling out
with the Rose Bowl Selection Com
mittee. Both teams had established
national dominance and earned na
tional recognition. And the gridiron
classic between the teams had
reached its height.

In 1929, the stock market
crashed. With it sank attendance at
and interest in the Big (lame.
And by the time the Depression
ended a decade later, two factors
had already rang the death knell for
the heyday of the Big Game: the in
vent ion of television and the notori
ety of professional football leagues.
So tomorrow's Big (lame will
compete for attention with the
Raiders and 49crs and (iolden State
Warriors, even with the San Jose
Sharks. And although the Stanford
( 'al rivalry can hold its own. its swa\
over the life of the Peninsula
been beaten back.
