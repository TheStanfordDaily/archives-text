## 
### T.J. Babbitt Contributing writer 
Hie Israeli and Palestinian peo
ple have been betrayed by their own
leaders, who are not committed to
achieving a lasting peace. That's
what Prof. I ouad Moughrabi of the
University ol I cnnessce told his au
dience dm iiif a speech co sp(msored
by the < )rgani/alion ol Arab Stu
dents in Slanloid and Stanford Is
rael Alliance.
Moui'luahi said that both Israelis
and Palestinians yearn lor peace but
that I heir leaders do not represent
lliis need.
I Ic called the Palestinian Author
it) "a vci \ shabby little authoritarian
dictatorship with a patronage system
ol the worst kind." I he Palestinian
people need and deserve a better
leadei than Yasser Aralat, he said.
Mut Moughrabi was equally hor
i ilied by the polkies ol Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
" I here are many Israelis who are
not like Nctam ;ihu, who are serious

about peace, who are outraged, who
are saddened by what's going on,"
he said.
Moughrabi challenged the audi
ence to help support leaders and
politicians who are genuinely com
mitted to peace.
"You must support those people
who are working for peace. Give us
some more choices than we have,"
he pleaded.
()ASIS and the Israel Alliance in
vited Moughrabi to speak in part to
challenge their own members to
enter into a dialogue about how
Middle East peace could be
achieved. Moughrabi himself lauded
the groups for working together. But
he said that the current atmosphere
surrounding the peace process is
"depressing and dismal."
For most of the talk, Moughrabi
concentrated on the plight of Pales
tinians living in Israeli occupied ter
ritories. He painted a picture of de
spair for the Palestinian residents of
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
I Ic said that Israel had closed the

West Bank to border crossings for 73
days since January, costing the
Palestinian economy between $4
million and $6 million a day and in
creasing unemployment, already
around 30 percent.
In some ways, he said, the situa
tion on the Gaza Strip is even worse.
"There are people on the Ga/a Strip
who are starving," he said. "This is a
new phenomenon."
In response to a question about
the future status of Israel and Pales
tine, Moughrabi said that a separate
Palestinian state might now be im
possible and could exist in name
only.
"It wouldn't have any geographi
cal continuity to it,"he said, adding
that for better or worse the two com
munities are inextricably linked.
Israel might need to move away
from being "a state of the Jewish
people, not of its own citizens" and
instead become "not a Jewish state,
not an Arab state, but a state of two
peoples with equal rights," he
added.
