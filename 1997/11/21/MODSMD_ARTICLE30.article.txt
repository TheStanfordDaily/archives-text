# Casper, Rice to lead Big Game cheers; Dollies upset
## 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
Just when you were getting used to the new style of
"cheerleaders" — those Ciilligan look-alikes in red shirts
and fishermen's hats who incite the audience to yell
things like "kill, maim, dismember" much to the chagrin
of vegans everywhere - the administration, under direct
executive order from University President Gerhard
Casper, has decided that their "lackluster shenanigans
just aren't enough to truly convey the fighting spirit
which Stanford cherishes."
Instead, Casper said, four of the University's top
administrators — Casper himself, Provost Condoleezza
Rice, Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya
and new Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Robert
Kinnally — will tackle the task of leading the audience
in various cheers at tomorrow's 100 th Big Game.
"It would be too much of a risk to leave such an
important game in the hands of such an inexperienced
squad of cheerleaders," Casper said. "With the exception
of Mob |Kinnallyj, we've all been here long enough to
know what an audience wants from its cheerleaders. We
come from many different backgrounds but have all had

that Stanford gumption flowing through our veins for
years."
Asked about the relative inexperience of Kinnally,
Casper responded, "Well, we only invited Mob along
because we did not want to hurt his feelings. It seemed
like the right thing to do."
Although the four administrators are usually seen
performing mundane duties like giving speeches, dis
cussing issues with students or occasionally sharing a
stage with damned souls and Mob Marker, Casper said he
wanted to assure the student body that each is very capa
ble of carrying out the duties of a cheerleader. And their
credentials are impressive indeed.
Montoya, an avid bungee jumper, has had extensive
training in acrobatics and hand-to-hand combat. He is
serving as choreographer for the group.
"I wanted to spice things up a bit," Montoya said.
"At all the football games I've watched the cheerleaders
and thought, 'All that jumping and running around is
fine, but where's the high wire? Where are the trapezes?'
Now I can finally show everyone what real cheerleading
is all about."
Rice concurred with Montoya's optimism, citing as
her work experience numerous journeys guiding armies

of elephants through the Himalayas and foiling attempts
at world domination by malicious Girl Scouts.
"I don't see how we can go wrong here. I mean, with
Jim [MontoyaJ's wicked choreography, and Gerhard's
beautiful singing voice, there's no way the audience can
resist our charms."
Asked about any apprehension at this, the four
some's first public performance, Rice said, "I'm not ner
vous in the least. We're ready to roast the Weenies into
kingdom come."
The group has not yet decided what they will wear
to distinguish themselves as a unit, but they don't seem
worried, even with kick-off approaching quickly.
"We can always go back to our original idea of sea
shells and hula skirts," Kinnally said, "but we might also
get sequined gowns and pearl necklaces. You'll just have
to wait and see."
Kinnally, who said he lias no previous experience
which could be applied to this sort of performance, is
uncertain of what his role will be during the game.
"Gerhard said he had something spectacular lined
up for me," Kinnally said. "I'm sure it'll be a blast."
Casper agreed to disclose his plans for Kinnally,
saying with a wink and a nod, "We're going to shoot him
out of a cannon."
