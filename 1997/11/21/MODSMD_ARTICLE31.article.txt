# THE 						SKIPPY LETTERS:
## INSIDE THE MIND OF A FOOTBALL PLAYER! 
### 
Some of us wonder about the creation of the Universe. Others wonder how they can pick locks
and make their way into the homes of their loved ones. And yet there are those of us who won
der what exactly is going on in the minds of other people. So in order to satisfy this craving —
this curiosity, thisy'e ne sais quoi — Diversions has pilfered the e-mail of several Stanford stu
dents in order to get a glimpse at what's going on in their heads. In honor of Big Game, we start
this week with "Letters from a Foot ball Player," to be followed next week by "Letters from an a
capella whore" and"Letters from a Resident Assistant Having a Heated Affair with a Fresh
man."
The following is the undoctored, uncensored, unedited e-mail from Stanford football player
Stanislavik Komadinak (names have been changed to ensure privacy) to his coach.

Dear Coach,
I'm thrilled to be a part of Stanford's
prestigious football team. Back home in
Wisconsin I grew up idolizing the Cardi
nal boys and am mighty glad to be play
ing in this team. Look forward to starting
practice soon.
Yours Truly,
Dear Coach,
I tried on my new uniform yesterday and
I have to say it's quite constricting and
doesn't have much flair to it. Would it be
too much tiouble if I stitched a giant flag
of Australia on the back of my nelmet? I
think it might help me play better. Thank
you.
Yours Truly,
Dear Coach,
I hove to say I'm a bit disappointed that
you shot down my idea of reciting Walt
Whitman to the team to inspire us during
half-time I, for one can't not think of ola
Walt whenever I'm on the field, brushing
shoulder to shoulder against some talf,
masculine comrade, bumping into one
another, fallina on top of each other,
reaching out for thighs and legs and
pecs, and sometimes our faces so close,
upart only by the grid of our helmets, our
breaths mixing together and the smell of
sweat Really!
A bit peeved,

Dear Coach,
I'm writing to express the offense I took
when you told us, as part of our pep talk,
to "go out and trounce those bastards."
As a pacifist who does not believe in the
dismemberment of my fellow Earth co
habiters (even if they are Cal-boys), I felt
that my sense of self and being was
being intruded upon and that I was
expected to behave in a manner other
than the prescribed to me by own
biorhythms and mental proclivities. And
I'm not just talking granola, but I serious
ly think we could profit from doing some
meditation exercises before each game.
Hurt and upset,
Dear Coach,
I'm writing to express my embarrassment
at completely misinterpreting what you
meant when you said, "Skippy, go to the
shower!" I have to say Joey is equally
embarrassed, though not as much as I
am since apparently he has done this
before, though not during the season
and never right in the middle of a game.
A bit red on the face,
Dear Coach,
I'm writing to suggest an activity to
replace our regular practice sessions.
See, I had this idea of us having a "rap"
session, during which we woula sit in a
circle and go around sharing our
thoughts ana feelings, and expressing
our mutual support and what not. After

ward we would have a group hug and
then ioin the basketball players coming
out or their consciousness-raising meet
ing. I'm not sure how the other team
members would feel about this, but I
think it's worth a shot.
Yours,
Dear Coach,
I'm writing to complain about the team
member who called me a "fairy" during
the game this morning. I personally have
nothing against those whimsical, magical
creatures who miraculously bring peo
ple's wishes to life and are able to fly,
etc., but I do resent this fellow player's
suggestion that I may be playing for the
opposite team, since I very much proved
my loyalty to our team during that mas
sage session last week. Aside from that,
my work is going well, and I look forward
to our upcoming trip to Disneyland,
Yours indeed,
Dear Coach,
I'm writing to say that I'm quitting the
team. Please don't be angry at me, but I
really hit it off with Mickey over heie at
Disneyland, and things are going well.
Yours nevermore,
Skippy



True Love Doesn't Wait:
Top, two football players let go
of societal constrictions to real
ize the warmth and affection they
feel for each other. It's a moment
right out of a Barry Manilow
song.
