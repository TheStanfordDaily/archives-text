# PERSPECTIVES ON BIG GAME
## 
### 
Three members of the Stanford
community share some thoughts
on Big Game: a Donner frosh, a
grad student and a sewage rat.

Donner is having a
big pep rally over at Stern
because Donner loooves
football and haaaates Cal!
Go Stanford! Go Stanford!
We have so much pep and
spirit! Go Stanford! Yieee!
We'll be No. 1! Numero
uno! We rock! We love ya,
Stanford! We have so much
spirit! We're so happy here!
Wait, what am I saying?
Didn't I just break up with

my boyfriend last night? Wasn't I crying till
three in the morning? That's right. Ar 4 plus I
got a C- in my first midterm, and there's no
chance in hell I can pass Chem and I won't get
into med school and, oh! Plus no one here under
stands me. No one cares about the real me! I
have no real friends! Shit, I'm so depressed; I
think I have to call the Bridge. Excuse me.

It's all about
mind control,
man. They trick us
into thinking this is
some sort of terrific,
great event when
it's about as excit
ing as my grand
mother farting at
Thanksgiving din
ner. They're pump
ing up our expecta
tions so we'll think
this is historical or
something, when in
fact it's just pure

manipulation — and if I wanted manipulation,
I'd go over to my former girlfriend's and talk to
her for an hour, OK° Shit, I have to go. I have all
these papers to grade. I hate Psych 1.

Now Big Game.
OK, problems arise
with the name itself.
It's supposed to be
big, right? And this
emphasis on size is
just a way of asserting
power, control and
supremacy, right?
And who's getting
crushed at the bot
tom? I think it's us,
all of us little people
under five feet. Foot-

ball is just as way to keep the people down, I say!
Down with football! Down with little people!
Down, down, down! Why can't we change the
name of the game? Why not "Little" Game? Or
even "Medium" Game? Or "Not-Quite-That-Big-
But-Getting-There" Game? Shouldn't we be
more inclusive? A little more sensitive? I tell ya,
some of us just ain't tall enough to reach that
high shelf.
