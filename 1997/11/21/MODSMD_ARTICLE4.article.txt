Students representing the Student
Coalition to Tenure Karen Sawislak met
yesterday with Viee Provost and I )ean for
Student Affairs James Montoya in an at
tempt to get him to speak for their cause.
Montoya said he would present their
case to Provost Condoleezza Rice, who is
currently considering Asst. History Prof.
Karen Savvislak's tenure grievance.
"Montova has the ability to at least put

these issues into the faculty dialogue,"
said Melissa I loover. a senior.
That w;is an important goal for the
group because students have no formal
voice or role in the tenure process, except
insofar as teaching evaluations are con
sidered in the original tenure application..
Montoya said that he recognized "the
important role women and minority fac
ulty play in the mentoring of undergradu
ate and graduate students at Stanford."
Hut he also emphasized, "1 am not in
volved with the tenure process."

Students said they hope that he ean
help them anyway.
"We're counting on him to advocate
for our concerns," said I loover.
Sawislak was recommended for tenure
by the History Department this spring but
the deans of the School of Humanities
and Sciences turned down her applica
tion. Rice is considering the appeal.
While the coalition is focusing for the
time being 011 Sawislak's case, members


Montoya
say that they are interested in chang
ing a system they say is unfair to stu
dents. junioi laeulty and minorities.
Under the current system, they
sav. junioi faeultv members are re

warded for not devoting much time
to mentoring students so as to focus
on publishablc research. Also, mem
bers say that too much emphasis is
given to recruiting established "star"
faculty members from other schools
rather than nurturing Stanford's ju
nior faculty members.
" There is a real morale problem
with the junior faculty," said Chuck

Carlson, a third-year doctoral stu
dent. "Eventually, it's going to be a
problem in recruiting."
Vera Grant, a first-year doctoral
student, agreed, and said it was not
enough to have a diverse population
of graduate students and junior fac
ulty members if these people were
not going to move into the I Jniversi
ty's higher ranks.
