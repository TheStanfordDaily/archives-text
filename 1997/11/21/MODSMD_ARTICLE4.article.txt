Students representing the Student
Coalition to Tenure Karen Sawislak met
yesterday with Viee Provost and I )ean for
Student Affairs James Montoya in an at
tempt to get him to speak for their cause.
Montoya said he would present their
case to Provost Condoleezza Rice, who is
currently considering Asst. History Prof.
Karen Savvislak's tenure grievance.
"Montova has the ability to at least put

these issues into the faculty dialogue,"
said Melissa I loover. a senior.
That w;is an important goal for the
group because students have no formal
voice or role in the tenure process, except
insofar as teaching evaluations are con
sidered in the original tenure application..
Montoya said that he recognized "the
important role women and minority fac
ulty play in the mentoring of undergradu
ate and graduate students at Stanford."
Hut he also emphasized, "1 am not in
volved with the tenure process."

Students said they hope that he ean
help them anyway.
"We're counting on him to advocate
for our concerns," said I loover.
Sawislak was recommended for tenure
by the History Department this spring but
the deans of the School of Humanities
and Sciences turned down her applica
tion. Rice is considering the appeal.
While the coalition is focusing for the
time being 011 Sawislak's case, members
