Stanford students, before securi
ty started its heavy patrols, also had
a tradition of painting red the "S"
and"I J" of the "South San Franeis
co" sign on the hill visible from
Highway 101.
Not all successful prank stories
become public knowledge in the
year — or even the decade. "If
you're lucky or smart, you don't get
caught," said I)on Williams, ('lass of
*41.1 le speaks from experience.
In 1940, Williams, a varsity bas
ketball player and Paul "Red" Fay,

tary of the Navy, crept into Berkeley
stadium and sawed four-fifths of the
way through the steel goalposts. The
next day.the winning Stanford stu
dents were then able to bring down
the posts. Until now. the Stanford
students' strength was a mystery.
Of course, UC-Berkeley also has
its prank stories, but. in the words of
Erickson, "there really haven't been
too many good ones by Cal."
UC-Berkeley students have
stuck to more traditional methods:
spray-painting bear claws, putting
up Cal posters and showering the
campus with fliers with messages
like "Fuck Stanford."
In the mid-60's, Cal students did
pull some clever stunts. I'hey released
.SO to 1(X) blue-dved mice at a C laieties

performance. Chaos ensued. Some
7>()s ('al students also used a flare gun
to light the Stanford Big Game bon
fire early one year. The shooter was
severely beaten and was only saved
by police intervention.
In addition to the risk of vio
lence. pranks can also cause mainte
nance headaches. "A prank [involv
ing clean-up] hurts the faculty and
the students, because it means
money being used that could be
spent elsewhere," said Bruce Wig
gins. work systems manager in Fa
cilities Operations.
Due to possible hazards, the Axe
( ommittee has agreed to not partic
ipate in organized pranks. "The Axe
Committee is not organized to rape
and pillage." said Ericksoo.
