Back in the 60 s when Stan
ford fans did card stunts and tear
gas was a common commodity, a
violent prank battle broke out be
tween the Weenies and Stanford
students.
It all started when a group of
UC-Berkeley pranksters came to
campus and stole the Stanford
stunt cards — around 12,000 to
15,000 cards in total — used by
Stanford fans to visually assault
the Cal side of the stadium.
In response, angry Stanford
students drove to Berkeley and

swiped the Cal cannon.
Cal returned the favor by
stealing a Stanford banner. (Inci
dentally, that very same banner
hung in last night's Big Game
rally.)
Anyway, the stealing contin
ued to escalate in the days before
the Big Game.
Both schools' spirit leaders fi
nally called for a repatriation; each
side agreed to meet and swap all
the stolen goods.
Cal students loaded all the
Stanford items onto the back of a

pick-up truck and drove to the
meeting place.
Stanford students, however,
had no intention of giving up their
trophies. They just wanted to get
back the stolen Stanford items.
So. when the Cal truck arrived,
the Stanford students broke into
the Cal truck cab with a hammer
and sprayed tear gas on the Wee
nies inside
The Cal students amazingly
came prepared They reached
down and grabbed their gas
masks... and their gun. Needless

to say, the Weenies escaped with
the Stanford goods.
Atter this incident, representa
tives trom each side finally, sin
cerely agreed that a truce really
did need to be made
The result was the Castle Lane
Treaty. Students from both schools
met at the Castle Lane Bowling
Alley and pledged in writing to give
back the stolen goods
All was returned, and history
was made. To this day. both
schools hold copies of the Castle
Lane Treaty
