Introducing a
healthy tax break
for the
self-employed.
If you're self-employed, you can always
use another tax break. Now you may
be able to lower your taxes while
getting affordable, high-quality health
care coverage — with the new Blue
Shield of California MSA-eligible
Preferred Savings Plan.
Join the Preferred Savings Plan, and if
you're eligible, you may qualify for a
Medical Savings Account (MSA)
which works like an Deposit pre
tax dollars in your MSA, then use
them for medical services as needed.
And, any money you don't use can
grow — so you can actually make
money on your health care dollars.
Plus, when you choose the Preferred
Savings Plan, you will have access to
Blue Shield's popular Preferred
Provider Organization (PPO),
comprehensive coverage, and
preventative care services.
The Preferred Savings Plan is not an
MSA, it is a high deductible plan. You
must separately establish an MSA. If
you plan to purchase this plan to use
with an MSA for tax purposes, you
should consult with your tax advisor
about whether you are eligible and
whether your MSA meets legal
requirements.
But act now, because participation in
MSA's are limited to the first 750,000
who qualify nationwide. For more
details, call today.
Although Blue Shield believes that the Preferred Savings Plan meets the governments requirements for a
high deductible plan, the Internal Revenue Service has not ruled on whether the plan is qualified as a
high deductible plan.
Hurry! Limited enrollment.
