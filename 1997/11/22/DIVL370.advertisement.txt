85th Big Game
"The Play" Stanford kicker Mark Harmon's field goal gives the Cardinal a 20-
19 lead with four seconds left. Harmon squibs the kick and Cal rover Kevin Moen
recovers. He laterals to Richard Rodgers, who laterals to Dwight Garner. Gamer
laterals back to Rodgers. Everyone thinks Garner's knee is down, and Stanford
students and band storm the field. Rodgers keeps going and later
als to Mariet Ford, who runs to the 25 and passes it over his shoul- . vvL #
der back to Moen. Moen weaves through the band and into the end
zone, taking down trombone player Gary Tyrell. Arguably the most
infamous finish in college football history. Also, Stanford's first year
as the "Cardinal"
