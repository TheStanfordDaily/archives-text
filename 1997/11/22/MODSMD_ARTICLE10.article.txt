# Fighting spirit not diminished by shrinking bonfire
## 
### Eric Harp 
Cardinal fans have watched the Big Game
Bonfire shrink by the year.
While the flames reached a height 0f250 feet
in 1985, the fire has gotten smaller and smaller
since.
In 1993 the Axe Committee held a laser light
show instead of the traditional bonfire. In 1994
and 1995, scaled-down versions of the fire were
held at Arrillaga Ampitheatre. Last year, Stan
ford fans were forced to huddle around a small
fire on Wilbur Field.
This year, Stanford students will gather
around a 64-cubic-foot fire in the amphitheater.
None of these events were quite as successful as
the traditional Lake Lagunita bonfires to say
the least.
Could it be that the Cardinal football players'
spirits are diminishing with the fire?
According to redshirt sophomore flanker
Troy Walters, the team's Cardinal spirits are on
fire little bonfire or big. Walters, who said he
enjoyed last year's small bonfire, remembers the
event as having a good turnout, despite the poor
weather.
"I was never here for the big one, so for me it
makes no difference if [the bonfire] is small," he
said. "But it seems like we still get a lot of people
there, even if it's little."
The big bonfire was canceled due to environ
mental concerns centering around the tiger sala
mander, which lives in the lake's sandbanks. A
study conducted by Stanford's Center for Con
servation Biology showed that the fire negative
ly impacted at least 13 percent of the salaman
ders. As a result, the University decided that the
lakebed fire caused too much of an environ
mental hazard.
As the 100 th Big Game drew nearer, the de
bate over the Lake Lagunita bonfire was fueled
by the day. On one side, there are those who be
lieve the bonfire serves no real purpose, that the
environmental danger makes it more trouble
than it's worth. On the other hand, there are
those who think the Big Game Bonfire is the ul
timate way of showing support for the team.
Often overlooked are the team members
themselves, and what they think about the bon
fire.
The last time a bonfire was held in Lake La
gunita was in 1992, before any of the current
players were students.
"I'm upset that there isn't one, because it
would be a great thing to have," said redshirt
sophomore guard Joe Fairchild. "All of the pic
tures that I've seen of it make it look pretty
amazing."
While Fairchild wished he could have experi
enced the Stanford tradition, he said he believes
the University is acting in the best interests of the
Stanford community.
"A big bonfire would get you more fired up,
but I'm not sure if it would affect attendance at
the game in any way," he said. "As a player in
general, support is good, however it comes."
