# The 						story behind the lumberman's tool
## The 						Axe: strength, desire, pride, competition, fun, rivalry, tradition 
### Tomoeh Murakami Editorial staff 
For many years, a symbol of pride, power and dedication
has traveled back and forth across the Bay. It is with great
honor that the victor of Big Game boasts ownership of the
Stanford Axe for a year.
What exactly is the story behind the tradition?
The history of the Big Game trophy dates back to 1899,
when the Stanford yell-leading squad decided it had to come
up with an object a token of fiery rivalry that would ig
nite spirit among the student body and boost Cardinal teams
to victory.
The most popular cheer at the time was called the Axe yell,
put together by Will Irwin ('9B) and Chris Bradley ('01) in
1896. The yell group, having agreed that an ax would be the
perfect instrument to rally a forceful cheer, purchased a stan
dard lumberman's planing ax. It weighed 10 pounds and
flaunted a glistening 15-inch blade. The handle was painted
red, and the Stanford Axe was born.
The Axe made its debut within the Stanford community
when it was ceremoniously sharpened at a bonfire rally held
for a Cal-Stanford baseball tournament in April 1899. There,
the big, beat-up Axe was used to chop off the head of a life
sized Bear doll. It is said that as the head rolled onto the
ground and toward the feet of hundreds of Cardinal fans gath
ered there, the crowd let loose the loudest, greatest Axe yell
in Stanford history.
But a group of Cal students succeeded in stealing the Axe
as it was paraded in the streets of San Francisco after the base
ball game held on 16th and Harrison Streets.
Three Bears fled with the Stanford symbol, with hundreds
of students from both schools hot at their heels. The Axe was
passed to Cal quarterback Jimmy Hopper and track star Billy
Drum before it was inconspicuously carried on a ferry across
the Bay to Berkeley.
Although California students first put the Axe in a frater
nity house, they eventually took further precautions and
stored it behind the heavy doors of a vault at a bank near cam
pus. It remained there for the next several decades, taken out
only at the Spring Rally in Cal's Greek Theater.
As the years passed, so did Stanford's resentment, and nu
merous attempts to retrieve the Axe followed —ranging from
outrageous raves to the bank to carefully planned schemes in
which Stanford students faked a front as Cal students, at
tempting to inch close to the Axe at their annual rally.
One of these attempts, in 1930, was a success. The story of
the Immortal 21 when 21 Stanford students, armed with
tear gas, bravely took on hundreds of Bears to bring the Stan
ford Axe home has become a legend in Big Game history.
Soon after, the presidents of the two Bay Area schools sat
down and outlined what would become tradition for the years

to follow: beginning with the 1933 Big Game, the Axe would
become the annual trophy to be retained by the winning team
until the next matchup.
With each brave attempt to retrieve the Axe, a new story
surrounding the symbol was born. By the time the agreement
came about, the Stanford Axe indeed had become a symbol
of pride, strength, honor and dedication.
What does the Axe mean to Cardinal athletes and fans
today? Here is a look at what some Stanford voices had to say
about the legendary Axe:
"The Axe is about school pride and tradition."
Junior Jeff Cronshagen, left tackle
"It's the symbol of domination of Cal Weenies."
Junior Tony Vella, defensive end
"Power."
Fifth-year senior Jeff Byrdj running back

"The winner gets it."
Sophomore Troy Walters, flanker
"It's a symbol of athleticism, historical pride... and a Golden
Bear ass-whupping."
—Junior Jen Carr, track and field
"The history behind it is what makes the Axe so meaningful.
Already, I have a feel for how important the Axe is to the Ath
letic Department, the Stanford athletes and the students.
Sophomore Tony Schrager, baseball
"We kick Axe. The Axe is symbolic of Stanford's superiority
over Cal's inferiority. It's also a cut-throat realization on Cal's
behalf that Stanford's better."
Junior Josh Hochgesang, baseball
"It's ours."
Ted Leland, athletic director
"As is known all too well, a taint on my record is the fact that
I was, for two very long years, 1964-66, on the faculty at Cal.
When Cal lost the Big Games of 1964 and 1965,1 learned that,
as far as Stanford was concerned, 'giving 'em the Axe' meant
keeping the Axe. I decided Berkeley was not for me and
began my long journey to Stanford via Chicago. Let's keep
the Axe! Go Stanford!"
Resident Gerhard Casper
"The Axe is the physical manifestation of the rivalry and spir
it that has always existed between Stanford and that other
school, the University of California at Berkeley (the Wee

nies!). As with so many things throughout the years, (and sure
to remain through perpetuity), the story of the Axe shows just
how much the other school has always wanted that which be
longs to Stanford."
Marc Wais, Dean of Students
"The Axe is our only devisor between success and failure. It is
the difference between cherry pie and dirt. The cherry filling
is so sweet; the dirt just tastes like crap. When I dream, I see
the Axe floating in a black abyss, Cal hands trying to grab at
its handle. I cry out in a scream of rage and wake up. We can
not let that happen. Next week, I want to dream of leafy limbs
snuggling up close with that shiny symbol of Stanford pride."
Sophomore Matt Merrill, the Tree
"The Axe is like the golden fleece. Like Jason of Argonaunt
fame, I would journey the treacherous seas for it. Once found,
I would maraude through crowds of innocent children, hack
ing and slaying, letting the blood of my enemies whet my
parched lips. It would be better than the Ideal Gas Law (I
mean, does pv REALLY equal nrt?)."
Junior Chris Carey, ex-Tree (1996-97)
"The Axe to me represents strength, desire, pride, competi
tion, rivalry, fun and tradition. The Axe is a tangible object
that allows Stanford / Cal fans, faculty, alumni and students to
be connected throughout the history of the two schools.
Times and trends may change, but the Axe stays the same
through the years. Young and old can identify with the Axe
and its history. Also, I would like to point out it's red for a rea
son."
Senior Chris Bonzon, ex-Tree (1995-96)

For many years, a symbol of pride, power and dedication
has traveled back and forth across the Bay. It is with great

What exactly is the story behind the tradition?
The history of the Big Game trophy dates back to 1899,

the Immortal 21 when 21 Stanford students, armed with
tear gas, bravely took on hundreds of Bears to bring the Stan
ford Axe home has become a legend in Big Game history.

came about, the Stanford Axe indeed had become a symbol
of pride, strength, honor and dedication.
What does the Axe mean to Cardinal athletes and fans
today? Here is a look at what some Stanford voices had to say
about the legendary Axe:
"The Axe is about school pride and tradition."
Junior Jeff Cronshagen, left tackle
"It's the symbol of domination of Cal Weenies."
Junior Tony Vella, defensive end
"Power."
Fifth-year senior Jeff Byrdj running back

"The winner gets it."
Sophomore Troy Walters, flanker
"It's a symbol of athleticism, historical pride... and a Golden
Bear ass-whupping."
—Junior Jen Carr, track and field
"The history behind it is what makes the Axe so meaningful.
Already, I have a feel for how important the Axe is to the Ath
letic Department, the Stanford athletes and the students.
Sophomore Tony Schrager, baseball
"We kick Axe. The Axe is symbolic of Stanford's superiority
over Cal's inferiority. It's also a cut-throat realization on Cal's
behalf that Stanford's better."
Junior Josh Hochgesang, baseball
"It's ours."
Ted Leland, athletic director
"As is known all too well, a taint on my record is the fact that
I was, for two very long years, 1964-66, on the faculty at Cal.
When Cal lost the Big Games of 1964 and 1965,1 learned that,
as far as Stanford was concerned, 'giving 'em the Axe' meant
keeping the Axe. I decided Berkeley was not for me and
began my long journey to Stanford via Chicago. Let's keep
the Axe! Go Stanford!"
Resident Gerhard Casper
"The Axe is the physical manifestation of the rivalry and spir
it that has always existed between Stanford and that other
school, the University of California at Berkeley (the Wee

nies!). As with so many things throughout the years, (and sure
to remain through perpetuity), the story of the Axe shows just
how much the other school has always wanted that which be
longs to Stanford."
Marc Wais, Dean of Students
"The Axe is our only devisor between success and failure. It is
the difference between cherry pie and dirt. The cherry filling
is so sweet; the dirt just tastes like crap. When I dream, I see
the Axe floating in a black abyss, Cal hands trying to grab at
its handle. I cry out in a scream of rage and wake up. We can
not let that happen. Next week, I want to dream of leafy limbs
snuggling up close with that shiny symbol of Stanford pride."
Sophomore Matt Merrill, the Tree
"The Axe is like the golden fleece. Like Jason of Argonaunt
fame, I would journey the treacherous seas for it. Once found,
I would maraude through crowds of innocent children, hack
ing and slaying, letting the blood of my enemies whet my
parched lips. It would be better than the Ideal Gas Law (I
mean, does pv REALLY equal nrt?)."
Junior Chris Carey, ex-Tree (1996-97)
"The Axe to me represents strength, desire, pride, competi
tion, rivalry, fun and tradition. The Axe is a tangible object
that allows Stanford / Cal fans, faculty, alumni and students to
be connected throughout the history of the two schools.
Times and trends may change, but the Axe stays the same
through the years. Young and old can identify with the Axe
and its history. Also, I would like to point out it's red for a rea
son."
Senior Chris Bonzon, ex-Tree (1995-96)
