# The 						100th Big game:
## A 						chance to reflect on school history 
### Amy Lo 
It's the 100 th time it's been said
and heard that it's the 100 th Big
Game. Just how many different an
gles can be explored? A historical
overview, a player profile, an alum
ni tale from '62, an interview with
the almighty popsicle vendor of
Stanford stadium!
So what's really the Big Deal
about Big Game this year? It seems
to be obvious. The immortal 1-dou
ble-0, the mystique of the round
number 100.
As sophomore Alex Roetter
put it, "The 100 th Big Game. Well,
it's an even number and it's divisi
ble by a lot of other numbers. Not
like those stupid prime numbers.
Like that damn 73."
But Big Game's epochal shift to
the realm of triple-digit status does
hold a lot more meaning than just
pure numerology.
From the start, Stanford has just
always had to buck the trend.
Rather than be cast in that stodgy
Ivy-shaped mold, Cardinal fans
have tended to revel in relative
progressiveness and the obvious
distinctions from comparable aca
demic institutions of the East.
Although those schools have
got centuries on Stanford, its rapid
rise and relative youth make for
much more flexibility and innova
tion. One would hardly consider
Stanford a place laden with
pompous heritage, where legacies
of behavior skew people's perspec
tive on the present.
Sophomore Hannah Goldie,
who attended a boarding school on
the East Coast, said the atmos
phere at Stanford is what distin
guishes it from all the rest.
"It's just so warm," she said.
"And it's not just the weather. Peo
ple are more open here. Talking to
people on the East Coast is lik?
talking to a brick wall."
But the flip side of all this is that
Stanford sometimes seems to lack

a definable identity. It's both ironic
and telling that the Cardinal mas
cot is really just an abstraction a
color, a shade of red. Nothing too
concrete about that.
So, in the midst of Stanford nov
elty, Big Game provides a comfort
ing sense of continuity. Excepting
the World War years, it's gone on
almost every year since the first stu
dent body arrived at Leland Stan
ford Junior University as the Class
of 1892.
The 100 th Big Game marks the
endurance of the University's sin
gle most long-standing unifying el
ement: the legendary rivalry with
that school across the Bay.
The 100 th anniversary is an oc
casion for Stanfordites to step
back a little and pay homage to
years past. It is a moment where
the Stanford community can

honor ultimate Cardinal fans like
Warren Spieker, who will be at
tending his 67th consecutive Big
Game. It's when those alumni re
membrances and first-hand ac
counts of the original glory days
are brought back.
"It's just going to be a great
show of spirit by both the schools,"
Goldie said.
The Stanford community is re
flecting much more on the familiar
ritual, the constants and the things
that still haven't changed. As it ral
lies around this year's team and the
Big Game of 1997, the very fact of
historical perseverance which
has become rare at a dynamic place
like Stanford â€”is being celebrated.
This year's Big Game jars the
Cardinal collective psyche with
that damn number 100. Here's to
100 Big Games, and to many more.
