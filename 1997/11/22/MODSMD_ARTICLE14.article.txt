# Big Game is what counts
## 
### Mike McGrath 
3:54 p.m. November 22. Less than
a minute left to play, and Stanford is
losing to Cal 21-17. The Cardinal is
lining up for fourth and goal from 3
yards out, and an otherwise disap
pointing season could be vindicated
in the next few moments. Chad
Hutchinson hunches forward and
starts the count.
All at once, the two lines collide
as Mike Mitchell streaks forward to
receive the handoff. He plants his
right foot to cut back into a hole that
is quickly being closed by a pair of
linebackers. Mitchell is wrapped up
on the 2-yard line by one of the my
opic thugs as the other realizes that
something is amiss, namely the ball.

He looks up in time to see it sail
ing into the left flat, where tight end
Tommy Hanson has been left ab
solutely uncovered. It's not surpris
ing, but still exquisitely ironic: Stan
ford has outsmarted Cal to win Big
Game.
... or maybe we'll just humiliate
them like last year. I don't know
which I prefer.
Either way, Big Game is what re
ally counts, in any season. We won
some games in September and Octo
ber, then subsequently lost a few.
Who really cares right now? After all
the bowl aspirations and road trips
are over, two statements remain im
portant: Cal Sucks. Beat Cal.
Do you know why Cal sucks? It's
not because they champion poor
academics, poor athletics and ram
pant drug abuse, although a very
good argument could be made for
every one of these cases. Cal sucks
because you have a good friend that
goes to UC-Berkeley and actually
has the egoism to tell you it's better
than Stanford. Big Game is crucial
because you just might meet that

person outside Stanford Stadium
and have the following conversation:
"Tough game, Cal Friend. I
thought that Justin Vedder guy was
supposed to be something special."
"Um, yeah, Stanford Friend, just
wait until basketball season."
"Really, did you know we're
ranked N0.14? Say, what's the mat
ter?"
"Nothing. I've got my wallet, got
my bag I just feel like I left some
thing behind in the stadium."
"Oh," you reply, "that would be
your PRIDE!"
You see, this is a rivalry, kids. Ri
valries are great, epic things. Think
about how long they've been
around. Greece and Troy were ri
vals. The Trojans stole a radiant
Greek woman and then got their
asses kicked in the Trojan War. They
had to give up Helen, not to mention
their entire civilization.
Stanford and Cal are pretty much
the same way. Since they couldn't
find any radiant women here, the
Bears stole a radiant Axe. Now they
get their asses kicked in a yearly
fashion at Big Game. Not only must
they give up the Axe, but they also
have to surrender their self-respect.
There's more going on here than
a rivalry, though. Big Game is sur
rounded by tradition. What could
better create a sense of school spirit
than a raging 250-foot bonfire to her
ald the weekend festivities before
every Big Game? If you're thinking
"Crossing the Line," go to Cowell.
Immediately.
Although the bonfire, Grand
Poobah of all Stanford traditions, has
been murdered by our lubricious ad
ministration, Big Game Week is still
the culmination of all those things
that make us Stanford. When I say
"those things that make us Stanford,"
I'm not talking about the 24-hour
study room, chem labs, Lag food, or
even "Tenure for Gupta!" This stuff
can be found at most any school.
Even Cal must have its Gupta.
The die-hard freshmen that have
been sleeping out all week to get
good seats, they're a part of the tra
dition. They may not know it, freez
ing their asses off while their warm,
