# Tree Matt Merrill prepares for the big day

### Sasha Polonsky 
Preparation for the 100 th Big Game is
forcing Stanford Tree Matt Merrill to take all
possible precautions for a potential Weenie
assault.
With the help of several engineering ma
jors, Merrill is working to give his Tree cos
tume extra support. In addition to strengthen
ing the aluminum frame, he will be armed
with a special belt strapped around his waist,
complete with bottles of mace and a shock de
vice.
"I feel like Batman with my Tree utility
belt," Merrill said. "I'll be wearing a helmet
and cup, care of my parents who are coming to
visit this weekend."
Merrill remembers last year's mascot trav
esty when ex-Tree Chris Carey's costume
was torn to smithereens by hundreds of disap
pointed Cal fans after a 42-21 Stanford victo
ry all too well not to take these extra pre
cautions.
It's inevitable that the conspicuous Tree
will be a target of hatred when Bears fans are
upset over a loss. But the stakes are higher this
year for Merrill, who will serve as the Cardinal
mascot for the 100 th Big Game.
Carey acknowledged that the risk factor
when he was Tree was not nearly as intense.
He has sent his successor words of advice
from Stanford-in-Oxford, where he is cur
rently studying: "Go on a strict diet of soy
milk, alfalfa and anabolic steroids."
Chris Bonzon, the 1995-96 Tree, recalls the
pressure of his Big Game. Bonzon said Mer
rill must be "prepared for the worst."
"The anticipation is so huge, you don't

know what's going to happen," Bonzon said.
"When you're the object of hatred for thou
sands of fans, you have to watch where you're
going. What can you do when 1,000 people
rush the field, headed straight for you?"
Hopefully, tight security will protect Mer
rill at today's game.
The Department of Athletics has assigned
two professional security guards to the Tree,
according to Merrill. In addition, four stu
dents have been appointed to serve as the
Tree's bodyguards. The black-shirted team,
which goes by the name "Tree Protective Ser
vices," is comprised mostly of wrestlers and
will operate under the motto: "Don't touch
our wood."
Merrill has undergone intense psychologi
cal and physical training over the past several
weeks to prepare himself for just about any
thing that could happen.
The psychological training was led by for
mer Trees plus an additional "select few," ac
cording to Bonzon, who added that they
stepped up the training this year to make sure
Merrill would be 100 percent ready.
Instilling old Indian warrior tactics of
chants and battle cries symbolic of Stan
ford's mascot history the trainers say
they've put Merrill in the mindset for battle.
"He has to have eyes in the back of his
head," Bonzon said. "He has to be ready for
anything. We're training and testing his psy
che and physique he needs to be able to
withstand attack.
"He's a solid guy and he's been doing all
kinds of sit-ups and calisthenics. Plus, as a for
mer wrestler, he knows the discipline of being
a warrior, a fighter, sacrificing everything for
the physical condition of the body."
Merrill admits he is full of nervous excite
ment.
"I wasn't really worried about being at
tacked until [Thursday], when we did a walk
through on the field," Merrill said. "Then, I
suddenly got the feeling, 'Say Cal does rush
the field... where would I go?' "
Cardinal fans also fear for their mascot's
safety and well-being.
"I hope the Tree's been working out 24-7,
because the Weenies are going to be really
pissed off after we crush them," said freshman
Jennifer Chang.
"That's part of the whole tradition," said
sophomore Antonia Welch. "Maybe the Se
cret Service will protect him, though."
Band mellophone player Erik Kreider
doesn't think Merrill is at much risk. He sus
pects efforts to rush the Tree will be less se
vere on Cardinal grounds.
"I don't think they'll maul him here. It kind
of depends upon how crazy [Merrill] is," he
said. "Of course, they'll want to go after him
he's an easy target. But I don't think there's
much danger this year, as long as he doesn't
do anything foolish."
"I could have never predicted that I would
be the object of such wonderfully uncondi
tional hatred," Merrill said. "Not everyone
gets to experience this, and I think of it as an
honor. I like a crazy, out-of-control game just
like any other fan. Although my body may be
at risk, I'd rather have an intense game I'd
like to see it come down to the last play."
