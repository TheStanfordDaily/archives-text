# Not just another rivalry
## Stanford-Cal grudge match shines above others 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
I'll be the first one to admit that
the season leading up the 100 th in
stallment of the Big Game has been
pretty anticlimactic. The Cardinal
has had a disappointing year (excuse
the understatement) and California
has been even worse. Both teams
will finish under .500, and that
means both kissed any bowl aspira
tions goodbye a long time ago.
So why all the hoopla over the
game?
It's simple. The secret can be
found in one word: tradition. The
Stanford-Cal grudge match has
everything that's needed for a classic
college rivalry, plus a few extra ele
ments.
Brain Over Brawn
When Stanford and Cal meet, its
the convergence of two great acade
mic institutions. Think of Harvard-
Yale games. If you've never attend
ed either of these schools, there's a
good chance you couldn't care less
about the game. But nevertheless,
this 122-year-old rivalry is one of the
most storied in college football.
The reason: Big egos equals heat
ed competition. Anyone will admit
that both Cal and Stanford take
pride in their academic prowess.
(How else could we have ended up

with cheers like "We got in" and
"That's all right, that's okay, you'll
all work for us someday"?)
At Cal, the view of the stereotyp
ical Stanford student is someone
who's stuck up and only at Stanford
because of Daddy's wealth. And on
this side of the Bay, Cal students are
our intellectual inferiors and know
it, and they are severely embittered
by this.
So the only rational way to clear
up these misconceptions is with 60
minutes of gridiron chaos. That's
where college athletics finds its
roots. When Yale's Walter Camp
helped transform rugby into Ameri
can football, he set the tone for the
next century.
Polls and Bowls
Big Game is also perhaps the
only rivalry in the country that not
only features great schools, but also
features great teams. (So what if this
is an off-year? It's bound to happen
once in a while).
Both teams are usually in the na
tional spotlight, and so a victory is
crucial, especially with the likes of
the Associated Press and several
Bowl Committees on hand.
The Rose Bowl has featured 19
different Stanford and Cal teams in
its 83 years. That's second only to
USC-UCLA among traditional Pa
cific 10 Conference rivals.

It won't be every year that two
undefeated teams make it to Big
Game (in fact, it's only happened
once), but there's almost always
truly competitive football on at least
one side of the ball.
Big Games, Big Names
Some of the most famous names
in football college or professional
have been a part of Big Game.
Men like Pop Warner, Marv
Levy and Bill Walsh, all coaching
legends, have directed teams from
the sidelines of Big Games. The Big
Game has also been witness to the
introduction of the West Coast of
fense, among other revolutionary
innovations.
The likes of All-Americans John
Elway, Jim Plunkett, Chuck
Muncie, Steve Bartkowski and Joe
Roth have suited up for one of the
two teams and taken the field for Big
Game.
So fans roll out for the Big Game
in hopes of catching a glimpse of the
next great superstar. Perhaps Chad
Hutchinson will come through with
another great performance. Maybe
Cal's Bobby Shaw will pull down
some amazing catches to stun the
Cardinal. Or it might be flanker
Troy Walters who steals the show by
breaking the Pac-10 single-season

reception record (he's only 10
catches shy at the moment).
Did You See That?
If there's anything the Big Game
has been notorious for, it's amazing
plays. These are moments that tran
scend players and teams and find a
place for themselves in the annals of
college football.
One need only think about "The
Play" to see the truth in this. There
are other college games that were
won on the last play of the game, but

it's doubtful anyone will ever again
see a five-lateral kickoff return
with upfield blocks courtesy of a
marching band taken into the
end zone to finish off another game.
It's a moment no one will ever
forget (though Elway may certainly
try). It's what immortalizes the Big
Game throughout the country. It's
why people still care about two
teams who will step off the field and
never be heard of again until next
year.

Gil would like to thank Tomoeh for
all her hard work, and Duran and
Ben for all of their patience. Enjoy
the game.
