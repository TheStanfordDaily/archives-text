### Cleaning up the bowl mess 
No. 7 UCLA (8-2) at USC (6-4) 12:30 p.m. PST
The Bruins and Trojans square off for the 67th time in this Southland
battle. On the line for Bob Toledo and company: the Rose Bowl. A
Bruin victory, coupled with a Washington State loss, means a post
season in Pasadena. Drop this game and it's the Cotton or Sun Bowl.
The Bruins also have the momentum of a six-game winning streak
against John Robinson's club. USC can still get into the Aloha Bowl,
especially if the Fiesta Bowl decides to boost ticket sales by inviting
Arizona State. Otherwise, the Trojans will need Washington to drop
its game and pray the Aloha Bowl passes up the Huskies.
No. 11 WSU (9-1) at No. 17 Washington (7-3) 12:30 p.m.
These teams enter the Apple Cup having switched the spots they oc
cupied in the preseason. The Cougars now find themselves at the top
of the conference and within striking distance of Roses, while the
Huskies are hoping to make the Sun Bowl. As long as Washington
State wins, it should make it to Pasadena on New Year's Day. The
only problem is if USC beats UCLA and Arizona State takes down the
Wildcats next week. That would land ASU in the Rose Bowl by virtue
of its 44-31 win over the Cougars earlier this season. Meanwhile, the
Huskies would love nothing more than to knock their rivals off the top
of the conference, but to do so they'll need QB Brock Huard and run
ning back Rashaan Shehee back at full strength.
Oregon State (3-7) at Oregon (5-5) 1 p.m.
There's not much left for the Beavers. They remain 0-for-Pac-10 after
being blanked 23-0 by USC last week. Of course, the bowl scene has
pretty much been barren for the Ducks since Arizona thumped them
52-31. The only thing at stake in this game is pride.
NEXT SATURDAY:
Arizona (5-5) at No. 12 Arizona State (8-2) 1 p.m.
The final piece of the Rose Bowl puzzle might not be settled until next
week. If UCLA loses today, the Sun Devils just have to get by Arizona
to win a trip to Pasadena. Otherwise, they need to blow out the Wild
cats and hope that the Alliance takes them to the Fiesta Bowl.
