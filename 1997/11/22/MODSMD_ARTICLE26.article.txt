# Cardinal tries to revive running attack
## 
### Joe Cavanaugh 
High expectations rode on the shoulders of
senior tailbacks Anthony Bookman and Mike
Mitchell at the start of the Cardinal season.

Combining the powerful, grind-it-out style
of the 6-foot, 220-pound Mitchell with the
crafty finesse of the 5-8,188-pound Bookman,
the Stanford running game kept Pacific 10
Conference defensive coordinators up nights.

Excluding the loss to highly touted North
Carolina, the Stanford running game lived up
to the hype at the start of the season. Mitchell
and Bookman put up good numbers against
San Jose State, Oregon State, Oregon and
Notre Dame. Going over 100 yards apiece in
the latter three games and exploding for 277
yards combined against the Irish, the two
looked to make a run at the record books.
Then the pair ran into a red-and-blue
streaked wall named Arizona. Mitchell and
Bookman were held to a dismal 32 yards on
18 carries in the disappointing 28-22 loss. Ari
zona State also contained the running game,
allowing a combined total of 104 yards on 19
carries despite a 70-yard touchdown run by
Bookman. Result: a 31-14 loss and another
day of wondering what happened to the run
ning game.
The Cardinal ground attack fared no bet
ter in the team's 27-7 loss to UCLA. The Bru
ins completely dominated the line of scrim
mage, holding Mitchell and Bookman to a
miserable 19 yards on 10 carries. The follow
ing week, USC followed suit and held the pair
to 122 yards on 21 carries in a 45-21 victory.
In a close 38-28 loss to Washington State
last Saturday, Bookman stepped up with 115
yards on 11 carries and Mitchell chipped in
with 38 yards on 14 carries. Though the game
represented the Cardinal's fifth straight loss,
there was still a ray of hope for the running
game.
The key to a Cardinal win in Big Game is
an effective running display by Mitchell and
Bookman to take some pressure off quarter
back Chad Hutchinson. By establishing a
ground threat, Hutchinson will be free to air
it out to speedsters Troy Walters and Damon
Dunn.
The offensive line play is, of course, cru

cial. Junior center Mike McLaughlin, junior
left guard Joe Fairchild, junior right guard Eli
Burriss and senior right tackle Geoff Wilson
will lead the Cardinal in the trenches and
must control the line of scrimmage to open up
the field for Bookman and Mitchell.
The other keys to the ground assault are
senior fullbacks John Ritchie and Greg
Cornelia. After an injury-plagued '96 cam
paign, the tandem returned healthy this sea
son to a make a fearsome foursome in the
Cardinal backfield. But Ritchie and Cornelia
alone haven't been able to spring Mitchell
and Bookman in the last five outings.
By pounding the line and taking care of
the Cal linebackers, Ritchie and Cornelia can
help provide the much-needed daylight for
Mitchell and Bookman to use their speed and
skill in the open field.
The Cardinal rushing attack stacks up well
against the Bear's defense. Cal's rush de
fense, ranked seventh in the Pac-10, gives up
an average of 142 yards per game, and the
Bears' overall defense ranks last in the con
ference.
The 100 th Big Game promises to be a
smash-mouth, biting, kicking, smashing
grudge match everything a fan looks for in
a rivalry. If Mitchell and Bookman can find
holes and establish the run, Stanford has an
excellent shot at its third straight Big Game
victory. But if Cal can hold the two to under
150 yards combined, the Bears could walk
out of Stanford Stadium with the Axe and a
year's worth of bragging rights.
With Stanford and Cal both guaranteed
losing records, Big Game will determine little
more than which team salvages its season. By
shouldering the offensive load, Mitchell and
Bookman can help ensure the Cardinal is the
one doing the salvaging.
