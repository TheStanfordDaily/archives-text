# Big Game witness to changes in sport
## Innovations, strategies have transformed football over last century 
### Evan Meagher 
Over the past 100 years, Big
Game has reflected the evolution of
football from a ground-based rugby
derivative to the modern passing
game we know today.
Typically, the team to first imple
ment revolutionary strategies bene
fited from their use in Big Game.
And Big Game itself has served as
the breeding ground for many inno
vations.
Stanford is credited with the first
of such innovations. In the first Big

Game in 1892, amidst the mass mo
mentum runs and flying wedge for
mations of the day, the Cardinal
pulled off a play "fully twenty years
ahead of its time."
After the recovery of a Cal fum
ble, Stanford quarterback Tommy
Code took the snap from center,
handed off to halfback Carl Cle
mans, and along with fullback J.R.
Whittemore, turned towards the line
of scrimmage.
Unbeknownst to the Cal defense,
however, flanker back Paul Down
ing was sweeping across the back

field. Downing took a clandestine
handoff from Clemans and bucked
around the right end untouched for a
45-yard touchdown, the first in Big
Game history. In effect, Stanford
had pulled off the first dive reverse, a
trick play to become common in
later years.
1895-1899
Beginning in 1895, Cal relied al
most solely on the guards-back of
fense popularized by Penn. In this
formation, five men formed the line
of scrimmage, while the guards
stepped off the line to either side of
the quarterback. The guards could
then carry the ball, pushed from be
hind by the running backs, or smash
through the line to open holes for the
backs.
But it appears that Cal initially
lacked the speed to execute this of
fense to the fullest. Though the Bears
held a perpetual size advantage over
Stanford, they could not properly ex
ploit the holes opened up by their
massive line.
After three unsuccessful years,
Cal apparently settled into the of
fense, winning two straight Big
Games in 1898 and 1899.
1900-1919
A major development in the
game occurred in 1905. Throughout
the country, there was public outcry
against the brutality of college foot
ball. The Chicago Tribune reported

18 deaths and 159 "serious" injuries
resulting from the 1904 season alone.
In response to the carnage on the
gridiron, Berkeley's President
Wheeler ordered that "The game of
football must be entirely made over
or go."
As a result, Stanford and Cal
dropped football, and rugby became
the sport of the Big Game until 1915,
after which World War I prevented a
Big Game at all.
In the meantime, however, the
schools that kept football took mea
sures to make the game safer. It was
these regulations that revolutionized
the brutal, mass-momentum game
into the pass-oriented game played
today.
The forward pass was legalized,
and seven men were required to be

on the line of scrimmage. This out
lawed the guards- or tackles-back of
fenses of the turn of the century
the so-called "mass momentum"
plays in which a host of blockers
would smash into the line and push
the ball carrier from behind. The
game became far more open, swift
and graceful.
1920-1929
When Big Game resumed in
1920, California found itself in the
midst of a golden era of talent re
cruitment.
Led by end Harold "Brick"
Muller and quarterback Charlie Erb,
the Bears ran off five straight Big
Game victories, ending only in 1924,
when Stanford used a desperation

passing attack out of the then-revo
lutionary single-wing offense to
score two touchdowns in the last six
minutes, forcing a tie.
Thus began an era of Stanford
dominance. The hiring of Pop Warn
er as football coach would later pro
duce three Rose Bowl victories and a
host of revolutionary ideas, among
them the use of shoulder pads, the
spiral punt, and the three-point
stance.
Warner was also the first coach to
institute the screen pass, in which
linemen form a wall around a back so
that the defense is sucked in, chasing
the quarterback until he dumps the
ball off to the running back. Warner
used this to great effect in the 1926
Big Game, a 41-6 Stanford victory.
But the most devastating of
Warner's creations was inarguably
the double-wing offense. In this for
mation, two backs stand just outside
and behind the ends, with the quar
terback's and fullback's positions

varying according to series.
The formation opened
up myriad possibilities for
fake sweeps, counters, re
verses and vertical pass

ing lanes. The double-wing was so
revolutionary for its time that Cali
fornia found no solution for it, even
in its Rose Bowl season of 1928,
when a superior Bear team settled
for a tie.
With the devastating dou
ble-wing, Stanford went 9-1-1
in Big Games from 1926-1935.
Warner also implemented a new de
fensive set against the shift offense

popularized by Notre Dame; with
five men on the line, it became
known as the "butterfly" defense,
and held California to just 61 points
in 10 years.
1930-1939
Warner left Stanford after the
1932 season, but left his mark not
only with his 5-1-3 Big Game record,
but also in the lasting contribution of
the double-wing offense. California
never quite caught up to the double
wing until the late '3os, long after it
had gone out of vogue on the East
Coast.
After four straight disastrous loss
es to the Cal "Thunder Teams" of
the late 19305, Stanford hired Clark
Shaughnessy, who came to Palo Alto
after a stint as head coach of the
then-infantile Chicago Bears.
Shaughnessy brought with him a rev
olutionary offense: the T. The T
had its roots in the old mass-momen
tum plays of the turn of the century,
and was originally known as the
"regular" formation. With the full
back directly behind the quarterback
and the line abreast with the half

backs, it provided the
possibility for enor

mous power at the
point of attack
along the line.

De

fenses eventually reacted with a slid
ing 5-4-2 formation, with four line
backers to optimize pursuit wherev
er the shifty T sent its backs, but
Shaughnessy managed to stay a step
ahead with what he called "counter
plays."
Typically, one of the backs would
go in motion, and the sliding 5-4-2
would shift the strength of the line to
the motion side. Clark's counter
plays introduced the idea of running
away from the motion, and therefore
away from the defense's shifted
strength.
1940-1959
Spurred by the success of the T,
Stanford rolled to a 10-0 season in
1940, beating Cal 13-7 in Big Game
and Nebraska 21-13 in the Rose Bowl.
Having turned a winless 1939 squad
into the undefeated Rose Bowl cham
pions of 1940, Shaughnessy won

Coach of the Year honors.
World War II wiped out Big
Game from 1943-1945, and

California enjoyed a peri
od of dominance in the
late 19405. When head *
coach Marchie 'J
Schwartz resigned in
1950, Stanford replaced
him with Chuck Taylor, an

alumnus from Shaughnessy's "Won
der T" team of 1940.
True to his roots, Taylor ran a T
based formation with heavy emphasis
on the passing attack. Stanford found
success under the system, but faltered
against Cal's sliding defense, losing
Big Game on its way to a Pac-10

championship.
1960-Present

Big Games through the
1960s were certainly no less
spirited or exciting than any
others, but they did not reflect
any major changes in coach
ing philosophy or strategy.
Stanford stayed largely with a
T-derived offense, enjoying a
12-4 record in Big Games
from 1960-1976.

The hiring of Bill Walsh in
1977 marked a new era for
Stanford, and indeed, for
football. It was in Palo Alto

that Walsh would devel
op his masterpiece: the
West Coast offense.

The
West Coast of

fense is based
upon the con
cept that
short, per-
fectly timed
and executed
passes could
manufacture
sustained
drives as
well as morf
traditiona
run-based
ball con
trol. It
ut i -
lizes
three

basic types of passes: the dropback,
the play-action, and the waggle.
The dropback, typically a three
or five-step drop in the Walsh sys
tem, relies upon crisp routes by the
receivers: hitches or slants for a
three-step drop, out patterns and
fades for a five-step drop. The play
action involves a fake handoff to the
running back, drawing the lineback
ers and defensive backs up to defend
the run and leaving wideouts open.
Finally, the waggle requires the
quarterback to take the snap and
then sprint outside the tackle to find
an open receiver.
Perhaps the most famous waggle
in history is "the Catch" Dwight
Clark's last-minute touchdown
against the Dallas Cowboys in the
1981 NFC championship game.
Central to the success of the West
Coast offense is the concept of pass
ing lanes. Stanford, in its continuing

implementation of Walsh's brain
child, will often split a running
back wide, making him a po
tential receiver and forcing a
defensive back or linebacker
to cover him. This

side, al

gle coverage.
In his two years at Stanford,
Walsh coached the team to a
17-7 record, with
victories in the Sun

and Bluebonnet bowls.
More importantly, Walsh's
West Coast offense ravaged
the Cal defense in the

1977 and 1978 Big
Games, racking
up a combined
51 points. Un
able to adapt
to the com
pl e x
pack
ages
(Walsh
occa
sionally

ran a no-back package, with all the
backs split out wide) and precision
passing attack, the Bears defense
simply crumbled.
Even after Walsh's departure to
the 49ers in 1978, the Cardinal of
fense continued to perfect his mas
terpiece. Using the West Coast of
fense, Stanford scored 245 points in
Big Games in the 'Bos, up from 204 in
the '7os and 183 ip the '6os.
Throughout its history, Big Game
has served as a testing ground for
radical innovations in the world of
football. The double-wing and T-for
mations won Big Games before they
won recognition from the football
community.
Future Big Games no doubt hold
in store more revolutionary strata
gems. Will the trend toward more
and more complicated passing at
tacks continue? Or will football face
a T-like return to its smash-mouth
