# Big Game witness to changes in sport
## Innovations, strategies have transformed football over last century 
### Evan Meagher 
Over the past 100 years, Big
Game has reflected the evolution of
football from a ground-based rugby
derivative to the modern passing
game we know today.
Typically, the team to first imple
ment revolutionary strategies bene
fited from their use in Big Game.
And Big Game itself has served as
the breeding ground for many inno
vations.
Stanford is credited with the first
of such innovations. In the first Big

Game in 1892, amidst the mass mo
mentum runs and flying wedge for
mations of the day, the Cardinal
pulled off a play "fully twenty years
ahead of its time."
After the recovery of a Cal fum
ble, Stanford quarterback Tommy
Code took the snap from center,
handed off to halfback Carl Cle
mans, and along with fullback J.R.
Whittemore, turned towards the line
of scrimmage.
Unbeknownst to the Cal defense,
however, flanker back Paul Down
ing was sweeping across the back

field. Downing took a clandestine
handoff from Clemans and bucked
around the right end untouched for a
45-yard touchdown, the first in Big
Game history. In effect, Stanford
had pulled off the first dive reverse, a
trick play to become common in
later years.
1895-1899
Beginning in 1895, Cal relied al
most solely on the guards-back of
fense popularized by Penn. In this
formation, five men formed the line
of scrimmage, while the guards
stepped off the line to either side of
the quarterback. The guards could
then carry the ball, pushed from be
hind by the running backs, or smash
through the line to open holes for the
backs.
But it appears that Cal initially
lacked the speed to execute this of
fense to the fullest. Though the Bears
held a perpetual size advantage over
Stanford, they could not properly ex
ploit the holes opened up by their
massive line.
After three unsuccessful years,
Cal apparently settled into the of
fense, winning two straight Big
Games in 1898 and 1899.
1900-1919
A major development in the
game occurred in 1905. Throughout
the country, there was public outcry
against the brutality of college foot
ball. The Chicago Tribune reported

18 deaths and 159 "serious" injuries
resulting from the 1904 season alone.
In response to the carnage on the
gridiron, Berkeley's President
Wheeler ordered that "The game of
football must be entirely made over
or go."
As a result, Stanford and Cal
dropped football, and rugby became
the sport of the Big Game until 1915,
after which World War I prevented a
Big Game at all.
In the meantime, however, the
schools that kept football took mea
sures to make the game safer. It was
these regulations that revolutionized
the brutal, mass-momentum game
into the pass-oriented game played
today.
The forward pass was legalized,
and seven men were required to be

on the line of scrimmage. This out
lawed the guards- or tackles-back of
fenses of the turn of the century
the so-called "mass momentum"
plays in which a host of blockers
would smash into the line and push
the ball carrier from behind. The
game became far more open, swift
and graceful.
1920-1929
When Big Game resumed in
1920, California found itself in the
midst of a golden era of talent re
cruitment.
Led by end Harold "Brick"
Muller and quarterback Charlie Erb,
the Bears ran off five straight Big
Game victories, ending only in 1924,
when Stanford used a desperation
