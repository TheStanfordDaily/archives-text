# CARDINAL NOTES
## Team has one last shot to save its season 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
The past six weeks haven't been the brightest
for football on the Farm. Back in October, the
Cardinal was in the national spotlight after
crushing Notre Dame, and favored to make a
run at the Rose Bowl. A month and a half later,

the team is saddled with the burden of a five
game losing streak and a sub-.500 season.
Now Stanford (4-6, 2-5 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) is headed into its final game of the season
and for 12 senior starters, the final game of
their college careers and has the added pres
sure of living up to 100 years of football tradition
in one 60-minute contest.

BIG FINISH: Senior defensive end Kailee
Wong will finish his career as the Cardinal's
most successful defensive lineman in recent his
tory.
Wong was named a first-team All-American
by Football News, making him the first Stanford
defensive lineman to earn All-America recogni
tion since Duncan McColl in 1976.
Wong has 42 tackles this year and has cost
opponents 104 yards with his Pac-10 best 21
tackles for loss. He has also tallied a conference
high 11 sacks, including two safeties.
Wong has already been selected to appear in
the East-West Shrine Game and the Hula Bowl
in Maui after the season.
SURE HANDS: Redshirt sophomore
flanker Troy Walters has already forced his way
into the record books, and today will probably
do more of the same. Walters, who is currently
first in the conference and third in the nation
with 80 catches, is only 11 yards shy of taking
over as the Cardinal's all-time leader in receiv
ing yardage.
His total of 1,106 yards this year ranks second
in the Pac-10 and fifth in the country, and if quar
terback Chad Hutchinson can connect with him
11 times in Big Game, Walters will pass up
USC's Keyshawn Johnson to become the Pac
10's single-season reception leader.
The Cardinal's special teams have also bene
fited from Walters' athleticism. His 14.1 yards
per punt return is second-best in the conference,
and he has taken a punt back for a touchdown in
each of the last two games.

BOUNCING BACK STRONG: Senior in
side linebacker Chris Draft leads the team with
69 tackles even though he missed three games
earlier this year with a hamstring injury.
Draft exploded against Washington State
last week, making 18 tackles (two for loss) and a
sack against the Cougars. He even picked off a
pass in the Cardinal's losing cause.
NOVEMBER PAIN: Prior to this year, Ty
rone Willingham had lost only one November
game since taking over as head coach of the Car
dinal. This season, that number quadrupled.
But Willingham does have one statistic on his
side: He has never lost a Big Game —either in a
head coaching or assistant coaching capacity.
At the start of the season, the nation was
touting Willingham as one of college football's
brightest young coaches, and rumors involving
NFL teams were flying everywhere. Now Will
ingham must hope his team can salvage a season
that has otherwise gone down the drain.
BLOWOUT IN THE MAKING? If tradi
tion holds firm, this game shouldn't be much of
a nailbiter. The only four Big Games to be de
cided on the game's last play were held at Cal's
Memorial Stadium.
In fact, only two Big Games played at Stan
ford Stadium in the last 25 years have been de
cided by a touchdown or less. But while games
haven't been extremely close, they have been
high-scoring.
Since 1972, Cal and Stanford have combined
for an average of 47.5 points per game at Stan
ford Stadium.
