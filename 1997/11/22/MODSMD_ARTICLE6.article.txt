As if seven losses weren't enough, Justin Vedder
lost his car earlier this month when it was stolen
from a campus parking lot. Despite those frustrations,
the junior college transfer can vault into second
place on Cal's single-season passing yardage
list with a 283-yard performance in Big Game.
Kailee Wong basked in the glow of a huge interception
return for a touchdown in last year's Big
Game and has continued to terrorize Pac-10 backs
in 1997. His and Bryan Werner's graduation will
leave Riall Johnson, Sam Benner and Konti Pellegrin
with huge shoes to fill.

If Tarik Smith had caught a ball in the final minute
against Arizona last week, Cal and Stanford would
have identical records today. But he failed to catch
his first pass in five games, although his three rush
ing touchdowns kept the game close. Meanwhile,
Greg Cornelia, who busted loose for a career-long
33-yard run last year in Berkeley, wraps up his five
year tenure on the Farm along with fellow fullback
Jon Ritchie. Both have eyes set on possible pro ca
reers.

Bobby Shaw and Troy Walters could be the top
two receivers in the Pacific 10 Conference. Shaw
will likely follow Sean Dawkins and Iheanyi
Uwaezuoke to the NFL after this season. With 69
catches, he owns Cal's single-season mark and
needs just 10 yards to move into second place on
the Pac-10's career reception yardage chart. Kadar
Hamilton has had the most whirlwind Stanford ca
reer this side of Scott Frost. He started eight times
in 1994, barely played in '95, starred on special
teams last year and returned to the starting lineup
this season.

Brandon Whiting's defensive pressure hasn't led to
interceptions; Cal went seven straight weeks with
out a single pick until last week. But Whiting has
tallied seven sacks, including six in the last five
weeks. Joe Fairchild started the year on the bench
and moved into the starting left tackle slot against
Oregon. Although he occasionally struggled to
protect the blind side, he was shifted to senior An
drew Kroeker's left guard spot two weeks ago,
meaning the five linemen slated to start against Cal
plus key reserve Brian Donoghue will all re
turn next year.

Seldom will a defensive coordinator be promot
ed after his team allows no fewer than 35 points in
each of its final six games, but Tom Holmoe got the
nod at Cal after Steve Mariucci took his suit and tie
to 3Com Park after last season. While Tyrone Will
ingham is the first head coach in Stanford history to
see his winning percentage decline in each of his
first three seasons, he has a perfect record in Big
Games. Only his mentor, Denny Green, can boast
a perfect Big Game record among Stanford coach
es with at least three years experience.
