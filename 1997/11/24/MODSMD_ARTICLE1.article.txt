# STANFORD 21, CAL 20
## Stanford keeps Axe by hanging on for narrow win 
### Dave Flemming Contributing writer 
The historic 100 th Big Game was
the type of contest that so many of the
99 previous meetings between Stan
ford and California had been ~ a
thriller.
Stanford (5-6,3-5 Pacific 10 Con
ference) jumped out to a two-touch
down lead and then held on for dear
life to defeat the Golden Bears 21-20.
snapping a five-game losing streak in
front of a sellout crowd of 85,000 at
Stanford Stadium.
The win was Stanford's third
straight over Cal (3-8, 1-7) and its
eighth Big Game victory in the last 11
years. It was also the 29th Big Game
decided by three points or fewer in a
series that has hail more nail-biting
finishes than any other in college
football history.
Saturday it v\as the Stanford de
fense led by a group of determined
seniors playing in their final college
game that won the game for the
Cardinal.
Senior linebacker Chris Draft led
Stanford with 12 tackles and made
the game's biggest play, intercepting
a pass from Bears quarterback Justin
Vcdder with onl\ I minute, 22 sec
onds left and Stanford clinging to a
21-IS lead. The turnover halted Cat's
drive inside the Cardinal 30 just w hen
the Bears appeared poised to cap oil
eameback in classic BigGa.nu lash
mi)
"What you usualK experience in a
game of this nature is lor seniors to
step up." said Stanford head coach •

Tyrone Willingham. "Chris (Draft) was great
today."
But Draft's interception did not end the drama.
Stanford was whistled for a personal foul penalty
after the play and took possession at its own 14.
After two runs went for no gain, Stanford sopho
more quarterback Chad Hutchinson pitched the
ball to senior fullback Greg Cornelia — a question
able play call that almost cost the Cardinal.
The ball slipped out of Cornelia's hands, but he
managed to rip the ball away from a Cal defender
and avoid a devastating turnover.
Senior punter Kevin Miller then ran out the
back of the end zone intentionally for a safety that
made the score 21-20. That left the Bears only 19
seconds and no timeouts to move at least 30 yards
into field-goal position after the ensuing free kick.
But with the Big Game's history of wild finish
es. no one in Stanford Stadium counted the contest
over until sophomore defensive tackle Andrew
("urrie dragged Vedder to the turf on Cal's second
desperation play in the waning seconds.
Then the celebration for Cardinal fans began, as
the red-clad faithful stormed the field and Stanford
players circled the field in victory. The win eased
some of the pain from a season that started with
Rose Bowl aspirations but ended without a trip to
the postseason.
"Excitement," Hutchinson said, describing his
team's reaction to ending its struggles. "It's a otic
word feeling. It was a tremendous win for us."
Hutchinson had a very good day throwing the
ball, bouncing back from a poor performance two
weeks ago against I JSC and an injury that kept him
out of most of last week's game. He completed 21
of 25 passes — a completion rate just four percent
shy of the single-game Stanford record — for 194

yards and a touchdown.
Hutchinson's favorite target, as it wasallseasc
was redshirt sophomore flanker Troy Walters, u I
finished the greatest season ever by a Cardin
wideout with his sixth game of 1 (X)-plus recervu
yards.
Walters finished with six catches for 100 yar
and set a new Stanford record lor most yards i
ceiving in a season — 1,206. Walters also set tl
school record for season receptions with 86 but I.
four catches short of the Pac-10 single-se;is.
record held by (JSC's Keyshawn Johnson.
Senior wideout Damon Dunn finished his
reer with a fine game to complement Waltei
grabbing nine balls for 73 yards.
But despite some good individual peril
manees, the Stanford offense struggled against
Cal defense that played its best game in weeks.
The Cardinal was shut out in the second hall ai
held to a paltry 81 yards after halftiine. On tl
game, the Bears outgained Stanford 380 yards
240 — the third-lowest Cardinal output this ye;u
But the Stanford defense only allowed eiti
second-half points and made big plays when
needed to — including the game's first touchduw
Senior cornerback Corey Hill intercepted
Vedder pass deflected by Draft late in the li;
quarter and returned it 41 yards for a touchdov
and a 7-0 Stanford lead.
The Cardinal let a golden opportunity slip by <
its next possession, fumbling the ball away on tl
Cal 7. But the Bears punted the ball right back
Stanford and the Cardinal needed just two runs I
senior back Anthony Bookman to get into the ci
zone from 38 yards out for a 13-0 lead early in tl
second quarter.
Bookman ran for 70 yards on the day and ti
ished his career as the third-leading rusher in («i
dinal history.

Bookman's partner of four years in the back
tield,-senior Mike Mitchell, did not have a happy
ending to his illustrious tenure on the Farm. In one
of the darker moments in recent Big Game history.
Cat linebacker Albert Dorsey viciously yanked
Mitchell to the ground by the face mask in the sec
ond quarter, severely injuring both of Mitchell's
knees.
"That one really kind of bothered me, with the
way it took place on a flagrant penalty," Willing
ham said. "To see one of Stanford's all-time lead
ing rushers go out that way really bothered me."
I'hc extent of the injuries is not known, but it is
feared there are multiple ligament tears in both
knees. Mitchell and his Cardinal teammates were
visibly shaken at the brutality of the injury on the
sideline. Senior free safety Alistair White also hurt
his knee in his final game as a Cardinal.
But otherwise it was a great day for Stanford se
niors. including defensive linemen Carl Hansen
and Kailee Wong, who each had a sack. Wong fin
ished the year with 12 sacks and 22 tackles for loss,
both tops in the Pac-1(). and stands to receive nu
merous All-America honors.
Senior safety Kadar Hamilton and linebacker
Jon Haskins each had 10 tackles.
I he game began with Navy Seals parachuting
into the stadium with the game ball and featured
uniforms replicating those of the 1930s and a half
time show full of great moments of past Big
(iames. Cal students even managed to tear down
the goalpost in the north end zone after the game
- in a losing effort.
But in between all the fanfare and celebration of
the 100 th Big Game, Stanford and Cal played an
other hard-fought, close game that was not over
until the final gun sounded.
After KM) years of this rivalry, it's good to know
that some things never change.

decided by three points or fewer in a
series that has hail more nail-biting
finishes than any other in college
football history.
Saturday it v\as the Stanford de
fense led by a group of determined
seniors playing in their final college
game that won the game for the
Cardinal.
Senior linebacker Chris Draft led
Stanford with 12 tackles and made
the game's biggest play, intercepting
a pass from Bears quarterback Justin
Vcdder with onl\ I minute, 22 sec
onds left and Stanford clinging to a
21-IS lead. The turnover halted Cat's
drive inside the Cardinal 30 just w hen
the Bears appeared poised to cap oil
eameback in classic BigGa.nu lash
mi)
"What you usualK experience in a
game of this nature is lor seniors to
step up." said Stanford head coach •

Tyrone Willingham. "Chris (Draft) was great
today."
But Draft's interception did not end the drama.
Stanford was whistled for a personal foul penalty
after the play and took possession at its own 14.
After two runs went for no gain, Stanford sopho
more quarterback Chad Hutchinson pitched the
ball to senior fullback Greg Cornelia — a question
able play call that almost cost the Cardinal.
The ball slipped out of Cornelia's hands, but he
managed to rip the ball away from a Cal defender
and avoid a devastating turnover.
Senior punter Kevin Miller then ran out the
back of the end zone intentionally for a safety that
made the score 21-20. That left the Bears only 19
seconds and no timeouts to move at least 30 yards
into field-goal position after the ensuing free kick.
But with the Big Game's history of wild finish
es. no one in Stanford Stadium counted the contest
over until sophomore defensive tackle Andrew
("urrie dragged Vedder to the turf on Cal's second
desperation play in the waning seconds.
Then the celebration for Cardinal fans began, as
the red-clad faithful stormed the field and Stanford
players circled the field in victory. The win eased
some of the pain from a season that started with
Rose Bowl aspirations but ended without a trip to
the postseason.
"Excitement," Hutchinson said, describing his
team's reaction to ending its struggles. "It's a otic
word feeling. It was a tremendous win for us."
Hutchinson had a very good day throwing the
ball, bouncing back from a poor performance two
weeks ago against I JSC and an injury that kept him
out of most of last week's game. He completed 21
of 25 passes — a completion rate just four percent
shy of the single-game Stanford record — for 194

yards and a touchdown.
Hutchinson's favorite target, as it wasallseasc
was redshirt sophomore flanker Troy Walters, u I
finished the greatest season ever by a Cardin
wideout with his sixth game of 1 (X)-plus recervu
yards.
Walters finished with six catches for 100 yar
and set a new Stanford record lor most yards i
ceiving in a season — 1,206. Walters also set tl
school record for season receptions with 86 but I.
four catches short of the Pac-10 single-se;is.
record held by (JSC's Keyshawn Johnson.
Senior wideout Damon Dunn finished his
reer with a fine game to complement Waltei
grabbing nine balls for 73 yards.
But despite some good individual peril
manees, the Stanford offense struggled against
Cal defense that played its best game in weeks.
The Cardinal was shut out in the second hall ai
held to a paltry 81 yards after halftiine. On tl
game, the Bears outgained Stanford 380 yards
240 — the third-lowest Cardinal output this ye;u
But the Stanford defense only allowed eiti
second-half points and made big plays when
needed to — including the game's first touchduw
Senior cornerback Corey Hill intercepted
Vedder pass deflected by Draft late in the li;
quarter and returned it 41 yards for a touchdov
and a 7-0 Stanford lead.
The Cardinal let a golden opportunity slip by <
its next possession, fumbling the ball away on tl
Cal 7. But the Bears punted the ball right back
Stanford and the Cardinal needed just two runs I
senior back Anthony Bookman to get into the ci
zone from 38 yards out for a 13-0 lead early in tl
second quarter.
Bookman ran for 70 yards on the day and ti
ished his career as the third-leading rusher in («i
dinal history.

Bookman's partner of four years in the back
tield,-senior Mike Mitchell, did not have a happy
ending to his illustrious tenure on the Farm. In one
of the darker moments in recent Big Game history.
Cat linebacker Albert Dorsey viciously yanked
Mitchell to the ground by the face mask in the sec
ond quarter, severely injuring both of Mitchell's
knees.
"That one really kind of bothered me, with the
way it took place on a flagrant penalty," Willing
ham said. "To see one of Stanford's all-time lead
ing rushers go out that way really bothered me."
I'hc extent of the injuries is not known, but it is
feared there are multiple ligament tears in both
knees. Mitchell and his Cardinal teammates were
visibly shaken at the brutality of the injury on the
sideline. Senior free safety Alistair White also hurt
his knee in his final game as a Cardinal.
But otherwise it was a great day for Stanford se
niors. including defensive linemen Carl Hansen
and Kailee Wong, who each had a sack. Wong fin
ished the year with 12 sacks and 22 tackles for loss,
both tops in the Pac-1(). and stands to receive nu
merous All-America honors.
Senior safety Kadar Hamilton and linebacker
Jon Haskins each had 10 tackles.
I he game began with Navy Seals parachuting
into the stadium with the game ball and featured
uniforms replicating those of the 1930s and a half
time show full of great moments of past Big
(iames. Cal students even managed to tear down
the goalpost in the north end zone after the game
- in a losing effort.
But in between all the fanfare and celebration of
the 100 th Big Game, Stanford and Cal played an
other hard-fought, close game that was not over
until the final gun sounded.
After KM) years of this rivalry, it's good to know
that some things never change.
