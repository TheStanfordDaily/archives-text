## A
						charitable holiday season 
### 
IT IS NOW officially
the holiday season for
me: today Neimen
Marcus at Union Square
erects their three-story
decorated tree.
Because mv family is
not religious, I associate

winter festivities with aesthetic experiences
such as colored lights, paper snow flakes
and store decorations.
When my grandmother, a San Francisco
native, lived in the city, we would visit her
for Thanksgiving and spend the following
day window shopping downtown. I was
always delighted by the displays of color
and grandeur.
But I would often tire of the adult con
versation as we walked through the maze of
shops, so I held my mother give me all of her
change, and 1 would amuse myself by doling
it out, coin by coin, to the Salvation Army
volunteers who stood on the street corners
ringing silver bells.
As I dropped mom's quarters and dimes
into their red tins, they would say "God
bless you." contributing a spiritual element
to my holiday experience. It made a deep
impression.
As a child, I had a strong proclivity for
charity. A few years after my Salvation
Army days I discovered non-profit organi
zations and started saving my allowance for
donations.
I guess word got around that I was a
softy, because soon I was receiving mail
from every good-will cause that existed. At
some point in time I held memberships to

Save the Children, Youth Ending Hunger.
Amnesty International, Greenpeace, The
Cousteau Society, People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals and the Nuclear Age
Peace Foundation.
It got to a point where I could no longer
afford all the donation requests I was
receiving. The overwhelming demand cou
pled with my growing interest in clothes,
music, dates and other teenage distractions
meant that 1 slowly faded out of the charity
scene. The disillusionment began.
I started throwing those bulk mailings in
the trash before reading them, though I
couldn't reject people face to lace who were
in need. So I would hand over my spare
change to the occasional homeless person,
regardless of my elders' explanations that it
was an ineffective method of charity.
It all changed one day when I was on a
train to Washington to visit relatives. A
woman was working her way through the
car asking passengers for money in order to
buy a ticket. Her entreaty seemed so gen
uine to me that I slipped her $10. Minutes
later the conductor came by to tell us not to
give money to that woman because she was
a heroin addict who had a history of illegal
ly hoarding trains to request handouts.
The man sitting across the aisle from me
had noticed my action and now glanced at
me and shook his head in disapproval. I felt
my face burn with shame at my naivete.
I became jaded that day. I learned to
numb my response to people 1 saw in the
street. Though still saddened by poverty, I
resigned myself to powerlessness.
Just the other day, I was walking out of a

gourmet grocery store in Menlo Park. Out
side of the store's door is a sign that reads
"Please discourage panhandling by donat
ing to organizations that provide help to
those in need." While most of us agree that
donating to organizations is the best way to
help people, the sub-text felt manipulative:
the store is asking me to behave in a way
that supports its commercial interests.
Next to the sign was an elderly lady in
rags. She asked me if I could spare any
change. I mumbled "sorry" and walked on
feeling awash with guilt and pity. Behind
me a man exited the store, and he respond
ed to the woman's appeal with unusual cor
diality. He gave her a Power Bar from his
grocery bag while exchanging pleasantries.
I was struck not only by his ingenuity hut
by his calm compassion. 1 was impressed by
how he maintained such clarity and open
ness in the face of conflicting ideologies. He
did not seem naive or immature. He did not
seem unrealistically idealistic, nor did he
seem cynical. He seemed human.
I don't know the most effective way to
combat homelessness or to alleviate the suf
fering of poverty. But I know integrity when
1 see it.and I know the man behind me
acted with more of it than 1 did.

Kerry Rodgers, a senior majoring in philos
ophy and form of visual art, thinks that
although good intentions may not be
enough, they are a step in the right direc
tion. And she hopes that you may consider
sharing kindness with someone you don't
know this holiday season.
