End post game violence
As a consistent attendee of the annual
Cal Stanford Big (lame, 1 have witnessed
increasingly frightening post-game violence
since 1992. While attending the 1992 rivalry
at Memorial Stadium, I was blindsidedlv
struck in the face by a Cal fan. during the
melee that spilled into the stands following
several Cal fans' forcible capture of the
Stanford Hag bearer's large Hag.
Since that time, each Big Came finale
has inevitably devolved into an ugly and
potentially riotous confrontation between
the schools' younger fans, usually provoked
by fans of the losing team.
This year was especially alarming and
hooliganistie. as Cal fans, inspired to some
extent by taunting ( ardinal fans, shook and
rocked the chain link fence barrier until it
was bent sufficiently to allow thousands of
Cal supporters to stream onto the field.
Many of them were hell-bent on getting the
Stanford lans who ran in terror as Cal fans
stampeded toward them.
Initially frustrated by its inability to
reach and tear apart the Stanford mascot
tree (as it did last vear). the Cal mob

scratched its collective head and then ran to
destroy the new focal point of its created
anger, the northern goal post. This act of
vandalism seemed to mollify the crowd,
though there was an attempt to attack the
south goal post. However, the now less
frenzied fans were deterred by a seriously
understaffed security force and a wall of
Stanford students.
At the "front lines" of the confrontation
between opposing teams' fans, the activity
was violent several people were knocked
to the ground by Cal fans parading part of
the goal post.
The escalation of violence needs to stop
now. A Ml'C'H stronger police force might
help, as would a fence at Memorial Stadium
along with perhaps ;i stronger one at Stan
ford. However, the real solution is aware
ness and education, something students at
both schools should be able to handle.
Articles in Hie Stanford Daily and The
Daily California!! need to address the issue
in the weeks leading up to next year's Big
(iatne. and the presidents, athletic directors
and coaches need to speak out against the
increasing violence. It is simply unaccept
able. It will be difficult to prevent happy fans

from dancing on the field after a win. but
either both schools need to stay off the field,
or the losing school must allow the other to
celebrate without fear of retaliation.
If school authorities and students fail to
ignore the obvious warning signs of the past
several Big (lames, 1 can assure the Bay
Area that a massive and horrificallv violent
confrontation will take place within the
next three years.

Potential judicial travesty
It has been nearly a year since a Santa
Clara Country Superior Court judge
instructed Stanford University to reinstate
Adolf Pfefferbaum to his tenured position
as full professor in the Department of Psy
chiatry and Behavioral Sciences.
The court order stated that all of Pfef
ferbaum's rights and privileges were to be
returned "forthwith."
Instead of honoring the Court's order.
Stanford refused to let Pfefferbaum con

tinue as principal investigator of the Mental
Health Clinical Research Center
(MHCRC) and director of his world class
brain imaging and eleetrophvsiology labo
ratory. which he created and nurtured dur
ing his more than 2(1 years in the field.
Centers such as the MHCRC are award
ed to only a few select scientists who pos
sess an outstanding research record and
highest integrity. Indeed the scientific com
munis at large acknowledges Pfeffer
baurn's research stature and considers
Stanford's actions against him an assault on
tenure, as evidenced by an article in the
Oct. 5 issue of Science.
In Pfefferbaum's enforced absence, the
center has withered and will be shut down
in December. This is an academic tragedy.
Pfefferbaum's fault, in Stanford's opin
ion. was to retire from active VA employ
ment. Pfefferbaum was forced to leave his
position at the Palo Alto VA because of
severe harassment he and Ins staff with
stood after he. with two other faculty with
administrative roles at the VA. charged
that the associate dean was undermining
the chartered Stanford-VA teaching and
research missions by targeting certain Stan

ford faculty for mistreatment.
The other two quietly accepted demo
tion. and one subsequently left Stanford:
Pfefferbaum chose to fight for his rights. In
July 1995, for no professional or perfor
mance reason, the dean of the Medical
School, supported by Provost Condoleezza
Rice, forbade Pfefferbaum from continuing
work on his federally funded research.
In August 1995 University President
Gerhard Casper dismissed Pfefferbaum
without ever meeting with him and there
after removed him as principal investigator
of the MHCRC.
Subsequently, the Superior Court found
Stanford's actions against Pfefferbaum to
be illegal and ordered Stanford to restore
Pfefferbaum to his tenured position with its
associated rights and privileges. To date.
Stanford has yet ft) lift University-imposed
sanctions on Pfefferbaum.
Starting at 8:30 a.m.. Dec. 1. Stanford
will hold a public hearing on the Pfeffer
baum case (("ERAS. rm. 112). Following
the guidelines of the Faculty Handbook, a
hearing officer will preside as Stanford and
Pfefferbaum argue the "disputed facts."
I nder Stanford's rules, the University must
