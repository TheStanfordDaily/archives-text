# Vanessa Bartsch: Showering with the boys
## Steering, slick roads and bad California drivers 
### 
C ALIFORNIANS CAN'T DRIVE.
Especially in the rain. I know I'm not
one to talk. Not only am I a bad driv
er, but I am a bad Massachusetts driver.
For anyone who has not had the pleasure
of tackling the highways and byways of the
Boston area, this may not mean much. But
everyone there drives like an ass.
When you hit Route 128 at rush hour,
(picture The 101 at 5:30 p.m.. but moving 85
miles an hour), you expect the unexpected.
If there is a large car in the lane next to you,
it is accepted that he will speed-up and
swerve suddenly without signaling.
In fact, you prepare for it. You put your
foot on the brake and pray that the car
behind you is not some driver from New
Hampshire.
Then you give The Hand, a manual
maneuver including, but not limited to. The
Wipe, The Shake, The Sarcastic Thumb
and, of course, the standard Finger.
With my background in offensive driv
ing I assumed that nothing could scare me.
Well, congratulations, Californians, you've
proved me wrong.
It started out simply enough. Two of my
friends needed a ride to the airport at 3 p.m.
on Thursday. I owed one them more than a
few favors, so I figured why not? I had a
meeting a 4 p.m., but San Jose is less than 20

minutes away. In and out. No problem.
Or so I thought.
We were all a hit delayed in leaving and
as we piled into my friend's Nissan, a drizzle
began. Nothing big, just a misting of the
windshield as we headed out onto The 101.
Shortly after departing, the skies let loose a
slow rain.
Drivers immediately deereased their
pace by at least 25 miles an hour. My friend,
a brave stile from Wisconsin who is relative
ly fearless in the rain, hit the carpool lane,
and we barreled merrily along.
After some mildly shady driving, my
friends jumped from the car with fewer than
15 minutes to catch their flight.
1 slid behind the wheel, slightly irritated
because I realized that 1 was probably going
to be late to my meeting. But I cranked up
the radio, started singing and headed back
for the freeway, never suspecting what I was
about to encounter.
The full hour of rain had caused com
plete chaos. ('alifornians who can stand firm
during earthquakes, stay dry during mud
slides and play Smokev the Bear during for
est fires, cannot handle rain.
Someone once tried to defend ('aliforni
ans' poor driving habits by blaming them on
the infrequency of rain. They claimed that
when it rains, oil floats to the surface of the

road and makes it impossible to steer or
brake. Yeah, right. It rains in the summer in
Massachusetts too, yet the cars manage to
stay on the road.
Knowing no other way home 1 braved
those oil slicks and entered the highway-
Traffic rolled on at 50 miles an hour for
about 100 feet before 1 watched an Explor
er catch sight of a puddle and slam on the
brakes — which caused the Civic behind
him to come careening into his rear end
after the Jeep behind him drove smack into
his little Civic bumper.
And that is when the truck next to the
Civic did a bit too much rubber necking and
swung into the center divider, ending up
perpendicular to the road and thereby
blocking the remaining two lanes.
Unreal.
The 101 came to a dead stop. I screamed
and put the car in park. Eons later the four
fire-trucks and two police officers had a lane
open.
As 1 hit the beautifully clear road 1 put
the pedal to the metal and raced on.
After another mile of clear cruising, I
saw the dreaded twinkle ol brake lights.
Then 1 spent live miles whizzing along at 12
miles an hour. For you non■mathematically
inclined people that means almost a hall an
hour to no about the circumference ol ( am

pus Drive.
This seagull looking for trash on the
median was moving faster than my ear.
To make it worse, temptation reared it's
ugly little head: the earpool lane was doing
at least 35 miles an hour. And it was 4:15
p.m. Only 15 minutes into earpool time.
I sal there alone in the ear, desperately
wishing for a friend. I thought about just
jumping into the lane and praying that I
wouldn't he pulled over and reeeive the
$375 fine.
And even if I did get pulled over. I would
show the eop my Massachusetts license and
plead out-of-state ignorance.
After I passed a rather large sign delin
eating the earpool rules. I decided that I
couldn't plead ignorance considering 1 could
read the sign clearly at my 12-mph speed.
I thought about taking my jacket and hat
and trying to make a dummy in the passen
ger seal. I low clever. I thought! But when I
looked m the back of the car for anything I
could use to hold up the "body," I found my
friend's car was irritatingly neat.
So I sat there. I inally I made my way
around a car that had jumped the median,
and I again Inl the accelerator with all my
might in a race toward I mbarcadero. By
that time I was a lull 40 minutes late for my
meeting. I figured with no more stops I

would make the last few minutes. I would
apologize as we all shared a laugh about
those wacky C alifornian drivers.
As I chuckled a Hurry of red lights again
caught my attention. I looked ahead and
discovered another three-car pile up. I came
to a stop and began banging my head
against the steering-wheel.
1 hen I started using words mv mother
does not like. Hig, loud, evil, words. Lots of
them.
I managed to amuse myself with yelling
these vulgarities out the window and giving
lots of hand gestures.
I inally I joined a train of cars speeding
along the side of the road toward the exit
ramp, trying to get as far away from the
monster this state personifies as The 101.
And that is when 1 watched a Buick shoot
right off the exit ramp and into the trees.
At this point I was between laughing and
sobbing. This was surreal. It is just rain. It
happens. Things get wet, but life goes on.
I Jnless you are on The 101.
