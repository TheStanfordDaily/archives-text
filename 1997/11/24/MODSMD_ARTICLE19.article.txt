## Card falls to Badgers, Purdue 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
History repeated itself — in more ways than one.
. Not only did the fourth-ranked Stanford women's
basketball team stumble to a whopping 31 turnovers
(much like it did against Old Dominion in last year's
Final Four, when the Cardinal had 29). but it also
dropped its season opener for the second time in three
seasons. This time. No. 25 Wisconsin upended Stanford
90-82 before 6,927 in the raucous Wisconsin Field
House.
History further compounded itsell two days later
when Stanford struggled in another hostile environ
ment (Purdue's Mackey Arena), losing to the Boiler
makers 78-68 to drop to 0-2 lor the first time since the
1984-85 season.
I he 0-2 start is the first ever under head coach I'ara
VanDerveer and represents Stanford's first consecu
live losses since January 1994.
"I was disappointed with the play of our from court

with our experience." VanDcrveer said. Senior center
()lympia Scott "didn't finish they way she's capable of.
and (senior forward I leather ()wen) is going to have U>
step up."

Indeed, aside from senior forward Vanessa Ny
gaard, who led the team in scoring both games with 24
and 23 points, respeetively. the fronteourt only had
spurts ol limited suecess while shooting a collective 41
percent from the floor.
l"he poor fronteourt play not only put pressure on
the inexperienced sophomore baekcourt ol Melody IV
terson. Christina Batastini aiul Milena I lores, it also
forced VanDerveer to plav her freshmen down the
stretch with Scott and Owen in foul
trouble.
As a result, turnovers (including
yesterday's 20) were in abundance,
and that, of course, bogged down
the offense.
But for the first half Friday night,
things were holding relatively
steady. The Cardinal turned the ball
over IS times, but it was shooting a
solid 55 percent from the field, in
cluding S-of-12 from behind the arc.
Flores and Nygaard each had 14
points in a back-and-forth first half
that saw the Card eke out a 48-45
halftime lead.
But the shooting cooled off, the
turnovers piled up and the foul
trouble caught up with Stanford as
Wisconsin stretched its lead to 68-62
with a little more than 11 minutes
left. Stanford made a final push,
mostly on the force of Nygaard's
shooting and Peterson's driving
layups.
The sophomore guard finished
the game with 18 points, three as
sists and no turnovers.
"I was really pleased with how
|Peterson| played," VanDerveer
said. "She had a great game. She
helped us defensively and with her
scoring."
But the Cardinal could draw no
closer than four points in the final
two minutes, as Wisconsin — hav
ing never beaten a top-five oppo
nent earned arguably the biggest
win in the program's history. I he
highest-ranked team the Badgers
had beaten previously was No. 10
Notre Dame last season.
The 90 points was the most Stan
ford has allowed since it gave up 105
to Tennessee in the IW4- 1 )5 season.
"First of all. they're a good
shooting team," VanDerveer said.

"1 felt defensively, we didn't help
ourselves. But we didn't get any
help, either. I here were situations
where people became so paranoid
about getting fouls that they weren't
aggressive enough.
"The other thing was that we
pressed and we gave up some easy
baskets. Sometimes, we just didn't
make quick adjustments."
Stanford had appeared to snap
out of it yesterday against the Boil
ermakers, bursting out to a 15-2 lead
in the first five minutes and taking
the 7,665 Mackey maniacs out of the
game — momentarily.
But led by junior guard
Stephanie White, the Boilermakers
chipped away at the lead. Junior
point guard Ukari Figgs chipped in
with four assists as Purdue closed
the gap to a very manageable 35-2 1 )
at halftime.
Basically, the same things
doomed the Cardinal to defeat, wit h
a little help from the Boilermaker
backcourt of l iggs and White.
Figgs' three-pointer at the 12:32
mark put Purdue up for the first
time, 46-45. while White's first hall
was only a glimmer of what was to
come.
All told, the backcourt duo com
bined for 33 of Purdue's 4 l ) second
half points, clearly outclassing the
best Stanford had to offer.
Scott struggled once again, fin
ishing with only five points before
fouling out with 3:37 left. The ensu
ing free throws by (whoelse?) l iggs
gave Purdue the lead for good at 67-
66. Stanford never recovered, going
without a field goal in the final 5:20,
as the Boilermakers sealed the
game with a 17-3 imi
"I think we really missed the ex
perience of Naomi | Mulitauaopele|
or Kristin [Folkl], because we were
going with freshmen who looked a
little da/ed out there," VanDerveer
said.
