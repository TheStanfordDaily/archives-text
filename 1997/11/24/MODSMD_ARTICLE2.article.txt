whistle at Big Game on Saturday, as
both Cal and Stanford fans both in
vaded the field after the game and
Cal fans succeeded in tearing down
Stanford Stadium goalposts.
After Stanford's win and after the
Axe had been paraded on the field,
Stanford fans rushed through an
opened gate, apparently in an effort
to mob the Axe.
Some time afterward Cal fans, ap
parently responding to taunting from
Stanford fans and players, began to
jump fences and went on the field
themselves. Several of them then
climbed the north goalpost and
pulled it down. Both uprights were
torn off. with Cal fans removing one
of them and Stanford fans taking
back the other.
Several people were reportedly
cited and released by police, altht >ugh
police officials could not be reached
for comment.

"about a minute." he said, when he
was struck in the forehead b\ a sharp
