### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
The action didn't end with the
whistle at Big Game on Saturday, as
both Cal and Stanford fans both in
vaded the field after the game and
Cal fans succeeded in tearing down
Stanford Stadium goalposts.
After Stanford's win and after the
Axe had been paraded on the field,
Stanford fans rushed through an
opened gate, apparently in an effort
to mob the Axe.
Some time afterward Cal fans, ap
parently responding to taunting from
Stanford fans and players, began to
jump fences and went on the field
themselves. Several of them then
climbed the north goalpost and
pulled it down. Both uprights were
torn off. with Cal fans removing one
of them and Stanford fans taking
back the other.
Several people were reportedly
cited and released by police, altht >ugh
police officials could not be reached
for comment.
Nick Grossman, a freshman, was
one casualty of the post-game ruckus.
Grossman had been on the field for
"about a minute." he said, when he
was struck in the forehead b\ a sharp
projectile from the ( al student sec
tion.
The plastic surgeon at Stanford
1 losptal. who guessed (irossman had
been struck by a rock, gave him ten

stitches in two layers clue to the depth
of the cut.
According to Carol Oakes. a nurs
ing supervisor at Stanford Hospital,
between four and six people were ad
mitted with injuries relating to Big

(lame activities. All but one were re
leased that day.and the other was in
stable condition yesterday afternoon
and expected to be released soon.
Oakes did not find the number of
people admitted extraordinarily high

lor a major football game.
Pregame displays of animosity,
however, did reach an unusual level.

The only thing sprayed on the
statue was "Cal," and many see the
incident as springing from rivalry
rather than anti-gay prejudice.
The Daily Californian.Carsstu
dent newspaper, also encountered
controversy when it ran a column
Thursday urging the Golden Bears
to win in often violent terms.
The column included exhorta
tions to "humiliate the schools who
replace integrity and excellence
with patrician posturing," "remind
[Stanford students] what punk
mama's boys (and girls) they are,"
and "show your spirit on Chelsea
[(linton's] bloodied carcass."
The paper's editors apologized
unreservedly the next day, saying
that the column "seriously under
mined [Clinton's] physical safety
and the Daily Californian's reputa
tion as a forum for responsible dis
cussion."
As part of a visit entirely unre
lated to the column. First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton will be
speaking at a town hall meeting on
U( -Berkeley's campus tonight.
