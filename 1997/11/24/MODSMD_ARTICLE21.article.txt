its depth, talent and experience.
"The women are very excited,"
said assistant coach Beth Alford-
Sullivan. "We are very confident;
(we) feel prepared going into the
championships. We're also very re
laxed."
The feeling on the men's side is
similar.
"There's definitely a feeling of
excitement," said assistant coach
Mike Reilly. "We've tried all season
to prepare, to be effective and to be
in a good position going into the
championship."
Stanford's confidence is support
ed by its national rankings. But
while the Cardinal was atop the
polls for most of the season, peren
nial powerhouse Arkansas was
ranked No. 1 in the latest Martin
Surfacing men's cross country rank
ings. The Stanford men are ranked
just behind the Razorbacks, but
ahead of other top programs like
Colorado, Michigan and Wisconsin
— all of which the Cardinal faces on
the course today.
The Stanford women maintained
the top spot in the Finish Lynx
women's cross country ranking,
ahead of a strong BYl! team and the
Wisconsin Badgers.
Of course, rankings won't c -unt
for much today, when the bid for the
national title boils down to a half
hour of total concentration, desire
and all-out physical exertion.
"We're prepared to go in and ex
ecute the race plans that we've been
working on." Alford-Sullivan said.
"We've just got to go in there and
give it a good shot."
The Cardinal will take eight run
ners for both the men and the
women; seven will run and one will
serve as alternate.

For the women, look for fresh
man Julia Stamps, sophomore Sally
Glvnn. junior Mary Cobb and se
nior Sarna Renfro to finish in their
usual tight-knit pack toward the
tront of the field. Those four will be
joined by some combination of
freshman Ann Ramsey, sophomore
Mary Huang and seniors Sara
Moore and Kortney Dunscombe.
The women will run with a famil
iar strategy on a familiar course.
"All season long we've keyed off
looking for the Cardinal color," Al
ford-Sullivan said. "It's a matter of
getting refamiliarized with the
course, running in a tight pack up
front and really keying off each
other."
The men boast an impressive
lineup, deep with NCAA champi
onship experience. The Cardinal
will likely be led by senior Nathan
Nutter and juniors Brad and Brent
Hauser, all of whom gained All-
America honors at last year's cham
pionships. Senior Jason Lunn will
also make the trip along with juniors
Chris Lundstrom, Jonathan Wel
don and Jason Balkman. Freshman
Jonathon Riley rounds out the
eight-man contingent.
The men will use their experi
ence on the course (from the Fur
man Invitational Oct. 11) to their
advantage.
"They have a good feel for how
the course runs. There won't be any
surprises," Reilly said. "They are
very confident."
Although the Cardinal runners
are among the nation's best in terms
of talent and physical ability, it is
perhaps their supreme confidence
and relaxed attitude that will be
hardest for other teams to over
come. But all the build-up and talk
will be quelled when the gun sounds
and the men's race begins.
"It's the race that matters," Al
ford-Sullivan said.
