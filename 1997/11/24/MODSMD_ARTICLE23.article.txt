# In the wake of Big Game...
## 
### 
One hundred years into the ri
valry, Stanford has only
outseored Cal hy a total of
90 points. That's why it's the Big
Game.
•( "al's stupidity on the field Satur
day (nine penalties for 89 yards) was
only exceeded hy its fans' stupidity
after the game.
•Troy Walters was given the
chance to return only one of eight
(iolden Bear punts. That's fear.
•Stanford will miss Kevin Miller
the punter (45.4-yard average on
seven punts Saturday) but not Kevin
Miller the place-kicker (5-of-ll on
field goals for the season).
•The smartest move Stanford
Stadium security made after the
game was opening the Cardinal stu
dent section gates and allowing fans
to file through in an orderly manner.
It could have saved lives.

•Speaking of stadium security,
guards in bright yellow jackets made
a fire-safety sweep through the stu
dent section in the second half,
threatening students standing in
aisles with ejection from the game if
they didn't move. No one 1 saw was
removed, but there were eight peo
ple crammed into one seat in the row
below me.
•For the first three quarters, the
idea of free seat cushions seemed
like a good one. In the fourth quar
ter, when living white squares of
foam began nailing fans in the back
of the head, it seemed pretty stupid.
•The University should consider
retaining the alumni yell-leaders, all
of whom graduated in the '30s. on a
permanent basis.
•With Damon Dunn, Anthony
Bookman, Mike Mitchell. Greg
Cornelia and Jon Ritchie all graduat
ing, I'm not above begging Chad
Hutchinson not to sign a pro base
ball contract.
•The Stanford Band was at its
best Saturday: spirited, energetic
and funny. Sunday morning, no one
mentioned Notre Dame.
•With one illegal take-down Sat
urday, Mitchell lost a chance to im
pact his final Big Game, a shot at
third place on the Stanford all time
rushing list and. perhaps, his football
career.
•If nothing else, IW7 Gaieties
was prophetic: Stanford Stadium
was a giant commercial Saturday.
•The public address announcer
implored students to clear the field
after the game because "I want to go
home." Maybe if he had offered to
stop plugging corporate sponsors at
every pause in the action....
•Defensive back Than Merrill, a
redshirt freshman thrust into a key
role in the Cardinal defense due to
injuries, had 4 1/2 tackles and
helped force a tumble Saturday,
which isn't bad foi a guy who was
playing quarterback last year.
•Senior defensive star Chris
Draft, who missed the beginning of
the season only to return to a team
on a horrid losing streak, fittingly
ended his career on a high note with
his game-sealing fourth-quarter in
terception.
•I don't care if you know the
other team is watching for the inside
handoft you don't pitch the ball
deep in your own territory with time
running out.
•There are kids in Scandinavia
who have never seen American foot
ball that know the winning team, and
the winning team only, reserves the
right to tear down the goalposts.
•Forget 5-6. The only set of num
bers that matters to most Cardinal
fans is 21-2(1.
Given a choice between a bowl
and an Axe. most of us would choose
the latter.
