Good things often come in small
packages.
Case in point: redshirt sopho
more wide receiver Troy Walters,
who shattered the record books and
helped Stanford vanquish Califor
nia in Saturday's lOOth Big (iame.
Walters came up with some big
receptions against the Golden
Bears, just as he's been doing to
Cardinal opponents all year.
Early in the second quarter with
the Card holding a 7-0 advantage,
Walters broke loose. ()n second and
four from the Stanford's own 48-
yard line, sophomore quarterback
Chad Hutchinson dropped back to
pass and connected with Walters for
a 35-yard pass play, moving the ball
to Cal's 17.
Although the possession ended
with a turnover deep in Bears" terri
tory. Walters' catch essentially set
up Stanford's second touchdown.
Cal's offense could only produce
four yards on its next drive, and a
short punt gave Stanford the ball on
( al's 38. From there, senior running
back Anthony Bookman needed
only two rushes to score and give the
Card a 13-point lead.
Walters' next big play gave the
Card a two-touchdown lead it never

relinquished. Facing third and four
from the Bears' 36, Hutchinson
looked over the middle and once
again found Walters, who scam
pered into the end /one for his
eighth touchdown of the year and
his fifth in the last three games.
"The season has been beyond my
expectations," Walters said. "My
personal goal was 50-plus catches.
But I really wanted to just help the
team out in any way."
()n the day, Walters recorded six
receptions for KM) yards the most
receiving yards by a Stanford player
in a Big (iame since IW6. 1 lis 86 re
ceptions this season are the most in
Stanford history, eight more than
the previous record set by Brad
Muster in WB5.
Walters also set a new Stanford
mark for most receiving yards in a
season with 1,206, breaking a 2 1 )-
year record held by Gene Washing
ton.
Of course, it didn't hurt that
quarterback Chad Hutchinson was
on the money all day. After suffer
ing a thumb injury that knocked him
out of last week's game at Washing
ton State, Hutchinson bounced
back by completing 21 of 25 passes
for 194 yards.
I lutchinson "was great," Walters
said. "The past two weeks have been
hard on him; he had to overcome a

lot of adversity. And he did that
today. He came out and led the of
fense and was a great leader."
Walters' reliable hands and abili
ty to find openings have made him
one of Hutchinson's favorite tar
gets. Nearly hall of Hutchinson's
passing yards this season were
gained by Walters.
"He just happens to get open a
lot of the time," Hutchinson said.
"I'm not really always looking for
him, but he seems to always be in the
right place and the right time, fie
just gets open and makes great
plays."
Having a receiver like senior
Damon Dunn lining up on the op
posite side also adds to Walters'
game. Cal's defense had its hands
full with Dunn, who reeled in nine
passes for 73 yards.
" The coaches, the players, the se
nior class — they have been very in
fluential in my progress," Walters
said. "By just watching them, watch
ing the players who came before me
it's just total effort."
Aside from any record-setting,
Walters will remember the l(H)th
Big Game for the same reason that
most Stanford fans will.
"We got the win," Walters said.
"The win comes first. If I didn't
break the record, and we won, I'd be
ecstatic."
