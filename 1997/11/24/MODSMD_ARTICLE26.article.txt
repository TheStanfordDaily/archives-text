# No re-Play for Cal
## Penalties and costly turnovers doom Bears' Big Game hopes despite late rally 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
It ended the only way it could,
the way everybody expected this
Big Ciame to finish.
One team would save lace on a
terrible season and — at least for a
brief moment — make everyone
forget about earlier woes. The
other would merely be forgotten.
And so California finished qui
etly with a 3-8 season, despite mak
ing this the closest Big Game in
three years.
It doesn't matter that the C'ardi
nal was outplayed on paper. I lie-
Bears rushed for 148 yards com
pared to Stanford's dismal 4(>.
Bears quarterback Justin Vedder
threw for 232 yards; Cardinal sig
nal-caller Chad Hutchinson threw
for only l l >4.
It also doesn't matter that the
Cardinal was completely stifled
after halftime. I he second hall saw
Stanford's offense go dormant, and
a Cal comeback seemed inevitable.
But these facts and numbers
won't be remembered. I he only
things fans from either side will re
member are Vedder's interceptions

to junior safety Corey I lill and se
nior linebacker ( lnis I )raft, as well
as his inability to get a pass oil on
the final play of the game.
II was a lough brbak lot us and
for me," Vedder said. "I'm just try
ing to make a play, and something
bad happened to me. I hings like
this are going to happen, but it's
how you play that makes you a
great player."
When the season opened, Stan
ford was a Rose Bowl contender
and the Bears were supposed to
light to stay out ol the conference
basement. No one expected the
Bears to be able to compete with
the C 'animal.
But as the year progressed, Stan
ford's five-game skill and Cal's
solid play against better opponents
began raising eyebrows.
Many people believed the Bears
would beat Stanford especially
the Beats.
"We were very confident," I 10l
nioe said. "We all felt like we were
going to win the game. At key junc
tures, we just did not make the
plays.
"I think our emotions were right.
It was a great game. Nobody really

panicked. We had some opportuni
ties, but we didn't make good on
them."
But the Bears once again fell vic
tim to big plays The Bears li.kl al
ready given up 16 touchdowns on
plays ol at least 35 yards before Sat
urday.
I lill's interception return was 41
yards, and redshirt sophomore
flanker hoy Walters caught a
touchdown pass of 36 yards.
"It was a good effort lot the most
part," llolmoe said. "But I'm not
satisfied with hO yard touchdowns.
Ill never be satisfied with 60-yard
touchdowns."
( al did gel a very solid perfor
mance from |unior wide receiver
Dameane Douglas, who pulled
down I I passes for 143 yards.
Veddei also a junior showed
his ability to elude tacklers, scram
bling away from 10 possible sacks to
gain an extra 30 yards.
Now I lolmoe wants to move on
and begin preparing lor next year.
"3-8 is unacceptable. We have a
lot of work ahead of lis," llolmoe
said. "Now it's time to improve on
the areas ol the team that we feel
need improvement."
