### Tomoeh Murakami Senior staff writer 
The 1 (K)th Big Game was, for
certain, ;i very big game.
"Please step to the side and clear
the aisles, or you will be removed."
The pleas of helpless security
guards could be heard in the stands
throughout the game.
"( 'ould you just scoot down a lit
tie so I can see the game?" students
shouted out in desperation at other
Cardinal fans sitting in front ol
them.
It was well expected that numer
ous past Cardinal football greats
such as US graduate Justin Armour,
formerly a wide receiver with the
Buffalo Bills and Philadelphia Ea
gles, and 4 l >ers tight end (ireg
Clark, ( lass of ' l ) 7 would return
to Stanford Stadium for the 100 th
edition of Big (lame.
"I think it's great there's an
event we can come back to," Ar
mour said. "It's great to see all mv
buddies."
Also expected were ardent
alumni fans such as Jon Arthur,
( lass of '70. who was back on cam
pus for his 28th Big (lame.
"I've seen almost every Big
(lame since l%<S," said Arthur, an
editor at the Los Angeles limes.
"The only time I missed it was when
I had to cover the Vegas fire in
I WO."
But the KHMIi Big (lame drew
thousands more ( animal fans of all
ages and places, overflowing Stan
ford Stadium. The announced
crowd of 85,000 was the biggest
football audience the stadium had
seen in eight years.
kentaro Mima, ('lass of '05, flew
into San Francisco from Tokyo,
where he currently works as a Sony
engineer.
"It's totally worth it to mids a
couple days of work" to be here for
the game, Mima said.
Rachel ( ederberg, ( lass of'%,
an admissions officer at Harvey-
Mudd College, said despite all the
hassle, coming up to the game had
been at the top of her list since the
beginning of the year.
"This is a very busy time I just
got back from eight weeks ol travel
ing all over the country," she said.
"But I gave up yet another week
end at home to make it up here any
way."
Junior Katherine Wray also re
turned to campus for"the weekend
package" with six other studentson
the Stanford in Washington pro
gram.
"I flew all the way from our na
lion's capital to see the biggest
game ol the century, in which some
serious Cal ass is going to be beat
en," she shouted at the student en
trance, over roars arising from vari
ous pregame tailgates nearby.
Timur Yarnall, a '% graduate
currently working as a manager for
a software company, said he rushed
from Dallas jList in time for the
game, where he was overseeing a
business deal
"My client wanted me to stay
through the weekend, but I said
no," said Yarnall, a former All
American ( animal rugby player.
"I had to come back the rival
ry's so fierce in mv blood from
rugby," he said. "Ill go back to I )al
las lirsi thing Monday morning."
Still others who say they had
full faith the Card would beat Cal
all along chose to focus their at
tcntion on something other than
the actual game.
"I came clown foi 4X hours ot
drinking debauchery," saiil Ko
drigucz (lutierrcz, ( lass ol '97, who
coaches varsity soccer at a high
school in ()akland. "I hope the kids
understood that I |list had to be
here today for this game, and not at
their scrimmage."
According to David Bergan,
Class ol '94. the 100 th Big (lame
was the perfect excuse to come
back to Stanford.
"I figured it was the best chance
I'd have to see people I haven't seen
in years," he said.

flew in from ( hicago to see Bergan,
