# Daily ekes out win over Daily Cal thugs
## 
### Ref 
In a fitting prelude to the l(H)th
Big Game, The Stanford Daily
scored dramatic touchdowns at the
end of each half to top The Daily
C'alifornian 20-13 in Saturday's Ink
Bowl at the frozen tundra of Roble
Field.
"I'm ecstatic," said quarterback
and captain Jim "Kill the zebra"
Tankersley, who tossed three touch
down passes. "The check we paid
the ref must have bounced, but we
won anyway."
Daily Cal players arrived 45 min
utes late, saying they were looking
for a goalpost to tear down. Frus
trated in their efforts, they apparent
ly were not focused at kickoff, as
Sam "Bulldozer" Mankiewicz
scored 011 a long touchdown pass
just 32 seconds into the game.
"Just give me the ball,"
Mankiewicz said with a growl. "I will
crush all the little people."
But Cal's all-testosterone squad
proved adept at overcoming offsides
penalties with brute force. The
teams appeared headed for a 6-(i tie
at halftime when Mankiewicz al
most caught a long touchdown.
After much arguing, pass interfer
ence was called, setting up the final
play of the half from deep in Stan
ford territory.
In the most amazing, sensational,
dramatic, heart-rending, exciting,
thrilling play in the history of Ink
Bowl. Tankersley underthrew a Hail
Mary. Rockin' Robin "Orange
shoes" Davidson tipped the pass shy
of the goal line — right to Bobby
"What haircut?" Cuza, who caught
the ball in stride and ran into the end
zone.
"I saw the Falcons try this once."
Davidson said. "That Jim Tankers
ley— he's no Billy Joe Tolliver."
Cal refused to fold after Immacu
late Reception 111. badgering the of
ficial and chipping away at Stan

ford's tough defense, anchored by
captain Brian "Kailee" Singer. Even
the voracious pass rush of blitzing
Alda Leu and Gil "Show me the
Marlboro" Lopez couldn't keep Cal
from going ahead on a controversial
extra point in the closing minutes.
The running of Robert "Sweet
ness" Chiles moved the ball in the
second half but infuriated the Cal
players, who complained of flag
guarding. Elise "I'm editing it" Lip
kowitz, who could start on Har
vard's squad, Jimmy "Grandpa"
Boegle, "Big bad" Bimal Shah and
Sanford "Let me tell you a story"
Dickert kept Cal's rush at bay.
An interception with under two
minutes to go appeared to clinch a
Cal victory and sent Tankersley into
a frenzy. Thinking pass interference
was blatant, he had to be restrained
by Ed "Theismann" Guzman, who
was injured 011 the final play of prac
tice the day before.
But Singer came up with a huge
sack and Cal fumbled a snap, forcing
('al to punt from deep in its own ter
ritory.
With 5<S seconds left, Tankersley
anchored an Elwayesque drive. On
third and goal from inside the 5, he
called a play for Cuz using
Mankiewicz as a decoy. But
Mankiewicz' growling convinced
him to change plans, and he scram
led and found him in the corner of
the end zone for the winner with
eight seconds left.
"I wanted to call a double reverse
or a countertrey from a two tight
end set," said Carolyn "Tyrone"
Sleeth, who starred for one play.
Daily soccer mom Elizabeth Gold
man. who provided refreshments,
talked her into accepting Tankers
ley's plan.
"Grumpy" Ben Freda caught the
two-point conversion on his knees to
complete the scoring, sending the
official into retirement and sealing
Cal's fate.
