## Comic Martin gives thoughts on 'funny machines' 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Comedian Steve Martin
showed I richiy night that com
puter technology prohahly has a
way to go he lore it can compete
with a person's natural sense ol
humor.
Part ol a panel ol experts ex
ploring the theory of humor and
whether computers are moving
closer to understanding it, Martin
matched his comedic expertise
against a program called Jape,
which creates puns.
Martin's witty rejoinders to
comments by other panelists
kept the audience laughing. And
although a survey showed 110 one
could really tell the difference be
tween computer-generated and
human generated puns, Martin's
humor certainly seemed more
natural.
The symposium was the
fourth in a series organized by In
diana University Prof. Douglas
Uofstadter to address the ques
tion, "Are Computers Ap

proaching Human Level Cre
ativity?" Martin was joined on
stage before a packed Kresge
Auditorium by llolstadter. Jape
author Kim Binsted and artificial
intelligence pioneer Marvin Mm
sky.
Discussion focused on what
makes something funny, how
human beings have developed a
sense ol humor and whether that
sense is something a computer
could ever understand.
I lumorseemstobe inherently
human. Martin said, but it isn't
necessarily.
As I thought about this topic
ol computers and comedy, my
lirst thought was that comedy
was very human linked," he said.
" I he more I thought about it. I
realized I was wrong."
Robotic bears at Disneyland,
l< >r example, have kept audiences
laughing for years, lie said. And
Sojourner the robot that has
been exploring the surface ol
Mars, was funny. Martin said.
"You hail tins image of him
humping into rocks and trying to
send data."
Still, he added, much of the
humor found in everyday life is
based on a particular situation.
When he was contemplating be
coming a comedian while in college,
Martin said he decided to keep track
of what made him laugh.
"The biggest laughs we ever had
in those college days were inexplica
ble." he remembered.
Timing also is essential, he point
ed out, noting that scenes in movies
sometimes are funny only because
the director cuts away immediately
after the joke rather than continuing.
Without an obvious instruction to
laugh, Martin snid, the audience
"would eventually find a place to
laugh. When you find it yourself, it's
about a million times funnier."
Binsted admitted that her pro

gram had very little to do with argu
ing that computers can have a sense
of humor. Jape proved, however,
that it could write puns that sounded
natural.
The program is given a lexicon of
words and information about those
words, some constraints on how
words should be used and templates
within which to form a pun. About
80 percent of what it produces are
usable puns.
Given eight puns, the audience
guessed correctly whether they were
written by Jape or humans only
twice. "What kind of pig can you ig
nore at a party? A wild bore" was
Jape-generated, while "What kind
of animal runs through the forest
making other animals yawn? A wild
bore" had been published in a book
of human-generated puns.
Especially in its early stages. Jape
did make some mistakes, Binsted
said. One of the first puns it pro
duced w;is: "What do you get when
you cross a person and a thing? A

person-thing."
The pun didn't make sense but
also didn't fail completely in creating
humor. "I think many of us have
dated those," Martin quipped.
Minsky called for more research
into the psychology of humor. He ar
gued that humor allows people to
learn from their mistakes. "Jokes are
a social mechanism for instructing
people . . . about things they
shouldn't do," he said.
But the psychology of humor is
problematic, Martin said.
"The problem with a theory on
humor is the same problem with a
theory on art," he said. "The things
that fulfill what comedy is and what
art is are so diverse."
The final symposium will return
to the four major themes explored
— games, language, music and
humor — and try to answer to ulti
mate question of whether creativity
can be simulated. It is scheduled for
Dec. 6 at 10 a.m. at the Gates Com
puter Science Building.
