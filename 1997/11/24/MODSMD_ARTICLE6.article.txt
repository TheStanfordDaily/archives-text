# Students hold vigil for Korean famine
## 
### Ann Kim Contributing writer 
Stanford students will begin their
campus-wide campaign for North
Korean famine relief tonight with a
candlelight vigil in the Inner Quad at
10 p.m.
The vigil is sponsored by Stanford
Hwimori. a Korean-American cul
tural activism group, and the Stanford
Campaign for North Korea Hunger
Relief, part of the National Network
for North Korea Hunger Relief.
Many North Koreans have been
living on about 1 (X) grams of food per
day, though individuals need at least
450 grams a day to stay healthy, ac
cording to reports from relief agen
cies currently stationed in North
Korea.
The vigil will feature an an
nouncement of relief plans for the

school year and statements of sup
port from Asian-American Student
Association. Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford and repre
sentatives from San Francisco and
Berkeley relief campaigns.
As part of a national student cam
paign called " I .(KK) Voices for Reuni
fication," the Stanford campaign will
encourage students to skip one meal
per week and donate the money that
would have been used for the meal to
the hunger relief fund. Students will
also be encouraged to find sponsors
to donate money to their fasting ef
forts.
The money that is raised will be
given to the American Friends Ser
vice Committee, a national group
that collects funds for famine relief
arid also monitors the distribution of
food in North Korea to ensure that it
is done in a fair and equal manner.

Heavy flooding in North Korea in
1995 destroyed much of its farmland,
leading to a poor harvest and a plea
for international assistance. More
flooding in 1996 made attempts at re
covery difficult, and again North
Korea faced a poor harvest.
"North Korea doesn't have a lot
of farmland to begin with, and their
farming isn't advanced so they don't
get much yield." said Seung.
This year. North Korea has expe
rienced drought conditions and more
food shortages. Nearly the entire
population of approximately 23 mil
lion people has been suffering
through the famine, according to
Hwimori.
According to Seung, there have
been a lew months this year when
North Korea was completely depen
dent on international aid as a food
source.

Though Hwimori has sponsored
North Korea famine relief fundrais
ing efforts for the past two years
through education and cultural per
formances, the ongoing situation has
led to a broadening of their campaign.
"When we heard about the
drought this year we decided we
were going to try to open [the cam
paign! U P tÂ° the Stanford campus."
said Seung.
He pointed out that North
Korea's tenuous relations with other
nations have led to difficulties in re
ceiving aid from them. Several na
tions have been hesitant to give aid
due to political tension.
"It feels like the effort on campus
is geared toward de-politici/ing the
issue and dealing more with the hu
manitarian aspects of the disaster,"
said senior Brian Lee, vice-chair of
AASA.
"AASA is voicing its support of
the efforts on a primarily humani
tarian level, we're not taking a
stance on the political ramifications
of the issue," Lee said.
According to a statement from
the United Nations World Food
Program Executive Director
C atherine Bertini stated, "Without
adequate assistance we can expect
massive mortality in the coming
winter. Nutritionally, North Kore
ans are already pressed to the
limit."
