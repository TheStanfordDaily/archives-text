# Arab, Israeli student groups protest 'G.I. Jane'

A study break and a good paper
ball fight usually characterize Sunday
Flicks, but yesterdav students re
ceived an education a tolerance as
well.
The Organization of Arab Stu
dents In Stanford, in conjunction with
the Stanford Israel Alliance, handed
out petitions discussing the stereotyp
ical portrayal of Arabs in the film
"G.I. Jane," which was shown last
night.
The scene in question is the con
cluding sequence where Demi
Moore's character and the other
Navy Seals land in the Middle East
and kill a squad of Arabs.
"It's supposed to be a chance for
Demi Moore to prove her prowess as
a Navy Seal," said junior Maia

Daniels, chair of SIA. "I lowever, this
scene had very little to do with the
plot and was just gratuitous violence."
Daniels continued, "It was a very
backward scene with camels and
Bedouin-style people, which was to
tally unnecessary. It could have been
scripted much better."
Part of the controversy surround
ing "G.I. Jane" arises from the fact
that the film was produced by Mira
max films. Miramax is a subsidiary of
Walt Disney Co., which has in the
past produced several films that some
felt contained anti-Arabic stereo
types. including "Aladdin," "Father
of the Bride 2" and "()peration ( on
dor."
"They all have Arabs as terrorists
or womanizers, and they are never
balanced by positive Arab charac
ters," said Nabeel Ibrahim, a doctoral

student and president of OASIS. "A
company like Disney should be pro
moting tolerance and understanding,
but instead they're promoting hatred
and stereotypes."
Last night's activism consisted of
two components. Members of both
groups passed out fliers detailing Dis
ney's alleged history of anti-Arab
portrayals as well as descriptions of
Disney's refusal to meet with Arab
leaders. A petition calling for Disney
to put an end to anti-Arab stereo
types in movies and for Disney exec
utives to meet with Arab leaders was
circulated. Also, petitions asking
Flicks to consult with ethnic groups
on campus before bringing movies to
the big screen were passed out.
"We were not aware that there
would be a problem with the film,"
said assistant manager of Hicks

sophomore Chris Chung. "However,
if they or any other student group
wants to give us input, then they can
subscribe to the Flicks [e-mail] list,
and we will take careful note of their
comments." OASIS and SIA have
both noted that their fight is not
against Flicks but the Hollywood
filmmakers that produce the films,
specifically in this case Disney.
"Disney has been very actively ig
noring our complaints, for they have
been completely unresponsive to our
concerns," said Ibrahim. "They tried
to reconcile some of the stereotypes
in 'Aladdin,' but that was it. There's
been no effort to curb these stereo
types."
The petitioning of "G.I. Jane"
represented a continuation of the on
going struggle by OASIS to erase
perceived negative Arab stereo

types. However, they do encourage
people to view the movie. "It's im
portant for people to see this film and
to understand these stereotypes,"
said Ibrahim. "People don't con
sciously recognize these things in
movies, therefore we want them to
watch, we want them to think about
some of the stereotypes being por
trayed."
Daniels said that the Israel Al
liance worked with OASIS in peti
tioning as a way "to protest prejudice
as a universal issue." The groups have
collaborated to bring several speak
ers to campus this year.
"There are prejudices that need to
be brought to light and that is why we
need to protest. We need to make
people aware," Daniels said.
Disney representatives were not
available for comment.
