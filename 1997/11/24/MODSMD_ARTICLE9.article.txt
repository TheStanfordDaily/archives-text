Leaders discuss sanctions at APEC
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bolstered by a strong
endorsement from U.N. weapons experts, American
officials stressed yesterday that Iraq has no hope of
seeing economic sanctions lifted as long as it balks at
total access for inspectors trying to ferret out biolog
ical and chemical weapons.
"It is clear that there is a massive amount of work
that has to be done there, especially in the chemical
and biological inspection areas," President C linton
said in Vancouver, British Columbia, at a trade sum
mit of Pacific rim nations. Clinton said he is deter
mined that weapons inspectors be free to carry out
their mission.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Van
couver with Clinton for an Asia Pacific economic
conference, said international inspectors "should go
back and be able to do their work unconditionally
and unfettered."
Baghdad's United Nations ambassador countered
that sanctions should be lifted now. The Iraqis have
destroyed their weapons themselves, he said.
"The sanctions will stay in place. There is no hope
of them being lifted" so long as Iraq continues to
obstruct weapons instructors and ignore other U.N.

resolutions imposed after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

"Meet the Press."
NASA plans satellite retrieval
SPACE CENTER. Houston (AP) — Astronauts
Winston Scott and I'akao Doi were trained to grab a
3,(XX)-pound satellite with their gloved hands. But
not when it's spinning.
They might have to learn fast, since NASA is con
sidering asking the Columbia crew to do just that.
Yesterday morning, mission managers met to con
tinue discussing how to retrieve the Spartan satellite,
which was left tumbling in space after its release from
Columbia went awry Friday afternoon. The leading
option was to have Scott and Doi attempt to capture
the satellite during an already scheduled spacewalk
tonight; a decision was expected yesterday.
"We will do it when we feel it's safe to do and we
have worked out all the kinks and all our plans." mis
sion operations director I • Iriscoe said late Friday.
The satellite inadvert. was sent into a slow
spin when the crew member who set it free with the
shuttle's 50-foot crane tried to get H back right away
after realizing it wasn't working properly.
