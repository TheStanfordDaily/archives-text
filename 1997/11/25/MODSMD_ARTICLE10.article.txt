## Stanford work Shops SWOPSI ON Political and Social Issues 
### Darlene Damm 
I watched as T curled up on his bed, a heap of frustration, a mass of desperation, utterly lost and
searching for an answer. "I don't know what I'm going to do," he said, "I'm tired of being here. I m
sick of Stanford." I offered some comforting words, I earnestly suggested answers, but in the end I
left his room and headed out to the balcony where I could fall into thought with the night...
In silence we sat around the table, books open in front of us waiting for someone to speak.
It seemed that in section people either over spoke to demonstrate that they had done the reading or
otherwise sat in deplorable silence. When words were finally spoken, they came out meekly, "I don t
really know, but..." or "I guess you could say that....* or "Maybe you can say..None of us really
wanted to be there; I even caught the TA's eyes watching the clock...
We stood on the shimmering grass consuming strawberries and chocolate and champagne
with University President Gerhard Casper. Glossy smiles and pleasant greetings filled the air, that is,
they filled the air until the questions began, or perhaps I should, say, until the complaints, began.
Students raised their hands requesting recreation equipment, club leaders shouted out demands for
group space, and other students brought up the hackneyed housing problem. The complaints grew
louder and harder, and suddenly those chocolates arid strawberries weighed heavy in my stomach.
I was glad when Gary finally asked the President to describe his happiest moment of the day.

I pull these three anecdotes from my
Stanford experience. They symbolize two
of the most urgent, yet largely unarticulat
ed problems that plague the Stanford commu
nity. First, our community lacks a passion for
learning. It is a problem when students moan
and complain in their dorm rooms about
Stanford, their course work and their lack of
direction in life. It is a problem when students
and teachers arc not excited to be in class. It is
a problem when students speak with Stanford's
president about operational issues rather than
intellectual issues. Second, our community
lacks the self-confidence, optimism and gump
tion necessary for solving problems and defin
ing and creating a better way of life. It is a
problem when students wither away in their
dorm rooms rather than confronting and deal
ing with personal and academic issues. It is a
problem when students belittle themselves and
their ideas by speaking meekly in class. It is a
problem when students immediately turn to
the administration to answer their complaints
rather than independently and creatively solv
ing the problems themselves.
Life at Stanford need not be this way.
Currently I am researching a time period in
Stanford's history when the community pas
sionately embraced learning and eagerly con
fronted their problems. This era began in the
late 19605, and, I believe, is best captured in a

phenomenon called SWOPSI.
SWOPSI stands for Stanford Workshops
on Political and Social Issues. In 1969 three
Stanford students created SWOPSI to make
their education more meaningful. SWOPSI
workshops were extra-departmental classes that
experimented with alternative curriculums and
unconventional ways of teaching and learning.
Students, teachers and anyone from the com
munity could teach or enroll in a SWOPSI
class. The classes studied issues that were rele
vant to students at a global or local level and
concluded with students producing an "action
project" that contributed to the community.
For example, during the 1970s students
observed that a drug problem existed at
Stanford.
Through the setting of a SWOPSI class,
students analyzed the campus drug problem
and proposed solutions to it. Eventually
SWOPSI established the Bridge, Stanford's
peer counseling center. Similarly, theme hous
es and Stanford recycling programs sprung
forth from SWOPSI classes. Furthermore,
SWOPSI classes worked with such issues as the
Pescadero Dam, Stanford's investments in
South Africa, pollution in the Peninsula region
and housing and transportation problems in
the Bay Area. With reports (sometimes pub
lished) in hand, SWOPSI students influenced
policy at the local and national level. In the

1980s, they also focused on women's issues and
multicultural issues. In the early 1990s
SWOPSI classes dealt with the Persian Gulf
War. SWOPSI ended in 1991. I am still
researching the cause of its demise.
The creation and life span of SWOPSI
reveals to us a great deal about former student
attitudes toward education. The projects
SWOPSI students embraced required huge
amounts of energy and dedication. Such aspi
rations would not have transpired if students
had approached their classes with minimal
enthusiasm. SWOPSIs commitment toward
learning is best embodied in their course cata
logues. In their statement of purpose SWOP
SI wrote:
"Students looking at the Stanford curriculum see
little relation between the courses being offered and
problems of our society— urban plight and the ghetto .
. .outrageous influence of the military. . .pollution
and destruction of the environment. . .We are a few
students who feel that the urgency of these problems
warrants a more active approach and have organized
several issues to study issues of local and national con
cern directly - specifically in order to consider what
can be done about them. " (Fall quarter Course
Catalogue, 1969).
SWOPSI students attempted to change the
curriculum of the University in order to study
the issues they cared about. The image of stu
dents creating their own classes—writing up
petitions and syllabi, producing course readers

THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM:
AN IMPACT WORKSHOP

Clara County)
Kent Lombard (DJPO - SC Co.)
Bill James (DJPO-SC Co.)
George Lazarus (DJPO-SC Co.)
The illusive character of the 'welfare of the
minor" and the "interests of the state" can be used by
agencies and organizations within the community as a
shell game to propagate and enhance their own needs —
at times to the exclusion of the actual needs of the
minor and the community at large. Are the vast
resources of the Probation Department and community
at immense expense to all, utilized in such a manner
as to aid the young; or are they largely used to pro
tect the system which provides great benefits to those
who propagate the system itself ?
Milton L. Luger, the Director of the New York
State Correction System's Division of Youth, has
observed, "It would probably be better for all con
cerned if young delinquents were not detected, appre
hended and institutionalized. Too many of them get
worse in our care." (Crime in America, Ramsey Clark),
We will attempt to look into this problem, the
Juvenile Justice System, by placing workshop members
directly into the Juvenile Justice System, for the pur
pose of awareness, investigation, gathering informa
tion and data for the purpose of publishing and
reporting the study to directly effect and impact the
system.

and forming lesson plans—lies in such stark
contrast to the students of today who arrive at
class sleepy-eyed and detached from the ideas
underlying their lectures.
The above excerpt from the SWOPS I
course catalogue also reveals how students
responsibly and confidently acted to alleviate
the problems they found within the education
system. Forming classes demonstrates initia
tive and optimism. However, SWOPSI not
only tackled issues of local importance, they
also delved beyond the university's sandstone
walls. These aspirations of SWOPSI students
were recorded in the course catalogue descrip
tions. One class claimed, "Our work will cul
minate in the preparation of a detailed publi
cation which will serve as a basic reference on
the Mid-Peninsula housing situation."
Another class dealing with research policy and
society stated:
This workshop will begin an analysis of national,
industrial, and university research policies. We shall
analyze principles governing experimentation on

human beings and the physician-patient reLitionship
for their potential value in establishing more general
definitions oj relations between science and society.
A third class called "Arms Control and
Disarmament Negotiations Between the US
and the U.S.S.R.. claimed that, "I'his work
shop should try to arrange a conference
between Russian and American students who
have studied disarmament questions."
SWOPSI students even believed that they
could influence the US government. A class
named "Scientists, Engineering, and Decision
Making in Washington stated":
After surveying Congressmen as to the shortcom
ings in the scientific advise they receive, we hope to
propose a more effective system from bringing scientif
ic and technical advice to Congress. Perhaps we may
also be able to find a more successful system for influ
encing technological decisions by the Executive branch
of the government than presently exists.
Such mighty ideas are anomalies in the stu
dent body today. But as 1 stated earlier, this
need not be the case. The students who creat

eel SWOPS I did not possess better resources or
opportunities than we do. We probably use the
same silverware that they once used, we cry,
laugh and love in the same dorm rooms that
they once cried, laughed and loved in, and we
twist our keys into the same post-office boxes
that they once used. Yet, we do not possess
their love for learning and their tremendous
display of self-confidence and optimism, and
most importantly their understanding that we,
as students, are responsible for making our
education meaningful. People tell me that stu
dents were different back then because of the
Vietnam War and the social change occurring
in the United States. However, I still believe it
is possible to appreciate and love learning, and
be empowered and confident without the cat
alysts of chaos and war.
Although I have spent much of this
article criticizing the Stanford community, I
know that many people do care about learn
ing, and do actively change their communities
and own lives. It seems that over the last few

years the academic administration has been
attempting to create enthusiasm for learning
by establishing trosh and sophomore seminars,
sophomore college, and honors college.
Furthermore, students have been trying to
take a more active role in their education by
creating service learning classes. However,
most of these programs remain in isolated
pockets, only available to certain students.
Opportunities that increase a love for learning
and that teach self-confidence and responsibil
ity need to be the norm on campus.

Darlene Damrn is a senior majoring in
history. She is writing her honors thesis
on SWOPS I and would love to speak
with you if you know anything about it.

THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION:
SOCIAL BOON OR MENACE?
Sponsor: George E. Porsythe (Computer Science)
Leader: R. Wade Cole
This course continues a systematic study begun during
Pall quarter of modern high speed computers and their
influence on society. Workshop participants spent a fair
amount of time during the first quarter reaching a com
mon viewpoint about the basics of computers and their
uses. They then moved to the study of an actually pro
posed personnel file system from the point of view of its
potential threat to individuals whose personal data
records are maintained in it. As a result of this work,
two specific objectives have been set for the course this
quarter: 1) a careful analysis of the specific file sys
tem mentioned above, including an assessment of how it
can result in abuses of individual privacy and a rec
ommendation of whether systems like it should be under
taken at all, and 2) a charter for operating a Pederal
Computer Information Commission that would have
responsibilities analogous to the FCC; it would oversee
all computer uses in the private and public sectors that
deal with personnel data files above a certain size.

Focus on the Black Athlete:
Hero, Pawn or Twentieth Century Gladiator?
SWOP 170
Leader(s):Harry Edwards (Professor of Sociology,
U.C. Berkeley)
Sponsor: William Gould (Law)
We will explore issues, problems and
developments at the interface of race and Bport
in American society. More specifically, the
focus will be upon the historical evolution,
current circumstances and prospects of the
Black athlete. Special attention will be paid
to the topics of Black student athletes on the
traditionally White campus; the Black athlete
and the politics of domestic and international
sport, and the Black athlete as deviant.
Objectives will be (1) to increase stu
dent awareness of the often hidden but social
ly significant race-related conflicts, contra
dictions and consequences of sport in America;
(2) to investigate alternative perspectives on
sport-related problems, proposed solutions, and
likely developments and outcomes; and (3) to
expose the student to the richly varied, vast
and expanding body of scholarly research and
literature on sport as a social institution.
Each three-hour class meeting will be
devoted to an hour lecture and two hours of
discussion and debate. Students will be evalu
ated on the basis of a final exam, outline of a
research project and completed project.
Enrollment is limited to 66 students.
