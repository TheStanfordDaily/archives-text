## Stanford work Shops SWOPSI ON Political and Social Issues 
### Darlene Damm 
I watched as T curled up on his bed, a heap of frustration, a mass of desperation, utterly lost and
searching for an answer. "I don't know what I'm going to do," he said, "I'm tired of being here. I m
sick of Stanford." I offered some comforting words, I earnestly suggested answers, but in the end I
left his room and headed out to the balcony where I could fall into thought with the night...
In silence we sat around the table, books open in front of us waiting for someone to speak.
It seemed that in section people either over spoke to demonstrate that they had done the reading or
otherwise sat in deplorable silence. When words were finally spoken, they came out meekly, "I don t
really know, but..." or "I guess you could say that....* or "Maybe you can say..None of us really
wanted to be there; I even caught the TA's eyes watching the clock...
We stood on the shimmering grass consuming strawberries and chocolate and champagne
with University President Gerhard Casper. Glossy smiles and pleasant greetings filled the air, that is,
they filled the air until the questions began, or perhaps I should, say, until the complaints, began.
Students raised their hands requesting recreation equipment, club leaders shouted out demands for
group space, and other students brought up the hackneyed housing problem. The complaints grew
louder and harder, and suddenly those chocolates arid strawberries weighed heavy in my stomach.
I was glad when Gary finally asked the President to describe his happiest moment of the day.

I pull these three anecdotes from my
Stanford experience. They symbolize two
of the most urgent, yet largely unarticulat
ed problems that plague the Stanford commu
nity. First, our community lacks a passion for
learning. It is a problem when students moan
and complain in their dorm rooms about
Stanford, their course work and their lack of
direction in life. It is a problem when students
and teachers arc not excited to be in class. It is
a problem when students speak with Stanford's
president about operational issues rather than
intellectual issues. Second, our community
lacks the self-confidence, optimism and gump
tion necessary for solving problems and defin
ing and creating a better way of life. It is a
problem when students wither away in their
dorm rooms rather than confronting and deal
ing with personal and academic issues. It is a
problem when students belittle themselves and
their ideas by speaking meekly in class. It is a
problem when students immediately turn to
the administration to answer their complaints
rather than independently and creatively solv
ing the problems themselves.
Life at Stanford need not be this way.
Currently I am researching a time period in
Stanford's history when the community pas
sionately embraced learning and eagerly con
fronted their problems. This era began in the
late 19605, and, I believe, is best captured in a

phenomenon called SWOPSI.
SWOPSI stands for Stanford Workshops
on Political and Social Issues. In 1969 three
Stanford students created SWOPSI to make
their education more meaningful. SWOPSI
workshops were extra-departmental classes that
experimented with alternative curriculums and
unconventional ways of teaching and learning.
Students, teachers and anyone from the com
munity could teach or enroll in a SWOPSI
class. The classes studied issues that were rele
vant to students at a global or local level and
concluded with students producing an "action
project" that contributed to the community.
For example, during the 1970s students
observed that a drug problem existed at
Stanford.
Through the setting of a SWOPSI class,
students analyzed the campus drug problem
and proposed solutions to it. Eventually
SWOPSI established the Bridge, Stanford's
peer counseling center. Similarly, theme hous
es and Stanford recycling programs sprung
forth from SWOPSI classes. Furthermore,
SWOPSI classes worked with such issues as the
Pescadero Dam, Stanford's investments in
South Africa, pollution in the Peninsula region
and housing and transportation problems in
the Bay Area. With reports (sometimes pub
lished) in hand, SWOPSI students influenced
policy at the local and national level. In the

1980s, they also focused on women's issues and
multicultural issues. In the early 1990s
SWOPSI classes dealt with the Persian Gulf
War. SWOPSI ended in 1991. I am still
researching the cause of its demise.
The creation and life span of SWOPSI
reveals to us a great deal about former student
attitudes toward education. The projects
SWOPSI students embraced required huge
amounts of energy and dedication. Such aspi
rations would not have transpired if students
had approached their classes with minimal
enthusiasm. SWOPSIs commitment toward
learning is best embodied in their course cata
logues. In their statement of purpose SWOP
SI wrote:
"Students looking at the Stanford curriculum see
little relation between the courses being offered and
problems of our society— urban plight and the ghetto .
. .outrageous influence of the military. . .pollution
and destruction of the environment. . .We are a few
students who feel that the urgency of these problems
warrants a more active approach and have organized
several issues to study issues of local and national con
cern directly - specifically in order to consider what
can be done about them. " (Fall quarter Course
Catalogue, 1969).
SWOPSI students attempted to change the
curriculum of the University in order to study
the issues they cared about. The image of stu
dents creating their own classes—writing up
petitions and syllabi, producing course readers
