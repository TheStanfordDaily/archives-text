# Student Education YOU
## Student-Led Classes of Today 
### Elizabeth Brooks 
Nearly 30 years ago, Stanford was a
political hotbed. The environment
encouraged students to take an active
part in launching their own courses and to act
as incubators for ideas. At its peak, the
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues) program engendered one
third of classes on campus, said Laura Selznick,
current director of Undergraduate Research
Opportunities. Due to fizzled funding and
swarms of heated debates over faculty involve
ment, the program collapsed in the mid 80s,
leaving a legacy of muted manifestos and rem
nants of action-oriented philosophies for
teaching. Many departments have since
streamlined a slew of first generation student
directed courses: "Sleep and Dreams,"
"Human Sexuality," "Slavic Bibliography,"
"The Meaning of Being Disabled,"
"Entrepeneurship," and the jazz curriculum in
the Music Department.
Despite the demise of the SWOPSI pro
gram, a handful of fervent students have
spawned a new breed of innovative courses
embodying the same activist spirit as their pre
decessors. Based on diverse lecture series, con
temporary community-centered curriculum
and a grocery list of points that could turn a
staid academe on its head, student-led courses
provide distinct learning opportunities.
Because there are many logistical hurdles that
tend to discourage the inception of fresh, stu
dent-driven classes, only about 5 to 10 are cur
rently on the annual course list. Yet, their
immense popularity often is marked by com
petition for seats in their limited enrollment.
Offered for the first time last spring, "Faces
of Homelessness," illustrates how creative

ingredients and unconventional approaches to
teaching can stretch the boundaries of the edu
cational experience. Bjorn Johnson, a senior in
the History Department, collaborated with
another student, Olivia Wang, under the spon
sorship of her then Resident Fellow, Ross
Shacter, to develop the course. Via these stu
dents' work, an empathogenic forum evolved
in the classroom where homeless individuals
received the opportunity to relate hard-hitting
stories about living on the streets. "I tried to
teach the class through the words of the home
less and the people that work with them,"

Johnson said. During that quarter, eight sets
of speakers were brought in, including girls in
their late teens and early 20s who shared their
experiences about the hardships of not having
adequate shelter.
In addition to classroom participation, stu
dents were required to complete outside course
work that expanded their understanding of
this human plight through similar engaged
and direct learning experiences. One assign
ment involved going to a homeless shelter for
a meal, talking to others there, learning what it

was like to have their food given to them in
such an environment. As part of the class, stu
dents also participated in a "suburban wade"
and an "urban plunge," to further their com
passion as well as street smarts. Ihe "suburban
wade" required students to follow around
homeless individuals for a day. Johnson stated
that this project enabled students to get a clos
er glimpse of "how they {the homeless] filled
their time and see what they did all day."
At the end of the quarter, students ven
tured on the "urban plunge." With a blanket
in hand, 50 cents, and a choice of three
cities —San Francisco, Berkeley or Santa
Cruz —they camped out for three days.
Chaddus Bruce, a sophomore who took the
course, described his urban plunge as a lesson
in humanity. "We went around with a street
kid. He showed us the ins and outs of getting
by in a world where most doors are closed to
you, and people aren't rooting for you," Bruce
said. Bruce came away with a deeper sensitivi
ty to the social conditions that give rise to
homelessness. "People fall through the cracks.
This class really pounded that into you." (I he
course will be offered again this spring quar
ter.)
"Generally, we started to question why is
some knowledge included and floated through
the University and some excluded," argued
Kelly Naylor, a senior whose strong commit
ment to whistle-blowing activism caused her to
push for a class with a different agenda. With
her faculty coordinator, Armin Rosencranz,
Naylor teamed up with a Stanford Board of
Trustees committee on investment responsibil
ity to creatc a course that takes a closer look at
the role of corporations on a world-wide level.
"Faces of
Homelessness"

Business classes have typically championed the
corporate model, cheerleading without chal
lenging the exploitative edge of multinational
corporations. Thus in order to fill the ostensi
ble need for the other side, "Corporate
Responsibility In the Local And Global
Environment" (Hum Bio 143) was born last
winter quarter.
Designed to help students start thinking
about corporate involvement from a critical
paradigm, the intensive four credit class
brought in a variety of experts for weekly two
hour panel discussions about issues, including
the effect of corporations in South Africa and
Burma, international labor conditions and the
dangers of hazardous wastes. At one of the

classes the former minister of the Environment
for Brazil, Jose Goldemberg, spoke about cor
porate involvement in the rainforest. Lengthy
discussion sessions followed the panels to stim
ulate further discourse on the topics opened up.
Required texts for the class, "When
Corporations Rule the World" by David
Korten, and a hefty blue class reader gave stu
dents the arsenal to blow the facade off of cor
porate image, while adding more depth to the
case studies discussed.
"For the students who are promoting the
classes I think it gives them an amazing oppor
tunity to work with a faculty member and to
look at very complex issues from multiple
angles," Naylor said. She added that they look
for challenging ways to convey ideas to students
in a rigorous academic context.
"Science, Technology and Society" was
bundled together as a Nobel Laureate lecture
series, concentrating on ethical issues in rela
tionship to featured scholars' works. Initiated
by Aly Remtulla, an senior in anthropology, the
one credit class, held last year, gave students
exposure to prominent faculty members'

"South Asian
American
Experience"

research. As an added highlight, 10 of the 40
enrolled students went to dinner after each
weekly session with the guest. Bruce Wong, a
sophomore majoring in philosophy of science,
said "it gave me a chance to meet and see the
Laureates. It's not every quarter that you get to
interact wirK :hem." Wong recalled his excite
ment from other guest speakers such as Paul
Berge from the Biochemistry Department and
Richard Taylor of SLAC, who spoke about his
Nobel Prize for research in quarks and elemen
tary particles.
Another initiative, "South Asian American
Experience" (API 131) was spearheaded by
junior Jane Kim along with Remtulla and a
cadre of key students to fill the curriculum gap
in the cultural humanities. Issues that are often
regarded as too marginal be talked about in
existing classes were the driving focus of their
efforts. Artists, poets, journalists and activists
gave personal insight on a breadth of topics in
their course lectures. Shishir Kurup, a perfor
mance artist from Los Angeles, presented a
piece on South Asian American identity that
added expressive detail to the class in the form
of an unconventional original work. Vibrant
voices spoke on racism, diasporic concerns and
sexuality. Students were able to dig into the
issues presented by the many course readings
such as "Being Muslim and Gay" a subject not
often explored in academia. Kruti Patel, a
senior in economics, who took the class last year
said that unlike lectures, this student-focused
environment lended to more discussion and
personal exploration.
In the same vein, "Asian Pacific Islander
Women" (API 135) emerged from the growing
need to cover material absent in other depart
mental classes. Kim, Remtulla and other stu
dents organized the course. A few of the speak
er panels and discussion groups focused on
queer theory and mixed racial descent among
Asian-Pacific Islander women. Through the

"Corporate
Responsibility In the
Local And Global
Environment"
course, students considered provocative topics such as a comparative
examination of the South-Asian and African-American youth culture in
New York City. A workshop directed to examine domestic violence even
tually sprung from the class.
Although Remtulla has successfully collaborated with other students
to fill the tall order of student lead classes, it has been a hard road. On top
of compiling stacks of appropriate reading and calling individuals to pen
cil in their appointment books for lectures, students must locate the
resources to get things rolling. Faculty sponsors and departmental
approvals are a big step, but other concerns loom as well. "Money and
logistics are the main issues. It's hard to do it yourself," Remtulla said.
As part of a student-powered project, a course on Haitian Studies is
currently being offered. Monisha Bajaj, co-term in sociology and Latin
American studies, teaches this class with the sponsorship of the head of the
Latin American Studies Department, Prof. Kathleen Morrison. In addi
tion to a five-week summer delegation program, the class is part of a larg
er organization, Tet Ananm, whose goal is increased solidarity between
Bay Area students and grassroots groups in Haiti.
Whether from professors or community activists, "Introduction to
Haitian History, Culture and Socio-Politics" brings in a full spectrum of
speakers to promote awareness about Haiti and grassroots activism. The
topics explored in the course range from Haitian slave revolution to
voudou to street children. Art, urbanization, relations between Haiti and
the Dominican Republic and the Haitian Diaspora round out the remain
der of the curriculum. Despite the class enrollment limit of 45, the class
room is always crammed with auditing students awaiting another riveting
lecture.
Student-directed curriculum happens. The materials presented are
often neglected by the canon of academia and can prove exponentially
rewarding given their minimal time requirements. More often than not,
those involved in the classes have not only intellectual interests, but deeply
personal ones, thus providing a distinctly human scope that can rarely be
captured in a 50-minute lecture. In the spirit of SWOPSI of the 1970s
and the Innovative Academic Courses of the 1980s, peer-directed educa
tion continues to be a valuable and incomparable mode of education that
fosters both intellectual fraternity and love of learning.

another student, Olivia Wang, under the spon

Johnson said. During that quarter, eight sets
of speakers were brought in, including girls in
their late teens and early 20s who shared their
experiences about the hardships of not having
adequate shelter.
In addition to classroom participation, stu
dents were required to complete outside course
work that expanded their understanding of
this human plight through similar engaged
and direct learning experiences. One assign
ment involved going to a homeless shelter for
a meal, talking to others there, learning what it

was like to have their food given to them in
such an environment. As part of the class, stu
dents also participated in a "suburban wade"
and an "urban plunge," to further their com
passion as well as street smarts. Ihe "suburban
wade" required students to follow around
homeless individuals for a day. Johnson stated
that this project enabled students to get a clos
er glimpse of "how they {the homeless] filled
their time and see what they did all day."
At the end of the quarter, students ven
tured on the "urban plunge." With a blanket
in hand, 50 cents, and a choice of three
cities —San Francisco, Berkeley or Santa
Cruz —they camped out for three days.
Chaddus Bruce, a sophomore who took the
course, described his urban plunge as a lesson
in humanity. "We went around with a street
kid. He showed us the ins and outs of getting
by in a world where most doors are closed to
you, and people aren't rooting for you," Bruce
said. Bruce came away with a deeper sensitivi
ty to the social conditions that give rise to
homelessness. "People fall through the cracks.
This class really pounded that into you." (I he
course will be offered again this spring quar
ter.)
"Generally, we started to question why is
some knowledge included and floated through
the University and some excluded," argued
Kelly Naylor, a senior whose strong commit
ment to whistle-blowing activism caused her to
push for a class with a different agenda. With
her faculty coordinator, Armin Rosencranz,
Naylor teamed up with a Stanford Board of
Trustees committee on investment responsibil
ity to creatc a course that takes a closer look at
the role of corporations on a world-wide level.
"Faces of
Homelessness"

Business classes have typically championed the
corporate model, cheerleading without chal
lenging the exploitative edge of multinational
corporations. Thus in order to fill the ostensi
ble need for the other side, "Corporate
Responsibility In the Local And Global
Environment" (Hum Bio 143) was born last
winter quarter.
Designed to help students start thinking
about corporate involvement from a critical
paradigm, the intensive four credit class
brought in a variety of experts for weekly two
hour panel discussions about issues, including
the effect of corporations in South Africa and
Burma, international labor conditions and the
dangers of hazardous wastes. At one of the

classes the former minister of the Environment
for Brazil, Jose Goldemberg, spoke about cor
porate involvement in the rainforest. Lengthy
discussion sessions followed the panels to stim
ulate further discourse on the topics opened up.
Required texts for the class, "When
Corporations Rule the World" by David
Korten, and a hefty blue class reader gave stu
dents the arsenal to blow the facade off of cor
porate image, while adding more depth to the
case studies discussed.
"For the students who are promoting the
classes I think it gives them an amazing oppor
tunity to work with a faculty member and to
look at very complex issues from multiple
angles," Naylor said. She added that they look
for challenging ways to convey ideas to students
in a rigorous academic context.
"Science, Technology and Society" was
bundled together as a Nobel Laureate lecture
series, concentrating on ethical issues in rela
tionship to featured scholars' works. Initiated
by Aly Remtulla, an senior in anthropology, the
one credit class, held last year, gave students
exposure to prominent faculty members'

"South Asian
American
Experience"

research. As an added highlight, 10 of the 40
enrolled students went to dinner after each
weekly session with the guest. Bruce Wong, a
sophomore majoring in philosophy of science,
said "it gave me a chance to meet and see the
Laureates. It's not every quarter that you get to
interact wirK :hem." Wong recalled his excite
ment from other guest speakers such as Paul
Berge from the Biochemistry Department and
Richard Taylor of SLAC, who spoke about his
Nobel Prize for research in quarks and elemen
tary particles.
Another initiative, "South Asian American
Experience" (API 131) was spearheaded by
junior Jane Kim along with Remtulla and a
cadre of key students to fill the curriculum gap
in the cultural humanities. Issues that are often
regarded as too marginal be talked about in
existing classes were the driving focus of their
efforts. Artists, poets, journalists and activists
gave personal insight on a breadth of topics in
their course lectures. Shishir Kurup, a perfor
mance artist from Los Angeles, presented a
piece on South Asian American identity that
added expressive detail to the class in the form
of an unconventional original work. Vibrant
voices spoke on racism, diasporic concerns and
sexuality. Students were able to dig into the
issues presented by the many course readings
such as "Being Muslim and Gay" a subject not
often explored in academia. Kruti Patel, a
senior in economics, who took the class last year
said that unlike lectures, this student-focused
environment lended to more discussion and
personal exploration.
In the same vein, "Asian Pacific Islander
Women" (API 135) emerged from the growing
need to cover material absent in other depart
mental classes. Kim, Remtulla and other stu
dents organized the course. A few of the speak
er panels and discussion groups focused on
queer theory and mixed racial descent among
Asian-Pacific Islander women. Through the

"Corporate
Responsibility In the
Local And Global
Environment"
course, students considered provocative topics such as a comparative
examination of the South-Asian and African-American youth culture in
New York City. A workshop directed to examine domestic violence even
tually sprung from the class.
Although Remtulla has successfully collaborated with other students
to fill the tall order of student lead classes, it has been a hard road. On top
of compiling stacks of appropriate reading and calling individuals to pen
cil in their appointment books for lectures, students must locate the
resources to get things rolling. Faculty sponsors and departmental
approvals are a big step, but other concerns loom as well. "Money and
logistics are the main issues. It's hard to do it yourself," Remtulla said.
As part of a student-powered project, a course on Haitian Studies is
currently being offered. Monisha Bajaj, co-term in sociology and Latin
American studies, teaches this class with the sponsorship of the head of the
Latin American Studies Department, Prof. Kathleen Morrison. In addi
tion to a five-week summer delegation program, the class is part of a larg
er organization, Tet Ananm, whose goal is increased solidarity between
Bay Area students and grassroots groups in Haiti.
Whether from professors or community activists, "Introduction to
Haitian History, Culture and Socio-Politics" brings in a full spectrum of
speakers to promote awareness about Haiti and grassroots activism. The
topics explored in the course range from Haitian slave revolution to
voudou to street children. Art, urbanization, relations between Haiti and
the Dominican Republic and the Haitian Diaspora round out the remain
der of the curriculum. Despite the class enrollment limit of 45, the class
room is always crammed with auditing students awaiting another riveting
lecture.
Student-directed curriculum happens. The materials presented are
often neglected by the canon of academia and can prove exponentially
rewarding given their minimal time requirements. More often than not,
those involved in the classes have not only intellectual interests, but deeply
personal ones, thus providing a distinctly human scope that can rarely be
captured in a 50-minute lecture. In the spirit of SWOPSI of the 1970s
and the Innovative Academic Courses of the 1980s, peer-directed educa
tion continues to be a valuable and incomparable mode of education that
fosters both intellectual fraternity and love of learning.

Nearly 30 years ago, Stanford was a
political hotbed. The environment
encouraged students to take an active
part in launching their own courses and to act
as incubators for ideas. At its peak, the
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues) program engendered one
third of classes on campus, said Laura Selznick,
current director of Undergraduate Research
Opportunities. Due to fizzled funding and
swarms of heated debates over faculty involve
ment, the program collapsed in the mid 80s,
leaving a legacy of muted manifestos and rem
nants of action-oriented philosophies for
teaching. Many departments have since
streamlined a slew of first generation student
directed courses: "Sleep and Dreams,"
"Human Sexuality," "Slavic Bibliography,"
"The Meaning of Being Disabled,"
"Entrepeneurship," and the jazz curriculum in
the Music Department.
Despite the demise of the SWOPSI pro
gram, a handful of fervent students have
spawned a new breed of innovative courses
embodying the same activist spirit as their pre
decessors. Based on diverse lecture series, con
temporary community-centered curriculum
and a grocery list of points that could turn a
staid academe on its head, student-led courses
provide distinct learning opportunities.
Because there are many logistical hurdles that
tend to discourage the inception of fresh, stu
dent-driven classes, only about 5 to 10 are cur
rently on the annual course list. Yet, their
immense popularity often is marked by com
petition for seats in their limited enrollment.
