# Student Education YOU
## Student-Led Classes of Today 
### Elizabeth Brooks 
Nearly 30 years ago, Stanford was a
political hotbed. The environment
encouraged students to take an active
part in launching their own courses and to act
as incubators for ideas. At its peak, the
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues) program engendered one
third of classes on campus, said Laura Selznick,
current director of Undergraduate Research
Opportunities. Due to fizzled funding and
swarms of heated debates over faculty involve
ment, the program collapsed in the mid 80s,
leaving a legacy of muted manifestos and rem
nants of action-oriented philosophies for
teaching. Many departments have since
streamlined a slew of first generation student
directed courses: "Sleep and Dreams,"
"Human Sexuality," "Slavic Bibliography,"
"The Meaning of Being Disabled,"
"Entrepeneurship," and the jazz curriculum in
the Music Department.
Despite the demise of the SWOPSI pro
gram, a handful of fervent students have
spawned a new breed of innovative courses
embodying the same activist spirit as their pre
decessors. Based on diverse lecture series, con
temporary community-centered curriculum
and a grocery list of points that could turn a
staid academe on its head, student-led courses
provide distinct learning opportunities.
Because there are many logistical hurdles that
tend to discourage the inception of fresh, stu
dent-driven classes, only about 5 to 10 are cur
rently on the annual course list. Yet, their
immense popularity often is marked by com
petition for seats in their limited enrollment.
Offered for the first time last spring, "Faces
of Homelessness," illustrates how creative

ingredients and unconventional approaches to
teaching can stretch the boundaries of the edu
cational experience. Bjorn Johnson, a senior in
the History Department, collaborated with
another student, Olivia Wang, under the spon
sorship of her then Resident Fellow, Ross
Shacter, to develop the course. Via these stu
dents' work, an empathogenic forum evolved
in the classroom where homeless individuals
received the opportunity to relate hard-hitting
stories about living on the streets. "I tried to
teach the class through the words of the home
less and the people that work with them,"

Johnson said. During that quarter, eight sets
of speakers were brought in, including girls in
their late teens and early 20s who shared their
experiences about the hardships of not having
adequate shelter.
In addition to classroom participation, stu
dents were required to complete outside course
work that expanded their understanding of
this human plight through similar engaged
and direct learning experiences. One assign
ment involved going to a homeless shelter for
a meal, talking to others there, learning what it

was like to have their food given to them in
such an environment. As part of the class, stu
dents also participated in a "suburban wade"
and an "urban plunge," to further their com
passion as well as street smarts. Ihe "suburban
wade" required students to follow around
homeless individuals for a day. Johnson stated
that this project enabled students to get a clos
er glimpse of "how they {the homeless] filled
their time and see what they did all day."
At the end of the quarter, students ven
tured on the "urban plunge." With a blanket
in hand, 50 cents, and a choice of three
cities —San Francisco, Berkeley or Santa
Cruz —they camped out for three days.
Chaddus Bruce, a sophomore who took the
course, described his urban plunge as a lesson
in humanity. "We went around with a street
kid. He showed us the ins and outs of getting
by in a world where most doors are closed to
you, and people aren't rooting for you," Bruce
said. Bruce came away with a deeper sensitivi
ty to the social conditions that give rise to
homelessness. "People fall through the cracks.
This class really pounded that into you." (I he
course will be offered again this spring quar
ter.)
"Generally, we started to question why is
some knowledge included and floated through
the University and some excluded," argued
Kelly Naylor, a senior whose strong commit
ment to whistle-blowing activism caused her to
push for a class with a different agenda. With
her faculty coordinator, Armin Rosencranz,
Naylor teamed up with a Stanford Board of
Trustees committee on investment responsibil
ity to creatc a course that takes a closer look at
the role of corporations on a world-wide level.
