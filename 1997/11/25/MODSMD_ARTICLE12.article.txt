# What is Told
## 
### 
No. It begins in the last beat,
in the last quick breath.
It begins just before surrender,
and ends just after.
It is not to be told.
Only, you will tell,
and running to tell, you will think
how much else to tell with it:
you had watched all along,
and this is how it felt to watch.
How it reminded you
of being taken by surprise,
only it wasn't a surprise.
How it had hurt,
and how you had hoped it would hurt.
Running to tell, you will glow with it.
The radio in traffic. The beautiful collapse
of time upon itself, each moment
a light to skid through, spinning.
It is yours until you tell it.
No. It is yours
until you decide to tell it.
