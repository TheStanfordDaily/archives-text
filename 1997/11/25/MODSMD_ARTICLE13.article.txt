# Joy
## 
### 
You wake early to birdsong,
and wonder what the day
means to tell you.
Without looking, you know to think,
Sparrows, and give yourself,
blind tired, to their chatter.
It should be easy
to set one fool down,
and then another. To let light in.
It should be easy to learn from the birds,
who let go each note as though
their bodies were pure forgetting.
Perhaps joy is the opposite of memory,
and their singing is meant to recall to you
nothing, is meant simply to call,
as the air is meant for the birds,
who give in to it briefly
and give themselves in flight.
Who knows if they are at home there.
Who knows if they know any more
what the morning offers for arriving with it
than you do, stiff and jealous of sleep.
They sing to make work pleasure.
You listen without wanting to.
Perhaps joy is the opposite of memory,
and the ghosts that wake with you
wake as a way of saying "Take
what is yours before it is no longer yours,"
as a way of pointing you to the birds,
who may sense you there, and tense and go.
