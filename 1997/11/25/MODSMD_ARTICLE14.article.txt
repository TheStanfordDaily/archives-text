## The Life and Death of American Cities
### 
Stephen Moore examines the proposition that immigrants impose
an economic drag on the cities where they live. The facts, he finds,
suggest otherwise.

MORE than half of all immigrants
in the United States reside in
just seven cities: Los Angeles,
New York, Chicago, Miami,
San Diego, Houston and San Francisco. A
controversial issue is whether immigrants are a
benefit or a burden to these areas. A 1997
National Academy of Sciences study reports
that "immigrants add as much as $10 billion to
the national economy each year," but "in areas
with high concentrations of low-skilled, low
paid immigrants," they impose net costs on
U.S.-born workers. This article questions that
finding.
Examining a range of economic variables
for the eighty-five largest U.S. cities over the
period 1980 to 1994, we find that those cities
with heavy concentrations of immigrants outper
formed cities with few immigrants. Compared
with low-immigrant cities, high-immigrant
cities had double the job creation rate, higher
per capita incomes, lower poverty rates and 20
percent less crime. Unemployment rates, how
ever, were unusually large in high-immigrant
cities. These findings do not answer the critical
questions of whether the immigrants cause the
better urban conditions or whether benign
urban conditions attract the immigrants. But

they do refute the assertion that the economic
decline of central cities is caused by immigra
tion. That assertion cannot be true because,
with few exceptions, the U.S. cities in greatest
despair today - Detroit, Mich., Saint Louis,
Mo., Buffalo, N.Y., Rochester, N.Y., Gary, Ind.
- have virtually no immigrants.
What is the fiscal and economic impact of
immigrants on the cities where they live? This
question goes to the heart of the controversy
over Americas ability to assimilate immigrants
into our economy and social infrastructure
without imposing an undue burden on U.S.

HAVE ALREADY BEEN
TURNED INTO EXTENSIONS

citizens. It is also a critical policy issue in the
current debate over what is the 'right number"
of immigrants to admit to the United States
each year.
The presumption among policymakers is
that immigrants impose heavy fiscal and eco
nomic burdens. For example, Governor
Lawton Chiles of Florida complained that
"federal immigration policy has created a
nightmare for state and local governments."
The nightmare is said to take many forms.
One is an undesirable cultural transformation.
Newsweek recently raised the alarm for
Californians with the headline Los Angeles
2010: A Latino Subcontinent. Within a gener
ation, predicts the article, "California will be
demographically, culturally and economically
distinct from the rest of America." Gordon J.
McDonald, former chief of the U.S. Border
Patrol, is even more blunt in his assessment of
the urban impact of immigrants: "Major cities
have already been turned into extensions of
foreign countries," he warns. "Aliens threaten
to seize political power within a few short
years."
Another problem allegedly created by large
concentrations of immigrants in cities is
unemployment. Brown immigrants are said to
