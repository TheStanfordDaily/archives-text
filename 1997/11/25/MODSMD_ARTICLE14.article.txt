## The 						Life and Death of American Cities 
### 
Stephen Moore examines the proposition that immigrants impose
an economic drag on the cities where they live. The facts, he finds,
suggest otherwise.

MORE than half of all immigrants
in the United States reside in
just seven cities: Los Angeles,
New York, Chicago, Miami,
San Diego, Houston and San Francisco. A
controversial issue is whether immigrants are a
benefit or a burden to these areas. A 1997
National Academy of Sciences study reports
that "immigrants add as much as $10 billion to
the national economy each year," but "in areas
with high concentrations of low-skilled, low
paid immigrants," they impose net costs on
U.S.-born workers. This article questions that
finding.
Examining a range of economic variables
for the eighty-five largest U.S. cities over the
period 1980 to 1994, we find that those cities
with heavy concentrations of immigrants outper
formed cities with few immigrants. Compared
with low-immigrant cities, high-immigrant
cities had double the job creation rate, higher
per capita incomes, lower poverty rates and 20
percent less crime. Unemployment rates, how
ever, were unusually large in high-immigrant
cities. These findings do not answer the critical
questions of whether the immigrants cause the
better urban conditions or whether benign
urban conditions attract the immigrants. But

they do refute the assertion that the economic
decline of central cities is caused by immigra
tion. That assertion cannot be true because,
with few exceptions, the U.S. cities in greatest
despair today - Detroit, Mich., Saint Louis,
Mo., Buffalo, N.Y., Rochester, N.Y., Gary, Ind.
- have virtually no immigrants.
What is the fiscal and economic impact of
immigrants on the cities where they live? This
question goes to the heart of the controversy
over Americas ability to assimilate immigrants
into our economy and social infrastructure
without imposing an undue burden on U.S.

citizens. It is also a critical policy issue in the
current debate over what is the 'right number"
of immigrants to admit to the United States
each year.
The presumption among policymakers is
that immigrants impose heavy fiscal and eco
nomic burdens. For example, Governor
Lawton Chiles of Florida complained that
"federal immigration policy has created a
nightmare for state and local governments."
The nightmare is said to take many forms.
One is an undesirable cultural transformation.
Newsweek recently raised the alarm for
Californians with the headline Los Angeles
2010: A Latino Subcontinent. Within a gener
ation, predicts the article, "California will be
demographically, culturally and economically
distinct from the rest of America." Gordon J.
McDonald, former chief of the U.S. Border
Patrol, is even more blunt in his assessment of
the urban impact of immigrants: "Major cities
have already been turned into extensions of
foreign countries," he warns. "Aliens threaten
to seize political power within a few short
years."
Another problem allegedly created by large
concentrations of immigrants in cities is
unemployment. Brown immigrants are said to
be pushing black Americans out of the job
market. Still another impact of competition
from immigrants in inner cities is white flight.
"In the last half of the 1980s, for every 10
immigrants who arrived [in New York,
Chicago, Los Angeles, and Houston], nine res
idents left for elsewhere," claims a story in the
New York Times Magazine. Immigration may
be leading to the balkanization of America's

once-mighty industrial cities.
What is beyond debate is that immigrants
have a profound demographic, economic and
fiscal impact on America's largest central cities.
The majority of all immigrants reside in just
seven cities. Most of the rest of the nation is
negligibly affected by immigrat Â»i.
There is also little question that many of
Americas largest cities-Detroit, Saint Louis,
Buffalo, Newark, New York, Philadelphia, for
example-have been suffering from a severe
economic erosion during the past quarter cen
tury. The signs of urban sclerosis are evident
in statistics on rising crime rates, increasing
poverty levels, and losses of jobs, businesses,
and the white middle class (though in the cur-

rent economic recovery, the lot of central cities
has improved). Yet not all Americas central
cities are deteriorating. In fact, many, such as
Charlotte, Las Vegas, San Jose, San Diego,
Austin, and Seattle, for example, are booming.
Other cities, such as Dallas and Pittsburgh, are
enjoying an economic renaissance that seemed
improbable ten or fifteen years ago.
The critical policy issue is whether immi
grants contribute to economic decline in cen
tral cities. Recently I conducted a systematic
assessment of the impact of immigration on
cities. I contrasted the economic condition of
high-immigration cities with that of low
immigration cities over the period 1980 to
1990 (or 1980 to 1994, when those data are
available). I examined all eighty-five of the
most populous (200,000 or more) U.S. cities.
On eight of the nine fiscal and economic
variables I examined, high-immigration cities
perform better, not worse, than low-immigra
tion cities. The higher a city's percentage of
foreign-born population, the higher its subse
quent population growth, the higher its subse
quent growth in employment, the higher its
per capita income, the faster its increase in per
capita income, the lower its poverty rate, the
lower its subsequent increase in poverty, the
lower its crime rate, and the lower its tax bur
den. The only economic variable on which
high-immigration cities fared worse than low
immigration cities was the unemployment
rate, which was higher in high-immigration
cities than in low-immigration cities. The evi
dence suggests that there is some native work
er dislocation in cities with high concentra
tions of immigrants.
The median foreign-born population of

the 10 most prosperous cities in the 1980s was
9.0 percent (see the accompanying chart). Yet
in the ten fastest-declining cities, the median
foreign-born population in 1990 was just 3.8
percent. In fact, of the twelve fastest-declining
large cities in the United States in the 1980s,
only two, Miami and Houston, had higher
than-average immigration. And Houston's
decline was clearly a result of the oil bust, not

high immigration.
These findings do not prove that immi
grants cause prosperity in states and cities. But
they challenge the opposite charge-that immi
grants cause economic decline.
Nearly 200 years ago James Madison
observed: "That part of America that has
encouraged [foreigners] has advanced most
rapidly in population, agriculture, and in the
arts." This appears to have been precisely the
case in the 1980s.
