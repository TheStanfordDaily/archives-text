Educational breadth has always been touted as a hallmark of a
sturdy education. A valuable education requires not only intel
lectual rigor, but realistic rigor as well. This issue of Arcade
homes in on both past and present sources of education which seek
to expand the scope of an academic curriculum by inviting the stu
dent to become the primary drive behind learning. The assumption
that Stanford's quality education lies on the shoulders of the lecturer
and professor to "inspire" and "motivate" the student to never before
seen intellectual ecstasty. And every time that assumption is made it
is made wrongly.
Darlene Damm's article on the now defunct SWOPSI or
Stanford Workshops on Political and Social Issues springs not only

from her own sense of the student-body's ever increasing apathy to Stanford itself, but also
from a sense of an ever increasing apathy to the world at large and to being an active insti
gator in their own education. Darlene looks back in history in order to gauge what must
come, and in doing so makes a reminder to us to not forget our own potential for teaching
others in a classroom setting. Elizabeth Brooks fleshes out today's scene of student-led class
es and examines the classes which have inherited the spirit of SWOPSI in the 1970s and
Stanford's Innovative Academic Courses of the 1980s.
In terms of the learning that is done in the classroom, Sayra Khandekar's scrutiny of
standardized testing and its value as an evaluative tool for knowledge and intelligence cuts
into the sensitive issues of affirmative action institutionalized bias. Bias is also addressed in
Stephen Moore's analysis of american cities and the correlation of economic health and
immigrant population, Desite the weight of quantitative evidence, what Moore reveals will
continue to be debated for years to come.
Bob Gregg's informal musing about what matters to him and why promises to stimulate
any hopeful undergraduate into their own musings. Topics ranging from his life-time hook
up to blinking chickens on their way to the slaughter to the flight of a golf ball, are all
courtesy of the on campus series "What Matters to Me and Why..." which continues
throughout the year.
The fine arts are represented with their full colors as the Stanford Museum gears up for
the opening of the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for the Visual Arts, set to debut in
1999. Undergraduates fortunate enough to benefit from this incredibly rich resource can
have a small glimpse at what awaits them in the center spread, and should get involved
early by contacting the museum's offices before the inevitable waiting list.
Arcade is also proud to continue presenting the finest of Stanford's creative writing com
munity with this issue's selections of Tracy Smith, a Stegner Fellow of Poetry. In publishing
with Arcade, Ms. Chapman joins other poets such as Havan Boland, Kenneth Fields and
Simone Di Piero.

Another full quarter has brought
another full issue, and with the help of
readers like you who have come to real
ize that writing can be a method to
exploration, I hope there is something
within for you to enjoy.
