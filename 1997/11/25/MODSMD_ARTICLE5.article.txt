## STANDARDIZE TANDARDIZED ESTING TO BE > A TEST 
### Sayra Khandekar 
The idea seems like a good one. On a pre-arranged day,
students of all different educational backgrounds sit in
classrooms all over the country and take a test. The
test begins and ends at regulated times. Everyone uses the same
instruments, and the same restrictions are imposed on every
student. Everyone has the same number of sections, the same
time for breaks, and the same requirements for identification.
Test proctors read from a script. This is equality at work.
Standardized testing was begun in an effort to open more
opportunities to minority students applying to colleges and
graduate schools. Tests such as the PS AT, SAT, LSAT, MCAT,
ACT, ERB, GRE, and any other permutation of the alphabet,

are seen by students as their chance to
measure up in order to get into college
or graduate school. A poor score on
one of these tests has come to mean a
closed door, a missed opportunity.
Comparisons of colleges and universi
ties often list the ranges of test scores of
their current students. The National
Merit Scholarship Program uses for eli
gibility a high school junior's PSAT
score. Of course, when questioned,
institutions of learning always insist
that standardized tests such as the SA T
and ACT do not carry the weight typ-

ically placed on them. Indeed it is a terrifying thought that
admission may be granted to students based on one test given
on one day in their entire academic career. Qualification for
admission is not the job of the standardized test; to use it for
that purpose is arbitrary and unfair.
The value of standardized testing lies in the results. Ideally,
the test is an indicator to the student and the educator about
what has been learned and where the student's deficiencies lie.
In reality, more people beyond the student and educator use
the test score; this is how standardized tests have become mis-

used. For parents, admissions boards, and school officials,
standardized test scores provide a quick gauge of where stu
dents fall according to state and national standards. This is the
age of instant results: I want to see results, and I want to see
them now.
People no longer have the time to research methods of edu
cation; they want numbers and percentiles they can evaluate
quickly. Currently, there is presidential support for national
ized testing and the development of a national standard of edu
cation for each grade level. Plans would call for more federal
involvement in states' education programs through a national
standardized test and national educational standards. President

Clinton's intention is "to have some
sort of clearly accepted standard of
excellence that all our children
would be expected to meet in read
ing and math."
While this type of standard
would be quite valuable statistically,
the ramifications of increased
reliance on standardized testing
adversely affect the learning process
forecasting a future where educators
plan their lessons around national
standards, and the nation-wide goal
of education is to perform well on

the test. In this future, the value of learning would be reduced
to the value of a test score.
And this does not even begin to address the issue of "the
test itself. Administering a national test to every school is a
nice idea, if and only if all the test is able to approach all stu
dents from all states, from all counties, from all cities, from
every school, from every classroom, in a fair manner. The prob
lem is that tests seek to evaluate knowledge, and more often
nowadays in higher education, the ability to succeed.
Yet testing conditions and the tests themselves ignore one
