## STANDARDIZE TANDARDIZED ESTING TO BE > A TEST 
### Sayra Khandekar 
The idea seems like a good one. On a pre-arranged day,
students of all different educational backgrounds sit in
classrooms all over the country and take a test. The
test begins and ends at regulated times. Everyone uses the same
instruments, and the same restrictions are imposed on every
student. Everyone has the same number of sections, the same
time for breaks, and the same requirements for identification.
Test proctors read from a script. This is equality at work.
Standardized testing was begun in an effort to open more
opportunities to minority students applying to colleges and
graduate schools. Tests such as the PS AT, SAT, LSAT, MCAT,
ACT, ERB, GRE, and any other permutation of the alphabet,

are seen by students as their chance to
measure up in order to get into college
or graduate school. A poor score on
one of these tests has come to mean a
closed door, a missed opportunity.
Comparisons of colleges and universi
ties often list the ranges of test scores of
their current students. The National
Merit Scholarship Program uses for eli
gibility a high school junior's PSAT
score. Of course, when questioned,
institutions of learning always insist
that standardized tests such as the SA T
and ACT do not carry the weight typ-

ically placed on them. Indeed it is a terrifying thought that
admission may be granted to students based on one test given
on one day in their entire academic career. Qualification for
admission is not the job of the standardized test; to use it for
that purpose is arbitrary and unfair.
The value of standardized testing lies in the results. Ideally,
the test is an indicator to the student and the educator about
what has been learned and where the student's deficiencies lie.
In reality, more people beyond the student and educator use
the test score; this is how standardized tests have become mis-

used. For parents, admissions boards, and school officials,
standardized test scores provide a quick gauge of where stu
dents fall according to state and national standards. This is the
age of instant results: I want to see results, and I want to see
them now.
People no longer have the time to research methods of edu
cation; they want numbers and percentiles they can evaluate
quickly. Currently, there is presidential support for national
ized testing and the development of a national standard of edu
cation for each grade level. Plans would call for more federal
involvement in states' education programs through a national
standardized test and national educational standards. President

Clinton's intention is "to have some
sort of clearly accepted standard of
excellence that all our children
would be expected to meet in read
ing and math."
While this type of standard
would be quite valuable statistically,
the ramifications of increased
reliance on standardized testing
adversely affect the learning process
forecasting a future where educators
plan their lessons around national
standards, and the nation-wide goal
of education is to perform well on

the test. In this future, the value of learning would be reduced
to the value of a test score.
And this does not even begin to address the issue of "the
test itself. Administering a national test to every school is a
nice idea, if and only if all the test is able to approach all stu
dents from all states, from all counties, from all cities, from
every school, from every classroom, in a fair manner. The prob
lem is that tests seek to evaluate knowledge, and more often
nowadays in higher education, the ability to succeed.
Yet testing conditions and the tests themselves ignore one
very important principle of the human race:
not all people function best while expressing
their intelligence and mental abilities to a piece
of paper. Not all people react the same way to
the same question, and not all people can
function under the impersonal conditions of a
standardized test. The issues of time and test
anxiety are huge components behind the pres
sures of taking a standardized test. Some may
argue that "test-taking ability" measured by
tests such as the SAT is valuable in evaluating
students and their ability to "think under pres
sure," yet how really necessary is this skill in
the majority of life's situations in the work
place and in functioning in society? It is in the
nature of some people to simply cease func
tioning in situations where they feel stress or
anxiety; what is the value in subjecting them to
the same level of pressure as everyone else, if
they will not be able to perform according to
their own abilities? Such a narrow sensitivity of
the "test" does not allow everyone to perform
to the best of their abilities and thus is not a
fair gauge and not a proper measure for an
educational standards. .
The fundamental issue of equity comes
into play when certain sections of standardized
tests subtly require a certain level of cultural
literacy of familiarity. Developers of the SAT
have been criticized in the past for verbal pas
sages that exclude members of minority
groups. In their defense, it is a challenge to
develop a test that is fair to all ethnic groups,
to students of all learning styles and to all lev
els of cultural background. The Mexican
American Legal Defense and Education Fund
(MALDEF) recently brought a class-action
suit against the Texas Education Agency and
the State Board of Education for the use of a
discriminatory high school exit exam. The
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS),
according to MALDEF, is biased against
Hispanics and African Americans and hinders
those groups from doing well, and thus gradu
ating. Almost 7,500 Texas students fail the
TAAS every year; many of these high school
seniors had successfully completed all other
requirements for graduation and graduated
with above average GPAs.
Over time, standardized tests have been
restructured, scores have been recentered, and
free response sections have become more pop
ular, all in an effort to reach that balance
between a personal and a general standard of
testing. The ideal, according to Robert
Professor Calfee of the Stanford School of
Education, is to develop a method of testing
that optimizes the opportunity to perform.
Under the right conditions with a "clean test"
free of obstacles, all students should be able to

perform to their best abilities and thus project
a more accurate picture of their abilities. This
picture, however, is not a complete one; "You
may not make any decision based on a single
indicator," says Calfee.
What are the abilities being measured in a
standardized test? The way the tests are cur
rently, they do not, as intended, measure com
munication skills, motivation, critical think
ing, or problem solving skills. How can they
determine these "higher order thinking skills"
based on three or four questions about a verbal
reasoning passage? The skill really being deter
mined is "how well they do on a specific task,"
says Becky Crowe, a member of Professor
Calfee's team which is working to reform
schools in the Bay Area. There are no practical
applications. What should these tests be mea
suring? If students have similar preparation
and are on an even level of comfort, they
should know that the test is measuring their
"persistence and ability to function," explains
Professor Calfee.
The ideal test must be constructed in such
a way that all students have an equal theoreti
cal base from which to approach it. In the cur
rent construction of many standardized tests,

instructions and time limits place unnecessary
obstacles in front of the actual goal of measur
ing a students problem-solving ability and
mental rigor. Making changes to minimize
these factors would make the scores and what
they measure more accurate and fair, but the
debate about the general usefulness of the stan
dardized test still remains. The purpose of
standardized tests can be to provide an indica
tor of a school system's overall effectiveness, or
it can be a quick indicator of where a particu
lar student fits within a distribution of other
students. Yet there are many dangers intrinsic
to using test scores for this latter purpose.
Often the key factor is the issue of pre
paredness. If all students came into a test with
the same preparedness, perhaps standardized
test scores could be taken more seriously.
Preparedness here, however, does not mean
necessarily correlate to educational level, nor
on the personal drive of the student, but often
stems from the students comfort level with the
test itself. How familiar is every student with
the format of the test? How comfortable is the
student with the styles and types of questions?
How clear are the instructions to everyone?
Much of test anxiety is unnecessary and due to
unfamiliarity. Many students drill for weeks
on sample questions, attend review courses,
and many even hire private coaches in prepa
ration for the SAT and ACT. Needless to say,
not everyone has those resources available to
them. The students who attend the Kaplan
courses and prepare using the Princeton
Review will obviously have an unfair advan
tage over other students. As has been shown in
a number of studies, often SAT scores are
merely an index of a student's family's income.
Despite the oft-heard claim that standard
ized test scores are the single best predictor of
academic success, the overwhelming majority
of the relevant studies shows this to be patent
ly untrue. On the contrary, these studies show
that high school grade-point averages, not
standardized test scores, are the single best pre
dictor. To say the least, the addition of SAT
and ACT test scores adds absolutely nothing in
terms of predictability to high school CPAs,
and in some cases it worsens predictability; on
this point, virtually all of the experts agree.
The U.S. Department of Education's Office of
Civil Rights is now investigating complaints
that the UC requirement that students submit
standardized test scores disproportionately
excludes blacks and Latinos who, on average,
post lower scores than whites and Asians.
Colleges and universities across the coun-
try have recently been deciding to not count standardized test scores.
Bates College in Maine does not require applicants to report standard
ized test scores. Texas students in the top 10 percent of their high school
classes are guaranteed admission to their state universities with or with
out having taken a standardized test. The University of California
schools are now considering removing test scores from their admission
requirements. If the reputable UC system does adopt this plan, its
influence would ripple throughout admissions requirements across the
country. The downside to this policy would be difficulty in compar
ing students rapidly in some type of quantitative manner, regardless of
their school systems.
In any permutation of argument, there is no simple way to gauge a
student s intellectual ability through tests. The process of education is
not a simple issue and deserves more study than a computer-generated
score report.
