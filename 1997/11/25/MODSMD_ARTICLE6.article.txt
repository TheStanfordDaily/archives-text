# What Matters to Me and Why Riffs:
## 
### Bob Gregg 
I came up with six things that matter to me that I have some clue
about why—but realized you need seven... so now I have seven.

IMARY LAYNE GREGG. LOVer,
Companion, Soulmate. She is the Who in what matters to
me. There are others closely connected to her and to me.
But she is where I would start. The Why is very simple: she is an
irresistible human being. In my life with this woman I've
been challenged again and again with this question: "how do you
love and how do you allow yourself to be loved —fully, as fully as
the good fortune of our meeting and 'hooking up'
seem to compel?" There are some tough moments in any serious
relationship. Mary Layne brought from her history this arresting and
attention-getting phrase:
"There's a dead bird between us!"
When this is heard, it is time to deal. We negotiate a lot about the
character of our love and the character of our relationship.
Does professional life work against our 36-year
opportunity of learning how to love? There is ambiguity here. The
sheer weight of somebody's work can get in the way. But I think
honesty dictates acknowledging that there is sometimes an instinct to
take shelter in your work!—in order to walk
around some of the challenges that are involved in a deep relation
ship. So it's a question on a given day of deciding whether to go do
your work, or to go deal with one of those dead-bird moments, or to
discover one of those moments when you might try to honor more
fully the other person. The question, with its several possibilities,
surfaces regularly. I've not it to this day ...

how can people find their ways to the best available, the
fullest feasible living? I'm caught up in that with myself and
I'm caught up in that with almost all my dealings with individuals
and groups of people.
If you talk about human flourishing you must talk about an impor
tant problematic: fairness and justice. Forme
these are a coupiet-flourishing and fairness.
What matters to me is human well-being and the problem of its
obstacles.. . real obstacles that are results of deeply institutionalized
bias and prejudice... and also self-constructed obstacles.
Sometimes ounces get in the way of our prospects for our own
and I call those equally real.
Why is this couplet, flourishing and justice, a matter of impor
tance to me? Because I know that life can be experienced as rich
and I also know that there are fetters...enslavements that need to
be removed...demons that must be defeated.
O tLAYEUSo ™ s is iar ® e f ° r me and s °
I can only hint at it. I am attracted to...fascinated by the arti
choke character of reality. The COMPLEXITIES OF PEOPLE.
The complexities ot literary texts that draw my attention. The com
plexity of systems of meaning, results of human yearning. I am
interested in the layers one finds in sacred stories. In my case the
inherited and appropriated sacred story is the true myth I care most
about. I seem to think about this story less in terms of propositional
axioms, less in terms ot extractable principles, these days. Rather, I
think about the density of the narrative, and it's a
£lv®. Its the narrative about captivity and release into a journey

that's under way and not yet finished. So for me, playing the
moments of my life against the larger moving picture that has at its
center the Exodus story and the Jesus saga —that kind of double story
of captivity, liberation, and being on the road, is very fundamental to
me.
But what 1 find myself doing is continually trying to tease out the lay
• .. _ •
ers of this story that I imagine we live in,
along with my personal history, and the stories of people I talk to.
I think I should say, because some of you might expect me to utter
something about God—that my way of imagining Godness is com
pletely within this notion of layers. "What dimensions and layers
are there in how we might imagine the forces of good or God?" 1
wonder, and it's striking to me that I am not attracted to
images of a transcendence,
purification, rarification, and simplicity. But I am attracted to
DENSITIES, overlapping possibilities of meaning, surprises,
pregnant ambiguities .so that my own religious
and spiritual tendencies are much more geological and archaeological
than astronomical and stratospheric. I don't quite know why this is or
where it's going. I just know that that's my center of gravity.
And why does all this matter to me? Layers and artichokes are
DE RERUM NATURA
This is the way things are, I'm convinced.
Humor of two kinds. I cannot
imagine making my way through an hour without a fairly
sharp sense of ironic humor. This is the kind of humor that
lets you know that we are all the naked emperor or empress. Seeing
the foibles, seeing the ridiculous in our «;rand plans and schemes 1 think
that connected to this is some using of humor to come to terms with
something I don't consider a bad thing—which is the incompleteness
and imperfection of all of us that might allow us to get over some of
performance pressures. We might
occasionally entertain the question, "even being the incomplete per
son I am, is it possible to be accepted anyway and to accept my life
and i, s IMPERFECTIONS?"
The second type of humor is equally important, though a little rarer,
because I think you can generate the first —your own ironic "take"
on the world. I'm speaking of the brand of funniness that simply
erupts in the middle of your experience, causing you to lose control
of your very controlled self and simply have a kind of rollicking
laughter that can reduce you to tears .. .and for at least that time in
which you are really genuinely laughing, makes you care-free.
Why humor? I find that humor gives you perspective, especially
perspective on human pretension..
But I also think the kind of surprising funniness that blows you
away when you least expect it keeps you loose. In my experience
everywhere, but especially here, being kept loose is a high priority.

5 The social, or communal over the individual. I discover
that I myself "privilege" or value the social, communal, rela
tional, institutional over the personal, the interior, the individ
ual, the private. The "systems" in which I've lived, with enthusiasm,
highlight as priorities social connection, causes, communities of peo
ple who need allies, partners. So for me, certain kinds of words and
phrases that capture crucial dynamics regularly come out: account
ability, faithfulness to an agreement to be with others, loyalty, loyal
ty to others, LOYALTY TO THE OTHER. Most of my time spent
both in acting and in reflection upon what matters to me, has this
clearly social and "outward" cast to it. As a result, it could be that I
am somewhat impoverished and unimaginative in my inner self, but
I don't seem to care much about that.
It's just a reality, a chosen "given."
And the Why? I think that to be answerable is a good thing. The
privilege and the promise of knowing others and being known, shar
ing some victories, sharing some losses, is a good thing. I value this.
For me, to be with is very fundamental to my sense of what it means
to be...to be with other people making their ways, as you are
...to be in relationship.
6 AESTHETICS • I have deep affection for
faces and voices. 1 really care about Greek, Roman, early
Christian and Byzantine Art. 1 spend a lot of time enjoying
it.i like wide panoramic cosmologies.
philosophical systems or ornate stories that look as if they might
have an elegant coherence in themselves. 1 like them. I like the
FLIGHT OF A GOLF BALL-1 like .he jour
ney of a golf ball in the air. I like to see it hit the ground. It does
matter to me what part of the ground it hits. I take pleasure in
watching a golf ball roll and settle. So I don't play golf in the way
many other people play. I cherish particular beautiful moments, and
I stand there and watch them. There're not so many of those beauti
ful moments as I used to have...so 1 really close in on them.
I spend a fair amount of time listening to music. And over the last
35 to 40 years, I've ventured forth from the jazz of the '40s, '50s
and '60s, but 1 also come home quickly. The more complex and
multi-tonal the music—the more it is the likes of B U d
Powe 11 or THELONIUS MONK«». Jo h n
Coltrane or Bill Evans the happier I am.
Why do I love this kind of aesthetic? Y° u know the phrase:
"It's all good!" But truthfully, I do not reside very much outside
the realm of sensation and physicality. So visible, audible, tactile
experience is where I exist.. .the neighborhood where I live.
FT The discipline of gratitude.
m Why? There is no person I've ever met who is more for-
W tunate than I am. I wouldn't trade my life with anyone.
The business of remembering on a regular basis how fortunate I have
been . . .this matters. I think of the whole lot: parents, opportunities,
reasonable smarts or wits, to capitalize on opportunities. I have
found that there are other ways to express this. You can talk about
being "blessed " y° u can ta a^out being "begraced."
But I believe that one of the things that is important is regularly to
check in with how incredibly rich and wonderful life is.
ON MONEY
I've learned that there are layers of significance in money. Borrowed

money. . . weird senses of obligation.. . unfinished separation from parents...money lent to your children in what may be a perverse way
of continuing to try to exert some kind of control over them. This is a very thick topic. But my simplest, most basic attitude about
money isn't too unusual: I would love it if everyone had enough to make d 0....
An anecdote about loving your work:
I was once asked to preach the baccalaureate sermon for theological students at Duke. I knew this was a "heavy-duty occasion, with
faculty and families gathered before the students went forth to their jobs—most of them in churches. An image informed my sermon
(along with the prescribed texts, of course!). One day I was driving to the university from Chapel Hill where we lived, and I saw what I d
seen many times before on my daily commute: a huge tractor trailer stacked with boxes or cages tilled with live chickens. You could tell
that you were coming up on chicken trucks because there were feathers to be spied in the air. But when you pulled alongside them on the
road, you could see the chickens crowded in the boxes. This was the theme of my sermon:
Bgorwfgs MJ2 ililiSil Y&U UiER IQ. connect fx/srfA/rMuy w/rw
They think they're on a field trip. In fact they're taking the last ride of their lives. They are blinking enthusiastically. They are trying to
take in the sights. My point, to the graduating students —a point theological, existential, and otherwise was this: You who are leaving this
place to go out and exercise ministry (I think the point applies to anyone going out to practice any vocations).... if it dawns on you five or
six or seven days in a row, " I do not want to be heading in this direction," you must, for the sake of yourself, and for the sake of those
who know you and those you are serving, get out. Find some new passion. How are you going to serve people well when you are not
being well served by your passion? My sermon was not popular with some of my colleagues, who reminded me of the eternal and indeli
ble character of priesthood and ministry. They were right...but my remarks were about captivity, liberation and getting on the way in a
journey not yet finished.

An anecdote about loving your work:
I was once asked to preach the baccalaureate sermon for theological students at Duke. I knew this was a "heavy-duty occasion, with
faculty and families gathered before the students went forth to their jobs—most of them in churches. An image informed my sermon
(along with the prescribed texts, of course!). One day I was driving to the university from Chapel Hill where we lived, and I saw what I d
seen many times before on my daily commute: a huge tractor trailer stacked with boxes or cages tilled with live chickens. You could tell
that you were coming up on chicken trucks because there were feathers to be spied in the air. But when you pulled alongside them on the
road, you could see the chickens crowded in the boxes. This was the theme of my sermon:

They think they're on a field trip. In fact they're taking the last ride of their lives. They are blinking enthusiastically. They are trying to
take in the sights. My point, to the graduating students —a point theological, existential, and otherwise was this: You who are leaving this
place to go out and exercise ministry (I think the point applies to anyone going out to practice any vocations).... if it dawns on you five or
six or seven days in a row, " I do not want to be heading in this direction," you must, for the sake of yourself, and for the sake of those
who know you and those you are serving, get out. Find some new passion. How are you going to serve people well when you are not
being well served by your passion? My sermon was not popular with some of my colleagues, who reminded me of the eternal and indeli
ble character of priesthood and ministry. They were right...but my remarks were about captivity, liberation and getting on the way in a
journey not yet finished.

I came up with six things that matter to me that I have some clue
about why—but realized you need seven... so now I have seven.

IMARY LAYNE GREGG. LOVer,
Companion, Soulmate. She is the Who in what matters to
me. There are others closely connected to her and to me.
But she is where I would start. The Why is very simple: she is an
irresistible human being. In my life with this woman I've
been challenged again and again with this question: "how do you
love and how do you allow yourself to be loved —fully, as fully as
the good fortune of our meeting and 'hooking up'
seem to compel?" There are some tough moments in any serious
relationship. Mary Layne brought from her history this arresting and
attention-getting phrase:
"There's a dead bird between us!"
When this is heard, it is time to deal. We negotiate a lot about the
character of our love and the character of our relationship.
Does professional life work against our 36-year
opportunity of learning how to love? There is ambiguity here. The
sheer weight of somebody's work can get in the way. But I think
honesty dictates acknowledging that there is sometimes an instinct to
take shelter in your work!—in order to walk
around some of the challenges that are involved in a deep relation
ship. So it's a question on a given day of deciding whether to go do
your work, or to go deal with one of those dead-bird moments, or to
discover one of those moments when you might try to honor more
fully the other person. The question, with its several possibilities,
surfaces regularly. I've not it to this day ...

2 Some version of human flourishing matters-.
how can people find their ways to the best available, the
fullest feasible living? I'm caught up in that with myself and
I'm caught up in that with almost all my dealings with individuals
and groups of people.
If you talk about human flourishing you must talk about an impor
tant problematic: fairness and justice. Forme
these are a coupiet-flourishing and fairness.
What matters to me is human well-being and the problem of its
obstacles.. . real obstacles that are results of deeply institutionalized
bias and prejudice... and also self-constructed obstacles.
Sometimes ounces get in the way of our prospects for our own
and I call those equally real.
Why is this couplet, flourishing and justice, a matter of impor
tance to me? Because I know that life can be experienced as rich
and I also know that there are fetters...enslavements that need to
be removed...demons that must be defeated.
O tLAYEUSo ™ s is iar ® e f ° r me and s °
I can only hint at it. I am attracted to...fascinated by the arti
choke character of reality. The COMPLEXITIES OF PEOPLE.
The complexities ot literary texts that draw my attention. The com
plexity of systems of meaning, results of human yearning. I am
interested in the layers one finds in sacred stories. In my case the
inherited and appropriated sacred story is the true myth I care most
about. I seem to think about this story less in terms of propositional
axioms, less in terms ot extractable principles, these days. Rather, I
think about the density of the narrative, and it's a
£lv®. Its the narrative about captivity and release into a journey

that's under way and not yet finished. So for me, playing the
moments of my life against the larger moving picture that has at its
center the Exodus story and the Jesus saga —that kind of double story
of captivity, liberation, and being on the road, is very fundamental to
me.
But what 1 find myself doing is continually trying to tease out the lay
• .. _ •
ers of this story that I imagine we live in,
along with my personal history, and the stories of people I talk to.
I think I should say, because some of you might expect me to utter
something about God—that my way of imagining Godness is com
pletely within this notion of layers. "What dimensions and layers
are there in how we might imagine the forces of good or God?" 1
wonder, and it's striking to me that I am not attracted to
images of a transcendence,
purification, rarification, and simplicity. But I am attracted to
DENSITIES, overlapping possibilities of meaning, surprises,
pregnant ambiguities .so that my own religious
and spiritual tendencies are much more geological and archaeological
than astronomical and stratospheric. I don't quite know why this is or
where it's going. I just know that that's my center of gravity.
And why does all this matter to me? Layers and artichokes are
DE RERUM NATURA
This is the way things are, I'm convinced.
Humor of two kinds. I cannot
imagine making my way through an hour without a fairly
sharp sense of ironic humor. This is the kind of humor that
lets you know that we are all the naked emperor or empress. Seeing
the foibles, seeing the ridiculous in our «;rand plans and schemes 1 think
that connected to this is some using of humor to come to terms with
something I don't consider a bad thing—which is the incompleteness
and imperfection of all of us that might allow us to get over some of
performance pressures. We might
occasionally entertain the question, "even being the incomplete per
son I am, is it possible to be accepted anyway and to accept my life
and i, s IMPERFECTIONS?"
The second type of humor is equally important, though a little rarer,
because I think you can generate the first —your own ironic "take"
on the world. I'm speaking of the brand of funniness that simply
erupts in the middle of your experience, causing you to lose control
of your very controlled self and simply have a kind of rollicking
laughter that can reduce you to tears .. .and for at least that time in
which you are really genuinely laughing, makes you care-free.
Why humor? I find that humor gives you perspective, especially
perspective on human pretension..
But I also think the kind of surprising funniness that blows you
away when you least expect it keeps you loose. In my experience
everywhere, but especially here, being kept loose is a high priority.

5 The social, or communal over the individual. I discover
that I myself "privilege" or value the social, communal, rela
tional, institutional over the personal, the interior, the individ
ual, the private. The "systems" in which I've lived, with enthusiasm,
highlight as priorities social connection, causes, communities of peo
ple who need allies, partners. So for me, certain kinds of words and
phrases that capture crucial dynamics regularly come out: account
ability, faithfulness to an agreement to be with others, loyalty, loyal
ty to others, LOYALTY TO THE OTHER. Most of my time spent
both in acting and in reflection upon what matters to me, has this
clearly social and "outward" cast to it. As a result, it could be that I
am somewhat impoverished and unimaginative in my inner self, but
I don't seem to care much about that.
It's just a reality, a chosen "given."
And the Why? I think that to be answerable is a good thing. The
privilege and the promise of knowing others and being known, shar
ing some victories, sharing some losses, is a good thing. I value this.
For me, to be with is very fundamental to my sense of what it means
to be...to be with other people making their ways, as you are
...to be in relationship.
6 AESTHETICS • I have deep affection for
faces and voices. 1 really care about Greek, Roman, early
Christian and Byzantine Art. 1 spend a lot of time enjoying

philosophical systems or ornate stories that look as if they might
have an elegant coherence in themselves. 1 like them. I like the
FLIGHT OF A GOLF BALL-1 like .he jour
ney of a golf ball in the air. I like to see it hit the ground. It does
matter to me what part of the ground it hits. I take pleasure in
watching a golf ball roll and settle. So I don't play golf in the way
many other people play. I cherish particular beautiful moments, and
I stand there and watch them. There're not so many of those beauti
ful moments as I used to have...so 1 really close in on them.
I spend a fair amount of time listening to music. And over the last
35 to 40 years, I've ventured forth from the jazz of the '40s, '50s
and '60s, but 1 also come home quickly. The more complex and
multi-tonal the music—the more it is the likes of B U d
Powe 11 or THELONIUS MONK«». Jo h n
