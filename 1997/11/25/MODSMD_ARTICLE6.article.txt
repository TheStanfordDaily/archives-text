# What Matters to Me and Why Riffs:
## 
### Bob Gregg 
I came up with six things that matter to me that I have some clue
about why—but realized you need seven... so now I have seven.

IMARY LAYNE GREGG. LOVer,
Companion, Soulmate. She is the Who in what matters to
me. There are others closely connected to her and to me.
But she is where I would start. The Why is very simple: she is an
irresistible human being. In my life with this woman I've
been challenged again and again with this question: "how do you
love and how do you allow yourself to be loved —fully, as fully as
the good fortune of our meeting and 'hooking up'
seem to compel?" There are some tough moments in any serious
relationship. Mary Layne brought from her history this arresting and
attention-getting phrase:
"There's a dead bird between us!"
When this is heard, it is time to deal. We negotiate a lot about the
character of our love and the character of our relationship.
Does professional life work against our 36-year
opportunity of learning how to love? There is ambiguity here. The
sheer weight of somebody's work can get in the way. But I think
honesty dictates acknowledging that there is sometimes an instinct to
take shelter in your work!—in order to walk
around some of the challenges that are involved in a deep relation
ship. So it's a question on a given day of deciding whether to go do
your work, or to go deal with one of those dead-bird moments, or to
discover one of those moments when you might try to honor more
fully the other person. The question, with its several possibilities,
surfaces regularly. I've not it to this day ...

2 Some version of human flourishing matters-.
how can people find their ways to the best available, the
fullest feasible living? I'm caught up in that with myself and
I'm caught up in that with almost all my dealings with individuals
and groups of people.
If you talk about human flourishing you must talk about an impor
tant problematic: fairness and justice. Forme
these are a coupiet-flourishing and fairness.
What matters to me is human well-being and the problem of its
obstacles.. . real obstacles that are results of deeply institutionalized
bias and prejudice... and also self-constructed obstacles.
Sometimes ounces get in the way of our prospects for our own
and I call those equally real.
Why is this couplet, flourishing and justice, a matter of impor
tance to me? Because I know that life can be experienced as rich
and I also know that there are fetters...enslavements that need to
be removed...demons that must be defeated.

I can only hint at it. I am attracted to...fascinated by the arti
choke character of reality. The COMPLEXITIES OF PEOPLE.
The complexities ot literary texts that draw my attention. The com
plexity of systems of meaning, results of human yearning. I am
interested in the layers one finds in sacred stories. In my case the
inherited and appropriated sacred story is the true myth I care most
about. I seem to think about this story less in terms of propositional
axioms, less in terms ot extractable principles, these days. Rather, I
think about the density of the narrative, and it's a
£lv®. Its the narrative about captivity and release into a journey
