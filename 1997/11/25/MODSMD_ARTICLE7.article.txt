# Not of the Dead but the Living
## 
### 
It will rain tomorrow, as it rained in the dark days after you died.
And I will struggle with what to wear, and take a place on the bus
among those I will only ever know by the shape their shoulders make
above the backs of the seats before mine. It is November,
and storm clouds ascend above the roofs I can see from my window.
I don't know anymore where I think you've gone to. Whether your soul
waits here awhile—in my room; in the kitchen with the newly blown bulb—
or whether it rose instantly to the kingdom of hosannas. Some nights,
walking up my steps in the dark, digging for the mail and my keys,
I know you are far, infinitely far from us. That you watch
in the way one of us might pause a moment to watch a frenzy of ants,
wanting to help, to pick up the crumb and put it down close to their hill,
seeing their purpose that clearly.
