Closed in 1989 due to the Loma Prieta earthquake, the Stanford University Museum of Art has spent the past eight years under
going repair for seismic damage. It will reopen in January 1999 expanded and restructured as the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor
Center for the Visual Arts at Stanford. The museum's diverse holdings—a selection of which are presented here —will be a boon
to students and the community at large. For questions about the current exhibition program housed at the Art Gallery please

Educational Mission
Provided by the Office of the Stanford Museum
The Stanford Museum, founded with the University in 1891 by Jane and Leland
Stanford, opened to the public in 1894. From its beginnings, the museum has been com
mitted to an educational mission. With the only comprehensive collection between San
Francisco and Santa Barbara, the museum provides educational and aesthetic enjoyment to
residents of the Bay Area, to more than 200,000 visitors from around the world, and to the
University's population of students, faculty and staff. A large group of docent volunteers
serve about 25,000 children and adults in the community each year with programs that
include exciting lectures on the collections brought to the schools, hands on projects and
family tours of the Rodin Garden and campus outdoor art.
Teaching from objects is crucial to the museum's educational mission and therefore,
developing and preserving the collections and expanding related teaching activity are high

priorities.
The collections now comprise approximately twenty-thousand objects from all historic
periods. The focus in research and collecting over the twenty-five years prior to 1989 was
on the art of the 19th century, which resulted in the establishment of a fine European col
lection. Other highlights include the largest collection of Rodin sculpture outside the Musee
Rodin in Paris; an extensive collection of drawings, prints, and photographs; and important
works of art from Asia, Africa, Oceania, and the Americas.
As the museum plans for the opening of the new Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for
the Visual Arts at Stanford University, the intention in collecting is to maintain a compre
hensive coverage of the history of art, to build on current strengths and to significantly devel
op areas such as contemporary art and the arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas.
With a revitalized commitment to a teaching mission, a growing permanent collection,
and modern facilities, the Cantor Center will be an important factor in Stanford's efforts to
attract students who will be the future leaders in the arts — artists, teachers, scholars and

museum professionals.
The Cantor Center will become an active teaching area of the
University providing opportunities for undergraduates and graduate stu
dents to engage in scholarly research, exhibitions and publications, and to
explore museum careers. A rich variety of programs will encourage greater
involvement by departments throughout the University.
The Cantor Center will serve as a resource in University humanities
initiatives such as the Art Department's new program in American Art and
Material Culture, the History Department's proposal for the American
West and the School of Humanities and Sciences' new program in Rthnic
Studies.
There will be many spaces in the center devoted to teaching: a class
room for the community education programs; a seminar room for
University classes, located near art storage, offering the opportunity to
study works of art firsthand; and small study galleries. The lecture / per
formance hall will be equipped to accommodate music, dance, drama, and
film programs, lectures and symposia.
The new center will give particular attention to the interpretation of
special exhibitions and permanent collection installations. A newly estab
lished position of Curator of Education will enable considerable expansion
of the current scope of educational activity. The center will build on the
well established and highly successful community education program and
will actively reach out to a wide range of groups in the region including
primary and secondary schools, senior citizens and under served con
stituencies.
The Iris and B Gerald Cantor Center for the Visual Arts will build
upon the foundation of the past by providing Stanford students and the
community with a humanistic, diverse, visual arts education and by serv
ing as an inviting and innovative place for the study, appreciation, and
enjoyment of the arts.
