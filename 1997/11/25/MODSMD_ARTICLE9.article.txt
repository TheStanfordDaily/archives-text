Arethusa. the beautiful
nymph who scorned the
love of Alpheus the river
god. is featured on this fourth cen
tury silver coin minted at
Syracuse. as .the letters under the
chariot on the reverse indicate. A
myth told the story of how
Aretluisa escaped from the
advances ol the god by fleeing to
Syracuse. where she was changed
into a spring.
Every (ireek city-state
had its own coinage and distinc
tive emblem. For example, above
the chariot is the triskclcs. "triple
legs." aii emblem ol three-cor
nered Sicily. The task of present
ing so much information within
the small compass of a coin fell to

a class ol highly skilled metalworkers. Artists sjg.nat.ures often
appear on the obverse: the letters VA urtder the head of Arcthusa
have led some Scholars to believe that thev are the initials ol the
artist's name.

During the period of Egypt's occu
pation by the Romans, there
developed the practice of covering
the face of a mummy with a realistic por
trait painted on a thin wood panel. These
portraits, executed in a style wholly Greco-
Roman. took the place of traditional
Egyptian mummy masks. The technique of
encaustic—that is. painting with wax-based
pigments striking!'} resembles the l'fleet
ol modern oil painting. In their individual
ity and often poignant expressiveness, the
best of the Favum portraits in fact Seem
"modern" and offer a sharp contrast to the
decorative formality ol traditional
Egyptian sty le.
Hie Stanford Museum portrait, from
a cemetery at llavvara in the Favum. is
closely datable by its hairstyle and general
conception to the late second century. It is
clearlv the work of an artist of superior
abilitv.

Arethusa. the beautiful
nymph who scorned the
love of Alpheus the river
god. is featured on this fourth cen
tury silver coin minted at
Syracuse. as .the letters under the
chariot on the reverse indicate. A
myth told the story of how
Aretluisa escaped from the
advances ol the god by fleeing to
Syracuse. where she was changed
into a spring.
Every (ireek city-state
had its own coinage and distinc
tive emblem. For example, above
the chariot is the triskclcs. "triple
legs." aii emblem ol three-cor
nered Sicily. The task of present
ing so much information within
the small compass of a coin fell to

a class ol highly skilled metalworkers. Artists sjg.nat.ures often
appear on the obverse: the letters VA urtder the head of Arcthusa
have led some Scholars to believe that thev are the initials ol the
artist's name.

During the period of Egypt's occu
pation by the Romans, there
developed the practice of covering
the face of a mummy with a realistic por
trait painted on a thin wood panel. These
portraits, executed in a style wholly Greco-
Roman. took the place of traditional
Egyptian mummy masks. The technique of
encaustic—that is. painting with wax-based
pigments striking!'} resembles the l'fleet
ol modern oil painting. In their individual
ity and often poignant expressiveness, the
best of the Favum portraits in fact Seem
"modern" and offer a sharp contrast to the
decorative formality ol traditional
Egyptian sty le.
Hie Stanford Museum portrait, from
a cemetery at llavvara in the Favum. is
closely datable by its hairstyle and general
conception to the late second century. It is
clearlv the work of an artist of superior
abilitv.
