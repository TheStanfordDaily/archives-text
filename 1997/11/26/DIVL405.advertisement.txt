The Stanford Project on Nutrition, SPOON, is a campus-wide student
organization at Stanford University that channels unused food —which
otherwise would be thrown away—to hungry and homeless people in
the community. SPOON collects unserved food from campus eateries,
fraternity houses, eating clubs, cooperative kitchens, and university-run
food services, and distributes it to pantries and soup kitchens for
homeless and hungry people in the San Francisco Bay Area. Although
food service employees work hard to reduce the amount of food
wasted, prior to SPOON's existence most leftover food was thrown
away Recognizing this waste and the need for food in the Bay Area, a
few dedicated Stanford students founded SPOON in 1987. Since then,
enthusiasm for SPOON among campus coops and food service
k managers has grown tremendously. We hope to continue to
m build a strong bridge between Stanford and its neighbors in
the Bay area and to encourage food salvaging programs
throughout the U.S. For more information about
Jr SPOON, please call 725-1488
