# Pfefferbaum case to be heard
## Dismissed prof. to debate University lawyers Monday 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Lawyers for the University and for
Adolf Pfefferbaum will debate Monday in
a public hearing "disputed facts" in the case
of events surrounding the psychiatry pro
fessor's dismissal from Stanford.
Pfefferbaum — in a dispute with Stan
ford as to whether his retirement from a
paid position at the Palo Alto Veterans Af
fairs Hospital constituted a resignation
from his tenured professorship at the Uni
versity — requested the hearing after Uni
versity President (Jerhard Casper called for
his dismissal last May.

Richard Marcus, a law professor at the
I Iniversity of California's Hastings College
of Law in San Francisco, will act as hearings
officer as the University and Pfefferbaum
argue their positions on several facts identi
fied as "disputed" by Stanford's Advisory
Board to the Academic Council. The hear
ing begins at 8:30 a.m. Monday in Room
112 at the Center for Educational Research
at Stanford.
I he Advisory Board, chaired by Statis
tics Prof. Bradley Efron. has assigned Pfef
ferbaum the burden of proof on five out of
six contested points. The responsibility for
the sixth lies with Casper.
Casper — through Eli (iould. an outside

lawyer hired by the University for the case
must provide evidence that the VA hos
pital would normally have denied a request
by a staff member to continue work on
"without compensation" status after retire
ment.
The VA hospital has paid Pfefferbaum's
salary since he came to Stanford in 1974; he
was made a full professor of psychiatry at
the University in 1986. Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Peter Stone has dis
agreed with the University's claim that PI
efferbaum's resignation constituted a resig
nation from the Stanford faculty.
After resigning in July Pfef
ferbaum. who is the principal inves
tigator of grants funding a Mental
Health Clinical Research Center at
the VA hospital, expressed a desire
to continue his research on "without
compensation" status after retiring
from his position at the hospital.
According to a response to the
Advisory Board filed bv Pfeffer
baum's lawyer. Pete McC loskey, the
professor "did not retire from the
VA until his [without compensa
tion! application had been ap
proved. ... Dr. Pfefferbaum had no
reason to believe that such |without
compensation) status would not
continue indefinitely in order to per
mit him to continue his research
work indefinitely at the center."

While Pfefferbaum argues that
the VA hospital historically grants
such status to anyone approved by
Stanford, the I Jniversity argues in its
response that such decisions typical
ly are left up to the VA hospital ad
ministration.
The other issues that will he de
bated at Monday's hearing focus on
events surrounding a dispute be
tween Pfefferbaum and then VA
hospital Chief of Staff Richard
Mazze, against whom Pfefferbaum
and Assoc. Psychiatry Prof. Brant
Wenegrat filed a grievance in l c )%,
claiming he had taken "actions
which effectively denied academic
freedom to Stanford faculty as
signed to the VA."
The Advisory Board identified as
"disputed" whether Pfefferbaum's
research space and staff were cur
tailed after he lost his administrative
post as deputy chief of staff at the

VA hospital; whether the hospital
delayed approval of Pfefferbaum's
outside consulting services; and
whether a proficiency report and
counseling letter regarding Pfeffer
baum were circulated beyond "nor
mal channels" by Mazze.
In addition, McC'loskey will
bring up an additional issue not
agreed to by »he Advisory Hoard:
whether tlie actions ol the VA hos
pital and Mazze were "retaliatory in
nature."
The hearings officer has ruled
that such an issue is not within the
scope of questions he should consid
er.
In a letter to McC'loskey dated
Nov. 7, Efron denied an appeal of
Marcus' decision, saying the issue of
whether actions were "retaliatory"
is "an evaluative decision, not a
question of historical fact for the
hearing officer to determine."
