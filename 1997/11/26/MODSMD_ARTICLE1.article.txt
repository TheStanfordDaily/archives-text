# Pfefferbaum case to be heard
## Dismissed prof. to debate University lawyers Monday 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Lawyers for the University and for
Adolf Pfefferbaum will debate Monday in
a public hearing "disputed facts" in the case
of events surrounding the psychiatry pro
fessor's dismissal from Stanford.
Pfefferbaum — in a dispute with Stan
ford as to whether his retirement from a
paid position at the Palo Alto Veterans Af
fairs Hospital constituted a resignation
from his tenured professorship at the Uni
versity — requested the hearing after Uni
versity President (Jerhard Casper called for
his dismissal last May.

Richard Marcus, a law professor at the
I Iniversity of California's Hastings College
of Law in San Francisco, will act as hearings
officer as the University and Pfefferbaum
argue their positions on several facts identi
fied as "disputed" by Stanford's Advisory
Board to the Academic Council. The hear
ing begins at 8:30 a.m. Monday in Room
112 at the Center for Educational Research
at Stanford.
I he Advisory Board, chaired by Statis
tics Prof. Bradley Efron. has assigned Pfef
ferbaum the burden of proof on five out of
six contested points. The responsibility for
the sixth lies with Casper.
Casper — through Eli (iould. an outside

lawyer hired by the University for the case
must provide evidence that the VA hos
pital would normally have denied a request
by a staff member to continue work on
"without compensation" status after retire
ment.
The VA hospital has paid Pfefferbaum's
salary since he came to Stanford in 1974; he
was made a full professor of psychiatry at
the University in 1986. Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Peter Stone has dis
agreed with the University's claim that PI
efferbaum's resignation constituted a resig
nation from the Stanford faculty.
