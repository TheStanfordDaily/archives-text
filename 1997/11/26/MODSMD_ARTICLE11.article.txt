## Weapons threat is global, Iraq not the only problem 25 nations may now have weapons of mass destruction 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 25 nations
have or may be developing nuclear, biological and
chemi -al weapons and ways to deliver them.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said yesterday,
calling the threat "neither far-fetched nor far off."
"The front lines are no longer overseas," said
Cohen, releasing a report that said Americans could
fall victim to such an attack, because criminal orga
nizations and cults — as well as nation-states -
could deploy such weapons.
These weapons are "the poor man's atomic
bomb — cheaper, easier to produce and extremely
deadly," the defense secretary said.
Cohen said that while headlines have been full of
the United Nations' struggle to ferret out such
weapons of mass destruction held by Saddam Hus
sein, "the threat is not limited to Iraq." Even so, the
defense secretary said. Saddam apparently has been
able to produce enough deadly toxin "to kill every
man, woman and child on the face of the earth."
The United States and its U.N. partners have
been able to detail and study the Iraqi weapons
threat under the auspices of U.N. resolutions passed
after the Gulf war. The resolutions require Saddam
Hussein to destroy his weapons of mass destruction.
Uncovering such detail is impossible in nations such
as Iran, where U.S. officials do not have that kind of

access.
The report focused on Middle East and North
African nations and singled out Iran. Iraq. Libya
and Syria as trouble spots. They "are aggressively
seeking NBC weapons and increased missile capa
bilities" and constitute "the most pressing threats"
to stability in the region, the study said.
The Pentagon declined to list all 25 nations men
tioned in the report, calling the information classi
fied.
But it did specify other nations such as North
Korea. China, India. Pakistan and Russia, whose
programs may pose a threat to the I Jnited States.
On a positive note, the report welcomed "a dra
matic reduction in the threat from the countries of
the former Soviet Union." Six nations "that might
have become nuclear powers — Ukraine, Kaza
khstan. Belarus, North Korea, South Africa and
Iraq — have been turned away from that path," it
said.
The study, the second such Pentagon report on
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
largely repeats last year's report.
But it warns that if a conflict again breaks out in
the Persian Gulf, some form of the weapons is like
ly to be used, particularly since several nations there
have used them in the past.
