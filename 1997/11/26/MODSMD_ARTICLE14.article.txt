## Editorial A 						rivalry gone sour 
### 
This year's Big Game
saw disturbing levels
of personal injuries.

AT THIS YEAR S Big Game the
limits of spirited rivalry were
exceeded. The Stanford-California
rivalry brings unity and enthusiasm to ;i
campus that generally, especially given
Stanford's athletic success, is lacking in
school spirit. But when the rivalry moves
from partying and pranks to personal injury
and threats — it has gone too far.
This year, the usual melee of vandalism
and taunts was not sufficient. Violence
reared its head at the game and throughout
Big Game week, in forms that seriously
threatened the integrity and the intent of
the perpetrators. Goalposts were torn
down, causing thousands of dollars of dam
age, but even more disturbing is that at least
six students were admitted to the hospital
for injuries sustained during the post-game
celebration.
This year students suffered more injuries
than in previous years. Throwing frozen
fruit and rocks can have no other intent but
to physically injure. And it is at such a point
that it has gone too far, when an action is
taken that threatens the physical safety of
another.
Chants, insults and even mild vandalism
have been customary, and even expected,
from year to year. Throwing fruit and
upending of the field's goalposts have also
occurred in the past. But this year. The
Daily Californian's poor judgment resulted
in a threat that cannot be reasoned away by
rivalry.

A column appeared in last Thursday's
Daily Cal that "jokingly" directed students
to "show your spirit on Chelsea's bloodied
carcass" and at the same time identified her
place of residence is another example of
rivalry gone awry. The column attacked
Stanford as elitist and focused on Chelsea
( linton as a primary symbol of a school that
has replaced "integrity and excellence with
patrician posturing."
The overall tone was not only one of bit
terness. but also one of violence. "We need
you to damage Cardinals. We need you to
clip them and hold them and do everything
you can to incapacitate their elitist little
asses.
"If you can't win, just try to do as much
lasting physical damage as possible. I want
breaks, people — not fractures, breaks. I
want to be able to see bone from the cheap
seats."
While hyperbole about wanting to kill
the Cardinal is a standard rallying cry, and
the column's chastisement of Stanford as
elitist and conceited is marginally within the
bounds of competitive reason, the irrespon
sibility of the paper in printing information
that could physically endanger an individu
al student is both unprofessional and irre
sponsible. Although The Daily Cal
expressed its "regrets" about the column,
the damage had already been done.
The incident with The Daily Cal is only
one symptom of a rivalry that has manifest
ed itself into more than good-natured fun.
Students, from Stanford or Cal, should not
have to sustain broken legs and head
injuries due to thrown rocks.
We need to take a step back and reflect
on the ramifications of an overdeveloped
sense of rivalry. The benefits of school spir
it pale in the face of serious threats and
injuries to individuals.
