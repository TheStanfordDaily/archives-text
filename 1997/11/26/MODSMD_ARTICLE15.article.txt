## Sacrificing to the God of Labor 
### 
YES, MY fellow
folk. it is that time
of year again, that
time for the meal to end all
meals, the gustatory indul
genee of the premiere
first-world country on this
planet.
Thanksgiving.

And with it comes my last foray into the
world of public words for the quarter.
The timing couldn't be better, as this is
the point in the quarter where those projects
that seem so very distant suddenly come into
stark, painful focus. Much like a camera
doing a close-up on Janet Reno (or, in my
case, Janet Reno with an evil grin on her
face).
Rest assured that, like many of my ilk, I'll
be sacrificing most of the joys of having a few
days off to the gaping maw of the God of
Labor. Then, when everyone's back from
dealing with the relatives, we can all march
hand-in-hand down to the Laborious One's
infinity of underground salt mines to toil for
another two weeks.
Which brings me to the question of the
week, the one I'll leave you with for a while:
why do we work like this? We repeatedly
drive ourselves to exhaustion for years.
There are people here who are on a class
of grade-grubbing equal only to the finest
truffle-sniffers. Even half-assed work done
around here is better than most full-assed
work done elsewhere.
We may not be too great at caring about
the world, maintaining healthy social lives or
inspiring great intellectual discussions — but
we can work like nobody else. Why do we do
it?
In my mind, this is the fundamental ques
tion that all of us must answer or be damned.

Unfortunately, it's easy to work without
thinking around here, without deviatir\° too
far or striving too much beyond the level of
the task.
And yet, beyond the level of the task lies
the heart of the matter. You see, you could
spend your life being bounced between one
task and another without taking an active
part in choosing the tasks. You can work for
simple reasons and nothing else: a gcxnJ
grade or a good wage.
Now, don't get me wrong. The simple rea
sons are often important. But at the end, if all
you can show the Great Arbiter are simple
reasons, she's going to shake her head sadly
and send you to the land of lawyers and man
agement consultants.
If you don't control the direction of your
own life, someone else is going to control its
direction for you. If someone else controls
the direction of your life, you will wake up at
some point in your mid-40s and realize that
you've wasted most of your life.
This state is what's commonly called the
"world of hurt." Most people deal with it by
buying expensive things and forgetting that
there was anything more than life. This leads
to the sad, deific figure and damnation.
Right now, a lot of you probably believe
that there aren't many choices you can make.
Most degree programs are fairly linear in
direction, and most graduate advisers have
an infinite stack of things for students to do
This is what's commonly termed a "ratio
nalization" (or, in more direct circles, "bull
shit"). Buying this earns you a one-way tick
et to Painsville.
If you don't believe me, look at a typical
graduate student.
A typical graduate student is a regular
student who is so amazingly willed or amaz
ing blind that he or she will suffer through

another four to eight years of school. A typi
cal graduate student is in a lot of pain, but is
too stubborn or scared to admit it. A typical
graduate student is in the world of hurt many
years sooner than everyone else.
Sure, a few of them love their subjects.
They never have the problem of wondering
why they work, because they don t work.
Their life is a wonderfully entertaining
game.
These few are the brilliant people. Most
of us will never be that smart. If you have to
ask why you work, you aren't that smart.
Many typical graduate students end up
spending their lives convincing other people
to become as educated as they are.
Many of the people teaching you now
were typical graduate students. These are the
same people who do such a good job at keep
ing you too busy to think about why you're
doing it all. They laugh at such questions,
because laughter is good medicine for pain
(and because it's funny to watch people
make mistakes).
So, as you gobble-gobble or struggle
struggle this weekend, think about this:
No matter what your parents, your uni
versity, your government, your society, your
advisor or your roommate tell you, you don't
have to be here. You don't have to work like
this. In fact, if you don't know why you're
working, you shouldn't work until you can
come up with a good reason — for yourself
— for doing so.
In the process, you might give the turkey's
death a little meaning.

'round for his shoes, know 'bout that baby,
he got those old walkin' blues.
