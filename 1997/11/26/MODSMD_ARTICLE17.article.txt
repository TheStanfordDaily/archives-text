Please take time with
course evaluations
This year the ASSU lias been working
to produce an undergraduate course eval
uation guide. This will be a joint effort with
the ()ffices oi the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences. Vice-Provost for Undergraduate
Education and the Undergraduate Advis
ing Center. We hope to create a course
guide that will contain responsible and
helpful information to supplement the
advising process. To that end, we are ask
ing for faculty and students to help
improve the quality and rate of participa
tion in the end-quarter evaluation survey.
The course guide will be based in part
on quantitative information from the end
quarter course evaluations, which the Fac
ulty Senate voted to release earlier this
month. Io ensure that these evaluations
are complete and taken seriously, we ask
ing faculty to set aside at least 15 minutes
(preferably at the beginning of class) for
the completion of the forms. And we are
asking students to approach these evalua
tions with thoughtfulness and maturity.
C iiving the evaluations greater attention
now will ensure that future course guides
will be useful and accurate for both stu

dents and faculty.
We are excited about this faculty-stu
dent partnership in creating a course guide
that will benefit the entire Stanford com
munity. Thank you for your help in this
effort.

Stanford fans were
trying to save posts
1 would like to point out that whoever
penned the cartoon in Monday's Daily
about Stanford students running from a
few Weenies demolishing our goal post
clearly did not understand the situation at
all. Rather, there were several hundred
noble Stanford students that attempted to
protect our stadium grounds, but the stadi
um police and sheriffs prevented this. A
great mass of students tried to surge
toward the cowardly Berkeley students to
protect what was ours, but instead of the
authorities preventing the destruction of
the goalposts, they spent their time pre

venting students from saving the goalposts.
If not for that, rest assured. Stanford Sta
dium would surely have two upright goal
posts today.

Seilbach should allow
Muhammad to speak
Recently it has come to my attention
that you [Jeffrey Seilbach] and your office
are imposing what 1 believe to be discrimi
natory policy on a newly-founded student
organization, the Time Is Now (TIN),
regarding the issue of khallid-Abdul
Muhammad's appearance on this campus.
As a student at our prestigious universi
ty. 1 expect to be able to hear whomever I
please. Stanford University is supposedly a
haven for academic expression, yet 1 am
appalled at the way the TIN and its leader
ship has been systematically censored by
yourself, the Office of Risk Management
and University administration. As stu
dents. we have every right to hear Muham
mad speak.
Recently, President Clinton called for a
national dialogue on race. Muhammad's

appearance on this campus will do nothing
hut spark that dialogue so sorely missing
from our education here. Stanford does
not offer me the education 1 believe I have
the right to receive. Honest, open dialogue
about race does not exist on this campus;
in fact, it is a joke not worth laughing at.
Why do you not want Muhammad on
this campus? What risk does he pose? Why
does he require a $5 million indemnity
bond before he will be allowed to set foot
on this campus? Why wasn't the same
required of the student group who facili
tated a gathering (which consisted of only
a few people) to hear David Duke speak in
a dormitory on our campus? What makes
a speech by Muhammad so much more
dangerous than a speech by Duke? Basi
cally, Seilbach, what are you afraid of?
To me, this is not about Muhammad
any longer. This issue concerns me
because 1 am being denied my right to aca
demic freedoms. I thought Stanford aimed
to support students in our academic pur
suits, whatever they may be. 1 was not
aware that our pursuits have to conform to
your homogeneous mold.
I do not necessarily believe all of what
Muhammad has to say. but I feel that I
deserve the opportunity to hear him speak.
Let me decide. You do not have the right
to decide who I can and cannot hear, and

by imposing your ridiculous monetary
restrictions, you are only reinforcing to me
and others what we have suspected all
along.
Stanford spouts buzzwords such as
"multiculturalism" and "diversity" so
often that these word have become cliche
and downright hypocritical.
Stanford does not support our students'
right to freedom of expression. Stanford
does not protect our right to academic
freedoms. Stanford will allow Duke to
speak to a gathering of students on this
campus, but will not allow Muhammad to
even set foot on this campus or drive
through it.
Stanford and its systematic, institution
al discrimination disgusts me. I pay the
same amount as does everyone else, yet 1
cannot hear who I want to hear. Stanford
needs to rethink its selective policy regard
ing the speakers it chooses to insure and
endorse.
If you decide you do not want contro
versial black speakers on this campus, then
let us know that please. The least you and
your administration can do is be honest
with us. I cannot respect any entity that
will not be honest about confronting the
real issue.
