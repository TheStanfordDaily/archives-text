# Foreign Bureau: Berlin
## After a quarter, last minute culture shock 
### 
Marni Left

It'Ol ARDED Dii Friday night. I was
not attempting to huv alcohol, nor was I
doing anything lhat might otherwise be
considered illegal in the United States; I was
merely trying to go see a movie, a pretty
innocuous way to spend a Friday night.
The woman who carded me did so nol
because she thought I under 21, nor even
because she doubted whether or not I was IS.
The Germans rate movies differently than
back in the States, and the woman who card
ed me wanted to make sure that I was 16.
1 am not much more than five feet tall,
and admittedly I do look young.
Aside from the sheer humiliation that I
felt when the woman asked for I D., I was
highly annoyed that this woman, who herself
was quite possibly even younger than me,
thought lhat 1 looked like a sophomore in
high school.
As my friends and I discussed the situa
tion. the irony was inescapable. The first few
weeks that I was here, I went out to eat often.
Each time I ordered a glass of wine. 1 looked
around carefully expecting to be denied or. ;it

the very least, carded. Yet not once did a
waiter a waitress so much as bat an eye. But,
going to see a movie, 1 was harassed, ques
tioned and otherwise degraded.
1 guess there is no rule that says after two
months in Germany I am no longer allowed
to experience culture shock. But as I sit here
writing my last column for the Foreign
Bureau, with final papers and exams looming
and travel plans for vacation finally close to
becoming a reality, I realize that 1 have come
a long way.
1 remember at the beginning of the quar
ter trying to return a blanket that 1 decided
that I didn't need. I cannot even begin to
count the times that I have returned unwant
ed goods to American stores. The talent of
talking a store into taking back an item,
which ;it first some sales clerk deems unre
turnable. is one that I am proud to say 1 per
fected around the 7th grade.
('ollectivcly, customer service representa
tives in (iermany would benefit greatly from
an extensive training session with their
American counterparts. The "customer is

always right" mentality has yet to reach (Ger
many. Convincing a sales clerk in broken and
ungranimatieal German that indeed n was
her store's obligation to allow me to return a
blanket â€” a bedding item that the store had
a specific policy against taking hack
proved no small feat, especially when 1 didn't
have the credit caid to which 1 wanted her to
credit the return. Though 1 was Mustered and
it took nearly 45 minutes. 1 succeeded in get
ting my money back. 1 can say. too. that I
learned from the experience.
When the woman harassed me at the
movies, I looked her in the eye and
addressed her with the informal "du." which
in German is used not just for familv and
Iriends, but also for someone who you con
sider a peer. It was quite a victory as it was
the tirst time I didn't feel that the language
barrier rendered me helpless against an
insult or rudeness from a random stranger,
the kind of behavior that at home I simply
refuse to tolerate.
Before I came to (iermanv, I expected to
find the language barrier frustrating. I

expected that these little and relatively
insignificant differences between Germany
and America would drive me cra/y. After
having spent almost a quarter here. I can
honestly say. however, that such trivialities
comprise only a small part of the culture
shock that I have experienced, lor me the
biggest shock has been for the first time
beginning to understand how much of a
shadow history casts on the present in Berlin.
As a Jewish American, some of these his
torieal reminders strike a bigger chord than
others: A yellow and brown sign at Witten
bergplatz, a subway station located in the
heart ol western Berlin, listing the names ol
all the Na/i death camps; Plaques on build
ings and hotels whose owners had their prop
erly seized from them during the war; A
poignant memorial in the square where the
Na/is burned books in May of IIW.l l W.
et it would be naive not to acknowledge
that war scars go deeper than memorials and
signs. At the beginning of the Kurfursten
danim. Berlin's posh avenue lined with
shops, the bombed out remains of Kaiser

Wilhclm (icdachtnis kirche serve as a
reminder to all passers In. a permanent \ isu
at testimony u> the extent ol war's destine
tiveness
During my time in Merlin. I have struggled
to make sense ol what it means to he Jewish
in (Jermany. As I have attended operas and
coneerts, as I have visited museums, as I have
traveled aeross the eountr\, as I have tra\
eled around the city. I have come to reali/e
that I will never be able to lulls reconcile
Merlin's past with the present.
Meing 111 Merlin I have come to reali/e that
lor Merliners the dillerence between "nevei
lorget" and "constantly remember" is small.
In a lot of ways. I find that thought liiglih
comforting, hut in others it strikes me as
decidedly depressing. I am far from having
come close to assimilation, hut I do think that
my inability to deal with the past in terms ol
the present makes me no different from any
other Merliner.
