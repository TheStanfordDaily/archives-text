## Innovative CE class teaches teamwork and technology 
### Erika Check Contributing writer 
Next quarter, while some stu
dents search frantically for summer
jobs and internships, about 20 grad
uates and undergraduates in engi
neering, architecture and construc
tion management will have a chance
to gain real-world experience in
their chosen disciplines without
ever leaving the Stanford campus.
I lie opportunity is part of an inno

vative class called Civil Engineering
122/222, in which groups of stu
dents work in teams to design struc
tures with the help of an impressive
collection ol technological tools.
Renate Fruchter, a senior
research engineer at the Center for
Integrated Facilities Engineering
coordinates CE 122 / 222, which
debuted five years ago and has
metamorphosed over time in
response to new technologies and
student input. A group of professors

from Stanford and IJC-Berkeley
teach the class, which is open to stu
dents at both schools.
According to Fruchter, the main
idea behind CE 122/222 is to offer
students a chance to learn in a real
life environment by working with
members of other disciplines to cre-

ate a product in response to a
client's needs. Each team consists of
three graduate students, one each in
engineering, construction manage
ment and architecture. Undergrad
uates join the teams as apprentices.

Fruchter said that the core of the
class is involved with trying to get
students to think outside of their
own disciplines and take an inte
grated approach to each problem.
" The goal of the class and of pro
ject-based learning is to actually
train a new generation of practition-

ers to know how to team up with
practitioners from other disciplines
and take advantage of information
technologies to produce better and
cheaper products," she explained.
An integral part of the class is a

workspace called the Project Based
Learning Lab (FBLL), which
Fruchter designed. The lab contains
12 networked SUN workstations,
and each computer is stocked with a
collection of specialized design soft
ware ranging from traditional pro
grams like AutoCAD, a computer
aided design package, to Virtual
Reality Markup Language
(VRML), which translates two
dimensional AutoCAD designs into
3-D images so that the user can
"walk through" the rooms and

spaces of a newly designed building.
Fruchter said that her emphasis
on cooperation comes in response
to a real concern in the building
industry. "Project-based learning is
not just a fashion, but it is coming in
response to an industry-perceived
need to have broader-educated
practitioners who ... can use team
work to understand the roles of
their disciplines in a global market."
she said. That means, for example,

that architects need to think like
engineers, and engineers need to
understand a construction manag
er's concerns lor projects to suc
ceed.
First-year structural engineering
graduate student (Jinn Sandoval
served as an undergraduate appren
tice in the class last year. She liked
the opportunity it afforded students
to interact with people in the build
ing industry, who served as mentors
loi the project teams.
Last year's mentors included
C ireg I.uth. a structural engineer
with Krawinkler, Luth & Associ
ates. as well as Jim Bartoul and
I urn Weidecker, who work as con

struction managers with Barnes
Construction. The mentors serve as
guides and to help students figure
out solutions to the kinds of prob
lems they face in the design pro
cess.
For Sandoval, the mentors pro
vided a link to the real world that
students can miss out on when they
focus on their schoolwork. "I
thought that was the coolest thing
to talk to these people and see
what's happening in industry.
Sometimes you don't know what's
going 011 out there because you're
just going to classes and you don't
see the real world part of the indus
try," Sandoval said.
However, the practical nature ol
the class doesn't just help the stu
dents Mark 1 leller took ( 1 222 last
year as a graduate student and now

works as an engineer for Skidmore.
Owings and Merrill in San Francis
co. Heller believes that classes like
CE 122/222 benefit the industry
because they educate students in
technologies and methods that arc
so advanced that the industry hasn't
yet begun to use them on a large
scale. "I he people who take the
class are moving into the industry
and we tell our supervisors about
the ideas we've learned. I hat's how
|new technologies] get implement
ed," he said.
In that sense, Fruchter is doing
more than preparing a generation
of students to succeed. She. her
students and their industry sup
porters are reforming the face of
modern building and design. And
it's all happening right here next
quarter.
