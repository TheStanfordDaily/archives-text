wide use nonsteroidal anti-inflam
niatory drugs, or NSAIDs. lor a
variety of ailments. When used in
small, intermittent doses, they are
considered to be relatively safe.
Hut higher doses over a longer
period of time can induce life
threatening stomach bleeds.
NSAIDs are a heterogeneous
group of drugs that share in com
mon the triple effects of alleviat
ing pain, reducing fever, and.in
larger, repeated doses, reducing
inflammation. In addition to a
number of prescription-only
drugs, they include four non-pre
scription drugs: acctylsalicylie
acid, commonly referred to as
aspirin; ibuprofen, the active
ingredient in Advil and other
brands: ketoprofen, the active
ingredient in Orudis KT and
Action: and naproxen, the active
ingredient in Aleve.
Stanford researchers have now
ranked l(> of the most commonly
used NSAIDs according to safety.
Po come up with their rankings.
(iurkirpal Singh, clinical assistant
professor of medicine (immunol
og\ and rheumatology), and his
associates analyzed information
from the ARAMIS (Arthritis,
Rheumatism and Aging Medical
Information System) database.
The database includes informa
tion from medical centers across
North America, collected over a
period of years.
I hey have also developed a
simple questionnaire, called the
Stanford Calculator of Risk for
I vents (S('ORL'). According to
Singh, this questionnaire is the
lirst simple and accurate predic
tor of the risk that a patient will

suffer a NS A ID-induced stomach
bleed.
NSAIDs are commonly used
for treatment of arthritis because
they effectively alleviate the pain
and inflammation characteristic ol
the disease without the immune
suppression and other adverse
side effects associated with pro
longed steroid use. However,
there also may be negative conse
quences. According to Singh, one

percent of arthritis patients on
NSAID regimens will develop a
stomach bleed, and 10 to 15 per
cent of those patients will die.
"Only about 30 percent of
stomach ulcers are caused by
NSAIDs," said Singh, "but 75 per
cent of all stomach ulcers that
bleed are NSAID induced." He
went on to explain that this is
because the more common, bacte
ria induced ulcer is symptomatic

and, therefore, likely to be treated
earlier. "NSAID induced stomach
ulcer is typically asymptomatic
and unlikely to be noticed until a
bleed occurs," he added.
After they are absorbed into
the bloodstream, NSAIDs interact
with enzymes called eyclooxyge
nase land 2 (Cox-1 and Cox-2).
Both are involved in the synthesis
