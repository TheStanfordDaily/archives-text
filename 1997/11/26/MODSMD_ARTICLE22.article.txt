Traditional supercomputers to dis
appear within the decade

John Hennessy, professor of computer science and
dean of the School of Engineering, predicts that with
in the next five to 10 years, traditional supercomputers
will become obsolete. In a talk given Nov. l l ) at the

SC'97 conference in San Jose, he claimed that "the last bastion of
non-microprocessor computing, the vector-based supercomputers,
will vanish."
"Vector-based" supercomputers, like the famous Cray machines,
have been used since the l l )5()s to perform tasks that require extraor
dinarily fast processing speeds. However, new microprocessor tech
nology has improved to the extent where desktop machines may soon
be able to perform the tasks that only supercomputers can complete
now.
In fact, improvements in microprocessors have already made the
large mainframe computers, once the core of industry computing,
obsolete. According to Hennessy. vector-based supercomputers will
be the next to go.
As microprocessor-based computers attain faster and faster pro
cessing speeds, they are able to do a higher proportion of computing
jobs. Basically, that means the user can get more computing bang for
their buck using microprocessor-based computers. Eventually,
demand for vector-based supercomputers will tall dramatically as
consumers find that most of their needs can be accommodated by the
more cost-effective microprocessor computers.
"Most importantly, the price-performance gap between the two
types of machines is closing at a compounding rate," Hennessy said.
Already, microprocessor-based computer users get more than twice
the processing power per dollar than vector-based supercomputer
users. Hennessy predicts that soon, the ratio may approach five times
the processing power per dollar.
Another problem that traditional supercomputers face is the lack
of commercial software. Most supercomputers rely on customized
software, which can often be extremely expensive. In order to maxi
mize profits, most software companies prefer to create software for
larger markets, so the relatively small number of supercomputei users
are often left out of the commercial software market. As ;i result.
