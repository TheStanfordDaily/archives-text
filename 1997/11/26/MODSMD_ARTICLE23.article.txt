My lather recently
had a coronary artery
bypass graft (a bypass), and I was
wondering if you could provide a
little more insight as to what that
entails. 1 hanks.

A Dear Mr. Chun.
For some patients,
the reasons for having
heart surgery are genetic,
others ma\ have suffered a severe
trauma (i.e. car accident, industrial
accident) to the chest area, but
more commonly, patients have
environment- or diet-induced
atherosclerosis.
Some ot the most common lac

tors contributing to atherosclerosis
arc diets high in saturated fat and
cholesterol, being overweight, hav
ing little or no routine cardiovascu
lar exercise and living with high
levels of daily stress. Over an
extended period of time these lac
tors negatively affect the ability of
an otherwise healthy human heart
to function properly.
As a result of the damage that
these factors cause, blood flow to
the heart is impaired. Because one
organ is responsible for supplying
the rest of the body with nourishing
blood, a short "pause" in blood
flow to cardiac muscle is a very big
deal. In fact, it usually sets the stage
for a heart attack.
In order to correct the situation
and facilitate blood flow to the

heart again, a patient's doctor
might recommend what is referred
to as a coronary artery bypass graft
(C'ABG. pronounced "cabbage"),
better known as a bypass. A sur
geon will determine which blood
tlow pathways to the heart are in
need of the most help. Then, the
surgeon will attach a supplemen
tary artery circumventing the sec
tion of the original coronary artery
that is blocked, restoring blood
tlow to the particular area of the
heart served hv the artery. Thus,
the new piece of artery "bypasses"
the section of the original artery
causing the problem — a coronary
detour, so to speak. If the surgery is
successful, proper blood flow is
then ' '•supplied to the heart via the
new graft.

I've been looking for a
way to increase and main
tain my calcium intake,
but I am also lactose intolerant.
Any quick suggestions?

A Dear Jen.
I too. am mildly lac
tose intolerant and
sometimes find it diffi
cult to make sure I'm getting my
RDA of calcium. Luckily, there are
several options for us to choose
from in this day of nutrition gurus
and dietary supplements.
First and foremost, you can buy
just about any dairy product you

want with the lactose removed.
I lie brand I .act aid has several
items — everything ranging from
milk to ice cream to many different
kinds of cheeses. Almost all til the
major supermarkets and stores
carry these items.
Alternate cly. barring am
unknown medical conditions you
might want to consider the use ol a
daily calcium supplement or daily
vitamin. I'here are several br uids
that are just as good and much kss
expensive than many of the name
brands. But. as always, you should
always first consult your primal \
care physician before taking an\
sort of dietary supplement or daily
vitamin.
