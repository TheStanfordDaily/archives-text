# Heavyweight forfeit costs wrestling
## 
### Evan Meagher Contributing writer 
The Stanford wrestling team entered
last night's dual meet against defending
NCAA Division II champion San Fran
cisco State determined not to fall victim

to the same weakness in the heavier divi
sions that led to its first two defeats.
But a -series ol mistakes in the second
half of the meet led to another disap
pointing loss for the Cardinal.
I'lic match started well for Stanford,
with the liuhter weight classes delivering

as usual. With the exception ot lIS
pound freshman Levi Wcikel-Magden.
who lost a major decision in his first
match back from a mild concussion, the
first five Stanford wrestlers were able to
subdue their San Francisco Slate coun
terparts. Redshirt sophomore /ach /im

on Jon Nichols at 4:0(>.

Freshman Jason lalboit followed
with a nail biting win in the l>4 pound
weight class. Scoreless in the second
frame, lalboit gave up a one point
escape before countering with a lake

with an escape.

pin to win the meet because of the
Cardinal's impending forfeit in the
heavyweight division.
Kendall took a 5-4 lead into the
second period, but with insufficient
time to score the required 15-point
lead for the tech. lie was forced into
an overly aggressive attack in the
hopes of a pin. Kendall probably
could have handled Delgado were it
not for the required pin, but the
Gator senior was able to wrestle
conservatively and take advantage
of Kendall's mistakes en route to a
9-6 victory.
The meet revealed a disturbing
trend that is developing early in
Stanford's season. After a strong
start by the lighter weight classes,
the ( ardinal dropped four consecu
tive matches before forfeiting the
heavyweight division, eventually
losing 23-15.
"In the 167-, 177- and (190-
pound weight classes), the condi
tioning needs to come up." Horpel
said. "We're winning in the lower

divisions because of conditioning.
We're losing in the heavier divisions
because of conditioning."
The vacancy in the 275-pound
division continues to plague the
Cardinal, as Horpel struggles to find
someone, anyone, to fill the slot.
While the prospect of recruiting one
of three ex-wrestlers on the football
team is looking more and more
attractive, "It looks doubtful," Hor
pel said. "It's a lot to ask. because
wrestling's so intense."
Furthermore, the absence of cap
tain Scott Chapman in the 177-
pound division may well have cost
the Cardinal another meet. A victo
ry there would have meant a six
point swing, allowing Kendall to
wrestle more conservatively in the
190-pound weight class.
Stanford wrestling returns to
action Dec. 5 at the Las Vegas Invi
tational in Stateline, Nev. I he Invi
tation;)! is the largest tournament in
the country, with up to 50 entrants
in a single weight class. The Cardi
nal will have its hands full compet
ing against most of the East Coast
and almost all of the historically
strong Midwestern teams.
