# Heavyweight forfeit costs wrestling
## 
### Evan Meagher Contributing writer 
The Stanford wrestling team entered
last night's dual meet against defending
NCAA Division II champion San Fran
cisco State determined not to fall victim

to the same weakness in the heavier divi
sions that led to its first two defeats.
But a -series ol mistakes in the second
half of the meet led to another disap
pointing loss for the Cardinal.
I'lic match started well for Stanford,
with the liuhter weight classes delivering

as usual. With the exception ot lIS
pound freshman Levi Wcikel-Magden.
who lost a major decision in his first
match back from a mild concussion, the
first five Stanford wrestlers were able to
subdue their San Francisco Slate coun
terparts. Redshirt sophomore /ach /im
merer began the run with an arm bar pin
on Jon Nichols at 4:0(>.
