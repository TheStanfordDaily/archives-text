# Thanksgiving weekend no holiday for hoops teams
## Women come home looking to halt losing streak 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
When looking at the slate of
games for the Stanford women's bas
ketball team over the Thanksgiving
holiday, a split against San Francisco
and No. 1 Tennessee would seem
like a reasonable expectation.
What was not anticipated, howev
er, is that this would be an improve
ment from last weekend's disastrous
opener.
The llth-ranked Cardinal (0-2)
will attempt to put an end to its first
losing streak in more than three
years tonight against San Francisco
(2-0) in its home opener. Then, in
three days, two-time defending
national champion Tennessee comes
to San Jose Arena to square off
against the Cardinal in the Bravo

Card Classic, a nationally televised
revival of one of the great rivalries in
women's basketball.

"I'm definitely reconsidering (the
Tennessee game), wishing it was at
Maples," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "But we're not
changing our schedule, we're chang
ing the way we play."
Indeed. Stanford has some prob

lenis it needs to fix in a hurry. I lie
Cardinal's deep frontline was appar
ently not ready to play this past
weekend, as senior center Olympia
Scott and senior forward Heather
Owen were plagued by foul trouble
during Stanford's two losses.
Senior forward Vanessa Nygaard
was consistent enough to lead the
team in scoring against Wisconsin
and Purdue but sin >bviously can
not carry the scoring load alone,
turnovers reared theii ugly heads
again, as the inexperience o! sopho
more guards Milena Mores. Melody
Peterson and Christina liatastini
were painfully apparent in the 51
turnovers committed by Stanford.
As a result. VanDerveer has said
she will tinker with her lineup to try
to give tin team some sort ol spark.
"We missed a ton of easy bas
kets." VanDerveer said. " I hey were
close games down the stretch, but we
did things that I'm not used to see
ing. We did not run in either game,
both teams penetrated like cra/\ and
our defense was porous."
Playing in the cozy confines of
Maples Pavilion will certainly help,
and there's probably nobody better
suited to cure Stanford's ills than the
Lady Dons. For a team that gave
Stanford all it could handle last sea
son before losing M-46 at IJNI . the
Lady Dons have fallen on hard
times. They have lost three starters
to graduation, and injury-plagued
star guard Mrittanv l.indhe has elect
ed to rcdshirt her senioi season.
Nevertheless. I iSI has started
out 2-0 against considerably weaker
opponents.
"Il would Ik ,i verv big nnstaki to
look ahead to Tennessee when we
have to play USF." VanDerveer
said.
As for Tennessee, they don't
rebuild, they |ust reload. I lie top
ranked Lady Vols have already
made some noise in their quick 3-0
start, knocking off then-No 2
Louisiana lech 75-61 last Friday.
Superstar junior forward ( hamicjue
I loklsclaw led the way. pouring in 23
points and grabbing II rebounds.
Last season against Stanford.
Nygaard held Holdsclaw to just one
second half field goal, and the ( ardi
nal ran away with an X2-65 win. its
first-ever victory at I ennessee.
But while the Lady Vols mlcl
struggle through a 10-loss season,
they pulled together in the NCAA
tournament to win a fifth national
championship.
"Tennessee presents a whole dif
ferent problem than we've had."
VanDerveer said. "No team comes
close in terms ol athleticism and tal
ent. We will have to play an incredi
blv focused and good game."
