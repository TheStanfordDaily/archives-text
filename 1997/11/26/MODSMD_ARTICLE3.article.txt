Hill Hradley could have traded his
committee meetings and campaign
ing for golf clubs and a condominium
in Palm Springs when he retired
from the U.S. Senate in January.
Instead of slipping quietly into
private life, however, the prominent
Democrat has chosen to return to his
academic roots as this year's Payne
Distinguished Professor at Stan
lord's Institute for International
Studies.
In a dark wool suit and red pat
terned tie. Hradley said his Stanford
appointment and other post-Senate
activities are allowing him to study
ihe things he could not squeeze into
a legislator's 14-hour day.
"I said when I left that I was leav
ing the Senate, hut not public life.

and going out to do some things that
I felt were in the public interest,"
Bradley said.
Few in the American politics can
claim the bipartisan admiration
Hradley enjoys. During his IK years
in the Senate, his thoughtfulnessand
tenacity earned Hradley a reputation
as a natural leader, said George
Shultz, Secretary of State under
President Reagan and Distinguished
Fellow at the Hoover Institution.
"When 1 was Secretary of State,
he was outstanding to work with he
cause he would go out to important
places and poke around and read
and learn," Shultz said. "He's a very
intelligent, decent, interesting per
son.
"I'd he glad to have KM) Hill
Bradlcvs in the Senate.. .as long as
most ol them were Republican."

Congresswonian Anna I-shoo, a
Democrat whose district includes
Stanford, said her new constituent
distinguished himself by acting on
solid thinking.
"He has a legislative patience,
being deeply thoughtful in order to
craft legislation that will actually
move," Eshoo said. "He also has a
sense of humility and a wonderful
sense of humor."
Bradley's 6-foot-5 frame is as im
posing as his resume. He graduated
from Princeton University and stud
ied politics, economics and philoso
phy at Oxford University as a
Rhodes Scholar. Nicknamed "Dol
lar Bill," his agility on the basketball
court earned him an Olympic gold
medal, two NBA championships as a
New York Knick and a spot in the
Basketball I hill of Fame.
Soon after his basketball days
ended, Bradley ran for the U.S. Sen
ate and served three terms for New
Jersey, tackling an array of issues in
cluding helping to push through sig
nificant tax reforms in and re
turning the Black Hills of South
Dakota to the Sioux tribe.
Bradley has ;ilso written three
books —a chronicle of his life in bas
ketball. a handbook on tax policy
and his memoirs. Reflecting on his
larger-than-life accomplishments,
the 54-year-old only smiled, nodded
and said, "Life's been good."
In addition to his year-long pres
ence at Stanford, Bradley is a schol
ar at the University of Maryland, a
senior advisor to the financial con
sulting firm J.P. Morgan, and a
board member of several nonprofit
organizations.
Bradley is also dabbling in televi
sion, doing a series on A&E's "Biog
raphy," weekly commentary on
CBS News, and even Sports Center
commercials on ESPN. Is this recent
spate of highly visible appearances
leading up to a presidential run?
"There is always speculation of
Sen. Bradley as a candidate just be
cause he is regarded as one of the
leading lights in Washington." said

John Cogan, former deputy director
of the federal ()t lice of Management
and lkidget and Senior Fellow at the
Hoover Institution. "I suspect there
will be a significant effort to draft
him by moderate Democrats."
In his memoirs Bradley described
his decision to pass on a ripe opportu
nity to run as a Democratic presiden
tial candidate in 1991, doubting his
ability to "rouse people as a speaker"
and weighing the impact of the in
evitable publicity on his family. But in
an interview last week, he didn't deny
the possibility of running in 2(XX).
"I haven't ruled it out, but that's
not where my energies are flowing
right now," he said.
Bradley recognizes the power
and responsibility the executive
branch has in setting the national
agenda, crediting President Reagan
for supporting tax reforms in 1956
and blaming President Clinton for
rolling back that progress.
"I think President Clinton likes
loopholes because it allows him to
spread sugar over a broader area,"
Bradley said. "You will not get tax
reform until you have a president
who puts it on the agenda."
He voiced equally blunt opinions
supporting affirmative action, re
vamping campaign finance reform
and criticizing intrusive and sensa
tional media. But he said leveling in
come disparities between rich and
poor is the greatest challenge cur
rently facing the nation.

Although a relative newcomer to
the Information Age (he admits he
wrote his memoirs in pencil),
Bradley said the employee-owned
management structure of many high
teehnologv companies may be a
model for greater economic balance.
"Workers in companies in Silicon
Valley are owners through stock op
tions. . .and it should have wider ap
plication." he said. "It's a great way
to give people a stake in the outcome
of their work."
Aside from scholarly discus
sions. Bradley enjoys watching
movies and insists on using the Stair
Master several times a week. He
shares an interest in reading with his
wife Ernestine, a literature profes
sor at Montclair State College in
New Jersey.
Luring Bradley to Stanford was
easy since he has been involved in
policy committees with the Institute
for International Studies over the
past 10 years, according to William
Falcon, the institute's director.
"He knew us and we knew him
and it was a discussion of timing,"
Falcon said. "He brings the Wash
ington experience, but also the expe
rience of a scholar."
As the Payne Professor, Bradley
will give five public lectures this
school year. His first lecture,
"Thoughts for a New Century —
America's Role in the World." is
scheduled for Dec. 4 at 5 p.m. in
Kresee Auditorium.
