WATER POLO
■ MPSF TOURNAMENT: Friday
through Sunday at Belmont Plaza in
Long Beach, Calif. No. 3 Stanford
opens play Friday morning at 10:30
a.m. vs. UC-Irvine

The Cardinal (17-6, 6-2 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
kicks off the final stretch of its sea
son Friday at the MPSF tourna
ment in Long Beach. Calif.
Eight squads will compete,
including No. 1 Pepperdine and
No. 2 California. The winner of the
tournament receives an automatic
bid to the NCAA Championships
Dec. 5 in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.
An at-large hid will also be

awarded to one of the remaining
MPSF squads.
" This is kind of do-or-die for
us," said Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti. "We're in the
same position as everyone else in
our conference Your record is
clean. Everyone starts the same."
The third-seeded Cardinal is
scheduled to begin tournament
play at 10:30 a.m. Friday against
sixth-seeded UC-lrvine (3-5
MPSF).
The Cardinal last faced the
Anteaters in a Northern California
Tournament match at deGuerre
Pool Oct. IS.
In that match. Stanford battled
back from a four-goal deficit with
2:40 to play in regulation to score a
9-8 sudden-death victory. Cardinal
junior holeman David Hay tied the
game at 8-8 with 14 seconds
remaining, and junior defenseman
Layne Beaubien netted the win
ning goal in triple overtime after
neither team scored in two extra

periods.
"I'm sure they're going to be out
for a little redemption," Dettaman
ti said. "It was the turning point of
their season in a downward direc
tion and the turning point of our
season in an upward direction."
The winner of Friday's match
will almost certainly challenge sec
ond-seeded Cal Saturday at I p.m.
Cal leads the season series
against Stanford 2-0.
The two squads met Saturday in
the Big Splash at deGuerre Pool.
Using an insurmountable press
defense, the Bears defeated the
Cardinal. 7-6.
With the victory, then-No. 3 Cal
surpassed Stanford in the national
rankings. II the two squads meet
again at the MPSF tournament,
redemption will be the theme for
the Cardinal.
"It's a matter of all being on the
same page and having team chem
istry." Beaubien said. "I think we
have a pretty good chance."
