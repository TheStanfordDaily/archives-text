### Alex Scherbakovsky Staff writer 
Addressing a crowd ol political
scicncc scholars through an inter
preter yesterday at Hoover Institu
tion. former Deputy Prime Minister
of Hungary Imre Po/.sgay spoke
about the country's peaceful transi
tion to democracy.
Pozsgay held his position through
the last years of communist rule in

I hmgary and caused controversy this
summer bv donating to the Hoover
Institution a collection of documents
thought in I lungary to contain state
secrets.
Pozsgay stressed that Hungary
played a historic role in the East Eu
ropean transition process by being
the first country to switch from com
munism to democracy in a peaceful
manner. This transition was aided by
other democratic countries.

"The West supported Hungary
throughout this process through eco
nomic means." Pozsgav added.
Three opposition movements
helped end the era of communism in
I lungary, Pozsgay said.
ITie first group was formed after
the I%K intervention in Czechoslo
vakia when Russian tanks rolled
though that country to symbolize
Russia's continued control of East
ern Europe.
Although the Hungarian regime
attempted to destroy this opposition
group, their efforts failed because the
group established communication
channels throughout Hungary by
publishing newspapers, Pozsgay said.
The second group, known as Peo
ple's Movement, also managed to
keep its influence throughout the
decades of communist rule, Pozsgay
added.
Established inside the ruling
Communist parly, the third opposi
tion group was born after the 1956
revolution and joined the first two
groups in preparing themselves for
the change of system.
"Without collaboration of these
three groups, the peaceful character
of the Hungarian transition could
not be guaranteed,'' said Pozsgav.
The opposition's greatest fear

was the potential retaliation of the
Soviet Union.
Pozsgay added Hungarians had
numerous negative experiences with
the Soviet I Jnion and had yet to ac
cumulate any experience related to
the new side of the more liberal Sovi
et I Jnion.
"When I met with global leaders
such as President Bush, Margaret
Thatcher and the Pope, the number
one advice they gave me was to be
cautious and watch out," Pozsgay
said.
The opposition's lirsl move was
to publicly redefine the 1956 revolu
tion as an act of Soviet oppression,
thereby attacking the legitimacy of
the interference of Soviet troops and
undermining the character of the rul
ing Hungarian Socialist Workers
Party.
The ruling party derived power
from claiming they saved I lungary
from a counter-revolution and have
since ruled for 33 years based on that
lie, said Pozsgay.
"On January 20, 19K9, I an
nounced over the radio that our life

was built on a lie," said Pozsgay.
This announcement spurred the
establishment of numerous reform
groups inside the ruling party and ;i
mass denunciation ol communism
by the masses, he added.
The opposition viewed Soviet
I Jnion's inaction as an encouraging
sign which led the Hungarian Social
ist Workers Party to recognize the le
gitimacy of a multi-party system.
At this point, the opposition
groups joined in an "opposition
roundtable" and started negotia
tions with the ruling party.
"The main locus of the negotia
tions was revising the constitution to
establish a democratic state gov
erned by institutions created by com
petition of parties," said Pozsgay.
As a result of these negotiations,
Hungary became a free republic on
()ct. 23. IWW and prepared itself for
free elections which were held in
March 1 WO.
The l l M) elections propelled the
opposition parties into power, mark
ing the success of the transition
process.
