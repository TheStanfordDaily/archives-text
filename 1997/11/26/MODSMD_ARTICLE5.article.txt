Il took months ol negotiations and wran
gling. hut the ASSI has done it the much
anticipated course guide will he available to
students this vviiitei over the World Wide
Wch.
1 he new guide is a pilot lor the more lullv
leatured version that will he published in
spring. It will not cover as many courses as the
spring guide, which aims to contain evalua
tions of ever\ course taught in the School of
1 lumanitics and Sciences.
"I he pilot version.. .will have two num
bers available the instructor rating and the
overall course rating." said sophomore Malt
Spence. ASSl 1 senate deputy chaii and direc
tor of the course guide project. "It's more ol a
taste ol what's to conic."
I hese numbers will be compiled from sin
dent class evaluations filled out at the end ol
the quarter. I lie ASSI has no plans in the
neai filluiv to inelude courses taught in the
School ol I ugineering or the School ol I arth
Sciences in the course guide, according lo
Spence. These schools already publish course
guides, though they are not as comprehensive
as the ASSI Ps endeavoi
()ne obstacle the guide faces is the lack ol
data. "1 he success ol ihe ( ourse (iuide dc
peiuls on accurate and complete information
from the course evaluations," Spence said
I Infortunately. students often lail to till out
enough evaluations to make data statistically
meaningful or otherwise put little effort inlo
filling out the forms. II students do nol lui n in
more complete forms, many courses will sim
ply not be listed in future versions ol the guide.
"In Ihe past, students didn't have many in
centives lo take these evaluations seriously,"
Spence said With Ihis ycai's course guide,
the ASSI is hoping to change that

lo address the problem of data quality.
John Shown, clean ol humanities and sei
ences. joined the ASSU in urging lacult\ to
allot students enough time to till out evalua
tions and students to take the them scriousb
"'I am exeited about this partnership with
the ASSI l to ensure effective and responsible
teaching evaluations to benefit both students
and faculty," Shoven said in a joint statement
with Spencc.
Both Shoven and Spencc cautioned that
the course guide is an additional tool available
to students in choosing which courses to take.
It should supplement and not replace the ex
isting ad\ ising system, the) s;iid.
"You need to look at these numbers in con
text." Spencc said.
Spencc said he expects the guide to be most
useful for students trying to choose which
electives to pick within their major.
In addition to quantitative data, the guide
will contain statements b\ students about the
course, also culled from the evaluations.
I he guide will also list the books required
for each course along with the bookstore's
prices.
Iluce weeks ago the l acultv Senate voted
to let the deans of each ol the University's
schools release quantitative data from course
evaluations, though the vote was nearly
unanimous, a few professors expressed con
cern that a guide could hurt professors in In
lure hiring and could add pressure to those
seeking tenure.
Since then, the ASSI) lias scrambled to
work out details about the guide's format with
the Registrar's Office and Shoven's Office.
I he ASSI 1 lias also hired people to produce
the guide.
Ihough the ASSl 1 has tried since the
I %()'s lo gain access to quantitative data lor a


Sboven
course guide, this is the first time the
Faculty Senate lias approved their
request.
Currently. Ibrms include a small
tear-off portion which asks students
to give advice to their peers. Until
now, none of the quantitative data,
in which students rate their profes
sors on a numerical scale, was avail
able to the ASSI J.
"We just addressed their con
cerns that the course guide would be
used accurately and responsibly,"
Spence said. "This year, the ASSU
has been working with the faculty
and administration, instead (if
against them."
