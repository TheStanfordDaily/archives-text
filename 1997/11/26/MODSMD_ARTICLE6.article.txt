"Muslim women.. .can articu

science." Moosa said. "More than a
hundred years ago, such a thought
in itself would have been taboo."
Despite mentioning a large num
ber of abstract problems associated
with this re-thinking, however,
Moosa gave few concrete solutions
to the dilemma of stagnant thinking.
In his classes. Moosa said he has
tried to incorporate views from both
American Muslims as well as in
ternational Muslims in order that

his students have a more compre
hensive understanding of the com
plexities of the religion.
President of the Islamic Society
of Stanford University Imran
Maskatia. a eoterminal student in
computer science, said Moosa's
presence on campus for the past two
months has been the source of much
inspiration for Muslim students.
"Moosa addressed many ques
tions that haven't been addressed
before; he questions beliefs that
have been accepted for the past
2.(XX) years," Maskatia said. "He's
been a focal point for students, serv
ing as a dean of religious life and a
mentor for Muslims on campus."
Moosa, who is leaving Stanford
at the end of the quarter, said his
time at Stanford "has been a won
derful experience."
