URBAN STUDIES 191 A. COMMUNITY ORGANIZING
Taught by Nadinne Cruz, Associate Director, Haas Center for Public Service
Thursdays, 6:30 • 9:OOPM, 4 units
This service-learning course introduces approaches and strategies used by urban-based
community groups to address social, economic and political issues they face through activities
they call "community organizing" or "organizing." Seminar guests will include organizers, who
will help to teach us by sharing stories of their work in a variety of community organizing
groups. Readings and films provide background for understanding current issues, debates,
and challenges related to organizing. Integral to the coursework will be individual service work
culminating in a group project that serves as a tangible "gift" back to organizers and to a
distinctive tradition called "organizing." Seminars include both traditional academic expecta
tions as well as experiential learning approaches and activities to develop a community of
learners both with the class and with guest organizers.
