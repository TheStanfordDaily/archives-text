Graduate Fellowships
FOR 1998-1999
The John D. and Catherine T. Mac Arthur Foundation has awarded funds to
Stanford's Center for International Security and Arms Control to support an
ongoing program of international peace and cooperation for Ph.D. candidates
for the 1998-99 year. The purpose of the Consortium is to encourage
interdisciplinary research and training for doctoral candidates working on issues
relating to one of the following dimensions of world society on the eve of the
twenty-first century:
• war and institutions of violence, including ethnic and
regional conflict and cooperation in an international context
• globalization-economic, hut also political or cultural
• society and the ecosphere
• identity and social power
(Historical work that can illuminate these dimensions is eligible for funding.)
Doctoral candidates from all schools/departments at Stanford are eligible to apply,
including, for example, anthropology, economics, education, engineering, history,
law, political science, psychology, and sociology.
