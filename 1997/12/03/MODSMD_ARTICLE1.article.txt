## Fac Sen to vote tomorrow on forming oversight committee 
### Nadia Elghobashi Daniel Wolk Staff writers 
I or the first time in nearly 10 years, the Faeulty Sen
ate will decide tomorrow whether to initiate a revamped
evaluation system for the training of teaching assistants.
I he legislation, if approved, would establish a central
I Jniversity committee to oversee departmental training
programs ol I As.
I'he committee hopes to improve I A teaching quali
ty by insuring both consistency in I A training among
various departments and improved specialized training
within specific departments.
The committee would be composed of the vice
provost lor undergraduate education, the associate dean
for graduate policy, four faculty members appointed by
the senate and two graduate students and two under
graduates appointed by the ASSU Nominations Com
mission. A representative from the ('enter for Teaching
and Learning will also sit on the committee.
I he legislation authorizes the committee to conduct
periodic reviews and to sanction departments with sub
standard programs. However, according to Religious
Studies Prof. 11 ester (ielber, the chair ol the ( ominittee
on Academic Appraisal and Achievement, many details
still need to be worked out. including how often reviews
w ill be made, what typeol training programs will be used
and how the committee will reprimand or reward certain
departments.
" I here are so many 'its' here," said (ielber. " There
are lots of things to be worked out."
Reviews of I A training programs were last complet
ed in I9KN At that time the senate mandated mandato
ry departmental reviews every four years.
I lowever, no central committee existed. I his lack of
oversight led to differing departmental programs with
some departments even choosing not to institute train
ing programs. Financial problems (.luring the early l ( >9()s
led to administrative restructuring, which postponed
any departmental oi central review process indefinitely.
