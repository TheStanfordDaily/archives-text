# TA training scrutinized
## Fac Sen to vote tomorrow on forming oversight committee 
### Nadia Elghobashi Daniel Wolk Staff writers 
I or the first time in nearly 10 years, the Faeulty Sen
ate will decide tomorrow whether to initiate a revamped
evaluation system for the training of teaching assistants.
I he legislation, if approved, would establish a central
I Jniversity committee to oversee departmental training
programs ol I As.
I'he committee hopes to improve I A teaching quali
ty by insuring both consistency in I A training among
various departments and improved specialized training
within specific departments.
The committee would be composed of the vice
provost lor undergraduate education, the associate dean
for graduate policy, four faculty members appointed by
the senate and two graduate students and two under
graduates appointed by the ASSU Nominations Com
mission. A representative from the ('enter for Teaching
and Learning will also sit on the committee.
I he legislation authorizes the committee to conduct
periodic reviews and to sanction departments with sub
standard programs. However, according to Religious
Studies Prof. 11 ester (ielber, the chair ol the ( ominittee
on Academic Appraisal and Achievement, many details
still need to be worked out. including how often reviews
w ill be made, what typeol training programs will be used
and how the committee will reprimand or reward certain
departments.
" I here are so many 'its' here," said (ielber. " There
are lots of things to be worked out."
Reviews of I A training programs were last complet
ed in I9KN At that time the senate mandated mandato
ry departmental reviews every four years.
I lowever, no central committee existed. I his lack of
oversight led to differing departmental programs with
some departments even choosing not to institute train
ing programs. Financial problems (.luring the early l ( >9()s
led to administrative restructuring, which postponed
any departmental oi central review process indefinitely.
"They were contending with ex
traordinary problems," said Gelber.
"Other things had to take priority."
Six years later, the ASSU, led hv
then-Graduate Senator Doug Na
telson, a doctoral student in physics,
urged the faculty senate to look into
bringing back the regular depart
mental reviews.
"It was proper to call attention to
the problem," said Gelber. "It was
timely and well put."
Natelson said he and other sena
tors asked a subcommittee of C
AAA to give a comprehensive re
port on the status of TA training
programs.
"C-AAA was busy, but it eventu
ally got to [the matter]," Natelson
said. "In April of 19%, C-AAA con
vened and decided |the issue] was
important." The subcommittee's

findings and recommendations are
the subject of tomorrow's senate
meeting.
Psychology Prof. Russell Fer
nald. the chair of the subcommittee,
said the subcommittee found a
tremendous amount of variation in
the training programs of different
departments.
According to Gelber, a well-or
ganized, central committee, in con
junction with the Center for Teach
ing and Learning, would be needed
to provide stability and an effective
evaluation system.
"The old system hasn't worked
very well," said Gelber. "Actually
having a committee should create a
point of accountability."
"The committee is a novel idea."
said Fernald. "I'm looking forward
to what the faculty senate has to
say."
The purpose of having routine
appraisals within departments is to
keep practices consistent from de

partment to department. Natelson
said.
"There are many inconsistencies.
For instance: Are TAs required to
teach? Are they required to be
trained before they teach? Natel
son said. "In the Physics Depart
ment. Ibr example, we must teach in
order to receive our degree.
According to Fernald. the pur
pose of TA training is twofold. The
first aspect of training is to review
the basic responsibilities of teaching
and I Jniversity-widc policies such as
the Honor C "ode. I he second aspect
of training is of a more specialized,
dealing with methods of teaching
specific to each discipline.
Natelson is relieved that the sen
ate is finally addressing the issue.
"People get busy and things tend
to fall by the wayside." said Natel
son. "I'd like to see a mechanism put
in place to check what works so we
can hopefully improve the average
quality of TAs."
