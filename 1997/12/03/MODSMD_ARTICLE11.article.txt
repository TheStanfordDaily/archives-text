Starhuck's coffee and extended
dinnei hours during 112 inals week are
the latest efforts to improve dining
halls operated by Stanford Housing
and I )ining Serv ices.
Hie affiliation with Starhuck's
continues a Dining Services trend
toward brand name products. Cur
rently. ;ill University-operated din
ing halls offer ( oca-C ola beverages,
Noah's bagels. Dreyer's frozen yo
gurt, Minute Maid juices, Haagen-
D.i/s ice cream, and several other
brand-name items.
Shirley I verett, associate direc
tor ol I lousing and Dining, said affil
iations with retailers such as Star
buck's have been formed to increase
the vfiriety and quality of Dining
Services' items.
I he decision to add more brand

names is part of our ongoing effort
to increase the quality of products
served across campus in a consistent
manner," Everett said. "We will
continue to offer more branded
items that are within our budgeted
food cost."
Student response to a greater
array of commercial items has been
mostly positive. Sophomore Jason
Tester said the addition of Star
buck's and other brand names adds
excitement to somewhat boring
meals.
"Brand-name items give us a
taste of the real world." Tester said.
Freshman Justin Wayne said that
brand-name products are welcome
additions, especially in dining halls
with only average food quality.
"In dining halls that are not so
nice, it's good to have something de
cent to eat, even at a slightly in

creased cost,"he said. "With brand
name items available, students don't
have to travel into the city to get the
food they are used to."
Some students, however, feel
that Dining Services should concen
trate more on eliminating costs
rather than commercialization.
Sophomore Mike Liu said he is
against the addition of more brand
names because the cost of food is al
ready high enough.
"As Dining Services continues to
add more commercial products, stu
dents likely will be forced to pay
higher meal prices," Liu said. "We
pay too much for food as it is."
Everett said that future brand
name additions are being reviewed,
especially for Late Night offerings at
Stern and Florence Moore Halls.
Also, to help students during fi
nals week. Dining Services plans to

extend the dinner meal periods in all
dining halls an additional 15 minutes.
Wilbur Hall has extended hours
even longer to provide students with
more flexible eating schedules, stay
ing open until 7:30 p.m.
"Our goal is to continue to en
hance our students' dining experi
ence and to support their academic
mission." said Everett. "Extending
dining hours reflects students' needs
during this busy time of the quar
ter."
Many students are pleased at the
extended hours. Tester said that the
new hours show concern for the re
alities of students' schedules.
"It's really great for Dining Ser
vices to understand that our sched
ules can be hectic," he said. "Some
times, we just can't eat during the as
signed periods. The time extensions
are a huge help."
