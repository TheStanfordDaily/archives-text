# Reno refuses investigation
## Independent counsel to look into fundraising calls declined 
### 
WASHINGTON (/\I ®) — Attorney General Janet Reno
declined yesterday to seek an independent counsel investigation
of telephone fund raising by President Clinton and Vice President
Al (iore. saying their actions were outside the scope of federal
election law.
Under strong pressures for months from all sides. Reno said.
"The decision was mine and it was based on the facts and the law.
not pressure, politics or any other factor."
Republicans criticized her decision as wrong and perhaps
affected by loyalty to the White House. Democrats called it cor
rect and courageous.
She also rejected a special prosecutor to investigate former
Energy Secretary lla/el O'Leary. concluding that O'L.eary was
unaware that a contribution to one of her favorite charities may
have been solicited in return for her meeting Chinese business
men.
In her explanation. Reno said Clinton's fund-raising calls in
October IW4 were made from the White House private quarters,
not the president's offices. "This places the calls outside the scope
... of (federal election law) which applies only to solicitations for
hard-money contributions occurring within the federal work
place," she wrote.
Reno told a news conference that her campaign finance task

force continues to investigate Democratic fund-raising practices
that without (lore's knowledge — diverted some of the money
he raised into questionable accounts. And she said the department
would continue investigating others involved in the ()'Lear\ inci
dent.
Rejecting a dissent from FBI Director l.ouis I. Freeh. Reno
went right to the deadline before making her long-expected deci
sions. "He and I ma\ not always agree, but the decision is mine."
Reno said.
Republicans, who had predicted Reno's refusal, denounced her
as viewing the campaign finance affair and the law too narrowly.
Rep. Dan Burton, R Ind.. who chairs a I louse committee investi
gating campaign funding, said he would call Reno and Freeh to a
hearing yesterday.
Senate (JOB leader I rent Lott called Reno's decision a
tragedy. Sen. John (ilenn. D-Ohio. said she had acted coura
geously despite "tremendous political pressure" from Republi
cans.
l hc telephone fund-raising inquiry was pushed into the spot
light by demands from Republicans on Capitol Mill, newspaper
disclosures and the timetables set by the independent counsel law.
It led to questioning of ('linton and (iore by Justice Department
lawyers and FBI agents.
