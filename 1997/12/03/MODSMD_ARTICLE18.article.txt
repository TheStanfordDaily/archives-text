New course guide's success
dependent on thorough
completion of evaluations

time this week to thoroughly complete
course c\aluation forms.

However, with the release of quantita

rely less on word-of-mouth recommenda

We ask that professors and teaching
assistants allow students ample time to
complete the forms and we ask that stu

data can be compiled provided there is both
a high rate of participation and a good faith
effort on the part of students to candidly
and maturely express their views.
The recent actions taken by the faculty
and administration have demonstrated
their willingness to uphold the spirit of the
I lonor Code and Fundamental Standard by
treating us as responsible, reflective individ
uals. let us use the surveys this week not
only to provide professors and fellow stu
dents with feedback on courses, but also to
show the administration that we have been
worthy of such responsibility all along.
