## The 						Dead Week lie 
### 
Dead Week assignments
hinder students from
foeusini* on final exams

Till CONC'I ri or a Dead Week at
Stanford *s absolute hypocrisy. Any
student, by this time, has realized
that while the week preceding final exams
,ii Stanford has historically been called
Dead Week." in actuality there is nothing
dead about it.
Officially, the University calls Dead
Week the"I nd-Quarter" period and
deems ll a period of "reduced social and
extracurricular activity" with the stated
intent of allowing students to "concentrate
on academic work and to prepare for final
examinations."
I he I nd-Ouarter Policy Statement pro
hibits giving graded homework, mandato
rs quizzes or examinations during the
weekend and lour class days preceding
linals. But then these prohibitions are fol
lowed In a lengths list of exceptions that
allow .111 instructor to give work during
I )ead Week
I hese exceptions include, but are not lim

ilctl to. routine homework and quizzes, lab
exams or papers and projects m which "rea
sonable notice" has been given. It is a rare
student who actually does not have work to
turn in during I nd-Ouartcr period and who
can truly concentrate on preparing for finals.
I Jnlike others schools, like I'( -Berkeley,
where Dead Week signals an end to classes.
Stanford's Dead Week basically allows for
classes and assignments to continue as usual.
And as many are aware, some quarters allot
only one Dead Day. Thursday, before finals
begin on Friday.
Students need and want a period of
time in which classes are not held and
assignments are not due to prepare for
finals. With the extracurricular, social and
academic activities that most students par
ticipate in during quarter, a true dead
week would benefit our psyche and grades.
Clearly, a quarter system compresses
learning into a shorter time frame.
Nonetheless, allowing students more time
to prepare and review for exams would
increase student performance and informa
tion retention, while reducing some of the
stress of final exams.
Happy, healthy students who learn
more are definitely something worth killing
a week for.
