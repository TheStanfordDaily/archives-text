## Enduring the winter break blues 
### 
Happy dead
Week! (Or, to
my graduate stu
dent readers, I lappv 112 irst
Week of December!)
You see. in much the
same way that Canadians
don't typically celebrate
Thanksgiving, most doc-

toral students don't really observe Dead
Week. While most undergraduates (and to
some extent, masters students) are right
now in the midst of studying for finals or
writing term papers (and, by the way. put
down this newspaper and get back to
work!), it's business as usual for doctoral
students. The undergrads have their caf
feine-induced catatonia, late nights at the
library and primal screams, but most doc
toral students wouldn't even be aware of
Dead Week if it weren't for the marked
increases in undergrads attending their TA
office hours.
Hidden away in their laboratories and
offices, doctoral students don't have such
regular markers of the passage of time.
I Jndergrads have the biorhythmic highs and
lows of stress brought on by midterms and
finals; graduate students seem to have a
more constant level of stress.
Every day is just another regression to
run, every week is just another failed exper
iment. every month is just another pile of
interviews to transcribe, every year is just
another piece of our rapidly disappearing
youth irrevocably discarded in this crazy
quest for an advanced degree that we
thought would bring us insight and the
opportunity to seek truth, but that has
instead made lis bitter and jaded. I digress...
()f course, after Dead Week, both under
graduates and graduate students head home
for the winter holidays. For the most part,
undergrads see the completion of yet anoth
er set o! finals as the well-earned ticket to
winter break, which can be two or three fun
tilled weeks at home.

However, in the great cosmic balance ot
things, graduate students find winter break
to be two or three stress-filled weeks away
from campus.
In my case, first there's the guilt of
putting my research on hold. Alter negoti
ating with my adviser to take a break from
my research assistantship responsibilities, I
then have to negotiate with myself to put off
the dissertation work for a bit. 1 convince
myself that taking a vacation will not keep
me from graduating in June, but I still end
up bringing home a backpack lull of books
and articles to read in my "spare" time.
Then, there's the trip home. 1 hop on a
plane and face the next phase of the gaunt
let. The sweetest, most well-meaning and in
any other universe, kindest person I could
ever think of meeting sits next to me on the
plane. And utters those live, dreaded words:
"So. what do you do?
"I'm a graduate student at Stanford." I
say.
"What are you studying?" the kind
stranger asks.
"Education," I reply.
"What's your dissertation about?"
"My work falls in the area of the sociolo
gy of knowledge, which is. uh, well, it's..." I
pause, realizing mid-sentence that nothing 1
do probably makes sense to anyone outside
aeademia. I get a little depressed. "My dis
sertation is a study about..." and then I
stumble through my 30-second, Readers
Digest version of the thesis. It never ceases
to amaze me how I can so easily articulate
my dissertation at academic meetings or
with faculty and other students, but I can
barely complete a coherent sentence about
it when I'm talking to any "regular" folk.
"Oh. that's interesting. . ." the kind
stranger offers and smiles. Of course, 1
might as well have been speaking in Klingon
for the last two minutes, and still the per
son's response would be the same.
Once I make it home, it's time for the
next phase of the gauntlet. Because my fam
ily already lias heard descriptions of my dis

sertation, they ask those other five, dreaded
words: "Planning to finish up soon?" Putting
down my bags. 1 start, "Well, its sort ot
complicated. 1 have to rework my conceptu
al framework and..."and once again I
pause, realizing again that none of this
makes sense to anyone outside of academia
either. I get a bit more depressed.
In fact, 1 have one friend who is a lirst
generation college student, who not only
earned her undergraduate degree, but went
on to complete her doctorate at Stanford.
She once remarked that her family figured
she must be really stupid: why was it taking
her so much time to finish school when most
people in her community were in and out of
school in 12 years.
Then, there are the family get-togethers
around the holidays where once again I'm
asked by distant cousins about my disserta
tion. Once again I muddle through my
description, and once again they reply. "Oh,
that's interesting..." Later on, my cousin,
the engineering doctoral student, is called
on to fix the VCR. my brother the med stu
dent is asked for consultation on an assort
ment of sores and aches, and I'm asked to
suggest a good private school for my aunt's
friend's daughter who is moving to Abilene,
Texas. None of us succeed. Now I'm really
convinced none of what I do has any bearing
on anything outside of academia. I really get
depressed.
Winter break is over, and I'm back on the
plane heading to campus. My backpack full
of books and articles hasn't even been
opened, and although I've had a nice break.
I'm a little relieved to be getting back to
Stanford. As the plane taxis to the runway, 1
turn to the person next to me and ask, "So.
what do you do?
"I design rubberized moldings for high
tension machinery." replies the stranger.
"Oh. that's interesting..
