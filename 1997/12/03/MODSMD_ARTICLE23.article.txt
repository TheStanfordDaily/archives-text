Stanford mistreated
Pfefferbaum
As a postdoctoral fellow in the Depart
ment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sci
ences. I have seen first-hand the effects of
Stanford's sanctions on Dr. Adolf Pfeffer
baum. For 17 years Pfefferbaum has been a
tenured Stanford psychiatry professor
whose research lab (The Laboratory of
Physiological and Structural Brain Imaging)
was housed at the Palo Alto VA.

On disclosing to his colleagues and supe
riors at the Medical School the questionable
practices and incidences of harassment by
the then chief-of-staff at the VA and step
ping down as assistant dean at the VA. Pfef
ferbaum was told that on leaving his VA
position he also resigned from his Stanford
position. When Pfefferbaum argued that
this was not the case. Stanford dismissed
him.
Instead of being thankful that Stanford
had a professor who was willing to voice his
concerns about what he believed to be
unethical practices so as to maintain the

institution's integrity, Stanford "shot the
messenger." When this case was presented
to a Santa Clara Superior Court the judge
ruled against Stanford and ordered Pfeffer
baum reinstated, which Stanford has yet to
do. As a Stanford alum, having graduated
with an idyllic view of this institution. I find
it most difficult to see a world class
researcher and clinician being treated so
despicably as Stanford has treated Pfeffer
baum.

I have seen a lab. the research of which is
