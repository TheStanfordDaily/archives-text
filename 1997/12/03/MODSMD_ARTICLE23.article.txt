Stanford mistreated
Pfefferbaum
As a postdoctoral fellow in the Depart
ment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sci
ences. I have seen first-hand the effects of
Stanford's sanctions on Dr. Adolf Pfeffer
baum. For 17 years Pfefferbaum has been a
tenured Stanford psychiatry professor
whose research lab (The Laboratory of
Physiological and Structural Brain Imaging)
was housed at the Palo Alto VA.

On disclosing to his colleagues and supe
riors at the Medical School the questionable
practices and incidences of harassment by
the then chief-of-staff at the VA and step
ping down as assistant dean at the VA. Pfef
ferbaum was told that on leaving his VA
position he also resigned from his Stanford
position. When Pfefferbaum argued that
this was not the case. Stanford dismissed
him.
Instead of being thankful that Stanford
had a professor who was willing to voice his
concerns about what he believed to be
unethical practices so as to maintain the

institution's integrity, Stanford "shot the
messenger." When this case was presented
to a Santa Clara Superior Court the judge
ruled against Stanford and ordered Pfeffer
baum reinstated, which Stanford has yet to
do. As a Stanford alum, having graduated
with an idyllic view of this institution. I find
it most difficult to see a world class
researcher and clinician being treated so
despicably as Stanford has treated Pfeffer
baum.
Since my return to Stanford in Oct. 1994
I have seen a lab. the research of which is
international recognized, essentially dis
banded and the center that Pfefferbaum
held lost because of Stanford's actions.
These events have led me to view Stanford
in a different light.
I have become less proud of my academ
ic heritage and hesitant in my participation
and contributions to the University. I no
longer feel the affiliation I once did toward
this University, and that saddens me. What
bothers me the most about the Pfefferbaum
case is that even if the Advisory Board rules
as the judge did. that Pfefferbaum should be
reinstated to his previous position. Stanford
can never give Pfefferbaum back all that
they have taken away. And that's a crime
for which Stanford should be held account
able.

Solve parking woes
Perhaps you have noticed that parking is
a bit tight on West campus, around Gover
nor's Corner and Suites. Empty spots in the
Suites parking lot are harder to find than
empty spots in downtown Palo Alto. Much
distressed, we approached the Parking
Office with our concerns.
The helpful staff pointed out that resi
dents of Governor's Corner could use the
Stock Farm Road lot for overflow parking.

We appreciate this provision but have only
a few humble requests. Maybe the Univer
sity could fund an extension of the SURE
escort to ferry students between the Stock
Farm lot and the West residences because
it's quite a hike, and the path is badly lit and
usually deserted in the evenings.
()r as an alternative, the University could
allow students to trade in then West resi
dence parking permits for permits from the
C'itv of Menlo Park, so we could use the lots
in downtown Menlo Park, which are proba
blv closer than Stanford's overflow lots I he
possibilities are endless: we ;isk only that
the University pay attention to our creative
insights and try to remedy the situation.

Let the masses judge
I was amused to read in I lie Daily on
Nov. 2(y about the ASSI 1 course guides and
about the concerns of "a few professors"
who worried "that a guide could hurt pro
fessors in future hiring and could add pres
sure to those seeking tenure."
What exactly are thev saving'.' I hat those

who are evaluated poorly by students might
not advance as rapidly as those with excel
lent teaching skills'.' I lorrors.
In a similar vein, I would like to express
mv concern about transcripts, and grades in
general, which for years have had the poten
lial to hurt students in future hiring and add
pressure to those seeking a degree.

Rivalry gone awry
I come from one of those "patrician"
families that (iuv Hranum mentioneil in his
disgustingly disgraceful column. Both ol my
parents graduated from I J('-Herkeley in
1%8. My dad was known for running into a
burning building to save 14 people from the
fire and for getting arrested in the I ree
Speech Movement. A quote from Ihe
Daily Cal that he saved reads. "We are the
students who are for more than the football
games and the rah rah." I think that
Hranum could learn from this.
Hraunian's article was forwarded all over
campus last week, as was a reprint of Ihe
Daily ( als article about his humbling
encounter with the Secret Service. I wish to
respond to it. but first, allow me to say that I
believe that Berkeley is a great school, with
much to offer in the way ol rigorous aca
demies and opportunities for its students.
Stanford is a great school, offering chal

lenging courses. a diverse social background
and many opportunities for lis students.
Moth schools honor Ihe ideals of excel
lenee. integrity and the pursuit ol knowl
edge. I hose who know both Stanford and
Hcikcley students, know that not everyone
who attends Stanford, not even Ihe inajori
ty ol the students, is rolling in dough, and
that the majority of Uerkclcy students are
not dirt poor. Nor should it be considered a
particular student's fault that his 01 hei pat
cuts happen to be rich 01 pool I )ivcrsity is
important in education, and so Hranum is
right in this respect.
Hranum's statement about athletes. "We
give you privileges in exchange lot .1 service.
. first pick ol the ladies (01 gentlemen, as
the case may be), and the light to mock and
condescend to us" leaves no room for any
other interpretation but thai athletes, foot
ball players in particular, are dumb guys (01
girls, ;is the case may be), who take all the
best women and men. and are mocking and
condescending lo those who d< nil choose (o
partake 111 physical activity.
I like to think thai normal folks earn
their relationships, as opposed to finding
them 111 dating services like I I I I Hears
dales, and that while physical activity helps
one's own body, it also makes one more
able lo help another there is no bail
blood between couch potatoes and athletes.
Secondly, the negative portrayal ol ath
letes ;is hired lliugs disturbs me |iisl a little.
Athletics involves two sides, the physical
side ol the sport and the mental, including

sportsmanship, ethics.. I hat second side is
why we usually don't encountei black bells
