ences can be a cruel thing when put
into the hands of obsessive people like
myself. Two Sundays ago, I called my
freshman roommate and woke her up at
a.m. The time had come. Forget petty
things like seized goal posts. Dead Week
and finals.
It was time to find out my Draw results.
Laura woke up groggy and dutifully
wrote down my ID and PIN in a sleepy
stupor. She went down to the computer
cluster while 1 waited by the phone in
Hong Kong. Five minutes later, she called
back.
"Hello?" I answered, tripping over the
telephone cord.
Silence.
"Well, 1 think it's good," she said after
two seconds of hesitation.
My heart skipped a beat. They must
have put me in Wilbur.
"You got Kairos," she said, as numb
ness overcame me. Any relief 1 had from
not being placed among freshmen was
superseded by the uncomfortable realiza
tion that I actually was going back to Stan
ford. After some of my closest friends had

just graduated and after having spent a
quarter away from the Farm, I was return
ing. How odd.
I felt so distant from everything Cardi
nal — 1 still don't think I've absorbed the
fact that I have a year and a half of school
left. Not that 1 regret ii. After working
full-time at various jobs. I know 1 don't
want to do that for a living just yet. II 50
years of toil can be put off for another cou
ple of years, I'm going to take advantage
of it. Hut there was still something discom
forting about picturing myself biking past
Old I Jnion once again.
Among other reasons, this was part of
the motivation for coming to Hong Kong
in the first place. lime and youth are pre
cious and not meant to be wasted rotting
away in musty libraries or yellow-lit
offices. Since I bid my farewells to friends
and family in August, my lite has become
unwittingly. . . interesting. I've traveled
through six different countries in the
region (made financially possible by the
regional economic crisis) and met dozens
of interesting people.
I didn't arrive in Hong Kong without
mv doubts, though. I didn't know whether

I would be able to thrive in a foreign envi
ronment thousands of miles away from the
closest friend or family member. I knew
that the evcle ol daily life would continue
despite all the exciting events that could
happen. And the potential tediousness of
daily life experienced far away from
loved ones - frightened me. Going to
I hailand for two weeks didn't guarantee
that I wouldn't be sitting bored in my Hat
the following Tuesday.
I just wasn't so sure about all those
quiet nights where I had nothing to do
after all the laundry was done and the
newspaper had been read. I his quiet
space gave too much energy to memories
and left one vulnerable to homesickness.
Hul this, like other moments, soon passed.
Looking back, I realize that these were
moments that should be cherished. I'hese
were the times when I could do nothing
else but stop and think.
Now 1 have less than two weeks left
before I am scheduled to re-enter Amen
can air space. Affairs are falling into place
for my return to campus: housing has been
assigned and the loan application has been
sent. It is nearing the end of the vear, and

Christmas is just around the corner. Hut I
swear I was just cleaning the bathrooms in
Synergy yesterday. A week before that, I
was swinging .it the Viennese Ball and eat
ing persimmons ripe from a California
tree.
Maybe I've been abducted by those
darn aliens again. I hey always put me
back in the wrong time /one.
My life has been ambushed by time yet
again. And no matter how much I tr\ to
anticipate the siege to come. I'm always
caught off guard.
As I ponder my imminent return to
Stanford and the numbness begins to wear
off, I begin to dread the same fears. What
will I do with the inevitable quiet nights to
come. I'm going to miss Hong Kong. I'll
miss shoving people on the subway, get
ting Chinese food from portable kitchens
down the street and buying cold milk tea
with sago pearls at the little shop In the
train station. I'll miss elbowing past people
on Nathan Road, ga/ing at the skyline
view at Victoria Harbor alter dark and
watching the Asian-centered news media.
Hut most ol all. I II miss the food (and yes,
you olten have to light through crowds to

get to thai. too). I suppose that's what
traveling is all about: to see a place and
leave despite the little tug ai vout palate.
Bui I aura tugged it in\ heart sleeves
from the other end »>| the line.
"Hey, you'll be right down the street
from me." Ah, a comrade on the Row.
I hen I knew it would be possible to get
back into the swing ol things. Ilappx
reunions awaited me on niv return, and it
would be much cheapei to call m\ friends

tend t»i more substantive concerns. I 01

to graduate with a degree even though I'd
