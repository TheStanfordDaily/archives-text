# FINALS WEEK FACTOIDS
## 
### 
• Stress responses are caused by the sympa
thetic nervous system's release of hormones
like epinephrine. Although these responses
may increase alertness in the short term — usu
ally about an hour — sustained stress can lead
to fatigue, compromise the immune system and
cause disease.
• Some studies show that drinking caffeinated
beverages does not significantly alter numeri
cal reasoning, short-term memory or verbal flu
ency. In fact, it may even lead to slower reac
tion times.
• All-nighters may not be the best idea. Sleep
deprivation can reduce short-term memory and
cause confusion, headaches, instability and an
inability to concentrate. Going to bed would
probably get you a better grade on the next
morning final than staying up all night studying.
• Eating breakfast can help you ace morning fi
nals. One study found that elementary school ,
children who ate breakfast performed substan
tially better on morning tests of cognitive ability
than their hungry, un-breakfasted counterparts.
