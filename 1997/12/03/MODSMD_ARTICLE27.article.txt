# The 						common cold:
## Avoiding the wretched bane of winter 
### Rollin Hu Editorial staff 
Many people equate winter with ill
ness. Indeed, it does seem that colds and
flu most often strike during the cold winter
months. 1 lowever, contrary to what moth
ers around the world insist, the reason
people catch "colds" is not because they
get chilled while outside. Bundling up in
warm clothes will not be sufficient protec
tion In order to become ill. you need to be
infected with a virus no matter how lit
tie you wear, you are not going to catch a
cold il you are not exposed to a pathogen.
I lie common cold can be caused by a
wide variety of different viruses. I he most
common are the rhinoviruses. of which
there are more than lOOdifferent types
30 to 50 percent of all incidences of the
common cold can be attributed to one of
the rhinovirus serotypes.
I lie large number of different types of
viruses makes the common cold especially
difficult to combat. Viral diseases are in
herently difficult to fight, unlike bacterial
infections, which can be easily dealt with
by hitting the nasty things with antibiotics.
Vaccines are usually the preferred
weapons against viruses, but given the
large diversity of cold-causing viruses, dc
velopmcnt of a vaccine for the common
cold is unlikely to ever occur.
Studies indicate that people are more
likely to become ill during winter months
simply because everyone stays indoors to
gether, increasing the likelihood viruses
can be transmitted person to person. For
tunately. several precautions can be taken
to avoid being infected, even when indoor
classes and such gatherings provide per
fect opportunities for viruses to wreak
havoc.

An important precaution to take is to
wash your hands frequently II you touch a
contaminated surface, like a doorknob,
and then rub your eyes most likely you
will become infected. Viruses love dirty
hands. Most importantly, refrain from
touching your mucous membranes with
those dirty hands. That means avoiding
nose-picking as well as eve-1 tibbing.
A study done a couple ol years ago
showed that people who picked their
noses were far more likely to catch colds
when exposed to viruses than people who
didn't pick their noses. Viruses and othei
pathogens helplessly residing on \otii fin
gets would be more than happy to jump
into your nose and cause an infection il
given the chance.
Unfortunately, even Ihe most obses
sively clean hand washer will occasional
be exposed to a virus b\ being sneezed
upon, for example. In such eases, othei
methods must be taken to keep an expo
sure from developing into an infection
Several factors control the immune system
and determine the tisk of contracting a
cold once exposed to the virus One ol
them isexcrcisc. Moderate amounts ol ex
ercise can cause immune cells to circulate
more quickly and efficiently through the
both and enhance tlieii abilitx to kill
pathogens that mav be skulking about
I hough the effects wear oil in a couple ol
hours after exercising, a brisk jog or walk
can greatly decrease the chances ol con
trading illnesses in the long term.
Sometimes, exercise can even help the
body light diseases that have alreaih
taken hold. Doctors agree (hat moderate
exercise is generally beneficial il you have
symptoms ol a cold, but no level An ini

portant caveat, however is that more
is not better. Vigorous exercise can
exacerbate existing symptoms and
end up being more trouble than the
virus itself. In particular, if you have
the flu and you suffer from fever,
muscle aches and other related
symptoms, rest would probably be
the best prescription.
Maintaining a generally healthy
lifestyle can also decrease the
chances of falling ill. Eating a well
balanced diet gives your body suffi
cient amounts off the vitamins and
minerals that enhance immune
function. These are vitamin A, 86.
vitamin C and vitamin E. Some im
portant minerals that enhance im
mune function are iron, zinc, copper
and magnesium.
Avoiding stress can also en
hance immune performance.
Many of the neuropeptides pro
duced by the nervous system dur
ing times of stress are immuno
suppressive. Worrying about an
approaching final will not make
life better, especially if it makes
you sick.
Having a cold is definitely not
one of life's greatest pleasures. For
tunately, you can take steps to pre
vent colds from happening to you.
Have fun and stav healthv.
