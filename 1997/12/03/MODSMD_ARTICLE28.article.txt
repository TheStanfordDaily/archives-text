## Tracking Prof. Sapolsky around the globe 
### Michael Hope Contributing writer 
From the technical lexicon of neurobi
ology to Swahili. from the throes of mod
ern life to the primitive backwaters ol
Kenya, from the pages ol Science maga
zinc to those ol popular non-fiction. Biol
ogy Prof. Robert Sapolsky has ;i broad
and intriguing spectrum ol interests and
achievements.
Be it studying the effects ol a class ol
hormones called glucocorticoids that are
secreted during stressful events or study
ing the behavior patterns of baboons, the
central issue of Sapolsky s various re
search projects is the mechanisms under
lying behavior.
Childhood excursions to the New
Yot k Museum of Natural I listory. Sapol
skv recalled, fostered this desire to better
understand behavior and its biological
underpinnings. He remembered being
"blown away" by the enormous fossil ex
hibits and. more generally, with the inner
mvsteries of animal life.
I hough he maintained this interest in
animal behavior through college, pursu
ing a dual degree in biology and anthro
pology at Harvard. Sapolsky also had
time to pursue other, disparate interests.
In addition to devoting many hours to
music (the appealing dissonance ol Ives
or Bartok can still today be heard spilling
from the piano room near his office in
(iilbert). Sapolsky found time to brush

up on Ins Swaliili.

Prof. Robert Sapolsky feels right at home whether studying glucocorticoids in
Gilbert Hall or baboons in Kenya.
earn him the 1992 Young Investiga
tor of the Year Award by the Soci
ety for Neuroscience, Sapolsky is
the author of numerous popular
books and articles.
He is a regular contributor to
Discover magazine and The Sci
ences, where he also serves as a con
tributing editor. The subjects of his
articles range from the effects of
aging in rats to viral delivery sys
tems for genes to topics that seem to
have very little relevance to biolo
gy. For example, one recent article
addressed our cultural fascination
with the O.J. Simpson trial, anoth
er. our reactions to the Unibomber
case.
His books have also had consid
erable success, in particular, "Why
Zebras Don't Get Ulcers," which
was a Los Angeles Times Book
Prize Finalist in 1994. Part of the
reason "Zebras," which addresses
the logic of stress responses and
their manifestations in the modern
world is such a fascinating read is
Sapolsky's confident, humorous
and down-to-earth style. His chap
ter headings — "Stroke, Heart At

tacks, and Voodoo Death" or "Ul
cers, Colitis, and the Runs" — belie
the solid science on which the book
is grounded, but they do serve to
convey its entertaining and inge
niously presented content.
Because of his reputation in the
public realm. Sapolsky expressed
concern about becoming
"Saganized," a term he used to de
scribe a researcher who, because of
his public fame, fails to be taken se
riously by scientists. But. with the
consistent success of his research in
volving the role of glucocorticoids in
the death of brain cells and his re
cent advancements with gene deliv
ery strategies that potentially will
prolong the life spans of neurons,
these worries seem entirely un
founded.
As accomplished researcher,
renowned writer and popular pro
fessor (just try getting him as your
advisor), how does Sapolsky have
time for it all? Well, sometimes by
getting up at 4 a.m. to catch the Cal-
Train to Palo Alto from his home in
San Francisco, by working tirelessly,
by a mix of inspiration and dedica
tion and, when it seems he's almost
caught his breath, by lighting out for
East Africa.
