## Tracking Prof. Sapolsky around the globe 
### Michael Hope Contributing writer 
From the technical lexicon of neurobi
ology to Swahili. from the throes of mod
ern life to the primitive backwaters ol
Kenya, from the pages ol Science maga
zinc to those ol popular non-fiction. Biol
ogy Prof. Robert Sapolsky has ;i broad
and intriguing spectrum ol interests and
achievements.
Be it studying the effects ol a class ol
hormones called glucocorticoids that are
secreted during stressful events or study
ing the behavior patterns of baboons, the
central issue of Sapolsky s various re
search projects is the mechanisms under
lying behavior.
Childhood excursions to the New
Yot k Museum of Natural I listory. Sapol
skv recalled, fostered this desire to better
understand behavior and its biological
underpinnings. He remembered being
"blown away" by the enormous fossil ex
hibits and. more generally, with the inner
mvsteries of animal life.
I hough he maintained this interest in
animal behavior through college, pursu
ing a dual degree in biology and anthro
pology at Harvard. Sapolsky also had
time to pursue other, disparate interests.
In addition to devoting many hours to
music (the appealing dissonance ol Ives
or Bartok can still today be heard spilling
from the piano room near his office in
(iilbert). Sapolsky found time to brush

up on Ins Swaliili.
Yes. Swaliili. Al the "hip and progres

New York. Swaliili was lauglit along with

Prof. Robert Sapolsky feels right at home whether studying glucocorticoids in
Gilbert Hall or baboons in Kenya.
