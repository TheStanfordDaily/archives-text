There may not he much that
you can do to determine il voui
seafood from a reputable restaurant is taint
ed or not. We would hopefullv assume that

getting Iresh ;md sale seafood would he .111
inherent part of going to a rc i lam ant. When
in doubt, don't be afraid to isk the server.
Ask them when it arrived at Ihi k taurant
Where did it come from? Is the seafood
chowder made with crab meat that was
caught oil ol the coast ol Washin ton tins
morniiii'. 01 docs it contain lobstei meat
that was flown across the country Irom
Maine? Have the\ tried the dish toda\ '
I lovs fresh is it?
Also, ask the server loi a recommend.l
lion Do they recommend that particulai
seafood dish or would thev steer vou toward
the ( hinese chicken salad instead ' I laving
waited tables mysell some time ago, you can
usually be confident that the server will
point vou in the right direction, especially
when they would like you to return to that
particular restaurant (and leave a generous
tip). It they tr \ to lead you awa\ from Ihe
seafood, then maybe you should take heed.
