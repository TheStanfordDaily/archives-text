# Research group to end exclusion
## The 						Center for Integrated Systems may admit two Japanese companies 
### T.J. Babbitt Contributing writer 
A prominent Stanford research institute
recently ended its decade old practice of e\
eluding Asian companies ;is research paitncrs
and funding sources.
I he ( entei for Integrated S\stems. a semi
conductor research institute in the Depart
ment of 1 ngineering, recentl\ began ncgoliat
ing the possible admission ol two Japanese
companies into its ranks, ending an unwritten
and much criticized policy of excluding
Asian companies in ordei to safeguard Ainei
ican competitive advantage.
Dean of the School ol I ngineering John

Ilennessy gave two explanations lor the old
polic\: the desire ol the Silicon Vallev compa
nies that fund much ol the center \ research to
shield new seiniconductot developments I'rorn
Asian competitors and pressure from the De
partment ol Defense, also a inajoi funder of
the center's research, to exclude Japanese
companies loi reasons relating to national se
curity and industrial policy.
But the old practice caused controversy
among faculty.
" I he hasic question is: are we a proprietary
research group or are we a university?" asked
Assoc. I lectiical lini>inecrini> I'rol. Hruce
Lusignan. who last year circulated a
petition that was sharply critical of
the University's business arrange
ments in general and of CIS in par
ticular. The petition garnered 69 fac
ulty signatures.
On the other side of the issue is
Hennessy, who defends the old poli
cy as "inevitable" while at the same
time saying that he is much more
comfortable with the new policy.
"In the 1980s, U.S. firms were
concerned that the U.S. semicon
ductor industry was going to be
wiped out" by Asian competitors,
Hennessy said. If that happened, he
continued, the Department of De
fense feared that it might not have
full access to a technology that it
considered vital to military technol
ogy systems.
At the founding of the center in
1983, many saw its primary purpose
as safeguarding an imperiled do
mestic semiconductor industry from
Japanese competition. The new cen
ter was seen as part of a 11 .S. effort to
develop an "industrial policy" based
on government support for select in
dustries of the sort that at the time
seemed to be working so well for
Japan. The U.S. semiconductor in
dustry appeared to be floundering
when confronted with the "Asian
model" of doing business.
According to former center di
rector Rick Reis, "15 years ago CIS
was focused on U.S. competitive
ness."
Hut Lusignan said that Stanford
had no right to make these sorts of
political decisions about industrial
competitiveness. "It would seem to
indicate that Stanford was trying to
wage a trade war against Japan," he
said. He said the position was ironic
given the large number of Asian
graduate students who work in the
Engineering School
Hennessy has a more limited per
ception of the meaning of the exclu
sion. "It was viewed as an unfortu
nate restriction," he said, never

something that Stanford itself set
out to create. He also says that fewer
such arrangements exist in the
school today.
The debate over CIS highlights a
larger discussion over how Stanford
funds its own research and how the
University is often led to make ques
tionable business arrangements
with corporate America and the fed
eral government, arrangements that
some say challenge the very idea of
the University as an institution ded
icated to impartial research and the
open dissemination of knowledge.
The question remains whether
the change in policy at the center is
the sign of a change of the degree to
which the Engineering School is
willing to let others dictate the terms
of its own research, or whether it is
merely adapting to the most produc
tive methods of financing its re
search. Given what Hennessy says,
both may be true.
"The semiconductor industry is
now a large, financially healthy in
dustry capable of shouldering more
of the research burden," he said,
which also means a declining inter
est from the Defense Department in
funding the center to protect its ac
cess to technology. Inviting Asian
companies to the table could pro
vide a large new source of funds and
research talent.
Reis says that the two Japanese
companies currently in membership
talks with the center, Hitachi Ltd.
and Toshiba C orp., have a history of
cooperative and productive collabo
rative research. 1 le also stressed that
the center is interested in broad par
ticipation by Asian companies, not
just Japanese ones, and is looking at
Taiwanese and Vietnamese candi
dates for membership as well.
According to Reis, there is an in
creased level of comfort with Asian
companies among the center's
founding businesses who initially
strongly opposed Asian involve
ment, because I hey arc now operat
ing in a much more global market
place.
Reis minimized the influence of
the founding companies both in the

original 1983 decision to exclude
Asian companies and the recent re
versal of that decision.
"Those companies are not in a
position to make decisions for CIS,"
he said.
According to Lusignan, the cen
ter shouldn't have been making
those decision either. He said that
no Stanford department should
have the power unilaterally to ex
clude research partners because of
their nationality. If Stanford is -oing
to make a policy that allows iuat to
take place, he said, "that's not a po
sition to be chosen by the center, but
by the faculty."
Lusignan and the faculty mem
bers who signed his petition believe
that Stanford h;is limited its interna
tional focus in order to become a
business partner with Silicon Valley,
which then exploits Stanford for its
own purposes.

The petition says, "Rather than
being a healthy center of interna
tional learning, Stanford has be
come a stressed local institution, de
pendent on handouts from local cor
porations who have been given free
intellectual property by our admin
istrators."
It also attacks the idea that ad
ministrators can be immersed in
business deals while still remaining
loyal to the University's mission:
"Administrative self interest... has
resulted in administrators changing
broad I Iniversity policy and philoso
phy to suit the viewpoints of their
local business interests."
However, Lusignan is hopeful
that the University culture can
change.
"It's a very positive sign that [the
center's exclusionary rule] is recog
nized as a position that's left be
hind," he said.

The Center for Integrated Systems has recently reversed its policy
of excluding Asian companies from its research partnership.
