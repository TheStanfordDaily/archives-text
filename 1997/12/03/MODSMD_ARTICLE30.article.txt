In honor of the 10th annual
World AIDS Day. 20 Stanford stu
dents participated in a candlelight
procession Monday night.
The vigil, held for the second
consecutive year, was sponsored by
Volunteers Increasing the Visibility
of AIDS, a student-run organiza
tion.
"A candlelight vigil makes you
realize that each of those 30 million
people [who are infected with HIV.
the virus that causes AIDS) have
lives and are loved." said sopho
more Jessica Werner, the group's
co-president. "This vigil is a very
personal thing for those of us whose
lives have been touched by this dis
ease."
The group also staffed a table in
White Plaza Monday, where mem
bers distributed condoms and pam
phlets on HIV and AIDS. They
publicized the day and the event

with fliers and e-mails, as well as a
large banner in White Plaza.
World AIDS Day is an event or
ganized each Dec. I by the I nited
Nations. Programs included an
AIDS awareness train tour in ( hina
and a candlelight procession in Lon
don to honor Princess Diana s work
with AIDS patients.
In the Bay Area, World AIDS
Day was highlighted by the opening
of the IJC-San Francisco AIDS Re
search Institute, the largest such re
search institute other than the Na
tional Institutes of I lealth in Bethes
da, Md.
"This day and this vigil send a
powerful message." said junior
Melissa Lima, co-chair of on cam
pus relations for VIVA. "It warms
mv heart to see so many people
here."
The vigil started in White Plaza,
where participants introduced
themselves and explained why they
came. Most said they wanted to
show concern and support tor peo-

pie living with HIV and AIDS.
"'['here's still so much ignorance,
so much arrogance out there," ex
plained one lreshman.
The group then lit their red and
white candles and proceeded quiet
ly into the center ol the Main Quad.
Although the participants remained
quiet and composed, they garnered
many surprised and interested looks
from passersby.
"The main purpose for those of
lis on this vigil is to have a private
chance to reflect on 111V and AIDS,
but we also know that people
around stop and take notice, so it
;ilso serves to increase publicity of
the disease."' said Lima.
VIVA was started last year by a
group of students who felt that
AIDS was under-publicized at Stan
ford. The group participates in a
number of other AIDS-awareness
events, including National C'ondom
Day, AIDS Awareness Week,
AIDS Lobby Day and AIDS Walk
San Jose.
