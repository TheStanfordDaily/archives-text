# Your Dead Week Study Plan:
## 
### 
9:00 a.m. — Wake up. Decide not to go to lec
ture.
10:00 a.m. — Get out of bed. Decide that lec
ture would not benefit the final grade so much
as knuckling down to some good, hard studying.
10:09 a.m. — Open textbook and begin to read.
10:10 a.m. — Notice a paper clip on your desk.
Contemplate why it is there.
10:12 a.m. — After two minutes of solid con
templation of the paper clip, pick it up and
examine it. Close textbook. Begin to see if you

can make the paper clip resemble the silhouette
of a turkey.
I 1:20 a.m. — Having successfully warped the
paper clip to not only resemble a turkey but
also the letter T, an eye and a perfect square (it
wasn't easy getting those sides exactly the same
length) go to the bathroom. Read the same
Dead Week issue of The Daily for the 13th
time. This time you're so desperate for new
reading matter you even read the classifieds and
Diversions. The classifieds are funnier than
Diversions; nothing ever changes.
12:00 p.m. — Start lunch. Midway through
lunch someone mentions the date. You realize
that your 20-page, four-book review which con
stitutes 98 percent of your final grade is due
two days from now, not next week as you had

previously thought Blow whatever beverage
you were drinking out of both your nostrils,
mutter "Fuck-me-fuck-me-fuck-me," and run
down to Green Library.
12:36 p.m. — Discover that every book under
900 pages cn your final topic has been checked
out for the next three years by a member of the
Hoover Institute. Over the phone he explains
that it is absolutely out of the question that he
give you any of the books because he needs
them to prop up his coffee table.
12:45 p.m. — Begin to read the introduction
to "Tedium, Boredom and Dullness-induced
Death in the 19th Century," a book written in
1940 by a man who designed his writing as a
punishment to those who had been ungodly
enough to expect something interesting in

their reading matter.
3:22 p.m. — Wake Lip -iui /uui face pressed
against the third page of your now drool-smoth
ered book. Decide that it is time to knuckle
down to some good, hard plagiarism.
3:56 p.m. — Photocopy 30 pages of an article by
a distinguished but obscure scholar. Cunningly
white out his / her name at the top of the arti
cle and replace it with your own. Your research
paper is now complete wit!i a day to spare!
Reward yourself with a nap.
11:59 p.m. — Wake up to the sound of fresh
man dorm RAs imploring their frosh to scream.
Go back to bed after a good days preparation
for finals. Remember the best preparation for
any exam is to be relaxed and up on your sleep.
