I fan is is I xhibit A. At 24. the Stan
lord Law School graduate became
Ihe country 's youngest law school
dean.
In I ebruaiv I ( >%, San Jose's Lin
coln I aw School was in turmoil.
( harles Kilian, a Lincoln professor,
had flunked nearly two-thirds of his
first veat contracts class. Lincoln's
policy was to require any first-year
student who failed a course to repeat
the entire first-year curriculum.
I lie school faced do/ens of
dropouts and the resignation in
protest ol I LS. District Judge lames
W are, a I incoln Law School profes
sor. In March 14%, amidst the
Ware Kilian feud, Lincoln's dean
went on sick leave, later to resign.
I oday. thanks in large part to
Harris' leadership, Judge Ware is
back and so Lincoln Law School.
Harris, a former law clerk for
Judge Ware, was an attorney at a
San Francisco law firm and a part
time contracts professor at Lincoln
when the Ware-Kilian conflict
erupted.
"Anyone who knew me for more
than a month knew that I was inter
ested in acadcmia," Harris said
about her decision to throw her hat
into the i ing for the deanship In July
14%. I incoln selected her from
among seven candidates to become
the new dean.
"The Ware Kilian crisis raised
important questions," Harris said.
'"What is our grading standard?'
"What are our policies about acade
mic disqualification?' I saw these
substantive issues as mv mission."

Lincoln Law. a nearly 80-year
old private school which earned
State Bar accreditation in 1943, has
in fact changed its grading policies
since I larris took over. Now. if a stu
dent fails a first-year course, the
Academic Standards Committee —
comprised ol Harris and six faculty
members decides the appropriate
action It is now possible for the stu
dent to repeat just that course,
rather than the whole first year.
"We are developing a program
consistent with who our students
are," said Harris, who is younger
than most of the students. "They are
primarily working adults who are
parenting and going to school at
night. Many have been out of school
for a long time."
About 140 students attend Lin
coln, and classes are taught by 24
part-time professors.
"Due to the transitional nature of
the school," Harris said. "I have an
opportunity to be creative about the
curriculum and to be part of really
building something."
Professor Kilian, the contracts
professor who regularly failed his
students, resigned before I larris be
came dean.
Joseph Moless, a Lincoln profes
sor and the secretary of its Board of
Trustees, confessed that he was
skeptical when I larris was chosen as
dean, but is now one of her biggest
supporters.
"With Maya," he said, "there is
no empire building. There are no fire
walls that would impede eoopera
tiveness."
I larris was pleased that the facul
ty and students gave her the benefit
of the doubt. "|Lveryone is J willing
to roll up their sleeves and make the
program work," said I larris, who, as
well as being just 30, stands only
slightly taller than live feet.
Lincoln Faculty Chair John
Noble, who lost out on the dean po

sition to Harris, said without hesita
tion that nlic is doing an excellent
job. "She has performed more than
her years would indicate," he said,
noting that she has particularly en
couraged minority students.
While the prospect of leading a
troubled law school might have
daunted even the most seasoned
legal educator, Harris was no
stranger to challenge. Ol African-
American and E:ast Indian descent,
Harris became a single mother at 17.
To finance her bachelor s degree
in French at UC-Berkeley, she
worked full time as a bookkeeper.
She attributes much of her success to
her older sister, a deputy district at
torney in Alameda, and her mother.
Harris is currently on a leave of
absence from her San Francisco law
firm. "I hope she comes back," said
Mike Baker, a law firm partner with
whom I iarris worked on a class ac
tion law suit. "She has great instincts
about people and the ingredients to
be a great litigator."
Baker referred to I lan is as "tire
less," noting that she taught at Lin
coln while working full time at the
firm and raising her daughter.
Even as Lincoln's dean. Harris
still teaches a contracts class. She
also teaches a sex discrimination
seminar at San Francisco's Hastings
('ollege of the I .aw.
But cultivating Lincoln Law
School remains I larris" primary pro
fessional goal, at least for the lime
being.
"I have <S(X) projects that I'd love
to complete," she said. I lei two-year
contract to serve as Lincoln's dean
expires in Inly. After that, her plans
are uncertain.
"Right now, I'm just going with
the flow," I iarris said. "I really liked
being a lawyer. 1 really like being a
dean. I really like being on the facul
ty. I'm taking it literally one day at a
time."
