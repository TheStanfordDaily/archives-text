With the loss, Stanford (1-3) earned its first three
loss month sinee Mareh l l )88 and saw its 49-game
home winning streak (the longest streak in Division I)
snapped. However, the Cardinal's winning streak at
Maples Pavilion remains intact.
That was little consolation to the ('aid. which
showed spirited first-half play that allowed it to stay
with easily the country's best team, only to see it nil go
up in flames to the tune of five second-half field goals.
Meanwhile, the 1 .adv Vols were swarming on defense,
cutting off passing lanes and not allowing Stanford the
offensive freedom it experienced earlier in the contest.
"The first half was a display of offense and very lit
tie defense on our part," said Tennessee head coach
Pat Summitt. "Certainly, Stanford did a great job ol
beating us one-on-one with their dribble penetration.
I hey also took advantage of their inside play."
Indeed. Stanford showed Tennessee and the 8.025
in attendance what it could do, even without forwards
Naomi Mulitauaopele and Kristin Eolkl. Sophomore

However, there were cracks
showing in Stanford's armor that
were temporarily disguised by the
team's sizzling 57-percent field-goal
shooting. I or example, the Cardinal
was out-rebounded on the offensive
glass 4-3, while the Lady Vols had
seven steals. Also, Stanford's outside
shooting (I -ol 6 from behind the arc)
was not there to take the pressure off
the frontcourt.

Meanwhile, Owen and Peterson
did not make a second-half field goal,
while Scott was held tosix points after
the break. All told, Stanford shot
only 17 percent from the field after
halftime.
"We hurt ourselves as much asany
thing." said Stanford head coach I ara
VanDerveer. "We had turnovers, we
had poor shot selection, and we didn't
do the things that helped us in the first
half. We weren't able to break anyone
