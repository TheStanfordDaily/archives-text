## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
A vcai ago. I lie Stanford women's basketball team
vviis No I in the nation. I he ( 'ardinal was undefeated
anil silting at the top of everybody's team to beat list
(>n the othei side of the country, defending nation
al champion Tennessee was struggling through what
was considered a rebuilding yeai W hen Stanford and
Tennessee met Dec. 15 in Knoxville, the Cardinal
nabbed an 82 65 victory, becoming the liisi Stanford

team to beat the Lady Vols at Thompson Holing
Arena.
At the postgame press conference. Tennessee head
coach Pat Summitt stated her opinion that Stanford
was the best team in the nation. Summitt said her
squad was at least 20 points worse than the best team,
but she promised that her team would be 20 points bet
ter by the end of the season.
Hirec and a hall months later, the I .adv Vols had 10
losses and were a No. 3 seed in the
NCAA tournament's Midwest Re
gional. Bui Tennessee upsel lop-seed
ed ( onneeticul to advance to (he
Final I our, wlktc ii beat Noire Dame
and < >KI I )ominion to win iis seeond
straight national ehampionship all
during a "rebuilding" year.
On tho other side of the draw.
Stanford eruised into its third con
seeulive I inal Four by an average
margin ol victory of almost 33 points.
I he ( aid had one loss on the season
and looked unstoppable, but Old
I )ominion ended Stanford's champi
onship run with a one point over
time victory.
Now last forward to Stanford's
SS-70 loss to I'ennessee at Sail Jose
Arena last Saturday. This year, Ten
nessee is on top of the polls. Stanford

is st i uggling to find its chemistry and
the roles are reversed.
Makes you wonder just what
might happen between now and
March,
In the first half, the Cardinal
showed a glimpse of just how well it
is capable of playing. Stanford's in
experienced backcourt played with
complete maturity, and the Card
looked like a fluid team.
Sophomore Melody Peterson
played like a veteran guard, pene
trating on the I adv Vols at will. She
exploited the Tennessee defense for
four spectacular driving layups and
added a three-pointer for 1 1 points
at the break.
"The first hall really showed our
team how well we could do," said
head coach Tara VanDcrvecr.
"Then the second half was a situa
tion where, when you don't do the
right things, when you're not making
the plays you need to make, how bad

it could be against a team that has the
athleticism and the presence that
Tennessee has on the court."
Stanford started the second hall
with four turnovers and no points
over the first 4 1/2 minutes. Ihe
Lady Vols increased their defensive
intensity, and signs ol youth began to
show for the ( aid.
"We didn't do the things that
helped us in the first half," Van
Derveer said. "We weren't able to
break anyone down off the dribble,
and that's what I thought Peterson
did well in the first half. I think that's
when our backeourt inexperience
was exploited."
The backeourt was a combined I
for 12 in the second hall and the
dizzying drives Peterson made in the
first half hail trouble finding the rim
m the second. I liings didn't gel any
better with the front line, eilhei
After going 4 for-5 in the first
half, senior center Olympia Scott

only managed one field goal after
halftime. Senior forwards Heather
()wen and Vanessa Nvgaard were 0-
foi 3 and J for <\ respectively, and
Tennessee dominated the offensive
boards by a margin of 23-10 for the
game.
With the win. Tennessee main
tained a perfect record while Stan
ford chopped to I * as many loss
es as a ( animal team has experi
encedover an entire season since the
seniors first arrived. Hut the Cardi
nal savs it's intent on remaining pos
itive and continuing to improve.
"It is difficult to lose." Scott said.
"Hut at the same time, we're going to
be strong, and we're going to slick
together. We're not holding our
heads down. We're trying to use it as
a learning experience. We'd rather
peak later than now."
If anv team ever showed the
value ol that lesson.it was last year's
Tennessee squad. Summitt was true

to her word, and in the end her team
won the games that counted most.
So while Stanford's I 3 start may
seem frustrating, or even a bit unnat
ural, the season's final outcome will
hinge more on the team's improve
ntcnl and lesson the results of its first
four games.
"Ii is a very tough start, and for a
lot ol teams, it might spell disaster."

VanDcrvccr said.
"These are growing pains, and
it's not eiisy. Hut I think our team is
dealing with il the best way that
they can. I his is November. I hope
that we can go thiough the same
type ol process that Tennessee did
(last year), and I think we have the
personnel that can get the job
done."
