Sophomore fielder Andy Wal

his trademark garbage goals, throw
ing in a shot off a goalie deflection by
Cal's Peter Keifer to give Stanford a
4-3 lead.
Cal came right back to tie the
game at 1:25 on a goal by Eldad
Hazor. But just as it looked like over
time in the making. Stanford took
possession of the ball with 15 seconds
remaining.
In what will surely go down as a
legendary Cardinal sports moment.
Stanford drove down the pool, and
with just two seconds left. Beaubien
fired a left-handed shot over Kiefer's
outstretched hands for the 5-4 win.
"Luckily, we practiced that in
practice." Dettamanti said. "I .avne is

right-handed, but he [can shoot] am
bidextrous They weren't expect
ing that."
"I usually play that same posi
tion," Beaubien said. "I just hap
pened to be in the right spot at the
right time."
Stanford opened tournament play
Friday by defeating No. 5 U(-Irvine
6-5. After the Anteaters fought back
to tie the game 5-5, Cardinal sopho
more fielder Sean Joy slapped in the
game-winner off a pass from I leiffer
on with 3:23 remaining.
"I le was playing very well." Det
tamanti said. "I would say that's been
his best game of the year."
But in a replay of last season, the
Cardinal, despite finishing second in
the MPSF tournament, did not re
ceive an NC AA bid.
" This happened to us last year."
Dettamanti said, adding that with
only one graduating senior, "The fu
ture looks brieht for next season."
