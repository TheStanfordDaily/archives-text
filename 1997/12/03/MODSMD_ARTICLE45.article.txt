think they're real special people, and
we miss them a lot."
Wideman is one of only three
Stanford players to record more
than 500 career assists. Starbird is
the Cardinal's all-time leading scor
er. They're third and fourth, respec
tively. in career steals. Starbird was
last year's Naismith Player of the
Year; Wideman won the NCAA
West Regional MVP.
"I think Bird is one of the most
exciting players to ever play at Stan
ford," Wideman said. "I know when
I was out, and she got the hall on the
break. I would hold my breath. Bird
gets the ball at halfcourt and has a
one-on-two or a one-on-one, and it's
just, 'What is she going to do?' She's
a scorer in whatever way she can.
She became a player who really
showed up for the big games and was
able to carry us."
Starbird brought the offensive
flair, and Wideman added defensive
intensity. Nobody could lead a team
like Wideman; no one could score
points like Starbird.
"For Jamila the first thing is her
amazing leadership on and off the
court," Starbird said. "That's a qual
ity there's no statistic for. She was an

amazing leader as well as a great
ball-handler in terms of running the
offense. My career and everything 1
did at Stanford benefited from hav
ing Jamila play the point guard. I
owe a lot of my personal achieve
ments to Jamila."
If their collegiate careers benefit
ed from playing with one another
and at a program like Stanford, the
adjustment to the pros hasn't been
easy. Not only are Wideman and
Starbird on different teams, but they
play in different leagues. And so far.
neither has enjoyed the kind of team
success the two achieved at Stanford.
Starbird's season with the Seattle
Reign of the ABL is in full swing,
and so far the top pick of the ABL
draft is averaging a respectable 14.4
points per game. But her team is
dead last in the league with a 6-12
record.
"It's been pretty tough for us."
Starbird said. "That's the hardest
thing to adjust to. I wasn't used to
losing games."
Wideman can relate. As the first
round pick of the WNBA's Los An
geles Sparks, the point guard spent
her summer as the rookie on a "can't
lose on paper" team. But the Sparks
stumbled to a 4-7 start, leading to
frustration for the team and the fir
ing of head coach Linda Sharp.
"I had never experienced losing

five games in a row." Wideman said.
"You really find out what your
chemistry is like and who you can
count on. Things are great when you
win all the time and dealing with one
loss is a whole different thing. When
you deal with five in a row, it's very
difficult. You have to depend on
each other, and 1 think our team
came to learn that over time."
The Sparks' coaching situation
also biought drastic changes to
Wideman's individual status. Under
Sharp, Wideman was a league leader
in minutes played. But new head
coach Julie Rousseau made adjust
ments to the lineup in an effort to
turn things around for the Sparks.
As a result, Wideman's playing time
diminished.
"It was a very abrupt change and
not really something 1 was prepared
for," Wideman said. "It was frustrat
ing not to be able to be out there. But
as a player, I know I've always re
spected teammates who could get
outside of their personal situation
and appreciate team success.
"I realize now what made (Stan
ford) special was to be with people
who might not ever get off the bench
but who you could count on in every
way. I tried to take that approach
and be somebody who remained
positive and remained supportive of
the people who were out there. 1

won't lie and say it wasn't difficult. I
think everybody wants to play, and
my attitude right now is to do every
thing I can to put myself in a position
to do that this next season."
But while Wideman spends the
offseason working on her offensive
moves. Starbird is plugging away lor
the Reign. And Stanford's scoring
machine says she's still adjusting to
the pro game.
"With every game. I've been get
ting more comfortable with things
on the court," Starbird said. "I have
a lot to work on. and I'm learning to
deal with the physical [nature] of the
game. I've definitely been put into
tougher situations defensively. I
never had to guard the ball coming
up the court; that was Jamila's job.
And it's not really as fun or as easy ;is
Jamila made it look."
Both players have had to work
harder on certain aspects of their
game and have found that what
made them so successful at Stanford
doesn't necessarily work in the pros.
"1 think a lot of success is based
on a system," VanDerveer said.
"For Kate to look really good, it's
being on a transition team, lot Jami
la. it's playing with other finishers. A
lot of it has to do with the situation
that they get into, the teams that they
play on or maybe the philosophy
that they play in."

Starhird. for example, lias discos
ered that those spectacular transi
tion baskets — or any easy basket,
for that matter — aren't as eas\ to
come by against the tougher defens
es of the ABL.
"Open shots are hard to come
by," Starbird said. "You have to be
able to shoot under pressure. 1 think
I've forced a lot of stuff. I'm still
making adjustments to the game.
I'm learning how to move without
the ball and work harder in terms of
getting the ball."
If Starbird is having trouble get
ting the open shot, Wideman found
it difficult to establish the kind ol
leadership role she had ai Stanford.
Wideman said a short season and
age were two of the big hurdles in de
veloping the kind of role she wanted
on the Sparks.
"I went into the situation being
very sensitive to the fact that I was
the rookie," Wideman said. "And
the only way that I know to gain peo
ple's respect is u> play — is to earn
their respect by the way you practice,
by the way you perform, by allowing
them to trust you because you're de
pendable.
"I think 1 forgot what it took at
Stanford to get to that point. When I
was a freshman, I didn't have the
role that I did as a senior; it was deli
nitely an evolution And 1 think I lor

got that I didn't just arrive on cam
pus and have the relationships that I
did with my teammates."
But judging from the achieve
inents of their collegiate years. Star
bird and Wideman will likely have
successful careers in the pros. (iiven
the time and the opportunity, what
else would you expect of two players
who made such an impact on the
Farm?
"For Jamila. I think it's about hei
team giving her a chance to show the
qualities that she lias." Starhird said
"I think if a team knew how to use
her, she'd be ama/ing at the proles
sional level."
In the meantime, Stanford b.ts
ketball fans will keep a watchful eye
over the professional careers ol two
of their finest. And no matter what
happens 111 the ABL or WNBA.
Starhird and Wideman will always
be remembered for their Cardinal
achievements.
"I'm definitely proud to be part ol
the tradition," Wideman said.
"Which is what I said when I came
here: I don't want to just be part ol a
tradition, but I want toadd to it.' Ami
I hope in some way I did, and to have
played with someone like Bird is a
great experience with everybody,
but especially given her ability and
the fact that she's so successful now.
Not a lot iil people gel to do that."
