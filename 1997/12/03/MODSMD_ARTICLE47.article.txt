# Stanford volleyball lands top seed in the NCAA's toughest region
## Cardinal hosts opening rounds 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
The seedings are in.and thanks in no
small part to geography, the Stanford
women's volleyball team landed in possibly
the toughest bracket of the N( A A tourna
ment.

The selection commit
tee seeds eight teams in
the 56-team tournament
and fil's in the gaps most
Iv on the basis of geo
graphical location. As a
result, the typically
tougher West Coast
schools till up the Pacific
and Mountain regions

while the less competitive Eastern schools
get placed in the East and ( entral regions.
"()ur region is not going to be easy," said
head coach I )on Shaw. I think it's a pretty
balanced regional that we have; there are a
lot of pretty good teams. And I think that
the Pacific is (a tough bracket). too. I think
that those two regionals are a little bit
strong*, i than the East and the Central.

Despite being the No. 2 team in the na
tion according to the coaches poll. Penn
State (28-1) nabbed the tournament's top
seed over I ong Beach State (28-1). Asa re
sult. the Nittanv I ions, one of six Big 10
Conference teams in the tourney, are sit
ting prctu in what is clearly the tourna
ment's easiest bracket.
No. 7 Brigham Young (24-5) is the tour
nament s eighth seed and Penn States like
ly opponent in the regional final. But be
fore thev can face the Nittanv Lions, the
('ougars will probably have to beat No. 16
I'exas A&M (22-6) in the regional semifi
nal. I he onh other ranked team in the East
is No. 18 Maryland (26-1) of the Atlantic
( oast ('onference.
"I think Penn State's got a pretty easy
road.'" Shaw said. "But that 's the advantage
of being the No. 1 seed. (ieographieal loca
t ion has a lot to do with it. \V hen thev re till

ing in the brackets with these teams, you're
filling in the two Western regionals with a
lot of Western teams, and that's where the
strength is this year."
Central
I he only bracket weaker than the l ast
is the Central. Fourth-ranked Wisconsin
(26-2) got the final No. I seed by default. A
win over Penn State in the regular season
boosted the Badgers' tanking, but a top
seed wasn't a possibility until No. (i I lorida
fell apart.
The Ciators (30-2) dropped two of their
last three matches to cough up a top seed
ing. but somehow managed to get the liltli
seed overall and land in the East. No. 12
Washington State (24-6). one ol six Pacific
10 schools to receive an invitation, is one ol
the few teams to get moved out ol its geo
graphical region and could give the (iators
a challenge in the regional semifinal.
"We're playing in a tougher regional that,
we might be in if we played with Wisconsin
or Florida," Shaw saiil. I |ust thought that
Florida was a little too high. 1 can see (I JC-
Santa Barbara being the fifth seed), but I
think from a geographical standpoint, in
stead ol sending Florida all the way out here,
they're sending Santa Barbara up. and I lon
da's going to Wisconsin."
Pacific
long Beach State, the Big West chain
pion. is the tournament's No. 2 team and
gets No. 11 Nebraska (23-6) in the bottom
half of the draw. Ihe Pacific Regional is
home to eight ranked teams, including No.
8 USC (21-5) and No. 12 Washington (18-
9).
I he fifth-seeded Huskies could face a
tough second-round opponent in No. 17
Pacific (20-8), and the Women of Troy
would have to beat Nebraska to get a shot
at Long Beach State in the regional final.
Possiblv the best first-round match of the
tournament takes place in the Pacific,
where ' o. 15 Hawaii (23-6) faces No. 21
I ovola Vlarymount (21-6).
"I 1 ( Nebraska. Washington !K )P

there are potentially some interesting
matchups." Shaw said. "II [Washington's!
outside hitters don't come through, they

time, they can do a lot of damage. I ong

that. Hut I .ong Beach's ball control is very,
very good."
