# Kerri Walsh fights back
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
A year ago. Kerri Walsh was
completely carefree. The star out
side hitter ol the Stanford women's
volleyball team was riding the wave
of an ama/ing freshman campaign
and about to embark tin one of the
most successful postseason show
ings in Stanford history.
I he Cardinal cruised through
last year's N( A A tournament, w in
ning its third national title in the
most lopsided championship match
ever And Walsh was a big reason
win. She hit an incredible 4M4 with
HU kills m 16 tournament games en
route to winning I inal Four MVP.
National 112 reshman of the Year and
first-team All-American honors.
I rcshman year was just amaz
ing." Walsh said." "Every aspect of
it. I iiist had so much fun. It was the
easiest year possible to come in and

play vollevball because (he seniors
were so primed and ready to win.
Hut that was one year and one
shoulder iniiirv removed from
where Walsh is today. She hasn't
been full-strength ;ill year. And on
the eve <>t the first round ot the
NCAA tournament, Walsh isn't
even swinging her arm at practices.
Instead. Walsh is saving up for
the next match. It is a trend she's
followed all season long: Participa
tion in practices is dictated by how
Walsh feels on that particular day
or perhaps bv who the opponent is
for that weekend.
In specific matches, Walsh will
swing or tip depending on how she
feels during warmups. And even
that status can change at any specil
ic point in the match il things aren't
going as well as the ( ardinal would
like.
"It jlist put a damper on my sea
son." Walsh said. " This year |has]

been frustrating because 1 haven't
been able to contribute as much as I
would like to offensively. But I'm
learning how to adapt and adjust
my volleyball style and focusing on
my defensive skills, so 1 think it's
been beneficial."
Walsh isn't exactly the offensive
force she was last season, but that
hasn't slowed down the outside hit
ter's success. It's just changed
tilings a little bit. Instead of pound
ing kills like she did last year (521
on the season — the second-highest
single-season total in school histo
ry). Walsh is being noticed for the
other aspects of her game.
"She's always been a really
smart player," said senior co-cap
tain Kristin Folkl. "I don't know
that I've ever met anyone who sees
the court as well as she does. What
I've seen her improve on this year is
reaching a new maturity level
having to deal with a lot of adversi
ty and I think she's come through
with flying colors."
A perfect example of Walsh's
contribution was the team's Oct. 17
match against then-No. 10 Wash
ington State. Walsh surprised the
Cougars by merely tipping the ball
on offense. The maneuver worked,
and Walsh even managed five kills
against the bewildered Washington
State defense.
Hut that wasn't where Walsh
made the biggest impact for her
team. Defensively, Walsh showed
why she's considered by some to
have the best hands in the Pac-10
(aside from setters) by posting a ca
reer-high 23 digs in addition to 13
assists and 3 1/2 blocks.
"It just demonstrates what a
great all-around player she is."
Folkl said. "When people focus on
what an offensively gifted volley
ball player she is. how great of a de
fensive player she is gets complete
ly overlooked. It has given people a
greater opportunity to see how im
portant the other side of the game
is. and how much she dominates
that, too."
Walsh's success this year hasn't
been overlooked, as the outside hit
ter earned All-Pac-10 first-team
honors. Hut that's not to say the
year hasn't been frustrating for the
offensive weapon who, along with
Folkl, makes up half of the
strongest one-two outside hitter
combination in the country.
"It's forced me to think about a
lot ol other things, other aspects of
the game that I really never had to
think about before," Walsh said. "I
think I've grown up a lot. and my
patience has gotten a little better
just because I've been forced to be
patient with myself."
Walsh's status as an incredible
offensive weapon has obviously
been diminished by the injury, and
in ill likelihood Stanford will need
Walsh swinging in order to win the
national title. Hut in the meantime.
Walsh's patience on offense and
her focus on other aspects of her
game have allowed her to remain a
major factor in the team's success.
An injury "to such a key player is
doubly hard." said head coach Don
Shaw. You substitute for "some
body who's not that big of a factor,
but we need to have her out there to
be successful. And that's not a slap
in the face to any other players on
our team. She's that good."
