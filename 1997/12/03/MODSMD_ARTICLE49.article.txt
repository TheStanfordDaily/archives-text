# Women's basketball looks for December redemption
## Card seeks winning ways 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
At least the Stanford women's basketball team has
two weeks to regroup.
The 14th-ranked Cardinal (1-3), fresh from its first
three-loss month in nine years, hopes December will
bring more than good cheer namely, victories. Stan
ford will take to the road during the winter break,
squaring off against No. Illinois Dec. 14 and third
ranked Connecticut Dec. 21 before coming home to
face No. 16 Colorado seven days later. The Card will
then close this stretch with home games against the
Oregon schools, as the Stanford women embark on
their defense of the Pacific lOC (inference title.
While the Cardinal's start has been uncharacteristi
cally sluggish, the past two games against IJSF and top
ranked Tennessee showed marked improvement from
Stanford's opening weekend. Sophomore guards Mile
na Flores and Melody Peterson showed signs of dy
namic play while cutting down on turnovers. Also, se
nior forwards Heather Owen and Olympia Scott aver
aged 19 points per game while not fouling out ol either
contest.
Keep in mind that those two have to carry a lot of the
offensive load down low with senior forward Naomi
Mulitauaopele out with an injury and redshirt junior
forward Kristin Folkl still pursuing a national title in
volleyball. It appears to be a matter of the post players
continuing to grow into their roles while the backcourt

learns to play under control.
However, the schedule stops for no one, and first up
for Stanford will he the third Big 10 school on its sched
ule. Illinois (3-1 through Monday night) was moved up
from its original Dec. 23 date because the Massachu
setts and Maine games conflicted with finals week,
adding yet another stern road test against a ranked op
ponent.
Illinois is fresh from winning the San Juan Shootout
in San Juan, Puerto Rico, over Thanksgiving break.
The Fighting lllini held off No. 15 Duke 77-65 in the
tourney final as sophomore forward Tauja Catchings
poured in 17 points. Last year's Big 10 Player of the
Year, forward Ashley Berggren. is also back and will
certainly present big problems for the frontcourt.
The Connecticut game will be part of the first annu
al Honda Elite 4 Holiday Classic in Orlando, Fla. The
made-for-TV matchup pits two teams that had aspira
tions of meeting each other last spring for the NCAA
championship. The Huskies were undefeated and
seeded first in the Midwest Region before getting up
ended by eventual national champion Tennessee in the
regional final.
UConn lost Associated Press and Big East Player of
the Year Kara Wolters, but it still has plenty of fire
power back, namely Nykesha Sales. T he senior forward
poured in 23 points in 24 minutes in UConn's last game,
a 101-38 drubbing of Rhode Island that improved the
Huskies' record to 6-0. The victory was UConn head
coach Cieno Auriemma's 3(X)th career win.
