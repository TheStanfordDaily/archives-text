# Former prof., University dispute facts before arbiter
## Pfefferbaum hearing held 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Stanford administrators and professors
spent the last two days trailing talcs of events
that led to the retirement ol Psychiatry Prof.
Adoll Pl'cl'fcrbaum in a hearing todetermine
disputed facts in the ease.
Testimony will continue today before a
hearings officer, who will report to the Advi
sory Board of the Academic C ouncil on six
disputed facts. I lie Advisory Board will then
rule on whether University President (ier
hard Casper's request to dismiss Pfeffer
baum from his Stanford post is warranted.
Pfefferbaum retired from a position at the
Palo Alto Veterans Affairs I lospital in 19%,
an action that Stanford considered to consti
tute a retirement from his Stanford profes
sorship as well. Pfefferbaum has contested
that view, saying he remains a tenured pro
fessor. After a Santa Clara County judge

agreed with Pfefferbaum last January,
( asper filed formal charges asking the Advi
sory Board to dismiss Pfefferbaum.
I wo days of testimony this week focused
on issues of whether Pfefferbaum's research
space and staff were cut; whether a letter ol
counseling and a proficiency report were im
properly distributed; whether Pfefferbaum
was prevented from doing outside consulting
work; and whether Pfefferbaum was improp
erly denied "without compensation" status.
Without compensation status is some
times granted to people who want to work at
the VA hospital without pay. After Pfeffer
baum retired from the hospital last July, he
requested to be allowed to continue to work
at his Mental I lealth ( linical Research ( en
ter there without pay.
Pfefferbaum was granted without com
pensation status until Nov. 15, "enough time
to pack his hags," testified VA hos
pital Chief of Stall' Richard Mazze.
"The VA has and had no reason
or incentive to grant Dr. Pfefler
baum unlimited [without compen
sation! status," Mazze said.
Medical School Dean Eugene
Bauer said his office typically does
not request such status for Stanford
faculty members who also work at
the VA hospital.
During the allotted 4 1/2
months, Pfeflerbaum did 'absolute
ly nothing to transition his center to
another setting/" VA hospital Di
rector James (ioff said.
Golf complained that I'feffer
baum during his affiliation with the
VA hospital had not done enough to
contribute to the hospital's primary
mission ol providing patient care.
I lie Mental Health Clinical Re
search Center, which focuses on
causes and treatment of schizophre
nia, may fit in with the mission, but
"that doesn't mean the people run
ning the center are necessarily
putting the veteran's best interests
in mind." (roll said.

But personal disputes between
Pfefferbaum and members of the
hospital administration did not re
sult in Pfefferbaum being singled out
for reduetions in research space or
staffing, several witnesses testified.
Pfefferbaum claims his research
space decreased from S.(XX) square
feet to 3. KM) square feet in June
19%. but Maz/e said his space re
mained constant at about 5,800
square feet. The configuration of the
space changed several times, but
only as part of moves being made
throughout the psychiatry services
at the VA hospital, Mazzesaid.
He added that Pfefferbaum and
his research group were "squatters"
occupying a significant amount of
space without approval, space that
was not being used by any other
group.
"Even though the space had
never been assigned for Dr. Pfeffer
baum's use in the lirst place, he lost
no research space," Mazze said.
Pfefferbaum also was asked to
find alternative funding sources for
several of his researchers who were
being paid by the VA hospital to do
clinical work rather than research.
Hie request was due to budget prob
lems that required 10-perecnt

staffing cuts throughout the hospi
tal. Mazze said.
Pfefferbaum argued that no
other researchers had positions
eliminated in a similar fashion, but
Ira (ilick the acting deputy chief
of stall for psychiatry at the VA hos
pital who replaced Pfefferbaum in
that position â€” said the problems
only arose when Pfefferbaum ig
nored Mazze's request.
With regard to Pfefferbaum's
outside consulting, (Hick said he had
asked Psychiatry Department Chair
Alan Schatzberg for advice on how
to handle Pfefferbaum and Dr.Jared
I inklenberg's requests for approval
because he was new to the job.
Schatzberg told (Hick to ask the two
doctors if they were seeing or treat
ing patients, which is not allowed
under V A hospital regulations.
I inklenberg explained his con
sulting work and the work was
quickly approved, (Hick said, but PI
efferbaum did not supply the re
quested information.
"I felt that I was being singled
out and harassed," Pfefferbaum tes
tified. II he had a problem with he
consulting, "it would be appropri
ate ... for Dr. Schatzberg to call
