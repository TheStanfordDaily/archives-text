# Calling Her Easy from the Maples Pavilion bleachers
## Volleyball writer Robin Davidson finds that when it comes to volleyball terminology, most fans don't have a clue 
### 
/ / mi dig when Ihe other team tries lo
I spike it. and \on get it up. right?"
Ihe question was asked with complete
uncertainty. It was an honest question, and I
guess it's better to ask when you're not cer
tain Hut the fact that it was asked by a pro
lessional athlete (albeit not a volleyball pla\
et) almost made me laugh.
I hen it got me thinking. What's so differ
ent about volleyball? Just about am sports
fan can turn on the I V to watch a football,
baseball 01 basketball game and understand
what's going on but not volleyball.
Aside from reacting to diving digs, long
rallies and powei lul kills, most fans have no
grasp of things like blocking defenses, setting
schemes or rotations.
I'm sure most ol Maples could tell you il
senior outside hitter Kristin I olkl was
swinging hard, and I certainly hope they
could tell you il Stanford was winning. Hut I
wonder just how much they understand be
\ . Ifll I I 11ilI

lii Stanford's last contest, for example,
the Cardinal struggled through its early
games against Hawaii. Head coach Don
Shaw said .iltei the match that he almost
called oil his squad's blocking entirely.

Meanwhile the people in the bleachers
weren't sittinu around commenting on the
( ai d's inadequate blocking defense. Instead
tin v were asking questions like. "\\ h\ do the
I lawaii hitters keep getting kills?' and 'Win
doesn't I olkl just int it that hard every time?"
There's an awful lot going on out there
that the majority of the crowd has no com

prehension of. And it's not that way with
other sports. Most fans can tell you when a
basketball team is missing its shots or a foot
ball team keeps getting burned on the pass.
Not that those sports are without their
own confusing aspects. Volleyball just seems
more extreme. I'm not exempt from the ig
norance either. But as a sportswriter cover
ing the volleyball beat, I'm obligated to at
least pretend I know what 's going on.
Thankfully, the Stanford media guide de
votes an entire page to volleyball terminolo
gy. But when 1 looked there tor a little help.
I found it could be even more confusing.
Here's a sample:
Hitter— A player who attacks the ball.
If that definition isn't quite clear, let's ex
amine what an attack is:
Attack Attempt — The attempt by a player
to terminate a play by hitting the ball to the
floor on the opponent's side.
Straightens everything out. right? Even
the terminology is explained in terms that
only volleyball-minded people would under

stand. 1 lere's my favorite:
Blocking Error A violation that consists
of touching the net. crossing the center line,
blocking a set or any other violation which
pertains to illegal blocking.
I sure hope the blockers know what they
can and can't do. because I'm not sure any
one else could understand. When I was done
with the media guide. I turned to my room
mate. She played volleyball in high school,
and 1 knew she'd give me the real scoop.
At the first match of the season, we came
up with a short list of terms that she thought
1 should incorporate into my vocab. Here are
a few:
Calling ller Easy I his is when a player
makes the dig on a hard-hit attack.
Yeah, that's one I should add to my list of
regularly used volleyball terms. 1 can just
imagine someone at Maples yelling "Don't
let her call you easy!" when an opposing
team makes the great defensive play.
There were a couple that I thought were
good, though. For example, a "facial" is

when a player gets a kill that goes off an op
ponent's face. Then there are terms like
"spader" for an "-hrv.'c!" lor good de
fense.
These are actually usable and can even
add a little fun to a match. Even if you don't
know exactly what's going on. it's beneficial
to know what you're veiling about if you
choose to heckle the other team. (It's not al
ways enough to shout at people with names
like Koukou. which can he pronounced
Cuckoo.)
So the volleyball-literate world has a
small population, and for the most part, it's
not even something you can pick up by going
to the matches. But with a little help from the
more knowledgeable, we can all increase our
wisdom on volleyball lingo and add to our
enjoyment of the game.

Robin warns volleyball fans not to ask her
anything too technical, unless they're pre
pared for the fact that she'll likely make up
the answer.
