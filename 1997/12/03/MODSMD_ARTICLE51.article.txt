# Clark catching on quickly with 49ers
## Stanford grad leading 'normal' life as key member of NFL's top team 
### Michael Hope Contributing writer 
After the San Francisco 4 l )ers' 17-10
victory over the San Diego Chargers Nov.
23, rookie tight end (ireg Clark. Stanford
Class of '97, stood in front of the 49ers'
shower room chatting with two-time
league MVP, quarterback Steve Young.
Perhaps Clark was lobbying lor more
passes or analyzing the sluggishness of the
49ers' offense â€” or maybe he was simply
discussing his dinner plans.
In an interview with the ex-Cardinal
star, Clark stressed that despite all the
hype, the NFL is really about "normal guys
leading normal lives."
A typical "work day"for Clark starts
promptly at N a.m.. when he arrives at the
49ers' Santa Clara headquarters for a
morning of meetings and game films. It
ends around 5 p.m., following an al term >011
of weight training, on-field drills and strut
egv preparation.
This "normal guy, normal life" stuff
that Clark speaks of, however, can only go
so far. As Clark talked about the issue of
contracts he has a three-year deal val

ued at more than SI million interior de
fensive lineman Dana Stubblefield, the
NFI ."s sack leader, walked by. The vicious
pass rusher and run stopper, out of charac
ter wearing a svelte pair of golden slippers,
will in all likelihood make upwards of $6
million next season. What kind of normal
guy would even dream of making that?
And then there is the issue ot celebrity
status. During a pregame warmup with
rookie quarterback Jim Druekenmiller.
veteran tight end Mrent Jones and ( lark.
Steve Young received the majority of
cheers; but a small but rowdy group of kids
were obvious ( lark supporters.
Who knows? With a little luck. ( lark
might soon be competing for advertise
ments with Young.
As evidenced by two vicious hits on
Brent Jones during the Chargers game,
there is also a consider able element ol dan
ger in the Nil. that most "normal guys"
couldn't stomach. Jones, after going up to
catch a ball thrown over the middle, was
rocked by San Diego safety Rodney I lar
ris. A couple of plays later, he suffered an
other vicious blow.
Clark, who has started four games this

season when Jones was out with injuries,
expresses little fear. "Since you're going to
get hit anyway, you might as well go for the
hall," he said. Mis ft-loot-4, 262-pound
frame no doubt contributes to this feeling
of invincibility.
(lark h;is lived up to that philosophy,
catching every ball thrown his way. He
looks comfortable handling the ball and
isn't alraid to lower his head at the end of a
run to bowl through ;i couple of defenders.
Although he is most highly praised for
the exceptional blocking he has brought to
the 4 l )ers' revitalized running game, (lark
lias had his moments as a receiver. In a
home game against the ( arolina Panthers,
(lark had t wo significant first-down catch
es. A few games earlier. < lark had his first
touchdown catch against the St. Louis
Rams.
(lark acknowledged that he is "very
impatient'' and eager to be used more as a
receiver. With Jones soon to retire, it
seems to be only a matter of time before
Clark becomes one <>l Young's primary
targets. Hut for this season, the competi
tion looks tough.
Jerry Rice, who suffered a potentially

season-ending knee injury in the season
opener against I'ampa Bay. I<x>ked sharp
before the Chargers game. Rice was run
ning patterns at near-full speed and catch
ing balls with the graceful case one would
expect from the league's premier receiver.
With Rice's probable return. Jones
healthy, and wide receivers Terrell Owens
and J.J. Stokes making big plays, it seems
likely that ( lark will be used primarily as a
blocker during the rest of the season and
the playoffs.
( lark is not complaining. Although he
has greater aspirations, he is thrilled to
have been promoted from his earlier role
as a special teams player to become a valu
able component of the 44ers' offense, and
particularly ol their running attack. After
all, lie is only a rookie playing a difficult po
sition.
With the Wers cruising atop the league
with a 11-2 record, the Super Bowl doesn't
seem !<><> far out ol n ach. Clark certainly
would lather be employed as a receiver,
but Willi his excellent blocking abilities, he
just might be an unsung hero in a 44ers'
season lor the record books.
All in a day's work.
