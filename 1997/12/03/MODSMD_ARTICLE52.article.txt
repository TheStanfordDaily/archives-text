Most often, though, they're simply called

the Freshmen.
More specifically, they're Stanford's
largest men's water polo recruit class in a
decade, and perhaps one of its best.
And they all wanted toeome to the Farm
despite the unavailabilty of athletic scholar
ships.
"It's kind of lunny because I didn't have

any scholarships/* said Stanford head coach
Dante Dcttamanti. shaking his head in
wonder. "I had already |sct aside) nil the
scholarships. They're all considered
walk-ons because they didn't receive any
scholarships."
l or a group of walk -ons. the Freshmen

world.
Then there are the five drivers: Sean
McEachern. Colin Shaughnessy. I odd
Snider. Pasi I Hitton ami Blake Moblc\
As team captain at l.ong Heat h Wilson
High School, McFachern twice led his
squad to a ("alilornia Interscholastic Fedcr
ation championship, 112 or his efforts.
McFachern was voted a first-team ( II and
all-league perfot mer.
At ft-foot 2 and I SS pounds. Shaugncssy
was a three-time Junior Olympic All
American, a member of the USA national
youth team, a liist team all CM selection
and a two time all league selection.
If Shaugnessv. who hurls a blisteiing
right handed shot, is one ol the best shoot
eis m the freshman class. Snidet is definite

ly one ol the fastest swimmers.
A speed demon out of Fodi's I okay
High School, Snider also earned a spot on
the U.S. junior national team in addition to
being a liist team all (II and all league se
lection.
"lodd is very last," Dettamanti said.
"Whenever we do sprints . . he's probably
the fastest guy on the team in short sprints."
Originally a goalie. I Hilton now plays
the field. At Porterville High School, theft
foot-2. ISO pounder twice gained first team
all league honors and was also first-team
all-CIF.
Mobley, meanwhile, hails from a water
polo legacy. His older brother, senior Bret
Moblev. once plavcd loi the Cardinal. I lie
younger Mobley was a first team North
Coast Section all ( II player.
Rounding out the defense are Brady
Beaubien. Kendall Benson and Glenn
(iiokaris.
Beaubien. the younger brother of stand
out defenseman Fayne Beaubien. was a
first-team All-American and ( IF Player of
the Year at < 'oronado I ligh School.
Benson, meanwhile, is the only member
of the freshman contingent who didn't red
shirt this season. An I mpire Feague MVP
as a seniot in high school, Benson collected
five goals on the yeai.
I lie ft -foot F IMO pound (iiokaris.
meanwhile, was a lit si team all league sc
lection.

Mark Amott dominates the hole. As the
largest member ol the freshman class at 6-
foot-5, 205 pounds, his teammates simply
refer to him as "Monster."
As well as playing for the USA Junior
National and USA national youth teams,
Amott was ;i first-team Ail-American and
first teamall-Cir for two years.
I he freshmen squad, notorious for their
unity, first bonded over their recruit trip.
"The guys are so cool," Shaughnessy
said. "Il assured me that I'd made the right
choice.... All Ml of lis want to do stuff to
gether. None of us are probably going to
join a fraternity because it's kind of like we
have our own little one."
And if their high school accolades are
any indication, the I reshmen 10 will almost
certainly develop into one of the most for
midable water polo squads in the nation,
one that could vie lor an unprecedented
N( 'A A ( hampionship three-peat.
"We have the determination and we
have the talent," (iiokaris said. "And we
have the heart. And if we want it. we'll get
it. lust like anything in life."
For now, though, the recruiting class
dominates the statistics tabic during home
games.
I hc ultimate goal, however, remains fo
cused on the pool.
"If we're as good in the pool as we are at
the desk, we're going to win the NCAA
title," Mobley said.
