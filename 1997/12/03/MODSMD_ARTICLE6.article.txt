names have been < handed
for protection.

Someone yells. ' Don't touch that pipe! You
could get burned."
Many Stanford students have lived this
narrative by traveling beneath the campus
late at night using the underground steam
tunnels. I lie circular grates located in front
of Meyer Library and behind Memorial
( hurch are two ol the entrances that lead to
these underground hoi spots.
I he tunnels, constructed in 1891. carry
steam to various campus buildings from the
( ardinaK ogeneration Facility 011 the corner
of ( ampus I)rive and Via ( )rtcga. which gen
erates steam and electrical energy.

To enter the steam tunnels, one
would have to slide a manhole cover
that may exceed KM) pounds. Be
tween 10 and 15 miles of steam tun
nels lie beneath the campus. Some
tunnels have lights every few feet
hanging from the ceiling, while
other tunnels are shrouded in com
plete darkness. According to steam
tunnelers. the ground inside the tun
nels consists of dirt, grass, old leaves
and gravel.
Not much exists down in the
steam tunnels except high-voltage
cabling, pipes and a few entrances to
buildings around campus, but never
theless. students find something
very intriguing about these subter
ranean structures.
It is difficult to pinpoint when
the first Stanford students explored
the campus' underground world. A
few fraternities and sports teams
have traditionally made steam tun
neling a group pastime. Unfortu
nately, today's steam tunnelers are
lidding their freedom to roam un
tftrground limited, as many of the
tjjpiginal tunnels are being sectioned
(faf due to ongoing campus con
st uction.
C Students new to Stanford are
iljfk-n exposed to the steam tunnels
1$ those who have already traveled
tije underground route. When
/Hex. a freshman, arrived on cam
l|s, he was immediately ap
proached by an upperelassman who
iflHd him that steam tunneling was
something that all students must do
least once during their years at
Stanford.
£ "Steam tunneling feels so wrong

thiil you have to love it," Alex said.
"It's such a savage relief front nor
mal Stanford life."
Other students, having steam
tunneled once, vowed never to re
peat the tradition. Seniors Bonnie
and Catherine went underground
with a group of friends their fresh
man year and ended their adventure
in screams of terror.
"It was really hot and dark down
there, and I kept screaming for the
group to help me get out," Bonnie
said. "They had to move the grate so
|( atherine] and I could return to the
surface."
I he two seniors vowed to keep
their feet above ground in the fu
ture.
During Sophomore College this
year, Doug entered the tunnels
through a manhole located near the
History Corner in front of Annen
berg Auditorium.
"We were underground, and we
stumbled into a big open area."
Doug s;iid. "There was insulation,
electrical wires and wood on the
ceiling of the tunnel so we figured
that we were underneath a build
ing."
Doug climbed a ladder that led
toward a door in the ceiling.
"I opened up the hatch and all I
s;hv was a mop. brooms, and clean
ing utensils 1 was in a closet.
Ile lifted himsell into the loom,
opened the closet door, took two
steps, and heard the high-pitched
screams of an alarm.
"Instead ol running out ol the
front door ol what I presumed to be
the Foreign I anguage building, me
and the two guys I was with ran
through the tunnels. Ii was cramped
down I here so we got cuts and
scrapes I was scared that (here were

going to he people waiting for us at
the top of the tunnel."
I nek w;is on their side. Nobody
greeted the three explorers at the
surface.
After nearly three years of steam
tunneling. Eileen considers herself a
professional. Although steam tun
neling gear is not required, she and
her friends found it useful to wear
spelunking lights on their heads for
their night-time exploits.
I he junior stated a simple reason
why she continues to plunge under
ground.
"Palo Alto closes down, it's 2
o'clock in the morning—what else
are you going to do? It becomes a
ehoose-your-own-adventure where
the campus is what you make of it."
But adventure-seekers should be
cautious. Authorities are well aware
that students venture into the steam
tunnels and advise against the pas
time.
I he steam I unnels are only 4 to 5
feet high and 5 feet wide. Because
they ;n e considered confined spaces,
manager of utilities Steve Mischissin
said only trained personnel traveling
in pairs are allowed to enter with the
proper equipment, including hand
held radios.
"People can get seriously hurt
down there by the high-voltage ca
bling Di hot pipes," Mischissin said.
" I lie steam in the pipes is 360 de
grees I ahrenheit and if inhaled
could burn a person's lungs. There is
also the possibility of oxygen depri
vation."
Although Mischissin declined to
comment about the rumored mo
tion detectors placed at the en
trances ol the steam tunnels, he said
thiil security measures are being
taken to prevent trespassing.
