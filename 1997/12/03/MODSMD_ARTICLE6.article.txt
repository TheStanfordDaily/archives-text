I Jarkncss encircles vou as you crouch low
inthciunncl I'lic onl\ light vou can sec em
anates from your dim flashlight. You can
hear the dirt shift beneath your feel as you lilt
a hand to wipe the sweat from your brow.

Someone yells. ' Don't touch that pipe! You
could get burned."
Many Stanford students have lived this
narrative by traveling beneath the campus
late at night using the underground steam
tunnels. I lie circular grates located in front
of Meyer Library and behind Memorial
( hurch are two ol the entrances that lead to
these underground hoi spots.
I he tunnels, constructed in 1891. carry
steam to various campus buildings from the
( ardinaK ogeneration Facility 011 the corner
of ( ampus I)rive and Via ( )rtcga. which gen
erates steam and electrical energy.
