Stanford I Jniversity I .ibraries lias ac
quired a collection of intimate handwritten
letters originally belonging to the lainily ol
Nathaniel I lawthorne.
"It's an enormous coup," said I English
Prof, lav I liegclman. "Ninety percent ol
this has not been seen outside of the
|Hawthorne| lainily. Any scholar working
on Hawthorne and Ins circle will have to

conic to Stanford."
Noting that several majoi universities
were also interested in housing the docu
ments. William Mcl'heron, library curatoi
ol American ami Biitish literature, said Ik
was very happy with the acquisition
Stanford paid an undisclosed amount loi
the papers.

Sophia llawthoine "was an intellectual
and much more than just Hawthorne's
wife," said Fliegelman. "The letters
are a kind of literary art.
Fliegelman adds that they pro
vide a window into the
Hawthornes' daily lives together, as
well as the intellectual and cultural
life of Concord.
In one letter. Hawthorne de
scribes her feelings toward her tu
ture husband:
"Now when I know under the
same roof sits in his study my flower
of the ages, this bloom and crown of
time, whom I can at any moment re
fresh my eyes and heart by seeing
and commun.ng with — then 1 can
leave him for a little while and tell
those who are dear to me that I love
them still and am much more capa
ble of loving than ever before.... 1
congratulate myself that I shall be
that unheard-of person, a rested
bride. Everyone is marred, weary
and shadowy. But I shall be alto
gether renewed..."
In another letter, she contrasts
the ice skating style of her husband
with that of Emerson and Thoreau.
"Often other skaters appear ...
who principally interest me as foils
to my husband. Who, in the pres
ence ol nature, loses all shyness and
moves regally, like a King. . . .
Henry I horeau is an experienced
skater and was figuring.... Very re
markable but very ugly, we thought
... Mr. Emerson closed the line, ev
idently too weary to hold himself
erect."
She also wrote two detailed let
ters describing I lerman Melville,
who lived nearby in Pittsfield,
Mass., and Melville's friendship
with her husband.
"These letters provide new in
sight into maybe the most impor
tant American literary relationship
of the 1 c >th century," said Fliegel
man. referring to that between
Melville and Nathaniel I lawthorne.
The collection also includes var
ious letters received by the

Hawthorne family, including a re
view of "The Scarlet Letter" written
just 12 days after it was published in
1850.
"There are numerous [pub
lished] book reviews [from that
time period], but it's rare to find a
friend saying: 'I read your book and
this is what I think.' " said Fliegel
man. "And this isn't just any book;
it's 'The Scarlet Letter.' "
McPheron enthusiastically de
scribed the size and form of the col
lection — more than 1.0()0 pages of
handwritten documents as well as
several sketchbooks.
"At that time there were no en
velopes and no stamps, so the ad
dress was written on the outside of
the folded paper, along with an ink
stamp and the written price of the
postage," said McPheron, who also
noted that, to save paper, often the
page was not only filled horizontal
ly with text but also diagonally.
Also included in the archives are
about 250 pages of manuscripts by
Rose Hawthorne Lathrop. one of
the Hawthornes' three children,
written during the late l<X(X)s and
early 19(X)s.
In an unhappy marriage, she
separated from her husband and
converted to Catholicism.
"Many of these papers were
Rose's," said McPheron. "She
wrote a book on her parents' mar
riage."
Lathrop later became a nun. tak
ing the name Alphonsa, and found
ed a religious order to help victims
of cancer.
"Five books have already been
written on Rose Hawthorne, and
none explores the imaginative and
personal dimensions revealed by
the nearly 1 .(MM) pages of [handwrit
ten] material," said McPheron.
According to McPheron. the
preliminary opinion is that the pa
pers are in excellent condition.
After being processed and evaluat
ed. the documents will be available
in early IWB through the Depart
ment of Special Collections in
Green Library.
