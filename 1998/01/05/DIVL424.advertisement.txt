A cold is an infection of the
upper respiratory tract caused
by anv one of almost 200
different viruses.
Fortunately, you gradually
become immune to many of
the viruses that are common in
the environment. As you grow
older, you generally acquire
more immunity, and catch
fewer and less severe colds.
Stress, fatigue, and a poor diet
can increase your suscepti
bility to a cold.
Your symptoms depend on the
particular virus that is
responsible for your cold. They
may include:
■ A runny nose
■ Sneezing
■ Coughing
■ Sore throat
■ Congestion
Masai discharge is usually
watery at first, and then
becomes thick and greenish
yellow as the cold progresses
(this means the cold is about to
dry up).
You may also have a headache
and a slight fever, which mav
cause shivering and chills. But
a high temperature (over
101 R along with general body
aches are more likely symptoms
of the flu.
MM'
You don't have to go to extremes to
protect yourself from the flu us
these Stanford students did in your
great-grandpa rents' generation,
hut using some common sense
guidelines will ease the impact of
your cold or flu this winter.
The flu (influenza) is also
caused by a virus. It has
similar symptoms to a cold,
but they are usually more
severe, and come on quite
suddenly.
Outbreaks of flu usually occur
in winter or early spring, so
getting a flu shot in the fall
may prevent you from
becoming infected. The main
risk of flu is that the infection
may spread from the upper
respiratory tract to the lungs,
which could cause bronchitis
or pneumonia.
What to Do
Stay at home in isolation to
give yourself a chance to get
well (and so you don't infect
vour entire history class). An
ordinary cold clears up in five
to seven days; it may take a
week or two to fully recover
from the flu. Hut if your cold
lasts for more than ten days, or
your fever lasts for more than
three to four, call Medical
Services.
The following symptoms may
indicate something more than
a cold or flu, so consult a doctor
if you have:
■ A temperature over 102"F
■ Severe headaches
■ Pain around your eyes or
sinuses
■ Throbbing ear pain
■ Severely swollen glands
■ Close contact with someone
with strep throat
■ Wheezing, or pains in your
chest when you breathe
Treatment
There is no way to treat a com
mon cold or a flu, only ways to
treat the symptoms. Here's
what to do:
■ Stay at home in a warm (but
not overheated) room
■ Increase the moisture in the
air by using a vaporizer or
humidifier
■ Drink at least two quarts of
fluids every day
■ For relief of aches or pains,
aspirin or ibuprofen may help
(if you're not allergic to them)
■ Avoid multi-symptom cold
preparations (pick those
medicines that relieve only
the symptoms you have)
Treating the common cold or
tlu with antibiotics dtx'sn't help,
since viruses don't respond to
them, lust take good care of
yourself. It will pass.Q
