Microbiology & Immunology
Course Offering for Winter Quarter 1998
TOPICS IN MICROBIOLOGY, M&I 185
A lecture course dealing mainly with bacteria (with the exception of AIDS) on:
bacterial ancestry and relation with other life-forms; their biochemical versatility
and übiquity; molecular mechanisms for sensing and adapting to an ever-changing
environment; their contribution to elucidation of general biological principles; their
molecular engineering to construct a super-breed able to handle dangerous wastes;
and their emerging resistance that threatens to revive the old plagues.
Instructor, Matin. 3 units, MWF, 10:00—10:50 am, Medical Center M —110.
