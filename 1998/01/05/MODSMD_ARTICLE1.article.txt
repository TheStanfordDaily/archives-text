# TA review will go ahead
## Fac Sen approves measure in nearly unanimous vote 
### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
In an almost unanimous vote last month, the facul
ty senate decided to implement a mandatory teaching
assistant training program to insure uniform quality in
training throughout all University departments.
Religious Studies Prof. Hester Gelber, chair of the
senate's Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement, said that the record of "effective TA
training" in different departments showed "very un
even compliance."
" There was a lack of clarity about just how TA
training should be evaluated," Gelber said. "Model
training programs in various departments could defi
nitely help."
Provost Condoleezza Rice said TA training would
help graduate students prepare for their future.
"TA training is important in preparing graduate
students who might find themselves as unsuspecting
assistant professors at some university," Rice said.
" This is an extraordinary piece of legislation."
Physics Prof. Doug Osheroff said the Physics De
partment has a program that works very well.
"Every year I find 15 to 20 percent of my TAs need
retraining, so they are retrained and their teaching im
proves," Osheroff said.
The committee's investigation of the status of TA
training began after former ASSU senator and physics
doctoral student Doug Natelson urged the senate to
look into the issue.
Natelson, who was present when the faculty senate
voted to implement the system, said he was pleased
"that some mechanism is being put in place that regu
larly checks up on the status of TA training."
At the same meeting, the senate also discussed and
approved a change in faculty grievance procedures.
Provost Rice proposed the alteration in the Statement
on Faculty Grievance Procedure, which changes the
"point of entry into the grievance process."
For example, if a negative tenure decision is made
at the departmental level and the grievant is dissatis
fied with the outcome of the grievance, she or he may
appeal to the dean of the appropriate school, the
Provost, and to the Advisory Board and the Universi
ty President.
With the former policy, dissatisfied faculty mem
bers had to resubmit their grievances to an administra
tor at the level at which the first decision was made.
"(The old system] was problematic," Rice said.
"The grievance process could be extended many,
many months — if not years."
University President Gerhard Casper said "griev
ants should be given a speedier resolution of their
problem."
"Time plays a role in the fairness
of the grievance process," Casper
said.
At the meeting Casper also ex
pressed his concern for events sur
rounding thins year's Big Game. He
said "the performance on all sides
was poor." alluding to both a column
printed in Cal's newspaper, the
Daily Californian, as well as the
crowd's behavior at the game.
The column, written by Cal stu
dent Ciuy Branum, attempted to fos
ter school rivalry bv denouncing

Stanford students in a violent and
graphic manner. Casper, however,
said "it is a delusion of our time that
grossness and obscenity are the
same as satire."
"It is also a delusion," Casper
said, "that civility is less important
than epithets."
Casper, who said he has received
many letters from upset football fans
who were treated rudely, both at Big
Game and at the Notre Dame loot
ball game where the band's perfor
mance offended some viewers, said
"we are all accountable."
"The tone is wrong," Casper said.
"If we the universities in the I J.S. do
not manage to make rivalry friendly,
we should reconsider athleticism."
