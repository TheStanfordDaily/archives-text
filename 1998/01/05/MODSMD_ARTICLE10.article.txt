TEL AVIV, Israel (AP)
Bringing the government of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the
brink of collapse, Israel's foreign
minister angrily resigned yesterday,
saying he is "no longer a member of
this government."
A scowling David Levy bitterly
denounced Netanyahu's government
for both abandoning the peace pro
cess with the Arabs and ignoring the
mounting problems of Israel's poor
and unemployed.
The resignation of the Cabinet's
main supporter of the peace process
sent the government into a tailspin,
and Israel's TV and radio stations

went into an emergency regime of
all-evening talk shows discussing the
chances of early elections and the
possibility that the dovish Labor
Party would return to power.
Supporters gathered outside
Levy's home in the provincial town
of Beit Shcan. urging him to stick by
his decision and work to bring down
the 19-month-old government.
Making good on a threat he
issued Thursday, Levy had a letter ol
resignation delivered to Netanyahu's
office late yesterday. By law it
doesn't go into effect for 4N
meaning Levy theoretically could
still back down.

Netanyahu issued a statement
saying he regretted Levy's decision
and hoped 'he will change his mind."
At a news conference, the prime
minister said he believed his coalition
would prevail, and added that the
government was on the brink of
resuming the peace process and
"doing the right thing to bring about
a secure peace not just a peace on
paper."
Levy's threat last week to step
down — inspired by his dissatisfac
tion with an austere 1998 budget
was viewed with some skepticism:
He has made similar threats at least
six times since the current coalition

was formed in June 19%.
Netanyahu responded by delay
ing a vote on the budget — which he
can do for three more months be fort
his government falls — and figuring
out how to come up with a reportec
$HXI million in social subsidies foi
lower-income Israelis.
Hut Levy said yesterday thai
despite Netanyahu's efforts, he had
decided "the partnership had failed."
Hanan Ashrawi. a senior member
in the Palestinian Cabinet, said the
internal chaos in Israel's government
would likely delay the peace process
even as the United States is pushing
for progress.
