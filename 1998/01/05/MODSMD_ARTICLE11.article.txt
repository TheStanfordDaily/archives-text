## Editorial Water-logged campus

Ceaseless rain will cause
cause disruptions for all
that venture outdoors.

this editorial space served as a forum
to challenge University policies that
didn't sit well with the interests of students.
We've argued for a less lively dead week,
sought a taller bonfire, urged moderation in
pre-rtgistration proposals -and supported
housing reform.
We now make a plea to the administra
tion to reduce the rainfall on campus.
Rain is depressing. It makes biking dan
gerous. lawns muddy and hair wet. Outdoor
sports and sunbathing are out of the ques
tion. Schlepping to morning classes takes
even more discipline than usual in the chilly
drizzle. The dormitories become breeding
grounds for disease. And. of course, the
driving range is closed.
Students are not the lone victims of pre
cipitation. Faculty members, of tenured and
untenured varieties alike, and the I iniversi
ty staff must also suffer from the rain's
inconveniences.
Finally, we believe â€” and this is certain
to persuade several key administrators
that the rain has the unfortunate long-term
effect of reducing alumni giving. After all.
nobody wants to contribute to an alma
mater that allowed its graduates to be
rained on.
Why. then, does the administration
allow rain to happen? Despite extensive
research, the answer is still shrouded in
mystery.
As if the issue weren't frustrating
enough already, we've had a great deal of
trouble figuring out who actually makes the
decisions to hold rain at Stanford.
The minutes of the Faculty Senate were
not enlightening on this question; none of
its committees seem to be involved.
Inquiries at the Office of University Presi
dent (ierhard Casper were greeted with

chuckles and calls were transferred to an
answering machine at the School of Earth
Sciences.
We did not give up easily, though. After
a few weeks of badgering, a reliable source
in Old Union finally assured us that "[Uni
versity Registrar] Roger Printup has great
powers, but the ability to alter weather is
not one of them."
The Office of Student Activities also
denied all responsibility for undermining
the tradition of sunshine at Stanford, but it
has vowed to form a committee to begin a
search for viable alternatives to good
weather. Flustered and confused bv our
questions, an ASSU spokesperson mum
bled something about incompetent interns
and hung up.
As our attempts to pinpoint the rain
making University official failed, we decid
ed to follow a long-standing and reliable
rule of thumb: if in doubt, place the blame
squarely on "the administration."
With renewed momentum, our com
plaint became both clear and bold: once
again, the administration made a radical
decision without considering student views.
Its track record speaks for itself: first, the
tenure denials; then, a ban on food in Mem
Aud: now. rain.
Ending rain should become the new area
of organized student advocacy. A simple
and popular goal, it may even replace the
return of the bonfire as the campaign
promise that must be made by every aspir
ing candidate for the Office of ASSU Pres
ident.
At the very least, the rain question
should be put on the ballot for this spring's
general election. Once students demand
that the rain go away, it will be difficult for
the administration to do anything but com
ply.
Students must take a stand on an issue
that has the potential to impact classroom
performance and grades, a problem that
may jeopardize the success of outdoor
sports and increase injury to recreational
and organized athletes alike.
Stop the rain.
