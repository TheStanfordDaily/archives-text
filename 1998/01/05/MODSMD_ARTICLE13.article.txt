## Just do it? Conscientious consumerism 
### 
I WAS STANDING
in the kitchen when
our discussion
turned to footwear, and 1
received a compliment
from my friend on my
sneakers.
1 responded with

thanks and proceeded to rotate my foot for
further admiration. But when the maker's
emblem came in to view. 1 suddenly
blushed and explained. "I failed to notice
when I bought them that they're made by
Nike. Oops. I try not to buy Nike."
"Why?" my friend probed, raising his
eyebrows in reference to our earlier con
versation on conscientious consumerism.
"You know, they support the regime in
Burma," 1 began to explain, and then
caught myself. "Wait, that's Pepsi Co. Nike.
Hinm. Oh, yeah, sweatshops in Southeast
Asia."
Eyebrows now knitted, my friend ques
tioned, "Isn't it rather culturally imperialis
tic to assume that those workers in Indone
sia are unfairly compensated using Ameri
can standards? I would imagine that the
workers appreciate the jobs that Nike pro
vides."
I was stumped. Days later I happened to
listen to a radio show that explained that
the wages paid to Nike factory workers are
hardly enough to subsist by that cultures
own standards; plus, many workers have
respiratory problems caused by poor facto
ry conditions.
So I continue to feel guilty about my
shoes, because in general, I try to spend my
dollars responsibly. I buy organic produce
because it is ecologically more sound, I get

cruelty-free shampoo because its not tested
on animals, and 1 try to forego certain name
brands who allegedly employ questionable
labor ethics.
But I've come to believe that true con
scientious consumerism is an oxymoron. 1
once read a copy of a boycott monthly
newsletter only to realize that if I were to
participate in all the non-participation I
would have an empty closet, empty fridge
and empty garage. Not only Nike, but
Reebok and Adidas too — no tennis shoes
are safe. It's just impossible to consume
American quantities of stuff without hurt
ing someone or something.
I have a friend who, on his quest for per
fect non-violent living once worked on a
Buddhist organic farm. Every morning they
repeated in their prayers the Buddhist
tenet "I will not kill things." However, my
friend came to learn that the farm utilized
as fertilizer bone, hoof and blood meal
products of slaughterhouses. The hypocrisy
eventually compelled him to leave.
"I deduced," he told me, "that if you
don't want to kill anything you've got to kill
yourself."
Thankfully he decided that living non
violentlv by the suicide solution is egotisti
cal. unnatural and absurd. Instead he
became inspired by a line from"The Jungle
Book," that the law of the jungle is to take
what you need.
For a person so committed to simple liv
ing, my friend can employ that philosophy
without stepping on too many toes. For me,
the question of socially responsible con
sumerism is: How can I take what I need
respectfully?
Scrutinizing our choices can often lead

to befuddlement. My sophomore year I was
one of the few in my dorm who attended a
talk to educate residents about the grape
issue. Because of the complexity of the
United Farm Workers boycott, I left the
presentation far more confused than I had
come. I voted against serving grapes in our
dining hall, but it was not without many
reservations.
Everyone has to learn to draw the line
somewhere. 1 spend most of my days eating
only vegetarian foods and am often chided
by my carnivorous friends about the sorrow
of broccoli souls.
I have much less concern for the broc
coli than I do for the human-inflicted pain
that I am constantly reminded of in the
media. Watching the news or reading histo
ry books leaves me feeling overwhelmed
with hopelessness.
There are two ways to cope with the
reality of human suffering: either rational
nihilism or irrational compassion. The for
mer is easier, but the latter feels a lot bet
ter.
And the optimistic thing is that as caring
grows in popularity, it has the practical pos
sibility of becoming equally as economical
ly viable as exploitative labor.
My new year's resolution is to cultivate
compassion and the belief that I am con
nected to the global community in all things
that I do.
And no more Nike.
