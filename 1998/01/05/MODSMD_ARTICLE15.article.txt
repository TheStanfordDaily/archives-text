G.O.P. should think
about Latino voters
[More than a month] ago Stuart Spencer,
a high-profile Republican strategist, circulat
ed a memo to his Republican colleagues
about the urgent necessity for the G.O.P. to
reach out to Latino voters. "We are dramat
ically losing market-share of the fastest
growing segment of the electorate," warned
Spencer.
Republican leaders have plenty of reason
to worry. Not only are Latinos the fastest
growing group of new voters, in the last few
years. Latinos have begun to move further
away from the Republican party. In 1984.
Ronald Reagan garnered 50 percent of the
Latino vote nationwide, but Hob Dole could
muster only 22 percent in IW6. At the same
time. Latinos have made significant inroads
in the Democratic Party. In California alone
17 Latino Democrats, compared to just one

Latino Republican, sit on the state legisla
ture. including the speaker of the State
Assembly, and a Latino heads the state
Democratic Party. In Texas, two out of every
three new Latino voters register Democratic.
The source of Latino voters' unhappiness
with the Republican party stems from the
hard-line stances C'Â«.(). P. leaders have taken
on affirmative action, bilingual education,
immigration and student aid funding. Lati
nos as a group have been disproportionately
hurt by these and other Republican-spon
sored measures that overwhelmingly benefit
Americans who are wealthier than all but a
small percentage of Latinos.
Republican leaders are busy trying to
undo the damage their legislation has done
to their relationship with Latino voters. Newt
Gingrich, a staunch supporter of official
English laws, recently hired a full-time staffer
who will serve as his liaison to the Latino
community, and his office has begun printing
some press releases in both Spanish and
English. On the immigration front. Rep.

Lamar Smith has softened his tone after stri
dently advocating measures now considered
by (i.O.P. leaders to be Ux> harsh to sustain
Latino support.
The 1998 elections will no doubt indicate
how well these symbolic compromises have
ingratiated the Republican Party to Latinos.
Unfortunately for the (i.0.P., much more
than Latinos' pocket books has been hurt at
the hands of Republicans. Conservative
politicians across (he nation have affected
Latinos in a more personal way. Itiey have
disrespected Latinos' dignity. I remember
sitting in my dorm television lounge at Stan
ford with a group of friends in November
1994. days before Gov. Pete Wilson won re
election against Democrat Kathleen Brown.
A grainy black and white image of Mexicans
crossing the California border erupted onto
the screen with a message I will never forget.
"They keep coming." the announcer warned.
I was left dumbfounded and. quite frankly,
embarrassed. Perhaps Wilson intended
"they" to mean illegal immigrants in general

or Latino immigrants in particular. But for
me. the history of antipathy that many con
servative politicians have demonstrated
toward foreign- and native-born Latinos
made clear the real message of Wilson's ad. Ii
said to me "You and people like you are not
wanted here." In my mind, the "they" sin
gled-out by Wilson's ad includes not just ille
gal immigrants, but all Litinos who love this
country and seek only a fair opportunity to
succeed without being characterized by
opportunistic politicians as a threat to this
nation's stability. And I am convinced that
many Latinos share my sentiment.
Maybe the Republicans' fourth-quarter
sycophancy will sway enough Latino voters
to protect the (i.O.P. majority in Congress,
but unless Republicans adopt an agenda con
siderate of Latino viewpoints. Republican
candidates can count themselves out of our
house, the State House and the White
House.
