# Showering with the Boys
## Vanessa Bartsch Tortured flying in the unfriendly skies 
### 
NO. NO. NO, no, no. Please, no. I
actually crossed my fingers, praying
thai this beast would past right on
by. I watched its eerie eyes hone in above
me, then on me. It grunted and nodded.
The beast was a woman. Sort of. More a
giant mass of cloth and robes, hats and
parcels.
From somewhere under the mass that
she was, her hand appeared, dirty and
gnarled. She pointed at the window seat
next to me. "That's mine," she said.
It is the frequent traveler's worst night
mare. A full flight, a middle seat and a scary
neighbor.
I got up to let her pass. And into the win
dow seat she piled, not bothering to remove
any of the colorful scrapes draped over her
body. She stuffed her bags in with her feet
and mine and laid her red felt hat on top of
everything.
She was like a frightening combination
of Rainbow Bright and Jabba the I lull.
Her overabundant frame was actually
consuming not only the armrest we were to
share, but also part of my seat. I ler bags
were taking up all of her leg room and most

of mine.
Always get the aisle for a day flight so
you can stretch your legs and the window on
the red-eye so you can sleep with your head
against the wall. And, if you are especially
clever, or just anally punctual, you can fina
gle an exit row.
But the plane began to taxi and it was too
late to turn back. Before the lovely in flight
service technicians, or whatever they now
prefer to be called, had finished the lile-sav
ing instructions that we all ignore, the beast
next to me was sound asleep.
I relaxed a little and figured this was a
good thing. After all. the two flights before
I had been stuck next to a horn-again ( hi is
tian who spent a great deal of time asking
me if 1 had seen the love of Jesus. Then
there was the 300-pound plus mobile phone
salesman from Toledo who was kind
enough to share his marital problems and
sexual woes with me.
So, this woman's slumber seemed to be a
step in the right direction, and I took out m\
book. Then her head began the sleep
bounces that we early morning lecture
attendees know so well.

She jerked her head from side to side
until it ended up right on my shoulder. I
worked the shrug, but back it fell, again and
again. I hen she started snoring. Loudly.
As we reached cruising altitude, I felt
something wet and realized that she was
drooling on me. I his being too much, I
shook her hard. She groaned and rolled her
head mercifully toward the v\indow.
I figure this woman was m\ punishment
for relishing in three weeks of peace and
getting 10 hours ol sleep a night.
I should also mention that she smelled
obscenely awful. It turns out that she was
some sort ol Peruvian missionary and had
been living in a remote village for three
years.
I don't think she showered or washed her
clothes in those three years. But, I was
pleased that the stench and the snoring
could be shared by those around me.
I specially the darling young family
behind me. I hey took up an entire row. All
six seats. Yup, Mummy. Daddy and four
children all under the age of six.
Simone. seated behind me was having a
fabulous time kicking the back ol mv seat

while her brother was screaming at the lop
of Ins lungs lor no apparent reason â€” possi
bly because Ins other brother was playing a
very loud video game and not sharing.
I he eldest little knee-bitter, across the
way from me. had apparently won his par
ents' lull attention by making repeated use
of the barf bajj.
I he moment the pilot made that little
red seat-belt light disappear. I bolted from
my seat and looked for an empty seat,
preferably as far as possible from my cur
rent location I here were none.
I thought about spending the entire flight
in the lavatory, but realized that they prob
ably don't serve beverages in the 100.
Eventually I returned to my seat and the
live-hour flight continued. Next to me
Brunnhilde slept on. snoring and drooling.
Darling Simone kicked the crap out ol my
seat while her brother made noises.
A couple hours into the flight on this
tomb of death. "Free Willy II" came on. and
I actually watched it. It proved just what 1
needed, so boring that it fought against
Jabba and Simone.
1 slept until the man in the uniform

informed me that the plane eould not safely
land with my seat two inches behind the full
and up-right position.
As this was happening, the women
announced that if she "didn't get to piss in
about a minute," her bladder would
"explode." I jumped from my seat and let
her through.
She returned shortly apparently relieved,
toting two dinners and an entire carton of
orange juice. She ate as we began to
descend, until finally The Man came and
asked for her tray. She wouldn't give it to
him because she was "starving to death."
112 inally he wrestled it from her grasp, and
she made him promise he would save it.
And he did. As soon as the plane landed
safely on the ground he brought that tray of
dried cold chicken back, and she dug in as
the kids screamed on.
I have never been happier to see Califor
nia soil.

Vanessa Bartsch is a junior majoring in
music. She admits she's afraid of flying and
people, and she hopes you enjoyed yourself
over break.
