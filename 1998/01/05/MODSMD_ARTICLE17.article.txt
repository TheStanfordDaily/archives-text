## Men's hoops suffers key loss, remains unbeaten as conference play heats up 12-0 start dampened by four-week loss of forward Mark Madsen to foot injury 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
It wasn't pretty, hut it was pretty much what every
one expected from the men's basketball team.
Despite shooting only 38.6 percent from the floor,
the No. 7 Cardinal (12-0. 1-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
were able to shut down Oregon State's offense in a big
way on Saturday for a 68-48 conference-opening win in
Corvallis, Ore.
The Beavers (9-3,0-1) made only IK percent of their
field goals and shot a miserable 9 percent in the first
half. Their first field goal didn't come until Jerome
Vaden hit a three-pointer with 12:46 left in the first half.
The Cardinal led by as much as 23 and never let the
lead dip below 15 in the second half as its defense stifled
Oregon State.
"Going out and shutting people down, it's a chal
lenge," said Cardinal point guard Arthur Lee. who led
the team with 16 points and four assists. "Defense is a
huge part of this game, and when we're willing to play
it. good things happen for us."
Center Tim Young continued to improve from his
slow start this season, contributing 12 points, nine re
bounds and four assists. Small forward Pete Sauer
added 14 points and 12 rebounds.
Forward C'orie Benjamin led the Beavers with 15
points all of which came in the second half. Guard
John-Blair Bickerstaff added 10 points and six re
bounds.
The victory allowed the Cardinal to avenge an K6-77
upset Stanford suffered at the Beavers' hand last year in
Gill Coliseum, ruining the team's chances at a top-10
spot in the polls.
Stanford is off to its best start in 61 years, when the
team opened the season 14-0. It also gives the team a
chance to move up to No. 6 in the Associated Press poll,
the highest spot the Cardinal has held since Christmas

Day 1962. when Stanford was ranked No. 4.
"A 20-point win in this conference on the road is ai
awfully good start." said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "I was apprehensive about this game, frankly
They've got a great crowd, and Oregon State was 9~.
and gave [No. 4| Utah a heck of a ball game. But v\e be
came the aggressor earlv on and got after it defensive
lv."
