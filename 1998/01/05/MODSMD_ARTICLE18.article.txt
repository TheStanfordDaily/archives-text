# How Rosy will the Alliance future be?
## 
### 
F>r one sweet afternoon in front of 101.219 streaming fans, the Rose
Howl made a statement for the value of traditional rivalries.
The Big Ten against the Pacific 10: smashmouth running against the
West ( oast offense. I las it been a good rivalry? Since 1947. when the Big
Ten and Pac-10 champions started officially meeting in the Rose Bowl,
the series stands 27-25 in favor of the Big Ten.
Many people have finally gotten their wish for a college football cham
pionship. Beginning next year, a national title game will be held between
the two top teams in the nation, as decided by pull voters. I he No. I and
No. 2 teams will square off in one til the bowl alliance games — the Rose,
the Sugar, the Fiesta or the ()rangc. Hach year the championship game
will rotate among these four bowls.
Yes. a national title game will give us a clear-cut champion, and will
end these loathsome co-championships I bet the Michigan Wolverines
aren't thrilled that they had to share their title with Nebraska, and if it had
been 1999, then a contest between these two schools would have set the
record straight.

But I'm not convinced that a title game is the best thing since sliced
bread. Sitting in the stands before the game, I couldn't help but relish the
atmosphere in Pasadena. As a die-hard Michigan fan. I felt the goose
bumps as the band played "The Victors," and I smiled as I observed the
sea of Michigan faithful who had made the trek out to Southern (Califor
nia.
Then 1 looked to the other side, l ens of thousands of Washington
State fans created a deafening roar as the Cougars took the lield. It
seemed like every one of them had at least one red pom-pom and a dozen
"Go Cougs!" signs written all over their bodies.
A sellout crowd, and yet not one California team played in the game.
And these were not corporate snobs who brought their clients there to
schmooze. The folks sitting in the stands on either side of the stadium had
one purpose: to \v •11 their team to victory.
Who could blame them'.' Washington State had not played in the Rose
Bowl in 67 years, and had not scored a touchdown in the (iranddadtly of
them all in 82 years, while Michigan was on the cusp of winning its first
national title in 50years. I his was literally a once in a lifetime occurrence.
When the Wolverines finally kicked ol'f to begin the N4th Rose Bowl,
a frenzied electricity ran through the place. On every play. I either
moaned or screamed, and everyone around me. both Michigan fans and
Washington State fans, did the same. Watching at home, you might have
thought that the first half was a boring 7-7 stalemate. But sitting in the
stands, each play seemed to bring you a step closer to victory or defeat.
The second half offered the excitement and unpredictability that
makes college football so wonderful. I was so nervous I could hardly
stand it. I didn't dare leave my seat to get a hot dog. First if all. my stom
ach may not have been able to take it.and secondly, we were packed in
st) tightly on bleacher style benches that 1 was afraid my seat would dis
appear if I left.
There was Washington State quarterback Ryan Leaf proving why he
is the best quarterback in the country (sorry Peyton Manning), while
Heisman trophy winner Charles Wotxlson showed vthv he is the best
player in college football.
There were lead changes, strategic coaching decisions, a desperation
drive that nearly spoiled Michigan's title aspirations and controversy at
the end due to the officiating. Ami surprisingly enough, although 1 cat
was the best signal caller in the na
tion this year, he was only the sec
ond best quarterback in the Rose
Bowl. Unheralded Brian Ciriese
threw three touchdown passes and
made big plays, including an 11-
yard run on third down that sus
tained Michigan's last drive and
kept the ball out of Washington
State's hands.
So there you have it — drama
suspense, intrigue and unpre

dictability. Sure, kits of writers and
fans speculated about how great it
would have been if Michigan could
have played Nebraska. But could
anything have really topped the
game that the Rose Bowl deliv
ered?
1 think not. The bowl alliance
will offer a clear-cut champ, but it
will also disrupt some great tradi
tions.

Ben Hur, one of the football heat
writers, can now die in peace having
seen Michigan win a national cham
pionship. However, he's still won
dering about that "Rosy future."
