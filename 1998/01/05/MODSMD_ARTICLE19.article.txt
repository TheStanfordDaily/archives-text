# On a roll
## Stanford sweeps Oregon schools to get over .500 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
The No. 15 Stanford women's basketball
team got off on the right foot with its first week
end of conference play.
The Cardinal (5-4. 2-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) recorded its 47th consecutive conference
v\ in. moved above .500 for the first time this sea
son and quite possibly settled its backcourt con
troversy once and for all.
After Friday's 93-66 win over ()regon State
the question of the backcourt was even more
questionable. Sophomore Milena Flores did a
lot to secure her position as the starting point
guard by scoring 15 points and recording seven
assists to just one turn ner.
The Beavers (5-6.0-2) hung around for most
of the somewhat sloppy first half, but Stanford
went on to outscore Oregon State by 20 in the
second period. Flores scored on several driving
layups and was able to distribute the ball to her
teammates in the transition.
Hut Flores' counterpart in the backcourt,
sophomore Melody Peterson, did not fare as
well. Peterson had just one assist and five
turnovers in only 17 minutes of play.
Mut Peterson came off the bench to redeem
herself in yesterday's game against Oregon. In
fact the entire squad had a better showing yes
terday before 4,816 fans at Maples and a ( BS
television audience. Stanford used a late first
hall run and built on the lead in the second to se
cure a 97-72 win. its 21st straight over Oregon.
I he Ducks (5-5. 1-1) held on throughout
most of the first half and even had a one-point
lead 24-23 with 7 minutes. 9 seconds remaining
in the half after a 16-footer by junior guard Na
talie Hughes.
But the Card went on a 17-6 run over the
next 4 minutes, M) seconds, getting easy buckets
from Folkl and Scott .is Stanford pulled to a 40-
30 lead on a three-point basket by Nygaard with
2:38 remaining.
"I thought we played well for about IS min
utes," said ()regon head coach Jod\ Kunge.

"After that 1 don't know if we're not in shape or
just didn't play hard.''
In the second half Stanford was able to capi
talize on Oregon's foul trouble in the post, and
the Ducks just didn't seem to have enough to
keep up. The ('ardinal's transition game picked
up. and Stanford was able to get some easy bas
kets as it stretched the lead to 17 over the first 1
minutes of the half.

I"I think [our running) wears people down
I a little bit." said Stanford head coach lara
VanDerveer. "When they're not in position
: we're getting good shots You're not going to
■ come out the first two minutes and get
layups."
As the game wore on. Flores and Peterson
stepped it up in transition, combining lor 16 of
the Card's 24 assists (11 and five, respectively).
But the play of the game came Flores con
nected with Peterson in the open court. With
5:10 remaining Flores tossed up a floater from
the right side. Peterson went up on the left,
caught the pass two-handed and then kissed it
off the glass before coming down, giving Stan
ford a 26-point lead.
"I thought it was a really gix>d game lor our
team," VanDerveer said. "We didn't turn the
ball over; I thought that was a real key.'"
VanDerveer described the stat sheet as pret
ty. Scott led the way with 25 points and a career
high 16 rebounds, both game highs, while N\
gaard and Folkl both added 16 points. Peterson
scored 13 off the bench, and Mores added 10 for
her second double-double,
i More importantly Stanford totaled just 12
turnovers compared to 24 assists and outre
hounded the Ducks 45-25. Freshman forward
