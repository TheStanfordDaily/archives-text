# Volleyball wins record fourth title
## After two early losses to top-seeded Penn State, Cardinal finally gets Nittany Lion off its back 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
SPOKANE. Wash. — Twice before the Stanford
women's volleyball team had faced Penn State. Twice
before, the Cardinal had lost.
Stanford fans were quick to point out that All-Amer
icans Lisa Sharpley and kerri Walsh were injured at the
time, but in both losses the simple fact was that the Car
dinal had been dominated in the middle.
And when the two teams met in the national cham
pionship match, everyone gave the Nittany Lions an
edge at the middle blocker position. Stanford had expe
rience and powerful outside hitters on its side, but with
All-AmericansTerri Zemaitis and Lauren Cacciamani.
Penn State would be able to control the middle.
At least that's what most people said. Hut when the
national-title rematch started it was clear that someone
had forgotten to tell Stanford seniors Paula McNamee
and Barbara Ifejika that they were outmatched as mid
dle blockers.

McNamee notched the first point of the match and
led the Cardinal to a dominating 15-10 performance in
game one. The senior had a .500 hitting percentage on
six kills in that game and added three block assists.
Senior outside hitter Kristin Folkl also had six kills,
and Ifejika added four on a .429 percentage. Meanwhile
the Nittany Lion duo of Zemaitis and Cacciamani had
five kills combined and hit .083 and .167. respectively.
"I think the first two times we played Stanford our
middles outplayed theirs." Penn State head coach Russ
Rose said after the match. "Today the opposite was
true. That's what national championships are about."
At the close of game two it looked as though the na
tional championship would be a rout. Stanford cruised
to a 15-6 game-two win as McNamee and Ifejika domi
nated. Seven more kills from McNamee and five more
lor Ifejika moved their totals to 13 and nine, respective
ly, while both hit over .500 (.579 and .538). McNamee
also had a solo block to go alone with five block assists

Women's volleyball players mob the court after winning their NCAA-record fourth national title.
So while the teams spent intermis
sion in the locker rooms discussing the
match, the national media was scram
bling to find out more about the all but
unknown McNamee and Ifejika.
Ifejika was a four-year starter with
impressive career numbers; it's puzzling
iH) one knew who she was. Then there
was McNamee — a fifth-year senior
(rare enough bv Cardinal standards)
who played high school volleyball in
Wheaton. Md. Surely that was a 'mis
print.
Of course it wasn't, but that wouldn't
be cleared up until the post-match press

conference where head coach Don
Mi tw shed some light on the situation,
I iughingat the fact that most of the play
t is in the matches on McNamee's re
cruiting tape served underhanded.
Paula had not had the opportunity
i util this year to get in there and get a lot
(t name time," Shaw said. "She got a
t lance to be our starter at the beginning
(I the year, and she's developed as the
\ tr went on. She's always been one of
iui hardest workers, and she's one of
(in leaders. It's great to see her go out in
. blaze of glory like she did."
But even with McNamee blazing
tnrough the Final Four, the Stanford
team went dead in game three. Ifejika

built her hitting percentage to .(MM), and
McNamee added another kill. Hut Ze
maitis and Cacciamani began to warm
up, and the Cardinal was ineffective in
game three.
Altera 15-2 win in that game, the Nit
tany Lions fell behind in game four. And
that is when Zemaitis and Cacciamani
temporarily took over the match. Ze
maitis posted 12 kills in game four alone
and Cacciamani added nine as Penn
State pulled out an incredible 17-15 win
to send the match to the fifth and decid
ing game.
The biggest play of Ifejika's career
may have come at 10-5 in the final game
of her volleyball career. Ifejika and se

nior setter L.isa Sharpley combined on a
tremendous block and followed it with a
celebratory leap that seemed to put any
lingering doubts about the Cardinal
middle to rest, ("acciamani and Zemaitis
were able to add a few more kills in the
game, but the day (and the match) be
longed to Stanford and its middle block
ers.
"You couldn't ask for a better time to
have the match of your career." Folkl
said of Ifejika and McNamee. "Had
those two not played as solidly as they
did we wouldn't have won the national
title. It's obvious [Ifejika] is one of the
most underrated players in the entire
country, and 1 think, she showed
why she should be more recog
nized."
lfejika posted a career-high 16
kills on a match-best hitting
percentage to go along with four
block assists and 14 digs. McNamee
finished with 20 kills, also a career
high. i)n a .372 hitting percentage

and added six total blocks as she
was selected to the All-Final Four
team.
"This is what I've been looking
forward to for the last five years,"
McNamee said. "The other cham
pionships were nice, but 1 was on
the bench. Being out there when
we actually won the point, I didn't
know what to do. 1 just stood there
for a second and absorbed all the
excitement around me. It was ab
