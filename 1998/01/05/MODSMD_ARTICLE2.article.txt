# Volleyball wins record fourth title
## After two early losses to top-seeded Penn State, Cardinal finally gets Nittany Lion off its back 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
SPOKANE. Wash. — Twice before the Stanford
women's volleyball team had faced Penn State. Twice
before, the Cardinal had lost.
Stanford fans were quick to point out that All-Amer
icans Lisa Sharpley and kerri Walsh were injured at the
time, but in both losses the simple fact was that the Car
dinal had been dominated in the middle.
And when the two teams met in the national cham
pionship match, everyone gave the Nittany Lions an
edge at the middle blocker position. Stanford had expe
rience and powerful outside hitters on its side, but with
All-AmericansTerri Zemaitis and Lauren Cacciamani.
Penn State would be able to control the middle.
At least that's what most people said. Hut when the
national-title rematch started it was clear that someone
had forgotten to tell Stanford seniors Paula McNamee
and Barbara Ifejika that they were outmatched as mid
dle blockers.

McNamee notched the first point of the match and
led the Cardinal to a dominating 15-10 performance in
game one. The senior had a .500 hitting percentage on
six kills in that game and added three block assists.
Senior outside hitter Kristin Folkl also had six kills,
and Ifejika added four on a .429 percentage. Meanwhile
the Nittany Lion duo of Zemaitis and Cacciamani had
five kills combined and hit .083 and .167. respectively.
"I think the first two times we played Stanford our
middles outplayed theirs." Penn State head coach Russ
Rose said after the match. "Today the opposite was
true. That's what national championships are about."
At the close of game two it looked as though the na
tional championship would be a rout. Stanford cruised
to a 15-6 game-two win as McNamee and Ifejika domi
nated. Seven more kills from McNamee and five more
lor Ifejika moved their totals to 13 and nine, respective
ly, while both hit over .500 (.579 and .538). McNamee
also had a solo block to go alone with five block assists
