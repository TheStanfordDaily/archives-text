# Folkl's play not the only plus in team's surge

### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
It was a statistic that jumped right
out of the Sunday sports section and
almost made one choke on their
morning coffec.
1 he San Jose Mercun News ran

a letter to the editor yesterday in
which a Stanford women's basket
ball fan |H)inted out that when red
shirt junior forward Kristin Folkl
was on the court against Colorado
Dec. 2K. Stanford outscored the Bul
faloes by 35 points Hut when she
was sitting on the bench. Colorado

Ux>k it to the Caul by more than 20
points The impact is obviously re
markable. considering the fact she
was eight days removed from win
ning a national championship in vol
leyball.
Hut while her return has coincid
ed with the 15th tanked Cardinal's

(5-4.2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) cur
rent three-game winning streak,
there has been more to Stanford's
resurgence than just one player. The
potential shown during the first six
noneonference games (thev led at
the half of every game) has finally
started to come together, as post
players such as senior center
Olympia Scott have asserted them
selves, which has allowed the inex
perienced backcourt to work on
their nagging turnover problem.
"Obviously, they're a good
team," said Oregon head coach
Jody Runge. "I thought their guards
played very steady and very well
tonight. Obviously, they're young
and they're just going to get better."
A national television audience
saw a Stanford team that bore little
resemblance to the team that self
destructed in the second halves of
games against Wisconsin, Purdue,
Tennessee and Connecticut. In fact,
when Stanford stretched its lead to
87-61 on an amazing alley-oop pass
from guard Milena Flores to fellow
sophomore guard Melody Peterson,
fans watching at home must have
wondered if the team's 4-4 record
was a typo.
Taking center stage once again
was Scott, who once again hit dou
ble figures in points (25) and re
bounds (a career-high 16). The Nai
smith player of the year candidate
has been averaging 25 points in the
past three games, making those
early-season foul-plagued contests
a distant memory. Meanwhile, Folkl
quietly had 16 points on 6-of-6
shooting while tearing down six re
bounds.
Clearly, they were outclassing an
Oregon frontline that was sorely
missing sophomore center Jenny
Mowe, who has sat out all but four
games due to tendenitis in her right
knee. However, it's one thing to see
the advantage; it's another to actu

ally follow through on it. Oregon
should know — last season at home,
they were unable to beat an injury
plagued Stanford team that boasted
Scott as its only viable post option.
Then again, not many teams can
bring the power and finesse in the
post that Folkl and Scott can pro
vide.
With the clear dominance down
low, the beleaguered Stanford back
court was able to put together one of
its finest efforts, leading the team to
a season-low 12 turnovers. Flores
put together her second double
double (10 points, 11 assists) in four
games, while only turning the ball
over twice. Peterson, coming off a
poor performance against Oregon
State, did not commit a single
turnover on her way to 13 points and
five assists.
"It's great," said senior forward
Vanessa Nygaard of the guard play.
"I think [Flores) again had a great
game and [Peterson] is very, very
talented. They're finally coming
into their own. It's so much more re
assuring with all that, it seems like
we have a new team."
So is the team ready to take the
Pac-10 by storm? Well, the games
were at home, where they are prac
tically unbeatable. But Stanford has
proven its mettle on the road, as
shown by its 13-point win at then-
No. 5 Illinois three weeks ago — and
that was without Folkl.
With key conference road games
at lOth-ranked Arizona and No. 8
Washington on the horizon, Stan
ford will have ample opportunity to
display its resurgent frontline and
maturing backcourt, thus allowing
them to return to its place atop the
conference standings, a spot it has
not relinquished since the 1993-94
season.
It was a statistic that jumped right
