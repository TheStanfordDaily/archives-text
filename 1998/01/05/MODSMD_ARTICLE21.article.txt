# Spikers earn Final Four berth by sweeping regional at home
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
The road to the Final Four went straight through
Maples Pavilion for the Stanford women's volleyball
team, with the Cardinal hosting both regional and sub
regional action in early December.
Maples was home to Stanford's early round matches,
and the (Cardinal won all three of its contests there to ad
vance to its fourth consecutive Final Four. The most ex
citing of those matches, and perhaps the most thrilling of
the year at Maples, was the Regional Final between
Stanford and then-No. 5 UC-Santa Barbara.
I he matchup between the top two seeds in the Moun
tain Regional proved to be an intense battle with both
squads displaying unbelievable defense through the first
two games. Stanford squeaked out wins in both games,
15-12. but not without tremendous effort.
" I hey were definitely tough" said senior middle
blocker Barbara Ifejika. "We expected a battle, but it
was like there was no tloor on the other side. They just
kept digging it up. I credit them for great defense and not
really giving up."
But IJCSB couldn't sustain the intensity, and the Car
dinal rolled in game three. 15-3. Walsh and Folkl led the
attack, posting 16 and 19 kills, respectively. Walsh added
a match-high 18 digs and three other Stanford players
notched double-figure dig totals as the seniors played in
Maples for the last time in their Stanford careers.
" I think we're all just really happy that we can re
member our last match at Maples as this one." said se
nior setter Lisa Sharplev. "I think that was one of the
best volleyball matches that I've seen or played in. It was
such a battle the whole way. I'm so proud of our team for
playing so well."
Stanford plaved amazinglv well throughout the tour

nament. After receiving a first-round bye, Stanford
faced Oklahoma in the second. The contest was a re
match of a Sept. 19 match the Cardinal won in three (15-
12,15-10. 15-6).
1 lowever, even with the straight-game loss, the Soon
ers managed to post the third-highest hitting percentage
by a Stanford opponent this season, the other two com
ing in Cardinal losses to Penn State. This time. Okla
homa was not as successful.
Stanford jumped on the Sooners from the start, tak
ing game one 15-2. Oklahoma put up more of a fight in
games two and three (15-6 and 15-7) but were held to a
season-low .010 hitting percentage for the match.
"You've got to give Stanford a lot of credit," said Ok
lahoma head coach Miles Pabst. "They completely shut
our middles down tonight. There's no question they
were ready to play: they just handled us."
Notorious for her NCAA tournament performance,
Walsh led the way for Stanford with a match-high 15 kills
and .500 hitting percentage. Sophomore outside hitter
Jaimi Gregory contributed 10 digs for the exceptional
Cardinal defense which outblocked Oklahoma 10-3.
"I thought our players did a great job carrying out the
game plan." said head coach Don Shaw. "I'm very satis
fied with our defensive effort. It was a much easier match
this time around."
The Mountain Regional Semifinal was also a rematch
from the regular season. Stanford beat No. 20 Colorado
easily 15-10. 15-4. 15-4. in the Stanford Showcase Sept.
20. But this time the Buffaloes gave Maples fans a quick
scare, jumping out to a 4-0 lead and forcing a Stanford
timeout.
But that's just about all Colorado would get, as the
Cardinal allowed just seven points over the remainder of
the match, winning 15-7, 15-3, 15-1. Folkl led the way
with a .542 hitting percentage and 14 kills. As a team
Stanford outhit the Buffaloes .442 to .091 and were only
blocked by Colorado twice.
"It's just us being ready, being able to execute and
make adjustments in our defense," Shaw said. "These
players are adjusting well, making the changes. I haven't
always had teams that were able to adapt when we make
a quick switch during a timeout or even between serves.
This team does that very well."
Once Stanford got past the competition at Maples it
was on to Spokane, Wash., for the national semifinal.
That meant a match against AVCA National Player of
the Year Misty May and the No. 2 seeded but top
ranked Long Beach State.
In game one Long Beach ran out to a 9-4 lead behind
sophomore outside hitter Veronica Walls, who finished
game one with five kills and a .625 hitting percentage.
Stanford's only answer was senior middle blocker Paula
McNamee who posted identical numbers to Walls while
the Stanford team was held to a then-season-low .048
hitting percentage for the game. Long Beach won the
game 15-9. becoming the first team to take a game from
the Card in the tournament.
"It wasn't one of our better matches," Shaw said.
"But I think Long Beach had a lot to do with that."
The Cardinal's offense woke up, and Stanford took
games two and three 15-10 and 15-4. The Card was all
smiles after jumping out to a 12-3 lead in game four as
Stanford seemed to be easily headed for the champi
onship game. But the 49ers didn't give up. going on a 10-
1 run and pounding their way back to a 13-13 tie.
Ifejika's serve, which was responsible for four of
Stanford's season-high 10 service aces, forced match
point, but Long Beach answered with two points of its
own and pushed to 15-14 on a kill by junior middle block
er Benishe Dillard. That's when Folkl took over, record
ing two kills and a solo block. Stanford ended the match
17-15 on a block by Walsh and freshman middle blocker
Jennifer Detmer.
"We were rolling; things were going well." Shaw said
of the team's lead. "They upped their game. You get in
that position and you might ease up a little. But Long
Beach played outstandingly in that stretch. I give them
credit for that."
