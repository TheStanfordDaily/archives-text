# Sharpley goes out in style
## Senior co-captain quietly ends career with a bang 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Senior Lisa Sharpley looks com
pletely comfortable sitting in the
hallway of the team's hotel just one
night before the start of the Final
Four in Spokane, Wash. She talks
quietly and confidently about her
team's prospects in the champi
onship. and you can tell this whole
experience is nothing new for the
Ail-American setter.
That's because in Sharpley's four
years on the Farm, the co-captain's
team has never missed a Final Four.
And Sharpley has been there for
every one, calling plays and guiding
the power-fueled Cardinal offense
to four Pacific 10 Conference titles
and three national crowns.
"It's amazing," Sharpley said. "I
couldn't have asked for more than to
get to go to the Final Four every
year."
So she's been here before, and
you can tell she's comfortable with
her position as the leader of one of
volleyball's top collegiate programs.
But one thing you probably didn't
notice this year was the pain Sharp
ley endured in her left knee.
Sure, we all remember how
Sharpley hobbled around the court
in the Aug. 22 loss to Penn State, but
that was early in the year. She kept
playing, and the team was very suc
cessful. Sharpley kept racking up as
sists, and everything looked com
pletely normal in the matches. We're
all certain our three-time All-Amer
ican setter recovered from that knee
thing completely.
However, what we didn't know
about were the hours of therapy and
the numerous pain medications
Sharpley endured all year. Or per
haps we didn't see the bulky knee
brace she wore everywhere but in
matches. None of us sat in on prac
tices to witness Sharpley riding a sta
tionary bike rather than participat
ing in blocking drills, and none of us
noticed the times during matches
when Sharpley would favor that
knee ever so slightly.
"It's an extra thing to think about,
and it's been really frustrating to
miss so much practice." Sharpley
said. "To have something affect your
whole season is very difficult. I had
to just hope that by game time it
would feel OK. It was frustrating,
and I think maybe it affected my
game. But once I got on the court I
just hoped that 1 would be able to
think about the game and do what I
could."
What else would we expect from
a three-year captain who's provided
nothing but exceptional play and
solid leadership from the first day
she stepped on campus? We defi
nitely wouldn't consider the possibil
ity that Sharpley was cut from the
first team she ever tried out for. But
back in the sixth grade Sharpley and
her best friend decided they wanted
to play for the Bay Club volleyball
team, and Sharpley's mom. Cheryl.

took the two to the tryout.
"We showed up in sweats and
didn't even have knee pads." Lisa
Sharpley said. "Everyone else did.
and my mom told us to learn him to
serve while she went and bought us
knee pads. So we tried to improve
our skills during warmups."
Sharpley was crushed w hen her
friend made the team and she did
not. but fortunately her volleyball
career didn't end there. Sharpley's
parents saw how important volley
ball was to her and looked into some
of the other teams in the area.
Seven years later Sharpley was a
highly touted freshman for Stanford.
She was dubbed the second-highest
recruit in the nation behind team
mate Kristin Folkl.and the setter did
not disappoint in her rookie cam
paign. Sharpley was one of three
starting freshmen that year and
helped guide Stanford to a 32-1 sea
son that concluded with a national
title.
And things just got better after
that. The sophomore jinx didn't exist
for Sharpley, as the setter was
named one of three captains on the
team and earned first-team All-
America honors that year. Sharpies
hit .311 and posted 860 assists in the
Cardinal's 6-2 offense, but the
team's ultimate goal of a repeat
championship was stopped short
with a loss to Texas in the semifinal.
"Looking back, that's one of the

Sharpley said ot the loss "It made us
want it so much more the next year,
and it made it worth so much more.
Now we all fulls understand how
hard it is to win. Even if you have all
the talent, it doesn't matter it you
don't put the work in."
The Cardinal worked extra hard
that spring and returned to the 19%
season with a vengeance. Sharpies
had made a name lor hersull at> uik
of the top setters in the nation ami
was beginning her first year as Stan
ford's lone setter. The result was ;in
astounding success as the Cardinal
won its third national title and
Sharpies posted the third-highest
single season total for assists (1.433)
in Stanford histors
But try to compliment her and an
unassuming Sharpies will just tell
you that assists are a misleading sta
tistic. She tries her hardest to be the
typical, unheralded setter, but her
numbers are iust uh> impressi\e for
that. With 1.27>s assists this season
Sharpies moved her career total to

"It's an honor to be recogni/ed

childhood like Wends Rush, ( irrie

said. "Hut it's a misleading statistic. I
