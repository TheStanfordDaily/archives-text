# Blumberg, Nobelist and discoverer of hepatitis virus, spends spell on Farm

### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
From the South American rain
forest to the Farm, Baruch Blum
berg has brought his revolutionary
approach to discovering a virus.
Blumberg won the 1976 Nobel
Prize in Medicine for his discovery of
the hepatitis B virus and for his stud
ies of variation in host response to
the virus, a liver disease that every
year kills more people than AIDS.
At the time he received the
award, it was not realized that he and
his colleague, Irving Millman, had
also discovered the first vaccine for
the disease.
Arriving on campus in January,
Blumberg worked at the Center for
Advanced Study in Behavioral Sci
ences. This quarter he is teaching
Human Biology 158: "Epidemics,
Evolution and Ethics" as the Loekey
visiting professor.
Before his Stanford arrival,
Blumberg was searching for a cure

for cancer, working at the Fox Chase
Cancer Center in Philadelphia for 25
years.
"Medicine is really demanding,"
said Blumberg, originally trained in
clinical medicine. "It takes over your
life. You are constantly faced with
the pressure to make the right deci
sion. But research is different, it is
more removed and there is constant
ly something new to do. This is the
reason I eventually chose research.
Its an exciting life."
Born in New York City in 1925,
Blumberg attended Union College
in Schenectady, N.Y., where he re
ceived a bachelor's degree in
physics.
After a year of graduate training
in mathematics at Columbia Univer
sity, he went on to receive his med
ical degree in 1951 from Columbia
University.
He also participated in research
on rheumatism and sickle cell ane
mia in the Department of Biochem
istry at Oxford University. From his

research at Oxford on the sickle cell
anemia trait. Blumberg realized that
genetic variation was responsible for
the differences in human response to
various infectious diseases.
Blumberg later applied this prin
ciple to his research on an Australian
antigen that was isolated from the
bodily fluids of African, Eskimo and
Native American populations. The
antigen was initially isolated from an
Australian aborigine.
From these fluids. Blumberg iso
lated certain proteins and estab
lished that the Australian antigen
was responsible for the differences in
these proteins. This antigen turned
out to be the coat protein for the he
patitis B virus.
Blumberg is now working on a
book about his discovery of the he
patitis B virus.
Blumberg's interest in science
began in elementary school with en
couragement from his uncle, who
was a mathematics teacher. "He was
my first intellectual influence," said

Blumberg. In high school he wanted
to be an engineer. He said this was
probably a result of the "phenome
nal public high school education"
available in New York.
" There were three Nobel prize
winners from my school, and it
wasn't even a well-known one,"
Blumberg said.
Despite his present occupation.
Blumberg said his life was not all sci
ence. Because of his interest in geog
raphy, history and literature, he said,
"I wouldn't consider myself a com
plete techie."
"Scientists are extremely stxial
people that are constantly traveling
around." Blumberg said contradict
ing the common view of "lab rat" sci
entists who are aloof and distant
from the rest of the world.
"Science is very performance
based." Blumberg said. "There is a
built-in protection of the system, the
constant retesting of theories and ex
periments. showing that in the long
run, merit is what counts."
