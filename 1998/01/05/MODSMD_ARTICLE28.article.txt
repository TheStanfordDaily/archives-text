As it stands, basketball games are
40 minutes long, not 20. The Cardi
nal is 3-4 in nonconference play and
currently ranked 15th in the nation.
But the potential of the 1997-98
squad is evident from the flashes of
brilliance it has displayed even
briefly in all of its games.
When you consider that Stanford
has not trailed at halftime in any
game this season the possibilities
seem astounding. But then again,
with a 3-4 nonconference record so
do the pitfalls.
After starting the season 1-3, the
Cardinal found itself in a must-win
situation against then-No. 5 Illinois
Dec. 14. Stanford responded with a
resounding victory and impressive
performances from its senior big
guns, center Olympia Scott and for
ward Vanessa Nvgaard.
Scott had 26 points on 8-of-12
shooting, while Nvgaard was 9 of 15
for 24 points, including 4 of 6 from
three-point land. The backcourt of
sophomores Milena Flores and
Melody Peterson managed a total of
32 points, and as a team Stanford
only turned the ball over 18 times.
Even zero production from the
bench couldn't stop the Card as Illi
nois went down 91-78.
"One of the things is that I go with

the people that have produced in
games," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. The lack of bench
scoring "definitely concerned me.
They're practicing well, but we need
more bench scoring. 1 know Kristin
[Folkl] will help us when she returns."
In the Honda Elite Four Classic
Dec. 21, in Orlando, Fla., the Cardi
nal jumped out to an impressive 30-
19 lead against Connecticut. But
Naismith Player of the Year candi
date Nykesha Sales brought the
Huskies charging back.
The senior forward scored a
lavup with 7 minutes, 58 seconds left
in the first half that sparked six unan
swered points and led to a 14-3 run
by Connecticut to tie the game at 33-
33 with 3:34 left in the first period.
Sales was phenomenal all night
for the Huskies, scoring a Connecti
cut-record 46 points on 18-of-27
shooting, including 6 of 7 from be
hind the arc.
"It was just a great shooting night
for me," Sales said. "The way we
moved the ball on offense got me a
lot of open shots."
But for most of the game Stan
ford had the answer to Sales. Senior
forward Heather Owen led the Card
with 21 points while Scott added 14
and Nvgaard 12. Sophomore guard
Milena Flores had a double-double
with 10 points and 12 assists, and
with 4:33 remaining and a six-point
deficit, Stanford seemed to be gain
ing momentum with a defensive stop
that created a shot clock violation.
But following a Husky timeout
the Cardinal fell apart. Connecticut
went on a 10-0 run over the follow
ing two minutes, pushing their lead
to 16. where it remained for the 94-
78 final.
"We're not going to win any
games turning the ball over 30
times," VanDerveer said. "It's a
credit to UConn's defense and an in
dication of our lack of experience.
But I hope it's something our team
will improve on."
The Cardinal's Dec. 28 home
game against then-No. 16 Colorado
marked the return of Kristin Folkl

from the national championship vol
leyball squad and the resurfacing of
the guard controversy. Despite 28
turnovers, Stanford played one of its
better games of the season, beating a
tough Buffalo team 87-73.
Scott led the Cardinal offense
with a career-high 33 points on 11-
of-14 shooting and 11 of 18 from the

line. Nygaard added 11 points to go
along with a game-high 12 rebounds,
and Folkl was impressive in her bas
ketball debut scoring 16 points and
adding eight boards.
"I felt really good," Folkl said. "1
always have a big rush of adrenaline
right before 1 go in, and as usual my
teammates were extremely helpful."
