# Stanford tops Penn State for NCAA championship
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
SPOKANE, Wash. — All year long the Stanford
women's volleyball team hoped the NCAA tourna
ment would bring a rematch with Penn State.
The Cardinal's only two losses were at the hands of
the Nittany Lions, and Stanford wanted revenge for its
only two blemishes of the year. But when the tourna
ment bracket was announced Nov. 30 the Cardinal re
alized that in order to get its shot at the Nittany Lions
both Stanford and Penn State would have to advance
to the national championship match.
Suddenly the rematch Stanford had longed for had
a lot more riding on it than hurt pride from two previ
ous losses.
It meant everything.
It would be the last match — the one with just two
teams left. Both teams fight it out to the very end. One
goes home crushed, the other as national champions.
For Penn State a win would be the school's first na
tional title, for Stanford a record fourth. A win would
also give the Cardinal its 2Kth consecutive victory and
a 33-2 overall record, both school bests.
But whatever the outcome, the national champi
onship promised to be an incredible match, and it did
not disappoint.
The Cardinal jumped out early, and just over an
hour into the match Stanford looked to be cruising to
its first back-to-back titles. Senior middle blockers Bar
bara Ifejika and Paula McNamee led the Cardinal
charge with a combined .563 hitting percentage and 22
kills through two games.
Senior co-captain Kristin Folkl added nine kills
from the outside hitter position, and Stanford charged
to an early two-game lead. 15-10 and 15-6.
"We dug ourselves such an early hole." said Penn
State head coach Russ Rose. "We were fighting uphill
most of the time. I thought we played hard, but you
have to credit Stanford. We were outhit. outblocked
and outdug."
The national championship seemed just at hand,
but the Nittany Lions would not be turned away so eas
ily. Stanford was-near htelrsv in game three, hitting a
season-low .030 in that game to Penn State's .484. The
Nittany Lions edged back into the match with a 15-2
win.
That set the stage for some of the most exciting vol
leyball in NCAA history. Stanford grabbed the first
three points of game four as Ifejika put down the 12th
of her career-high 16 kills and then combined for
blocks with Folkl and senior setter Lisa Sharpie).
Stanford crept out to an 8-4 advantage thanks to
sophomore outside hitter Sarah Clark, who posted five
of her career-high 18 kills in that game. But Penn State
senior middle blocker Terri Zemaitis. who finished
with a match-high 25 kills, almost
single-handedly kept Penn State in
the match.
The Nittany Lions tied the score
10-10 and took their first lead of the
game 11-10 on a kill by Zemaitis.
Both teams played exceptionally
and the score went back and forth
with ties at 11.12 and 13.
A double touch call on the Nit
tany Lions presented Stanford with
its first championship point, but Penn
State denied that point and one more
before tying the score at 14-14. The
Nittany Lion block came up with a
point for a 15-14 lead, but Zemaitis
hit a ball long for the tie at 15-15.
After an exchange of sideouts

Penn State was able to string consec
utive points together for the 17-15
game-four win to send the match to
rally scoring in the fifth and final
game.
"That was women's college vol
leyball at its finest," said Stanford
head coach Don Shaw. "We came
out flat in game three, but after game
four I just thought what a great game
it was. Both teams had over SO at
tempts in that one game. These two
teams have played matches this year
where we haven't had that many
swings. It was just a classic."
So after more than two hours of
play, things were all even. Stanford
got the jump early when, at 1-1,
Sharpley went over with the dump.
Folkl followed with a kill, and Folkl
and McNamee combined on a block
for a 4-1 advantage. That lead never
shrank, and the Cardinal pulled
ahead K-3 on another of Folkl's 22
kills.
A dink from Folkl gave the Card
its third championship point 14-9,
and then guess who got the call on

match point. For the 1,833 rd time in
her Stanford career Folkl got the
kill, rattling this one down through
the block for the national champi
onship.
" This by far is the best champi
onship I've been in," Folkl said.
"This one was a total team effort. It
was such a battle, and the crowd was
so into it. It just made it feel like a
very special event. Plus as a senior,
you always want to win your last
match and go out 011 top."
