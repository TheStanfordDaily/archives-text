SPOKANE, Wash. — All year long the Stanford
women's volleyball team hoped the NCAA tourna
ment would bring a rematch with Penn State.
The Cardinal's only two losses were at the hands of
the Nittany Lions, and Stanford wanted revenge for its
only two blemishes of the year. But when the tourna
ment bracket was announced Nov. 30 the Cardinal re
alized that in order to get its shot at the Nittany Lions
both Stanford and Penn State would have to advance
to the national championship match.
Suddenly the rematch Stanford had longed for had
a lot more riding on it than hurt pride from two previ
ous losses.
It meant everything.
It would be the last match — the one with just two
teams left. Both teams fight it out to the very end. One
goes home crushed, the other as national champions.
For Penn State a win would be the school's first na
tional title, for Stanford a record fourth. A win would
also give the Cardinal its 2Kth consecutive victory and
a 33-2 overall record, both school bests.
But whatever the outcome, the national champi
onship promised to be an incredible match, and it did
not disappoint.
The Cardinal jumped out early, and just over an
hour into the match Stanford looked to be cruising to
its first back-to-back titles. Senior middle blockers Bar
bara Ifejika and Paula McNamee led the Cardinal
charge with a combined .563 hitting percentage and 22
kills through two games.
Senior co-captain Kristin Folkl added nine kills
from the outside hitter position, and Stanford charged
to an early two-game lead. 15-10 and 15-6.
"We dug ourselves such an early hole." said Penn
State head coach Russ Rose. "We were fighting uphill
most of the time. I thought we played hard, but you
have to credit Stanford. We were outhit. outblocked
and outdug."
The national championship seemed just at hand,
but the Nittany Lions would not be turned away so eas
ily. Stanford was-near htelrsv in game three, hitting a
season-low .030 in that game to Penn State's .484. The
Nittany Lions edged back into the match with a 15-2
win.
That set the stage for some of the most exciting vol
leyball in NCAA history. Stanford grabbed the first
three points of game four as Ifejika put down the 12th
of her career-high 16 kills and then combined for
blocks with Folkl and senior setter Lisa Sharpie).
Stanford crept out to an 8-4 advantage thanks to
sophomore outside hitter Sarah Clark, who posted five
of her career-high 18 kills in that game. But Penn State
senior middle blocker Terri Zemaitis. who finished
