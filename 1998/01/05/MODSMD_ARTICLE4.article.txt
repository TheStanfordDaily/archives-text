### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
While most Stanford students
spent their winter vacation sleeping
late and watching TV, members of
Talisman a cappella group spent
part of theirs a little differently. Tal
isman presented a series of concerts
in Washington D.C. from Dec. IK
-20. including a private performance
for the First Family.
President Clinton first heard Tal
isman sing at Stanford at a dinner
during Orientation in September.
He was so impressed with their in
ternational mix of music that he ex
pressed a desire to have the group
sing at the White House Christmas
festival. Talisman followed up on
the President's casual invitation by
sending letters to the White House,
and received a formal invitation in
November.
All 16 members of the group
flew to Washington for the concert,
the first part of which took place
during a reception for Secret Ser

vice agents.
"We sang in a wide open area,
which had a huge C hristmas tree, a
big buffet of food, and very nice
acoustics," said Talisman member
Nalini Calamur. a freshman. "We
stood on the stairs that led to the pri
vate quarters, but the secret service
was very vehement about not let
ting us stand on the top step."
The group sang for about 40 min
utes during the reception, after
which they were ushered into a
nearby room to meet the (lintons.
"We were in this small room
w here it was just us, a photographer,
tne social secretary, the Secret Ser
vice agents, and the First Family,"
said sophomore Lanita Morgan.
Talisman's business manager.
After a round of handshakes and
photographs. Clinton asked Talis
man to sing "Amazing Grace" for
him.
"Fortunately, that is a song that
we've been singing this year, so we
were prepared." said Morgan.
