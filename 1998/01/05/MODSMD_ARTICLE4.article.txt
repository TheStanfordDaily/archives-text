## Talisman performs at the White House 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
While most Stanford students
spent their winter vacation sleeping
late and watching TV, members of
Talisman a cappella group spent
part of theirs a little differently. Tal
isman presented a series of concerts
in Washington D.C. from Dec. IK
-20. including a private performance
for the First Family.
President Clinton first heard Tal
isman sing at Stanford at a dinner
during Orientation in September.
He was so impressed with their in
ternational mix of music that he ex
pressed a desire to have the group
sing at the White House Christmas
festival. Talisman followed up on
the President's casual invitation by
sending letters to the White House,
and received a formal invitation in
November.
All 16 members of the group
flew to Washington for the concert,
the first part of which took place
during a reception for Secret Ser

vice agents.
"We sang in a wide open area,
which had a huge C hristmas tree, a
big buffet of food, and very nice
acoustics," said Talisman member
Nalini Calamur. a freshman. "We
stood on the stairs that led to the pri
vate quarters, but the secret service
was very vehement about not let
ting us stand on the top step."
The group sang for about 40 min
utes during the reception, after
which they were ushered into a
nearby room to meet the (lintons.
"We were in this small room
w here it was just us, a photographer,
tne social secretary, the Secret Ser
vice agents, and the First Family,"
said sophomore Lanita Morgan.
Talisman's business manager.
After a round of handshakes and
photographs. Clinton asked Talis
man to sing "Amazing Grace" for
him.
"Fortunately, that is a song that
we've been singing this year, so we
were prepared." said Morgan.
The Clintons robustly cheered
the performance and thanked the
group warmly for coming.
"We knew he was in a rush, hut
he took time out for us," said Cala
mur. "It was really nice of him."
After the concert, Stanford fresh
man Chelsea Clinton took the
singing group on a brief tour of the
West Wing of the White House.
Overall, the group was very im
pressed with both the White House
and its inhabitants.
"It was really nice, beautiful in
side, and we all really enjoyed it,"
said Morgan. "[The Clintons] were
very very nice, really really accom
modating, it was just so much fun."
While the group was in Washing
ton. Talisman also sang at a Stanford

Alumni party held in the atrium of
the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts.
The group also performed at
Union Station, Washington's train
station / shopping mall.
But perhaps Talisman's most en
joyable performances, according to
Morgan, were their impromptu ones
throughout Washington, including
on subway trains.
"People would start to clap and
smile right there on the Metro, in
their business suits," said Morgan.
Talisman financed their trip
through compact disk sales, concert
revenue and private donations.
"We managed to raise enough
for the air fare, and Stanford in
Washington put us up for free, so we
were able to make this trip with
hardly any individual expense on
the part of the members," said Mor
gan.
