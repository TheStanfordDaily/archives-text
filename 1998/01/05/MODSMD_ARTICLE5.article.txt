# Fink studies issues of doctors in wartime
## Medical student travels to Sarajevo conference 
### Megan Fuller-Deets 
When Sheri Lee Fink, an eighth-year M.D.
/Ph.D. student in neuroscience. submits her
doctoral thesis to the School of Medicine this
spring, she will have more than a medical de
gree under her belt. Having recently returned
from a week-long trip to Sarajevo, Bosnia, she
will have an experience many potential doctors
never dream of.
The trip, funded by a grant irOm the Center
for Biomedical Ethics, was a pilot for a longer
study Fink hopes to carry out on the ethics sur
rounding doctors during war.
"I think it's important that as future doctors
we are aware of the issues surrounding doctors
during war," Fink said.
Fink listed three principal reasons for the
trip. First, since war destroys health, doctors, as
professionals committed to preserving health,
need to understand the effects of war. Second,
many survivors of war emerge severely trau
mati/ed; this trauma is something that needs to
be understood and treated. Finally, doctors
must understand biomedical ethics and inter
national law when operating in wartime situa
tions.
During the trip Fink attended a conference
at the University of Sarajevo on dtvtors in
wartime situations. Phe conference, organized
by medical students at the I Jniversitv. featured
members of the Red Cross and other interna

tional health organizations, but more impor
tantly. Bosnian doctors who had lived through
the three-and-a-half year siege of Sarajevo.
"The performance of Sarajevan doctors
during the war was simply amazing." Fink said.
"They risked their lives dail\ when others left
the city."
During the siege. Fink said there was no
gasoline for the ambulances, so Sarajevan doc
tors set up tiny clinics all over the city to treat
people w ho had been injured by shells and col
lapsing buildings.
In other situations, prisoners from the be
sieging force were brought to dtvtors. who
were obliged by their oaths to treat them re
gardless of whether thc\ were fated to be exe
cuted.
In addition, dtvtors had to protect these
prisoners from soldiers on their own side Ac
cording to I ink. one doctor told the stor\ of
being forced to protect a captured sniper, who
had just killed ;i six-year-old child on a street
corner.
"We never learn about the duties of doctors
during war." Fink said "Under international
law [doctors] are entitled to protection b\ the
law but only under very specific conditions.
And we can't dispute breaches of international
law it we don't know what they are."

Sheri Fink, an M.D. Ph.D. student, has traveled
to Bosnia as part of her interest in the problems
surrounding doctors in wartime.
ccnt war in Bosnia there have been
severe breaches of medical ethics,
including doctors being forced to of
ficiate at the tortures of prisoners
and develop new ways to kill pris
oners.
"Medical ethics in war is an im
portant educational consideration,"
said Stephen Rothenberg, also a
medical student. "The study of pos
sible explanations (for medical war
crimes) is an important part of pre
venting these crimes in the future."
Both Rothenberg and F ink are
members of Students Against
Genocide, a student organization
that works to increase awareness of
human rights violations throughout
the world and organizes political
demonstrations on important is
sues. Fink said that through SAGE
she first became aware of human
rights abuses and the fact that doc

tors were an important part of the
issue.
"It really woke me up to the fact
that these abuses existed and that
there was something we could do
about them," she said.
One of the most inspirational
moments of her trip. Fink said, was
attending a LJ2 concert in Sarajevo,
the first open-air concert since the
siege ended. Despite the fact that
there is still open conflict in many
parts of Bosnia, the audience, who
came from all areas of the country,
mingled without conflict.
"People were going on with their
life," Fink recalled. "It made me re
alize how resilient people are and
how worthwhile it is to fight against
war."
Fink is currently applying to var
ious foundations for a grant to trav
el back to Bosnia next year and con
tinue her study. She hopes to travel
to other regions of Bosnia and get a
more in-depth look at the role of
doctors during war.
