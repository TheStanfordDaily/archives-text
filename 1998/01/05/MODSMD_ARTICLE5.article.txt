## Medical student travels to Sarajevo conference

When Sheri Lee Fink, an eighth-year M.D.
/Ph.D. student in neuroscience. submits her
doctoral thesis to the School of Medicine this
spring, she will have more than a medical de
gree under her belt. Having recently returned
from a week-long trip to Sarajevo, Bosnia, she
will have an experience many potential doctors
never dream of.
The trip, funded by a grant irOm the Center
for Biomedical Ethics, was a pilot for a longer
study Fink hopes to carry out on the ethics sur
rounding doctors during war.
"I think it's important that as future doctors
we are aware of the issues surrounding doctors
during war," Fink said.
Fink listed three principal reasons for the
trip. First, since war destroys health, doctors, as
professionals committed to preserving health,
need to understand the effects of war. Second,
many survivors of war emerge severely trau
mati/ed; this trauma is something that needs to
be understood and treated. Finally, doctors
must understand biomedical ethics and inter
national law when operating in wartime situa
tions.
During the trip Fink attended a conference
at the University of Sarajevo on dtvtors in
wartime situations. Phe conference, organized
by medical students at the I Jniversitv. featured
members of the Red Cross and other interna

tional health organizations, but more impor
tantly. Bosnian doctors who had lived through
the three-and-a-half year siege of Sarajevo.
"The performance of Sarajevan doctors
during the war was simply amazing." Fink said.
"They risked their lives dail\ when others left
the city."
During the siege. Fink said there was no
gasoline for the ambulances, so Sarajevan doc
tors set up tiny clinics all over the city to treat
people w ho had been injured by shells and col
lapsing buildings.
In other situations, prisoners from the be
sieging force were brought to dtvtors. who
were obliged by their oaths to treat them re
gardless of whether thc\ were fated to be exe
cuted.
In addition, dtvtors had to protect these
prisoners from soldiers on their own side Ac
cording to I ink. one doctor told the stor\ of
being forced to protect a captured sniper, who
had just killed ;i six-year-old child on a street
corner.
"We never learn about the duties of doctors
during war." Fink said "Under international
law [doctors] are entitled to protection b\ the
law but only under very specific conditions.
And we can't dispute breaches of international
law it we don't know what they are."
