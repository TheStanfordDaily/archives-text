Balloonist braves winds
ST. LOUIS (AP) — Steve Fos
sett's quest to become the first to
pilot a balloon around the world
nonstop was in jeopardy yesterday,
plagued by low winds and heater
malfunctions that left him shiver
ing in his cockpit.
It is "very unlikely" Fossett
would complete his trip, Alan
Blount, mission control director,
said yesterday afternoon.
"Steve is very c01d.... I honest
ly don't know the duration of this
flight," Blount added.
The announcement came at a
news conference hours after Fos

sett's two vital heaters went out
and he appeared to be headed
toward the north side of the Black
Sea over Russia.
"Steve is going to make the ulti
mate decision " Blount said.
Blount said there was "serious
discussion" yesterday morning
between the mission control team
and Fossett about executing a
landing. "Obviously we didn't
want to do a trip to Moscow,"
Blount said.
The team believes Fossett
could continue traveling eastward,
rather than looping north, which
would put over the very southern
tip of Russia.
