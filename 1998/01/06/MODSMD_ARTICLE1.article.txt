# Two win Marshalls
## No Stanford students win Rhodes 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
Two Stanford history majors will get a chance to take
their talents across the Atlantic as recipients of Marshall
scholarships.
Senior Mark Bell and Alison Post, Class of '97, as
Marshall scholars from Stanford, will receive two years
of education in the British school of their choice, cour
tesy of the British government.
"I think it speaks highly of the preparation the Histo
ry Department has given us â€” the ability to think criti
cally about the past but also be relevant to the present,"
said Bell.
Post also credits the History Department in helping
her attain the Marshall scholarship. "The history under
graduate program is extremely strong and both chal
lenges and nurtures its undergraduate students," said
Post.
History Department professors are equally compli
mentary of the Marshall scholars. "Mark [Bell] shows
freshness and enthusiasm in his work, and he also shows
intellectual maturity and real accomplishment." said
Prof. Norman Naimark, History Department chair and
Bell's adviser.
"Alison [Post] is really the Stanford model of apply
ing academic research to real world problems," said His
tory Prof. Jack Rakove, Post's adviser. Rakove has
known Post since her sophomore year when she ap
proached him asking for extra readings.
Both Marshall scholars also studied at Stanford in
Oxford and credit that experience with sparking their in
terest in England. "I really had fun in Oxford, and I real
ly wanted to be back in England," said Bell.
"Hopefully studying in England will challenge some
assumptions about the U.S. because of the contrast it
presents," said Post. Both Post and Bell said they look
forward to living in England.
"The idea is that these students will be lifelong am
bassadors and friends of the United Kingdom," said
Kevin Cook, vice consul lor information at the British
Consulate General in San Francisco.
Despite their similarities. Bell
and Post will pursue very different
endeavors in the United Kingdom.
Post is currently working at the
Haas Center for Public Service as
South Bay program developer. In
England, she hopes to continue her
urban development work bv study
ing regional and urban planning at
the London School of Economics.
Currently a senior at Stanford.
Bell will spend his next two years at
the University of Sussex. He plans to
further study the relationship be
tween religion and revolution.
Another major scholarship pro
gram that sends Americans to
British universities is Oxford Uni
versity's Rhodes Scholarship, but no
Stanford student garnered a Rhodes
Scholarship this year.
The success of Post and Bell did
not carry over to Rhodes applicants,
but John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center, says it
is not because Stanford was lacking
in quality applicants.

"With all due respect to the last
few years' applicants, I thought this
year we had a stronger core group of
applicants than 1 had seen in the last
three to four years." said Pearson.
It has only happened in two of the
last 17 years that no Stanford student
has received a Rhodes scholarship.
It also is an atypically disappoint
ing year for California Rhodes appli
cants in general. This is the first year
since 1904 that no Californian from
any institution has received a
Rhodes Scholarship.
A total of 36 Stanford students
applied for Marshall and Rhodes
scholarships.
Students' receiving British schol
arships is serious bragging rights for
Stanford. "It is a test of the academ
ic strength of the institution," said
History Prof, Peter Stansky.
During televised football games,
the University advertises the num
ber of Marshall scholarships and
other notable awards given to Stan
ford students.
Students wanting to add their
name to the list of Stanford British
scholarship recipients should start
work in spring. Applications for
both the Rhodes and Marshall schol
arships are due in early fall.
