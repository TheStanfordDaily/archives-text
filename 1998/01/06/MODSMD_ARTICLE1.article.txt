## No Stanford students win Rhodes

Two Stanford history majors will get a chance to take
their talents across the Atlantic as recipients of Marshall
scholarships.
Senior Mark Bell and Alison Post, Class of '97, as
Marshall scholars from Stanford, will receive two years

"I think it speaks highly of the preparation the Histo

Post also credits the History Department in helping
her attain the Marshall scholarship. "The history under

freshness and enthusiasm in his work, and he also shows
intellectual maturity and real accomplishment." said
Prof. Norman Naimark, History Department chair and
Bell's adviser.
"Alison [Post] is really the Stanford model of apply
ing academic research to real world problems," said His
tory Prof. Jack Rakove, Post's adviser. Rakove has
known Post since her sophomore year when she ap
proached him asking for extra readings.
Both Marshall scholars also studied at Stanford in
Oxford and credit that experience with sparking their in
terest in England. "I really had fun in Oxford, and I real

"Hopefully studying in England will challenge some
assumptions about the U.S. because of the contrast it
presents," said Post. Both Post and Bell said they look
forward to living in England.
"The idea is that these students will be lifelong am
bassadors and friends of the United Kingdom," said
