## Gingrich plots future of GOP 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Plot
ting a GOP course for the IWX
election year and beyond. House
Speaker Newt Gingrich urged year
ly tax cuts and an all-out assault on
illegal drugs and had schools. I le
also proposed a commission to
address Social Security's looming
financial crisis.
In a sign of possible clashes
ahead. President Clinton warned
hours later that he would fight any
plans that might bring back big fed
eral deficits. As he did. he
announced that the fiscal 19W bud
get he will unveil next month will
show a surplus — three years ahead
of the schedule set by last summer's
budget pact and 30 years after the
last federal black ink.
Gingrich, R-Ga., told the Cobb
County Chamber of Commerce in
his home distriet yesterday that it
would probably take 10 to 12 years
for policy-makers to Imllv address
the goals he established. Even so,
Gingrich's speech underlined
Republican efforts to immediately
take the offensive on new issues.

now that their decades-old quest
for a balanced budget seems about
to be achieved.
"We're on the edge, if we will
have discipline, of a generation of
surpluses," Gingrich said. He added
later, "The time has really come for
talking about a generation of goals.
What should we do over the next
generation?"
The speaker said the primary
goal should be a budget that stays
balanced. But he also said surpluses
should be used to create ;i drug-free
country, improve schools and make
education available to more people,
reduce Americans' tax burdens and
strengthen Social Security and
other retirement systems.
All the while, he said, GOP
efforts to shrink government should
continue.
Gingrich's remarks contained
few specific legislative suggestions
or price tags. Spokeswoman
Christina Martin said his ideas
probably would be incorporated in
hills this coming congressional ses
sion. which begins Jan. 27.
