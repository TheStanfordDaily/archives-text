SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)
Theodore Kac/vnski ignored the presence in
court yesterday of his mother and brother,
neither of whom he had seen in 12 years, then
delayed the start ol his trial by protesting his
lawyers' attempts to portray him as a mad
man.
I lie IJnabomber defendant strode in. sat
down and startled the jammed courtroom by
blurting out a demand to read a speech.
"Your honor, before we begin. I would
like to read something I've written." Kaczyn
ski said in a raspy, nasal voice. "It's very
important. I want to revisit the relationship
with my attorneys."
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr.
quickly ordered a closed-door meeting with
Kac/vuski and his lawyers, excluding the
prosecution. Alter meeting for nearly five
hours. Burrell then delayed opening state
ments until at least Thursday. They had been
scheduled for yesterday morning.
kaczynski showed no reaction to the pres
ence of his brother, David, and his mother,
Wanda.
But a source who spoke on condition ol
anonymity said later Kaczynski was unhappx
to see the brother who had first tipped the
FBI to the possibility he was the Unabomber.
Another source, though, said the brother's
presence was a minor issue and that the
defense conference with Burrell focused
almost entirely on Kaczynski's future legal
representation.

Kaczynski's mother and brother wept at
their first sight of the defendant, wearing a
cream-colored, crew-neck sweater and hold
ing a nianila folder under his arm. David held
his mother's hand tightly as tears streamed
down his face. Mrs. Kaczynski bowed her
head and sobbed.
Kaczynski stared straight above their
heads, then turned his back, sat down and
addressed Burrell.
Kaczynski added that he would have
stood up to address the judge, but "1 haven't
stood up because I'm under orders from the
marshals not to stand up."
Laurie Levenson. associate dean of Loy
ola University Law School in Los Angeles,
said Kaczynski's outburst was predictable,
that one would expect him to try to wrest con
trol of the case at some point.
"This is his big moment and he wants to be
the producer, director and the star — which is
pretty scary when your life is on the line." she
said.
Unless Burrell can rein him in. Levenson
said the judge risks a mistrial or reversal on
appeal.
"If you end up with a new lawyer who's
not prepared to go ahead, and you don't have
a jury that's able to hang around and wait, you
have a mistrial," she said.
Burrell has held several closed-door hear
ings with the defense in recent weeks, releas
ing few details, saying the matter is a private,
attornev-client issue.
