Zapatista National Liberation Front (FZLN) masked supporters occupied Mexico City's Radioactivo radio station
yesterday for several hours, demanding that they broadcast a taped message from the Zapatista rebels. At the same
time, other demonstrators blocked the Mexican stock market in Mexico City's capital.
