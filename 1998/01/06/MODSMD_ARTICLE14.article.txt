### 
ALBUQUERQUE. N.M. (AP) — As two other halloonists
ponder their untimely return to Earth, another balloon is ready
to rise from New Mexico in yet another attempt to fly nonstop
around the world.
Balloon pilots Dick Rutan and Dave Melton planned to
launch their balloon, the Global Hilton, from Albuquerque Bal
loon Fiesta Park at 3 a.m. today.
"We don't want to be flippant about this. There will he plen
ty of gremlins along the way," Rutan said. "But we are ready
wherever the wind gods let us go. we will follow."
Uncooperative winds, low fuel and equipment problems
stymied Steve Fossett's fourth solo attempt to pilot a balloon
nonstop around the world. His flight ended in on the edge of the
Black Sea early yesterday.
Fossett left from Buseh Stadium in St. Louis on New Year's
Eve. He landed about 50 miles north of Krasnodar, Russia, ves
terday.
Another balloonist. Kevin Uliassi, also made an attempt last
Wednesday. He took off from Loves Park, 111., but a faulty vent
on his balloon forced him to land about two hours later.
Rutan of Mojave. Calif., was the first to fly a twin-engine air
plane around the world 11 years ago without landing or refuel
ing. And Melton of Espanola. N.M.. has made two previous
attempts in a balloon for Barron Hilton, chairman of Hilton
Hotels Corp.
"If you believe in the luck of threes, this one should be our
ticket." Melton said Monday during final preparations. "We real
ly don't want to let Mr. Hilton down this time."
But a weather forecaster's prescription for a doomed liftoff
and the lack of permission to fly over Russia and China make this
aviation first a daunting task.
Forecasters for the (ilobal Hilton team predicted clear skies
for today's launch But national forecasters predict possible snow
and strong winds up to 10 knots, about 11.5 rnph Winds under ?
knots are preferred.
"Meteorologically speaking, they are treading on thin ice it

s they go through with their launch." National Weather serviee
v spokesman I'd Polasko said yesterday in Albuquerque,
i The (ilobal Hilton balloon is made by the same manufacturer
as llliassi's — Cameron Balloons hut the company has
) assured the team there are no design problems in the (ilobal
Hilton. Melton said.
"We will look at the envelope of the balloon and make a few
minor adjustments, but this balloon is a safe balloon.'' Melton
said. "It is designed well."
