NEW YORK (AP) â€” Interest rates on the
30-year Freasury bond fell to an all-time lovv
yesterday, and that could give millions of
Americans a strong incentive to buy a home
or refinance their mortgages and save some
money.
The yield on the 30-vear bond, the bench
mark used to set the interest rate on many
home mortgages, sank to 5.73 percent from
5.52 percent Friday.
It's the lowest rate since the 30-vear Trea
sury bond began selling in l l )77.
I lie latest drop could show up in borrowing
rates by the end of the week.
"You could gamble and hope rates go even
lower and wait, but if you're wrong you have
missed an opportunity." said David Lereah.
chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers
Association. "You get these rates once a gen
eration. I wouldn't take a chance."
Signs of a moderating economv and lons
inflation combined with the financial crisis in
Asia have driven down the bond's yield near
ly a full percentage point over the past four
months. Rates also fell after Federal Reserve
C hairman Alan (ireenspan suggested over the
weekend that the Fed miuht need to lovvei

interest rates to fight deflation, or falling
prices.
Mortgage rates already have sunk to entic
ingly low levels that have generated a flurry of
activity in the real estate market.
In addition to making a home more afford
able. lower rates give homeowners an oppor
tunity to refinance and thereby cut their
monthly pay ments or pay off their loans faster.
According to the most recent figures from
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.. 30-
year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.03 per
cent last week, up from 6.W percent the previ
ous week.
As recently as last April. 30-y ear mortgage
rates were as high as X. IS percent. At the time.
30-year Treasury bonds were yielding more
than 7 percent.
Many people have already been taking
advantage of the falling rates. Sales of existing
homes appear to have finished IW7 at a
record pace, and economists are kx>king for
this year to be nearly as good.
