Return to moon delayed
C APE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
NASA's return to the mi>on after being
away 25 years will have to wait at least
another day.
An unmanned Athena rocket was sup
posed to blast oft with the Lunar Prospector
spacecraft by the light of a first rnixw last
night. But last-minute trouble with the Air
Force radar needed to track the rocket
forced NASA to delay the launch until
tonight.
II NASA dt>es not launch Prospector
today. the space agency will have to wait
until early February to take advantage of
the most fuel-efficient route to the moon.
Among the highlights of the $b3 million
mission searching for frozen water at the
shadowy lunar poles.
"We wanted to show that for the cost of
a typical Hollywixxl movie, you can explore
interplanetary space." said mission manag
er Scott Hubbard
Besides seeking evidence of water ice â€”
which would be a boon for human settlers
the 4-foot. b.SO-pound Prospector will
look for gases and minerals that also could
be used by astronauts living one day on the
moon.
Humans last visited the moon in Decem
ber 1472 and took all their supplies with
them, adding greatly to the cost. Future pi<v
necrs could separate water, if it's there, into
hydrogen and oxygen and thus make their
own rocket luel.
