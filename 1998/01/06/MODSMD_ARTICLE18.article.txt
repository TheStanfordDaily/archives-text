Rushing back to campus to
face long lines, wait lists
and inspected dorm rooms

Housing officials need to
extend the time frame allotted to
undergraduate students for mov
ing in and out of their rooms during each
break of the year. Furthermore, room
inspections done over the break, as well as
inspections or refurbishments performed
during the quarter, should be better publi
cized.
Returning to campus with one day to
regroup, get loan checks, retrieve mail, pay
bills, sign up for classes and get reacquaint
ed with friends is no way to start a new
quarter.
And to top if off, no day of errands is
complete without a note from the facilities
supervisor under the door — halogen
lamps are not allowed and must be purged.
The window of time that is given to stu
dents at the beginning and end of each
quarter should be revamped to allow stu
dents more time to prepare for the new
junctures.
At the start of the new academic year,
normal students have three days to get their
room keys, their items out of storage and
their year in order — and this is the most
generous of the windows provided. At the
end of the term, those with Friday finals,
have less than 24 hours to gather three

weeks worth of belongings before they get
booted.
These same students are the ones who
step off their planes and rush to the Bursar's
Office line to pay their bills. Or the ones
who get in on Sunday and get up at 8 a.m.
the next morning to sign up for golf classes.
There simply needs to be more time to set
tle and prepare for the start of each quarter.
But despite all of this, the worst is yet to
come. The end of spring quarter brings the
most hardship for students that must stow
belongings away for the summer and study
for finals at the same time.
Room inspections are another reality
that students came back to that highlight
an ongoing undergraduate housing prob
lem. Facilities workers, throughout the
year, enter rooms to adjust in-room con
nections, change carpets and perform
inspections. And while contractually this
is beyond reproach, privacy is not being
respected.
Like they do for graduate residents,
facilities workers should provide ample
warning when they need to enter a room,
and they should leave a note after they
have been in a room about what proce
dures were performed.
Leaving chocolates on the pillow isn't
necessary, just a little consideration would
be enough. After all, students have spent
much time making their rooms their
"home." Housing authorities could be
more flexible when entering this home
and in telling students when they have to
leave and when they can return.
