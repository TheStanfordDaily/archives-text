Forty-years ago this week Stanford
began construction on the first $3
million phase of a married student
apartment program. The construction
project, which would ultimately become
Escondido Village, was originally com
prised of 250 units designed by the San
Francisco architectural firm of Wurster,
Bernardi & Emmons. The 175-acre con
struction site, bordered by Stanford Ave.,
Escondido Road and El Camino Real

consisted principally of level, open fields
as well as two houses. Noting that since
its inception. "Stanford has had the goal
of housing as large a proportion of its stu
dent population as possible," University
officials felt the need to accommodate
the large numbers of married students
who had flocked to the campus after
World War 11. According to a survey
taken at the time, one-fifth of the Stan
ford student population was married.
