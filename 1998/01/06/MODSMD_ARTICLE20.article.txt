## Reflections on A 						school named Stanford 
### 
WELL, because
I am a Decem
ber 1997 grad
uate, Stanford is now a
thing of the past. And
although it is a little
strange that 1 have a few
more columns to write
even though I'm gone, it

gives me the chance to reflect on my Stan
ford experience. Here are a few of my
memories from the past four years:
*White Plaza preachers. When certain
individuals attempted to preach "the Word
of God" in White Plaza, I saw ignorance
and hate. When some Stanford people
responded to them, 1 saw ignorance and
more ignorance.
♦Relationships. Over the past four
years. I've learned a great deal about rela
tionships — including my ineptitude in
dealing with aspects of them. Beware of
others with such stupidity (though, facing
it is the only way to become a little less
foolish).
*Forgive and forget. Despite Stanford's
strong tendency to be politically correct,
one (e.g. Garry Grundy) can offend near
ly everyone and still be loved. So much for
those PC ideals.
*The senior thesis. Thesis writing is for
the masochistic soul. Along with the com
mon tortures of this experience, however,
there is the definite possibility of it offer
ing a few blessings as well.
*The party police of the past. During a
freshman year Mardi Gras party, a Stan
ford police officer followed a pick-up
truck filled with beer that was headed to a
dorm. After finding the RA, the officer

simply told him that "if anyone gets out of
hand, stop serving them alcohol." Do you
think the campus is still that relaxed?
*"The Finger Man." For those of you
who never experienced this person's pres
ence, he would simply pick a spot on cam
pus — usually around Tresidder — read
something aloud with an exaggerated
high-pitched voice and erect his middle
finger. His commentary on the world (or
maybe just Stanford) was never really
clear, but nonetheless, he seemed to be
onto something in whatever exact criti
cism he might have had.
*"COMA." Maybe this person hangs
out with the Finger Man.
*Stolen possessions. When an outsider
stole my refrigerator at the end of fresh
man year, I achieved a better understand
ing of not putting too much trust in people
whom 1 don't know. When a Stanford stu
dent stole my bike, I achieved a better
understanding of the fact that Stanford
students can be just as deceitful as anyone.
*The freshman dorm Christmas tree
debates. Sensitivity about cultures is very
important. It's just too bad many of us
completely forgot to be sensitive about
many very significant cultural issues and,
instead, spent endless hours screaming
about the amorphous meaning of a pine
tree.
The jolly Stanford smile. Behind many
big and white smiles at Stanford, lies a
roaming, vicious devil. Or, at other times,
there lies a compassionate, selfless person.
It's funny how both can coexist in the
same individual.
*Evan Chen. During Evan's battle with
leukemia, much of the Stanford communi

ty displayed compassion in helping to find
a hone marrow donor. We should remem
ber this sense of compassion when the
devil inside of us comes roaming around.
The country of California. A freshman
from California once said: "California's so
awesome! It should, like, be its own coun
try!" No comment.
TAs. Teaching assistants ranged from
those who went beyond assisting by really
teaching to those who groveled in bitter
ness while striving to make your life bitter.
The former tended to make Stanlord
more worthwhile than the latter.
*An education. Despite what some
may believe, Stanford does offer the
opportunity for an academic education
beyond that which will get us jobs.
The common undergraduate path. As
freshmen, we tend to be giddy and overly
idealistic. Then, after that freshman year,
we might lose our glittering shine and
become overworked and rankled. And
finally, at the end of our Stanford careers,
we are tempted to "keep it real' by devot
ing ourselves to the Man that we might
have once (in a state of giddiness) hated.
Hut one need not close one's eyes and
jump into the arms of such temptation.
The sting of the shortcut. I entered
Stanford foolishly loving the shortcuts in
life a little too much. At least, life helps us
by smacking us in the face after many
shortcuts.

Jon Servaites has finished his undergradu
ate studies at Stanford but will continue to
write a weekly column through January.
The past four years have smacked him in
the face countless times.
