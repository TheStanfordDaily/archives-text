## California's smoking gun of fascism 
### 
Garry Grundy

I HATE CALIFORNIA. I should have
seen the writing on the wall with Proposi
tions 187 and 209. Hut 1 didn't.
And now, the call to arms has been
sounded — in the courtrooms, casinos and
bars of California: what I'm talking about is
the anti-smoking law passed by the Califor
nia legislature banning smoking in most all
bars and casinos that took effect Jan. 1.
My difficulty with this law is in no way
connected with my like or dislike for
cigarettes. In fact, I, myself, have never
bought a pack of cigarettes. My concern as a
non-smoker with regard to this poorly
designed law is that it forces yet another seg
ment of California's diverse populations to
the margins of society — all for not sharing
the same tastes as you. We should shudder to
think that savagery should reach such a point
that we condemn a person whose crime
amounts to not sharing your tastes.
Perhaps those uncultivated neophytes in
Sacramento have forgotten what is the
essence of a bar or casino, litis law seems to
ignore the fact that bars and casinos are

places where people indulge in activities that
are not always in the person's best interest.
Gambling, drinking, smoking — three vices
that appear to have drawn the fire of Heaven
and Hell alike.
However, I shall draw most of our atten
tion to the latter two vices: smoking and
drinking are like pork rinds and Tabasco,
peanut butter and jelly, juice clubs and
anorexia; each of them are pretty damn
intense in their own right; the two together
are inseparable. Quite simply, people go to
bars to drink and smoke; bars are places
where consenting adults can "legally" ingest
poisons into their system — all by choice. It's
a free country!
Or is it?
Led by the savage enlightenment of
Sacramento lawgivers, those of us that fre
quent bars and smoke will be forced to light
up elsewhere, such that our bartenders (who
provide a poison that scarcely a century ago
was illegal) won't have to "go home smelling
like smoke."
Why then, mav I ask, did one become a

bartender if they were dissatisfied with the
very real risks that surround dealing with poi
sons like aleohol and cigarette smoke? Mow
ean we absolve the poisoner of the poison?
What right has the scorpion to complain of
the snakes venom? None. If you can't take
the smoke, get out of the bar!
My father does manual labor in the swel
tering Arizona heat, placing him at risk for
skin cancer and heat stroke, yet he and his
cohorts have not demanded the state legisla
ture to draft a bill stopping the sun from shin
ing. They are quite aware of the risks (hat
surround their job.
While a nurse, my grandmother ran the
risks of contracting whatever unseemly ill
ness floated through the doors of the hospital
she worked. Yet. again, she did not protest to
the state legislature all of those nights she
went home smelling like urine or feces. She
had a job to do — a service to render.
Bartenders are no different. They are
unsung heroes, weaving one of the strongest
strands in the fabric of American culture;
they are our counselors, our friends and our

family. My bartenders don't mind smokers:
their bar is everyone's home, the last refuge
of California's smoking population.
The fact that smokers have been booted
out of California bars is indicative of a prob
lem much more telling than cancer or
smelling like smoke: this law is paving the
highway to fascism 111 ( alifornia. and the bars
are the smoking gun!
Consider the life of a Stanford student
who smokes: he is not permitted to smoke in
his own residence or within 50 feet ol a resi
dence: he cannot smoke at bars oi restau
rants in Palo Alto. Mis last refuge is outside,
behind the dumpsters or on the streets. He
has been evicted from his home, and
replaced with newer, more desirable tenants.
Does any of this sound familiar vet?
It appears to me as if the folks in Sacra
mento are making another historical run ai
homogenizing an intrinsically diverse estab
lishment. Whatever happened to that unusu
al word callled tolerance?
Unfortunately, this word has no teeth in
the former Republic of California: "Let's get

the Mexicans out of our schools and hospi
tals. the niggers out of our high caliber jol>
and universities, and that poor white trash
out of our sights: no more smoking in bars."
A most loathsome reality, this pushing t<
the edge of those marginal members of soci
elv all lor not sharing your inclinatior
toward juice clubs, stair masters, organic frui
and bulimia. Nevertheless. I have found ;
way to siphon away the stiny of this fascisn
inhred into this most un-American law. ( iti
/ens. light up for freedom. We hope thai
local police are more concerned with urban
violence than the smoking at El I onto. Such
weighty disobedience and insurrection will
send lawmakers a message: where there's
smoke, there's lire. So stand clear!
Such a display can have only one of two
effects: it could either subvert the smoking
han or lead to the incarceration of smokers.
But the latter isn't so had at least in
prison they still permit vou to light up.
