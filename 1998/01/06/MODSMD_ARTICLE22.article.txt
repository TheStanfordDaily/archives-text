## Seniors Lambert, McNamee, Folkl, Sharpley and Ifejika leave behind a record-setting championship legacy 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Every now and then a coach is
blessed with a special group of ath
letes — a team that comes together
with all the talent and chemistry and
accomplishes remarkable feats.
At Stanford the national titles
seem to occur more frequently than
not. but they're still something extra
ordinary — something to take notice
of and marvel at. Most players (and
fans) only dream of being a part of
something that special. Those who
achieve it just once are lucky.
Maybe that's what makes the se
nior class of the 1997 national cham
pion Stanford women's volleyball
team so incredible. They didn't win
just one national title: they didn't
even win two. Kristin Folkl, Lisa
Sharpley. Barbara Ifejika, Paula Me-
Namee and Debbie Lambert won
three, etching themselves into

NCAA history and becoming one of
if not the most spectacular class any
sport has ever seen.
Sure, other sports and other
schools have had their share of great
teams, hut how often has one class
been so incredible for its entire four
years? When the seniors stepped
onto the court as freshmen baek in
1994. they were declared one of the
best recruiting classes any school had
ever gotten.
In four years, they more than
proved that statement to be true. For
their careers, the seniors were an in
credible 125-8 overall, while going
an unthinkable 70-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference and 64-1 at Maples
Pavilion.
But the mark of any great class is
the championships it wins, and this
year the seniors made history by be
coming the first elass in NCAA vol
leyball history to win three national
titles.

"I think we definitely left our
mark." Folkl said. "The obvious fun
of it is all the winning, but what
makes our class special is we're very
well-rounded. We focus on acade
mics; we had a good work ethic in
practice. It's just good all the way
around to win with people you care
about."
And the wins started rolling in
right from the start. As freshmen, the
Cardinal was a favorite to win the na
tional title so the pressure of expec
tation was present from day one.
Stanford went 32-1 that season en
route to its second national champi
onship.
Hut maybe you're wondering
what kind of impact a freshman
could have in a program as dominant
as Stanford women's volleyball.
Head coach Don Shaw would prob
ably be the first to tell you that four
year starters aren't that common,
but Sharpley. Folkl and Ifejika all

were.
"I'm so lucky to have gotten to
play with this class." Sharpley said.
"Coming in with this recruiting class,
there was no way we were ever going
to have an off year; we were going to
be competitive no matter what. And
just being surrounded by so many
great athletes in my class — I feel re
ally lucky, and it's been really fun."
The only postseason blemish for
the seniors came their sophomore
season. Lambert tore her ACL prior
to the semifinal match, and Stanford
fell to Texas in five games. A win that
season would have given then-se
niors Cary Wendell. Wendy Hro
madka, Mamie Triefenbach and
Maureen McLaren three national ti
tles in their careers, but it wasn't
meant to be.
The loss intensified the group's
desire for another championship.


Kwesi Leggett — Daily
and Stanford came back with a
vengeance in 19%, winning the na
tional title in the most lopsided
championship match ever.
Finally as seniors, they got their
shot at history. This time the Cardi
nal was the underdog, hut it pulled
out the win in one of the most excit
ing matches of the senior's storied
career. It was Stanford's only five
game match of the • .uson, and the
win will no doubt go down as the
biggest of their careers.
"It feels so rewarding to have won
such a battle," Sharpley said after the
match. "Looking back, as much as
we wanted to win in three, to have
won such a great match just feels all
the better. To know that both teams
were at their best and to still come
out on top is a great, great feeling."
Not only have the seniors won to
gether, but they've attained numer
ous individual awards as well. All
told the group earned seven Ail-
American awards, eight all-confer
ence honors, two selections to the
1994 Pac-10 All-Freshman team, the
National and Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year in '94. and this year's Pac-10
Player of the Year.
The Stanford record books are
filled with their accomplishments
too. Folkl is second in career kills
and this year set the record for kills
in a single season. Sharpley is one of
just three Cardinal players to record

more than 4.(XH) assists in her career,
and Ifejika finished fourth in total
blocks for her career, eclipsing the
100-block mark three straight sea
sons.
"We're losing an incredible group
of players, talent, leadership and
heart." said defensive specialist
Sarah Neal, the team's lone junior.
"Not only are they incredible play
ers, but a lot of them are really good
friends. It's going to be hard not hav
ing them around because they set
such an example on the court and
they have such a range of personali
ties off the court."
Spend just five minutes around
the team, and those personalities
can't help hut shine through. They
laugh and joke with one another like
old friends, and it's easy to see why
they've been so successful together.
Ask one of them about the others,
and their words reveal the respect
and admiration they have for each
other. The way Lambert worked to
recover from knee surgery was in
spiring: McNamee finally getting her
shot as a fifth-year was storybook.
Folkl's athletic ability phenomenal,
Ifejika's poise and consistency un
paralleled. Sharpley's leadership
and intensity unmatched.
"I came in with four other incred
ible people," Ifejika said. "Players at
other schools don't have the luxury
of saying that. I 've come to appreci
ate how fortunate I am to [have
played J with these guys. They are all
amazing, every single one of them.
That just doesn't happen. It's rare, so
I'm just glad to have been a part of it.
