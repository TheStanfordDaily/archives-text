shutout losses in the 150 and 158-
pound divisions. 4-0 and 5-0. respec

7-2 victory over Cardinal co-captain

good with an impressive power
move takedown in the first period.
The much-anticipated 177-

Scott Chapman returning to the mat

Doren, who finished third in the na
tion last year and entered the meet
with an 11-1 record. The two wres
tled even for two brutal periods, nei
ther able to manage a point. Late in
the second. Chapman nearly burst
free for a one-point escape, but Van
Doren was just as quick, regaining
control and grinding out the stale
mate.
In the third, however. Chap
man's long injury-forced absence
caught up with him. as Van Doren
managed two takedowns en route to
a 5-1 win.
"Scott is mentally ready, but is
physically maybe only SO or 85 per
cent." Horpel said.
In the 190-pound division, Tim
Kendall spotted fellow sophomore

Erik Drange a 5-2 lead before
mounting a strong comeback. With
an escape and a takedown at the

"It's nice to know that when you
wrestle a top-10 team, you can make
a match of it." Horpel said. "Penn
will be a great dual meet."
