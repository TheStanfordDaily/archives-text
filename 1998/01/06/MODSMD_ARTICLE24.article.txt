### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
It may be the enormous front
line that thrust the men's basket
ball team into the national spot
light this year, but junior guard
Kris Weems is making sure oppo
nents don't ignore the backcourt.

MEW'S BASKETBALL
■ LAST NIGHT'S RESULT:
Stanford 89, Oregon 67
Weems scored a career-high 34
points on 13-of-18 shooting and
pulled down six rebounds in Stan
ford's 89-67 victory over Oregon
last night in Eugene, Ore. He also
hit four out of six three pointers.
Weems' scoring output is the
most by a Cardinal player since
Adam Keefe scored 36 against
Washington in the 1991-92 sea
son.
"Everything I've been working
on the last year and a half came to
gether tonight." Weems said.
"After I hit the first couple, the
guys kept looking for me. Good
teams find the hot guy."
Weems upped his team-lead
ing scoring average to 13.8, bounc
ing back from a 2-for-7. 4-point
showing against Oregon State. He
has benefited greatly from oppo
nent's preoccupation with the
Cardinal's deep front line, also
bringing home MVP honors at
last week's Cable Car Classic He
totaled 33 points over the two-day
tournament.
"We had a huge offensive night
from Kris Weems tonight," said
Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "He seemed like the guy
to get the ball to, and he seemed to
get all the open shots.
"1 don't think he's a 34 a night
guy, but this is certainly something
he's capable of. I think this is defi
nitely more typical of the Kris
Weems we're used to seeing."
The win is Stanford's biggest at
Oregon's McArthur Court since a

78-57 victory in the 1991-92 sea
son. It also gives the No. 7 Cardi
nal (13-0, 2-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) a chance to tie its best start
in history this Saturday when they
host cross-bay rival California.
After a game against Oregon
State in which the Cardinal de
fense shined. the Cardinal shot 55
percent from the floor and hit a re
markable 10-of-14 (71 percent)
from three-point territory to com
plete the decisive sweep of its trip
through the state, winning the two
games by a combined 42 points.
Sophomore guard David
Moseley came off the bench to
shoot a perfect 3-for-3 from down
town, adding 13 points.
"I feed off of [Weems]," Mose
ley said. "I try to outdo him, which
isn't easy when he scores 34 in one
night. The big guys are setting
beautiful picks. They're doing a
good job of getting us open shots."
Junior forward Pete Sauer also
added 13 points, the bulk of which
came from his flawless 8-for-8 per
formance at the free throw line,
and a team-high seven rebounds.
"They just put on an awesome
display," said Oregon's first-year
head coach Ernie Kent. "There's
a reason they're undefeated and
ranked seventh in the country,
and they may go higher. For us as
a program, they're where we want
to go."
The Ducks (6-5. 1-1) jumped
out to a quick 6-4 lead two min
utes into the game, but Stanford
answered back with a 16-4 run and
never trailed again, dominating
the Ducks in every way.
After Oregon ran off seven
unanswered points, the Cardinal
pulled away for a 16-point half
time lead. The Cardinal shot 56
percent in the first half compared
to the Ducks 36 percent, and they
completely dominated the boards,
outrebounding Oregon 20-9.
The second half was more
even-handed, but the Ducks could
get no closer than 13 points at 55-
42.
Duck guard Henry Madden
led his team with 19 points on 8-
of-12 shooting, including a 3-for-4
performance on three-pointers.
However, he cooled down quickly
and failed to score at all in the final
15 minutes of the game.
Oregon also got 10 points a
piece from forward Jonathan Nel
son and guard Jamar Curry. Nel
son also pulled down a team-high
5 rebounds.
Junior Tim Young, the starting
center for the Cardinal, was limit
ed with 11 points and 4 rebounds,
due mainly to his playing only 19
minutes because of foul trouble in
the first half.
Young also played a minimal
role in the second half after being
pulled from the game when he cut
his jaw after colliding with Duck
forward A. D. Smith.
It may be the enormous front
line that thrust the men's basket
ball team into the national spot
