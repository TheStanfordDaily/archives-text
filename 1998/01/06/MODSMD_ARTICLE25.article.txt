Perhaps the naysayers predicting mediocrity after an 0-2 start
spoke too soon. This past week, senior center ()lympia Scott av
eraged 25 points in three games, including a career-high 33
points Dec. 2K against Colorado ;is Stanford surged to three
straight wins to improve to 5-4. Scott also grabbed 16 rebounds
in a 97-72 victory over Oregon Sunday to help I5th-ranked
Stanford win their 47th straight Pacific 10Conference game.

It's hard being an undefeated, top-10 team, but with Kris Weems
producing in the clutch, it became substantially easier. The ju
nior guard followed up his MVP performance in last week s
Cable Car Classic with a career-high M points in last nights 89-
67 victory over Oregon. Weems was a sizzling 13-of-1H from the
lield. including 4-of-6 from three-point land. The win improved
the No. 7 Card to 13-0, one short of the schml record.
