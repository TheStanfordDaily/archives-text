### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
While 410 high school students
received the thick packages that
signal acceptance from Stanford in
their mailboxes this December, a
record 1,170 received the thin let
ters that mean either rejection or
deferral.
These letters, sent out Dec. 12,
contained the results of Early Deci
sion I.the first of two early decision
rounds. Responses to the second
round of students, the 1.6(H) who
applied under Early Decision 11,
will be sent out in early February.

Although Stanford received
about 25 percent more early appli
cations this year than last, the Uni
versity still plans to accept roughly
the same number of students under
the early decision system, accord
ing to Bob Kinnally. dean of admis
sions and financial aid.
"Our early decision acceptance
rates may be slightly higher this
year," said Kinnally, "but we're try
ing to keep them at around the
same number."
Early decision application rates
have been increasing around the
country, and, at many colleges,
early decision acceptance rates

have been climbing as well. For ex
ample. Harvard. Columbia. Dart
mouth and Yale all accepted at
least 35 percent of their next enter
ing class under some kind of early
selection program.
Under kinnally's projections.
Stanford would accept about 35
percent of the Class of 2(M)2 under
early decision, the same percentage
as last year.
These numbers worry Kinnally,
who dislikes the growing populari
ty of early decision. Many of his
concerns relate to the fact that the
majority of early decision appli
cants are white and solidly middle
class.
"There is very, very little racial
diversity in most early decision ap
plicant pools," said kinnally. "If
we put everyone in early, we would
have an incredibly un-diverse, nar
row population."
The students accepted under
the first round of Early Decision
had higher SA T scores than any
previous early decision group in
Stanford history, and over half of
them got all As in high school.
There are students from 41 differ
ent states, with 40 percent coming
from California.
