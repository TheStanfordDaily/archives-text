# Stafford loans now appear on University bills
## 
### Bill Bowen 
The long hours Stanford stu
dents wait in loan lines recently got
a bit shorter. The Financial Aids
Office replaced winter quarter
Stafford Loan checks with automat
ic credits to student accounts as part
of an effort to eliminate lines and
streamline financial aid procedures.
The Financial Aids Office insti
tuted electronic fund transfer of
Stafford Loans both to save stu
dents time and to reduce hassle
within the Financial Aids Office.

Cynthia Rife, director of stu
dent awards explained that "with
out electronic funds, students have
to stand in line both to pick up
checks and to pay their bill. This
switch will provide better service
to students so they don't have to
stand in line. Tracking paper
checks is a very intensive project
for the Financial Aids Office as
well, so electronic fund transfer
streamlines work within the Finan
cial Aids Office."
The Financial Aids Office chose
to change Stafford Loan disburse

ment to electronic fund transfer
rather than other loans because,
"Those were the kinds of loans we
had the most control over. It was
easier for the Bursar's Office to
change those than the others." ex
plained Rife.
Because almost all Stanford stu
dents on financial aid receive
Stafford loans, switching to elec
tronic fund transfer was a large task
for the Financial Aids Office.
The Financial Aids Office began
the switch to electronic fund trans
fer winter quarter because they

"didn't want to start during the
chaotic autumn registration period,
and didn't want to wait until
spring," said Rife. To avoid confu
sion. the Financial Aids Office sent
out postcards over the winter break
so students would be aware of the
change.
While the loan process is signifi
cantly different for students with
Stafford loans only, little has
changed for those with other loans,
such as University and federal
Perkins loans, who still have to pick
up paper checks and deposit them.

Freshman Ben Mowery comment
ed, "I had to wait in line for my
loans over half an hour. The lines
were so long that 1 went to get
homework to study during the
wait."
Though loan disbursement is still
a hassle for many students on finan
cial aid. the Financial Aids Office
sees recent changes as a step in the
right direction. "Ideally, our aim
would he to use this change as a
model to apply the other loans di
rectly to the University hill," said
