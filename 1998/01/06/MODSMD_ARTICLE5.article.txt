### Kelly Young Staff writer 
Sororities arc one step closer to
receiving housing on campus. On
Dec. 5. housing applications were
made available to unhoused Greek
organizations.
The release comes as no surprise
to the Greek community.
"Because this has been an issue
in the past, most of the sororities
have been preparing as we've been
going along," said senior Amie
Rooney. who served on the com
mittee that drafted the selection cri
teria that applicants must meet.
Fraternity and sorority presi
dents were allowed to read drafts ol
the application and criteria at the
Greek Leadership Retreat in Octo
ber and at the Greek Leadership
Circle in November.
Despite the advance notice
some Greek organizations, such a;
Sigma Phi Epsilon and Delu
Gamma, have yet to decide whethei
or not to submit an application.
"We haven't had our first meet
ing yet. so we haven't discussed it."

Robin Tenold refrained from com

meriting on whether her organiza
tion intends to apply until the appli
cation process is over.
After the Jan. 30 deadline, the
applications will he reviewed by the
Greek Housing Review Board,
which will forward its recommenda
tions to Jane C'amarillo. director of
Residential Education. C'amarillo,
in consultation with Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais. is scheduled to
make her final decisions by March 1.
Competition lor housing is ex
pected to be stiff.
"We expect a large number of
chapters to apply for housing." said
senior Brad Rodrigues. Interfrater
nitv Council president. "We are not
yet sure exactly which houses will
be available, though only Row
houses, including Cowell Cluster
are being considered."
The report recommended ex
panding the housed Greek commu
nity to 10 to 12 Greek organizations.
With six fraternities currently
housed, only four to six spaces re
main. and even those ma\ not be
filled immediately.
"The document clearh indicates
the I Jniversity may provide housing
for up to 10 to 12 Greek organiza
tions over time based upon the
availability of housing and the
strength of the Greek oraaniza-
tions," Wais said.
Two unhoused fraternities do
not have to go through the same ap
plication process as other Greek or
ganizations. Kappa Alpha and
Delta Kappa Epsilon, who were re
moved from their houses in 1995
and 1997 respectively, may see a
comeback next fall.
Both fraternities originally
drafted letters to the Dean of Stu
dents' Office stating conditions
they would have to meet in order to
be eligible for housing again.
"We are hopeful that both fra
ternities will meet the conditions
contained in these agreement let
ters," Wais said. "We look forward
to housing both the fraternities in
their former houses as early as Sep
tember 1998."
Should both fraternities meet
the criteria and be rehoused, this
would leave only two to four spaces
available for the 19 unhoused fra
ternities and sororities.
"Sororities obviously will be
given priority" over unhoused fra
ternities, said Rodrigues.
Heather Dunn, a Greek com
munity liaison in the Office of Stu
dent Activities, emphasized that
this fact did not exclude unhoused
fraternities from applying.
