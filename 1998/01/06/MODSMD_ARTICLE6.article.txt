# Bob residents hit by break-in
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Editorial staff 
Students returning to their
rooms in Hub have an unpleasant
task to add to the usual beginning of
the quarter errands â€” doing inven
tories of their belongings and filing
police reports on items that are now
missing.
Over the break, intruders broke

in to the house, kicked in the doors
of 15 rooms and looted them. Resi
dents are still unsure of how much
was taken by the thieves, who most
ly passed over large possessions in
favor of small, expensive electronic
items.
According to a letter from Facil
ities Supervisor Sharon Bruce, the
crime was discovered shortl\ after
midnight on Dec. 24. after which po

lice and housing staff inspected the
house and filed a report. Rixim
doors were replaced before stu
dents returned to school.
Hiree laptop computers, a com
puter scanner, calculators, cameras
and a \iolin were among the stolen
items. Hob residents estimated that
lb to 20 students, most ot whom
lived on the third floor, had belong
ings taken.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said a lock on one of the
outer doors had been dismantled in
a way that would have required spe
cial tools and that "we are possibly
talking about someone who has
some locksmith knowledge."
He also noted that the building
was in use by San Mateo Security
Services, a firm that was responsible
for security over the vacation at sev
eral neighboring houses, and that

employees of that firm had keys that
would have allowed them to open
Bob's outer doors without disman
tling locks.
Andy Taylor, a sophomore, esti
mated the value of his stolen prop
erty at $2,()(M). More than 50 of his
checks were stolen, and two have
already been cashed by the thieves
for $500.
The thieves, however, are not
lacking in a sort of humor. Senior
Brad Rodrigues, who did not have
any checks stolen, did find a happy
face drawn on his checkbook. On
the white board on the second floor
of the house, the intruders scrawled

"for all u hoes call [a telephone
number] ask for KD" and"for all
you other hoes [a pager number] ask
for Dojia."
In her letter. Bruce encouraged
students missing belongings to file
police reports, noting that this is
necessary for filing an insurance
claim. According to Diana Con
klin, manager of undergraduate
residence facilities, Stanford
claims no insurance responsibility
for thefts of students' personal
property, and students must be re
imbursed through their own or
their parent's homeowner insur
ance.
