Food Research Prof. Walter Fal
con. director of the Institute for In
ternational Studies, will step clown
from his directorship on Aug. 31,
Provost Condoleezza Rice an
nounced last month.
Falcon "has played a crucial role
in the establishment of the Global
Environmental Forum at lIS. the
Asia / Pacific Scholars program and,
most recently, the Beehtel Initiative
on Global Growth and Change,"
Rice said. "He has also helped to
forge important new links between
lIS and the Schools of Medicine,
Earth Sciences and Engineering."
Falcon, who specializes in in
ternational agricultural policy, said
he is pleased with the growth of the
institute arid is looking forward to
focusing on research again.
"This has been a terrific job and
I've been on it for seven years." Fal
con said, adding that during his
tenure as director the institute has
grown from a "good experiment
into a fairly mature institution."
One of Falcon's key responsibili
ties as director has been fund-rais
ing. because the institute raises
about two-thirds of its $13-million
annual budget independently.

During Falcon's tenure, the insti
tute has focused on a few key areas
such as the Asia / Pacific region and
arms control. At the same time the
institute has launched some new ini
tiatives such as an environmental
program.
Overall lIS has roughly doubled
in size under difficult funding condi
tions for such centers, he said. Fal
con credited the institute's entire
faculty and staff with these accom
plishments.
Rice and Dean of Research and
Graduate Policy Charles Kruger
have selected a search committee to
develop a short list of candidates to
fill the position once Falcon leaves.
The committee will also assess affil
iations between the institute and
other Stanford programs and de
partments.
Kruger and Engineering-Eco
nomic Systems and Operations Re
search Prof. William Perry, a former
I J.S. Secretary of Defense, will serve
as co-chairs of the committee.
Other committee members in
clude faculty and staff from various
programs and departments, includ
ing German Studies. Medicine. Po
litical Science, History. Civil and
Environmental Engineering and
Economics as well as the School of
Earth Sciences and the Graduate
School of Business.
The institute is now in the
process of consolidating its many
centers into one physical location in
Encina Hall. The new location will
bring together the Asia / Pacific Re
search Center, the Center for In
ternational Security and Arms Con
trol, the Environmental Policy
Forum and the Interschool Honors
Program in Environmental Science,
among other programs.
Falcon says most of the money
required for the Encina renovations
has been raised and the project
should be finished in the near fu
ture.
