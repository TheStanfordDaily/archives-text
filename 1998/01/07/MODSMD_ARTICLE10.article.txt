## Clinton unveils Medicare plan 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) In a new hid to expand
health insurance. President Clinton unveiled a proposal
yesterday offering Medicare coverage to "some of our
most vulnerable older Americans" an estimated
300,000 early retirees and displaced workers.
Republicans were skeptical but conceded the election
year plan would be popular.
The administration said the plan would not solve the
nation's health problems but could help a modest num
ber of aging Americans who are more likely to have seri
ous health needs, be denied coverage or face exorbitant
insurance prices.
"It is the right thing to do." ( linton declared.
The targeted proposal would help about 300.000 of
the 3 million uninsured Americans between the ages of
55 to 64. the administration estimated. Hefty premiums
of up to $400 a month would price it out of the range of
many possible recipients, officials acknowledged.
"This is not a panacea in terms of being able to cover
all workers." I abor Secretary Alexis Herman said. "It
won't be everyone because of the cost." said I leallh and
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala.
Republicans expressed doubts about putting new
demands on a financially troubled system.
"II your mother is on the I itanic and the I itanic is
sinking, the last thing on Earth you want to be preoccu
pied with is getting more passengers on the Titanic," said
Sen. Phil (iramm. R I'exas.
Ihe plan another ingredient in Clinton's step-by
step approach to expanding health care after Congress'
rejection of universal coverage would open Medicare
coverage to Americans at age 62, instead of 65. They
could buy into the program by paying premiums of about
$300 a month, lurther. once they became fully eligible
for Medicare, they would have to pay slightly higher out
of-pocket fees than those who didn't.
I he Medicare option could particularly help women
especially those with pre existing medical problems
who were covered by their husbands' policies at work but
were then left without insurance when their spouses
retired and joined Medicare. Shalala said.
Clinton's proposal also would offer Medicare cover
age to Americans as young as 55 who lost their jobs, such
as through layoffs. They could buy insurance for about
$400 a month. Clinton said that his proposal was fiscally
responsible.
Additionally, the proposal would offer insurance to
retirees whose employers luui proiuu*ui Uciiltk-beixcliLv.
but then reneged. In that case, retirees would be offered
the right to buy into their former employers' health plans
until age 65 under so-called Cobra coverage.
