I le played the fool as part of Sonny &
Cher during the 1960s and '70s, and his
very name became something of a punch
line when he was first elected to
( ongress.
But Sonny Bono had gone a long way
toward shedding his image as a bell-bot
tomed buffoon when he died in a skiing
accident Monday. I le was 62.
"Sonny was becoming a much more
important leader than people realize,"
I louse Speaker Newt (iingrich said.
Bono, an avid skier, slammed into a
tree while on the slopes at the Heavenly
Valley Ski Resort on the Nevada-Califor
nia state line, 55 miles south of Reno.
Bono was skiing with his family when
his daughter fell and his wife and son
stopped to help her. officials said. Bono
skied on ahead into the woods off the
main trail to try out the fresh powder in an
area that is not officially out of bounds but
is more hazardous. He struck a tree
squarely, ripping off the bark.
I le died on impact of serious head and
neck injuries, officials said.
I naware he had not made it down the
hill, his wife. Mary Whitaker. 6-year-old
daughter Chianna and 9-year-old son
( hesare, waited for him at the bottom.
His wife reported him missing when the
resort closed about 4:30 p.m. His body

was found about two hours after that, but
his death was not made public until after
midnight.
Investigators said there was no imme
diate evidence that drugs or alcohol were
involved.
His death came less than a week after
Michael Kennedy, 39-year-old son of the
late Robert F. Kennedy, slammed into a
tree and died while playing football on
skis in Aspen. Colo.
Bono evolved from playing the fall guy
to his sharp-tongued wife on "The Sonny
and Cher Comedy Hour," to a politician
in demand for his GOP fund-raising
speeches peppered with Hollywood anec
dotes.
He was elected to Congress as a
Republican representing the Palm
Springs area in 1994.
"He earned respect by being a witty
and wise participant in policymaking pro
cesses that often seem ponderous to the
American people," President Clinton
said. "He made us laugh even as he
brought his own astute perspective to the
work of Congress."
After his marriage to Cher, Bono was
married to Susie Coehlo. They divorced
in 19K4. He married his fourth wife, Ms.
Whitaker, in 1986. Bono had one daugh
ter. Christy, with his first wife, Donna
Rankin.
