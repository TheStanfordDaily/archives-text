Jurors still deciding
DENVER (AP) â€” The jury deciding
Terry Nichols' fate ended a second day of
deliberations yesterday with two jurors
wiping away tears as the judge told them
to return the next day to try again.
After deliberating more than 13 hours
over two days, jurors filed back into the
courtroom without a decision on
whether Nichols should join I imothv
McVeigh on death row for the Okla
homa City bombing.
"I know it has been a long day and you
worked hard on the case today," U.S. Dis
trict Judge Richard Matsch told the seven
women and five men before he sent them
home for the night.
"Everybody who has worked on this
case knows the stress and strains that are
with you." he said. "We understand the
difficult task that has been given you. and
it is not expected there be some kind of
quick response."
Earlier, victims and relatives waited
for word from the courthouse, with some

wondering what was taking so long
longer than it took a different |urv to
return a death sentence for McVeigh.
Jurors must decide it Nichols should
receive a death sentence, life in prison or
a lesser term to be determined h\ Matsch.
The judge will sentence him on the invol
untary manslaughter convictions later

than miles from St I ouis before
equipment failures forced him to land.

Fossett said he hadn't yet decided
whether to try again.
"I want to see how the other teams
have done and see if I can learn some
thing about their equipment, and then
decide whether I want to prepare for next
year." he said.
"I'm not too disappointed because it
was still a good flight." Fossett said.
"\S henever you make it across the
Atlantic in a balloon. I think it's a good
