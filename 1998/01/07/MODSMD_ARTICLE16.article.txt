## Editorial A 						step in the right direction LGBCC director to be hired 
### 
Anti-gav hate crimes
emphasize the need for
professional guidance

AFI ER A DECADE of petitions
and proposals, the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center
has finally been granted a permanent half
time director.
Although the appointment of half-time
director fell short of the center's repeated
requests for a full-time director, the deci
sion to hire a part-time director marks a
positive step toward improving the center's
ability to address the needs of the LGB
community and to reach out to the campus
community.
Recent events, such as the rise in hate
crimes geared at homosexuals, have
demonstrated the importance of more ade
quately meeting the needs of the LGB com
munity.
While we recognize that decisions
regarding the allocation of funds are tough
to make, we believe that this is a sound
investment in light of the community's size
and the series of hate crimes committed
during the past two years.
Fhe newly allocated funding for a direc

tor will professionalize and enhance the
operation of the center, as well as enable it
to be proactive in responding to issues faced
by the community.
With the appointment of a part-time
director for the LGBCC. all such student
organizations now have at least a part-time
director. Although a full-time director is
able to provide more guidance, given the
I Jniversity's financial constraints we believe
that a half-time director should be able to
adequately address the needs of the
LGBCC community.
I he decision reflects a commitment to
addressing the concerns expressed by com
munity centers. We commend administra
tors for working closely with undergraduate
and graduate students, alumni, faculty and
stall over the past few months to evaluate
the needs at the center and propose plans
for improvement.
Each of the community centers an
important role in meeting the needs of
Stanford students and providing support.
I he search this quarter for a director to fill
the newlv created position will be a tremen
dous task for the University and the
LGBCC community. We encourage admin
istrators and students to work together to
lind a director who will maximize the
resources at the center so as to benefit the
entire Stanford community.
