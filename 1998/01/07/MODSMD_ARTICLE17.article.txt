Grundy's view is
inconsistent
As a lifelong Californian who supported
both Prop. 187 and Prop. 209. I vehemently
object to Garry Grundy's attempt to put the
word "nigger" in my mouth. Like most Cali
fornians, I voted for these important mea
sures because I believe unequivocally in the
integrity of America's borders and the sanc
tity of our Constitutional rights.
Notwithstanding (irundy's incendiary
and ill-founded allegations to the contrary, I
was never trying to "get the Mexicans out of
our schools" anymore than I was attempting
to drive "niggers out of our high caliber jobs
and universities."
Of course, Grundy's destructive vitriol
has always been a favorite weapon of the far
Left, and as former member of Gov. Wil
son's oft-maligned administration. I long ago
became inured to sweeping attacks such as
these.
It is ironic, however, that Grundy would
make these hateful accusations in the context
of an article in which he plainly states: "We
should shudder to think that savagery should
reach such a point that we condemn a person
whose crime amounts to not sharing your
tastes."
If recklessly charging your fellow citizens
with racism does not constitute condemna

tion. I'm not sure what does.
(irundy is right in one respect. The state
law prohibiting smoking in bars is an absurd
misuse of government power. Despite his
hysteria, however, this law is not "paving the
highway to fascism in California."
(irundy and others who use name-calling
and intimidation to suppress independent
thought are doing that all by themselves.
I oward the end of his article, (irundy asks a
gtKxl question: "Whatever happened to that
unusual word called tolerance?"

It is troubling to read Kerry Rodgers' Jan.

vicious convention, namely; volunteerism.
where it is up to the individual to do the right
thing. It is quite logical, however, that the
loudest spokesperson for volunteers is also
the most greedy one — and the more greed,
the more referrals to "freedom" are made.

Whether it is economic freedom ("thou
shall have the right to rip-off other people"),
or civil freedom (thou shall have the right to
protect thyself from the people you have
ripped-off), it is up to volunteers to create
justice, to reduce pollution, to diminish star
vation, etc.
As volunteerism has become a pillow for
the greedy to rest their guilt on, it has done
little for the majority of the people — neither
inside nor outside the United States. One of
the most efficient tools to minister volun
teerism is pretty much what Rodgers has
done; through the mass media. (Of course
almost everything is ministered more conclu
sive through the mass media). Here is also
where the ruh lies — the news media's influ
ence and pivotal power on certain issues,
carefully selected by journalists.
One such issue is volunteerism, on which
thousands of airtime hours and space arc
spent to "interview" so-called celebrities as
they, for instance, donate a turkey for
Thanksgiving or condemn drug use. while no
airtime is used to explain why a large portion
of the U.S. population needs food not only
on Thanksgiving, and why so many have no
reluctance for drug dealing, drive-bv shoot
ing etc., even if facing years in the peniten
tiary.
What signal does basketball star Michael
Jordan send the youth when he thinks he's so
poor that he ought to do commercials for
hot-dogs to compensate his annual income of

$40 million? Most likely no one will know
because there is no critical journalism in the
mass media today that would dare draw a
parallel between the ethics applied by such
celebrities and the 40,(XH (children who starve
to death each and every day.
Most journalists are as inept at generating
a decisive newscast as K RON-IV anchor
Wendy Tokuda is. It is very unlikely that
someone like Tokuda (with an annual
income of $K(X).(XK)) has the ability (or will)
to do any trustworthy news story about eco
nomic segregation, mostly because newscast
ers like her are partially the problem.
No greedy person would do anything that
goes in the opposite direction from where
their wallet is. However, it is strange that
KRON-IV could not see (or the
irony of spending hours of airtime to pro
mote Tokuda's return from NBC in Los
Angeles on an announcement plug where
Pokuda talks about how she knows "what's
most important in people's lives."
Even more ironic: her first news story was
"the big deal for the people to save up to $3
passing the May Bridge." During an entire
week, this "news" was a headline story on all
local news broadcasts.
Will we ever see any news stories on
"What effect docs a self-indulgent newscast
have on people today," or stories such as;
"News anchors who makes $Koo.(*>o per year
donate a turkey to the homeless." Not likely
from journalists who have divorced them

selves from the average person to whom they
report.
Lifestyle and ethies are lar stronger a
tutor than any "Say no to drugs" or "Stay in
school" announeement. Helped firmly by
the mass media, kids today are eonstantly
presented with the analogy between "suc
cess" and "money," It is very foolish to
believe that any poor and uneducated per
son would not be influenced by those greedy
role models who are given unlimited air time
and space.
It is even more ridiculous to believe that a
large portion of the population would not
experience the economic injustice they are
subjected to and, in return for that, generate
quite different criteria about what is "right"
and "wrong."
In the United States today. 4<) percent of
the wealth is in the hands of one percent of
the population.
I he greed in this country has create a
large sub-culture that mostly is comprised
of underrepresented people, making it hard
tor the rest of us to actually understand and
relate to the discrepancy of wealth and
human rights. It is therefore quite sad to see
someone who is majoring in philosophy writ
ing so much ibout so little, even though it
seems as if Rodgcrs will become a perfect
aspirant lor the news broadcast.

selves from the average person to whom they
report.
Lifestyle and ethies are lar stronger a
tutor than any "Say no to drugs" or "Stay in
school" announeement. Helped firmly by
the mass media, kids today are eonstantly
presented with the analogy between "suc
cess" and "money," It is very foolish to
believe that any poor and uneducated per
son would not be influenced by those greedy
role models who are given unlimited air time
and space.
It is even more ridiculous to believe that a
large portion of the population would not
experience the economic injustice they are
subjected to and, in return for that, generate
quite different criteria about what is "right"
and "wrong."
In the United States today. 4<) percent of
the wealth is in the hands of one percent of
the population.
I he greed in this country has create a
large sub-culture that mostly is comprised
of underrepresented people, making it hard
tor the rest of us to actually understand and
relate to the discrepancy of wealth and
human rights. It is therefore quite sad to see
someone who is majoring in philosophy writ
ing so much ibout so little, even though it
seems as if Rodgcrs will become a perfect
aspirant lor the news broadcast.
