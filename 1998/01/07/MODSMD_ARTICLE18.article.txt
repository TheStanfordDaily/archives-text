## Nagging, guilt and mixed messages The 						Farm's fundraising follies 
### 
This break, i
experienced some
thing amazing.
When 1 arrived at mv par
ents' house, awaiting me
were two — count 'em,
two — letters from Stan
ford begging for dona
tions. This is a new low.

So, being dumb, I decided to actually
read these two letters.
I he tirst one wasn't so bad, as money
grubbing noises go. It was a note from Ger
hard asking me to donate to the Stanford
Fund.
Now, this fund supports some great
things, like scholarships, URO grants and
eliminating CIV from the face of the planet.
I'd love to send them a fat wad.
That is, if I HAD a fat wad. Y'know,
you'd think that a school as supposedly
smart as Stanford would realize that a vast
proportion of its recently graduated under
graduate community is too damn poor to
give money to anybody. Especially, say, if
they have a cartload of student loans to pay
off. Or, better vet, if they're STILL STU
DENTS AT STANFORD.
Moreover, why do we only get requests
for money? Why do we never get letters
asking us to volunteer services or to do
actual work to benefit Stanford? For exam
ple. the ridiculously undirected nature of
Stanford's fund-raising efforts seems to
demand more thought, not more money.

Shrugging all this off, I read the second
letter. It reminded me that Jane Stanford,
wife of the senator who opened our fair uni
versity, sold all her jewels to keep the
school open after the big Leland died. The
rest of the letter contained a muffled clear
ing of the throat and the presentation of an
empty palm.
(iuilt is not a very effective way to moti
vate intelligent people. Most people who
use guilt as a means of coercion do so
because they have no rational basis for
argument (or no rationality, period). Thus,
a little bit of thought can typically nullify
arguments based on guilt.
Consider: my mother teaches elemen
tary school in the state with the worst pub
lic schools in our nation.
Consider: most (if the people on my
father's side of my family have had cancer
and heart problems: many haven't survived.
Consider: my parents have been strug
gling with our increasingly unjust judicial
system for years, and my father died trying
to improve it.
Consider further: I've spent six years at a
university that preaches breathlessly about
ensuring the fundamental rights of human
beings, respecting the value of human life
and supporting those who struggle against
the injustices of the world.
So — according to Stanford, where
should I donate my money?
All this begs the question: how is it that
a private business like Stanford can request

donations without looking like either an
incompetent business or a bunch of hypo
critical greedballs?
If Stanford can't operate without heavy
donations, then isn't something fundamen
tally wrong with the economics of Stanford,
Inc.?
If all these donations are just icing on the
cake, what gives?
It takes a lot of guts for Stanford to
charge so much money from its undergrad
uates and their parents, potentially leaving
them in tons of debt.
It takes incredible courage to follow that
with donation demands for the rest of our
lives.
And to follow in turn with the assertion
that donating to Stanford is an ethical obli
gation. .. well, this might be a good point to
consider the fine line between courage and
stupidity.
All in all, Stanford can expect another
four years without donations from me. If
they keep this nagging up, its going to take
a lot longer before I cough anything up
(besides phlegm and bile). I'd rather help
fund groups that educate our young, better
our health and improve our government.
You see, that's what Stanford taught me
to care about.

real address, or his head might explode.
