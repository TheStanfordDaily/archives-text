## Tomoeh Murakami From Stanford to Tokyo: Calling the world home 
### 
Hundreds of people ail very
fashionable, carefree and spirited
passed hy as I stood .it the corner of
a busy Tokyo intersection. With a twinge of
longing and a dash of scnlimentalisni, my
eyes followed their footsteps disappearing
into the shadows of the holiday lights beau
tifully illuminating the frosty, white city.
It was hard to believe three years had
passed since I last saw Tokyo — the heart
of my native country — wrapped in its
majestic wintry blanket. My most recent
trip back to Japan, almost a full year ago,
had been a brief stay with my grandparents
in Osaka.
Over the years, each trip to \ isit my fam
ily, currently living in the lokyo suburbs,
had become shorter and less frequent. This
summer. I'd hastily down right over Japan,
from I long Kong where I was working, to
the United States, without even stopping to
realize how much I missed my country.
One day, 1 was meeting two of my
friends, whom I'd known for more than 15
years, for an evening out in lokyo. With
only a few days having passed since return
ing from the Farm. I was still busv absorbing
all the changes that had taken place since I
last left this city that I love so much.
My friend, Mayuko, and I casually talked
of the old times as we waited for another
buddy to arrive. As we chatted, I gazed at
the seemingly endless l okyo crowd pour
out of every building and cross the street.

bustling with laughter and vibrant energy
it felt great to be back.
"It's good to see you and so cool of you
to come back and check in on us every once
in a while," Mayuko was saying. She is one
of the people I always make a point to see
when I am home.
"Doesn't it get kind ol weird though? I
mean, now after all this time, you must feel
a little awkward, like a guest in your own
country?" she continued, glancing at me as
I marveled at all the high-rises that hadn't
previously existed.
"You'd always been a little 'off.' but now
it's obvious. You're completely different
so American you're almost like a 'gaijin
(foreigner)'."
I stopped staring at the passersby and
turned to face my dear friend.
"What do you mean, 'a gaijin?"' I asked.
Of course I'm Japanese, I thought, pic
turing in my mind the Japanese passpot t I'd
just used to reenter the country, and the I I
student visa I must present to immigration
whenever I return to the United Stales.
What was my friend saying? Mayuko
and I had competed in the same sport
together for 15 years and had remained
friends through the eight moves my family
made all over the country; she'd stayed a
constant face among the blur of changing
faces in my childhood memories, until the
end of our freshman year in college when I
transferred to Stanford. II there was anyone

who knew me inside out. I thought it would
he her.
How eould Mayuko. who'd never been
to the I Jnited States, possibly know w hat ;m
American' was anyway?
Me. ' si> American?" I don't think so.
Despite my years in California and the time
I spent as an athlete training in the U.S.. I
stiil don't know if there is such a person.
Hut I certainly know I didn't feel Amer
ican.'" lust a few days before my departure,
when I met with my immigration / visa
lawyer, it had taken all my willpower to pav
attention to the lawyer's complicated expla
nations of the types of working vis;is and
documents I'll need to work in the I nited
States after graduation.
"... So if you decide to work lor this
newspaper first, and forget to apply for a
separate business visa before going to work
for the other paper, that'll make you an ilk
gal immigrant. You'll then have exactly 10
days to evacuate the country. You must,
must reapply for a new visa even time,
okay? Do you understand?"
What?! Evacuate? l en days to leave the
United States? I definitely am not "com
pletely American." as Mayuko would put it.
No matter how surprised people in the
United States may be when they find out
that I'm from Japan. I know I'm not com
pletely "the same."
I tried to explain to Mayuko that I felt
very different in the United Stales, too.

"Don t you think that's sad?" she said,
looking a bit frustrated, o; perhaps con
fused. "I mean, don't you want a place you
can call home, a place where you know you
belong?"
An awkward silence hung over us. .is
Mayuko saw her own confusion reflected in
my eyes, lo her relief, we saw our other
friend approaching, and the conversation
was dropped.
I'\c been thinking about it a lot since,
however. And although I didn't feel like
admitting it lo Mayuko. or ;<> myself at the
time. I know my friend is at least partly
right.
I (lie. there have been times and places
when I'd felt a little off. like an outsider at
my own party, to borrow her words Hut I
had quicklv attributed this feeling to our
family's mobile lifestyle and to m\ \<>uth as
a competitive athlete constantly going awaj
from home and school.
My family no longer moves around, and I
am 110 longer an athlete However. I discov
er the feeling of being an outsider is bigger
and tugs stronger at my mind each time I
return home.
Hut does one truly need a "home?" I
know, with the same certainty that I know
I'm Japanese, that I cannot exist without my
family and friends in Japan. However, is it
necessary for me to feel like I truly belong
here? Or in the I nited States, or any where
in the world?

Ever since I can remember, my life has
bjen a succession «.»! new faces and places,
of hellos and farewells.
I he result is that I fortunately have peo
ple and places all over the globe that I
know I can return to and siiv hello, anil
know I'll always be welcome. Years of
moving around have granted me the ability
to adapt to new surroundings and to sa\
brave good-byes. ()\er time. I have learned
that every departure is followed by jo\s ol
pleasant surprises and new challenges to
conquer.
As 1 continue to pursue a mobile
lifestyle. I am nothing but grateful for the
confidence each place and every face has
enabled me to huild. I know that no matter
where I take myself. I can he happv.
II having a place to "belong" means giv
ing up all these places and faces and what
the\ ve taught me. then I don't want a place
to belong, a single place to call home I can
never discard what I've experienced in
lokvo and in every other ut\. because
they've been my greatest jo\s of life and
serve as guides to even more and greater
joys I ve yet to experience.

Of course I'm Japanese, I thought, pic
turing in my mind the Japanese passpot t I'd
just used to reenter the country, and the I I
student visa I must present to immigration
whenever I return to the United Stales.
What was my friend saying? Mayuko
and I had competed in the same sport
together for 15 years and had remained
friends through the eight moves my family
made all over the country; she'd stayed a
constant face among the blur of changing
faces in my childhood memories, until the
end of our freshman year in college when I
transferred to Stanford. II there was anyone

who knew me inside out. I thought it would
he her.
How eould Mayuko. who'd never been
to the I Jnited States, possibly know w hat ;m
American' was anyway?
Me. ' si> American?" I don't think so.
Despite my years in California and the time
I spent as an athlete training in the U.S.. I
stiil don't know if there is such a person.
Hut I certainly know I didn't feel Amer
ican.'" lust a few days before my departure,
when I met with my immigration / visa
lawyer, it had taken all my willpower to pav
attention to the lawyer's complicated expla
nations of the types of working vis;is and
documents I'll need to work in the I nited
States after graduation.
"... So if you decide to work lor this
newspaper first, and forget to apply for a
separate business visa before going to work
for the other paper, that'll make you an ilk
gal immigrant. You'll then have exactly 10
days to evacuate the country. You must,
must reapply for a new visa even time,
okay? Do you understand?"
What?! Evacuate? l en days to leave the
United States? I definitely am not "com
pletely American." as Mayuko would put it.
No matter how surprised people in the
United States may be when they find out
that I'm from Japan. I know I'm not com
pletely "the same."
I tried to explain to Mayuko that I felt
very different in the United Stales, too.

"Don t you think that's sad?" she said,
looking a bit frustrated, o; perhaps con
fused. "I mean, don't you want a place you
can call home, a place where you know you
belong?"
An awkward silence hung over us. .is
Mayuko saw her own confusion reflected in
my eyes, lo her relief, we saw our other
friend approaching, and the conversation
was dropped.
I'\c been thinking about it a lot since,
however. And although I didn't feel like
admitting it lo Mayuko. or ;<> myself at the
time. I know my friend is at least partly
right.
I (lie. there have been times and places
when I'd felt a little off. like an outsider at
my own party, to borrow her words Hut I
had quicklv attributed this feeling to our
family's mobile lifestyle and to m\ \<>uth as
a competitive athlete constantly going awaj
from home and school.
My family no longer moves around, and I
am 110 longer an athlete However. I discov
er the feeling of being an outsider is bigger
and tugs stronger at my mind each time I
return home.
Hut does one truly need a "home?" I
know, with the same certainty that I know
I'm Japanese, that I cannot exist without my
family and friends in Japan. However, is it
necessary for me to feel like I truly belong
here? Or in the I nited States, or any where
in the world?

Ever since I can remember, my life has
bjen a succession «.»! new faces and places,
of hellos and farewells.
I he result is that I fortunately have peo
ple and places all over the globe that I
know I can return to and siiv hello, anil
know I'll always be welcome. Years of
moving around have granted me the ability
to adapt to new surroundings and to sa\
brave good-byes. ()\er time. I have learned
that every departure is followed by jo\s ol
pleasant surprises and new challenges to
conquer.
As 1 continue to pursue a mobile
lifestyle. I am nothing but grateful for the
confidence each place and every face has
enabled me to huild. I know that no matter
where I take myself. I can he happv.
II having a place to "belong" means giv
ing up all these places and faces and what
the\ ve taught me. then I don't want a place
to belong, a single place to call home I can
never discard what I've experienced in
lokvo and in every other ut\. because
they've been my greatest jo\s of life and
serve as guides to even more and greater
joys I ve yet to experience.
