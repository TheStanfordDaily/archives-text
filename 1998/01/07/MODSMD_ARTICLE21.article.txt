## 'Va' talks life, gym problems 
### 
/ first noticed Vanessa Nygaard my sophomore year.
She was the most animated basketball player / had ever
seen, and when I covered women 's basketball last season
I discovered she had the off-court personality to match.
Through a collaboration of the minds we decided thai
The Daily needed Vanessa's perspective. I convinced my
editors to give us a column where we discuss the relevant
(or not so relevant) issues in the world of athletics.
Va (as she is called) has the insider's view and adds a
completely new dimension to sportswriting. This week's
topic: those people who infest gyms and only work out
because they think they look good doing it.

Anyone who's ever been to Arrillaga knows exactly
who we're talking about. You try to avoid these people,
but they're always on the machine you want to use. And
no matter what time you visit the gym. they're AL
WAYS there.
They're the people who try so hard to look the part,
but somehow you can never get past their Flashdance
headband or the shorts that are just a little too short for
the weight room.
Kohin: Vanessa, you work out a lot so you must en
counter these irritating gym-people more than most. In
your expert opinion, what brings them to the gym?
Va: Since 1 don't play volleyball. I don't own any span
dex, and 1 threw my Flashdance headband away in the
third grade. I think these people suffer from an under
mining need to express their athleticism to others. They
cannot just be: they must be seen. Of course, I really
don't know anything about it.
Kohin: Well you're in a position to be bothered by these
people quite frequently. What do you think is the most
bothersome thing about trying to work out in the mid
dle of these people?
Va: To be honest, most people bother me. But you're
right, these people really stick out. I think the thing that
bothers me the most is their complete lack of a sense of
reality. 1 wonder: Do they own any mirrors in their
houses other than fun-house mirrors? I'm glad people
work out and are concerned about their health. I wish
more people did. Hut don't ruin other people's experi
ence by your overzealousness for your own experience.
What's with the American flag bandanna on your head?
Or wearing an Izod button-up to work out? I try to
make the world a more beautiful place, and I just wish
more people would.
Kohin: Let's be a little more specific for the readers. I'm
sure you've had many encounters with this sort of thing,
(live us some specifics from one of your most recent ex
periences.
Va: Well, I was recently home for Christmas break. And
of course, being the diligent, dedicated athlete that I am,
1 went to work out at my local gym. I needed to use the
step-mill machine. There was only one in the place, and
there was this woman on it. Let's just call her Roxanne.
You'd think an hour would be an adequate amount of
time for anyone to work out on a machine if you're
working hard. So I waited. 1 did a few curls. Got a drink
water of course. Returned to find Roxanne still on
the step-mill. But she wasn't just using the machine in its
conventional sense; she was adding her own Olivia
Newton-John-esquc movements choreographed to the
blaring Abba tunes coming from her walkman as she
slowly walked up the stairs. Now I like Abba as much as
the next person. But you've got to draw the line some
where. I needed the machine and this butt-floss-clad
woman wasn't going to give me a break. She knew I was
waiting: that's the kind of thing I hate.
Kohin: Well, what do you think the nonviolent, politi
cally correct Stanford student should do when he or she
encounters this situation at the gym?
Va: That's a good question. My first suggestion would
be to pretend the person was from Cal. therefore elimi
nating the need to respect them. But as I learned in my
second year of CIV, you should take the high road. Go
on with your workout: get bigger, faster and stronger.
And let others continue their rueful existence.
Kohin: But don't you find it's difficult. 1 know personal
ly my friends and 1 are often so bothered by these peo
ple we make fun of them for hours after our workout.
Do you find this is true for you as well?
Va: Well sadly, it's true for me also. But I think that's
their goal. So we as responsible members of society
need to say. "Hey. the buck stops here. Buddy." 1 refuse
to talk one more time about the guy who shaves his
whole body, even his eyebrows. Enough is enough. As
the song says "We're not going to take it. Oh. no, we're
not going to take it. We're not going to take it any
more."
Kohin: Well that's all for this week 11 anything we've
said reminds you of yourself, remember the millennium
approaches!

Vanessa would like to inform readers that Walt Dis
