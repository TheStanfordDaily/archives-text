# Baseball wins early praise
## Stanford lands two preseason All-Americans, top rank 
### Brian Eule Contributing writer 
Junior C had Hutchinson had
come in from a late practice and was
on his way to a meeting when he was
handed a press release to read. He
glanced down and smiled modestly
upon learning that he and fellow
Cardinal pitcher junior Jeff Austin
were named to the 1998 Baseball
America Preseason All-America
Team, selected by major league
scouting directors.
"I take it all with a grain of salt."
Hutchinson said. "I'm flattered,
(hut) preseason doesn't mean
much."
The two sport star is used to high
expectations in the preseason, and
this year is no exception for the
Stanford baseball team. For the
third time in the last four years the
Cardinal begins the season in the
number one spot in Baseball Amer
ica's preseason poll. This year, how
ever. Collegiate Baseball selected
Stanford as its top pick as well.
"Last year we were also predict
ed number one." I lutchinson said of
the team that finished tied for third

at the College World Series. "I don't
think much of it at all. I just can't
wait to get out there and plav ball."
For the first time since Hutchin
son joined the Stanford football
team, the quarterback did not get to
play in a postseason bowl game, thus
freeing up time for him to focus on
baseball.
"This is the first year that I had a
chance to get a head start (on the
baseball season)," he said. "I stayed
up over winter break and worked on
mechanics with the pitching coach."
With his fastball clocked at
speeds up to 97 miles per hour.
Hutchinson turned down a 1.5 mil
lion dollar bonus from the Atlanta
Braves in the 1995 baseball draft
and is currently described as. "a lock
to be a first round pick this June be
cause of his huge potential as a pro
fessional," according to Collegiate
Baseball.

"I take it all with a grain of salt.
I'm flattered, (but) preseason
doesn't mean much.''

Hutchinson is not the only Cardi
nal to turn down Major League
Baseball. Austin too turned down
an offer during the 1995 baseball
draft in to come to Stanford, and he
too has to live up to great expecta
tions. Baseball America selected
Austin as one of its top lOcollegiate
prospects for the 1998 draft.
Moving to the bullpen mid-sea
son last year. Austin had an out
standing performance in the College
World Series, earning him a spot on
the All-College World Series team.
Hutchinson and Austin will have
to try and fill the large void left b\
Kyle Peterson, a Cardinal All -
American last season, who went to
the Milwaukee Brewers in the first
round of the baseball draft. Peter
son went 11-3 in 1997 and ended his
career at Stanford with a 35-9
record, tying him for second on
Stanford's all-time win list with
major leaguer Jack McDow ell.
Stanford's star pitching staff
di>esn't stop with Hutchinson and
Austin, however. Named to Base
ball America's IW7 Summer Ail-
American Team, junior Brent
Hoard returns to the mound after
having an outstanding summer with
a 0.72 ERA in the Cape Cod
League.

"We're going to be a gre;it team.
()ur pitching staff is going to he phe
nomenal." Hoard said.
"You always want to stay at num
ber one.' he added of the early pred
ications. "We definitely want to fin
ish the year that way."

The preseason polls, while flat
tering. add weight to the shoulders
of other players. Sophomore Jell
Ri/zo, who will compete for the
starting|idesignated hitter spot,
knows that while the rankings are
justified, at the same time thev mav
have negative consequences.
"I'm optimistic." he said. "I
mean, we have three first-rounders
pitching for us (Hut) I think the
teams th.it are ranked reallv hieh are
somewhat ;it a disadvantage
With a few roadtnps earlv on in
the season, including a trip to Texas.
Ri/yo tears these high expectations
may make the team and its coach e v

"It we blow a couple games in the
preseason he'll co all nuts\ It puts
more pressure on the team and
(Head Coach Mark Marquess)
too." Ri/zo added. "It's quite an
honor though."
