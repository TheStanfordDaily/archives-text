# Unbeaten start is basketball throwback

The last time a Stanford men's basketball
team started the season 13-0, Franklin Roo
sevelt was entering his second term in the
White House. The 1936-37 Indians went un
defeated through 14 games en route to a Pacif
ic C oast Conference championship, the high
est honor for a West ('oast team before the ad
vent of the NCAA tournament.
Sixty years ago. Stanford relied on an All-
American scorer (1 lank 1 uisetti. one of the pi
oneers of the one-handed shot) and an up
tempo offense to cruise to a 25-2 record, the

school's best ever. In a lime when Ihc majority
of the- PCX' played slow, low scoring basket
hall. Stanford excelled by scoring quick In and
often.
1 he IW7-W team is one victory away from
equaling that phenomenal start, having
cruised to a 13-0 record entering Saturday's
meeting with California Ihc decades have
changed the nature of the game and the Stan
ford team nickname, but one constant has en
dured: I ike their I I)R era counterparts, the
Cardinal players are winning by playing in
contrast to the conference norm.
Quick players, especially guards, dominate
the Pacific 10 Conference. Preseason league
favorite Arizona won the national champi
onship last year without a true center and is led
b\ guards Mike Bibbv and Miles Simon.

UCLA's J R. Henderson leads the Pac-1() in
scoring, but his Brum team plays an up-tempo
game that hinges on the athletic skills of guards
Toby Bailey. Earl Watson and Baron Davis.
Stanford, in comparison, is a team that wins
the old-fashioned way â€” with defense. The
Cardinal is allowing a mere 60.2 points per
game, tops in the conference and 14 less than
either UCLA or Arizona. Stanford also leads
the Pac-lOin rebounding (41.6 game) and re
bounds allowed (29.6). and its opponents are
shooting just 37.9 percent from the field
I lead coach Mike Montgomery made team
defense a high priority this year, and his play
ers have responded." The kids are really work
ing on the defensive end." Montgomery said
.ittcr a two-game sweep of the C )regon schools
that saw Stanford's opponents shoot just over
30 percent from the floor. "I tell the kids that is
what we are going to need to do best and they
have bought into it."
Montgomery is a very gixxl coach, but it
wouldn't take a Jack Ramsey to see that this
year's Cardinal squad has the tixils to shut
teams down. With the deepest front line in the
conference possibly in the nation - and a
backcourt that has been pleasantly consistent
thus far, Stanford certainly has the athletes to
play solid defense But while individual ath
letes can often score enough points to win
games, it takes teamwork to excel on the other
end of the court.
leamwork. fortunately, is another Stan
ford strength I"he Cardinal certainly misses
Brevin Knight this year, but in his absence the
team has adopted a sort ot "no name" persona
that it uses to great advantage.
Scoring numbers are a gixxl example: Stan
ford ranks fourth in the Pac-10 with an SO S
points/game average, but its highest-scoring
