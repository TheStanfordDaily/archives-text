Sixty-one years.
It's the oldest standing record in
the histor\ of Stanford basketball.
Fourteen consecutive victories to
start of a season. No other Cardinal
team has come closer then 10 wins to
begin the year.
Now the Nik 7 Cardinal (13-0.2-0
Pacific 10 Conference) find them
selves one victor\ away from match
ing that start
But the squad is much
more significant than the record
alone could indicate. At 25-2. the
John Bunn-coachcd Indians still have
the highest single-season winning
percentage in school history
Tliey also had the leadership of
Hank Luisetti. the school's only
three-time All-American. Luisetti
helped revolutionize the sport of bas
ketball as the most prominent player
to begin shooting the ball one-hand

I"he Indians opened the season in
remarkable fashion by crushing UC-

through two more easy victories be

UCLA. The meetings were no con
test. as the Indians won both games
by a combined 56 points, Luisetti
combined for 40 over the span.
Next up for Bunn and his squad
was a trip to Cal. where the Indians
had lost four straight and nine out of
their last 10. The Cal jinx was finally
snapped however, as Art Stocfen's
12 points led Stanford to the 51-35
victory, despite the loss of forward
I lowie Turner, who sprained his foot
during the game.
The final victory of the streak
came against St. Mary's in a 50-23
sleeper. But where the record ends,
the true drama of the year begins.
The first loss of the year came
against conference powerhouse
USC, 42-39. But despite the heart
breaking loss, the Cardinal bounced
back the next dav and downed the

Trojans, 61-49, pulling themselves
back into the race for the conference
championship and showing that they
were able to make the Trojans fight
for the Pacific C oast crown.
The Indians would rattle off an
other eight consecutive wins, before
suffering the second and final loss of
the year to Cal, 44-31.
But this came only after the Indi
ans swept another two-game series
from the Trojans, clinching their first
outright South Pacific Coast Confer
ence title in 17 years. Team captain
Dinty Moore stepped up for the
squad in place of the injured I uisctti.
scoring 26 points over the two games.
The team capped off its season
with two close wins over Washington
State, 31-28 and 41-40. to claim the
overall conference crown. The lack
of an NCAA tournament stopped
Stanford's season there, though the
Indians were voted national champi
ons bv the Helms Foundation.
