## Researchers prove enigmatic behavior of NK cells 
### Rollin Hu Editorial staff 
Extensive new work performed
by Stanford researchers has shed
new light on the behavior of a rela
tively obscure white blood cell, and it
may lead to a better method of typ
ing recipients of bone marrow trans
plants. The research, featured in the
most recent issue of Immunity, was
conducted by postdoctoral fellows
Mark Uhrberg and Nick Valiante,
both in the lab of Peter Parham, pro
fessor of structural biology.
Uhrberg and Valiante conducted
their research on Natural Killer
(NK) cells, which have only recently
been extensively examined. Most
immunologists had been focusing on
T and B cells, which perform the
lion's share of the adaptive immune
response. NK cells were assumed to
behave the same way as T and B
cells. The new research seems to in
validate that assumption.
T and B cells have receptors on
their surfaces that can attach to for
eign proteins, such as those ex

pressed in viruses and bacteria.
When B cells recognize a viral pro
tein with their receptors, for exam
ple, they immediately begin to se
crete antibodies, which can then at
tach to the viruses and aggregate
them â€” allowing them to be dis
posed. T cells have similar receptors,
which can detect foreign particles
expressed on infected cell surfaces.
Once the T cell finds such an infect
ed cell, it kills it, along with all of the
viruses or bacteria hiding inside.
Until the late 1980s, scientists as
sumed that NK cells also had a recep
tor that recognized foreign proteins.
However, a revolutionary "missing
self" model was proposed in 19K6 to
explain the behavior of NK cells. Sci
entists had observed that many
tumor cells were attacked by NK
cells, while the healthy cells around
them were spared. Researchers sug
gested that NK cells "know" if a cell
is missing certain essential compo
nents, and they kill those cells.
These components were soon
found to be human leukocyte anti
gens (HLA) that exist on almost all

cells of the body and identify that in
dividual's cells from everyone else's.
According to the model, receptors
on the NK cells look for these HLA
antigens, not foreign proteins. When
the NK cells find them, they are in
hibited from killing. However, when
NK cells encounter cells without the
correct HLA antigens, such as
tumor cells, they kill them.
Though various NK inhibitory
receptors have been characterized,
no one has methodically tested the
missing-self model until now.
Valiante and Uhrberg analyzed
more than 1(X) single NK cells from
two unrelated people whose HLA
antigens had been characterized.
They documented NK cells' killing
responses to different types of H LA
antigens. Eventually, they conclu
sively proved that every NK cell
could be inhibited by at least one
HLA antigen.
They also determined that each
NK cell could display up to 11 differ
ent receptors on its surface, virtually
