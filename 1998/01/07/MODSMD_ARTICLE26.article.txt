Research on gas hydrates may reveal new
sources of fuel

Researchers at Stanford are leading the investigation
of gas hydrates — poorly understood patches of ice on
the ocean floor containing pea-sized bubbles of
methane or other natural gases.
Scientists estimate that 10 trillion metric tons of hy
drocarbons lie trapped in ice under the sea as gas hy
drate, double the combined sum of all other hvdrocar-

Scientists envision that in the future, with development of recovery
procedures, gas hydrates could become a new fuel source. Additional
ly, scientists suspect that if global temperatures continue to rise, then
some of those undersea ice deposits could be destabilized, triggering
the suboceanic landslides that cause tsunamis.
Among those exploring these formations is Dean of Earth Sciences
Franklin Orr, who along with collaborators is using a robotic sub
mersible to observe formation of ice around nascent methane bubbles.
()ther labs are trying to understand the formation of gas hydrates by
duplicating the high pressure, low temperature conditions on the sea
floor.

Model developed to aceount for red sprites

Researchers from Stanford's Very Low Frequency
Research Group lead by Electrical Engineering Prof,
t Jmran Inan have developed a model which accounts for
the atmospheric phenomenon called "red sprites."
Discovered only recently, red sprites are bright flash
es of light seen above powerful thunderstorms at alti
tudes of 30 to 50 miles. According to the authors of the

study, those bright flashes may actually consist of thousands of channels
of glowing gas only a few meters wide.
"It's as if you set off 10,000 sky rockets at the same time," said Tim
othy F. Bell, a senior research associate in the group.
The channels of ionized gas form, the group contends, when large
pockets of uncompensated electrical charge form above thunderheads
after a lightening discharge. 11 the magnitude of the charge is large
enough, electrons flow upwards through the atmosphere, ionizing sur
rounding air molecules by knocking oil electrons near their path.
The flowing electrons produce an instantaneous blue flash, but the
ionized air molecules emit a reddish glow for a few milliseconds there
after.
