# Profile: Mooney's passionate for plants

### Molly Masland 
Dwarfing the rows of book
shelves and stacks of papers in Hal
Mooney's office is a huge, color map
of the world that takes up an entire
wall. It looms over Mooney's desk
serving as a constant reminder of the
global nature of his work.
A world renowned ecologist,
Mooney has taught at Stanford for
nearly 30 years and currently holds
the Paul S. Achilles Professorship in
Environmental Biology. His
ground-breaking research on car
bon use in plants and the impact of
global change on the world's ecosys
tems has provided a theoretical
framework for the understanding of
ecosystem processes. Currently he is
conducting a study at Stanford's
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve to
determine the effects of increased
carbon dioxide in plants, important
research given the growing problem
of "greenhouse gases."

Not surprisingly, most things in
Mooney's life revolve around plants.
Sitting in his office, he pointed to the
giant map on his wall as he described
his frequent research expeditions
around the world, categorized ac
cording to vegetation types.
"I started out in the alpine zones
in California, Chile, South Africa.
Australia and France." he said casu
ally. "Then I got interested in deserts
and worked in Death Valley and the
Atacama desert in ( 'hile as well as in
the southwestern deserts of Africa.
After that. I got interested in tropi
cal dry forests and went to Mexico."
In the last year, Mooney** ft'-
search has also taken him to Patago
nia, the Kalahari desert. Samoa and
Baja, Calif.
"I guess 1 get around," he added
with a smile.
Mooney is a disarmingly kind
man. popular among his students
and colleagues. Occasionally known
to play the flamenco guitar late into

the evening, he also keeps his stu
dents entertained.
As a teenager growing up in
Marin County, Mooney wanted tc
earn some extra money and by
chance landed a part-time job at a
local nursery. His after-school work
sparked what was to become a life
long interest in plants.
After graduating from high
school. Mooney chose to attend I (
Santa Barbara, which was at the
time the only university in the Unit
ed States offering a major in plant bi
ology. He went on to receive a doc
torate in 1960 from Duke I niversi
ty. After teaching at UCLA, ht_- left
to conic to Stanford in 1965.
Mooney's early research focused
on proving the theory that similar
environments produce similar evo
lution in organisms. To test out the
hypothesis, he compared the ecosys
tems in southern ("alifornia and cen
tral Chile, which have similar envi
ronments but are too distant for life

to hii\c evolved from the same ge
netic stock. The results of the stud\
showed that although higher organ
isms such as animals evolve some
what differently, plants evolve ser\
similarly according to their environ
ments.
Later. Moones tocused his re
search more specificalK on plant re
source allocation, or how a plant
chooses to use its available resources
such as nutrients, sunlight and water
"A plant's resources are like its
currency." Mooney explained. Ihe
plant has to decide, how am I going
to spend m\ money? Am I going to
make flowers, or roots or leaves' '
Like anything, the investment must
give the greatest economic return.
I hrough his studies. Moonev
found that carbon plays a significant
role in determining what a plant
does with its resources and is. there
lore. a major influence on ecitsystem
development.
Building on previous research,
Mooney is conducting a study at
the Jasper Ridge preserve to deter
mine the effects of increased levels
of carbon dioxide on ecosystems.
So far. the study has shown that
higher levels of carbon dioxide im
prove plants' efficiency in using
water, ultimately resulting in more
moisture left in the soil. According
to Mooney, this result could have
potentially dramatic effects on the
diversity of plant species in an
ecosystem and subsequently the
other organisms that depend on
them.
Although the Jasper Ridge study
sheds light on the possible ramifica
tions of the "greenhouse effect."
Mooney hesitated to extrapolate
the results too far.
"The results of the study have
just made the story more complicat
ed." he contended. "You can't
make simple predictions."
In addition to his teaching and
research projects, Mooney is in
volved with numerous national and
international organizations focused
on ecological research. Currently he
serves as the secretary general of the
International Council of Scientific
Unions, which is similar to an envi
ronmental United Nations.
