# Plastic surgeons consider liability issues regarding computer imaging technology
## 
### Lynne Mercer Contributing writer 
As early as plastic surgeons
began incorporating computer
imaging techniques into practice.
While computer imaging enables
patients to visualize potential surgi
cal outcomes more easily, questions
remain about whether it leaves the
surgeon more vulnerable to a law
suit if surgical results do not meet
the patient's expectations.
"Doctors who talked about this
would give anecdotal advice," said
facial plastic surgeon R. James koch
of Stanford Medical Center. Ac
cording to Koch, doctors disagreed
on liability issues, on whether to give
computer printouts to patients and
even on whether to keep the com
puter images or to destroy them.

kiKh researched the literature
and found that only about nine med
ical papers on computer imaging for
plastic surgery had been published.
He then approached attorney An
drea E. Chavez to investigate the
legal issues. "I knew computer imag
ing was becoming more popular,
and this is something that needed to
be done." said kt>ch.
The recently published report
concludes that if used judiciously,
computer imaging can be beneficial
to both doctor and patient. There is
some potential for abuse. Hut by
adopting a few simple precautions,
doctors can substantially reduce
their vulnerability to legal claims
"Overall, from a legal point of
view, computer imaging will de
crease legal liability if used proper
ly." said koch. "When used in a re

alistic way. computer imaging is .1
valuable tool," he added, "especially
in terms of communicating better
with the patient and for demonstrat
ing what is possible."
"Computer imaging has the po
tential to make everybody look
great, but a doctor must be aware of
his own level of skill and demon
strate only what is realistically possi
ble," said koch.
Koch estimates that 15 to 20 per
cent of plastic surgeons nationwide
use computer imaging, although the
technique is probably more com
monly used in California, where
plastic surgery is more common.
In the article. Koch said that a re-
Mew of federal and state case law
failed to reveal any cases directly re
garding computer imaging in the
past 10 years.

However, the lack of cases does
not necessarily mean that the risk is
negligible. As computer imagine be
comes more available, the authors
hypothesize, economic pressures on
less established plastic surgeons may
lead them to use computer imaging
as a marketing tool, raising patients'
expectations by demonstrating
overly optimistic results.
The legal analysis in their land
mark paper led to the conclusion that
producing a computer image for a
patient does not necessarily consti
tute a contract to produce that result.
"But surgeons must be conservative
so as not to mislead the patient." said
Koch. And. the\ definiteh should
not delete the records. "Doctors
should treat the photos in the same
way that they treat \ rays, .is part of
the medical record." he concluded.
