Several of you have been asking
about Phen-Fen, so I'll try to pro
vide you with an update:
Fenfluramine and phentermine
are anorectic agents individually ap
proved by the FDA. They may pro
duce weight reductions in many pa
tients when taken concurrently. In
19%, the total number of prescrip
tions in the I 'nited States alone for
fenfluramine and phentermine was
in excess of IS million.
Earlier this year the FDA pulled
the famous weight loss drug Phen-

Fen (Phcntermine-Fenfluramine)
off the market in response to sever
al reports of harmful side effects by
individuals on a Phen-Fen regimen.
The horror stories continue to roll
in. with patients suffering problems
associated with anything from heart
valve regurgitation to altered be
havior.
According to a study done at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester. Minn.,
valvular heart disease was identified
in 24 women who were treated with
Phen-Fen who previously had no
history of cardiac problems. The
mean age of these women was ap
proximately 44 years; all underwent

a Phen-Fen regimen for
about one year before de
veloping any heart prob-
Wf' lems. Eight of these
women had newly docu
mented pulmonary hyper-
i i J :

tension and cardiac
surgery was required in
five of these women as of July IW7.
Their valves were noted as hav
ing a glistened, white appearance,
and histopathological findings indi
cated plaque-like adhercnces to the
valve leaflets and chordal structures
with a "stuck-on" appearance. The
study reported that these patients
showed symptoms of a murmur
(back flow of blot*! through a valve
that does not close properly).
My advice to those of you who
were taking this drug as a weight loss
agent is to contact your primary care
physician or dietitian about the regi
men vou were taking and what side

effects may be involved as a result of
prolonged exposure to this drug.
GDear Health Forum,
I've heard on several
different occasions that
there is "gtxxl cholesterol"
and "bad cholesterol." Can you
please explain and clarify this issue?

A Dear Jennifer,
To start, cholesterol is
a waxy substance that oc
curs naturally in all parts
of the body, and to the surprise of
many people, your hxlv and its sys
tems need a certain amount of chtv
lesterol to function properly. It's
only when our cholesterol levels get
abnormally high that we need to
worry about risks to our health.
Cholesterol is present in cell
membranes in every cell of vour

Kxly including the brain, nerves,
liver, intestines, heart and sexual or
gans. Your body uses cholesterol to
priKiucc several hormones, vitamin
I) and acids that aid in fat digestion.
You are absolutely right there
are two kinds of cholesterol, so to
speak. They exist in your body in the
form iif lipoproteins ("lipo" mean
ing fat and "protein" meaning pro
tein). Just like oil and water, choles
terol (a fatty, oily substance) and
blood (which has a high water con
tent) don't mix very well In order to
be able to travel in the bkxxistream.
the bodv packages cholesterol with
protein in the liver, thus making a
lipoprotein.
low Density Lipoproteins
(LDLs) are the infamous "bad"
cholesterol molecules that play a
very large role in cardiovascular and
vascular disease. LDLs carry most
of the cholesterol in the bltxxi and

the cholesterol troni I 1)1 s is the
major souree ol plaque buildup that
causes narrowing of the arteries in
the bod\ I'hus. the more 1 1)1 cho
lesterol in your Mood, the greater is
vour risk lot heart disease.
High Densitx l ipoproteins
(HDLs) are the gcxxl cholesterol
molecules in your body 111)1 s
carry cholesterol in the Mood from
several parts of the bodv back to the
liver, which facilitates removal of
cholesterol from the system. There
fore. HDL s help to prevent choles
terol from collecting in arteries in
the form of plaque.
