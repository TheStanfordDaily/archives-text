In an era of increasing govern
ment cutbacks, there's a growing
need for top management skills in
nonprofit organizations and students
who have those skills. At the head of
the class in preparing students for
nonprofit management is Stanford's
Graduate School of Business.
Each year, the Business School
graduates 25 to 30 students certified
in nonprofit management as a part of
their Public Management Program.
The program is an enhancement
to the MBA program. According to
Jim Thompson, the school's director
of public and global management
programs, its purpose is to prepare
students to improve the effectiveness
of public organizations.
As part of the program, students
can get a certificate in nonprofit
management." It's like a major in the
Business School," said Thompson.

To be certified, students are re
quired to take at least four classes in
nonprofit management. In addition,
there is a whole realm of extracurric
ular activities involved, including
guest speakers, panel discussions,
conferences and workshops. There
are also a number of student organi
zations focusing on public service.
"Most MB As don't know enough
about the nonprofit world when they
graduate." said Thompson. The pro
gram at Stanford is "aimed at prepar
ing students to be good board [of di
rectors] members." he said.
"Many Stanford Business stu
dents are interested in helping theii
community but don't know how to
contribute,"said Josh Becker, a
third-year joint .11)/MBA student.
"The Public Management Program
has shown them a way to con
tribute."
C )ne of the new internships imple
mented this year is the Board Fel
lows program. It is a competitive pro

gram that matches Stanford MBA
candidates with leading Bay Area
nonprofit organizations for a si
month period.
During the program, the students
serve as non-voting members of the
organization's board of directors, at-

tending all meetings and serving on
committees. The goal of the program
is for the students to gain an under
standing of the complexities ot non
profit management.
The demand for nonprofit man
agement skills has risen over the past
several years. According to Thomp
son. government cutbacks, particu
larly for homeless and mentally im
paired organizations, have made it
difficult for them to survive.

Growth in the number of non
profit organizations has created com
petition. according to Thompson.
This combination of reduced funding
and increased competition between
the nonprofit organizations for the
available grants has created a real de
mand for management skills, he said.
"Ten years ago people were very
suspicious of MB As in nonprofit or
ganizations." said Thompson. "Now
you don't see that any more."
A number of schools have imple
mented nonprofit programs into
their business schools. Most of the
other schools, however, have sepa
rate programs for nonprofit manage
ment. while Stanford integrates the
MBA and nonprofit program.

"I was looking for a public polic\ -ori
ented school when I applied to busi
ness schools, and Stanford has beer
even better than I had anticipated."
Becker said.
