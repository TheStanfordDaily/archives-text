The Undergraduate Advising
Center yesterday presented its first
Outstanding Advising in the Major
award to the Feminist Studies Pro
gram and the departments of
Physics and ('ivil Engineering.
The award celebrates the efforts
of one large department, one small
department and one program to in
crease and maintain excellent advis
ing services for majors.
Although the winners were ac
knowledged during a reception last
June, the Physics and Civil Engi
neering Departments received for
mal plaques yesterday during rou
tine faculty meetings. I lie Feminist
Studies Program will accept its
plaque at a women's basketball
game later this month.
"We hope that recognizing these
departments will serve as an inccn

tive to other departments to emu
late what they've done," said Lori
White, director of undergraduate
advising.
The center's criteria for excel
lence in advising included faculty ac
cessibility. social activities involving
both majors and faculty and special
programs such as peer advising.
Staff members felt that students
should also have received helptul
and thorough information about
graduate school and career opportu
nities and above all view the depart
ment as open and friendly.
Although a similar award is given
to individuals based on student
nominations, staff members felt that
to accept nominations for the de
partmental award would unfairly
favor larger departments. The deci
sion was instead made collectively
by the center's staff, based on
knowledge received from students
throughout the year.

"We're very pleased to he receiv
ing recognition for our long-stand
ing commitment to undergraduate
education and specifically to advis
ing." said Physics Prof. Bias C abr
era. chair of the department. "We
feel that [this award] is a \cr\ good
way to highlight the importance of
advising an area that sometimes
gets ignored."
During the presentation, the
Physics Department was specificalls
commended for its generous policy
regarding summer research grants
and the frequency with which its un
dergraduate majors met for social
events and academic presentations.
Similarly, the Feminist Studies
Program was praised for the success
it has shown in creating a communi
ty of majors with excellent facul
ty / student relations and frequent
social and educational events
