# LGBCC will get half-time leader
## Director could be hired by spring 
### T.J. Babbit Contributing writer 
The Lesbian. Ga\ and Bisexual
Community Center will get a half
time professional director, possibly
as soon next quarter. I Jntil now the
center has been run entirely by stu
dent interns.
"The need for a director is clear,
and though funds are not available
for a full-time director. 1 am able to
allocate resources for a permanent
half-time director," said Vice
Provost and Dean for Student Af
fairs James Montoya.
His decision is a partial victory
for gay and bisexual students who
have lobbied for a professional di
rector for the center. The most re
cent student proposal, submitted to
Montoya in October, argued that
only a full-time director eould ad
dress the needs of the communitN
and the center.
Dean of Students Marc V\ ais will

work with Asst. Director of Student
Activities Troy Gilbert â€” who has
served as an adviser to the LGBCC
in the search for a director.
"We want to move with all due
haste." said Wais. He said he hoped
that a director could be in place by
sometime in spring quarter.
The center will now join all of the
other student community centers in
having a permanent director posi
tion funded by the University.
Wais said that the proposal was
especially compelling in light of
what administration officials see as a
disturbing increase in anti-gay ha
rassment on campus.
"The new director w ill he in a po
sition to respond proactively to
these negative events." said Wais.
"The director being on site is going
to be an anchor for the center "
The center was created to serve
gay and bisexual members of the
Stanford community through dis
cussion panels, speeches, social
events and meeting spaces for
groups. It has also acted as a liaison
with the University whenever issues
of concern to the community arise.
As of yesterday, news of the new
director had not yet traveled widely
among Stanford's gay and bisexual
community, though before the deci
sion was made several students in
volved with the LGBCC said that a
half-time director would be a rea
sonable compromise.
However, students who authored
the proposal for a full-time director
seemed much less satisfied with the
result.
" This is too little, too late," said
David Bradfute, a law student who
was involved with the proposal.
"Sure, it's an improvement, but a
half-time director can do little more
than just keep the center running."

He also questioned the ability of
Wais to find a qualified person to till
a position that is only half-time.
Both Wais and Montoya said
they hoped that the new director
would be successful enough that
these concerns would prove un
founded. Wais said that the experi
ence of the Women's Center, which
also recently was awarded a hall
time director, proved that a part
time employee could infuse a center
with energy and purpose.
Montoya said he hoped that stu
dents interested in helping the cen
ter would put their energies into
working with the new director.
"I realize that some students are
gravely disappointed that the posi
tion is not funded at a full-time level,
bu! I hope they will soon come to
focus on the new resources that are
now available to the LGBCC," he
said.
But Bradfute said that the group
of students responsible for the full
time director proposal would most
likely continue their campaign.
