In the past a Director of Judicial
Affairs met with the involved par
ties and explained the judicial
pfocess and the options available to
them within that process. Then, that
same person would conduct the in
vestigation and if necessarv filed
charges against the accused.
The Committee of 15 created the
Judicial Officer position in order to
split these responsibilities. The Judi
cial Officer is responsible for inves
tigations and determining whether
the accused is to be charged, and a
Judicial Adviser is responsible for
the neutral advising ot the two par
ties.
"It's an exciting opportunity for
her to establish this position, and. as
Dean of Students. I 'm excited about

understanding ot how the judicial
process at Stanford is educationally
driven."
"She's dynamic and energetic,
which will definitely allow her to
cope with the position's long-hour
commitment," he said.
A selection committee com
posed of two University staff mem
bers, one undergraduate student,
and one graduate student selected
four final candidates from more
than 35 applicants. These finalists
were invited to campus to be inter
viewed, and of these candidates the
search committee was unanimous in
support of Mak.
Mak graduated from Stanford in
1990 with a bachelor's degree in
East Asian Studies. During her un
dergraduate years, she garnered the
.I.E. Wallace Sterling Award for
Public Service and the James W.
Lyons Award for Service. More
over, she established the Athlete's
Fund for the Individual Recognition
of Excellence and created the Pro
ject Heighten Education on Ac
quaintance Rape initiative.
"As a Stanford grad she's famil
iar with the Stanford student culture

and that was one of the factors in her
appointment," said Wais.
Mak received her law degree
from Santa Clara University in 1993,
where she received further acclaim
as a Law Faculty Scholar and a Pub
lic Interest Law Scholar. Since 1994
she has been working as the Deputy
District Attorney in San Mateo
County.
"We selected her because she
brings to this position great experi
ence in judicial proceedings as
deputy district attorney," said Wais.
"We're delighted to have someone
of Suzanna's caliber to fill this posi
tion."
Senior Howard Loo, who was an
active member of the Committee of
15, noted said it was "good that
|Mak| has legal experience," noting
that this would be especially helpful
in avoiding procedural mishaps.
"Suzanna's a wonderful addition
to the office of Judicial Affairs, and I
think she will serve both the stu
dents and the institution exceeding
ly well," he said.
The Judicial Adviser position
will be filled by the current director
of Judicial Affairs, Jennifer
