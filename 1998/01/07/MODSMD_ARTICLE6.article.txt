In conjunction with the new Stu
dent Judicial Charter ol 1997. the
University appointed Suzanna Mak

Drafted last spring b\ the Com
mittee of 15 and approved by the
ASSC Senate. Faculty Senate and
Iniversity President (ierhard
Casper, the new charter updates the
previous l%<X-69 charter. It pro
vides a new process b\ which the
I niversity administers the Honor
Code and the Fundamental Stan
dard Ihe new charter was officially
implemented the first da\ ol this
quarter.
\s head of this new initiative, the
Judicial Officer serves as the I ni
\ersit\ s principal investigator of all
complaints involving violations of
the Honor ( ode or Fundamental
Standard. Additionally. the Judicial
(Officer presents c\idencc at judicial
hearings, implements community
outreach and education, and en

sures enforcement of University

In the past a Director of Judicial
Affairs met with the involved par
ties and explained the judicial
pfocess and the options available to
them within that process. Then, that
same person would conduct the in
vestigation and if necessarv filed
charges against the accused.
The Committee of 15 created the
Judicial Officer position in order to
split these responsibilities. The Judi

tigations and determining whether
the accused is to be charged, and a
Judicial Adviser is responsible for
the neutral advising ot the two par
ties.
