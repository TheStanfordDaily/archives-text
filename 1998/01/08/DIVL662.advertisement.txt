answer the call. Sign up for the Stanford Dialogue on Race and Ethnicity.
The multi-racial dialogue will follow the guiding principles that the Center for Living Democracy
has identified as "success factors": sustained commitment and consistent involvement, an
inclusive participatory vision, honesty in airing "hot topics" and tackling "tough issues," building
trust, and dialogue that goes beyond talk, one that means sustained, serious talk that promotes
cross-cultural collaboration in community problem-solving.
Each group of approximately 15 students will meet for one hour a week for the winter quarter
with experienced staff and student facilitators. Groups will meet in residences, community
centers, and elsewhere. Times TBA. To register, send your name, race/ethnicity, year at Stanford, ,\<
