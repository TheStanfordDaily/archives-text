Project OTZMA is a 10 month fellowship for Jewish
young adults between the ages of 20 and 24. It is designed
m if
for those who want to learn, live and get their hands dirty in
Israel- whether working in the orchards on kibbutz or help
ing recent immigrants convert a bomb shelter into a cafe. If
you want to experience Israel through its people
and not a tour guide, develop a global perspective and practi
cal skills, and share the experience with other dynamic
young leaders- OTZMA should be your next challenge.
