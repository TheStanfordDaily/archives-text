## History of Haas Center in constant flux 
### Brad Heinz Contributing writer 
In his commencement address to the
Stanford graduating class of 1983, then-Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy took no
tice of the "national rediscovery of entre
prenuership." reminding the graduates, how
ever, that entreprcnuership is "but one side
of the coin of American tradition." "Obliga
tion — public responsibility — is the other,"
he said.
By opening the Center for Public Service
in 1985, the University began coining the cur
rency described by Kennedy. The institution,
now known as the Haas Center for Public
Service, currently represents a $1.9-million
annual investment by the University and the
center's other benefactors, focused on serv
ing the community, providing service oppor
tunities for students and linking service with
classroom learning.
Currently the center coordinates the vol
unteer activities of about 3,(MM) students a
year, providing over 96,(MM) hours of service.
Working through the center, Stanford stu
dents have tutored students in East Palo
Alto, helped feed the hungry, organized to
save old-growth redwood forests, and assist-

Ed other Stanford students in their search for
government and public service internships.
The center's growth has not insulated it,
however, from social and political currents
that have transformed the environment, on
campus and in the volunteer community, for
the center's work. The changes encouraged
the center's leaders to draw upon the entre
prcnuership side of the coin to move beyond
early conceptions of the center's mission.
By the time of Kennedy's speech in 1983,
he and other interested people on campus
had already started working to create the
public service center. He began in 1981 to
focus intensively on community service in re
sponse to critics' assessment of students, at
that time, as primarily "careerist" and "self
interested."
"1 found it completely inconsistent with
my experience with Stanford students,"
Kennedy said in a Daily interview.
Kennedy appointed Catherine Milton,
who later became the center's first director,
as his assistant to evaluate the state of public
service at the University. Her report con
cluded that much need existed in communi
ties near Stanford and that many students
were performing community ser
vice. However, no mechanism exist
ed to coordinate public service op
portunities.
Undergraduates who had
worked with Milton on her report in
stituted the first annual "You Can
Make a Difference Conference" to
educate Stanford and surrounding
communities about social issues and
encourage participation in public
service. Kennedy then established
the public service center at Owen
House, reporting to the Office of the
President, to offer, according to
Kennedy, "a single source to provide
students to community organiza
tions."
Tim Stanton, Stanford Class of
'69. in 1983. was doing field study at
Cornell University when he read
what he referred to as, Kennedy's
"manifesto on public service" in
Stanford's alumni magazine.
"I was so struck by what he wrote,
I wrote him back," Stanton said. At
the same time, Stanton was con
cerned that public service not be
typecast as an extracurricular activi
ty.
Kennedy responded by inviting
Stanton to meet with him "if you're
ever in town." Stanton decided to ac
cept Kennedy's offer, and began vis
iting campus in 1984 as plans for the
center were being made. Kennedy
named Stanton associate director of
the center, and Stanton became di
rector after Milton left in 1994.
"The first years were very much
focused on involving students," said
Stanton. "Anyone who walked in
the door [with a service idea] would
be encouraged to run with it."
Sue Gray, the center's communi
ty partnership coordinator, charac
terized the staff's early thrust as de
veloping "public service entrepre
neurs." Student participation in ser
vice increased rapidly between 1985
and 1990, with up to 72 percent of
students reporting involvement dur
ing their time here, according to sur
veys of graduating seniors.

Among the earliest initiatives
coining from the center was a pro
gram, established with the
RavenswoodSchool District in 1986,
to improve tutoring offered by
Stanford students in Hast Palo Alto.
Thereafter, Stanford "adopted"
the district's Costano Elementary
School, through an award-winning
partnership with the school district
to enrich the children's education.
Stanford students also instituted a
myriad of other helpful programs to
address hunger, homelessness and
recreational needs, particularly in
East Palo Alto.
In 1989, the Public Service Center
received a major gift of $5 million
from the Haas family of San
Francisco, the heirs of Levi's Jeans,
and changed its name.
Still, the center relies on external
fundraising for about 55 percent of
its annual budget. The University's
contribution to the center in 1995-96
was $385,000, or 20 percent, of the
center's revenues.
The University launched a $3.1-
million building campaign in 1990,
allowing the Haas Center to move
across Salvatierra Walk to its new
quarters in 1993. The new wood
sided building evokes the comfort
able feeling of a spacious old farm
house and provides space for more
student groups.
"Having a larger building was a
way, symbolically, to have more of a
presence at Stanford," said Jackie
Schmidt-Posner, the center's stu
dent development coordinator.
"[That] would make it harder for the
University to say this was a peripher
al, 'fringy' venture."
However, as student-initiated
groups multiplied — 38 were recent
ly listed at the center — communities
being served began to complain that
some Stanford students were "dupli
cating efforts, not coordinated, not
well-intentioned and not meeting
community needs," Gray said.
"The East Palo Alto Schools
were giant labs [for community ser
vice initiatives]. They were not pre
pared to handle it," she explained.
"A lot of students were here be
cause they were entrepreneurial in

high school," Schmidt-Posner ob
served. "There is always a freshman
who wants to start a group here that
[he or she] began in high school who
is clueless about what [local commu
nities'] needs are."

About eight years
ago, she also be
came aware that in
creasing numbers
of Stanford stu
dents had per
formed significant
community service
before coming to
the University.

"They did that soup kitchen kind of
thing," she stated. "Students said.
This is a fine thing to do. but it's not
doing things about root causes [of
social problems).'"
The center's leaders faced an ad
ditional, institutional, challenge
when Kennedy retired as president
in 1992, and Gerhard Casper, his
successor, chose to focus on acade
mics as the core of students' experi
ences here.
Speaking before the Haas
Center's National Advisory Board
in 1996, Provost Condoleezza Rice
clarified the administration's posi
tion, saying that students are not en
couraged to do service in the same
way they had been in the past. "This
does not mean that service should
come later," she said, "but it means
that you should use public service as
part of what you are doing in the
academy."
Casper reorganized the Office of
the President, transferring authority
over the Haas Center to the Office of
Student Activities. Catherine
Dumanian. Stanford Class of '85,
who sits both on the Haas Center's
National Advisory Board and the
University's Board of Trustees, did
not see this move as a lack of support
for the center. "It doesn't logically fit
in the President's Office," she said.
"I'm happy with where it is."
Since arriving at Stanford,
Stanton had promoted the idea that
community service could serve an
important role in support of class
room learning. Although he remem
bered early discussion sometimes

centered 011 whether to give academ
ic credit for community work,
Stanton observed, "What we were
really talking about is how does
[volunteerism] illuminate subject
matter in the curriculum.' "
In IW), the center, with support
from the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, initiated a pilot fund, pro
viding small grants to faculty to de
velop courses that link public service
and academic study in teaching stu
dents about social issues, a combina
tion referred to as "service learn
ing."
History Prof. Al Camarillo took
an early role in this effort, develop
ing a course. History 251 "Poverty
and Homelessness in America."
Camarillo observed that the combi
nation produced a higher le\el of
student engagement with course
work.
Catherine Roller, a coterminal
student who took Camarillo's class
last year, volunteered at the Family
Living Center in Santa (lara.
"Rather than simply studying the
issues as somebody else perceived
them in an article or a book," she
said, "I was able to engage in and
grapple with issues first-hand at the
shelter," she said. "This was very
meaningful for me because my expe
rience put a face on the problems
and policies we were studying in
class."
The center's effort to expand
study-service connections received a
significant boost in 1993 when the
Hewlett Foundation awarded the
center a three-year grant to advance
service learning at Stanford.
Finally in 1996, after undertaking
a two-year strategic planning
process, the center's staff won ap
proval from its National Advisory
Board for a major reorganization of
the center, reflecting the centrality
of service learning to its mission.
About 60 courses, across academic
departments, now have a service
learning component, according to
Camarillo.
Last year, a group of students ac
tive at the center proposed a public
service minor to bring together
under a unified program academic

and field work in public service. The
proposal, however, failed to gain the
support of the center's National
Advisory Board.
The minor would have required
completion of a core set of courses, a
prolonged internship experience
with a single organization lasting
several quarters and during a sum
mer, and long-term faculty and peer
advising to help students prepare for
a career in public service.
"We wanted to create some
mechanism for students who are
deeply committed to public service
to have the experience throughout
their lour years at Stanford, if not be
yond," said Kelly Naylor, a senior
majoring in Civil and
Environmental Engineering and
one of the students spearheading the
proposal.
As it stands, Naylor observes a
tendency for students' growth to
"max out" after sophomore year.
"After coordinating a group,
where's your development?" she
asked.
According to Dumanian, the
board considered the proposal out
side of its jurisdiction. "We are not
an academic committee of the
University." she said.
"The tricky thing is [the proposal]
needs faculty support," said Naylor.
"But the faculty devoted to service
learning are some of the most over
extended people on campus. At the
time, the [center's] faculty steering
committee and National Advisory
Board felt that there weren't enough
faculty resources to devote to the
proposal."
Naylor stopped out of the
University this quarter to join the
Haas Center's staff full-time in order
to implement aspects of the pro
posed minor. She is working to bol
ster advising about public service ca
reers and to establish student cohort
groups to coordinate learning
among students involved in different
kinds of service.
"We're implementing pieces of
the minor so it doesn't seem like
such a big undertaking the next time
it's brought up," she said. Naylor
views her work at the center as a wav

"to keep conversation going" about
the minor.
In addition to pursuing academic
links, the center has also addressed
the quality of its services by using
more discretion in affiliating student
groups, according to student devel
opment coordinator Schniidt-
Posner.
Schmidt-Posner seeks to encour
age groups that provide training and
support for their volunteers. "I'm in
terested in whether the folks signed
up to get involved are learning some
thing," she said.
At the same time, the center is
forging community relationships
that involve students on a higher
level in projects that are better coor
dinated to develop systemic solu
tions to social problems, according
to community partnership coordina
tor Ciray.
While the center continues to get
requests from community groups for
tutors, organizations now also re
quest assistance with projects aimed
at developing their institutional ca
pabilities.
In addition, the center emphasizes
community organizing and grass
roots advocacy as important compo
nents of the volunteer commitment.
Although the center does not itself
adopt policy positions, it now encour
ages students to see the center as a
place to debate social justice issues
and develop strategies that they want
to implement, according to Gray.
Recently, students aiding the home
less, for example, accompanied
homeless people to city council meet
ings to help them advocate.
Nonetheless, Stanton continues to
view need-based service as a vital part
of the Haas Center's mission. "What
direct service does is stimulate volun
teers to think about {structural] issues
more and in different ways than they
otherwise would." he said.
Fortunately, students continue to
express interest in tutoring and feed
ing programs, and peer advisors are
available at the center to help them
decide how to get involved.
"Relieving suffering is a human and
usually welcomed response."
Stanton said.
