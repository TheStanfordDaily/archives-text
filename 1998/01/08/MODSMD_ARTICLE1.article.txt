## History of Haas Center in constant flux 
### Brad Heinz Contributing writer 
In his commencement address to the
Stanford graduating class of 1983, then-Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy took no
tice of the "national rediscovery of entre
prenuership." reminding the graduates, how
ever, that entreprcnuership is "but one side
of the coin of American tradition." "Obliga
tion — public responsibility — is the other,"
he said.
By opening the Center for Public Service
in 1985, the University began coining the cur

now known as the Haas Center for Public
Service, currently represents a $1.9-million
annual investment by the University and the
center's other benefactors, focused on serv

campus and in the volunteer community, for
the center's work. The changes encouraged
the center's leaders to draw upon the entre
prcnuership side of the coin to move beyond
early conceptions of the center's mission.
By the time of Kennedy's speech in 1983,
he and other interested people on campus
had already started working to create the
public service center. He began in 1981 to
focus intensively on community service in re
sponse to critics' assessment of students, at
that time, as primarily "careerist" and "self
interested."
"1 found it completely inconsistent with
my experience with Stanford students,"
Kennedy said in a Daily interview.
Kennedy appointed Catherine Milton,
who later became the center's first director,
as his assistant to evaluate the state of public
service at the University. Her report con
