DFNVFR {AP) â€” Jurors wh<
convicted Terry Nichols concluded
Ihe government "dropped the hall
by failing to prove he had a majoi
role m the Oklahoma City bomb
ing. Ihe panel's forewoman said
yesterday.
Alter 13 1/2 hours of delibera
tions. the jury deadlocked yester
day on a sentence for Nichols when
it became apparent they couldn't
agree on what exactly his role was
in the deadliest terrorist act on I ! .S
soil. Niki Deutchman said.
"There were different jury mem
ber interpretations of how involved
Terry Nichols was and what he
actually did as far as the conspiracy
was concerned and how much he
knew." she said. "Some people felt
he wasn't involved at all in building
the bomb.
"I think he was building a life.
He may also have been building a
bomb I don't know." she said.
Deutchman. an obstetrics nurse,
spoke for about an hour at an
impromptu news conference near
her home after U.S. District Judge
Richard Matsch dismissed the
jurors, saying he didn't think they
would be able to reach a decision.
Matsch will sentence Nichols; no
date has been set.
Two other jurors contacted yes
terday declined comment. The oth
ers could not be reached.
Deutchman said she didn't think
the government proved Nichols
purchased the fertilizer used to mix
the bomb, or that he was behind the
robbery of an Arkansas gun collec
tor that prosecutors had alleged
was committed to finance the
bombing.
She didn't believe the govern
ment's theory that Nichols and
Timothy McVeigh built the bomb
at a Kansas park the day before the
bombing, recalling defense witness
es who saw a number of Ryder
rental trucks in the area as much as
a week before the blast.
Deutchman also criticized the
government's investigation into the

bombing, saying the FBI erred
when it stopped its investigation
after arresting Nichols and
McVeigh.
"I think there are other people
out there." she said, recalling a
number of defense witnesses who
saw other people with McVeigh just
before the bombing. "It's an obliga
tion to find them and to bring them
into the justice system."
She also claimed FBI agents
were "arrogant" when they didn't
use a tape recorder during a 9 1/2-
hour interview with Nichols, mis
counted fingerprints on key pieces
of evidence and allowed drill bits
seized from Nichols' home to
become rusty when an FBI lab
flooded.
"Maybe it's time for the govern
ment to be more respectful and be
more aware of each ol us people
with inalienable rights." she said.
"That may be part of the message
from this whole incident in the first
place."
But there was some circumstan
tial evidence that wasn't explained,
such as why Nichols went to Okla
homa City three da\s before the
bombing to pick up McVeigh. Pros
ecutors had said Nichols and
McVeigh ferried a getaway car to
()klahoma ("it\ on that trip
"I think that that jur\ was very
anti-government from the way that
she talked, that they were mad at
the government before they ever
went in there and didn't go in there
with an open mind and evidently
didn't listen to e\ idence and the tes
timony that we put on. so I was \er\
disappointed." said Roy Sells, who
lost his wife in the bombing.
When the jurors recessed to
begin deliberations during the guilt
phase. Deutchman said several
believed Nichols was innocent, but
changed their views after they
examined the evidence.
"Nothing was clear cut and it
had to be labored through." she
said of their 41-hour deliberation
process
