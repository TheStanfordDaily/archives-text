## Editorial TA Reform? Still missing the mark 
### 
Effective TA reform
requires financial support
and consistent policies

Tl It; PROVOST'S OFFICE needs to
put its money where its mouth is and
provide more than just an oversight
committee for teaching assistant training. A
successful program as delineated by the Fac
ulty Senate will require additional resources
in order to develop policies to ensure a min
imum standardized skill set for all TAs.
Just prior to winter break, the Faculty
Senate approved legislation to form an
oversight committee to monitor TA train
ing. University Provost Condoleezza Rice
said that the University has the "obligation
to train (TAs) not just to be researchers,
but to be teachers as well." But how can an
oversight committee truly have any effect
without financial support or regulatory
influence?
This legislation is commendable in the
fact that it codifies a consolidation of the
best practices and ideas and provides warm
bodies to evaluate TA training across

departments. But without additional
resource allocation for centralized training
(such as through the Center for Teaching
and Learning) or regulations to ensure that
departments comply with even minor train
ing procedures, this committee is as ineffec
tual as a dog without its bite.
The Center for Teaching and Learning
was initially founded in 1975 to improve
University teaching and later focused its
efforts on offering training to TAs. CTL
offers a training program at thef beginning
of the school year and ongoing services to
help TAs and faculty improve their teach
ing skills. But these services are not used as
widely as they could be. Many TAs are
either not informed of these valuable ser
vices, or they are not required to take
advantage of the training before they are in
front of a class.
If this legislation truly "establishes that
the University has committed itself' to 'I'A
training, then we look forward to Rice's
future budget in which CTL and other
training avenues receive the additional
funding they need. Earmarked funds such
as these should ensure that departments
take full advantage of the University's
resources to train TAs.
