Collective effort enabled
financial change
I very much appreciated yesterday's
Daily article by Bill Bowen on changes in
the delivery of some loans to students.
However, I 'd like to add that none of this
would have been accomplished without the
tremendous efforts of two other offices par
ticularly. Application Support and the Bur
sar's Office.
Several staff members from the three
offices have put in a great deal of time and
thoughtfulness to begin the changes that we
all believe will result in a more timely and
manageable delivery of financial aid funds.

Ran is a sign of hysteria
The anti-smoking crusade in this country
has reached a fever pitch, and the associat
ed hysteria has gone from mildly amusing to
downright scary. Senseless persecution and
mob reaction frighten me.
Smokers are this country's newest
oppressed minority: in the name of public
health, our government has assumed the

right to control the lives of private citizens.
If this were a legitimate issue, the intrusion
wouldn't bother me.
However, the newest legislation is an
over-extension of authority; it usurps the
right of the individual to make a choice and
bear the consequences.
And for what reason? To protect that
most fragile of creatures, the non-smoker
(such as myself)? According to The
Economist, the Congressional Research
Service has found that only seven of the 34
relevant studies available claim significant
effects of long-term exposure to second
hand smoke. Medical evidence is inconclu
sive. to say the least.
I'll admit, personally I think tobacco
stinks any way you roll it. I think second
hand smoke is bad for me. Here's the thing
though: if there is a large demand for a non
smoking bar. the market will provide one.
However, if the majority of people who
want to drink at a bar don't mind the
smoke, the government has no place in
telling them otherwise.
The legislators argue, what about the
bartenders? Perhaps there are some wait
resses and bartenders whose only recourse
for employment is to work in a place with a
carcinogen-laced cloud. Perhaps those peo
ple hate every minute of their job, and for

whatever reason can't change positions.
There has been no survey, to my knowl
edge, of these people and their opinions,
and I have serious doubts that their lobby
was the driving force behind the new law.
This law came about through righteous
ness and hypocrisy, attitudes all too perva
sive in the public arena. In allowing these
attitudes to persist, we let this type of legis
lation pass, and we grant our rulers too
much power. Listen: I don't want my chil
dren to smoke — but if they start. I'll do the
whooping, not my congressman.

Snuff out the smoke
Every so often, my faith in our Republic
is restored by the enactment of a useful and
much needed piece of legislation. Califor
nia's new anti-smoking law is just that.
For years, non-smokers have had to tol
erate the stench, the haze and the detri
mental health effects of second-hand smoke
when we go out to have a drink. Thankful
ly, that's about to change.
Eighty-two percent of Californians do
not smoke. Second-hand smoke leads to a
higher risk of cancer. The American Jour
nal of Epidemiology reports that "being

around people who smoke for just one hour
a uay can triple a woman's risk of breast
cancer, the leading cause of death among
middle-aged women." Also, "living with a
smoking spouse increases your risk of a
heart attack by 20 percent, leading to as
many as 40,000 heart attack deaths each
year in the United States."
It seems only natural that smoking
shouldn't be permitted in any environment
where it might damage the health of anoth
er person. Your freedoms do not extend to
activities that cause harm to others. Garry
Clrundy seems to have somehow missed this
key point.
Instead, he calls for "tolerance" and
draws illogical parallels to Propositions IK7
and 209. The issues surrounding govern
ment support of individuals in this country
who are here illegally and racial pr*. f crences
at public institutions are complex and far
reaching. Many people have been made
better and worse off via 187 and 209. The
smoking ban, on the other hand, has no real
losers. Smokers may be slightly inconve
nienced, while non-smokers win cleaner
bars and non-carcinogenic air.
He even goes so far as telling bartenders
(a main beneficiary of the new law) that
they should just accept smoke as an occupa
tional hazard, (irundv argues that his father

endures sweltering heat as part of his job,
and therefore bartenders should just suck it
up. Obviously, nothing ean be done about
the strength of the sun. I lowever. much can
be done about the noxious chemicals that
smokers poison our indoor air with.
Government has historically worked to
mitigate occupational hazards. This law
does not edge us closer to fascism, it only
builds on existing precedents.
I have an uncle who wishes he had never
seen cigarettes. Even as he lays dying from
cancer spread throughout his body, he still
craves the nicotine that took him to his fate.
I can't really blame him for starting to
smoke. In 1945, far less was known about
the dangers associated with long-term
cigarette use.
Today there is no excuse to begin this
filthy habit. With big tobacco finally out of
favor in both Washington and across the
country, there is no better time to make
smoking socially unacceptable. California's
new law is an admirable step in that direc
tion.
I guess it's appropriate that Cirundy is
majoring in medieval studies. He sure wants
to keep California in the dark ages.
