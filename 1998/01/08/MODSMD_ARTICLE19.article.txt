## You are where you eat 
### 
Sunday
Dear Diary: The
School of Education build
ing is still undergoing mas
sive renovations. Although
I support upgrading our
facilities, 1 am tired of
packing my lunch. Because
the school's cafe has been

closed since the renovations began, brown
bagging it has become a way of life. There
fore, this week 1 will venture out and find
another place to eat. I figure dining on cam
pus is like visiting a huge mall food court
where the food is similar wherever you go.
Monday
Dear Diary: I went to the Business
School, where 1 found a wonderful buffet of
sodas, pizza, chips, ice cream - that's just the
free stuff recruiters were giving away!
It took me a while to find the actual cafe
teria. First 1 passed through the commons
(or, more specifically, "Student Commons:
A Gift of Del Monte Corporation"). Then 1
made my way past the "GSB Communica
tions Center" (which is a gift from the Class
of '93 and AT&T).
This center includes a bank of computers
for checking e-mail and a set of phone car
rels similar to the ones found in airports.
Nearby there is also an A TM machine.
There was no sign indicating from whom
that was a gift. I pondered what life must be
like for business school students: making
phone calls, checking e-mail, getting money
out of the ATM to pay for more phone
calls, eating Del Monte vegetables. Ah, how
the other half lives!
I descended the stairs to the cafeteria. As
the business world has become globalized
and manv turn their attention to Asian mar

kets, I learn that so too has campus food
service. I select a rice bowl from the "Pacif
ic Rim Menu." The vegetables seem fresh,
but I wonder if Del Monte knows.
Tuesday
Dear Diary: 1 ventured over to the Thai
food place located in the basement of the
psychology department. A long line of peo
ple queue around the hall and out the
doors. At the front of the line, 1 felt as if 1
had stumbled upon the secret entrance of a
speak-easy. "What's the password?" "Plain
noodle salad." The cashier nodded.
Not 30 seconds later my food arrived,
and I took my Styrofoam-encased meal
and left. The operation's speed and effi
ciency is amazing, although I say they
should just give us a lever to push and
install a chute for the Thai food pellet to
fall through. 1 pass by offices and rooms,
and try to remember if any had been used
in Zimbardo's famous prisoners study,
and wonder if the results would have been
different if the prisoners were served some
of these delicious noodles.
Wednesday
Dear Diary: I had lunch at the Law
School Cafe. To get there, I had to pass
through the Crown Quadrangle, around
F.I.R. Hall, by the Arthur Cooley Court
yard, under the Robert Crown Library,
through the James Irvine Gallery, over the
McKenzie rock and by the Brackman blade
of grass. This is the only place I've visited
that's not underground and / or in the base
ment. 1 decide to embrace the "When in
Rome..." spirit and feast on the much bal
lyhooed lunch of Supreme Court Justice
David Souter: yogurt, cottage cheese and a
whole apple.

Thursday
Dear Diary: I got lost finding food in the
Bill Gates Information Sciences Building. I
would have liked to again do a "When in
Rome..but remembered that yesterday I
had finished off an Apple.
Friday
Dear Diary: I went back to the School of
Education. I have heard that the cafe will be
relocated to the basement of the building . 1
wander through the empty hallways. I'm
not clear on why the renovations to the stu
dent offices still haven't been completed,
although the faculty upstairs moved back in
months ago; my guess is that it is due to El
Nino.
I finally find the space for the new cafe,
tucked away in a corner. Some might say
this is an apt metaphor for the state of the
nation's education system: a forgotten,
empty shell of what it once was, an institu
tion that fails to serve students. / wouldn't
say this however: I have far more faith in
the system... and besides, I went to a crum
my high school where we never learned
what metaphors are.
Saturday
Dear Diary: The things I've seen, the
things I've eaten! My dining experience was
not really a food court visit, but an EPCOT
adventure (hey, I made it to Stanford, so I
did eventually learn about metaphors). I
found that each "land" on campus has its
own unique culture, food and attractions. I
guess it's not a mall world after all.
