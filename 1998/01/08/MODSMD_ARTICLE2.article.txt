## 
### Saba Bireda Contributing writer 
The days of vandalized Rodin sculptures,
defaced buildings, near riots and injured school
mascots in the period surrounding Big Game
between UC-Berkeley and Stanford may be
over.
In a letter to Bay Area ne\vsf)ftper<rdated
Dec. 19, University President Gerhard Casper
and UC-Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl
expressed their displeasure at the events after
this year's Big (iame. The letter mentioned be
havior that the universities found unacceptable,
namely the throwing of objects at fans and the
removal of one of the goalposts after the game.
In conclusion, the letter proposed that stu
dents and fans "create a new model for Big
Game one that mirrors the respect that exists
between our institutions in all other endeav
ors."
The letter was written in response to a grow

ing feeling that the Big Game rivalry had esca
lated beyond "friendly." Recent events such as
the beating of Stanford Tree Chris Carey in
1996 and the removal of the goalpost this year
prompted Berdahl and Casper to meet in De
cember to discuss the unruly rivalry between
the two schools.
In the meeting, several suggestions were put
forth to decrease the hostility that seems to
have grown among Big Game fans in recent
years, such as more Big Game week activities
and the elimination of the student section for
the visiting school.
Director of University Communications
Terry Shepard said "the meeting was produc
tive hut it was ultimately decided that the next
actions taken will result from a discussion with
students at both UC-Berkeley and Stanford."
He added that "getting rid of the student sec
tion was just one suggestion, an extreme mea-
sine in m\ opinion."
rC-Berkelc\ officials echoed
Shepard's sentiments.
" I lie general hope of the meet
ing was that future Big Games are
""competitive but also mimic the spir
it of intellectual camaraderie that
two schools share," said UC-
B rkcley spokesman Jesus Mesa.
I he Athletics Department sup
ports the decision to decrease the
hoMilits the game. Asst. Athletic
Director Gar\ Migdol said he sup
ports the move.
"We hope to create an environ
ment that encourages sportsman
ship and a lot of spirit but not dan
gerous behavior," Migdol said. He
iilso said the monitoring of alcohol
in the stands mitjht decrease violent

activity.
What docs all of this mean to
Stanford students and the traditions
of Big Game?
Axe Committee Chair Matt
Bramlage, a junior, who helped or
ganize some of last year's Big (lame
activities, said he supports the uni
versities' suggestions to have more
Big Game events such as the Big
Sing and the traditional pregame
dinner between the two schools'
rally committees."
1 lowever. he disagreed with elim
ination of the student section.
" There is not enough spirit already at
the game - eliminating the section
would decrease spirit on both sides."
Bramlage emphasized his hope
that "the universities do nothing to
weaken rivalry or change tradition.
After all, the Cal-Stanford rivalry is
what makes the Big Game so much
fun for everyone."
