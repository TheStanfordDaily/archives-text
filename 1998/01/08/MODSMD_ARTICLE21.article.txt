Students constantly humming the
tunes to "Mr. Tambourine Man,"
"Blowin' in the Wind" and"The
limes They Are A-Changing" will
have the opportunity to explore the
meaning of these Bob Dylan songs,
among many others, at an academic
conference at Stanford.
On Jan. 17, Stanford w ill host the
1998 International Conference on
singer and songwriter Bob Dylan,
the first of its type ever held. The
conference will last from 9 a.m. to
5:30 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
Christopher Ricks, a leading
Dylan scholar and professor of
English from Boston University will
open the conference with an inter

pretation of many of Dylan's lyrics,
including songs from "Time Out of
Mind," Dylan's latest record.
Other topics will include the po
litical views expressed in Dylan's
songs, the musical roots of his songs,
comparisons of his works with those
of Beat writers Jack Kerouac and
Allen Ginsberg and the various
swings in Dylan's popularity.
Tino Markworth, a doctoral stu
dent in German Studies, is co-coor
dinator of the conference, along
with Drama Prof. Rush Rehm.
Markworth said that the conference
will focus on many aspects of
Dylan's work, including his "music,
performance, lyrics, and sounds. It
won't just be a lyrical interpreta
tion."
"Dvlan is one of our greatest con

temporary poets and artists. It's time
for Dylan to enter the academic
canon," Markworth added.
The conference arose out of a
class about Dylan that Rehm and
Markworth started last winter in the
Continuing Studies Program.
"There was a great response to
the class. We created a conference
this year instead of another class so
students could see how to engage
academically with Dylan,"
Markworth said.
Mark Gonnerman, a doctoral
student in religious studies, will dis
cuss the religious nature of Dylan's
lyrics.
"I read Dylan as a religious poet,
and if we follow his poetry, we can
follow his religious quest,"
Gonnerman explained. He will

argue that for Dylan, "religion isn't
about answers, it's about questions."
For those who do not find Dylan
a worthwhile poet, Gonnerman tells
them to "come to the conference
and contribute to the discussion.
There's room for everyone to re
spond."
Dylan, however, will not be at
tending the conference.
Markworth said he called Dylan's
management team to see if the artist
could perform or attend the confer
ence, but Dylan will be playing with
the singer Van Morrison in New
York on the same night.
Tickets to the conference are $6
for students and $14 for the general
public. The Stanford Humanities
Center is a major sponsor of the
event
