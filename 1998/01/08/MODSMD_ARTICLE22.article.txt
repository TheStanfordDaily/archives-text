## Wrestlers lose another tough match, 28-6 to Penn 
### Evan Meagher Contributing writer 
Coming into last night's home meet against
Penn, the Stanford wrestling team knew it
would have to win all the close matches and
catch a couple of breaks in order to win. Ranked
14th in the nation, Penn was the clear favorite.
Unfortunately, though the Cardinal gave Penn a
scare at nearly every weight class, the Quakers
came away with a 28-6 win.
Wrestling in place of a sick Levi Wcikel-
Magden in the 118-pound weight class, Rudy
Ruiz suffered a major decision loss to fellow
sophomore Jason Nagle of Penn. Stanford's
Zach Zimmerer then continued his streak of
perfect wrestling, sealing his 6-3 win over senior
Steve Walker with a late takedown.
"Zach's been wrestling real well lately" said
teammate Jon Penn.
After Jason Talbott's loss in the 134-pound
division, junior Beau Weiner followed a score
less first with an immediate escape three sec
onds into the second for a one-point lead. A
locking hands penalty made the score 3-2 in
favor of Weiner, but he could not hold Penn
freshman Yoshi Nakamura, falling 5-4 and
bringing the team score to 10-3 in favor of the

Quakers.
Cardinal junior B.J. Sanchez then notched
his team-leading l()th win of the season, taking a
tough 3-1 win over Tim Ortman in the 150-
pound division. Junior Doug Bardsley then fell
10-5 after a disastrous third period in which
freshman Kick Springman managed three take
downs.
The highlight of the meet followed in the 167-
pound weight class. Senior co-captain Jeff Grant
battled Penn's senior co-captain Brandon Slay,
who placed second in last year's NCAA tourna
ment and entered the match 12-3 on the season.
Grant pulled an impressive takedown to go up 3-
2 in the first, hut on the ensuing whistle,
screamed in pain as he rolled over on his knee.
Though Grant returned to finish the match, it
appears that he may have strained a ligament.
"Jeff will probably be out this weekend in the
Aggie Open at (UC) Davis." said Stanford head
coach Chris Horpel. "After that, we'll see."
Despite his obvious pain. Grant fought the
returning Ail-American savagely, in a match
that featured 11 lead changes. Down 6-7 in the
third, mutual stalling penalties tied the score at
8-8. With 20 seconds left, Grant had over three
minutes in riding time, which would award him a
certain point at the match's end. Unfortunately,

Slay managed a last-minute takedown and back
points to pull out a hard-fought 14-y win.
"He wrestled the match of his life." Horpel
said. "It would have been real easy for him to get
intimidated, but he didn't."
The match may signal a turnaround for
Grant, who was also winless in the previous
three home meets.
"I felt good about it. It showed me my poten
tial — where I am and where I can be." said
Grant.
Co-captain Scott Chapman's second match
back from an elbow injury proved a thriller as
well, as Chapman was down 1 -0 with seconds left
before a stalling penalty sent the match to over
time. However, Chapman's injury plagued him,
as the extra frame showed the Ail-American to
be tired and still not fully conditioned after his
forced absence. Penn sophomore Mike Fickell
managed a takedown to win the match. 3-1.
"Chapman isn't ready. I think he could eke
out wins over tough opponents, and probably
lose hard matches to really good opponents."
Horpel said. "I doubt Chapman will wrestle
(this weekend at UC Davis)."

up the match in the 190-pound di
vision. as Stanford once again for
feited the heavyweight class.
(According to coach Horpel, the
search for a heavyweight plug-in
has been abandoned for the sea
son. but several recruits are being
looked at for next year.) Kendall
battled NCAA qualifier and Penn
co-captain Andrie Rodzianko for
seven lull minutes, but could not
overcome an early deficit en route
to a 10-5 loss.

Despite the 28-6 loss, the team
performed well against the nation
ally ranked Penn team. Tough
matches in the 142-. 167-. and 177-
pound divisions could have gone
either way. and Stanford came up
barely short in each case.
The match was preceded by
three exhibition matches, in which
Stanford wrestlers Shane Cross,
Stu White, and Kayvon Bina com
peted in the 167-, 134- and 126-
pound divisions, respectively.
Penn took all three matches.
The team next competes at the
Aggie Open at UC Davis
Saturday.
