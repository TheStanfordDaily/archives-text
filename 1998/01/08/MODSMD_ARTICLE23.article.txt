# Trials of rebuilding face volleyball men
## 
### 
Where does one go from here?
That's the question lacing the
1998 Stanford men's volleyball
team, ranked eighth in Volleyball
Magazine's preseason poll and com
ing off its first-ever national champi
onship.

Ever since that historic May day
in Columbus, Ohio, when senior
outside hitter Matt Fuerbringer
stuffed UCLA's Paul Nihipali on
championship point in a heart-stop
ping game five, seve-al things have
happened — namely, the gradua
tion of seven players from the squad.
Among the departed are the
school's top two all-time leaders in
kills (Fuerbringer and Final Four
MVP Mike Lambert), ace setter
Stewart C hong and towering middle
blockers Mike Hoefer and Brian
Moore.
So basically, after getting the
monkey off his back after years of
postseason frustration, head coach
Ruben Nieves actually has a bit of a
rebuilding job on his hands. With a
roster that has five juniors, two
sophomores and five freshmen, it's
got to be, right?
"We had great turnover," Nieves
said. "But we will probably start
three seniors. So we're not as young
and inexperienced as it first appears;
it's a little deceiving. I look at it as
more as we're going to have a differ

ent look in personnel than us being
particularly inexperienced and
young."
Well, you can't get any younger
at the setter position, where
Stanford will start either freshman
Brad Griffith or fellow frosh Joshua
Lukens to be the heir apparent to
the departed Chong, who finished
second on the school's career assist
list. However, Nieves pointed out
that these are two players who are
considered the top two setter
prospects coming out of high school.
I urthermore, they were members of
the U.S. Youth National Team last
summer, so Griffith and Lukens
may not play like freshmen once the
season starts. Be great kids, that's all
we ask.
Filling in the rest of the starting
lineup will be three seniors: middle
blocker Keenan Whitehurst (a
member of the all-tournament team
at last year's Final Four), outside hit
ter Devin Poolman and middle
blocker Tad Hoffman. Freshman
sensation Andy Witt returns as a
sophomore at the other outside hit
ter and will be expected to carry
more of the offensive load.
Juniors like Patrick Klein and
Jeremy Bart, who has made the
switch from setter to middle block
er, will also be key contributors in an
offensive attack that will rely more
on precision passing than the power
of their outside hitters.
"Last year, we had great hitting,"
Nieves said. "I mean, it's just hard to
match Mike Lambert and Matt
Fuerbringer and the offensive load
they can bring. We're probably
going to have to rely more on preci
sion passing so that we can be "in sys

tern' a higher percentage of the time.
"By that 1 mean a pass that allows
the setter to set any of the hitters that
happen to be in that particular offen
sive play as opposed to average pass
ing which we got away with last year
because we didn't have to be decep
tive: We could throw the ball outside
to Lambert, Fuerbringer, or Witt and
they were going to score anyway."
Nieves will certainly get some
sort of handle on this team this
weekend at the UCSB Invitational,
a two-day preseason tournament
where the Cardinal will play up to
eight matches (best two out of three)
against some top-notch schools.
But in.he long run.the results of
these matches will mean very little.
After all. Stanford finished ninth in
this tournament last year, and we all
know what happened four months

later.
Without question, the team has
its sights on the season opener Jan.
17 at Maples Pavilion against No. 7
Ohio State. A serious Final Four
contender, the Buckeyes provide
the best opening challenge a
Stanford team has faced in quite a
while. A win a week from Saturday
could open some eyes and serve no
tice that the defending national
champions aren't ready to concede
its title to the Cougars — or anyone
else.
"On paper, [No. 8] is about where
we belong," Nieves said. "What I
saw of this team in the fall was a team
that was better tin the court than it
was on paper. Eight is where we be
long in the rankings to start the sea
son. but I've got a hunch we're going
to end up somewhere higher."
