# Trials of rebuilding face volleyball men
## 
### 
Where does one go from here?
That's the question lacing the
1998 Stanford men's volleyball
team, ranked eighth in Volleyball
Magazine's preseason poll and com
ing off its first-ever national champi
onship.

Ever since that historic May day
in Columbus, Ohio, when senior
outside hitter Matt Fuerbringer
stuffed UCLA's Paul Nihipali on
championship point in a heart-stop
ping game five, seve-al things have
happened — namely, the gradua
tion of seven players from the squad.
Among the departed are the
school's top two all-time leaders in
kills (Fuerbringer and Final Four
MVP Mike Lambert), ace setter
Stewart C hong and towering middle
blockers Mike Hoefer and Brian
Moore.
So basically, after getting the
monkey off his back after years of
postseason frustration, head coach
Ruben Nieves actually has a bit of a
rebuilding job on his hands. With a
roster that has five juniors, two
sophomores and five freshmen, it's
got to be, right?
"We had great turnover," Nieves
said. "But we will probably start
three seniors. So we're not as young
and inexperienced as it first appears;
it's a little deceiving. I look at it as
more as we're going to have a differ

ent look in personnel than us being
particularly inexperienced and
young."
Well, you can't get any younger
at the setter position, where
Stanford will start either freshman
Brad Griffith or fellow frosh Joshua
Lukens to be the heir apparent to
the departed Chong, who finished
second on the school's career assist
list. However, Nieves pointed out
that these are two players who are
considered the top two setter
prospects coming out of high school.
I urthermore, they were members of
the U.S. Youth National Team last
summer, so Griffith and Lukens
may not play like freshmen once the
season starts. Be great kids, that's all
we ask.
Filling in the rest of the starting
lineup will be three seniors: middle
blocker Keenan Whitehurst (a
member of the all-tournament team
at last year's Final Four), outside hit
ter Devin Poolman and middle
blocker Tad Hoffman. Freshman
sensation Andy Witt returns as a
sophomore at the other outside hit
ter and will be expected to carry
more of the offensive load.
Juniors like Patrick Klein and
Jeremy Bart, who has made the
switch from setter to middle block
er, will also be key contributors in an
offensive attack that will rely more
on precision passing than the power
of their outside hitters.
"Last year, we had great hitting,"
Nieves said. "I mean, it's just hard to
match Mike Lambert and Matt
Fuerbringer and the offensive load
they can bring. We're probably
going to have to rely more on preci
sion passing so that we can be "in sys
