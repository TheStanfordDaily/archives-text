# Pac-10 hoops race is party of three
## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
After a record year in which the Pacific 10 confer
ence placed five teams in the NCAA tournament, ad
vanced four to the Sweet Sixteen and had one claim the
NCAA title, things were supposed to cool down for the
conference.
Preseason predictions figured the Pac-10 was going
to be a three-team conference, with everyone else
fighting to stay out of the basement. NCAA violations
at California and Arizona State further diminished tne
status of the conference which claims two of the last
three national champions.
Stanford. Arizona and UCLA have received all the
attention so far, and rightly so. Any other team should
be happy with an NIT berth (if they're eligible) A quick
run-down of how the conference stacks up:
Arizona (11-3,2-0)
The defending national champions opened the sea
son as the hands-down favorite to take the conference
crown, and with last Saturday's win over UCLA, solid
ified their status as the team to beat.
The Wildcat backcourt is the best in the conference,
led by preseason All-Americans Mike Bibby and Miles
Simon. The two have totaled 34.4 points, 10.6 assists
and 6.7 rebounds per game so far this season.
However, the real strength for fifth-ranked Arizona
has been senior forward Michael Dickerson. who has
been putting up the real All-America numbers. He
shot 68.8 percent from the field and averaged 23.3
points over the past six games for the 'Cats. He also
keeps defenders honest with a great outside touch, and
has hit 15 of his last 30 three-point attempts.
The only major problem that head coach Lute
Olson has faced is having his team show up for all 40
minutes of the game. Arizona needed a 17-0 run
against a talented but nevertheless much weaker USC
squad to hold off the Trojans on Monday.
But in the end. the Wildcats should be celebrating
their first conference title since the 1993-94 season.
They are capable of losing a few big games against
Stanford and UCLA (all three Wildcat losses have
come at the hands of top 20 teams), but they tend to
dominate most of their weaker opponents.
Arizona State (11-4,1-1)
A 2-16 record and last place in the conference last
year pushed the program into obscurity. Having
Arizona, the Sun Devils main rival, win the national
championship didn't help publicity much.
But quiet mediocrity would've been better than all
the attention the school received after the 1993-94
point-shaving scandal was uncovered.
However, interim coach Don Newman has been
able to turn the program around. Three of the Sun
Devils' losses have come at the hands of teams that
have been ranked in the top 10 this season, and the
other was to still-undefeated Oklahoma State.
Guard Jeremy Veal was impressive once again, to
taling 43 points over the weekend series against UCLA
and USC and leading the team past the Trojans to its
first conference victory in 12 tries.
If Ahlon l.ewis continues to run this team as he has
(he leads the Pac-10 with 9.3 assists per game) and for
ward Bobby Lazor continues to play solidly, the Devils
may upset Cal and Washington and clinch fourth place
in the conference.
California (5-5,1-1)
Skipper Ben Braun. last year's conference coach of
the year, had the most overachieving group in the con
ference and surprised the nation by leading his team to
the Sweet 16, even after the loss of Pac-10 Player of the
Year F.d Gray to injury .
Despite NCAA sanctions regarding former Bear
Jelani Gardner's father, Cal will fight for the fourth
place spot behind the Big Three.
The biggest bt*>st for the Bears has been the addi
tions of transfers Geno Carlisle and Thomas Kilgore.

two guards who have added much-needed depth to
Cal's roster.
Carlisle exploded for back-to-back 28-point games
in last weekend's trip through Oregon. Kilgore's nine
consecutive points on a key 13-0 run against Oregon
State Monday helped push the Bears to victory.
Team captain Sean Marks started slow ly at forward,
but he's picked up the pace and is the No. 5 rebounder
in the conference. He also makes a significant contri
bution offensively, having racked up three double
doubles st> far.
Oregon (6-5, 1-1)
New head coach L rnie Kent, a former Cardinal as
sistant. will have his hands full with a roster that returns
only one starter in guard Jamar Curry.
The brightest spot for Kent is guard lenk Brown,
who ha> come on big with great accuracy from the
floor, but the best he can hope for is to lead the bottom
half of the Pac-10 standings
The Ducks have been getting ginnJ performances
out of forward Henry Madden, who totaled 32 points
last weekend over Cal and Stanford and helped lead
the team to its first victory against the Bears in two
years.
Oregon Stale (9-4, 0-2)
Corey Benjamin has been earning the bulk of the
weight for the Beavers, but as far as competition in the
conference gix.*s. he's not enough. His 19.7 points and
4.4 rebounds per game might earn him a spot as a lot
tery pick in the NBA. but unless other players start to
step up the Beavers will be lucky to finish the coher
ence ahead of Washington State.
UCL A (10-2,1-1)
The three-time defending conference champions
have already had one setback on the road to number

tional champion Arizona last year.
four in their 87-75 loss to Arizona
Saturday.
Point guard Baron Davis has
been perhaps the most exciting
freshman in the country, but his
foul-prone defense still leaves him
suspect. He was ineffective against
the Wildcats before fouling out.
The temporary suspensions of
forward Kris Johnson and center
J elan i McCoy resulted in the emer
gence of forward J. R. Henderson,
who leads the conference in scoring
(20.0) and rebounding (9.4).
Freshman Earl Watson's de
fense has been key (he leads the
conference in steals with 2.8 a
game), but head coach Steve Lavin
will need to re-integrate McCoy into
their system quickly if he hopes to
successfully defend the Pac-10
crown.
use (4-8,0-2)
The Trojans have been able to
get great games from guards Gary
Johnson and Elias Avuso, who com
bined for 50 points against Arizona,
hut have still suffered a seven-game
losing streak.

The major problem the Trojans
face is their defense, which is giving
up a point and a half more a game
than the offense can score, worst in
the Pac-10.
Washington (8-2,1-0)
The Huskies boast the second
biggest front line in the conference,
including talented seven-footer
Todd MacCullough, who averages
19.1 points, 8.8 rebounds and 1.4
blocks per game.
Sophomore Deon Luton is sink
ing half of the team's three-pointers,
and led the Huskies with 20points in
a conference-opening win over rival
Washington State Monday.
Unfortunately, a lack of depth
will keep the Huskies struggling to
take fourth place.
Washington State (7-5,0-1)
The Cougars were already re
garded as one of the favorites to fin
ish in the basement of the confer
ence, and the loss of Rodrigo de la
Fuente, their leader in scoring, as
sists and steals, to a Spanish profes
sional league may have pushed
them over the top.
Carlos Daniel is second in the
Pac-10 with 9.3 rebounds per game,
but that's hardly going to be enough
to carry the team. Five conference
wins and it'll be a great year.
