Its most successful year in
school history. a terrific recruiting
class and an undefeated start still
haven't been enough to make the
men's basketball team the out
right favorite in the race for the
Pacific 10 Conference title.
National champion Arizona
and three-time defending Pac-10
champion UCLA have received
most of the publicity, but the No.
7 Cardinal (13-0. 2-0 Pac-10) has
quietly amassed the best record
in the conference.
Much of the reason the team
hasn't been more prominent is
because the Wildcats and Bruins
have faced tougher schedules.
Also, the Cardinal has been less
than-impressive in some games
against opponents they should
have bowled over.
But the Cardinal has what it

ever Pac-10 title. The only issue is
whether they can consistently
step up for big games. Their first
real test will come Jan. 17 when
the Bruins come to Maples
Pavilion.
"T here must be something
that we're doing well enough to
win. so we want to continue to do
those things." said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "I think
some of it has to do with our atti
tude and with our preparation
mentally going in to games and
willingness to do the little things
we have to do to win."
The obvious strength for the
Cardinal is their deep frontline.
Stanford boasts six post players
taller than Moot-8, which has led
to a 12 rebound per game advan
tage for the team, tops in the Pac
-10.
The extra height under the
board helped the Cardinal sweep
its road trip through ()regon after
power forward Mark Madsen
was sidelined for a monih with a
stress fracture in his right foot.
And this is with highly recruited
freshman Jason Collins still side
lined with a frayed AO in his left
knee.
The depth of the big men also
helped make up for center Tim
Young's early struggles, though
the 7-footer has begun to pick up
his game recently.
With Collins rejoining prac
tice yesterday, the C ardinal hope
to have him back for next week's
visits from USC and UCLA..
