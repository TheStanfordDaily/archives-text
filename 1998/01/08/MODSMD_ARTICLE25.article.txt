# Depth is Card's biggest weapon vs. UCLA. 'Zona

### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Its most successful year in
school history. a terrific recruiting
class and an undefeated start still
haven't been enough to make the
men's basketball team the out
right favorite in the race for the
Pacific 10 Conference title.
National champion Arizona
and three-time defending Pac-10
champion UCLA have received
most of the publicity, but the No.
7 Cardinal (13-0. 2-0 Pac-10) has
quietly amassed the best record
in the conference.
Much of the reason the team
hasn't been more prominent is
because the Wildcats and Bruins
have faced tougher schedules.
Also, the Cardinal has been less
than-impressive in some games
against opponents they should
have bowled over.
But the Cardinal has what it
takes to come up with its first
ever Pac-10 title. The only issue is
whether they can consistently
step up for big games. Their first
real test will come Jan. 17 when
the Bruins come to Maples
Pavilion.
"T here must be something
that we're doing well enough to
win. so we want to continue to do
those things." said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "I think
some of it has to do with our atti
tude and with our preparation
mentally going in to games and
willingness to do the little things
we have to do to win."
The obvious strength for the
Cardinal is their deep frontline.
Stanford boasts six post players
taller than Moot-8, which has led
to a 12 rebound per game advan
tage for the team, tops in the Pac
-10.
The extra height under the
board helped the Cardinal sweep
its road trip through ()regon after
power forward Mark Madsen
was sidelined for a monih with a
stress fracture in his right foot.
And this is with highly recruited
freshman Jason Collins still side
lined with a frayed AO in his left
knee.
The depth of the big men also
helped make up for center Tim
Young's early struggles, though
the 7-footer has begun to pick up
his game recently.
With Collins rejoining prac
tice yesterday, the C ardinal hope
to have him back for next week's
visits from USC and UCLA..
The main concern this vear
was how the team would adapt to
the loss of All-America guard
Brevin Knight to graduation, but
point guard Arthur Lee has shown
that he is more than capable of han
dling the pressure opponents have
been placing on him.
However, Lee does need to
work on his decision-making skills
and on not trying to force the game
along when things aren't going his
way.
"The turnovers he's made have
not been pressure turnovers,
they've been turnovers trying to be
aggressive of fen si ve I y."
Montgomery said. "If anything, he
got stubborn [against Oregon]
thinking he was getting fouled and
that he was going to get the call,
when the truth is he was never going
to get that call."

Lee also has a dependable back
up in senior Khamba Tshionyi, who
has been able to run the offense
smoothly. Freshman Mike
McDonald still has to develop more
control before he can be relied upon
in pressure situations.
The rest of the offense consists of
solid outside shooters with guard
Kris Weems and swingman Peter
Sauer. Weems showed how danger
ous he is with a 13-18,34 point night
against Oregon Monday.
David Moseley and Ryan
Mendez can also come off the bench
and hurt opponents from the
perimeter, which helps prevent de
fenses from collapsing on the
Cardinal big men.
For Stanford, all the pieces are in
place for a title run in a tough con
ference. They only need to prove
that they can come through in the
pressure situations in order to end
the schools' title-less drought.
