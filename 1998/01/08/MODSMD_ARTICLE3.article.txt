While the rest of last spring's grad
uating elass performed the "Wacky
Walk" through commencement cer
emonies. Brad Davies opted to hit
the road.
Davies, an American Studies
major and former captain of the
Stanford varsity soccer team, had
convinced his professors to let him

take his exams early in order to criss
cross the country in a giant hot dog on
wheels, otherwise known as the
Oscar Mayer Wienermohile.
Earlier in the year, some of
Davies' friends convinced him to
send in his application to Oscar
Mayer after spotting the job in the
book, "The 20 Best Jobs in Ameri
ca." One percent of applicants, re
cent college graduates, are chosen to

attend Hot Dog High, where they
learn to drive the touring vehicles.
"I fell in love with the idea," said
Davies, who enjoyed the thought of
road tripping while gaining experi
ence' in the corporate world.
As an Oscar Mayer Hotdogger,
Davies must travel the U.S. in a
Wienermohile for one year.
