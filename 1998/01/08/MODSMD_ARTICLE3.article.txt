### Bby Jennifer Saba 
While the rest of last spring's grad
uating elass performed the "Wacky
Walk" through commencement cer
emonies. Brad Davies opted to hit
the road.
Davies, an American Studies
major and former captain of the
Stanford varsity soccer team, had
convinced his professors to let him

take his exams early in order to criss
cross the country in a giant hot dog on
wheels, otherwise known as the
Oscar Mayer Wienermohile.
Earlier in the year, some of
Davies' friends convinced him to
send in his application to Oscar
Mayer after spotting the job in the
book, "The 20 Best Jobs in Ameri
ca." One percent of applicants, re
cent college graduates, are chosen to

attend Hot Dog High, where they
learn to drive the touring vehicles.
"I fell in love with the idea," said
Davies, who enjoyed the thought of
road tripping while gaining experi
ence' in the corporate world.
As an Oscar Mayer Hotdogger,
Davies must travel the U.S. in a
Wienermohile for one year.

Brad Davies, Class of '97, found his dream job driving an Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.

"We are goodwill ambassadors
lor the company," Davies said. "The
Wienermobiles are the cornerstones
for their marketing plans."
The Wienermobile made its first
appearance in 1936 as the "wiener
wagon." It traveled the streets of
("hicago carrying musicians to attract
attention.
Now Davies and his fellow
Hotdoggers travel with modern con
veniences including cellular phones,
video equipment and an entertain
ment system with a 27-inch color
television.
A typical work day can range any
where between three to 12 hours,
and sometimes Davies is required to
travel every day. "Traveling is the
hardest part," Davies said. "But I
can't complain."
Davies' responsibilities include
everything from making promotion
al appearances at football games to
assisting charity events and helping
grocery stores with hurting profits.
This past summer, the
Hotdoggers conducted a nationwide
talent search for Oscar Mayer com
mercials. More than 50,000 children
participated in the auditions.

"I heard the Oscar Mayer
I iloncy song about 2(H) times a day,'"
Davies said.
Davies admits eruising on the
road does have other
Eaeh touring vehicle towers 11 feejt
high, stretches 27 feet long ans
weighs 5 tons. Thus, navigating
Wienermobile can sometimes he fi
precarious duty.
Davies explained that sometimes
embarrassing road mishaps can
occur while maneuvering an imj
mense hot dog. On a trip to downf
town Boston. Davies and his partner
misjudged a bridge clearing during
rush hour traffic.
The Wienermobile, lodged bo
tween the road and the bridge, caused
a major gridlock and provoked ft
Boston city engineer to admonish
Brad and his partner. Even CNN
made an appearance to capture the
whole incident on national television:
Another time. Brad and his part
ner returned to their vehicle to discov
er that somebody had wrapped the
touring dog in Saran Wrap.
Despite these humorous setbacks,
Davies added that he meets "a lot of
gracious and friendly people."
Although Davies is content with
his present job, his plans for next year
are undetermined. "My life has be
come one big parade. All I do is honk
and wave."
