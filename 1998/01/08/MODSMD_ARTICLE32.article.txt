## Dunne Points His Finger at O.J. 
### Jennifer Godwin Contributing writer 
Dominick Dunne's O.J. book, "Another City, Not My
Own" (Crown Publishers, $25) is perhaps the first literature
to come of the trial. Amid all the words, all the chatter and
pulp, Dunne's book is the first to transcend the trial by saying
something about justice and the greater experience of the
trial. The O.J. Simpson trial was spectacle in the highest, but it
was built of serious themes like truth and justice.
Dunne's book is not art, but he does a wonderful job of
using the performance to talk about something greater. Some
how, amid all the gossip and name-dropping, Dunne has gone
beyond the bickering over evidence and has taken a very ur
bane and smart look at the trial. His perspective is unique, in
teresting to read and set deeply in the"he did it"camp.
You will like "Another City, Not My Own" if you believe
that O.J. Simpson is a killer and if you are interested in what
his trial meant to the people involved, which, in this case
means every one from Marcia Clark to the man on the street.
Dunne seems to have had lunch with most of the greater L.A.
area. His ability to blend the perspectives, the tips and the
backstage knowledge of everybody from movie moguls to golf
caddies is part of what makes the book fun. It also lends a feel
ing of balance, when in truth, Dunne works solely from the
perspective that O.J. is a killer.
Dunne is the father of a murdered child and a former Hol
lywood producer, both of which very much influenced his
coverage of the trial for "Vanity Fair" and his telling of the tale
in this book. Dunne's Hollywood days give him a feel for per
formance, respect for the intoxicating and dangerous power
of the spotlight and a raft of connections to the starry set. His

anger at his daughter's killing, and the subsequent light sen
tence received by her killer, have made him a journalistic cru
sader against the rich who mock the idea of justice and ma
nipulate the system.
Dunne pronounced O.J. a double murderer early on and
never slacked off. There was a certain irresponsibility and
flamboyance to his declarations but also an aura of bravery.
He also uses the book, as he used his column in "Vanity J air,'
to make character judgments about the main participants in
the trial: lto's star-struck, Cochran's a talented scum bag and
so on. Again, if you share his feelings, Dunne is a kind of hero
— the man who said what every one else was afraid to say. II
you are against him, Dunne can seem like a mad dog, slobber
ing and wild, with no sense of control or refinement, going for
every bone of gossip and every bare jugular.
Structurally, Dunne claims to have written a "novel" —
which happens to be peopled by real-life characters quoted
verbatim. Dunne is not writing a novel and the pretense is an
noying. He is writing non-fiction with the names of his fami
ly changed — he is "Gus Bailey" — and with the added star
power of Andrew Cunanan. (Don't ask.) The novelization is
awkward and remains uncomfortable throughout. Dunne as
Bailey is distracting and just plain weird.
If you found the O.J. trial interesting as a bizarre cultural
experience, Dunne's book is the one for you. It doesn't rehash
evidence, it doesn't report on the "real killers" or the "N
-word" or who said what when, but instead it casts a bright
light on what the trial meant to Los Angeles and to the nation.
It's an odd but powerful part of our recent history, and Dunne
is the first author to step back, take a deep breath and look at
what it all adds up to.
