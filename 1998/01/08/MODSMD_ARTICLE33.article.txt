# San Fran's "Big-Ass Mocha"
## A 						little taste of Big-Ass Mocha 
### Rito Trevi√±o Staff writer 
Have you ever had a bad experience with San
Francisco's Muni bus system? If so, you can sym
pathize with the hundreds of thousands of San
Franciscans who have to put up with the Muni
and other assorted outrages (like rotating kiosks
and 49ers President Carmen Policy's hair) every

day.
Fortu
nately, a lone
comic-strip
artist has taken
on the burden of
providing a
weekly dose of
politically incor
rect satire to
keep the masses
sane. This cham
pion of the
presses is Don
Asmussen,
whose "San
Francisco
Comic Strip" is
printed on Sun
days in the "San
Francisco Ex
aminer."
The strip

has now been
running long enough to put together a neat little
collection. So Asmussen has compiled his fa
vorite (and most controversial) strips into the
"San Francisco Comic Strip Book of Big-Ass
Mocha" (Russian Hill Press, $11.95).
"Big-Ass Mocha" exposes you to every aspect
of Asmussen's quirky style, from the poor like
nesses of celebrities to the wild-haired, fat-lipped
drawings of himself. Topics in the book include:
- Experiences at city landmarks. The first strip

makes fun of coffee houses (hence the title), and
another attacks Star Trek conventions. My fa
vorite is the "Adventure at Kabuki 8 Cinemas."
- Funny political groups. There's a "Kid's
Panel" where you get to connect the dots to draw
the GOP Big Tent of Inclusion that only enclos
es whites. There's also a panel that explains the
"devastating effects of secondhand homosexual
ity."
- The antics of the 49ers. In his "Niners
Makeover," Asmussen redesigns their uniforms
to include lingerie and skirts. He seems to have a
thing for Carmen Policy's "freakishly huge hair,"
where he draws VIP football seating and mini
malls.
- Local celebrity bashing. No one is spared,
from Willie "Da Mayor" Brown to TV anchor
Pete Wilson. He turns Supervisor Gavin New
som into a posterboy for Teen Beat magazine
and envisions a Pathfinder-like exploration of
columnist Warren Hinckle.
- An entire chapter about the Muni (of
course). Asmussen uses disgruntled Muni work
ers to explain social problems like the assassina
tion of JFK, and he reveals the secret "lurch" but
ton on all buses. He also invents things like the
"Muni Bus Stop Decoy" and the "Muni Passen
ger Deprivation Tank" so we citizens can fight
back.
The layout of the book is pretty clever, from
the clearly marked "Blank Pages at the Beginning
of Books" to the "Time Out Game Pages." The
strips are arranged by topic rather than chrono
logically, which makes things much funnier (and

much easier to find later).
There are two extra chapters that Asmusscn
made exclusively for the book. First is a "S.F.
Comic Strip History of Complete Inaccuracy'
where he explains how a Muni stagecoach led to
the first strip by his great-grandfather.
Then there's the "Criterion Edition Supple
mentary Section," which, like the laser disc pro
ducer, includes the panels left out of the "original
cut" of the book. One such panel is the "unicorn
dream sequence," which implies that Asmusscn
may be a replicant.
So is there any significant meaning behind
this sometimes sick humor? Well, among the
pictures of disillusioned gang youth and Bob
Dole's furrowed brow, Asmussen is making
some intelligent comments about our ridiculous
society. He playfully touches on our obsessions
with the media, sexual harassment policies and
deviant politicians and he ponders issues such as
the inherent racism in voting either way for
Pr0p.209.
And you don't have to be a resident or expert
on San Francisco to understand the humor. I
found myself laughing out loud at people I had
never even heard of. If anything, "Big-Ass
Mocha" provides the San Francisco novice with
an excellent scoop into the local celebrities,
politicians and other problems.
So while it may not be a national bestseller,
"Big-Ass Mocha" is a true "love letter" to San
Francisco. It'll make a great gift to a resident, a
political cynic or anyone else who would com
plain about the city by the bay.
