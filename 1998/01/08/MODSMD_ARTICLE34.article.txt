# Taking Our Pulse: The Health of America's Women
## 
### Kristie Lilje Editorial staff 
Most people have heard the news that California
has prohibited smoking in bars. The idea behind
the law, as well as the 1995 law banning smoking in
restaurants, is simple — people who work in both
bars and restaurants risk exposure to second-hand
smoke and the chemicals that cause lung cancer for
the sake of a job.
Some see the recent action by California law
makers as a gross abuse of power, which seems like
a valid concern. But how can we ensure that em
ployees of both bars and restaurants (who are pri
marily women) are working in safe conditions for
livable wages?
Although "Taking Our Pulse" (Stanford Uni
versity Press, $16.95) does not offer an answer to
this question exactly, the book does offer explana
tions as to why women face challenging issues in
juggling work and family, as well as to what role
health plays and should play in women's lives and
decisions.
Dr. Iris Litt, the book's author, attempts a
daunting task — to explain medical issues affecting
women through the life span while giving her read
ers insight as to why she feels women's health is at a
critical crossroad. A professor of pediatrics and the
director of both the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender and Adolescent Medicine at
Stanford, Litt's medical and feminist background
shines through in her writing.
"Taking Our Pulse" is a book about women —

about the issues that impact their lives medically, as
well as socially and economically. It's divided into
three sections that facilitate Litt's purpose well: a
chronicle of female health issues during key times
in their development (adolescence through old
age), a specific health section that addresses issues
such as sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy,
mental health and nutrition, and a final section that
summarizes the plight of women physicians and re
search regarding women's health.
Litt tried to accomplish too much in 300 pages.
Even though she concedes as much in the intro
duction, her efforts to combine an extensive review
of medical literature with a thesis-oriented book
minimize the effect of both. While Litt succeeds in
conveying to her reader a plethora of information
about women and the issues that affect them, the
objective character of her writing style reduces the
significance of her commentary.
It's difficult to present this degree of specific
medical information and keep the reader interested
in the central point of explaining it all in the first
place.
If you can read the book in its entirety, it is evi
dent that more money should be directed toward
medical research specific to women. Past research
and governmental regulation have not only gone as
far as prohibiting women from participating in
drug dosage research, but have blamed them for
creating their own poor health outcomes.
"The reality is that attitudes of both researchers
and potential female subjects must be changed. The
former must consider researching issues of impor
tance to women and their health, and the latter

must become involved as partic
ipants in research studies," Litt
writes.
But how is a waitress who
works at a bar in California going
to be able to participate in re
search studies when she may al
ready be losing money as a result
of new laws designed to protect
her health?
Litt should reveal more about
her experiences as a woman,
physician, professor and femi
nist to help answer these difficult
questions. More personal in
volvement would also move the
book along more quickly, but
Litt seems resolved to be unre
solved on specific solutions.
"Taking Our Pulse" empha
sizes that as a society, we have ne
glected women in a harmful way.
There's no denying that this
book is well-researchejl and an
excellent source to becoming
more in-the-know about issues
that affect yourself, your daugh
ter, your mom, your sister, your
wife or your girlfriend, but it's ul
timately just that — a reference
that brings up difficult issues that
anger, outrage, and educate, but
you'll have to sort them out on
your own.
