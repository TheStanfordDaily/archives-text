## If you can make it there, you'll make it anywhere Stanford Alum Richard Diebenkorn conquers New York's art world 
### Vanessa Stich 
With his huge retrospective at the
Whitney Museum in New York City
this month, the late painter and Stan
ford alum Richard Diebenkorn has fi
nally brought California art what it has
long lacked: respect.
For decades, our sunny state has
lingered on the outskirts of the mod
ern art scene. A haven for pop stars and
Hollywood hopefuls, California has
remained a pariah in the realm of
painting and sculpture. New York has
reigned supreme as America's artistic
capital, drawing both indigenous tal
ent and European expatriates to its
restless streets. The New York art es
tablishment embraced its own, and
poor California was shunned like a
freak cousin, unable to shed its uncul
tivated beach bum image.
At last, however, Diebenkorn has
penetrated the elite east coast circle,
placing himself among Jackson Pol
lock, Robert Rauschenberg and Roy
Liechenstein at the forefront of mod
ern art. Although posthumous
(Diebenkorn died at the Stanford Hos
pital in 1993), this show is an impor
tant affirmation of his contribution
and a key step in placing California art
beyond its regional barriers.
A San Francisco native, Diebenko
rn become interested in painting while
an undergraduate at Stanford in the
19405. Pressured by his parents to
study medicine or law, Diebenkorn
turned to art after seeing works by Ma
tisse and Cezanne in a friend's private
collection. It was also at Stanford that
Diebenkorn met his future wife Phyl
lis, a history major who encouraged
him to pursue his artistic talent.
In 1943, Diebenkorn, then a junior,
was called into military duty and
forced to transfer to Berkeley for his
final year. Fortunately, his links to
Stanford endured and he returned to
campus in 1963 as a visiting resident in
the art department. The Stanford Mu
seum gave Diebenkorn his first one
man show in 1964, starting Diebenko
rn on the road to international recog
nition.
Looking at Diebenkorn's painting
in the Whitney retrospective, as well as
those on view in Bay area museums, it
is not difficult to see why Stanford, and
now New York, have showered high
praise on his work. Diebenkorn is a
confident, powerful painter, with an
apt mastery of both color and compo
sitional structure. His work is innova
tive and unique, yet reflects a knowing
synthesis of preceding sources, from
Matisse and Mondrian to Edward

Hopper and Mark Rothko. There is a
wisdom in his picture, an astute un
derstanding of art, nature and human
ity.
As the Whitney show chronicles,
Diebenkorn began his career as an ab
stract painter, extracting wide brush
strokes and a dark, rich palette from
abstract expressionists like Rothko and
Clyfford Stills. His early work, like
"Untitled (Sausilito)" from 1949,
evokes the visual power of the Abstract
Expressionists within a coherent, con
trolled structure. There is energy in
these paintings, but not chaos. They
are emotional, but also register the ex
ternal environment, recalling the nat
ural patterns of landscape and geology.
These familiar elements connect us to
the paintings, and they draw us into
deeper mysteries.
In 1955, in a shift opposite to that
taken by most artists, Diebenkorn
moved away from this mode of ab
straction toward figurative painting.
The landscape motifs that had tenu
ously informed his abstractions are
clarified, becoming the focus of many
of his pictures. Simple and strong,
these landscapes are imbued with the
same self-assurance that marked his
earlier painting.
An outstanding example of this pe
riod is "Horizon-Ocean View" from
1959. "Horizon" imagines the land, sea
and sky as vibrant layers of greens and
blues. These bold layers verge on ab
straction: devoid of detail, they are
painted with large, almost gestural
brush strokes. A lone telephone wire
stretching from the foreground to the
background of the canvas is the only
indication of recessionary space, a sim -
pie and effective guide for our eye.
"Horizon" does not so much repre
sent an ocean view as suggest it, con
juring up our own image of the Pacific.
It has the feeling of an ocean view as
much as the look of it. It is this sensu
ous quality that gives Diebenkorn's re
duced landscapes their real appeal and
saves them from superficial mimesis.
During this same phase, Diebenko
rn also began to work with the human
figure. Much like the great figurative
painter ot the early 20th century, Ed
ward Hopper, Diebenkorn placed
models, primarily women, within his
landscape scenes. They stare out from
windows and porches in quiet, almost
brooding contemplation. There is a
harmony between the figures and the
landscape that prevents us from seeing
the landscape elements simply as
"background."
An especially striking painting of
this type is "Coffee," also from 1959. It
shows a woman sitting before a win

dow, slowly sipping coffee. A square of
green and a patch of blue sky are visible
through the window. "Coffee" is a mo
ment of calm, created both by the
peaceful action that it represents and
the stability of its strong horizontal
lines. Its loneliness only increases its
beauty, stirring our empathy for the
woman and our own feelings of isola
tion.
Although Diebenkorn was able to
find beauty and emotional resonance
in his figurative painting, he again
shifted his artistic direction and re
turned to abstraction. After leaving his
teaching post at Stanford, he accepted
a job at UCLA and moved to the sea
side artistic center of Venice. From his
studio in Ocean Park, he could look
out over the beach, the coastal light fil
tering into his windows. Inspired by
this new atmosphere, as well as the
work of his California peers, he soft
ened his palette and began creating
geometric abstractions with light
blues, violets and pinks accented by
bright yellows.
While these works, such as "Ocean
Park No. 107" from 1978, are com
posed of straight linear blocks and
planes, rather than naturalistic curves,
they are by no means dehumanized.
For within these bands of color, we
find the clear mark of Diebenkorn's
own hand — his rough brush strokes,
dripping skeins of paint, subtle varia
tions in the course of a line. These are
the expressive imperfections that give
"Ocean Park" life. They exist in unity
with the optically balanced structure of
the piece, realizing a synthesis that few
artists have reached. Between the two
poles of abstraction — the gestural and
the graphic — Diebenkorn mastered
the equilibrium.
And so Diebenkorn has shown that
California is not the cultural wasteland
that it once appeared to be. His art is
California art, born of its land and sea,
but is not merely a regional crop.
Diebenkorn has clearly earned his
entry into the New York art world and
his show should pave the way for other
deservinc West Coast artists as well.

The Diebenkorn Retrospective is
now on view at the Whitney Muse
um of American Art in New York.

study medicine or law, Diebenkorn
turned to art after seeing works by Ma
tisse and Cezanne in a friend's private
collection. It was also at Stanford that
Diebenkorn met his future wife Phyl
lis, a history major who encouraged
him to pursue his artistic talent.
In 1943, Diebenkorn, then a junior,
was called into military duty and
forced to transfer to Berkeley for his
final year. Fortunately, his links to
Stanford endured and he returned to
campus in 1963 as a visiting resident in
the art department. The Stanford Mu
seum gave Diebenkorn his first one
man show in 1964, starting Diebenko
rn on the road to international recog
nition.
Looking at Diebenkorn's painting
in the Whitney retrospective, as well as
those on view in Bay area museums, it
is not difficult to see why Stanford, and
now New York, have showered high
praise on his work. Diebenkorn is a
confident, powerful painter, with an
apt mastery of both color and compo
sitional structure. His work is innova
tive and unique, yet reflects a knowing
synthesis of preceding sources, from
Matisse and Mondrian to Edward

Hopper and Mark Rothko. There is a
wisdom in his picture, an astute un
derstanding of art, nature and human
ity.
As the Whitney show chronicles,
Diebenkorn began his career as an ab
stract painter, extracting wide brush
strokes and a dark, rich palette from
abstract expressionists like Rothko and
Clyfford Stills. His early work, like
"Untitled (Sausilito)" from 1949,
evokes the visual power of the Abstract
Expressionists within a coherent, con
trolled structure. There is energy in
these paintings, but not chaos. They
are emotional, but also register the ex
ternal environment, recalling the nat
ural patterns of landscape and geology.
These familiar elements connect us to
the paintings, and they draw us into
deeper mysteries.
In 1955, in a shift opposite to that
taken by most artists, Diebenkorn
moved away from this mode of ab
straction toward figurative painting.
The landscape motifs that had tenu
ously informed his abstractions are
clarified, becoming the focus of many
of his pictures. Simple and strong,
these landscapes are imbued with the
same self-assurance that marked his
earlier painting.
An outstanding example of this pe
riod is "Horizon-Ocean View" from
1959. "Horizon" imagines the land, sea
and sky as vibrant layers of greens and
blues. These bold layers verge on ab
straction: devoid of detail, they are
painted with large, almost gestural
brush strokes. A lone telephone wire
stretching from the foreground to the
background of the canvas is the only
indication of recessionary space, a sim -
pie and effective guide for our eye.
"Horizon" does not so much repre
sent an ocean view as suggest it, con
juring up our own image of the Pacific.
It has the feeling of an ocean view as
much as the look of it. It is this sensu
ous quality that gives Diebenkorn's re
duced landscapes their real appeal and
saves them from superficial mimesis.
During this same phase, Diebenko
rn also began to work with the human
figure. Much like the great figurative
painter ot the early 20th century, Ed
ward Hopper, Diebenkorn placed
models, primarily women, within his
landscape scenes. They stare out from
windows and porches in quiet, almost
brooding contemplation. There is a
harmony between the figures and the
landscape that prevents us from seeing
the landscape elements simply as
"background."
An especially striking painting of
this type is "Coffee," also from 1959. It
shows a woman sitting before a win

dow, slowly sipping coffee. A square of
green and a patch of blue sky are visible
through the window. "Coffee" is a mo
ment of calm, created both by the
peaceful action that it represents and
the stability of its strong horizontal
lines. Its loneliness only increases its
beauty, stirring our empathy for the
woman and our own feelings of isola
tion.
Although Diebenkorn was able to
find beauty and emotional resonance
in his figurative painting, he again
shifted his artistic direction and re
turned to abstraction. After leaving his
teaching post at Stanford, he accepted
a job at UCLA and moved to the sea
side artistic center of Venice. From his
studio in Ocean Park, he could look
out over the beach, the coastal light fil
tering into his windows. Inspired by
this new atmosphere, as well as the
work of his California peers, he soft
ened his palette and began creating
geometric abstractions with light
blues, violets and pinks accented by
bright yellows.
While these works, such as "Ocean
Park No. 107" from 1978, are com
posed of straight linear blocks and
planes, rather than naturalistic curves,
they are by no means dehumanized.
For within these bands of color, we
find the clear mark of Diebenkorn's
own hand — his rough brush strokes,
dripping skeins of paint, subtle varia
tions in the course of a line. These are
the expressive imperfections that give
"Ocean Park" life. They exist in unity
with the optically balanced structure of
the piece, realizing a synthesis that few
artists have reached. Between the two
poles of abstraction — the gestural and
the graphic — Diebenkorn mastered
the equilibrium.
And so Diebenkorn has shown that
California is not the cultural wasteland
that it once appeared to be. His art is
California art, born of its land and sea,
but is not merely a regional crop.
Diebenkorn has clearly earned his
entry into the New York art world and
his show should pave the way for other
deservinc West Coast artists as well.

The Diebenkorn Retrospective is
now on view at the Whitney Muse
um of American Art in New York.
City. For those who are unable to
visit New York within the next two
weeks, many Diebenkorn paint
ings are on view at the San Francis
co Museum of Modern Art, the De
Young Museum and the Oakland
Museum.
