## I Eat Low On The Food Chain: Allette Brooks â€™96 Tries Out Life As A Musician 
### Zachary Roberts Editorial staff 
Intermission called up 1996 Stanford
graduate Allette Brooks on Monday,
Jan. 5 to talk about her 1996 self-re
leased debut album, "Privilege," and life
as a musician. Dominated by sharp,
precise playing and long, poetic lyrics,
the upbeat acoustic "Privilege" com
bines the hopeful dreams of Joan Baez
with the social perspective and vocal
patterns of Ani DiFranco. There are
times when the playing should be al
lowed to stand for itself, without any vo
cals, but Brooks simply has so much to
say that she takes every opportunity to
speak out. A volunteer at the Battered
Women's Support Network of Santa
Clara county. Brooks believes that "It's
time to choose to selectively use what we
have been given without giving in."
Intermission: Are you happy with
your music?
Allette Brooks: 1 think that my new
demo is a lot more contemporary, a
better representation of my music
now than my first album "Privilege."
I: How so?
AB: I just started playing the guitar
three years ago, so my skills have been
getting better. I made the album after 1
had been playing for only about a year
and a half, so the new stuff is a little
gentler. It's not any less intentioned,
but it feels gentler.
I: What caused this shift?
AB: I've gotten more into relativity,
and I'm approaching things different
ly, now, although my lyrics are still di
rect and even comically so at times.
I've spent the last year and half out of
school, and that's affected my music a
lot, because I've really been dedicating
myself to it. It's been interesting to try
to figure out who I am now that I'm
not a student like I was for the first 21
years of my life, and that's just made
me see some things differently.
I: How has it been trying to survive
as a musician?
AB: I've been doing lots of academ
ic tutoring to make ends meet. I have
to earn money, but I want the time to
focus on skill building. There's lots of
musicians in the Bay Area, which is
both really inspiring and really diffi
cult. I've been learning not to get dis

couraged by individual musical situa
tions, but to observe the growth of the
whole experience, and I'm not setting
any triors specific goals or looking at
each positive or negative experience as
'this is it*.
I: What was your experience as a
musician at Stanford?
AB: I started playing the guitar dur
ing my junior year abroad, in
Botswana. When I came back, I was
pretty isolated, musically speaking. 1
just was not a part of the main music
community at Stanford. There were a
few other females here that I connect
ed with, but there was no real scene for
me to hook into. I was pretty much
writing in my musical journal and that
was it.
As soon as I left Stanford, though, I
felt a need to find a community of mu

sicians, but only in last few months I
have I gotten into the Palo Alto scene.
Working with Tony Kalife and Nick
Peterson, I've been feeling the com
munity. I still haven't found my niche
yet, though. I'm lacking other women
and women role models. lay Kadis
served as a great role model for record
ing the album. But now, well, role
model isn't entirely accurate. There's
lots of people who have been doing
what I'm doing for longer, and they
can help me, but I don't have a real role
model. That's not to say male role
models are bad, but I just want some
females, too. I'm starting to find a
place, but it's not forged yet. loan Ling
started a great thing called "Shevox,"
which is a gathering of women per
formers in the South Bay, and that's
been really interesting to be a part of.

I: You mention Jay Kadis. How was
recording your first album?
AB: The main good thing was that I
learned an incredible amount about
audio engineering and the evolution
of the creative process. I mean, I was
going in to the studio with just a sketch
of song. And to have an album and
have it be all me, as musician and en
gineer! It did effect my performance
to be the engineer, having to split my
attention between plaving and
recording. It's a lot easier to get car
ried away into the playing when
someone else pushes the buttons. But
it was my first recording experience,
and it was limiting in some ways.
I: Did you have an early musical
training?
AB: Yes, actually, I've been singing
since I was small and was classically

trained for many years. I sang musicals
and classical music and plays, so I've
always felt like a performance artist,
but never felt that I had found the right
medium. Everything 1 was singing was
written by dead white men, right? 1
wanted to be self-sufficient, and it's
nice to know that me and my guitar
can go anywhere and create a whole
musical world of our own. Which is
not to downgrade collaboration.
I: What about embarrassing early
tastes?
AB: [Laughsj Barry Mariilow was
my first favorite singer, and then
Donna Summers, and then Madonna
and Whitney Houston concurrently.
I: Hey, I love Donna Summers.
AB: Oh, yeah, me too. Barry is the
really embarrassing one. Whitnev is an
amazing singer, but her topics iust
don't hit me now like they used to.
I: What about current influences'
AB: What do you think?
I: Well. .. definitely some Ani
DiFranco.
AB: Yeah, Ani has been a big influ
ence, hearing her with her guitar. 1
think my big challenge now is finding
my own voice. When 1 hear my first
album 1 hear Am all over it, and I hope
that on second album I'll hear Allette.
I: That's an interesting name, Al
lette.
AB: It's my middle name, a combo
of my two grandmas, AUegra and Hen
riette. My first name is Lisa, but there's
lots of 'Lisa Brooks' around here. I
think there have been five or six at
Stanford in the last few years.
I: Anything else you want to get
into the article?
AB: I do want say something about
Synergy, but 1 don't know how to do it.
Whenever I picture myself singing at
Stanford, it's at Synergy or the Coffee
House.
