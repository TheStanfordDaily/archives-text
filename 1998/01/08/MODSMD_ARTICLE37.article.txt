## King Biscuit Flower Hour Emerson, Lake, & Palmer 
### 
One of the first releases from the
King Biscuit Flower Hour Records is
the new double CD set of Emerson,
Lake & Palmer (ELP), who appeared
on that very influential live rock radio
show twice.
And damned if those boys didn't
deserve it. ELP has been combining
hard-driving rock with brilliant jazz
with melodic pop for more than 25
years, as the band's four platinum al
bums prove ("Emerson, Lake &
Palmer," "Tarkus," "Pictures At An
Exhibition" and "Trilogy").
The first disc of the new double
CD set starts with 10 songs from their
1977 concert held in Wheeling,
WVa., beginning with the thunder
ously funky version of the "Peter
Gunn Theme," followed by a tight
version of the poppy blues ballad
"Tiger In A Spotlight."
Keith Emerson then enthralls the
audience with the melancholic harp
sichord of "C'est La Vie," after which
he dives into a rollicking piano im
provisation of over five minutes. This
is followed by a short but blistering

"Maple Leaf Rag," Emerson's third
solo track in a row.
Arthur Palmer drops in a short
and unimpressive drum solo, and the
band slips into the funky, slightly
ominous syncopation of "The
Enemy God." "Watching Over You,"
"Pirates" and "Fanfare For the Com
mon Man" finish off the Wheeling
show's tracks.
I'he first disc finishes with four
songs from the 1974 show at the Civic
Center in Tulsa, Okla., including the
top 10 hits "Still, You Turn Me On"
and "Lucky Man." Why the second
show is first on the disc is never ex
plained, but given the consistently ex
cellent quality of music on both discs,
only purists and rabid ELP fans
should find fault with this mis-order
ing.
The second disc contains only one
track, a monster 34-minute version
of "Karn Evil 9" from the Tulsa show.
The suite, from the 1973 album
"Brain Salad Surgery'," ranges from
synthetic dance-pop to screaming
distorted rock and includes a seven

minute drum solo by Palmer (which
far surpasses his earlier, unremark
able solo) that is followed by a stun
ning free-jazz improvisation by
Emerson. It is a mastery of conceptu
al rock orchestration in the style of
Yes, Pink Floyd and Richard Wagner.
This second disc is also a Mac / PC
compatible "interactive" CD-ROM
that is terribly disappointing. Each of
the band members has a short inter
view clip about their music and phi
losophy on music, while in the "Ex
tras" section the band tells some
mediocre tour stories.
Even worse is the appalling lack of
material in the "Photo" section,
which contains only six pictures of
the band in concert, and the "Cata
log" section, which gives thumbnail
views of the covers of the band's 1J al
bums but doesn't let them be en
larged to full screen pictures for clos
er inspection.
The only redeeming element of
the CD-ROM is the "Video" section,
contain full-length clips of ELP
singing "From The Beginning,"

"Lucky Man"
and "Paper
Blood." Al
though the
sound quality
is not great,
watching the
band perform
"live" is grati
fying, and the
inclusion of
"From The
Beginning,"
(one of ELP's
biggest hits
ever, which
was somehow
left off the first
CD) rectifies
what would
have been a
grave wrong to
ELP fans.

Still, the entire double CD is a bis
cuit for the present and future fans of
Emerson, lake 8c Palmer. The King
Biscuit Flower Hour recorded literal
ly hundreds of rock legends live from

1973 through 1995, and with over
1,000 hours of tapes in their vaults,
look for more great releases from the
King Biscuit Flower Hour Records.
This one is certainly a winner.
