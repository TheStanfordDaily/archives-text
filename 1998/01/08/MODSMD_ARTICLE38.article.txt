# Plays The Classic Rock Hits
## The 						Moog Cookbook 
### 
Dance party! The sopho
more album for this pair of
spacesuit-wearing freaka
zoids hits like a blast of funk
fired from their disco zap
guns. It seems that The Moog
Cookbook has taken 10 of
classic rocks most sacred
songs and fed them to it's pan
galactic tecnokittycat, who
promptly barfed up them
back up as geeky, stripped
down farcical techno.
What is wonderful is that
The Moog Cookbook has
utter awareness of the limits
of its own medium, and this
turns the album into as much
a spoof of techno and elec
tronic music as it is of classic
rock. On a three dimensional
grid formed by the axis of
David Byrne, David Bowie
and Weird Al Yankovic, The

Moog Cookbook shines right at the
intersection of the three vertices.
The Moog Cookbook starts by
tripping Steppenwolf's psychedelic
dream "Born To Be Wild" into the
geeky mid-tempo disco-dance track
it has always yearned to be. A watery
syrup of Ted Nugent's "Cat Scratch
Fever" is then stripped of all its
macho posturing by tinny lead
melodies and a fast drum-machine.
Lynyrd Skynyrd's southern classic
"Sweet Home Alabama" is rooted in
a tough little groove that slips into
three-fourth-time swings, which
eventually build into a rocket ship
lift-off finale complete with a classic
classic-rock false ending that blends
into a pleasant "More Than A Feel
ing."
A spacey version of "Ain't Talkin'
'Bout Love" ends with the ship of
song drifting through a cloud of cos
mic dust right into the full heavy

groove of Led Zeppelin's "Whole
Lotta Love." A 20-second segment
here reveals the true genius of The
Moog Cookbook; quickly rifting
Pink Floyd ("Dark Side of The
Moon"), The Who ("Baba O'Reilly")
and the Steve Miller Band ("Fly Like
An Eagle"), The Moog Cookbook
shows the true nature of the cookie
cutter psychedelia those bands could
produce in their less-than-brilliant
moments.
Actively invoking its father-figure
Bowie, The Moog Cookbook then
spins a slow version of "Ziggy Star
dust" that turns metallic and heavy
for the choruses. The ridiculousness
of the Moog as an instrument and
technodance as a genre is under at
tack; while each verse is treated with
respect, the overblown choruses rep
resent the deadly pitfalls of the
sound. After a false ending, though,
the song comes back for a jam on the

chorus that is groovily straightfor
ward, indicating the potential for
good that the instrument and style
both possess in balance with their
faults.
A semi-salsa'd "25 Or 6 To 4" is
too easy a target for the Moogmi
esters. Filled with what are by now
standard tempo and sound-shifting
tricks, the track adds nothing to the
album; it is just more of the same.
This one, of them all, sounds closest
to true Musak.
A complex, tidal "Hotel Califor
nia" roams from hillbilly polka to
boot-clomping waltz to blistering
mod techno and back again. The
album finishes with a frolicking
"Rock and Roll All Night" that fulfills
all expectations of a good Moog
Cookbook track; brilliant, geeky, in
novative and laconic.
