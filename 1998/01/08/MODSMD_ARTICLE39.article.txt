# MY WAY
## Usher 
### 
Chances are you first heard of
Usher because of his smash hit this
past summer titled "You Make Me
Wanna.. " If you like that song and
are thinking of buying the album, let
me give you some advice. Just buy
the single.
Not that the rest of the album is
all that bad, but most of the other
tracks don't compare to the hit that
has catapulted 18-year-old Usher
Raymond to the forefront of the
R&B scene.
"You Make Me Wanna... the

first single off Usher's sophomore
album "My Way," is refreshingly
honest, with lyrics that are believable
and solicit the listener's sympathies.
It's about something that could hap
pen in real life, falling for someone
while already involved. The chorus
goes, "You make me wanna leave the
one I'm with / Start a new relation
ship with you. . . . Now what's
bad / Is you're the one that hooked
us up / Knowing it should've been
you / What's sad is that I love her but
I'm falling for you."

For this album, Usher brought in
R&B / hip hop industry superstars
Antonio "L.A." Reid, Kenny "Baby
face" Edmonds, Teddy Riley of
Blackstreet and Jermaine Dupri as
producers. As expected, most of the
beautiful ballads on the album, in
cluding the appropriately titled
"Slow Jam" (featuring Monica) and
"Bedtime," are written by Babyface.
These two songs, plus "You Make Me
Wanna..are arguably the best on
the album.
The next single scheduled to be

released, "Nice 8c Slow," is melodi
cally fine, but the lyrics left me feel
ing a little uncomfortable, both at
the contrived nature of the rhymes
and because the song just didn't
seem to work.
Similarly, "Just Like Me," featur
ing in-your-face rapper LiT Kim, left
me feeling vaguely uneasy. Perhaps it
was because I didn't understand the
rap. What does "If I had one wish in
the world /1 swear to God it would
be for girls to rock pearls / Straight
out of the oyster" mean? In my opin

ion, Usher should stick to what he's
best at: slow songs and mid-tempo
tunes.
However, Usher's still young, and
it's obvious that he has talent. His
smooth vocals fit just right with the
dreamy melodies in "Slow Jam," and
"You Make Me Wanna..is pleas
ant to listen to, with its catchy beat
and well-timed guitar chords. Hope
fully in the future, Usher will work
on further developing his individual
style. It should be worth listening to.
