# Former president Pitzer dies
## Educator's impact was marred by Vietnam-era protests 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Former University President Kenneth
Pitzer, whose tenure stretched 20 tumul
tuous months during the Vietnam War.
died Dec. 26 of heart failure at age 83.
Pitzer held Stanford's sixth and shortest
presidential term. He was professor emer
itus of chemistry at UC-Berkeley at the
time of his death and also spent eight years
as president of Rice University before his
tenure at Stanford.
A distinguished chemist, Pitzer was re
membered as a shy man by his colleagues
at Stanford, who agreed that his presiden
cy would likely have been very different if
it had come at a different time.

Pitzer took the reins at Stanford on
Dec. I. 1968. bringing to a close a lengthy
search for a successor to Wallace Sterling.
At the time, the campus — like many oth
ers in the country — was racked with
demonstrations protesting the Vietnam
War and racial injustices.
Members of the Stanford chapter of
Students for a Democratic Society, who
had declared "Greet Kenneth Pitzer
Week." immediately tested his strength
when they appeared at the president's of
fice on his first day. In characteristic fash
ion. Pitzer spoke with the students for an
hour rather than calling in police to break
up the demonstration.
"I intend to have an open communica
tion with students as extensively as feasi

ble." he told The Daily during his first
week in office.
That communication was to break
down time and time again, however, as sit
ins and protests on campus continued to
grow.
"Things did not go well for him here."
said former University President Donald
Kennedy, who was a biology professor
during Pitzer's presidency and a member
of the faculty committee that advised the
Board of Trustees in his selection.
"It's very hard to know whether that
was partly because of him or partly be
cause of the time." Kennedy said. "It's not
clear that it wouldn't have been an ex
tremely challenging situation for anvone."
Pitzer — a scientist hv training
who served as chairman of the
National Academy of Sciences,
dean of UC-Berkeley's College of
Chemistry and director of research
for the Atomic Energy Commission
— was uncomfortable in confronta
tions and not eager for the debates
students demanded.
Describing the former president
as "thoughtful and cautious,"
Pitzer's special assistant Bill Wyman
said, "he just wasn't ready for the
kind of pressures that the students
put on him."
"He was a sensitive and very kind
man, and we got him in water that
was way too deep," said Wyman,
who also served as associate dean of
students.

Pitzer was born Jan. 6, 1914, in
Pomona, Calif., where his family
helped start the nearby Claremont
Colleges, one of which is named
Pitzer College.
He earned a bachelor's in
chemistry from Caltech in 1931
and a doctorate from UC-
Berkeley in 1935. After his tenure
at Stanford, he returned to
Berkeley to teach and continue his
research, vowing never to return
to an administrative post. He re
tired in 1984.
Pitzer's scientific reputation was
matched with a strong reputation
coming out of his eight years at Rice,
where he helped racially integrate
the school.
Stanford, too, saw significant
changes during Pitzer's tenure.
During 1969 and 1970, the
University launched its Program in
African and Afro-American

Studies, stopped offering credit for
Reserve Officers Training Corps
classes, and moved toward ending
its affiliation with the Stanford
Research Institute, which was doing
work on weapons used in Vietnam.
Pitzer openly opposed his coun
try's involvement in the war and
tried to use that to prove he was
sympathetic to students' interests,
remembered Kenneth Cuthbertson,
Stanford's vice president for devel
opment in the 19605.
And although that tactic didn't
succeed in Pitzer's ultimate goal of
calming students down,
Cuthbertson said, Pitzer "carried
out most of his work as president
quite well."
But a shy nature was "a heavy
package to carry at a time when we
were trying to deal with really outra
geous behavior," he added.
That personality made him stand

in stark contrast with then-Provost
Richard Lyman, who succeeded
Pitzer as president. Lyman "had a
much greater ability to debate peo
ple who were doing various things to
show their discontent,"
Cuthbertson said.
Calling Pitzer "very much a sci
entist," Wyman characterized the
president as "a gentle man ... used
to a kind of rational approach to
problems. It was not a time that left
him much chance to use those tal
ents."
Pitzer remained "curious about
what was going on with the stu
dents," Wyman said. In the end,
however, "he didn't really get it —
but nobody could."
A memorial service is scheduled
for Jan. 25 at 2 p.m. in the Great
Hall of Berkeley's Faculty Club.
Plans for a Stanford service are
pending.
