## Educator's impact was marred by Vietnam-era protests 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Former University President Kenneth
Pitzer, whose tenure stretched 20 tumul
tuous months during the Vietnam War.
died Dec. 26 of heart failure at age 83.
Pitzer held Stanford's sixth and shortest
presidential term. He was professor emer
itus of chemistry at UC-Berkeley at the
time of his death and also spent eight years
as president of Rice University before his
tenure at Stanford.
A distinguished chemist, Pitzer was re
membered as a shy man by his colleagues
at Stanford, who agreed that his presiden
cy would likely have been very different if
it had come at a different time.

Pitzer took the reins at Stanford on
Dec. I. 1968. bringing to a close a lengthy
search for a successor to Wallace Sterling.
At the time, the campus — like many oth
ers in the country — was racked with
demonstrations protesting the Vietnam
War and racial injustices.
Members of the Stanford chapter of
Students for a Democratic Society, who
had declared "Greet Kenneth Pitzer
Week." immediately tested his strength
when they appeared at the president's of
fice on his first day. In characteristic fash
ion. Pitzer spoke with the students for an
hour rather than calling in police to break
up the demonstration.
"I intend to have an open communica
tion with students as extensively as feasi

ble." he told The Daily during his first
week in office.
That communication was to break
down time and time again, however, as sit
ins and protests on campus continued to
grow.
"Things did not go well for him here."
said former University President Donald
Kennedy, who was a biology professor
during Pitzer's presidency and a member
of the faculty committee that advised the
Board of Trustees in his selection.
"It's very hard to know whether that
was partly because of him or partly be
cause of the time." Kennedy said. "It's not
clear that it wouldn't have been an ex
tremely challenging situation for anvone."
