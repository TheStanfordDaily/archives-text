# DAVE MATTHEWS BAND
## live at red rocks 
### 
With some bands, you hear their
hit songs a few too many times on
the radio, and that's it for them —
they're out of your musical reper
toire. With others, no matter how
many times you hear the music, you
leave the room craving more.
For some reason I can't get
enough of Dave Matthews Band,
and I was ecstatic that they decided
to release their latest double-live
album, "Live at Red Rocks," while
their loyal fans await the next studio
album with anticipatory fervor. The
band is phenomenal in concert,
with Matthews' distinctive voice
powered by the signature rocking
violin and brightly singing saxo
phone.
Matthews and company have
turned what could have been a dis
astrous combination of scratchy vo
cals and non-traditional-rock in
struments into an incredible display
of individual and collaborative tal
ent. But only in concert, when solos
and jam sessions abound, can you
really feel the full effect from these

accomplished musicians.
Barring an absence of some key
tunes from "Crash," the album does
well to quench any Matthews fan's
thirst. With jazzed-up versions of
favorites like "Proudest Monkey,"
"Satellite" and the band's ever pop
ular rendition of Bob Dylan's "All
Along the Watchtower," the album
sets out to please all the longtime
fans, and it does a good job of it.
The band stays close to the core
of its music, and the concert rendi
tions add just enough extra gusto to
the songs to keep things interesting.
Although some bands go overboard
with long instrumental solos in
their concerts, this group stays on
track, using extended intros and in
terim solos to provide dramatic an
ticipation without dragging.
The greatest thing about this
band is that its members know who
and where they are in the grand
scheme of things. The album is rife
with playful self-mockery, which
can be sensed in the intonations of
Matthews' voice, in the instrumen

tal solos and in modified lyrics.
Matthews prefaces "Recently"
with the first two lines of "Sunshine
on My Shoulders," and sax player
Leroi Moore belts out the refrain of
"Somewhere over the Rainbow"
during a solo on "Lie in our Graves."
The group is as welcoming and
warm as its music, and that's what
keeps its fans coming back.
It was a bit disappointing not to
hear "So Much to Say," "Too Much"
or "Crash," but then again, every
body's probably heard those tunes
enough anyway.
Having seen the band in concert,
I wasn't surprised at this album's ex
cellence, although it was surprising
how differently a concert can trans
form what you know of the band.
Live recordings always give you a lit
tle more insight into what a band is
really like, and this album would
probably be worth the $20 for that
reason alone. Luckily, the band also
plays some damn good music.
