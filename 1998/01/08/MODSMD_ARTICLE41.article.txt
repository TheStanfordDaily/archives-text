## Ulali 
### 
Ulali defies categories, but I will catego
rize them anyway. It is a First Nation
women's a cappella group that manages to
blend the sounds of hip hop, blues, jazz,
rock and Native American music seamless
ly, beautifully, movingly.
One of the best things about listening to
Ulali is that it is contemporary. Influenced
by many styles of music, Ulali isn't limited
to following those genres exactly. Ulali
fuses distinct musical styles into a new
style altogether, using drums, rattles,
rhythms and vocal somersaulting. It cre-

ates a sound that can be haunting, invigo
rating, relaxing and baffling.
Ulali prides itself on understanding that
it is a part of a world community; "mahk
jchi" means "true love." Like Sweet Honey
in the Rock, these women have strong mes
sages to go along with their strong voices,
and the music is fun to sing along to even if
you don't understand what they are saying.
The trio is comprised of Pura Fe, Soni
Moreno Ciballero and Jennifer Kreisberg.
You may not have heard their names be
fore, but you've probably heard them sing;

they appear on the soundtrack to Turner
documentary "The Native Americans,"
and they have appeared on the Jay l.eno
show as well as shared the stage with acts
like The Indigo Girls, David Byrne, the B
52's and lackson Browne.
This is the kind of music that brings
strangers to your room and calls to your
phone and notes from secret admirers
from across the catwalk. This is the kind of
music that you don't hide from your
snooty friends, your hippie friends, the
friends who only listen to classical music

or your world beat friends. This is the kind
of music that will make you new friends
and solidify old relationships. This is jog
ging music, studying music, sing-along
music and tear your hair out music.
If you like folk, you will definitely like
this album. If you don't like folk, you are
just damn likely to like this album. Either
way, its some good stuff. Buv it! It's just
that good.
