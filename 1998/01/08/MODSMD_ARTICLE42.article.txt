The latest Iggy Pop is a live recording of
the 'Mighty Pop' himself performing at
The Channel (Boston) in 1988. At the
time, Pop had just finished his "Instinct"
album and was touring with lead guitarist
Andy McCoy of Hanoi Rocks, UK Subs
bassist Alvin Gibbs, Psychedelic Furs
drummer Paul Garristo and keyboardist
Seamus Beaghen of Madness.
Sound quality is far superior to most
live releases, making it a must have for
Iggy Pop die-hards as well as casual fans
who enjoyed listening to "Lust For Life"
on the Trainspotting soundtrack. In addi
tion to songs from "Instinct" and his
other solo releases, Pop also plays a few
classic songs that he sang while he was in
The Stooges: "Search And Destroy" and"I
Wanna Be Your Dog."
With the sizzling opener "Instinct,"

Pop hits the stage full throttle, guitar on
Fire, screaming, "Let's do it! Do it!" The
music is no joke — the band follows suit
hard and heavy, breathing pure life and
energy into Pop's beautifully tattered
voice. "Instinct keeps me running / run
ning like a deer," sings Pop. "Instinct
keeps me running / running where the
sun will bless me."
On "Penetration," Beaghen's organ
jumps out of the limelight to rocket the
show to new heights, while McCoy's gui
tar feeds off of the intensity. Every num
ber on this album is a real gem.
Pop's commentary between songs
alone almost makes the album worth
while. Before launching into "Fligh On
You," the most powerful track of the
record, Pop says, "Yea. This is a song I
wrote, I got really pissed off, I couldn't

take drugs anymore, when my mind got
blown. So 1 thought I'd just have to get
high on you. Everybody wants to feel high
— that ain't no damn crime."
Later, as McCoy rips into a piercing
blues guitar solo to kick off "Johanna,"
Pop explains, "This is about a girlfriend I
used to have — well, yea! — she spent all
my money on heroin. 1 loved her for it."
True to the rest of the album, "lohanna" is
a real smoker. "lohanna, Johanna, I hate
ya cuz you're the one I love," Pop sings.
The show is 70 minutes of non-stop
rock and roll the way it was meant to be
heard. If the clouds turned bright green
and Martians descended upon the earth in
search of an American rock CD, I might
have to give them Iggy Pop at The Chan
nel.
