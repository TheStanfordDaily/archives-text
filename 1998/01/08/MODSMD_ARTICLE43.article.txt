## Fit To Be Tied Joan Jett 
### 
Joan Jett occupies an uneasy position in the
history of rock and roll. Because the biggest
musical trend of 1997 happened to be
"Women in Rock" (note the cover stories in
Time, Rolling Stone and Spin), Jett should be
recognized as a pioneering figure for being one
of the first commercially successful female
rockers.
Indeed, when no American label would re
lease her music, Jett manufactured her own
success by releasing her first solo album inde
pendently, proving that Ani DiFranco is not as
progressive as everyone would like to believe.
However, Jett has never developed the revo
lutionary reputation attached to contempo

raries like Chrissie Hynde and Patti Smith be
cause she has always presented herself as an
oddity, a woman who likes to play masculine
rock 'n' roll. Her original hand, the Runaways,
was little more than a male fantasy; the mem
bers looked like the Spice Girls but made the
mistake of trying to play their instruments.
On her own, Jett patterned her music after
the glam rock of Gary Glitter and became fa
mous by playing songs written hymen ("1 Love
Rock And Roll," "Crimson And Clover" and
"Light Of Day"). The sound was terrific, but
clearly, Jett cared more about her music than
her gender.
Accordingly, the release of her greatest hits

album, "Fit To Be Tied," proves Joan Jett's
worth not as a female artist, but as one of the
decade's essential rockers. Lacking a single
weak track, the album is packed with expected
pleasures and obscure gems.
"Little Liar" and "Make Believe" both deliv
er hidden punches, and "Love Is All Around"
(the theme song from"The Mary Tyler Moore
Show") displays just how interesting cover
songs can be.
Jett gives "Bad Reputation" and "Cherry
Bomb" all the rebellious fervor those anthems
deserve. "Do You Wanna Touch Me? [Oh
Yeah!]" is a faithfully trashy version of a Gary
Glitter original, and her cover of Jonathan

Rich man's "Roadrunner" suggests that Jett has
deeper roots in the modern rock community
than one suspects.
Still, the album's high point comes from her
biggest hits, "I Love Rock And Roll" and"I
Hate Myself For Loving You." In particular, the
latter stands out as a towering masterpiece of
'80s hard rock. Proving that power chords can
swing, the song's hooks are as irresistible now
as they were 10 years ago.
Some artists seem born to compile incredi
ble greatest-hits packages (Billy Idol, are you
listening?). Jett does not disappoint.
