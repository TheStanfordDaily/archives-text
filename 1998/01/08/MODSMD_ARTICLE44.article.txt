## The
						Tea Party 
### 
Combine Soundgarden and
Loreena McKennit's "The Mask
and the Mirror," and you'll get
something that sounds a little like
this. It's a full album: expansive
and clearly influenced by indus
trial, techno, Led Zeppelin and
Middle East traditional music.
The Tea Party uses 31 different
ethnic instruments, some
Lebanese funeral music, orches
tra hits and more aggression than
I have heard on a non-punk
album in a long time. Screams,
wails, slow build-up, orgasmic
song endings and innovative use
of different musical styles make
this a complete, thick-sounding
album.
This is not folk music. This is
sit in your room and brood about
why you hate your parents music.
I like it. But my parents wouldn't.
Most unfortunately, the Tea

Party writes somewhat angsty
lyrics with words that sound curi
ously like the poems I wrote in ju
nior high school that made me
feel deep.
Here's some Tea Party lyrics: "I
took a slide, slipping down / a
staircase, a Piranesian
dream / My senses reeled, dis
torted by darkness /1 lit my way
with a scream."
I have no idea what kind of
songwriter uses the word "Pi
ranesian," but whatever.
Here's another one: "Driven
by restrained desire, I want what I
need / Shaking as her sex takes
hold, I've lost all control."
Feeling a little restrained and
sexual?
Here's my favorite: "Now that
the thrill of the massacre's
over / Isn't it sweet when she
sucks on vour veins? / I've waited

so long. I've waited so long. I've
waited, I've waited... so long."
This is another one of those
'please don't read the liner notes'
albums. The overall sound of the
album is so big that it's hard to
understand the lyrics if you don't
read the notes. So don't read
them, or you'll end up laughing at
a CD that needs to be praised for
creating an original, energetic
and moving sound.
Still, this is music I wish had
been available when 1 was hating
myself in junior high. All we had
was Def Leppard to bang our
heads to. This would have been
much, much better. The produc
tion on the album is impeccable,
with no empty musical space on
the album, and a couple of mel
low songs interspersed keep the
album balanced.
