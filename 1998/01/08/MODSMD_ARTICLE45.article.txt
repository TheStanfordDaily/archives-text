# Welcome To Our World
## Timbaland & Magoo 
### 
Wanna know what hip-hop is
gonna sound like in 1998? Well,
Background / Atlantic duo Timba
land and Magoo have their own ideas.
Their debut album "Welcome to Our
World" attempts to take the nation's
hottest musical genre to the next level
by going light on sampling and heavy
on the creative beat looping. What's
old is new again.
The first single for the Norfolk, Va.
natives, "Up lumps Da' Boogie," hit
hard in '97, spotlighting Tim and
Magoos freestyle flow and featuring
"Supa Dupa Fly" songwriter / artist
Missy Elliot. The album also includes
a sped up and lyrically laced remix
version of the cut
What makes "Welcome to Our
World" fresh is a unique sound creat
ed with both peculiar arrangements

and quirky vocal styles. Timbaland's
bassed-out walkie-talkie sound is bal
anced with Magoos slightly nasal in
flection reminiscent of Tribe's Q-Tip.
Their sound is complemented by the
background vocals of Aaliyah on
tracks like "Man Undercover" and
Playa on "Luv 2 Luv U."
The tone of the album is reflected
in what has been labeled it's "back to
the future" approach — essentially a
focus on funky beats and rhythms
and rhymin' about everything from
verbal vainglory to the ability to move
a crowd. That's it! The basics, nothing
fancy. No Versace or crushed linen or
Moet or 0r...
Extra cool points go to "Peepin'
My Style," Timbaland's solo bump
driven funk anthem, where he pro
fesses: "I don't mean to brag, I don't

mean to
boast / But I got
baking me some
of that good
French toast."
In addition,
heads will invol
untarily nod to
the "Clock
Strikes" (remix),
a thumpin' cut
that features
rhymes over the
Knight Rider
theme and the
chorus: "Par-ties!
Hey, and funky
beats ha
hah /Do you
know what that
means? / It's 12

o'clock, and the party just don't stop."
The album's prehistoric pio
neerism lies in old school beats that
drum on as steady rhythms, then
break, flip and loop onto themselves.
Timbaland and Magoo combine
these with a lyrical flow that goes from
pure urban poetry to good ol' non
sense nursery rhymes. Also be on the
listen-out for human sound effects
like turntable scratches, telephone
rings, etc.
Timbaland and Magoo also bring
their DJ and producer backgrounds,
working with such artists as Gin
uwine and SWV, to their own album,
naming "Welcome to Our World"
into an experimental tour through
the world of futuristic hip hop they
envision for the millennium.
