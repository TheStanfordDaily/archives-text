If you have yet to hear of Roni
Size / Reprazent, welcome to
planet Drum and Bass. Insiders
and music followers know Size,
whose double disc "New Forms,"
from Loud / Polygram, beat out
Prodigy and the Chemical Broth
ers among others for the 1997
Mercury Music Prize, as the new
king of D 'n B.
Because these are the days of
mandatory labeling, the drum
and bass tag given to the album's
sound can be characterized as,
essentially, funky electronica.
This UK scene has given us
Grooverider and Massive Attack
to name a few.
Size's Reprazent project in
cludes DJ Krust, DJ Die, D! Suv,
MC Dynamite, Clive Deemer
(drums), Sy John (bass) and On
allee and Bahamadia (vocals).
The Bristol-based conglomerate
has compiled a collection of 22
tracks of jungle jingles and digital
ditties for this release.
The production value in the
project is the fearless experimen
tation with sound and noise and
beat and rhythm. The bulk of the
collection consists of techno
basslines infused with electronic

buzzes, bells and bleeps. The re
sult is interplanetary jungie,
prepping ears for 2000.
"New Forms" is held together
by a glue of jungle and acid jazz as
the foundation on which Size and
crew proceed to layer hip hop
beats and quasi-inspirational
disco vocals. For instance, on disc
one's "Heroes," Onallee croons to
club kids, "I don't know no he
roes / They can tell the story / I
don't know no heroes / They can
get the glory."
From the digital swing of
"Destination" to the acoustic trip
hop of "Brown Paper Bag," "New
Forms" is chockfull of futuristic
fantasy, pushing the envelope on
how existing music styles are
blended.
While "Beatbox" is an inter
mission featuring nothing but
hip hop's oral invention over
sparse sonic sounds, "Morse
Code" is barrage of funky break
beats laced with telegraph beeps.
On disc two, "Change My Life"
combines space age piano strokes
spliced between a constant
bassline, and "Share the Fall" has
a funky drum pattern, a swingy
sax section and a sample of Rosin

Murphy's "Boo." This kind of
potpourri makes "New Forms" a
daringly bold collection — for
ward and riskv.
Warning: "New Forms" is def
initely not to he consumed in one
sitting. As with other genres of;
electronic music that do not
place emphasis on vocals, the
whole thing at once can be a bit
incessant. The repetitious drum
beats and chimes can become
hypnotic, which is probablv bet
ter than other wavs to achieve
this effect, but can leave vou ask
ing: Wait, did I lust hear this
song?
Whether Size is truly a lungU
genius remastering music to in
spire the coming millennium or
whether Reprazent is iust a col
lective stumbling upon groovy
combinations by chance remains
to be seen States-side. . . and
probably shouldn't be the main
concern.
For now, just get on board the
funk starship for a rhythmic ride,
where technology meets tonic
melange, groove is your guide
and your captain is a b-bov and
his crew.
