# BBC Sessions
## Led Zeppelin 
### 
For the first time in a long time,
Led Zeppelin has released an album
that really counts. The power of "BBC
Sessions" will help you forget about
Plant and Page's dismal duo stuff of a
few years back, and it will help you
forget about the unnecessary second
box set.
Forget reading the liner notes the
first time you listen to this, just sit in a
semi-dark room with a beer or
EANAB and listen. Everything vou
need to know about the music is con
tained in the music. If you want to
know the history, then read the liner
notes — but only after vou ve listened
to the album.
It is raw, blistering Zeppelin. The
bluesy beginnings of disc one ("You
Shook Me" and "1 Can't Quit You
Baby") blend into the firestorm of
Pages guitar on "Communication
Breakdown." And "Dazed And Con
fused" is a nightmare of dark efful
gence that would work as the sound
track to Orpheus' descent into Hell.
The disc continues with the previ
ously unreleased "The Girl I Love She
Got Long Black Wavy Hair," a master
piece of cocksman blues anchored by
John Paul Jones' funked out bass line.
An elastic "What Is And What Should
Never Be" is followed by a more stan
dard but still enticing version of
"Communication Breakdown."
Multiple versions of songs are
common on this two disc, 24-track
album. "Communication Break

down" shows up three times, and
"You Shook Me," "I Can't Quit You
Baby," "Dazed And Confused" and
"Whole Lotta Ix>ve" all appear twice.
But every version of every track is
unique in sound and feel, making
each one worthwhile in its own right.
And there is a pattern to the madness;
while one version is somewhat tight,
the other is usually an eclectic jam that
lasts several minutes longer. Even the
three "Communication Break
down's are all entirely unique in feel
ing; and by having the three together
on the first disc, the listener is given
the chance to hear and get both the
subtle and major differences in the
versions.
The first disc rounds out with clas
sic renditions of "Traveling Riverside
Blues" and "Whole Lotta I,ove" com
plete with a space jam and Plants
vocal orgasms. It also includes the
never-before released fast juke-joint
blues "Somethin* Else" and a terrify
ing 12-minute version of "How Many
More Times."
There is a major difference be
tween the two discs, however. The first
is a compliment of five studio and live
sessions from March and June of
1969, while the second is completely
from April 1, 1971. Live and without
overdubs, it predates Led Zeppelin's
earlier live effort "The Song Remains
The Same," by five years.
The energy on the second disc is
cataclysmic and focused. Bonham

floats through his drumming duties
like a river, Jones pounds out fierce
bass lines, and Page is simply unfor
giving with his hammer-and-hook
riffs. Excellent versions of "Since I've
Been Loving You," "Going To Califor

nia," "That's The Way" and a 18-
minute "Dazed And Confused" are
just a few of the treats this second disc
holds.
For the old Led Zep fan, thus disc
offers two newlv released songs and

hours of vintage live Zeppelin. And
for the new tan, it otters an under
standing of whv there are so many old
led Zep fans surrounding vou.
