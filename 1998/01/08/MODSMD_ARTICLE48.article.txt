# As Good As It Gets
## 
### 
"As Good As It Gets" is a real
treat of a movie. Jack Nicholson
stars as Melvin Udall, seemingly
the most despicable man on the
face of this planet. If that weren't
bad enough, he's a writer, too. We
know he's mean, because the first
thing he does is hurl a sweet little
dog down a rubbish chute in pun
ishment for his un housetrained
ways. The dog's called Verdell
(not a usual doggy name, but his
owner is an artist), and he sur
vives this ordeal magnificently.
Far worse things are in store
for the people around him: artist
Simon (played by Greg Kinnear),
waitress Carol (the excellent
Helen Hunt), and Melvin himself.
It's a dog's life.
Simon (who is gay) and Melvin
have the misfortune of being
neighbors. Simons bad luck is
that Melvin is a homophobic mis
anthrope, and Melvin's bad luck
is that he is a homophobic misan
thrope.
Actually, Melvin is unluckier
still: he is also an anti-Semite who
hates blacks and doesn't much
like children, old people, fat peo
ple, stupid people, people or ani
mals. It's not a silent hatred, ei
ther. The only person he might

possibly not hate is Carol, who
serves him breakfast every morn
ing in a Manhattan diner.
Carol's predicament is that her
young son Spence is dangerously
ill and always has been. Because
she has no money, Spence has no
chance of getting better, and so
Carol's life is a three-cornered
roller coaster ride from the emer
gency room to the diner to her
dingy home and back again to the
emergency room. There's no
space in her life for extra abuse,
but just in case there is, Melvin is
ready to brighten her every morn
ing with callous words.
It's a very rich brew indeed,
and there's more to come. Disas
ter strikes Simon viciously, in the
shape of a heavy metal lamp stand
wielded by a thug. Soon enough
the hospital bills start mounting,
and his friends start melting
away. To add insult to injury, he
learns that beloved Verdell has
been left in the care of Melvin.
For this thoughtful act, he can
blame Frank, his art dealer,
played by that shameless scene
stealer Cuba Gooding, Jr.
Somehow these crazy lives be
come bound up together into a
single destiny, or more accurately,

into a single car heading to Balti
more. There's nothing like it: it's
not quite a love triangle, it's not
quite a road movie, and it's not

quite a soul-enhancing voyage of
discovery and redemption. It's
more like a bunch of very talented
actors running with a blisteringly

hot script.
Writer / director / producer
lames L. Brooks can be proud.
