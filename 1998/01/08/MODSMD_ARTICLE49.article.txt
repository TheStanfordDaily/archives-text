# Jackie Brown
## 
### 
So not every Quentin Tarantino movie ends
with a Mcxican standoff. They don't all have gra
tuitous-yet-amusing violence, and they aren't all
brimming with off-topic dialogue.
The one thing that cult writer / director
Tarantino has retained in his latest film, "Jackie
Brown," is the long length, nearly three hours.
That's a bad thing, because the movie isn't all
that epic.
The screenplay is adapted from Elmore
Leonard's book "Rum Punch." It's the story of
lackie Brown (Pam Grier), a 44-year-old
woman stuck with a job as a flight attendant on
a less-than-reputable airline.
Jackie makes a little money on the side by

transporting cash for a gun dealer named Ordell
Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson). Ordell employs
many other charming crooks, including Louis
(Robert DeNiro), an old prison chum, and
Melanie (Bridget Fonda), his so-called "surfer
girl."
Ordell wants Jackie to bring him the
$500,000 he's got tucked away in Mexico. ATF
detective Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton), who's
already caught her smuggling once, threatens to
imprison her if she doesn't help him nail Ordell.
But Jackie has her own plans, and they in
volve that half-million bucks. Aided by Max
Cherry (Robert Forster), an aging bail-bonds
man who has a crush on her, she attempts to

outwit everyone.
It's not a bad plot,
and Tarantino actu
ally unfolds it well
enough to keep you
guessing through the
last half of the movie.
But it's just not that
memorable, so it
drags on. Come on,
what's 500 grand
next to the bag of di
amonds in "Reser
voir Dogs" or the
precious briefcase in
"Pulp Fiction"?

"Jackie Brown"
does have its strong points, including a charm
ing '70s style and top-notch performances all
around. At just the right moments, Pam Grier
gives Ms. Brown her qualities of strength and wit
as well as confusion and hopelessness. Robert
Forster makes his gallant-knight character so
simple and naive that we sincerely hope that he'U
live through the mess and get the girl
The most noteworthy performance is deliv
ered by Jackson. Ordell is at once the funniest
and the scariest character in the film. Sure, he
says the N-word enough times to draw criticism
from Spike Lee, but in my opinion, a guy this evil
can mouth off however he likes.
You can't blame Tarantino for wanting to try

something different He stated in an interview
that "Jackie Brown" is the least "Tarantino-like"
of his films. It's actually a mature step from his
trademark blend of violence and pointless ban
ter. Unfortunately, Miramax marketed it as the
same-old same-old, and moviegoers expecting
men in black suits and sunglasses with itchy trig
ger fingers may be in for a disappointment
