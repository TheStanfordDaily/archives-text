## Tomorrow Never Dies 
### 
Bond-James-Bond saves the
world once again from mass de
struction in "Tomorrow Never
Dies," this time with the help of a
female kung fu action hero and a
swanky cell phone that does
everything from electrocuting
people to driving a BMW.
Times have changed for 007,
and these changes were hinted at
in the last installment, "Golden
eye." But the latest emblazons a
modernized, somewhat less
mysoginistic attitude all over the
screen, without the least inhibi
tions. Gone are the useless chicks
lying around nude except for a
layer of gold paint. And Pussy Ga
lore is no where in sight.
Okay, okay, so there's a brief
PG sex scene with some Danish
woman and an equally brief PG
-13 tryst with Ten Hatcher. Oh,
and for you Hatcher fans — sure,
she's on the poster, but she only
gets about five minutes of screen
time.

But good ol' James "Shaken
not-Stirred" Bond has to eat
some of his words when Michelle
Yeoh, who has fighting moves so
incredible that she should be
everyone's hero, shows up. She's
Wai Lin, a Chinese agent, and
Bond is forced to pair up with her.
The two keep on crossing each
others' trails in trying to bring
down the overly mean, cartoon
ishly evil media mogul Elliot
Carver (Jonathan Price) who is
trying to start World War 111 with
a scheme that is somewhat elabo
rate and quite fragile. Well, actu
ally, limbo is not forced to team
up with Wai Lin — he kind of
proposes the pairing himself with
Wai Lin resisting the whole way.
So is Pierce Brosnan still play
ing the James Bond everyone has
grown to know and love — with
the exception of the Timothy Dal
ton years? The answer is yes, be
cause James and Moneypenny
volley sexual innuendoes with no

sign of slowing down. Jimbob
wears a tux at a cocktail party. The
heart-stopping opening sequence
delivers. And there's a great BMW
souped-up by the one and only Q.
But is "Tomorrow Never Dies"
a true James Bond movie? Not in
the traditional sense. In contrast
to the somewhat slow, yet always
entertaining Sean Connery and
Roger Moore precursors, this one
is almost all action and almost no
intrigue. There are some ab
solutely incredible stunts includ
ing an unbelievable one in which
a helicopter chases Bond, who's
on a motorcycle, through some
crowded market streets in Viet
nam. The helicopter dips forward
almost far enough for the blades
to graze the ground.
"Tomorrow Never Dies" is
James Bond on an adrenaline
rush. It's extremely fun to watch,
but die hard 007 fans may be a lit
tle disappointed.
