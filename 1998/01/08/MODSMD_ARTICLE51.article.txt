The historical scene that
James Cameron has created
in "Titanic" is one of the
most extraordinary in film
history. Cameron's movie
does what film ultimately
should do: create and play
a story that our imagina
tions could never fully cre
ate.
To watch hubris, as it
plucks apart the maritime
revelation that was "Titan
ic," is a truly dazzling expe
rience because Cameron
moves so superbly between
the smallest details and the
colossal imagery of an
ocean liner breaking in
half. Each of the many de
grees of the Titanic's
tragedy are illustrated with
heartbreaking power. The
characters of "Titanic" are
cardboard, most of the dia
logue is crap and the plot
points are boring, but the
magnificent sight of the
sinking "Titanic" truly
takes your breath away.
Cameron has created a
film that would be one of
the best of all time if it were
not for his inability to cre
ate human characters and
believable dialogue. We see
hubris twice when we
watch "Titanic:" first in the

sinking ship, and second as
Cameron tries to write ro
mantic script that is be
yond his abilities. Why
spend $200 miliion repli
cating the ship when you
refuse to spend $200,000 to
hire a decent screenwriter?
Cameron's romantic as
pirations feel like a ratio
nalization for the 90 min
utes of flooding and may
hem, not a sincerely felt
human tragedy, and that
dishonesty is unfair to both
the audience and the char
acters.
As for our actual time
aboard the Titanic, it is a
historical recreation of im
mense proportions. The set
design and costuming are
perfect, offering at least a
beautiful stage on which
the actors can read their
lines. In addition to suffer
ing horribly cliched dia
logue, the characters them
selves are simplistic: the
good-hearted rebel, the
stiff but sweet society girl
in need of rescue from her
repressive life-style, the
clutch of snobs who keep
her confined.
Jack Dawson (Leonardo
DiCaprio) is the wild, free
spirited and poor artist, of

ficially below the likes of
Rose (Kate Winslet) and
her fiance Cal (Billy Zane),
but in truth, morally supe
rior. Cal is The Villain,
nothing more, nothing
less, assigned to sneer and
scowl without once pro
jecting any depth of feel
ing. Winslet and especially
DiCaprio rescue their
characters with charisma
and touching emotional
performances.
Frances Fisher is ab
solutely superb as Rose's
cold, ruthless mother and
Kathy Bates is a very funny
Molly Brown — far more
charming than the Debbie
Reynolds version of the
19605. The emotion is un
derscored and elaborated
by James Horner's poetic,
Gaelic-sounding score.
The haunting melodies add
emotional depth and sin
cerity to scenes that would
otherwise seem silly.
"Titanic" is a stunning,
powerful film, capable of
projecting monumental
tragedy, but in the end, this
movie, like it's namesake, is
a mechanical behemoth
without a heart.
