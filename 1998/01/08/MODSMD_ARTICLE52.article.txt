# Oscar & Lucinda
## 
### 
It's not often that a film set
in the Victorian British Empire
gets the chance to shy away
from traditional story lines of
the genre. Instead of relying on
a tale of class-consciousness or
repression, "Oscar and Luan
da," the new film by Gillian
Armstrong, shakes off the
same old concepts in favor of a
fresh and invigorating look at
two intriguing people and
their mutual fixation with
gambling, chance and faith.
Oscar and Lucinda are in
troduced as young children,
their lives progressing on simi
lar footing. Oscar (Ralph Fi
ennes) spends his youth with
his father, an evangelist who
thinks that pudding is evil.
Oscar asks God for direction
and tosses a stone over his
shoulder. When it lands on an
Anglican symbol, young Oscar
toddles off to follow God's will
and become a minister.
In Australia, Lucinda (Cate
Blanchett) grows up on a farm
under more straight-laced
parentage. Sporting pants
under her skirts, Lucinda is a
square peg in a country of
round holes.
Years later, a fidgety Oscar
enters Oxford and befriends
an avid gambler. Despite his
innocence in the ways of the

wager, Oscar is instantly
hooked. He rakes in thousands
of pounds and delivers them to
the poor.
Meanwhile, Lucinda inher
its the family fortune. She sails
to Sydney to start over, where
she impulsively purchases a
glass factory with the help of
her new friend, Reverend
Hallen (Ciaran Hinds). After
going to London to buy facto
ry equipment, Lucinda too de
velops a keen eye and hand for
bets.
Oscar and Lucinda finally
meet on a steamer bound for
Australia. Their friendship
grows fast and furiously, in be
tween games of poker. It is not
until Hallen leaves Lucinda's
side for the remote post of
Bellingen and Oscar's own
ministerial post is revoked that
the two realize gambling's ef
fect on their lives.
Although the two agree to
stop, Oscar proposes one final
hurrah — he bets he can deliv
er a glass church from Lucin
da's factory to Bellingen by
Good Friday. The stakes: the
loser's inheritance. The wager
invariably ties the two gam
blers emotionally together and
rips them apart.
The movie's power comes
from its deft examination of

two eccentric, lost souls who
need to put their faith and love
in something bigger than
themselves but smaller than
God. It is not enough that ei
ther character is independent
or genuine or sincere. It is only
together that each finds a wor
thy match.
Blanchett is perfect as Lu
cinda: innocent but not naive,
headstrong but not blindly ar
rogant Fiennes, a long way
from the dashing count in
"The English Patient," is
scrawny and awkward. At
times Fiennes over dramatizes
Oscar's personality, but for the
most part he is as gawkv and
goofy as a sensitive man of the
cloth needs to be.
Armstrong takes these two
fine actors' performances in
stride to present an eloquent
telling of the characters' lives.
As she showed with "Little
Women," Armstrong is gifted
at presenting subjects tenderly
and poignantly without reiv
ing on sentiment and melo
drama to bring an audience to
tears. "Oscar and Lucinda" is
such a film, with a story that
deserves our attention and two
characters who deserve our
contemplation.
