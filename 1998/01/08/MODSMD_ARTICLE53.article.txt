## Kubrick: Eyes on the Future 
### 
"Eyes Wide Shut." Somehow it
rings of storied director, producer
and screenwriter, Stanley Kubrick.
The film, which is slated to come out
next December, will be Kubrick's first
since "Full Metal Jacket,' his critically
acclaimed film of 1987 about Viet
nam. What are we to expect after this
10-year hiatus? What should we an
ticipate from this eccentric expatriate
whose work penetrates even the most
complacent minds with disturbing
force?
Black humor, perhaps? "Dr.
Strangelove," Kubrick's 1963 satirical
cold war drama, immediately comes
to mind. The film's subtitle "How I
Learned to Stop Worrying and Love
the Bomb" offers a flavor of what
Kubrick is attempting to accomplish,
but not until the concluding scenes
does the delicious absurdity and
comic perversity of Kubrick's art be
come fully realized.
Squirming in his wheelchair,
struggling with his rebellious right
arm and intermittently screaming
"Mien Fuhrer," Dr. Strangelove ex
plains to the U.S. president how
Americans might best survive the im
minent nuclear war.
In Strangelove's opinion, a select
group of individuals should live in
underground tunnels, ideally in a
ratio of one male to 10 females of a
"highly stimulating nature." After
hearing that they will qualify for this
select group, the president's testos
terone driven team of advisors quick
ly come to see the merits of
Strangelove's idea.
Can we expect more of the psy
chotic characters that have thrived
within Kubrick's spotlight? The list
seems unending: there is Jack Nichol
son as the crazed and maniacal father
in"The Shining;" Pvt. Leonard
(Gomer) Pyle of "Full Metal Jacket,"
whose innocuous, stupid grin be
comes the subtly disquieting smile of
a killer when he snaps under the regi
mented insanity of boot camp; Gen
eral Ripper, whose dementia and fixa
tion with "precious bodily fluids" in
"Dr. Strangelove" is both unnervingly
deranged and deeply comic; and even
Hal the computer in "2001: A Space
Odyssey" that, despite the meticulous
order of its circuitry, eventually cracks
and conjures its own methodical psy
chosis.
The ingenious and striking use of
music, particularly classical, seems a
staple of Kubrick films. For many, the
surging power of Beethoven's 9th
Symphony has been forever inter
twined with the potent and volatile
humanity of Kubrick's "A Clockwork
Orange."
Again, in "2001" Kubrick has re
vived and reanimated music from the
classical repertoire. Johann Strauss's
waltz "Blue Danube" seems to have
merged in meaning and spirit with
the celebrated space ballet of the
docking of the shuttle with the revolv-

ing, circular space
station. And the
five bold opening
notes of Richard
Strauss's "Thus
Spake Zarathustra"
have become insep
arable from the
sense of colossal ex
ploration that
frames the film.
Perhaps Kubrick
will find another
subtle use for what
must be his favorite
number: 114. It is
the name of the
fateful decoder in
"Dr. Strangelove"
that transmits Gen
eral Ripper's plan to
bomb the Russians;
it is the "license
plate number" of
the Jupiter explorer
in "2001"; and in
"Clockwork," when
Alex undergoes the
Ludovico treat
ment to cure his vi
olent tendencies, he
is given "Serum
114."
And then again,
maybe we are in
store for something
completely new
and unexpected.
With leading roles
in "Eyes Wide
Shut" given to pop
ular stars like Tom
Cruise and Nicole
Kidman, this seems
more than likely.
Kubrick's genius
has always re
mained fresh and
elusive. As Kubrick
reminds us in his
1956 film, "The
Killing," regardless
of how much one
might anticipate
and plan for an
event, life always
manages to be un
predictable. After
executing a labori
ously plotted heist
of a race track to
near perfection,
Kubrick's protago
nist watches his
suitcase of money
fall from a trans
porter at the airport
and spew tiny bills
into the windy
darkness. Perhaps it
is just this unpre
dictability that we
should expect from
"Eyes Wide Shut."
