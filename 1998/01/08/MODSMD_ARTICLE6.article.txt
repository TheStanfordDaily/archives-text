### Shalini Bhargava 
Don E. Fehrenbacher, Pulit/er
prize-winning emeritus professor of
history and American studies at Stan
lord. died at his home on December
13 of heart failure. He was 77.
Fehrenbacher is remembered by
colleagues as the preeminent scholar
on President Lincoln and a dedicated
historian. "[Fehrenbacher] was the
finest Lincoln scholar of his genera
tion," said History Prof. George
Fredrickson.
"11c was a very careful and erudite
scholar," said History Prof. Emeritus
Carl Degler. "He worked not to glo
rify Lincoln, but to understand him.
He understood Lincoln, his complex
ities and his deficiencies." Degler
said.
Degler cited modesty as one of
Fehrenbacher's salient attributes.
"He did his work, but was never one
to push himself to prominence." he
said.
Fehrenbacher won the
Pulit/er Prize in history for his book
"The Dred Scott Case: Its Signifi
cance in American Law and Politics."
Fredrickson said the book was"the

definitive book on the (Dred Scott]
case" and the case's significance in
American legal and constitutional
history.
According to Degler. the title of
the book typifies Fehrenbacher's
modesty. "It typifies [Fehrenbacher]
to do this massive Nx*k and then have
a specific title" that only hints at what
is inside. Degler said.
Fehrenbacher also wrote a book
covering Lincoln's life prior to his
presidency, "Prelude to Greatness:
Lincoln in the 1850s." During a 12-
year period. Fehrenbacher and his
wife Virginia completed a book of
quotations attributed to I mcoln
"[One of Fehrenbacher's] most
important works v\as an attempt to
find out the truth about some 1,500
quotes about Lincoln, statements
made b\ Lincoln's contemporaries."
Degler said.
Degler characterized his col
league as a loyal member of the Stan
ford community. "He was loyal to
Stanford; he participated as a scholar
and w as also part of the university sys
tem He spoke at the [University's]
centennial." Degler said.
Fehrenbacher is remembered bv

colleagues not only as an outstanding
scholar, hut also as a fine teacher.
"(Fehrenbacherj was an effective
teacher â€”he was a careful lecturer.
He had a gixxl sense of humor." De
aler said.
Fredrickson recalled that Fehren
bacher used to give students an un
graded tesi on presidential trivia, in
cluding fill-in-the-blank and true-or
false questions. The student with the
highest score was traditionally award
ed a cash prize. "He used to have
some fun [with his classes). He was a
dedicated teacher." Fredrickson said.
Degler called Fehrenbacher "in
defatigible," noting his dedication to
research and writing in spite of a
worsening heart condition. "He was
working in his library the day before
he died. (His condition] didn't de
press him. but it slowed him down."
Degler said.
Fehrenbachers honors also lasted
to the end ol his life, including his re
ceiving last year the annual Lincoln
Prize, the highest honor lor Civil War
studies.
With Fehrenbacher s death. De
gler said, "there is an empty place in
American historv."
