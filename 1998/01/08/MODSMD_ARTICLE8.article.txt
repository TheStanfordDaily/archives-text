# Dialogue sessions on race to be held
## 
### Ann Kim Contributing writer 
As part of the Stanford Dialogue
on Race and Ethnicity, students will
have the opportunity this quarter to
engage in weekly small-group dis
cussions with trained facilitators,
addressing pertinent issues such as
affirmative action and bilingual ed
ucation.
The sessions, which begin next
week, are being coordinated by
Multicultural Educator Tommy
Woon and West Lagunita Resident
Fellow Stewart Burns.
More than 1 (K) students are ex
pected to participate, said Burns,
and will meet in groups of 15 in
campus residences. "We've gotten
a phenomenal response so far from
both students and the residence
staff," he said.
"We're really emphasizing the
need for constructive listening so

students can see what they can gain
from each other's views. Even if you
are totally opposed to an opinion,
there's always something you can
learn from somebody no matter
how different you think they are,"
Burns said.
A 15-student discussion group
met for six weeks last quarter in
Lagunita as a prototype for this
quarter's campus-wide dialogues.
The group began its series of dis
cussions by sharing personal experi
ences with racial or ethnic identity
and discrimination. Later discus
sions examined affirmative action,
immigration and bilingual educa
tion.
"Students got a sense of the com
plexity of racial issues, and a sense
of breaking down stereotypes," said
Burns. The discussions also ad
dressed class differences, he said, as
the students realized that "you can't
talk about race without talking

about class" and vice versa.
In addition to facilitating open
discussion, a goal of the dialogues is
to explore, by the end of the acade
mic year, potential solutions to
racial problems. "We hope the
groups will actually start trying to
look for actions and solutions that
can be used to address various is
sues," said Burns.
These proposed solutions will be
sent to President Clinton and an ad
visory panel he created, which is
overseeing the national dialogue on
race issues that he called for last
June.
"We have a rare opportunity this
year to participate in a dialogue that
the country is trying to have,"
Woon said.
The student dialogues are one
example of Stanford's response to
Clinton's call for open discussion.
In addition, lunchtime discussion
groups are being organized for cam-

pus staff members.
The Center for Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity is also
promoting similar discussions. It
has organized the California
Summit on Race in America, a day
long series of panel sessions sched
uled for Jan. 30.
The event will bring together
academics, public policy analysts,
elected and appointed government
officials, and nonprofit organiza
tion leaders. These panelists will
discuss such issues as immigration,
bilingual education and affirma
tive action.
"Our goal is to extend discussion
beyond the campus by inviting
members of the public at large,"
said Elisa Nino-Murcia, program
coordinator for the center. "We
want Stanford to be a leader in the
dialogue on race and ethnicity, and
we're expecting a tremendous re
sponse."
