### Jaime Adame Contributing writer 
Joseph Ballam, professor emeri
tus and former head of the research
division at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator. died Dec. 14 at his on cam
pus home due to emphysema-related
complications. He was SI) years old.
Ballam founded the center's
famed laboratories and helped shape
their course for 26 years. Under Bal
lam's guidance, the center produced
three Nobel Laureates.
Wolfgang Panofsky, emeritus di
rector of the center, also praised Bal

lam's work in developing technology
that helped increase SLAC's visibili
ty in the scientific community.
Raised in New York City, Ballam
received a bachelor's in physics in
1939 from the University of Michi
gan. He worked for the Navy's Bu
reau of Ships during World War 11
and in 1951 earned his doctorate
from UC-Berkeley for his research
on cosmic rays.
While at UC-Berkeley, Ballam
met Panofsky, who would later be
come director of SLAC. Ballam
went on to do research investigating
the nature of fundamental particles

at Princeton and the Brookhaven
National Laboratory. Following a
period at Michigan State University,
Ballam was recruited by Panofsky to
join SLAC and did so in 1961.
During Ballam's distinguished ca
reer. he received a Guggenheim Fel
lowship and was a visiting scholar at
several universities in the U.S. and
Europe. He also served on commit
tees for the Energy Department, in
cluding the High Energy Physics Ad
visory Board.
In 1982 Ballam stepped down
from his position as head of research
and retired as a professor in 1957. He

remained active in his field, however,
serving as an adviser to SLAC.
David Leith, associate director of
research at SLAC, was recruited by
Ballam in 1466 and remembered him
fondly.
"His enthusiasm for science,
physics, new ideas and young people
were legendary," said Leith. "He will
be missed greatly."
A memorial service will be held
Saturday at 9:30 a.m. at SLAC Audi
torium. Services will include the un
veiling of a plaque in Balkan's honor
as well as the dedication of an oak
tree to be planted in his memory.
