SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)
Theodore Kaezynski apparent
ly tried to hang himself with his
undershorts in his cell, then agreed
in court yesterday to undergo psy
chological tests to prove he is com
petent to represent himself in the
Unabomber trial.
Undersheriff I.ou Blanas said
marshals noticed Kaezynski was
not wearing underpants when he
changed in the courthouse yester
day morning from his prison
jumpsuit to the street clothes he
has been wearing in court.
Kaczynski's cell was searched
and no underwear turned up.
Blanas said. "We assume they
were Hushed down the toilet." he
said. Courtroom observers said
red marks were visible on Kaczyn
ski's neck.
Blanas said Kaezynski had
recently seemed depressed

apparently over his lawyers' plans
to portray him as mentally ill
but Blanas said he had been a
model prisoner during the past IK
months of confinement.
Blanas said the suicide
attempt "could have taken place
in a matter of a few minutes "
Now Kaezynski will be placed on
a 24-hour suicide watch and will
have to wear a heart monitor, he
said.
Defense lawyers refused
immediate comment. It was not
known whether the attorneys or
U.S. District Judge Garland Bur
rell Jr. knew about the incident
before the chaotic hearing yester
day in which Kaezynski asked to
represent himself and agreed to
undergo psychological tests.
Kaczynski's change of mind
threw the trial into disarray for
the second time this week.
