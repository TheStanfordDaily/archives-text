# Study suggests new benefits to Tylenol

LONDON (AP) — A study rais
es the possibility that the common
painkiller acetaminophen, sold as
Tylenol and other brands, lowers
women's risk of ovarian cancer.
The U.S. researchers who pub
lished their findings this week in the
British medical journal The Lancet
said more research was needed to
determine whether there really is a
protective effect and if so how it
works.
"This being the first report of
lhis association, one would have to
be very, very cautious," said Dr.
Daniel Cramer of Boston's
Brigham and Women's Hospital,
who conducted the research with

* The-researchers studied the use
of over-the-counter painkillers in

563 women from eastern Mas
sachusetts and New Hampshire
who had ovarian cancer and 523
healthy women selected from the
general population.
The researchers found that K.B
percent of women from the general
population used acetaminophen,
compared with 4.6 percent of
women with ovarian cancer.
This indicated the risk of ovarian
cancer was reduced by half for
acetaminophen users.
The researchers also found that
women who took aspirin had a 25
percent lower incidence of ovarian
cancer, but said this difference was
not large enough to he statistically

Cramer said the study was the
first on the effect of acetaminophen

on ovarian cancer in humans and the
figures "jumped right out" of data
the research team is still analyzing.
Earlier studies done in North
Carolina on mice and rats indicated
acetaminophen shrunk healthy
ovarian tissues, he said.
Cramer said he hoped the latest
study would prompt other
researchers to check whether they
had data on acetaminophen and
ovarian cancer, perhaps collected
during another study. II there is a
