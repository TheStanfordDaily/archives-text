Chicken flu analyzed
ATLANTA (AP) — II.S. health
officials said yesterday they are increas
ingly confident that the chicken flu that
has sickened 16 people and killed four
in Hong Kong is not spreading from
person to person.
"Some of our guesses are getting
confirmed." said Dr. Rima Khabazz, a
viral disease expert at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. "But
things may change and we still cannot
rule out human-to-human transmis
sion."
Test results from the first seven peo
ple stricken with the A 115N1 virus
found at least two different strains of the
virus — a sign that each victim contract
ed the virus not from another person
hut from a chicken, Ms. Khabazz said.
"If you look at seven people and they
all had the same exact virus, that would
suggest that there was person-to-person
transmission," she said. "The tact that
we are seeing more than one strength

ens the conclusion that primarily what is
happening.. .is transmission from poul
try to people."
The CDC also said there is a low rate
of bird 11 u among family members and
others who have had contact with the
sick. And no new cases have been
reported since Dec. 2<S — the same day
that Hong Kong officials began a
slaughter of chickens.
The CDC said it still can't rule out
the possibility of person-to-person
transmission because of at least two
troubling cases:
—A health worker was infected with
the tin after caring for the first victim, a
3-year-old boy who died. The worker
had not been exposed to the virus in her
lab and had not had any contact with
chickens.
—A classmate of that boy was also
diagnosed with the flu. The youngster
had had contact with the boy, but was
also exposed to the same ill chickens
that are believed to have made the boy
sick.

U.N. to assist North Korea
UNITED NATIONS (AP) —North
Korea's food crisis has worsened to the
point that all of the country's children
now are considered at risk of suffering
malnutrition, a U.N. official said yestei
day.
The food shortage is being com
pounded by a lack of adequate heating
during the bitter Korea's winter and the
collapse of North Korea's health care
system, said Douglas t'outts. chief I .N.
humanitarian coordinator for North
Korea.
To combat the problem, U.N. agen
cies were setting up a nationu ide school
lunch program to provide food for all
North Korean children under 12 years
of age. said C'outts. a Canadian who has
been based in North Korea since
September.
This is in addition to a program to
feed younger children in state-run nurs
eries and day-care centers, he said.
"We're also going to be providing a

much broader ration scale to all these
children as it's very clear they are not
receiving anywhere near the amount of
food thev need to be getting at home in
order to sustain their health." Coutts
added.
On Tuesday, the li.N. World Food
Program appealed for more than $378
million to feed nearlv a third of North
Korea's people and avert a "humanitar
ian catastrophe."
It is the biggest emergency operation
in the World Food Program's 35-year
history Coutts said the new programs
will increase the number of North Kore
ans receiving U.N. assistance from 4."
million to 7.5 million in a nation of 24.3
million people.
U.N. experts estimate the country
needs more than 1 million tons of food
aid this year to avert a famine. North
Korea has suffered three years of devas
tating weather conditions, which have
caused severe problems for the ineffi
cient. communist-style agricultural sys
tem.
