JERUSALEM (AIM Trying to appease both his
hard-line coalition partners and President Clinton.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared yester
day he would decide the size of a West Hank troop pull
back before he meets Clinton in two weeks — but
won't carry it out for several months.
The decision to start the withdrawal will be made
only after Israel determines whether the Palestinians
are carrying out their obligations, the prime minister
told political leaders in his coalition government.
"There will be one decision in the near future and
then after we have checked the reciprocity, there will
be a decision on carrying it out," said Transportation
Minister Yitzhak Levy of the right-wing National Reli
gious Party, which opposes giving up land to the Pales
tinians.
Israel's Army Radio said Netanyahu told the party
heads he would establish a monitoring committee to
evaluate the Palestinians' compliance with their com
mitments and promised to get Cabinet approval before
carrying out the withdrawal.
That makes a decision on the withdrawal's scope
palatable to hard-liners by leaving open the possibility
it will never take place.
Levy said it would be difficult for his party to stay in
the government when troops actually withdrew, but
stopped short of threatening to bring down the govern

ment.
"We'll see how the Palestinians are carrying out all
their commitments — and then we'll talk." he said.
Netanyahu has little maneuvering room following
the resignation this week of 112 oreign Minister David
Levy, no relation to Yit/hak and a key moderate in his
coalition. Levy's resignation reduced the coalition's
majority in the 120-member Parliament from to a
minimal 61 seats.
But Netanyahu also faces pressure from coalition
centrists who want a pullback that will satisfy both the
Palestinians and the United States.
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. anoth
er supporter of the peace process, said Wednesday that
he too would resign if there were no pullback within
three months.
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the
Palestinians fear Netanyahu is using his internal politi
cal crisis to justify "more settlements and more land
confiscation" in the West Bank.
"It's really time for the American administration to
stop Mr. Netanyahu before it is too late." he said.
Clinton is to meet Netanyahu on Jan. TO and Pales
tinian leader Yasser Arafat two days later. ( linton s
Mideast envoy. Dennis Ross, has been meeting sepa
rately with the two this week to try to bring them clos
er to agreement before they go to the \N lute House.
