## Indonesian currency hits all time low 
### 
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)
1 he Indonesian rupiah sank to an
all-time low yesterday, losing a
quarter of its value in a single day
and sending thousands ol panicked
residents to supermarkets where
they snapped up everything in sight.
Ignoring an army appeal for
calm in the world's fourth most
populous nation. Indonesians lined
up more than 20-deep at cash regis
ters to buy sugar, rice, cooking oil
and whatever else they could grab
before yet another price rise.
The rupiah's dive apparently was
driven by fears that the Internation
al Monetary Fund will vank back a
bailout package extended late last
year when Asian economies began
falling like dominoes. The IMF is
losing patience with Indonesia's
failure to implement reform mea
sures that were required for the $40
billion in rescue money.
Financial analysts warned that
the rupiah's dreadful performance,
compounded yesterday by a record
tumble on the stock market, could
leave many companies unable to
pay the interest on their foreign
currency debts, thus forcing them
into bankruptcy.
While President Suharto has yet
to face a credible opposition in his
30-year reign, the prospect of social
unrest triggered by inflation and
unemployment is looming. The
army has pledged to back Suharto
in the event of widespread tumult.
For half a year. Indonesians have
remained calm as their currency has
continued to slide. They have main
tained faith that the 76-year-old
president would revive the econo
my in the same way he built it up
years ago.
But their confidence plunged
yesterday — along with the rupiah.
which fell 26 percent. The dramatic
one-dav drop leaves the rupiah

down 76 percent since the country's
July currency depreciation.
Thousands of people dashed to
stores and picked the shelves clean.
"I only wish I could buy more. Who
knows what is going to happen?"
said one woman as she and her fam
ily pushed five shopping carts of
groceries.
To calm rattled nerves, state
owned television flashed pictures of
a national rice stockpile, and quoted
officials saying the nation's food
supplies remained plentiful —
despite the need to import rice
because of prolonged drought.

record 10.550 rupiah to the I S.

noon a record drop of 19 percent.
Spooked by the rupiah's sharp
fall, stock markets across Southeast
Asia plunged yesterday. Singapore
shares hit a 5 1/2-year low and
