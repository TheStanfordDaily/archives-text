MOSCOW (AIM Iwo Rus
sian cosmonauts suited up and
stepped out into space early today
on a mission to determine why the
exit hatch on the Mir space station
has been losing pressure.
In the first hour of the space
walk. the cosmonauts reported that
the hatch's main clamp appeared
not to have been fully closed, pos
sibly making the problem easier to
tix than anticipated. Mission Con
trol spokesman Valery I yndin
said.
American crewmate David Wolf
filmed the movements of the two
experienced spacewalkers from
inside the station.
I"he hatch on the Mir's Kvant-2
module failed to close properly
after a spaccwalk in November, but
the partial loss of pressure has only
affected k\ant's docking chamber.

the station.
However, it hits forced the crew
to use .1 smaller adjacent compart

Before the mission, estimated to
take six hours, space officials
thought the hatch might he in need

During the spacewalk. cosmo
nauts Anatoly Solovyov and Pavel
Vinogradov also planned to retrieve
a U.S. experiment â€” a package of
materials attached to the outside of
the station in April to see how they
endure space conditions.
On the crew's next spacewalk,
set for Wednesday. Solovyov and
Wolf will gather more U.S. scientif
ic experiments

Solovyov is the most experi
enced space walker in history, log
ging more than 70 hours in open
space on his previous 14 space
walks. five of which came during his
current Mir mission, starting in
August.
He and Vinogradov, w ho accom
panied him on four spacewalks.

Mir. the world's longest-flying
space outpost, will mark its 12th
anniversary in orbit next month,
although it only had been expected
to last for five years.
Despite continuing computer
breakdowns, the latest of which

relatively quiet in recent months
after a steady string of accidents
earlier last vear.
