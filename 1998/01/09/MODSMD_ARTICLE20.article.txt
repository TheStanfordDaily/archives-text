## Editorial Notebook Finding your passion 
### 
A PROFESSOR OF mine once said.
"Don't let your academics stand in
the way of your education." In
1989.1 came to Stanford to pursue an elec
trical engineering degree thinking all that
mattered was homework, tests and grades.
But in the process, I learned far more
about life than I expected to learn. Here
are some of the unanticipated lessons that
my education has included over the last
nine years:
• Stanford University is a business and not
simply an oasis of pure, unadulterated
learning. Politics are very important — in
virtually every office and department. Use
these facts and you will find success both
here and in the real world.
• Don't sweat the small stuff — and it is all
small stuff. Maybe the ASSU Senate or the
Faculty Senate could learn a thing or two
from this old cliche.
• Treat secretaries like presidents and
presidents like friends — everyone
deserves respect and most people feel lone
ly on a pedestal. You will be amazed at the
returns you receive.
• As the joke goes, it's not your research
topic, but your thesis adviser that deter
mines if and when you will graduate. To
determine your true completion date for
your thesis, always multiply your projected
time to completion by 2.5.
• Take one of the dance division's dance
classes. No matter which one you choose,
you will learn poise, rhythm and a joy of
movement that no homework set can
match. Out of all the programs at Stanford,
it is the one in which you will continue to
appreciate long after you graduate. And
don't fret if you aren't completely profi
cient after a month, a quarter or even a
vear. It took vou a whole vear to learn how

to walk — and you worked on that day
alter day.
• Get uncomfortable and walk in another
person's shoes. Check out a new social
event put on by another ethnic group.
Learn about another culture other than
your own. You might feel like you don't
belong, hut learn from the experience and
you will grow as a person.
• Realize that life is about relationships.
Relationships aren't just boyfriend / girl
friend or husband / wife, they also include
student / adviser, employee / employer,
company / partner. Cherish respect
each and every of them.
• Your biggest accomplishment at Stan
ford will more than likely be the smallest
act you perform — a hug. a heart-to-heart
or a helping hand — at the time you least
expect it. Practice helping make the world a
better place, one small act at a time.
• Reality is your own self-perception. Be
proactive, take a chance and make your
own reality. People react to you and if you
change, you will be amazed at how your
world will too — and often for the better.
• Fie true to yourself. Your greatest satis
faction will come from being who you are
and growing from it. You might gain suc
cess by emulating others, but seldom will
you find true happiness and satisfaction.
• Learn from your heroes — they are
often humble people who rose from obscu
rity (or graduate school) to make a differ
ence in the world. They were not the ones
who set out to be great — they were people
who simply followed their passions and suc
cess found them.
Find your passion, know your values, be
yourself and live with love — the rest will
follow.
