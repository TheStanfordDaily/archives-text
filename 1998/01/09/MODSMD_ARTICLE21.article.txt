## Not exactly viva Las Vegas 
### 
NFW YEAR'S Eve
found me standing
on the floor of a
Las Vegas casino counting
down the year's final sec
onds with my wonderful
girlfriend (awww yeah!)
and hundreds of people I
didn't know. The sound of

slot machines paying off (for everyone but
me, it seemed) was momentarily over
whelmed by the popping of balloons, their
gentle fall from the ceiling rudely interrupt
ed by revelers' stomping feet.
Never having desired to destroy a bal
loon. but surrounded as I was by this rau
cous massacre, 1 felt compelled to join in.
After happily picking up a balloon and
crushing it with my bare hands, I was struck
by the realization that this unruly mass of
people, whom I had ridiculed all night for
their primitiveness, had managed to influ
ence my behavior.
There in Las Vegas, apparently a mecca
for young people like ourselves wishing to
usher in the new year, the best and worst of
America was on display. I'his tiny micro
cosm of society left me mostly in disgust
with my fellow members of the human race.
I don't understand why people celebrate
the arrival of the new year at all. Perhaps it's
the psychological boost of starting the year
with a clean slate, so you can forget the tri
als and tribulations of past years and finally

lose that weight, or get that raise or forget
about the girl or guy who screwed you over
however many months back. But if that's
the case, then why (Jo so many people do
their best to ensure they wake up on New
Year's Day with a huge hangover and faint
memories of things they should be embar
rassed about?
For New Year's Eve, the streets on the
Strip (a very appropriate name, actually),
were closed to traffic so that the throngs of
people could stumble around and pass out
without fear of being hit by cars. Littering
the streets were pictures of scantily clad or
naked women from discarded "personal
ads" that could be picked up for free from
any of a number of street corners (not that
I was looking). Also littering the streets,
quite literally, were people. One could not
walk more than a couple of l'eet in any given
direction without running into two feet tall
plastic beer containers (compliments of
Budweiser), broken glass, splashes of
phlegm, paper cups, cigarettes or various
unidentifiable liquids.
Wolf packs of "men." which is stretching
the definition, hooted and hollered at
groups of young women who more often
than not were minors whose excess makeup
was balanced by a lack of clothing. A couple
of people even walked around with their
giant bongs clearly visible.
And, amusingly enough, as Kristine and
I walked into Caesar's Palace, a verv young

couple felt compelled to turn around and
tell us they had just been married... and
were going to have sex all night long.
But my cynicism as 1 observed these
events was coupled with fascination, that
maybe without the drugs and alcohol and
cigarette smoking, a society like this would
in some ways be an improvement. Though
racial segregation within the crowds was
quite obvious, it didn't stop people from
shouting a joyous "Happy New Year!" to
anyone and everyone they didn't know. As
we walked back to the hotel, a young man
walking my way gave me a high five along
with a "Happy New Year, homey!" On how
many other days of the year would he have
said that to me, a total stranger? In how
many other situations would I have been his
homey? It made me smile.
Certainly I'm not saying that the catalyst
for bringing us as an American people
together is drug abuse. However, the experi
ence has offered me some hope that the var
ious paradigms in which we live aren't static.
How strange that sueh optimism for
humanity should originate from a bunch of
drunks on New Year's Eve in Las Vegas,
while my faith in much of the Stanford stu
dent population has nearly disappeared.
