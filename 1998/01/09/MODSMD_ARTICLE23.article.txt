Stanford Fund vital
to school's welfare
As a student volunteer for The Stan
lord Fund. I would like to respond to Eric
Bauer's Jan. 7 column, "The Farm's
fundraising follies." Bauer's question "If
Stanford can't operate without heavy
donations, then isn't there something fun
damentally wrong with the economics of
Stanford. Inc.?" is a fair question. But
Stanford, like almost every other private
university in the country, depends on
alumni giving for a number of reasons. As
students, we are all acutely aware (if the
rising costs of tuition, hut what about the
rising costs of education? While it may be
hard to believe, tuition at most universi
ties does not cover 100 percent of educa
tion costs. Tuition at Stanford, in fact, cov
ers only 60 percent.
The Stanford Fund serves to raise
annual financial support for undergradu

ate education and student life. At least 60
percent of the funds raised each year are
allocated for undergraduate scholarships.
More than 6(H) undergraduate students
received scholarship support from The
Stanford Fund this past year. The other 40
percent of the funds are alh)cated for
undergraduate teaching and special initia
tives. Fast year, the deans in the schools of
Humanities and Sciences. Fngineering
and Earth Sciences received funds from
The Stanford 112 und for undergraduate
teaching in their respective schools and
programs.
The Stanford Fund also provided the
initial feed funding for the Freshman Sem
inars Program. Now. in only its second
year, the Freshman Seminars Program has
expanded to offer more than 60 different
courses. The Stanford Fund also strives to
enrich student life. Club sports, a cappella
groups and even the bowling team all have
the opportunity to raise money for their
organizations through the Student Part
nership. which is funded by Stanford Fund
dollars. By also allocating funds to support

the ethnic community centers, The Stan
ford Fund serves to help heighten cultural
awareness and diversity within our stu
dent body.
Why am I advocating for The Stanford
Fund? Because I know that without dona
tions from Stanford alumni, many of the
opportunities that have been available to
me, past and present, would not exist, many
of the fine professors that teach our classes
would have been lured away by other uni
versities long ago and many of the unique
organizations that characterize Stanford life
would not have necessary funding.
For most students, our decision to
come to Stanford was based on the high
quality of learning, teaching and student
life, as well as the myriad of opportunities
and organizations available to us at Stan
ford. We. as students, may not think of
The Stanford Fund and development on a
daily basis. Behind the scenes, however,
they are both integral parts of our every
day routine. Although Lcland Stanford
opened our University, and Jane Stanford
sold her jewels to keep the school open

after he died, it it was Stanford alumni
who keep the legacy of our exceptional
University alive through their generous
financial gifts.

Daily article presents
sexist perspective
There's an article in the Stanford Daily
on Jan. 7 titled, "Prosecutor hired as judi
cial officer," which was written by a man.
"She's dynamic and energetic, which
definitely allow her to cope with the posi
tion's long-hour commitment," he (Marc
Wais) said.
We'll say the person is Samuel Mak,
not Suzanna Mak.
"Samuel Mak is dynamic and energetic,
which definitely allows him to cope with

the position's long-hour commitment," he
said. I think not.
Suzanna is a YOUNG woman with an
impressive background and professional
career. Of course, she's energetic and
dynamic. It's unlikely this description
would he written about Samuel, and it
would be taken for granted he's able to
work long hours.
"We're DELIGHTED to have some
one of Su/anna's caliber to fill this posi
tion," said Wais.
"We're DELIGHTED to have some
one of Samuel's caliber to fill this."
Now, isn't that special.
"Su/anna's a WONDERFUL addition
to the office of Judicial Affairs." (Senior
Howard Loo)
"Sam's a WONDERFUL addition to
the office, ctc."
It's possible that a woman writer, writ
ing about a woman would fall into the
same trap. Interesting to speculate.
