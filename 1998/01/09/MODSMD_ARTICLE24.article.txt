## Looking for three straight in '98 Cardinal faces Cal at Kaiser tonight 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
California freshman Masa
Radovic caught her coach's eye pret
ty early this season.
Head coach Marianne Stanley no
ticed that Radovic's court skills stood
out and approached the 6-foot-1
guard from Belgrade, Yugoslavia
about running the point. What Stan
ley discovered was that Radovic had
never played the point guard position
in her life.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ TONIGHT: No. 14 Stanford (5-4.
2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) at Cali
fornia (5-7,1-1), 7:30 p.m. TV: None.
RADIO: KZSU-FM (90.1), KB PA
(1220 AM)

But since that conversation
Radovic has found herself playing
point guard quite frequently, and she
now headlines a freshman class that's
making a fast impact on the Golden
Bear squad. Radovic leads the team
with 11 points per game, including 16
points to go along with a career-high
10 assists last weekend against Ore
gon State.
In addition to Radovic, Stanley
has added four other freshman to
bolster a Cal squad that only won two
conference games all last season.
This year at 5-7 overall, the Bears are
just one win shy of their entire total
for last season, and a 1-1 Pacific 10
Conference start should also help Cal
top its 2-16 conference mark for the
1996-97 season.
If live Bears somehow pull off the
upset victory in tonight's game, they
would match their entire win total for
last season. The contest starts at 7:30
p.m. and is being held at the Kaiser

Arena in downtown Oakland as
Cal's 1 larmon Gym is being renovat
ed this season.
"I expect them to be really com
petitive," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "More than any
thing, they're athletic and that could
hurt us if we don't take care of the
ball. I think you'll see a great effort
out there tonight. I don't care if
you're playing Cal at tiddly-winks,
it's still a rivalry."
But Stanford has been taking care
of the ball lately, and Cal will likely
have a difficult time stopping the
14th-ranked Cardinal. Stanford (5-4,
2-0) is riding a three-game win streak,
its longest of the season, and looks to
stretch its number of consecutive
Pac-1() wins to 4K.
The Card has shown marked im
provement over its last three games,
outscoring opponents by an average
of 22 points (compared to just 1.4 in
its first six). Stanford has also hit the
boards, outrebounding the competi
tion by 16.7 boards per game versus
previously being outrebounded by
one.
A big reason for the change is the
return of senior forward Kristin Folkl
from the national championship vol
leyball team. In three games Folkl is
averaging 14.7 points and eight re
bounds (third and second on the
squad, respectively) in little more
than 22 minutes of play.
"Kristin definitely gives them a
different look," Stanley said. "The
bottom line is they're coming off two
good games and they're starting to
settle down. Folkl's skills transcend
problems an average player would
have coming back. I mean, there's
nothing average about Kristin."
But more than her individual per
formance. Folkl adds the kind of
depth the team was lacking prior to
her return. Senior center Olympia
Scott has definitely benefited from
Folkl's return.
Following Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors for her performance
against Illinois in December, Scott
has been phenomenal. Scott set a
new career-high with 33 points
against Colorado and then opened
the Pac-10 schedule by posting 43
points and 24 rebounds (including a
career-high lagainst Oregon) in
two games. Scott's team-leading 20.1
points and <S.e» rebounds per game is
good for fourth and third, respective
ly. in the Pac-10.
"The thing about Olympia is that
she's a competitor," said Van-
Derveer. "She finishes well, and she
rebounds well. Now she's just more
consistent. She's able to relax and

play a lot more with Kristin hack in
the lineup."
The other much-improved area of
the Cardinal's game is the guard play.
Sophomore guards Milena Mores
and Melody Peterson have stepped
up their play, and the Cardinal is also
getting more production off the
bench.
Against the Oregon schools. Mo
res posted 25 points and IS assists, in
cluding the second double-double of
her career against Oregon (10 points,
11 assists). Floresistopsinthe Pac-10
with 6.89 assists per game, a total that
ranks her ninth in the nation. Peter
sun contributed 13 points and five as
sists against the Ducks.
"I think the guard situation on
our team is definitely improving,"
said senior forward Vanessa Ny
gaard. "We've seen improved play
from Melody Peterson. Milena
Flores, Christina Batastini —
they've all stepped up. They've
taken a bigger role and have ma
tured as players."

Senior forward Heather Owen and the rest of the Cardinal have not
been caught sitting down lately, having rattled off three straight vic
tories.
