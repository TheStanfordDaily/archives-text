## Looking for three straight in '98 Cardinal faces Cal at Kaiser tonight 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
California freshman Masa
Radovic caught her coach's eye pret
ty early this season.
Head coach Marianne Stanley no
ticed that Radovic's court skills stood
out and approached the 6-foot-1
guard from Belgrade, Yugoslavia
about running the point. What Stan
ley discovered was that Radovic had
never played the point guard position
in her life.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
â–  TONIGHT: No. 14 Stanford (5-4.
2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) at Cali
fornia (5-7,1-1), 7:30 p.m. TV: None.

But since that conversation
Radovic has found herself playing
point guard quite frequently, and she
now headlines a freshman class that's
making a fast impact on the Golden
Bear squad. Radovic leads the team
with 11 points per game, including 16
points to go along with a career-high
10 assists last weekend against Ore
gon State.
In addition to Radovic, Stanley
has added four other freshman to
bolster a Cal squad that only won two
conference games all last season.
This year at 5-7 overall, the Bears are
just one win shy of their entire total
for last season, and a 1-1 Pacific 10
Conference start should also help Cal
top its 2-16 conference mark for the
1996-97 season.
If live Bears somehow pull off the
upset victory in tonight's game, they
would match their entire win total for
last season. The contest starts at 7:30
p.m. and is being held at the Kaiser

Arena in downtown Oakland as
Cal's 1 larmon Gym is being renovat
ed this season.
"I expect them to be really com
petitive," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "More than any
thing, they're athletic and that could
hurt us if we don't take care of the
ball. I think you'll see a great effort
out there tonight. I don't care if
you're playing Cal at tiddly-winks,
it's still a rivalry."
But Stanford has been taking care
of the ball lately, and Cal will likely
have a difficult time stopping the
14th-ranked Cardinal. Stanford (5-4,
2-0) is riding a three-game win streak,
its longest of the season, and looks to
stretch its number of consecutive
Pac-1() wins to 4K.
The Card has shown marked im
provement over its last three games,
outscoring opponents by an average
of 22 points (compared to just 1.4 in
its first six). Stanford has also hit the
boards, outrebounding the competi
tion by 16.7 boards per game versus
previously being outrebounded by
one.
A big reason for the change is the
return of senior forward Kristin Folkl
from the national championship vol
leyball team. In three games Folkl is
averaging 14.7 points and eight re
bounds (third and second on the
squad, respectively) in little more
than 22 minutes of play.
"Kristin definitely gives them a
different look," Stanley said. "The
bottom line is they're coming off two
good games and they're starting to
settle down. Folkl's skills transcend
problems an average player would
have coming back. I mean, there's
nothing average about Kristin."
But more than her individual per
