The Stanford wrestling team travels to UC
Davis this weekend for the Aggie Open. As the
name implies, the tournament is open to all
wrestlers above high school age, and as such, al
lows even redshirts to compete.

WRESTLING
■ SATURDAY: Aggie Open at UC-Davis.

While not one of the biggest tournaments
on the team's schedule, the Open serves as a
valuable opportunity to develop depth. Be
cause the Open allows multiple entrants at
each weight class, backups can get valuable
tournament experience without taking a slot
away from starters. As a result, Stanford will
send over thirty wrestlers to Davis.
"It's great for someone like me, because I
can face competition outside the team." said
redshirt freshman Zack Shulz. "1 don't get
many opportunities to do that."

The team enters into the Open at a cross
roads; winless in their first five dual meets, they
can only view the Open as an opportunity to
turn the season around.
Fortunately, it would seem that momentum
is on the Cardinal's side. Senior co-captain Jeff
Grant wrestled his finest match of the year
Wednesday against Penn All-American Bran
don Slay, and may be on his way to the season
he is capable of. Though Grant's knee injury in
the Penn meet prevented him from practicing
yesterday and will therefore bar him from com
petition this weekend, he may return as early as
next Saturday's home meet against Oregon
State.
"Jeff s match against Penn shows what he's
capable of." said teammate Kayvon Bina. who
will wrestle at Davis. "If he keeps that up.
there's no stopping him."
Junior B.J. Sanchez enters the Open on a
hot streak, leading the team with ten wins. His
victory Wednesday only continued his break
out season. Also hot is Zach Z.immerer, who
has won four of his last five matches, two on
pins.
