# Saturday night's all right for records
## No. 7 Cardinal look to tie best start ever in Pac-10 home opener 
### Gil Lopez Editorial staff 
Sixty-one years ago, the Stanford Indi
ans amazed the eountry with their up
tempo basketball style and set a school
record with 14 victories to begin the sea
son. a mark which remains untouched.
How things have changed.
This year's No. 7 Cardinal squad (13-0,
2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) has slowly
grinded down 13 straight opponents with
their smothering defense and deliberate
halfcourt offense, and threaten to tie the
program's oldest record with a victory in
tomorrow's conference home opener
against California (5-5,1-2).

The Cardinal could end up killing two
birds with one stone. A win tomorrow
would he the team's 18th consecutive at
Maples, tying another school record set in
1989-90.
But something more important than
records is at stake for the Cardinal. The
team wants to set the tone for the season
and let the rest of the conference know
that it will he every bit as dominant at
home as it was last year when it swept the
league.
"I don't think we're thinking about the
records that we're trying to go after," said
sophomore swingman David Moseley. "I
think we're just ready to play Cal. It's the
first home game so we're trying to estab
lish that this is one of the hardest places to
play in the Pac-l()and I hope that the Sixth
Man [Club] and the rest of the fans help us
uui."
The Cardinal had struggled in some of
its early-season victories over weaker
teams such as Santa Clara, but last week

end's sweep of its Oregon road trip was a
big boost.
The team was slow offensively at Ore
gon State on Saturday, but their defense
was overwhelming as the Beavers shot a
mere 18 percent from the floor for the
game and a horrible 9 percent in the first
half.
Monday's game against Oregon was
better all-around, as the Cardinal offense
finally exploded. Junior guard Kris Weems
showed his hot touch with 34 points on 13-
of-18 shooting en route to the 89-67 win.
The team will remain without injured
power forward Mark Madsen (right foot
stress fracture) and backup center Jason
Collins (frayed anterior cruciate ligament
in his left knee). But its depth below the
post will help the loss of their presence
from becoming too much of a factor and
head coach Mike Montgomery doesn't ex
pect to change his game plan.
"This isn't like chess where you change
your moves, this is playing the game"
Montgomery said. "I think the thing that
happens is different people are asked to
step up in different situations."
Cal has bounced back to .500 after an 0-
4 start, due greatly to the additions of
transfer guards Geno Carlisle and Thomas
Kilgore. who became eligible to play on
Dec. 22.
After Carlisle shot just 23.3 percent in
his first three games, he caught fire for
back-to-back 28-point performances
against the Oregon schools last weekend,
hitting 10 of 18 (55 percent) from down
town.
Kilgore has been solid off the bench for
the Bears, adding depth they desperately
needed. The backup point has contributed
an average of 10.4 points in his five games,
giving the Pac-10's worst scoring offense a
needed boost. The Bears averaged 56.6
points in their first five games, a mark that
has jumped almost 14 points a game with
the addition of thtficw guards.

Junior guard Kris Weems and the seventh-ranked
Card look to also match the school's longest home
winning streak (18), set back during the 1989-90
season.
