Ole Miss, Mississippi State, Boise
State, Texas and Kentucky, have
been invited to enter their top four

the Bryans, respectively, will play in

first-round bye, while twin brother
Mike is seeded third and also has a
bye. Paul Goldstein returns to play
for Stanford as the fifth seed in the

team," Gould said.
Both doubles and singles play
began this morning and will contin
