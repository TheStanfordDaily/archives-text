I don't got you, babe.

Q: What's vour reaction to Sonny Bono's death?

Diversion's is shameless; we'll just print anything if it fills space. Here we
publish Kitty Kelley's latest biography, the subject of which is none other
than University President Gerhard Casper. "Gerhard: The Will To Power" is
available for $19.99, quite reasonable when you consider that the book
could keep a fire burning for about another 10 minutes.

I have traced the origins of the phe
nomenon that has become Gerhard Casper all
the way back to his schooldays in Germany.
He was a notorious bully in the school ground
famous for administering "L)er Wunder
wedgie," a torture born of his own diseased
invention, whereby weaker children would be
hung from a lamppost by their underwear
while two fat children were tied to their sleeves
and left to dangle.
Casper's idol at school was Herr Krapp the
geography teacher. In Herr Krapp we can see
the model on which Casper was going to base
the rest of his career.
Tobias Krapp was a short man who intro
duced every class he taught by announcing "I
want to teach because, in all the world, there is
nothing 1 detest more than children." As a dis
ciplinary measure he regularly used a small
live animal, usually a kitten or squirrel, to beat
children around the face and neck, and that
was a punishment reserved only for the chil

dren that had nothing wrong. For those who
actually did break a rule Krapp would unleash
upon them the class lion. This animal, called
Hermann, was kept unfed in the stationary

closet and eventually ended Krapp's career
when it ate a visiting school inspector, causing
much embarrassment to the school board.
Casper's initial foray into teaching in
America was at UC-Berkeley, where he
became famous for his drunken lectures. He
would arrive with his tie jutting out of his open
fly and would spend much of the lecture talk
ing to the female members of the class with his
hand on their leg. These lectures usually ended
with Casper pulling down his trousers and
singing a bawdy song about a cleaning woman
with a nine inch nose.
*****************
Casper's sexual life would require more
than the mere 900 pages of this book to docu
ment. His most famous affair was with Nancy
Reagan, who called him '"Hard" and whom he
called "My Little Doppelboober." In America
right now there are at least 9000 individuals
who have a fair claim to be Casper's children.
He has never acknowledged any of them and
has in some cases employed men to go round
to their houses and spit on them.
*****************
The biggest career move was, of course,
Casper's presidency of Stanford University.
And yet this cannot be understood properly
without a full discussion of Casper's involve
ment with "II Braina Nostra," otherwise known
as the Academic Mafia.
The Academic Mafia, unlike its more
famous relation, has managed to remain out of
the public eye for years, yet this organization
has a strangle hold on every academic's life in
America. The Academic Mafia collects "Pro
tection Knowledge," usually 25 percent of a
professor's writing, in return for a guarantee
that the professor won't have his or her head
wrapped around a baseball bat in the near
future. Some of the best of American
academia's output has been embezzled by the
Academic Mafia, kept in numbered Swiss
bank accounts or laundered through phony
textbooks. The Academic Mafia knows so
much at this point that it could cause at least
two significant paradigm shifts. It is rumored,
for instance, that the Academic Mafia has an

irrefutable mathematical proof for the exis
tence of blowfish.
It was into this nebulous institution that
Casper joined in the '80s. He made a name for
himself as a ruthless collector of knowledge
and became close friends with Jimmy "Clam"
Chowder, a major player in the academic
underworld. In the early '90s the Mafia target
ed Stanford as the next university to take over,
and Casper was chosen as the man to oversee
this process.
Five years into his term as University
President Casper has overseen the complete
domination of the Academic Mafia over Stan
ford. A professor who spoke to me under the
strict assurance of anonymity, but who I'm

going to reveal anyway as Doug Osheroff,
described the conditions on the campus: "I get
a problem set every Thursday and if I don't
have my 'Protection Knowledge' in on time
then goons come round to my laboratory break
the test tubes and steal the board eraser. I have
a family to support, I don't know if I can take
much more of this".
Casper still has a stranglehold on the lives
of everybody at Stanford. His reputation for
decency must surely be called into question by
the findings of this biography. Similarly the
findings of this biography must be called into
question by the fact that I'm an incompetent
writer who will make up anything about a
famous person if it means a quick buck.


''Wasn't he married
to Yoko Ono?"


"Just like Michael
Kennedy. The Lord
wraps crooked politi
cians around trees."


"Now who's gonna
replace him, Cher?."


"He died? For real?
When did he die?"


"Last time I saw him
he was smiling with
Yoda and Obi wan
surrounded by a blue
glow."


Gerhard violently responds to "some interest
ing questions" in the infamous "Tea and
Cookies Massacre " of 1995.
