U Hello, my name is Magda and I will be your tour guide this afternoon.
Please step forward and follow me as 1 take you along Stanford's great tourist
attractions. Yes, 1 do walk backwards, but don't worry about me; if I trip and
fall, my insurance will take care of it â€” plus there's nothing that makes you stand out
quite like a piece of marble protruding from your back. This is my first day here, by the
way. I was fired from Jamba Juice last week for throwing cigarette butts into the
Razzmattazz, but then I was offered this job, which sure beats reshelving books; no
carpal tunnel syndrome for me, thank you very much.
Moving right along. If you look to your left, you will see the Row, where the people
who have sex and do drugs live. They are generally very happy and add something to
local color. If you look to your right, you see Sterling Quad. People are not having sex
there. Okay, we're walking, we're walking. Let's go into a dorm just to see what it's like.
Right ahead, there's a bathroom smelling of puke and somebody's dinner. Apparently
this is a freshman dorm, and the folks threw a little birthday party.
If you crane your neck to the right a little more, you can actually spot the puke float
ing on the toilet, although, as you can see, the person must have missed his aim,
because most of the macaroni and cheese is now on the floor. Boy, won't one custodian
be surprised tomorrow morning! Now, moving on, to your right, you can see a
woman, apparently a sophomore, sobbing quietly by her bed. Shh, quiet. You dotft
want to startle her. This is Simone, who's just broken up with her boyfriend. He thinks
she's a slut, when really all she wants is affection. Lots of it. From lots of different men.
All the time. Okay, moving on now.
All right, we haven't exactly hit all the hot spots yet. There's the post office, for
instance. People usually come here to pick up mail, although the only mail people get
is Playboy and phone bills, neither of which interest me. In high school, it was much
more lun to pilfer mail 'cause at least you could get high off of it. Okay, I sense some
restlessness from you guys. We could go to the Bookstore, although I'd rather not,
because I owe lots of money there and run the risk of being arrested. And then who
would finish the tour, right? Right. Okay. Well, I had an idea. Now, if you all squeeze,
we will enter into my purse. That's right. Feel the nice leathery lining, rub your shoul
ders against the metal clasp. There's room for everyone. Now isn't this nice, a a
Fla, ha. Now you're all stuck. I will get my books and pay with a small J y
Swedish child and a couple of prospective students from Wisconsin. . . * *
