# Those poor boys at DKE, will they ever find rest?

### 
Last year the Dekes lost their house.
There is a chance that the Dekes will get it, but
where? The University recently set up a panel
on the issue that keenly stressed the Universi
ty's enthusiasm for the Deke's getting housing
next year, providing they have enough mem
bers. However, the panel also stressed that the
squeeze on undergraduate housing made the
issue difficult to solve. Another problem was
the fact that the administration would rather
drink five buckets of vomit than give one more
fraternity a house.
Anyway here are the six proposals that the
panel proposed, along with their respective
advantages and disadvantages.
Proposal 1: A Shoe Box.
Advantages: Dekes can develop bonds of fra
ternity in close, community-building condi
tions; the 'house' can fit neatly into a clos
et and is easy to carry; the administration
could use this opportunity to emblazon the

Nike logo onto yet another item of its prop
erty.
Disadvantages: All members of the Deke fra
ternity would have to shrink to one tenth of
their current size. This could be achieved,
however, by getting rid of unnecessary ele
ments of the body (arms, torso, legs, left
hand) cutting off every member's head,
attaching his feet to the bottom of his neck,
and placing his right hand behind his ear.
Proposal 2: Basement of Psych, building.

Advantages: Stanford prison experiment?
Schmanford Schmison Schmexperiment.
The "Stanford Fraternity Experiment" is the
new wave in faulty ethics. Zimbardo
induced conditions of evil, hatred and para

noia are preferable to regular fraternity life
Disadvantages: Those Ã¼ber-dorks in the His
tory Department might object to the noise
next door.
Proposal 3: Lake Lagunita
Advantages: Plenty of room. The forces of
necessity might compel the Dekes to
develop gills, thus creating a new breed of
superhumans and our evolutionary suc
cessors.
Disadvantages: During the winter and fall fra
ternity activity might disrupt tiger salaman
der migration. Therefore, between October
and February, any time in the Deke 'house'
must be spent lying motionless and face
down in the mud.
Proposal 4: Mother Theresa s left ear.
Advantages: Mother Theresa is not using it
any more, plus her left ear is a lot nicer
than her right ear.

Disadvantages: Lots of ear wax and halogen
lamps could create fire hazard; state of
India unlikely to appreciate the importance
of housing the Deke fraternity.
Proposal 5: The old Deke house, now
'Andromeda.'
Advantages: Has traditionally housed the
Dekes. Has proven ideal housing for the
fraternity in the past.
Disadvantages: The administration re-house
the Dekes in their old house? Ha, ha, that's
a funny one.



"Hey, the Dekes
can live in me any
time. I'm a shoe
box!"
