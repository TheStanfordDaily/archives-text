### Kelly Young Staff writer 
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ence's John Shoven will step down
from his position this spring.
Provost Condolee//a Rice an
nounced at yesterday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting.
After serving his lull five-vear
term as dean, he said he wants to de
vote more time to teaching and re
search. I le will begin teaching an in
troductory seminar in economics
today.
"This will he my first crack at
teaching freshmen in a long time."
Shoven said.
Shoven has served as an adminis
trator for 12 years and has spent a
total of 25 years at Stanford.
"I've really gotten a lot" out of
being dean. Shoven said. "I'd do it
again. There's satisfaction of work
ing in that environment, and there's
satisfaction in creating that environ
ment. which is what I think the ad
ministration does."
Shoven said he is particularly
proud of the role he played in devel
oping the minors program, the Pro
gram in Comparative Studies in

Race and Ethnicity and Introduc
tion to the Humanities, which re
placed the Program in Cultures,
Ideas and Values.
"He leaves a legacy of first-rate
faculty appointments." Rice said.
Rice will meet with the senate's
Committee on Committees soon to
develop a list of people for a search
committee* to find a new dean.
Also yesterday, the senate re
viewed proposed revisions to facul
ty grievance procedures, which the
senate had the authority to veto hut
not amend.
Arthur Vienott. professor of en
gineering-economic systems and
operations research, raised a con
cern that under the revisions an ad
minstrative officer would no longer
be obliged to consult a professor's
department should a faculty mem
ber have a grievance concerning ap
pointment. reappointment or pro
motion.
However, according to the pro
posed revisions, grievance officers
still have the option to consult de
partments. although it is not re
quired.
"We have to keen in mind that
these are peer reviews, not legal re
views." Rice said. University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper noted that
placing mandatory procedures in the
rules created dangers of complex
legal wrangling.
A motion by Vienott to table the
revisions failed.
Mathematics Prof. Brad Osgood
then gave an update on the Science
Core, the three-track interdiscipli
nary program for non-science ma
jors that is in its second year.
Biology Prof. Sharon Long, who
teaches in the core, said she hopes to
increase enrollment and to add more
tracks.
"We have one big problem." said
Genetics Prof. Richard Myers, an
other Science Core professor. "We

have half the number of students we
should have." He hopes to increase
enrollment to 60 students for each
track.
Computer Science Prof. Eric
Roberts raised concern that such an
interdisciplinary sequence was only
available to non-science majors who
would probably not pursue any sci
ence interests that the courses may
spawn.
Long said that several students
taking her track actually did not con
tinue the three-quarter sequence be
cause they had to take other classes
for their newly declared science ma
jors.
If everything goes as planned. Os
good hopes to implement one new
track in the near future. He is also
working on a collaboration with the
School of Education for students in
terested in teaching science in sec
ondary schools.
