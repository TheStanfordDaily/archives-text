### Kelly Young Staff writer 
For the first time in five years,
the athletics director spoke to the
Faculty Senate at yesterday's meet
ing.
In his short presentation, Ted
Leiand emphasized the active ath
letic community at Stanford. How
ever. he admitted that funding such
a broad community has been a
challenge.
"We have a community that re
ally enjoys athletic activity." he
said. "It's difficult to keep up."
Those financial difficulties may
worsen. Leiand added.
The Rose Bowl, which tradi
tionallv has been between the Pa

cificlO Conference champion and
the Big Ten Conference champion,
may change. Authorities are con
sidering including the Pac-lOcham
pion in the Rose Bowl only three
out of four years. This could hurt
alumni support should Stanford
win the PjflMO title but attend a dif
ferent bowl game, Leiand said.
"I fought like a lion for keeping
the Rose Bowl pure." said Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper.
New Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
Robert Kinnally spoke about his
relationship with the Athletic De
partment in his short time at the
University.
