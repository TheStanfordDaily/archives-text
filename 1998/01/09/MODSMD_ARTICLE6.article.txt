# Athletics Dept reports to senate
## 
### Kelly Young Staff writer 
For the first time in five years,
the athletics director spoke to the
Faculty Senate at yesterday's meet
ing.
In his short presentation, Ted
Leiand emphasized the active ath
letic community at Stanford. How
ever. he admitted that funding such
a broad community has been a
challenge.
"We have a community that re
ally enjoys athletic activity." he
said. "It's difficult to keep up."
Those financial difficulties may
worsen. Leiand added.
The Rose Bowl, which tradi
tionallv has been between the Pa

cificlO Conference champion and
the Big Ten Conference champion,
may change. Authorities are con
sidering including the Pac-lOcham
pion in the Rose Bowl only three
out of four years. This could hurt
alumni support should Stanford
win the PjflMO title but attend a dif
ferent bowl game, Leiand said.
"I fought like a lion for keeping
the Rose Bowl pure." said Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper.
New Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
Robert Kinnally spoke about his
relationship with the Athletic De
partment in his short time at the
University.
"I'm very impressed with the re
lationship the Athletics Department
has with Admissions here," Kinnal
ly said. "These are students that are
more than capable of handling the
work here."
Leland is also proud of the rela
tionship.
"We're the only Division I
school, outside the Ivy League, that
makes students fill out a full applica
tion before their status is acted
upon." Leland said.
Slavic Languages Prof. Richard
Schupbach complained that the
University has a "let-them-eat-
Roble attitude" toward recreational
athletes and intramural sports. He
cited the poor athletic facilities at
Roble Gym as an example of this at

titude.
"Sooner or later, we will have to
compete for student and alumni
money with people who do a better
job than we do," Schupbach said.
He cited schools such as UCLA and
Foothill College as having better
recreational facilities than Stanford.
Schupbach also raised issue with
the limited access to Arrillaga Fami
ly Sports Center. He said that having
it available to the public from noon
to 2 p.m. severely restricts the num
ber of people who have access.
He said the success of the athletic
facility at Tresidder Union shows
that students are starved for addi
tional recreational facilities.
Provost Condoleezza Rice point
ed out that $500,000 is being allotted
to pay for new intramural fields to
be built along Sand Hill Road this
spring.
However, Rice admitted, "The

University may not be able to meet
the recreational demand for faculty
and staff." She said that she pur
chased her own gym membership
elsewhere.
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall
noted that with the exception of
NCAA playoffs, no events are sup
posed to be held during Dead Week,
yet five varsity events are scheduled
for Dead Week in March.
"We try to avoid it as much as we
can," Leland said. He promised to
check on scheduling.
Leland's presentation was fol
lowed by a presentation by former
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds on Stanford's self
study for NCAA certification. The
self-study, which focuses on fiscal in
tegrity, commitment to equity and
governance and commitment to
rules compliance, is scheduled to be
completed by August 1998.
