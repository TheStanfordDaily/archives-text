"It iv especially fitting. I nited States Informa
tion Agency Director Joseph Duffey said in a state
ment. "that Arm Biehl. who worked passionately
for democracy for all South Africans and who so
embodied the ideals of the Fulbright program,
should be remembered this way."

sorts According to the agency, one of the scholar
ships will go to an American graduate student to

South African graduate student to come to the
I nited States and study.
Biehl was killed while studying on a Fulbright
scholarship at the University of Western Cape
Community I aw Center and working on voter ed
ucation projects in preparation for the nation's first
all-race elections in April IW4
Biehl. an international relations major who
graduated in 19N9 with honors, was murdered as
she was driving three black friends to their homes
in Cape Town's (iugulctu Township. Her car was
stoned to a stop and Biehl was taken from the vehi-
cle by a group of young men.
The crowd surrounding the car
was apparently shouting the Pan-
Africanist Congress chant, "One
settler [white person], one bullet"
while Biehl was hit in the head with
a brick and stabbed several times.
The 26-year-old died soon after at a
nearby police station.
Four vouths were later indicted

by South Africa's Truth and Rec
onciliation Commission. Biehl is
believed to be the first American
killed in South Africa's struggle for
democracy and freedom.
Since their daughter's death.
Amy's parents, Linda and Peter
Biehl, have made a point of contin
uing her work. The two created the
Amy Biehl Foundation, which edu
cates voters and trains community
workers in the townships. The
Biehls have taken a high-profile
role in South African reform since

the 1993 death of their daughter,
meeting with such notables as Nel
son Mandela and Desmond Tutu.
A May 1997 interview with the
Houston Chronicle describes
changing South Africa as a Biehl
family priority.
In the same article. Linda Biehl
is quoted as saying, "All I want is
South Africa to get on with it. Amy
died there because she wanted that
country to go forward. Don't stop
now."
The mission of the Fulbright

program is "to increase mutual un
derstanding between the people of
the United States and the people of
other countries," according to the
organization. The scholarships
were established in 1946 by Con
gressional legislation proposed by
Sen. William J. Fulbright of
Arkansas. Funded by the federal
government, the grants are award
ed to American and foreign stu
dents, teachers and scholars to go
abroad (or come to the United
States) to research, teach and study.
