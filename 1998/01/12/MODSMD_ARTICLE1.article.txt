# Stanford skins Bears
## Cardinal off to its best start in 61 years 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
People may comment on the
men's basketball team's light sched
ule up to now. but with each passing
game the squad is looking more and
more impressive.
The No. 7 Cardinal (14-0.3-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) used a balanced
inside-outside attack to take care of
cross-bay rival California 84-74 in its
conference home opener Saturday
at a sold-out Maples Pavilion.
The win tied the school mark for
the longest winning streak to start a

season, as well as tying Stanford's
longest home winning streak at 18
games.
But Cardinal coach Mike Mont
gomery isn't as concerned about the
record books as he is with his team's
solid play as of late.
"We've got 16 more games to try
to win." Montgomery said. "We've
done a good job. The kids are excit
ed about what's going on. They're
interested in coming out every game
and trying to play hard.
"It'll mean something at the end
of the season if we continue to build
on it. It's a nice foundation to have.

You can't take them away from us. If
we continue to improve and play
well it'll mean something at the end
of the year."
And the Cardinal has continued
to improve with every game. The
team hit 57 percent of their shots
against the Bears, including 7 of 13
from three-point range.
"I think [the team's confidence is)
sky-high," said junior guard Kris
Weems, who has had the hot hand
lately for Stanford. Weems finished
with 16 points and three assists while
hitting 7 of 11 from the floor.
"We've been able to shut teams
down, and we didn't play as good (de
fensively) as we've been playing the
last 13 games" in the first hall, he said.
In the second half, "we relied on our
defense and we got some good offen
sive production from Tim [Young]
... and from our bench as well."
But the Bears (5-6.1-2) answered
back with one of their most solid per
formances of the season. The team
made 14 of their 27 first-half shots,
and Ux)k a five-point lead on a dunk
by center Kenvon Jones with S min
utes. 44 seconds left before the inter
mission.
But a three-pointer and a layup by
sophomore swingman Ryan Mende/
tied the score at 25. After Mende/
failed to convert the front end of a
one-and-one, Cal guard Thomas Kil
gore sank a layup to put the Bears
back up by two.
Cardinal sophomore guard David
Moseley then hit his only three
pointer of the game, and the team
never trailed again.
After Cal tied the score again, the
Cardinal went on a 13-5 run to take
the 41-33 lead into the break.
"Early on, it was a heck of a game
in terms of nobody really making any
mistakes and just shooting it in,"
Montgomery said. "Once we got
things kind of smoothed out and
squared away and the game kind ol
got going, I certainly felt better he
cause we were making good plays."
The main problem for the Cardi
nal in the first hall was the emergence
of Kilgore. who led all scorers at the
half with II points. With starters
Geno Carlisle and Raymond King
taking up most of the attention. Kil
gore was able to come in as a third
guard and give the Bears a slight
quickness advantage.
But the Cardinal defense

stepped it up in the second half. All
of the team's three blocks and four
steals came after halt time, and the
Stanford frontcourt w;is able to
keep the Cal hig men from becom
ing too much of a factor. The Hear
starting frontline of forwards
Michael Gill, Sean Marks and
Jones was held to only three bas
kets on eight shots in the second
half.
Stanford's big men also made a
major contribution at the other end
of the court. Young scored 16 points
and pulled down eight rebounds. Se
nior power forward Pete Van Elswyk
helped keep ('a lat bay with 11 points
in the second half.
Carlisle almost single-handedly
kept the Bears in the game with 22
second-half points en route to a
game-high 25. The Bears pulled to
within 64-59 with K:22 to play, but
then junior Cardinal point guard
Arthur Lee took over.
Lee scored 12 of his team-leading
IS points over the last 6:30, including
10 of 12 free throws, to help put Cal
away for good.
The Bears have adapted quickly
to the arrival of transfers Carlisle.
Kilgore and forward Francisco
Elson. The two guards have only
been eligible for six games, a span in
which the Bears have gone 4-2.
Braun looks forward to getting this
squad to evolve more as the season
goes on.
"I think having a unit that's played
together is important. The more our
team gets to play together. I think the
better we're going to become."
The game featured the confer
ence's top two defensive squads, but
it was the offensive performances
that shined. The Card's K4 points
were the most given up by Cal all
year, and the 74 by the Bears are sec
ond only to Butler's K4 against Stan
lord on Nov. 29 in the final of the Big
Island Invitational.
