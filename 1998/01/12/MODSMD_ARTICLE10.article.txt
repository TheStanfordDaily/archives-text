## 49ers lose 23-10 Packers advance to Super Bowl 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
Witli a defense that ground the
proud 49ers into the mud. Green
Hay showed San Francisco who's
boss of their NFC family.
Led by Brett Favre and domi
nating defenders, the Packers
defeated the 49ers 23-10 yesterday
in the conference championship,
holding them to just 33 yards on the
ground and forcing them into criti
cal penalties and mistakes.
"How 'bout this Packer D!"
yelled general manager Ron Wolf,
who built the team that won the
NFL title last season and immedi
ately became a 12 1/2-point favorite
over the Denver Broncos in the
Super Bowl.
Favre threw a 27-vard touch
down pass to Antonio Freeman and
for 222 yards overall, taking advan
tage of San Francisco cornerbacks
Rod Woodson and Marque/. Pope,
the one weakness in the 49ers'
league-leading defense.
Still, it was the Green Bay
defense, playing in rain that grew
steadier as the game wore on, that
took over.
It allowed only three points
the other seven came on Chuck
Levy's 95-yard kickoff return with
2:52 left. That touchdown came
after Dorsey Levens, who ran for
114 yards, made it 23-3 with a -
yard TD run. It was the first time
the 49ers allowed a l(X)-yard game
this season.

" They were very good. We
couldn't run the ball the way we
hoped to," 49ers coach Steve Mari
ucci said. "They just outplayed us.
The rain was a factor."
Favre agreed that the weather
made the game difficult to play.
"This was as tough as it gets," he
said. "We wanted to get up early so
we could hold the ball, control the
ball."
Once the Packers did get up. 13-
3 at the half, the Niners had almost
no chance against the clever defens
es ol coordinator Fritz Shurmur.
Eugene Robinson returned an
interception 51 yards to set up the
game's first touchdown. Gilbert
Brown, Brian Williams and Leßoy
Butler shut down the San Francisco
running game, limiting it to 33 yards
on 18 carries.
And while the 49ers made a few
big plays, they also made huge mis
takes — 59 yards of penalties in the
first half.
They included two consecutive
holding penalties that negated
major gains, a pass-interference call
that set up an early Green Bay field
goal and a botched reverse that
eventually led to Robinson's inter
ception.
I'his was the family ties game:
Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren
was a mentor to San Francisco
quarterback Steve Young and the
49ers' Steve Mariucci coached
Favre in Green Bay.
