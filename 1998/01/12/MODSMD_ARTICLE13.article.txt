MONTREAL (AP) — Though
weeklong freezing rain finally
ended. Montreal remained a strick
en city Saturday — many of its res
idents without power and water,
streets littered with fallen branches
and dangerous chunks of ice crash
ing from the trees.
"It's like a defrosting fridge,"
said Lee Thomas, co-owner of the
Corner Snack Bar in downtown
Montreal, as temperatures climbed
into the 3(>s to end Canada's worst
ever ice storm. Her regular bread
delivery resumed Saturday for the
first time in days.
Eleven deaths have been blamed
on the storm, which cut off power to
nearly 3 million people in Quebec,
halted most flights to Montreal and
Ottawa and shut down rail service
in most of eastern Canada.
In Montreal. Canada's second
largest city, hundreds of thou
sands of people were without
power, and about 15.(XX) were liv
ing in shelters set up at schools,
libraries and community centers.
The utility company, Hydro-Que
bec, warned that some areas out
side the city might not have power
for weeks.
Parts of the Montreal were
without water because electric
pumps were not working, and offi
cials urged residents to boil their
water and reduce consumption.
Some apartment buildings were
completely dark overnight, and
many hotels passed out candles to
guests who had to climb several
flights of stairs to reach their
rooms.
"It seems like it's over now,"
said Carlos Vieira, whose business
closed Thursday when the electrici
ty went out.
