Reno reopens Unahom talks
NEW YORK (AP) — Softening its resolve to seek
the death penalty against Theodore Kac/vnski. the
Justice Department last week secretly re-opened plea
bargain talks with lawyers lor the I nabom defendant.
Newsweek reported.
Citing.government sources, the magazine reports
in today's issue that Attorney General Janet Rent)
may not want to risk a circus trial that could lead to
numerous appeals.
Last month, prosecutors reportedly turned down a
conditional offer by Kaczynski to plead guilt\ in
return for a life sentence, and were prepared to open
his trial on Jan. 5.
However. Kaczynski threw the proceedings into
disarray by telling I S. District Judge (iarland Burrell
that he wanted to fire his lawyers and represent him
self. Kaczynski also attempted suicide in his cell.
Burrell has put the trial on hold pending a ps\chi
atric examination, which will be followed by a compe
tency hearing scheduled for Jan. 22.
This week, a special panel of Justice Department
lawyers will convene to reconsider whether kac/ynski
deserves the death penalty, according to Newsweek.
"We have not and will not comment on an\ kind of
ongoing discussion between the parties." said I eesa
Brown, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department
prosecution team in Sacramento. ( alit
But she noted that "it is the duty of the prosecution
to listen to any credible offer b\ defense counsel at
any time. That being said, we are preparing to assist
the court for its ordered competency evaluation and
resumption of the trial."
She said it would be "oversimplihing what's going
on" to suggest that any plea talks with defense lawyers
stemmed directlv from last week's unusu.il events.
