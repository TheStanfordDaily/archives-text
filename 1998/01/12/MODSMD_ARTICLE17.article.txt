## Editorial It's time for equality Revive sorority housing 
### 
Sororities should have the
chance to experience the
joys of communal living

IN LIGHT OF the extensive discussion
in recent years regarding sorority hous
ing. the Greek housing application
packet released last week is a landmark
step — both toward achieving the concrete
goal of housing sororities during the 1998-
99 academic year and more importantly,
toward recognizing the value that a unifying
residential experience provides for all
Greek organizations.
Assuming that sorority housing applica
tions are approved. 1998 would mark the
first time in 56 years that sororities are
housed on the Stanford campus.
Providing Greek organizations with res
idences encourages a group's self-perpetua
tion by fostering cohesion among members
and by making fraternities and sororities
more attractive organizations.
Greek housing has a long tradition at
Stanford. Although currently there are only
six housed Greek organizations, there were
10-12 housed fraternities in the 1980s and
considerably more housed Greek organiza
tions, both fraternities and sororities, in the
19305.
The University should be commended
for upholding a tradition of Greek life at
Stanford, for creating another housing
option within its varied residential housing
program and for giving sororities priority in

the application process in an attempt to
address the gender inequalities in the cur
rent Greek housing system.
However we recognize that additional
housing devoted to Greek life does inher
ently further limit the options available to
non-Greek affiliated students and may
result in transforming more coveted Row
housing into fraternity and sorority resi
dences.
Therefore, in the interests of preserving
desirable options for non-Greek affiliated
students, we urge Residential Education to
convert low to middle range quality resi
dences into Greek housing. The cohesive
ness provided by the communal living expe
rience should offset the lack of some com
forts.
Additionally, the University should be
vigilant in requiring that all members of a
housed Greek organization live in the
house or seek off campus accommodations,
unless the group's membership exceeds the
house's capacity.
We also recognize that housing sorori
ties and additional fraternities could tend to
decrease the diversity of dormitory resi
dents.
Despite such drawbacks as limiting
housing options of non-Greek affiliated stu
dents and draining dormitories of some of
the diversity they currently enjoy, we
endorse the addition of sorority housing so
as to provide sororities with the same
opportunities enjoyed by fraternities —
namely, to form close-knit support net
works and to make their organizations
more attractive to potential members.
