Sixty years ago this week, the fresh
men in Roble Hall (then an all
female residence) led a movement
against sororities that galvanized the
campus during its January pledge week.
Out of a class of 250 freshmen
women. 150 had initially rushed for at
least one of the nine housed sororities.
Yet after further consideration many
women assured of bids pledged to
refuse all bids offered to them citing the
inevitable discrimination involved in
the pledging process, the disappoint
ment of being separated from friends
who didn't rush or were accepted into
other sororities and the general toll on
health that the pledging system fos
tered.
Reaction to the Roble revolt was
mixed although many hailed it a sign of a
progressive female student body.
Dean of Women Mary Yost declared.
"To even think of attacking a vested
interest takes courage and clear thinking.
And thev were onlv freshmen."

A housemother in one of the sorori
ties suggested that "girls in small closed
groups like a sorority learn co-opera
tion and subordination of the individual
for the benefit of the whole ... but since
the tendency of modern life is more and
more towards individuality, I think the
abolition of sororities is a coming
thing."
The Daily's response to events at
Roble was by far the most inflammatory
and conservative. Suggesting the move
ment exemplified "mob hysteria," the
paper's editorial board urged the Univer
sity to immediately address the issue by
either eliminating sorority housing or by
increasing the number of houses avail
able to women.
Although the sorority houses were
capable of accommodating 117 new
pledges, only K9 women ultimately
accepted bids.
In 1944, as competition for bids
became increasingly severe, sororities
were banned bv the Hoard of Trustees.
