## Accepting the painful reality 
### 
After puking
in a public bath
room this morn
ing, I had to skip my class
es. cancel an appointment
with a professor, stand up
a dinner date and neglect
my errands. Instead, I

spent the day drugged out on my bed.
I'm not hungover, it's just that time of
the month again.
I'm prepared to take some flak for dis
cussing my menstrual cycle publicly. I know
some consider it akin to talking about bowel
movements and other bodily functions. You
can call me crass, just don't accuse me of
being a hysterical female that uses cramps
as an excuse for slacking off.
Fear of such reactions compels me to
fabricate excuses rather than admit the
truth. Our furnace is broken. The furnace
guy was late. My roommate is having an
affair with the furnace fixer, and I crashed
my car into the neighbor's house while try
ing to distract her boyfriend.
Besides the frustration of having missed
out on my plans today, I'm slightly annoyed
that there is no acceptable mechanism in
our society for dealing with menstrual prob
lems. In many indigenous cultures, where
menstruation was considered a sacred time
for women, females retreated into secluded
caves and huts a couple of days each month.
In our capitalistic culture, where the only
thing that is sacred is an individual's pro
ductive power, menstruation is seen merely
as an interference. An estimated 140 million
working hours are lost per year due to men
struation. This is used to justify denying
women positions of power.
In the face of such discrimination many
women try to diminish the effects of our
reproductive systems. On the Hip side, the

medical community's neglect of menstrual
problems until recent years has many femi
nists screaming, "If men had these problems
it would be considered a national crisis!"
Politics aside, statistics tell us that 50 per
cent of women experience pain during men
struation, most of them are young and have
not borne children. I fall into the 10 percent
of women whose cramps are "incapacitat
ing."
What is disturbing to me about these
numbers is that while many women suffer
during menstruation, lew accommodations
are made for us. We're allowed an equal
number of sick days and un-excused
absences as men, yet half of us are going to
be in a lot of pain once a month with no
good excuse for missing work, class,
appointments and dates.
If the definition of equality is equal con
ditions for equal persons, then inequality is
when unequals are given the same condi
tions. So, for example, it is widely known
that it takes women much longer to go to
the bathroom than men (because we have
to sit to urinate and because at any given
time a fifth of women will be menstruating,
which means take extra time to change
their sanitary materials). So same sized
bathrooms for men and women are not
equal. The result is that women's public
restrooms are always more crowded than
men's.
This is the next great battle for feminists:
institutional equality that reflects the differ
ences between men and women.
I remember a few years ago a campus
publication dedicated an issue to the ques
tion, "Is there sexism in academia?"
I was pondering the question and
although I was unable to think of any con
crete instances when women were treated
unfairly, it seemed that women face differ

ent issues than men do.
The next day I found myself on the floor
of my dorm room wrought with my month
ly dysmenorrhea. Through the wall I could
hear my neighbor sobbing about her emo
tionally abusive boyfriend. Between the two
of us. life wasn't looking good. And when I
reflected on the situations of my other
female friends, it was even worse.
I had just helped a friend back East with
an unwanted pregnancy, I had recently
received word that my childhood chum was
being readmitted to the hospital for anorex
ia, and I had been up late that night coun
seling a friend about a sexual assault that
had left her emotionally scarred.
Meanwhile, some fraternity was holding
a basketball tournament outside my dorm,
and their loud music kept waiting through
my windows.
I still have a hard time putting my finger
on it, but on days like these I can't help
thinking that there is an essential difference
between the experiences of the sexes, one
of which is being muffled by shame and
silence, while the other is being lived out
loud.
Not that the female experience is all
about pain. I wouldn't trade it for the world.
Alter all. we get to have the miracle of
childbirth, and of course, multiple orgasms.
Sexism in academia? I'll say this much:
just because things look equal doesn't mean
there's real equality.
We could definitely use bigger bath
rooms.

Kerry Rodgers, a senior majoring in philos
ophy and form of visual arts, thinks the
University should build a mud hut on the
row for female staff faculty and students to
retreat to during their menses â€” compli
mentary date-canceling and errand-running
services included.
