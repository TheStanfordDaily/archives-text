## 
### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
Students who wish to have
American Sign Language fulfill
their language requirement can now
petition to do so. according to an
October decision by the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Studies.
This new policy resolves the de
bate over sign language 13 years
after the initial proposal. Each peti
tion will be approved or denied at
the discretion of Elizabeth Bern

hardt-Kamil. Language Center di
rector and German language pro
fessor.
Bernhardt-Kamil explained that
she interviews each student to get to
know them, as well as to discern
their intellectual interest in sign lan
guage. "I want to make sure the stu
dents are not taking the easy way
out. as the Commission for Under
graduate Studies was worried about.
"I always maintained that sign
language should fulfill the require
ment since the coal of the require-

ment is to promote knowledge of
other languages." she said.
"The main reason of the contro
versy on the issue w;is caused by the
relatively low number of credits as
signed to the class, a common prob
lem of all the languages in the Spe
cial Languages Program." Bern
hardt-Kamil said.
When the language requirement
was first established in 1994 along
with the LaniÂ»uai>e Center, five
credit courses such as Spanish.
French or German were specified as
fulfilling the requirement. The com
mission made an exception for the
four-credit languages so that they
would officially fulfill the require
ment as well. Bernhardt-Kamil said.
Less popular languages, which
were put in the Special Languages
Program under the Division of Lit
eratures. Cultures and Languages,
are offered for three units.
Students petitioned last year for
sign language to fulfill the require
ment. but "the decision was put off
because there were other priori
ties." Bernhardt-Kamil said.
Cathy Haas, the sign language
lecturer, said that the first proposal
for sign to count as a foreign lan
guage was made in l c )84. but there
wasn't student and faculty support
at the time.
"No one really understood sign
language. Current student reviews
are very enthusiastic, however, and
many students have gone into ca
reers where sign language has been

useful," Haas said.
Dara Primmer, a feminist and re
ligious studies senior who took the
class, said it was "a great opportuni
ty to explore the amazing world of
sign. Cathy Haas is a great teacher.
If students know that the class they
are enjoying will fulfill a require
ment as well, they may be more in
clined to take it."
Until this quarter, students who
were hearing or speech-impaired
were allowed to substitute a class in
foreign culture if the Disability Re
source Center gave a recommenda
tion in that respect, according to
University Registrar Roger Printup.
It is now possible for students to
place out of the requirement or to
place into second or third quarter
sign by taking the Sign Communica
tion Proficiency Interview, designed
by the National Technology Insti
tute for the Deaf at the Rochester
Institute of Technology.
Even without the added appeal
of fulfilling a requirement, the sign
class usually has an enrollment of 30
to 50 students. The class is offered at
two levels, beginner and intermedi
ate. Each level consists of three
quarters.
