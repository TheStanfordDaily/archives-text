# Showering with the Boys
## Classes, codes, and denying classification 
###

THERE MUST BE a lot of people
trying to fill their gender distribution
requirement. What else could lure
6(X) students to Annenberg Auditorium?
What else could so entice students that
they would be willing to occupy every avail
able square inch of the stairs and complete
ly fill the back of the auditorium with a
standing room only crowd?
What else could cause students to leave
en masse during the break to frantically dig
out adviser codes to register for the class in
order to preserve their spot among 340?
Could it be Human Sexuality?
The turnout is remarkable — especially
considering that finding the coursebooks in
the bookstore is about as impossible as
drawing into a single.
I guess you gotta do what you gotta do
when you have the dagger to fill, (the dag
ger would be Area 4C for all you younger
kinder).
Hum Sex may be the closest to Wood
stock I'll ever get. Flocks of twenty-some
thing rebel-rousers packed together enjoy
ing life — even if Prof. Katchadourian has
yet to sing or play the guitar.

However, along with this class comes
baggage. When people ask me what I am
taking,they don't comment on the intrigue
of Civil Liberties or the beauty of music his
tory. Instead they latch on to "that sex
class."
It's like I am doing something wrong by
fulfilling a gender DR. And I wonder why
studying other cultures and views is sudden
ly provocative when it involves sexuality?
Yet a larger concern arose three minutes
into class when we were told that registering
via Axess was the only way to reserve a
spot.
I know, I know, what's the big deal? I
should be grateful that this class is making
me get on the bus, put in my study list and
avoid those nasty late registration fees that
Registrar's Office is so fond of dishing out.
Well, if only in were that simple, but life
seldom is.
When I was a clever freshman I declared
my major my first quarter. It guaranteed
priority access to classes and scholarships,
departmental support, and as a bonus, con
cert passes.
What I didn't count on was the pain and

agony ol the lite hound hy adviser codes.
There is this Stanford myth that once you
declare, your harried late night phone calls
to your sharp, cookie-baking AAs are over.
That is a cruel lie.
For some it is true and beautiful, but for
a handful of us woefully involved in well
meaning departments, we shall carry our
scarlet numbers until we wear our trousers
rolled.
1 appreciate the sentiment, really, I do
that my department wishes to keep such a
loving eye on my little blond-head stirs big
warm-fuzzies. It also adds hassle to mv life.
So, while sitting in Hum Sex that lirst
day, I realized that I did not possess those
magical four numbers or an adviser who
was on campus to bequeath them to me.
And as the class flew by. so did my
department's office hours. I sat there, taking
notes while dreams of being in an interest
ing class were being squashed along with my
hopes of ever finishing my dagger DR.
During the break in the class, I did what
I had to do. I left my coveted fifth row seat
and bolted out the door.
I was at the department office within

three minutes, which unfoitunately hap
pened to be 20 minutes alter closing. So I
did what any self-respecting student does in
a pinch: I begged
I he secretary listened to my story and by
golly, she got me that code.
And while I am grateful lor the secretary
and her kindness, the whole thing left me
out of breath and cranky. As I returned to
class and stood behind a friend who is
almost 30 years old, I realized how ludicrous
it all is. She has a child, a house, student
loans, mortgages, a hushand and a dog. Yet
she still needs an adviser code.
I realized it is all too much. II m\ depart
ment wants me, tr\ nessy(»leland. I check
my mail every day and will respond as artic
ulately as possible hi a jiffy. I liese four
numbers aren't the way.
Just as it is ridiculous to be required to
obtain departmental approval, it is also
ridiculous for people to draw conclusions
about me based on the classes I choose to
fulfill my DRs
What happened to the freedom to
explore? If I don't finish m\ major in exact
ly four years that is m\ problem. The Uni

versity should be thrilled. I keep paying
them.
And you know. I am going to keep tak
ing what I want to take whether or not I
have to get a code or deal vsith close mind
ed people.
After we are gone, there are no more
codes. I he security check point is gone. No
more flashing beacons or radio tracking col
lars
So why not just let me be? A class can
only make me learn .
And il you trust me without a code. I'll
do my best, learn from my own mistakes
and try really hard. I promise.
