## Lee and Weems become backcourt dynamic duo 
### Ben Hur Senior staff writer 
Although Stanford's big men
may receive much of the hoopla
these days, the play of some of the
guys under 6-foot-7 keyed the Car
dinal's K4-74 victory over California
Saturday night.
Junior guards Arthur Lee and
Kris Weems combined for 34 points
as the seventh-ranked Cardinal re
minded the rest of the Pac-l()that it
has a backcourt to he reckoned with.
Lee led the team with confidence
against the Golden Bears, much the
way his predecessor at the point did
during his years on the Farm. Al
though nobody could make the Car
dinal faithful forget Brevin Knight,
the plav Lee is helping Stanford fans
cope with the loss.
"Arthur Lee had a solid game
and did some nice things to help his
team win." Bears coach Ben Braun
said. " I hose years of practicing
against Brevin Knight have paid
off."
Apparently Lee also learned
about how to play down the stretch
from Knight. After re-entering the
game with nearly nine minutes left
in the second half. Lee saw Stan
ford's 14-point lead dwindle to five.
From then on. Lee went on to
score 11 points while directing the
Cardinal attack with authority.
When Cal did its best to shut down
Stanford's perimeter shooting and
inside game. Lee broke down the
defense and created shot opportuni
ties for himself and his teammates.
The backbreaker for the Golden
Bears came with 4 minutes. lfi sec
onds remaining in the game and Cal

trailing hy six. Lee brought the hall
up the court and then launched a
three-point shot when he noticed
the ("al defender trying to go under
neath the screen set by Cardinal ju
nior forward Pete Sauer. The basket
brought the lead into double digits
for gt>od.
Lee "is doing a great job."
Weems said. "He's doing good
things and looking for his shot at key
times."
Weems continued his hot shoot
ing. nailing seven of his 11 shots for
16 points. On the Cardinal's first
possession. Weems came around a
screen, took the pass from Lee, and
nailed an IK-foot jumper. Weems
went on to score nine of Stanford's
first IS points.
W eems "is just on fire." Lee said.
"He's making some big shots for
us."
Weems also sparked Stanford
during the second half. During one
three-minute stretch. Weems sank
an 18-foot jumper despite being
knocked down on the play. He then
drilled a 6-foot runner, adding two
steals that helped pad the Cardinal
lead.
Perhaps the only aspect of the
game where Weems and Lee strug
gled was shutting down the play of
( al junior guards Geno ( arlisle and
Thomas Kilgore. Although the
( ard expected offensive production
from Carlisle, the Kilgore's offen
sive ability didn't seem to make it
onto the scouting report.
"1 thought Kilgore was just a
solid player who wasn't too steady."
Lee said. "But he caueht us off
guard a little."
The way that Weems and partic
ularly Lee handled the hall and thi
Cardinal team during the last 1(
minutes may have been the mos
encouraging aspect of the game foi
Stanford. Lee was Brevinesque ir
his management of the clock and ir

his ability to make clutch foul shots
toward the end of the game.
All told. Lee finished with 1§
points, four assists, one steal and
only one turnover in 30 minutes.
With the backcourt playing so welh
Stanford has its share of believers.
"We've played both North Car
olina early and Stanford." Braun
said. "They have similar looks, and
Stanford is definitely a UNC-caU
iber team."
