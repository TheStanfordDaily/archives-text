# Upset losses hurt Stanford, Pac-1() Conference

### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
OAKLAND — At the beginning of
Pacific 10 Conference play, there was
something unusual about this season.
No, not Stanford's 3-4 noneontercncc
mark, but rather the fact that the 14th
ranked ("ardinal actually had some com
pany in the Associated Press top 25.
Willi Arizona at No. 10 and Washington
ranked eighth, the chances for a highly

competitive conference race were
promising indeed.
So just when the Pac-lOgets a bone of
respect, the Wildcats and Huskies de
cide to choke on it.
last Thursday. Arizona (S3. 2 1)
hosted a Washington State team that
had no business being in the game with
the Wildcats. Hut the Cougars stayed
even throughout and then won the game
M-bl on a 30-footerthat banked in at the
buzzer. I or all the stern denials the

Wildcats dished out after the game, they
were definitely looking ahead to their
showdown against the Huskies.
Meanwhile, across the state in
l enipe. Washington put its sterling 10-0
record on the Sun Devils chopping
blivk as Arizona State's Michelle lorn
drained a buzzer beating three-pointer
for an astounding 77-7b upset win. Sure
it was on the road, but against a team
that had lost six of its last seven confer
ence games?

I in theupset minded Pae-lOfan. Fri
day night's game in Kaiser Auditorium
would have fulfilled the toppling of the
ranked trifeeta. Hut lor .ill the improve

able to gtind out a deliberate 72-52 win
With the win. the Card remains .is the

news for Stanford, tight?
"1 \\;»s really disapminted in a way
because [the upset losses] hurts our
conference in a backwards way,"
said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "What helps us at this
point is to play and do well against
ranked teams and if they lose, that
in fact hurts us. There is a certain
sense of liking being in first place —
I'm not denying that — but it's a
backwards thing that doesn't help
us."
What adds to the Pac-l()'s frus
tration is that it truly was moving in
the right direction. Last spring, five

conference teams landed in the
NCAA tournament, and getting
Arizona and Washington ranked in
the top 10 was simply the next step.
Unfortunately, somebody forgot to
tell the pollsters that the next step
was a cliff into another mediocre
year for the Pac-10.
Not to say the conference crown
couldn't still be up for grabs — Stan
ford is still working its kinks out and
hoping senior forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele returns — but in terms of
respect on a national level, the Pac
-10 took a severe hit.
One could blame sickness, as
Arizona was. but with five experi
enced starters, they should have

known a thing or two about looking
ahead. On a brighter note, the Wild
cats did come back Saturday after
noon to trounce Washington 93-62,
so at least one team salvaged its
weekend. But as a whole, the con
ference reverting back to form is
certainly a perplexing concern.
The two losses showed "how
hard it is to win on the road." Van-
Derveer said. "Although Arizona
lost at home. So maybe it points to
having people sick — we've had a lot
of people sick — or you're overlook
ing a team which I hope our team
doesn't do. Maybe our early sched
ule will make sure that doesn't hap
pen.'"
