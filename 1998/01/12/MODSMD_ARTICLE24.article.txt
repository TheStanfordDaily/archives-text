Stanford's most successful wrestler, however,
was not B.J. Sanchez, or Zach Zimmerer, or even
All-American Scott Chapman. Saturday belonged
instead to freshman Patricia Miranda.
After a first round bye. Miranda devastated her
opponent, racking up a technical decision (a win by
more than 15 points) and generally wreaking havoc
on her unfortunate competition.
"Basically. Patricia tech d everyone except (her
opponent in the tinals). and that was the only girl
that gave her any trouble whatsoever." said fresh
man teammate Kayvon Bina. "She ravaged them."
In the championship match, Miranda took a
member of the I' S world team to overtime before
losing on a two-point back exposure.
It was her best performance since the All-Cali
fornia Open, a women's tournament at which she
won first place and earned outstanding wrestler
honors.
Juniors B J. Sanchez and Doug Bardslev fin
ished third and fourth in the 150- and 15N-pound
weight classes, respectively.
"We w»)ii some great matches and also lost some
we should have won." said head coach C hris Hor
pel. "We have our work cut out for us in order to
get ready tor Oregon State and BYU this Satur
day Monday."
Co-captains Jeff Grant and Scott Chapman did
not compete, nor did sophomore Warren McPher
son Grant strained a knee ligament Monday
against Pcnn. and Chapman has yet to return KM)
percent from his nagging elbow injury.
"We will continue with two-a-davs and can now
really start to concentrate on conditioning.'* Hor
