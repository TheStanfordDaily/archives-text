# Stanford's team play proves too much for Cal
## 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
For 10 minutes on Saturday, the
California Bears played like a team
better than its 5-5 record would sug
gest. Then reality set in.
The Bears (5-6, 1-2 Pacific 10
Conference) began the game shoot
ing to near perfection and built a 25-
20 lead almost entirely without lead
ing guard Geno Carlisle, who had
scored 2K points in his two previous
games.
But after 7-foot center Francisco
Elson left the game with his second
foul only 12 minutes into the first

half, Cal's young offense began to
play like it did during its four-game
losing streak to start the season.
Turning the ball over six times in
the last nine minutes of the first half,
Cal allowed Stanford to go on a 21-K
run to end the half.
Despite a one-man performance
by Carlisle in the second half, scor
ing 22 of the Bears' 41 points, Cal
never came together as a team and
succumbed to the Cardinal 84-74.
Cal head coach Ben Braun ad
mitted after the game that the final
score may very well have been dif
ferent had the Bears been more con
sistent.

"It was a shame to have that first
half effort go to waste toward the
end of the first half," Braun said.
"We need to exeeute better."
Three crucial traveling calls, a
five-second inbounds violation and
a turnover by senior forward Sean
Marks prevented the Bears from
mounting the prolonged attack
Braun was hoping for.
"We played in stretches of inten
sity, but to me (they were] too inter
mittent," Braun said. "If you got to
make a stand, you got to make it
long enough."
Even the Cal players seemed
surprised by their early shooting

successes. Marks, known for his in
side play, hit back-to-back jump
shots from 12 and 1K feet. Bison also
hit outside shots from 15 and 16
feet.
"I looked and said, 'This just
can't go on,' " Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery said after the
game. "They nailed shots and
caught us off guard a bit."
It was unselfish offense that gave
the Cardinal the lead for good. Sev
enteen of Stanford's final 21 points
in the first half came off assists, and
the Cardinal racked up 14 assists

Junior guard Arthur Lee dribbles through traffic Saturday. Lee and
fellow guard Kris Weems proved pivotal in Stanford s team-oriented
strategy.
from seven different players in the
first half alone.
Forward Ryan Mendez capital
ized on two Cal turnovers, burying a
three pointer and following with a
layup to tie the game at 25.

"We kind of had a memory lapse
that basketball, for our team and for
Stanford's, is an inside-out game,"
said Braun. He predicted the Cardi
nal would match up well with top
ranked North Carolina, which beat
Cal in November.
After a trey by David Moseley,
Stanford turned the focus to its inside
game with layups by Peter Sauer,
Tim Young, Arthur Lee and a mon

sterdunk by Pete Van Elswyk.
Cal never came back in the sec
ond half even with Carlisle's hot
hands. Stanford guard Kris Weems,
who finished the game with 16
points, credited the home crowd and
the Sixth Man Club for helping to
disrupt the Cal offense.
"The crowd was as they always
are — loud and obnoxious and say
ing things," Weems said.
