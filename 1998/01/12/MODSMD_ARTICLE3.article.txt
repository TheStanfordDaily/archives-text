# Forget planes and trains: alumni pioneer final frontier
## 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
The Stanford Alumni Associa
tion is making some far-out travel
plans. Literally.
The University has teamed up
with Seattle-based Zegrahm Space
Voyages to offer alumni a two-hour
tlight that will reach 1(X) kilometers
above the earth's surface â€” the de
finition of outer space.
"It's a chance to be the first
lawyer, the first banker or first com
puter programmer in space." said
the enthusiastic Susan Graven, as
sistant director of travel study pro
grams for the alumni association.
Of course, there is a price to pay
for the exotic adventure: $yB.(XX)
per person to be exact.
In addition to the space flight it
self. the cost covers four days of
Space Institute introductory lec
tures. astronaut training and tlight
preparation. Passengers, before the
actual space flight, will experience
weightlessness and a range of g
force through special simulators.
The alumni association has al
ready received one $>.(XX) trip de
posit. and ii has had 250 people re
quest information about the space
flights
"I think there are some people

very interested in being the first to
go into outer space." said Duncan
Beardsley. director of travel study
programs for the alumni associa
tion.
If all goes well and rocket
builders deliver, the first civilian as
tronauts will take off into space on
Dec. 1.2(X)1.
The plan is to have a Sky Lifter
vehicle that will elevate the Space
Cruiser to a rocket-firing altitude of
4().(XX) feet.
After takeoff, a lead pilot and ex
pedition leader will guide the six
passengers in their outer spacc
sightseeing. I he six civilian explor
ers on board will travel at about
2.3<X)mph and will be weightless for
about two minutes.
On return, the space travelers
will be greeted with a gala evening
reception. Passengers will receive
astronaut altitude wings, a com
memorative medallion, and a cer
tificate officially including them in
the Millennium Club. Earth's first
private space voyagers group
Beardsley has explored other
space travel options, but he holds
that Zegrahm Space Voy ages is def
initely the best.
"Zeerahm has a specific plan.

and, because we've worked so
heavily with them, we have a lot of
confidence in their work." he said.
Zegrahm, which conducts two to
three Stanford programs per year,
is one of the most significant opera
tors of the 20 currently used by
Stanford.
To make the trip possible, Ze
grahm joined forces with the Vir
ginia-based Vela Technology De
velopment Corporation, an aero
space company that has designed
vehicles expressly for space
tourism.
The space trip is definitely out of
this world, but exotic adventures in
general are not new to the Alumni
Association. It has been offering
trips for nearly 30 years.
"The point of the trips is that our
Stanford alumni are given the op
portunity to have the most unique
travel opportunities out there,"
Beardsley said.
For example, a Stanford group
in 1995 was the first to take a cruise
into the Persian Gulf after the Per
sian Gulf War. A Stanford group
also was on hand for the Hong
Kong Hag turnover.
"We hope to continually offer
our alumni the cutting edge in trav
el." Graven said.
