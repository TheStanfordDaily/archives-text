"That was really easy passing
around the perimeter. Maybe the
Cal team is a little fazed by this Pac
-10 environment."
"Chris Weems goes for the
shot.. .Yes. 2-0 Stanford."
"Chris is picking up right where

he left off at the Oregon game."

fkxne to the Stanford campus The
native San 1 rnnctscun s career as a
K/Sl sportscaster was horn out of
his rabid lo\e of sports.
As a sophomore, lana sought
out the station in hopes of starting a
new hobby. Alter spending his first
year "paying his dues" behind the
scenes as a station engineer, l ana
moved up to doing color commen
tary for men's basketball by his ju
nior year.
Now as a senior. Tana transmits
the play-by-play for men's basket
ball. which he finds more exciting
because of "the control you have of
broadcasting the game over the air."
Along with several of his other
colleagues, l ana spends 10 to 15
hours a week preparing or doing
broadcasts for KZSU. Preparation
includes finding information about
the opposing team and setting up
equipment.
l ana. a civil and environmental

engineering major, admits that all of
the responsibility can get a little
overwhelming but he manages to
stay sane because of his love for the
game. "In our hearts we are all fans,
and nothing beats an exciting
game," he said.
Although Tana enjoys his job as
a K/Sl I sportscaster, he is not seek
ing employment in the highly com
petitive field of broadcasting. Hut
there are others at KZSU that feel
they have found their calling in
sportscasting.
"1 love sports. I can't remember
when 1 didn't have sports in my life.
I lie opportunity to tell others about
sports on KZSU has been the best
experience in my college years."
said Ray Saloom, a senior majoring
in communication.
Saloom lias covered everything
from volleyball to women's basket
ball. 1 le joined the KZSU family his
freshman year alter attending Mu-
FuUnSun. the giant activities fair
during freshmen orientation.
After going on the air twice his

first year, Saloom got his big break.
He began covering football and
baseball. For the last two years, Sa
loom and his partner David Flem
ming. a senior, have been the main
sportscasters for Stanford women's
basketball. With the team. Saloom
has traveled everywhere from
1 iawaii to Virginia.
This year began a different expe
rience for Saloom as KZSIJ ran si
multaneous broadcasts with anoth
er local Bay Area station, KBPA.
Although KBPA is not a student
station, Saloom can be heard
around the Bay Area.
"[Broadcasting through KBPA)
is exciting and it brings more expo
sure to women's basketball," Sa
loom said.
For the future, Saloom said he
hopes for a career in sports radio
that will eventually lead to a career
in sports television. Although Sa
loom knows that sports broadcast
ing can be a tough life, "my love of
sports will get me through," he said.
As veteran KZSIJ sportscasters

such as Saloom and Tana seek out
different avenues in the real world,
they will leave behind a legacy at
KZSIJ. Several younger members
of the KZSU sports team are wait
ing in the wings to have a chance at
broadcasting Stanford athletics.
Although sophomore Chris Clat
terbuck and freshman Colin Drake
both come from small towns
Prairie Village, Kan. and Chewelah,
Wash., respectively — that do not
have local sports teams, they now
have the opportunity to enter the
world of sports broadcasting at
Stanford.
Clatterbuck covers women's vol
leyball, an assignment that has given
him the chance to travel all over the
country. Drake has not been able to
cover sports yet but has a spot on the
weekly KZSI' sports show. The
Zoo. *
Drake, who grew up listening to
Seattle Mariners' games on the
radio, said he finds happiness in
being able to relay the excitement of
games to people at home, an experi

ence he feels is "amazing."
Clatterbuck recalls a story which
he said makes his broadcasting on
KZSt I worthwhile. An elderly man,
whose vision had been repaired by
Stanford doctors in the 19305, had
followed Stanford sports faithfully
for years. When he lost his vision
forty years later, the man began lis
tening to KZSU. An avid listener
ever since, he called in one night on
a call-in radio show to show his ap

preciation.
KZSIJ sports can be heard dur
ing volleyball, football, basketball
and baseball seasons. According to
Chris Clatterbuck, all positions are
unpaid, showing that "the announc
ers commit so much time because
they truly enjoy sports radio broad
casting, and that really translates
into some of the most exciting and
involved broadcasts in the Bay
Area."
