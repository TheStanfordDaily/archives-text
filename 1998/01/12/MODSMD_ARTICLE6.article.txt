Amarillas and Drama Depart

at the Roble Dance Studies

wait/ of the 179(K to the more con
temporary swing wilt/ of today
Participants m Walt/ Weekend
can explore "how wait/ has evolved
over two centuries of change" and
can liH>k .it the wait/ "from a more
m»>dern standpoint." said aeronau
tics and astronautics graduate stu
dent l ara Rishko. one of the orga
nizers
I he event began last Friday with
registration and an informal lesson
in modern cross-step wait/ Over
the next two days. Powers said, the

Robla Danca Studio on Saturday during Waltz Waakand.
German waltz and 1830s Viennese
waltzes and continued with the Vic
torian Polka Redowa and the 1 *->*■)( )s
swing waltz I he event ended Sun
day with two further lessons in the
cross-step waltz and a speech on the
"Higher States of Waltzing" b\
Powers.
But Waltz Weekend is about
more than mere waltzing. Partici
pants "may learn ... new variations
of the waltz, but that's not the pur
pose'* of Waltz Weekend. Powers
said. Instead, "the purpose is to en
hance the experience of waltzing"
by attaining, through dance, "an en
hanced state of receptivity to what's
around you ... Any verbal descrip
tion would do the experience injus

tice." he claimed.
Powers founded the Waltz
Weekend last October at a farm in
northern Georgia. There, partici
pants from across the country were
able to "look at the waltz and get a
sense of its history and lineage." said
Powers, a self-styled "dance histori
an."
According to him. that first Waltz
Weekend was a success. However,
many Stanford waltzers were unable
to attend due to excessive travel
costs. For this reason, and through
the urging of one of his students.
Powers and several others began
planning for a Waltz Weekend to be
held at Stanford, using the Georgia
Waltz Weekend as a model.
The result: an event which had
succeeded before it had even begun.
The initial response "was over
whelming," said graduate student

and co-organizer Chan Meng
Chong.
He noted that the northern Bay
Area has one of the most active
dance communities in the country.
"The response was much higher
than expected." Powers agreed.
Even though participants were re
quired to have prior waltzing experi
ence. the 110 available spaces "filled
up in one day. Some of my favorite
students had to be put on the waiting
list." he said.
With the Stanford Waltz Week
end a success. Powers said he may
organize a second Waltz Weekend
here next quarter if demand proves
sufficient. He also plans to expand to
other venues, including Boulder,
Colo, in May and Atlanta and New
Orleans soon after. Prague and St.
Petersburg are also under consider
ation.
