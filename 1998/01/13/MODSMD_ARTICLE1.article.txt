# Jones condemns Tuskeegee
## Federal syphilis study took science too far, speaker says

Researchers sometimes wrongfully justify morally
questionable experiments in the name of scientific
progress. Dr. James Jones told a crowd of about 150 in
Fairchild Auditorium yesterday.
The U.S. Public Health Service's Tuskegee
Syphilis Study was such a case, said Jones, who spoke
as part of Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration Week.
The associate history professor at the University of
Texas and author of "Bad Blood" said the Tuskegee
experiment — carried out in Macon County, Ala.,
from 1932 to 1972 — began as an attempt by the U.S.
Public Health Service to learn more about syphilis and
discover treatments for the African-American popu
lation.
In addition to free meals, free medical exams and
burial insurance, the hundreds of black male subjects
believed that they were being treated for syphilis.
In place of adequate treatment, however, aspirin
and iron tonic were given, in order for the researchers
to record the natural progression of the disease.
"The Tuskegee experiment was a racist study,"
Jones said.
The study, originally intended to last six months,
actually went on for 40 years. This was due in large
part to the growing fascination with the progression of
untreated syphilis and the roles of certain physicians
and researchers in reviving the experiment, he said.
"There is an irony here in studying untreated
syphilis in order to find syphilis treatment," Jones
noted.
The terms "untreated study" is an absolute mis
nomer. he said. "The experiment was fatally flawed
from the outside."
