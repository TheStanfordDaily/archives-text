# Jones condemns Tuskeegee
## Federal syphilis study took science too far, speaker says 
### Alice Lah 
Researchers sometimes wrongfully justify morally
questionable experiments in the name of scientific
progress. Dr. James Jones told a crowd of about 150 in
Fairchild Auditorium yesterday.
The U.S. Public Health Service's Tuskegee
Syphilis Study was such a case, said Jones, who spoke
as part of Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration Week.
The associate history professor at the University of
Texas and author of "Bad Blood" said the Tuskegee
experiment — carried out in Macon County, Ala.,
from 1932 to 1972 — began as an attempt by the U.S.
Public Health Service to learn more about syphilis and
discover treatments for the African-American popu
lation.
In addition to free meals, free medical exams and
burial insurance, the hundreds of black male subjects
believed that they were being treated for syphilis.
In place of adequate treatment, however, aspirin
and iron tonic were given, in order for the researchers
to record the natural progression of the disease.
"The Tuskegee experiment was a racist study,"
Jones said.
The study, originally intended to last six months,
actually went on for 40 years. This was due in large
part to the growing fascination with the progression of
untreated syphilis and the roles of certain physicians
and researchers in reviving the experiment, he said.
"There is an irony here in studying untreated
syphilis in order to find syphilis treatment," Jones
noted.
The terms "untreated study" is an absolute mis
nomer. he said. "The experiment was fatally flawed
from the outside."

James Jones speaks to an audience at Fairchild Auditorium on the
Tuskeegee Syphilis Study.
Jones said that the subjects were
never given the option of quitting
the study and never received ade
quate treatment for their disease.
Iven when penicillin became the
"wonder drug lor treating syphilis"
in 1947. the subjects were not of
fered any.
Jones explained how the nature
of the experiment shifted during this
period, from "not offering treatment
to these subjects for the purposes of
studs to the active denying of treat
ment."
He s.nd that throughout this
study, several issues were ignored,
such ;ts the well-being ;md health of
the subjects and the morality of the
experiment. "What is the price we
indulge lor the sake of scientific
study?" he asked.
I he study officially ended in No
vember 1972. when the federal assis
tant secretary for health and scientif
ic affairs appointed an ad hoc adviso
ry panel to review the study, as a re

sult of a New York Times story. The
nine panel members concluded that
the subjects of the study were misled
and that the I uskegee experiment
was "ethically unjustified."
Jones called the experiment a
"blast of moral outrage" that has im
peded the efforts of physicians to
conduct research on the African-
American population decades after
wards.
"Medicine has to be based or
trust. The I uskegee experimeni
continues to harm that relationship
today." he said. " I uskegee is the
metaphor for malpractice, mistrust
ill will and suspicion."
Monetary compensation was
given to the study participants in the
aftermath of the experiment, as well
as free medical and burial services to
all living participants.
As a result of the study, the Na
tional Commission for the Protec
tion of Human Subjects of Biomed
ical and Behavioral Research was
created. In addition, an ethics advi
sory board was established in the late
1970s to review the ethical issues of
biomedical research.
