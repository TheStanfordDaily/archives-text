## Iraq blocks U.N. inspectors Government claims that American team leader is a spy 
### 
BAGHDAD. Iraq (AP) — Iraq will
block U.N. weapons inspections led hv
an American Gulf War veteran it says is
a spy. the government vowed yesterday,
setting the stage for a new confrontation
with the United Nations.
In New York. U.N. chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler said the moni
toring teams — including the one led by
ex-Marine (apt. Scott Hitler would
go ahead with their work as planned
today.
Iraq has criticized Hitter, claiming he
is an intelligence agent for the United
States. Kilter denies the charge.
An Iraqi government spokesman said
the presence of too many Americans on
the teams was prolonging the inspections
program and delaying the lifting of I I.N.
sanctions on Iraq, the official Iraqi News
Agency reported.
The agency's statement came after
Hitter and a team of U.N. inspectors
reportedly visited a hospital and a prison
in Baghdad. It said the ban on Hitter
would begin Jan. 13.
Other U.N. inspection teams will be
allowed to continue their work, said
Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Ham

doon.
Butler, in a letter to the Security
Council, cited numerous U.N. declara
tions affirming that Iraq has no right to
dictate the composition of the inspection
teams.
"I propose to instruct the chief
inspector (in Baghdad) to seek to pro
ceed with his business tomorrow. 13 Jan
uary, and if possible, until the planned
program ol inspections is completed,"
Butler said.
I lie inspectors are trying to verify
that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of
mass destruction, a condition that must
be met before the United Nations will
lift trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after
its I WO invasion of Kuwait.
In Washington. President Clinton
said the I nited States Has kid "nothing
whatsoever" to do with choosing mem
bers of the U.N. teams.
"Certainly Saddam Hussein shouldn't
be able to pick and choose who does this
work," Clinton said. "That's for the
I 'nited Nations to decide."
He said he expects the I J.N. Security
Council to take strong action il the
inspectors "are denied their right to do

their job."
The American ambassador to the
United Nations. Bill Richardson. s;nd
the Iraqi move would be discussed at a
Security Council meeting Thursday.
"Iraq is up to its old tricks." Richard
son said in Palm Beach. I la.. "We feel
the Security Council should make a
strong response."
In November. Iraq ordered American
inspectors out of the country on the
grounds they were spies. The United
Nations then withdrew all of its inspec
tors in protest, and the I'nited States
started a military buildup 111 the Gull
that continues.
I lie inspectors were allowed to return
a week later under a Russian-brokered
deal. Inspections have resumed without
confrontation since then, although Iraq
still refuses to allow inspectors into Pres
ident Saddam Hussein's palaces and
other so-called sensitive sites.
Yesterday, the Iraqi government
spokesman said Hitter's team which
included nine Americans, live Britons, a
Russian and an Australian would not
be allowed to continue until it was
reformed in a balanced manner.
