NEW HAVEN. Conn. (AP) â€” Was
Michael Person born to kill?
Defense lawyers hope to pose the ques
tion to a jury deciding whether to convict
Person of murder or manslaughter. For
now. it's up to the judge whether to admit
a psychiatrist's theory that some people
may be born with a predisposition toward
violence.
Prosecutors call the opinion of Dr.
James R. Merikangas hogwash. I hc\ said
Person threatened former girlfriend
Leshea Pouncey, then plotted her murder

out of jealousy after she became involved
with another man.
Merikangas' theory "has not gained
general acceptance in the scientific com
munity." prosecutor Michael Dearington
told Superior Court Judge Ronald Fra
casse last week. "It is not reliable evi
dence."
I racasse is expected to issue a decision
today.
Defense attorneys want to show Person
was born with a disposition to kill, or that
such an inclination was produced by brain

damage suffered after birth. It jurors
believe it. the\ could convict him on the
lesser charge of manslaughter.
I le could get up to life on *i murder con
viction while manslaughter carries a maxi
mum 20-year term.
While mam psychiatrists have linked
brain damage to violent outbursts.
Merikangas. a Yale School ot Medicine
neurologist who has examined over I<H)
convicted killers, uses .1 radiological scan
that measures blood flow to different
regions of the brain.
