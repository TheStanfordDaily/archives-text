## An ineffective ASSU 
### 
Andrus and Decker have
championed few changes,
reforms or initiatives

LIKE PRESIDENT Clinton" s perfor
mance over the last few months,
ASSU President Emily Andrus'
leadership has lacked energy.
Last spring she and Vice President Ben
Decker promised to be vocal on the behalf
of student concerns and attempt to "get the
ASSU in order." While meeting with
administrators is a good first step to estab
lishing a positive student / administration
relationship. Andrus and Decker have yet
to move beyond this and actually take
action.
Andrus and Decker originally set out the
following goals: filling the empty student
seats on University committees, revamping
the ASSIJ's group funding procedures,
bringing back the Lake Lagunita Bonfire
and improving student services, such as
making the Career Planning and Placement
Center more accessible to students major
ing in the humanities or social sciences.
Although talks have occurred, there has
been no real progress on either the group
funding procedures or the improvement of
the CPPC. While a career fair for humani
ties and social science majors is being orga
nized for this spring, for this year's senior
class such action is too little too late. And as
we all know there was no bonfire in Lake
Lag to commemorate the l(X)th Big Game.
Filling student seats on University com
mittees. the responsibility of the Nomina

tions Commission, did occur. Because this
is Nom Comm's sole responsibility, howev
er. it is not an accomplishment worthy of
extensive recc>gnition.
Another supposed achievement, the
Bookstore advisory committee, formed to
ease relations between the Bookstore and
frustrated students, came at the impetus of
Students Monitoring Organizations on
Campus, not the ASSU. SMOC pushed to
lower Bookstore prices and to create a
Bookstore alternative for students.
The ASSU did not take a truly active
lead on the Bookstore issue — it simply
help to form yet another committee to deal
with a problem.
The ASSU has also failed in its efforts to
encourage administrative outreach to stu
dents. Indeed administrative outreach this
year has occurred almost solely thanks to
our enthusiastic Vice Provost for Student
Affairs James Montoya, who began month
ly meetings for University administrators to
address current student issues.
Moreover the ASSU has failed to pro
vide a forum for students to voice concerns
to the administration through an event such
as last year's Cookies and Tea.
They are only just now issuing student
surveys to study how to maximize space for
student groups and to investigate student
group funding needs.
The one accomplishment of the ASSU
so far this year — progress on an ASSU
Course Guide — has come from Deputy
Senate Chair Matt Spence. This is where
the real energy can been seen.
Finally, Andrus has actually missed two
of the five ASSU senate meetings.
Emily Andrus. get off automatic pilot.
