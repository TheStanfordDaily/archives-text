## Destroy that group centrism 
### 
WHEN 1 WAS
riding home
from the airport
yesterday after a job inter
view. my older brother
and I began talking about
what one might call a
'groupcentric' perspective

on the world. Specifically, he talked about
how some co-workers had been with his
company for so long that they think and act
as though they possess some kind of tran
scendent knowledge of the world.
These people spend so much time
focused on a particular esoteric subject that
this subject becomes not only their world,
but it also becomes virtually all that matters
for them and, sometimes, all that they think
matters for anyone.
This concern has certainly been in the
back of my mind as I have thought about
my life after Stanford. 1 am going to work
for at least a little while before attending
more school. Although 1 would like an
engaging job, I am deeply worried about
finding such engagement at the risk of
becoming lost in it.
For instance, people can spend a good
portion of their lives developing a market
ing image or the technology for diapers.
And beyond that, some people literally
become egocentric enough to think that
their work on diapers is somehow more
important than the majority of the rest of
the world.
Now, groupcentricism is far from being
something particular to corporate fanatics.
In fact, it is basic to human nature in that we
all have the tendency to somehow believe
that one's perspective is superior to anoth

er's or that what "I do is more important
than what you do."
When I say that this tendency is some
how basic to the wiring of our "human
nature," I don't intend to use the phrase
lightly. Self-concerned qualities of the
human being have embedded themselves
largely as a result of evolution and natural
selection. If your Neanderthal ancestors
had not possessed the quality of protecting
themselves and their families, their kind
would have grown extinct.
Simple enough.
And it's also simple enough to see that
this genetic encoding extends to the modern
day, thereby leading us to focus on our
selves and our "kind" — even if our kind is
that which sells diapers. But what is not sim
ple to swallow despite its incredible perva
siveness in every human being is how our
group-focused mechanism manifests itself
in so many hideous ways that humankind
sometimes deeply suffers.
Sometimes, these manifestations are
easy to isolate, particularly when their
effects are catastrophic. For example, pos
sessing the strong opinion that "my country
is superior to your country" quickly and all
too frequently leads to disasters of neglect
for other human lives. The same is quite
true with respect to cultural and ethnic atti
tudes as well.
Of course, the examples are not limited
to such extreme and direct cases. There are
other instances that, while being clearly
illustrative of groupcentricism, seem rela
tively benign. Such as: "The Yankees are
going to kick Red Sox butt!" or "My child is
an honors student at Frozen Lake Elemen
tary School (and yours is not!)."

However, other group-glorifying atti
tudes may seem harmless but, in actuality,
have unnecessarily miserable results. Con
sider the example of Stanford groupcentri
cisni (or simply, elitism).
One's Stanford elitist attitude may not
be much of a problem while one is among
Stanford people (as is the case lor the dia
per maker among diaper makers); in the
rest of the world, it poses serious potential
for personal stagnation. Judging another,
consciously or unconsciously, on the basis
of a person's educational background is a
pitiful form of thinking.
Unfortunately, when it comes to group
centric factors, one typically judges another
on an unconscious, hidden level. As a result,
if you suffer from "Stanfordcentricism" —
you not only fail to see beyond labels or
titles of those with different educations, you
fail to see how it affects you. In the extreme
case of Stanfordcentricism, one has seem
ingly strong relationships with Stanford
people but is incapable of developing them
with others.
All in all, before we can better purge
ugly, biased perspectives of the "other"
(regardless of the source of the perspec
tive), we must uncover many of the uncon
scious groupcentric factors that litter our
own minds. It's natural to be a part of a
group or community — whether it he a fam
ily. friends or diaper makers. Hut when we
start thinking about what a poor slob that
stranger is, we should remember who the
slob really is.

Jon Servaites, who completed his under
graduate studies in chemical engineering in
December, never plans to work on diapers.
