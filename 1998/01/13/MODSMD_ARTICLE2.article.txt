# Students tutor low-income students for SAT
## Prepping for the future 
### Ruby Marquez 
While most Stanford students spend their
Tuesday nights studying, seniors Rebeeea
Bowen and Stephen Garrison are helping high
sehool students prepare for the test that will
allow them to attend college: the SATs.
Every Tuesday night Bowen and Garrison
lead a group of 15 high school sophomores and
juniors through vocabulary and English drills in
preparation for the verbal section of the SAT
with the help of donated books.
Although most SAT preparation courses can
cost up to $ I,(XX), this one is free. All students are
from low-income families living in either East
Palo Alto or Redwood City and would other
wise be unable to afford to take such a course.
Bowen came up with the idea to start free
SAT classes for disadvantaged students while
working at an expensive SAT preparation
course full of wealthy students.

Also a tutor in East Palo Alto. Bowen said
many of the disadvantaged students were scared
by the SATs because they historically have not
received the high scores needed for admissions
to competitive universities.
"Ii is unfair that people can pay to up their
scores." Bowen said. "We wanted to equalize
the playing field."
Garrison, a public policy major, joined the
program after meeting Bowen in the spring
through Stanford in Washington.
"I saw a tremendous opportunity to help
some folks." he said. "These are really grateful
kids."
Bowen and (Jarrison said the go;il of the six
week program, which started in ()ctober. was to
reach as many students as possible. I he\ said
they would like to see these students have the
tools to go to college and succeed.
"(These students) have their own initiative to
learn and realize the importance of
the program," (iarrison said.
Bowen. a history major whose
goal is to become a high school
teacher, said this program also bene
fits her. She hopes to develop her
teaching skills by participating in it.
"| leaching these students] is so
rewarding and inspiring." Bowen
said.
(iarrison agrees. "It's great to see
these kids from the beginning to end
and see a real tangible effect. I've
gotten more out of this than any of
the kids have."

The entire program is funded hv
community groups at no cost to the
students, according to Darcv
Wright, direcor of the (ioldcn Steps
Youth Foundation. Sponsors in
clude 1 the Boys and (iirls ( luh of the
Peninsula, the Bridge Program at
Mcnlo-Atherton High School and
the Fast Track Program.
Currently, the program is looking
to expand by offering preparation
for the mathematics section of the
SAT.
The program is seeking volun
teers who are willing to teach and
mentor motivated students and who
have communication skills. Anyone
