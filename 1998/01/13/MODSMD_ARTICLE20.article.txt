Finger pointing about
"sexism " does no good
I didn't read the article from the Jan. 7
issue that apparently "presented sexist per
spectives." so I don't have an opinion about
whether or not it was indeed sexist in
nature. However, I did read Del Powers'
shallow attempt to dissect the perceived
sexism, and I found it disturbing.
First of all (and least importantly). Pow
ers did not offer any solutions. I hate it
when people complain about problems but
do not offer any advice or words of wisdom
to help alleviate them. What good does it
do to just complain? Are you the moral
police, telling everyone who reads The
Daily that you have your eyes on the issue
and that you will point your finger and

write a letter everytime someone writes a
sexist article, so they better watch out? IJh
oh Ihe sexists and racists out there better
shape up.
Second, Powers apparently suffers from
some of the same afflictions that make peo
ple sexist and racist in the first place. When
Powers asserts that the descriptions used to
describe a new female prosecutor wouldn't
be used to describe a new male prosecutor,
she states as a known fact something that is
essentially an opinion based on incomplete
knowledge. Powers doesn't really KNOW
what words the author would have used had
the article been about a man, anymore than
she KNOWS that an employer would "take
it for granted that a MAN is able to work
long hours."
It's unfair to be so presumptuous, and
it's dangerous to jump to conclusions such
as this, even to further some moral agenda.

The essence of sexism and racism is of
course, "prejudice," which, quite literally
means, "to prejudge." Another way to say
this is "to draw conclusions prematurely."
Of this Powers is guilty. It seems her emo
tions got the better of her.
Third, even if Dean of Students Marc
Wais. the man quoted in the original article
WOULD have used different words to
describe a male prosecutor, that wouldn't
by itself make his description of the female
prosecutor sexist. Did Powers ever think
that maybe it's unfair to men to not call
them "wonderful and delightful"? Probably
not. Maybe calling a new employee
"delightful" and "wonderful" shouldn't be
viewed as condescension, but as the stan
dard description for someone whom you
respect, admire and look forward to work
ing with.
C alling a woman "wonderful" is no more

sexist than calling a black person "a good
athlete" is racist. Sure, in both cases the
terms MIGHT be loaded, and the speaker
MIGHT be sexist or MIGHT be racist,
respectively — but not necessarily. Insofar
as the descriptions are accurate (maybe she
really IS "wonderful." maybe he really IS "a
good athlete"), we should keep our imagi
nations in check and refrain from injecting
our fears and insecurities into every conver
sation. Shucks, I'm black and I happen to
like being called "a good athlete." I'm also
male, and I wish more people (other than
my mom) WOULD call me "wonderful." I
could really get in to that. I'd probably put
it on my resume—
If the prosecutor was described as "pret
ty smart for a broad," or as "a hard worker
— plus she's got a nice ass." that would
probably be sexist. Wonderful and delight
ful" probably is not. Most real sexism prob

ably falls somewhere in between. In the
meantime, Powers should relax a little bit
and remember that those words are (on the
face at least) all compliments. Maybe the
real problem is not sexism, but a much sim
pler one than Powers realizes: that males in
general are simply too macho to describe
other males as "wonderful and delightful,"
"dynamic and energetic."
See, maybe women have it pretty good,
being freely described in such glowing
terms. Men never get to hear stuff like that.
We have feelings Ux). We also want to feel
love. However, it will probably be a long
time before some guy comes up to me and
says, "You know what. Dawg? You're look
ing mighty effervescent today!" ... but it
would be worth the wait.
