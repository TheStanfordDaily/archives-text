# Anything for the kids
## An open letter to the people of California 
### 
Garry Grundy

IN YEARS PAST, many great things
have come from your state. Progressive
politics, thrilling movies, cheap wine in
a box. In the past, your state has given
states like mine, a reason to follow the
Golden Bear — politically, culturally, eco
nomically.
Well, some things must always come to
an end.
Because your state stands in diametric
opposition to the American dream, I ask
that you cut all your tics with the United
States ol America; secede from the I Jnion.
Get out!
And start your own damn country. Seri
ously.
Just stop infecting the rest of this great
nation with your bestialized laws and your
entirely vacuous culture. You can seal off
your borders all you want when you leave
the Union: I'll lend an arm to build that 40
foot wall your governor wants to erect to
protect whatever integrity your country
will have left. Just take your shit, and leave.
But on your way out. would you mind
leaving the Colorado River in the care of
its rightful owners — the Grand Canyon
State?
I think we'll all be much happier this
way with you gone from the Union; you

have tainted the rest of the nation long
enough: your anti-immigrant sentiments
and your unwillingness to throw unequivo
cal support behind women and people of
color has corrupted and twisted every ele
ment of the American ethos.
Do us a favor and leave the I Jnion now!
For years, we've looked westward at the
Golden State and sang your praises: Tu
pac's "California Love" and LL's "Goin'
Back to Cali." In my youth, your welcome
mat was the one I was most familiar with:
"Welcome to California: The Golden
State" — Home of Mickey and Minnie,
Louie, Dewy ... and Hughies Hefner and
McDuck; Hollywood and the Pacific sun
where dreams come true.
For real?
Now, after four years of living in the
great state of California, I know how that
sign should have truly read: "Welcome to
California. A great place to visit but you
don't wanna go to school here, get sick
here, be arrested here, smoke here or be
poor. Mexican, black, gay. old. young, a
felon or a female here."
That's more like it.
Let's face it. you guys would love your
own country. No longer under the scrutiny
of the U.S. Supreme Court or the rest of

the American people, Fiirher Wilson can
make up all of the laws he desires.
It's all good, the Grand "Whiz Tsar"
Wilson can absolve us all simply by call
ing for your republic's sweet secession.
States like mine will no longer feel inclined
to follow you (as we have in the past) if you
have left the Union. The cancer will be
contained — simply by lobbing off the
right arm.
A painful separation indeed ... cutting
off the sixth largest economy in the world.
Hut to salvage the name and integrity of
the American people, all that talk of dol
lars and cents becomes moot; can we put a
price on our country's good name?
I he people of California have made me
ashamed to be an American. (In contrast
to the good ol' boys in the Republic of
Texas, a state which makes me proud of
the U.S.A.)
California's got its police brutality,
abortion, xenophobia, veganism and insti
tutionalized racism ... the rest of us have
had enough!
Consider how making California a sepa
rate country, will meet all of your wonder
fully myopic needs in the Golden Country.
For starters, you could now funnel all the
state's money into instituting strict pass-

port controls. This way. you could "protect
the integrity of your country's borders"
and ensure no unwanted residents (i.e.
Mexicans) are let into the state.
Hell, under your newly self-styled
national government, you could introduce
martial law in the ghettos of your larger
cities, keeping those niggers and those
spies from penetrating all that you hold
holy, thus protecting your newly engen
dered "sanctified constitutional rights."
Because K2 percent of you all don't
smoke anyway, you can prohibit smoking
too ... kinda like the blacks and the Mexi
cans. it's hazardous to many Californians'
health.
The governor's mainly.
But don't get the wrong idea, in the new
Democratic-Republic of California there
shall be not just prohibition, but special
freedoms too!
Pot. All the pot you can smoke. Sounds
bizarre to me ... it's less of crime to smoke
pot in California than a goddamn cigarette.
Isn't that a bit suspect?
Not so. It's California logic. It's all good.
Let us not forget a bagel and coffee
shop at every corner. And juice bars, and
gyms and dietitians galore! Rights all over
the place. In the newly formed California

Republic, you can do just about anything
Even the right to kill an unborn infant,
err ... fetus, will be legal up until the
month in the new. openly pro-choice coun
try of ( alifornia.
Hell, they may even permit cigarette
smoking in certain instances 111 order to
facilitate the abortion.
So far. so good?
You know this is what you want.
I know it's what I want.
("all your Grand Whiz Tsar; get the
Fiihrer on the phone, and tell him that you
"like want California to like get out of the
Union." Tell him to pull the president out
of those meetings with his lawyer, and
grant him his blessing so that the Golden
State can become the Golden Country.
Familiar with the politics of this coun
try. that could take a while: maybe San
Andreas will have heard our nation's cries
by then and California will crash into the
Pacific — a sort of natural secession?
1 just hope that I make it back to Ari
zona in time to claim the new beach front
property.
