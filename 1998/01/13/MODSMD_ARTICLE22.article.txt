# Germ warfare difficult to control
## Nobelist Lederberg speaks in Campbell on international threats from biological war 
### James Pritchard Contributing writer 
It is impossible to tell whether bi
ological researeh is intended for pur
poses of warfare until an actual
weapon is created, Nobel laureate
Joshua Lederberg told a standing
room-only crowd at Campbell
Recital Hall yesterday.
The eventual use of conventional
weapons is clear throughout their
development, making them easier to
control than biological weapons,
Lederberg said in a talk on "Germs
as Arms: What Progress to Control"
sponsored by the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control.
"Almost any agent which might
be used for biological warfare has a
very good reason to be used for
peaceful purposes," he said. "There
is nothing that is so deeply dual-use."
Until the point when it is used as a

weapon, it is impossible to deter
mine whether biological work is in
tended for medicine or defense, he
said. A vaccine and an agent of germ
warfare could share the same back
ground scientific research.
Lederberg, who received the
Nobel Prize for medicine in 1958 at
the age of 33 for his discoveries con
cerning genetic recombination, re
turned to Stanford to present his
talk. He is a former professor of ge
netics at Stanford's School of Medi
cine, as well a professor and presi
dent emeritus at Rockefeller Uni
versity.
His speech discussed the history
of biological warfare and its current
relevance for global affairs. Leder
berg emphasized the sensitivity of
the United Nations' investigation
into Iraq's supposed possession of
biological weapons. Yesterday, Iraq
complicated the issue by ordering a

halt to U.N. weapons inspections.
Still, Lxderberg was somewhat
positive about the current state of af
fairs. He said an international treaty
signed in 1975, which is the current
legal framework for regulating bio
logical weapons, has "greatly slowed
the [biological] technology develop
ment."
He added, "I think for that we
should be very grateful."
However, stability could rapidly
deteriorate at the onset of biological
terrorism. "Terrorism is moving
away from the theater and moving to
the aggressive killing of massive
amounts of people," he said.
Although biological warfare has
yet to become a standard form of ter
rorism. Lederberg pointed out. "the
hijacking of airplanes never hap
pened until the first one."
The United States is currently or
ganizing a civil defense against bio

logical terrorism by training some
local law enforcement agencies to be
prepared for a possible outbreak
such ;is anthrax. I he piocess has re
quired the coordination ol the De
partment of Defense and various na
tional health organizations, which is
not an easy task. Lederberg said.
He added that the burden ol eon
cern has shifted to primarily regional
interests. I he relationship between
Pakistan and India and the situation
in the Middle East were his biggest
worries, with the Iraq situation his
paramount concern.
Instead of competing for
weapons technology, countries
should be working together to light
jjerm warfare, he said.
"Germs are the enemies of hu
mankind. and v\e have a common
cause against them." he said. "We
should be doing much more about it
on a global scale."
