## Rain cannot stop Card at Invite All-Stanford final for men 
### Jessica Lan Contributing writer 
Stanford's men's tennis team came out
on top this weekend at the National Colle
giate Tennis Classic even though there
were no winners.
Rain in the San Fernando Valley
brought the tournament to an early halt,
but there was no question that Stanford
had the upper hand throughout the tour
nament.
The doubles tournament was canceled
entirely because of the weather condi
tions, but the players were able to com
plete all but one of the singles matches.
Play began Saturday morning at Sher
wood Country Club after a rained-out Fri
day. All the Stanford players were seeded,
making up four of the top six seeds, and
Ryan Wolters was the only Stanford play
er forced to play in the first round. Wolters
defeated Shane Hurst of Boise State 6-0.
6-3, easily advancing to the second round.
Each Stanford player won his match in
the second round, advancing to the quar
terfinals. Mike Bryan eliminated Alex De
cret of UCLA in two sets (0-4. 6-4). while
Ryan Wolters defeated Jason Cook, also
of UCLA, 6-4,6-3. Paul Goldstein, return
ing from a quarter away from Stanford,
handled Miehuel Blue of Texas in two sets,
6-1,6-3. Bob Bryan defeated Mike Jessup
of Pepperdine 6-1,6-7.6-4.
In the quarterfinals, Mike Bryan won

over Daniel Merkert of Boise State (6-1,6-
3). Wolters beat USC's Kyle Spencer 6-2.
7-6, and Goldstein defeated Robert Lind
stedt (Pepperdine) in three sets, 6-4,6-7,6-
4.1 iowever. Bob Bryan, the top seed, was
upset in the quarterfinals by Matt Breen of
UCLA, 6-3.6-4.
Breen was then defeated in the semis
by Wolters. who dropped the first set 4-6
but came back to win the last two sets 6-3
and 6-4. Bryan's and Goldstein's wins in
the quarters set up a Stanford semifinal in

which Bryan defeated Goldstein 6-4. 6-2.
Wolters' and Bryan's semifinal wins
would have created a Stanford final, hut
because of the rain delays on Friday, there
was not enough time for the finals.
"I doubt they (Wolters and Bryan) will
ever play," said head coach Dick Gould. "I
don't really see a need for it. I was a good
performance all the way around from
everyone."
