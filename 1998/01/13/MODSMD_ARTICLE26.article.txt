But No. 11 Stanford (6-5,3-1) was riding a
four-game win streak and had not dropped a
conference game since the 1994-95 season (a
period spanning 4K games). Arizona had
never taken a Pac-10 game away from the
Card. But the Wildcats hoped they were due
a change of luck, and it finally came on a
buzzer-beating jumper from freshman guard
Reshea Bristol for a 91-90 Arizona win.
"Everybody stepped up their game." Bris
tol said. "When we play as a team we can beat
anybody. [The win) helps our program, and it
helps our confidence. We're on our way to a
Pac-10 Championship."
Right from the opening tip the game
proved to be the most exciting the Cardinal
has participated in all year. Stanford jumped
out to a 6-0 lead behind two free throws and
a jumper from senior forward Heather
Owen, who saw limited playing time due to
cramping and scored just seven points.
The six-point lead was the largest of the
half as the score went back and forth. The
Wildcats took a one-point lead with 11 min
utes. 13 seconds to go in the half on a three
point basket by senior forward Mikko Gior
dano. Giordano finished with 10 points off
the bench as Arizona placed five players in
double figures for the game.
But the Cardinal had six in double figures,
and every time Arizona seemed to be making
a move in the first half Stanford found the an
swer to silence the crowd. With 34 seconds
left senior forward Kristin Folkl look the

pass from junior center Chandra Benton and
made the jumper for two of her team-high 21
points to go along with 10 rebounds After
four tics and as many lead changes. Folkl s
bucket made the score 39-36 Stanford head
ing into the locker room.
When the second half commenced it ap
peared that Arizona's luck had run out.
Sophomore guard Milena Flores hit a zone,
scoring five points and notching two assists as
Stanford stretched its lead to 13 at the 12:23
mark on a free throw from Nygaard. Flores
would finish the game with 16 points (sec
ond-best on the team) and five assists.
"The last two years we've gone 18-0 in the
conference." said head coach lara Van-
Derveer. "There are some players out there
who have never beaten Stanford, and 1 would
think you get them your last time as a senior
