ford 9()

But No. 11 Stanford (6-5,3-1) was riding a
four-game win streak and had not dropped a
conference game since the 1994-95 season (a
period spanning 4K games). Arizona had
never taken a Pac-10 game away from the
Card. But the Wildcats hoped they were due
a change of luck, and it finally came on a
buzzer-beating jumper from freshman guard
Reshea Bristol for a 91-90 Arizona win.
"Everybody stepped up their game." Bris
tol said. "When we play as a team we can beat
anybody. [The win) helps our program, and it
helps our confidence. We're on our way to a
Pac-10 Championship."
Right from the opening tip the game
proved to be the most exciting the Cardinal
has participated in all year. Stanford jumped
out to a 6-0 lead behind two free throws and
a jumper from senior forward Heather
Owen, who saw limited playing time due to
cramping and scored just seven points.
The six-point lead was the largest of the
half as the score went back and forth. The
Wildcats took a one-point lead with 11 min
utes. 13 seconds to go in the half on a three
point basket by senior forward Mikko Gior
dano. Giordano finished with 10 points off
the bench as Arizona placed five players in
double figures for the game.
But the Cardinal had six in double figures,
and every time Arizona seemed to be making
a move in the first half Stanford found the an
swer to silence the crowd. With 34 seconds
left senior forward Kristin Folkl look the

pass from junior center Chandra Benton and
made the jumper for two of her team-high 21
points to go along with 10 rebounds After
four tics and as many lead changes. Folkl s
bucket made the score 39-36 Stanford head
ing into the locker room.
When the second half commenced it ap
peared that Arizona's luck had run out.
Sophomore guard Milena Flores hit a zone,
scoring five points and notching two assists as
Stanford stretched its lead to 13 at the 12:23
mark on a free throw from Nygaard. Flores
would finish the game with 16 points (sec
ond-best on the team) and five assists.
"The last two years we've gone 18-0 in the
conference." said head coach lara Van-
Derveer. "There are some players out there
who have never beaten Stanford, and 1 would
think you get them your last time as a senior

Senior center Olympia Scott and the rest
of the 11th-ranked Cardinal struggled at
the tree-throw line last night against Ari
zona. Scott was only 3 of 9 from the line
while the team was only 7 of 22 in the sec
ond half.
you'd come oul and play with a lot
of pride."
Hut while Arizona was playing
with pride, the Card was having
trouble with the free throw line. In
the second half Stanford was just
seven of 22 from the charity stripe.
Scott and Peterson also picked up
their fourth personals, and when
Scott sat down with her fourth at
8:58 Arizona had cut the lead to six.
Stanford pushed it hack to 10 at
7:54 on a huge three pointer from
Christina Batastini. The sopho
more guard only took three shots in
the game — all three pointers, all in
the second half — and buried all
three of them as she finished with 10
points in just 12 minutes.
But Arizona wouldn't go away,
and a wide-open layup from Barnes
gave the Wildcats a 82-81 lead
(their first ol the half) with 3:23 to
play. But Flores answered on the
next trip down the court with a lean
ing juniper and one of two free
throws from Scott at the 2:44 mark
made the score 84-82 Stanford.
"I think Stanford is a great bas
ketball team." said Arizona head
coach Joan Bonvicini. "But we've
closed the gap. Arizona has gotten
better and has confidence. We
didn't want to lose again."

Barnes tied the score with two
free throws, but Folkl added two
more points to regain the lead for
the Card. And that's when Bristol
took over. A three-pointer from the
5-foot-10 guard gave Arizona an 87-
86 lead with 1:53 remaining. Bristol
was seven of eight in the second half
including three-of-four from be
hind the arc, but her biggest basket
was still to come.
A Folkl free throw tied the con
test at 87, and a defensive stop
seemingly gave Stanford control of
the game with just over a minute to
go. Flores dribbled the ball up and
was bumped hard by sophomore
guard Felecity Willis at halfcourt.
Flores pleaded for the call as Willis
picked up the ball and dribbled in
for the layup and the 8 l )-87 lead.
Again the Cardinal had control,
but the Wildcat defense was swarm
ing. Arizona had already caused
one five-second violation, and this
time the Wildcats forced Scott to re
ceive the ball very near the sideline.
Pivoting to avoid the stilling de
fense and find a guard to pass to,
Scott's foot caught the sideline for
Stanford's 22nd turnover of the
game.
"I think Arizona came out and
played with a lot of emotion," Van-
Derveer said. "I thought we had
them down and didn't put them
away. We shot horribly from the
free throw line. I think that cost us
the game along with some of our

turnovers. And the combination ol
those two things when you have a
close game, you're not going to
have much of a chance."
The loss of possession prompted
a foul which sent Willis to the line
with 37 seconds remaining. Willis
missed the front end. and Stanford
appeared ready to hold for a final
shot. Batastini got the ball off a
screen at the top of the key and
drilled the three to put Stanford up
l H)-K9 with just 16 seconds left.
Arizona chose not to call time
out. and when Barnes was unable to
get a shot off from the left elbow
with three ticks left it appeared the
Wildcats would not have time to
pass to another player for a shot.
But somehow Barnes found Bristol
on the right side, and Bristol
drained the 18-foot bu/zer-beater,
rolled backwards when she landed
and got mobbed by her entire team.
"It feels awesome." Bristol said.
"Before I took [the shot] I looked
over and saw I.N seconds on the
clock. I just jacked it up. We played
together as a team tonight; we want
ed it all the way."
As a team, the Wildcats shot an
unbelievable 71 percent from the
field in the second half as Arizona
got the victory They 1 points scored
by the Wildcats is the most by a Pae
-10 opponent in the last six years,
and Stanford's 90 is the most a ( ar
dinal team has scored in any losing
effort.
