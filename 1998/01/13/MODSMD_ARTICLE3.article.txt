The road to tenure can he a rocky one. but a
continuing program run hy the Stanford Help
Center may assist in smoothing the way.
A series of meetings beginning this month
will provide an opportunity for tenure-track
professors to "share practical ideas about teach
ing and work lite." said group facilitator Carol
Zimbelman of the Stanford Help ( enter.
"There are few places on campus that offer
support for junior faculty,' said Zimbelman.
"It's a safe place to discuss problems."
"Living under a microscope for six to seven
years is a stressful process.... 1 1 he group] helps
people to not feel alone."
The Help Center saw a need for this sort of
networking among junior faculty, Zimbelman
said. Since its inception three years ago. the pr<v
gram has evolved from a series of short lectures
into open, facilitated dialogues. Participating fac

ulty have discussed the balance between home
and work life, the struggle to publish and teach at
the same time, and classroom management.
With the recent controversy regarding
tenure for Assoc. Anthropology Prof. Akhil
Gupta and the ongoing appeal of Asst. I liston
Prof. Karen Sawislak. polities within the Uni
versitN has become .i prominent discussion issue
as well.
"There's definitely an emphasis on how to
survive politically in the Stanford atmosphere,
on the right moves to make, /imbelman said.
This program is unique to Stanford, said
/imbelman. although other universities .ire rec
ognizing the need for junior faculty support.
Participants have been "uniformly positive"
about the program, /.imbelman said.
Asst. Political Science Prof. Garolvn Wong
praised the concept. "It's great that such oppor
tunities are there" to connect with other faculty
members. Wong said.
