# Stanford seeking lucrative patents
## Replacements needed for lost moneymakers 
### T.J. Babbitt Contributing writer 
-I'urning research results into marketable
commodities is a Stanford specialty, and
technological licensing is ;t source of funding
that the I Jniversity pursues aggressively.
Hut as the recent expiration of several
highly lucrative patents owned by the I m
versity makes clear, revenue from technolog
ical licensing is no budgetary panacea. I'he
amount of money the I Jniversity makes from
licensing each year can vary dramatically.
Recently revenue has declined precipi
tously. due to the expiration of patents rang
ing from recombinant DNA to computer
imaging technology. I he DNA patents,
which had crucially important application in
the biotechnology industry, have produced
more than $2(X) million in royalties for the
I 'niversity, even though Stanford shared the
revenue with the UC-San Francisco. The
patents expired Dec. 2.
As a result. University royalties from
technological licensing could plunge from a
record $50 million in IW7 to somewhere
around $15 million this year. And no one re
ally knows if over the next several years Stan
ford's researchers are going to produce the
kinds of marketable technologies that could
push royalties higher again.
"The thing that leads to licensing or
patents is creative events. You never know
when someone is going to be driving down
the freeway and get an idea." said James (iib
bons. University President Gerhard Casper's

special counsel lor industry relations "W hat
you can do is create the kind of environment
where that is more likely to happen."
C asper. Gibbons and other members of
the Stanford administration have been en
thusiastic advocates of business partnerships
and licensing. They see them as a revenue
source that needs to be developed in light of
a government science research budget that
has stopped growing and even shrunk some
what in the 1 W(K.
In the long term it is the creation of mar
ketable technologies and systems that deter
mine royalty income. Hut even in the short
term, licensing revenue can grow and shrink
with the business cycle.
"Increases or decreases are only some
what predictable because revenue is based
on sales b\ our licensees, which is not under
our control." said (Catherine ku. the director
of Stanford's Office of Technology Licens
ing.
"We do think our [non-DNA] income v\ ill
continue to grow."
Under Ku. her office has identified one
potential successor to the DNA patents a
set of computer music technologies and
formed what for it is an unusual partnership
with Yamaha C orp. According to Ku. the
partnership with Yamaha arose because
Stanford and > amaha lound that sharing
their patents would be mutually beneficial
"We have the Yamaha partnership be
cause it is an unusual situation. II we find our-
