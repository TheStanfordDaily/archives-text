easy part ot obser\ ing Ramadan. Imran

Ramadan marks the gradual reveal
ing of the Koran, the sacred hook of
Islam, to the prophet Mohammed. In re
membrance ol this time. Maskatia and
other Muslim students at Stanford are
fasting from dawn until Jusk. as well as
abstaining from sexual relations for a
lunar month.
"People have a hard time believing

me when I say that's the easy part." said
Maskatia. president of the Islamic Soci
ety of Stanford University. "The hard
part is to keep my state of mind pure."
"The purpose is to get through even
your hardest da\s while sacrificing."

Sometimes the insensitivity of other
students can make the task difficult
Maskatia recalled an incident in which a
student walking past the dorm room of
an Islamic student would mimic the
sound of explosions, implying a link to
terrorism.

commodating. The dining halls have
given Islamic students a partial refund or
allowed those on the meal plan to
change to the point plan during Ra

tradition, is served .it some dining halls

a light meal before sunrise and do t'
same after sunset.

break the fast every day in a meal
organized by the Islamic Society.
After sunset, dates and milk are
traditionally eaten, followed by
prayer. I he student remain togeth
er for a larger meal and discussion.
"I usually don't have the time to
see other Muslims." said Frank

Primus, a junior. " I his is the time of
the year for me to touch base."

prised at the strength of the Islamic
community at Stanford, adding that
is almost like a "ready-made fami
