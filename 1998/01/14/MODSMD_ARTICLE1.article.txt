What do you
do with five two
liter bottles of
Mountain Dew?
Already sleep
deprived Stan
ford students
have been using
this caffeine
loaded bever-

age to stay awake for up to 35 hours to play a game. Hut
this is no insignificant, mindless game. This is The
Game that brings adventure and intrigue into every
day student life.
The Game is an event that challenges players to un
dergo extreme intellectual, physical and emotional
pressures by making them solve intricate problems in
a limited amount of time.
Game players ride in a van within a two-to-three
hour driving radius from the Stanford campus in teams
of about seven people. An average of 15 to 20 teams
are strategically created in an effort to combine people
from a variety of fields who will be able to engage in
challenging problem solving.
Last quarter, freshman Dan Arnold played The
Game and found it to be an event that made him pre
pare himself as if he were going into battle.
"Our team rented a van and packed il full of Moun
tain Dew, Oreo cookies, physics books, the Bible, a
dictionary, chemistry books and water guns," Arnold
said. "You never know what you are going to need to
solve the clues."
Arnold's specialty is physics, but he admits that
when a clue arose dealing with physics, he was at a loss.
"We received a piece of paper with the sine wave, a
wavelength in nanometers, and a location. We had to
convert the wavelength into a frequency, then tune
into that radio station. Game Control had created a
bandwidth and they were broadcasting the next clue.''
Arnold said.
Apparently, there is little that Game Control, The
Game's creators, won't do to invent a clue. According
to senior Hsiang Tseng, one of this year's game orga
nizers, anybody who wants to organize the event can.
Usually past players come back with new clues to try
and make The Game even more mind-taxing.
Yet like with most adventurous pursuits. Arnold re
minds us that one must always expect the unexpected.
"It was after three o'clock in the morning and we
were walking around Berkeley with flashlights looking
for clues. I guess the neighbors were getting worried."
he said. "The police stopped us three times to see what

we were up to."
This sort of "Mission Impossible" endeavor under
standably doesn't faze adventure-seeking students
such as Arnold.
Phil King, who was a Stanford undergraduate when
The Game originated, is what those familiar with I he
Game call an Old-School Gamer.
"The Game, as I understand it. began in in

Mirlo. Hack then it was called the Ba\ Area Race Fan
tastique." said King, now an electrical engineering
master's student at Stanford.
"I first played The Game as a freshman in 1988. in
BARF 11. By then it was already spreading campus
wide. and it has always been verv underground. Later
