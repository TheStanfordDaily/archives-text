Watkins stooped over a hole in the
thick ice covering a trout brook, and
with his bare hand held a plastic
soda jug under the I rigid water until
it tilled.
"I'll tell you. it's not the warmest
water." Watkins said as lie used the
cuff of his jacket to blanket his other
hand, which had turned pink from
the cold. " This has definitely got to
he the worst part of it."
Yesterday was the fifth straight
day without electricity for thou
sands of Mainers. including
Watkins. who Ihes in a mobile

home with his sister, her husband
and two children, four dogs and six
puppies. Ten to 15 relatives without
heat in their homes have been stay
ing there.too.
Even though the trailer has a
kerosene heater and wood stove, the
temperature inside was only 45 to 50
degrees the previous night, when it
dipped into the teens outside.
Roughly 130.000 electric cus
tomers in the state continued shiv
ering in the dark yesterday, as an
army of utility workers struggled to
restore power. Earlier in the week,
at least 275.(XX) people in Maine had

been without electricity.
Yesterday afternoon. President
Clinton declared 15 Maine counties
disaster areas, entitling the areas to
federal aid.
The situation was marginally bet
ter in the three other states hit hard
by the ice storm. More than 120,(KK)
utility customers were still without
power yesterday in upstate New
York. 5,400 customers in New
Hampshire, and about 4.000 in
Vermont.
National Guard units were help
ing restore power and with cleanup
throughout the region.

across the South last week, the
storm spread lhick ice across the
Northeast and the eastern third of
Canada. Fifteen deaths in Canada
were blamed on the storm, seven in
New York and four in Maine.

The ice storm caused more dam
age to Maine's electric delivery os
