Iraq stalls again
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)
Using a bureaucratic ploy, Iraq
once again prevented a U.S.-led
arms inspection team from doing
its job yesterday. The move drew
new warnings from Washington
that it will not tolerate interfer
ence in the U.N. program to find
Iraq's hidden weapons.
Team leader Scott Kilter,
ready and waiting at U.N. head
quarters in Baghdad, was left in
the lurch when his Iraqi escorts
failed to show up for a planned
inspection tour of suspected
weapons sites.
The move was less dramatic
but no less decisive than the actu
al blocking of inspectors that set
off the last Iraq-U.N. crisis, when

American inspectors were even
tually thrown out of Iraq in
November and arms inspections
were halted for three weeks.
Iraq's newest challenge
which came a day after it warned
it would ban inspections by Kit
ter's team because it had too
many Americans â€” produced a
replay of last year's crisis
rhetoric.
Iraq's state-run press accused
Washington of trying to "injure
the dignity of Iraq," and America's
U.N. ambassador said Iraq was
instigating a new confrontation.
"I can tell you, patience is run
ning out in a lot of Security ( oun
cil capitals. I'he Iraqis are really
pushing this to the brink." Ambas
sador Bill Richatdson told ABC's
"Ciood Morning America."
