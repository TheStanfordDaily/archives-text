# Prostate cancer risk higher among blacks
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) Black
men arc two to three times more
likely to die of prostate cancer than
white men. and doctors today .tic
powerless to explain whs or reduce
the risks.
Calling the figures ";i disgraceful
tragedy." the American Cancer
Society and 100 Black Men of
America urged ;i national attack on
prostate cancer yesterday hoping
to emulate activists who successful
ly raised millions of research dollars
to fight breast cancer and AIDS.
At the top of the agenda is
increasing federal research. I he
government spent about $K0 million
on prostate cancer research last
year, one-twelfth what is spent on
AIDS research and about one sixth
of breast cancer research and pre
vention funding even though all
three diseases kill about the same
number of Americans yearly
The Clinton administration

plans to seek across the board
increases in medical research
spending lor 1999. but gave yester
day's prostate cancer call a chilly
reception.
"We don't believe in pitting one
disease against another." said
Health and Human Services
spokesman Victor Zonana.
About 1X4.5(X) American men
will be diagnosed with prostate can
cer this year, and almost 42.(HÂ»0 will
die. the American ( ancer Society
estimates.
Black Americans have the high
est risk: for every 1 (HUH Ml black
men. an estimated 234 will net
prostate cancer this year, compared
with 135 of every 1 (K).( h H) white
men. Black men are two to three
times more likely to die ot the dis
ease. I he cancer risk increases as
men age and is rare under 50 hut
blacks are more likely to get
prostate cancer at younger ages.

Scientists can't explain the racial
disparity, although theories range
from genetics to health care access
and distrust ol the mostly white
medical establishment.
Hut part ol the quandary is that
so little is known about prostate
cancer overall, said Dr. Charles
McDonald of Brown lniversit\.
president-elect of the cancer soeietN
Prostate cancer can grow so
slowh that it will never threaten
some patients, but doctors can't tell
in advance. Doctors don't know
which therapies are most effective
a key question since certain
treatments cause serious side
effects nor how to reduce the risk
ol getting prostate cancer.
Ihe American Cancer SoeietN
decided the questions were so
important that it dedicated 10 per
cent of its research budget about
$10 million soleh to prostate
cancer this year.
