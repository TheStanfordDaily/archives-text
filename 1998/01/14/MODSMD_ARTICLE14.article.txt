LOS ANGELES (AP) — A
three-year study concluded that
broadcast television networks have
become more responsible about
depicting violence — with the
exception of a new "shockumen
tary" type show that exploits
footage of death and destruction.
Fox's "World's Scariest Police
Shootouts" and CBS' "The
World's Most Dangerous Ani
mals" were among the programs
cited for their grisly content in the
final UCLA Television Violence
Report, issued yesterday.
"While the majority of program
ming deals responsibly with vio
lence issues, reality-based specials
do not." said Jeffrey Cole, the
report's author and director of the
UCLA Center for Communication
Policy.
The study , which began with an
analysis of the 1994-95 season,
found that the networks have tem
pered the amount and nature of
violence aired. But Cole said that it
remains a part of television and
parents should be vigilant.
"I don't think they would neces
sarily let their children have free
reign through television." Cole said.
The networks, which financed
the UCLA study, are not held
blameless: There are excessively
violent shows aimed at both chil
dren and adults, including the
abrupt rise of what the study
dubbed "shockumentaries."

Criticism already has been lev

"They're reprehensible." said

the study found.
That's compared with five series

Researchers did more than
count episodes of violence: they
viewed each incident in context,

not cited as problems
