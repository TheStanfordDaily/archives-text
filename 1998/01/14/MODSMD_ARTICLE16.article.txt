## Editorial The 						end of a Humanities and Sciences' era Shoven's story 
### 
Tenure as Dean has been
marked by both successes
and many controversies

WHEN ECONOMICS PROF.
John Shoven leaves his position
as Dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences after his five-year term
ends this spring, he will leave behind a
mixed legacy.
At the helm of largest of the Universi
ty's seven schools, Shoven has aimed at
improving the quality of the Stanford edu
cation in an increasingly competitive envi
ronment. But Shoven has not done so
without making some controversial deci
sions.
Among his most important accomplish
ments was reinstating the minor. The
minors program now offers students
increased flexibility in their academic plan
ning and enables students who cannot pur
sue a second major to study another field of
interest in depth.
1 le has also urged departments to under
go a through review of their curricula.
In addition, changes in the Area One
program overwhelmingly passed the scruti
ny of the Faculty Senate last year, inaugu
rating the Introduction to the Humanities
program.
Shoven also actively participated in
bringing into being the landmark Compara

tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity program.
Yet. reforms and improvements coincid
ed with considerable controversy.
In denying tenure to then-Asst. Anthro
pology Prof. Akhil Gupta and to Asst. His
tory Prof. Karen Sawislak, Shoven has
overruled candidates with strong support
from their respective departments and from
the student body.
Many students and faculty members
viewed his actions as unwarranted activism
that challenged departmental indepen
dence. Others argued that the tenure
denials reflected a Has against minorities
and women, whose research interests may
not coincide with the more traditional views
of H&S deans.
Tenure became one of last year's most
contentious issues, complete with protests
in White Pla/a and open letters to Shoven.
During the summer. University's Advi
sory Board granted Gupta tenure on
appeal. Sawislak's appeal is still pending.
Moreover, a number of students and
faculty members remember the bitter taste
of Shoven's budget cuts, particularly the
decision to close the Food Research Insti
tute.
As he leaves his office, the dean is far
from being one of Stanford's most popular
administrators.
Despite Shoven's accomplishments, we
welcome a new reign â€” hopefully one that
will be less controversial in pursuing
admirable goals for the School of Humani
ties and Sciences.
