## An anecdote by the Thai cafe 
### 
I MET MY inside
source — Stanford's
version of Deep
Throat — last Tuesday
over lunch.
Let's call him Victor Las
zlo.
I was slowly consuming

the last sauce-drenched remnants of shrimp
salad, when he showed up and pulled out
the first of what would surely be several
Lucky Strikes.
After a pause, he muttered, " That stuff'll
kill you, you know?"
"Yeah, well, we all gotta go somehow," 1
sputtered while pointing an accusatory
chopstick at his cancer stick.
"You know, Thailand IS the number five
opium producer in the world."
"That's nice."
"Opiates have a mildly bitter taste."
"Great."
"The University hasn't exactly been
actively seeking more food providers for
this neck of campus."
"Will you shut up about the Thai Cafe?"
It was his usual introductory rant, and I had
no stomach for it.
"Opiates make its users docile and easi
ly. . ."
"Shut up! No more talk about the Thai
Cafe, or I'm writing a column about SITN
videos dubbed with audio feeds from
pornos."
I looked over at him. He was taking a
long, nervous drag on his cigarette. Laszlo
reeked of tobacco and burritos, and he
looked like his adviser had been using him
for target practice. He was squinting at the

light of the gray afternoon.
"You look like shit. Bad night in lab?"
He shook his head. "I've heard some
thing unfortunate."
I downed my apple juice, and Victor lit
another Lucky. A cluster of people walked
by, apparently savoring some joke in a Slav
ic language.
"Well?"
He looked over at me. " The Project's
still going."
Time stopped for a second. I was sud
denly very conscious of where 1 was and
what I was hearing. Somewhere nearby,
people were arguing loudly in Mandarin.
"I thought its funding got killed. Hell,
even the grant officer was beginning to see
what was going on, and he was from the
Army. He couldn't tell the difference
between four phase transitions and an
amusing doodle."
He snorted. "But there's always a way.
Rapid Purchase Orders for bogus supplies.
Equipment that slips through Capital Asset
Management. A staff of students TAing
reading seminars. Office space in machine
rooms."
The Project was something mythical that
you talked about in hushed tones. Like the
massive football-field-sized room some
where under Stanford campus. Or the
Games that were played a decade ago.
1 glanced at Victor. He was staring off
into the distance, at some spot in the dark
ening sky somewhere over the Physics
Tank.
When he spoke next, his voice was low
and tired. "When we were young, we were
made to believe that science was a brave.

wonderful field. You could illuminate the
darkness of ignorance, like da Vinci and
Galileo, hut only if you were willing to
struggle and to argue that knowledge was
right and good.
"Now, we know better. Government is
owned by corporations, science is owned by
the government, and we are owned by sci
ence. The western world has been brain
washed to believe that knowledge will
progress and that nothing can stop it. By
ensuring everyone believes that notion,
they've made that notion true.
"Good doesn't matter. They do and
learn what they will. They want the Project
to succeed, so it will. The scientists don't
care about the ramifications. They just
want any resulting glory to grease their
tenure tracks. Comfort and power are
powerful motivators, but nothing com
pared to their 'standing in the community.'
Some kids never outgrow playing king of
the hill.
"It's funny. 1 once attempted to engage
my adviser in an ethical debate."
"And?"
He stood and stomped out his smoke.
"Let me put it this way. If I'm not back to
my desk in 10 minutes, it'll be a repeat per
formance. And this time, it will involve my
thesis and a shredder."
I gathered my things and rose. "St) what
should I write this week?"
He shrugged and turned away. "Beats
me."
