Student Housing Service
feels the crunch, too
I am writing in response to the Tuesday,
Jan. A. editorial. "Feeling the Crunch." We
in Student Housing Services are acutely
aware of the frustrations of the crunch sur
rounding the short Winter academic recess
period: we ;ire caught in it. too. I Icre are the
realities we face:
Each year during autumn quarter
finals week, the residence population
begins to thin dramatically after Tuesday
and Wednesday. With each passing day
after that, the risk to remaining residents
and their belongings increases. A lot of peo
ple - - including burglars and others with
bad intentions — know the Stanford aca
demic calendar. They know when the pop
ulation dwindles and when doors are most
likely to be left propped open, with few
people inside the residence to notice the
presence of strangers in the house. It is
important to limit the amount of time that
students and their property spend in this
vulnerable state, which is why residences
are secured as soon as possible by the end of
finals week. I his procedure is in students'
best interests. I his information is well-pub

licized so that students can make all neces
sary plans in advance (cf. pp. 15-17. Stan
ford Residence Agreement.)
Winter break is the only three-week
period of the calendar year when we can
accomplish a host of facilities-related pro
jects without displacing or disrupting resi
dents. Ihe summer conference season
keeps virtually all residences full from June
till September. Summer conference income
substantially subsidizes student rent rates to
keep rates as low as they are.
lor example, this winter break, the fol
lowing projects were completed, some sys
tem wide, others more localized: smoke
detector testing; kitchen hood cleaning;
Ansul extinguisher service; grease trap,
chimney and duct cleaning: bathroom and
common area painting; student-room and
apartment turnovers; gutter and downspout
maintenance and repairs; hardwood floor
refinishing: roof repairs; kitchenette cup
board installation; plumbing replacements;
storage cage replacement; hot water tank
relining; OP punchlist completion; lighting
retrofits: bathroom fan installations; storm
drain service: wastcline foaming: drain line
repairs: bathroom tile repairs and replace
ments; window flashing repairs; bike park
ing improvements; railing replacements;

ADA-related retrofits; carpet repairs and
deep cleaning, and new-carpet installations;
deep-cleaning and sanitizing residence
common areas; piano tuning and repairs;
vinyl floor repairs and replacements; uphol
stery and window covering cleaning and
replacement.
* Winter break is the only time during
the school year when we can do routine
student-room maintenance repairs and
safety inspections without invading stu
dents' privacy. These inspections are
important in order to identify items need
ing repair or replacement and imperative in
order to find hazards. For example, in past
winter break inspections we have found
candles left burning, overheated lamps left
on in direct contact with flammable materi
als. beds shoved up against heaters that had
been left on. motorcycles with full gas tanks
left near ignition sources, faucets left run
ning in student-room sinks, ground-floor
windows and doors left open and other
serious hazards. We have also found stu
dent rooms with all lightbulbs burned out,
with broken desks or dressers, with
improperly functioning locks, etc. — all
previously unreported by residents and all
unreasonable for any student to have to
live with.

* During the course of these routine
annual inspections, we make repairs or do
facilities improvement projects and respond
with follow-up letters to students only about
conditions that are specific policy violations
or that compromise student safety such as is
the case with halogen lamps or candles. A
persuasive liability argument could be made
that we should simply remove the hazardous
items immediately and report the violations
to the Residence Dean for disciplinary
action, but we have chosen to wait until stu
dents return and allow them to bring them
selves into compliance with housing policy,
without penalty. (Given the Daily's
endorsement of the safety ban on halogen
lamps, we are at a loss to understand the
Daily's now taking exception to a reason
able enforcement of the policy.)
As for better publicizing inspections, we
can try to do that in some way. This year, in
addition to the notification contained in the
Residence Agreement (p. 19), we reminded
students of the winter break inspections via
closing newsletters, flyers and individual e
mail messages, but we can send even more
reminders if that would be helpful.
As for providing advance notification
when any staff must enter student rooms
during the quarter, it is easier said than

done. With 3.5 million square feet of stu
dent residence space, more than K).(KH)
rooms and apartments and only several
dozen staff members — many of them from
departments other than our own — and
contractors to complete more than 6(),(XX)
work orders a year (which does not include
large-scale projects), such notice is infeasi
ble in most instances. When it is feasible,
Facilities Supervisors do alert residents of
work planned in their room or apartment. It
should also be noted that virtually all stu
dent room entries are made at the request
of the student for a repair or improvement
and not for any other reason.
We know and fully respect that students'
rooms are their homes while they are at
Stanford. We witness first-hand the pride
many students take in personalizing and
taking care of their homes, and we remain
committed to helping make those homes as
safe, comfortable and supportive of stu
dents' academic and personal lives as we
possibly can. Suggestions on how we can do
that better are always welcomed by our
staff in housing.
