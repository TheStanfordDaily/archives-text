### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
At his monthly staff meeting,
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya heard a report from
international students and support
personnel about the problems faced
by and resources available to stu
dents coming from foreign coun
tries.
During the meeting, staff mem
bers from the Bechtel International
Center gave a presentation on the
current status of international stu
dents at Stanford.
John Pearson, director of the
center, said that since 1 Wb the num
ber of international students at
Stanford has risen from 1,768 to
2,842, although the percentage of in
ternational students in the total stu
dent population has remained about
3 percent.
Pearson also talked about the in
creased visibility of international
students since the 1980s due to in
ternational political issues that have
brought these students to the lime

light on several occasions. As a re
sult. international students have be
come a much larger focus of univer
sities across the nation, including
Stanford.
On campus, the Bechtel Interna
tional Center is the primary source
of information and help for interna
tional students. The center orga
nizes orientation for the new in
ternational students, helps the stu
dents with housing, and also pro
vides a variety of presentations and
other resources to help the students
adjust to their new environment.
The presentations range from bank
ing in the I Inited States to advice on
how to buy and repair automobiles.
I lie center also provides re
sources to help family members of
foreign students adjust to Stanford.
Pearson talked about the psycho
logical ups and downs that interna
tional students and their families
often experience as part of the "cul
tural shock."
Initially, students have difficulty
adapting to using English on a daily
basis. Other students have trouble
adjusting to the educational system
at Stanford and the American cul
ture. 1 he center provides a place for
the students to get help.
Yesterday's meeting also includ
ed a panel discussion session with
four international students, three
of whom were graduate students
and one undergraduate. During
the discussion, the students got a
chance to talk about their experi
ences at Stanford and to raise con
cerns thev had about life as in

ternational students here.
Cheefoong Wan, a senior in
product design lrom Singapore,
said the biggest surprise for him
was how students at Stanford all
worked very hard, but everyone
has a relaxed outlook and says
they're not working hard.
Maria Quijada, a masters stu
dent in engineering-economic sys
tem and operations research from
Venezuela said that she learned a
lot from"the adjustment to mixing
with people from all different
backgrounds."
Several of the students men
tioned the friendliness of the acad
emic atmosphere on campus.
"[Professors] want to learn from

you as much as you want to learn
from them," said Eduardo Al
vare/, a doctoral student from
Mexico.
The students voiced some con
cerns as well.
Wan mentioned the lack of ser
vices at Stanford during winter
break when most foreign students
are still on campus.
Other students cited problems
with getting into housing at the be
ginning of the year. Because resi
dences do not open until the day of
orientation, many foreign students
have trouble settling in on time for
school.
Montoya said he would look
into these issues.
