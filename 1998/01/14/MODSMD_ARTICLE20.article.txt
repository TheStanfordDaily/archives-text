## Nagano catches the Olympic spirit

M Y COACH ALWAYS told me the
Olympics were the biggest party
.I'd CVCT gO It).
"It's absolutely huge! It's so special, il
changed my life completely and il v\ill
yours too," my coach, a two time Olympic
figure skater, would tell me as I diligently
wenl to practice everyday helorc and altei
school loi many, many years.
"When it comes down to it. lomoch,
when \oii walk into the opening ceremonies
as a part o| a national team with the world
mating at you. you know it was worth every
single minute ol \om work." With that and a
playful pal. she'd send me back out to the ice
for another hour ol training.
I was not able to conliim her woids about
the gloiies ol the Clames as I never quite
made it there myself. Hut. I did the next best
thing applied for a job at the Nagano
Olympics as a media intern. With hopes
peeking at the reality my coach experienced
and the dream I'd once envisioned, I took a
preview visit io ihc ()ly nipic site a few days
ago.
I'he Nagano ()lynipics have ignited much
controversy since it was decided eai liei in the
decade that the games would he held there.
The usual bashing surrounding an Olympic

site seemed particularly harsh; local and for
eign media alike reported on negative
impacts the games will have on the environ
ment and showed citizens worrying about
potential lax increases.
How can it possibly host the Winter
( lames? (The Olympics have never been
held that close to the equator!) Many people
said Nagano was too small, causing the sites
to be too spread out for the (James to work,
liven the Japanese had raised questions
was Nagano too rural and unsophisticated a
town to be able to welcome in the world?
Will its people be good hosts?
After experiencing Nagano this weekend,
however, I believe that the IWK Olympics
are going to be a powerful success.
I'he Nagano I saw seemed to be a differ
ent place altogether from the cozy little town
I recall from the time I used to frequently
visit it for competitions as a skater. Although
its people remain warm and helpful, and the
community very tight-knit, Nagano has
undergone a complete makeover.
()n stepping off the new snazzy silver bul
let train connecting the Olympic city to
lokyo I immediately felt the difference. I
walked up the stairs of the newly remodeled
t'jant Nagano Station, with bright welcoming

Olympic banners hanging from its high ceil
ings in all soils of languages. The sight of the
station staff, expanded by more than 2(*J per
cent for the (lames, practicing conversation
al Lnglish over lunch immediately caught my
eye. I recalled that before, people would
point and stare at one of my skating buddies,
who's mother is Swedish.
As a fellow reporter and I trampled
through the snow on the clean and now very
spacious main street, we encountered a (ler
man TV crew who recommended to us a tra
ditional Japanese restaurant up the street. Its
owner. 62-year old I lisato I ujii. whose fami
ly has run the traditional Japanese noodle
shop for 3(H) years, sat down with us. and
throughout the entire meal, anxiously and
excitedly told us how he cannot stop thinking
about the (lames as well as all the things he
and his staff could still do to welcome it.
"I never dreamed I'd experience such a
glorious event at this age," he said. "I'm a lit
tle worried about our poor English, but
we've taken pictures of all the items on the
menu, renaming each dish in Lnglish. And
body language is universal, isn't it?"
I le later gave us a tour of the restaurant,
showing us the four new bathrooms he had
made Western-style and the traditional

Japanese storefront he spent $K().()<)() "fixing
up." He then preceded to tell us all about
how the restaurant will have extended hours
and how it'll be stocked with forks and
spoons during the Ciames.
"We're thinking of laying carpets over our
tatami mats so the foreign athletes and offi
cials won't have to take off their shoes. What
do you think?"
We were a bit overwhelmed by his ardent,
unlimited enthusiasm, but I quickly reali/.ed
it wasn't just him. The entire town shared a
sense of team effort. From the businessman
who said he'll take two weeks off work to
volunteer at the Olympic village to the cou
ple who eagerly await to host families of the
Olympians, it was apparent that everyone in
the community wanted to make the
()lympics a mark in their history.
As the two of us went around all over the
city for several days. I found myself growing
more and more excited — the Olympic spir
it of Nagano is contagious.
Our last interview in the snowy white city
was at Nagano's only Indian restaurant, one
of many eateries just recently opened. As we
ate their famous and very reasonably priced
Olympic menu, the owners invited us to a
party they were throwing for India's only

Olympic participant, a 16-year-old luge
racer.
"We just want this It) be a social place
where the ()lympians can come ;md take a
break we probably won't make any profit
during the (iames. but that's okay." said the
store's head c<x>k. lingering the new II) card
he'll be using to go into the Olympic village
everyda\ to deliver hundreds of servings of
dishes, a volunteer task he happilv accepted
from the local Olympic ('ommittee.
Now I'm back in lokyo, but I still feel the
warmth of Nagano's people. I find myself
grinning every time I recall their hvper
Olympic spirit I think I now know, after all
this time, w hat m\ coach had meant.
The athletes will be the stars of the big
party, but as Mr. I ujii said, " I lie (iames are
not just about great athleticism, international
culture exchange is a major part of the
Olympics." I anxiously look forward to
returning to Nagano contributing to this
aspect of the Ohmpic bash with the people
of the city.
