What exactly is "hardening of the arter
ies," and should I worry about it now?
—ANJ, Class of'ol
A Dear Reader,
The term "hardening of the arteries"
comes from the Latin term arteriosclerosis,
meaning exactly that, hardening of the ar
teries. It is a term used to describe certain aspects of
cardiovascular disease. The word "hardening" is in
cluded because that is what happens to small sections
of artery if the disease is advanced. An arterial plaque
forms along the inside of the artery and begins to col
lect within the wall. Because of the nature of the con
tents of the plaque, the deposit begins to stiffen —
which hardens that small part of vasculature.
High amounts of fat and cholesterol in the blood
form what are known as "fatty streaks" along the
lumen of our arteries; this process usually starts in our
bigger arteries, such as the aorta. We have cells called
monocytes present in our bloodstream that detect the
abnormally high amount of cholesterol and attempt to
destroy it by consuming it. The inflated monocytes at
tempting to consume the cholesterol turn into foam
cells and get deposited within the artery wall.
Eventually, a fibrous cap forms over these foam
cells and seals them within the wall, while creating a
bulge into the arterial space; this process is very simi
lar in theory to the way a scab seals over a small cut.
And voila! You've got your arterial plaque.
Should you be concerned about it? Well, that all
depends on how old you are and what your exercise
and eating habits are like. If you're a young vibrant
Stanford student, you probably don't have too much
to worry about as far as arteriosclerosis, but it's never
too late to start good habits. Cut down on your
fat / cholesterol intake, get regular exercise and NO
SMOKING. Keep regular appointments with your
primary care physician to monitor your progress.

Is marijuana addictive? Several of my
friends sav that it isn't an addictive drug.
What's the scoop?

A Dear Jay,
In my own opinion, you're just fooling
yourself if you think that pot isn't addictive.
It certainly has a psychological affect on the
brain and other neural centers. After all, its 420 chem
icals have to go somewhere. However, I can't give you
a definitive answer. My knowledge on the studies con
cerning marijuana's addictive qualities is limited, and
my Medline search in reference to your question pro
duced little information.
Hut here's an interesting twist. The active ingredi
ent in marijuana. THC, is fat soluble. This means that
it has the ability to dissolve into the membrane of any
cell in your body, although I am uncertain as to how
much actually binds. Therefore, you could theoretical
ly have a dose any time your body decides to burn a lit
tle fat and release that THC into your bloodstream.
I've even heard reports that TllCcan stay dormant
in fatty tissue for up to 30 days. So, if someone you
know is smoking marijuana, and all of a sudden they
start acting strangely during their exam a few days
later, it might not be because of the exam questions.
