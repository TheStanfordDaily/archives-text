# Earthquakes leveled Bronze Age cities
## New theory advanced for destruction of ancient cultural centers 
### Joe Kwok Contributing writer 
From 1225 B.C. to 1175 8.C.. the major cultural cen
ters of the Eastern Mediterranean, including Troy,
Mycenae and Knossos, collapsed one by one. Although
classic novels such as the Iliad have blamed the fall of
Troy on the Trojan Horse and archaeologists have long
attributed the destruction to war. Stanford geophysicist
Amos Nur proposes a different possibility: earth
quakes.
For more than 20 years. Nur has been studying past
earthquakes in the Eastern Mediterranean as a model
for earthquake prediction. Whether he will ever suc
ceed remains to be seen. However, while poking
through the ruins of ancient cities of the Eastern
Mediterranean, Nur may have come across an answer
to a more interesting question: what caused the end of
the Bronze Age civilizations?
The main Bronze Age centers were all located near
major fault systems or plate boundaries. According to
the plate tectonics model, the crust, or outer layer of the
earth, is composed of irregularly shaped plates that
slide over, under and past each other as rigid bodies.
Therefore, most of the motion in the crust is localized at
boundaries between the plates.
Nur believes it is not a single earthquake but a series
of them that wiped out the Bronze Age civilization. In
deed. seismic records indicate that earthquakes are
episodic: short periods of intense activity are followed
by long periods of quietness.
Even though the destruction may have occurred
3.000 years ago, it is still possible to determine whether
an earthquake caused it. Archaeological evidence
seems to support Nur's theory.
" The most compelling evidence is the nature of the
destruction," said Nur.
According to Nur. the walls of the cities usually ap
peared to have collapsed in one direction. Fire, war and
neglect can all harm walls, but earthquakes cause the
most damage â€” leading walls to collapse as a unit.
"Why would an invading army push the wall in one
direction?" said Nur. "This would take a great effort."
Crushed human skeletons were found trapped under
the collapsed rubble. The tortured position of these
bodies indicate that these were not burials but that the

bodies were struck by a sudden and massive load. It is
also unlikely that conquerors pushed down the wall due
to the presence of precious metals and pottery next to
the bodies. Invaders would have looted the goods in
stead of leaving them behind.
According to Nur. it is conceivable that earthquakes
may have also caused similar destruction to some cul
tural centers in South America. For example, Mayan
centers are known to have been destroyed in the past,
but this did not lead to the disappearance of the Mayans.
An invasion in all likelihood would have wiped out the
Mayan population, so the evidence suggests that inva
sion is an unlikely possibility.

So wh\ is the collapse- of these past civilizations usu
ally attributed to warfare?
"Because it's a better stor\ and because archaeolo
gists did not take geology," said Nur. "Input from an
other field is sometimes crucial."
Nur said that he hopes to start a program in earth
quakes and archaeology. He will be teaching a sopho
more seminar called "Earthquake Archaeology" this
spring quarter.
According to Nur. how these findings help in future
earthquake predictions is not very clear. "But it is pret-

ranean studies that earthquakes
are episodic," he said.
"It is very likely that the San

Stanford have had and will contin

tense earthquake activity and S(H)
years of no earthquake activity. We
are probably living in the period of
