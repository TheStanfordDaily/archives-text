# Dyslexia may be caused by visual impairment

### Kevin Yee Editorial staff 
A recently published study by re
searchers in the Stanford Psychology De
partment supports the idea that the read
ing disorder dyslexia may be caused by a
subtle impairment of vision.
The theory that dyslexia is caused by
visual impairment is only one of many.
The prevailing theory concerning dyslex
ia holds that it originates — not from any

deficit of the senses — but from within
the language center of the brain responsi
ble for one's ability to isolate and manip
ulate sounds.
"We found compelling evidence that
there is a visual deficit associated with
dyslexia, but at this time we don't know
for certain if the deficit causes dyslexia or
is just a marker for it." said David J.
Heeger, assistant professor of psycholo
gy. The study, published in the Nov. 25
issue of the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, was co-authored
by Heeger, postdoctoral student Geof
frey M. Boynton and graduate student
Jonathan B. Demb. now a postdoctoral
fellow at the University of Pennsylvania.
The study's results showed that the
level of brain activity in the visual cortex,
the area where visual signals are
processed, apparently correlated to the
speed at which they were able to read.
Reading speed is generally the most reli
able indicator as to the severity of dyslex
ia in adults.
A technique called functional mag
netic resonance imaging (fMRI) was
used to measure the brain activity of five
adult dyslexics as well as five adults with
out the disorder. Functional MRI is capa
ble of measuring brain activity while peo
ple are thinking. This technique does so

by remotely sensing the ratio of oxygen
rich to oxygen-deficient blix>d as it flows
through the brain. Computer analysis ot
the data can then be used to display
where greater bliHKl flow occurs and thus
the areas with increased neural activity
The subjects were exposed to two sets
of visual stimuli: moving grids displayed
al both low and huzh light levels. As the\

watched these patterns, the subjects' ac
tivity levels in the primary center of the
hrain were measured. The Stanford study
improved upon a similar one conducted
last year by researchers at the National
Institutes of Health (MH)
Specifically, the MH studv was not
able to locate the specific usual cortical
regions of its subjects and thus was not
able to directly measure the usual activi
ty of the subjects. In contrast. Heeger and
his associates were able to locate the pn
mary visual cortical regions of their sub
jects using a technique developed b\ fel
low Psychology Prof Brian Wandell and
Steven Engel. now an assistant professor
at the I CLA
When the researchers did measure the
activity of the visual cortex, thev found a
significant difference between the activi
ty levels of the dyslexicsand non-dyslexi
es. especially at the lower light levels
l"he\ also found that the level of visual
cortex activity of the d\slcxic subjects
correlated to their respective reading
speeds These results both support the
hypothesis that the underlying problem
in dyslexia lies in the visual pathway at or
before the visual cortex.
The researchers caution that the new

activity in the primary visual cortex

gray) had more severe dyslexia.
results are too preliminary to affect
the diagnosis or treatment of
dyslexia. However, Heeger believes
that the study will lead to additional
research that will further reveal any
causal relationship between visual
impairments and dyslexia. If subse
quent research should confirm the
relationship between specific types
of brain activity and dyslexia, it
could branch into more accurate
methods for diagnosing dyslexia at
an earlier age as well as enumerate
its specific causes.
In the future, Heeger will seek to
replicate these results in a larger
pool of subjects, including children.
Additional studies plan to analyze
a single group of subjects in order
to compare the various hypotheses
that explain dyslexia. In such
broad-based studies, Heeger will
ask the more specific question, "is it

the auditory centers, the visual cen
ters, the language centers of the
brain, or a combination of them
which affects these individuals?"
"I am actually seriously thinking
about devoting a lot of energy to
studying dyslexia. The result that
we had is very interesting as a start
ing point," said Heeger.
Though I leeger's previous areas
of research have centered around
human and computational vision,
this study was primarily the thesis
work of Demb — who transferred
over from another lab in order to
pursue a nagging interest in dyslex
ia and the powerful and still ex
panding capabilities of fMRI.
"He dragged me into it," said
the smiling Heeger. "I quite frankly
would not have done this. It wasn't
on my radar screen. It wasn't on my
to-do list. And so the moral of the
story is that is the student at Stan
ford who brings in the fresh new
ideas and energy to make the things
happen."
