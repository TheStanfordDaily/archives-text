Researchers discover rea
soning behind beneficial
effects of smog
Researchers have known for many
years that the brown smog of Los An-

geles shields the area from harmful ultraviolet radia
tion — reductions ranging from 22 to percent have
been observed. Now Assistant Civil and Environmen
tal Engineering Prof. Mark Jaeobson knows why.
Jacobson. who specializes in creating computer

models of the atmosphere, has identi
fied key chemical components in the
smog that filter IJV radiation. In addi
tion. he has also found that ground
level ozone levels are reduced by 5 to S
percent.
The negative effects of I 'V radiation
are well proven. In general, a I percent
rise in IJV levels leads to a 2 percent rise
in skin cancer rates. High levels of ozone
have also been correlated with in
creased hospital admissions of people
with cardiovascular and chrome resnira-

Tory problems.
Jacobson realized that the scattering and absorption
of UV light by smog was not great enough to account
for the large drop in UV levels. Because the level of
sunlight in general was not reduced to the same level as
I 'V radiation, light scattering was eliminated .is a cause
of reduced I JV radiation.
Jacobson then considered secondary organic com
pounds that result from the chemical degradation of
pollutants given off by sources such .is cars and smoke
stacks. He found ih.it many of the secondary organic
compounds, especially those with attached nitrate
groups, have the feature of weakly absorbing visible
light and strongly absorbing lIV light

When these secondary organic compounds coat
smog particles, they have the characteristic of strong!)
absorbing UV light. Jacobson said that similar reduc
tions in UV radiation should be occurring in other
sunny, dry. climates like Los Angeles's. However, in
more humid climates, water coats the smog particles
and prevents them from absorbing UV radiation.
ITie absorption of UV light also explains the re
duced level of o/one because I 'V radiation acts as a cat
alyst for ozone producing reactions
Despite this beneficial effect of smog, it should be
noted that high levels ot smog have also been correlat
ed with high levels of cardiovascular and acute respira
tory problems.

cludes Boston at risk
from earthquake
According to Geophysics dtxtor
al student Eva Zan/crkia, the chance
of a damaging earthquake in the

Boston area is not as low previously thought.
In a report to the American Geophysical Union on
Dec. H. Zanzerkia said that many tall and mid-sized
buildings and neighborhi>ods built on unstable ground
would be at risk if an earthquake ever hit Boston. I his

conclusion resulted from a three-dimensional seismic
analysis of the various m>il types in the Boston Basin
made b\ Zanzerkia.
Because the basin is filled with sedimentary rock
surrounded by bedrock on three sides, seismologists
expected the area to trap seismic waves and amplify
them. However. Zan/erkia found that the sedimentary
rock in the basin, which has over time become almost as
hard as bedrock, will prevent seismic waves from be
coming trapped and amplifying.
Some areas in Boston are built over river sediment
covering glacial till, a heterogeneous mixture of clay,
sand and nvk. however. Zanzerkia mapped these
areas, and then using a computer model, analyzed the
interaction of seismic waves with the softer rock
rhc seismic waves produced by any earthquake in
the Boston area will pass relatively non-destructively
through the areas of sedimentary rock and bedrock: but
when they reach the pockets of softer rock, they will
slow down dramatically.
When the waves slow down, they will become
trapped and begin to resonate, greatly amplifying their
energy In glacial till the waves carry two to three times
the energy as in hard rock. In man-made landfill, the
energy becomes two to three times greater than in
glacial till. This increases both the intensity and the
length of the shaking.
