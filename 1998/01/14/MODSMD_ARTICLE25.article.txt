I tuning research results into
marketable commodities is a Stan
lord specially, and technological li
censing is ;i source of funding the
• 'diversity pin sues aggressively.
But as the recent expiration of
several highly lucrative patents
owned by the University makes
clear, icvenue from technological
licensing is no budgetary panacea.
I he amount ol money the I Iniversi
i\ makes Iront licensing each year
can vary dramatically.
Recently revenue has declined
precipitously, due to the expiration
of patents ranging from recombi
nant DNA to computet imaging
technology. I lie DNA patents,
which had crucially important ap
plication in the biotechnology in
dusiry. have produced more than
$20(1 million in royalties lor the
University, even though Stanford
shared the revenue with UC San
Francisco. Ihe patents expired
Dec. 2.
As a result. I Diversity royalties
II out technological licensing could
plunge from a record $50 million in
1 I W7 to somcwhere around $15 mil
lion this year. And no one really
knows il over the next several years
Stanford's researchers are going to
produce (he kinds ol marketable
technologies that could push roval
tics higher again.

" I lie thing that leads to licensing
or patents is creative events. You
never know when someone is going
to be driving down the freeway and
get an idea," said James (iibbons.
University President Gerhard
Casper's special counsel for indus
try relations. "What you can do is
create the kind ol environment
where that is more likely to hap
pen."
Casper, (iibbons and other
members of the Stanford adminis
tration have been enthusiastic ad
vocates of business partnerships
and licensing. I hey see them as a
revenue source that needs to be de
veloped in light of a government
science research budget that has
stopped growing and even shrunk
somewhat in the 1 WOs.
In (he long term it is the creation
of marketable technologies and sys
tems that determines royalty in
come. But even in (he short term, li
censing revenue can grow and
shrink with the business cycle.
"Increases or decreases are only
somewhat predictable because rev
enue is based on sales by our li
censees, which is not under our con
trol." saiil Katlicrinc ku. the direc
tor of Stanford's ()ffice of Technol
ogy Licensing.
"We do think our [non-DNA]
income will continue to grow." she
added
I he office has identified one po
tential successor to the DNA
patents — a set of computer music
technologies — and formed vvhal
for it is an unusual partnership vviih
Yamaha Corp. According to ku.
the partnership with Yamaha arose
because Stanford and Yamaha
found that sharing their patents

would be mutually beneficial.
"We have the Yamaha partner
ship because it is an unusual situa
tion. If sve find ourselves in another
situation for which a partnership
makes sense, we would do so," she
said.
Ilie joint venture, called
Sondius-X( J. could produce a stan
dard in music technology that finds
its way into a huge number ol desk
top computers and other electron
ic products. That's what its backers
hope will happen. It could also fail
to catch on. I he kind of calculated
risk-taking that Sondius-XCi rep
resents is what the Office of Tech
nology I ieensing must do every
day.
Of course, relying on business
deals to fund the I 'niversity can be
just as complicated as relying on the
federal government.
While (iibbons says that govern
ment agencies are increasingly in
terested in getting applied results
from the research they fund, in the
past they have been more willing to
lund basic research projects. But in
direct business partnerships, com
panies have a direct say in the sort
of research undertaken, and it is
nearly always geared toward the
marketplace.
"It's a time-scale issue when
you're working with industry. They
have short-term interests," said
(iibbons.
Even when business is not di
rectly responsible for the produc
tion of technologies, as when they
are created by University re
searchers and subsequently li
censed through () I L, the pressure
to produce eventually marketable
work is high. And that can change

research priorities.
t he profit motive also has obvi
ous effeets on what sorts of research
faculty members desire to under
take — and not only on the ease of
funding projects. A researcher who
produces an innovation that Stan
ford is able to market profits direct
ly from the arrangement. Under
Stanford's system, O i l. takes 15
percent of revenue, and the rest is
split evenly between the researcher,
his or her department, and his oi
lier school.
On the other hand, licensing in
come can give the I 'diversity a freer
hand in determining its own priori
ties. Revenue from patents and li
censes is unrestricted — that is.
much like money from the Univer
sity's endowment, it can generally
be used for whatever purpose the
I Jniversity has in mind, unlike gov
ernment and some business funds,
which are targeted and must be
spent on specific projects.
Ciibbons said that the pressure
to let corporate needs dictate Uni
versity priorities is inevitable in a
university such as Stanford, and
that the I Jniversity should welcome
business deals as long as it main
tains some level of commitment to
basic research.
"We would obviously not be
well served if the assumed [com
mercial] viability of an idea was dri
ving people's interest in it. I hat's
different from saying that a com
plete lack of focus is a requirement
for basic research." he said.
And both Ku and Ciibbons em
phasized that technology transfer
from the university setting to the
marketplace often has clear bene
fits for society.
