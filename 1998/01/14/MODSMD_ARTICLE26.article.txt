## New coach, high hopes carry gymnasts into season 
### Molly Brizgys 
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team has all of the ingredients for
a successful season — all of last
year's gymnasts back from the high
est achieving squad in Cardinal his
tory, three excellent frcshmEn and a
new top coach. The team will be put
to the test starting this Friday in its
Pacific 10 Conference opener
against Washington.
This season marks the start of
new head coach Mark Cook's career
on the Farm. Before coming to Stan
ford, Cook was a club coach and haD

served as an assistant coach at
UCLA lor the past three years. He
was named 19% West Region Assis
tant Coach of the Year and helped
the Bruins win a national champi
onship in 1997.
"My goal is to lead a program at
the highest level possible," Cook
said. "I want to build one of the most
respected programs in the country; a
program that is a threat to win a na
tional championship every year but
one that also provides our gymnasts
with the finest athletic experience ol
their lives."
The rookie coach has one of the

finest women's gymnastics squads in
Cardinal history to work with.
"We have a lot of things going for
us." said junior co-captain and Pac
-10 All-Conference selection Amy
Murakami.
Last year. Stanford finished sec
ond in the Pac-10 and broke every
major school record along the way.
Although the team missed nationals
by less than two points, junior Katie
Fitzpatrick, who finished 45th. and
sophomore Larissa Fontaine quali
fied individually. Fontaine finished
3()th, good enough to garner Second
Team Ail-American honors. Fitz
patrick recently began training again
after preseason ankle surgery and
will miss the beginning of the season.
"Our goal is to compete at the
NCAAs," said Senior co-captain
and former Pac-10 All Academic
Team selection Keri Monahan. who
is back after spraining an ankle in the
Pac-10 finals last year. "The team has
made a great transition to the new
coaches, and we had a productive
preseason in the gym."
Also returning for the Cardinal is
Murakami, who finished second in
the floor exercise at the Western Re
gional and is a consistent performer
in all events. "Amy has some of the
best execution on the team and had
the highest scores as an a 11 -
arounder," Cook said.
Senior Sarah Neil has helped the
Cardinal with her leadership and is
expected to make an impact on the

bars and balance beam. Sophomore
Kim Young, whodidn't compete last
year because of an ankle injury, is "a
strong athlete" according to Cook
and will start in three events for the
Cardinal.
Besides all of last season's per
formers. the squad also has three top
freshmen who will all make an im
pact this season. Jennifer Exaltacion.
although currently out with a stress
fracture, was a member of the ( ana
dian Olympic squad and when
healthy, will definitely help the C ar
dinal on the bars and beam.
Jenny Wilson, also a freshman,
was an alternate for the World Uni
versity (James and will make an im
pact on the vault, beam and floor ex
ercise.
"Wilson is durable and consistent
on a day-to-day basis." C ook said.
Freshman local standout She-
Rae Chen, who hails from (iunn
High School in Palo Alto, is also ex
pected to help the Cardinal.
Currently, however, the squad is
not in full force and is nursing quite a
few injuries.
"Injuries are always a big deal in
gymnastics." Monahan said. "Hope
fully. we will peak at the end of the
season at all of the big meets when
we have everyone back."
Stanford has a tough season
ahead of it as the Pac-10 is arguably
the most competitive conference in
the country. UCLA, Cook's former
team, is the defending national

champion, and Ari/ona finished sec
ond to the Bruins.
"With hard competition, it makes
you rise to the occasion and serves as
a yardstick of measurement lor
where you're at and where you need
to be. ( ook said.
C ook believes the squad is consis
tent and especially strong on the
floor and has depth on the beam. His
gymnasts agree. " There is a lot ol
freshness and everybody is focused
and ready to go." Murakami said.
Assistant Coach Rene Lyst is in
charge of choreography and was
open to new ideas lor the floor rou
tines this season. As a result, most of
the gymnasts have new routines this
year.
"The routines are a real group ef
fort and are really exciting to watch."
Monahan said.
Expected top performers on the
floor are Monahan, Murakami,
Fontaine, sophomore Sarah Hard
ing and junior Tracey Kohl.
The squad is short on depth for
the bars and the vault. In Cook's
eyes, one of its weaknesses is the
start on the vault. Cook put special
emphasis on improving technique
through intense drills so the team
can eventually increase the difficulty
of its vault routines.
" The team has a high skill level,
good execution and very good cama
raderie," Cook said. "These are
proud individuals who want to do
well."
