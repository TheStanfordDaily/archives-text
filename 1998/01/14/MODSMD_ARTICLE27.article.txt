# Walls that talk

### Shelley Ingram 
The helmet sits proudly in a
glass case like the Sphinx of Stan
ford sports; half the blue and gold
of The University of California and
half the white and cardinal of Stan
ford. It is a tribute to the seven men
who divided their loyalty between
both Cal and Stanford during
World War 11.
When Stanford abandoned
football during the war, these men
commuted to play at Berkeley for
two seasons. Once football was re
sumed, they returned to compete
for Stanford and went on to beat
Cal 25-6 in the IIW6l l W6 Big Game.
The helmet is just one piece of
folklore on display at the Stanford
Athletic Hall of Fame in the Arril
laga Family Sports Center.
Three Sears Directors' Cups,
the only all-sports trophy awarded
for the most points in NCAA com
petition, guard the entrance to the
Hall of Fame.
"Stanford's won three of the
four. The first went to North Car
olina. Each one of those is worth
$35,000," tour guide John Eshle
man explains.
The hall is divided into the easi
ly recognizable surface of each
sport: rubber mats for gymnastics,
swimming pool tiles for aquatic.
"Every year somebody tries to dive
in and hurts their arm badly." Esh
leman jokes about the distinctive
flooring.
A photograph of the
NCAA Championship baseball
team adorns the hall, as well as Bob
Mathias' picture on the cover of
Time when he won back-to-back
decathlons in the and
Olympics. The only two retired
football jerseys— those ol Ernie
Nevers and Jim Plunkett are on
display as well as the many Rose
Bowl victory banners that hang ma
jestically from the ceiling. And the
room is surrounded by do/ens ol
National Collegiate Championship
trophies from all athletic fields.
More than just the objects
housed here, excitement emanates
directly from the volunteer do
cents. These ex-Stanford athletes
give visitors individualized tours
filled with nostalgic tales that enliv
en Stanford's noble history.
"My wife is pleased because I
get out of the house and 1 love
doing this," Eshleman explained.
"It's enormous fun to meet and
swap stories with alumni and par

ents of players."
The docents have shared their
anecdotes with more than 2().(KK)
visitors in the last 18 months.
"Here is the one and only Heis
man that Stanford has won." Eshle
man proudly announces, pointing
to Jim Plunkett's trophy. But he
quickly moves on to the more in
triguing story, "the 19K2 almost-
Heisman of John Elway which
went to Herschel Walker." Eshle
man believes The Play cost the
Stanford quarterback Ins trophy.
"We were ahead by only one
point. With four seconds left in the
Big Game, on the kickoff return
Cal razzle-dazzlcd live laterals for a
last second touchdown. Everyone
thought a knee had gone down and
Stanford had won. There was bed
lam on the field," Eshleman ex
plains. I lie plav concluded in the
now infamous crash between the
Cal scorer and the unfortunate
Stanford tuba player.
In reliving the game. Eshleman
divulges a secret about the Axe. the
trophy for the victor of the Big
(iame. Engraved is the score Stan
ford 20-1 1 ), not the official Cal 25-
20. "We changed the score when we
won the Axe a lew years back. I m
sure if Cal ever wins, they will
quickly change it. But we've
watched the tapes and a knee \sas

down," Eshleman insists.
Moving from the Astroturf to
the polyurethane, Eshleman is
eager to tell the story of the 32-1
season record painted on the bas
ketball from the 1990 Women's Na
tional Championship Team featur
ing Jennifer Azzi.
"What was that one loss all
about?" Eshleman asks. "The
team got snowed in outside Pull
man. Wash, and the girls were
forced to sleep on a local high
school gym floor. I'he next day
they just weren't at 1(H) percent
when they lost their only game of
the season" across the state at
Washington.
With a waiting list of aspiring
potential inductees, the Hall of
Fame is continually evolving, meld
ing the past and present into one
Stanford sports history. Although
Tiger Woods is not eligible tor
membership until 2(K).V five years
from his entering class's graduation
year, a Sports Illustrated cover
bearing his likeness is already on
display.
Docent Mill O'Brien claims
Stanford's Hall ot lame is recog
nized as an outstanding facility be
cause it represents both men and
women in a wide range of sports.
"Even ( al came to Stanford to see
how we built our 1 fall of Fame."
