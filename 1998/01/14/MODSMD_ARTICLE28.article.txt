In a sports world seemingly pop
ulated by Sprewells and Simpsons.
Nastasies and Nagurskis. it is per
ilously easy to forget the Kendalls.
A starting 190-pounder on the
Stanford wrestling team, Tim
Kendall is one of the team's, and
probably the sport's, genuinely
nice guys.
Wrestling is a brutal sport. It's
not like baseball, or volleyball or
tennis; very few people play it for
fun. Those who do it do it to win.
and take losing very seriously.
So after a close loss to Andrie
Rodzianko of Pennsylvania,
Kendall had every right to be dis
appointed, even bitter. The red
shirt sophomore, however, eould
do nothing but heap praise on cap
tain Jeff Grant s effort against
Penn All American Brandon Slav
in the lb7-pound division. He
clearly took just as much satisfac
tion in his teammate's success as he
did disappointment in his own mis
fortune.
Simply put, Tim Kendall is a
class act.
"Tim's a real team player." said
teammate Jon Penn. "Everyone on
the team respects and likes him."
Moderately recruited out of
Palmer High School in Colorado
Springs. Colorado, Kendall red
shirted as a 167-pounder. With in

juries to both the 177- and Im
pound starters. Kendall was then
called upon to "wrestle up" to the
190-pound weight class during his
freshman season.
"1 did pretty well, actualh
Kendall said with typical under
statement. "I beat a few guys when
I wrestled up. I think I went 2-1."
The first legacy in Stanford
wrestling history (his father was a
two-time captain), Kendall has
turned in a respectable 5-9 overall
record. 5-4 in tournaments. I 'nfoi
tunately. Kendall has suffered per
haps more than anyone else on the
team from the lack of a heavy
weight.
"He's been put in some really
difficult spots with our forfeit at
heavyweight." said teammate
Kayvon Bina.
Against Cal State Bakersfield
and San Francisco State, Stanford

victories.
"I think it was a factor," Kendall
said of the match against San Fran
cisco State, in which he also suf
fered a bite wound on his right
pinkie finger.
"That was weird. Intuitively,
you think that would enrage you,
hut I think it almost had the oppo
site effect." Kendall said.
Despite his solid performance at
tournaments this year, Kendall de
scribes his overall record as "lack
luster," and hopes to turn it around
with a solid showing at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships and
the NCAAs. He'll face stiff compe
tition from 190s at Cal State Bak

ersfield and Oregon State, but he is
confident about his prospects.
"I think I've had some trouble
picking up where 1 left off last
year." Kendall says. "But it's
gonna be a dogfight (at the Pac-10
tournament) — 1 think everyone is
pretty beatable."
Kendall sees the team at "some
thing of a crossroads," having faced
tough Penn and Lehigh teams and
coming away winless. With the
stretch run ahead, he feels Stanford
is on the brink of reaching the level
needed to produce placewinners at
the Pac-lOs.
As for himself. Kendall is, as
usual, modest.

"I'd like to place high at our next
tournament. Well, place, because
it's going to be a really tough field.
But when I get momentum, I can
really go with it."
