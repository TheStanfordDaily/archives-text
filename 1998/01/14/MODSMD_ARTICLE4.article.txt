Backpedaling on a promise to create a guide to cours
es at Stanford by earh winter quarter, the ASSl is ask
ing students to take a rain check for delivers in spring.
A month ago, after the Facultv Senate dropped its ob
jection to releasing quantitative information from course
evaluations, the ASSl predicted students would be able
to access a pilot, World Wide Web-based version of its
guide by the start of winter quarter.
Instead, due to unanticipated difficulties in gathering,
compiling and presenting course data, the ASSl will re
lease the guide in time for selecting spring quarter cours
es.
"The winter quarter guide was intended to be a small
scale pilot project to learn about the process." said senior
Jesse Oxfeld, editor of the course guide. "Putting it up on
the World Wide Web is not as easy as it sounds"
One of the concerns motivating the decision to delav
publishing a guide was the fear that premature release of
a sloppy product would discredit the guide in the eyes of
students and facult\
"We wanted to do [a guide] in a wa\ the professors
would respect." Oxfeld added. "We didn't feel we could
get out something that would be useful to students, and
that the I ni\ersit\ powers-that-be would respect."
Adds sophomore Matt Spence. ASSl Senate deput\
chair and director of the course guide project, "the Web
was an experimental testing ground to iron out all the
kinks."
Fhe course guide w ill be available by spring, but some
expecting to use the course guide to pick their winter
quarter courses felt misled.
"I'm disappointed." said sophomore Doy Charn
supharindr "That was one promise 1 was hoping the
ASSl would keep."
"I'm upset." said sophomore Erik Andersen. "It
would be a very \ aluable tool.. . for people w ho have not
chosen their courses "
Printed versions of the spring guide will arrive in stu
dents' mailboxes before next quarter and w ill also be ac
cessible through the Web. according to Oxfeld. It will
contain quantitative data about student opinion gathered
from the course evaluations students fill out at the end of
the quarter. Courses from the School ot Humanities and
Sciences in which more than 50 percent of students fill out
class evaluations will be included.
Students will also be able to read a short svllabusof the
