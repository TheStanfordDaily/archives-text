# Speaker Goldstone calls for justice in war crimes
## South African judge praises truth commissions 
### Dan Arnold 
Justice Richard Goldstone spoke at the
School of Law yesterday about his expen
ences investigating crimes against humanity in
South Africa. Rwanda and the former Yu
goslavia.
Cioldstone. a member of the Constitutional
Court of South Africa â€” the nation's highest
court, has worked as a judge in various South
African courts since PJBO. during which time
he participated in trials that were milestones in
the elimination of apartheid.
From iwi to IW4, Cioldstone chaired
South Africa's Commission of Inquin Re
garding Public Violence and Intimidation,
which became known as the (ioldstone ( oni
mission. From IW4 to Goldstone was
the chief prosecutor of the I 'nited Nations In
ternational ("riminal Tribunals for the former
Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
In his lecture. Cioldstone discussed the im
portance ot w.tr crimes investigations both as
a means to bring perpetrators to justice and as
.i w ay to make crimes against humanity public.
He said that most "victims want a public ac
knowledgment of crimes."
In the hope of avoiding the "opening of old

wounds." many people ha\ c called for blanket
amnesty for war criminals, particularlv in
South Africa (ioldstone Ux>k the opposite
position saying that "people in a decent soci
ety are entitled to full justice."
Furthermore, Goldstone said he believes
that the full exposure of war criminals is an im
portant step in preventing future conflict. He
cited the former Yugoslavia as an example of
.i country w here civil war has occurred for cen
turies and grown more hlood\ over the years
because the perpetrators were never brought
to justice.
Particularly in regards to the former Yu
goslavia. he said. "I have no doubt that coun
tries who say. let s |ust forget about it." are
going to pay a very. very heaw price."
Asking the question "How do we tackle
past massive human rights violations?" Gold
stone contrasted two different methods for
bringing war criminals to justice: war crimes
tribunals and truth commissions
War crimes tribunals, used in Yugoslavia,
are designed to prosecute and punish war
criminals often with either long imprisonment
or death W hen war crimes tribunals are eni
ployed. (ioldstone said, war crimi
nals hide their pasts to avoid punish
ment. He also said that too few peo
ple are brought to justice by tri
bunals to either give an accurate pic
ture of the scope of the crimes com
mitted or to bring satisfaction to
most victims.
Truth commissions, used in
South Africa to uncover crimes
committed during the reign of
apartheid, offer amnesty to those

who publicly and fully disclose the
nature of their crimes. Truth com
missions focus on reporting and
recording all of the crimes and
events that occurred rather than
punishing specific people, Gold
stone explained.
Truth commissions anger some
victims who would like to see war
criminals more harshly punished.
According to (ioldstone. however,
most people who confess in order
to receive amnesty would not even
have been discovered with a tri
bunal.
He asserted that truth commis

sions are a better system of investi
gation because they are so effective
at uncovering the full scope of
crimes committed.
(ioldstone believes that interna
tional justice is vital to ensuring
that the 21st century is less bloody
than the 20th. He called for public
opinion to push governments to in
vestigate war crimes.
(ioldstone is giving a series of
lectures at the law school on war
crimes as a Herman Phleger Visit
ing Professor. One hundred and
fifty people attended yesterday's
event.
