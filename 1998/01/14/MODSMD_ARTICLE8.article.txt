FOR THE RECORD
A column in lasl Wednesday's science section inaccurately stated that the weight loss drug
"Phen-Fen" had been withdrawn from the market. The "Phen-Fen" treatment is actually
made up of two drugs one of which, fenfluramine, has been withdrawn at the request of the
Food and Drug Administration. The other component drug, phentermine, is still on the mar
ket and is still used to treat obesity. The article also stated that people with "prolonged expo
sure" to the drug should consult a physician. In fact, the government recommends that any
one who has been exposed to fenfluramine or the related drug dexfenfluramine have an
echocardiogram before having surgery or dental work.
An article on the front page of Monday's Daily misspelled the name of a KZSU announcer,
whose correctly spelled name is Ray Salloom
