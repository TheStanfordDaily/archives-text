Welcome back. Now that the holidays are over, it's time to jumpstart your workout routine and put that New
Year's resolution into action. You remember your resolution, right 7 That's the vow you made to hit the gym every
day and whip yourself into shape And speaking of "whipping," thanks to everyone who helped whip Cal and
bring home the NIKE Axe to the Farm in the first-ever NIKE Axe Games. The spoils of victory (the Axe, that is)
can be viewed in the IM Office
