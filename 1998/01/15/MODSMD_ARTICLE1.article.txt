# Stories about ourselves
## Experts on race speak out 
### Shalini Bhargava 
In an evening of storytelling demonstrating the impor
tance of bringing race and ethnicity into the national dis
course, University of Pennsylvania Law Prof. Lani
(iuinier and University of Texas Law Prof. Gerald Torres
addressed an audience of about 200 in Kresge Auditori
um last night.
Torres, an expert on critical race theory and environ
mental law and a member of Stanford's class of 1974. said
that storytelling is the "central methodology of critical
race theory." To explain the rationale behind the uncon
ventional format, Torres said. "This is intended to be a dy
namic process in which you're engaged as much as we are
engaged."
During the lecture entitled, "Why Race Matters: A
( onversation" both speakers emphasized the need to re
think the notions of race, ethnicity, merit and community.
(iuinier. author of "Tyranny of the Majority," said that
"race does matter — not because of individual experi
ences" but because race is linked to people's attempts "to
work their way into the conversation." (iuinier empha
sized the need to "open up the national discourse" to all
viewpoints, especially those of marginalized groups tradi
tionally barred from participating.
In 1993. President Clinton nominated (iuinier to head
the Justice Department's civil rights division, but later re
voked the nomination amid claims her ideas on race and
minority rights were extremist.
According to (iuinier. those in positions of power au
tomatically blame marginalized groups when confronted
by issues of scarcity and resource allocation. "The debate
|on such issues] is limited to the elites, those speaking from
privileged positions, speaking to each other in code,"
(iuinier said.
Torres said race is "malleable," claiming its function
depends on its context. Similarly, (iuinier presented a
metaphor of race as water. Depending on external condi
tions. race either binds a person to his or her race, like
molecules in an ice cube, or allows for individual autono
my, like the free molecules of steam.
(iuinier dismissed color blindness, regarded bv many
