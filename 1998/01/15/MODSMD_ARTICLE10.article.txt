ALGIERS, Algeria (AT)
Algeria has called oil a visit by
European officials seeking ways to
end worsening bloodshed in this
North African nation because the
delegation lacks seniority, the for
eign minister said yesterday.
In the latest violence, a bomb
concealed in a folded prayer rug
exploded yesterday in a mosque
outside Algiers, killing one person
and injuring eight, witnesses and
medical sources said. I here was no
claim of responsibility.
Earlier. Algerian police freed a
leader of the banned Islamic Salva
tion I ront a day after detaining him.
party sympathizers said. Abdelkad
er Hachani was arrested after inter
views with him were published in
several European newspapers. I lie
government has warned members
of the I'iont not to speak publicly.
The government's refusal to
accept a visit by a European Union
delegation echoed Algeria's previ
ous rejections of international aid or
investigations into six years of vio
lence that have killed an estimated
75,(KX) people.
The delegation, made up of offi
cials from the foreign ministries of

Britain, Austria and Luxembourg,
was to visit Algeria for three days
starting Friday.
But Foreign Minister Ahmed
Altai said the diplomats, who
sought Cabinet-level meetings in
Algiers, held a "very modest level of
responsibility."
" I here is an unacceptable imbal
ance." Altai told reporters. "The
mission has lost its meaning."
Algeria traditionally has viewed
any efforts to intervene in its
domestic crises as swipes at its
sovereignty. I lie Arab League,
based in ( aim. supported that posi
tion yesterday.
" I he Arab I eague is against any
foreign interference in Algeria.
What would the European coun
tries do if an Arab country said it
wanted to send a team to investigate
the sheltering of terrorists on its ter
ritories?" undersecretary Ehab
Muqbel asked in a statement.
The U.S. State Department
expressed regret over the Algerian
decision. "The Algerian govern
ment has lost an opportunity to
respond to the legitimate concerns
of the international community,"
spokesman James I oley said.
