BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Iraq
denied allegations yesterday that it
used prisoners as guinea pigs to test
biological agents, saying the claim
was concocted as a ploy to gain
access to sensitive Iraqi sites.
Speaking for the government.
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
also insisted that U.N. weapons
teams were still skewed in favor of
Americans and Britons. American
team leader Scott Ritter would not
he allowed to work. Aziz said,
because there were too many
"Anglo-Saxons" on his crew.
In New York, the U.N. Security
Council adopted a statement saying
it "deplores" Iraq's blocking of Rit
ter and "Iraq's subsequent failure to
fulfill its obligations to provide the
(inspectors) with full, unconditional
and immediate access to all sites."
With positions hardened on both
sides. Russia, though signing into the
U.N. statement, reiterated its fusal
to consider using force against Iraq.
Speaking in Moscow. Russian For
eign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
urged talks instead.
The foreign minister, who played

a key role in resolving a similar crisis
in November, spoke with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright by tele
phone Tuesday, Russia's Interfax
news agency reported.
Ritter. who is tasked with check
ing Iraqi ministries and other gov
ernment sites, was blocked from
working for a second day yesterday
when the government did not send
required Iraqi escorts.
Aziz was asked at a news confer
ence about reports that Ritter was
trying to check allegations that
chemical and biological agents were
tested on Iraqi prisoners in the sum
mer of 1995.
"That is one of the lies that is
being used as a pretext for intrud
ing" into sites, such as the intelli
gence agency headquarters, which
Iraq considers a violation of its
sovereignty.
Asked a second time about the
allegation that prisoners were used
as guinea pigs. Aziz said: "Never. It
is a sheer lie."
Aziz asserted that the head of the
U.N. Special Commission. Aus
tralian Richard Butler, has ignored

Iraq's picas for a more balanced
makeup of inspection teams. The
deputy prime minister said nothing
has changed since last fall's crisis
when Iraq ordered American
inspectors out of the country on the
grounds they were spies.
"This should he corrected, and
this is the duty of the executive chair
man (Butler)," Aziz said. "He
should not take sides with the Amer
icans and British against Iraq. He
should be neutral."
Aziz said he will discuss that issue
with Butler when the U.N. official
comes to Iraq this week.
U.N. inspectors must certify that
Iraq has eliminated its weapons ol
mass destruction before punishing
U.N. trade sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's IWO invasion of Kuwait, can
be lifted.
Iraq has said that thousands ol
people, especially children and the
elderly, have died as a result ol
shortages of food and medicine.
Yesterday's unanimous Security
Council statement was sought by th£
United States as a show of support
for Butler. *.
