NBC retains ER
PASADENA. Calif. (AF) — The doctors at
"ER" will keep operating on NBC" for three
more years, as the network moved swiftly yes
terday to lock up television's top-rated drama
after suffering the double blow of losing "Sein
feld" and NFL football.
NB(' agreed to buy 22 original episodes per
year of "ER" from Warner Bros. Television for
a licensing fee that industry sources estimated at
$13 million per show. NBC has been getting
"ER" for less than $2 million per show in a deal
that ends this season.
"Obviously, it's a fabulous deal for our side
and hopefully for NBC," said Robert Daly,
chairman of Warner Brothers. "It's the biggest
deal that has ever been made in the history of
television as far as series are concerned."
The ensemble medical drama based in Chica
go's Cook County Hospital was an instant hit
upon its premiere in September 1994. It usually
vies with "Seinfeld." its neighbor on NBC's
powerful Thursday night lineup, to be televi
sion's most-watched show each week.
Its fate became a matter of intense specula
tion due to an unusual contract provision that
allowed "ER" to essentially become a free agent
and move to another network if it couldn't reach
a deal with NBC' by the end of February.
The stakes became higher for NBC when

"Seinfeld" announced last month it would cease
production at the end of this season. NBC. tops
in the network ratings, was also hurt this week
when it lost the rights to broadcast National
Football League games to CBS and was outbid
by ABC for "Monday Night Fcx>tball."
Race dialogues begin
LOS ANGELES (AF) — When the OJ.
Simpson murder trial pitted blacks against
whites, a city councilman wedged himself in the
middle and invited people to talk about race.
A Day of Dialogue. Mark Ridley-Thomas
called it.
Starting yesterday and leading up to Mon
day's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, cities
across the country are holding similar frank dis
cussions about race, color and ethnicity.
"What I found is that what starts off as a dia
logue on race becomes a discussion of some
thing else." said former N.J. Sen. Bill Bradley, a
participant in Los Angeles.
"Maybe it's about people's ... aspirations,
their fears, their hopes." he said. "One or two
days of dialogue isn't going to solve anything.
This is only the beginning."
Ridley-Thomas convened the first Day of
Dialogue to discuss racial tensions after Simpson
was acquitted in October 1995 on murder
charges in the slaving of his former wife Nicole

Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman.
Since then, the city has held dialogues on a
variety of topics, including race relations, affir
mative action and violence.
Haitan immigrant retracts claim

put on hold its investigation of the Aug. 9 inci

don't doubt Lxmima's central allegation: that
police beat him and sodomized him with a stick

ized for two months.

never been interrupted." I S Attorney Zacharv
