Dining services should
allow for more flexibility
in the use of meals

THE START OF a new quarter sig
nals the beginning of new endeavors
— new teachers, new classes, new
>' activities. It also signals the beginning of a
|i new quarter of dining service meals: points
ii are in abundant supply, the meals are jnst'd
!! little hit better and the precious three guest
;! meals allotted to meal plan holders per
!' quarter are restored.
Dining services should allow meal plan
holders to use their 12. 14 or 19 meals per
■; week anytime and on anyone they choose.
•! Limiting students to three guests per quar
ter severely undermines the social aspect of
!• meals and takes advantage of those who fre

" quently miss meals.
Students enjoy dining with friends. Resi
dential Education emphasizes that eating
together fosters a cohesive undergraduate
J: community. Vet. the ability of any student
; on a meal plan is limited when it comes to
, inviting friends who do not live in their resi
! dence to dine with them. An allowance of
• three meals out of the 2(X) offered in dining
halls each quarter is ridiculous. These guest
j meals turn into hoarded commodities to be
doled out to only the most privileged
i friends.
Furthermore, each student pays for the

meals in advance and should be allowed to
use them as he or she wishes. It is ludicrous
that in a week when a student misses two
meals that he or she should not be able to
redeem those meals later in the week bv
inviting two friends over for dinner. Many
students frequently miss meals and lose
money in the process — food service unfair
ly reaps the monetary benefits of uneaten
meals.
In the last two years, both Rickeir and
Stern have converted from a point system to
;f meal plan system!* This |has limitod the
opportunities students previously had to
both invite guests and maximize the value of
their meal plan.
Houses with private chefs frequently
allow six to eight guests per meal — and
these houses generally have around 50 resi
dents. These houses manage to feed the
extra mouths and offer their residents
options that enable friends to dine with
them. Dining halls prepare food for 2(K)-S(K)
students, which should theoretically make
them better able to accommodate larger
crowds (especially considering that a sizable
number of residents will be absent at any
given meal). Running out of food has never
been a problem at campus dining halls and
thus a more flexible meal plan usage system
would likely be sustainable.
Housing and Dining Services should
explore the possibility of extending the
options available to students for unused
meals — allowing only three guest meals
per quarter is restrictive and unfair.
