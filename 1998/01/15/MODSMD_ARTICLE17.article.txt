MARY: HELLO.
I'm Mary Hart.
Stephen: And
I'm Stephen Jay Gould.
And this is Intellectuals
Tonight lor Jan. 15, 2(X)<S.
Mary: It was another
star-studded gala at the

opening of the new Planet Harvardwood in
Palo Alto. California. We go now to our
own Ishmael Reed.

rant.
Ishmael: Thanks. Mary. There's no need
for any free-lance pall bearers here, because
this party is certainly alive and kicking! The
fans have turned out in droves to check out
all the celebrity memorabilia. There's a copy
of Fermat's last theorem, an autographed
Skinner box and a pencil once owned by
Max Weber. Everyone has also been playing
the hot new game, "Six Degrees of Sir Fran
cis Bacon."

restaurant booth.
Eve Kosovksky Sedgwick: OK, Bryan
Denton was heavily cited by Jack Kelly, who
... who ...
Alan Taylor: ... who held an endowed
chair of Sarah Jacobs, who translated
"Novum Organum" written by ... Francis
Bacon!!"
Luc Montagnier and Edward Said laugh
and high five each other.
Ishmael: Back to you Mary and Stephen!
Stephen: Thanks, Ishmael. Things aren't
looking as fun over at New Boston College,
where popular instructor Maya Lin has
declined the latest offer of $5 million per lec
ture. despite the incredible and record
breaking popularity of her a.m. lectures.
"I'm not sure how NBC will fill the hole in
our Thursday Must-See-Lectures." admit
ted the dean.

Mary: WjII. it's now official: the hottest
selling item of the past holiday season is
Tickle-Me-Rousseau, narrowly edging out
Edward Tufte with Kung-Fu Grip, Malibu
Barbie Ehrenreich and Silicon Graphics' S-
G.l. Joe.
Stephen: In addition, forget basketball's
Air Jordan, the existentialist's choice is
Descartes' Cogito Air-go Sum.
Mary: This weekend get ready for anoth
er installment of the ever popular
"Research's Funniest Bloopers and Blun
ders." hosted by Dick Clark and bell hooks.
( ut to a clip from the show. Dick and Hell
are chatting with llenry Louis dales, Jr.
Dick: So, Henry, I understand you had a
problem with signs.
Henry: I was running regressions, and 1
misread a positive beta coefficient as nega
tive! Threw off the whole R-squared, which
almost lost us the Culture Wars!
( lit back to the studio.
Stephen: Ouch! That must have come
back to haunt him the next time he submit
ted a grant application! In other TV news.
Bill Cosby premieres his new show, "Junior
Faculty Say the Darnedest Things."
( ut to footage of a new assistant professor
sitting with Hill ('osby.
Bill: What does it mean to be a faculty
member?
Asst. Prof.: I emphasize my teaching and
work with students. 1 mean. I just know
that's what's going to get me tenure.
Peals of uproarious laughter emerge from
the audience/faculty senate. "Oh. isn't that
cute!" shouts one.
Mary: Bill's show joins ABC's popular
Thank Goodness I'm Faculty line-up, where
it follows veteran Lifestyles of the /'enured
and Published.
Stephen: Prof. Kathie Lee Clifford is in
the news again to answer charges about
working conditions in one of her labs.

( ui to clip of Kathy Lee, struggling to
hold hack tears she says,"I had no idea that
inv research assistants were working such
long hours photocopying and washing glass
ware and at such pathetic wages."
Mary: It's almost live years to the clay
since Kathie Lee was last the center of con
troversy, when she w;is denied tenure. Hut
who can forget how her good friends Sting
and Deepak Chopra released the special
peer-reviewed edited volumes "Hands
Across Academia" and "We are the
Tenured." featuring chapters by Noam
Chomsky, Quentin Crisp, Amitai Etzioni
and Julie Taymor.
Stephen: Speaking of, celebrating tenure
today are: ( ornel West, Anna Deavere
Smith, I )avid I lo and Akhil Gupta.
Mary: Moving from tenure to l()-years,
we finally have turn to our IT Flashback,
where we remember what campuses were
like a decade ago. That's when we just start
ed recognizing the "Academostar" craze,
where universities started the bidding wars
over intellectuals who might boost the
schools reputation and prestige. Back then
a hot faculty member could be lured to
another university with reduced teaching
loads, increased research assistance and
housing subsidies. Star faculty helped
departments leap to the top of national
rankings, but critics complained this market
system diverted attention away from schol
arship and teaching some stars never saw
the classroom and focused solely on pres
tige. We've certainly come a long way since
then!
Stephen: That's / / for now. Goodnight!
