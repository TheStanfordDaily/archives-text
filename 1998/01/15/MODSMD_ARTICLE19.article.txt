\ Disgruntled with Grundy
' Over the past months, I've read Garry
4 Grundy's columns with interest. Although
| I've often disagreed with his message, I've
) never questioned his presentation — until
j now.
» Cirundy's "Open letter to the people of
i California" crosses the line of good taste
\ into idiocy. As if his same old diatribe
£ advocating smoke-filled bars and linking
I smoothies to anorexia wasn't bad enough.
J now he's telling Californians to "start your
iown damn country ... just take your shit,
and leave."
• In the past, I've seen Grundy speak out
j against racism. Isn't his tirade about C'ali
»fornians' "police brutality, abortion, xeno
phobia. veganism and institutionalized
racism" nothing more than a long string of
,stereotypes? Perhaps Grundy thinks that
| regional stereotypes are somehow less
! offensive than those of the ethnic variety.
At the same time. Mr. Grundy seems to
■oppose California's policy of preventing
[ ' unwanted residents (i.e. Mexicans)" from
entering the state. He then mentions how

tough it is to be Mexican in California.
Perhaps he is unaware of the distinction
between legal and illegal immigration. It's
supposed to be tough to be an illegal immi
grant; you see, that's because being an illegal
immigrant is "illegal" irrespective of whether
the country of origin is Mexico or England.
Grundy's use of the term "Furher |sic|
Wilson" is downright insulting. However
much he may disapprove of Gov. Wilson's
conservative stance, comparing him with a
man who murdered millions is uncon
scionable. (Alter comparing Wilson with
Hitler, (irundv later becomes confused and
flips to the opposite end of the political
spectrum, calling California a "Dcpiocratic
Republic" — but never nund.)
In any case, is Cirundy's solution to our
country's problems to simply jettison any
area where anything he disagrees with
occurs? In that case, I certainly hope he
enjoys deep-dish pi//a. bratwursts and
cheese fries, because I'd hate to see my
home city of ( hicago be forced to sever its
ties with the Union.

Column is vindictive
Garry (irundy's vindictive articlc
attacking California is tilled with narrow
minded biases and ecological fallacies. Not
only does it give Ari/oiiiins and minorities
a had image, it makes you look like an
illogical, irrational, whiny brat.
On hehall of all Californians. you may
go back to your beloved Arizona and stay
there. Or try living in some of your other
choice areas: for instance, why don't you
try being a gay black in Bible Belt, USA?
Why are you here in California anyway?
What we need are doers, not ungrateful
winners who offer no solutions to the prob
lems affecting all of America, not just Cali
fornia.
.lust so you know, while cigarette smok
ing and second hand smoke are some of he
leading causes of DEATH in America,
marijuana causes no scientifically proven
physical harm (from "Abnormal Psychol
ogy" by Psychology Prof. David Roscn
han).
And so. the validity of your complaint
about this subject would be ... anything

but rational and concretely provable.
Moral of your article: think before you
speak. Only the jealous imitate and then
complain.

Men also suffer in silence
Let me state emphatically that I would
never envy a woman for the sufferings par
ticular to her gender. Be that as it may.
Kerry Rodgers makes it seem like women
know mainly pain while men know only
joy.
She relates her own physical trauma and
mentions the ordeals of neighbors and
friends. Then she goes on to mention a fra
ternity holding a basketball tournament,
with the tacit message that men enjoy
themselves while women suffer.
She states that "there is an essential dif
ference between the experiences of the
sexes, one of which is being muffled by
shame and silence, while the other is being
lived out loud."

I submit that, if anything, her gender
stereotypes are reversed. All over the
media and in private groups of friends,
women feel Irce to talk about anything and
everything they're going through, physical
ly and emotionally.
I hey rarely fail to find a sympathetic
ear. Can you imagine a man doing this
without being labeled '"a wuss." by men
and women alike? I think not.
Maybe that's why she doesn't see men in
pain. As a man. though, it's easy to see
who's really suffering in silence.
Somewhere there's a man in a dorm
going through some unmentionable physical
ordeal, which he won't be writing about
later that clay, lie doesn't see other men in
pain, because they're holding it 111. refusing
lo let it show. However. I'm sure there is a
sorority party near his dorm, their loud
music wafting through his windows and
reminding him of a different double stan
dard.
If misery loves company, women are in
a lot better shape than men.
