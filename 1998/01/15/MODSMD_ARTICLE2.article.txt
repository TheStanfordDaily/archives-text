# More than parties
## Social planning for grads beefed up 
### Brad Kane 
In ;i further move to improve the
quality of graduate student life on
campus. Dean of Students Marc
Wais has announced plans to hire a
graduate student to help plan social
events for the graduate student
community.
The student, who will work in
close conjunction with Wais and the
ASSIJ Graduate Student Council
on a part-time basis, will lead a larg
er group (if graduate students in
planning, organizing and executing
graduate student social functions.
Wais will decide upon a student to
till the position by Jan. 20.
In addition to planning new so
cial events, the group will aim to in
crease student involvement with the
University and enhance efforts to
promote existing social programs. It
will be composed of graduate stu
dents from all different academic
programs.
Graduate student life came into
sharp focus last spring when the
ASSIJ released the results of a sur
vey conducted by its own Commit
tee on Academics. Research and
Evaluation. The survey reflected
sentiment that the University was
not making any noticeable effort to
improve graduate student life.
Wais said it is a real challenge to
work with a group as diverse as the
graduate student population, refer
ring to its wide variation in age, mar
ital status and ethnicity. "I've been
delighted with the success we've had
so far," Wais said.
That success has come in the
form of two University-sponsored
events over the past nine months.
Last May's spring mixer attracted

more than 8(X) graduate students,
while November's Jazz Fiesta
brought in nearly 1.2(H) â€” making it
the largest graduate social function
in recent years.
But not everybody wants big par
ties. "Everyone who went (to the
Jazz Fiesta] had a really good time,"
said Susan Owen, a doctoral student
and member of the graduate stu
dent council. "But that type of event
targets a specific audience, and
there are nearly H.(KK) graduate stu
dents at Stanford. One big party
isn't going to solve everybody's so
cial needs."
This concern will be one of many
addressed by the new group. Wais
said. The group will be organizing
not only large-scale events like the
Jazz Fiesta, but smaller-scale, more
intimate events as well. Ideas in
clude theater trips, hikes to the Dish
and "random dinners" in which stu
dents are randomly paired together
for an evening of food and fun. Ad
ditionally, Wais said he hopes to see
more educational programs, allow
ing graduate students to gain practi
cal knowledge within a social con
text.
Wais also said he hopes the
group will encourage graduate stu
dents to interact with students out
side of their own academic spheres.
"We recognize that a grad stu
dent's primary affiliation is with his
or her department, program or
school," Wais said, "but we want
them to be able to engage each
other in the context of the I Iniversi
tv as well. The purpose of the com
mittee is to provide social opportu
nities for grad students from differ
ent disciplines to get to meet one an
other."
Graduate student response to
the announcement has been posi
tive. "The administration is putting
a lot of time and money into grad
student events," said Owen. "It's a
reallv good sign to see them giving

us their continued support."
"I think [the new group] is a great
idea," said I larris Shapiro, a doctor
al student in physics and an ex offi
cio member of the Graduate Stu
dent Council."It will definitely help
get grad students out of their cubi
cles and into some sort of social ac
tivity, and it's a necessary step to
ward a larger graduate student com
munity."
