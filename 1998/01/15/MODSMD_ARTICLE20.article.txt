## Learning from the land down under 
### 
Paul Bodnar

Australia is known to most
Americans as the "land down
under," replete with kangaroos,
boomerangs, crocs and, of course, that
paragon of Australian cuisine, Vegemite.
And as a friend snidely remarked as I pre
pared to journey there for winter break,
Australia was once a continent-sized prison
for British criminals. Yet in my travels in
central Australia, an area largely inhabited
and governed by indigenous Aborigines, I
came to realize that this former penal
colony has much to teach "the land of the
free and the home of the brave" about racial
reconciliation.
Consider this: both Australian Aborig
ines and Native Americans were displaced
and murdered en masse as white settlers
seized their homelands. Both groups now
constitute around one percent of their
nation's population, and both rank among
the most disadvantaged groups in their
countries, whether measured in status,
income or life expectancy.
Beginning in the 17(X)s, Aborigines were
swept off their tribal lands as the British set
tled the continent. Millions of them were
killed in the process, and hunting Aborig
ines for sport was common in the Northern
Territory until the 19505. Indigenous peo
ples won citizenship only in 1%7, before

which they were classified under flora and
fauna laws. Today, fewer than 300,000 Abo
rigines remain.
Nevertheless, Australian politicians and
intellectuals are facing their country's
weighty historical legacy with remarkable
openness. In Australia, Aboriginal land
rights are a center-stage, volatile political
issue. In 1996, the racist remarks of one of
Australia's leading female politicians
prompted a public uproar, and recently, the
government of Prime Minister John
Howard has threatened to resign if a bill
curtailing Aboriginal land rights is not
passed by the national legislature.
And this is not just a case of political
histrionics. The so-called reconciliation
movement has resulted in returning almost
10 percent of the continent's landmass to
Aborigines. Slowly and painfully, Australia
is grappling with its past. Despite policy dis
agreements among national leaders, Abo
riginal issues command interest, awareness
and respect throughout the country. Abo
rigines are featured on Australian currency,
and the organizers of the Sydney Olympics
plan to highlight their culture during the fes
tivities.
Contrast this with the virtual political
invisibility of Native American issues in the
United States. To be sure, we are occasion

ally reminded of the brutality with which
eastern settlers in their western migration
"displaced" Native Americans. These days,
grade school history textbooks venture to
address the issue, albeit gingerly. Progres
sive institutions of higher education have
even formed Native American studies pro
grams and cultural centers.
But despite a history of attempted exter
mination similar to that of Australia, indige
nous rights largely remain ignored in the
American mainstream media and do not
constitute a major national political issue.
Most often, the displacement of indigenous
peoples is framed in the context of Ameri
can "manifest destiny" and the brave
adventure of exploring and mastering a new
continent. A memorial to a Native Ameri
can woman in a national park embodies this
interpretation: "Here lies a Wampanoag,
whose family and tribe gave of themselves
and their land that this great nation might
be born and grow." Indeed, this myth of
westward expansion has evolved into collec
tive American memory.
Certainly, this phenomenon cannot be
explained by a lack of initiative and effort
on the part of Native American advocacy
groups. Indeed, in many ways Native Amer
icans are more eloquent and persistent
advocates of their cause than are the Abo-

rigines, who have assimilated to white cul
ture — and white politics — to a much less
er degree.
The difference in national political con
sciousness probably lies in the receptiveness
of the public and politicians to dealing with
such issues. Many white Australians agitate
on behalf of Aboriginal rights, and the two
main parties have recognized this as a legit
imate political issue.
In the United States, by contrast.
Democrats and Republicans have joined
forces to shove Native American issues
from the national political agenda. The
United States seeks a legal solution to the
"problem" of Native American rights with
out letting it escalate into a national debate.
It is highly unlikely that a controversy over
indigenous peoples' rights would become so
acrimonious as to dominate a national elec
tion.
There is an important lesson here for
Americans. Certainly we cannot claim that
our country has handled the issue of recon
ciliation with indigenous peoples more sym
pathetically or completely than has Aus
tralia. American history is marred by vio
lence against minorities, from 2(X) years of
slavery to the creation of Japanese intern
ment camps during World War 11.
The key difference between the United

States and Australia is that the latter is
engaging its own history in a critical way*.
Australians are working through the
painful, difficult, often divisive process of
understanding their past and healing the
wounds of history. Naturally, they have a
very long way to go before Aborigines arc
accorded the respect and equal status they
deserve, but the country is slowly moving
past the stage of collective denial. That Aus r
tralia is a former penal colony only makef
the reconciliation process underway there
all the more remarkable.
America would do well to emulate this
example. Let us not forget that before "this
great nation might be born and grow" there
occurred a genocide of monstrous proporr
tions. The United States is supposed to be
"the city on the hill." the exemplar of
democracy and freedom. If we do not strug 1
gle more openly and honestly with the bitter
truth of our national past, we are setting a
p<x>r precedent for the dozens of nascent
democracies that look to the U.S. for moral
leadership. And more importantly, we are
failing to understand the tragedies that
accompany the triumphs of being Ameri
can.
