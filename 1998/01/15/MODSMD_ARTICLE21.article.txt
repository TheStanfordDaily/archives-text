## Taking a break for a Super Bowl quiz 
### 
For our second column Vanessa
and I decided to discuss the para
mount event in sports, the pinnacle
intersection of sports and entertain
ment, the day of the year when tele
vision is most-watched and women
are most-abused â€”the Super Howl.
Kohin: Vanessa, since you're from
San Diego, the home of this year's
Super Bowl, what's the hype been
like so far?
Va: Well, as a San Diegan we gave

up any hope of the Chargers mak
ing it as soon the Pacific quarter
back took over. Hut you have the
usual pregame hysteria. You've
got those strange pennants people
hang from light posts for no reason.
I mean does that get you excited
about anything? Have you ever
been like. Wow. now I really want
to go?* And of course all the ridicu
lous Super Bowl merchandise.
Kohin: I really like those purple
bomber jackets the sportscasters
get to wear. I hope one day I too
can wear one. Hut enough about
me, who do pick in this year's
Super Bowl?
Va: I might hurt someone's feel
ings il I picked a team. Profession
al athletes have feelings top. I hope
the> all play well and have a good
experience, because we're all win
ners.
Kohin: What exactly do you mean
by that?
Va: Well let me extrapolate lor
you. I his game is supposed to be
the height of entertainment in
modern American culture. I. as an
American Studies major, find this
very interesting. I he process of the
game is what's entertaining, it's the
effort ol the athletes, not the result.
It's obvious the NFC will win. For
example, there's this certain movie
out now about a really large trans
portation tiling that sinks some
where. I don't want to give away
the ending. But millions of people
sit through over three hours of this
sinking when they obviously know
what's going to happen. Same rea
son you watch the Super Bowl.
I .eonardo I )i( 'aprio is in it.
Kohin: Well I don't know about
Leonardo DiCaprio, but I just
watch for all the new commercials.
I'm more of a college football fan.
at least until the Falcons post a win
ning record.
Va: Yes. excellent point. Con
sumerism. another cornerstone of
American popular culture.
Kohin: Well, since you don't care

about the outcome, what's your fa
vorite part of the game?
Va: Once again, a great question.
My favorite part is the ceremonial
coin toss. They make a special coin
and 15 people come out there and
throw it in the air. What better way
to start a major sporting event.than
in an activity of random chance
which coincidentally can have bets
placed on it in Las Vegas?
Kohin: I didn't know that.
Va: Obviously vou didn't take sta-

tisties for your math requirement.
Kohin: Did you want to talk more
about that?
Va: No.
Kohin: Well I know the Super
Bowl is a great day to have a party.
1 have been to many, and I'm even
throwing my own party this year in
Mirrielees room 335. What's the
best Super Bowl party you've ever
been to?
Va: Why would I go to a party that
would involve interactions with
large groups of people?
Kohin: ()k. so what do you do on
Super Bowl Sunday? You obvious
ly watch the game.
Va: I fill out The Qui/, of course.
Kohin: What qui/ is that?
Va: You mean you don't know
about The Qui/?
Kohin: No. please enlighten me
and all of our readers.
Va: Well each year, you must an
swer the five basic questions:
1. Are the sideline commentators
wearing black leather gloves?
2. Of course, who wins the coin
toss?
3. Does the first commercial in
volve (a) a car. (b) a soda, (c) beer,
(d) some kind of plastic that's in
everything we use, or (e) beer.
4. Is this year's halftimc show bet
ter or worse than the Michael Jack
son show and does it involve
Wayne Newton?
5. What color is the energy-replen
ishing beverage tossed on Mike
Holmgren's, er I mean, the win
ning coach's head?
Kohin: That sounds really exciting.
I can't believe I didn't know about
The Quiz. We should have all our
readers fill out The Quiz and send
the answers back to us.
Va: You're right. It's almost as en
trancing as a giant snake attacking
Ice-T.
Kohin: Well, it's settled. Just fill
out The Quiz as you watch the
game and the first person who an


Robin
Davidson
Vanessa
Nygaard
swers all five questions correctly
(send responses to sportsCadaily)
can he a guest in our column for one
week.
Va: Rookie quiz-takers don't break
a sweat. You still have a week and a
half to prepare.
Robin: And don't forget to enjoy
the game, or at least the commer
cials.
