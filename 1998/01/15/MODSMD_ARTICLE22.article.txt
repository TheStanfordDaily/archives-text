Considering what's at stake

7 Cardinal (14-0,3-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) can up their record to 15-0,
the best start in Stanford history, as
well as winning a school-record 19th
consecutive game at Maples Pavil
ion.

â–  TONIGHTS GAME:
USC (6-8,2-2) at No. 7 Stanford (14
0,3-0)

The squad isn't concerning itself
too much yet with Saturday's first
matchup against ;i top-10 team. The
records aren't of that much impor
tance to them either.
"I think if [being undefeated] be
comes a focal point, at some point I
think it's possible that you could
start playing n<n to lose rather than
to win." said head coach Mike
Montgomery.
"What we've got to make sure
that we do is remember that SC' is ca
pable of beating us and that we stay
focused on trying to play games as
they come. There's so many teams
[in the Pac-10] that are capable of
winning on any given day."he said.
The Trojans (ft-K. 2-2) swept both
Oregon schools at home last week to
snap their seven-game losing streak.
The team lacks size and strength

under the basket but might be able
to make up for it against the ( ardi
nal with their quickness.
Point guard Gary Johnson leads
the team in scoring with 13.2 points
per game, and also adds 4.4 assists
and 2.6 steals. He has been able to
step up when needed, leading his
team with 14 points and five assists
against Oregon and exploding
against No. 5 Arizona for a career
best 30 points.
Forward Adam Spanich will like
ly stay off the bench and start his
third game of the year for head
coach Henry Bibby. His 13.1 points
per game have been too much for
the Trojan skipper to ignore.
I !S( "s main problem has been its
defense, which is giving up 1.1 points
more than the offense can score. No
other team in the conference has a
negative scoring differential.
In order for the Irojans to win.
the backcourt will have to help de
fend down low, and that could result
in a shooting spree for Cardinal
guards Arthur Lee and Kris
Weems..
I JS(" is "not real big. but to com
pensate they have pretty good
depth, and they're very athletic." ac
cording to Montgomery. "They will
pressure some and change up de
fenses. And they have several guys
capable of having big nights.
So do the Cardinal.
The team has remained unde
feated with one of the deepest ros
ters in the country. Against Califor
nia last Saturday, four Cardinal play
ers scored in double dinits and Rvan
