## 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Considering what's at stake
tonight, people looking ahead to the
men's basketball team's clash with
No. 8 UCLA Saturday might be
missing out on quite a show.
Against USC at 7:30 p.m., the No.
7 Cardinal (14-0,3-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) can up their record to 15-0,
the best start in Stanford history, as
well as winning a school-record 19th
consecutive game at Maples Pavil
ion.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

â–  TONIGHTS GAME:
USC (6-8,2-2) at No. 7 Stanford (14
0,3-0)

The squad isn't concerning itself
too much yet with Saturday's first
matchup against ;i top-10 team. The
records aren't of that much impor
tance to them either.
"I think if [being undefeated] be
comes a focal point, at some point I
think it's possible that you could
start playing n<n to lose rather than
to win." said head coach Mike
Montgomery.
"What we've got to make sure
that we do is remember that SC' is ca
pable of beating us and that we stay
focused on trying to play games as
they come. There's so many teams
[in the Pac-10] that are capable of
winning on any given day."he said.
The Trojans (ft-K. 2-2) swept both
Oregon schools at home last week to
snap their seven-game losing streak.
The team lacks size and strength

under the basket but might be able
to make up for it against the ( ardi
nal with their quickness.
Point guard Gary Johnson leads
the team in scoring with 13.2 points
per game, and also adds 4.4 assists
and 2.6 steals. He has been able to
step up when needed, leading his
team with 14 points and five assists
against Oregon and exploding
against No. 5 Arizona for a career
best 30 points.
Forward Adam Spanich will like
ly stay off the bench and start his
third game of the year for head
coach Henry Bibby. His 13.1 points
per game have been too much for
the Trojan skipper to ignore.
I !S( "s main problem has been its
defense, which is giving up 1.1 points
more than the offense can score. No
other team in the conference has a
negative scoring differential.
In order for the Irojans to win.
the backcourt will have to help de
fend down low, and that could result
in a shooting spree for Cardinal
guards Arthur Lee and Kris
Weems..
I JS(" is "not real big. but to com
pensate they have pretty good
depth, and they're very athletic." ac
cording to Montgomery. "They will
pressure some and change up de
fenses. And they have several guys
capable of having big nights.
So do the Cardinal.
The team has remained unde
feated with one of the deepest ros
ters in the country. Against Califor
nia last Saturday, four Cardinal play
ers scored in double dinits and Rvan

Junior Kris Weems. Stanford s leading scorer, drives the lane
against Cat last week.
Mendez added eight points oft the
beneh. Four of the starting five aver
age more than 10 points a game and
small forward Peter Sauer isn't far
behind with a 9.4 average.
And with freshman center Jason
Collins expected to return either
tonight or Saturday against the Bru
ins. things are onlv looking brighter.

The Stanford lineup is so deep
that the team leader in minutes
(YVeems) is playing only 25.4 a game.
Eleven other players are seeing time
in double digits, and freshman point
guard Mike McDonald is 13th with
8.6 minutes.
Not that anyone's complaining
about playing time.
"We've got 10 or 12 guys that can
get it done," Sauer said. "We're 14-0,
so I don't think anyone has that much
to complain about. Different games

are going to be different situations as
far as playing time goes. But at the
end of the game if we win. I think
everyone is going to be satisfied with
the result."
The bench strength was very ap
parent against C'al. when power for
ward Pete Van Elswvk. starting in
place of the injured Mark Madsen,
went for a season-high 11 points and
helped hold off a second-half surge
by the Bears.
Madsen is not likely to return for

another two weeks, but with the play
of big men Jarron Collins, Mark
Seaton and Van Elswvk becoming
more and more solid each game,
Montgomery has plenty of depend
able people to fill in.
Of course, Montgomery would be
the first one to downplay all the hype.
"I wouldn't expect that we would
go undefeated." he said. "1 don't
think that's what we're really even
looking at. We're competitive with
most teams. I think. If we're able to

do the things we're capable of and if
we don't get hurt by any huge perfor
mance. 1 think we're capable of beat
ing most anyone."
Another strong point for the Car
dinal squad has been their all
around team play, which helped
pushed them past the Bears last
weekend.
Stanford racked up 19 assists
compared to Cal's nine. And while
everyone on the Stanford bench
seemed to contribute something to

the Cardinal cause. Cal relied solely
on guard Geno Carlisle for 22 of its
41 second-half points.
The squad knows it will have to
continue posting these kinds of re
sults to keep winning.
Being undefeated is "good for
confidence," Weems said. "Teams
are going to come in and give us their
best shot and we just have to give it
right back to them. But despite our
winning 14 games there's always
some things we can work on."
