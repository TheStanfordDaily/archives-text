Stuck his entire Stanford basketball c;i
reer behind Brevin Knight and Art lee. it
certainly has been easy tor Kamba I shiony i
to go relatively unnoticed. Nevertheless, this
6-foot-2 guard from Eugene. ()re . has man
aged to roll with punches successfully enough
to spend a good part of this year with a smile
on his face.
As only one of two seniors on a young
Cardinal men's basketball team, and the only
member left from the original IW4 signees.

On his shoulder. 1 shiony i has a tattoo ol a
medicine wheel symbolizing personal powei
and balance. On his ankle, he has tattoo of
an African symbol meaning I fear none
Personal power, balance, and courage are
certainly more than iust words to I shiony 1
As co-captain of the seventh ranked ( ar
dinal. I shionvi feels "like a veteran quarter
back." Being the man who has play ed longest
on the team. I shiony i has stepped up to be a
leader. He even started to feel "big brotherly
after the freshman got their grades "
Undoubtedly. Tshionyi has the life expe
rience to be any Stanford student's "big
brother."
When Tshionyi first started play ing has

that he was a future Division I play er I think

During his senior \ear at North I ugene
High School. lshion\i s talents blossomed
and he led his team to the state playoffs.
Meanwhile, he kept a straight \ average and

I shionyi's achievements at North I ugene

Ishionyi came to Stanford not only with
aspirations ol an NBA future, but also of
being a doctor. I nlortunatel). freshman
year came as a shock
"('lasses were so hard." he said.
Basketball wasn't much kinder. Plaving

decided to make some changes in his life
plans. "I think I came to a good understand

Not onl\ did Ishionyi reali/e that the

still lacked direction in life, and on
the court he was not receiving the
minutes he would have liked, 'it was
frustrating not playing when 1 felt
like 1 was finally able to contribute to
the team," he said.
During the spring, though,
Tshionyi finally found direction. He
decided that his eventual plan
would be to go to third world coun
tries, mainly in Africa, and help
them run "effective, efficient health
care."
Hs senior year also brought im
portant court minutes. With Brevin
Knight gone, Tshionyi's playing
time has increased and his on-court
presence has been increasingly valu
able. "I've been a lot happier with
my game-time contribution to the
team," he said.
As a senior, Tshionyi now knows
"what you can get away with on and
off the court." Sometimes, during
games, he will even suggest a play to
Coach Mike Montgomery.
Born to a father who is a middle
school teacher as well as a soccer
coach, coaching and teaching tempt
ed Tshionyi. He has decided,
though, that there is a "better way to
leave my mark on the world than
being a coach."
As his final year at Stanford winds
down. Tshionyi's hopes rest mainly
with the team and not his individual
career. And though he still splits

time behind Lee with freshman
Mike McDonald, he remains up
beat.

Rarely, as his friends note, does
Kamba Tshionyi not have a smile.
Of course, playing for one of the best

teams in the nation and with a bright
future as an epidemiologist, who can
blame him?
