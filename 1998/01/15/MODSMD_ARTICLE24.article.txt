Coach Mark Cook for two reasons.

good 11 k nd and Washington head
coach Bob Levesque.
"I would love for Bob to give me
rnv first NCAA win," Cook said.
Cook and Levesque have known
each other for 15 years and served on

second team All American sopho
more Larissa Fontaine. "We're not
expecting to be perfect, but we want
to get in there, work out the kinks,
get the freshmen into their first meet
and have fun."
I he Cardinal is looking especial
ly strong on the beam and on the
floor. Cook believes the team is well
trained on the beam and also thinks
the new floor routines will be excit
ing to watch. Cook is also pleased
that both senior Keri Monahan and

freshman Jenny Wilson will be doing
pike front vaults.
"We can't give [the Huskies] any
thing," said Cook. "Consistency will
be key. and we have to stick to our
landings."
Cook is also expecting co-cap
tains junior Amy Murakami and
Monahan to set the pace and play
important leadership roles. "I'm re
lying on Amy and Keri to get the
unity of the team going," said Cook.
"Gymnastics is very mental; the
team needs to have confidence so
they can perform at the level they
can."
For the freshmen on the team and
sophomore Kim Young, Friday's
meet will be their first collegiate
competition. Young was unable to
compete last year after she was side
lined for an ankle injury.
"I dreamed of doing gymnastics

for Stanford my whole life," Young
said. "I've been really thinking
about this meet for the last couple of
months hut I am going to try and
take it as calmly as possible so the
excitement doesn't get the best of
me."
Although wins and losses ulti
mately don't matter in the sport of
gymnastics (the team advances into
postseason competition based on
their performance at the Pac-10
championships on March 21st),
Cook realizes the importance of
Friday's meet. "It's going to be a
long season and Washington is in
our region as well as our confer
ence so we have to beat them." he
said.
And how does Cook feel just a
day before his first meet as a head
coach? "Nervous, excited, ready and
proud to be leading these girls."
