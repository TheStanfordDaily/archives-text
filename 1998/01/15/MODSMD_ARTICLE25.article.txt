The shocked law school players,
who expected an easy match from
the young Alondra team, shook their
heads as they walked oil the court,
they vowed vengeance when the
teams meet again later this month.
That victory, which came early in
the IVW7 Winter Quarter IM season,
is one of my favorite memories of
freshman year. We weren't a great
team, lacking si/e and any semblance
of an outside scoring threat, but we
played hard and had fun. In the true
spirit of I Ms, we played only for fun
and bragging rights.
There was a time, however, when
we would have actually been playing
for publicity. As recently as the late
80s, the Stanford Daily frequently
ran stories on IMs, from "Games of
the Week" to championship cover
age. But over time, as more sports
have gained prominence and the
Daily sports stall has dwindled, that
coverage has become virtually ex
tinct.
It's both a necessity and a
tragedy.
At a school like Stanford — where
everyone, it seems, is an ex-athlete
with stories of high school glory days
— intramurals are often showcases
for extremely talented players. Stu
dents who passed up NCAA Division
II or I-AA athletics (anything dra
matically inferior to Stanford varsity

sports, which includes Pac-10 schix>ls
with "Oregon" in their names) to
come to the Farm are stars once again
in 1M arenas. They play some great
games, and by not covering them, we
are missing some great stories.
A newspaper write-up might en
tice more students to cheer on their
housemates in athletic competition.
It might grant the program a higher
priority in the Athletic Department.
Press scrutiny might even have
solved the mystery of how the Alon
dra team went undefeated last year
and was still denied a spot in the IM
playoffs.
Hut perhaps it is better that the
Daily sports pages are reserved for
the varsity and club teams. Perhaps
the spotlight does not belong on the
intramural stage. The best way to
hear of an IM win is not in the pages
of a newspaper, but through the ex
cited shouts of returning victors ring
ing through the dorm or (in the case
of the great Alondra victory) a high
ly exaggerated e-mail to the dorm
list.
Intramurals are at their best in the
cloak of anonymity, before the silent
crowds and the invisible reporters. It
doesn't take a sports story to make a
lasting athletic memory at Stanford.
All you need is a w ill to win and a lit
tle Maples Magic.
