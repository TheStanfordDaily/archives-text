### Gaurav Misra Contributing writer 
- Stanford Student Enterprises,
provider of Sunday Flicks and other
popular services, has designed a
World Wide Web site to provide ac
cess to SSE resources over the Inter
net. The site comes online Sunday.
According to freshman SSE in
tern Karr Narula, the site will provide
information on SSE services as well
&s other features such as the ability to
vote on choices for future Flicks,
order lecture notes, apply for ASSIJ
jobs and order apparel from SSE
Custom Apparel. The interactive ser
vices will not be initially available but
will be accessible soon.
To inaugurate the Web site, SSE is
holding an online contest that also in
troduces the user to the various fea
tures of the site. The contest consists
of a scavenger hunt for information

scattered throughout the site. All
complete entries will be entered into
a drawing for the use of an ASSI' golf
cart for one month. The winner of the
drawing will be announced at Flicks
on Jan. 25 and must be present to
claim the prize.
The Web site represents the
group project completed by this
year's group of SSE interns. Started a
few years ago, this internship pro
gram takes freshmen and sopho
mores and pairs them with SSE busi
nesses. Eleven interns worked on the
Web site during fall quarter.
This quarter they will move on to
work with their assigned businesses,
completing individual projects. They
work closely with the department
managers who guide their projects.
The SSE intern program has
grown significantly over the past two
years, with many of the interns re
turning in subsequent years as project

managers. Last year, only five interns
were selected, three of whom re
turned to work for SSE this year.
"The intern program has really taken
off this year,." Narula said.
As for this year's group, the 11 in
terns were selected from a highly
competitive pool of applicants. The
program has grown so much that SSE
has formed a new division, the De
velopment Team, to guide the in
terns. The current director of devel
opment. junior Lvnne Chou, spent
her freshman year as an SSE intern.
After completing the program,
the interns are encouraged to apply
for the managerial position within
each of the SSE divisions. " These ap
plications are open to everyone, but
the interns are obviously more quali
fied." said junior Jhin Han. the Flicks
manager.
The Web site is located at
littp ://sse .Stanford .edu.
