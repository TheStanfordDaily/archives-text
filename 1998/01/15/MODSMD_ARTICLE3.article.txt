# Sororities on the Row: Part Two?
## Greek women's houseless history 
### Alison MacKinnon Contributing writer 
Stanford today seems a world
away from the Stanford of the 1940s
In those days, if you reached your
residence alter midnight during the
week or after 2 a.m. on weekends,
you would find yourself locked out
for the night. A quarter of Universi
ty housing would cost you Si 15.
The Row. the center of social life
on campus, also looked different: it
was then home to nine housed
sororities. For example, what is rum
Storey House was once the Delta
Gamma house. Muwekma-Tah
Kuk was formerly the home of Chi
Omega, and La Maison
once housed Pi Beta Phi.
The Row now might have a
chance to look as it once did. Alter
much discussion and debate in Ma\
1997. the Greek Task Force an
nounced that sororities would he el
igible to apply for housing for the
1998-99 school year.
Hut then again, back in the 19405,
sororities themselves were much dif
ferent.
Sororities played a major role in
the Stanford social scene of the earh
19405, serving not only as social
groups but career networking orga
nizations. The houses had existed on
campus along with fraternities since
I cS9I. All freshman women lived in
Roble Hall, and in the spring nearh
three-quarters of them went
through the rush process. Only a few
gained admittance to one of the nine
housed sororities. Those who were
unsuccessful were housed in Union

(what is today Old Union) or Lagu-
nita Court.
By 1944, the campus was in the
midst of great change. Many Stan
ford men left to fight in World War
II. More women were admitted, and
there was a disproportionate num
ber of women on campus. As a re
sult. the rush process became in
creasingly more competitive.
Students began advocating
changes in the system as early as
1938, when a group of Roble women
refused to pledge due to what they
deemed the system's divisive nature.
Tensions continued between the
"hall women" and those housed in
sororities.
"Much of the opposition came
from sorority members them
selves." said Sylvia Williams. Class
of '42. Williams, then a member of
Alpha Phi, enjoyed belonging to the
sorority, but like many others, she
was opposed to the increasingly re
stricted number of members.
Not even half of those who
rushed could be granted admittance.
Sororities competed for the most in
fluential members of the freshman
class. "All ol the leaders of student
organizations were sorority mem
bers." said Williams, who was the
president ol Roble Hall before join
ing Alpha Phi
Because the process was so selec
tive. rejection was common. Cam
pus legend has it that one girl com
mitted suicide after being denied ad
mission to a sorority, but there is no
evidence to support this stor\ How
ever. Williams said depression and
transferring schools was not uncom
mon and had heard of some suicide
threats, but believed them to be ei
ther rumors or jokes.
In March 1943, 19 women repre
senting both sides of the issue
formed a student coalition to review
the issue. On April 26,1944. Donald
Tresidder, then University presi
dent, announced to the student
body that sororities would be dis
continued. The announcement was
met with applause and no public
outcry-
Following the decision, sorority
houses became all-women upper
class residences along the Row.
The issue was once again raised in
1974, after the passage of the Higher
Education Act, which had lasting
consequences for womens' athletics
programs. Under the act, academic
and extracurricular opportunities
for men and women must be equal.
Therefore, if men were able to join
fraternities, women should have
similar opportunities.
In December 1977. the Universi
ty Board of Trustees reversed its
stance on sororities, although they
were not officially recognized by the
University. Sororities were not per
mitted to use Stanford's name or fa
cilities in their activities. At the same
time, a "grandfather clause" was
written into University policy to en
sure that the fraternities housed at
that time would not lose their hous

ing to the new sororities.
The reason for the denial of
recognition was due to the Universi
ty's policy concerning student
groups, which stated that "the selec
tion process [for student groups]
may not in any way involve persons
from outside the University for the
purpose of influencing either the de
cisions made by selective groups or
the decisions of students as to
whether or not to join."
This policy conflicted with claus
es contained in the various sorori
ties' national constitutions that pro
vided for outside interference in
membership selection.
For example, one constitution
held that the national sorority presi
dent had the "power to delay or pro
hibit the pledging or initiation of any
potential member." Another main
tained that "any active [member]
could be dismissed by a unanimous
vote of the grand council, a national
body."
Beginning with Alpha Phi, soror
ities began to meet unofficially and
held rush activities in the spring of
1978, meeting in a student trailer in
Manzanita. They continued to press
for recognition by petitioning the na
tional headquarters for local auton
omy.
Finally, in the spring of 1981,
Delta Gamma became the first
sorority to be officially recognized at
Stanford in 37 years after the nation
al office granted "perpetual blanket
permission for the Stanford chapter
to pledge any Stanford woman the
members choose to sponsor and
vote to select." The other sororities

soon followed suit.
Although officially recognized
student organizations, the sororities
remained unhoused. In 1995, Kappa
Kappa Gamma applied for housing
and their request was denied. Now,
for the 1998-1999 school year, soror

ities will get another shot.
Williams applauds this recent de
cision that will allow sororities to
once again occupy Row houses.
Today, she says, the system has
changed for the better. Sororities
now have very different practices to-

Williams said she's happy to see
that the system has changed since
she was a member and is pleased
that women may once again be able
to experience life on the Row in a
sororitv.

of '42. Williams, then a member of
Alpha Phi, enjoyed belonging to the
sorority, but like many others, she
was opposed to the increasingly re
stricted number of members.
Not even half of those who
rushed could be granted admittance.
Sororities competed for the most in
fluential members of the freshman
class. "All ol the leaders of student
organizations were sorority mem
bers." said Williams, who was the
president ol Roble Hall before join
ing Alpha Phi
Because the process was so selec
tive. rejection was common. Cam
pus legend has it that one girl com
mitted suicide after being denied ad
mission to a sorority, but there is no
evidence to support this stor\ How
ever. Williams said depression and
transferring schools was not uncom
mon and had heard of some suicide
threats, but believed them to be ei
ther rumors or jokes.
In March 1943, 19 women repre
senting both sides of the issue
formed a student coalition to review
the issue. On April 26,1944. Donald
Tresidder, then University presi
dent, announced to the student
body that sororities would be dis
continued. The announcement was
met with applause and no public
outcry-
Following the decision, sorority
houses became all-women upper
class residences along the Row.
The issue was once again raised in
1974, after the passage of the Higher
Education Act, which had lasting
consequences for womens' athletics
programs. Under the act, academic
and extracurricular opportunities
for men and women must be equal.
Therefore, if men were able to join
fraternities, women should have
similar opportunities.
In December 1977. the Universi
ty Board of Trustees reversed its
stance on sororities, although they
were not officially recognized by the
University. Sororities were not per
mitted to use Stanford's name or fa
cilities in their activities. At the same
time, a "grandfather clause" was
written into University policy to en
sure that the fraternities housed at
that time would not lose their hous

ing to the new sororities.
The reason for the denial of
recognition was due to the Universi
ty's policy concerning student
groups, which stated that "the selec
tion process [for student groups]
may not in any way involve persons
from outside the University for the
purpose of influencing either the de
cisions made by selective groups or
the decisions of students as to
whether or not to join."
This policy conflicted with claus
es contained in the various sorori
ties' national constitutions that pro
vided for outside interference in
membership selection.
For example, one constitution
held that the national sorority presi
dent had the "power to delay or pro
hibit the pledging or initiation of any
potential member." Another main
tained that "any active [member]
could be dismissed by a unanimous
vote of the grand council, a national
body."
Beginning with Alpha Phi, soror
ities began to meet unofficially and
held rush activities in the spring of
1978, meeting in a student trailer in
Manzanita. They continued to press
for recognition by petitioning the na
tional headquarters for local auton
omy.
Finally, in the spring of 1981,
Delta Gamma became the first
sorority to be officially recognized at
Stanford in 37 years after the nation
al office granted "perpetual blanket
permission for the Stanford chapter
to pledge any Stanford woman the
members choose to sponsor and
vote to select." The other sororities

soon followed suit.
Although officially recognized
student organizations, the sororities
remained unhoused. In 1995, Kappa
Kappa Gamma applied for housing
and their request was denied. Now,
for the 1998-1999 school year, soror

ities will get another shot.
Williams applauds this recent de
cision that will allow sororities to
once again occupy Row houses.
Today, she says, the system has
changed for the better. Sororities
now have very different practices to-
