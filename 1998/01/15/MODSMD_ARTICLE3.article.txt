# Sororities on the Row: Part Two?
## Greek women's houseless history 
### Alison MacKinnon Contributing writer 
Stanford today seems a world
away from the Stanford of the 1940s
In those days, if you reached your
residence alter midnight during the
week or after 2 a.m. on weekends,
you would find yourself locked out
for the night. A quarter of Universi
ty housing would cost you Si 15.
The Row. the center of social life
on campus, also looked different: it
was then home to nine housed
sororities. For example, what is rum
Storey House was once the Delta
Gamma house. Muwekma-Tah
Kuk was formerly the home of Chi
Omega, and La Maison
once housed Pi Beta Phi.
The Row now might have a
chance to look as it once did. Alter
much discussion and debate in Ma\
1997. the Greek Task Force an
nounced that sororities would he el
igible to apply for housing for the
1998-99 school year.
Hut then again, back in the 19405,
sororities themselves were much dif
ferent.
Sororities played a major role in
the Stanford social scene of the earh
19405, serving not only as social
groups but career networking orga
nizations. The houses had existed on
campus along with fraternities since
I cS9I. All freshman women lived in
Roble Hall, and in the spring nearh
three-quarters of them went
through the rush process. Only a few
gained admittance to one of the nine
housed sororities. Those who were
unsuccessful were housed in Union

(what is today Old Union) or Lagu-
nita Court.
By 1944, the campus was in the
midst of great change. Many Stan
ford men left to fight in World War
II. More women were admitted, and
there was a disproportionate num
ber of women on campus. As a re
sult. the rush process became in
creasingly more competitive.
Students began advocating
changes in the system as early as
1938, when a group of Roble women
refused to pledge due to what they
deemed the system's divisive nature.
Tensions continued between the
"hall women" and those housed in
sororities.
"Much of the opposition came
from sorority members them
selves." said Sylvia Williams. Class
of '42. Williams, then a member of
Alpha Phi, enjoyed belonging to the
sorority, but like many others, she
was opposed to the increasingly re
stricted number of members.
Not even half of those who
rushed could be granted admittance.
Sororities competed for the most in
fluential members of the freshman
class. "All ol the leaders of student
organizations were sorority mem
bers." said Williams, who was the
president ol Roble Hall before join
ing Alpha Phi
Because the process was so selec
tive. rejection was common. Cam
pus legend has it that one girl com
mitted suicide after being denied ad
mission to a sorority, but there is no
evidence to support this stor\ How
