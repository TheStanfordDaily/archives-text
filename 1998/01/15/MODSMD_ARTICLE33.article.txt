## NCAA GameBreaker '98: Breakthrough or bust? 
### Joe Cavanaugh Contributing writer 
Sony Play Station has produced yet
another fast-paced, smashmouth
video football game that is touted by
Peter Dille, Sony's senior director of
product marketing, as "breaking the
mold of the traditional football game."
Fortunately, this statement is easily
made because the video game market
has few major competitors in the
realm of NCAA football games. How
ever, football enthusiasts are being
shortchanged by Gameßreaker '98. It
has many great features that bring it to
the paramount of football games, but
it is riddled with inconsistencies in
play calling, penalties and movements
of players within the game that leave
fans with a sense of frustration.
Granted, the game has some high
points that still make it an enjoyable
playing experience, especially for the
college football fanatic. The player has
the opportunity to be any of the 112
Division 1 - A teams, 40 all-time great
teams like national championship
teams such as the '90 Colorado squad
or '93 Florida State, and the ability to
choose from more than 130 realistic
looking stadiums like The Swamp of
Florida or Stanford Stadium.
Unfortunately, the players' names
corresponding to their numbers are
withheld from the game because of

regulations governing licensing and
royalties to college players. But, the
skills of such high-profile players such
as quarterback Peyton Manning of
Tennessee and linebacker Andy
Katzenmoyer of Ohio State are still
available at the fingertips of the fans.
The 3-D graphics, which have now
become the standard in the video
game industry, give the game a very
realistic feel. It is certainly a far cry
from the stick figure days of Ninten
do's Techmo Bowl. Other fun features
include various camera angles that
have also become commonplace
among current sports games. Fans can
play from the perspective of the
Goodyear Blimp, from a few feet
above the field or from inside the hel
met of favorite players, seeing the ac
tion from a first-hand perspective.
The season play and the Bowl
games are other tantalizing features of
Gameßreaker '98. All teams' 1997
schedules can be played, and with a
sufficient record, video-gamers live
the fantasy of playing in front of mil
lions in the Rose, Orange or Fiesta
Bowls with their favorite team. In ad
dition, trophies such as the Heisman
for outstanding play are presented at
the end of a season. For Stanford fans,
Chad Hutchinson can throw the last
and second touchdown pass to Troy
Walters in the waning seconds to beat
Michigan in the Rose Bowl and grab

the National Championship while
posting an undefeated season.
To further the marketing of the
game and entice younger fans,
Play Station employed Warrick Dunn
of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to sup
posedly be a consultant for the game
and to make the playbook more com
prehensive and true to college football.
But he probably did as much consult
ing on the game as I did, so this should
not be taken into account when pur
chasing this game or judging its quali
ty-
Among the accolades for NCAA
Gameßreaker, there are many flaws
that take away from the playing expe
rience and the realism of college foot
ball. For instance, the penalties are
called and decided by the computer.
So, if a holding or pass interference
call is made, players have no say in
how it is called and it is already as
sessed regardless if it helps or hinders
the opposing side.
Another feature that is frustrating
is the play calling mode. Hirst, the plays
are all the same for every team. They
are drawn as if they are from an Atari
game, and the player has no idea
which receiver will run which route or
his options on an audible call from the
line scrimmage. Also, the offense has
to wait for the defense to call its plays
and vice versa, so the opposing side's
plays are left on the screen for the

wandering eye of the opponent to look
at and base their defense or offense on.
It leaves no room for surprise calls
such as fake punts or long-passing
plays.
The players and their movements
are also so unbelievable that it takes
away from the realism of the game.
Players jump five or six yards to make
a tackle and some players can consis
tently break through six or seven tack
les. On almost every passing down,
one receiver is always wide open —

which is thoroughly impossible in a
real game. Although it is fun to have
superhuman abilities, it simply takes
away from the feel of a real game.
GameBreaker strives to be the most re
alistic game, but it falls short on these
accounts.
For the best overall football game,
John Nladden's Football '98 should be
bought outright. But despite its short
comings and glitches, GameBreaker is
the best game for college football
purists and deserves to be checked out
