## I'm a Poet and I Know It: Bob Dylan Conference and Controversy 
### Brian Jones Mark Bell 
Come gather 'round people, whereever
you roam, and admit that the waters
around you have grown. The times they are
a changing, indeed, as Bob Dylan is about
to pass from being a pop icon to a topic of
academic discussion.

As part of the first interna
tional Bob Dylan conference,
scholars from across the
country and Canada will be
coming together this Satur
day at Stanford to discuss
Dylan's place in the history of
consciousness.
The program will feature
three panels: one in the
morning and two after lunch.
Each panel will be moderated
by a member of the Stanford
faculty. The morning will
begin with an examination of
Bob Dylan's relation to acad
emia, politics and religion.
After lunch, French and Ital
ian Prof. Robert Harrison
will moderate a panel discus
sion on Bob Dylan and litera
ture, from "Rimbaud, Ker
ouac, Dylan" to "Allen Gins
berg's Role in 'Renaldo &
Car la'. "
The day will conclude
with a pane! on Dylan's
music and audience, al
though the legendary folk
singer / songwriter is not ex
pected to attend due to a per
formance in New York with
Van Morrison.
One purpose of the con
ference is to emphasize how
Dylan deserves to be includ
ed among other contempo
rary literary figures worthy of
academic study. Conference
organizer Tino Markworth
explained that, "The quality
of his work is very different
than the rest of popular cul
ture. Dylan brought poetry
to the jukebox."
In 1997, Bob Dylan was
both nominated for the
Nobel Prize in Literature and
was the recipient of the Com-

mandeur des Artes et des Lettres, France's
highest cultural award to a foreigner. Last
month he became the first rock performer
to receive the lifetime achievement award
at the Kennedy Center in Washington,
where he was cited as "the single most
compelling presence in American popular
music and foremost songwriter of our
time."
The field of Dylan studies may one day
emerge as a distinct interdisciplinary field
that blends musical, literary, cultural and
popular studies. Although Dylan has influ
enced innumerable people across the globe

for almost half a century, many older and
more conservative scholars still refuse to
admit Dylan into the modern academic
canon. Stanford English Prof. Ron Rebholz
told the San Francisco Chronicle lan. 7, "I
may be an old fogey, but 1 just don't think
the lyrics of Dylan are the stuff that war
rants serious study."
Markworth commented Rebholz's view

has some validity if Dylan's lyrics are ex
amined in isolation. However, Markworth
insists that "Dylan's artistic production is a
combination of voice performance, music
and lyrics all together. Examining his lyrics
printed on the page alone can at times be
rewarding, but it is sometimes flat. It is the
combination of the various factors of
Dylan's art which conveys the level of au
thenticity which is absent in other edgeless
and smooth productions of contemporary
popular culture."
Despite some criticism from the corners

of academia, more and more scholars are
coming to recognize Dylan's profound
contributions to politics, philosophy and
culture. In his new book "Deconstructing
Dylan," Matthew Perriefield said, "Dylan is
a rich cultural symbol that has led us to
deeper worlds of expression and knowl
edge. His life-long artistic endeavor em
bodies the modern struggle for freedom."

It is difficult to estimate the extent of
Dylan's influence on all aspects of modern
culture. He has spoken to Popes and poets
alike beginning with his first album in
1962. This year Dylan released his 41st
album, "Time Out of Mind," which poses a
challenge to the generations that have
loved him. Throughout this album, Dylan
continues his life-long apocalyptic vision,
but for the first time he seems to question
the effectiveness of the social protest that
he helped spawn a generation ago.
By demonstrating the hypocritical futil

ity of his generation's endeavors to bring
about social transformation, Dylan seems
to be calling for the end of a modern re
naissance. Despite the morbidity of his
newest album, the work has met with crit
ical acclaim and has been nominated for
three Grammy Awards.
But popularity has never been impor
tant for the rebel without a pause. His

reclusivity and constant so
cial criticism have only pe
riodically been popular,
with a dramatic lull in the
1980s. This has never de
terred Dylan from his artis
tic quest to reach increas
ingly profound levels of ex
istential understanding
and social critique. As
Dylan said "not protest for
protest's sake but always in
the struggle for people's
freedom, individual or oth
erwise. 1 hate oppression."
The idea of the conference
began in 1996 when Drama
Prof. Rush Rhem offered a
course on Bob Dylan
through the Continuing
Studies Program. The class
enjoyed overwhelming
popularity and many un
dergraduates expressed en
thusiasm for Dylan studies.
The organizers of the con
ference hope that the day
long gathering will show
the Stanford community
how the work of Dylan can
be engaged academically.
"We want a way to open it
up â€” we want to explore
how we can grasp it with
out killing it," Markworth
said. He hopes that the re
sult of the conference will
be that Dylan studies can
find its own place within
the academy, and that Stan
ford can find a way to sup
port Dylan studies either in
the form of a class, a jour
nal or future conferences.
When asked if he thought
whether it was ironic that
an iconoclastic figure like
Dylan was being co-opted
by the academia, Mark-

worth responded "I believe that he would
like the idea that his work is studied at
Stanford."
All are welcome, but seating is limited
and reservations are recommended. The
conference will be held on Saturday, lan. 17
in Kresge Auditorium from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Tickets are $14 to the public and free for
students, faculty and staff of Stanford. For
advanced tickets and directions call the

remember, "he not busy being born is busy
dying."
