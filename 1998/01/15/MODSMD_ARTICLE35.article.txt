## The 						Stanford String Quartet Launches Ludwig's Cycle: Stanford Lively Arts presents the complete Beethoven Quartets 
### Kyle Weaver 
On Friday night, the Stanford String
Quartet kicked off the opening concert of the
Beethoven Cycle, a series of six performances
arraigned by Stanford Lively Arts that will
present all 17 of Ludwig's quartets. Playing to
a full house in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the
Stanford Strings rendered Beethoven's Sec
ond, Third and Fourth Quartets with clarity,
vibrancy and just a couple of wrong notes.
Despite the few technical glitches, each
part of the performance worked beautifully.
For one thing, the Quartet's long hours of

practice paid off. Every harmonic progres
sion sounded perfectly synchronized and
natural, and the musical interpretation of
each piece felt unanimously shared through
out the group. Secondly, they were perform
ing Ludwig van Beethoven's work; anytime
you play Beethoven, you are likely to get a
beautiful performance.
Even people who have never listened to
classical music before can recognize
Beethoven when they hear him; the da-da
da-duumm of his Fifth Symphony or the
"Ode to Joy" in his Ninth Symphony are
practically contemporary icons of classical

music.
The Stanford String Quartet did a great
job of casting the energy unique to
Beethoven in Friday's performance. Each of
the 12 movements had its own complete
character — a blend of what Beethoven
wrote on paper and what the Stanford Quar
tet infused. The group was able to bring out
the symphonic underpinnings of all
Beethoven's music, while retaining the re
straint and character of a quartet throughout
each piece.
The foursome began the concert with a
lovely Allegro melody, played boldly by first
violinist Roy Malan. In the second move
ment, the other strings often played the
melody in intervals. Susan Freier, the second
violinist, did a wonderful job of bringing the
themes together. The fugal section of the last
performance piece, the Fourth Quartet, pro
vided the best forum for violist Benjamin
Simon and cellist Stephen Harrison to shine.
Especially since "Immortal Beloved"
came out, Beethoven's life and music have al
ways been the most famous of any composer
in his genre. This is because Beethoven never
composed anything boring in his life. Few
other composers can sustain an audience the
way Beethoven does.
This objective fact should become clear as
the Beethoven Cycle progresses. Before
Beethoven, quartets were a staple form of
"chamber music." They were mostly played
in a lord's dining room or private chambers
and so were often quite restrained and unob
trusive, like a rational conversation. For most
of the rock 'n' roll generation, traditional
quartets are either boring or good study
music (or both). But Beethoven isn't. He de
mands your attention. The individuality, dy
namism and emotional range of his music
gives each piece enormous potential energy.

The Stanford String Quartet performed a
second set of Beethoven quartets— the First,
Fifth and Sixth — on Sunday in Dinkelspiel,
to complete the collection of "Early Quar
tets." In two weeks, the Muir String Quartet
will continue the chronology by performing
the "Middle Quartets," on Friday, (an. 23 and
Sunday, Jan. 25. The Emerson String Quartet
will finish the series on Feb. 6 and Feb. H with
the last of Beethoven's quartets. For people
who have bought tickets to all six shows, the
series will present a fascinating comparison
of Beethoven's musical stages and how differ
ent musicians interpret his work. For anyone
wishing to experience some good classical
music — guaranteed boredom-free — anv of
the next four concerts is a wise choice.
