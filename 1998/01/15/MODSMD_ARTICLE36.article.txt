## style power: the choice is yours 
### Andrew Oyefesobi Contributing writer 
"Fashion is what you are offered; style is
what you choose." These profound words
once passed from the lips of the illustrious
Lauren Hutton. For the moment, let's assume
that this is true. Besides, we of "Generation
X," or whatever your tag of choice may be,
have been conditioned to believe that it's all
about choices. We have the choice to practice
safe sex. We have the choice to put our repre
sentatives in office. Essentially, we have the
choice to select the paths to our destinies.
Think about it. In these times when we
gripe about feeling so powerless, so insignifi
cant, so unable to affect change, we must real
ize that even in this world of chaos, we do in
deed hold a tremendous amount of power.
One aspect of our capacity to choose is the
right of each to exercise control over his or her
own style.
Don't get lost yet. This is important stuff.
We have all heard it before: about "putting
your best face forward," about "looking the
part," about having "IT," about knowing
what's in or out, hot or not, overdue or over
done. In the end, however, it is not about fads
or facades. It's all about how you pull it to
gether.
Style. It is an abstract attribute most would
like to possess. Some of us have it, and others
sort of don't. Some of us wish we had it, while
others fool themselves into thinking they have
it. Hey, some even have the audacity to think
they can dictate to others what IT is, and then
there are those who simply don't give a damn.
Those in the last category claim to feel the

freest and could care less about such frivolous
things; somehow, they feel superior to those
of us who get caught up in the whirlwind of
style's triviality.
The question is whether those who so freely
relinquish their style-power are just as quick
to shrug off the weight of their choice to use
condoms, to vote, to get involved, to do the
right thing, to choose their path. Oh well, the
freebirds can ponder that, while the remain
der of us concerned citizens sweat through
this great dilemma.
Okay, so fashion is what you are offered.
Designers, fashion houses and clothing com
panies crank out a plethora of products to put
on display in department stores, retail outlets
and shopping malls. They leave the distressing
decision up to us. We must pick and choose

from these offerings, to construct what in the
end will be our individual styles. Thus, style
becomes what you choose for yourself, and,
ultimately, you have no one to praise or blame
for your sense of style or lack thereof.
A number of outcomes can result from this
process. Laugh at the pressure and become a
victim of fashion. Crack under the pressure
and become a slave to fashion. Effectively
counteract the pressure and develop a keen
sense of style. Or, evade the pressure altogeth
er and maintain your sanity. (Okay, 2 points
for the freebirds).
Still, our society is not completely insensi
tive. There are aids and services out there to
school the utterly clueless. There are televi
sion shows about style, a television show
called "House of Style," magazine articles per
taining to style, a magazine titled "In Style,"
newspaper sections dedicated to style and
consultants who make it their job to counsel
others on their images. Simply choose your

weapon, because there are no "powers-that
be" in this game when it comes down to it. In
dividuals must exercise their right to choose
how to define their own personas.
At the end of the day, this is all we are doing
— defining our personas, defining our styles.
Some parting words of wisdom: To those of
you who care, do not confuse "being stylish"
with "having style." The former implies that
external powers validate an individual's tastes
as acceptable with a current mindset about
fashion; the latter indicates that an intrinsic
power is exercised to define one's persona. To
those of you who claim not to care, there's one
question: These days, isn't trying purposefully
not to have "style," a style in itself?

Stanford Style . . . Huh?
Style at Stanford. Apparently, this seems to
be a strange and paradoxical idea. Some
would argue that finding any semblance of
"style" at a place referred to as "The Farm" is
a nearly impossible task. At any rate, Intermis
sion's Style and Fashion Eyewitness Team
took its cameras out and went in search of the
impossible.
We scoured the grounds for personas, indi
viduals taking full advantage of the choice
from among the offerings. Major realization: a
university (universe-city) is a microcosm of a
universe, a small city, if you will. The campus,
an amalgamation of people from all across the
globe, is comprised of viewpoints about what
constitutes style transplanted from New York,
Iran, Alabama, Tokyo and so on .
We ambushed some of you to extort some
of these viewpoints (and basically to check out
what you put on your backs). The results were,
we 11... turn the page, and you decide.
