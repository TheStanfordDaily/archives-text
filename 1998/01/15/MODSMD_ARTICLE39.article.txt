## S.C.I.E.N.C.E. INCUBUS 
### 
The new album by Incubus, called
"5.C.1.E.N.C.E.," bites. This music may ac
tually be a hazard to your health. It's the
type of music that makes jumping out of a
window look appealing. You will be willing
to do anything just to make it STOP.
Incubus blows chunks for lots of rea
sons. First and foremost, the music is badly
tensioned. Imagine watching the last
episode of the season of your favorite tele
vision show, and just as it gets to a dramat
ic, cathartic point, interference sets in.
"5.C.1.E.N.C.E." does not fit into any
true music group category. If Incubus
wanted, they could probably make lots of

CDs like "S.C.I.E.N.C.E" and start a cate
gory under the heading of loud and obnox
ious. This CD is a bad mesh of rap, heavy
metal, punk, Latino, Indian and alternative
music.
Some of the sounds in this CD do have
the potential to arouse the headbanging,
jump-around, in-your-face feeling you get
from listening to Metallica. However, this
notion is abandoned just as rapidly as it is
conceived. These guys must have been tone
deaf. The short-lived interludes of appeal
are not enough to salvage this work. Just as
soon as I thought I might kinda like it, they
introduced some sound that made me real

ly hate it.
As the main vocalist for this CD, Cor
nelius is incomprehensible. You'll have to
resort to reading the cover if you want to
get an idea of what all the screaming is
about. Reading the lyrics is good for
laughs, though, because the lyrics them
selves are worse than the actual music. I
started to wonder if the composer was on
drugs. If he is, at least he has an excuse for
writing such crap.
For example, the lyrics to "Calgone" go
as follows: "On my way home, police car
pulled me over / After they left, I puttered
out of gas / 'Triple-A' came, but my card

was expired /1 suppose I'm to blame for
getting pulled over / 1 guess I'm the culprit
for running out of gas / Let's assume I'm
the guy who didn't pay his 'Triple-A' fee."
The lyrics speak for themselves. Amassed
they are irritating, negative and poor.
Unless you are a masochist, don't buy
this CD. If you see it on the shelves, run
away from it — and fast. Don't let morbid
curiosity get the better of you. There is
enough stress attached to college life. You
don't need crappy music to scintillate ten
sion.
