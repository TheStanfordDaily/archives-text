Management consulting, in

syllabled words slip awkwardly
off the tongue, becoming entan
gled with jargon such as business,
finance and industry.
Yet each year, ambitious and

fields, armed with a thorough
knowledge of the nature of their
future work and a confidence that
they'll benefit and learn from the

senior majoring in mechanical en

Most undergraduates are re
cruited to work as consultants and
investment bankers for two to
three years tight after graduation.
I hex can expect to sign to a start
ing salary of around $3().tM M) to
$40.(XM) a year.
Depending on the market and
the success of their firm, invest
ment bankers can look forward to
bonuses of as much as $ I S.iWMi to

$25.<MH). However, the hours can
run as high as 80 to 1(H) hours a
week.
Investment bankers work
mainly in New York, on Wall
Street, with a close eye on the
stock market. Simply put. the
major firms sell and trade stocks
and bonds and advise companies
on their financial investments.
Consulting firms work as ad
visers as well, but on a more di
verse range of questions De

Jon Isaacson, a second-year
business student, worked for two
years as an analyst with Morgan
Stanley. an investment bank in
New York.
"Investment banking is with
out a doubt the most lucrative
profession for those who are risk
adverse." Isaacson said. Even
above the high salary, he empha
sized the opportunits for a free
business education, the steep
learning curve, and the "chance to
solve numerous and complex
business problems."
"You are around only incredi
bly bright, intelligent people who
did very well at the very top
schools," Isaacson said. Contrary
to widely held beliefs that invest
ment banking is a cutthroat indus
try, Isaacson emphasized team
work and group support as benefits
of the job.
On a more glamorous note,
Isaacson mentioned his exposure

to top industry leaders at his young
age. "Imagine, there I was 22, in a
jet, flying to London chatting with
the CEO of one of the top Fortune
20 companies in the US about their
future financial choices," Isaacson
said with a laugh.
While investment banking can
provide plenty of excitement.
Isaacson emphasized the total
commitment and dedication it re
quires. The hours vary between 40
and 100 hours a week and consist of
anything from punching numbers
into the computer to photocopying
papers for a team report.

"The client's needs change as
the market changes," Isaacson
said. That means you can plan a
weekend event three months
ahead of time, clear it with your
team and supervisor, and still get
called back to work on Friday at 5
p.m., he said. The work is cyclical
with two or three relatively normal
months passing only to he followed
by a month of 14-hour work days.
Jell Shulman, a second-year
business student, and Scott F.llis, a
first-year business student, both
worked as consultants with McKin
sev and Co., a consulting firm for

two years in Texas. Like Isaacson,
they mentioned the industry expo
sure. education and talented col
leagues as benefits of management
consulting.
Feeling like one is contributing
to society, making money and
meeting interesting people are
some of the aspects that Shulman
misses most about his job now that
he is a full-time student.
Ellis, however, does not miss the
amount of travel he had to do a
consultant. "I never had a study in
Dallas in the two years I worked
for McKinsey," Ellis said. He

would spend the week in Houston
hotels, and though he earned plen
ty of frequent liver miles and free
hotel stays, "the glamour wears off
after a couple of months," Ellis
said. "It becomes a grind."
Lynne Dotson, Associate Di
rector of the Career Planning and
Placement Center, said that most
students interviewing for manage
ment consulting and investment
banking know what they're getting
into. " There are intense selective
procedures and students have to
look pretty committed to get the
job," Dotson said.
