# Ever more
## Vince Farsetta 
### 
Vince Farsetta has produced an album
that glows with the luminosity of a forge.
His independently released "Ever More," an
instrumental collection of six original and
12 traditional tunes, feels like a hoe-down
and a lullaby mixed together.
That's right. It's all instrumental, but it
defies that simple definition. With a mix of
banjo, guitar, mandolin, dulcimer, fiddle,
jew's harp, bass and drums, it falls into the
tradition of what Lester Flatt called "moun
tain music." It's as intricate as bluegrass but
less pretentious, as swinging as country but
without the honky-tonk, fun as jug band
music but more mature.
He's the 1987 and 1996 national old
time banjo champion — and the technical
precision of Farsetta's blistering picking is
awesome. The album starts with the title
track, a Farsetta original, in which a melody
washes into itself with colorful picking pat

terns over a slow, easy bass line. On " Buryin'
the Rye," Farsetta's lightning-fast runs con
tain a subtlety that demonstrates his com
plete understanding of his instrument.
None of the tracks on "Ever More" are
longer than three minutes in length, pre
venting some development of flow through
the album. But with 18 tracks and a coher
ent style and sound to Farsetta s playing, the
brevity of the tracks is less a hindrance to the
flow of the album than it is a disappoint
ment when an exquisite melody is cut short.
The happy, upbeat hoe-down is Farset
tas tour de force: tracks like "Mason's
Apron," "Fiddler-a-dram" and "June
Apple" echo with the yeehaws of the Ap
palachians. But he is equally adept at quiet
ing down, and the trump card of the album
is the swift and soft picking of tracks like
"The Pig's Ear."
"Kitchen Gal" and "Cluck Old Hen"

have an almost rock undercurrent to them
and no surprise. Farsetta is also the writer of
several tunes played by the Boulder, Colo,
band Leftover Salmon, including the single
"Better," off of the recent Salmon disc "Eu
phoria." Still, there is a slight feeling of ho
mogeneity in the relentless fingerpicking of
this album, but the absolute brilliance of
Farsetta's musicality makes "Ever More" an
absorbing listening experience.
This album feels like a slug of corn
whiskey drunk on the porch of a wood
cabin, with a light rain falling on the valley,
the mountains shrouded in fog and the
smell of roasting trout and baked potatoes
coming from the kitchen. "Ever More" is
not being sold locally, but you can contact
Vince Farsetta for information on his album
at P.O. Box 120421, Nashville, Tenn., 37212.
