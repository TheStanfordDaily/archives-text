# Challenge For A Civilized Society Unwound
## 
### 
On its packaging, Olympia
beer boasts "IT'S THE WATER,"
as if it is possible to explain the
source of the ale's rich flavor
waves with a single sentence. But,
considering the Olympia, Wash,
band Unwound's newest, "Chal
lenge For a Civilized Society," it is
time for Stanford's highly touted
researchers to discern exactly
what is in that water.
Unwound has already firmly
established itself as one of
Olympia's independent dream
boats, a member of a visceral
flotilla that includes Sleater-Kin
ney and whatever Calvin Johnson
is working on. In the past, Un
wound has emerged from each
successive album as a more re
fined, controlled and precise
band, and "Challenge" appears to
continue the trend.

Unwound's success stems
partly from close study of punk
gurus; one can hear echoes of
Sonic Youth, Nirvana and Fugazi
throughout its songs. Frontman
Justin Trosper's voice is at times a
pained spasm from the same
neighborhood as Cobain's cry. At
others, it resonates with the cool
snarl of Sonic Youth's Thurston
Moore. In "What Went Wrong,"
however, it sounds as if he has ei
ther been awake too long or occu
pied by barbiturates.
If given a chance, Liam Gal
lagher and his brother might
wear new colorful ski hats and
drunkenly claim the music be
hind Trosper is "art shit rock,"
because they sense Van Gogh tex
tures between a sandwich. Like
apes watching humans on televi
sion and growing jealous about

thumbs.
The top bread slice of Un
wound's dark, mysterious,
angry-sad sandwich consists of
Trosper's Sonic Youth-inspired
daydream guitar swirls, which
journey back and forth between
turbulent confusion and cascades
of epiphany. The sandwich's base,
Vern Ramsey, pumps bass emis
sions that incessantly stalk Tros
per's questing guitar like an in
evitable wave. The rhythm some
times tightens the release of sonic
aura to a power-suppressing stac
cato, reminiscent of Fugazi's
stern regulation.
Yeah, but what about, like,
punk stuff, man? Yes, there are
tunes on "Challenge" that will
rouse the laziest hound dog from
his porch. A stirring example is
"Data," which awakens slowly

with a tiny tinkling guitar and
gradually explodes into a riot an
nounced by a storm of drums.
Trosper soon arrives as the fea
tured agitational speaker, deliv
ering an urgent yet spiteful wake
up call: "generation's / informa
tion / paralyzed /by movie
lies / FALSE ALARM."
With an opening like this,
"Challenge" promises to take a
trapped generation by the big
pants and shake the living hell
out of it, exorcising all memory
of MTV's 'Twelve Angry Viewers,'
right?
Well, no. Unwound, like Nir
vana, chose to mix visceral bleats
with sedate explorations of
melancholia. Unwound doesn't
feel well enough today to lead a
battle. The roused hound thus
pads back to the porch, rests his

head on his front paws and stares
out into the rain. This album is
about half snarl and half rainy
day, and most of the slower,
gloomier numbers pitter-patter
toward the end of the CD. So,
kids, take the first half right be
fore school, and save the ending
for your profound sense of alien
ation at lunch.
The precision and control
demonstrated by Unwound on
"Challenge" indicates its contin
ued dedication to the refinement
of its sound. Whenever Unwound
finishes unwinding, the thrash of
its unraveled Slinkies will have
deeply lacerated a segment of the
collective unconscious that "real
ly believes" in Sugar(y) Ray and
Matchbox 21. Olympia flow.
