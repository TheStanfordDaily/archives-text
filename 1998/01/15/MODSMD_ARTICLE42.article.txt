# UNDER THE WESTERN FREEWAY
## grandaddy 
### 
Grandaddy is a pastiche for the
'90s. The band has it all — Super
chunk's noise-filled avant-garde
tunes, Phish's bizarre yet meaningful
lyrics, Pavement's jangly guitar rock
and the random orchestrations that
fill the b-side of the Beatles "Yellow
Submarine" soundtrack.
Add in a dash of ambient and a
hint of Radiohead-induced wailing
and Grandaddy is crashing through
your headphones. On "Under the
Western Freeway," Grandaddy
shows its sense of fun and experi
mentation but presents it via a
weighty and musically dense genre.
With song titles like "Collective
Dreamwish of Upper Class Ele
gance" and "Non Phenomenal Lin
eage," one might expect Grandaddy
to be pretentious. But in fact it is the
opposite, making fun of bands that
take themselves too seriously. The
band infuses potentially vile presen
tations of noise with some truly
beautiful musical passages.
On "Non Phenomenal Lineage,"
the opening track, Grandaddy serves
up a synthesizer-based song that re-

lies on a setting of choral voices to
create a mood of self-important
calm before breaking into a drum
heavy surreal ballad. Without warn
ing, the song morphs into "AM 180,"
which signals its beginning only
through a bunch of blippy noises
that remind me of the electronic
Christmas carols mindlessly repeat
ed over a mall sound system. The
track itself is a strong one that is
memorable and instantly recogniz
able.
"Collective Dreamwish of Upper
Class Elegance" is one of the best
tracks on the album — once it final
ly begins, after nearly a minute of in
credibly annoying introductory
noise that sounds like someone run
ning on a treadmill in the room
above you. "Summer Here Kids" is
the first rocker on the album, with a
definite Superchunk tone to its feed
back, echoing lyrics and mid-song
lapse into frenzied screaming.
Though the description sounds less
than appealing, Grandaddy some
how makes the genre work for them.
Grandaddv's three instrumental

— "Poisoned at Hartsy Thai Food,"
"Lawn and So On" and the title track
— are musically pure and provide
welcome respite from the multi-lay
ered tracks that surround them.
Repetitive yet soothing and enjoy
able, these tunes balance the album.
"Under the Western Freeway" is
a well-put together effort. It show
cases Grandaddy's unique mix of a
genre that typically takes itself very
seriously with a good laugh at
themselves and anyone who makes
music. Where there is Sonic Youth,
there is also They Might Be Giants,
and where there is Superchunk, one
can find Phish. Yet even this origi
nality cannot totally make up for
the slightly tone-deaf singing and
the overwhelming repetitiveness of
the instrumentals. Riding on a good
concept rather than a terrifically tal
ented band, Grandaddy presents a
fun expedition into innovation but
leaves the me wishing that a musi
cally tighter band had undertaken
the effort.
