## David Poe 
### 
If Beck sang in a sexy whisper and collabo
rated with an amazing folk guitarist, he'd sound
like David Poe. Poe is mellow, mellow, mellow,
and every time I listen to his self-titled album, 1
fall in love with him.
It's his voice. It's kinda like Nick Drake, but
not as depressed, like Dave Matthews, but with
out that frogginess. It's like Ben Harper without
the guttural, like, like, like ... a mellow, sexy
man.
In "Blue Glass Fall" Poe sings, "Pieces of blue

glass fall, the love of a fool is strong, to patiently
wait so long to build a bomb that don't go off
and listening to all her songs getting drunk and
leaving messages for Moromou, learning that
joy's like rain, and love is a long parade, and sor
row is like the sun when you're trying to sleep
again."
And in "Silver Eyelashes" he sings, "This is
the beginning of a song about the end of our
lives, honey, don't get me wrong when I say, l I
hope you die soon, I hope you live hard, I hope

it's dark now in your room. I hope your heart
grows cold, I hope it's heavy. I hope you feel like
you're dying, and then you do.' If 1 can't have
you, I don't want anyone else to."
He uses a lot of different guitar sounds, from
Rickie Lee Jones sparseness to bossa nova to
blue-grassy jigs to long orchestral continuo be
hind his breathy voice.
I have listened to this album over and over
and my roommates all love him, too. Mellow,
mellow, mellow, mellow. Poe is a living, breath-

ing, album-making, long satisfying sigh. Ahhh
hh.
Okay, enough of that. A cool thing about Poe
is that he brings jazz sensibilities to his pop. He
actually improvises on the album. Real impro
vising, too, not that "lemme play three different
notes again and again and slide up and down
my guitar, hopefully no one will notice!" stuff
that bad musicians like to do.
