# Honey, I'm Homely
## Dance Hall Crashers 
### 
The ska scene disses them for not having
horns, the punk scene scoffs at their poppy
female vocals and the mainstream alterna
teen scene is too busy ogling Gwen Stefani to
give them a second glance.
So despite an eight-year history of solid
releases, Dance Hall Crashers (DHC) has not
found a strong niche. Hopefully its fourth re
lease, "Honey, I'm Homely," will change that.
Combining the strong ska elements of its
oldest tunes with the harmonies of the best
'50s girl groups, DHC has turned out an
album that is fun to listen to. Lead singers
Elyse Rogers and Karina Denike add their
usual perfect vocal harmonies to a strong,
boppy undercurrent of guitar, bass and
drums to yield an album with more energy
than their earlier releases.
On the opening track, "Lost Again," DHC
uses its classic formula of low-key bass and
drums as background for the vocals, a style
relatively rare in today's instrument-and-ef
fects music industry. And despite the unim
pressive solos of guitarist Jason Hammon,

DHC succeeds in drawing the listener into its
happening album with this first track.
However, on tracks such as "Salted," "Elvis
and Me" and "Whiskey & Gin," DHC reveals
that the new album is not merely a reaffirma
tion of its early ska sound. Supporting
Rogers' claim that the band is ska-pop-punk,
it turns out harder, drum-centered songs that
push past the edge of experimentation the
group showed on its previous album "Lock
jaw."
Luckily DHC also dishes out plenty of
slower, more melodic songs as well. On
"Cold Shower," DHC is joined by the horn
section of the traditional ska band Hepcat,
and despite the overwhelming relegation of
the brass to the background, the sound is
synthesized beautifully. "Last Laugh," one of
the best tracks on the album, stands out from
DHC's other offerings with its focus on lyrics
as well as vocals. Its sing-along quality makes
the listener actually pay attention to what the
band is saying, instead of just absently tap
ping a foot to the beat.

"Stand By" shows that DHC's musical
evolution did not end with "Lockjaw."
Though it is not one of the best tracks on the
album, it is interesting for its sultry solo vo
cals (a rarity for DHC) and swing-style vers
es. Any band that can successfully deliver ska,
punk, pop, swing and Jessica Rabbit on the
same album earns my respect.
Unfortunately, DHC's instantly recogniz
able sound requires showcasing the vocals at
the expense of the instruments. In addition,
the lyrics are often forgettable and the solos
drab. And although DHC is great at synthe
sizing a variety of discordant styles into one
song, the overall presentation of "Honey, I'm
Homely" lacks continuity, jumping from
loud punkish songs to tuneful melodies with
an annoying lack of flow.
But DHC's worst would still be far better
than most other bands' best. They consis
tently deliver fun, musically articulate songs
that are listener-friendly and dance-inspir
ing. "Honey, I'm Homely" proves that DHC
is still a force to be reckoned with; I hope that

the band finally receives the acclaim it de
serves.
