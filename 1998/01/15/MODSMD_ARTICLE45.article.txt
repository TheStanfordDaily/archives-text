# KUNDUN
## 
### 
The obscurely titled "Kundun"
takes its name from the Tibetan form
of acknowledgment for the Dalai
Lama. Many of the Buddhist facets of
the film, like nonviolence and rein
carnation, came across as informative
and interesting. But what's particular
ly lacking in Martin Scorsese's latest
effort are two things necessary to any
film, particularly dramas: compelling
intrigue and moving complications.
It comes as no surprise that the
Dalai Lama himself checked every
draft of Melissa Mathison's script. He
— and Tibetan Buddhism — is pre
sented in a very favorable light, while
the Chinese leaders come across as
unenlightened and hypocritical.
"Kundun" meticulously follows the
life of the Dalai Lama from the auspi
cious 2-year-old boy until his exile at
17. There were four different actors
playing the Dalai Lama at various
stages of his life, and each provided
enough transition to make us think
that the film actually did traverse 15
years. In anv case, it certainly felt like it

took 15 years to watch this slow-mov
ing, coming-of-age piece.
"Kundun" labors with the various
problems that the Dalai Lama en
counters while an immature youth.
Conflicts with a power-hungry advis
er and the overstocked prisons, which
receive the briefest of coverage, elicits
little or no interest from the audience.
Once the boy finds out that his father
has passed away, the moment is sup
posed to be poignant and heartfelt.
Instead, the documentary-like treat
ment of a family members death
makes the event come across as cold,
distant and random.
What I admired most about "Kun
dun" was its breathtaking cinematog
raphy and haunting musical selec
tions. Director Scorsese was forced to
shoot most of the film in Morocco,
the same site as "Lawrence of Arabia."
The unending sight of sand is occa
sionally interrupted by lavish palaces
and stark, snow-capped mountains,
and it is a particular treat for Western
ers who probably are unaccustomed

to such exotic locales.
Composer Philip
Glass has similarly done
his job to the highest ex
tent, as the low rever
berating bass chords
and the tinny drums
complimented what
was seen on the screen.
The music in this film
was by far the most
original of the year, and
this should give "Kun
dun" high hopes of at
least one Oscar nomi
nation.
It seems bizarre to
me, at least, that Walt
Disney Pictures would
invest money in "Kun
dun." I'd think that
Disney would have
foreseen such unfavor-

able publicity. Coming on the heels of
the Brad Pitt saga "Seven Years in
Tibet," Scorseses film may simply be
an attempt to jump on the latest Hol

lywood bandwagon — let's save those
poor Tibetans!
While I welcomed this effort to
bring light to a far-away, repressed re
gion, "Kundun" certainly could have

packed more punch and vigor to keep
the audience fully enthralled with the
life of the 14th Dalai Lama.
