# Deconstructing Harry
## 
### 
Why, you ask, is a pale, bald
ing, bespectacled guy in such a
funk when he, and his fictional
sidekick, indulge repeatedly in
heated lovemaking with a cast of
beautiful woman that includes
Elisabeth Shue, Demi Moore and
Julia Louis-Dreyfus?
Well, because he's Woody
Allen, or should I say a Woody
Allen creation as Allen insists
that "Deconstructing Harry" is
not autobiographical.
For the seasoned Woody Allen
fan, the central character of the
film will be familiar: a stammer
ing urban intellectual, steeped in
angst and testosterone, played by
Allen himself. What might come
as a surprise is that this charac
ter, named Harry Block, is not
the lovable neurotic of previous
Allen films, but a thoroughly de
spicable person, devoid of sensi
tivity and any redeeming morals.
It is just this incorrigible base
ness that, at times, explodes into
wickedly funny comedy.
"You have no values! It's ni
hilism! It's cynicism! It's sar
casm! It's orgasm!" rants Harry's
sister. With aloof irony, Harry
replies: "You know in France, I
could use that as a slogan and
win."
With many such witty, incisive
comments and with Allen's char
acteristic stuttering agitation,

Harry stumbles through
the film as celebrated
writer and maligned lover.
At first, the distinction be
tween Harry's fictional
worlds and his own real
life is maintained. But,
just as the audience starts
to get all the characters
(both fictional and real)
straight, the two worlds
begin to intermingle.
As the film progresses,
the degree of surrealism
builds. Not only does
Harry have numerous
run-ins with his fictional
characters, but he also
takes a tour of hell, a lurid
cavern teeming with glis
tening, naked woman that
can be accessed by eleva
tor.
One of the funniest and
most ingenious of these
surreal interludes involves
an actor (Robin Williams)
who suddenly, inexplica
bly finds himself out of
focus on a movie set.
Eventually, after fiddling
with the cameras to no

avail, the director sends
his blurry actor home to rest and
"to get sharp again."
Underlying the wit and inge
nuity of "Deconstructing Harry,"
however, is a deep pathos that,

when fully absorbed, casts a
shadow of melancholy across the
film's comedy. As an individual
ruled by his creative imagina
tion, Harry is consistently indif
ferent, often detrimental, to the

happiness of those close to him
and, ultimately, to his own well
being.
"You take everyone's suffering
and turn it into gold — literary
gold!" cries one of the many en

raged women in "Deconstruct
ing Harry." Despite his insistence
otherwise, perhaps the same can
be said of Allen himself.
