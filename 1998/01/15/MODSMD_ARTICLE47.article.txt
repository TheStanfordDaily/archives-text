## Good Will Hunting 
### 
The simple premise behind the
movie "Good Will Hunting" is the key
to its success: give the protagonist a
superhuman combination of genius,
street smarts, charisma and boyish
good looks, and then throw in some
serious character flaws. All of a sud
den he's complex and believable, and
his story is bound to be a good one.
Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a
brilliant 20-year-old from South
Boston. He's read enough history and
social theory to make the boys at Har
vard cry, and he solves math problems
that Nobel-caliber professors can only
puzzle over.
But Will isn't one of MlT's stu
dents; he's one of their janitors. Acad
emia doesn't appeal to him, so he's
kept his gift a secret in favor of a blue
collar lifestyle. He spends a lot of his
time getting in and out of trouble with
his Irish-American, rough-and-tum
ble buddies.
Will is an orphan with bad memo
ries and a fear of the world outside his

comfortable Boston. That world be
gins to confront him when he is dis
covered by Professor Lambeau (Stel
lan SkarsgSrd), a prize-winning
mathematician at MIT.
Lambeau wants to break Will's
rough shell and get him to realize his
potential, so he turns to an old college
roommate, psychologist Sean
McGuire (Robin Williams). Sean, a
community college professor with his
own troubled past, seems an unlikely
therapist. However, he is also from
South Boston, and he just might see
what makes Will tick.
The final twist to the story is a
British pre-med at Harvard named
Skylar (Minnie Driver). She and Will
build a relationship, but she repre
sents the opposite of Will's friends;
and he may not be able to commit. If
Will doesn't figure himself out soon,
he may destroy more lives than his
own.
The screenplay was well written by
longtime friends Damon and Ben Af-

fleck ("Chasing
Am/'), who plays
Will's best friend
Chuckie. That's
complimented by
the expert direc
tion of Gus Van
Sant, Jr., whose
previous films in
clude "To Die
For"and "My
Own Private
Idaho." Pile on
some worthy per
formances by
Damon and
Williams, and
we've got Oscar
nominations.
"Good Will
Hunting" might
have special ap
peal for Stanford
students, who

should instantly recognize the high
profile college environment. (Coinci

dentally, Driver's character is headed
for Stanford Medical School.) While
we may not share Will's amazing

mind, we can sympathize with his fear
of the road ahead.
