# AMISTAD
## 
### 
It is hard to say what ex
actly is wrong with Steven
Spielberg's latest historical
epic, "Amistad," but there is
something unsatisfying
about it. It's a movie that
wants very badly to be
deeply moving and emo
tional throughout, but one
that only sporadically suc
ceeds.
The problem is this: the
story, which depicts the ex
perience of a group of
Africans on trial for re
belling against unlawful and
inhumane captors, focuses
more on the lawyers who de
fend them than the Africans
themselves. This creates a
distance between the audi
ence and the people who are
at the heart of the story, a
distance that hurts the film.
"Amistad" is the story of a
group of Africans from Sier
ra Leone who are illegally
captured and placed on a
slave ship, La Amistad. Led
by the charismatic and
courageous Cinque (Dji
mon Hounsou), 40 captives
revolt, killing their captors
and taking over the ship.
Tricked into sailing to
America rather than return
ing to Africa, they are put on
trial for murder in a country
where no one speaks their

language. However, their
cause is taken up by plucky
real estate lawyer Roger
Baldwin, played by Matthew
McConaughey. The film fol
lows the trial from its incep
tion to the Supreme Court,
where it is argued by John
Quincy Adams, played by
Anthony Hopkins, in fine
form.
Spielberg wishes to bring
an event that has been left
out of the history books to a
place of rightful attention, a
noble goal that is the film's
greatest accomplishment.
However, "Amistad" does
not get very much beyond
educational. Laboriously
slow, with three trials and a
great deal of legal discus
sion, Spielberg neglects the
emotional heart of the story
in Cinque and his compan
ions. Too much time is spent
on Baldwin's emotional
crises, a situation worsened
by McConaughey's unin
spired acting and unfortu
nate glued-on sideburns.
As Cinque, Hounsou is
wonderful, lighting up every
scene that he's in. Hounsou
is at once frightened and
brave — reluctant to lead
but a tower of strength in a
desperate situation. It is
through Cinque that Spiel

berg is able to unsentimen
tally, yet effectively convey
the horrors of the Atlantic
crossing and the frustration
of the language barrier. The
latter is emphasized by hav
ing the Africans speak in
their native dialect without
subtitles, forcing the audi
ence to experience this frus
tration in a microcosmic
way — a technique that
works. Cinque is the charac
ter that saves the film, and
Hounsou is the actor re
sponsible for its emotional
impact.
One can only wish that
Cinque and his compan
ions' experiences were cine
matically underlined more
often. Instead, the deep and
beautiful bonds that Cinque
has formed with Baldwin
and Adams are offered to
pull at the heart strings.
"Amistad" is saved by its
moments of unsentimental
ity, such as the revolt —
beautifully shot and fright
ening in its brutality. The
film's final image is of
Cinque, as it should be, and
it serves as a reminder of
both the film's greatest per
formance and its commend
able purpose.
