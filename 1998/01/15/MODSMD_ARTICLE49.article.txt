# SCREAM 2
## 
### 
It's common knowledge
that sequels are basically at
tempts to cash in on the success
of the original—and are never
as good as the original.
"Scream 2" takes its own
awareness of that common
knowledge and makes it work
in its favor, in much the same
way as the original "Scream"
took every horror cliche in the
book and created a unique,
unpredictable satire and hor
ror movie in one.
And while it may not be
better than the original,
"Scream 2" at least meets the
standards set by "Scream,"
and, in a few instances, even
surpasses them. The opening
scene is one example: It's two
years after the original Woods
boro murders, and reporter
without-a-conscience Gail
Weathers (Courtney Cox) has
cashed in on her horrific expe
riences by writing a book on
which a new movie called
"Stab" has been based. lada
Pinkett plays a student at idyl
lic Windsor College, who is
dragged to the movie by her
boyfriend (Omar Epps). She
copes by lecturing him on the
ridiculously expendable role
African-Americans play in
horror movies — their only
purpose is to get killed, she
says. Pinkett's character, need
less to say, does not remain

with us for long.
The movie uses the same
format as the original, whereby
its characters are clued in to the
"plot" of this horror movie sce
nario they call reality. It's their
knowledge of horror movie
cliches that makes the movie so
enjoyable — when faced with
danger, they're saying the same
things you're thinking, (e.g.
Why the hell would you run up
the stairs instead of out the
door?)
In its degree of self-aware
irony, "Scream 2" is even more
on top of things than its prede
cessor, to the

extent that it's
almost eerie.
When Cox ap
pears on the
screen with a
new skunk
striped do, the
first thing you
think is: "Nice
streaks." Mo
ments later,
Neve Campbell
tells her the
same thing.
But "Scream
2," for all its
self-awareness
and inside-ioke
humor, is
nowhere near
as scary as the
original. The

ending may be a surprise, but
that's only because it is totally
random. And if you haven't
seen the original, not only will
much of the plot and many of
the )okes be wasted, but you'll
be left wondering what all the
fuss over the movies "intelli
gence" and "hipness" was
about.
If you want to watch a
smart, funny and ever-so
slightly scary movie, then
"Scream 2" is the one for you.
And you should've seen the
original by now, anyway.
