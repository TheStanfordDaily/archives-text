No one can deny that man
agement consulting and invest
ment banking are well repre
sented at Stanford career fairs.
And although they can help you
pay back all those school loans,
what exactly are they?
Mariam Naficy, a second
year student in the Graduate
School of Business, deciphers
the mysteries of landing a job in
the financial world in her book
"The Fast Track: The Insider's
Job to Winning Jobs in Manage
ment Consulting. Investment
Banking, and Securities Trad
ing."

After earning degrees in po
litical science and economics
from Williams College, Naficy,
now 27. went straight into in
vestment banking with Gold
man. Sachs & Co. After two
years as an investment banker,
Naficy went to work for Gemini
Consulting.
"I find business very chal
lenging but also a creative op
portunity because there are
some rules hut they can be bro
ken." Naficy said. "Your suc
cess depends on your energy
and your initiative."
By living these experiences
