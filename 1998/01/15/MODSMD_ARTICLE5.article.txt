## 
### Jeanette Perez 
No one can deny that man
agement consulting and invest
ment banking are well repre
sented at Stanford career fairs.
And although they can help you
pay back all those school loans,
what exactly are they?
Mariam Naficy, a second
year student in the Graduate
School of Business, deciphers
the mysteries of landing a job in
the financial world in her book
"The Fast Track: The Insider's
Job to Winning Jobs in Manage
ment Consulting. Investment
Banking, and Securities Trad
ing."

After earning degrees in po
litical science and economics
from Williams College, Naficy,
now 27. went straight into in
vestment banking with Gold
man. Sachs & Co. After two
years as an investment banker,
Naficy went to work for Gemini
Consulting.
"I find business very chal
lenging but also a creative op
portunity because there are
some rules hut they can be bro
ken." Naficy said. "Your suc
cess depends on your energy
and your initiative."

right after college, Naficy had sur
vived grueling interviews and appli
cations. Realizing how much she had
learned through her job search expe
rience, she decided to help others
that were about to start the experi
ence by writing a book.
"I decided to write the book
while I was jogging in [San Francis
co] one day," Naficy said. "I started
thinking about my analyst experi
ences in consulting and investment
banking and realized that it might be
useful to write about them for other
people who would be going through
the same thing."
In her book, Naficy provides
tips, including resume-writing to
what to wear on an interview and
how to answer case questions.
Some of Naficy's expertise on the
subject also comes from her recruit
ing experience at Goldman, Sachs

& Co.
So far the book has been a success
at the Stanford Bookstore as well as
over the Internet, listed as number
by on Amazon Books Hot 1(K) list.
Naficy attributes much of the book's
success to on-line marketing.
" The generation the book is writ
ten for is more technically savvy and
regularly uses the Internet," Naficy
said. "I believe that this book
wouldn't have been as successful
five years ago when online book re
tailers weren't around."
Being so young, the experience of
not knowing where to start or where
to go and having disaster interviews
is fresh in Naficy's mind. She laughs
now at some of the mistakes that she
made while going through the
process.
"After I had finished some of my
interviews. I was sending thank-you
notes out to the companies. I acci
dentally sent a thank-you note for a
consulting firm to an investment
banker at Goldman, Sachs, & Co.

"On my first day on the job at
Goldman, he came over to my desk
and said he had a present for me and
then handed me the note. We ended
up having a good laugh over it but it
also showed that thank-you notes
could sometimes hurt more than
help," Naficy said.
"The hardest thing to overcome
was avoiding the pressure of going to
business school immediately," she
said. "1 wanted a clearer idea of my
self."
Naficy also describes many ad
vantages of her job experience that
go beyond the purely work-related.
"Goldman sent me to Spain
where 1 stayed in one of the most
beautiful hotels I have ever seen,"
she said.
"I was also able to watch a
Philadelphia Flyers game with the
owner of the Flyers explaining the
rules of hockey to me. Those two ex
periences were among the most
memorable and fun 1 had in invest
ment banking," Naficy added.
