## Cross-Dressing Flix 
### 
There's nothing Hollywood likes bet
ter than a nice, juicy trend, and the last
five years would seem to have been the
popularization of that grandest of dames,
the drag queen (with the requisite Gloria
Gaynor re-mix of course). And what
could be better? Dahling, the answer is
nothing. With RuPaul hosting her own
talk show, the Lady Chablis playing her
self in "Midnight in the Garden of Good
and Evil," and now even a sitcom ("Ask
Harriet"), drag queens are certainly plat
forming their way across America. Cine
matic cross-dressing, however, is far from
just a current craze — it actually has a
long history ranging from desperate ac
tors to that sweet transvestite from Tran
sylvania.
Who would have thought that Tony
"Yonda lies the castle of my fadda" Curtis
would end up in lipstick and garters? Billy
Wilder's 1959 classic pairs Curtis with
Jack Lemmon as musicians who disguise
themselves as members of an all-girl
band. The film illustrates the cross-dress
ing-with-an-ulterior-motive theme that
runs rampant through films, and for pure
laughs, this ranks as the best.
Robin Williams (a.lca. the Hairiest
Man in Showbusiness) donned English
matron garb and a falsetto voice to win
his children back in 1993 s slapstick "Mrs.
Doubtfire," a film that is worth seeing for
William's Streisand portrayal and wild
antics.
In a premise that ranks among the
least believable in cinema, "Tootsie"
(1982) features Dustin Hoffman as an
out-of-work actor who decides that his
chances of landing a role are better as a
middle-aged woman. It's a wonder that
there weren't riots in the streets of Los An -
geles when that concept debuted. Never
theless, Hoffman gives a great perfor
mance as Dorothy, and "Tootsie," espe
cially its soap opera scenes, is very funny.
A little seen film that serves as a time
capsule for the '80s is "Just One of the
Guys," which stars Joyse Hyser as high
school student Terry, who hatches a plan
to gain respect for her work as a journal
ist by dressing as a man. Featuring all the
fashions of the decade from turned up
collars to acid wash, "Guys" is an '80s
high-school angst movie bar none; but it
does not even remotely qualify as quality
filmmaking.
The above movies, for all their merits,
exemplify a gimmicky sort of plot in

which cross-dressing serves
as a punchline. However,
there are also more dramat
ic offerings that look more
thoughtfully at sexuality
and gender. Neil Jordan's
"The Crying Game" is part
thriller, part gender-bender,
part love story and gave us
the subtle, aching perfor
mance of Jaye Davidson as
Dil. A small film that ex
plores the relationship be
tween an ex-IRA terrorist on
the run and the transsexual
who he falls in love with — I

trust the secret no longer
needs keeping—while maintaining hon
esty and affection between the characters,
this was the sleeper of 1992.
Sally Potter's brilliant "Orlando"
(1993) adapts Virginia Woolfs gender
bending tale of a 17th century nobleman
who does not age. Dissatisfied with the
restrictions of his gender, Orlando wakes
up one morning a woman. The film looks
at the confining roles of both genders
across four centuries, noting interesting
ly that 17th century fashion had the male
Orlando dressed in stereotypically femi
nine clothing, while 20th century fashion
has the female Orlando dressed in stereo
typically masculine clothing. Visually
stunning, "Orlando" stars Tilda Swinton
who, though about as convincing as a
man as Robin Williams is as a woman,
gives a breathtaking performance.
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" by
all rights does not belong in a video col
umn as it absolutely must be seen in the
theater to be enjoyed. Tim Curry is Dr.
Frankenfurter, who calls himself "that
sweet transvestite from Transsexual,
Transylvania" is at the heart of a musical
that is pure camp.
The two most recent cross-dressing
movies are both, coincidentally, drag
queen road movies. "To Wong Foo —
Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar"
stars Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes as
drag queens from New York who breathe
life into a depressed, dull Midwestern
farm town by distributing fashion advice
and being good people (who are the plot
wizards who came up with this one?). It
dismisses any sexuality issues in its quest
for a mainstream audience, and is a Hol
lywood-ized take on life as a drag queen
that is utterly ludicrous in its portrayal,
though it does boast several hysterical
one-liners.
Far more worthwhile is an Australian
production, "The Adventures of Priscilla,
Queen of the Desert," which takes a bru
tally funny look at three drag queens trav
eling through the Outback It tackles the
somatization felt by the characters and
simultaneously manages to have a rau
cous Abba-worshipping time. Lizzie
Gardner's spectacular Oscar-winning
costumes are humorous in themselves,
being constructed entirely of flip-flops
and other household items. The hot-pink
beehive is back or perhaps, has arrived.
