A group of residents from Saint Hyacinthe, 60 kilometers east of Montreal, stand in freezing weather
to collect an emergency payment from the government of Quebec yesterday. Residents who have been
without power for more that seven days are entitled to $70 (CDN). The city of Saint Hyacinthe and its
70,000 residents are still without power after last week's ice storm.
