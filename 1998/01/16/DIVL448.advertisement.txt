ATTENTION JUNIORS!
WOULD YOU LIKE $15,000 FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF GRADUATE SCHOOL PLUS
$2,000 TO ASSIST YOU DURING THE APPLICATION PROCESS NEXT YEAR?!
IF THE ANSWER IS YES, READ BELOW:
The Beinecke Memorial Scholarship Program offers scholarships to juniors who have demonstrated
unusual ability in fields of study they are eager to pursue at the graduate level. The award consists of an
initial grant of $2,000 to be used at the student's discretion in support of the graduate school application
process; followed by a $ 15,000 stipend during each of the first two years of graduate study.
Nominees should exemplify superior standards of intellectual ability, scholastic achievement and personal
promise. In addition, preference will be given to those candidates:
1) for whom the awarding of a Beinecke Scholarship would significantly enhance the likelihood of the
student attending graduate school;
2) who are planning to attend graduate school in the arts, humanities, behavioral or natural sciences;
3) with demonstrated financial need (i.e., a history of receiving financial aid).
Application materials are available from Jodi Berardino
in the Humanities and Sciences Dean's Office, Building One, Room 208.
Ms. Berardino may be reached for questions at 723-0402 or jodib@leland.
Application materials are due by noon on February 20, 1998.
