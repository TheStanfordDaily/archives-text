# Mars microbe thesis queried
## Scientists critical of Zare findings 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
Two teams of scientists claim to
have uncovered evidence that they
say undermines the hypothesis, pro
posed in 1996 by Stanford re
searchers, that a Martian meteorite
contains signs there was once life on
Mars.
Their findings are published in
today's issue of the journal "Sci
ence."
The teams, one from the Univer
sity of Arizona at Tucson and one
from UC-San Diego's Scripps Insti
tute of Oceanography, base their
analyses, respectively, on traces of
carbon isotopes in organic material
and on the presence of amino acids

that appear to have their origin on
this planet.
According to a statement from
Jeff Bada, a professor of marine
chemistry who led the UC-San
Diego team, the new evidence
"shows that the meteorites aren't
going to give us a defininte answer."
The original research on the me
teorite was done by a team from
Stanford and another from NASA's
Johnson Space Center in Houston.
They came to the conclusion that a
metorite from Mars, called
ALHB4OOI, contained organic
compounds that might have been
caused by microbial life 3.6 billion
years ago.
That research theorized a con
nection between the organic com
pounds. called polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons or PAHs, and glob
ules of Martian-origin carbonate
that were found near them.
I'he new research disputes that
connection, using analysis of the car
bon-14 isotope.
"The organic material contains
[carbon-14] and the carbonate
doesn't because the carbonate came
from somewhere in space, presum
ably Mars, and the organic material
is a recent addition that took place
while the meteorite was still sitting
on the ice." said Timothy Jull. who
led the Arizona team, in a statement,
"so there is no connection between
the two things."
According to a statement from
Stanford Chemistry Prof. Richard
Zare. who led the original Stanford
team, this aspect of the research
"does indicate a degree of terrestrial
contamination that is much greater
than I suspected was present.... In
that sense, the study does cast new
doubt on our hypothesis that the me
teorite contains evidence of past
Martian life."
He claimed, however, that the
new study only proved the origin of
the majority of the organic material,
not all of it.and that he could not tell
from the research paper whether the
PAHs he had studied were in the ter
restrial portion.

"Therefore." Zare said, "I do not
believe that this research refutes the
basic contention of our original
paper."
The second study dealt with
amino acids. Bada and his team con
cluded that the bulk of the amino
acids in the meteorite were of types
common in the Antarctic ice where
the meteorite w as found.
Zare noted that his work had con
centrated on PAHs rather than
amino acids, and that, because
amino acids are water soluble, they
could have reached the interior of
the rock through water saturation.
Zare said he does not find it sur
prising that the amino acids are of
terrestrial origin but noted that, be
cause PAHs are insoluble, any con
clusion about soluble amino acids
could not be extended to them.
"Therefore, said Zare, I conclude
that [the amino acid research] does
not shed any important new light on
the origin of PAHs in ALHN4(X)1."
Bada disagrees.
"What we and Tim .lull's team
have shown is that there is no evi
dence in our hands that the mete
orite contains any compounds that
we could definitely trace to Mars ex
cept maybe some tiny mysterious
component that we don't under
stand at this point," he said.
He and Jull concluded that the
question of life on Mars will not be
solved by the Martian meteorites
that have fallen to Earth but will
have to wait lor evidence direct from
Mars, possibly after a mission to
Mars scheduled for 2(X)5.
