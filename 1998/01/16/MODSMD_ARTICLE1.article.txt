# Mars microbe thesis queried
## Scientists critical of Zare findings 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
Two teams of scientists claim to
have uncovered evidence that they
say undermines the hypothesis, pro
posed in 1996 by Stanford re
searchers, that a Martian meteorite
contains signs there was once life on
Mars.
Their findings are published in
today's issue of the journal "Sci
ence."
The teams, one from the Univer
sity of Arizona at Tucson and one
from UC-San Diego's Scripps Insti
tute of Oceanography, base their
analyses, respectively, on traces of
carbon isotopes in organic material
and on the presence of amino acids

that appear to have their origin on
this planet.
According to a statement from
Jeff Bada, a professor of marine
chemistry who led the UC-San
Diego team, the new evidence
"shows that the meteorites aren't
going to give us a defininte answer."
The original research on the me
teorite was done by a team from
Stanford and another from NASA's
Johnson Space Center in Houston.
They came to the conclusion that a
metorite from Mars, called
ALHB4OOI, contained organic
compounds that might have been
caused by microbial life 3.6 billion
years ago.
