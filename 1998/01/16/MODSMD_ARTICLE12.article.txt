## Labor secretary to face scrutiny 
### 
WASHINGTON (AH) —Labor
Secretary Alexis I lerman denied
allegations yesterday that she had
sold her influence in the White
House and said she "will not he dis
tracted" by a Justice Department
inquiry.
President Clinton, too, defended
Herman when asked about the
accusation shortly before the two
were to appear in New York. "I
don't believe that for a minute," lie
said.
"I want you to know that these
allegations aren't true," Herman
told reporters earlier during a brief
appearance on the Labor Depart
ment steps. "My attorney ... has
contacted the Justice Department
and has told them that I will coop
erate fully."
Herman is the second member
of Clinton's current Cabinet under
scrutiny by the Justice Depart
ment's public integrity section and
FBI agents assigned to a campaign
finance task force. There is also an
inquiry involving Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt.
In addition, former Agriculture
Secretary Mike Espy and former
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros
are awaiting trials on charges
brought by independent counsels.
The allegations against Herman
stem from her tenure as director of
the White House Office of Public
Liaison during Clinton's first four
years in office.
During confirmation hearings
for the Labor post, it was reported
that she had met frequently at the
White House with former business
associate Vanessa Weaver and with
clients Weaver was working with
through her own consulting firm.
No evidence of wrongdoing sur

faced.
Weaver bought Herman's con
sultancy for between $50,000 and
$ I ()(),()()() after Herman took (lie
White House job in 1993.
Now a former partner of
Weaver's, Laurent Yene, contends
that Herman agreed to use her
influence at the White House to
help Weaver and Yene. In
exchange, he told ABC News. 1 ler
man was to get 10 percent of their
fees. He alleged he once delivered
cash to her.
One deal is alleged to have
involved Herman's intervention on
behalf of a small Washington
telecommunications company,
Mobile Communications Holdings
Inc., that wanted a license from the
Federal Communications Commis
sion.
MCHI was denied a license for
seven years but was finally granted
one last summer after members of
Congress, the chief counsel of the
Small Business Administration and
an aide to Vice President A 1 Gore
wrote letters to the FCC. The lob
bying campaign included an aide to
President Clinton, who forwarded a
letter of endorsement from a com
munications executive, according to
documents on file at the FCC.
The license was approved only
after FCC regulators waived rules
requiring certain financial backing
to undertake the massive project,
according to the documents.
The company's rivals accused
MCHI of violating FCC rules by
enlisting lawmakers and Clinton
administration officials to write the
letters. The FCC's general counsel
ruled there was insufficient evi
dence to cite MCHI for violating
the commission's rules.
