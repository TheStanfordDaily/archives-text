# Sen. Glenn to re-orbit earth
## 
### 
WASHING lON (AP) â€” Thir
ty-six years after he made history
as the first American to orbit the
Earth. Sen. John Glenn is being
granted an aged astronaut's fond
est wish: one more blastoff and
fiery ride to where "the view is
tremendous."
In October he'll become the
oldest man in space.
NASA officials have decided to
grant the 76-year-old Ohio senator
and former Marine pilot's long
standing request, convinced by his
arguments that he's the right test
subject for research into the aging
process. NASA called a news con
ference for today to make it official.
His flight aboard the shuttle
Discovery in October will come
more than 36 years after his three
orbit ride aboard the cramped
Friendship 7 capsule on Feb. 20,
I 962.
The flight allowed the United
States to instantly catch up to the
Soviets in the space race and
turned Glenn into a worldwide
symbol of American know-how
and courage.
"It was extremely dangerous at
that time," Chris Kraft, flight direc
tor for the early flights, recalled
Thursday. And the world's reac
tion was amazing.
"People were standing on the
streets in Tokyo, all over the world,
awaiting his safe return and listen
ing to the operation as it took
place," Kraft said.
Glenn himself talked about how
"the view is tremendous" and
exulted about the "beautiful blue"
horizon during his ride. As his cap
sule sped back down into the
Earth's atmosphere in a cascade of
sparks and fire, he remarked. "Boy.
that was a real fireball of a ride."
Friendship 7 was aloft for four

hours. 56 minutes, which at the time
seemed an extraordinarily long
ride. In recent years, though. (ilenn
has joked about having such a short
time in space and has pressed con
tinually for another shot.
"I'm ready when they say go."'
he said.
A hero of the book and movie
"The Right Stuff," Glenn was
elected to the Senate in 1974 after a
successful business career, but is
retiring from Congress at the end
of 1998.
As news of the NASA decision
leaked out. Glenn wasn't confirm
ing anything. But he smiled as he
said. "I look forward to discussing
this in the future."
Glenn, who will turn 77 in July,
has said he has no qualms about
putting his body through stresses
that might accelerate the aging pro
cess. He has stayed fit.
He will fly on a 10-dav research
mission aboard Discovery, tenta
tively scheduled to lift off Oct. 8.
Scott Carpenter. 72. who did the
famous "God speed. John Glenn"
countdown in 1962. said he was
thrilled for the man who preceded
him in orbit by a mere three
months.
"I think it's great. I envy the
spot." said Carpenter, like Glenn
one of the select Mercury 7 astro
nauts and the second American to
orbit Earth.
Apollo 1 l's Buzz Aldrin. who
turns 68 next week and was the sec
ond man to walk on the moon, also
said it's a great idea for NASA to
send Glenn back into space. "John
is a wonderful candidate because
he has a high visibility, he's in great
shape and he was the first Ameri
can in orbit." said Aldrin.
Glenn exercises dailv. lifts
weights, pilots his own plane and

even set a 19% speed record in hi-,
twin-engine Beechcraft Baron.
In making his case to NASA that
he would he a gtn>d subject for
experimentation, Cilenn argued that
his superb condition, base.ine inlor-

mation gathered during his first
space training and records from
yearh physicals provide a unique
starting point lor a stud\ of osteo
porosis and changes in the body's
immune system during aging.


Sen. John Glenn could get a chance to prove he still has "the
right stuff" if NASA decides to let him fly aboard the space shut
tle, nearly 36 years after his landmark first space flight. NASA
said it planned a "major announcement" today.
