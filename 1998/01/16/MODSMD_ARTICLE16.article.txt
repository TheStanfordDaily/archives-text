American-led weapons team for a
third straight day.

the latest, stubborn standoff
between the United Nations and
Iraq.

ican inspector Scott Rittcr had too
many Americans and Britons,
refused Tuesday and Wednesday to
send the required escorts for Rit
ter's squad. Yesterday, his crew

latest defiance and demanding
unrestricted access for inspectors.

signal" that the world was losing
patience with Iraq.

urged Iraq to drop its ban on Ra
ter's team.

thetic to Iraq saw through this total
ly unacceptable action." Clinton
said. "Now we have to see what
happens."

ambassador. Ni/ar Hamdi>on. dis
missed the latest Security Council
demand — the fourth since Iraq
ordered American inspectors out of
the country last fall, opening a con
flict that was ended with the help of
Russian mediation.
"I think that we have lost our
sensitivity to United Nations' Secu
rity Council statements." Hamdix>n
said on NBC-TV's "Today" pro

gram.
Hamdoon said the only way to
resolve the dispute was tor the
I'nited Vtlions to end the "donu
nance by I S. citizens" ot the
inspection program.
Despite their support ot
Wednesday's statement. France.
Russia and China have been press
ing the I'nited Nations to include
inspectors trom other countries to
reduce the percentage ot Ameri
cans on Ratter s team.

eign Minister Hubert Yedrine is
expected to offer more French
experts when he meets Butler in
Paris today From Paris. Butler is to
head to the Middle East.
