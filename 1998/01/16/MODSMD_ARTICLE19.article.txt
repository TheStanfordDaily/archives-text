More options for satisfying
language requirement are
allowed through petitions.

IN LIGHT OF the diversity of the stu
dent body at Stanford and the variety of
career goals among us. it is commend
able that the University lias a mechanism in
place to ensure that students who have
studied less popular foreign languages can
meet the language requirement.
The language requirement affects all
students who entered Stanford during fall
quarter of 19%. Each undergraduate is
required to complete one year of college
level stud\ in a foreign language or the
equivalent, which allows placing out with a
qualifying score on an Advanced Place
ment test, a diagnostic test or one of the
SAT II subject tests.
Under the requirement's guidelines,
transfer students and entering freshman
who do not have sufficient language credit
are required to complete three quarters of a
first-year language course at Stanford. Typ
ically, the only courses that can fulfill this
requirement are those given for 4-units or
5-units per quarter — Spanish, French and
German, for example.
Courses given for 3-units, such as
Swahili. Vietnamese, Czech and American
Sign Language, would not fulfill the
requirement.
A recent decision by the Commission on
Undergraduate Studies has enabled stu

dents to petition Language Center Director
Elizabeth Bernhardt-Kamil for credit in
these languages. She now has the authority
to approve or deny requests at her discre
tion.
Not only does foreign language study
involve learning the language itself, it also
involves learning about the views and cul
ture of another community. The somewhat
arbitrary nature of how units are assigned
to courses should not preclude any student
from meeting the requirement — specifical
ly with a language that furthers that stu
dent's career study and exposes him or her
to another culture.
We are confident that the case-by-case
nature of these petitions will allow Bern
hardt-Kamil to weed out students who are
trying to take an easy route in fulfilling this
requirement.
If anything, however, this decision will
probably require students to spend even
more time in their language courses. For
example, Bernhardt-Kamil can approve
petitions on the condition that a student
enroll in a first-quarter, second-year course.
And often, students who petition will have
already completed far more units in their
specific language than someone who has
taken the more traditional path.
We commend the Committee on Under
graduate Studies for its decision. The lan
guage requirement was not intended to
penalize students interested in pursuing a
less common language. It was intended to
ensure that graduating students were com
petent in a language other than English.
This decision facilitates that goal.
