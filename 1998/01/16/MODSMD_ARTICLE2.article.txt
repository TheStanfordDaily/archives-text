# 'Righteous rebel'
## Cole calls King model of activism 
### Ann Kim Contributing writer 
Calling him a "rebel with a right
eous cause," former Spelman Col
lege President Johnnetta Cole
pointed to Martin Luther King Jr.'s
commitment to activism as a model
for young people today in her ad
dress at Kresge Auditorium last
night.
As the keynote speaker of Mar
tin Luther King Celebration Week.
Cole spoke with a powerful and
clear voice, promoting activism as
the best way to commemorate
King's life.
"1 have come to challenge you to
become fired-up activists," she said.
Though the era of legally segre
gated buses and schools is over. Cole
stressed that the struggle King led in
the l%()s for civil rights is not.
"Anyone who believes that we

are free at last, anyone who thinks
the struggle is over, is completely
out of touch," said Cole.
"These are the times when it is
not water hoses and billy clubs and
dogs attacking our people, but
drugs, teenage pregnancy, domestic
violence, high dropout rates from
school and perhaps worst of all.
hopelessness."
Recent initiatives such as Califor
nia's Proposition 209, an anti-affir
mative action bill approved by vot
ers in the 19% election, reflect a mis
conception that discrimination no
longer exists. Cole said.
"Who can say that we now have,
as African Americans, our fair share
of this incredible, rich nation?" she
asked. "Who can say that people of
color now wield the kind of political
influence and power that is rightful-
Iv ours in a practicing democracy?"
Cole cited statistics showing that
African-American women have one
chance in 21.(XK) of receiving a doc
torate in math, engineering or the
physical sciences. But these women
have a one-in-five chance of drop
ping out before high school gradua
tion, and a two-in-five chance of be
coming pregnant before they reach
age of 20.
In addition, college-age African-
American men are more likely to be
in jail or part of the criminal justice
system than enrolled in school.
She encouraged the audience to
respond to these grim statistics and
developments in the same way King
would have, with activism.
"Dr. King practiced the 'Noah
principle,'" said Cole. "No more
credit for predicting the rain: it's
time to build the ark."
As a first step toward activism.
Cole emphasized the importance of
education. Through education, she
said, we can understand how the
world is and how it came to be that
way. Then we can try to effect posi
tive change and thereby make the
world better.
Underlying this whole process,
according to Cole, is the need to "be
lieve that change is possible."
"Things get better only when or
dinary folk like you and me, and ex
traordinary folk like Brother Mar
tin, make things change," she said.
