## Waging and winning the war 
### 
AS WE FIND our
selves at the
beginning of the
Martin Luther King, Jr.
holiday weekend, it is our
right and indeed our duty
to reflect on his popularly
known vision for Ameri-

ca. It's a particularly salient time to do this
because we find ourselves riding on the
wake of the passage of Prop. 209, the pur
posefully named California Civil Rights Ini
tiative.
Because many of us are California resi
dents and/or registered California voters,
let me offer a suggestion for what should
occupy your thoughts while you're on the
ski lifts this weekend. You've got to ask
yourself what I think is a really simple ques
tion: do you want to "save" affirmative
action and if so, how?
Let's begin with defining the basic con
cept of affirmative action. At its heart, it is
about helping the least well off. It is about
helping people who have grown up with
fewer advantages. These notions, in and of
themselves, aren't very debatable. You
would be very hard pressed to find a signif
icant number of people willing to oppose
them, either in a bar, on a survey or at the
ballot box. However, when you start talking
about admissions preferences for blacks or
hiring preferences for minority-owned com
panies, many people's feathers begin to get
more than a little ruffled because it doesn't
mesh with their sense of fairness.
I don't want to argue in this little box of

print about what the details of affirmative
action policies should be. While 1 think the
case is particularly strong for promoting
class-based affirmative action policies, oth
ers may advocate dropping the affirmative
action issue altogether as too controversial
and distracting in favor of promoting other
policies designed to aid minorities and the
poor. I'd be happy to chat with you about
implementation ideas in private.
What I do want to argue is that the pro
ponents of affirmative action, in particular
those who were most vociferously opposed
to Prop. 209, are foolishly waging the fight
in a way they can't win.
I received an e-mail just a couple of
weeks ago about a ballot initiative proposal
coming out of Berkeley that would simply
reverse Prop. 209 — it specifically would
restore affirmative action for public univer
sity admissions.
That's just plain dumb. Even if by some
miracle such a proposition could be placed
on the ballot (it would require 650,0(X) sig
natures), it won't pass. It can't pass. Prop.
209 was overwhelmingly successful. The
forces it brought together will not sit idly by
as well-intentioned but misguided individu
als try to restore affirmative action to the
way it used to be.
California's "old school" affirmative
action policies are dead. Proponents of
affirmative action principles need first, to
accept that fact and second, to offer an
alternative to the reigning status quo cur
rently presided over by 209.
Such an alternative (or alternatives)

needs to be presented in a well thought
out proposal to gain any sort of legitimacy
with the voting public. There is, after all, a
tremendous amount of research available
on public opinion (particularly white pub
lic opinion) regarding various types of
affirmative action policies. While such
research can and should be utilized to
"mend" affirmative action, screaming and
shouting, handcuffing yourself to a fence
and asserting that all opponents of affir
mative action are "racist" 1) negatively
labels affirmative action supporters as
unruly radical hippies, 2) alienates whites
whose conception of fairness is quite justi
fiably violated by certain affirmative
action policies, though they are not racist
and 3) is useless because it offers no alter
native to these policies that a majority of
Californians (and Americans) clearly
oppose.
Most importantly, the alternative (or
alternatives) needs to be politically viable.
What will make it a political winner at the
ballot box is a strong coalition not just of
minorities, but of minorities and whites.
Justice is not an issue domain exclusive to
those groups most often plagued by social
inequalities. Supporters of affirmative
action must design an alternative that inher
ently creates and encourages such a coali
tion by appealing to people's senses of
what's fair.

Darron Evans, a senior public policy
major, would like help drafting such an ini
tiative if anyone's interested.
