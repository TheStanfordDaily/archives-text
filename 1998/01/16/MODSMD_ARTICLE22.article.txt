Graduate issues need
more consideration
As former chair of the ASSU's commit
tee that surveyed the graduate community
last year. I would like to comment on your
article concerning graduate social planning
("More than parties," Jan. 15).
It has been very gratifying to see certain
administrators (notably Dean Wais, Vice
Provost Montoya and Dean Wasow)
respond in such a positive manner to the
issues raised in the committee's report
(available on-line at http://www-leland.stan
ford.edu/~natelson/rAßE.html). Certainly

an increased social support structure is a
positive step, as are efforts under way that
examine housing and funding issues
(though University time scales for decisions
are still depressingly long).
However, the lack of response to other
concerns mentioned in the report has been
disheartening, especially given that many
such issues should he relatively simple to
address, compared with building new hous
ing. etc. For example, the Bursar's billing
structure is completely arcane — does it
make sense for the Bursar to send me sev
eral bills per quarter, none of which actual
ly show what I really owe? How hard
would it be for there to be an axess-based
method of checking your bill? Turning to

the Registrar, why do I have to file a TGR
zero-unit study list every quarter and face
fines, when it should he a relatively simple
matter to let me file study lists for multiple
quarters at a time? Then there's trans
portation services: the parking shortage for
those of us with C stickers is severe, and
hear in mind that some folks are forced to
drive because of the housing situation. The
relevant administrators all received the
report, as well as a subsequent e-mail alert
ing them to the on-line version, with no
response.
I'm glad that progress is being made, but
we still have a way to g0....
