10 Conference) defeats IJSC (6-7,
1-3) tonight at 7 p.m. its confer
ence win streak will be at one as
Stanford's 48-game conference
streak ended in a one-point
thriller in Arizona on Monday.
The loss to the ninth-ranked
Wildcats also ended Stanford's
season-best four-game win streak,
and placed the Card in a serious
conference race for the first time
in three seasons. When the Cardi
nal takes the court tonight at the
Lyon Center, it finds itself staring
up at Arizona in the conference
standings.
"I personally think we out
played Arizona with the excep
tion of what we did at the free
throw line," said head coach Tara


Rebecca Roberts — Daily file
Senior forward Heather Owen and the Cardinal look to re
bound from a tough loss tonight against (JSC. With fellow se
nior forward Naomi Mulitauoapele out for the season, Owen's
role becomes that much more important.
VanDerveer. "I think people have to
be upset and disappointed about los
ing. They'll hopefully channel that
into playing better. The thing that
happens is you lose confidence, so
the most important thing is for peo
ple to play with confidence."
Stanford also begins its first game
with the knowledge that senior
Naomi Mulitauaopele is out for the
year. The 6-foot-4 forward, who has
been listed as week-to-week for a
majority of the season, will undergo
knee surgery and not return this sea
son as originally hoped.
"We were just hoping to have her
down the homestretch," Van-
Derveer said. "As long as you say
week-to-week you hold onto that
hope. But her No. 1 priority is to get
healthy."
Barring any slim hope, it will
make junior forward Kristin Folkl's
role that much more important. Folkl
has been putting up phenomenal
numbers in her five games back, av
eraging 16.2 points (first on the team)
and 9.4 rebounds (second). In those
five games, she has posted three dou
ble-doubles. including Monday's 21
points and 10 rebounds versus Ari
zona. Wouldn't that type of produc
tion be better served in a starting
role?
"1 think she's reallv comfortable

with (coming off the bench). and our
team is comfortable with it." Van-
Derveer said. "I think the way our
team has been playing, there's been a
real difference between our starters
and the bench, and she fills that gap.
The thing Kristin gives us is a pure
sixth player. 1 think she's helping our
team tremendously, and she's com
fortable with that role."
So in a season that's seen the Car
dinal take small steps toward im
provement. deal with setbacks and
continue onward, this weekend may
be the biggest yet. The loss to Ari
zona is really the first game Stanford
can say it played well for the entire
game, but still lost. Add to that the
difficulty of playing in Los Angeles
and the Cardinal again finds itself in
what is essentially a must-win situa
tion.
"Anytime you lose a game you
like to get back in the saddle again."
VanDerveer said. "We're playing the
best we have all year. And to basical
ly get beat by that one thing (free
throw shooting) is gtxxj and bad. We
played well, but we did something so
glaring. Hopefully people will re fo
cus and get hungry to win."
Stanford will gel sUirtul ou thjt
goal tonight against USG. flur
Women of Troy sit at the bottom of
the conference and is a young team
that has endured some injuries this
season. Junior guard Kristin Hark
leads USC with an average of 15.2
points, while a familiar face roams

the sidelines, having replaced the de
parted Fred Williams.
Head coach (Tins Gobrecht re
turns to her alma mater for her sec
ond tour of duty in the Pac-10. having
previously coached 11 seasons at
Washington. There were many
memorable battles between the two
old rivals, although VanDerveer ex
pects a slight change.
"She adds a little spice to the Pac
-10." VanDerveer said. "One of the
things that was so effective was the
crowd that Washington had. And I
don't know if USC is going to have
that kind of crowd."
UCLA will offer a bigger chal
lenge for Stanford on Sunday That
contest is the Pac-10 Game of the
Week and begins at 4 p.m. The Bru
ms (8-5, 3-1) are tied with the Card
for second in the conference and
have faced a tough schedule this sea
son. Back in December UCLA trav
eled to and beat 25th-ranked Duke
and fell to No. 7 North Carolina in
overtime.
Leading the Bruins is last year's
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year Mav
lana Martin. The sophomore is third
in the conference in scoring and leads
UCLA with 21 points and 8.2 re
bounds per game.
"This is a really important road
trip for us." VanDerveer said. "It's
not like it's make or break time, but
in a way we want to show that the
Arizona game was a fluke. Any of
these games are going to be tough."
