# Former Cardinal golfer Casey Martin sues PGA
## 
### Ben Freda Staff writer 
After the huge success of Tiger Woods, it
would seem that the Professional Golfers'
Association would welcome any other Stan
ford graduate golfer with open arms.
But such is not the case with 1995 Stan
ford graduate Casey Martin, an All-Ameri
can, who has been given the cold shoulder in
a conflict with the governing body of golf.
Martin is afflicted with a rare birth defect,
called Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syn
drome, that causes severe pain and swelling
in his lower leg. When the pain flares. Martin
can barely walk.
Back in college, as Stanford golf coach
Wally Goodwin explained, the NCAA grant
ed Martin the right to ride in a golf cart in all
tournaments.
"The NCAA gave him permission to use a
cart as he saw fit." Goodwin said. "But he sel
dom did it. It was always around the end of
the season, when his leg started to hurt."'
But Martin is finding life post-Stanford
less cordial. The PGA refused to grant Mar
tin the same right in last weekend's Nike
Lakeland Classic in Lakeland. Fla.
So Martin sued the PCiA under the Amer
icans with Disabilities Act. and a federal
court injunction stipulated that he be al
lowed to use the cart in the two tournaments
before the case goes to court Feb. 2 in Eu
gene. Ore. He became the first person not on
the Senior Tour to ever use a cart in a PCiA

sponsored tournament.
"I'm really thankful I had the cart." Mar
tin said in Florida last weekend. "I hate to
think where I'd be without it. Those days
when I have to walk I'm big-time behind the
eight-ball."
By the end of play on Saturday, a cart-en
dowed Martin had pulled even with the lead
ers at the Nike Tournament. A day later, he
had won, shooting a 69 to finish at a 19-under
par 269.
But Martin's run in golf could hit a sharp
snag if the cart is taken away from him. Hut
the PGA Tour won't budge.
In a statement after Martin's victory on
Sunday, PGA Tour Commissioner Tim
Finchem released a statement saying. "The
fact remains that Mr. Martin participated
and won while using a golf cart under the
terms of a court order."
"The outcome of this week's Nike Lake
land Classic doesn't in any way affect the
PGA Tour position relative to the use of golf
carts."
The PCiA lour contends that walking the
course is an integral part of golf, and that al
lowing Martin to use a cart could give him an
undue advantage over other golfers tired
from walking.
But Goodwin said that having to ride in a
cart might actually be worse for Martin, who
used the cart in college tournaments only
when completely necessary.
