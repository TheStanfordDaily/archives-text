# Streak is alive and well for the Cardinal

No Cardinal men's basketball
leam has started a season better.
Ever.
It turned into a night of records
as the Stanford squad thrashed
USC 99-62 to run its record to 15-0.
The 15 consecutive wins to start the
year breaks the mark set by the
1936-37 Stanford Indians, who
began their season with 14 straight
victories and went on to finish the
season 25-2.
The win also marked the 19th
consecutive time the Cardinal has
been victorious at Maples Pavilion,
another Stanford record.
The seventh-ranked Card also
remains one of two undefeated
teams in the country, and currently
holds the longest winning streak in
the nation.
"It feels great." junior guard
Kris Weems said. "We want to con
tinue this success. The coaches
have done a great job. and lots of
guys have stepped up off the
bench."
Stanford has not lost a game in
nearly 10 months, and a few mem
bers of the Cardinal squad have
never lost a collegiate contest. At
least half of Stanford's undergrad
uate student body has been spoiled
with a win even time they have
cheered at Maples.
"I was concerned about USC,"
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "With the distractions
and the records, I felt we might not
be ready."
He was wrong. The Card earned
its record start with a thorough beat
ing of the Trojans. The 37-point
margin of victory was the biggest
ever against USC, and the squad tied
yet another record with 15 three
pointers, five of which were nailed
by junior point guard Arthur Lee.
"I guess they figured I couldn't
shoot," Lee said. "I kept putting it up,
and it was working. I don't know
what they were thinking. Our front
line is too deep, but if they want to
play off me, I'll drill it."
Stanford assaulted USC from the
inside as well. Senior Pete Van El
swyk turned in a career perfor
mance, scoring 14 points and ripping
down 12 rebounds. All told, the
Card outrebounded the over
matched Trojans 52-28.
"They are a very good basket
ball team," USC head coach Henry
Bibby said. "They are just so much

bigger than us, and everyone was in
their rhythm.
"We were in the game against
Kansas, and we were in the game
against Arizona. We were never in
this one."
As if Stanford needed more moti
vation, an incident before the game
provided it.
During warm-ups, USC annoyed
the Card by shooting on Stanford's
side of the court while the Stanford
players were stretching. The act of
disrespect did not bode well for the
Trojans.
"You don't come into our house
disrespecting us," Weems said. "We
came out with something to prove."
Dunks from four Cardinal play
ers put an exclamation point to the
win. Junior Mark Seaton sent a
tremor through Maples by dunking
a high alley-oop pass from freshman
Jarron Collins, unofficially the best
dunk of the season.
"It was a pretty well played
game," Montgomery said. "We are
playing with lots of confidence."
Next up: the record for the most
consecutive wins ever by a Stan
ford team. In case anyone is keep
ing track, the 60-year-old mark
stands at 17.
