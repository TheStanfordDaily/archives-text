# Streak is alive and well for the Cardinal

### Ben Hur Senior staff writer 
No Cardinal men's basketball
leam has started a season better.
Ever.
It turned into a night of records
as the Stanford squad thrashed
USC 99-62 to run its record to 15-0.
The 15 consecutive wins to start the
year breaks the mark set by the
1936-37 Stanford Indians, who
began their season with 14 straight
victories and went on to finish the
season 25-2.
The win also marked the 19th
consecutive time the Cardinal has
been victorious at Maples Pavilion,
another Stanford record.
The seventh-ranked Card also
remains one of two undefeated
teams in the country, and currently
holds the longest winning streak in
the nation.
"It feels great." junior guard
Kris Weems said. "We want to con
tinue this success. The coaches
have done a great job. and lots of
guys have stepped up off the
bench."
Stanford has not lost a game in
nearly 10 months, and a few mem
bers of the Cardinal squad have
never lost a collegiate contest. At
least half of Stanford's undergrad
uate student body has been spoiled
with a win even time they have
cheered at Maples.
