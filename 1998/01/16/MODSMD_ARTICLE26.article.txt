levels.
The Cardinal carry most of the
momentum going into tomorrow's

game. Yesterday's 37-point trounc
ing of USC built up the team's confi
dence while allowing head coach
Mike Montgomery's starting lineup
to get lots of rest. It also allowed the
deep Stanford bench to see a lot of
minutes.
"We want to beat every and any
LA team that comes in here. [The
momentum] is definitely going to
carry over." said junior point guard
Arthur Lee. "We're going to come
out and keep doing the things we've
been doing, keep sustaining gtxxl
defense throughout the game."
The Bruins began the season

with forward Kris Johnson and cen
ter Jelani McCoy on suspension, but
in their absence forward J.R Hen
derson was able to step up big.
Henderson led the Bruins
with 1 points and B.f> rebounds per
game coming into this week's trip
through California and Stanford,
and he continued his torrid scoring
pace with 23 points last night against
the Bears
But UCLA has struggled its pasl
couple of games and barely pulled
out victories. Thev trailed for mosi
of last night's game against the
Bears before finally taking the lead
and hanging on for a 74-73 win.
Last Saturday at Pauley Pavilion,
the Bruins blew a 19 point lead
against the Oregon Ducks before es
caping with a 6K-66 victory.
Though they haven't been able to
string together a completely domi
nating win this year, the Bruin squad
is overloaded with great talent.
The backcourt consists of talent
ed freshman guards. Point guard
Baron Davis has been one of the na
tion's most exciting newcomers, av
eraging 11.9 points, 5.1 assists and
4.6 rebounds per game.
Earl Watson has been solid
alongside of Davis, and his defen
sive skills have been tremendous.
He shares the Pac-10 lead with 2.6
steals per game.
The main aspect of the UCLA
game that the Cardinal must stop is
the Bruin transition game, which is
probably the best in the Pac-10. All
five starters have the abili'y to play
in the open court and finish strongly
on the offensive side.
"They're just so doggone explo
sive," Montgomery said. "1 don't
think there's any question that four
of their starters are first-round draft
choices.
"The biggest problem they pre
sent. other than their individual tal
ent. is their ability to run the floor."
Of course, the Bruins also have a
little extra motivation.
Last year, the Cardinal embar
rassed UCLA 109-61 in what has
been dubbed the Massacre at
Maples, the worst loss in the history
of UCLA's basketball program.
"I'm sure the players remember
the Maples Massacre because
they're competitive and they have
pride," said Bruin head coach Steve
Lavin. "1 think that the real point of
emphasis is that it's a Pac-10 road

trip and you're considering league
standings and positioning yourself
for a run at the conference champi
onship.
"It's really more than payback or
revenge or the kind of short-term
motivation that those kind of moti
vational techniques play into. We're
always thinking more about the con
ference."
The Cardinal team doesn't need
to be told twice about how impor
tant this game is. It knows full well
that this game will be used by others
to assess its status among the elite
teams in the country.

Tmsure the players re
member the Maples Mas
sacre because they're com
petitive and they have
pride. I think that the real
point of emphasis is that its
aPac-10road trip and
you're considering league
standings and positioning
and yourself for a run at the
conference championship.'

"It's definitely a measuring
stick." said guard Kris Weems. "We
haven't been in the top-10 for a very
long, long time. We're trying to get
to that level and stay there right
now. Beating them would he great
for us because I think now it's more
of a chance to show how good we
are and how much we've improved
over the last two or three years."
Lee doesn't see things exactly the
same way.
"We know we're good." he said.
"We've played some good teams de
spite what everyone else thinks. We
have something to prove Saturday.
Something to prove to ourselves
and. I guess, everybody else."
