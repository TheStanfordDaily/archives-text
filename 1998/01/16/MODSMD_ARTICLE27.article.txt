seventh-ranked and undefeated
Ohio State Buckeyes.
While many of Stanford's fellow
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
rivals opened their seasons with
conference matchups, the Cardinal
opens with a difficult match that
could become important at the end
of the season, when tournament se
lections are made.
For those who saw any Cardinal
matches last season, they will see a
slightly different team this year
With the loss of eight players from
last year's squad, returning starters
Senior Keenan Whitehurst and
Sophomore Andy Witt will lead a
young, hut certainly not inexperi
enced. team.

Seniors Tad Hoffman and Devin
Poolman and Junior Patrick Klein
have all started in prior years; Fresh
men Brad Griffith and Josh Lukens
both played on the 1997 U.S. Junior
National Team.
"Both setters (Griffith and
Lukens) can run the offense as well
as or better than Stewart Chong,"
said Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves. the 1997 Volleyball Maga
zine and American Volleyball
Coaches Association Coach of the
Year.
The Cardinal's style of play will
also be a change. Last season, the
team relied on dominant outside hit
ters and could get away with less
sharp passing. I'his season, the team
has improved passing and ball con
trol, and has also worked on
stronger serves and better move
ment. Fans will see a more sophisti
cated offense that has more ele
ments than |ust strong hitting.
Ohio State is one of few Division
I teams over whom the Cardinal will
have a size advantage. What the
Buckeyes lack in si/e. though, they
will make up in intensity and emtv
tion. Because of this intensity, Stan
ford cannot allow OSl 1 to get too far
ahead in the point total because they
are a go*>d sideout team and will not

give up points easily. OSU is also a
team that could expose Stanford's
weaknesses.
They have been shut out of the
NCAA Championships for the past
few years and will be looking to im
press the selection committee with a
victory over a tough non-conference
opponent. Tonight they will play

urday.
For the Cardinal to win tomor
row, it will need to eliminate sloppy
play, convert on all point opportuni
ties, and match sideouts. Although a
size advantage does exist for Stan
ford, OSU could easily shut that ad
vantage down.
"We need to control the ball well
to capitalize on our size advantage,"
Nieves said.

Stanford would like nothing bet
ter than to start their season with a
victory of this magnitude.
"The preseason polls ranked
OSU seventh and us eighth." Grif
fith said. " The rankings have really
motivated the team."
The match on Saturday will be
the first opportunity 112( th Stanford
community to see the lefending na
tional champions.
"I hope the students and fans will
get involved." Nieves said.
