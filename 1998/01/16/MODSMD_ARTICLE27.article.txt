Ohio State Buckeyes.
While many of Stanford's fellow
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
rivals opened their seasons with
conference matchups, the Cardinal
opens with a difficult match that
could become important at the end
of the season, when tournament se

Poolman and Junior Patrick Klein
have all started in prior years; Fresh
men Brad Griffith and Josh Lukens
both played on the 1997 U.S. Junior
National Team.

Lukens) can run the offense as well
as or better than Stewart Chong,"

stronger serves and better move

Ohio State is one of few Division

have a size advantage. What the
Buckeyes lack in si/e. though, they
will make up in intensity and emtv
