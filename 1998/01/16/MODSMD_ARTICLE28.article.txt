## Stanford takes to the mat against Oregon State 
### Evan Meagher Contributing writer 
I he Stanford wrestling team
hosts Oregon State at Burnham
Pavilion on Saturday Night. Co-
Captain Scott Chapman will return
from his absence at the Aggie Open
at Davis last weekend, as will co
captain Jeff Cirant, whose strained
knee ligament precluded him from
competition.
A perennial top-ten team, Ore
gon State finished behind Stanford
at last year's Pacific 10 Conference
tournament, but has returned to
form with a 7-4 start this season.
OSIJ will be the favorite in Satur
day's matchup.
"It ought to be a brawl." said red
shirt freshman Kayvon Bina.
Stanford will again forfeit the
heavyweight division, and so will
have to rely on stalwarts B.J.
Sanchez and Zach Zimmerer to con

tinue their streak of superb
wrestling. Tim Kendall faces a tough
match the 190-pound division
against OSIJ freshman Shane Zajac,
who is 14-2 on the season. Warren
Mcpherson will have his hands full
at the 142-pound division against

Eric Jorgensen or Oscar Wood, who
are a combined 28-12 in various
lower middle weight classes.
"We expect a really tough dual
meet against them." said Stanford
head coach Chris Horpel. "They're
definitely the favorite."
The match will be the first Stan

ford wrestles under the new NC AA
mandated weight rules, which essen
tially move all weight classes up by
seven pounds. As Oregon State has
relied heavily on massive weight cut
ting (Brothers Ivan and Oscar
Wood, for example, have shuttled
between two weight classes) they
will be forced to rearrange their line
up to accommodate the new regula
tions.
In effect, the Oregon State
wrestlers will thus have to wrestle at
heavier weights than they are used
to, whereas Stanford has very few
wrestlers cutting significant
poundage to make weight. This may
create a slight advantage for Stan
ford, as their training practices re
main relatively unaffected by the
NCAA's decision.
"These new regulations have
forced a lot of teams to juggle their
rosters." said Horpel, who is on the
NCAA Rules Committee that came
up with the new regulations.
