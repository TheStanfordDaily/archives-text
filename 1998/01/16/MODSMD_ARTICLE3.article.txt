"Hey guys. CSIO6A is on!"
At about 12:50 p.m. all over campus, students gath
er in dorm lounges, wrest the remote control from the
MTV fans and Hip channels.
Imagine being able to tune into this class, and all of
your other classes on a computer.
The California Virtual University is making this
scenario a reality for students all over California and
the world.
Established in April of last year, the CVU is a state
operated World Wide Web-based clearing house for
the online course offerings of 65 California colleges
and universities. The university, located at www.cali
fornia.edu, currently lists more than S(X) courses.
Stanford, as a founding member, has played a
major role in the development of the university. Gov
ernor Pete Wilson met with University President Ger
hard Casper and other California university leaders
late last year to discuss the progress of the project.
Stanford Senior Assoc. Dean of Engineering Andy
DiPaolo represents the University on the CVU De
sign Team.
Wilson recently visited Silicon Valley to announce
several corporate sponsorships of the CVU, including
Sun Microsystems and Microsoft.
The CVU has progressed quiekly.
"Our goal is to have a completely searchable cata
log online within the first quarter of this year." said
Rich Halberg. spokesman for the virtual university.
"Ideally, at some point,students will be able to look
up the class they want, click to that college's Web site,
register, pay tuition, and even order books right
there." he said.
