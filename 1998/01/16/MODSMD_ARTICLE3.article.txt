## Stanford plays role in developing web-based center for online courses 
### Evan Nordby 
"Hey guys. CSIO6A is on!"
At about 12:50 p.m. all over campus, students gath
er in dorm lounges, wrest the remote control from the
MTV fans and Hip channels.
Imagine being able to tune into this class, and all of
your other classes on a computer.
The California Virtual University is making this
scenario a reality for students all over California and
the world.
Established in April of last year, the CVU is a state
operated World Wide Web-based clearing house for
the online course offerings of 65 California colleges
and universities. The university, located at www.cali
fornia.edu, currently lists more than S(X) courses.
Stanford, as a founding member, has played a
major role in the development of the university. Gov
ernor Pete Wilson met with University President Ger
hard Casper and other California university leaders
late last year to discuss the progress of the project.
Stanford Senior Assoc. Dean of Engineering Andy
DiPaolo represents the University on the CVU De
sign Team.
Wilson recently visited Silicon Valley to announce
several corporate sponsorships of the CVU, including
Sun Microsystems and Microsoft.
The CVU has progressed quiekly.
"Our goal is to have a completely searchable cata
log online within the first quarter of this year." said
Rich Halberg. spokesman for the virtual university.
"Ideally, at some point,students will be able to look
up the class they want, click to that college's Web site,
register, pay tuition, and even order books right
there." he said.
The CVU does not grant degrees
or offer classes itself. Halberg ex
plained. Each individual college is
responsible for admissions, tuition,
course offerings, credit, and the nuts
and bolts of delivering classes over
the Web.
Like any new university, howev
er. the CVU is choosing a mascot.
Appropriate to it's character as an
online entity, nominees include the
Bugs, the Browsers, and the Fight
ing Cathode Ray l übes.
The CVU's initial focus is on con
tinuing and professional education,
meaning undergraduates will have
to wait for that online Human Sexu
ality course.
A few years from now. however,
an upcoming undergraduate popu
lation boom might be partially han
dled online through the California
State University and community

college systems.
One mission of the CVU is to en
courage schools to offer more cours
es online. and thus available through
its Web page. Governor Pete Wil
son has included $6.1 million in his
proposed 1998-99 budget for Cali
fornia public schools to accomplish
this.
It is possible now, however, to
earn a doctorate almost entirely on
line. Pepperdine University in Mal
ibu offers a doctorate in Education
Technology, and the Fielding Insti
tute in Santa Barbara offers one in
psychology.
Most online classes are text
based. though some schools are cur
rently using short video or sound
clips.
Stanford, a notable exception, is
the only school in the world to use
streaming video for its online pro
gram.
Professors post lectures and class
assignments on line and interact
with students over phone and e

mail, just as many do in a traditional
educational setting. Some profes
sors also hold online discussions,
using software specially designed
for online courses.
"We want to try to use technolo
gy to simulate the on-campus gradu
ate experience," said Di Paolo, who
is also executive director of Stan
ford's Center for Professional De
velopment. "We want to provide the
Stanford experience to you whether
you're in Boston, Tokyo, or Brus
sels."
Unlike the majority of CVU-in
dexed programs, Stanford Online is
open only to on-campus students
and employees of member compa
nies.
However, for those eligible and
admitted - "the best and brightest
around the world," according to I)i-
Paolo - Stanford offers courses in
engineering and computer science.
All of these are graduate level, ex
cept for the aforementioned
CSIO6A.
