# Sheep clowning now a reality

In what can only be described as the
greatest bio-technological achievement in the
known universe, scientists in a remote swamp
somewhere in Florida have finally achieved
the successful clowning of a sheep. "We didn't
think we could do it. It just seemed impossi
ble. We thought humor was an attribute spe
cific to humans. But having laughed heartily
at the sight of a cow kicking another cow's
comically large buttocks, it occurred to me
that animals do have the potential for come
dy." explained head scientist Ronaldo Hissen.
Clowning a sheep is an amazingly simple
process. First, the donor cells are placed
under a culture, in this case European rather
than American due to the former's higher
incidence ol clownomes, the fundamental
building-block of all clown cell behavior.
Once in a culture, the cell can then be
genetically manipulated, either through elec
trical current, photon-destructor rays or by a
big blob of clown sperm. This is how the cells
pick up clown traits such as the big red nose,
the receding hairline stretching to the back of
the head and the ability to fit in very small
vehicles. "We wanted the best. We weren't
interested in those two-bit, airy-fairy Cirque
De Soleil clowns. If it didn't fall over for a liv
ing, we didn't want its sperm," said Mr.
Hissen.
The team acquired the sperm of a clown
by the name of Ramper, who in 1910 revolu
tionized the clown world overnight by devis
ing a method of kicking himself in the pants,
thus rendering obsolete one half of the clown
workforce .
The little clown sheep, affectionately
christened Johnny Cien Pesos, is just learning

to honk its nose, but soon, Mr. Farher
explains "we'll try to awaken its juggling
instinct."
The scientists are cautious though. Mr.
Hissen explained that Ramper had a history
of suicidal tendencies that might extend to
Johnny Cien. "Once. Ramper said to a friend
he'd uncovered the key to comedy and
described a show where he would climb to the
top of the trapeze pole, announce to the audi
ence that he could fly, then simply fall to his
death. His friend, taking him as the joker
Ramper always was, simply said: 'Great, do
that two times every week and we'll be rich!'"
"Ultimately, all clowns are manic depres
sive individuals who embody the personality
of the moody, heroic artist, who, in reality,
only pretend to be socially repressed and
angered. — intense, in a word — their only
reason for doing so being to git wid the
weemen." explained Mr. Hissen.

Clown, show off their clowning.
