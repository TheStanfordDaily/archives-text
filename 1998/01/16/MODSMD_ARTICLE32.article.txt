# No longer are the answers "Blowing in the Wind."

### 
In his classic folk ballad "Blowin' in the
Wind" Bob Dylan asked a lot of questions
with numerical answers that have troubled
the minds of intelligent people ever since. In
time for the Bob Dylan conference, hosted
bv Stanford, a research group has released
the following answers:
1. Before a man can be called "a man" he
must walk down 33 roads precisely; any less
and he can't be called a man, any "more, and
he must be called Susan.
2. White doves don't generally go sailing,
their wings make poor manipulators of rope
and rudder. Thev do, however, sleep in tne
sand a lot. So tne answer is zero; a white
dove doesn't have to sail over any sea before
she sleeps in the sand. (Thought you could
get me with the trick question aid you? Nice
try, folk prophet boy.)
3. Cannon balls can't fly — no wings. So
banning them's not really an issue. Fiowev
er, if I saw 67 flying carinon-balls I'd have
them banned immediately.
4. A mountain can exist for quite a few years
before il s washed into the sea. that's simple
geology. 1 lowever, ifyou're looking for a pre
cise number 688, 699, 789, 544 would seem
as good as any other.
5. Two.
6. The key to this question is the time inter

val involved. For instance, over a lifetime, a
man can easily turn his head 300 times and
pretend that he just doesn't see. Over a
minute it's more difficult. The physical
exertion of turning a head so many times
over so short a time interval will, in all prob
ability, result in the man's head falling off.
7. One less than the amount of babies it
takes to fill a swimming pool with drool.
8. Well, to hear people cry a man normally
requires at least one ear. For stereo listen
ing, of course, two ears would be the abso
lute minimum. Five ears is probably three
ears too many.
9. The souare root of the sum of the squares
of the other two sides.
Other questions Bob Dylan might have
asked in his folk classic:
Ifl have nine apples and I give two to my
friend, how many apples do 1 have?
What 's the capital of New York State ?
Yes and how many times can a man say "Yes
and"in a song before it stops to mean any
thing?
How many times can a man nostalgically
sing this song with his middle-class baby
boomer suburbanite friends before he real
izes the bland hypocrisy of the situation t


Bob Dylan likes to wear a cowboy hat and
think aeep thoughts because he s a rebel.
