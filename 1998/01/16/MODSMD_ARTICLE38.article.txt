A quarter-century after the
Supreme Court decided the fate of
abortion in Roe v. Wade, women's
fundamental right to choice contin
ues to be challenged, according to
Kate Michelson, president of the Na
tional Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League.
Michelson addressed an intimate
gathering of students at the Women's
Center yesterday, in order "to cele
brate and commemorate the most
important court decision for
women's rights," she said.
As she presented the history of re
productive and abortion rights, she
emphasized the negative effects on
women's freedom of of some remain
ing birth control restrictions. She
cited federal employees, women in
the military and women on welfare as
victims of restrictions.
Michelson touched on her own
difficulty obtaining an abortion be

fore the Roe decision, citing the hu
miliation and prejudices she faced.
"1 never realized how discriminat
ed against women were |until faced
with my own struggle with abor
tion]." she said.
Michelson expressed concern
over laws that take away women's
birth control and abortion rights.
Michelson said women's choice in
this matter is "just as central and im
portant as the freedom to vote and
freedom of religion."
Michelson cited the defense of the
"fundamental right to choice" as her
organization's goal, arguing that it ex
tends far beyond abortion.
"Without reproductive control, a
woman has no other constitutional
right." said Michelson. "Women's
consciousness was recognized by the
Roe decision."
She said more efforts should be
made in the United States to pro
mote education and contraceptive
options to the level of several Euro
pean countries, where women's op-

lions are much more abundant and
socially acceptable.
An open discussion followed
Michelson's speech, in which stu
dents voiced differing arguments.
Topics ranged from questions
about the cost of abortion to racial
and economic issues in abortion
rights. Michelson fielded many tech
nical questions and discussed viabili
ty, justifiable homicide and responsi
bility for one's actions.
One pro-life student at the speech
vehemently rejected the idea of abor
tion, calling it immoral and irrespon
sible. while others expressed their
concern about the moral implications
of abortion and presented alterna
tives, such as adoption.
Throughout the discussion,
Michelson consistently returned to
the individual woman's right to con
trol her own body as the justification
for the right to abortion.
"When you strip away all the poli
tics. it's all about who decides," she
said.
