### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
The last time the men's basket
ball team started 14-0, Hank
Luisetti and his fellow Indians saw
their perfect record snapped bv
USC. 42-39.
Either history didn't repeat it
self or the Stanford basketball pro
gram was still extremely bitter
about that loss.
The No. 7 Cardinal (154). 4-0
Pacific 10 Conference) used most
of their 99-62 romp over the Tro
jans last night at Maples Pavilion
to rest their starting lineup for to
morrow's showdown against No. N
UCLA.
Along with recording the
school's best start in history, the
Cardinal also won its record 19th
straight at Maples and tied the
school mark for most three-point
ers made in one game at 15.
And with Wednesday's Mars
land victory over North Carolina,
the Cardinal's 15-game winning
streak is now the longest in the na

tion.
The smaller Troy team never
stood a chance against a Cardinal
lineup that runs both tall and deep.
Bv halftime. Stanford held a 27-11
rebounding advantage and had
pulled down 14 offensive re
bounds.
Six Cardinal players ended up
scoring in double figures while ju
nior forward Peter Sauer finished
with nine.
"We had a tremendous advan
tage on the boards." said Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery.
"You're able to get more shots
with those second-shot opportuni
ties."
In all. the Cardinal offense had
22 rebounds. CSC could only get
2X rebounds total.
Senior power forward Pete Van
Elswvk had his best night so far
this season with his first-ever dou
ble-double. He scored a career
high 14 points and tied his best re
bounding performance with 12

hoards, including five on offense.
Center Tim Young and Van Elswyk each got a hoard
off the offensive glass for early puthacks. When the Tro
jan guards collapsed on the inside to give some defen
sive help, point guard Art Lee was ahle to sink a pair of
treys. Still, USC held on early and trailed only 11-9 at
the 15 minute, 37 second mark.
After that, it was all Cardinal.
The team went on a 26-9 run, over the next nine min
utes. Swingman Ryan Mendez led the attack with seven
points during that stretch.
Sauer fed Van Elswyk for a dunk with 3:23 left in the
half, giving the Cardinal a 24-point lead, their largest of
the first period. They went into the locker room with a
50-32 advantage.
"Very rarely did we miss the open man. That make's
everybody want to play a team game," Montgomery
said."
The second half consisted of more Stanford high
lights and plenty of rest for the starting lineup.
A dazzling layup by freshman forward Jarron Collins
and his free-throw that followed capped a 13-0 Cardinal
run and gave the team a 74-41 lead and brought the
crowd to a fever pitch.
Trojan forward Jarvis Turner then hit a 5-f(X)t hook
shot to curb the Cardinal's momentum a little.
Just a little.
On the ensuing play, Jarron Collins lofted up a pass
from within the key for the junior center Mark Seaton.
who was racing in from the right side of the key. The pass
appeared too high, but Seaton skied up and threw down
the dunk, bringing the capacity crowd to its feet.
With 4:27 to go, it was senior guard Khamba
Tshionyi's turn. He lofted an alley-oop from 18 feet out,
and Seaton once again jammed the ball through the
hoop.
"We thought anything could happen in a basketball
game," said Trojan head coach Henry Bibby. "But they
took control from the very beginning. Everybody was in
their rhythm. Everything was going well for them
tonight. They're as tough as any team we've played."

Guards Arthur Lee and Kris Weems led the Cardinal
with 15 points apiece. The two shot a combined 50 percent
(11 for 22) from the field and hit S of 12 trey attempts.
The Cardinal defense also had one of its best games
this season, collecting eight blocks, eight steals and lh
forced turnovers, while allowing the Trojans to get onl\
five assists.
"We came out and played hard from the start."
Weems said. "We played great defense as we've done the
whole season. ITiey were a little undermanned inside.
That's makes my job. Art s job and everybody's job on the
perimeter easier."
