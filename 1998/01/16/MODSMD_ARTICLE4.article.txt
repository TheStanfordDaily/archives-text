## SC swarmed, UCLA is next 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
The last time the men's basket
ball team started 14-0, Hank
Luisetti and his fellow Indians saw
their perfect record snapped bv
USC. 42-39.
Either history didn't repeat it
self or the Stanford basketball pro
gram was still extremely bitter
about that loss.
The No. 7 Cardinal (154). 4-0
Pacific 10 Conference) used most
of their 99-62 romp over the Tro
jans last night at Maples Pavilion
to rest their starting lineup for to
morrow's showdown against No. N
UCLA.
Along with recording the
school's best start in history, the
Cardinal also won its record 19th
straight at Maples and tied the
school mark for most three-point
ers made in one game at 15.
And with Wednesday's Mars
land victory over North Carolina,
the Cardinal's 15-game winning
streak is now the longest in the na

tion.
The smaller Troy team never
stood a chance against a Cardinal
lineup that runs both tall and deep.
Bv halftime. Stanford held a 27-11
rebounding advantage and had
pulled down 14 offensive re
bounds.
Six Cardinal players ended up
scoring in double figures while ju
nior forward Peter Sauer finished
with nine.
"We had a tremendous advan
tage on the boards." said Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery.
"You're able to get more shots
with those second-shot opportuni
ties."
In all. the Cardinal offense had
22 rebounds. CSC could only get
2X rebounds total.
Senior power forward Pete Van
Elswvk had his best night so far
this season with his first-ever dou
ble-double. He scored a career
high 14 points and tied his best re
bounding performance with 12
