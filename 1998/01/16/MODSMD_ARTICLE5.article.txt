cient Eskimo — ivory carv ings.
Most of the collection's pieces
were created between 1X75 and 1945.

Okvik carvings were made about

1989.
"Many collectors feel they are
temporary custodians of the works."
Ruth Franklin said " We're verv
pleased to see material being so
warmly welcomed. I hope the rest of
the Stanford community has a
chance to see it and get as much ap

quality artwork has taken them to
dealers in San Francisco, New York,
Los Angeles, Paris and Brussels.

faculty in many disciplines.

and Sciences John Shoven in a state
ment. "We are deeply grateful to the
Franklins for their continued gen
