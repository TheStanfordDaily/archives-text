# STS returns to old level of popularity

Despite its near demise in
and its ongoing lack of a full-time di
rector. student interest in the Pro
gram in Science. Technology and
Society has returned to its tradition
al high level.
This past Tuesday, the STS Stu
dent Association held a meeting for
prospective majors with speeches
hv Ron Ho. ("lass of w ho earned
his bachelor's in Values. Technolo
gy. Science and Society, the precur
sor of the current program, and pro
gram chair Robert McGinn, a priv
lessor of industrial engineering.
The purpose of the meeting, in
addition to providing information
for students who were interested in
possibly pursuing studies in the pro
gram. was also to let the campus at
large know that the STS major is
alive, after nearly being terminated
two years ago.
In the fall of l l *** the School of
Humanities and Sciences decided,
rather than ending the program, to
find a professor to head it and pro
vide him or her with a tenure-track
billet in a department.
Rather than focus on the past,
the meeting focused on the future of
the program Although the search

for a full-time tenure track profes
sor is still going on. McGinn said. "1
have confidence that (the search
committee] will succeed in appoint
ing an excellent senior scholar to
this new billet."
Present at the meeting were cur
rent majors in order to provide
more information and a first-person
perspective on the major Many of
the current majors participate in the
STS peer advising program, a new
support program.
The peer advising program was
formed about the same time that the
STS Student Association came to
being when STS faced hard times,
according to Ben Sussman. a senior
majoring in STS.
Andrew Nelson, another senior,
said the main purpose of the new
peer advising program is "to give
students the opportunity to ask
questions in perhaps less intimidat
ing an atmosphere. It is also a
chance to speak with a person who
has a different perspective on STS."
The meeting also emphasized
the flexibility and interdisciplinary
nature of the STS program as its
strengths "Where most techie ma
jors know how to do something.
STS allows you to not only learn the
how. hut the question 'why?' The
question of why is most fundamental
in technology, the how can he deter
mined later." said Nelson.
Ho, who spoke of the value of his
dual bachelor's in VTSS and electri
cal engineering said. "You get to
work with great faculty on campus
who are willing to step outside tradi
tional academic circles."
McGinn also said there is an em
phasis on the development of critical
and analytical skills. "The professors
who teach in STS aren't required to.
hut do st) out of love and commit
ment lor the subject matter. Very
few things are ruled out by being an
STS major, and very few doors are
closed to you."
Although the program was al
most abolished only two years ago.
there are at the moment about 20 se

niors and 20 sophomores who are
STS majors, but only around live ju
niors who are STS majors, on ac
count of a period in 19% when stu
dents were not permitted to declare
STS as their major.
McGinn felt that saying there was
a dearth of dedicated faculty in S I'S
when it faced extinction was mis
leading, since the requirements at
the time were for six professors who
would be spending at least half of
their time in S I S. which he said was
virtually impossible given the avail
able resources and money at that
point.
According to McGinn, enroll
ment in S I'S 101, the introductory
STS course, has jumped to 93 last
quarter from 72 students the last
time it had been taught.
"The main thing is. the momen
tum [for STS] has been reignited,"
said McGinn. The department now
has a core faculty to sustain the de
partment. he added.
