Looking for Jessa
Hi Jessa,
I hope you remember me. We met and danced at Fanny & Alexander's
on December 11th just before you left for break. You were with
Kimberly and Sarah. We're both philosophy students—you studied
modern and I studied ancient Greek. We saw each other again
outside. I sat beside you on the sidewalk. When you and Kimberly
got up to go back inside, you helped me to my feet. That action
demonstrating a wonderful mix of kindness and strength thoroughly
impressed me. I'd very much like to see you again.
Sincerely,
Ben (403) 749-0451
