What to Do
Depression is not a sign of
laziness, weakness, or a bad
attitude. It is a common psycho
biological condition in human
beings, so don't criticize your
self for it.
One in five Americans is
affected by depression some
time in their life. Recognize the
signs and get help early; you'll
save yourself a lot of needless
suffering.
■ If you think you'n 1 depressed,
tune in to your feelings, and
monitor them
■ If you sense that something
is "not right," pay attention
to it
■ Get professional help
■ Accept the depression while
you take steps to treat it,
and don't feel ashamed
because of it
■ Don't struggle alone: reach
out to friends, family, and
others you trust
■ Stay active; don't give in to
the urge to remain in bed for
hours
■ Try to remain current with
your work - getting behind
can add to your depression
■ Write down your academic
and social accomplishments
■ List the times you felt happy
■ Do things that you can enjoy
■ Don't use alcohol or drugs
as a means of self-medi
cating - it's easy to develop
a dependence on them
when you are trying to
make yourself feel better
■ Keep phone numbers handy;
call someone when you feel
down
■ If you can't reach someone
or otherwise feel frustrated
on the phone, hang up and
call someone else
■ Consider calling The Bridge,
the on-call person at CAPS,
or the suicide hot line - just
be sure to keep at it - help is
available
■ If medication is prescribed,
take it - it will help to
restore your energy, and
increase your motivation
■ If you think someone else is
depressed, say so openly
■ If you are depressed, be
patient with yourself -
healing takes the time it
takes
Depression is one of the most
treatable conditions. When you
are less depressed, your rela
tionships and your grades will
improve, and you'll deal more
effectively with day-to-day
stresses. So if you suspect you
may be suffering from depres
sion, get help now Q
