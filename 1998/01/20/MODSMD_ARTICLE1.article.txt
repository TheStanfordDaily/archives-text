Sen. Barbara Boxer called lor
investing in the future through
funds for education and health
care in a town hall meeting Satur
day at Palo Alto High School.
Along with spending, however,
the California Democrat, who is
up for re-election this year,
stressed fiscal responsibility.
Her statement of "Let's not
spend what we don't have"
brought cheers from the auditori
um. packed with a mostly middle
aged crowd.
"Let's make investments that
pay off." Boxer said. "Head Start
pays tenfold. Health research pays
off. Better transportation pavs
off."
Her promise to push for intelli
gent government spending
echoed through her l()-minute
opening speech.
"When I was sworn in five
years ago, I was nervous in my
heart for the California econo
my," Boxer said. "So I joined the
Budget Committee and the Com
mittee tm Environment and Pub
lic Works, and now I'm on I he Ap
propriations Committee."
In her speech. Boxer h >wed
that she understands fiscal respon
sibility. said Stanford Democrats


Justin Milts — Daily
Sen. Barbara Boxer speaks at Palo Alto High School Saturday on the need for constructive government spending.
President Rafael Nendel-Flores. a ju
nior.
"Boxer is normally portrayed as a
liberal," Nendel-Flores said. "But
here she said she doesn't just want to
spend."
Boxer also noted her introduction
in the Senate of the After-School Ed
ucation and Safety Act. a program
that keeps children in after-school
programs between 3 p.m. and p.m.,
the hours when juvenile crime is
highest.
"Education has to be our No. 1
priority," Boxer said. "Kids must be
able to read by age 8, be able to plug
in a computer by 12 and go to college,
if they're eligible, at 18."
In response to a question from the
audience. Boxer also touched on the
need for campaign finance reform.
She supports the McCain-Feingold

Bill, which would limit individual
contributions to $1 ,(X)0 and organiza
tional contributions to $5 (KK).
"The system is broken and needs
to be fixed," Boxer said. "It's an invi
tation for people to come in and buy
a seat. It's a mess."
Boxer estimates that she will need
to raise $20 million to run for re-elec
tion this fall.
"It's the part of my job I hate the
most, getting on the phone and ask
ing people for money," she said. "But
then you may ask why I do it. 1 do it
because it I didn't, I couldn't get into
office to make the decisions that real
ly matter."
Boxer also faced questions on im
migration. both into the United
States and into California itself.
"We must enforce immigration at
the borders and the workplace, not at
the schools and the hospitals," she
said.
She added, though, that Califor
nia — whose population she said will

increase by 18 million in the next 18
years — has to be prepared for its
new inhabitants.
"Dealing with the future doesn't
just mean keeping people out; it
means educating the people we have
here."
Boxer also voiced concerns over
the current health care system.
"We tried to put in place a compre
hensive health care system, and it
didn't go through." Boxer said. "Now
we're trying to fix it a piece at a time."
She stressed funding prevention
and research to lower medical costs.
"We need to do better in disease
prevention," she said. "Diseases like
cancer cost us so much money each
year."
Boxer, who was elected five years
ago without a majority, will face a stiff
challenge in this fall's election. Re
publicans who have already declared
include San Diego Mayor Susan
Golding, state Treasurer Matt Fong
and businessman Darrell Issa.
