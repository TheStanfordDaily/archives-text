# Gore allots civil rights funds
## 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) â€” In a ser
monlike speech from the Rev. Mar
tin Luther King Jr.'s former pulpit,
Vice President Al Gore marked
the King holiday yesterday by lay
ing out a plan to increase civil
rights spending by $86 million.
The Clinton administration will
propose spending $602 million to
enforce civil rights laws in the 1999
budget, up from $516 million this
year. Gore said.
"This is a priority. That is why it
received such an enormous
increase when almost everything
else in the budget is being
decreased," Gore said at Ebenezer
Baptist Church.
Elsewhere around the nation,
the slain civil rights leader was
remembered with prayers, service
projects, parades and, for the first

time, a halt in trading on U.S.
financial markets. King would have
turned 69 last week.
Gunfire at a King Day parade at
Baton Rouge. La., killed one per
son and wounded three young chil
dren. Police said the shooting was
the result of a fight and race was
not a factor.
Gore, speaking to a crowd that
included King's widow, adopted a
more animated, almost fire-and
brimstone style, compared with his
usual deliberate tone.
He used the Bible story of
Joseph being left for dead by his
brothers to address contemporary
violence.
"They felt disrespected because
their father regarded them differ
ently than Joseph," he said. "Why
do so many young men on the

streets with empty lives and loaded
guns slay their brothers? They tell
us time and again that their broth
ers disrespected them."
Gore said the proposed civil
rights spending boost will include a
$22 million increase for the Depart
ment of I lousing and Urban Devel
opment to fight housing discrimi
nation. Other changes would
strengthen investigations of police
brutality and enforcement of the
Americans With Disabilities Act.
Details will be included in the
budget submitted by President
Clinton next month.
King "would be proud to see
how much we have done to banish
discrimination from our laws. But 1
believe he would tell us that we still
have much to do in banishing dis
crimination from our hearts." Gore

said.
Coretta Scott King. King'
widow, said before the speech th;i
any new federal effort to improv
race relations is a step in the righ
direction.
"Whatever initiatives that ar
going to lead toward the progres
for all people, especially fo
African Americans and minorities
it will he good." she said.
The service was one of hundred;
of events around the country hon
oring King three decades after his
assassination in Memphis. Tenn.
on April 4. I%K.
In Washington. Clinton joined
members of Ameri( "orps and com
munity volunteers to repair and
paint classrooms at the District of
Columbia's ( ardo/o High School
as a Kinti Day service project.
