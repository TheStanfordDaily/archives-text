LONDON (AP) — With the
peace process strained by three
killings in two days, the IRA-allied
Sinn Fein party promised yesterday
to stay in the talks despite its
unhappiness with a settlement pro
posed by the British and Irish gov
ernments.
"Sinn Fein isn't going to with
draw from the talks under any cir
cumstances," Martin McGuinness,
the party's chief negotiator, said
after a delegation led by party Pres
ident Gerry Adams met with
British Prime Minister l onv Blair

in London.
The meeting came hours after a
Protestant shopkeeper was slain by
an Irish Republican Army splinter
group in Northern Ireland, and a
day after a pro-British group from
the Protestant side murdered a
Catholic man.
The bloodshed continued after
the London talks, when the
Catholic manager of a taxi compa
ny in south Belfast was fatally
wounded by one or two unknown
gunmen. The victim was identified
as Larrv Brennan, 52. who man

aged Enterprise Taxi. The firm had
a religiously mixed staff and was
based in a Protestant area, and had
not previously been targeted.
Police said Brennan was shot
four times, and died in a hospital.
Militants trying to sabotage the
peace process have killed seven
people since Dec. 27.
The peace talks resumed yester
day with eight parties, including
Sinn Fein, discussing a proposed
legislature for Northern Ireland,
one of the components of the
British-Irish proposal.
