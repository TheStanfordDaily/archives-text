No human cloning
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Food and Drug Administration
has a warning for the Chicagc
physicist who wants to clone a
human: The agency will shut dov\ r
anyone who tries without its per
mission.
Richard Seed's cloning plan
have sparked a public outcry and ;
race by Congress and more than ;
dozen states to ban cloning.
With the FDA filling what crit
ics had called a regulators vacu
um. scientists say lawmakers

should take more time to ensure
vaguely worded anti-cloning bills
don't also ban lifesaving medical
research.
"It's been a public and media
assumption that there is nothing
on the books that would even slow
or stop Dr. Seed." said Carl Feld
baumofthe Biotechnology Indus
try Organization, which repre
sents biotechnologists involved in
cloning research.
FDA investigators plan to
make clear to Seed that federal
regulations require that he file
for FDA approval to even
attempt a cloning — and having
permission granted is highly
unlikely.
