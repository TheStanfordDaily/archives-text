Boalt measure recognizes
the need for a concrete and
united challenge to Prop 209

THE EFFORTS OF students at UC-
Berkeley's Boalt Law School and of
students at twenty-five other state
wide universities to get an Equal Education
()pportunity Initiative on the November
IWB ballot should be commended.
Such an amendment, if passed, would
reverse the limitations on educational
access stipulated by both Proposition 209
and the UC Board of Regents' July 1995
decision to entl race and gender preferences
in the UC system.
In recent months. Boalt Law School has
gained national attention because it experi
enced a 90% drop in minority students in
the first year that the July 1995 decision
took effect. Only 14 Afro-Americans were
admitted to Boalt Law School last year in
comparison to an average of X7 per year
during the preceding decade. There are no
Native-American students in the class and
the numbers of Latino/Hispanic-American
students and Asian-American students
have fallen as well.
But more importantly the amendment
proposed by the Boalt Law students would
address issues of educational access at all
stages of educational development in a
state with a history of educational inequali
ty. 11 would also stop the recent migration
of ( alifornia's qualified minority students,
concerned either about their ability to be
admitted to schools here and/or the envi
.onment in a school with a small number of
minority students, to schools in other states.

The amendment would allow "the eco
nomic background, race, sex, ethnicity, and
nation origin of qualified individuals" to be
considered: in other words an applicant's
entire profile. In order to get the initiative
on November's ballot, state-wide organiz
ers need to gather approximately NOO.OOO
signatures from registered California voters
by April 15th.
It is refreshing to see students taking an
active role in trying to reverse Proposition
209 rather than just bemoaning the situa
tion and citing dismal statistics. They have
recognized that University administrators
are not paying attention to the ramifica
tions of these measures and are instead tak
ing matters into their own hands.
The measure is an effective way of
bringing together affirmative action battles
at Boalt and other schools within the UC
system and will hopefully give them and us
the united strength to take on this task.
Moreover, in solely attacking the issue of
educational opportunity, they are taking
on a narrow but important aspect of the
209 legislation - an aspect of the law which
the general population may be more recep
tive to overturning.
Although Stanford, as a private institu
tion. is not bound by Prop 209 it suffers
indirectly from the perception that Califor
nia is not as welcoming to minority students
as are other states.
We believe that the Boalt Law students'
cause is worthy and that concerned Stanford
students who enjoy the diversity of the Stan
ford community should join the Boalt stu
dents and students across the state in fight
ing for this ballot measure. So sign those
petitions and look out for ways that you can
help promote this cause in the coming
months.
