## Games of philosophy and Fifth Ave. 
### 
I PICK UP the paper
towel, and noting that
it is only loosely crum
pled, I tell myself to throw
it a little harder so that it
might reach the waste bas
ket. 1 shoot, I miss. Too
hard.

Determined to make this shot (yeah, call
it aimless stupidity). 1 pick up the towel
from the ground and go back to the shoot
ing point. This time, I tell myself to not
think and to do instead as Nike says. Yeah:
".lust do it!" (Or. 1 guess 1 should say. "as
Nike used to say" given that Nike has
dropped their ingenious slogan for a better
one: "I can!")
Not thinking and just doing. 1 fly (or
stumble) through the air and shoot for my
target. Too short. Hmm. maybe I should
have thought to throw it a little harder after
all.
Being wrapped up in my foolish little
game, I decide to give the shot one more
try. This time, I tell myself not to think too
much — but to nonetheless, somehow mix
in a little thought with a little bit of just
doing-it. I jump. I shoot, I make it. Nothing
but the center of the waste basket.
Why did I just spend time on this trivial
story? It makes an important point — one
about philosophy.
And I'm not just thinking about the
detached philosophy that is currently going
on in the minds of people in the "Philoso
phy" department or the cheesy fluff in that
book on Oprah that sits on your mom's cof
fee table.
What I'm thinking about is the kind of
philosophizing that is a fundamental part of
any daily human life.

What the hell do I have in mind? And
how am I going to express it? Two excellent
questions, particularly because I often think
about them only to find myself rambling.
Hut I'll give it a shot.
Regardless of what one calls it. everyone
possesses some kind of personal philosophy
or attitude toward daily life. Nothing new.
Hut it is quite common to overlook the
question of how one should change a per
sonal perspective, if at all.
1 suppose that one could say that this is
an issue on my mind because, by nature. I
tend to reflect quite a bit about almost any
thing. And so. 1 have a sense of what it's like
to sometimes think or analyze a bit too
much. It's not uncommon for me to over or
undershoot the waste basket.
Thus my complaint about a lot of what is
called "philosophy." That is. in one sense,
there exists a basic similarity between some
philosophers and my occasional tendency to
over-reflect, in that both seem to be too
detached from the experience of being
human.
Frequently, they are both a part of an
empty game. They are in need of a form of
philosophy that does not strive so hard for
"facts" that it breaks down or objectifies the
entire subject, rather than engaging with the
subject.
To help illustrate the above vague state
ments. consider an extreme example of a
detached and lifeless game: New York
City's Fifth Avenue.
Now. there's not much on Fifth Ave. that
is concerned with philosophy or reflection.
Hut there nonetheless appears to be some
kind of fundamental similarity between it
and many forms of philosophy as they share
that game-like quality.

For instance, many lifestyles on Fifth
Ave. revolve around concerns such as the
rarity and price of the dead animal on one's
hack. Ah. the fruits of life.
Regardless of whether one is mentally
masturbating over Kant or paying five
grand for a suit to impress a business part
ner, one is missing the waste basket —
either by thinking too much or too little.
What, then, do we do to go beyond these
games of life? I'm not thinking about an
oscillation between reflection and "letting
yourself go" in order to satisfy different
realms of the self. For example, I don't
mean that going from church for thought to
Jim Beam for boundless liberation will free
one from those seemingly incessant and
hopeless games.
Instead, in moments when authentic
'philosophy' succeeds, somehow thought
and just-doing-it are fused with one anoth
er. And the struggle of finding one's per
sonally sought-out philosophy is what
makes such experiences possible ones.
However, we're not given any kind of
game plan or commandments for facing the
heart of this struggle. It requires that we
find ways to reject surface games and to see
what's beneath — something which cannot
be objectified or described, but instead,
experienced.
Alternatively, we can always spend life
chasing cute, lurry animals with a shotgun in
hand.

Jon Servaiies, a December graduate in
chemical engineering, insists that the game
of shooting a paper towel into a waste bas
ket is not to be confused with the detached
games of life.
