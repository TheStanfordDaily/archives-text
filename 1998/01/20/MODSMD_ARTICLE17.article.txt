Jesus jokes aren V funny
On Jan. 16, your issue of the Daily had
a cartoon labeled " This just in from Golgo
tha." Occasionally, in previous issues, I
have also seen other cartoons or "humor
ous" pieces printed which mock Jesus
Christ.
1 find it disturbing that the Daily would
print these pieces. Jesus Christ, and what
He did on earth (including His death at
Golgotha), touch the most sacred and ten
der emotions I have.
I know Him. and I know that He has
given me more and suffered more for me
than any other being, and I consider Him
mv dearest friend as well as Lord anil Sav

ior. Therefore, it hurts me to see Him
mocked, and see His greatest work derid
ed.
Furthermore. I know I am not alone in
this sentiment, hut that a significant por
tion of the readers of the Daily share my
feelings about Jesus Christ.
It is unfortunate that the Daily would
print something that disturbs a large part
of the Stanford community.
I like to think that these pieces were not
submitted maliciously. I believe that the
author does not have the same feelings for
Christ that I do. and does not understand. I
hope the author only wanted to make peo
ple laugh, which pursuit I heartily approve
of (the comics is the only section I normal
ly read in most papers).

I am not expecting everyone in the
Stanford community to share my feelings
for Christ, I only ask that they respect my
feelings for Christ. This is what community
is about, understanding and respecting
other's beliefs.
The Daily can and should play an
important role within that community. So I
ask. let us look to other topics for our
humor, topics that will not touch such ten
der areas for anyone.
I'm certain that with such a bright and
talented community as ours, we can have
fun and find humor without hurting any
one within our community.
