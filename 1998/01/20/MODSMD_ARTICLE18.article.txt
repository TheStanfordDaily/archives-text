# Anything for the kids
## Garry Grundy Roe v. Wade: the immaculate misconception 
### 
I WAS PRO-CHOICE all through high
school, arguing religiously that it was a
woman's decision whether or not she
wanted to have her baby; I felt that it was
not the right of the government — and cer
tainly not my right — to meddle in the most
private affairs of individuals. I thought: 'So
what if I think it's a life; it simply is not my
place to push my views upon other people.'
I'd argue: if you don't like abortion, then
don't get one.'
I'm proud to say that I no longer think
this way.
In fact, it was when I encountered the
idea of abortion in my own family that I
mustered the courage to jettison the com
placent. individually obsessed ideology of
the pro-choice movement; I knew that
those collection of cells were indeed a
human life, making it impossible for me to
sit idle when the law still permitted people
to siphon away every ounce of vitality from
that cluster of highly developed cells: a
murder was indeed being committed.
And I know that the majority of Amer
ica's consciences know that this cluster of
cells is certainly a human life. If not, whv is

it when a drunk driver slams into the car of
a pregnant woman, he is murdering, I
mean, destroying the vivacity of that clus
ter of cells'? Why are we so outraged? Or
why do we become infuriated with preg
nant women who do harm to their bodies
through drinking, smoking and drug
abuse?
Our outrage is indicative of something
most profound: the American conscience
recognizes that those cells are indeed a life.
And what if you don't believe it's a life or
are unsure? Would it not be better to be on
the safe side and assume that it is rather
than to risk having bloodied hands?
All this talk of a woman's right to choose
that her body is hers to do with as she
pleases — all of this doesn't amount to a hill
of beans when it comes to preserving an
innocent life.
This is why, 25 years after Roe v. Wade,
it is incumbent on all Americans to defend
those innocent children who continue to be
murdered lor the sake of a 'woman's right
to choose.' She has absolutely no rights
over her body when it comes to taking the
life of another individual — outside or

inside of her body.
Yet pro-choice advocates insist that
those cluster of cells are an extension of a
woman's being — her body — and thus her
property in which the government should
certainly have no say over. Let me say that
a similar argument was made almost a cen
tury and a half ago: people in the Southern
I Inited States claimed that it was their right
to own slaves — that these slaves (not
wholly acknowledged as real people) were
extensions of the slave owners' right to pri
vate property — and that neither govern
ment nor other individuals could deprive
them of their right to own slaves. Slave
owners and those not courageous enough
to combat this horrible black mark on the
history of America would boom: "You
don't like slavery, then don't own a slave.'
If only it were that easy.
Things have changed very little in Amer
ican history over the past 150 years. Pro
choice advocates are the slave owners of
the 21st century — claiming to be progres
sive, but their blind medievalism makes
them incapable of seeing the savage nature
of the crime they are committing toward

another human being. To pacify their con
sciences — all because they deem it better
their child die then struggle — pro-choice
advocates call the child merely a fetus or
liken the act of abortion to a medical pro
cedure, saying simply that a collection of
cells has been removed. Yet how many
medical procedures' require months of
counseling in order to mitigate the psycho
logical trauma that ensues from this diffi
cult decision when in the smithy of their
souls, they, like the slave owners, know
what they do is criminal?
This simple fact can explain the chang
ing vein of our U.S. Supreme Court. It is
the courageous men of this body who give
me hope that the atrocities of abortion will
soon come to an end. for they possess a
remarkable vision that isn't too different
than the vision which made slavery and seg
regation a thing of the past. Fven Jane Roe,
the woman who brought the historical Roe
v. Wade case to the Supreme Court 25
years ago this Thursday — even she has left
the dark ages of the pro-choice movement
and become a 21st century abolitionist,
defending those much smaller than us who

are incapable of defending themselves.
1 find it quite appropriate that the 25th
anniversary of this cowardly law falls at
the opposite end of a week honoring a
man so diametrically opposed to cow
ardice and mediocrity, Martin Luther
King Jr.; this day should inspire enough
courage in all Americans to combat the
inhumanity of abortion, for Dr. King rep
resented those whom many refused to
even recognize. His dream was one that
called on every American to set aside his
or her self-centered individualism and
stand as one people to end the persecution
of a group that could not speak for itself. I
beseech you to permit the words of Dr.
King to echo in your hearts; let the words
of Abraham Lincoln. C esar Chavez,
Mother Teresa — let all of their words
encourage us; let us imitate their mar
velous examples, and join the fight against
the horrible injustices of legalized infanti
cide.
With courage, we shall overcome.
