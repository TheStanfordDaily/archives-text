SUMMER TEACHING WITH UPWARD BOUND PROGRAM
Can you teach courses in science, math, english and social studies? Does an
optimal setting, including a small class size with teaching associates,
guaranteed attendance, and interaction with students outside of class in daily
tutorials sound appealing? The Upward Bound summer residential program
is designed to motivate and prepare high school students who are low-income
and potentially first generation college-bound to pursue higher education.
The summer program provides the Upward Bound students with a six-week
residential experience. While living at Stanford, they enroll in high school
level academic courses designed to help them get a headstart on the classes
they are enrolled to take in the fall. The dates of the summer program are June
22 - August 6, 1998 (includes one week of staff training). Job descriptions,
including position requirements, and applications are available at the
Upward Bound office in HAAS Center for Public Service, Room 212.
Applications are due March 13,1998 by s:oopm. Please contact Annazette
