# Students working to reverse Prop. 209
## Stanford group joins in effort to get affirmative action initiative on November ballot 
### Jaime Adame Contributing Writer 
Several Stanford students will be gath
ering signatures as part of .1 statewide ef
fort to place an amendment 011 the No
vember ballot that would reverse the ef
fects of Proposition 2(W on university ad
missions.
Titled the Equal Educational Oppor
tunity Initiative, the proposal drafted by a
group of students at IJC-Berkeley's Boalt

Law School reads: "In order to provide
equal opportunity, promote diversity and
combat discrimination 111 public educa
tion, the state may consider the economic
background, race. sex. ethnicity and na
tional origin of qualified individuals."
About 40 Stanford students attended
an informational meeting, sponsored by
the gi< up Students for Educational Op
portunity, on Friday to learn about the ini
tiative — a response to the anti-affirma
tive action Prop. 2(W. passed in November

lWb.
The new initiative was filed with the
state attorney general last November. In
order for the proposal to be on the ballot
this November, the group needs about a
million signatures by late April.
"Our goal is ft>r the mid-peninsula area
to get 120.000 signatures." said Stanford
law student Richard Mosier, a member of
SEO. which already has chapters at about
25 universities. He said he hopes to get
280 volunteers to work two hours per

week collecting signatures at locations
such as White Pla/a and Andronieo's
Market.
At Friday's meeting. tv\o I'("-Berke
ley law students. Dawn Mann and L.D.
Louis, spoke about the proposed amend
ment.
According to Mann, the proposal can
survive legal scrutiny if passed. The pro
posal has a "severability clause" which
states that if any of the three key
phrases — "equal opportunity,"
"promote diversity" or "combat dis
crimination" — is struck down, the
amendment will still stand.
The proposal has drawn support
from various sources, including the
National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People and
the National Lawyers Guild.
Prop. 209, which passed with 54
percent of the vote, reads. "The state
shall not discriminate against, or
grant preferential treatment to, any
individual or group on the basis of
race, sex. color ethnicity or national
origin in the operation of public em
ployment. public education, or pub
lic contracting."
Since the passage of Prop. 209
and a similar UC-Regents decision,
between 1996 and 1997 Berkeley's
Boalt Law School has seen the num
ber of African-American students in
its freshman class drop from 23 to
one and the number of Latinos drop
from 20 to 14. Native American en
rollment decreased from four to
zero. In the five UC business schools.
Latino first-year enrollment
dropped from 54 to 25. while the

number of black students decreased
from 27 to 20.
"The only way to bring back the
numbers is to change the constitu
tion," said Louis.
Another issue discussed on Fri
day was the "English for the Chil
dren" initiative, co-authored by
Palo Alto software millionaire Ron
Unz, which would severely limit
bilingual education in public
schools.
"Because a lot of people are for
[ The pro-affirmative action initia
tive) and against the Unz initiative,
there is no reason not to work to
gether," said Mosier, adding that
many volunteers will be registering
voters and informing them of the
I In/, initiative as they collect signa
tures.
"It's up to us to educate our fami
lies and peers," said senior Cindy
Urquidez.
A protest is scheduled for today
from 3:30 p.m. t05:30p.m. in front of
Unz's business. Wall Street Analyt
ics, at 2370 Watson Court, Palo Alto.
The I Jnz proposal goes on the ballot
in June.
