## Card smokes UCLA in jumping joint 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
It was no Massacre at Maples, but
it was more than enough for the
men's basketball team.
No. 9 UCLA (13-3,4-2 Pacific 10
Conference) came into Maples
Pavilion Saturday as the No. 5 Car
dinal's (16-0, 5-0) first top-10 oppo
nent of the season, and Mike Mont
gomery's squad showed that it is for
real with a 93-80 victory.
Montgomery wouldn't say it him
self, but the entire nation was watch
ing this game as the biggest test of
the season for his players.
If it was, they passed with flying
colors. The Cardinal got the key per
formances from all of its players
when it needed them to step up the
most.
"They're playing great basket
ball," Montgomery said. "They're
playing great together. I don't know
if I've ever had a team whose atti
tude has been any better about feel
ing good about guys off the bench
helping."
After Bruin freshman point
guard Baron Davis hit two consecu
tive layups to give his team a quick 4-
0 lead, the Cardinal took control and
displayed all the talent that has
thrust them from Pac-10 contender
to national powerhouse.

The win extends the nation's
longest win streak to 16 games for
the Cardinal and the team's Maples'
winning streak to 20. It also helped
push the Cardinal to their highest
ranKing in the Associated Press poll
since 1%2.

ford 93, UCLA 80

"We knew how good we were,"
said junior forward Peter Sauer,
who finished with a team-high 19
points and hit 5 of 6 from downtown.
"We knew we deserved to be
ranked in the top 10, we fell that's
the caliber of team we were. We
know it would take beating a team
like UCLA to get that respect. I
think we've gotten it today if we
haven't gotten it yet."
Tim Young hit a shot from the
top of the key that triggered a 9-0
run by the Cardinal, who would
never trail again. A three-pointer by
Bruin forward Kris Johnson and an
other layup from Davis tied the
score almost seven minutes into the
game, but the Cardinal took over
the rest of the half.
Sophomore forward Ryan
Mendez hit a trey to put the Cardi
nal up for good and the offensive on

slaught that followed had the capac
ity crowd frenzied with the thought
of a repeat of last year's 109-61 dis
mantling of the Bruins.
Cardinal junior point guard
Arthur Lee grabbed his second foul
of the game with 12 minutes, 3 sec
onds left in the half and went to the
bench.
Freshman Mike McDonald
stepped in and had his biggest game
of the season, playing the rest of the
half almost flawlessly. His seven
points, four assists and zero
turnovers were key in helping the
Cardinal run to an 18-point halftime
lead.
But the controlling factor in the
half was the presence of center Tim
Young. He fell one rebound shy of a
double-double in the first half alone,
adding 10 points and two assists.
"It showed we're capable of play
ing against a top-10 team," Young
said. "And the scary thing is I think
we're capable of playing a lot better
than we did today. I think we let it
slip in the second half and we lost
our concentration."
His defense, along with that of
the rest of the Cardinal frontline,
helped keep UCLA senior forward
J R. Henderson and junior center
Jelani McCoy out of the paint and
kept the two to a combined 17 points
and seven rebounds in the half.

And with the Bruin defense pre
occupied with the Cardinal post
men, Stanford's backcourt took lull
advantage, hitting 7-of-15 from be
hind the arc in the half
Hut just as it looked like the ( ar
dinal might win running away again.
UCLA stormed back in a big way.
The Bruins used a full-court
press to help start a comeback that
saw them dominate the inside game.
Young picked up his third and
fourth fouls in the span of 16 sec
onds to send him to the bench with
17:44 to play. The Bruins quickly
capitalized on his absence.
Johnson finished with a game
high 20 points and added ten re
bounds. McCoy also had a double
double for the Bruins with 19 points
and 12 boards.
UCLA attacked the glass and
clamped down on defense for a 24-7
run to bring them to within one
point with 12:39 left in the game.
The Cardinal didn't help its own
cause, missing all six of its free
throws during that time.
After UCLA forward Toby Bai
ley missed a wild layup for the lead.
Lee took control.
With the ball at the top of the
key. Lee pulled up for a three-point
er that finally stopped the Bruins.

Despite being plagued by foul trouble, junior center Tim Young pro
vided a key prescence that helped control UCLA s athletic frontline
After Bailey threw the ball away on
the next possession, Lee came off of
a screen and hit another one from
downtown to give the Cardinal a
seven-point lead with 11:35 left.
Lee's treys were the crucial front
end of a 12-1 run that helped the
Cardinal regain control of the game.
"Regardless of our big lead we
knew they weren't just going to lie
down and die," Lee said. "1 just told
the guys, 'Hey, we've got to suck it
up and play. They got back in the
game but this is our game to win.
We're the better team out here.
We're at home to make it all the bet
ter.'"
The Bruins were able to battle
back to within two points on a three
point play by Johnson, but Hender
son and Davis fouled out within two

minutes of each other and Bruin
coach Steve Lavin, who tends to rely
on a six-man rotation, didn't have
the bench to help his team recover.
Lee hit another three-pointer to
give the Cardinal a 79-71 lead with
3:58 left and the Bruins could get no
closer than to within six points after
that.
"We saw today that Stanford de
serves their ranking." Lavin said.
"They're a tremendous basketball
team with great size, great perime
ter players, great perimeter quick
ness and tremendous three-point
shooting."
"That's why their undefeated,
that's why they've won twenty
straight here [at Maples). That's
why they're in the top 10."
Those three treys were Lee's
only field goals of the entire game
and he hit an unimpressive 3 of 13,
but no shots were more critical for
the team. He finished with 17 points

and three assists.
The Cardinal hit 14 of 2ft three
pointers total, falling one shy of the
school record they set in last year's
contest against the Bruins at
Maples and tied last Thursday
against USC.
The accurate outside shooting
helped offset UCLA's 30 second
half rebounds. The Bruins became
only the second team to outrebound
the Cardinal this season as they
pulled down 48 total compared to
Stanford's 36.
"In the second half, UCLA came
out and really took it to us," Mont
gomery said. "They were really ag
gressive, dominated us on the
boards which we didn't really ex
pect. They went hard to their inside
people and we were running out of
options to try to defend. Three point
field goals were the key for us here,
because we got out rebounded fairly
substantially."
