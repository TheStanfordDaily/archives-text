# Lee's threes key to holding off big Bruin run
## Foul trouble inside prompts second-half clutch outside shooting 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Qui/ the Dick Vitales, the Billy Pack
ers and the Jim Nantzes of the nation be
fore Saturday's basketball game and
they'd probably say Stanford's success
comes from its physical inside play and
height.
Not after this week. Maples Pavilion is
now three-point country.
After its inside game all but failed dur
ing the second half of Saturday's national
ly-televised game against UCLA, the Car
dinal turned to its three point shooters,
who, as expected, delivered.
Arthur Lee and Peter Sauer hit clutch
three pointers as Stanford denied IJCI .A's
physical comeback and won 93-80.
It was Lee who brought the Cardinal's
shooting out of the doldrums. After seeing
its lead shrink from 18 to just one with

more than 12 minutes left in the game Lee
calmly ran up the court and — in true
Brevin Knight style — proceeded to bury a
Lhrecpointer from the top of the key.
After a UCLA turnover and a televi
sion timeout, Lee walked right to the same
place and. aided by a perfect screen, buried
another trey, bolstering the Cardinal lead
to seven.
"Last year, people thought it was just
Brevin Knight that was carrying this
team." UCLA coach Steve Lavin said
after the game in a cornucopia of unsolicit
ed compliments to Stanford's plav. coach
ing. future chances and pretty much any
thing.
A three-pointer by David Moseley and
some free throws by Pete Van Elswyk and
the Cardinal had regained a 12-point lead.
But the lead, like Nantz' voice on Sat
urday, was short lived. UCLA began a 10-
0 run to get back in the game, lo make

matters worse. Cardinal center Tim
Young fouled out with Stanford holding ;i
five-point lead.
Instead of going to the post. the Cardi
nal got good looks from beyond the arc.
and in less than a minute. Stanford had
racked up three three-pointers, two from
Sauer and one from Lee.
"We were nussing shots and missing
free throws." Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "The three-point shot realh
bailed us out."
After Sauer's three, the Cardinal need
ed only to sink its free throws to defeat the
Bruins.
When all was said and done, the C'ardi
nal shot 43 percent for the game but w as 53
percent from behind the arc. In the second
half. Stanford shot an astounding b3 per
cent from three-point land.
Yesterday's game is just one leg of th<.
three-point marathon the Cardinal ha

been running at Maples. After tying the
record for three pointers in a game on
Thursday against I SC — a record set last
year during the 109-bl shellacking of
I CI A Stanford hit 14 trevs on at
tempts.
Sauer in particular had a career dav. hit
ting fi\e of six threes, and tour of four free
throws for 19 points
"We knew we'd get open I*m and it
was just .1 matter of knocking them down
It was hard to walk oul of Saturday s
game without respecting the Cardinal s
depth in both its height and its long-dis
tance precision lhe national television ex
posure helped to garner three first place
votes between the Associated Press and
the I 'SA Today F.SPN polls
Stanford is ranked fifth in the AP poll,
the hichest ranking in school history.
"You can slop one player." I avin said
"but vou can't stop Stanford s team."

Kwesi Leggett — Daily
Sophomore swingman Ryan Mendez was only one
of many sharpshooters for the Cardinal, nailing two
of Stanford's 14 three-pointers on the afternoon.
