meet out we did great, especially in
our first two events." said head

couple of landings and on the floor
we missed a couple of tumbling
passes, both of which effected our
start values."

Murakami got the second best Ail-
Around score of 38.475 to Washing
ton's Tiffany Simpson (38.875). Her
floor routine, complete with synchro
nized clapping from the audience,
was executed extremely well and re
ceived a 9.8(X) from the judges. Her
bar routine was also excellent and she
received a 9.825.
"I was very impressed how the
team came together," Murakami
said. "We had g(Kxl routines and al
though we missed some passes on the
floor and there were some flukes, it's
the first meet and that's expected."
Also performing well for the Car
dinal was senior Amy Neil, who per

formed on the vault (9.525), the bars
(9300) and the beam (9.675) for the
Cardinal and senior co-captain Keri
Monahan who performed in three
events.
"Amy Neil really stepped up to
the plate as a senior and performed
strongly for us in three events," Cook
said.
Freshman Jenny Wilson did well
in her first collegiate meet and com
peted in all events for the Cardinal.
"I felt like I had a lot of support,
and I had a gcxxl time — although it is
very different from club gymnastics,"
Wilson said.
Although the freshman admitted
to being nervous it was hardly appar
ent in her routines and she looked
poised and experienced. Wilson per
formed especially well on the vault
(9.7(X)) and on the bars (9.475).

"It was a really fun meet especial
ly with all of the crowd support." Mu
rakami said.
Cook was also pleased with the
student section and their enthusiasm.
"The crowd really got into it which
helped us stay focused and connect
ed. I hope the students keep it up."
Cook said.
The team remained positive after
the meet and looked at their loss as
motivation for the rest of the season.
"The loss will get me fired up to
work harder in the gym." said sopho
more Kim Young who performed in
three events for Stanford.
"Overall I am happy but we know
we have a lot of work and improve
ment to do," Cook said. "It's all about
peaking at the right point in the sea
son — we didn't want to go out and
have our first meet be our best meet."
