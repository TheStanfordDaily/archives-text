# Back on track
## Stanford sweeps L.A. road trip 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Last night's game against
UCLA was almost a deja vu experience for the 13th
ranked Stanford women's basketball team.
Almost, except this one had a more favorable ending
for Cardinal fans.
One week ago yesterday No. 7 Arizona pulled out a
come-from-behind one-point victory on an answered
prayer at the buzzer. And midway through the second
half of Sunday's game, the similarities between the two
contests were unsettling.

■ FRIDAY'S RFSULT: Stanford I S( 55
■SI JNDAY'S RESI'I T: Stanford 75. CCI A7O

But this time Stanford (<X-5. 5-1 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) was clutch from the charity stripe, making all 14
free throws it attempted over the final b minutes. And if
IJCLA (9-6,4-2) had successfully gotten off a last second
shot on the final possession ol the game it wouldn't have
mattered as senior forward Vanessa Nygaard's two tree
throws with 3 seconds remaining iced the 75-70 win.
"We didn't want it to happen again." Nygaard said.
"It's very big mostly for our confidence. All the games
we've played so far where teams have made a run. we've
folded, and we didn't fold this time.'
After falling behind lb-10. Stanford went on an 11-0
run to take the lead and even pulled out to as much as a
12-point advantage with |ust over four minutes to pla>
in the first half. Despite shifting just 37 percent from
the field (27 percent from three-point land). Stanford
held a 39-30 lead at the break thanks to a 45-foot bank
shot from sophomore guard Milena Florcs at the
bu/zer.
Lite Cardinal was led by senior forwards Vanessa Ny
gaard and Kristin Folkl. Nygaard had 11 points and nine

rebounds, and Folkl added nine points and eight boards
But things weren't all ros\ tor Stanford.
The Bruins had cut the lead to six before Flores hit
the long shot and even though the Cardinal's field goal
percentage was slightly higher than I 'CLA's 31 percent,
Stanford's turnover and free throw problems were start
ing to resurface.
And they continued in the second half. Before the
final six minutes. Stanford was shifting around 60 per
cent from the line, and f-olkl was just two-of-six. As a
team the Cardinal already had 20 turnovers and had,
been outscored bv I 'CI A S.
"Free throws tor me were huge." Folkl said "At half
time that's what Tara told me I needed to locus on. I
thought that was important, and I thought everybody
finished their free throws and had we not it would havej
been an Arizona repeat
But with six minutes to go things did not look good lor
a Stanford win. A three-pointer from sophomore guard;
Melanic Pearson at the Mb mark nave the Bruins a 54-'
57 lead, their first since I2:4f> in the opening half. Van •
Derveer called a 20 second timeout but changed it to a>
full and was charged for both
1 he Cardinal emerged from the timeout and 112 olkl!
promptly drew the foul She then knocked down both!
free throws to tie the game. Stanford scored on its first'
three possession out of the timeout as Folkl pulled up forj
a 17-foot jumper and then nailed two more free thiows. J
" Fhey missed some free throws down the stretch, andj
we made some," \ an Derveer said "Different from Ari-j
zona. We also got some key boards, hit some kc\ shots.!
We were able to get the ball inside. And I thought!
Kristin was phenomenal She's just unhclicx able, she rt i
ally makes a big ditference for our team
But sophomore forward Maylana Martin and senior,
Aisha Veaslev made some big shots of their ■ vwn and thej
score went back and forth. After three ties Stanford,
took the lead for good on tw« more tree throws from Nv j
