# Sixth Man Club provides big boost for Stanford
## 
### Ben Hur Senior staff writer 
The sth ranked Stanford men's basket
ball team has not needed a lift very often this
season. On Saturday against IJCLA, it got
one from a source that can neither shrnt, re
bound, or pass.
It's name?
The Sixth Man Club.
Sure, juniors Arthur Lee, Peter Sauer,
and the rest of the Cardinal squad were re
sponsible for the 93-80 victory over the
ninth-ranked Bruins. But the rowdy fans in
the Stanford student section provided an es
sential boost.
"We feed off them a little bit," Sauer said.
"When UCLA made the run coming back,
that was a big deal having the crowd behind
us."
After squandering an IX-point lead in less
than eight minutes, UCLA senior Toby Bai
ley dunked to cut the Stanford lead to 58-57.
The Bruin bench went wild, and for an in
stant, the only thing that could be heard in
Maples was a UCLA chant from the visitors
section.

The Sixth Man Club refused to be out
done. Following a traveling call against se
nior Pete Van Elswyk, the Stanford faithful
asked for a defensive stop. After the Cardi
nal squad obliged, junior Arthur Lee
drained a three point basket, moving the
lead to 61-57.
As Maples Pavilion rocked, so did
UCLA's confidence. Bailey's errant pass on
the ensuing possession gave the ball back to
Stanford and ended the Bruin run.
During the TV timeout that followed, the
rest of the country finally had the opportuni
ty to see what the rest of Stanford and partic
ularly the Cardinal team has known all year.
"It's a substantial advantage," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said. "It helped us
when we were struggling. Our kids feel pret
ty good about playing at home."
With 11 minutes remaining and the Card
nursing a seven point advantage, sophomore
Ryan Mendez fouled Bruin senior J.R. Hen
derson, sending him to the free throw line for
two shots.
At this point, Lee asked for some help. As
he raised his arms in the air, the Sixth Man
Club offered a resounding response. The in

creased decibel level led to a Henderson
miss.
"You could tell that the players were de
pending on us," senior lan Phil Kim said.
"They turned to us for help, and we gave it to
them. l"hey were the ones that won the
game, hut we like to feel like we gave them a
little help when they needed it."
The Sixth Man Club is not a polite group,
and perhaps no team knows that quite like
the Bruins.
Stanford has 'dropped a lot of teams here
at Maples," UCLA coach Steve Lavin said.
"Maples is one of the toughest places to
play."
It was indeed at Maples Pavilion one year
ago where Lavin and the Bruins suffered its
biggest defeat in school history. This year,
the Cardinal faithful let the national TV au
dience know that it has quite a memory.
Some of the nicer signs read 'Stanford
1()9, UCLA 61. Welcome Back.'
Other signs were more personally direct
ed, one of which read 'How High is Jelani?'
referring to the suspension given to junior


Yeah, Brev, things aren't too bad back here .
Danielle Lurie — Daily
Jelani McCoy, for alleged marijuana
use. Other visuals included a sign
shaped like a bong, which read
'UCLA, going up in smoke.'
While Billy Packer and Jim Nance
speculated that the Sixth Man Club
was chanting 'Ca-ro-lina!' in refer
ence to Stanford being among one of
the nation's elite teams, the two CBS
announcers underestimated the cru

elty of Cardinal fans.
Instead, the Sixth Man Club was
yelling ma-ri-juana!' nearly every
time McCoy touched the ball.
Some other fans acting for the
camera included 'boxers' Heather
Crary, Jessica Valenzuela and Lind
say Welsh, who were determined to
K.O UCLA.' The three juniors were
decked out in boxing attire, amiplete
with gloves, boxing shorts, and capes.
"We have the outside punch, we
have a little jab. and a little hook
shot," Crary and Valenzuela said.

Okay, so maybe Stanford's out
standing three point shooting, depth,
and inside power has led to the 20-
game winning streak the Card has en
joyed at Maples. However, as the
Sixth Man Club has grown from a 30-
person eult four years ago to a 750-
head monster this season, so has the
dominance of the basketball team.
"The Sixth Man Club gets bigger
because the team gets better," junior
center Tim Young said. "But maybe
the team gets better because the Sixth
Man Club gets bigger."
