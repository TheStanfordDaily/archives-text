# Women of Troy trampled by stampeding Card
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — It wasn't
USC's fault.
The Women of Troy had nothing
to do with Stanford's one-point loss
to Arizona. They weren't the ones
who made the buzzer-heater to end
the Cardinal's Pacific 10 Conference
win streak. They just had the unfortu
nate luck of being the team to follow
that contest. And Stanford showed
no mercy, rolling to an 89-55 victory
in the Lyon Center Friday night.
"Stanford came out like I've never
seen them come out before," said
USCjunior guard Kristin Clark. "It's
probably not the best time to play
Stanford after a loss, but we didn't
come out and play like we should.
Stanford has some great post players,
but we have great post players too.
It's just they came out to play and we
didn't. They made some lobs, and the
help wasn't there. They finished the
plays, and we didn't."

Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said her squad didn't have
to make statements to anyone hut it
self, but when Stanford ran out to a
33-8 lead over the first 12 minutes of
the game you couldn't help but think
the Card was making a statement
one that was bolded. underlined, in
italics and with an exclamation
point.
Stanford (8-5, 5-1 Pac-10 after
Sunday's 75-70 win over UCLA) was
getting it done all over the court.
Shooting 63 percent from the field in
the first half, the Cardinal got 14
points from senior center Olympia
Scott and 12 from junior forward
Kristin Folkl as the Stanford guards
were able to lob to the post at will.
The Cardinal also had its transi
tion game firing on all cylinders.
Sophomore guard Milena Flores dis
tributed the ball for five assists in the
first half, as the beleaguered USC
team (7-8.2-4) had trouble hitting the
basket. At the break, junior guard
Kristin Clark was the only USC play

er with more than four points, leading
the Women of Troy with 10.
"Sometimes I think it's all about
momentum." Scott said. "We just
had to get that ball rolling. And we
know we can score, the game
(against Arizona) was 90-91. so scor
ing wasn't really the issue it was
about defense. It was a good defen
sive effort — that's how we got the
fast breaks going and got their spirits
down."
The second half was more of the
same as Stanford dominated inside
and pulled farther away from USC.
Two free throws from sophomore
guard Melody Peterson at the 8:24
mark gave the Card a 42-point lead,
its largest of the game.
The only disruptions in play after
that were from the referees. A tem
porary case of whistle-happiness
plagued the last five minutes of the
game, but that may have been in

use.
"I don't think our team is the type
that's going to get upset about a one
point game." VanDerveer said.
"People are smart enough to know
that we had a lot of opportunities to
win. And the important thing at
point in the season is to learn Uom it
and improve and I thought we looked
