# Humanities lectures set
## Eco, Derrida among guests invited as part of initiative 
### Bimal Shah Editorial staff 
World-renowned artists and humanists will soon he
making their way to campus as part of the new Presi
dential Lectures and Symposia in the Humanities and
Arts.
Among those who have accepted invitations are au
thors Isabel Allende and I Jmberto Eco. critics Harold
Bloom and Henry Louis Gates Jr. architect Peter
Eisenman. playwright Wole Soyinka. philosopher
Jacques Derrida and artists Christo and Jeanne-
Claude.
The lecture series, in addition toa $12-million initia
tive to add four new professorships in the humanities
and arts, was announced by University President Ger
hard Casper at his annual State of the University ad
dress in October.
The new programs are meant to transform the hu
manities into a "more visible and dynamic participant
in shaping, enriching and challenging the intellectual
agenda across the University." Casper said
Most of the guests will spend three days on campus.
During their stay, they typically will deliver a lecture,
participate in a panel discussion with faculty and stu
dents and attend a dinner with C'asper and other guests
during which they will discuss the role of the humani
ties and arts in higher education.
The visits are "meant to leave traces." according to
French and Italian Prof. Hans Gumbrecht, the director
of the series. Casper "really wants to spark discussion
that has impact on the humanities at Stanford," Gum
brecht explained. To meet this goal, organi/ers will
make sure the discussions stir up debate.
In addition, organi/ers hope the visits might spark
other more unpredictable changes. For instance, per
haps Christo will do a project on campus or the archi
tect Eisenman s visit will inspire a new building in his
style. Gumbrecht mused
The guests for the series were chosen through a
multi-step process that included input from the Uni
versity community. "Casper and I started this brain
storming... and that generated the original list," Gum
brecht said.
About 30 facult\ and students were then brought to
gether to come up with additional candidates. Finally ,
about 1.500 letters were sent out to faculty and gradu
ate students seeking their suggestions.
Around 3< * I suggestions were received representing

ford personally was one factor in the
high acceptance rate, he said.
Another purpose of the series is
to re-establish the foundations of the
humanities more generally. Most of
the disciplines in the humanities
have their roots in the early Nth
century, according to Gumbrecht.
They were founded under some spe
cific conditions, and their legitima
tions are not convincing anymore,
he said.
"We humanists have not come up
with any alternative and convincing
explanations for what [we're]
doing." Gumbrecht said, adding that
he hopes the series will help yield
some indication where the humani
ties and arts can go.
The money lor the series comes

an "enormously broad and wide
range" of interests, Gumbrecht said.
The University libraries provided
documentation on each of the candi
dates; however, he and Casper made
the final choice, Gumbrecht said.
In their selection, the pair sought
a "variety of cultures and disci
plines."
Each of the chosen speakers were
then sent a letter, explaining the pur
pose of the series and the specific
reason he or she had been invited.
Of the speakers chosen, only two
have not accepted the offer, an un
expectedly high yield rate, according
to Gumbrecht. The fact that the let-
