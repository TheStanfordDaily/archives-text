World-renowned artists and humanists will soon he
making their way to campus as part of the new Presi
dential Lectures and Symposia in the Humanities and
Arts.
Among those who have accepted invitations are au
thors Isabel Allende and I Jmberto Eco. critics Harold
Bloom and Henry Louis Gates Jr. architect Peter
Eisenman. playwright Wole Soyinka. philosopher
Jacques Derrida and artists Christo and Jeanne-
Claude.
The lecture series, in addition toa $12-million initia

The new programs are meant to transform the hu

in shaping, enriching and challenging the intellectual
agenda across the University." Casper said
Most of the guests will spend three days on campus.
During their stay, they typically will deliver a lecture,
participate in a panel discussion with faculty and stu
dents and attend a dinner with C'asper and other guests
during which they will discuss the role of the humani
ties and arts in higher education.
The visits are "meant to leave traces." according to
French and Italian Prof. Hans Gumbrecht, the director
of the series. Casper "really wants to spark discussion

brecht explained. To meet this goal, organi/ers will
make sure the discussions stir up debate.
In addition, organi/ers hope the visits might spark
other more unpredictable changes. For instance, per

brecht said.

about 1.500 letters were sent out to faculty and gradu
