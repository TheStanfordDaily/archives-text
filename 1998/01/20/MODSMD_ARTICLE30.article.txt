# Grapplers fall to Beavers, BYU
## 
### Evan Meagher Contributing writer 
The Stanford wrestling team en
tered this weekend 0-5. with tough
matches against Oregon State and
Brigham Young University up next.
I Jnfortunately, the team came away
winless in the two meets, extending
its seven dual meet losing streak.
Saturday's match against 1 Nth
ranked Oregon State was disappoint
ing. as Stanford could manage only
two victories. Freshman Jason Tal
bott won a major decision over
Beaver freshman Ryan Sugihara in
the 134-pound division, and senior
co-captain Scott Chapman over
whelmed senior Sanders Freed in the
177-pound division, but that was all
for the Cardinal in a 28-7 loss.
"I'm a little frustrated." said Stan
ford head coach Chris Horpel. "I
thought we were going to match up
well."
Perhaps most frustrating was the
team's inability to come away with
close matches. Stanford lost four

matches hy a total of seven points.
"We need to win those matches
that could go either way." Horpel
said. "We just didn't get the job
done." The team rebounded with a
strong showing against BYU, a team
coached by Mark Shultz. a former
Stanford assistant and WB4 Olympic
champion.

After weak showings in the first
three weight classes — Cardinal
grapplers lost major decisions in each
— and a tough loss in the 142-pound
division sophomore Warren
McPherson turned the meet around
with a victory in the 150-pound
weight class. Oregon State junior
Gary Sanderson fled the mat to avoid
takedowns, preserving a one-one tie

after two periods. McPherson at
tacked Sanderson relentlessly, finally
scoring a takedown for a 3-1 victory.
Juniors Doug Bardsley and Shane
Cross followed with nail biting one
point victories in the 158- and 167-
pound weight classes, respectively.
Cross, who wrestled in place of in
jured co-captain Jeff Grant, a senior,
scored a late escape en route to a 5-4
win.
"Cross really showed what he can
do." said freshman teammate
Kayvon Bina. "It was quite a show of
courage."
Chapman tcx)k apart sophomore
Corey Anderson in the 177-pound
division. 4-4 on the season. Anderson
managed only two escapes in an in
evitable 7-2 loss. Chapman sealed it
with a late takedown. Sophomore
Tim Kendall closed the meet with a 7-
4 victory in the 190-pound division.
Down 2-4 after two periods. Kendall
rallied against a tired Jason Johnson
to earn his first dual-meet win. Stan
ford forfeited the heavyweight divi
sion, losing the meet 21-15.
