■ SATURDAY'S RESULT: Stanford def. Ohio State
15-9,15-8,12-15,15-13

Freshman setter Joshua Lukens was named most
valuable player for the evening. He finished the night
with 79 assists, an extremely respectable number con
sidering the Cardinal's passing woes.
"Joshua I .ukens was a good choice for most valuable
player," commented Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves. "He had to deal with subpar passing."
Last week, Nieves remarked that Stanford victories
would depend on accurate passing, something that the
Cardinal did not do well on Saturday night.
Senior captain Keenan Whitehurst attributed the
loss in the third game to a breakdown in passing and
the resulting loss of confidence. Near the end of that
game, Nieves substituted Sophomore Josh Palacios,
one of Stanford's best passers, into the Cardinal line
up.
"Josh (Palacios) is a solid passer," remarked White
hurst. "He really stabilized our passing game."
Sophomore Andy Witt, who recorded 32 kills for the
evening, also played a strong role in Stanford's victory.
About half of his kills came in the fourth game.
Witt's role "changed from primary to secondary pass
er during the match." Nieves said. "He didn't let the
change affect his game and really carried the team with
his hitting."
The early depart ure of sophomore outside hitter Jose
Pereira hindered OSU's attack. Pereira left the match
during the first game with an injured ankle. The Buck
eyes dropped the first and second games to the Cardinal
as they attempted to work a replacement into their line
up.
For the match, the Cardinal hit .409 compared to the
Buckeyes' .276. Both teams recorded K5 total kills, but
Stanford had only 24 hitting errors while OSU had 40.
Witt's scored a match-high with his kill total, while se
nior Devin Pool man added IK kills. Whitehurst record
ed the match high-hitting percentage, with .666 and 15
kills.
Stanford also topped OSU with 9 service aces com
pared with their 5. Additionally, Stanford played good
defense. They recorded 31 digs to OSU's 21.

Saturday's match was important for the Cardinal be
cause of the polls.
"We think we're better than eighth," Whitehurst said.
"This match shows that we are better than that."
The Cardinal will continue their title defense with
two matches at Burnham Pavilion next weekend. Friday
night they will face UC-San Diego and Saturday after
noon they will play San Diego State.
