# Officer to look into Sawislak grievance
## 
### T.J. Babbitt Staff writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice will
appoint a grievance officer to inves
tigate Asst. History Prof. Karen
Sawislak"s tenure grievance.
Rice informed Sawislak of her
decision lust week, only days after
receiving Sawislak's official appeal
Jan. 7.
The grievance officer, chosen
from among the Stanford faculty,
will explore the issue of whether
Sawislak's original tenure applica
tion was mishandled by the School of
Humanities and Sciences.

After the officer makes his or her
report. Rice could overturn the
school's decision not to grant Sawts
lak tenure. She could do so either if
she found procedural irregularities
in the original application process or
if she became convinced that the
school had not examined proper in
formation or had used improper cri
teria to evaluate her application.
Sawislak expressed hope that a
grievance officer's examination of
the facts would help her cause.
"It's heartening," she said.
"There were procedural irregulari
ties. and there were improper facts
and criteria brought to bear on the

decision."
Sawislak declined to elaborate
the specific contents of her griev
ance. and Rice will not comment on
the case because the I diversity con
siders most aspects of the tenure
process to be confidential.
Sawislak was approved for a
tenured position by her own depart
ment and by the Committee on Ap
pointments and Promotions last
spring, but Dean of the Schix>l of the
Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven overruled thi>se recommen
dations and denied her a tenured piv
sition in April.
In the first step of what has

[imvcu IU PC Kiiuun appeals
process. Sawislak appealed her deci
sion tn Shoven in October. Shoven
rejected her application a second
time, without appointing a grievance
officer.
This stage of the dispute could be
over quickly, especialh sim. Rice
herself has been an advocate o! mov
ing grievance cases through the sys
tem more quickly. Last December,
she proposed amending the tenure
grievance guidelines to read: "Nor
mally no more than GO days should
elapse between the filing of an ap
peal and the disposition by the ad
ministrative offieer." I he Faculty
Senate supported the change, which
in this case applies to Rice herself.
It' Sawislak's appeal were reject
ed by the Provost's Office, she
would have one last avenue of ap
peal: the University Advisory
Hoard. Sawislak said that she has
made no decision about what she
would do if her appeal were rejected
by Rice.
"I'm taking this one step at a
time," she said.
Members of the Student Coali
tion to Tenure Karen Sawislak also
welcomed the appointment of a

grievance officer, but more than one
wanted Sawislak's academic record
to be considered along with alleged
procedural irregularities.
"We're concerned that Prof.
Sawislak's teaching and her scholar
ship get a fair hearing at this level
and it's frustrating that this process is
based on procedural details," said
Chuck Carlson, a history doctoral
student.
The grounds on which Rice
makes her decision may in fact be
much narrower than the question of
Sawislak's qualification for the job.
According to Senior Associate
Provost for Faculty Affairs Kathryn
Gillam, "The question [ Rice] will be
answering is: Given the proper facts
and criteria, could a reasonable per
son have made this decision [to deny

Sawislak's promotion |?"
The members of the coalition be
lieve that by publicizing Sawislak's
grievance — and casting light on her
work in American labor history —
they can have an effect on Sawislak's
chances for full professorship.
The group plans to hold informa
tional sessions about Sawislak in
White Plaza today and tomorrow,
and supporters have organized a
labor history discussion with profes
sors George Frederickson, Joel
Beinin and Lou Roberts for Jan. 27.
Carlson said the panel was con
ceived as "a kind of teach-in" de
signed to show the importance of the
study of labor history to a variety of
historical fields and the importance
of Sawislak's work to the study of
labor history.
