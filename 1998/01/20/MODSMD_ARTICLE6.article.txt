# Making cadavers come alive
## Summer program cultivates interest in medicine among minority students 
### Julia Beeson Contributing Writer 
The face of next generation's
health care professionals is changing.
I he Stanford Medical Youth Science
Program is providing a catalyst for
this change by empowering and edu
cating low-income minority high
sch<n>l students interested in careers
in the health care profession.
Hie five-week residential summer
program exposes the students to the
health care profession through sci
ence lectures and laboratory work,
including cadaver dissections. htispi

tal and clinical internships, research
projects and one-on-one mentoring.
The youth science program ad
dresses the need for a more accurate
representation of an ethmcalK di
verse society in the health profession,
it aims to increase the number til
health care professionals who under
stand the social, cultural and physical
needs of low-income and ethnic mi
nority populations
According to the program's annu
al report, research indicates that
health care professionals trom under
represented communities are more
likely to serve the needs of communi

ties that lack quality medical care.
I"he program reaches out to urban
and rural high schools within a 2<)o
- radius of campus Students must
come from financially disadvantaged
homes and demonstr iu .1 high com
mitment to the healih .rnd social
problems within their immunities.
ITie program seeks out students
w ho arc interested in health care pro
tessions and have a strong academic
record in science and math. Last sum
mer's 23 participants were selected
from a p«iol of more than VS) appli
cants
The youth science program was

founded in by Dr. Marc
Lawrence and Dr. Michael McCul
lough, both graduates of Stanford
and current emergency r»x>m physi
cians at the Stanford hospital, and Dr
Marilyn Winkleb\. a Stanlord Senior
Research Scientist.
Winkleby. also a lecturer in the
program, identified the need to
"begin educating individuals w ho will
understand the unique needs and cul
tural backgrounds of a diverse popu
lation."
Previous participants in the pro
gram come from more than 20 ethnic
backgrounds. The majority of past
participants. 69 percent of them, are
or will be the first in their families to
attend college.
"A lot of these students are told by
their teachers and guidance coun
selors to lower their expectations [for
college]. We tell them they belong at
a top university, that they don't have
to lower their expectations," Winkle
by said.
The mentoring role continues be
yond the conclusion of the summer
program. Mentors help the students
with everything from writing letters
of recommendation for internship
and college applications to offering
advice to the college bound students.
Senior DeLise Cousins, a human
biology major and co-director of the
program, still talks regularly to pro
gram alumni. Cousins credits the sci
ence program for helping the stu
dents gain a sense of confidence in
themselves and their studies when
there are "not a lot of support systems
for their endeavors."
After two years as a mentor, Kate
Lupton. class of '97. is now the pro
gram's outreach coordinator. In an

effort to expand the reach of the pro
gram. Lupton is working to construct
a World Wide Web page that will
offer program information, college
information targeting low-income
students, financial aid tips, career
guidance about health positions and a
chat room for program alumni.
"[The program] can really make
the difference between a student
going to college and not going to col
lege," Lupton said.
In order to coordinate new efforts
to expand the existing program, the
first full-time executive director,
Mailee Ferguson was recently hired.
Having been a mentor during her un
dergraduate years, Ferguson is most
impressed with the "dedication of the
staff, participants and other individu
als who want to see the program grow
and continue."
Ferguson is currently working to
expand the summer program into the
school year as well. The Health Ca
reers Opportunity Program, mod
eled after the Stanford Medical
Youth Science Program, targets low
income college sophomores, includ
ing Stanford students, who want to
pursue medical careers.
The HCOP Admissions Commit
tee will select 20 students to partici
pate in the summer program being
held on campus from June 21 to July

31. The application deadline is March
13.
For students interested in apply
ing for a counselor or associate direc

tor position with the program this
summer, applications are available at
the human biology office. Applica
tions are due Jan. 30.
