Get off your feet and earn some money.
HERE'S an opportunity to earn some money and play an
important role in making the Dashboard scooter the next big
thing on campus. The Dashboard, the original American
scooter", is the fun-to-ride, easy-to-maintain, next generation of
human-powered transportation.
As a Dashboard Dash√üep, you'll
be our on-campus sales agent
responsible for converting stu
dent interest into sales. You'll
be provided with a Dashboard
scooter as well as Dashboard
shoes and Dashboard
Ride Wear " All you have to do is
ride your Dashboard, answer
questions, and take orders. We
do the rest.
To qualify you must be honest,
highly motivated, physically fit,
and be willing to do minor
scooter assembly. To apply
send us a brief resume and S?
employment references. jjj
We'll be scheduling inter- 1 W
views on campus soon. 1
