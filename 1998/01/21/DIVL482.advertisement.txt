"The most technologically sophisticated
firm on the Street."
—Fortune
D. E. Shaw & Co., L.P. is a global invest
ment bank whose activities focus on the
intersection of technology and finance.
Our unusually gifted staff includes a
disproportionate number of the world's
leading computer scientists, systems
architects, and software engineers.
Although we've grown into a financial
powerhouse in the nine years of our
existence, with aggregate capital now
well in excess of $1 billion, we've
retained a start-up company's apprecia
tion for demonstrably superior talent.
If you have an expert knowledge of
distributed object-oriented or database
computing on Windows NT or UNIX
platforms, you may find that your
talents will serve you better on
Wall Street than in Silicon Valley.
D. E. Shaw & Co. will be
hosting an information session
at 7:00 P.M. on Wednesday,
January 21, in the Vice Provost's
Conference Room (by the
Tresidder Computer Lair).

D. E. Shaw & Co., L P. is an equal-opportunity employer.
