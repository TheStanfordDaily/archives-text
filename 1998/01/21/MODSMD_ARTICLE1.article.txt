# Students protest Unz June ballot initative
## Ralliers show support for bilingual education 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
Students and alumni gathered
with more than KM) demonstrators
in Palo Alto yesterday to protest
local businessman Ron Unz's June
ballot initiative, which would limit
bilingual education in California's
elementary schools.
About 15 Stanford students par
ticipated in the rally outside Wall
Street Analytics — a software com
pany founded by Unz — chanting
such slogans as, "Stop racism, no on
Unz."
Unz gathered 433,(KX) signatures
in 1997 to put the "English for the
Children" initiative on the June 1998
ballot.
If the bilingual initiative passes,
all public-school students in Califor
nia would "be taught English by

being taught in English," as the pro
posal states. Students with limited
proficiency would be placed in a spe
cial English immersion program, as
"local schools shall be permitted to
place in the same classroom English
learners of different ages but whose
degree of English proficiency is sim
ilar." Students would be placed in
regular classrooms after one year
unless they needed to spend addi
tional time in the program.
"We wanted to show support for
the people working to try to keep
bilingual education going," said Cari
Pang, a master's student in educa
tion who participated in the protest.
She said the initiative was another
manifestation of the recent backlash
against multiculturalism that has
pervaded California politics in the
last few years.
Beginning at about 3:30 pm, the

demonstrators protested for about
two hours. The event featured
speakers, including a former student
in the California bilingual education
system. Speaking in both English
and Spanish before the crowd, he
said that it had taken him five years
to achieve the fluency levels he cur
rently had in the two languages. This
far exceeded the one-year time peri
od specified by the text of the initia
tive.
Junior Cathy Rion also pointed
out greater issues involved with the
Unz initiative. She said she rallied
against what she saw as an infringe
ment on immigrant rights and the
parents' freedom to choose a bilin
gual education for their children.

they can" in teaching English tochil
