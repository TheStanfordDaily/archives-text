China reassures U.S.
BEIJING (AP) — C hina has hardened the
assurance it gave President Clinton last fall that
it will not sell Iran more missiles capable of dis
rupting the flow of Persian Gulf oil. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said yesterday.
"There will be no new sales, no transfers of
technology, no technical cooperation that could
give Iran an ability to upgrade current [missile]
systems." Cohen told reporters after a 65-
minutc meeting with President Jiang Zemin.
Later, after Cohen flew to Tokyo for talks
with top Japanese government officials yester
day evening, aides to the defense secretary said
Jiang did not explicitly state his government's
policy on anti ship cruise missile sales to Iran.
I lie aides, speaking on condition they not be
identified, said ( ohen told Jiang that (ien. ( hi
Haotian, the defense minister, had told him on
Monday that China would stop all exports ot
cruise missiles to Iran. Jiang did not disagree,
and Cohen interpreted that as confirmation of

Chi's statement, the aides said.
At a news conference today morning in
Tokyo; Cohen expressed "my personal regrets"
for recent U.S. naval air training off the carrier
USS Independence near Tokyo. He said the
nighttime flights had disrupted the studies of
Japanese students and that U.S. officials had
failed to give proper advance notice.
"We will certainly try to avoid this in the
future," Cohen said. It was the latest in a string
of U.S. missteps that have stirred the Japanese
public's resentment at the presence of Ameri
can forces in their country.
Federal reductions proposed
WASHINGTON (AP) The House's top
tax writer proposed federal reductions yester
day estimated at 3>2(M) billion over the next
decade — and urged Congress to seal them
with a lid on the national tax burden. On the
Democratic side, Dick Gephardt revived his
plan for most people to pay a 10 percent rate.

The initiatives by Minority Leader Gephardt
and House Ways and Means Chairman Bill
Archer surfaced a week before Congress returns
to work and tries to turn tax talk into action.
A centerpiece for Archer's agenda is a pro
posal to reduce the combined federal tax burden
on individuals and businesses from 19.9 percent
of the gross domestic product to 19 percent of
GDP — which Archer estimates would cost
$200 billion over 10 years. Individual income
taxes currently total 9.2 percent of GDP, corpo
rate taxes 2.4 percent and payroll taxes for
Social Security and Medicare 6.8 percent. ()ther
federal revenues comprise 1.5 percent.
"The reason families are struggling today is
because the government is taking their money
before they have a chance to invest it in them
selves. their children and their communities."
Archer, R-Texas, said in a speech.
Armed with forecasts of a $(tf>o billion bud
get surplus in the next decade. Archer also pro
posed paying down the national debt by $200
billion over 10 years.
