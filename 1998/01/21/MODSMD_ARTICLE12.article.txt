# Cloned cows give new prospects for medicine
## 
### 
BOS TON (AP) On a ranch
in Texas, a herd of cows is about to
give birth to what may be the
future of the pharmaceutical indus
try.
Scientists said yesterday they
have developed a technique for
cloning genetically customized
calves that will be able to produce
medicines for humans in their milk.
The lirst cloned calves
George and Charlie were born
last week, giving hope that cloned
cows could become living pharma
ceutical factories.
"'The applications for this in phar
maceutical production are enor
mous." said Dr. Steven Slice of
Advanced Cell Technology Inc., one
of the collaborators in the project.
Although the first clones are
males, the real payoff will come
with females.
Slice and the other principal
researcher, James Robl of the t 'ni
versilv of Massachusetts 111
Amherst, said they will next try to
use their technique to have cows
make human serum albumin.
Albumin, a MimhJ protein that
regulates the transfer of fluids in
the body, is critical to people sut
fcring from liver disease, mainour
ishment, extreme burns, anil other

conditions.
Cows that could produce
human serum albumin would be a
huge boon to hospitals, which are
forced to rely on donated blood for
the 480 tons of albumin needed
every year.
"It's a big deal." said Mark
YVestluisin. a researcher at Texas
A&M University, who wasn't
involved in the project. " This tech
nology has the potential to be a lot
more efficient than the technology
that we have now."
Patients suffering from liver dis
ease lose significant amounts ol
blood protein through their urine.
In cases of malnutrition, the body
takes protein from the blood it it is
not available through food.
Ami because the skin holds
much ol the body's moisture, burn
patients can become severely
dehydrated and lose protein that
must be replenished.
Advanced Cell Technology,
which was founded by Slice and
Robl. already has a deal with Gen
/yme Transgenics Corp. of Fram
ingham to produce albumin.
It is estimated that the cows
could produce up to 175 pounds a
year o! albumin, as opposed to a
pint at a time from blood donors.
