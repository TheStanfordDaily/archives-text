## 
### 
HAVANA (AP) — The faithful sang
and prayed yesterday in the streets of
Havana, and Cubans of every persuasion
Catholic, communist and curious
awaited a papal visit that many said could
be a turning point for their nation.
On the eve of John Paul IPs first visit
ever to Cuba, the communist government
was still laboring to patch and pretty up
sections of the crumbling capital, which
has been ravaged by a collapsed national
economy.
Crews poured and steamrolled fresh
asphalt over the cracked and potholed
roads, traveled by rusted and creaking old
cars and trucks. Workers sprayed yellow
paint on one school's faded facade.
While most Cubans agree the pope's
five-day visit will leave their country
changed, expectations on what the
change will be depends on their political
and religious perspective.
Foes of Fidel Castro hope it will weak
en his communist regime. Castro hopes to

gain stature for his revolution. And the
Cuban church hopes for more freedom of
action.
A nationwide prayer vigil was planned
in churches throughout the country yes
terday evening. Outside downtown
Havana's Our Lady of Carmen Church,
hoys and girls joyously swung each other
around as young and old worshippers
sang and prayed in a festival atmosphere
oblivious to the evening traffic on Infanta
Avenue.
At Medalla Milagrosa Church, in the
Havana neighborhood of Santos Suarez.
10-year-old Claudia, dressed in a pink
Snoopy sweatshirt, dreamed of shaking
hands with the pope as she and others fin
ished work on the last of HO.(KK) simple
Cuban and papal flags made at the
church.
"The pope is like God. a beautiful pic
ture," imagines Claudia.
While Castro sought to burnish his
government's image and the pope hoped

lor a spiritual awakening in ( üba. it was
unclear which of the two men has tougher
task of evangelization.
"Missions are more difficult here than
in Africa or India. We have to start from
scratch. We have to explain everything."
said the Rev Jesus I u/aretta. a Spanish
priest who spends two months a year at
Medalla Milagrosa Church. "You can't
easily wipe out 40 years of restrictions."
In Washington on yesterday. President
Clinton was asked what the I nited States
was gaining by pressing the embargo
against ( üba.
"We want ( üba to move toward free
dom and openness, and if they do. we'll
respond." he said. " That's always been
our position, and I believe that in the end
it will prevail."
By the end of next week, it was doubt
ful that many ( übans would not have
heard of the pontiff. In his first visit on
Cuban soil, he is to be greeted toda\ in
Havana b\ ("astro.
