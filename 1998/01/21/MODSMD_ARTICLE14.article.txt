### 
SACRAMENTO. Calif. (AP) — Both
sides in the IJnabomber trial agreed that
Theodore Kaczynski is competent to
stand trial — the basic requirement for
acting as his own lawyer — but the judge
suggested that his request to represent
himself came too late.
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr.
said Kaczvnski had clearly agreed to pro
ceed with his lawyers after a series of
meetings with the judge in December.
Later, Kaczynski changed his mind.
Burrell suggested that if Kaczynski
wanted to be his own lawyer, he should
have made the motion when the trial
began.
"We're not in a pretrial hearing." the

JL
judge said. "We're in trial. This case com
menced on Nov. 12. 1997."
The continuing dispute between
Kaczynski and his lawyers centers on
their desire to mount a defense based on
his mental state. Kaczynski is adamantly
opposed and wants to base his defense on
his anti-technology views.
Government prosecutor Robert
Cleary suggested that changes could be
made up until the time that a jury is seat
ed but he conceded that case law on the
subject isn't clear. Cleary noted that the
jury, chosen Dec. 22. has not yet been
sworn.
Burrell rejected a government bid to
see more of the transcripts of his private

meetings with the defendant, who could
get the death penalt\ it convicted.
"Statements b\ \lr. kac/ynski could
he used b\ the government in its ;ittempt
to kill him." said the judge. "That's a
deadly serious matter.
"I can understand wh\ the defense
doesn't want to release more of what
Kac/ynski said. I he\ would he helping
the government in its quest to obtain its
objective."
Defense lawyers agreed to stipulate
that Kac/ynski is competent to stand trial
after reviewing a 47-page report b\ Dr.
Sails Johnson, a federal prison psychia
trist who interviewed him for hours last
week.
