New initiative to promote
the humanities is a step
in the right direction.

PRESIDENT CASPER'S NEW lec
ture program and funding initiative
will strengthen the humanities and
arts at Stanford. Fourteen famous human
ists. artists, critics and architects will make
their way to the Farm to share their
thoughts and speak with students.
Casper should he commended for his
efforts to bring more teachers, people and
ideas to our humanties programs.
The prime location of Stanford in the Sil
icon Valley and the excellent undergraduate
and graduate programs in the engineering
and sciences have made Stanford Universi
ty quite a formidable force in the high tech
world. What fails to garner feature spreads
in Business Week or Forbes, however, is the
University's programs in areas less "techie."
Casper has made a marked effort to
build the humanities and arts. Traditionally,
these departments have not received the
funding for staff and programs as the engi
neering and sciences, which benefit from
research funds from the government and
corporations.
The recently announced lecture series.

featuring such acclaimed individuals as
author Umberto Eco. critic Harold Bloom
and artist Christo. is a step in the right direc
tion. Bringing in these renown figures will
increase the attention given to the humani
ties on campus. It is a hope that the artists
and humanists will bring new ideas and
innovation to Stanford.
The speakers will spend three days on
campus, give a lecture and participate in dis
cussions. Tentatively, 14 lecturers are slated
through the year 2(KH). But the most telling
tale is the fact that the money for the pro
gram will come straight out of the presi
dent's discretionary funds.
T he stated intent of Casper to transform
the humanities into a -''more visible and
dynamic participant in shaping, enriching
and challenging the intellectual agenda
across the University" indicates that he rec
ognizes this as an area that is worthy of bol
stering.
Furthermore, he is willing to put up the
resources for these initiatives. Twelve mil
lion dollars has been allotted to add four
new professorships in the humanities that
will undoubtedly increase Stanford's com
petitiveness in those departments.
It appears that Casper has attempted to
tackle weaknesses in the humanities by
channeling funds to bring in both new ideas
and new teachers to develop and implement
them.
