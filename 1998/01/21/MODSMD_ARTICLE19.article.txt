## The 						new corporate government 
### 
Most people
don't know it,
but I come from
a political family. My
grandfather and my uncic
were legislators in Indiana.
My father was a judge for
a short time. Pretty much

every one of my blood relations is a dyed
in-the-wool Democrat. I'm named, in part,
after a Democratic Party Chairman from
the IS(K)s. (Let me tell you, THAT does
wonders for the psyche.)
As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for my
father, I'd be rotting in law school some
place as we speak. I'd be yet another rung in
the Bauer Tower of Power.
Fortunately, my father had a three-part
rule. If I showed any interest in law as an
child, I was to be sent out back and told to
get some air. If I was to show any further
ambitions toward the law, I was to be
taken out back again and shown the septic
tank.
My father always thought plumbing in
general was a much better field than law. It
had better hours and paid even the honest
well. Hut most importantly, in plumbing,
you never dealt with anything worse than
sewage. Thus, the septic tank.
11 I were to go any farther toward law or
even breathe a word about politics, I was to
be taken out back and put out of my misery,
for good.
Luckily, 1 got the picture around part one.
I'm not alone, either. Most everyone I

know thinks that politics is worse than a
load of crap. Even though the feeling of dis
sent seems so strong around here, trying to
start a political discussion is looked on like
vomiting publicly — you get a lot of awk
ward looks, most people try to move away
from you as quickly as possible and no one
offers to help clean up.
The reasons people give are simple. All
politicians have become the same. The two
party system has failed. One vote doesn't
matter. The government doesn't do any
thing right. No one represents the views of
the people.
In short, it just doesn't matter, it' can be
a vote, a political race, an issue or an entire
system of government. But its irrelevance is
certain.
Yet, people are political animals. The
failures of our government can't change
human nature. So where have politics gone?
I argue that political matters have left
our government and entered our work
place.
Consider the factors: Intrigue over pro
motions, workplace policy and who brings
the donuts next week has grown exponen
tially over the years. Committees are ram
pant, each of which with its own power
pools.
Various corporate hierarchies vie for ter
ritory and control of markets, much like
countries. And true to form, different cor
porations use different political philoso
phies to empower their workers — from
unionized manufacturers to employee

owned enterprises to rebellious startups.
Hell, corporations have more wars than
countries these days, over silly things like
World Wide Weh browsers and cereals.
And if you look a bit farther beyond the AP
wire, you'd see that they have plenty of kill
that-guy-over-there wars as well. And per
haps much worse.
Then again, corporations have become
the power brokers of Western civilization.
For better and for worse, corporations are
the entities that change our world. What
else would you expect from a society that
considers work more important than any
thing else?
Where does this leave us?
Alter all these years of struggle over
democracy, suffrage and civil rights, we've
helped ensure that everyone can partic
ipate in the political process of government
— which isn't where power and politics
live anymore. So we get to start all over
again.
Will our next Bill of Rights ensure our
right to consume as much as our incomes
can bear?
Will our fundamental right be to work
and / or die?
Will my great-great-great-great grand
child tell his son not to go into management
consulting (or face the septic tank)?
(collective oops here)

Eric Bauer, a graduate student in computer
science, wishes his father had liked fixing
more than plumbing.
