# Stanford Hospital staff deals with higher patient numbers
## 
### Robert Chiles Staff writer 
Stanford Hospital is seeing
fewer and fewer spare beds since
October, forcing it to turn away
some patients and find extra help.
Hospital administrators had no
easy explanation for the increase.
Director of Patient Care Services
Laurie Gunderson cited new med
ical care plans as a possible impetus
for the current rise in admissions.
"We're still very full and things
are very tight," said Gunderson.
Hospital spokesman Mike
(Joodkind said he regards the recent
influx as normal and manageable.
" There are no |bed| shortages;
we've just been filled up and it
started late last year," he said. "It

absolutely can be dealt with."
Other medical centers have
been forced to navigate through
rougher waters. Throughout the
Bay Area and greater California,
other hospitals have been con
fronted with patient overflows as
well.
"We actually have done better
than most other hospitals," said
Gunderson,
Transfers from local hospitals
have been turned away, yet ambu
lances and walk-ins have been
forced to endure only minor de
lays.
"We're still working a lot of
staff additional time and over
time." states Gunderson.
Registered nurses have been in
tight supply and their hours have

been increased, but there is not a
labor crisis, said (ioodkind.
"There's an ongoing effort to
hire new nurses, but there is a con
tinual effort to attract quality, well
trained nurses." he said.
Departments currently bearing
a heavy load include surgical units,
critical care, coronary care and
monitored units.
"I think that people are getting
tired. We can only respond to
crises, and that's at every level,"
said (ioodkind. "We've been able
to maintain patient safety."
Thus far. no serious cases have
been turned awav.
"We have not yet had to close
our emergency room and so we are
still able to accept emergency pa
tients." said (iundersoil.
