Pro-lifers are the part of
the courageous few
In his beautifully written, "Roe v.
Wade: the immaculate misconception,"
Garry Grundy eloquently summarized the
heart of the pro-life movement. As one
who struggles to "fight against the horrible
injustices of legalized infanticide," howev
er. I would like to add that what is com
monly and mistakenly described as a "clus
ter of highly developed cells" is at the time
of abortion, an identifiable child â€” com
plete with brain waves, heart beat and fin
gerprints. And in the abominable case of
partial-birth abortion, he or she is a fully
developed human child.
Our acceptance of abortion today is evi
dence of why terrible atrocities against
humanity have occurred throughout
human history, again and again. Atrocities
have become the status quo. They don't
interfere with our daily lives unless a few
people force us to think about it. As histo
ry proceeds we look back at these atroci
ties against humankind, and ask ourselves,
"Why didn't anyone do anything to stop
this? What were they thinking? Didn't
anyone care?" Well, one day our children
and our children's children will be asking
these very questions about this abortion

era. Years from now, when people finally
wake up to the silent pleading of millions
of slaughtered babies, they too will look
back and ask "What were they thinking?
Didn't anyone care?" I simply hope that
future generations will be able to look
back and see that a courageous few did
care. And that they are the reason that "we
shall overcome."

Grundy 9 column ignores
women's difficulties
I would like to respond to Garry
C irundy's Jan. 20 column. It is highly unfair
that The Daily allowed a columnist to dis
cuss an issue as complicated as abortion
without providing an forum for additional
viewpoints. I don't want to advocate repro
ductive choice or argue about the science
of life or the practicality of abortion. I
think we have all heard those arguments
before, and we can all think of gotxJ rea
sons for pro- and anti-choice positions.
However, it is important to note that
Cirundy's column ignored the difficulties
that women encounter in deciding to abort

their "fetus" or "child" (whichever you
prefer). It is probably the hardest choice a
woman ever has to make, and I don't think
we have the right to judge a woman who
honestly felt, in her heart of hearts, in light
of her circumstances and those of the
world around her. that she could not bear
a child. It is not a decision that is lightly
made, and no one has the right to blindly
declare that the issue of abortion is so
black and white that women who abort are
murderers.

Join fight for equal access
I'd like to respond to Darron Evans'
column ("Waging and winning the war,"
Jan. 16) with a suggestion, a comment and
an offer. As an advocate for the Equal
Educational Opportunity Initiative
(EEOI). I would suggest that [Evans] read
the Initiative... closely. It reads: "In order
to provide equal opportunity, promote
diversity and combat discrimination in
public education, the state may consider
the economic background, race, sex, eth
nicity and national origin of qualified indi
viduals."

The EEOI is about equal access to pub
lic education. It will permit educators to
use many different tools, including affir
mative action, to provide for a diverse stu
dent body. It does not mandate affirmative
action, which [Evans] says is "about help
ing the least well off." I thought it was
about recognizing the full complexity of
what constitutes "merit" in our society and
about recruiting equally qualified individu
als who are members of groups that have
been historically discriminated against or
who would add diversity to the student
body. For example, Stanford Law School
takes into consideration not only race and
ethnicity, but also work experience and
socioeconomic status. Many universities
also look for artistic or athletic talent, geo
graphic diversity and multigenerational
"legacies." Ultimately, we should ask the
mission of the California educational sys
tem. If it is primarily to educate Califor
nia's students to become leaders and pro
ductive citizens in a pluralistic state, then
equal access for all Californians should be
the goal.
[Evans] advises that proponents of
affirmative action should offer a "well
thought out." "politically viable" (i.e..
acceptable to whites) alternative to
"mend" affirmative action. This is it. The
EEOI allows for class-based affirmative

action policies, does not mandate race- or
gender-based affirmative action and
should satisfy all Californians" conception
of fairness as it allows for "qualified indi
viduals" only. Further, the EEOI is politi
cally viable. (Evans) unfortunately exag
gerates when he says that Prop. 2W was
"overwhelmingly successful." The mis
leadingly written proposition passed 54
percent to 46 percent. In December, the
New York Times revealed that SO percent
of whites felt that affirmative action should
be continued for the next few years or con
tinued for the foreseeable future (only 13
percent thought it should be ended now).
East November, Houstonians voted by 55
percent to 45 percent against eliminating
affirmative action.
And, finally, here's the offer: everyone,
especially [Evans], who wants to help pro
vide all qualified individuals with equal
access to California's public education
institutions can write or call me and I will
make sure they get a petition to sign; or,
better yet, they can join the many volun
teers who will be gathering signatures two
hours per week for the EEOI.
