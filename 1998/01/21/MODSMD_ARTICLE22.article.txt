YOIJ THINK I should go
■ work for Chanel or Nisei?"
Last week, I ran into an old
friend in Tokyo, and the two of us ended up
chatting for a while. She was a student at one
of Japan's most respected universities.
"Those are the two offers I'm consider
ing," she continued. "They're both
respectable companies, and I don't know
what to do." Nisei is a major Japanese insur
ance company; I told her it would probably
be a good idea to go there il she wanted to
deal with people and insurance, and to
Chanel if she liked makeup and clothes.
"Do you have any idea what you'll be
doing at those places?" 1 asked.
"Well, I'm a 'generalist,'" slv started to
answer, referring to one of the two distinct
categories of the female workforce in Japan.
About 20 percent of female workers fall
under the 'professional' category and have
careers; the others have 'general' jobs, con
sisting of manual labor and secretarial work.
"I have no idea what department I'll be
placed in." she said. "But all it'll probably be

is making copies and serving tea anyway."
Then what difference will it make if she's
working for Seinichi, Chanel or Channel 7,
for that matter? What could I possibly tell
her that would help her decide? I suggested
she could perhaps choose one and check it
out for now — she could go someplace else if
she didn't like it. Of course, that sort of thing
is out of the question, she told me.
I was getting frustrated, but not at her,
though. This conversation with my friend
was a typical result of the traditional and
uncreative hiring system unique to Japanese
society. Japanese companies, most of which
still follow the lifelong employment system,
have always imposed restrictive norms on
the many society-bound college students. To
me, the most simple job search concept is
probably deciding the field to go into and
applying to the organizations that area.
Since then, I've brought up this subject
with friends whenever I could. I quickly
learned that the consensus was to "stay flexi
ble in order to get the best job."
"You apply to virtually every industry and

every field," said one college senior who
landed a job with a major bank. 'You can't
know what to expect. You just accept."
"You can't be that picky," said another,
who will start work at a telecommunications
giant. "It's standard to think about the stabil
ity of your future rather than the actual con
tent of work." Neither of them really know
the specifics of their jobs yet. but they will
both be dressed in suits and ready to start
work in April, when all the new graduates
enter the workforce.
In Japan, job hunting has u season and
recruiting happens once a year. In a sense, it
is like U.S. college applications. The job
seekers, who must, for almost all companies,
be "fresh" out of college, send out letters of
inquiry, wait for the applications, fill out
forms and do whatever it takes to get in
meet with recruiters, go to interviews, write
essays, take exams, visit the institutions.
The students start off by sending out
handwritten postcards to companies, by the
end of the junior year, although it is much
earlier for many fields. A typical college

junior sends out an average of KX) postcards.
Unlike the college applications, however,
the companies can "discriminate." They only
respond to applicants they are interested in.
kids at the nation's top schools. While some
students in these respected universities get
applications sent to their homes without even
mailing out postcards, some will he happy to
receive one response for every 20 cards.
Many rules, both implicit and explicit,
govern job hunt, hut as the case in any system
there are exceptions to these rules. For
example, varsity athletes, are exempt from
most of the process. I hey can contact their
old teammates, or their coaches, as they will
prohahly have something for them.
"I'm excited to get on with my life and
start searching for jobs, but that may be
because I know I have the varsity safety net.'
I know I can get some decent job. no matter
what." a varsity rugby player confided. He
added that this is so because it's widely
understood that varsity athletes have key
features companies are looking for They are
used to hierarchy, know team work well and

will make better employees.
"We know our manners and are good at
following the hierarchy," he explained.
What he told me hints at why mt>st
Japanese companies only want kids straight
out of college — past experience is not
appreciated. My friends who interned at a
TV station do not put that on their resumes
it takes away from their "freshness."
Mut even in Japan, people can and do end
up where they want, doing what they want —
if they know what they want and are truly
motivated. The number is not large, but from
a high school friend who decided to drop out
of the race and study architecture to another
who decided to turn down an offer from a
bank to pursue his longtime passion in elec
tronics. there are those who are slowly but
surely saying no to the system.
For now. these people are my hopes and
comfort as I continue watching and rexperi
enciny my native country.
