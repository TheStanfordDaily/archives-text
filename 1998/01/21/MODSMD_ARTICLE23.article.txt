## The 						fourth time could be the best time for John Elway Last stand for a gambler 
### 
When the Denver Broncos' offense
takes the field in Super Howl
XXXII, II players will jog out
and take their places along the line. ()ne will
be John Elway. The other 10 might as well
he at Sea World.

Technically, the tickets will read "Den
ver Broncos vs. Green Bay Packers." But
they might as well read "John Elway vs. 1 lis
tory."
All eyes will he on Elway, Denver's vet
eran quarterback and a 1983 Stanford grad
uate, as he attempts to avoid the infamy of a
fourth Super Bowl loss. In the days leading
up to the championship game, media pub
licity has been so focused on Elway that the
rest of his team has to feel a little left out (or
as left out as one can be surrounded by 3,(HK)
journalists).
The consensus is that Sunday's game w ill
dictate how the 37-year-old goes down in
the record books. If the Broncos win. he will
be the hero who finally gets his due. If not.
he'll be the most successful loser the NFL
has ever seen.
Like many football fans with wagering
tendencies, my relationship with John

Elway has been tenuous, at best. I've bet on
the Broncos three times in the Super Bowl,
and ns a result have lost money, pride and a
large variety of 7-Eleven products. As a
fourth-grader in 1988. 1 was one of only
three students not to pick the Redskins, and
therefore one of three students not to earn a
free recess.
Despite my losses — perhaps even due
to my losses — Elway has always held a spe
cial place in my heart, right next to the Seat
tle Mariners and the McMinnville High
School football team (which once stretched
23 years without a playoff berth). But he is
more to me than just a lovable loser. He's an
athletic embodiment of hope.
With John Elway. there's always a
chance. He is the master of the fourth quar
ter comeback, king of the desperate situa
tion. More than anything, his flair for the
dramatic has endeared him to football fans
nationwide.
It certainly has endeared him to Dan
Wolverton, a Louisville, Ky.. psychologist
and Stanford alum who sent The Daily an
article titled. "Which Elway will show up?
'The Erratic Athlete?' or 'The Great (Quar
terback?'"
Wolverton traces his affection for Elway
to a play against IJSC in 1980. which
Wolverton watehed from the student sec
tion of Stanford Stadium. On that play,
Elway dodged several Trojan pass rushers,
winding and sprinting backwards from mid
field to his own 35 yard-line, before throw
ing a 65-yard rope into the endzone for a
touchdown.
"Prior to the USC play," Wolverton
writes, "Elway was a 'quarterback.'...

Alter the I JSC' play. was a 'great ath
lete' who happened to play quarterback.
Commentators hegan hyping Elway's pen
chant for the dramatic, his perhaps un
precedented skill level, and his seemingly
unlimited 'potential.'
"For the remainder of his Stanford ca
reer. Elway seemed to relish these images.
He became the gunslinger. the gambler. I le
won some big games — toppling No. I
Washington in one week of his senior sea
son — and lost little ones — losing to un
heralded Arizona the next week. I le threw
punishing line drives into double and triple
coverage. And he threw punishing line dri
ves to wide open backs standing a few feet
from him. He played erratically for three
quarters and then staged heroic comeback
drives in the final minutes of games, some
times winning and sometimes falling short."
While that style has won Elway his share
of fans and games over the years, it has
never won him the Big One. But this year.
Elway is different, and the Broncos (those
guys in blue and orange next to Shamu's
tank) are too. The quarterback and the of
fense have matured. As Wolverton notes:
"For the first time in his 15-year career.
Elway — the league s all-time winningest
quarterback — was the AFC' leader in pass
ing efficiency. He is working comfortably
within a balanced, ball-control offense. He
appears content to share the offensive acco
lades with running back Terrell Davis. He
forces fewer passes, and he uses more
touch. And he is more effective than he has
ever been."

John Elway, shown here in his Stanford playing days, makes his fourth trip to the
Super Bowl this Sunday when the Denver Broncos meet the Green Bay Packers.
This Is probably the last chance
for John Elway, and the last chance
in a While for a Stanford quarter
back, to win the Super Bowl. And
there is reason to believe this time he
may come through.
In the grand metaphor of Elway's
career, this is the fourth quarter.

I his is the time for one of history's
great quarterbacks to take his place
in history. It will be a tough game
against a tough team, but anything
less wouldn't be Elway.

Sophomore sports editor Jim

Ehvay Sunday, hut he lias grown
wise enough not to het on an AIX

13-point spread.
