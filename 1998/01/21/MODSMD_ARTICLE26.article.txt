# Rob and Va ask: What's in a sport?
## 
### 
When is a sport a span'.' \\ itli
the coming of the IWS Winter
Olympics and the addition <>! nu
merous new sports to this year's
winter games, \ anes.su and I de
cided to discuss just what makes
something a sport.
Kohin: Vanessa. I've hail thisdis
cussion with many other people,
some athletes and others not:
What criteria do you place on
something before you consider it
a sport?
Va: Everything is defined b\ the

eye of the beholder. V\ ho am I In
sav what is and what isn't? Wait,
this is my column. A sport re
quires sweat, an adversary,
preferably physical contact, a
coach, a ret. and at some point ei
ther Wayne Newton or Tom
Jones singing the National An
them before one of its contests.
Kohin: I hat excludes .1 lot of
things most people think ol .is
sports \\ hat do you s.i\ to those
people?
Va: No matter how much you
want it. Magic the (lather ing will
never be an ()lympie event.
Kohin: Well. Nvh.it about spoils
that meet some, but not .ill ol the
criteria? W hat about .1 sport like
billiards where the competitor
has an opponent, coaches or
what have >ou. but no Wayne
Newton.
\ a: I hat s .1 classic example.
Which brings up another very
important point Am so-called
sport which can be made into a
drinking game or 111 which \ollr
skill actually improves with in
toxication is not a sport, includ
ing bowling, darts, shuffle board,
foosball. horse shoes and
strangely and this is |ust for
me Monopoly.
Kohin: One thine that I think

K
qualifies as a sport is the way in
which the score is kept. Figure
skating, a competition where the
score is qualitative rather than
quantitative, is what I consider a
pseudo-sport. It definitely re
quires skill, but is it really a
sport?
\ a: No. both male .md female
competitors wear makeup Sure
millions of Americans enjoy
watching it. but millions of
Americans watch a stupid sitcom
about a tool man. 1 hat doesn't
mean it is quality Ihe sport

overall is toosubjective. v an \ou
imagine how main games we'd
lose il points were given for style
and grace?
Kohin: Come on Vanessa, you're
like Richard Simmons. He's the
pinnacle of style and grace.
\a: I hanks. Robin, you're the
wind beneath mv wings.
Kohin: I h.it's great. Well look
ing at your qualifications, vou
said preferably physical contact.
What do vou think about sports
without the contact?
\ a: Sports that test the physical
limitations ol the body such as
track and field, long distance
running and swimming might not
be the most crowd pleasing, but
thev definitely qualily as sports
because ot the training and men
tal and physical strain placed on
the competitor Now. I wouldn't
go as tar to s;i\ that sports with
out contact are not sports, but
wouldn't volleyball be improved
it they punched each other under
the net? It would at least be a lit
tle more entertaining.
Kohin: Well what about lower
division horse racing where the
jockeys sometimes kick each
other that's contact.

Va: Sports involve PEOPLE. That
means humans. If there is an animal
involved such as horse racing, dog
racing, equestrian, frog jumping,
polo, dog-sled racing, fishing, hunt
ing, donkey basketball and that dol
phin crap from I fawaii. then it is not
a real sport in my book.
Kobin: Wow. you're awful particu
lar and set in your ways.

Va: Yes, I have often been called
Miss Havisham.
Robin: OK. that's a bizarre refer
ence. Hut if they're not sports, why
do so many people get entranced
by watching Battle of the Network
Stars?
Va: I agree. Who can resist
Jonathan Taylor Thomas hucking
lawn darts at the Olsen twins?
Even I have been entranced for
hours on end watching rodeo and
lumberjack contests. And I have an
unquenchable addiction to the

bizarre phenomenon known as
World's Strongest Man. I'll sit for
hours on end watehing WSM from
197X and aetually he on the edge of
my seat even though I know Mag
nus wins every time.
Kohin: You didn't really answer
my question.
Va: I would say it's human nature.
As Americans, we want to see win
ners and losers. Why do you think
Jerry Springer gets such good rat
ings. all they have on the show are
losers talking to each other's hands

and tossing chairs.
Kohin: Hey, my roommate was on
Jerry Springer.
Va: So was mine. What's your
point?
Kohin: I don't know, hut I'm defi
nitely clearer on what's a sport and
what isn't. This has been very en
lightening.

Rubin and Vanessa warn students
that i) they don t attend tomorrow
night's game against Washington
Slate, they will he turned into pita.
