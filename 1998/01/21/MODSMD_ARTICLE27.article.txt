## Scientists discover gene responsible for phototropism 
### Erika Check Contributing writer 
Stanford researchers working in
Winslow Briggs's lab have found
the gene that makes plants grow to
ward sunlight. But the gene, called
NPHI, does more than regulate
plant responses to light. I he protein
made by the NPIII gene contains a
domain, or a segment, that is also
found in a variety of organisms
ranging from bread molds and bac

teria to human beings and mice.
"It's amazing that (the domain]
shows up in the most primitive bac
teria and advanced mammals and in
almost everything in between,"
Briggs said. The findings were pre
sented in a December Science paper
authored by postdoctoral fellows
working in Briggs's lah at the Stan
ford-based Carnegie Institution of
Washington's Department of Plant
Biology. Briggs, whose research was
funded by the National Science
Foundation, is director emeritus of
the Carnegie Institution and a biol
ogy professor by courtesy.
Eva Huala,the lead author of the
paper, explained that the domain
was probably part of a precursor
protein long before plants, fungi,
bacteria and mammals diverged
from each other on the evolutionary
tree. "It's really fun to find some
thing like this because you know it's
important if it's been adapted and
modified in so many organisms,"
Huala said. Emmanuel Liscum.
Paul Oeller, In-Seob Han and Elise
Larsen were co-authors on the
paper.
In each organism, the common
domain found on the NPHI gene is
part of a different protein. In plants,
the domain helps mediate phototro
pism. or the growth of plants to
wards light. In other organisms, the
same domain helps proteins medi
ate responses to changes in oxygen
levels or voltage across cell mem
branes. Because the newfound do
main helps proteins respond to light,
oxygen and voltage levels, the do

main has been dubbed "LOV" by
Briggs's lab.
Nobody is quite sure how the
NPI 11 protein makes plants lean to
ward the light. But the Carnegie re
searchers suspect that the protein
regulates a cascade of events that
eventually causes the plant hor
mone auxin to distribute itself un
equally between the light and shad
ed sides of a plant stem. Because
auxin inhibits growth, the side of the
stem with more auxin should grow
slower than the side with less auxin,
and the plant stem should curve to
wards the light.
An initial step in the regulatory
pathway probably involves the
movement of electrons across mem
branes of cells containing the NPHI
protein. This movement of elec
trons could cause NPHI to change
its shape and its function, activating
further electron transport events.
The last step in the process would
cause auxin to move from the dark
side of the plant to the light side, so
that the plant would bend toward
the light as it grows.
How did Briggs and his postdocs
isolate the NPHI gene? First, they
searched for a mutant plant that did
not exhibit phototropism and also
did not contain the NPH I protein.
Next, they studied these mutant
plants to find out what part of their
genomes contained the gene that
coded for the NPHI protein. After
they found the NPH I gene, they se
quenced it to find out what amino

acids it contained. Then they com
pared NTH 1 's amino acid sequence
to cither organisms' known protein
sequences using a database called
Genßank.
Surprisingly, the researchers
found that other organisms contain

protein domains that are 36 per
cent to 56 percent similar to the
LOV domain in the NPHI protein.
Briggs explained that scientists dis
agree on how similar proteins have
to he before they are considered
related. "But when a protein amino
acid sequence is, say, 30 percent
identical, virtually everybody
would agree that the similarity is
highly significant — especially with

organisms far apart on the evolu
tionary scale, like primitive bacte
ria and fruit Hies."
Briggs and Huala agreed that of
the most exeiting part of researching
NPHI has been the discovery that
the LOV domain is found in so man\
other distantly related organisms.
"It's an ama/ing piece of evolution
ary conservation," Briggs said.
Briggs has been "fascinated and

puzzled" by the phenomenon of
phototropism since 1957. when the
lirst paper on unequal auxin distrib
ution in plant stems after uneven ex
posure to light was published. He
said the best part of his new research
was not only his participation in a
"rapidly developing and exciting
story, but also the opportunity to
work with a group of gifted postdoc
toral fellows.
