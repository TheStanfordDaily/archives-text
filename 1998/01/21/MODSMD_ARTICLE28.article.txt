eDear Health Forum,
I here are often many
ads and promotions about
diet pills and supplements
and how good they can he for us.
Which ones should we he taking
and which should we stay away
from?

A Dear Jolie,
You aren't alone in the
contusion regarding the
real facts about dietary
supplements and related pills. As
a matter of fact, over the past few
years, what can and can't be called
a "dietary supplement" has been
embroiled in a big Congressional
debate with Sen. Orrin Match
leading the charge to dispel fraud
ulent claims. There has been ex
tensive legislature written since
1990 regarding these issues, and
you can read these laws verbatim
tin the Internet.
Last year alone, the Food and
Drug Administration (F I)A)
banned 111 ingredients in over
the-counter diet products, includ
ing certain amino acids, cellulose
and grapefruit extract. Manufac
turers were unable to provide
clinical data that proved their
products worked. Several prod
ucts with guar gum were also re
called because they "posed seri
ous health risks" according to the
FDA. Those products included
Cal-Ban 3(KH), C'al-Lite 1000, Cal-
Trim 5000, Perma Slim. Bodi
Trim, Dictol 7 Plus. Medi Thin,
Nature's Way and East Indian
Guar (ium. The guar gum in these
products is supposed to swell
while in the stomach to provide a
feeling of satiety or fullness. Un
fortunately, the swelling from the
guar gum in these products
caused throat and stomach block
ages.
As far as diet pills and appetite
suppressant pills are concerned. I

would probably steer clear of
them. Many have caffeine in addi
tion to their active ingredients,
and your body is capable of build
ing up a tolerance to such pills,
which is usually the case. And
anything that promises to melt
away fat based on some secret in
gredient or formula is a complete
waste of money. Every Sunday
paper coupon pullout has at least
one advertisement for such a mir
acle product. The claims just
aren't true. Many of these compa
nies are preying on desperate in
dividuals to provide them with
their sales. There are only two
ways of making fat leave the body
burn it off with exercise and a
healthy diet, or have it cut out via
surgical intervention (e.g. liposuc
tion, stomach stapling or intesti
nal bypass).
eDear Health Forum,
What are antioxi
dants? I keep hearing
mixed claims and wonder
if I should start taking them. Can
you shed some light on the sub
ject?

A Dear PJ,
Antioxidants are any
number of synthetic or
natural substances (e.g.
vitamins A, ( and B:) that are able
to stop the propagation of free
radicals in our bodies. A free rad
ical is a molecule that has an un
paired electron in its outermost
electron shell. This electron is po
tentially "free" to react with any
thing it comes in contact with.
Free radicals often grab electrons
from neighboring atoms to pair
with the free electron, to the detri
ment of our bodies. Over the long
run.and on a larger scale, free
radical damage is thought to
cause various harms to the body
such as speeding up the aging
process and causing various cell or

tissue damage, among other poten
tial harms under study.
Free radicals are formed from
many different reactions in the
human body. One of the most com
monly known free radicals is Su

peroxide. or rather, an oxygen mol
ecule with an unpaired reactive
electron. When a free radical such
as Superoxide takes an electron
away from another atom, that sec
ond atom becomes a new free radi
cal. Ihe new free radical goes in
search of another atom from which
it will steal an electron, and the
cycle repeats itself.

Antioxidants have the capability
to quench free radicals without
forming new ones, so it is important
that we eat a variety of foods as part
of a healthy diet to ensure that we re
ceive the Recommended Daily Al
lowances of our vitamins. If we
aren't able to quench free radical
propagation, new free radicals will
continue to form, destroying cells as

they take electrons from them.
Whether or not you should sup
plement your diet with a multivita
min or specific antioxidant supple
ment should be determined on an in
dividual basis after a long discussion
with your doctor or dietitian. The di
etitians at Cowell Student Health
Center can advise you as to your in
dividual needs.
