A Stanford researcher working
with members of several different
institutions has discovered a neuro
transmitter that may provide in
sight into the function of the hrain.
In the Jan. 6 issue of Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sci
ences, Thomas Kilduff. a senior re
search scientist and the director of
the Stanford Center for Sleep and
Circadian Neurobiology, describes
the neurotransmitters â€” called
hypocretins.
The discovery of a new neuro
transmitter is a major finding.
"There are billions of nerve cells,
but only a few neurotransmitters,
about 50, are known. Any time a
new one is discovered, it is a major
issue. We will know more about
how the brain works," said Kilduff.
He added that the discovery could
provide insights into various dis
eases.
The hypocretin protein is cut
into two smaller fragments, called
"peptides." in nerve cells. One of
these peptides, hypocretin 2. is the
main focus of the researchers' at
tention.
Neurotransmitters function bv
attaching to a neuron, causing an
electrical signal to be fired across
the cell. When the signal reaches
the other side, another neurotrans
mitter is released and the process
begins again.
Hypocretin 2 fulfills the three
criteria necessary to be classified as
a neurotransmitter. It is produced
in nerve cells, and it is stored in spe
cial compartments called vesicles

within the nerve cells. Hypocretin 2
also causes neurons to send an elec
trical message when it is added to
them in culture.
Part of the reason that re
searchers were interested in the
hypocretins is that they are made in
a specific region of the hypothala
mus that hiis been linked to control
of food intake and the cessation of
hunger. Hypocretins are made only
in the hypothalamus, a small part of
the brain that regulates fluid bal
ance, body temperature, reproduc
tion and certain metabolic activities.

Researchers now hvpothesi/c
that the neurotransmitter is in
volved in the food consumptior
process. There has even been spec
ulation that the neurotransmitter i*
involved in weight control, al
though there is no proof of it at this
time.
According to Kilduff. the next
step is "figuring out what the tunc
tions of these molecules are. testing
the hypothesis that they are in
volved in food intake and examin
ing whether a dysfunction in the
molecule or the gene can lead tu

disease."
One method of testing the func
tion of hypocretins is to observe the
effects of excess hypocretins or the
lack of hypocretins on mice or rats
The importance of the finding is
underscored h\ the number of re
searchers working to characterize
this neurotransmitter. Christelle
Peyron and Chiaki Fukuhara. both
Stanford postdoctoral fellows. ;in
well as researchers from several
other institutions, notably Scripps
Research Institute in San Diego,
are involved.
