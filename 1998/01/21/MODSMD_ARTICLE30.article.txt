Researchers examine antimitotic drills
Asst. Chemistry Prof. Thomas J. \\ andlcvs has made
considerable prioress toward understanding not onlv the
mechanisms hv which certain anti-cancer druus work hut

has also made new discoveries about normal cell processes,
Specifically, Wandless analyzes drugs that prevent cancer cells from di
viding. These drugs are called "anti mitotics" because they interrupt the

stage called mitosis, in which the cell divides \\ hen .1 normal cell divides, it
uses structures within it called "microtubules" to pull its chromosomes
apart so each daughter cell will have a copv ol the original genetic material.
Antimitotic drugs hind to the microtubules, preventing division ot the
chromosomes, so the cell cannot divide. When the cell cannot divide, it
commits "apophysis." a process in which the cell kills itsclt I lowcvcr. sci
entists have still not found a reason why the cell kills itscll when it can no
longer divide. It has been only 111 the past century that significant progress
has been made in the discovery and analysis of these drugs
Consequently. Wandless examines not only how the drug prevents divi
sion but furthermore, how an arrest in cellular division signals the cell to
commit "cellular suicide." If scientists can understand how these drugs in
teract with the cells, they can use this information to produce even better
drugs against cancer.
Research may also reveal fundamental insights into the basic nature of
cellular pnvevscs, and more profound discoveries can be made ;ibout the
understanding and treatment of human diseases. Wandless' research has
the potential to reveal discoveries that could save countless lives.
