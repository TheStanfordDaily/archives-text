# Daily staffers 'think' Lee will be next editor
## 
### Channing Miller Isn't named Elizabeth 
Currencies throughout Asia went into a
dramatic rebound last night as junior Therese
Lee returned from studying in Hong Kong to
win a grueling three-way race to become the
editor in chief of the paper's 213 th volume.
Lee had earlier caused consternation
among the staff by running on both a platform
calling for "A Thinking Paper" and also
promises of constant hip-hop music and lots
and lots of free food.
She explained that the slogan had closely
beaten out "A Drinking Paper" and "A Kinky
Paper" as her campaign motto.
The remainder of Lee's election program
was composed entirely of things she learned on
a recent trip to southeast Asia.
"Man. before that trip. 1 didn't know which
wax was up." said Lee, who is still working on
the difference between right and left.
In addition to the direction of gravity. Lee
said her trip to the mountains of Thailand
taught her patience, contemplation, and what
kind of berries really taste nasty. She claims
now to be able to survive months in the wilder
ness with only a nail file, a magnifying glass and
a Pez dispenser.
Staff members, however, declined her offer
to demonstrate how to skin a squirrel in under
30 seconds.
Lee won a run-off election against former
KGB double agent Brian Singer by a margin of
55 votes to 35. In an earlier round of the elec
tion. she and Singer had eliminated third can
didate Pat Bernhardt.
The new editor is the shortest person to run
for editor in chief since a write-in candidacy for
Gary Coleman failed by seven votes in 1983.
Lee has climbed the Dailv ladder over the

past two years, as news produetionist, beat
writer, news editor and columnist, but recently
admitted to the staff that at no time in those
years had she had a single productive thought.
A comprehensive examination of the job
descriptions of Daily editors later revealed that
no one on the payroll is expected to think.
"You want to think, write for''The Thinker,'
because this is definitely the wrong place for it."
said current editor in chief Carolyn Sieeth.
"If everyone here started thinking, how
would we fill the correction box?" said Daily
managing editor Adam Kemezis. who admit
ted that in his leisure time he sometimes thinks
about beer.
Lee hopes to change that.
"1 plan to take whatever steps are necessary
to get this staff thinking," she said. "Guest
speakers, strong drugs, day-long staff work
shops. field trips to the statue in front of Meyer
Library — whatever it takes to create the envi
ronment of a 'thinking paper." We've got to get
people thinking about thinking."
When asked to pin herself down to specific
goals. Lee could think of only one.
"We have to sever all contact with the
ASSU," she said. "They're the biggest hinder
anee to thought on this campus."
Her conversion to cogitation occurred on a
recent trip to Thailand, where she had her first
bona fide thought.
"It was something along the lines of' Christ,
these noodles are spicy." " said Lee.
In addition to her many past proofs of devo
tion to the Daily, Lee went above and beyond
the call of duty by agreeing to write a news story
on the day of the election. She drew the line,
however, at driving to the event in question in
Kemezis' '87 Volkswagen, even though she
learned to drive stick on her recent trip to
southeast Asia.


Neil Patrick Harris — Daily
Junior Therese Lee hits the bottle with a vengeance
after learning that a whole bunch of people thought
she was serious about running for Daily editor in
chief. She in fact won the election, and will head the
Daily's Volume 213.
