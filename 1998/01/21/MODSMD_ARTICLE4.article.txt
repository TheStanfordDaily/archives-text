### Kelly Young Staff writer 
Prospective students face stiff competition this
year as record numbers applied to join Stanford's
Class of 2(X)2. Freshman applications numbered
1K.714 this year, a figure up II percent from last
year's 16.K42 applications.
"It means that Stanford is on the minds of a lot of
people." said Hob Kinnally, dean of undergraduate
admissions and financial aid. "and it should be."
Early Decision I. with a deadline of Nov. 1. boast
ed 1.579 applicants. The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions sent acceptance letters to 409 of them
on Dec. 12. The remaining 1.170 applicants were ei
ther rejected or deferred for consideration with reg
ular applicants.
The Admissions Office also received 1.64b appli
cations for Early Decision 11. with a deadline of Dec.
1. The office will notify these applicants in the first

week of February.
By the Dec. 15 deadline. 15.459
applications had been received in
the regular admissions pool com
pared to last year's 14,336 applica
tions.
Kinnally credited Stanford's
award-winning faculty — including
14 Nobel laureates — for drawing
substantial attention to the I Jniver

sity.
"Many Stanford faculty are the
experts that the press looks to
when sorting through big issues —
economics ... politics," Kinnally
said. "That captures the attention
of a nation of students applying to
college."
High-profile professors may not
be the only people to catch the eyes
of prospective students.
"There was a lot of press around
(Chelsea Clinton] coming to a
place called Stanford," he admit
ted. "Here is a famous high-school

student who chose wisely and came
to Stanford."
While'the University's recent
publicity has resulted in an increase
in applicants, Kinnally also cited
the help of alumni and current stu
dents' parents who have become
more involved in meeting prospec
tive students.
The Admissions Office has had
to hire more help to sort through
the surplus of applications.
The publicity also has other
ramifications, including a poten
tially higher yield rate — the per

centage of accepted freshmen who
choose to enroll.
Last year, 64 percent of the ac
cepted students actually enrolled.
"This year, we're thinking it
might be slightly higher with a I to
5 percent increase in yield," Kin
nally said. "We're admitting stu
dents with this in mind."
Kinnally said his office is aiming
for an incoming class size of 1.610.
consistent with that of previous
years. He anticipates an accep
tance rate of 13 to 15 percent com
pared to last year's 15 percent rate.
