### Alice Lah 
Those who have been personally
involved with abortion often be
come the most active pro-life advo
cates. according to two speakers
who presented their painful histo
ries last night at a student-sponsored
anti-abortion forum in Cubberly
Auditorium.
Wendy I loag. a representative of
the Northern California Organiza
tion for the Victims of Abortion,
and Dr. Peter Lu of the Stanford
School of Medicine, told of their
conversions to tin- pro-life move
ment at a Stanford Students for Life
forum. Their speeches were fol

lowed by a presentation of the con
troversial film "Eclipse of Reason."
which graphically portrays an actual
abortion procedure.
Horn in Palo Alto and raised in
Los Altos. Hoag described her life
growing up as conservative and pru
dent. Once out of high school, how
ever. a date rape led to her first preg
nancy.
Hoag remembered learning of
her pregnancy as a "numbing. blurr\
experience."
With the help of a friend. Hoag
opted to get an abortion at a nearby
clinic, and recalled how the several
women with her were led "like cat
tle" from the waiting room into the

operating room.
"Each woman went in and came
out with the same reaction. They
were all cry ing." Hoag said. "There
was this incredible sense of loss."
After her first abortion. Hoag be
came increasingly promiscuous
"No longer was 1 protecting or re
specting my body."
She became pregnant three more
times and ended each with an abor
tion.
"M> life began to go into a spiral
1 lost control. I looked fine on the
outside, but in the inside. I was
dving." Hoag recalled. "In the mid
die of the night, I would dream of ba
bies."
Eventually, Hoag "hit bottom"
and began to reevaluate her life.
She married her boyfriend and they
had three children together. After
having her own children and realiz
ing what she had given up through
her abortions, Hoag became active
ly involved in the pro-life move
ment.
"I feel like I've by-en given a sec
ond chance," she said.
"The abortion experience is hor
rible for women and relationships,"
Hoag said. "Society suffers from the
dysfunction resulting from abor
tion."
"The only thing that matters, that
brings meaning and civility into your
life, is children," she said. "The fruit
of the womb is an incredible gift."
I loag was followed by Lu, a clini
cal instructor of dermatology at the
medical school.
Born in Taiwan, where abortion
is legal, Lu said lie remembered how
his mother decided to abort her sec
ond and third children.
After moving to America. I u
continued to view abortion as "a
form of birth control."
Graduating with a bachelor's
from C'a I tech and a medical degree
from the University of Washington,
L.u spoke of the college years as a pe
riod when "we begin to examine

what is true and what isO I true."
During his medical school years,
Lu's girlfriend became pregnant.
While he always viewed abortion as
the woman's choice, L4l admitted his
extreme relief when flhy, chose to
abort.
"In retrospect. I was a coward. 1
participated in the event, but I didn't
want anything to do with it,"he said.
He also remembered the nega
tive psychological effects of abortion
011 his girlfriend. Eventually, the two
broke up.
"I found myself always thinking
of what the baby would'vl been like.
The thought kept creeping up on
me," Lu said.
"Abortion is murder Â«t the most
heinous level, the murder of a help
less child who cannoraefehd itself."
"I invite you all to make a deci
sion 011 this issue, before emotions
become involved," he said. "As a so
ciety. we will continue to take away
lives."
The recorded estirriafe of abor
tions in the United States from 1972
to the present tops 30 million, the
speakers said.
Lu's speech preceded "Eclipse of
Reason." which showed an abortion
procedure during the thidl trimester
of pregnancy using the "dilation and
evacuation" technique.
The presentation was funded by
the ASSIJ, which also funded anoth
er speech sponsored by the Students
for I Jfe organization last fa)l quarter.
About 35 students attended yester
dav's event.
