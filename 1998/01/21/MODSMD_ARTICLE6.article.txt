## Barbie finds a home in Palo Alto museum 
### Cara Pulick 
With green vinyl chairs, a single
string of dim Christmas lights, and
floor-to-ceiling Plexiglas cabinets,
it's not exactly Barbie's Dream
House. Hut it is her home.
"Are you here to see Barbie?
the man at the far end of the corridor
asks visitors pushing open the door
at 433 Waverley St. Here, in down
town Palo Alto, sharing space with
Areon Hearing Services, is the Bar
bie Hall of Fame
In the nearly 14 years since the
Hall of Fame's inception, it has
amassed more than Barbies
one of the largest collections in
the world. And it is an impressive
sight. Hardly a square inch of the
narrow corridor and adjoining nx>m
that make up the Hall is free of
something Barbie.
Life-size versions of Barbie and
Ken greet visitors. Barbie pho
tographs and portraits adorn the
walls, and Barbies appear to frolic in
Barbie communities — they play the
piano, swim in pools, and even fl\ in
airplanes suspended from the ceil
ing.
Barbies here represent the better
part of four decades, countless occu
pations, and innumerable ethnici
ties. Roller Skate Date Ken. Puerto
Rican Barbie, and Allan with l.ight
Blue Slippers are among the thou

sands of dolls packed elbow-to
elbow on the Hall's hundreds of
shelves.
Some Barbies are clearly more
glamorous than others. At least in
title. Painted-Hair Ken cannot hold
a candle to Ken Fashion Pack
'Cheerful Chef.' Likewise, the ap
peal of Very Small Head Barbie
probably does not match the blazing
yellow-sequined glory of lWs's
Goddess of the Sun.
The Hall of Fame was founded
by its owner Evelyn Burkhalter.
Long before the idea for a Barbie
Hall of Fame hH>k shape. Burkhal
ter — a self-proclaimed doll-lover —
was picking up Barbies at flea mar
kets and garage sales. As Burkhal
ter's collection grew, so did the idea
that Barbie was not just a toy. but a
collectible. And in IW4, she opened
the Hall of Fame.
Burkhalter describes the Hall as
"a trip down memory lane." Any
one who remembers longing as a
child lor Kissing Barbie with Lip
stick or the Barbie Ultra Vette will
agree with her. The chronological
arrangement of the collection helps
the memory along in its trip. The vis
itor can begin with the original IW
Barbies and continue until she sees
that model of Barbie which is first in
his or her memory .
