"THE ROCK IS ON A ROLL
Prudential Securities Wins Back Investment Banking Business
"It's not just a case of the firm riding the market. By focusing on medium-size companies
in select industries, Prudential has boosted its market share in everything from initial
public offerings to high-yield bond underwriting to mergers and acquisitions.
'This will probably be the best year Prudential ever had in investment banking,'
says securities industry analyst Perrin Long."
Crain's New York Business, October 27, 1997

In no other investment bank this size can an incoming professional
make his or her mark as quickly as here at Prudential Securities.
We're a bank on the move and we have in place a strategy that offers
you unique career opportunities.
We've directed our focus on key industry sectors: Consumer Products, Energy, Financial
Services, Health Care, Real Estate, Technology, and Telecommunications/ Media. And we've
aligned our research to match. This focus allows us to consistently deliver to our clients greater
knowledge, better ideas, and more industry and product expertise, which translates into the
best possible execution in the market. And the results have been dramatic.
There are no limits to the kinds of deals we can do, or the size of the
companies we work with.
We help our clients raise capital through public and private equity financing, public and pri
vate debt finance and high-yield and asset-backed securities. We also act as financial advisors in
mergers and acquisitions.
We win against the so-called giants of the industry —"bulge-bracket" firms — because
of our industry specialization. And we beat industry specialty firms because of our broad product
array and our capability to sell and distribute securities to institutions and individuals through
out the world.
This win-win strategy puts you right in the middle of some of the most exciting action on
Wall Street, and gives you the chance to grow as rapidly as we are.
We want you to help us build a bank, not merely maintain a franchise.
You'll work on small deal teams where you'll interact with senior investment bankers.
You'll often deal directly with the top management of our client companies. And you'll be given
tremendous responsibility early on.
So if you're the kind of person who can perform like a banker, think like an entrepreneur
and want to find out how good you really are, Prudential Securities is the place for you.
