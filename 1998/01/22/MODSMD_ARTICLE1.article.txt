# Here's where the wild things are
## Birdlovers flock over campus' feathered fare

Stanford's strikingly natural
and open campus makes it a haven
for wildlife, but not just for the rac
coons and certain amphibians that
get most of the attention. From
Lake Lagunita to Palm Drive.
Stanford is host to a diverse and
beautiful population of birds, rang
ing from raptors to tiny humming
birds. Seemingly less evident than
stinky skunks or fearless squirrels,
the avian life at Stanford is a hid
den treasure that deserves to be
observed and appreciated.
The best known bird at Stan
ford is probably the raucous scrub

jay. formerly called the California
blue jay. Scrub jays will eat almost
anything and are known for their
noisy chattering.
Senior Uma Karmarkar re
counted her close encounter with
the scrub jay. "I was studying at my
desk on the third floor of Otero
frosh year and the window was
open ... I turned around to find a
huge bluejay tearing pieces off of a
blueberry muffin sitting on top of
our fridge.
"When I turned around it
cocked its head at me and Hew
away with a piece bigger than its
head. Two minutes later it was
back. It visited me eight or nine

times that day, nearly demolishing
the muffin. By the end of the day it
was friendly enough to shriek at me
when it caught me looking."
The western bluebird shares col
ors with the jay. but not its raucous
manner. Small and red-breasted,
they feed primarily on insects, drop
ping from perches to catch their prev
or catching them in the air. These
bluebirds are also found eating
mistletoe berries in oak trees, help
ing the spread of this parasite.
In 1931 Stanford orthinologist
John B. Price wrote, "California
quail roosts in the palm trees of the
Inner Quadrangle, feeding in the af
ternoon on the ground at the sides of
the Church. Another Hock always
roosts in the two palms by the park
ing space just north of the Art
Gallery."
These days any quail visiting the
Farm would probably be run over in
the frantic morning bike commute.
The little, plumed creature is Cali
fornia's state bird and still exists in
the Bay area, but is no longer avail
able for close observation on cam
pus. Available open space for many
birds has been reduced through the
years by building projects at Stan
ford and the urbanization of Silicon
Valley.
In addition to lost habitats, many
of Stanford's small birds, especially
those with easily accessible nests, are
threatened by the feral cat popula
tion.
Cliff swallows may have a better
chance than many of avoiding feline
predators because they build their
mud nests high off the ground, often
in the rafters of the Quad. Almost
pod-like, the nests are attached to
the side of the building and can last
for years, frugally recycled by new
comers every nesting season. Swal
lows can be seen swooping and div
ing through the air from various
classrooms in the Quad.
Everyone on campus has proba
bly noticed the woodpeckers. As vi
brant and almost as frequently seen
as jays, they're usually spotted cling
ing high in the palms. Stanford's
black, white and red-headed variety
is the acorn woodpecker, which ap
preciates the campus' many oaks.
The bird collects the acorns, storing
them in holes which they drill in
trees.
At night, near the center of cam
pus. you can frequently spot a pair of
barn owls swooping around the post
office and diving in for their dinner
at the Law School. The ivy surround
ing the Law School makes good —

but not good enough — cover for ro
dents, and other owl treats. Native to
most of the I 'nited States, barn owls
might also enjoy a taste of the hats
that live in the rafters of Green Li
brary.
The barn owl shares the night
with its cousin, the great horned owl,
a much larger bird with ear tufts and
serious hunting skills — these owls
have been known to bringdown prev
as large as a great blue heron.
The great blue heron is one of the
most dignified and striking birds to
visit Stanford's campus. Arriving
seasonally on the shores of Uike l.a
gunita, the herons usually take up
residence near the Elliot Program
Center and stand stock still, on one
leg, then the other, waiting to catch
their dinner. Standing about four
feet tall, and sporting a long tuft on
the back of the head, they feed hap
pily in the shallow water of the lake,
usually on small fish, frogs or other
birds.
"I saw a heron this summer on the
lawn behind Mirrielees. It was awe
some. He was just walking around
chilling," said junior Chandra Chris
tenson. 'i love [birds], except for the
ones that sing at night when I'm try
ing to fall asleep."
Bigger, noisier or particularly
common birds get the most atten
tion. but Stanford also hosts a range
of other small birds, including
Anna's hummingbirds (males are
identified by their iridescent red
heads), California thrashers (angry
looking brown birds with long,
curved black beaks), spotted
towhees (black and orange, with or
ange eyes), western robins (red
breasted herald of spring), various
sparrows, and waterfowl, most com
monly mallard d':.KS.
Freshman Dorian Anderson hif.
been observing birds for more than
11 years. Since arriving in California,
he's seen a long list of new birds. "I
was really excited to see a black-
Footed albatross when I first came to
visit Stanford. Seeing a golden
crowned sparrow was kind of cool
too," he said.
For serious bird-watchers or in
terested amateurs, Anderson advis
es, "Always buy the best optics you
can. Take time to watch birds and
watch what they do. And never dis
count the possibility of what a bird
could be. Rare birds are everywhere.
Don't give up t<x> easily,"
With or without binoculars, keep
an eye out. You may be surprised
and excited to discover what lives in
the air above us.
