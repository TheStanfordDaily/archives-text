## 
### Shalini Bhargava Contributing writer 
In an effort to spark a discussion
of provocative race and gender is
sues. the Delta Sigma Theta and
Delta Delta Delta sororities spon
sored a dialogue on women and race
at Ujamaa last night. About 25
women attended.
Sophomore Stephanie Blossom,
a Tri-Delt and coordinator of the
event said the purpose of the dia
logue was to stimulate positive dis
cussion between the two sororities,
with the hope that progress made
during the dialogue would ripple out
to other Stanford students.
The dialogue began with a discus
sion of the concept of "sisterhood."
While some women said they didn't
feel connected to the idea of sister
hood. many shared their notions of
female solidaritv.

I'ri-Delt president Robin I'enold,
a senior, said her definition of sister
hood involves finding commonali
ties while accepting differences
among women of different back
grounds. Tenold also said that, in her
conception of sisterhood, there are
many levels of solidarity and that
finding common ground "even on ;i
superficial level can bring [women]
together."
Senior Ryan Bathe defined sis
terhood as a "tacit understanding
between women — being within an
inner circle, having levels of under
standing."
A major theme in the dialogue
was acknowledging the real differ
ences in the experiences of women,
even of those within the same racial
group, while simultaneously work
ing to build cultural understanding.
"If you think historically, we
[women] know each other a lot more

than we're letting on," Bathe said.
"We're coming from a position ol
not being empowered — that's
something we share collectively,
[and] we don't come [to Stanford)
unfettered from our collective past."
Bathe suggested that, by ac
knowledging a shared history in the
I 'nited States, women of both black
and white backgrounds can bring
discussion beyond traditional barri
ers. such as race.
Fabienne McPhail, director of
the Women's Center, emphasized
the need for participants to be emo
tionally vulnerable with each other
by discussing sensitive issues.
Reaching the emotional level,
McPhail said, is part of addressing
the complexities of sisterhood and
part of progressing to the next level
of discussion.
Although the dialogue pro
gressed without a consensus on the

definition til feminism, partieipants
shared their conceptions of the
word. One question raised early on
was why feminism is not a prevailing
theme in the African-American
community. Some African-Ameri
ean women responded that race was
much more part of their life experi
ence than was gender.
Others, including Blossom, cited
socio-economic differences as the
reason for the disparity in feminist
activism between white women and
black women, presenting race as a
social construct with little tangible
meaning.
The disparity in feminist activity.
Blossom said, "is about money; it's
about status. I'm not sure if feminism
addresses the needs of the communi
ties within the black community."
"1 think this campus deserves a
lot more activism on our part," Blos
som said.
