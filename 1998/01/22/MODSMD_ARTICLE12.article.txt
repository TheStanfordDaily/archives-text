## Pope arrives for visit to Cuba 
### 
HAVANA (A I®) — Pope John Paul
11. a "messenger of truth and hope,"
began a historie pilgrimage yesterday to
Cuba, land of hardship, embattled faith
and an aging, struggling revolution.
President Fidel Castro, dressed in a
double-breasted blue suit instead of his
usual fatigues, was among those waiting
to greet John Paul as the 77-year-old
pope slowly climbed down from his plane
after arriving at 4 p.m.
Four children, dressed in white, held
up a box of Cuban soil so the pontiff
could continue his tradition of kissing the
ground as he arrived.
"John Paul the Second! The whole
world loves you!" the crowd chanted.
For more than an hour, at the center of
world attention in the televised airport
ceremony, the white-clad pope and the
gray-bearded 71-year-old revolutionary
moved easily together. The Cuban leader
aided the bent and ailing pontiff, offering
his hand at the pope's elbow,
i 1
Things may not be so solicitous when
the two hold their substantive session
today.

Castro hopes the visit will gain stature
for his revolution and support for an end
to the more than 30-year-old U.S. eco
nomic embargo. I he Cuban church hopes
the visit will help expand its influence.
In his airport remarks, John Paul said
he was praying that Cuba "may offer to
everyone a climate of freedom, mutual
trust, social justice and lasting peace."
Castro s;nd if there have been difficulties
between the church and his revolutionary
government, "the revolution is not to
blame."
En route to Havana, the pope told
reporters aboard the papal plane that he
wants to hear from Castro "the lull truth
of his country, about relations between
church and state."
Standing at an airport lectern under a
blazing sun, the pope celebrated this
"happy and long-awaited day"and spoke
out on the U.S.-Cuban standoff that has
long isolated this communist nation.
"May Cuba, with all its magnificent
potential, open itself up to the world, and
may the world open itself up to ( üba." he
declared.

And he firmly endorsed what he called
the "legitimate desires" of the Roman
Catholic Church in Cuba — its quest for
more privileges under Castro's govern
ment.
"1 wish to say with the same force as at
the beginning of my pontificate: Do not
be afraid to open your hearts to Christ."
Allow him to come into your lives, into
your families, into society," he said.
Castro, in his address, denounced the
U.S. embargo as "genocide" and sought
to identify his revolution's ideals with
those of the church.
"Another country will not be found
better disposed to understand your felici
tous idea ... that the equitable distribution
of wealth and solidarity among men and
peoples should be globalized," said ("astro,
one of the world's last communist leaders.
Havana workers were given the after
noon off. on a sunny KO-degree day.and
many were bused to sites along the papal
route. Thousands lined Havana's streets
to cheer as the popemobile moved by in
John Paul's final public appearance ol the
day.
