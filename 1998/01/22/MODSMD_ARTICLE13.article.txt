# America Online claims 'human error'
## Breach of policy was due to 'unusual circumstances," spokesperson says 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — America
Online said "human error" caused the
breach of policy that disclosed to a Navy
investigator the identity of a senior sailor
now facing dismissal from the service as a
homosexual.
"This was a case of human error under
very unusual circumstances." AOL Inc.
said yesterday in a one-page statement.
"This clearly should not have happened,
and we regret it."
Also yesterday. Senior (Tiief Petty Offi
cer Timothy R McVeigh moved to save his
Navy career by tiling a case in federal court
in Washington. McVeigh charges the Navy
•pried into his personal affairs in violation
of an electronic privacy law and the mili
tary's "don't ask. don't tell" policy on gays
in the military.

The service began investigating
McVeigh last fall after a Navy spouse dis
covered information available through
AOL and apparently written by McVeigh
that indicated a sexual interest in young
men. McVeigh. 36. is a highly decorated
senior enlisted man with 17 years in the
service — three years shy of the 20 need
ed to retire with a pension. He is no rela
tion to the convicted Oklahoma City
bomber.
"1 don't have any bitterness against the
Navy at all." McVeigh said outside U.S.
District Court. "My only regret is that the
Navy is unwilling to follow regulations."
McVeigh, in dress uniform festooned
with rows of awards and medals on his
chest, stood at attention as U.S. District
Judge Stanley Sporkin entered the court

room. Later McVeigh changed into a busi
ness suit to speak with reporters, observing
a regulation against uttering public state
ments in uniform.
McVeigh's attorney. Christopher Wolf,
said the Navy "broke the law" against
wresting confidential information from
online services. He also contended the
Navy violated the Pentagon policy on gays
in the military, which prohibits open
homosexuality but bars the military from
try ing to discover a service member's sexu
al orientation.
Justice Department attorney David
Class argued that the law restricts
online services from giving up confidential
information but contains no limits on hovs
investigators can go about seeking infor
mation.
