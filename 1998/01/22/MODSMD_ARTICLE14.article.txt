## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) In dozens of
taped conversations now in the hands of
Whitewater prosecutors, a former White
House intern says she had an affair with Pres
ident Clinton and that he tried to get her to
lie about it. lawyers said yesterday. The pres
idem denied ihe allegations and expressed
outrage.
" There is not a sexual relationship." Clin
ton said firmly in a White House interview. 'I
did not ask anyone to tell anything other than
the truth. There is no improper relationship."
His comments capped a dramatic day for
Clinton and former White House intern
Monica S. Lewinsky, who was at the center of
a legal and media storm. Word of the new
investigation gripped the White House and
had political figures talking of possible
impeachment if the allegations were borne
out.
The investigation was prompted when
one of Ms. Lewinsky's friends, former White
House staffer Linda Tripp, provided tapes to
Whitewater Prosecutor Kenneth Starr in
which Ms. Lewinsky apparently claimed an
affair with Clinton and recounted conversa
tions she allegedly had in which Clinton and
his friend Vernon Jordan asked her to den>
the relationship in affidavit she gave in Paula
Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit, her attor
ney said.
In her affidavit. Ms. Lewinsky denied she
had an affair with Clinton. However, two
lawyers who demanded anonymity said she
describes the affair in no uncertain terms in
conversations tape-recorded secretly b\ her
friend and former White House colleague

Linda I ripp. Ihe lawyers said that in these
conversations Lewinsky said Jordan assisted
her in getting a new joh in New York in
recent months, around the time she was sub
poenaed in Paula Jones' case against ('linton.
" I he charges are not true." said Clinton,
"and I haven't asked anyone to lie." Asked
about the allegations during the day, first
lady Miliar) Clinton told reporters. "Certain
ly I believe they 're false. Absolutely."
Ms Lewinsky is scheduled to give a depo
sition in the Jones lawsuit Friday. Yesterday,
her I os Angeles-based attorney William
(iinsburg said, "at this time, she stands by her
declaration" in the earlier affidavit. He dis
cussed the stress his client was enduring. "In
her mind, it's a lose-lose situation and quite
ravaging in terms of what lolks think of her."
he said
The Tripp tapes were secretly recorded
and include do/ens of conversations in which
Lewinsky described in detail an affair so
intense that Clinton even left private mes
sages on her home phone, lawyers said.
Ms. Lewinsky was unavailable to com
ment. as was Jordan.
The unexpected intersection of the Jones
and Whitewater cases left the White House
grappling with fresh controversy and the
stakes were never higher.
" These are probably the most serious alle
gations yet leveled against the president."
said former Clinton counselor George
Stephanopoulos. "There's no question
that... if they 're true, they 're not only politi
cally damaging but it could lead to impeach
ment proceedings."
