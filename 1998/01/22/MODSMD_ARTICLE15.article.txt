WASHINGTON (AP)
Seeking to answer growing
criticism of multibillion-dol
lar bailouts of reeling Asian
economies, the Clinton
administration warned yes
terday of serious threats to
the U.S. economy and the
global financial system il the
crisis is not contained.
Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin said in the
administration's detailed
review of the Asian currency
turmoil that the administra
tion plans to call in the spring
an international meeting of
finance ministers to repair
the world's financial s\steni.
Rubin said Japan has an
"especially crucial role to
plav" to resolve the crisis by
jump-starting its own econo
my and cleaning up problems
in its banking system. He
welcomed statements by
Chinese officials that they
will not devalue their curren
cy, which economists feared
the Chinese might do to
combat the threatened loss

ol its export markets.
Rubin's remarks eame on
a day when separate reports
showed that the Asian erisis
has yet to atiect America's
trade deficit but is beginning
to impact on the well-being
of manufacturing firms.
The Federal Reserve, in
its latest surve\ of regional
U.S. economic conditions,
said yesterday the Asian cri
sis is being felt in most parts
of the country
"Manufacturers ;ind agri
cultural firms report weaker
exports to Asia, and there is
some evidence ot increased
competition from Asian
products in I S markets."
the central b.ink said, I'hc
economic status report will
be used when Fed policy
makers next meet on Feb. 3-
4 to set interest rates.
There is a widespread
belief that the central bank
will leave interest rates
intact, believing that the
dampening effects of the
Asian crisis will be enough

without rate increases to
slow I S growth and keep
inflation in check.
In his speech to students
at Georgetown University.
Rubin said so tar the Asian
crisis impact on the U.S.
economy was expected to be
modest, with continued
steady growth this year.
Hut he said complacency
b\ I S policy makers would
be wrong.
"The United States can
not turn its back on this erisis
in the hope that we will
remain insulated from its
effects and markets alone
will cure the problem."
Rubin said.
He noted that a third of
Is exports are sold to Asia
and 4t» percent no to devel
oping countries, including
those of I atin America.
"It the crisis were to
spread more broadK toother
emerging markets, then the
impact on American workers
and businesses could be
much greater." he said.
