Gotti arrested
WHITE PLAINS. N.Y. (AP)
— John Gotti Jr., who reputedly
succeeded his father as head of the
Gambino crime family, was arrest
ed yesterday on racketeering
charges that included tax evasion
and extortion from a topless danc
ing club.
In four federal indictments
naming 40 defendants, Gotti was
accused of diverse organized
crime activities both belore and
after his father was jailed in IW.
Also named in the indictments
was Denny McLain. the jailed for
mer baseball pitcher, who was
linked to Gotti through an alleged
telephone calling-card fraud con
spiracy.
Gotti, 33, surrendered quietly
on a Yonkers street to avoid a
media circus, according to his
lawyer, Richard Rehbock. U.S.
Attorney Mary Jo White said at a
news conference that 34 others
had been arrested, too. Authori
ties were searching yesterday for
the remaining five defendants.

Gotti pleaded innocent at the
federal courthouse in White Plains
and was held for a bail hearing Fri
day. If convicted on all charges, he
could face up to 20 years in prison.
"The indictment is nothing we
didn't expect," Rehbock said.
"Read between the lines, fellows.
It's a bit silly. It's a stretch."
PBS interviews Clinton
Nt-W YORK (AP) — Most
television networks would guard
with their lives an exclusive inter
view with the president on the day
he's accused of having an affair.
PBS gave theirs away.
Public Broadcasting Service
newsman Jim l.ehrer \sas the first
— and lor much of the day the
only — reporter to question Pres
ident Clinton about charges he
hail an affair with a White House
intern and tried to get her to lie
about it.
Prior to the interview, no other
news organizations had been able
to question Clinton direct I \ about
the allegations, which he denied.

Lehrer had scheduled the
interview before the charges were
made public, but rather than keep
his exclusive quiet until "New
si-lour" at 7 p.m., PBS informed
White House reporters of it
beforehand and allowed them to
watch it live via a television
hookup.
PBS also permitted competing
networks to broadcast up to a
minute ol the interview prior to
the start ol "News Hour."
For PBS. it was an opportunity
to gain publicity for the news
show, spokesman Bruce Lott said.
"We're not in direct competi
tion with most of our friends in the
media." he s;nd.
ABC. C BS and NB(' all used a
portion of the interview. ABC car
ried an excerpt of the interview
live, annoying rivals who s.nd thev
were under the impression PBS
did not vs.mt the networks to carry
the interview .is it happened.
()n a day the networks had set
aside to mark Pope John Paul IPs
visit to C üba, the Clinton storv
made tor some *H.ld juxtapositions.
