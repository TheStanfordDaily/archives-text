## Editorial Number of applicants soars More than positive press 
### 
Rise is indicative of
both positive press and
internal improvements

THE NUMBERS ARE finally in.and
more students than ever want to
come to Stanford. Applications for
freshman admission jumped by 11 percent
this year, for a total of more than I<S,7(K)
applicants. While the recent burst of media
attention is at least partly responsible for
the I niversitv's popularity, that is far from
the entire stor\. People across the country
and beyond are finally recognizing what
was true long before the hype began —
Stanford is an excellent place to go to
school.
Quality of education and quality of life
intersect at Stanford in an unrivaled way.
Where else can undergraduates find a
nexus of top-notch academics with strong
athletic programs and good facilities? And
who can forget the relatively generous
Northern California climate?
Additionally. Stanford's residential envi
ronment is exceptionally welcoming and
supportive. Hundreds of staff, faculty and
students put tremendous effort into making
the Stanford experience — whether aca
demic. personal or social — an uplifting
one. Few universities greet freshmen so
enthusiastically and even fewer continue to
dedicate themselves to the social and emo
tional needs of students at all phases of
their college experience.
Many undergraduates also have become
the beneficiaries of the highly acclaimed

Stanford Introductory Studies program,
where freshmen and sophomores can work
in a seminar setting with some of the most
distinguished members of the faculty.
These same faculty members also
deserve much of the credit for Stanford's
initial appeal to prospective students.
Claiming the world's highest honors in
many areas of scholarship, they serve as a
major source of expertise and analysis for
the popular and professional media.
While we all agree that there are always
ways that the University can belter serve its
constituents, we commend the administra
tion for its willingness to re-examine poli
cies and their effectiveness in meeting stu
dent needs.
Committee after committee labors tire
lessly all year to review and improve
departments, programs, curricula, resi
dences and safety. Within the last few years
alone. Stanford has altered its general edu
cation requirements, its language require
ment and programs, as well as the Area
One program. Recommendations for
changes in the housing assignment system
and in residential academic support are cur
rently being implemented.
Although we may complain that there
seems to be a committee studying almost
everything here, we recognize that what
makes Stanford unique is this commitment
to reforming itself in pursuit of excellence.
In short, there is a great deal more to
Stanford than the media hype portrays. If
recent exposure has brought the University
recognition, (his recognition has only been
reinforced the host of programs that make
the Stanford undergraduate experience a
nurturing and challenging one.
