It is stated in the Stanford Resi
dence Agreement that, "The keep
ing of pets of any kind in or about
University residences is prohibit
ed."
According to Diana Conklin,
nuinager of undergraduate resi
dence facilities, this rule protects
students with allergies and phobias
and prevents property damage.
However, Conklin acknowledges

that room inspectors do find pets
"from time to time."
You never know what might be
swimming, hopping, creeping or
crawling in the room next door, or

in your own. for that matter.
Junior Jen Lerner's freshman
roommate, Michelle, once '

brought home a tiny snake that

she'd found while jogging
up by the dish. She kept it >

in a Tupper-

ware

container in the center of their
room. According to Lerner.
Michelle hud the snake out on her
desk "playing with it or some
thing;" somehow, the reptile man
aged to crawl through a hole in a
nearby boombox speaker and be
came stuck. To keep the snake
from getting loose in the room.
Michelle sealed the entire speaker
in a box for a week. She finally had
to purchase a screwdriver and take
the speaker apart in order to re
move the animal, which she then
returned to the hills from whence it
came.
