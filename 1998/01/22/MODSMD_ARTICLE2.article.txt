Editor's note: Severn! of the stu
dents quoted in this story wish to re
main anonymous and will therefore
he referred to only hy fictitious first
names.
It is stated in the Stanford Resi
dence Agreement that, "The keep
ing of pets of any kind in or about
University residences is prohibit
ed."
According to Diana Conklin,
nuinager of undergraduate resi
dence facilities, this rule protects
students with allergies and phobias
and prevents property damage.
However, Conklin acknowledges

that room inspectors do find pets
"from time to time."
You never know what might be
swimming, hopping, creeping or
crawling in the room next door, or

in your own. for that matter.
Junior Jen Lerner's freshman
roommate, Michelle, once '

brought home a tiny snake that

she'd found while jogging
up by the dish. She kept it >

in a Tupper-

ware

container in the center of their
room. According to Lerner.
Michelle hud the snake out on her
desk "playing with it or some
thing;" somehow, the reptile man
aged to crawl through a hole in a
nearby boombox speaker and be
came stuck. To keep the snake
from getting loose in the room.
Michelle sealed the entire speaker
in a box for a week. She finally had
to purchase a screwdriver and take
the speaker apart in order to re
move the animal, which she then
returned to the hills from whence it
came.

Most pet owners, however, find that
their pets are a positive addition to
campus life.
Carol conceals a turtle, a yellow
bellied slider to be exact, beneath her
bed in a storage trunk turned habitat,
complete with rocks and ultraviolet
heat lamp. Carol has owned the tur
tle. Angela, for six years. Last year,
she entrusted Angela to a friend
back home, but the animal became
ill. So this year. Carol took Angela to
Stanford. Caring for Angela "is not
much work." Carol just feeds the tur
tle pellets from a pet store and
changes the tank's water once a
week.
According to Carol, the most dif
ficult aspect of keeping a turtle is
transportation to and from campus.
Because cold-blooded animals
aren't allowed on airplanes, Angela
must be smuggled aboard in Carol's
coat pocket. Once. Carol fell asleep
on the plane, and Angela escaped.
The animal was found and returned
bv a less-than-pleased flight atten
dant.
Wanda brought Speckles, a tropi
cal fire-belly toad, to Stanford in
early last October. Unlike Carol.
Wanda was granted permission by
her resident fellow. Owning Speck
les "is not a big issue because she
doesn't smell, she's clean, and she's
respectable, as far as animals go."
Bright green with red toes and a red

orange belly. Speckles is a "cool pet"
and a "great conversation starter."
Tiffany keeps Clyde the West
African sand boa constrictor in an
aquarium on her desk. "My RAs
kindly tell me." she says, "that as far
as they're concerned, there is no
snake in the dorm." Having a pet sig
nificantly enhances her Stanford ex
perience. "He's very low-mainte
nance. but he's verv affectionate.

Other people from the dorm come
over a lot to see him. He's quiet and
he doesn't smell, and he's helped at
least a dozen people get over snake
phobias."
So what happens when a student
is caught with a prohibited house
guest? Conklin explained that after
the first offense the student is asked
to remove the pet. If the student fails
to comply, then, as stated in Resi

dence Agreement, "you are charged
$1(K) per day until it is permanently
removed. You are also charged for
any damages caused by the pet or
any services required to remove the
pet if abandoned by you." According
to Conklin, implementation of the
"no pets rule" isn't difficult. "Stu
dents are usually very good about
complying once they've been
warned."
