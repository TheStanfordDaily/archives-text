## Stopping to Mel the Roses 
### 
For graduate
students who just
started at Stanford
this year, congratulations
on surviving your first
quarter and being well on
your way through the sec
ond. Making the transition

to graduate school can be quite difficult. Of
course, the very fact that you made it here
means you've obviously mastered the whole
college thing: during your undergraduate
years, you already learned how to write
papers, how to write tuition checks and how
to write home to ask for more money after
writing the tuition checks.
However, as you have surely learned,
graduate school is a completely different
kettle of fish. There are all sorts of new
questions and concerns. What should 1
write my thesis on? How can I be an effec
tive teaching assistant? Alter 1 finish this
degree, is there any other way I can delay
actually having to figure out what to do with
my life?
Let me reassure that such concerns are
normal, and you are not alone. Let me also
share a secret that only comes from years of
experience. There has been one continuous
source of guidance that has helped me
throughout my years at Stanford.
This all-knowing, all-telling oracle has
provided me with invaluable insight and
advice during the most trying and difficult
moments of my graduate student career —
more accurate than the Psychic Friends
Network, less controversial than The Bible
Code. more fun than a Ouiji board, less
cryptic than Yoda. Yes, as you have surely
guessed by now. I speak of the most power

ful entity on the planet. I speak of "Melrose
Place."
This seemingly benign force can actually
provide the answers to all of your questions.
It provides the secrets to unlocking success
at Stanford. Parenthetically, note that if you
shuffle the letters of this Monday night sta
ple you end up with "More Les Place." (All
right, so this doesn't really seem to mean
anything, but this just goes to show that its
mystic powers are far beyond mere human
comprehension.) The similarities between
"Melrose Place" and graduate student life
at Stanford are far too many to be mere
coincidence.
Melrose Place: The apartment building is a
sandstone building with a red tile roof. Grad
uate School: Every building at Stanford is a
sandstone building with a red tile roof.
Melrose Place: The characters represent an
interesting cross section of backgrounds,
interests and goals. Graduate School: Stu
dents represent an interesting cross section
of backgrounds, interest and goals.
Melrose Place: When they go to work,
they're writing advertising copy and reading
medical reports. Graduate School: When
they go to school, they're writing research
papers and reading journal articles.
Melrose Place: They're also experiencing
cliff-hanging danger, passionate romance
and exotic adventures. Graduate School:
They're writing research papers and read
ing journal articles.
Melrose Place: The program is on for one

hour, once a week. Graduate School: You'll
actually make decent progress on your dis
sertation for one hour, once a week.
When I face one of life's conundrums. I
turn to "Melrose Place" to help me make
sense of this wacky academic world.
Worried that you'll never make the tran
sition from lowly graduate student to assis
tant professor? Recall how Hilly moved
from cab driver to VP of D&D, or how
Sydney transitioned from stripper / hooker /
madam to boutique owner.
Troubled that you won't be able to hide
from your students your fear of leading sec
tion? Keep in mind how easily Kimberly dis
guised that nasty scar under that wig.
Not sure if you'll be able to balance all
your responsibilities? Remember how
Amanda can manage an apartment com
plex, run D&I) and finance "Upstairs."
Anxious about life after grad school?
Witness Courtney Thome-Smith on "Ally
Mcßeal." Concerned that your limited
background will keep you from persevering
at Stanford? Consider that Andrew Shue is
still on the show.
Yes. just as surely as Michael will hatch a
dastardly scheme or that Matt will never
have an on-screen kiss, you can find success
and happiness at Stanford. All it takes is
hard work, good colleagues, the wisdom of
the faculty and, of course, an hour of your
time every Monday night at 8 p.m. on your
local F( )X affiliate.
