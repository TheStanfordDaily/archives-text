Define meaning of
"human life"
In the Jan. 20th issue of The Daily, Garry
(irundy put forth his opinion on abortion,
stating that we should .. defend those
innocent children who continue to he mur
dered ..
Interestingly, throughout his opinion,
(irundy refers to embryos and fetuses (with
out ever using these two terms), as a "cluster
of cells." a "cluster of highly developed
cells." "children," "a human life," an "indi
vidual" and "a human being."
By defining embryos and fetuses as chil
dren. (irundv and others make the emotion
al argument that abortion is murder.
(irundy's misuse of words such as 'children,'
however, does bring up a central question to
any discussion of the rights to an abortion:
What are embryos and fetuses — are they
people or simple clumps of cells? or neither?
The answer to this question would allow
us. without resorting to emotional argu
ments. to determine what rights, if any.
embryos and fetuses should have, and how
they should be weighed against a woman's
right to her own body
Clearly, if we considered an embryo of
any age to be a person, then it should have
equal rights to any other person. On the
other hand, if we considered it to be a simple

cluster of cells, then it probably doesn't war
rant any rights. At some time during biolog
ical development between a clump of cells
and a child, a person occurs. We should
determine to the best of our ability when that
is and enact laws accordingly.
It should be noted that the clump of cells
that is the early embryo does not merit legal
rights simply on the basis that it is "human
life' or on the basis that it has the potential to
become a person.
Human life' is not the same as a person
(for example the skin cells on the tip of your
nose are human and alive but do not consti
tute a person). And in this new age of
cloning, many human cells (including the
ones at the tip of your nose) may be shown
to have the potential to become a whole per
son. So we cannot argue that just because an
embryo is alive, is human and has potential,
that it warrants any rights. Rights should be
granted to people.
There is a wealth of knowledge about
how embryos develop as well as when and
how brain development occurs in humans, a
point worthy of consideration for anyone
wanting to take a stance on either side of the
abortion issue (and who would like to avoid
accusing caring health care providers of
being murderers).
It seem that "blind medievalism" would
better refer to someone who disregards
knowledge and tries to use emotional argu

ments (such as a comparison to slavery!) in
trying to sway others into adopting his views.
Finally, regardless of the laws we choose
to put on the books, women will likely con
tinue to have abortions. And it is clear that
women who have illegal or self-induced
abortions are much more likely to die from
them. May I suggest to Grundy that, before
he makes further statements about what
rights of clumps of cells should have, that he
also consider the lives of these women.

Enough already —
Where's my yearbook?
It has been over a year and half since I
graduated from Stanford, and I still have not
received my 19% Stanford (Juad yearbook.
I sent in my $65 check (which was cashed) on
time, with the required information.
Throughout the past year. I have contact
ed the yearbook staff numerous times (e
-mails, phone messages, personal visits to the
Quad office) about my yearbook to no avail.
My inquiries were answered only once, by
last year's editor, who explained that the
yearbook was still being printed and would
not be ready until September 1997. That was
four months ago.

Of course, the excitement with which I
had once anticipated my 19% Stanford
Quad has long diminished. Looking through
a yearbook that is already almost two years
old is not the same as kx>king through it the
year of graduation.
My experience is not unusual. I know
many other 19% graduates who are also
finding it difficult (if not impossible) to
obtain their yearbook. Is this too much to
ask for?

Grundy supports female
enslavement
I must respond to (iarrv Grundy's col
umn of Jan. 20. As a righteous black man I
would expect him to have a better under
standing of the slave-owner relationship than
he demonstrates in his opinion piece.
As a scientist. I am well aware of the
dependence the developing ball of cells' has
on the mother, and without the mother there
is no development.
Roe v. Wade decision was made to free
pregnant women from the slavery of their
bodies; just because women bear the physio
logical burden of reproduction, it does not
have to be their destiny or purpose in life.

However, it seems that Grundy is advo
cating a return of women to the times when
they stayed home barefoot, pregnant and
unable to do anything but bear and care for
children — slaves to their 'man' and slaves to
their physiology.
The fundamental issue that h;is been
overlooked in all of these heated debates is
that as a society, and as scientists, we have
not demanded production of satisfactory
birth control' choices. Because of this,
women end up pregnant and, at times, des
perate to find an option that will not destroy
the rest of their life.
It is a documented fact that the number of
women dying from botched or home abor
tions drastically declined after the passage of
Roe v. Wade decision.
My guess is that a return to the illegaliza
tion of abortion will not drastically reduce the
number of fetuses killed but will certainly
increase the number of grown women killed.
Hut to Grundy, I suspect, it doesn't mat
ter. because we're just baby-producing slaves
anyway. Why is it that as a society you only
become outraged at a smoking, drinking
woman if she is pregnant? Why don't we all
behave perfectly and do the rational, sane
action in every situation?
Because Grundy, aside from your perfect
little smug chair, humans are imperfect and
