## A 						system gone astray? Reconsidering tenure 
### 
Joe Freund

THE DECISION MADE last year by
the Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences to deny tenure to then-Asst.
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta caused
great uproar throughout the Stanford com
munity. And the controversy has emerged
yet again as Asst. History Prof. Karen Saw
islak attempts to appeal the decision deny
ing her tenure. In light of continuing discon
tent with the esoteric tenure process, it is
worthy of note that the process has betrayed
the principles on which it was founded.
The tenure system used by virtually
every major university in the United States
was developed in response to an incident
that occurred at Stanford many years ago.
In 1901, Edmond Ross, a professor of eco
nomics who was known for his community
involvement and political activism, was
fired after having delivered speeches on the
treatment of Chinese immigrants that dis
pleased Jane Stanford.
Not surprisingly, Stanford faculty and
students were outraged by this, and seven
Stanford professors resigned in protest. This
led to the formation of a coalition of profes
sors from institutions throughout the coun

try. and this coalition eventually produced
the celebrated Declaration of 1915.
The Declaration of 1915 was designed to
protect the "principal tenets of academic
freedom," which included professors' rights
to become politically involved in their com
munities and to pursue unorthodox view
points and teaching methods. The declara
tion also proposed a system where profes
sors would be protected from dismissal
except in the cases of incompetence or dere
liction. This proposal was accepted by uni
versity administrations around the country,
and was instituted shortly thereafter.
Ironically, the tenure system now has an
entirely different effect here at Stanford. At
Stanford, where research is of paramount
importance, faculty seeking tenure are
judged primarily on the quality and quanti
ty of their research. Those who take the
time to get involved with the Stanford com
munity or who are engaged in non-tradi
tional (and less well-known) fields of study
are at a distinct disadvantage in theii pursuit
of tenure when compared to colleagues who
restrict their community involvement and
instead concentrate solely on traditional

research.
Thus, the tenure process, whieh was ini
tially designed to provide freedom for pro
fessors to hold diverse viewpoints and pur
sue unorthodox forms of involvement in
their communities, has now become a
mechanism that restricts professors to
research.
Given that Stanford cannot unilaterally
revolutionize the tenure process nation
wide. the question remains what can stu
dents, faculty, and administrators at Stan
ford do to improve the tenure process? In
attempting to answer this question, one
need only examine Gupta's battle for
tenure.
The turmoil surrounding Gupta's
tenure process was beneficial to no one.
The students involved in the campaign
spent hundreds of hours rallying support
for their cause: while their efforts were ulti
mately successful, their time could have
been spent elsewhere had the endorsement
of the Anthropology Dept. not been
reversed and Gupta been granted tenure in
the first place.
Certainly, Gupta himself did not benefit

from this ordeal — he was plaeed in the
unenviable position of not knowing where
his career would lead for several months.
In addition, the eventual reversal ot the
Dean of H&S's decision undermined the
credibility of the office and the tenure pro
ceedings. Moreover, the attention the ease
gained throughout the nationwide academ
ic community hurt Stanford's academic
credibility. Had Gupta been granted
tenure in the first place, this mess could
have been avoided.
The decision to deny tenure to Sauislak
has caused similar problems. Once again,
the University and one ol its faculty mem
bers are enmeshed in an unpleasant strug
gle. Once again, students have spent count
less hours fighting for a professor who they
feel is being unjustly treated. Regardless ol
the eventual outcome, a lot of energy that
could have been channeled elsewhere will
have been expended.
I believe that problems similar to the
ones surrounding the decisions to deny
tenure to Gupta and Sawislak could be
reduced, if not altogether eliminated, by
allowing students to have more input in the

tenure process. While I realize that students
have less knowledge and experience in their
fields than professors or administrators, stu
dents are able to offer a unique insights into
these deliberations.
No one is more connected to the overall
community o| Stanford than well-informed
students: these connections give students
the abilii\ to evaluate faculty not only on
the qualit\ of their research and teaching,
but on their contribution to the larger Stan
ford community as well.
B\ allowing siudents to participate in the
tenure process, thev will come to under
stand the system better and will be able to
inlluence tenure deliberations rather than
being forced to protest them after the fact.
Even il. in some situations, teachers gen
uinely loved by students aren't given tenure,
students will be less likely to engage in these
costly battles 1! the\ know that their opin
ions have at least been considered in the
process, (living students that opportunity
isn't too much to ask.
