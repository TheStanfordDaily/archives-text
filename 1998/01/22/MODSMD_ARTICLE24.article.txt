## College World Series or bust! It's no secret — Despite loss of Peterson, head coach Mark Marquess brings back the nation's top team 
### Brian Eule Contributing writer 
Several crucial things happened to
Stanford's baseball program be
tween the time it tied for third at the
College World Series last year and
the time head coach Mark Marquess
selected his starting lineup for Fri
day's season opener — the Cardinal
was selected as the consensus presea
son No. 1 team in the nation and was

the only team to land all three starting
pitchers on preseason Ail-American
teams.
The Cardinal also lost pitcher
Kyle Peterson.
"I think what we need to find out
is if somebody can replace a [pitcher
like] Peterson," Marquess said of the
1997 All-American. "Maybe not one
guy. but maybe two of our three can.
We're talented, especially in our
pitching staff, but we have to prove

we can replace Peterson."
Talented is perhaps an under
statement of Marquess' pitching staff
this year, which has been raved about
for much of the offseason. With Ju
niors Jeff Austin, Chad Hutchinson,
and Brent Hoard, Stanford has both
talent and World Series experience
on the mound. Yet, Peterson is still
missed.
"In reality, all three of those pitch
ers throw harder than Peterson,"
Marquess continued. "Hut none of
them are going to match his career
wins at Stanford. Certain guys just
have that ability. They just find a way
to win even when they don't have
good stuff and that's just what Kyle
Peterson did. That's what we are
looking for from one or two of them."
"I don't think any one of us can fill
jhis] big shoes," Austin said. "I think
you can maybe make up for it in dif
ferent ways."
There is little doubt that Marquess
plans to experiment with those differ
ent ways this season. The exact pitch
ing rotation may not be decided until
the weekend before league play be
gins in February. The depth of the
team as a whole, not just Marquess'
pitching staff, provides him with that
option.
"We are all pretty much on the
same page," Austin said of the talent
on this year's team. "There's not
much difference between the No. 1
guy and the No. 30 guy."
With All-Pacific 10 Conference
selections Jody Gerut and Edmund
Muth returning to the outfield, confi
dence is anything but lacking. A ju
nior. Gerut has started in every game
and averaged over .3(X) during each
of the past two seasons. Muth. a
sophomore, returns after hitting .3KB
his freshman year and being named
to Collegiate Baseball's Freshman

All-American team. He was not the
lone Cardinal to he given the presti
gious rookie honor, however.

Muth was joined by now sopho

West Regional MVP last year, will re
turn to third base after hitting 17
homers during the season, and senior
shortstop Jay Pecci returns after hit
ting .588 at the College World Series,
the third-best batting average in
CWS history.
"I have complete faith in even
body that's out there," Hutchinson
said. "I don't think there is a weak
spot in our lineup. We are that deep."
Perhaps the Cardinal's greatest
challenge this season will be its sched
ule. Facing three of the top 15 teams
in the country over the next four
weeks, and having four of its five con
ference opponents ranked in Colle
giate Baseball's Fabulous 4<) presea
son ranking. Marquess doesn't ex
pect Stanford to remain at No. 1 for
long.
"The conference is the strongest
it's [ever) been,"he said. "I think the
team that wins it will lose at least ten
games."
Add that to a tough non-league
schedule, and the Cardinal is facing
some difficult teams. Stanford can
forget the easy games of the past.

"You can't roll over any week,"
Hutchinson said. "If you're not on
the top of your game, you're going to
get beat."
At the same time, the schedule
could be a great asset to the CCardinal.
Facing teams like fifth-ranked Ari
zona State and No. 6 I JSC on the

road could prepare Stanford for an
other College World Series trip
"I think for that reason, (the
schedule'] is probabh the best tins
year." said Austin. "By playing those
Top 10 teams it will prepare us for the
