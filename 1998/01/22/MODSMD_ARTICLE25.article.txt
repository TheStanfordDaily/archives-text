While the Cardinal men's bas
ketball team confidently disposed of
Pacific 10 Conference opponent
UCLA at Maples Pavilion Saturday
afternoon, another Stanford team
was quietly, and just as confidently,
adding to their winning tradition
with a league win just a short dis
tance from Maples.
The Stanford rugby team defeat
ed opponent St. Mary's 33-24 at
Maloney Stadium in its Northern
California Rugby Football Union
opener.
After falling just short of a na
tional berth in the National Colle
giate Championships last May. the
men's rugby team has quickly begun
their new season with an impressive
5-0 start. Three of these victories
took place in the fall and two this
month. With this solid beginning,
the men's rugby squad has emerged
as an elite team exhibiting its own
undefeated season.
Despite their apparent success,
it's not quite certain yet how this
team compares to last year's. 1 hey
have decidedly set an appearance in
the Final Four as one of their goals
for the season, but acknowledge
that their are some obstacles and
challenges to overcome.
Coach Franck Boivert. who has
coached the Cardinal since the

19X9- l X) season, has emphasi/cd the
loss of key players due to gradua
tion. but is confidant that new play
ers will step up. Specifically, he is
looking to this years players to
strengthen the front row position
that was weakened by graduating
seniors. The new players in this po
sition. called "props" must work
hard to assure another year of suc
cess.
Despite these obstacles. Coach
Boivert s;iys he is exited to display
the talent that he believes his team
strongly possesses. Though gradua
tion took away many good players, a
lot of excitement and success is an
ticipated til returning players.
Senior Nathan Rundell. team
president Greg Guinney. and cap
tain Trung Ngo. who Boivert calls
"an outstanding player." are all ex
pected contribute greatly to this
year's season. Though citing these
specific players. Boivert is especial
ly pleased and optimistic for the sea
son because he truly believes that he
has "overall. 15 great players."
Rugby's next games will take
place this weekend when they take
their undefeated record on the road
to San Diego State Saturday, and
the University of San Diego Sun
day. The next home game will be
Jan. 31 where the Cardinal will com
