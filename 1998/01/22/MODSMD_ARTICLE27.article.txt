Home sweet home may take on a differ

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
â–  TONIGHT: No. 13 Stanford (8-5. 5-1 Pa
cific 10 Conference) vs. Washington State (8
6,2-3), 7:30 p.m. TV: None. RADIO: KZSU
FM (90.1), KBPA (1220 AM)

No doubt the advantages of the home
eourt will be present for the Cardinal's 7:30
p.m. contest against Washington State (8-
6. 2-3 Pacific 10 Conference), but the con
fines of Maples Pavilion could be even
more comforting when you consider the
fact that this will be the first weekend of
the quarter in which Stanford (8-5. 5-1)
will take homecourt.
"We have been traveling a lot." said
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "It feels
strange to be back home. This is the first
time that we've played with our students."
After two weeks on the road the Card
hopes to get things back to normal. The
trip saw Stanford's Pac-10 win streak come
to an end with a one-point loss to Arizona
before the Card bounced back with its first
two-game road trip sweep of the season in
Los Angeles.

But perhaps most important in the Car
dinal's two-win weekend against USC and
UCLA was the way Stanford stepped up
and fended off a late Bruin run in a 75-70
win over UCLA.
Free throws had been a major problem
in the Card's loss to Arizona, but this time
the Card demonstrated poise at the line,
going a perfect 14-for-14 over the final six
minutes of the game.
"Sometimes I feel like I'm a fire depart
ment." VanDerveer said. "We definitely
put out the free-throw fire in that game
But I don't think we played the type of de
fense we need to play, nor do I think wc
took care of the ball the way we need to."
Leading the way for Stanford in that
contest was Vanessa Nygaard. The senior
forward hit two clutch free throws with 3
seconds remaining and was near-perfect
from the line, going 9-of-10 for the game.
Nvgaard's play was exceptional all
weekend as the 6-foot-1 forward seemed
to take a more aggressive role in the Car
dinal offense. All told. Nygaard compiled
a total of 35 points on the weekend, in
cluding a game-high 22 against the Bruins
to go along with 12 rebounds.
"Everybody knows Vanessa is a great
three-point shooter." VanDerveer said.
"At USC 1 thounht she did a great job ol

UCLA's was perhaps the best
frontline Stanford has faced this
season so tackling a depleted
Washington State squad might not
he as challenging. The Cougars
only return two starters this sea
son, and senior center Yvonne
Kun/.e is the team's only experi
ence at the post.
Kun/e leads Washington State
with 13.1 points and 6.6 rebounds
per game. But Kun/.e has also got
ten some unexpected help from
freshman forward Alke Dietel
who is putting up 11.4 points and
4.5 rebounds per game in her
rookie season.
The most gargantuan loss to
the Cougar lineup is the return of
Jade Hyett to her native Australia.
As a sophomore last season, Hyett
became the first player in Pac-10
history to lead the conference in
steals and assists. She also set sin
gle-season school records for
both.
But while the Cougars seem to
be hurting for players, the big win
of the season for Washington
State was a 64-61 win over then-
No. 10 Arizona in Tucson. That
win came on a buzzer-beater, but
the Cougars are only 1-2 in the
conference since that game with
losses to Arizona State and Ore
gon.
"The best thing for us is that
they beat Arizona," VanDerveer
said. "I can't imagine with what
our team has already gone
through this year, anyone on our
team overlooking anybody. It
would be absolutely ridiculous."
