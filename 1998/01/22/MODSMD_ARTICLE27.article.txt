WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ TONIGHT: No. 13 Stanford (8-5. 5-1 Pa
cific 10 Conference) vs. Washington State (8
6,2-3), 7:30 p.m. TV: None. RADIO: KZSU
FM (90.1), KBPA (1220 AM)

No doubt the advantages of the home
eourt will be present for the Cardinal's 7:30
p.m. contest against Washington State (8-
6. 2-3 Pacific 10 Conference), but the con
fines of Maples Pavilion could be even
more comforting when you consider the
fact that this will be the first weekend of
the quarter in which Stanford (8-5. 5-1)
will take homecourt.
"We have been traveling a lot." said
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "It feels
strange to be back home. This is the first
time that we've played with our students."
After two weeks on the road the Card
hopes to get things back to normal. The
trip saw Stanford's Pac-10 win streak come
to an end with a one-point loss to Arizona
before the Card bounced back with its first
two-game road trip sweep of the season in
Los Angeles.

But perhaps most important in the Car
dinal's two-win weekend against USC and
UCLA was the way Stanford stepped up
and fended off a late Bruin run in a 75-70
win over UCLA.
Free throws had been a major problem
in the Card's loss to Arizona, but this time
the Card demonstrated poise at the line,
going a perfect 14-for-14 over the final six
minutes of the game.
"Sometimes I feel like I'm a fire depart
ment." VanDerveer said. "We definitely
put out the free-throw fire in that game
But I don't think we played the type of de
fense we need to play, nor do I think wc
took care of the ball the way we need to."
Leading the way for Stanford in that
contest was Vanessa Nygaard. The senior
forward hit two clutch free throws with 3
seconds remaining and was near-perfect
from the line, going 9-of-10 for the game.
Nvgaard's play was exceptional all
weekend as the 6-foot-1 forward seemed
to take a more aggressive role in the Car
dinal offense. All told. Nygaard compiled
a total of 35 points on the weekend, in
cluding a game-high 22 against the Bruins
to go along with 12 rebounds.
"Everybody knows Vanessa is a great
three-point shooter." VanDerveer said.
"At USC 1 thounht she did a great job ol
