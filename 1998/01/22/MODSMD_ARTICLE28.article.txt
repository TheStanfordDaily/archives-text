I"he No. 5 Cardinal (1M). 5-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) open up their
second road tnp of the conference
season when the\ face Washington
State (H-8. 1-4) tonight at 7:30 in
Pullman. Wash.

"Having kids who have been to
Pullman before and have experi
enced htm difficult it is to win there.
I don't think it'll be difficult (to sta\
focused." Montgomery said "I
don't know that you can keep kids at
the top of their game all the time.
That's where depth can help you.
"If a guy like he really isn't
into it we can bring a guy in and ect
a lift."
The Huskies started off the sea
son with an impressive 7-4 run. but
with the loss of leading scorer and

rcbounder guard Kixlrigo de la
Fucntc to a Spanish professional
league, the team has suffered great
l>. ITieu onl\ conference victon so
far was over hapless ()regon State.
Hut the Cougars do ha\c a solid
frontcourt. and since de la I uente's
departure, senior forward Carlos
Daniel has stepped up He now
leads the team in scoring and re
bounding with 16.4 points and
rebounds per game.
Junior small forward ("hris Crosby
is chipping in with an average of 13.9
points per game.
Sophomore point man Blake Pen
gelly has tried to pick up the slack
after de la Fuente left. He is dishing
out a team-high 4.2 assists per game
and is hitting 45 percent from behind
the arc, but unless he starts taking
more shots his contributions may be
too small to matter.
The Cardinal would seem to have
all of the momentum after coming off
of their higgest win of the season.
They also hold the nation's longest
winning streak at 16 games and are
one of only two undefeated Division I
teams (Utah stands at 15-0).
"I think the kids are excited about
it but 1 think they also know that
we're only one loss away from all
that ending," Montgomery said.
"The encouraging thing is that
UCLA loses and doesn't move [in
the rankings]. When that happens in
a conference that's good. That's
telling you that people respect the
fact that UCLA losing [in Maples] is
not a killer."
The team also got one of its best
all-around performances last Satur
day. and Mike Montgomery is happy
knowing he has many players that can
come through in the clutch.
Junior point guard Arthur Lee
hit three key treys to help fend off
UCLA's furious second-half rally,
and junior small forward Peter
Sauer hit another important three
pointer.
Perhaps most impressive was ju
nior center Tim Young's perfor
mance down in the post. He helped
control the inside game and prevent
ed the Bruin backcourt of J. R. Hen
derson and Jelani MeCov from doing
too much damage in the first half.
The importance of Young's

presence became even more clear
when he went to the bench early in
the second half because of foul
trouble.
That's when the Bruins attacked
the boards and fought back to cut
their 18-point halftime deficit to one.
It was only because of its perimeter
shooting — the team hit 14 of 26 from
downtown — that the Cardinal was
able to pull away again.
Stanford has won all of its confer
ence games by at least 10 points, and
three of the victories have been by at
least 20. which has given the team the

top scoring differential in the Pac-1().
They also still rank first in scoring de
fense and field goal percentage de
fense, showing they can play on both
sides of the ball.
But that's all in the past now.
Montgomery knows that in order
to survive in the conference, a team
has to win its road games, no matter
who the opponent.
"Arizona's already been in there
and swept." Montgomery said. "And
if your objective is to try to stick with
the top people in the [conference],
look at UCLA. Their only losses are

at Arizona and at Stanford. And
Washington's gone down and swept
the Oregons, so it's going to be a dog
fight to stay up near the top of this
thing."
The Cardinal will have to make do
without the atmosphere at Maples,
including the raucous behavior of the
Sixth Man Club.
The home court proved to be the
Cardinal's ultimate advantage last
season, when the team went 9-0 at
home in conference but only 3-6 on
the road.
But things look a little brighter

this season. The Cardinal has al
ready swept both of the Oregon
sehools at their venues hv an aver
age of 21 points, and while neither of
those teams would be considered a
powerhouse, a road victory is still a
victory.
The only thing that the Cardinal
doesn't have going for itself is the fact
that sophomore forward Mark Mad
sen and freshman center Jason
Collins still aren't 100 percent back
from their respective injuries, and
neither is expected to see much action
this weekend.
