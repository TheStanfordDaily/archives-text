Since its founding just under two
years ago, the National Center for
Postsecondary Improvement, based
at Stanford, has become a breeding
ground for research on higher edu
cation.
Established by a $12.5-million
grant from the Department of Edu
cation. the center looks for ways to
help universities improve their effi
ciency and produce more mar
ketable students.
Under the leadership of Patricia
Gumport. associate professor of ed

ucation and executive director for
the center, 60 researchers from 17 in
stitutions nationwide collaborate on
the most pressing topics in higher ed
ucation. The center focuses on how
universities can act like market
places, how education translates into
job skills and how institutions can
better cope with budget cuts, among
other areas of research.
The center's research has
brought it nationwide attention and
success. Researchers testified before
Congress about their research on
student aid, arguing for increases in
the Pell Grant program, and have

been quoted in The New York
Times. U.S. News & World Report,
National Public Radio and Business
Week.
The fate of the center's funding
was at first uncertain. It was autho
rized in early 19% just as Congress
was finishing a lengthy set of budget
negotiations with President Clinton,
and the funds for the program were
not released until the end of the sum
mer. By that time, Gumport pointed
out, "some of the research projects
were not able to be launched until
the following summer" because fac
ulty researchers had alreadv started

the school year.
Gumport emphasized that the
center's research has only begun,
and more findings are on the way.
The organization's funding officially
lasts for five years, until early 2(H)!.
But there is "a very good likelihood"
that the deadline will he extended,
according to Richard Shavelson,
dean of the School of Education.
Shavelson said the program has
developed into "one of the best cen
ters the Department of Education
has." He attributes the effective
