## Requiem By The Photographers Died in Vietnam And Indochina 
### Garth Patil 
As an avid photographer of many years, I
usually find myself sucked in to the coffee
table book section of any bookstore. Even
though many of these cliche collections are
filled with unimaginative content and dry
editorial commentary, I still flip through the
pages looking for new ideas and angles. Over
the winter break I was in a bookstore look
ing for last minute gifts when I picked up
"Requiem," a collection of battle pho
tographs taken by photojournalists during
the Vietnam War and the French-Indochina
conflict. I had seen such books, but this one
stands alone in the power of its content.

The images in "Requiem" are taken by
men and women who died serving as photo
journalists during the two conflicts. From
the beginning of the French-Indochina con
flict in 1945 to the fall of Phnom Penh and
Saigon in 1975, at least 135 photographers
are documented as missing or deceased. The
collection is dedicated to their memory.
"Requiem" is jointly edited by Florst
Faas, a senior editor at The Associated Press,
who himself won two Pulitzer prizes for his
photography in Indochina, and Tim Page,
also a photographer who was wounded in
Vietnam. The collection contains images
taken by some of the greatest photographers
of this century, such as Life Magazine's
Larry Burrows and Robert Capa.
"Requiem" is the first

such photographic collec
tion to be published in the
United States that also in
cludes a cross section of
photographs taken by
North Vietnamese and Vi
etcong combat photogra
phers as well as Western
photojournalists. The edi
tors were able to gain access
to the final photographs
and biographies of many
Vietnamese photographers
from both sides of the con
flict.
Photographs from the op
posing sides show how each
used their images as tools
of fact, truth or propagan
da. Photographers shoot
ing for the South Viet
namese news shot and pub
lished anything they saw,
including crimes commit
ted by their own govern
ment. On the other side,
however, the Communist
soldiers are displayed as he
roes and never traitors.
Of all the messages and
powerful emotions that
"Requiem" carries in its
page after page of carnage,
it serves as a reminder that
there is actually a middle
man that carries the pic
tures of earthshaking
events to outsiders â€” that
photographs don't magi
cally appear in the news,
but are captured by a rare
variety of human that com
bines artistic genius with
unbelievable courage; that
there are photographers
would give their lives to
bring the world images as
monumental as the events
they portray.
