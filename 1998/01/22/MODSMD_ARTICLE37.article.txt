# Still waters run deep: Sfmoma Acquires Major Mark Rothko
## 
### Vanessa Stich 
At its best, art is a transformative force. It is
not simply a creation, but also a creator: it
changes us, transports us from our own world
to a state willed by the artist. Sensuous and psy
chological, this art flows beyond our eyes and
penetrates our minds.
Mark Rothko's "No. 14, 1960," recently ac
quired at auction by the San Francisco Muse
um of Modern Art, is such a show of strength.
The massive painting, executed by Rothko in a
later phase of his life, overpowers its new space
in the permanent collection gallery with its
own somber intensity. Nearly eight feet high,
"No. 14" consumes our vision with its atmos
pheric bands of bright orange and deep blue,
set against a ground of rich eggplant. This dark
background gleams through the luminous or-

ange overlayer, cre
ating an impression
of profound depth
and drama. As our
eyes sink into this
abyss of color,
Rothko takes us to
another inexorable,
unspeakable realm.
This psycholog
ical submersion re
veals why Rothko is
regarded as a mas
ter of Abstract Ex
pressionism, as well
as why SFMOMA
sought so zealously
to add a second
Rothko to their col
lection. Like few
other artists,
Rothko has the
power to stir our
unconscious, to call
forth images which
resonate with
meaning yet remain
beyond our full
comprehension.
Rothko began
painting in 1921,
after winning a
scholarship to Yale.

His family had fled violent pogroms in Russia
eight years earlier, an experience that left an in
delible mark on the young artist. A political
radical, he quickly dropped out of Yale and
moved to New York City. He joined the Art
Students League, meeting Adolph Gottlieb,
Arshile Gorky and Willem de Kooning for the
first time.
With Jackson Pollock, these artists would
go on to form the core of the Abstract Expres
sionist movement. Rothko, like his fellow
classmates, sought to forge a new form of
painting that would probe man's hidden na
ture and record human emotion in the raw.

Yet unlike the wild compositions of Pollock
and de Kooning, Rothko's paintings did not
express a frenetic outpouring of his psycholog
ical innards. His mature vision was not realized
in savage skeins of pigment, but rather in
cloudy layers of color, floating upon the canvas
in a sort of uneasy equilibrium. As "No. 14"
evinces, Rothko controlled the internal chaos
beneath his paintings, allowing it to simmer
below the surface. Like the dark ground under
"No. 14" 's fiery orange field, we see the ob
scured traces of this subliminal tumult. It is the
fundamental force: silent yet fiercely present.
Rothko's silence speak to the gravity of the
human condition in a way that far transcends
the raucous activity of his peers' abstractions.
The state of mind to which Rothko delivers us
to is one of mystery, but also one of meditation
and recognition. As we are overwhelmed by the
fearsome power of "No. 14," we also appre
hend our own.

No. 14, 1960" is now on view at SF
MOMA, 151 Third Street, San Francisco.
The painting will be included in a
major Rothko retrospective at the Na
tional Gallery of Art in Washington,
D.C. in May 1998, but will return to SF
MOMA following this show.
The Museum is open daily (except
Wednesdays) from 11 a.m.— 6 p.m.;
open late Thursdays, 11 a.m. — 9 p.m.
