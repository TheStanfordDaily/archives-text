# Concert preview
## Punkabilly: The Stanford Concert Network hosts the Violent Femmes 
### Soren Johnson Staff writer 
The Violent Femmes are one of the most
unusual success stories in all of popular
music. After 10 years of word-of-mouth pro
motion, their seminal debut album from
1982 finally made platinum. This is an aston
ishing fact considering that the self-titled
album never dented the Billboard Top 40.
The Milwaukee group's success is even
more surprising considering its musical
style, which can only be described as acoustic
punk. While lead singer Gordon Gano's de
ranged lyrics placed the band squarely with
in America's alternative community, the
Femmes' sound was so different from its
peers that the group had no true contempo
raries. Backed by acoustic bassist Brian
Ritchie's jazz rhythms and Victor DeLoren
zo's stand-up drumming, the band resem
bled a coffeehouse trio gone insane.
Gano recalls that "We would play acousti
cally, and we would play on the street be
cause we couldn't get any place to play inside.
Our peers would often cross the street and
pretend they didn't know us because they
thought it was just embarrassing, what we
were doing."
The Femmes were emphatically out of
place in the Milwaukee music scene, but like
true punk pragmatics, the band used its
primitive instrumentation to its advantage.
Playing on street corners, the group slowly
built a following, but the band's break came
in one of rock's true storybook moments.
The Pretenders' guitarist lames Honeyman-
Scott spotted the group performing for fans
waiting in line outside of the theatre where
his group was playing that night. After bring
ing the rest of his band out to watch, the Pre
tenders offered the Femmes a spot as their
opening act, starting immediately.
Shortly thereafter, the group signed with
Slash Records and released its first album,
"Violent Femmes," which has become one of
the legendary underground albums of the
1980s. As Gano explains, "Our first album
has been the most popular one, overwhelm
ingly. It's something that people keep finding
out about and getting into. As we speak,
somebody's just made a tape of it and has
given it to a friend. It's a record that gets
passed down through generations."
The debut's success was hardly without
precedent, as the underground bands which
gave Gano his model, such as the Velvet Un
derground and the Modern Lovers, experi
enced similar word-of-mouth longevity. But
few of these bands ever broke into the main
stream like the Femmes did. Lou Reed may be
remembered, tragically, by the American
public only for writing "Walk On The Wild
Side" instead of fathering modern rock, but
the Femmes turned into a cultural phenome
non.
Indeed, while other Midwestern alterna

tive bands like the Replacements and Htlsker
Dtl wallowed in relative obscurity, the
Femmes became one of the first underground
American bands to gain national recognition.
"Blister In The Sun" has actually become a
staple of '80s dance music, and "Add It Up"
appeared prominently in the quintessential
'90s film "Reality Bites," when Ethan Hawke
"serenaded" Winona Ryder.
The Femmes' music succeeded because
Gano's obsessive lyrics and edgy songwriting

struck a nerve with a teenage audience. His
tales of sexual frustration and confusion res
onated with adolescents who would soon be
labeled Generation X.
Nonetheless, Gano's psycho-nerd person
ality had its roots in the modern rock com
munity of the 19705. Although the Femmes
were obviously heavily influenced by the Vel
vet Underground, just like every alternative
American band, Gano's nerdy persona devel
oped from David Byrne of the Talking Heads
and Jonathan Richman of the Modern

Lovers. (One direct connection is Jerry Harri
son, who produced the Femme's third album,
"The Blind Leading The Naked," and played
keyboards for both Byrne and Richman.)
Richman's influence on Gano has been es
pecially important. On the Modern Lovers'
brilliant debut album, Richman's unflinching
honesty and awkward delivery rendered
songs like "I'm Straight" and "Someone I
Care About" unforgettable. These songs pro
vided the blueprints for Gano's own soul-

bearing on songs like "Please Do Not Go" and
"Add It Up."
In contrast, Gano added an aggressive
edge to Richman's adolescent yearning.
While the later may have declared that "1
don't want just a girl to fool around with /1
don't want just a girl to ball / What I want is a
girl I care about," Gano pleaded, "Why can't I
get just one fuck? /1 guess it's got something
to do with luck / But I've waited my whole life
for iust one [fuck]."
Musically, Richman's propulsive, mini

malistic sound and catchy choruses also in
fluenced Gano, but the Femmes' ultimate
sound was a novel innovation. Bassist Ritchie
explains that "When we released our first
album, nobody was playing acoustic bass gui
tar. We're not imitators, we're originators."
W r hile the group members likes to portray
themselves as pioneers, the Femmes' instru
mentation is certainly not original. Acoustic
rockabilly was one of the first forms of rock
and roll, perfected by artists such as Elvis
Presley, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. In
deed, the Violent Femmes' earliest influence
might be the original rock and roll nerd him
self, Buddy Holly, whose early rockabilly on
songs like "Rock Around With Ollie Vee" and
"Ting-A-Ling" sounds eerily similar to the
Femmes' early music.
Although neither his lyrics nor his sound
were original, Gano's music is innovative be
cause he synthesized together two disparate
strands of rock to create what might be called
punkabilly. While the alternative community
originally viewed the Femmes' rockabilly as
"embarrassing," rockabilly music had cer
tainly never addressed issues of sexual para
noia as explicitly as the group did on their
debut album. For this reason, the Violent
Femmes' music at its best is truly visionary,
such as Gano's quotation from Willie Dixon's
blues standard "I Just Want To Make Love To
You" in the middle of "Gone Daddy Gone."
Unfortunately, the Femmes seemed to
have inherited one more trait from Jonathan
Richman, which is the production of wildly
unpredictable music after a brilliant debut.
Like Richman, Gano's songwriting has vacil
lated wildly between genres, with mixed re
sults. The 1986 album "The Blind Leading
The Naked," for example, effectively added
traditional punk and R&B to the mix. Re
cently however, the Femmes seem to have hit
alow point. After "New Times" (1994), which
was recorded with new drummer Guy Hoff
man, met neither critical nor popular ap
proval, the bands latest album, "Rock!!!," was
released only in Australia.
This Thursday, the Stanford community
will get a chance to discover just how much
inspiration the Violent Femmes have left. The
Stanford Concert Network recruited the
band to play at Memorial Auditorium at 6
p.m. on Jan. 22. The band's shows have been
know for wild eclecticism over the years, so
concert-goers would be advised to bring an
open mind.
