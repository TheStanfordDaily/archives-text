## American Lesion American Lesion 
### 
"American lesion," a hip folk album pro
duced and performed solely by Bad Religion
frontman and punk rock legend Greg Graflfin,
is both a triumph and a disappointment.
While Graffin's songwriting reaches new
levels of originality and sophistication, the in
ward orientation of his new recording ulti
mately proves to be its downfall. All of the
songs on "American Lesion" are lyrically re
flective of Graffin's personal experiences and
struggles, exposing more emotion than re
vealed on Bad Religion records.

"The sun comes up with promise and my
eyes burn open wide," Graffin sings on "The
Fault Line." "And the sting compounds the tor
ture from the vacant hole inside." "Fault Line"
is driven by a strong acoustic guitar, making it
one of "American Lesion" 's best.
Graffin's talent is abundant and free-flow
ing, as he proves himself a jack of all trades. The
instrumentals on "American Lesion" are per
formed without flaw; unfortunately, the whole
sound remains out of focus throughout the
album. Promise is shown on "Opinion" and

"Predicament," yet the music never quite gets
off its feet. Other songs, like "In The Mirror,"
are painfully abusive.
"Your arrogance / It will surely bring you
down / Is there a judgment appropriate for
you / that you spit at others?" he laments.
".. .You piece of shit / look in the mirror."
It would seem that Graffin's solo work is so
unique unto itself that it could never be com
pared to any of his Bad Religion work, but this
is not the case. Included on "American Lesion"
is "Cease," one of the crown jewels on the last

Bad Religion album, "The Gray Race."
"Cease," minus the strings and percussion
of Brian Baker, Jay Bentley, Bobby Schayer and
Greg Hetson (the rest of Bad Religion), is a
stripped down tune carried simply by piano
and vocals. This version is far more somber,
lacking the explosiveness as well as the passion
of the original.
Symbolically, the rest of the album is more
or less the same story, proving that Bad Reli
gion is more than just "Graffin and his boys."
