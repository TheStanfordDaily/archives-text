# Survey finds careerism up
## Intellectual apathy also seen growing 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
A recent survey ol freshmen
from around the country showed
that this year's students are more ca
reer-minded, more politically apa
thetic and care less about what
they're learning than any time in the
30-year history of the poll.
The annual survey was conduct
ed by UCLA researchers and spon
sored bv the American Council on
Education. It was given out last fall
to 34X.465 students at 665 two- and
four-year colleges.
Responses at Stanford to the sur
vey have been mixed. While staff at
the Career Planning and Placement
Center and the Undergraduate Ad
vising Center do see an increased
emphasis on pre-professionalism,
they see few signs of the intellectual
apathy indicated by the poll.
Those involved in Stanford's po

litical community see no recent de
cline in student participation, con
tradicting another contention put
forth in the survey.
Job-seeking surges
The poll reported that 75 percent
of last year's freshmen chose "to be
very well off financially" as a goal ol
education, while only 41 percent
chose "to develop a meaningful phi
losophy of life."
Counselors at theCPPC' have no
ticed the increasing career-minded
ness ol Stanford students over the
past three or four years.
"We want to help our students
maintain education for education's
sake as the highest priority." said
Bob Thirsk. head of the (PPC "We
do understand, though, that many
more students now come to college
for the sake of earning a better pay
check."
Thirsk, who has worked with col
lege students at four different
schools over the last 31 years, said
that Stanford students share these
goals with their counterparts across
the country, hut with a different
shift.
"Stanford students' career goals
seem to be more long-term, whereas
students at lesser institutions have
more immediate goals coming out of
college," Thirsk said.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya agrees that Stan
ford students have a different out
look than students at other colleges.
"Stanford students are different
in that they think much more about
their education as a path to a fulfill
ing life, rather than just a job," Mon
toya said.
Montoya recognizes, however,
that financial concerns, both for the
present and future, drive Stanford
students in many of their college de
cisions.

"Many students have a lot of
pressure coming from their families
to get a well paying job, because
families invest a lot in their child's
education." said Montoya.
This pressure can be seen, Mon
toya added, in the way students
choose their courses.
"Students are more strategic than
they used to be in the way in which
they plan their Stanford education,
which is a result of students thinking
about their careers," Montoya said.
"By the time they're seniors, if
students now haven't locked down a
career decision, they feel anxious in
a way students a few years ago might
not have," added Thirsk.
(â– uugiiig political passion
Also according to the survey, po
litical activism on campuses around
the country is declining. Twenty
seven percent of last year's freshmen
checked "keeping up to date with
political affairs" as important, com
pared to more than 40 percent in
1990, and an all-time low of 14 per
cent said they frequently discussed
politics.
Montova. who as former dean of

admissions and financial aid admit
ted all current Stanford undergradu
ates, said he hasn't seen this trend at
Stanford.
"My own sense is that the most
recent entering classes are more po
litically involved," said Montoya.
"More of them wrote about political
issues in their applications essays."
Neither sophomore Rvan Parks,
president of Stanford College Re
publicans, nor junior Rafael Nendel-
Flores. president of Stanford De
mocrats, has noticed a decrease in
political activity on campus in the
past few years.
Parks even claimed that campus
political participation has increased.
"At the activities fair last fall,
over 1 (K) freshmen signed up for club
membership," Parks said. "Half of
the club's officers are freshmen who
showed tremendous zeal and com
mitment regarding getting involved
quickly."
Nendel-Flores contended, how
ever. that Stanford political partic
ipation is lower than that of other
schools.
"The atmosphere is different
here than at [UC-Berkeley] or at
UCLA," Nendel-Flores said.

"There's less of a sense of political
participation at Stanford."
Intellects still hloom
The study also said that more stu
dents than ever, 36 percent, are
I bored in class. That's one problem
that the UAC doesn't see at Stan
ford.
"Students really find themselves
intellectually here," said Kathy
Wright, the associate director of the
UAC. "People who never thought
about taking an anthropology or a
feminist studies class find that that
awakens their intellectual curiosity."
Wright also added that many of
the survey's conclusions might be
more relevant to freshman than to
upperclassmen.
"I think most freshmen come in
not knowing what college is about,"
Wright said. "A lot of people come
in wanting to go to medical school
and be biology majors. Then, after a
while, they discover that any major
at Stanford is acceptable to medical
schools and take the classes that in
terest them. Students change in
amazing ways by the time they grad
uate."
