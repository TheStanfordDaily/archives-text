Maybe it is because I am a hopeless roman
tic, but I think that San Francisco's Big Blue
Hearts' self-titled debut album kicks ass.
Blowing away my initial reservations, based
on album photos of a band that styles itself as
the Backstreet Boys with a country twist, Big
Blue Hearts proved that it can combine simple
melodies and cheesy lyrics into a beautiful
package.
The key element of the Hearts' music is pu
rity. Consisting of two guitars, bass, drums
and three-part vocal harmonies, nearly all of
the tracks on the album demonstrate a soul
ful, sometimes haunting, always musically
rich quality. David Fisher, the lead singer and
main songwriter, has a strong but understated
style that depends on musicality rather than
on wailing, screaming or otherwise straining
his vocal cords in unnatural ways. The re
maining band members do an excellent job of
showcasing Fisher's talent and emotion.
The opening track, "Live Without Your
Love" is a perfect composite of the Hearts'
sound. Beginning with a relatively easy guitar
solo and then adding light drums, the song is
nothing intricate. But it is effective in the way
that songs by the Fverley Brothers (whom the
Hearts claim as an influence) were effective.
The song may not be complex, but every ele
ment of it comes together to complement and
enhance the others while supporting the
lamenting love story that the vocals present.
Many of the tracks have the same sound:
part '50s love song, part Chris Isaak pop-and
country combo and part Toad the Wet
Sprocket relaxation. "Nobody Wants Her"

and "Story of My Life" exemplify this combi
nation, weaving Fisher's slight twang with
basic rock and roll melodies and tales of ro
mance that make me go "aww..
This is not to say that the Hearts exemplify
only one style. "All My U)ve" employs the
wailing guitars and lilting flow of country
while still thankfully preventing images of
Garth or Billy Ray. "Dreaming of a Woman"
combines the dark, haunting sounds of the
Doors with the slow croon of Ricky Nelson.
"Dangerous Girl" is a cross between seductive
lounge music and Polynesian elements.
However, a true break from the rest of the
album comes only with "Don't Mind
Messin'," a swing tune that made me do a
double take after being lulled by the series of
slow songs that precede it. Though lacking in
the obvious display of musical skill that swing
legends like Tommy Dorsey and Benny Good
man delivered, "Don't Mind Messin' " isener
getic and proves that the Hearts can deliver
upbeat pulse-raising music as well as more
low-key efforts.
Big Blue Hearts may not display a great
amount of obvious musical dexterity or a
huge variety of styles. But the tunes that they
do offer on "Big Blue Hearts" are harmonious
and well synthesized. The Hearts are a great
band in the way that Journey and Til Tuesday
were great bands—it is all about genuine feel
ing, sincerity, easy-to-relate to tunes and a
clean and effective sound. Things of which the
Big Blue Hearts have plenty.
