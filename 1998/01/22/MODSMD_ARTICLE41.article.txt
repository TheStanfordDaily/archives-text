# Waiting The Devlins
## 
### 
Hypnotizing.
That one word sums it up for
The Devlins' new album "Wait
ing." Not that the music is partic
ularly enthralling. But if you find
yourself in a uncompromising
state of lethargy, this sensitive,
mellow-man rock CD is guaran
teed to keep you comatose.
The first track, titled "World
Outside," introduces the listener
to the slow, jazzy quality that per
vades the remaining nine tracks.
The album can not be labeled as
angst music, jazz, blues, folk or

anything modern.
Throughout most of the
album, Colin Devlins' sweet,
melancholy voice sings about a
familiar theme: being lost in a su
perficial, modern world. These
qualities could have made the
album spectacular, but eventual
ly the bland lyrics and pre
dictable beat cause the whole
thing to fade into nothing more
than soothing background noise.
The Devlins hail from Dublin,
Ireland. While that lone fact con
jures up requisite images and en

courages the temptation to make
certain musical comparisons, it
would all be a mistake with The
Devlins. "Waiting" tries to fill the
shoes of the legendary Irish band
U2 by aiming to come across with
the same simultaneously heart
wrenching and powerful sound
found on albums like "Boy" and
"War," but it fails. The one time
the resemblance becomes re
motely apparent occurs on
"Where Are You Tonight," when
Colin Devlins' alluring voice and
the sharp guitar riffs pick up

some power.
In the midst of songs that all
run into each other, the title song
"Waiting" stands out from
among the rest with lyrics that
offer some rare found insight:
"They tell me that success brings,
waiting in the half light, waiting
for an ideal ... a low deal .. .to
play your stereotype."
At times the album gets down
right, disturbingly cliche with
lyrics like, "Did you ever stop to
wonder why you're here?," or
when Colin suddenly screeches

"I'm reckless," on the song
"Reckless."
The Devlins have potential.
Unfortunately, the band's sound
has managed to walk a precarious
line that lacks soul-searching
depth or energy and vibrancy. It
resides in no-man's land. Its
sound needs life. Its lyrics need to
escape the world of 20-some
thing angst. And then maybe
they'll be hypnotizing ... in the
better sense of the word.
