# Open Your Eyes YES
## 
### 
Back in the 19705, this likable
British band embodied the best and
worst of the progressive rock move
ment. When it worked, as it did on
"Fragile" and "Close to the Edge," the
music of Yes achieved a remarkable
synthesis of rock and classical: grand
and sweeping, with just enough
catchy hooks to keep the whole affair
from floating off in to the ether. Even
tually, their pretensions got the better
of them, as their sharp, clever
arrangements gave way to miscon
ceived opi and self-indulgent
noodling.
Yet they're still around, and good
for them, as this modest and charm
ing — read, short songs—Yes album
demonstrates. The signature ele
ments are still here, most notably Jon
Anderson's blissed-out cosmic lyrics,
but they're filtered through a fairly
modern sensibility that is more
cyber-punk than Utopian hippy.

Eschewing overblown polyphony
for a tight, driving sound, "Open
Your Eyes" spotlights the welcome re
turn of Chris Squire as Yes's anchor
and focal point. Squire, one of rock's
truly inventive bass guitarists, had
been all but buried in last year's busy
and overworked "comeback" album,
"Keys to Ascension." This time
around, the clean, simpler song struc
tures give Squire the space to show
case his trebly, propulsive sound.
More melodic than rhythmic, his
bass lines act as a counterpoint to
Steve Howe's angular, snake-like gui
tar lines.
Equally welcome is the newfound
emphasis on vocal harmony, aptly
demonstrated on the opening track
"New State of Mind." Every member
of Yes has a credible voice, and all are
used to good effect in an extended
chorus that effortlessly weaves their
voices together into one joyous blast.

For a band whose seriousness elicited
comparisons to religious missionar
ies, the playfulness of "Open Your
Eyes" comes as a refreshing surprise.
Yes obviously had a good time
making this album, and the infec
tious enthusiasm imbues these songs
with an optimism that — after years
of compromises and half-baked ef
forts — seems well earned. Ander
son's lyrics are still pretty inane ("the
bluebird will fly over the world and
the stars / in the moonlight she prays
for forgiveness that's ours"), but his
voice hasn't lost any of its childlike
wonder or crystalline purity.
In fact, the only thing really wrong
with this album is new guitarist Billy
Sherwood, a longtime LA. studio
hack. Like his predecessor Trevor
Rabin, he comes from the strutting
leather-pants pretty boy school of
guitarists; blessedly, you don't have to
watch him play, and his musical con

tributions are equally questionable
("Open Your Eyes"'s single bad song
was penned solely by Sherwood).
Overall, though, this feels like a
genuine rebirth and the clouds of

nostalgia-act status have lifted. Yes
will never be hip, but they've found a
way to stay relevant. Go ahead: lose
yourself.
