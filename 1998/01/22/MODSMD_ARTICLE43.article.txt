# Shizuo vs. Shizer Shizuo

### 
Shizuo's album "Shizuo vs. Shizor" begins
with the line, "Have you ever been kissed by a girl
like this?" What kind of lady does Shizuo bring
us in digital hardcore form? Well, she's the type
of woman given to heavy beats, samples looped
for maximum hardcore appeal and song tides
such as "Sweat," "Tight" and "Crack Meets the
Hammer." Oh my, she's a lady whose ideas move
from song to song immersed in a danceable
apocalypse of music.
Wait, this isn't a woman at a 11... "I want my
money back," says the bewildered whoremonger
Hugh Grant. The rest of us say yeah! yeah! yeah!
for a genuinely new sound that moves faster and
attacks more aggressively than most screaming
hardcore. Shizuo is a heady brew of punk and
techno that proves that the destruction of old
musical categories through synergy is a good
thing. Beck knows it and so do the Beastie Boys,
who own and operate Grand Royal Records,

Shizuo's labeL
Shizuo, like the Chemical Brothers and Atari
Teenage Riot, creates cacophonies that sound
good. It seems that Shizuo attempts to blend as
many things as possible within a single song. In
"Sexual High," a few notes from the jeopardy
theme loop repeatedly, imitating the whimsical
inanity that must occupy Alex Trebek's restless
dreams.
A homage to The Cramps frontmaniac Lux
Interior is properly paid in "New Kick," a rein
terpretation of the old Cramps "New Kind of
Kick." In this version, Interior's rousing mwe
he-ha-a-a voice is replaced by the bored voice of
a child. Interior's vocals appear again in the
sped-up continuous loop featured on "Shizuo."
Other tools in Shizuo's arsenal can be found in
"Makin' Love," which features an intense repeti
tion of a riff from Guns and Roses' "Welcome to
the Jungle" that rises to electric monstrosity.

Ail of these samples mutate to the point of
transforming the original artists to mere histor
ical footnotes. It is an entirely different type of
sampling than Puffy Daddy's appropriations of
old pop hits for new pop hits. Shizuo subverts
and conquers, never riding another artist's work
for more than five seconds unless it is to com
pletely deride it, as in "New Kick" and the tooth
less "Heart of Glass" Blondie rip, "Blondo."
Shizuo is a joyrider while Puffin Daddy is a car
thief who steals for parts.
Shizuo's monster arises from both organic
and synthetic origins, a punk rock lizard inject
ed with a digital fluid that renders him threaten
ingly huge. Sure, a bit like Godzilla. The punk
root of Shizuo and Godzilla is that they seek to
destroy the space in which they are created.
Techno is usually happy to inhabit and play in
the same synthetic orb it makes for itself, it does
not destroy its illusion and spill forward to seek

more destruction— but here come the techno
logically enhanced Shizuo and Godzilla, to crash
through the warehouse and crush the tiny heads
of the djs. Watch out!
After that grisly scene, one must ask; who is
behind the violent entity known as "Shizuo?"
The Aryan on the front cover and the Teutonic
sounding "DIESE PLATTE VERGIBT EUCH
EURE SCHULD!" on the back suggest that
Shizuo consists of one German fellow. It would
make sense for Shizuo to be German, as Ger
many is a land of ideas. Some of these ideas, like
Kindergarten, are good. Some, however, are
quite bad. No one needs to be reminded that
David Hasselhoff's appeal to German culture is
not as a trained beach actor but as a singer. We as
a race must always be vigilant against such hor
rors so that mankind may continue to evolve.
Shizuo is good, though.
