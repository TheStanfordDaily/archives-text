# Amistad Soundtrack Various Artists
## 
### 
Well, John Williams has done it again. The
movie soundtrack mastermind has composed
another set of fluid melodies and harmonious
accompaniment as can only the man who
brought us the music of "Star Wars," "Jaws" and
"The Godfather."
Williams, who composed and conducted the
music for Stephen Spielberg's new movie
"Amistad," never ceases to amaze me in the way
that he captures the mood of any moment in a
movie, no matter how joyous, frantic or sad. So
famous and well integrated are his themes that
there is no separating the movie from the
soundtrack. Where would the Empire be with
out the "Imperial March" or the great white
shark without its simple but compelling pulses
of low strings?
As Spielberg comments in the liner notes,
"Sometimes film music is so specific to the iden
tity of a cultural phenomenon.... Other scores
are less remembered for their perfect fit, and like
classical music, allow the listener his or her own

personal interpretations." Williams demon
strates the ability to both expressly link a song to
a single moment in the movie and to tender a
broadly interpretable piece that serves as non
descript background music.
In the same vein as his previous classics,
Williams has invoked the symphonic muse, this
time of African descent, to help set the correct
mood.
The main theme, "Dry Your Tears, Afrika,"
begins and ends the album with uplifting choral
melodies and inspirational trumpeting. You
can almost envision a colonial slave ship sailing
through churning Atlantic as the vocal refrain
swells with rolling percussion. This theme re
peats throughout the soundtrack, in Williams'
famous style of interconnected songs via
melodic variations.
"The Liberation of Lomboko," another
choral piece, incorporates French horn solos
and dramatic build-ups with powerful vocals to
create a solid, easily recognizable tune.

Although some of the songs on the sound
track, like "Dry Your Tears" and "Middle Pas
sage," can stand alone as solid musical pieces,
most of the songs are not meant to accompany
scenic shots or other non-verbal moments.
Even these other tracks, which serve as back
ground for dialogue or intermittent action
shots, are able to convey certain emotions and
musical messages on their own.
"Crossing the Atlantic" features a sadly ret
rospective flute melody, while "July 4, 1839" is
almost spooky with its bursts of deep-throated
chanting and hurried beat.
John Williams has a gift for capturing emo
tion and even a full environment through pow
erfully precise music, whether it be in outer
space, in a restaurant or aboard a ship. He has
worked with Spielberg on 15 films — the com
bination is incredible and hopefully will contin
ue.
