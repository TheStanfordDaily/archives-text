## Texas and Tom: The Birth of a Play 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
"I was just being a big old bum," said
"Texas and Tom" writer liana Weiner
about her summer following gradua
tion. Having graduated with the Class of
'97, Weiner was working various temp
jobs in the interim between school and
the start of her internship at the
McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J. She
said boredom-inducing television
prompted a trip to the library, where
reading books about playwright
Tennessee Williams and long-time
friend and writer Margo Jones inspired
Weiner to write.
"I read about the death of Tennessee
Williams ... and I thought it would be
really cool to have that as the opening
scene of a play," Weiner said.
A subsequent reading of the circum
stances of Jones' death motivated anoth
er scene, and "Texas and Tom" was on its
way.
The play was just a few scenes long at
this point, and Weiner was soon dis
tracted by work and forgot about the
play — that is, until an e-mail from
Cuevas about Winter One Acts grabbed
her attention. She dug out the play, fin
ished it over a weekend and submitted it
to the selection committee.
"I basically did [the play] like a paper:
I just pumped it out and hoped for the
best," Weiner said.
Despite the spontaneity of the play's
conception and submission, the best
came true in the end, and the selection
committee chose "Texas and Tom" to be
performed as one of the Winter One Acts.
Not expecting this decision, Weiner
reacted to the news rather calmly: "Shit,
I've got to work on this," she told herself.

Weiner set about revising the play
and perfecting the lines, seeking the help
of professional theater workers for
advice and feedback. She feverishly
hashed and rehashed scenes until finally
the play was perfected to the quality
desired. Tennessee Williams was ready
to walk the stage.
A religious studies major and drama
minor, Weiner is no stranger to drama,
having directed for One Acts in the past
and produced last year's Ram's Head
spring musical, "City of Angels." But
writing is a new frontier. Although she
produced many dialogues for a fiction
class, this is the first full play Weiner has
ever written.
The play chronicles the relationship
of Williams and Jones from their first
meeting to their respective deaths, but
not necessarily in that order. Focused
around the production of one of
Williams' most famous plays, "The Glass
Menagerie," the story skips back and
forth through time and space, portray
ing the growing friendship of the two
writers.
Even though this was a first effort,
Weiner was quick to say that "writing is
more satisfying than producing or
directing."
"The most important part for me is
to see it," Weiner said. "I'm really thank
ful to have the opportunity to see the
show, and hear it. I'm really excited
about it."
The audience's reaction is part of
what concerns her the most. Weiner
describes the play as a black comedy,
because of the light in which it portrays
the deaths of the two characters.
"I think it's funny, but I don't know if
anyone else will think it's funny," she
said.
