What is a Winter One Act?
Although it sounds self-explanato
ry, the one act is a far more impressive
thing than it might seem to be. Writ
ten, performed, directed and pro
duced by students, the Winter One
Acts provides for a unique experience
in amateur theater.
Put on by the Ram's Head Theatri
cal Society, the Winter One Acts are a
set of three one-act plays performed in
succession over the course of a week
every winter quarter. Set in the small
theater space of Eleanor Prosser Stu
dio behind Memorial Auditorium, the
One Acts sport a close, intimate set
ting, in which the audience hears every
whisper an actor makes, and the actors
notice every expression the audience
returns.
Inheriting the throne from last
year's One Acts producer, senior Julie
Cuevas has been building this year's
One Acts since spring quarter. The
first problem is location, location, lo
ation.
Hoping to be permitted to run the
plays in first the Nitery, where they
were held last year, and second the lit
tle Theater, Cuevas and the rest of the

One Acts crew had to eventually settle
with Prosser, due to conflicts with
timing and different classes being

taught in the other two. Ram's Head is
unaffiliated with the Drama depart
ment, which controls the use of the

theaters.
"My goal is to
somehow prove (to
the Drama Depart
ment] that this pro
duction can handle
a theater like The
Little Theater,"
Cuevas said.
It seems this
wouldn't be diffi
cult, because One
Acts usually sells
out due to the small
number of seats (70
in Prosser) and de
spite the number of
shows run (nine this
year.) But the show
has yet to make it to
the larger Little
Theater.
Scholarships,
awards and festi
vals, oh, my!
One of the possi
ble extrinsic rewards

of being involved in
Winter One Acts is the possibility of
being nominated to the Kennedy Cen
ter American College Festival. Every

year the festival committee sends ad
judicators to hundreds of colleges to
view plays for the festival. If his or her
play is nominated, a writer has the
chance to receive an award, have the
play published or receive a scholar
ship.
Last year, current senior Samuel
Park's "Curtain Call" was nominated
to the festival. Park wrote one of this
year's One Acts, "Shakespeare's Son
nets."
Choosing a One Act
Fifteen plays were submitted for
this year's One Acts, after Cuevas
called on writers to work on scripts
over the summer. A selection commit
tee made up of members of Ram's
Head Staff, its executive board and
Cuevas herself read through and chose
which three of the plays they wished to
run.
"We weren't really looking for any
thing in particular," Cuevas said. "We
just went with the ones we thought
were really good."
After selection of the scripts, a di
rector for each play is chosen by the
