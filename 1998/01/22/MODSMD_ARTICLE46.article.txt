What is a Winter One Act?
Although it sounds self-explanato
ry, the one act is a far more impressive
thing than it might seem to be. Writ
ten, performed, directed and pro
duced by students, the Winter One
Acts provides for a unique experience
in amateur theater.
Put on by the Ram's Head Theatri
cal Society, the Winter One Acts are a
set of three one-act plays performed in
succession over the course of a week
every winter quarter. Set in the small
theater space of Eleanor Prosser Stu
dio behind Memorial Auditorium, the
One Acts sport a close, intimate set
ting, in which the audience hears every
whisper an actor makes, and the actors
notice every expression the audience
returns.
Inheriting the throne from last
year's One Acts producer, senior Julie
Cuevas has been building this year's
One Acts since spring quarter. The
first problem is location, location, lo
ation.
Hoping to be permitted to run the
plays in first the Nitery, where they
were held last year, and second the lit
tle Theater, Cuevas and the rest of the

One Acts crew had to eventually settle
with Prosser, due to conflicts with
timing and different classes being

taught in the other two. Ram's Head is
unaffiliated with the Drama depart
ment, which controls the use of the

theaters.
"My goal is to
somehow prove (to
the Drama Depart
ment] that this pro
duction can handle
a theater like The
Little Theater,"
Cuevas said.
It seems this
wouldn't be diffi
cult, because One
Acts usually sells
out due to the small
number of seats (70
in Prosser) and de
spite the number of
shows run (nine this
year.) But the show
has yet to make it to
the larger Little
Theater.

One of the possi
ble extrinsic rewards

of being involved in
Winter One Acts is the possibility of
being nominated to the Kennedy Cen
ter American College Festival. Every

year the festival committee sends ad
judicators to hundreds of colleges to
view plays for the festival. If his or her
play is nominated, a writer has the
chance to receive an award, have the
play published or receive a scholar
ship.
Last year, current senior Samuel
Park's "Curtain Call" was nominated
to the festival. Park wrote one of this
year's One Acts, "Shakespeare's Son
nets."
Choosing a One Act
Fifteen plays were submitted for
this year's One Acts, after Cuevas
called on writers to work on scripts
over the summer. A selection commit
tee made up of members of Ram's
Head Staff, its executive board and
Cuevas herself read through and chose
which three of the plays they wished to
run.
"We weren't really looking for any
thing in particular," Cuevas said. "We
just went with the ones we thought
were really good."
After selection of the scripts, a di
rector for each play is chosen by the

same committee, and auditions are called for ac
tors. Actors are asked to audition for all three
plays, and those that perform well are called back
and chosen for specific plays. The writers sit in on
director interviews and actor auditions to give
input on how they envision the characters.
When the selection is done, rehearsals begin in
full force, starting in November and continuing
after break until shows begin.
"Merely acting!" "Brilliant!" "Thank you!"
"It's a very strange play," sophomore Arthur
Schram said of "Solitaire for Two." "It's kind of
unclear who's real, and it's hard to put your own
emotions into the character. It's difficult to un
derstand what the characters are thinking."
Schram, who plays the main character Soren
in "Solitaire for Two," has had multiple acting
roles in high school and was also involved in this
year's production of "Twelfth Night" and "Cur
tain Call," a one act play performed last year.
Schram is also involved in SCBN's comedy sketch
show, "The Oval." Still, despite past experiences,
Schram finds playing the role of Soren to be a dif
ficult task.
"It's quite a frustrating situation," he said. "It's
hard to find anything real to hold onto."
Because the play is constructed in such a

blurred reality, Schram notes that the bigger pic
ture is perhaps more incentive to watch than the
individual components.
"I think the play is more interesting for its dra
matic situations than necessarily for its character
work," he said. "The challenge of the play is that
it's unclear what happens. It's almost like it's all a
dream ... I wonder what the audience will
think."
Junior Kevin Lemons has a different kind of
challenge to undertake. He plays Tennessee
Williams in "Texas and Tom," and has found it to
be a far cry from his days as Sterling Quad in last
year's Gaieties.
"[The portrayal] is based on real life, and 1
don't want to misrepresent it,"he said.
Like the rest of the cast of the play, Lemons had
to do some research into his character to become
familiar with his mannerisms and thought
processes. The biography, "Tom: the unknown
Tennessee Williams," by Lyle Leverich, has
proven an invaluable resource to all involved in
the play. But despite the boundaries that one
might think playing a historical role creates,
Lemons says this does not narrow the creative
possibilities of the role.
"It doesn't constrain you, it gives you direc
tion," he said.
Sophomore director Erryn Lewis concurs with

Lemons, saying the history "gives you guidelines,
but there's still a lot of room for creativity." Con
tact with writer liana Weiner also helped facilitate
the process.
"It was good to know that she (Weiner) was
there," Lewis said.
Lemons describes Williams as "neurotic" and
"melodramatic."
"He's a writer at heart, and his purpose in life is
to write what he feels," Lemons said. "He likes to
be the center of attention."
Lemons also had to do some independent re
search on how to come up with a southern accent
for his character.
"1 have a friend who's from the south, and so I
listened to him a lot and tried to imitate the way he
talks," he said.
Amateurs vs. Pros and Big vs. Small
Having acted in both Drama Department and
Ram's Head productions, Schram found the dif
ference to be enormous. He described the Drama
Department as more professional and "busi
nesslike," while Ram's Head is more "student
based" and its goals are "more amateur."
Schram noted the contrast between the very
experienced Drama Department directors and
Ram's Head student directors, many of whom are

directing for the first time.
"The atmosphere is a lot different," he said.
"Students are not as inclined to order other stu
dents around. It's more of a collaborative effort."
Lewis noted that the environment on the set of
"Texas and Tom" was very "low-key."
"I've never worked with any of the people in
the play before," she said. "Managing six people is
hard, but it's not stressing,"
Another contrast between this and other pro
ductions is the size of the theater. The setting is
smaller and more intimate, with the actors some
times inches away from the audience.
Lemons describes the smaller setting as being
"much more serious" and more difficult from an
acting standpoint
"You're really trying to make people think," he
said. "It's different to have eye contact with the
audience. It makes it hard to stay in character."
Schram, on the other hand, finds the smaller
setting to be technically easier.
M I loved working in Mem Aud, but it was a lit
tle bit strange and impersonal," he said. "The re
wards are great, though, and the curtain call is just
amazing.
"The small setting is great You really get a
sense of what the audience is thinking, and you
can make the audience react. There's more room
for subtle acting."

What is a Winter One Act?
Although it sounds self-explanato
ry, the one act is a far more impressive
thing than it might seem to be. Writ
ten, performed, directed and pro
duced by students, the Winter One
Acts provides for a unique experience
in amateur theater.
Put on by the Ram's Head Theatri
cal Society, the Winter One Acts are a
set of three one-act plays performed in
succession over the course of a week
every winter quarter. Set in the small
theater space of Eleanor Prosser Stu
dio behind Memorial Auditorium, the
One Acts sport a close, intimate set
ting, in which the audience hears every
whisper an actor makes, and the actors
notice every expression the audience
returns.
Inheriting the throne from last
year's One Acts producer, senior Julie
Cuevas has been building this year's
One Acts since spring quarter. The
first problem is location, location, lo
ation.
Hoping to be permitted to run the
plays in first the Nitery, where they
were held last year, and second the lit
tle Theater, Cuevas and the rest of the

One Acts crew had to eventually settle
with Prosser, due to conflicts with
timing and different classes being

taught in the other two. Ram's Head is
unaffiliated with the Drama depart
ment, which controls the use of the

theaters.
"My goal is to
somehow prove (to
the Drama Depart
ment] that this pro
duction can handle
a theater like The
Little Theater,"
Cuevas said.
It seems this
wouldn't be diffi
cult, because One
Acts usually sells
out due to the small
number of seats (70
in Prosser) and de
spite the number of
shows run (nine this
year.) But the show
has yet to make it to
the larger Little
Theater.
Scholarships,
awards and festi
vals, oh, my!
One of the possi
ble extrinsic rewards

of being involved in
Winter One Acts is the possibility of
being nominated to the Kennedy Cen
ter American College Festival. Every

year the festival committee sends ad
judicators to hundreds of colleges to
view plays for the festival. If his or her
play is nominated, a writer has the
chance to receive an award, have the
play published or receive a scholar
ship.
Last year, current senior Samuel
Park's "Curtain Call" was nominated
to the festival. Park wrote one of this
year's One Acts, "Shakespeare's Son
nets."
Choosing a One Act
Fifteen plays were submitted for
this year's One Acts, after Cuevas
called on writers to work on scripts
over the summer. A selection commit
tee made up of members of Ram's
Head Staff, its executive board and
Cuevas herself read through and chose
which three of the plays they wished to
run.
"We weren't really looking for any
thing in particular," Cuevas said. "We
just went with the ones we thought
were really good."
After selection of the scripts, a di
rector for each play is chosen by the

same committee, and auditions are called for ac
tors. Actors are asked to audition for all three
plays, and those that perform well are called back
and chosen for specific plays. The writers sit in on
director interviews and actor auditions to give
input on how they envision the characters.
When the selection is done, rehearsals begin in
full force, starting in November and continuing
after break until shows begin.
"Merely acting!" "Brilliant!" "Thank you!"
"It's a very strange play," sophomore Arthur
Schram said of "Solitaire for Two." "It's kind of
unclear who's real, and it's hard to put your own
emotions into the character. It's difficult to un
derstand what the characters are thinking."
Schram, who plays the main character Soren
in "Solitaire for Two," has had multiple acting
roles in high school and was also involved in this
year's production of "Twelfth Night" and "Cur
tain Call," a one act play performed last year.
Schram is also involved in SCBN's comedy sketch
show, "The Oval." Still, despite past experiences,
Schram finds playing the role of Soren to be a dif
ficult task.
"It's quite a frustrating situation," he said. "It's
hard to find anything real to hold onto."
Because the play is constructed in such a

blurred reality, Schram notes that the bigger pic
ture is perhaps more incentive to watch than the
individual components.
"I think the play is more interesting for its dra
matic situations than necessarily for its character
work," he said. "The challenge of the play is that
it's unclear what happens. It's almost like it's all a
dream ... I wonder what the audience will
think."
Junior Kevin Lemons has a different kind of
challenge to undertake. He plays Tennessee
Williams in "Texas and Tom," and has found it to
be a far cry from his days as Sterling Quad in last
year's Gaieties.
"[The portrayal] is based on real life, and 1
don't want to misrepresent it,"he said.
Like the rest of the cast of the play, Lemons had
to do some research into his character to become
familiar with his mannerisms and thought
processes. The biography, "Tom: the unknown
Tennessee Williams," by Lyle Leverich, has
proven an invaluable resource to all involved in
the play. But despite the boundaries that one
might think playing a historical role creates,
Lemons says this does not narrow the creative
possibilities of the role.
"It doesn't constrain you, it gives you direc
tion," he said.
Sophomore director Erryn Lewis concurs with

Lemons, saying the history "gives you guidelines,
but there's still a lot of room for creativity." Con
tact with writer liana Weiner also helped facilitate
the process.
"It was good to know that she (Weiner) was
there," Lewis said.
Lemons describes Williams as "neurotic" and
"melodramatic."
"He's a writer at heart, and his purpose in life is
to write what he feels," Lemons said. "He likes to
be the center of attention."
Lemons also had to do some independent re
search on how to come up with a southern accent
for his character.
"1 have a friend who's from the south, and so I
listened to him a lot and tried to imitate the way he
talks," he said.
Amateurs vs. Pros and Big vs. Small
Having acted in both Drama Department and
Ram's Head productions, Schram found the dif
ference to be enormous. He described the Drama
Department as more professional and "busi
nesslike," while Ram's Head is more "student
based" and its goals are "more amateur."
Schram noted the contrast between the very
experienced Drama Department directors and
Ram's Head student directors, many of whom are

directing for the first time.
"The atmosphere is a lot different," he said.
"Students are not as inclined to order other stu
dents around. It's more of a collaborative effort."
Lewis noted that the environment on the set of
"Texas and Tom" was very "low-key."
"I've never worked with any of the people in
the play before," she said. "Managing six people is
hard, but it's not stressing,"
Another contrast between this and other pro
ductions is the size of the theater. The setting is
smaller and more intimate, with the actors some
times inches away from the audience.
Lemons describes the smaller setting as being
"much more serious" and more difficult from an
acting standpoint
"You're really trying to make people think," he
said. "It's different to have eye contact with the
audience. It makes it hard to stay in character."
Schram, on the other hand, finds the smaller
setting to be technically easier.
M I loved working in Mem Aud, but it was a lit
tle bit strange and impersonal," he said. "The re
wards are great, though, and the curtain call is just
amazing.
"The small setting is great You really get a
sense of what the audience is thinking, and you
can make the audience react. There's more room
for subtle acting."
