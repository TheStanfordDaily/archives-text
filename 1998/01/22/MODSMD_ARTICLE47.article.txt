# Solitaire for Two: Director's Cut
## 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
Perfecting the script is only the first step
to putting on a successful play. Once the
script is out of the writer's hands, the direc
tor steps in to transform the words into vi
sual and audio imagery.
"It took us a long time to figure out what
was going on in terms of why characters
were reacting the way they did to certain
things — no normal person would react
that way," said sophomore Ana-Catrina
Savulescu, director of "Solitaire for Two."
Perhaps the most abstract of the three
One Acts, "Solitaire for Two" brings a big
challenge to actors and director alike. The
play dons a mystical quality, which creates
a dream-like reality filled with almost mag
ical situations and highly physical symbol
ism.
The main character, Soren, goes to bed
one night after an argument with his wife
and wakes up with a mysterious and beau
tiful woman in his bed. Cut to two men
playing separate games of solitaire. One is
trying to coax the other into a discussion of
love and its roots and implications. Cut
back to the bedroom, where the wife shows

up and thinks nothing of her husband
being in bed with a strange woman. And it
continues.
As the director, Savulescu must deal
with portraying this warped reality on
stage, as well as a host of other problems on
the set. But lighting crews, set designers and
sound cues, as well as however many actors
arc involved, can't cause much hassle unless
a clear vision of how the script plays out is
developed.
"At the first rehearsal," Savulescu said,
"1 had a clear idea of how things should be.
Then 1 let the actors do it the way that they
tea, and it worked out perfectly."
Savulescu and the play*s actors did have
to consult with writer Jeremy Sawyer, a se
nior, by phone (he's currently overseas in
Spain) for insight into the characters'
thoughts and feelings, but afterward all had
a fairly clear idea of how the play should be
performed.
So what does it take to be a director? For
Savulescu, it was as simple as liking a script.
A first-time director, she has little experi
ence with drama, save having a few lines in
a high school play and being stage manager
for last year's One Acts.
"I really liked Jeremy's script, and I

thought it might be fun to direct it, she
said. "It was very spontaneous, like every
thing in my life, and I was scared.
But having the urge or inclination to di
rect isn't enough. Each potential director
has to face the selection committee in an
oral grill session, in which committee
members ask how the applicant would di
rect certain scenes in the play, what he or
she would do if actors showed up late to re
hearsal and how generally the applicant
would deal with actors.
"I think the questions were there for
(the committee| to see how I reacted to
them more than to see what my answers
were," Savulescu said. "Actually, after that
interview, I was sure I wouldn t get it.
Of course, she d id get the part. Draw
ing on her experiences with friends back
home in Romania, many ot whom are in
volved in drama, Savulescu set about de
veloping her strategy for directing.
"I visualize [the play] while reading the
script, see what the actors do with it and
make a combination ot the two, she said.
Savulescu noted that dealing with actors is
"almost like taking a sociology or psychol
ogy class."
"You really have to be a good psycholo

gist to deal with all the actors and the prob
lems," she said.
In addition to coordinating the efforts
of the actors and the various technical
crews, the director can have creative power
in altering the script as well. Savulescu said
she has cut a few lines and added some im
provisations to Sawyer's play.
"Since the author of the play is alive, he
can override anything the director says."
Savulescu said. "1 talked to Jeremy about

[the changes] and he was really excited. He
says we're always on the same wavelength."
She described the play as having "vivid
and alert dialogue. Sometimes it's easy to
understand, sometimes, it's incredibly sad
and sometimes it takes on philosophical
tones.
"The combination of fast and slow
scenes is perfect; it allows you to take a
breath every now and then. All the lines are
humorous, but the message is so sad."
