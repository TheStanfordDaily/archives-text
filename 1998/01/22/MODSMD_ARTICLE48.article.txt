# Shakespeare's Sonnets
## An Author's Diary 
### 
"Shakespeare's Sonnets" ex
plores the reunification of two
men who haven't seen each
other for 50 years. The two met
in college at Harvard in the
19405, fell in love and at gradu
ation, went their separate ways.
They meet again when both are
in their 70s, and reconstruct the
lives that they've led, together
and apart.
Senior Samuel Park, the au
thor of "Shakespeare's Sonnets,"
agreed to bare his soul for Inter
mission. From the day he con
vinced Ram's Head to produce
his play as one of the Original
Winter One Acts to the first per
formance, Sam reveals what
goes on in the mind of a play
wright and divulges what really
happens behind the curtain —
including too much information
about Ram's Head's retreat.
This is theater in the raw.
This is not a work of fiction.
Any resemblance to real peo
ple is totally intentional.

Met Julie, the producer of
Original Winter One Acts, at
the CoHo for an interview. I'm
nervous about the play, but de
cide if they don't pick it, it's
okay.

Find out they're doing it.
Absolutely thrilled. Julie and I
have Dan Pintauro in mind to
direct.
Sunday, Oct. 26
Big surprise. Dan applies to
direct, after saying he was too
busy and there was no way he
could do it. Apparently he
doesn't want someone else to
"destroy" it. I see his point.

The play is so frail, one misstep
and it comes tumbling apart.
Unless it has a tremendous di
rector and cast, it won't do
what it's supposed to do,
which is to touch the audience.

Callbacks. We have nine ac
tors in the running for two
roles. One of the most excruci
ating things for someone who
writes is to hear his dialogue
spoken by really bad actors. It's
horrifying. But also, there's
nothing like hearing your lines
coming from a good actor. It's
heaven. There's a bit of both at
callbacks. One actor in partic
ular blows me away. He even
tually gets cast. Casting is pret
ty painless. I'm excited.
Friday, Nov. 7
We're supposed to have a
run-through but one of the ac
tors doesn't show up. Dan
reads his part. My initial reac
tion? This is an awful play. But
that's my reaction after every
read-through. Too late to burn
the play.

The retreat. We go to this
condo in Santa Cruz., by the
beach. Once everyone gets
there, there are about 20 of us,
the fun begins: lots and lots of
drinking, laughter, debauch
ery. We play a drinking game
where we find out that some of
our cast / staff have had sex
with animals, sex in an eleva
tor, sex with the roommate in
the room, sex with the room
mate and so on. Of course,
they could be lying, being
drunk and all. Lots of sexual
tension.
Part two: We go to the
beach, it's pitch dark, and sev

eral people run into the water
buck naked. The sky's gor
geous, but there's something
sad about the whole thing.
FinaJ tally: five people skinny
dipping, four hook-ups and a
huge massage circle. I find it all
to be a depressing experience
and come back to Branner in
the first car Sunday morning.

John L'Heureux, who's a
novelist, drama professor, and
former director of the Creative
Writing Program, is the only
person whose opinion 1 really
care about. He likes the play,
but has suggestions, some of
which are pretty cutting. Ex
amples: "P. 31: Pinter it's not.
Cut." "P. 36: Again, get on with
it." "P. 38: Here's a very diffi
cult scene to manage. The
dancing is not gonna work
Trust me." Ouch.
Thursday, Nov. 13
Meet up with History Prof.
Paul Robinson. He suggests
more revisions.
