## Robert O'Hara's "Insurrection: Holding History" 
### Robin Moroney Editorial staff 
Our age has made history and en
tertainment uncomfortable com
panions. We treat history with all the
seriousness of a funeral, and history
that entertains is as suspicious as
laughter during a grave eulogy.
Robert O'Hara's "Insurrection:
Holding History," shows us how his
tory is spectacle and entirely depen
dent on its audience. In his hands,
the Nat Turner slave rebellion of
1831 becomes a blood-soaked come
dy cabaret, making laughter and ter
ror a potent theatrical mix. This isn't
the record of history, it's the struggle
between history and those who cre
ate it.
The show is high camp. Both the
director and writer announce in the
program, "We now officially give
you permission to laugh . . . out
loud." Ron, a gay doctoral student
travels back in time to the Nat Turn
er slave rebellion with his 189-year
old grandfather. His 1990s sensibili
ties, along with his knowledge of the
carnage that lies at the end of Nat
Turner's vision, makes him an awk
ward liberator in the world of slav
ery. Despite his grandfather's con
stant pleas, he simply can't keep his
mouth shut, standing up for ideals
that are anachronistic and useless to
slavery's brutal logic.
The story of Nat Turner, revolu
tionary, slave, preacher, mass-mur
derer, is inseparable from the story of
race relations in the United States.

O'Hara pours the entire African-
American experience into the 1831
revolt. Slaves become Black Panthers
and Nation of Islam members; the
music that underpins the action
draws on African traditionals, blues,
rap, soul and gospel. At the same
time, O'Hara warns of the danger of
condescending to the past just be
cause we know what happens next.
Ron, despite his excellent historical
credentials, can never truly compre
hend the madness that is slavery.
This production is a mixed bag,
risks have been taken, and the ones
that pay off come at the expense of
those that fall embarrassingly flat on
their face. The "Wizard of Oz" paro
dy really works well, for instance.
Ron wakes up in bed surrounded by
wide-eyed slaves. Shocked, he looks
down to see a pair of slave-owning
legs poking out from under the bed.
It's a wonderful moment, and the tap
routine that follows is hysterical.
However, that success is preceded by
a three foot bed haltingly floated
over the stage with all the grace of an
Ed Wood flying saucer, it's ridicu
lous without being acknowledged as
such, and it is a risk that is pointless
and costly.
The first hour of the play is mired
in a desperate will to do anything for
a laugh. There are a lot of half-decent
jokes which contribute less to the
play than their absence would. Some
characterizations, such as Shona
Tucker's Mistress Mo'tel, assume
that stupidity is comedy and that in
the world of funny, three dimensions
are two dimensions too many.

These disappointments are per
haps balanced by some truly excel
lent performances and a spell-bind
ing second hour. As soon as the play
genuinely pays attention to what it is
about — race, slavery, violence, sex
uality — the scenes gain genuine ten
sion and the jokes have a purpose be
yond pointless ornamentation. Nat
Turner's rallying speech before the
revolt is a proper blend of inspira
tion and absurdity. Dressed as a
Gospel preacher, his speech inspires
and amazes before promptly dissolv
ing into the hokey pokey. Gregory
Wallace's Ron is also a key character
played with conviction and flair and
contributes greatly to the play's suc
cesses.
The script demands considerable
imagination and often the produc
tion comes up short. The beginning
of the play is a hallucinatory tapestry
of visions, weaving together 1990s
and 1830 sand all that has come in
between. The best director Charles
Randolph-Wright can do with these
visions is to have them run on and off
the stage making the first fifteen
minutes of the play stutter where it
should be lyrical.
"Holding History"'s main contri
bution is to take serious events out of
the hands of serious people. The
tragedy of the real world all too often
translates onto the stage as senti
mental moralizing, an opportunity
for everybody to shake their heads
and re-affirm that, yes, this was a
horrible thing that happened.
O'Hara fully shows us the horror of
slavery, doesn't allow us to separate

ourselves from it,
and is not afraid
to let us laugh
when the only
other option is to
go mad with grief.
