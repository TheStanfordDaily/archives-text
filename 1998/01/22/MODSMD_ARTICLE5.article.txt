# Student rooms to face new lock-up
## Rekeying to be quicker, cheaper 
### kelly Christeson 
Students who lose their keys will
soon not have to spend as much time
and money in having their rix>ms
rekeyed. Beginning on Tuesday and
continuing through May, Housing
and Dining Services will install an up
dated lock system in all student
rooms in campus residences.
Because this new system, called
the Best Lock System, will he main
tained by Undergraduate Residence
Facilities Stanford's own in-house
maintenance group — rekeying will
he done more quickly and more
cheaply than the existing off-campus
company can. The renovations will
begin in Stern 1 lall and continue until
every room has new locks and lever
doorknobs.
This change, however, is not a re
sponse to the great number of master
keys that have been lost lately. Ac
cording to Tim OBrien. maintenance
manager for Housing and Dining, the
cost of maintaining the old locks,
which constantly had to be fixed, was
just too high.
In addition, some of the current

locking systems do not compl\ with
the Americans \\ ith Disabilities Act.
The new locks will include lex er han
dles. which require less grip strength
than the old. rounded knobs and are
therefore easier to open.
The new system will also elimi
nate the two-key system — one for
the dormitory entrance and one for
rix>m entrance — used in some resi
dences.
Although man\ schools are updat
ing their locks with key-card systems.
Housing and Dining decided against
this measure. Given the size and di
versity of Stanford's housing system, a
key-card system would cost five times
more than the new Best Lock system
and provide no greater security. Al
ready the new Best Lock Svsk-m has
been instituted with \er\ good results
in W ilbur Hall. Lvman Graduate
Residences and Escondido Village,

An e-mail to all resident assistants
and resident fellows from Housing
and Dining says that students will not
be disturbed in their residences be
