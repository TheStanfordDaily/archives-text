## Wag the Dog 
### 
A major political scandal rocks
the White House, so the nation
goes to war. Sound familiar? It un
doubtedly does, and that is part of
the reason why "Wag the Dog"
works so well. With veteran talent
and a quality director to boot, this
film simply oozes with biting sar
casm and impeccable humor.
Conrad Brean (Robert
DeNiro) is called on by the Presi
dent to divert the nation's atten
tion away from a sordid scandal
involving the President and a Fire
Girl (think Girl Scout) just a few
days before election day. Included
in Brean's council is Winifred
Ames (Anne Heche), a Presiden
tial aide who has direct contact
with the President any time advice
about the diversion is needed. The
"diversion" entails an imaginary
war with Albania, who is rumored
to have a nuclear weapon. The di
rection of this altercation jets all
over the place, even finding a way
to implicate our passive neighbors
to the North, namely Canada.
Brean relies upon a Hollywood
producer named Stanley Motss
(Dustin Hoffman, who nearly
steals the show) to guide the pro
ceedings. Motss (pronounced
"Moss") calls upon Fad King
(Denis Leary, electric as usual), a
man with a nose for coming
trends, and singer Johnny Green
(believe it or not, Willie Nelson)
to head up the publicity portion
of the war. Together, they devise
ways to make the war more ap
pealing to the mass populace; for
example, a series of songs, shoe-

throwing and ribbon
wearing are specifically
engineered to garner in
terest.
There is actually an
antagonist in this manic
mayhem, and he comes
in the form of presiden
tial opponent Senator
Neal (Craig T. Nelson,
star of "Coach"). Ap
parently, he entices the
CIA — one agent is
played by William H.
Macy ("Fargo") as Mr.
Young — to back him in
an attempt to divert at
tention away from the
Albanian conflict.
Motss' "production"
does not fold, however,
and Sgt. William Schu
mann (a wacky Woody
Harrelson) is thrown
into the mix. Sound
confusing?
I don't want to ruin
the surprising turns that
"Wag the Dog" takes,
because that is another
part of its charm. Witty
dialogue from Hoff
man, in particular, dri
ves each scene into the
next. 1 simply loved the
detailed look at the
world of special effects
— it seems to be very

easy to manipulate images and
sounds that might be shown on
television, which is what the spin
doctors do in order to create their
Albanian war. It makes you won-

der if any recent events, like the
Persian Gulf, really did happen,
and if they did, how much of it ac
tually was true.
I have to compliment director

Barry Levinson for his latest work,
which reveals a side of politics and
American naivete never before en
countered. "Wag the Dog" hu
morously reveals that even the

most reliable news may be false,
and we may not even know it.
