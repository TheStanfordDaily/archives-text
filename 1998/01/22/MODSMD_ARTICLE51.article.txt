# Hard Rain

It's a disaster film! It's a cat-and-mouse
heist flick! It's a romance! It's an action ad
venture! It's all this and more! And in its at
tempts to be all things to all people, "Hard
Rain" fails to be anything more than a
cheesy, mindless (albeit entertaining)
summation of every Hollywood cliche in
the book.
Okay, granted, the incredible action se
quences (one of which involves a high
speed jetski chase through a deserted high
school) definitely keep you entertained,
but not long enough to keep you from
questioning a bizarre plot and the worst di
alogue since whatever movie Christian
Slater was last in.
Hot on the heels of "Titanic," "Hard
Rain" follows the recent "just-add-water"
Hollywood trend by giving us Slater as an
armored car driver trying to prevent your
standard armored-car robbery, made less
standard by the fact that it's being pulled

during a raging Indiana storm. Said storm
eventually floods an entire town and forces
all its residents to evacuate — all except a
few, like the obligatory love interest, played
by Minnie Driver.
Minnie would rather stick around in
torrential flooding than head for dry land
because she is dead set on protecting the
church she's spent eight months restoring.
(Anyone want to wager a guess on the sta
tus of the church at the end of the movie?)
It's a good thing Minnie stays, though, be
cause she really becomes a necessary part
of the plot development. After all, who's
going to not only save Slater when he does
something stupid but also botch things up
by needing rescue at the most pivotal of
moments?
"Hard Rain" also buys into the cliche of
keeping every scene in the movie really
dark and really wet, making you crave day
light and dry land. The characters are al

ways squinting in the dark and running
around with white T-shirts clinging to
them. (Note to Christian: Please make use
of your now-ample free time by making
frequent trips to the prison gym. Thanks.)
If it were any other movie, I might say
that this is a cinematic technique designed
to make you empathize with what the char
acters are going through, but I really don't
think that's the case here. And the movie is
ripe with plot twists and turns, the kind
that draw you deeper into the film if you al
ready like it and leave you rolling your
eyes / dropping your head in your hands in
frustration if you don't.
The crazy thing is that "Hard Rain" is
not a horrible movie. Actually, what's scary
is that it really does keep you entertained,
proving that with enough action (and
water?) any movie can be watchable.
