The folks at Universal must have been more
than half-baked to let this movie get made. It's
a D-minus cut-up of "The Stoned Age" — that
B-minus genre flick trying to ride the A+ bril
liance of "Dazed and Confused."
"Half-Baked" starts with a flashback scene
of Thurgood (Dave Chapelle), Scarface
(Guillermo Diaz), Brian (Jim Brewer) and
Kenny (Harlan Williams) walking into a con
vience store stoned for the first time at age 11
and looking for munchies. Despite moving
into the present, when the four twenty-some
thing friends live together in a New York City
apartment, the rest of the film relies on pre
pubescent humor to move along a plotless
plot.
Let's see; there's a gratuitous bad boy —
good girl love affair, a gratuitous diabetic cop
horse named "Buttercup," several gratuitous
jokes about anal penetration and the sexual
practices of convicts, a gratuitous tit shot, the
gratuitous use of Jerry Garcia's ghost and un
forgiveable misogyny in the form of lesbian
jokes and degrading language towards women.
If 1 had to sum up the movie in one word, guess

what it would be...
If the assholes who produced this movie
thought that a sober (or stoned) audience

would find these
things funny,
they should
have laid off the
Chocolate Thai.
Occasional mo
ments of mari-

juana-smoking humor accurately depict some
elements of modern drug culture, like the ten
dency of stoners to name their paraphernalia
— the NYC apartment contains a shelf of
bongs ruled by Billy Bong Thorton. But the
unrelenting idiocy of the plot and the shabby,
typecast acting of all four central characters
becomes mind-numbing — and not in a psy
chotropic manner.
There are two things this movie has going

for it, the first of which is superb
cameo appearences by Jon Stew
art, Snoop Doggie Dogg, Willie
Nelson and Janeane Garofalo.
The second is the off-the-cuff
spoofing of several Hollywood
movies made in the 1990s that
pass by without a blink. Unfortu
nately, the spoofing seems to be as
much as a reason for a scene to
exist as any other, such as a mari
juana-vault robbery in which
Scarface appears dressed in the
black clothes and whiteface of the
bank robbers from "Dead Presi
dents."
Despite what initially seems
to be a pro-marijuana message,
"Half-Baked" intentionally at
tacks the drug, its users, their aes
thetic and the potentially viable
role of marijuana in modern soci
ety in typical Hollywood fashion

— by dismissing it as a vague "evil." I lost my
faith in the American movie machine a while
back, because I believed that Hollywood pro
ducers thought that they could preach the rule
of the dominant class to the masses. This
movie is more of the same. Or maybe it's just
that this movie, in the words of Brian, has
"done smoked [itjself retarded."
