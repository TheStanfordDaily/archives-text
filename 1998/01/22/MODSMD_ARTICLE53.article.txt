# Fallen
## 
### 
The title says it all: "Fallen" gets
down early and never really manages
to recover from its original sluggish
ness. Though the story of "Fallen" is
farfetched, it would have been excel
lent material for an episode of Chris
Carter's "X-Files." The reason why the
story by Nicholas Kazan fails to work
is that there isn't enough original ma
terial to fill the film's two hours and
four minutes. Despite the attention
grabbing and chilling opening scene
of a serial killer being led to his execu
tion while singing "Time Is On My
Side," the film's action takes too long
to get up to speed.
The film is about supernatural
events that start taking place around
homicide detective John Hobbes
(Denzel Washington) after he has
been cursed by a serial killer moments
before his trip to the gas chamber. Be
cause the curse has been called on
Hobbes in an unknown ancient lan
guage, it takes him several trips to a
theologist to figure out what is hap
pening around him.
The film's format makes excellent
use of Washington's superior acting
skills by having Hobbes narrate the
entire story. Hobbes is telling his story
after he has escaped a close brush with
death. Washington's performance is
excellent as he goes through the emo
tional spectrum of feelings caused by
his experiences with the supernatural.
It appears that the curse caused the
evil spirit that was inside of the serial
killer to move into a new host by the
means of a simple touch.
When new murder victims are dis
covered after the execution, no one
can explain why the murders appear
to have been committed by the man

who was recently gassed. The logical
explanation would be that they are
dealing with a copycat murderer, but
too many obscure details match the
old crimes exactly. More frightening
ly, some of the items found at new
crime scenes seem directly threaten
ing to Hobbes and his family.
Hobbes' uneventful life is dramat
ically changed when it begins to paral
lel the last days of a highly decorated
policeman who shot himself in a
cabin in the woods. When Hobbes
starts to understand what he is up
against, he decides to play God and
battle the forces of evil by himself.
Some sequences in the film are
bone-chilling. At one time, Hobbes is
threatened by several normal people
who are transformed into cold
blooded monsters by a simple touch.
At another time, Hobbes' finds him
self framed for murder, and he no
longer knows who is on his side. He
realizes that the spirit of evil could
have taken residence in anybody, even
those of his friends.
The supporting cast of Donald
Sutherland as Hobbes' boss at the
precinct and John Goodman as
Hobbes" partner are rather bland.
However, in light of the movie's over
all gloominess, these performances fit
the bill. The occasional humorous
comments about food by Goodman
provided some comic relief in what
was otherwise a smart, but overly long
movie.
While "Fallen" by no means lacks
exciting scenes, the story would have
been much more gripping as a televi
sion episode.
