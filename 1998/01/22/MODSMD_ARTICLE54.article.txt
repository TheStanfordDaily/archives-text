# The Postman

### 
Kevin Costner's "The Postman"
is probably the most misunderstood
movie of the season. It's not a horri
ble movie. Audiences just never gave
it a chance to prove that it might not
be like its precedent.
"Dances With Wolves" was a
Costner-directed, Costner-pro
duced, Costner-starring 3 1/2-hour
Civil War epic that won seven Os
cars. No problem there. But then
came "Waterworld," a Costner-pro
duced, Costner-starring, post-apoca
lyptic action epic that cost hundreds
of millions of dollars and floundered
miserably.
So what do we think when we see
previews for a Costner-directed,
Costner-produced, Costner-starring,
3-hour, post-apocalyptic and Civil-
War-like action epic? We think, "It's
a cross between 'Dances With
Wolves' and 'Waterworld.' Best to
wait until it comes out on video; let's
go see that Titanic flick."
Those who wait for video are
going to miss out on the grand scale
that "The Postman" pushes on the
big screen. Costner-the-director
adds the same power and love for the
American landscape that got him the
Academy Award in 1991.
Audiences will also miss out on a
neat story about the rebirth of a post
apocalyptic America. Costner plays
an unnamed drifter who is captured

and "recruited" into a militia dictat
ed by General Bethlehem (Will Pat
ton), who keeps people in the sur
rounding towns in check by con
stantly demanding supplies and re
cruits.
The drifter escapes from the army
stronghold and comes across a U.S.
mail truck occupied by its long-de
ceased mail carrier. He dons the car
rier's uniform, takes the remaining
mail, and attempts to deliver it under
the pretense of a "Restored United
States of America."
The Postman unwittingly sparks
the patriotic hope of thousands. He
"swears in" an eager young man
named Ford Lincoln Mercury (Lar
entz Tate), who goes on to swear in
many teen-aged postal carriers. This
upsurge angers Bethlehem, who sees
his chance to finally have a war.
Like any Costner movie, "The
Postman" has a love interest, this
time in the form of a young woman
named Abby (Olivia Williams). Her
husband is killed in Bethlehem's
post-Postman rage, and she clings to
the Postman to make him feel guilty.
She's a stronger person than the
Postman, who isn't sure about what
he's started, and she pushes him to
carry things through to the bitter
end.
If "The Postman" had come out
before "Dances With Wolves" and

"Waterworld." it might have been a
big hit. Unfortunately, the cheesy
lines "Ride, Postman, ride!" and in
explicably long length fit too well
into the now-tired Costner formula.
His next picture ought to shed the ac
tion-epic thing and go for something
small and charming, like my favorite
Costner movie, "Tin Cup."
