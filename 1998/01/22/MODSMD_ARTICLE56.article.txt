## Confessions of a Pen-toting Junkie: The power of the written word
### Andrew Oyefesobi Contributing writer 
It was the summer of' 96.
I was sitting in the high-rise L.A. office of
Wilhelmina, Inc., looking out onto La Ciene
ga. The cars whizzing by seemed to rush past
the sunny day, unfazed. Meanwhile, I ig
nored the bookers, phone to ears, chatting
about nonsense: "Yes, he's in Italy right now.
He just did the Versace campaign." "No,
she's one of our big girls. She won't work for
less than $2,000 a day, dahling."
A song I hated was on the radio. It was al
ways like that at Wilhelmina. The dial was al
ways on that awful station, but the torture
would soon be over. Summer was coming to
an end, and I would soon say good-bye to the
eccentric personalities at that talent agency
... and to Anna, the cute, Italian girl that
helped me through my intern stint. The one
that was into hip hop, understood my
humor, always had good gossip and always
told me to go for it. Whatever "it"was.
Realizing that I'd soon be returning for
my final year at Vanderbilt, I wanted to know
exactly what the heck "it"was myself.
I reached for a legal pad and began to
scribble an essay on rhythm and music in
black culture. At that moment, it was me and
the yellow paper. The blank space begged to
be invaded. So, I filled the green lines with
the thoughts in my head. The more I wrote,
the more intense my high became. I was
hooked.
That was the day the written word became
my drug. "It"was writing.
To write is a most noble endeavor. To
transcribe one's thoughts on paper, fully
aware of the power in the written word, re
quires no less than a heart full of courage.
While the process is indeed commonplace,
the power in the product is unique and frig
gin' awesome.
Perhaps it is overzealous, but I wholly re
gard putting pen to paper as gutsy. I praise
writing, because it is born out of the basics,
the first thing we all learn, our ABCs. The
beauty — everybody's welcome. Yet, it is the
truly bold who recognize and exploit the fact
that these components of our communica
tion have a strength beyond oral exchange.
With my new awareness playing euphoric
tricks on my mind, I drove back to my side of
the tracks. It was me and the stretch of road
between Los Angeles and Tennessee — me
and my Ford Explorer and Seal and Pianc
Reeves and A Tribe Called Quest, and we did
it in a day and a half.
Back in Vandy Land, I decided to act on
my addiction. Pre-med was thrown out with
last semester's notes, and I applied to jour
nalism schools on a whim. Those people
write, don't they? I asked myself that putting
an envelope headed for Stanford in the mail
box.
Okay, so I'll get to write (which covers my
cause) and the title "Journalism" sounds like
I'll have a job when I'm done (which covers

Mom's concerns), I thought. I wanted des
perately to try it out first. I sent some samples
to my favorite magazine, "Vibe," and con
cluded that I'd spend my final semester in
New York — livin' it up, learnin' it down —
and I did.
In a Manhattan office decked in Wu Tang
posters and blow-ups of Snoop, Shani was
trying to get away from her desk to attend the
memorial tribute to Biggie Smalls in Brook
lyn, and reader mail still needed sifting —
people were boiling over the Mary J. Blige
cover. Carter wanted a few more celebs for
the sex survey; of course, Denzel Washington
and Wesley Snipes would pass. Ronk£ was on
the phone with Sonya Sanchez, poet and au
thor, as she unwrapped the copy of Nikki
Giovanni's "Love Poems" sent fresh from the
publisher.
I was one of the interns responsible for
making these peoples' lives easier, and I still
had a PATH train ride home to Jersey to look
forward to. But 1 liked it, because they were
writing about all that stuff and when 1 grew
up I would, too.
But those New York junkies wouldn't
share any of their stash, and I needed a fix.
So, I went home to Georgia for the summer,
and I wrote a novel. I wrote and wrote some
more. I created characters, dreamt up plots,
told a story and made a few social statements
in the process. It was me and the limitless no
tion of saying whatever I wanted to say with
writing, and I loved every excruciating sec
ond of it.
Now, I live for it — the experience of writ
ing, and, like an addict, I want no one to take
away my drug. Because I create and control
it, I know that no one ever will.
I have grown up. 1 am at Stanford. Mom is
dealing.
My lesson along the way was that every
body has something to say. The courageous
say it forever. As directed, words can enrage,
inspire, engage, inform, persuade or enlight
en. Yes, they can do all that. Once the intent
is pinpointed, daft to test it in ink Preserve
it for posterity in an article, essay, notes,
poem, novel or memoirs. After all, some of
our greatest leaders, poets, thinkers and
scribes still speak to us from the shelves of
our public libraries and private studies.
Having stumbled upon my passion, and I
can not even fathom the time when writing
didn't hold a certain potency. For me, writ
ing can be therapeutic or conscious, a way to
unwind or a way to wage war. Essentially,
points of view are communicated by modes
chosen by the ones with points to make.
Sometimes you can scream the loudest from
words on a page; yet. some pick up pistols,
others commandeer pulpits and still others
solicit public opinion at the polls.
Turns out, I'm neither one to be held up
in some plastic office, phone to ear, chatting
about nonsense, nor one to watch "power
lessly" as other addicts snort up all of the
stimulant.
So, I picked up a pen. I've never looked
back.
