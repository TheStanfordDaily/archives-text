# Funding ax falls on Med School
## Doctoral programs must deal with cuts in federal grants 
### Lydia Cheng 
Due to growing costs and decreasing
government support, the School of Medi
cine expects a $1.5 million funding deficit
for Ph D. programs this year. Dr. Carl
Rhodes, associate dean of Medical Student
and Graduate Student Affairs, explained
the situation to the Medical School Faculty
Senate in November.
Although this year's difference will be
covered by temporary funds put together
by the dean's office and various department
chairs, the problem is predicted to worsen.
As the costs of tuition and housing continue
to climb, Rhodes said the schixil budget
"could eventually have a gap of over $2 mil
lion per year."
Rhodes described how recent changes in
federal funding guidelines caused the short
fall. One new restriction limits the sources
used to pay teaching and research assis
tants. Another decision, from the National
Institutes of Health, caps the amount of

money that can be paid to students from a
research grant. Also, Rhodes expected fur
ther decreases in the number of available
NIH institutional training grants.
According to Rhodes. Ph.D. programs
in the school generally provide tuition for
each student. In addition, a stipend of
$16,500 and health insurance are supplied.
Individual students also apply for fellow
ships offered by the National Science Foun
dation and other organizations.
Vikas Duwuri, a Ph.D. student in neu
roscience. is the president of the Biomed
ical Association of Stanford Students, an
organization of doctoral students from the
biological sciences department and the
medical school. I le said he believes that the
decrease in federal funding points to the
broader issue of changing market demand
for doctoral degrees.
"There exists a trend where people are
moving away from Ph D programs because
of the job market plummeting. People are
not choosing academia and instead going

for jobs in industry, consulting, research in
stitutes or re-training.
"Given this backdrop, perhaps the fun \-
ing issue is not such a bad thing. It helps peo
ple make some tough decisions," Duwuri
said.
However, he added that he "wouldn t
want cuts to result in students who are gen
uinely interested in research to turned
away."
As Duwuri explained. Ph.D. students
are guaranteed financial support upon ac
ceptance into a program. Ph D students in
the medical school typically take six years to
complete their thesis, during which they
must serve as teaching assistants tor a max
imum of three quarters. If financial needs
worsen, Duwuri said he foresees teaching
assistant duties increasing. Other than
being required to teach, these students are
not tin) involved with funding issues.
"In general, most graduate students are
