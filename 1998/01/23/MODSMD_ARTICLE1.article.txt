## After renovations, all houses will be cleaned by University 
### Michael levin Contributing writer 
As part of the renovation program
for Row houses and the ( 'owell ( lus
ter. the University has announced
that self-operated undergraduate
housing there will he phased out, ex
cept for cmperative houses.
Renovations to four C owell C lus
ter houses will result in a transition
from student cleaning to University
cleaning, according to Director of
Housing and Dining Services Keith
Guy. Only Terra, Cowell's coopera
tive house, will remain cleaned by
residents.
"Once the Cowell Cluster and
other house renovations are com
plete. our policy will he to no longer
allow residents to clean their own
houses, with the exception of co
ops." Ciuy said.
In addition, all self-operated Row
houses which are renovated in the fu
ture will no longer he cleaned by res
idents.
"()nce we renovate the Row hous
es, we want to keep them in good
shape. ()ur experiences with resident
cleaned houses is that some students
do a good job of'cleaning, while others
do not." Guv said. "()ften, the conse

quence of a student-cleaned house is
that maintenance and repair costs are
much higher."
Ciuy acknowledges that many
Row house residents will face an in
crease in rent once renovations are
complete and University cleaning
takes over.
"With University cleaning, rent
goes up," he said. "As we move
through the Row. houses will be ren
ovated and then cleaned through
University staff, and the rental rates
will be adjusted to reflect that."
Guy insists that the University is
not implementing the new cleaning
procedure to make a profit.
"We're not doing this to make
money," he said. "In fact, we won't
make money. We are doing this to
preserve our assets, so that future
generations of students will have
nicer places to live in."
Some current Row house resi
dents are opposed to the new clean
ing policy, arguing that student
cleaned houses are more economical
and foster a stronger sense of com
munity.
"I think that student cleaning
leads to greater respect for the house
itself," said Courtney Harrison, a res
ident assistant at Whitman, one of
the Cowell houses to be affeeted by
the change. "As compared to the
dorms I have lived in. Whitman is
usually much cleaner and the resi
dents are much more likely to take
care of the house. Cleaning builds
community."
Harrison also believes that having
the option to live in a self-cleaned
house is empowering for students.

"I think the University should be
trying to expand the different types of
living situations available on this
campus, not limit them," she said.
Blake Harris, an RA at 557 May
field. believes the new cleaning policy
is not about the I Iniversity wanting to
monopolize Row house services, but
about protecting an investment.
"I just think that Stanford wants to
get the most out of its renovations,"
he said. "You put a few million into
making a place nice, and you're going
to want to spend a little more so that
it stays that way for as long as possi
ble."'
