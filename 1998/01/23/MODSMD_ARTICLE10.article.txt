## Kaczynski case comes to a close Guilty plea to avoid death penalty 
### 
SACRAMENTO. Calif. (AF)
Theodore Kac/ynski admitted
yesterday he is the anti-technology
terrorist known as the Unabomber,
pleading guilty in a deal with the
government that will send him to
prison for life.
The 55-year-old mathematics
professor turned woodland hermit
entered the plea in a mid-afternoon
hearing, on the day a jury was to be
sworn in and opening statements
were to begin.
The agreement avoids the possi
bility of his execution. Had the jury
convicted Kaczynski, he could have
faced death by injection.
His motivations and that of the
government were oddly aligned.
Judged by a prison psychiatrist to be
paranoid schizophrenic, Kaczynski
did not want to be portrayed in
court as a madman. Prosecutors,
meanwhile, clearly did not want to
be perceived as trying to execute a
mentally ill man.
A senior federal official in Wash
ington said that a report submitted
only days ago by a federal Bureau
of Prisons psychiatrist was the deci
sive factor.
Dr. Sally Johnson concluded that
Kaczynski was competent to stand
trial but suffered from paranoid
schizophrenia, an illness marked by
delusions and a potential for vio
lence.
The agreement resolves all feder
al charges against Kaczynski grow
ing out of the 17-year string of
bombings that killed three people —
two in the Sacramento area and one
in New Jersey — and injured 2V.
A plea bargain had been dis
cussed for months, but was repeat
edly turned down by the govern
ment because Kaczynski insisted on
certain conditions. At the last
minute, his lawyers dropped all
demands.
As Kaczynski entered his plea,
details of his crimes were revealed lor

the first time. In a journal entry dis
cussing the first fatal attack — that of
Sacramento computer store owner
Hugh Scrutton in 1985 — Kaczynski
wrote: "Excellent. A humane way of
eliminating somebody. He probably
didn't feel a thing."
Noting that a $25,(MM) reward had
been placed on his head after that
attack. Kaczynski called it "flatter
ing."
After admitting to all of the
charged offenses, Kaczynski then
admitted his role in Unabomber
attacks in which he had not been
charged.
The agreement came shortly
after U.S. District Judge Garland
Hurrell Jr. ruled that Kaczynski
could not fire his court appointed
lawyers and represent himself.
Kaczynski. in entering his plea,
assured the judge that he was satis
fied with his legal representation. "I
am willing to proceed with sentenc
ing with the present counsel." he
said.
Burrell said that to abandon the
mental illness defense that Kaczyn
ski's lawyers had advocated would
turn the courts into "a suicide forum
for a criminal defendant."
Kaczynski's attorneys, Quin
Denvir and Judy Clarke, had said
their client could not endure a trial
that would portray him as — in
Kaczynski's words — a "sickie."
David Kaczynski — who first
alerted federal officials that his
brother might be the Unabomber
— sat in a front row of the court
room with their 80-year-old mother.
Wanda.
The defendant, who has been
estranged from them for 12 years,
never acknowledged their presence.
Also in court were the families of
two men killed in Unabomber
attacks. Gilbert Murray and Hugh
Scrutton died in separate incidents
after opening explosives-filled
packages.
