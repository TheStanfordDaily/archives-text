# President denies accusations of affair with former intern
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi
dent Clinton sought to calm the
firestorm over his alleged aliair
with a White I louse intern yester
day as his friend Vernon Jordan
acknowledged that he tried to get
the young woman a job when she
left Washington — and took her to
see a lawyer after she came under
scrutiny.
Monica Lewinsky remained out
of sight as she prepared for a depo
sition today in the Paula Jones sex
ual harassment case.
Clinton firmly denied all accusa
tions. With Yassar Arafat at his side
in a surreal moment of White
House diplomacy, he made his
firmest denial yet to Ms. Lewinksy's
claims that she had an affair with
Clinton and that he and Jordan
asked her to deny it to Jones* attor
neys.
"The allegations are false, and I
would never ask anybody to do
anything other than tell the truth."
Clinton said. Lewinsky herself has
denied the claims she made in tape
recorded conversations with her
friend Linda Tripp. Jordan added
to the denials at a press conference
yesterday afternoon in remarks the
White 1 louse hoped would dampen
political speculation in Washington.
"I want to say to you absolutely
and unequivocally that Ms. Lewin
sky told me in no uncertain terms
that she did not have a sexual rela
tionship with the president," Jordan
told reporters. He would not
answer any questions.
The denials came as details
emerged about Ms. Lewinsky's
entries to the White House and
gifts she got from the president.
FBI agents working for Whitewater
prosecutor Kenneth Starr were
contacting other interns, including
some who apparently still work at
the White 1 louse, according to offi
cials.
Starr promised to move swiftly
to sort through explosive allega

tions that were the talk of the
nation. Starr, a Republican tapped
to pursue Whitewater issues, reject
ed suggestions he might be out to
"get" (linton. "Our |ob is to gather
facts and to evaluate those facts and
to get at the truth."he said. I le said
the investigation would be pursued
"consistent with the presumption of
innocence."
Clinton sought to avoid any
defensiveness as he faced questions
about the Lewinsky matter during a
photo session with Palestinian lead
er Arafat.
"You and the American people
have a right to get answers." he told
reporters. "We will give you as
many answers as we can. as soon as
we can. at the appropriate time ...
and that's not a dodge."
Clinton met earlier yesterday
with his legal advisers about how to
comply with subpoenas demanding
documents related to the matter.
Investigators refused to com
ment publicly on what they know,
but details trickled out from
unidentified sources. I he new reve
lations centered on:
—Gifts. In a sworn deposition
on the Jones case last weekend.
Clinton denied a sexual relation
ship with the woman but acknowl
edged providing her some gilts,
including a dress, officials told I he
Associated Press.
—White House visits. White
House records show several visits
by Ms. Lewinsky to the ()val ()ffice
after she had transferred to a job at
the Pentagon last year. She usually
checked in to see Clinton's person
al secretary. Betty Currie. who was
a friend, officials told the AP.
Jordan, a Washington lawyer,
read a brief statement to reporters
in which he acknowledged trying to
help Lewinsky get a job in New
York, and arranging her represen
tation by lawyer Frank Carter after
she was subpoenaed by Starr.
"1 actually took her to Mr.

Carter's office. I introduced them
and I returned to my office." Jor
dan said.
Jordan said he often helped indi
\iduals from the Clinton camp

obtain jobs. He said he had been
served with a subp<vena b\ Starr on
Wednesday and would cooperate,
and he was adamant that he never
suggested Lewinsk\ lie.
