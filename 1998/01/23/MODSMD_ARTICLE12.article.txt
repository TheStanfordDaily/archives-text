# Pope holds Mass in Cuba
## Scolds government on abortion, lack of Catholic education 
### 
SANTA CLARA, Cuba (AP) — On his first full
day in "this beloved country." Pope John Paul II went
straight to the hearts and home life of the Cuban peo
ple. despairing over the island's easy access to abortion
and scolding the Castro government for closing the
doors to Catholic education.
When it comes to schools, "parents.. .should be
able to choose," the pope declared, to applause from
tens of thousands assembled for Mass in the dust and
sweltering heat of an athletic field in this provincial
city.
The demand for Catholic education was also
believed high on John Paul's agenda for the most
important official encounter of his five-day visit — a
meeting yesterday with President Fidel Castro.
In just two addresses over less than 24 hours, 011 the
first papal visit ever to this Caribbean nation, the pon
tiff has been blunt in listing what he considers failings
along with accomplishments — of Cuba's commu
nist system.
And in this unprecedentedly open, high-profile crit

icism of the 39-year-old revolution, he has found help
from a surprising quarter — the system itself.
The Communist Party newspaper, (iranma. pub
lished Wednesday's papal arrival speech, including its
call for "a climate of freedom" in Cuba. Even more
important, the government is devoting hours of nation
al television time to the papal events, giving the mere
ly curious —in bars, shops and homes a hca\ v help
ing of John Paul's message.
What the curious saw yesterday was an outpouring
of deep emotion and affection for the 77-vear-old pon
tiff after he flew in for a half-day in this heartland city.
"We feel it! We feel it! The pope is here among us!"
the crowd chanted as the "popemobile," a white pick
up truck topped by a bulletproof-glass compartment,
wended its way toward the open-air altar.
Before, after and throughout the Mass — even as
the ailing, slow-moving pope distributed communion
a vast chorus and orchestra filled the air with the
romantic, lilting beat of "son." the sound of ( üba.
maracas and drums set to Roman Catholic prayer.
