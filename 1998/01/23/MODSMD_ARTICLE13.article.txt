Marchers mark 25
years of Roe v. Wade
WASHINGTON (AT)
Twenty-five years to the da\ after
the Supreme Court legalized
abortion, thousands ol opponents
marched to the court with chil
dren in tins yesterday. Counter
parts held giant coat hangers aloft
as a symbol of suffering endured
when the procedure was illegal.
"Abortion stops a beating
heart." said the slogan stitched
into the sweater of a woman
demonstrator. Other marchers
carried banners which read
"Emancipate the unborn" or
addressed to President Clinton
"Bill, do you feel the pain?"
Another was addressed to Ins
wife: "Hillarv. abortion isn't child

care."
But with Congress in recess
and the capital preoccupied with
an embattled president trying to
cope with new accusations of se\
ual promiscuity, the annual effort
to whip up sentiment caused hare
ly a flutter.
