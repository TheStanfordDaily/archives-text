## Editorial Keep basic research

Scramble for funding,
corporate sponsorships
may kill pure research.

S TANFORD INC. SHOULD remem
ber that basic research is fundamental
to its future direction — and be sure
to maintain the ability to perform basic
research for research sake, as is befitting a
world-class university.
With the loss of the revenue that Stan
ford had received from its patent on the
processes for recombinant DNA, Stanford
finds itself in a financial quandary as rev
enues drop from $50 million to $15 million.
As any graduate student can tell you, the
quest for funding of research topics can be
extremely difficult — especially in some of
the more esoteric regions of basic research.
Many research grants are funded by indus
try for the advancement of their current
technology needs and maybe five tears
down the line.
But the future trends of civilization are
not determined by the relatively short-term
goals of companies. Fundamental research
problems are often at the heart of incredi

hie advances in our society and civilization.
Take a look back in 19N0. when Mar
garet Jacks Hall was populated by com
puter science professors and graduate stu
dents examining the nuances of such pro
gramming paradigms and network archi
tecture.
At that time, government funding pro
vided the capital for basic research that pro
pelled much of what is now Silicon Valley.
Former Computer Science Prof. Jim Clark,
once CEO of Silicon Graphics and
Netscape, Dr. Andy Bechtolsheim, founder
of SIJN Microsystems and Granite Systems
and even Cisco founders Len Bosack and
Sandy Lerner all grew from the environ
ment that was engendered in the halls of
Margaret Jacks in its pursuit of basic
research.
As Stanford Inc. looks for more funding
sources to replace those which are depleted,
it should balance the needs of its partners
with the needs of the products it puts out
into the world after the fact. Is it necessary
for Stanford's growth that we continue as a
subsidiary of the corporations that fund
research projects, or is the liniversii
responsible for developing people and nur
turing seeds that will take our society in
directions unheard and unexplored?
