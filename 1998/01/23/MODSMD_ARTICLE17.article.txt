Course Guide held up
but will be ready soon
Mea culpa.
Saurahh Prakash was exactly right in his
article of last week: The ASSI I said it would
produce a Course Guide in time for the
selection of winter quarter classes, and, sim
ply, it did not. There is. of course, no excuse
for not delivering on that commitment, hut
there is an explanation.
As work progressed on this first student
run course-evaluation effort in more than
five years, we realized that the task facing us
was much greater than we anticipated.
Early on, we recognized that to produce a
guide hoth useful to the students and
respected hv the faculty would take far
more time than we had at our disposal.
That's why we initially scaled hack to a
World Wide Web site-only concept.
Hut even that was tougher than we imag
ined. We ran into problems retrieving and
transferring data from the University, and
we discovered very late in the game that
some of the data we had been given was in
fact miscalculated. Near the end of fall
quarter, after the last Daily had been print
ed, we recognized that the risks (i.e., useless
information for students, irritation for fac
ulty) associated with putting limited data on
the Web far outweighed the potential bene
fits. It seemed clear that the best way to pro
duce a useful book in time for spring quar
ter was to cut our losses and produce noth
ing for winter quarter.
Our error was not in action but in com
munication. We should have explained the

situation to students anticipating a Web
based Course Ciuide, but we did not. With
out any more Dailys for the quarter, we saw
no cost-effective way of notifying students.
Hut that is not an excuse, and we apologize
for our lack of candor about the state of the
guide.
At this point, though, we are hard at
work on a Spring Quarter Course Guide, to
be distributed at the end of this quarter. Let
me tell you a bit about the project.
I'he guide will include more than 2(X)
courses in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences. Excepted will be those intended for
graduate students only and those with tradi
tionally low enrollments, probably below 20
(although we have yet to set the specific cut
off point). Dean John Shoven's office will
release the quantitative evaluation data for
those courses in which more than 50 percent
of student completed surveys. That is not to
say that classes with insufficient sample sizes
will not be included in the guide: rather, they
will be listed in the guide but without those
particular data points.
The information to included for each
course includes meetings per week, work
load (e.g.. two midterms, one paper, one
final), grading (e.g.. 40 percent midterm, 10
percent problem sets, 50 percent final),
number of required books, approximate
cost of those books and.in most cases, last
year's enrollment, course rating and
instructor rating. There will also be a short
paragraph describing the course and the
instructor.
Officials from Shoven's office. Vice
Provost Ramon Saldfvar's office, the Regis
trar's Office, the I'ndergraduate Advising

Center and the Bookstore have been
tremendously helpful and generous as we
have moved along on this project. Deputy
Senate Chair Matt Spence, the project's
director, joins me in thanking them for their
hard work ;ind support, and in asking both
The Daily and the students for their under
standing as we work to produce a useful and
responsible ASSU Course Guide.

Government needs to
respect personal beliefs
I respect Garry Grundy's views on the
beginning of life and would never try to
change them. However, he must realize that
his belief (yes, it is just that — a BELIEF)
that life begins at conception is a private
and personal belief, often based on a per
son's religion. This belief is not. as he
claims, the view of the majority of the
American people. In fact, recent polls indi
cate the opposite.
But the real point is that the government
has no place in deciding for each person in
this country what to believe. That is what
Roe v. Wade says. On this 25th anniversary
of Roe v. Wade, we should all be grateful
that our Supreme ( ourt was wise enough to
keep the government out of such a private
and difficult decision. If we let the govern
ment make this sort of personal decision for
us. what's to prevent the I Jnited States from
becoming like C hina. where the government

forces women to undergo abortions, no mat
ter what their individual beliefs and desires?
Let's all have enough faith in the women of
this country, and their loved ones, to make
the decision that is right for them.

Feel-good topics are not
The Daily's job
The disregard some people on this cam
pus have for freedom of expression and the
disproportionate importance they assign to
"not getting (emotionally) hurt" never ceas
es to amaze me. They seem to believe that
the point of one's existence is to "feel good"
and whatever annoys, insults, irritates or
otherwise creates discomfort should be
banished, or at least counter-balanced with
a soothing, sleep-inducing alternative.
This attitude is exemplified by two let
ters that appeared in The Daily on two con
secutive days, one on Jan. 20 titled "Jesus
jokes aren't funny," by Franz Busse and
one on Jan. 21 titled "Grundy's column
ignores women's difficulties." by Courtney
Clark. While it so happens I agree with the
"beef" of both letters, they each contain a
sentence that is emblematic of the whining
attitude I described previously.
Busse writes "It is unfortunate that The
Daily would print something that disturbs a
large part of the Stanford community" and
later on "Let us look to other topics for our
humor, topics that will not touch such ten
der areas for anyone." Clark writes "It is

highly unfair that The Daily allowed a
columnist to discuss an issue as complicated
as abortion without providing a forum lor
additional viewpoints."
I felt insulted by the cartoon that Busse
complains about. I am glad that somebody
complained about it, especially given the
fuss over each and every "racial" or sexist or
lookist joke (and incidentally, yesterday's
obnoxious cartoon about Sonny Bono con
firmed that Daily cartoonists have no taste
whatsoever). But I don't like his attitude (no
offense. Fran/). It suggests that The Daily
only prints things that feel good and are not
disturbing anyone, which probably trans
lates to being bland and boring, not to men
tion probably uninformative. But in the
course of commenting on the news, unpop
ular and disturbing views will be expressed
and that is the essence of pluralism in the
press. If only what "feels good" gets printed,
then intelligent discussion about difficult
topics will soon disappear.
As to what Clark wrote. I wonder what
makes her think that expressing an unpop
ular or disturbing opinion is "unfair"?
Unfair to who? As a matter of fact. The
Daily is providing a forum for additional
viewpoints, so I guess what Clark wanted
was some sort of instant pacification: A
piece on the importance of reproductive
rights, right next to Grundy's "disturbing"
piece, so that one can grab the pacifier
instantly, not allowing anxiety, discomfort
and ((iod forbid!) complicated thoughts to
arise. Now. isn't that nice?

for our lack of candor about the state of the
guide.
At this point, though, we are hard at
work on a Spring Quarter Course Guide, to
be distributed at the end of this quarter. Let
me tell you a bit about the project.
I'he guide will include more than 2(X)
courses in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences. Excepted will be those intended for
graduate students only and those with tradi
tionally low enrollments, probably below 20
(although we have yet to set the specific cut
off point). Dean John Shoven's office will
release the quantitative evaluation data for
those courses in which more than 50 percent
of student completed surveys. That is not to
say that classes with insufficient sample sizes
will not be included in the guide: rather, they
will be listed in the guide but without those
particular data points.
The information to included for each
course includes meetings per week, work
load (e.g.. two midterms, one paper, one
final), grading (e.g.. 40 percent midterm, 10
percent problem sets, 50 percent final),
number of required books, approximate
cost of those books and.in most cases, last
year's enrollment, course rating and
instructor rating. There will also be a short
paragraph describing the course and the
instructor.
Officials from Shoven's office. Vice
Provost Ramon Saldfvar's office, the Regis
trar's Office, the I'ndergraduate Advising

Center and the Bookstore have been
tremendously helpful and generous as we
have moved along on this project. Deputy
Senate Chair Matt Spence, the project's
director, joins me in thanking them for their
hard work ;ind support, and in asking both
The Daily and the students for their under
standing as we work to produce a useful and
responsible ASSU Course Guide.

Government needs to
respect personal beliefs
I respect Garry Grundy's views on the
beginning of life and would never try to
change them. However, he must realize that
his belief (yes, it is just that — a BELIEF)
that life begins at conception is a private
and personal belief, often based on a per
son's religion. This belief is not. as he
claims, the view of the majority of the
American people. In fact, recent polls indi
cate the opposite.
But the real point is that the government
has no place in deciding for each person in
this country what to believe. That is what
Roe v. Wade says. On this 25th anniversary
of Roe v. Wade, we should all be grateful
that our Supreme ( ourt was wise enough to
keep the government out of such a private
and difficult decision. If we let the govern
ment make this sort of personal decision for
us. what's to prevent the I Jnited States from
becoming like C hina. where the government

forces women to undergo abortions, no mat
ter what their individual beliefs and desires?
Let's all have enough faith in the women of
this country, and their loved ones, to make
the decision that is right for them.

Feel-good topics are not
The Daily's job
The disregard some people on this cam
pus have for freedom of expression and the
disproportionate importance they assign to
"not getting (emotionally) hurt" never ceas
es to amaze me. They seem to believe that
the point of one's existence is to "feel good"
and whatever annoys, insults, irritates or
otherwise creates discomfort should be
banished, or at least counter-balanced with
a soothing, sleep-inducing alternative.
This attitude is exemplified by two let
ters that appeared in The Daily on two con
secutive days, one on Jan. 20 titled "Jesus
jokes aren't funny," by Franz Busse and
one on Jan. 21 titled "Grundy's column
ignores women's difficulties." by Courtney
Clark. While it so happens I agree with the
"beef" of both letters, they each contain a
sentence that is emblematic of the whining
attitude I described previously.
Busse writes "It is unfortunate that The
Daily would print something that disturbs a
large part of the Stanford community" and
later on "Let us look to other topics for our
humor, topics that will not touch such ten
der areas for anyone." Clark writes "It is

highly unfair that The Daily allowed a
columnist to discuss an issue as complicated
as abortion without providing a forum lor
additional viewpoints."
I felt insulted by the cartoon that Busse
complains about. I am glad that somebody
complained about it, especially given the
fuss over each and every "racial" or sexist or
lookist joke (and incidentally, yesterday's
obnoxious cartoon about Sonny Bono con
firmed that Daily cartoonists have no taste
whatsoever). But I don't like his attitude (no
offense. Fran/). It suggests that The Daily
only prints things that feel good and are not
disturbing anyone, which probably trans
lates to being bland and boring, not to men
tion probably uninformative. But in the
course of commenting on the news, unpop
ular and disturbing views will be expressed
and that is the essence of pluralism in the
press. If only what "feels good" gets printed,
then intelligent discussion about difficult
topics will soon disappear.
As to what Clark wrote. I wonder what
makes her think that expressing an unpop
ular or disturbing opinion is "unfair"?
Unfair to who? As a matter of fact. The
Daily is providing a forum for additional
viewpoints, so I guess what Clark wanted
was some sort of instant pacification: A
piece on the importance of reproductive
rights, right next to Grundy's "disturbing"
piece, so that one can grab the pacifier
instantly, not allowing anxiety, discomfort
and ((iod forbid!) complicated thoughts to
arise. Now. isn't that nice?
