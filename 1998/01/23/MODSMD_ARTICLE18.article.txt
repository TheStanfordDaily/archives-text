## Mr. President, I want your job 
### 
The thought
suddenly occurred
to me that because
Chelsea Clinton wisely
came to Stanford, chances
are pretty gosh darn good
that her dad has a sub
scription to this not too

shabby paper. Whether he, or anyone for
that matter, reads the Opinions page, is a
matter of some question. But in the off
chance lie does, I've got some things to say.
1 gained some respect for your education
agenda while interning in the Goals 2(MK)
office of the U.S. Dept. of Education. You
should call Tom Fagan up and tell him what
a great job they're doing in that office. I'm
convinced no one works better or harder in
the entire department than Tom and his
dedicated staff. And hey, keep pushing for
the national tests. Maybe if the A I F and
the FBI kill some more of those "local con
trol" fanatics, you can get somewhere with
that.
Mr. President, let me just get straight to
the point: I want your job.
1 want your job because I don't think you
or many of those who came before you have
done enough to realize the potential of
either your office or our country. Realizing
of course that you have no need to worry
about re-election, it's time to lay it all out.
Break some ground and show some real
leadership. Leadership is not using poll
results to determine your policy agenda.
Leadership is helping to institutionalize jus
tice. Accordingly, I not so humbly offer two
ideas, limited as 1 am by space constraints.

1. An athlete boycott
Imagine if all the superstar athletes of
basketball, baseball, football and hockey
refused to play until team owners, corpo
rate sponsors and television networks gave
millions of dollars, no strings attached, to
renovate and/or build schools in the cities
their teams play. The state of disrepair in
America's schools (the Rebuild America's
Schools Act was a great idea!) is a very visu
al problem well suited for television and
other media venues. The publicity created
by such an event would also allow for
greater awareness of other pressing educa
tion issues that aren't as easily understood
as a leaky roof or broken windows.
Whether they like it or not, athletes are
role models. Children look up to them as
heroes. This is their opportunity to really
be a hero, to actually earn their multi-mil
lion dollar paychecks, by leveraging the
power and influence they have to help chil
dren.
2. A grander vision for America's universities
1 know you're rather fond of General
Colin Powell, and I can understand why.
When he came to Stanford last quarter and
talked about the organization America's
Promise: The Alliance for Youth, 1 found
him to be a very honest, straightforward
and likable guy genuinely interested in
doing what he can to create greater oppor
tunities for youth. While he strongly
encouraged us to become a positive influ
ence in a child's life through mentoring, one
of my colleagues asked a very poignant
question: Given the vast amount of

resources available at Stanford and other
universities, isn't asking students to volun
teer a few hours a week expecting too little?
Shouldn't we up the ante?
The answer. 1 think you will agree, is yes.
Our president, Gerhard Casper, often
argues that the University should not and
cannot take a political stance on important
social issues of the day. To roughly echo the
words of Arturo Rodriguez, president of
the United Farm Workers, we're not talking
about political issues hut justice issues. By
adopting a system of benign neglect, by not
fully devoting this University's resources to
the advancement of all people in our sur
rounding communities and society and by
not creating an environment in which our
prestigious faculty are actively encouraged
to pursue work relevant to such advance
ment. the University your own daughter
attends is endorsing the very status quo you
recognize as unjust.
America's major research universities,
starting with Stanford, should devote them
selves to the idea of research as a form of
public service. Use your influence to hold
President Casper and this University's
administration nationally accountable to a
higher standard.
Mr. President, you are very lucky to be in
a position where you can positively affect
the lives of millions. Polls and politics and
your historical legacy aside, just do the right
thing.
