# Showering with the boys
## Vanessa Bartsch Finding the divide: big babies and brats 
### 
I THINK I must be getting old. or maybe I
am just becoming intolerant. Maybe I
have been at Stanford long enough that
the two are becoming synonymous. It is just
that I can't stand some people. And lately I
REALLY can't stand younger people. Ii is
not that I necessarily think all young people
are bad. Kids can be cute. Sure, they can
whine when they are hungry, cry when you
take their toys, get cranky when the\ don't
nap and pull hair when they are angry, but so
can my sister and she's 22.
Once, a 5-year-old I was baby-sitting
threw a huge lnink of pink slime up into the
rotating ceiling fan. cut the cat's fur with
those "paper-only" scissors and swallowed a
I ego seconds aftei I pulled it out of his nose.
My sister, as a 4-year-old, once decided to
play "nativity" after being left for a weekend
with a very religious neighbor. She made me

baby Jesus, and I'm not sure if she was Ciod
or Mary. She took of my clothes and put me
on the couch (the manger). Then she pro
ceeded to dust the entire living room with an
entire bottle of talcum powder, which she
later identified as snow.
I myself have even had a few golden
K<xlak moments in the album of adolescents.
I once had a sitter who used to tickle me until
I cried and one day I bit her. Hard.
Fur grows back, talcum powder can be
vacuumed up. And I have since begun to eat
only what is served to me.
Kids will be kids. Sometimes they do
things that we can't understand and that's
okay. Hut there comes a time when there
must be consequences for their actions. But
the other day, 10 pre-pubescent little mon
sters infuriated me more than any 5 vear-old
with scissors EVER could.

I went out for luneh at a great little place
over on California Ave. The place is small
and is a bit tarnished around the edges, but it
serves some mighty fine dim sum. There is
always a line shooting out the door like the
DMV, and getting one of the five tables
requires some shady maneuvering or a good
amount of waiting. The place is run entirely
by one couple. They do it all. And therefore,
everything takes a while. We could all use a
little more time to reflect, so no worries.
I"he offending gang of 13-year-olds was
swarming the counter and had taken over the
entire restaurant I hey had the manners of
goats. What got to me was the pushing and
yelling. The boys constantly humping into
me while they were trying to hold there 20-
sizes-too-big / what-the-HELL-do-you
have-IN-there? pants up.
But what sent me over the edge was the

verbal abuse they were dishing out to the
woman at the counter Apparently her hus
band had picked a great time to go shopping,
so she was left by herself to c<x>k. take orders
and serve the masses. The monsters in front
of me were impatient, bossy and rude. When
she couldn't understand an order, they would
scream it back at her and laugh. They got in
her face and degraded her. No one deserves
this sort of atrocity.
First of all I want to know why they
weren't in school at 1:30 p.m. on a Wednes
day. In my public school world, they stapled
my behind to a chair and kept me down for
four years solid. Yet these puny ambassadors
of rudeness were wandering free.
I accept that there are some pretty terrible
parents. lack of parents and rotten home sit
uations. but I hardly think these teen-angst
ridden brats didn't know any better.

When was it that they went had? Fron
the cute but devilish antics of 6-year-olds
they graduated t« > unchecked rudeness
In the summer I teach swimming and I an
deputized to gi\e civilian violations to rude
tourists that's right. badge and all So ;
couple vulgarities, and I can dish out a $25
ticket. ()h. the power
Maybe that's what we need more <>l. Let' v
fine them. Arrest them for rudeness I hest
kids went from cute to rude all to soon, and
we can't just stand by Maybe what they need
is a good whupping. So it you see them, wan
denng the streets of Palo Alto or roller blad
ing on the steps < if the Ouad. keep \our eye
on them. Ihe\ aren't seven anymore.
