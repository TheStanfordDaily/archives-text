# No ROTC classes held on the Farm
## Low enrollment leaves commute only option

The Army ROTC. after receiv
ing approval from the Registrar's
Office to conduct classes on the
Stanford campus for the first time
since 1973, will not be teaching
classes this quarter due to low en
rollment.
ROTC students at Stanford have
had to commute to other Bay Area
campuses in the years since the pro
gram left campus amid a storm of
protest. Navy RO TC students com
mute as much as an hour to UC-
Berkeley. Air Force ROTC stu
dents travel weekly to San Jose
State.
Two Army RO TC classes were
taught at Stanford last quarter:
"History of the IJS Military Profes

sion" and "Organizational Leader
ship Theory." All other Army
ROTC activities are held at Santa
Clara University.
"The biggest part is getting the
word out that courses are avail
able," said I t. Col. Robert Reed.
"Five students showed up [for class]
the first day, but for different rea
sons. none ended up panning out."
One problem is the low number
of Army ROTC cadets at Stanford.
"We have two to five cadets in each
class from Stanford," said Reed.
But the classes have an appeal
outside the military especially for
political science or history majors,
said Reed. "What I have to do is
demonstrate the quality of the
courses for accreditation."
