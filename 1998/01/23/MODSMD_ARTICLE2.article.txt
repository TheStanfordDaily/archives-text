# No ROTC classes held on the Farm
## Low enrollment leaves commute only option

The Army ROTC. after receiv
ing approval from the Registrar's
Office to conduct classes on the
Stanford campus for the first time
since 1973, will not be teaching
classes this quarter due to low en
rollment.
ROTC students at Stanford have
had to commute to other Bay Area
campuses in the years since the pro
gram left campus amid a storm of
protest. Navy RO TC students com
mute as much as an hour to UC-
Berkeley. Air Force ROTC stu
dents travel weekly to San Jose
State.
Two Army RO TC classes were
taught at Stanford last quarter:
"History of the IJS Military Profes

sion" and "Organizational Leader
ship Theory." All other Army
ROTC activities are held at Santa
Clara University.
"The biggest part is getting the
word out that courses are avail
able," said I t. Col. Robert Reed.
"Five students showed up [for class]
the first day, but for different rea
sons. none ended up panning out."
One problem is the low number
of Army ROTC cadets at Stanford.
"We have two to five cadets in each
class from Stanford," said Reed.
But the classes have an appeal
outside the military especially for
political science or history majors,
said Reed. "What I have to do is
demonstrate the quality of the
courses for accreditation."
Currently. Stanford does not
award transfer credit — which
would be considered as credit from
Santa Clara University — to Army
ROTC courses. Only two ROTC
courses have been approved by
Stanford for transfer credit — both
of them in the Navy program.
Reed is in the process of sending
course material to the Registrar's
Office so that courses can be re
viewed for accreditation.
At this point, "we are still re
viewing the Army ROTC re
quests." said University Registrar
Roger Printup.
John Carl, a junior electrical en
gineering major, is among those
who commute to Santa Clara every
week for ROTC.

"Its hard, but not that hard" said
Carl.
Classes at Stanford would not be
a "huge deal" for Carl as junior and
senior ROTC cadets must com
mute to complete their leadership
training at the other campuses.
There are no plans to re-estab
lish an ROTC program at Stanford,
according to Reed.
"It's not a matter of Stanford not
allowing us; it's a matter of Army
not pursuing it; it's because of the
plain cutbacks all over the mili
tary," said Reed.
Reed also said that offering
courses to upperclass students "is
totally a matter of numbers."
Reed stressed that it was not too
late to offer on-campus courses this
quarter. If students express interest
before the deadline for adding
courses, classes could be moved
back to campus.
