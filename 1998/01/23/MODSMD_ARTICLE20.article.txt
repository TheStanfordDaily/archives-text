It wasn't a pretty win, hut maybe that had
something to do with the Maples mystique
Washington State head eoach Harold Rhodes
talked about after the game.
At any rate, the No. 13 Stanford women's
basketball team (9-5,6-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
cruised out of Maples with a 91-53 win over the
Cougars (8-7, 2-4) and sole possession of first
place in the Pac-1() thanks to seventh-ranked
Arizona's 6K-66 loss to ()regon.

■ SATURDAY: Stanford vs. Washington at
Maples Pavilion, 7:30 p.m.

But the first four minutes of the game were
anything hut a blowout. Washington State
drained three early three pointers, and the Card
had committed five turnovers by the I6:(X) mark.
That translated into a 10-4 Cougar lead, but
upset hopes wouldn't last long.
"We're trying to figure out a way to take the
first 4 minutes and multiply it by 10," Rhodes
said. " This is the first time this team has played a
mystique instead of competing against a team
the mystique of playing a win streak and at
Maples. I'm embarrassed that we played as

poorly as we did."
From that point on it was all Stanford. The
Card scored 12 unanswered and went on a 24-4
run over the next eight minutes to put the game
away early. Senior forward Kristin F-Olkl came
off the bench to spark the run. scoring 10 quick
points and capping the run with a layup at the
K:4b mark.
Stanford stretched the lead to IK at the half.
45-27, but play on both sides was somewhat
sloppy. The Cardinal's 15 first-half turnovers
were topped only by Washington State's 16. The
( ougars didn't do much with the ball when they
didn't lose it, shooting just 39 percent from the
field.
"Folkl coming in kind of turned the tide for
them." Rhodes said. "1 think she changed the
tempo of the game. When she came in things
started happening for them. She definitely made
a big difference."
What made a big difference in the second
half was the way Stanford took care of the ball.
After coughing it up 15 times in the first half, the
Card turned the ball over just three times in the
first 15 minutes of the second.
Sophomore guards Milena Flores. Melody
Peterson, C hristina Batastiniand Yvonne Gbal
azeh platooned the ball-handling duties as Stan
ford's lead continued to swell.
It reached its peak, 45 points, when junior
guard Regan Freuen hit freshman center Car
olyn Moos for an open layup with 2:44 remain-
