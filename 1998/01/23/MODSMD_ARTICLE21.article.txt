# Lineup questions emerging as Folkl again shines off bench
## 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
A team-high 22 points on nine
of-10 shooting in only 25 minutes
of action, .lust another day at the
office for junior forward Kristin
Folkl.
"Gee, Kristin, what was up with
that shot you missed?" Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer jok
ingly asked Folkl as they entered
the press room.
While actually a pretty valid
question — Folkl leads the Pacific

10 Conference in field goal per
centage with a 73 percent clip —
the more striking question may be
this: Why is Folkl coming off the
bench?
The numbers don't lie. After
last night's 93-51 win over Wash
ington State, the two-sport su
perathelete is averaging 17.6 points
per contest, which is a shade be
hind senior center Olympia Scott's
17.X average. Folkl also averages
nearly two rebounds better than
Scott, a team-leading V.3 per con
test — all while averaging 25 min

utes.
All along. VanDerveer's plan
has been to have Folkl as the ace up
her sleeve, providing instant of
fense and terrorizing opposing
front lines with her relentless re
bounding. Her spark off the bench
would be the dagger in opponent's
hearts — a decisive game-breaker
that does it all. And all the while,
she would push starters like Scott
and senior forward Heather Owen
to plav better.
a very difficult nlfttchup
for anyone," said Washini>ton

State head coach Harold Rhodes.
"It was a different Stanford team
when she took the floor. Maybe
there's a way to get an extended
volleyball season or maybe we
should have played Stanford in
November."
So if Folkl strikes fear in oppos
ing coaches' hearts, why not instill
that scare right from the opening
tap? Why wait until the team
seems to hit a lull, as they did last
nnilit auainst a mediocre Washing
ton State squad?
"To me, it's irrelevant." Van-
Derveer said about Folkl's starting
prospects. Folkl is "the type of
player that doesn't get caught up in
that. It helps me to know she's com
ing in and 1 think it pushes other
people, too."
Additionally, VanDerveer also
feels a certain loyalty to Owen. The
senior forward has been oozing
with potential for more than three
seasons, and now with fellow for
ward Naomi Mulitauoapele out for
the year, this is a big opportunity
for Owen to shine. She has defi
nitely produced, scoring nearly 1 1
points a game, including a season
high 21 against Connecticut last
month.
"Heather's weathered a lot of
storms for us." VanDerveer said.
Owen "has been here every day.
and 1 feel a loyalty to her, and she's
getting the first shot. It's not taking
away from our team and maybe if
Heather wasn't a senior, it would
be different. But this is Heather's
team more than it is Kristin's team.
And Heather's been playing some
great basketball."
But lately, the numbers have not
been as consistent. Against UCLA
Sunday. Owen had eight points and
three rebounds in only 14 minutes
of plav while last night's totals (four
points, five rebounds in 11 min
utes) were also a bit disconcerting.
While it may not really matter in a
38-point blowout, it's anyone's
guess what is going through Owen's
mind when she sees Folkl (20
points, 15 rebounds Sunday) be
coming the go-to player down the
stretch against the Bruins. Will
VanDerveer do the same come
tournament time and there's a
game to be won?
"By starting Heather. 1 think it's
a message to her that I have confi
dence in her," VanDerveer said.
"We all know Kristin's great, but 1
want it for Heather. I won't sav 1

won't re-evaluate it. but I don't
think things will change."
But that only brings up another
issue altogether. When does Van-
Derveer pull the trigger on starting
Folkl. if at all? And it' she does, at

what price? Even though it appears
that the Stanford head coach is dead
set on maintaining this current sys
tem (it has produced a near-spotless
7-1 record), the numbers are becom
ing increasingly difficult to ignore.
