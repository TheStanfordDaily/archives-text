# Lineup questions emerging as Folkl again shines off bench

A team-high 22 points on nine
of-10 shooting in only 25 minutes
of action, .lust another day at the
office for junior forward Kristin
Folkl.
"Gee, Kristin, what was up with
that shot you missed?" Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer jok
ingly asked Folkl as they entered
the press room.
While actually a pretty valid
question — Folkl leads the Pacific

10 Conference in field goal per
centage with a 73 percent clip —
the more striking question may be
this: Why is Folkl coming off the
bench?
The numbers don't lie. After
last night's 93-51 win over Wash
ington State, the two-sport su
perathelete is averaging 17.6 points
per contest, which is a shade be
hind senior center Olympia Scott's
17.X average. Folkl also averages
nearly two rebounds better than
Scott, a team-leading V.3 per con
test — all while averaging 25 min

utes.
All along. VanDerveer's plan
has been to have Folkl as the ace up
her sleeve, providing instant of
fense and terrorizing opposing
front lines with her relentless re
bounding. Her spark off the bench
would be the dagger in opponent's
hearts — a decisive game-breaker
that does it all. And all the while,
she would push starters like Scott
and senior forward Heather Owen
to plav better.
a very difficult nlfttchup
for anyone," said Washini>ton

State head coach Harold Rhodes.
"It was a different Stanford team
when she took the floor. Maybe
there's a way to get an extended
volleyball season or maybe we
should have played Stanford in
November."
So if Folkl strikes fear in oppos
ing coaches' hearts, why not instill
that scare right from the opening
tap? Why wait until the team
seems to hit a lull, as they did last
