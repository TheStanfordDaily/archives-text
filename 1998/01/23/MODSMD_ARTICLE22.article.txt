## Top-ranked Cardinal renews Santa Clara rivalry in opening series 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
For Stanford, last year's 9-2 victo
ry over Santa Clara lifted the Cardi
nal into the NCAA West Regional
championship.
For Santa Clara it was a harsh les
son in the realities of playoff baseball
from a well-recruited (Cardinal squad.
The Broncos (41-20.23-5 WCC in
1997) went 1-4 vs. Stanford last sea
son. including the loss at the regional.
Stanford has won nine out of the last
11 games against the Broncos dating
back to the 1995 season.
And for Santa Clara it all boils
down to the same old story.
"It's the big. rich school up north
and the poor little school down
south," then Santa Clara head coach
John Oldham remarked after the '97
loss at the regionals. "Depth is a fac
tor, and obviously they have the
edge."

"Oh. yeah, all our guys drive
BMW's and come from wealthy fami
lies," retorted Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. He then smiled and
said, "No. it's a great rivalrv."

Fast forward one year and the ri
valry remains just as intense.
" They've always thought that we
kind of stole all the press and all the
notoriety." Stanford junior pitcher
Chad Hutchinson said.
The Cardinal, though, has re
ceived its fair share of fame lately. A
third-place finish at the 1997 College
World Series and a No. 1 preseason

ranking from Collegiate Baseball
haven't hurt either.
And then there's the pitching ar
senal.
"The strength of our team this
year would have to be our pitching
staff," Marquess said.
Junior righthander Jeff Austin, a
Preseason All-Amcriean who
scorched through his summer '97
Team USA stint with a 3.63 ERA,
will likely start for the Cardinal
tonight against the Broncos.
"()bviously, they're going to come
out fighting because of our ranking,"
Austin said. "And that's what we're
going to have to watch out for this
year.. .especially with the opener."
Hie Cardinal, however, is loaded
with marquee players on the offen
sive side as well.
The list includes junior center
fielder Jody Gerut (.305. 9 HR. 63
RBI), junior third baseman Josh
Hochesang (.365, 17 HR. 77 RBI)

and sophomores Edmund Ninth
(.3SS. 9HR. 46 RBI) and John Gall
(.376.5HR.5y RBI).
Also back are senior shortstop .lav
Pecci and junior second baseman
Tony Schrager. last season's surprise
Yale transfer who opened in the
starting lineup.
Santa Clara's lineup features sev
eral new faces including new head
coach Mike Cummins, who has
served as an assistant coach on the
Bronco's staff for the past 17 years.
"We have to replace some great
people," Cummins said. "We also
lost some quality pitching."
Sophomore I-hot Wheeler debuts
in right field, replacing WCC Player
of the Year Mike Frank.
Junior Kevin Okimoto returns
from injured reserve at third base.
"I think its one of the most excit
ing rivalries from our standpoint."
Okimoto said. "1 think its develop
ing into a more competitive series.'
