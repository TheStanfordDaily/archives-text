MEN S BASKETBALL
■ LAST NIGHT'S R1 SI I I Stan
ford K2. Washington State 72
■ SATURDAY: Stanford at Wash
ington. 3 p.m.

His team almost learned the les
son the hard way.
The No. 5 Cardinal (17-0.6-0 Pa
cific 10 conference) needed to hold
of two rallies bv Washington State
(K-9. 1-5) before coming out with a
lackadaisical S2-72 win at Freil
Court.
"We seemed a half-step slow in
our approach," Montgomer\ said.
"We were shooting the hall ver>
well but 1 think we lost focus on try
ing to defend. We made a nice little
run in the second half to get back up.
but then we did the only thing we
could have done to give them an op
portunity to get back in and that is
foul and stop the clock.
"It's tough on the road in this

league, and we just weren t quite as
mentally prepared as we've been."
The win tied the Stanford record
for the longest winning streak at 17.
but it nia\ have come at a heavy
price.
Junior center Tim > >ung. who
has controlled the gam Ir m the in
side during his last u> contests,
went down with 3 minutes. 53 sec
onds left in the second half after
turning his ankle on a hook shot.
I rainers have confirmed that the
ankle is sprained, and it is unknown
whether Young will be able to play
tomorrow against Washington.
This doesn't bode well for the
Cardinal, which is already missing
sophomore forward Mark Madsen
and freshman center Jason Collins
because of injuries.
Young had 13 points, four re
bounds and three assists in only IS
minutes of play. He also helped hold
Cougar center Leif Nelson to onl\
one rebound.
Hut if Young isn't able to play ef
fectively tomorrow, the Cardinal
will have to hope its reserves can
step up to stop the Huskies' 7-foot
center Todd MacCulloch. last
week's Pac-10 player of the week.
Mac("ulloch scored 49 points and
pulled down 23 rebounds over two
games as the Huskies' swept their
road trip through Oregon last week
end. He also hit K4 percent of his
shots from the floor.
If Young sits, junior backup
Mark Seaton would have to step
into the starting lineup. Mont
gomery might also have to play ju
nior small forward Peter Sauer in
the power forward spot, a position
he hasn't played all season.
Last night, the Cougars were able
to keep themselves within five
points at halftime 35-30, but the Car
dinal bounced back to take over
early in the second period.
With the score 42-37 with 1K:()1
left to play. The Cardinal broke out
for a 13-0 run to get its biggest lead
of the game at 18 points.
But the Cougars were able to bat
tle back. Still down 71-53 with 5:38
to go, forward Carlos Daniel scored
seven of his team's points during a
14-2 run in which the Cardinal had
no field goals.
"We really didn't come ready to
play." Sauer said. "Whether it had
to do with us not taking them seri
ously or being on the road or both.
We weren't mentally into the game
for all 40 minutes, which you need to
be in this conference."
The team not only lost Young
during that span, but also lost junior

Kris Weems when the guard picked
up his fourth foul with 1:50 left, then
earned a technical for arguing with
the referee afterward.
The Cougars converted three of
the four ensuing free throws to bring
themselves back to within six points,
but the ( ardinal scored four straight
points to hold off Washington State.
"This is my fourth year against
Stanford," said Daniels, who fin
ished with a game high 25 points and
16 rebounds. "They've never been a
really excited team. But they always
have this sustained intensity that
lasts over 40 minutes."
The game was by far the Cardi
nal's worst in conference play, but
they were still able to get enough to
stay undefeated. All five starters
scored in double figures to help
make up for the off night.
Sauer led the Cardinal with IS
points, and Pete Van Elswyk earned
his second double-double in his last
three games with 11 points and 10
rebounds.
"We have to give them a little
credit for being so resilient," Van
Elswyk said. "One of the marks of
being a good team is being able to
withstand it.
"I think especially in the first half
we played without any emotion.
There's just been a general malaise
these past two days. 1 hope its some
thing that's just going to come and
