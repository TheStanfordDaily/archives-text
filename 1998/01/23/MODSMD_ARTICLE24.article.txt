he a factor in Friday's match. In ad
dition. UCSD will look to score
points quickly hy way of strong
jump serves from Yarris and
Wixxis.
Although 5-21 last year, the Tri
tons were still considered a danger
ous team, with early upsets of (JSC
and Long Beach State. Stanford
coach Reuben Nieves expects
UCSD to be improved this year and
still very dangerous. UCSD will
enter Burham Pavilion with a 0-1
record and a desire to avenge two
losses to last year's national champi
on Cardinal team.
San Diego State begins their trip
north with a match against 14th
ranked Pacific Friday night. The
A/tecs are unranked. although they
did receive votes in this week's USA
Today / American Volleyball
Coaches Association poll.
SDSU will rally behind two se
niors. outside hitter Matt Hyden
and setter Dustin Cremascoli.
Myden's older brother John was a
member of the U.S. National vollev

ball team and an Atlanta Olympian.
Cremascoli is a redshirt senior who
has been a starter since his freshman
year.
SDSU is "as much a mystery
team that exists in our league, be
cause they have not played a
match." Nieves said.
The Cardinal looks to control the
ball better this weekend. When they
do execute well on passing, the Car
dinal is difficult to stop. In last Satur
day's match against Ohio State, the
CCardinal won sideouts on K<) percent
of plays that began with a perfect
pass to freshman setter Josh I .ukens.
Stanford also wants to better in
clude sophomore outside hitter
Josh Palacios into the Cardinal line
up.
"Whether (Palacios) is a starter
or not. we want him integrated,"
Nieves commented.
Following last Saturday's match,
senior middle blocker Keenan
Whitehurst expressed a similar con
cern.
"We've been playing with differ
ent lineups this week, but I don't
think that we've played with that
one," Whitehurst said. "But it
worked well."
