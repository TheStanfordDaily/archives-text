WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ TODAY: No. I Stanford w No. 5
Arizona at deGuerre Pool. 1 p.m.
SATURDAY: No I Stanford vs
No. 21 Arizona State at deGuerre
Pixil, I p.m.

Hie No 1 ranked C ardinal will
look to keep rolling this weekend
when Arizona and Arizona State
come to deGuerre p*n»l If there is
any team that is capable of putting a
sudden stop to Stanford's momen

turn, it is the Arizona Wildcats.
After a layoff from competition of
over a month the Stanford women
will return to the pool at 1 p.m. Friday
against a very talented Arizona team.
"1 here are five teams capable of
winning the national title this year,
and Arizona is one of them." Stan
ford coach Richard Quick s.iul
Die Wildcats have plenty of moti
vation. I he Wildcats will ltx>k to be
eome only the second team in W dual
meets to defeat the C ardinal. At the
same time thc\ will try to knock Stan
ford off the throne of the Pac-10. a
place the ('ardinal has become accus
tomed to.
C oach Ouick expects it to be a
\er\ close meet, but is excited at the
prospect of lacing such stilt compcti
tion. Another reason for coach Quick
to be excited is the return ot sopho
mores Catherine Fox and Jessica
Amc\ and freshman Misty I km.in to
the Stanfordsuuad I he three recent

ly returned from the World C'hampi
onships in Australia where they com
peted in several events Fhe other
Stanford swimmers are also glad to
have the threesome back.
"It's great to have Foxie. Jessica
and \listy back. Our team wouldn't
be complete without them'' said
sophomore C ourtney Lischke.
Fox. fellow sophomore Gabrielle
Rose and Flyman will be expected to
tally up the bulk of Stanford's points.
Another freshman. Siobhan Crop
per. will give the C ardinal women ad
ditional help in the sprint freestyle
events In the distance freestyle
events senior Amy Oberhelman will
lead the way. as will junior Elin
Austevoll in the breaststroke events.
Also crucial to Stanford's success will
be the 200 individual medley, which
the Cardinal have the ability to
sweep, and the relays.
The Cardinal women will then
have to rest up and return to action at

the same time again on Saturday.
ITiis time the opponent will be Ari
rona State. The No. 21 ranked Sun
De\ tls also h.i\e a talented squad, hut
are not in the ranks of the elite. Fhere
should be a number of eompetitive
races, but the meet will unlikely
match the intensity of the Anzona
meet.
"We mav be .1 little more relaxed,
but its a iiihh.l exercise in discipline to
stay focused." sophomore Jessica
Tucker \lohl said.
Provided that the Cardinal
women do maintain their focus and
turn in their average times the Sun
Devils will have an aw fully hard time
leaving the Farm with a win.
The weekend should be a refresh
ing return to competition for the
women. And Coach Quick is glad
that the meets will "give many of our
swimmers a gixn.l idea ot where they
are in their training at this point of the
season."
