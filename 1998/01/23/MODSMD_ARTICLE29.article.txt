# THE
						SECRET LIVES OF AIMEE THANATOGENOS!
## 'My life as David Cassidy!â€™ 
### 
Last time we checked in on Aimee
Thanatogenos, she'd given up her
career as a professional tester of diar
rhea products and was devoting herself
to plastering mud on the faces of ugly
starving children in Cambodia. Aimee
Thanatogenos, that world-renowned
icon for rebelliousness, ditziness, and
bad armpit odor, is retiring to pursue a
personal life. The words "personal"
and "life" generally gives Aimee rash
es, and together they make her want to
vomit, but when all is said and done,
Aimee's been in this dump for three
and a half years and there's still no life
below the belt area.
Aimee is following the lead of her
good friend Anastasia Unwich, who
after spending six years amusing her
self by talking to sock puppets, found
the man of her dreams in an insurance
salesman who'd been spying on her
through a telescope for two weeks.
Now they're together and Anastasia
seems happier than ever, well except
for those times when her legs get stuck

in between elevator doors, hut that's
another story.
Unlike most women, Aimee is not
looking for a man who is caring, sensi
tive, and intelligent, since most men
who meet that description are gay and
Aimee has had enough of dates more
interested in the salad and entree than
her cleavage. Aimee wants a man who
will not shout out his mother's name
while having sex. A man who would
give her at least as much attention as
he gives to his portfolio. A man who
will understand her need to have time
alone and strip in front of strangers. A
man who will tip her generously after
sex. And it's around this time that
Aimee realizes that no man in this
world would ever fit these require
ments and that Aimee should accept
the fact that her life is a one-passenger
train ride. And that's okay, because
Aimee would rather indulge in all the
fun and merriment of life by herself
than have to split it in two. Or some
thing like that.
