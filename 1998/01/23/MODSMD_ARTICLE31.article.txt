To the Section Editors:
It's a new era at The Daily and it's time to reflect that. Some
changes are coming your way, such as no more suggestive shots of
men's wrestling matches as they grapple one another and no more
headlines with the words "Faculty Senate" in them. Some changes
I'd like to implement at once:
1) We will no longer report on the ASSU unless a matter of
extreme urgency or interest needs to be brought to be public. For
instance, if Emily Andrus gets stabbed on the leg with a knife, or
if Ben Decker is caught having sex with a Farm animal. We will
uuote them in full only if they happen to say the word "fuck" or
the words "bite me."
2) World & Nation will be replaced by a section called CoHo and
Polio's, and will include gossip overheard at either of these eater
ies. Current World & Nation editors will be replaced by a giant
hen who will crow incessantly during staff meetings and eventual
ly break down and cry on the Editor in Chief's shoulder.
3) Diversions will be edited by a sour Tibetan monk who has
been mute, deaf and blind for the past 20 years. He will draw the
humor mostly out of his past experience.
4) The Managing Editors will be required to do something enter
taining every two hours in order to amuse me, i.e. putting their
pants on fire while wearing them, or writing pornographic notes
on my office window. If their pants accidentally catch on fire
without them meaning to, it will not count.
5) The title Editor in Chief is henceforth replaced by "Goddess of
the Universe and Keeper of Mankind," Gt'KM, to ne short.
6) All editors will abide by these changes, and if they complain,
they will be replaced by hand puppets.
Sincerely,
