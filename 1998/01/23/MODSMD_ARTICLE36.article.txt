ules in the country, the Stanford

ample opportunities this season to
test themselves against the best.
Their next challenge comes
today when the 16th ranked Cardi
nal meets the third-ranked Arizona
State Sun Devils at 7:30 in Tempe.

■ TONIGHT: No. 16 Stanford at
No. 3 Arizona State, 7:30 p.m.

Arizona State unexpectedly fin
ished second at the national cham
pionship meet last year. They re
turn all but one member of last
year's squad, including four All-
Americans. The Sun Devils are led
bv senior Megan Wright, who was
an Ail-American in the all-around
last year, and by sophomore Eliza
beth Reed, who made a fine show
ing at last year's nationals on the
bars and beam and in the floor ex
ercise.
Last weekend the Sun Devils
lost to the top-ranked UCLA Bru

ins. scoring similarly to what the
Cardinal scored in its first match
against Washington, but Arizona
State was coming off a road trip
from Hawaii that may have affected
its score.
"I think we'll see a different
ASIJ," said Cardinal head coach
Mark Cook. "They may have been
fatigued from their road trip."
As for the Cardinal, the squad
will ignore the Sun Devils and try to
pull an upset.
"If we upset them it will make a
real statement." said Cook. "But if
we lose I don't want it to be because
we gave them the opportunity, but
because they are the better team."
The Cardinal will make minor
adjustments after last week's meet
and will especially look to improve
their floor routines. Last week
against Washington, Cook thought
the team made t(H> many errors in
their tumbling that affected its start
values.
Cook was happy with the team's
performance on bars and vault and
doesn't think the squad can per
form much better on those two
events at this point in the season.
Beam is also an area the team is

concentrating on. Cook expects the
team to be more "focused" against
Arizona State and to hit their floor
connections.
"We're excited to have one meet
under out belt but the first road trip
is always a challenge," said senior
co-captain Keri Monahan. Mona
han will compete in all events for
the Cardinal.
Monahan also thought the team
held back last week in their loss to
Washington. 190.700 to 191.525.
"We're going to try and be more
aggressive" Monahan said. "With
each skill there's no holding hack
and we have to know from the get
go that we're going to get it."
The Cardinal is still not in full
force because of injuries and Cook
is anxiously awaiting the return of
"star recruit" freshman Jennifer
Exaltacion from a stress fracture
and junior Katie Fitzpatrick, who
competed in nationals last year. Ex
altacion is expected back in two
weeks and Fitzpatrick, who has
made a fast recovery from ankle
surgery, will be back in three. For
mer second team All-Ameriean
Larissa Fontaine is close to coming
back after breaking a thumb.
