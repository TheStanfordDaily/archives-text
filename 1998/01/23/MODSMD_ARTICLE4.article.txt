# Science quad to open
## First buildings may be in action spring 
### Evan Nordby 
After a six-month dela\. the first phase of the Science
and Engineering Ouad is nearing completion The new
statistics building and the I caching ( enter ma\ he avail
able for classes at the beginning of spring quarter.
These two buildings are the first fruits of the Universi
ty's $12()-million investment in the science quad project
McC'ullough Annex and the new electrical engineering
building remain under construction.
"We're hoping to occupy the statistics building neai
the end of Februansaid Olivier Pieron. co-prograir
manager for the science quad project. "Our goal for the
teaching center is the end ol March."
"We cannot promise the\ will be able to be used foi
spring quarter." said Pieron. "We have to make sure an\
defects have been corrected."
Pieron estimates the electrical engineering building t<
be 30 percent complete Ihe department hopes to move
into the building in December, he said.
The science quad project consists of the four building?
mentioned above surrounding an area of grass, trees anei
crushed granite pavement I'he buildings will be connect
ed by walkways and freestanding arcades
The focal point of the science quad is the Teaching
Center. Formerly known in the project as the Regional
Teaching Facility. two large auditoriums in the Teaching
Center replace those in the now-demolished Physic*
lank
These auditoriums are the state of the art. according ti
Pieron.
In addition to lull multimedia and
Stanford Instructional Television
Network capability, the 480- and 2(X)-
seat facilities feature rotating stages.
"One lecture and demonstration
can he going on while another is
being prepared behind," Pieron said.
The new statistics building at
Serra Mall and Lomita Mall anchors
the corner of the project.
The building carries on the name
of the old statistics building in the ap
proximately the same location. Se
quoia Hall.
Most of the building is offices and
conference rooms for the depart
ment, although a computer lab and
49-seat classroom are located on the
second floor.
All of the science quad buildings
share common architectural fea
tures. The requisite red tile roofs cap
gray French limestone exterior walls.
At ground level, a band of rough-cut
granite circles the buildings.
"This architecture is an interpre
tation of the [Main] Quad, not a
copy," Pieron explained..
"The new quad recreates [archi
tect Frederick Law] Olmsted's origi
nal design" for Stanford, said Pieron.
"It's a wonderful addition."
