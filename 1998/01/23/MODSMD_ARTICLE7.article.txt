# Ship-board classes offer adventure
## 
### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
The navy blue waves licked the sides of the
ship. There was a wake of foam trailing a mile
behind the floating university.
As incredible as it may sound, students have
been traveling around the world, taking classes,
writing research papers and pla\ing sports, all
on a ship, for quite a lew years.
I he name of this program is Semester .it
Sea It is a global education program sponsored
by the I 'niversitv of Pittsburgh During the fall
quarter, ten Stanford students embarked on
this vovage from Sept. 14 to Dec. 23. only to re
turn to their dormitories this quarter.
"Somehow going on a dorm trip to Tahoe
isn't as exciting as visiting the l aj Mahal or the
Egyptian pyramids." said Brad Rodrigues, a so
ciologvcoterminal student w ho went on the trip

two y ears ago.
Students from .ill around the nation went to
Japan. China. Hong Kong. Vietnam. India.
Egypt. ( vprus. C Jreeee. Spain and Morocco this
fall I hey spent five days at each port, with the
opportunity to meet the locals and experience
their cultures, which was"the most rewarding
of all." according to Mehul Bastawala. a gradu
ate student who went on the trip this fall
"The little survival sheet we got from the
ship and our experience in playing charades
helped us through the language barrier."
Bastawala said.
Autumn Cooper, a human biology major
who went this fall, gave a few tips that they
learned during one of their visits "Don't doa
five linger hand wave in Greece. It's [obscene).
Always say Hello, how are you?' in Morocco
before asking a stranger where the bank is or
how much something costs It's considered re-

allv rude [not to greet them] and they
may not help you."
Rodrigues also encountered cul
tural barriers of his own. "I paid $2 to
ride a stubborn camel named "Mick
ey Mouse' around the pyramids in
Egypt. The guide forgot' to tell me
that I had to pay another $20 for him
to let me get off." Rodrigues said.
Nevertheless, "people are much
nicer to foreigners, for the most part,
in other countries than people usual
ly are in the States," Cooper said.
"It's great to be treated kindly but it's
also sad that the country I call home
pales in comparison."
The Semester at Sea program is
treated as an exchange semester at
the University of Pittsburgh. "Stan
ford students may only go in the fall
since it means taking one quarter off,
compared to the spring voyage [from
Feb. 10 to May 20] for which you
would have to take two quarters'
leave of absence," Bastawala said.

"The course load may be less
compared to [Stanford], but the na
ture of the voyage can make it quite
hectic.
"We would leave Egypt and reach
Cyprus the next morning, and I
would see students churning out pa
pers in the computer lab that same
night." Bastawala added.
"Stanford accepted all of the cred
its from the program. Because it's a
semester-long program, you get 1.5
credits for every credit you take. 1
was able to complete a I) Rand apply
a class toward my major," Rodrigues
said
The faculty members on board
are usually on sabbatical from their
home institutions. In addition to
these, there are interport lecturers,
professors or representatives of gov
ernment or business, who join the
ship at an earlier port to sail with the
community to the next port.
The lecturers present seminars
about their countries and participate
in discussions about their nations'
histories, cultures and customs and
prepare the students for a more ef

fective field experience, according to
the center's World Wide Weh site.
Financial aid is available for the
program. "There are three kinds of
financial aid, 50 percent, 40 percent
and 20 percent off the basic cost of
$12,500. Work study is only applica
ble to the 50 percent position. If you
have financial aid on your home cam
pus. you have more of a chance of re
ceiving financial aid," Bastawala
said. Students can also transfer feder
al aid to the program if necessary, ac
cording to the Financial Aid Office.
"Although the cost is definitely
high with the added cost of indepen
dent travel and shopping. I and the
others I talked to agree that the voy
age is well worth the money and
time." Bastawala said. "When else
can you go on a ship cruising the
world for three and a half months, get
academic credit, and have a neat ex
perience of all these different cul
tures?"
