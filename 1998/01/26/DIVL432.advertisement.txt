Burn Debris Disaster Free
Smokey is counting on you to follow the rules for
safely burning debris.
1. Check local laws on burning.
2. Don't burn on dry windy days.
3. Clear a 30-foot circle around debris before
lighting fire.
4. Keep shovel, rake and water nearby.
5. Don't leave fire unattended by an adult, even
for a minute.
6. Consider alternatives to burning: composting,
recycling, or hauling to a landfill.
REMEMBER, ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES.
