Part Time
Lab Work
Looking for EE students to help in part-time lab
work. Tasks involve measuring components
from our new IC process and curve-fitting
models using Pspice. We also need help in
characterizing new analog IC's as they arrive
over the months. Excellent lab and modeling
experience, and summer jobs will be available.
We will accommodate your schedule as we can
during the school year.
