## Lewinsky looks for immunity 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Anxious to
cut a deal for immunity, the lawyer for
Monica Lewinsky said yesterday his 24-
year-old client "will tell all that she knows"
to Whitewater prosecutors. "The chips will
fall as they may," he said.
Attorney William Ginsburg said he has
verbally indicated to investigators what
Ms. Lewinsky will tell them in exchange
for immunity from prosecution.
"I will remain in Washington as long as
it takes to see that the truth in every detail,
wherever it may fall, comes out." Gins
hurg said. Negotiations of such a sensitive
nature could take weeks.
President Clinton talked this weekend
with heavyweight advisers to help him
through the crisis brought on by the allega
tions of a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and attempts at a cover-up. ()ne
of them, one-time Commerce Secretary
Mickey Kantor. said his help was lawyerly
in nature. "1 have my legal hat on. not my
political hat," he said.
In the first hint of an eye witness. ABC'
reported that the president and Ms.

Lewinsky were caught in an intimate
encounter in a private area of the White
I louse in the spring of 1996, shortly before
the White House intern was moved to a
job at the Pentagon. ABC cited several
unidentified sources for its information.
The office of prosecutor Kenneth Starr
declined comment on the ABC report. If
true, such a witness would provide impor
tant corroborating evidence for Ms.
Lewinsky's account if she reverses her cur
rent denial of an affair with the president.
In secretly-recorded conversations, Ms.
Lewinsky had said she believed "nobody
saw anything happen between us."
Ginsburg said the ABC report, if true,
will take some of the pressure off his client
by making her testimony less important.
Such a development would let Starr
expend his "bullets on somebody else,"
said Ginsburg.
At the White House, the first couple
tried to maintain an air of normalcy,
attending services at Foundry United
Methodist Church as usual. Clinton
rehearsed his State of the Union speech

and planned to watch the Super Bowl with
family and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Senior administration officials and
longtime Clinton friends, including two
who talked to him this weekend, said the
president was shocked and depressed in
the first hours of the controversy hut has
bounced back defiant.
"One thing isn't going on and that's dis
cussions about any resignation," said Rahm
Emanuel, a top White House adviser.
House Judiciary Committee chairman
Henry Hyde spoke cautiously about the
possibility of an impeachment inquiry.
"Nothing much will happen until the
Democrats decide something should hap
pen." said Hyde. R-111.
In a whirlwind of appearances on ABC,
NBC and CBS. <iinshurg weitf out 01 his
way to praise Starr and his staff, calling
them "excellent people" with whom talks
have been cordial.
"I don't approve of some of their tac
tics." but "1 have nothing hut the highest
praise for their professionalism and their
attitude." Ginsburg said.
