# Scandal will not affect decisions on Iraqi standoff, officials say
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — White
House and congressional officials insisted
yesterday that the sex scandal engulfing
President Clinton won't hamper U.S. deci
sions on the weapons standoff with Iraq
including whether to mount a military
attack.
"I don't think anyone overseas should
presume that this president wouldn't have
the capacity to act with Republican sup
port," Sen. John Ashcroft. R Mo., a mem
ber of the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, said on "Fox News Sunday."
At Clinton's direction, national security
advisers were consulting with allies and
other nations on the prospect of a military
strike to take out sites where Saddam Hus

sein is suspected of hiding potential bio
logical and chemical weapons.
After a Saturday meeting. Clinton's
key aides reached consensus that IJ.N.
weapons inspections cannot be carried out
effectively because of Iraq's defiant resis
tance and were considering using force to
end the standoff.
National security spokesman Eric
Rubin would not reveal whether the
White House would try a last round of
diplomacy before ordering a military
strike. 'All options remain on the table,"
Rubin said yesterday. "We have not ruled
anything out."
A White House official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Clinton

advisers were "drifting toward use of
force" but that action is not imminent. A
final decision was deferred until after con
sultations with allies arc completed in
about a week, the official said.
Last week. Iraqi newspapers printed a
statement from President Saddam Hus
sein's Cabinet suggesting Clinton ma\
bomb the country to divert attention from
allegations involving Monica Lewinsky. 24
A White 1 louse official brushed oil
such suggestions, saying Clinton s advisers
were weighing political and military rami
fications of the weapons standoff weeks
before the Lewinsky scandal erupted.
"This is being handled as the national
security issue it is." the official said.
