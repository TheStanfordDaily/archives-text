## Elway grabs first win in four tries 
### 
SAN DIE(i() (AP) The old dude final
ly did it.
John Elway and the Denver Broneos won
a Super Bowl for themselves and the AFC by
beating the Cireen Bay Packers 31 -24 yester
day in one of the most exciting games ever.
It gave the 37-year-old Hlway his first win
in four tries and the AFC its first in 14.
Sure, he had help.
He got it from MYT Terrell Davis, who
gained 157 yards in 30 carries and scored on
three 1-yard runs, including the winner with
1:45 left in the game. He did it despite a
migraine that caused him to miss most of the
second quarter.
For Elway. carried off the field by his
teammates, this was vindication in perhaps his
last shot at a title. He rode off as the oldest
quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl.
"For all the Broncos fans who never had
this feeling, we finally got it done." Elwav said.
"You wonder if you're going to win or if
you're going to run out of years."
The victory kept Denver from becoming
the first team ever to lose five — it lost one in
1978. before Elway arrived.
The win meant vindication for the AFC.
which hadn't won since the Raiders, then in
Los Angeles, beat Washington 38-9 in 1984.
Elway's first season.
And finally, it was the first win for the
quarterback class of 1983 that ineluded
Elway. Jim Kelly and Dan Marino.
The final chance for the defending cham
pion Packers ended when John Moblev
knocked down Brett Favre's pass from the
Denver 31 with 28 seconds left. That made
the two-touchdown underdog Broncos the
second wild-card team to win the Super Bowl.

"They disrespected us all week," Denver
tight end Shannon Sharpe said. "Everybody
disrespected us. They never faced a running
game like ours They never faced a quarter
hack like ours. They never faced a coach who
puts in a game plan like Mike Shanahan."
rhe Packers hurt themselves with three
critical penalties late in the game. They
included a holding call and a false start on
rookie left tackle Ross Verba that bottled
Green Bay deep, and a face mask on Darius
Holland that gave the Broncos 15 key yards
on their game-winning -W-yard drive.
But nonetheless, it was Elwav's game.
"In kind of a strange way — John Elway.
I've always enjoyed him." Packers coach
Mike Holmgren said. "I just wished he hadn't
done it against me."
Elway scrambled K yards to set up a touch
down. and scored on a 1-yard run — a lot like
the young Elway. He finished 12-of-22 for 122
yards and threw one end-zone interception.
If this wasn't the best Super Bowl ever, it
was close to it. despite a lot of sloppiness — 15
penalties and five turnovers by the two teams.
Elwav's mistake came at the Green Bay 22
when the Broncos had a chance to go ahead
by more than a touchdown late in the third
quarter.
But otherwise, it was two heavyweights
going punch for punch — Favre threw for
three TDs. two to Antonio Freeman, and
Davis ran for three.
Each team scored a touchdown on its first
possession, the first time that's ever happened
in a Super Bowl.
Denver joined the Oakland Raiders, who
won the 1981 Super Bowl, as the only uild
cards to win the title.
