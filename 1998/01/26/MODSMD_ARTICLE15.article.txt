# Amid scandal worries and other troubles
## Clinton preparing for State of the Union 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — I'nder a heavy
cloud of suspicion. President Clinton goes
before the nation tomorrow with a State of
the Union address offering the first balanced
budget in 30 years along with big spending
increases for schools, child care, medical
research and the environment.
After years of austeriK imposed by trou
hling deficits. Clinton will present a decided
ly activist agenda for this midterm election
year.
He wants to expand the Peace Corps, give
consumers a "bill of rights" in health-care
plans, protect children from smoking and
make big investments in AIDS treatment,
food safety and medical research. He also
wants to open Medicare to younger retirees,
encourage small businesses to establish pen
sion plans, and fix the Social SecuntN system
and Medicare before the baby btnmi genera
tion starts collecting benefits.
Emboldened by Clinton's legal and politi
cal troubles. Republicans will counter with
their own plans for improving education, cut
ting taxes, overhauling the IKS and expand
ing the war against drugs.
The big question, though, is how much of
Clinton's message will penetrate the fog of
uncertainty about his presidency after allega
tions he had an affair with a young intern and
urged her to lie about it.
"He's uoing to have :i heck of a hard time

making himself heard on the State of the
I nion." said Colgate I niversity political sci
entist Michael Johnston. "People are emi
nently distracted."
The reception awaiting Clinton from the
Republican majority — as well as from his fel
low Democrats — i>> uncertain. " W hat, are
they going to stand up and cheer when he
walks in?" asked presidential historian Henr\
Ciraff from Columbia I niversity.
Speaking Sunday on CNN's "Late Edi
tion," Rep. Henry Hyde. R-111., chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, who has
counseled caution in considering congression
al action against the president, predicted
"civil, polite, restrained applause."
Stunned by news leaks and accusations.
White House officials are anxious about what
the atmosphere will be. Before the controver
sy. the administration expected up to N> mil
lion viewers Officials now anticipate even
more as Americans watch how Clinton will
deal with the most serious allegations of his
presidency.
"This could be one of the biggest audi
ences ever for a State of the Union." a senior
White House official said ruefully .
White House aides say it is ridiculous to
speak of a delay or of scrapping the speech
because of the scandal cloud. They also say
the president will not address the charges
prior to tomorrow night 's speech.
