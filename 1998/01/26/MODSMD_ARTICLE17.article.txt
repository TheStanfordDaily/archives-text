down.
This not only creates milling crowds and
Concentrated plates,
it also prevents students from taking care of
necessary errands during the bfbak.
Department offices should adjust to allow
access during the lunch hour.
Students often have no time between
classes to take care of errands that they need

Furthermore, closing office doors and
herding both students and faculty to lunch
all during the same hour creates unneces
sary congestion in those few locations
where they are welcome.

hour is a necessary break for office staff
during the day. we also feel it is the time
when University offices are most needed.
An effort should be made to accommodate
the schedules of students as well as staff
members.
