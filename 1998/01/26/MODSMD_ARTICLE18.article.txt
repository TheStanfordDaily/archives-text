## Dissecting the cheating heart 
### 
SO THE LEADER of
the free world can't
keep it in his pants.
There are other things
I'd prefer to read about
over breakfast, but noth
ing sells newspapers like
famous people's sex lives.

This particular story is veiled under the
pretense of the important political implica
tions of coercing someone to lie under oath,
but the majority of Americans just want the
sleaze. "Ooooh. He slept around. That's
baaaaaad."
We do it to all of our celebrities: Woody
Allen, Kevin Costner and Hugh Grant to
name a few. Their sexual practices are com
pletely irrelevant to their professional lives,
but still we greedily gobble up stories of
their antics and are quick to point the finger
of judgment.
Yet adulterers are not a rare minority of
deviants. While survey results are highly
varied due to the delicate nature of the
topic, somewhere between 50 to SO percent
of married men and 30 to 50 percent of mar
ried women have had affairs.
In light of these numbers, our standards
of monogamy seem like out-dated relics of
our Puritan past. It's ridiculous to crucify
people for doing something that half of us
do. It's like setting the speed limit at 55
while most of us are cruising at 70.
Perhaps our social expectations are out
of synch with our animal instincts. Maybe
hormones dictate propagation of our genes

by having multiple sex partners. It's possible
that in our natural state humans live and
love communally. It could be that we're just
hard-wired to run around.
When I took Prof. Sapolsky's "Human
Behavioral Biology" we learned that socio
biologists divide primates into two cate
gories: pairbonding and tournament
species. In pairbonding species, the male
and female have identical physical features
(a.k.a. low sexual dimorphism) and they
mate for life (think of them as the good old
fashioned faithful couples). In tournament
species, the males are much bigger and
stronger than the females (a.k.a. high sexu
al dimorphism), and they live in either a
harem structure (in which the males have a
high turnover rate) or else they live in a
tribe with a male dominance hierarchy in
which the higher ranking males have mating
privileges (think of them as bad boys — no
concept of fidelity).
Where do humans fit in? We're neither
pairbonding or tournament. Or you could
say we're a hybrid of both. We have moder
ate sexual dimorphism — men are slightly
larger than women, but not enough to qual
ify us as tournament. And there is a high
variability in our behavior patterns — some
have harems, some have single mates, some
pretend to have single mates with secret
harems on the side.
Because biology fails to offer clear cut
answers, it is up to us to invent them. Reli
gious dogma aside, there doesn't seem to be
anything inherently evil about having sex

with multiple, consenting (and condom
wearing) adults.
1 personally don't find that option partic
ularly compelling. I just can't handle a lull
load of classes and more than one intimate
relationship. Additionally, there's something
about sleeping around that doesn't seem to
cultivate happiness for all those involved.
1 remember when my first boyfriend in
high school "cheated" on me. ()l course,
those were the days of fast-food dates and
back-seat kisses, when holding hands with
another girl during lunch time constituted
an affair. Hut I was still devastated.
I don't envy our First Lady.
Therein lies the real crime of infidelity:
somebody is usually hurt by it. And it's not
the person getting the extra kicks.
Certainly it doesn't help that we plaster
the scandal on the cover of every newspa
per. I'm sure Jackie C) was thankful for the
discretion the media then used about JFK's
extra-marital activity.
After all. people cheat, people speed,
people inhale. Families can cope or disinte
grate as they see fit. The rest of the world
needn't butt in.
Because I'm not without sin. I'm not
going to go around throwing rocks at any
one.

Kerry Rodgers, a senior majoring in philos
ophy and form of visual art, thinks that
Robert Sapolsky is the second coming. If
you haven't read his hooks or taken his
class, you haven't really lived.
