# Final shot keeps hoops streak alive
## Men move to 18-0 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
SEATTLE — For five of the
longest seconds all season, the Stan
ford men's basketball team found it
self on the verge of its first loss.
Down 72-71 in Washington, the
Cardinal had the ball at the opposite
end of the court and no Brevin
Knight to turn to.
But the team definitively closed
the door on the Knight era as junior
guard Kris Weems drove the length
of the court to sink the game-win
ning three-pointer as time expired,
keeping the undefeated season alive
for the No. 5 Cardinal (18-0,7-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference).
"I don't know where my man
was." Weems said. "I don't know if
he was behind me or if he got
screened or anything. I had a clear
lane, a window, and that gave me a
chance to make the shot."
Weems' defender. Deon Luton,
was a victim of a football-like block

from power forward Pete Van El
swyk.
Musky guard Donald Watts hit a
6-foot hank shot from the left base
line over junior center Tim Young
to give his team the lead with 5.1
ticks left in the game. Washington
head coach Bob Bender called for a
timeout to regroup his team and
make sure they realized that they
still had two fouls to give.
But when Weems got the in
bounds pass from junior forward
Peter Sauer, he found himself dri
ving down the left sideline un
touched thanks to Van Elswyk, who
plowed down Luton and Patrick Fe
merling.
Weems dribbled past the time
line and cut into the middle of the
court, spotting up at the top of the
arc for the buzzer-beating shot.
"The out of bounds play allowed
us to spread the court a little bit and
did not allow them to know who was
going to get the ball," said Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery. "I
believe that they thought [junior
point guard Arthur Lee] was going
to get the hall. Kris broke the other
way and was able to take it the
length. It was a pretty good basket
ball game all the way around."

MEN'S BASKETBALL

■SATURDAYS RESULT
Stanford 74, Washington 72

Only Husky guard Jan Wooten
had a shot at Weems, and the Car
dinal guard was able to breeze past
him just beyond midcourt. The
Huskies (12-4, 5-2) dropped into a
third-place Pac-10 tie with UCLA.
"At the end of the game we were
trying to get the foul ... but we
couldn't get it." Bender said. "We
had a little confusion off the screen
and consequently didn't really
even have anybody on Weems as
he brought the ball up the court.
"He got the ball, with great
awareness on his part, and he got it
right down the floor quickly and
raised up and hit a shot."
But Weems alone can't be given
all the credit.
Young, who sprained his ankle
Thursday against Washington
State, wasn't expected to see much
time against the Huskies. But he
surprised everyone by shutting
down 7-footer Todd MacCulloeh,
who many consider the confer
ence's most dominating big man.
Young finished with 14 points
and 12 rebounds on 7-of-10 shoot
ing while holding MacCulloch to
five points and three rebounds.
Young also recorded three blocks,
giving him 122 in his career and

moving him past Howard Wright
for the top spot on Stanford's all
time list, but as usual. Young was
low-key.
"1 don't think Stanford's known
for its shot-blocking," Young
joked. "I mean, it's cool to be in the
record books."
Stopping MacCulloch was big
because he is "a really good player

and he's capable of putting up real
ly good numbers" Young said. "He
got in a little foul trouble so he
couldn't do a whole lot. Hut he'll
play hard when it comes down to it.
Van Elswyk once again came
through in place of injured sopho
more Mark Madsen. Van Elswyk

finished with 10 first-half points
and eight rebounds, and he was also
able to shut down 7-1 Patrick Fe
nierling in the process.
With their big men ineffective,
Washington was forced to depend
upon Watts and its backcourt,
which delivered. The team forced
16 Cardinal turnovers and the
guards were able to get eight of the
team's 11 steals.
But in the end it was the all
around play of the Cardinal that de

cided the game. Lee finished with a
team-high 17 points, but also dis
tributed the ball impressively en
route to 10 assists. For the second
game in a row, all five Cardinal
starters scored in double-digits.
The win extends the nation's
longest winning streak to 18, which
is also a Stanford record. It also
keeps Stanford in a first-place tie
with Arizona atop the Pac-10. set
ting the stage for this Thursday's
showdown between the two teams

at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal opened the second
half with a nine-point run behind
Sauer's five points for a 12-point
advantage.
Hut the Huskies fought back be
hind 11 second-half points by
Watts. They got their first lead of
the game when Watts hit an NBA
length three to put them up by one
with 5:39 left.
After the Cardinal retook the
lead. Thalo Green hit a layup with

1::22 to go for another one-point
Husky lead. Weems found junior
center Mark Seaton for a layup and
another lead change.
Watts then hit a turnaround
jumper over sophomore guard
David Moseley to once again put
Washington up. Lee drove in for a
wild layup to put the Cardinal hack
up with 10 seconds to go. Watts
then hit his shot, and Weems
worked his magic to keep the
record books open for the Cardi

nal.
"It's a great win for us obviously,
because Washington made some
great plays at the end of the game
that put them in a position to win,"
Montgomery said. "Washington is
a good basketball team. They are
an NCAA team, and we got a little
fortunate at the end. We made a
big bucket at the end which we
probably should not have had be
cause they had a foul to give, but
we did."
