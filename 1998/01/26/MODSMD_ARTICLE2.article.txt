# Final shot keeps hoops streak alive
## Men move to 18-0

SEATTLE â€” For five of the
longest seconds all season, the Stan
ford men's basketball team found it
self on the verge of its first loss.
Down 72-71 in Washington, the
Cardinal had the ball at the opposite
end of the court and no Brevin
Knight to turn to.
But the team definitively closed
the door on the Knight era as junior
guard Kris Weems drove the length
of the court to sink the game-win
ning three-pointer as time expired,
keeping the undefeated season alive
for the No. 5 Cardinal (18-0,7-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference).
"I don't know where my man
was." Weems said. "I don't know if
he was behind me or if he got
screened or anything. I had a clear
lane, a window, and that gave me a
chance to make the shot."
Weems' defender. Deon Luton,
was a victim of a football-like block

from power forward Pete Van El
swyk.
Musky guard Donald Watts hit a
6-foot hank shot from the left base
line over junior center Tim Young
to give his team the lead with 5.1
ticks left in the game. Washington
head coach Bob Bender called for a
timeout to regroup his team and
make sure they realized that they
still had two fouls to give.
But when Weems got the in
bounds pass from junior forward
Peter Sauer, he found himself dri
ving down the left sideline un
touched thanks to Van Elswyk, who
plowed down Luton and Patrick Fe
merling.
Weems dribbled past the time
line and cut into the middle of the
court, spotting up at the top of the
arc for the buzzer-beating shot.
"The out of bounds play allowed
us to spread the court a little bit and
did not allow them to know who was
going to get the ball," said Cardinal
