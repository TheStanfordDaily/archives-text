Evans 9 column displays
his arrogance
I! the arrogant Darron Evans' theory
that the president may just read The Daily
were correct, I would hang my head in
shame. I found his article, "Mr. President. I
want your job." utterly moronic and offen
sive. I was ashamed that this "not too shab
by paper" could even publish such trash.
The article calls on the president to stop
using poll results to determine his policy
and to show some real leadership. If Evans
wants to go and live in some communist dic
tatorship where the leader takes it upon
himself to dictate policy, that's fine by me.
But here in America, the president's job is
to serve the people. How can he criticize the
president for listening to, and aiming to
please, the voice of the people?
Moreover, the two proposals Evans
gives the president, besides not being prag
matic. have nothing to do with the presi
dent. II Evans wants an athlete boycott, let
him address his article to all athletes. If
Evans wants Stanford to force its students
to serve communities more, shout at the
University. Hut when has it become the job
of the president to dictate to professional
athletes and private universities how to con
duct their affairs? The link between vour

proposals and the way the president should
exert his authority is just dismal.
Besides from faulty logic, Evans has not
yet mastered the simple rules of grammar —
split infinitive in line 57: "to actually earn."
Darron Evans, "let me just get straight to
the point: I want your job." You are an
arrogant fool, who doesn't know how to
think, let alone write.

Innocent babies should
not be seen as enslavers
There are those of us on this campus
who. without fail, fall into a game of seman
tics when it comes to discussions of abor
tion. Let me say first, that because a person
sees an inherent wrong in terminating the
life of an unborn human — and by this I
mean, embryo, fetus, child, cluster of cells,
"potential" human being and so forth — it
does not mean that he or she advocates the
"enslavement" of women. Nor does it mean
they are engaging in apparently forbidden
"emotional arguments." Needless to say,
referring to women as "slaves to their man'
and slaves to their physiology" is as close to
an over-emotionalized ploy as I've ever
read.

To assume that those of us who were
lucky enough to make it out the womb —
with our selfish, wasteful, self-absorbed ten
dencies — are in any position to make life
and death decisions for those of us who are
not yet born and cannot do anything but
grow and change in the miraculous way that
we do, is ridiculous. Babies do not enslave
women. Pregnancy does not enslave
women. I consider it an affront to woman
hood to dare say that a woman's ability to
play the most important role in bringing
new life to this world is a burden. Having
this ability, and recognizing its importance,
is not a call to make all women "pregnant
and barefoot." If a woman doesn't want a
child, she doesn't have to have sex or she
can use birth control. Remember birth con
trol? Oh. yes, that's the stuff you take to
prevent conception to begin with.
The connection between mother and
child is unlike any other. It is physical and
emotional. If you don't believe me, ask your
mother what it was like for her. Finding this
biological, emotional and psychological
connection can and does have irreversible
consequences.
A baby is not an invader. Pregnancy
doesn't take away a woman's right to her
own body. It dwells inside of her for nine
months, as she sustains its life through her
own. A beautiful thing. An addition, not a
detraction. Babies do not grow in our

wombs because some man, or some govern
ment put it there and is forcing us to have it.
Our babies are a part of us from the day we
were born. Those eggs that will grow into
people are a part (if us. And when they die,
a part of us dies.
We all know what an embryo is; it is
what we all once were. We know that we all
began when a sperm joined an egg. We can
play with words all we want, but it is a truth
that we all know and finally understand for
the first time when we met our little broth
ers and sisters the day they were born, or on
that day when we look into tiny eyes that
are like our own.
These are innocent babies, not enslavers
and not burdens. Having a baby is not
always convenient, and is rarely, if ever,
easy. It's a life-long commitment to a whole
other person. And we know that, and we
fear it. But this should not drive us to mur
der. It should not make us so callous and
political that we believe people who say
they care about women but would encour
age them to kill their own children. If it's
not murder, why are millions of embryos,
fetuses, potential humans and babies dead?
Maybe we should take out this aggres
sion on the men out there who force women
to feel as if abortion is their only practical
alternative because they will leave or not
support the child? Maybe we should be
angry that society does not support women

who cannot afford to he single mothers.
Maybe we should be angry that women can
not bring their children to work and school
with them? Just maybe we should work on
building a society that can sustain life
instead of one that sees no alternative but to
destroy it.

Apathy prevails regarding
abortion rights
To be honest, I didn't read Garry
Grundy's column last week very carefully. I
didn't think I needed to waste my time. I
got the gist, got irritated, decided he'd writ
ten it merely as provocation (proof: any
Stanford student knows there are women
on the Supreme Court, right?) and sat back.
This is too easy a target. I thought. I'll wait
for all the other irritated folks on campus to
write in and just sympathize with them.
Almost a week later, I'm writing, to note
the absence of angry letters. How many
were there? Five, including this one, not
counting one letter supporting Grundy.
Seven voices, in total.
Whv so few? Because Grundv's column
was too puerile and too melodramatic to
deserve your response? My fear is that
instead, it's the logic of apathy at work.
Grundy's not making policy, you might
think. Stanford students still have relatively
easy access to abortion. So why bother writ
ing in to attack him. when neither his col
umn nor my letter will change anything, and
as things stand I can get an abortion if I
need one?
That logic has loopholes. Grundy has one
thing most people at Stanford don't have: a
prominent soapbox, in the form of a> Daily
column, from which to air his views. Views
that most Stanford students don't share, if
the statistics are any guide. The New York
Times reported this last week that 60 per
cent of Americans don't think abortion
should be the target of government action.
Seventy-six percent oppose a constitutional
amendment to make abortions illegal. Hut
nowhere near even 60 percent of this cam
pus is speaking its mind about abortion.
My hunch is that far more than five Stan
ford students — and not just women, either
— support a woman's right to choose when
she's ready to become a parent. My hunch is
that far more than five Stanford students
have had condoms break or taken a pill late
and have had to make heart-rending deci
sions. Assuredly, more than five Stanford
students would like to take their right to

choose to have an abortion for granted, as
well as their access to abortion services and
providers.
The facts, however, indicate that taking
this right for granted is blind, if not danger
ous. Abortion access in this country is
threatened day after day. Eighty-four per
cent of counties in this country have no
abortion provider. Clinics close under threat
of violence and lack of adequate Title 10
funding. Doctors, fearing for their lives and
practices, refuse to perform abortions and
stop teaching other doctors how to perform
them. Right-wing rhetoric (like Grundy's,
confused though it was) seizes control of the
discourse: suddenly fetuses are "children,"
and women are "murderers."
You, the silent majority, are taking for
granted — or are too apathetic to defend —
a right that is only a little bit older than most
students here and one that is currently
under siege. If you won't defend it in the
pages of your campus newspaper, you prob
ably aren't speaking out to your elected
officials, either. And you might be unpleas
antly surprised one day to find that right
profoundly eroded, at a time when you. or
your sister, or your girlfriend, or your
daughter, might most need to call on it.
If you don't want to talk back to Grundy,
do talk back to the people who are making
decisions that can affect your life. Between

now and Jan. 30, calling 1 -888-38-STAND
UP will connect you, for free, to your Con
gressional representatives. If you won't talk
to them, talk to each other. Argue. Change
each other's minds. Debate the issues. It's
too important a subject and too fragile a
right for just seven people on this campus to
be talking about it.

An explanation, of what
constitutes human life
In the Jan. 22, Daily, exactly 25 years
after the Supreme Court voided the State
laws of every single U.S. State by declaring
abortion a "constitutional" right, Jean
Hebert's letter to the editor raised the fun
damental issue at the core of that decision:
What is human life? Hebert correctly points
out that any skin cell is alive but does not
constitute a human person. What is a
human person? I would suggest the defini
tion given by Aristotle more than 2(KK)
years ago: a human person is a rational ani
mal. We are animals that think and make
rational decisions. Aristotle also distin
guishes between essential and accidental
characteristics. Essential characteristics are

those necessary for a being to be what it is,
whereas accidental are not.
For example, that I am a Cuban-Ameri
can 6' tall Stanford student is accidental;
that I can think rationally is essential to my
status as a human person. Essential charac
teristics do not always have to be active:
they can be potential, but the power to
achieve them must be there without a
change of essence.
What this means is thai Grundy was
arguing that a human embryo and a human
fetus has every essential characteristic of a
human person, and thus are a human beings
with a right to life. In particular, the power
to achieve all the we achieve is present with
out a change in their essential nature: all
that changes is nutrition and the necessary
environment needed to survive.

Using race as a factor
is discriminatory
The anti-Prop. 21W editorial on Jan. 20.
as well as similar letters recently submitted
by Stanford law students, are reflective of a
large fraction of the student body Ux> eager
to sacrifice justice at the altar of political

conformity. The authors of these knee-jerk
editorials have self-righteously urged the
repeal of a law protecting Californians
against race and gender discrimination.
Prop. 2W does not prohibit affirmative
action measures intended to provide equal
opportunity for socioeconomically disad
vantaged applicants; it merely ends the
patronizing practice of giving handouts to
the undeserving. The use of skin color as a
criterion for judging individual applicants is
inherently discriminatory and has no place
in the admissions process.
It is even more disturbing that the
authors would presume to prescribe their
discriminatory beliefs for all of California's
public universities. Were they so overconfi
dent of their position among the Stanford
elite that they have wholeheartedly devoted
themselves to the trivialities of politicaJ
fashion and appearances? How arrogant of
them to presume to speak for the intelli
gent. hardworking students of California
whose parents cannot afford Stanford's
exorbitant tuition, or who simply prefer to
be educated in less pretentious confines! It
is a shame that they have no better ideas
than to turn back the clock on a noble effort
by the University of California to reinstate
meritocracy and fairness in its admissions,
