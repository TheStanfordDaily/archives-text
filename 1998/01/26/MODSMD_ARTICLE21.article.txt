# Showering with the boys
## Shaving that shameful purity test score 
### 
Vanessa Bartsch

SEX SELLS. A statement of the obvi
ous, I suppose, as this week's ridicu
lous scandal circus has reaffirmed
that fornication can be a household word.
And if everyone else is grabbing a piece
of the action, I want to be a player, too. My
own verbal sludge to add to the mire.
So, here is: Perhaps best introduced by
TV Guide in an attempt to prevent mind
less flipping between figure skating and
Die Hard on the tube, I came upon "Girl
friend From Hell" with Liane Curtis: "The
devil turns a high-school wallflower into a
raven-haired vixen with claws and cleav
age. Adult situations, explicit language,
nudity, stupidity and violence." How such
a gem could get only one star is beyond me.
This movie struck such a close, personal
chord with me. Because I am the Girl
friend from Hell, you ask? I wish.
Alas, no. Instead it is because I know
the prime susceptible victim. That high
school wall-flower waiting for the deal with
Beelzebub and the opportunity to kick up
some spiked heels.
I'll call her Gwyn. While some of us were
notorious in our freshman dorms for hold
ing down the least amount of alcohol for the
most consecutive weekdays in a row, or
dorm-cesting with every person in our hall,
she, too. has found her own mark: Gwyn has
the highest purity score in her dorm.
For anyone who lives in the 24-hour
study room and has happened across this
paper a month later in the Meyer bath
room. the purity test score is like the SAT
of dirty things. Lower is better (or worse, I

guess). Each one of a hundred mild to spicy
exploits knocks one point of your score.
Yup, the dear kid got 99 percent. Not
quite perfect because she went to Full
Moon on the Quad. Ah, it brings a tear to
my eye. She is indeed all things good.
Sugar and spice. Pure as the driven snow.
Such a shame. She is tall, long-legged,
blond hair, blue-eyes. On her wall hangs
spurs and a crop. The girl even owns multi
ple pairs of chaps. Some with fringe.
All the potential to be wonderfully
impudent and rasty.
Instead, the tools of debauchery are not
for her men, but for her equestrian endeav
ors. That is how I found her. She came to
join the equestrian team and thereby was
placed under my wing.
It was a question of using leadership for
noble causes or delicious corruption. In
this case it was pretty cut and dry. This
young one came to Stanford for an educa
tion. And it says right there in the creed
that each of us has a responsibility to
uphold a rigorous standard of learning.
So for dear Gwyn, who didn't say a
word the first five times I talked to her, I
made a vow: to work, single handedly if
need be, to lower that purity score a full 10
points before Spring Break.
My old CIV TA used to like to point out
that no one should "impose one's own
moral standards onto others." Whatever. It
seems as I get older, the freshman get more
and more smart and less and less playful.
There is an obligation to fix this malady.
Corruption is all too easy when there is

a spirit longing to be freed — of course
road trips with countless nights stuck in the
middle of nowhere (i.e. Fresno) helps, too.
Being crammed into seedy motels with
very little to do is a great set-up.
To start with, Gwyn's dorm was pulling
for her like real troopers, and they deserve
most of the credit for the speaking. By the
time the first night in a motel arrived, those
eagerly garrulous frosh had her chatting up
a storm.
I think they even got her to go to a party
— with music, alcohol and boys. That
brought her to a 97. When she had an
impure thought while dancing to the Spice
Girls, she reached 96.
So at 96 our first road-trip and the

beginning of my crusade began. With a fair
amount of ease, I convinced five freshmen
and one transfer to scale the pool's fence
and hit the steaming hot-tub. Trespassing
alone would have gotten us to about a 95.
The fact that none of the kinder had

: thought to bring a
: bathing suit and
: the ordeal became
> a full monty affair
— Gwyn hit 94.
Of course, then
David agreed to
i join us, thereby
putting testos
terone in the
waters, and that

neatly chiseled off another point. And after
I gave her a big kiss for being funny, we had
arrived at 93.
I was sure that the run across the park
ing lot to the motel rooms without a towel
had to count for something, so we were left
with only a few points to go.
The next morning, one more point was
dropped when there was nowhere to
change into her duds but the parking lot.
For the second time in 12 hours, Gwyn was
in the buff in a public place. This time in
full daylight. Especially as the cars drove
by her fishing for a boot-jack wearing noth
ing but riding boots. And she was laughing
the whole time. It really was a Hallmark
moment. A real two-pointer on the purity
scale.
And that leaves just one little point.
So, as a personal favor. I implore her
friends, loved ones and anyone who
remembers having fun and using the puri
ty test as a "To Do" list — help me, help
her. If we can bring this sunny archetypal
frosh to claws and cleavage, we can sink
them all.
So, if you happen to see Gwyn biking
through campus with her huge smile and
innocent doey eyes, be creative. All it
takes is a wink, and we've got her. One
more freshman pulled over to the dark
side.

Vanessa Bartsch is a junior majoring in
music. She would like to thank Stewy for
being such a sport and for not running
over her the next time thev meet.
