## Women steamroll Huskies at home 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Life has been anything but easy for the
13th-ranked Washington women's basket
ball team.
After jumping out to a KM) start and
climbing as high as No. Kin the national rank
ings, the Huskies (12-4,3-4 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) took a serious nose dive. Washington
got swept in Arizona and then lost to Oregon
at home to slip to fifth place in the confer
ence.

■ SATURDAY'S RESULT: Stanford 90
Washington 70

But the Huskies rebounded with wins over
Oregon State and California (the two worst
teams in the Pac-10) and were looking to gain
some of their lost credibility Saturday night
against Stanford.
That didn't happen.
Instead the 11 th-ranked Cardinal (10-5.7-
1) abused Washington for a 90-70 win in front
of 6,273 at Maples Pavilion. And once again,
junior forward Kristin Folkl came off the
bench to do a majority of the beating, as Folkl
scored a career-high 36 points in just 27 min
utes.
"I think we need to have Kristin checked
because I don't think she's of this world." said
Washington head coach June Daugherty. "I
think she might be from the planet Mars or
something because that girl flat out gets up.
I'm not sure she's one of us because she is an
amazing athlete. She's definitely the differ
ence for Stanford this year."
But Stanford was sluggish for the first few
minutes. The Cardinal began the game with a
turnover and two missed free throws, while
Washington scored on its first two posses
sions to take a 5-0 lead less than two minutes

in.
Folkl checked in at the 15 minute. 27 sec
ond mark with the Card trailing K-4. and
Stanford proceeded to go on a 17-3 run over
the next live minutes for a l()-point advan
tage. Folkl scored eight points on the run and
got assists on two other baskets.
In fact it was the Folkl-Scott show all night
as the ( ardinal's high-low post game was op
erating like a fine-crafted machine. Senior
center Olympia Scott complemented Folkl
magnificently, and the duo put on an exhibi
tion in the post, scoring almost two-thirds of
Stanford's 90 points.
"It was pretty much go to Olympia and go
to Kristin night." said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "And that's what we talked about
before the game, wanting to get the hall in
side and make them stop our post players."
But after Stanford charged out to 21-11
advantage on a driving lavup by Scott with
10: IK remaining in the half, things stalled.
Washington's junior center Amber 1 iall, who
finished the half with 13 points, converted on
a couple of second-chance opportunities, and
the Huskies hung around.
The lead danced from 10 to six over the
next five minutes before back-to-back steals
by sophomore guard Melody Peterson and
Scott translated into easy layups for Stanford.
The Card stretched the lead to as many as 14.
but a free throw and an 8-foot jumper from
Hall cut it to 46-35 at the break.
Entering the locker room, Folkl was one
shy of her career high with 21 points (in 13
minutes) on 8-of-10 shooting from the field
and a 5-of-7 clip from the line. As a team
Stanford shot 55 percent from the field, com
pared to Washington's 39 percent.
The second half was more of the same as
the Cardinal continued to get it done on the
inside while the Huskies just couldn't keep
up. When Folkl sat down to a standing ova-
