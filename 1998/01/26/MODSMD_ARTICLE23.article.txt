The Stanford men's volleyball team kept its perfect
record through two matches this weekend.
Friday and Saturday night crowds of 3(H) and 250, re
spectively, watched the Cardinal (3-0,2-0 Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation) post important MPSF victories at
Burnham Pavilion.
The match Friday against UC-San Diego was a quick
15-5. 15-11, 15-12 Stanford win. In the second game, the
Cardinal was down 10-5 to the visiting Tritons before a
strong comeback.
But San Diego State gave the Cardinal a scare the next
night, taking the match to five games. 15-3,9-15,15-9, 10-
15,15-13.
Unfortunately for Stanford, the passing woes that trou
bled the Cardinal in last week's Ohio State match made a
repeat appearance Friday.
"We struggled even more tonight with our passing, but
the same solution worked," said Cardinal head coach
Ruben Nieves.
The solution that Nieves referred to was the entrance
of sophomore outside hitter Josh Palacios, Friday's player
of the game.
Senior Devin Poolman also credited Palacios with set
tling the Cardinal down, and Poolman assisted the Cardi
nal attack with some clutch serves of his own. He posted
an impressive five aces and only four errors.
Senior middle blocker Tad Hoffman also posted some
strong stats Friday. He added nine kills to the Cardinal
total while hitting .667. In addition, Hoffman also had
eight blocks, a high total for a three-game match.
Sophomore outside hitter Andy Witt was the kill
leader for the evening, with 16. Poolman and Junior
Patrick Klein each added seven kills.
As a team, Stanford totaled 15 blocks, while I'CSD
blocked the Cardinal only seven times.
Saturday's match against the A/tecs showed an entire
ly different Ux>k for the Cardinal, with two different
starters.
Senior captain Keenan Whitehurst became ill follow
ing Friday's match and did not attend Saturday's. Also,
Witt pulled a shoulder muscle and was unable to loosen it
for the match.
Junior middle blocker Jeremy Bart started in place ot
Whitehurst. Saturday was Bart's first match at middle
blocker since his sophomore year of high school, having
made the switch from the setter position following last sea
son.
Palacios made his first start on the season, although he
had been scheduled to do so. Klein also stepped up to till
the spot of the injured Witt.
The Aztecs then proceeded to give the ( ardinal a
scare, taking the match to five
games. SDSU essentially gave the
first game away and then put up a
strong fight.
Because the match went to five
games, the final one went to rally
scoring. The Cardinal was not able
to build a significant lead and won

Klein posted a match-high 35
kills. Hoffman also had a strong of
fensive match, posting 25 kills, a high
total for a middle hitter.
In addition to his presence at the
net. Klein also was visible defensive
ly. with a match-high 13 digs. Pool
man also added 12 digs to the Cardi
nal total.
Palacios again worked to settle
Stanford's passing.
"We showed our best serve-re-
