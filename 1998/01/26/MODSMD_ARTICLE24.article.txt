The grass stains on the little boy's
jeans reveal that this is not the first time

right of the bleachers. His constant gig
gling is drowned out by the loud music
piping from speakers above the press
box. so he is barely noticed as he rolls
past a couple sharing a blanket.

lie's going to get information on the
player," a major league scout in at
tendance said. "He will follow that
guy if he is a prospect."
With Austin one of the top
prospects for June's baseball draft, a
lot of scouts will be in attendance for
most of his games. At the same time,
it could provide ample opportunity
for Austin's teammates.
"There might be somebody else
in the game" that we'll notice, the
scout continued. "There's a lot of
people watching Stanford guys. Sud
denly he becomes [known as] a good
player."

With Tom Dunton coaching the
Cardinal pitching staff, Austin and
fellow major league pitching
prospects Chad Hutchinson and
Brent Hoard are in good hands.
Dunton's 23-plus years of coaching
experience at Stanford have inelud
ed guiding such first-round draft
picks as Jack McDowell and Mike
Mussina and winning two College
World Series.
" This is their year to blossom,"
Dunton said of the three juniors in
the starting rotation. "That's why all
those radar guns are out here."
Austin must have impressed the
scouts in his season debut, facing
Santa Clara on Friday. Pitching for
six innings, he gave up no runs and
only allowed three hits. Dunton,

however, doesn't want the scouts to
take away from the fun and the focus
of this season.
"We try to focus on the team
thing. The pro thing will take care of
itself," he said. College baseball "is
so much fun. Professional baseball is
work. It's a job. Enjoy this."
Perhaps with other teams there is
the potential for scouts to take the
focus off the club and onto the indi
vidual. At Stanford, however, such
is not the case.
"They are good about this,"
Dunton said. "They can handle it.
It's not a problem."
The scouts send out question
naires and, as the season goes on.
meet with coaches and players. Play
ers are eligible to be drafted after

their junior year.
"It's a long process," Austin said.
"So it's hard to tell what's going to
happen this early on."
Traveling to face Fresno State
this upcoming weekend, the scouts
should be out once again, not only to
observe the Cardinal but also to see
Bulldog prospect Jeff Weaver
throw.
To an observer, Friday's scene of
scouts at Sunken Diamond might
have seemed unusual, but to Austin
it neither added nor took away from
the excitement of opening day and a
season full of potential.
"The grass is a little greener and
the arm feels a little better," Austin
said. "Opening night is kind of spe
cial."
