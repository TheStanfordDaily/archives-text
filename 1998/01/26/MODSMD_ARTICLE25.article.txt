WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ FRIDAY'S RESULT.
An/ona State 194 275. Stanford
192.775
Hie squad sustained a lead for
three events of the meet but
couldn't hang on through the bal
ance beam and fell 194.275-192.775.
Die finish was two points better
than last week's performance
against Washington.
"Last week we had two gixxl
events, and this week we had three
gotxJ events." said head coach Mark
Cook. "Getting two points better as
a team was great: we just have to
maintain concentration and focus
for the entire meet."
The Cardinal opened the meet
with a strong performance on the
bars (team score) and led by eight
tenths of a point after the bars, vault
and floor exercises.
"Everyone hit their bar routines
perfectly, and the momentum really
carried over to the next events,"
said junior co-captain Amy Mu
rakami.
Murakami won the uneven par
allel bar event with 9.925, one-tenth
of a point better than the week be
fore Senior co-captain Ken Mona
han tied for first on the vault with
Arizona's Amy Shelton with 9.8.
On the floor exercise. Murakami
again led the Cardinal with 9.825.
which tied for third place.
The Cardinal could not hold on
to the lead through the balance
beam, suffering foui falls, and ASU
tix>k advantage ol the Cardinal's
poor performance to steal its eighth
straight victory at the University
Activity Center.
"It was disappointing because
we had the meet," Murakami said.
"We lost it ourselves because we
were ahead almost the entire time.
But it's comforting to know we can
hang with a team like ASIJ."
The loss means little in the world
of gymnastics; the only important
meets happen in the postseason. De
spite the loss. Cook remains opti
mistic.
"ASU was scared — they
thought we were going to heat
them," Cook said. "It was our goal
to put the heat on, and if we had
done the beam routines like we're
capable of doing, we would have
won."
The Cardinal has improved even
in one week of training after its meet
against Washington.
"We corrected a lot of mistakes
from last week but we made a lot of
new mental mistakes," Monahan
said. "We need to continue to
steadily improve."
The past two meets represent the
first collegiate competition for
freshmen Jenny Wilson and She-
Rae Chen and sophomore Kim
Young. The more experience they
get before the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships the better. Also, no

one was injured in Arizona (injuries
are always a factor), and now the
Cardinal has its first away meet be
hind it.
"It's a very different environ
ment at an away meet," Murakami
said. "The crowd's not behind you,
and you have to draw from each
other instead."
Cook was concerned with the
team's performance on the floor ex
ercise against Washington last week
but had little to complain about his
team's performance against the Sun
Devils. Their overall score of
192.775 was led by Murakami's
38.65 and Monahan's 38.5. Cook
was pleased the squad made no er
rors on its tumbling, meaning all its
start values were 10.0.
The upperclassmen continue to
lead the Cardinal. Murakami won
the all-around event with an im
provement of two-tenths of a point
over last week's score. Murakami
performed her bar routine almost
flawlessly, and Monahan performed
well in all events for the Cardinal but
shined brightest on the vault.
"This meet instilled the knowl
edge of how good this team is, and
now they're more motivated than
ever," Cook said.
The Cardinal next meets Ari
zona at 7:30 p.m. Friday in Burnham
Pavilion.
