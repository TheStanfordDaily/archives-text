The Stanford wrestling team en
tered its Friday meet against the
UC-Davis Aggies hampered by in
juries in the 126-, 134- and 167-
pound weight classes. Even with
the resultant roster juggling, the
team wrestled well but could not
come away with its first dual-meet
victory, losing 23-15.

WRESTLING

■ FRIDAY S RESULT: UC-Davis
23, Stanford 15

Sophomore Rudy Ruiz began
the match with an impressive 16-2
major victory in the 118-pound
weight class. With Zach Zimmerer
nursing a bruised collarbone, 118-
pound freshman Levi Weikel-
Magden had to wrestle up to the
126-pound division to fill in.
Unfortunately, Weikel-Mag
den was overpowered by David
Yi, Davis' natural 126, losing a
major decision 13-3 to tie the score
at 4-4.
Freshman Jason Talbott then
turned in one of the year's more
courageous performances.
Despite an ankle injury that pre
vented him from walking just days
before, Talbott wrestled a tough
match in the 134-pound division,
ultimately falling 7-5 to Davis'
Mike Collier.
"It was ridiculous. I can't be
lieve he wrestled." said freshman
teammate Kayvon Bina. "He was
in agony during drills — it's incred
ible that he wrestled."
Juniors Beau Weiner and B.J.
Sanchez followed with 8-2 and 15-5
victories in the 142- and 150-pound
divisions, respectively. This
brought the team score to 11-7 in
favor of the Cardinal.
However, Doug Bardsley fell 7-

5 to Adrian Garcia in the 158-
pound weight class, cutting Stan
ford's lead to one. Senior co-cap
tain Jeff Grant could not wrestle
because of his strained knee liga
ment, and so Shane Cross was
forced to fill in at the 167-pound di
vision. Cross never led in a 6-2 loss
to David Cobb.
Head coach Chris Horpel said
Grant may be ready Saturday
against Portland State.
Senior co-captain Scott Chap
man extended his three-match win
streak with a dominating victory
over Ryan Huftless. Huftless was
powerless to stop Chapman, as the
Ail-American scored six take
downs en route to a 14-4 major de
cision.
"He looked good this time,"
Horpel said. "Even in his last few
wins, I didn't think he wrestled all
that well. He's looked better each
match, though, and he's almost at
the point he was at last year."
Chapman's victory brought the
team score to 15-13. Facing a for
feit in the heavyweight division,
Stanford needed a major decision
from Tim Kendall in the 190-
pound weight class to win the meet.
They got the major decision.
Unfortunately, it was against
Kendall. Davis' Mike Roper man
aged seven takedowns ahd two
near falls in his 20-8 defeat of
Kendall. Davis added six more
team points with the heavyweight
forfeit.
"We wrestled some great
matches and some bad matches,"
Horpel said. "Had we had our full
lineup in there, I think we would
have beaten them. Even then, we
still had a chance, but we just didn't
come away with the matches we
needed for the win."
The Stanford wrestling team re
turns to action at noon Saturday
against the Vikings in the Ford
Center gym. - **>
