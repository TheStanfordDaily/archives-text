# Folkl, Scott put on show
## Washington falls victim to Card's high-low offense 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
How much more Stanford histo
ry can Washington stand?
Last year, the Huskies went into
the emotional melting pot of
Maples Pavilion and left with their
tails between their legs, as Wash
ington native Kate Starbird become
the school's all-time leading scorer
while spearheading a 30-point vic
tory.
This time, it was Kristin Folkl.
The junior forward put on a
show Saturday, tallying 36 points —
the fifth-highest single-game total
in school history — and joining the
hallowed scoring heights that only
Starbird and Jeanne Ruark Hoff
have scaled previously.
Not to be outdone, senior center
Olympia Scott contributed 23
points as the post players worked
the high-low offense to perfection
with great interior passing and
high-percentage shots, which could
only make Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer smile.
"It's something we work on
every day in practice," VanDerveer
said. "We try to give them situa
tions and try to isolate them [down
low] and that's kind of the game
plan. II it's football, we're establish
ing our run first. We're looking to

pound it in, and if they take that
away, we have some great outside
shooters."
For someone who is a big advo
cate of post play and high-percent
age shots, it's remarkable that Van-
Derveer has never coached a Stan
ford post player who had as many
points as Folkl did Saturday. Val
Whiting, the school's second-best
all-time scorer, scored 35 points on
two occasions, but she was both
starting and the catalyst around
which the Stanford offense re
volved.
Meanwhile, Scott has quietly
been racking up the points as she
moves up on the career scoring list.
After two solid performances this
weekend, she has slid ahead of
Rachel Hemmer for 13th place with
1,324 points. Not bad for a player
who, VanDerveer recalls, had her
first shot hit the shot clock.
While Scott has been a great per
former all season long — note the
31 points against San Francisco and
the amazing all-around game at Illi
nois — the senior center has taken
it to another level since Folkl's re
turn. In Folkl's nine games back.
Scott has set career highs in points
and rebounds.
"We feel very comfortable right
now." Scott said. "Obviously, the
high-low is working out pretty

well. I guess time will only tell be-fc
cause if we have this much chem-i
istry now, it can't get worse be-*
cause we're working on improving^
every day."
With such solid post play, thel
nonconference game at No. 5 Texas*
Tech next Saturday doesn't seem asl
imposing now. Playing at Lubbock!
Municipal Coliseum has never been?
a favorite pastime of the Cardinal,
(it has never won there), as thej
memories of senior forward Alicia !
Thompson pouring in 26 points two,'
seasons ago are probably still freshj
in Stanford's minds. The play off
Scott and Folkl can probably help!
avert a repeat performance.
"I did get a chance to see her thisj
summer at USA trials, so I know#
she's a good player," Scott said. "I#
know she faces up [to shoot] a lot,'
so we're going to have to prepare;
for that."
For now, however, it's an oppor-'
tunity for VanDerveer to savor her|
version of Utopia on the basketball J
court.
"I guess I'm more comfortable*
when we have a 30-point game from
a post player," VanDerveer said i
"Last year, I was nervous about ■
some of those Kate Starbird 30-»
pointers. I'm glad the team is con-!
scious of getting the ball to the post |
players."
