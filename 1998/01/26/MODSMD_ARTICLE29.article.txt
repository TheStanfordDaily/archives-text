# Search on for Founder's Day speakers
## One grad student speaker, one undergraduate will receive $1,000 cash prize 
### Brad Kane 
in a move designed to cultivate
student interest for this year's
Founder's Day celebration. Uni
versity President Gerhard C'asper
has announced a speech-writing
contest in which two Stanford stu
dents will win $1.000 each — and a
chance to speak at Founder's Day
activities.
The contest is open to all Stan
lord students. The two winners
one undergraduate and one grad
uate student — will read their
speeches at the April 5 Founder's
Day celebration in front of stu
dents, alumni, and University offi
cials. said Dean of Students Marc
Wais.
While student speeches have
been delivered at previous
Founder's Day celebrations, this is
the first year that a cash prize is
being offered. "We're trying to
generate excitement so students
will take part in this special event,"
Wais said. "We want students to
appreciate that they're at a special
place, with special people."
Wais encouraged all Stanford
students to participate in the con
test. and suggested that contest en
tries fall into one of the following
categories: a speech describing

what Stanford means to the con
testant; a research-based speech
concerning the founding family
and the events that led to the Uni
versity's founding; a speech re
garding the impact that Stanford
has on the world today; or a com
bination of the above ideas.
Entries should include a 300-
word abstract describing the pro
posed speech, as well as a copy of
the speech itself. The speech
should take no more than five min
utes to deliver.
An all-student committee will
review the speeches and select fi
nalists. As the winning entries
must be strong in presentation as
well as in content, finalists will
read their speeches before the
committee as a final stage in the
selection process, said committee
member Marcus Jackson, a law
student.
Senior Darlene Damm, last
year's undergraduate winner and a
member of this year's selection
committee, said she will be look
ing for "creativity, something that
w ill appeal to a w ide range of audi
ences."
Jackson hopes to see speeches
that are "unique, entertaining, and
appropriate to the day."
Founder's Day is an annual tra

dition that celebrates Stanford's
founding family and the history of
Stanford University. Scheduled
for the first Sunday morning of
Spring Quarter, events are
planned to begin with a public cer
emony at the Stanford Mau
soleum, followed by a procession
down Palm Drive led by Leland
and Jane Stanford's original
horse-drawn carriage.
The procession will make its
way to Memorial Church, where
the contest winners will deliver

If there's one Sunday to get out of bed, it's this one.'
— Marc Wais

their speeches following an ad
dress by Dean of the Chapel
Robert Gregg. According to Wais,
a variety of Stanford officials are
expected to be present, including
the President and the Provost.
"It's incredible to be in (Memo
rial Church], in front of all those
people," said Damm of her speech
at last year's Founder's Day. "You
can hear the echo of your own
voice. It's a very fun experience."
After the speeches, a reception
will be held in the Main Quad with
music, refreshments and artwork.
Mock versions of Leland and Jane

Stanford themselves are expected
to be present.
Administrators have high
hopes for this year's Founder's
Day celebration and for the
speech-writing contest, especially
with the new $ 1 ,(KX) cash prizes.
"It's hard to get students out of
bed on a Sunday morning," said
Wais. "By doing this, we're trying
to cast a very wide net to have a
speech that is interesting and is de
livered in a passionate and com
pelling way... .11 there's one Sun-

day to get out of bed. it's this one."
"President Casper is interested
in increasing the number of stu
dents who attend [Founder's Dav|
and improving the way that stu
dents can participate," said Assis
tant to the President Jacqueline
Wender. "President Casper is en
thusiastic about the prospects for
the competition and encourages
wide participation."
The contest entry deadline is
February 20. Entries can be sub
mitted to the Office of the Dean of
Students located on the second
