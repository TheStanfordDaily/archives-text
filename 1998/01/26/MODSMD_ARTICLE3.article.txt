# Alcohol-free Row?
## National organizations call for more dry options: campus reaction mixed 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
At its annual meeting this year,
the National Interfraternity Confer
ence unanimously adopted a resolu
tion to strongly encourage alcohol
free chapter facilities, but several
Stanford housed fraternity presi
dents say that for now parties will go
on as usual.
The conference leaders — repre
senting 66 international men's col
lege fraternities — unanimously
p ssed the resolution in an attempt
to curb alcohol misuse.
"The misuse of alcohol by college
idents is at an extremely serious
U vel that detracts from the mission
of higher education and does dam
age to the students themselves,"

stated the resolution.
Dean of Students Marc Waissaid
he embraced this type of resolution.
"We want to create a safe living and
learning environment for our
housed Greek community," he said.
Although they also claimed to
take the resolution seriously, Stan
ford housed fraternity members said
the initiative would have no imme
diate effect on the campus chapters.
"In general, if the Interfratcrnity
Council [at Stanford] issues a rec
ommendation. it is worth our Kx>k
ing into, but 1 don't see [the NlC's
resolution] directly having an effect
on our week-to-week activities,"
said Kappa Sigma President Brian
Pilko, a senior. "The [NlC's] repre
sentation is pretty far from our chap
ter."
Sigma Alpha Epsilon President
Misha Palecek, also a senior, said he
would not take action unless he
heard from the national SAEs.
"Il makes no difference until 1
hear about it from the SAE council,"
Palecek said.
Fraternity members also pointed
out they already have programs to
stop alcohol misuse.
"We have a very strict substance
abuse policy anyway." said Sigma
Chi President Michael Axt. a senior.
"We've already taken the appropri
ate precautions."
Actions taken by fraternities to
counter alcohol abuse include bring
ing in a recovering alcoholic as a
speaker, giving pledges materials on
substance abuse and having a physi

cian from the School of Medicine
talk about alcohol.
Axt said such existing precau
tions were sufficient for Sigma Chi.
"To our house specifically, the reso
lution doesn't [have any effect] just
because of our policies we have in
place and the steps we've already
taken."
Fraternity members also em
phasized the importance of infor
mal means to prevent alcohol mis
use.
"More important than the formal
programs are just members looking
out for one another," reminded
Pilko.
Palecek said SAE takes action to
help members if alcohol abuse is a
problem.
"In all honesty, (the NlCis] trying
to promote our safety." said Pilko.
"But in all honesty, this is the safest
place to throw a party."
In addition to precautions
taken bv fraternities and sorori

tics on campus, Wais pointed out
there also are university programs
targeted at stopping alcohol mis
use.
"Stanford alcohol education isn't
confined to an education week on
campus; it's literally an ongoing,
year-long educational process,"
Wais said.
The University has taken action
through the Cowell Student Health
Center, residence programs and
New Student Orientation. More
over. there are many classes offered
on the effects of alcohol consump
tion. whether they are biological or
sociological.
The NlC's resolution clearly sup
ports such measures. It reads."Prob
lems such as the misuse of alcohol
that involve the entire campus com
munity can be addressed successful
ly only with the commitment of the
colleges and universities and sur
rounding communities to recognize
and address these problems."
