They're as good as advertised.
Top-ranked Stanford soundly
delivered on the preseason media
hype with a two-game sweep of vis
iting Santa Clara in this weekend's
home opener at Sunken Diamond,
winning 15-2 Friday night and 7-5
Saturday afternoon.
Junior Jeff Austin, who garnered
acclaim during the 1997 College
World Series and went 4-1 as Team
USA's top starting pitcher over the
summer, remained conservative,
however, before the 1998 opener.
"It's tough to practice for it,"
Austin said. "You've got to rely on
what you've done against these guys
in the past.... They always give us a
run for our money."
The Cardinal last faced the Bron
cos in a crucial 1997 West Regional
contest, a hotly contested win that
vaulted Stanford into the regional
championship game.

Austin, however, breezed
through the Broncos' starting lineup
Friday night.
The right-hander threw six score
less innings, scattering just three
hits, walking one and striking out
live before retiring the mound to
freshman righthander Justin
Wayne.
Santa Clara scored its two runs
on a two-out, two-run homer in the
top of the ninth by junior third base
man Kevin Okimoto, a Palo Alto
native.
The Broncos, however, struggled
on the mound. The pitching staff
reached into the bullpen four times
as the Cardinal collected 16 hits off
five different Bronco pitchers and
scored in five of its eight times at bat.
Junior center fielder Jody
Gerut's two-RBI double in a three
run third inning put the Cardinal on
top Friday for good. Gerut, who fin
ished the night with three doubles,
also had a two-run double in a four
run fourth inning that gave Stanford

a commanding lead.
Sophomore left fielder Edmund
Muth, who cracked the first home
run of the season with a deep lint
drive that soared past the right-field
wall in Saturday's game, deflected
postgame praise to Gerut.
"I have a wonderful mentor in
Jody Gerut," Muth said. "To watch
him really helps me.... I think he's
the guy."
The Cardinal opened Saturday
on the mound with junior Brent
Hoard, a Baseball America 1998
third-team preseason All-American
pick.
Hoard didn't see much action in
Saturday's game, however. The left
hander retired early after going only
2 1/3 innings with three runs, two
hits and three strikeouts.
"On the whole, 1 thought the
pitchers were pretty good," Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess
said after the game. "This is the first
time out for [Hoard] this year, and I
think he got tired."

Santa Clara battled to the finish
Saturday. With two outs in the sev
enth inning, junior infielder Matt
(iiannini's double drove home
sophomore outfielders Eliot Wheel
er. Todd Hughes and senior out
fielder Hill Mott and diminished a 7-
2 deficit.
A three-up, three-down inning
for the Cardinal during the bottom
of the frame further favored the
Broncos.
Marquess opted for junior left
hander Tony Cogan to replace ju
nior righthander Chad Hutchinson
in the eighth. Hutchinson, who
made his baseball season debut Sat
urday after concluding as the Cardi
nal quarterback, worked four in
nings, tallying seven strikeouts,
three earned runs and six hits.
Cogan, a solid closer in the past,
proved reliable and held the Bron
cos at 7-5 to pick up his first save.
The Cardinal kicks off its first
road trip this weekend against No.
14 Fresno State.
