■ FRIDAY'S RESULT:
Stanford 161. Arizona 137
■ SUNDAY S RESULT:
Stanford 202. Arizona State 98

The women on the Arizona
Wildcats swimming team turned in
some fine swims Friday afternoon at
deCiuerre Pool, but like so many
others they were sent home without
a victory. Led by sophomore
Catherine Fox, junior Elin
Austevoll and freshman diver Kim
Powers the Cardinal women pre
vailed 161-137.
The Stanford swimmers then
came back the next day and soundly
defeated the Arizona State Sun
Devils 202-98 in a much less tense
meet.
Against Arizona the Cardinal
opened with a victory in the 400-
yard medley relay. Hut the Wildcats
weren't about to let this one slip
away without a fight. Laurie Kline
won the 1 .(XX) freestyle in 9 minutes.
53.43 seconds for Arizona. And
when Trina Jackson and Lindsay
Farella placed first and second in the
2(X) freestyle both teams understood
that there would be no blowout that
day.
"We were a little bit concerned."
said sophomore Maren Ewers. "We
were missing two of our swimmers
to illness, so we were just going out
and giving everything we had."
After seven events the Cardinal
women led by just four points. The
Wildcats were still in the meet.

thanks largely to Laurie Kline and
Trina Jackson. Aside from winning
the 1,000-yard freestyle she also won
the 500 freestyle. Trina Jackson was
another double winner, capturing
the 200 freestyle and the 200 butter
fly. She also added a second-place
finish in the 2(X) individual medley.
Despite their efforts Stanford, ever
so slowly, began to pull away.
This was due in large part to the
contributions of Fox. She captured
the 100 backstroke (54.65), the 100
butterfly (55.95) and placed second
in the 100 freestyle (50.60).
Austevoll also turned in a few
fine performances. She won the 1 (X)
breaststroke in 1:03.46 as well as the
200 breaststroke in 2:17.05. She also
swam the breaststroke leg on the
winning 400-yard medley relay. An
other huge contributor for Stanford
was the diving team, and more
specifically. Powers. Competing at
the same time as the swimmers, she
quietly turned in one good dive aftjer
another en route to winning both the
1-meter and 3-meter diving compe
titions.
"We had a solid performance,"
said diver Carissa Zenorini. "The
points scored in diving were very im
portant."
In the end there were just too
many swimmers from Stanford who
were just a little t(x> fast. When all
uas said and done the Cardinal had
solidified its hold on the No. 1 na
tional ranking.
The Stanford women then re
turned to the ptK>l the next day
against an overmatched Arizona
State squad. In what became a romp
the Cardinal came away with victo
ries in every event except the 4<K)-
vard freestyle relay.
Accounting for three of those vio
Tories was Catherine Fox. She
touched first in the 50 freestyle
(23.41). the 200 backstroke (2:01 .W))
and the 1 (X) butterfly (55.32). Stan
ford also had three other multiple
winners Saturday. Freshman Lauren
Thies came through with victories in

the 2(H) freestyle (1:51.64) and the
400 individual medley (4:22.72).
Austevoll dominated the breast
stroke events for the second day in a
row. She won the l(X)breaststroke in
1:04.45 and the 200 breaststroke in
2:17.90. Also coming through for the
second consecutive day was the
women's diving team. Junior Larissa
Zenorini won the 1-meter diving
competition as well as the 3-meter

event.
"There weren't many stellar per
formances, but overall it was a solid
meet," said sophomore Jessica
Tucker-Mohl.
All in all this weekend proved to
be quite trying on the Cardinal
swimmers. But when the Cardinal
had finished its post-meet cheer Sat
urday it was still undefeated and still
atop the Pacific 10 Conference.
It was one of those scenarios in
which somebody's best simply
