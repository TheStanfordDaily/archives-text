# Men cruise in home meets

Top-ranked Stanford men's
swimming opened up its Pacifie 10
Conference schedule at deGuerre
Pool with victories against Arizona
on Friday and Arizona State on Sat
urday. The Cardinal overwhelmed
the Wildcats 150-85 and defeated
the Sun Devils by nearly the same
margin, 153-83.
The most impressive swims of the
weekend were from junior Blake
Holder and senior Tom Wilkens.
The best group effort was from the
100 freestylers.
" The thing I'm so pleased with is
we have people that are coming
down little by little by little every
meet," said Stanford head coach
Skip Kenney. "Blake Holder is the
best example of that."
Stanford opened the Arizona
meet with a sweep of the medley
relay and went on to win every event
but the S(X)-yard freestyle and the
I,(MX) free. Ryk Needling — the
NCAA champion in the 1,650 free
— took those events for Arizona.
Stanford junior Matt O'mara and
freshman Jeremy Kane gave him a
run but came up just short.

Stanford was able to win in con
vincing fashion with all the stroke
groups coming through. Senior Tom
Wilkens, just back from the world
championships in Australia, set pool
records in the 400 individual medley
and the 2(X) breaststroke. He just out
touched Holder in the 200 breast,
both were under 2 minutes. Before
this year nobody had been recorded
under 2 minutes in a meet. Wilkens
has been under the magic barrier
twice this year (he was under against
Texas), and Holder narrowly missed
doing it back-to-back as he won the
2(X) breast against the Sun Devils in
2:00.2.
The 1 (X) freestyles were equally
impressive this weekend as Stanford
had four swimmers under 45 sec
onds on the 4(X) freestyle relay. Out
standing swims were turned in by se
nior Sabir Muhammud, junior Justin
Ewers, sophomore Glenn Counts
and senior Scott Claypool as the
four combined for a 2:57.94. Sabir
had a Ramadan personal best. The
race was among the best ever for an
unshaved relay here.
Wilkens and freshman Steven
Brown came back from world cham
pionships earlier this week. They
had shaved and rested for the meet

so it was a challenge for them to
come in, train again and then race
this weekend. Their events are more
grueling; the 200 fly, the 4(X) 1M and
the 500 free are Brown's specialties.
These events all require a lot of en
durance.
Another bright spot was Stan
ford's diving squad. Freshman
Lucas Brower spent most of the year
out with a wrist injury. His return
made an immediate impact as he
won both diving events this week
end. Sophomore Mark Michelin
also had impressive performances,
taking second. The resurgence of
the diving team bodes well for the
rest of the dual-meet season.
Junior Justin Ewers was impres
sive in his close runner-up finish to
Arizona State's Francisco Sanchez
in the 100 free. Ewers contributed
more to the meets than just fast
swimming, however. He was re
sponsible for bringing the land shark
cheer back to Stanford.
Stanford has a ways to go before
it can be compared to the title-win
ning teams of 1992-94, but the Car
dinal seems to be on the right track.
With each meet, Stanford is demon
strating that it may seriously con
tend for the national title this year.
