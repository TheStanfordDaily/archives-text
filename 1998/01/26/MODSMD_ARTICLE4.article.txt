# Promises vs. progress
## Andrus and others reflect on ASSU successes, delays 
### Allison Hays Saurabh Prakash Staff writers 
With its officers' terms ap
proaching the halfway point, the
ASSU is still working to fulfill last
year's campaign promises. The
ASSU's performance has received
mixed reviews from students, rang
ing from mild contentment to out
rage.
ASSU President Emily Andrus
and Vice-President Ben Decker
promised during their campaign to

concentrate their efforts on directly
addressing student concerns. They
portrayed themselves as realistic
leaders who wanted to change the
way student government operated.
"Emily and Ben ran on a plat
form which criticized my adminis
tration for being 'activist' and doing
too much." said former ASSU Pres
ident Bill Shen, a senior majoring in
public policy. "They offered a bare
bones minimalist alternative."
Their promises included return
ing the tradition of Big Game Bon
fire to Lake Lagunita, creating a

student course guide and revamp
ing funding procedures for student
groups.
This year, the Axe Committee
managed to organize a controlled
campfire in Arrillaga Field com
memorating Big Game. However, it
was not as grand as the traditional
custom.
Members of the ASSU re
searched. wrote and submitted a
proposal to the University request
ing a revival of the bonfire, but the
University ultimately decided the
environmental risks were too high.
"It was a big deal, if you ask peo
ple in the know, that the University
even looked at our proposal," said
Andrus, a senior. 'Time was our
biggest constraint."
One of the ASSU's notable suc
cesses was the initiation of a com
prehensive student course guide.
Under the leadership of Senate
Deputy Chair Matt Spence, a
sophomore, the ASSU convinced
the Faculty Senate to release critical
quantitative data from end-of-quar
ter class evaluations. Although de
layed, the course guide will be avail
able spring quarter.
Andrus believes that the course
guides will influence teaching meth
ods. "Now professors will know
they will be evaluated and be cog
nizant of that," Andrus said.
The recurring and pressing issue
of funding for student groups has
not received the attention promised
by Andrus and Decker. Although
the ASSU has sent surveys to stu

dent group leaders inquiring about
their needs, they have yet to pro
pose changes in funding proce
dures.
" This year we've chosen to focus
on the essential functions of the
ASSU that are often overlooked,"
Andrus said. "We're laying the
groundwork for student govern
ment in the future."
Some students feel disappointed
in the progress the ASSU has made.
"The president's description in
the election handbook is imbued
with irony," said Wade DeGottardi,
a senior physics major. "Not only
were many of their promises left un
fulfilled, but the state of the ASSU is
almost an exact reversal of what
they said it would be."
Others expected less of their rep
resentatives. "Although this year
has been unremarkable in terms ol
sweeping change, at least our lead
ers have not made any terrible deci
sions for students," said senior
Charles Buxbaum.
Shen points out that this year's
ASSU has "reduced the obnoxious
trivial bickering which has charac
terized past years."
This year's ASSU meetings are

dramatically shorter and more in
frequent.
One new project the ASSU has
undertaken is a career fair geared
towards humanities students.
"We'll he having a career fair (on
Feb. 13-14] for people who aren't in
terested in investment banking,
consulting or science and engineer
ing." Andrus said.
Shen understands the commit
ment involved in leading the student
body.
"I believe many in the ASSU
don't realize just how much is re
quired of them before they're elect
ed — it's a rude awakening," Shen
said. "The ASSU believes in its
promises, but the time and energy
required to (fulfill them) often far
exceeds what students are able to
commit."
To some, the ASSU's perfor
mance has been redeemed only by
the initiative of some individual sen
ators.
"Without clear and unified re
sponsibilities. it seems as if the Sen
ate has drifted from issue to issue,
buoyed by the work of a few indi
vidual senators like Joe Freund and
Matt Spence," Shen said.
