The Asian financial crisis isn't
just affecting Asia. Some Stanford
students and their families, faced
with severe devaluation of their
homelands' currencies, are scram
bling to pay their tuition bills.
According to Mun-Hong Hui.
activities coordinator of Malaysians
at Stanford, the crisis requires some

students from Asia "to pay five
times more for the already exorbi
tant fees."
"It's a double whammy because
prices of imported goods skyrocket
ed and there are widespread lay
offs." Hui said. "It all happened so
abruptly that most people are in
shock."
The financial crisis has particu
larly affected Thailand. Singapore.
Malaysia. Korea. Indonesia, the

Philippines and China — resulting
in a severe and sudden drop in the
value of their money. At Stanford,
there are 42 students from Thailand,
106 from Singapore. 27 from
Malaysia. 194 from the Republic of
Korea. 27 from Indonesia, 175 from
Taiwan, and 266 from China, ac
cording to Bechtel International
Center.
• The effect of the crisis on Stan
ford students depends largely on
their funding. While many interna
tional students have received fellow
ships from Stanford to attend school
here, most fund their education
through grants from their govern
ments or through family support. In
ternational students are ineligible
for financial aid from the U.S. gov
ernment.
The Thai Embassy in the United
States, which funds tuition for many
Thai nationals at Stanford, recently
released a letter to the University
with a list of students here who are
being funded by the Thai govern
ment. The letter explained that the
government was no longer able to
continue payment.
In response to the letter from the
embassy. Tom Wasow at the Office
of Research and Graduate Policy
immediately drafted a letter to vari
ous departments across campus ask
ing if there was anything that could
be done to help the international stu
dents. Within days, a private entity
stepped forward to express interest
in donating money.
The example from the Thai com
munity is not unusual. Cynthia Rife,
director of student awards in the Fi

nancial Aids Office, noted that "in
dividual donors have stepped for
ward to offer some help to under
graduates."
An international financial crisis
such as this is not completely foreign
to Stanford. 1 he Financial Aids Of
fice experienced a similar surge of
concern from Mexican nationals in
early 1995 when the Peso plummet
ed. Then, as now. Rife noted her of
fice has "made every effort to care
fully consider these cases and re
spond within [the office's] con
straints."
She noted that "some organiza
tions which sponsor students have
asked for more time to pay."
Bechtel Director John Pearson
noted that students from several
Asian nations have recently ex
pressed concerns about the crisis.
Some have been issued leaves of ab
sences so that they could return
home.
According to Pearson, time may
exacerbate the effects of the finan
cial crisis. He has spoken with his
counterparts at Ivy League schools
and the consensus is that "it will be a
while before we see the lull effects of
this."
He explained that the current fi
nancial situation will also likely af
fect the number of Asian students
who will apply to study in the United
States.
