### Kumar Narayanan Contributing writer 
Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative
crilie of affirmative action, launched
a five-day stay at Stanford with an in
formal seminar in Stern Hall on Sat
urday. He discussed his views on a
broad range of topics from race to
gay marriage.
D'Souza, author of the best-sell
ing and controversial "Illiberal Edu
cation," spoke to an audience of
about 75 students in Twain. He
opened with a brief outline of his
views, then engaged the students in a
lively discussion.
"Affirmative action is the result
of the incompatibility of two goals,"
he opened. "One is merit ... where

people are judged on the basis of
their abilities... and the other is rep
resentational diversity, a search for
rough parity .... There is consider
able tension between these two
goals."
In response to a question,
D'Souza discussed the concept of
natural differences in intelligence
between the races. "There is no sci
entific reason that there can't be [dif
ferences] â€” clearly the races are dif
ferent physically. I'm leaving the
possibility of natural differences
open; I think that they are quite
probable."
If natural differences in intelli
gence existed, D'Souza said that
from a conservative standpoint, he
would "favor affirmative action to

make efforts to narrow these differ
ences."
He focused on the wide disparity
of Hispanics and Blacks compared
to Whites and Asians in standard
ized test scores, and attributed them
to "differences in preparation, pro
ducing unequal outcomes."
To address these differences.
D'Souza. who in "Illiberal Educa
tion" advocated preferences based
on social and economic status, spoke
of mentoring programs, outreach ef
forts and school vouchers.
"You've got to go to the root of
the problem and improve these skills
at a lower level." he said.
He continued on to advocate
"shock treatment" of the system and
said that there is "ambiguity in the

idea of equal opportunity."
In a separate exchange, sopho
more Eric Vishna said that he val
ued affirmative action because "I
learn trom those around me."
D'Souza responded with the
point SUC5 UC ' 1 decisions have a
price for someone else. "I would like
to ask these students who would give
up their place for affirmative ac
tion."
In response to another battery of
questions concerning gay marriage.
D'Souza put forth cases and exam
ples that he said stretched the defin
itions of marriage.
The questions from the audience
challenged D'Souza. and the discus-
