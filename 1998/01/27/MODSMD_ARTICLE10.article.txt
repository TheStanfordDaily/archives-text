## Few Democrats openly defend Clinton's actions 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In its
current, imperiled state. President
Clinton's political future will he
shaped by the support he com
mands from congressional
Democrats. And thus far, at least,
few of them have come forward
with a forceful defense.
The party's two leaders in
Congress, Sen. Tom Daschle of
South Dakota and Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, have yet to
expand on brief statements they
issued last week that stopped short
of saying they believed the presi
dent.
"These are serious allegations,
which the president has denied, and
which deserve an investigation that
should be conducted quickly and
fairly," Daschle said in a written
reaction to allegations that Clinton
had sex with a former White I louse
intern and urged her to lie about it.
Since then, Democrats have
come up with a variety of ways to
avoid saying whether they believe
the president.
"I want to believe him." said Sen.
John Kerry of Massachusetts.
Sen. Christopher Dodd of Con
necticut was asked whether he
believes Clinton's denials. "1 think
all of us do at this point." he replied.

Rep. John Lewis of Georgia,
more robust than many Democrats,
issued a statement Sunday that crit
icized Independent Counsel Ken
neth Starr for conducting a "parti
san, agenda-driven fishing expedi
tion. with very little to show lor it
... This president has my support,"
Lewis said.
In a curious postscript, he added,
"As the Great Teacher reminded us:
We have all sinned. For those with
out sin. let them cast the first stone."
Still, the pulls thus far show con
tinuing support for Clinton's job
performance in office, and most
lawmakers aren't due in Washing
ton until today, when Congress con
venes at noon and the president
delivers a prime-time State of the
Union address.
After Clinton issued a fresh
denial of the allegations yesterday.
Vice President A 1 Gore met pri
vately with about three do/en mod
crate House Democrats and pro
fessed his own belief in the presi
dent. At a session that had long
been scheduled, he urged the law
makers to show their support "for
the president and his agenda today,
tomorrow night (when the State of
the Union is delivered) and into the
future," according to one person at

the session.
Some lawmakers, including Rep
Calvin Dooley. D-Calif., said after
wards. they "believe in the presi
dent," but others were more cau
tious.
Rep. Jim Turner, D-Texas, told
reporters everyone was "waiting
for the facts to come out." And
Rep. John Tanner. D-Tenn.. said of
the allegations, "It's pretty obvious
that if they're true it's one set of cir
cumstances. and if it's not that's
another."
The moderate Democrats consti
tute Clinton's political base in
Congress. Three years of triangula
tion politics by the White House left
many of the liberal rank and file on
the outside on issues such as welfare
reform and a balanced budget, and
there is little reservoir of patience.
The weaker the president appears
politically, the more they fear he will
be forced to accept compromises
with Speaker Newt Gingrich. Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and
other Republicans. And that is the
opposite of what they want heading
into the IWS election campaign.
If Democrats are treading ner
vously. Republicans are eager to let
them — and the news media — take
the lead.
