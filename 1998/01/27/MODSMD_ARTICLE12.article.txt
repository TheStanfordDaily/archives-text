AT&T to cut 15,000 jobs
NFW YORK (AP) — Stung hv a drop in
profits, AT&T Corp. said yesterday it will cut at
least IS.(KX) jobs, freeze executive salaries and
shake up management to reduce costs.
The job cuts include a 25 percent reduction in
the company's 450 top officers over three years
as AT&T attempts to reduce what many ana
lysts consider a bloated management structure.
The*company's new chairman. C. Michael
Armstrong, said the elimination of 1 5.(KH) to
1 S.(KK) jobs — up to 14 percent of AT&T's
work force of 125.( K X) — will come mostly
through attrition and voluntary retirement.
The reductions, which will include hiring
fewer outside consultants and closing offices,
are expected to save $1 ,(i billion this year alone.
The shakeup was detailed after the company
announced an IN percent drop in profits in the
fourth quarter of last year. AT&T was hurt by
a decline in revenue from its core long-distance
phone business.

AT& T earned $1.33 billion, down from $1.62
billion in the same period a year ago. Revenue
slipped from $12.<X7 billion to $12.53 billion.
"Overall, the company has delivered and in
fact beaten most analysts' expectations both on
the earnings front and in expectations of where
the restructuring is going." said financial analyst
Raghu Ram ot Wheat First Butcher Singer in
New York. "It gives more confidence in the
company as it goes foi^wSra.
Navy violated policy on gays
WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge
said yesterday the Navy "embarked on a search
and 'outing' mission" in ordering the dismissal
of a sailor accused of homosexuality based on
information obtained from an on-line service.
In ruling that Timothy R. McVeigh, who is
no relation to the convicted Oklahoma City
bomber, should remain on active duty pending
the final outcome of the case, U.S. District
Judge Stanley Sporkin said McVeigh is likely to

prevail in his contention that the Navy violated
the "don't ask. don't tell" policy on gays in the
military, and a federal electronic privacy law.
" This court finds that the Navy has gone too
far." Sporkin wrote in his 15-page decision
granting McVeigh a temporary injunction
against the Navy discharging him while his case
is being considered. "Although Officer
McVeigh did not publicly announce his sexual
orientation, the Navy nonetheless impermissi
bly embarked on a search and 'outing' mission.'"
Though not the final word in the case, yes
terday's decision represents a sharp rebuke of
the Navy, both for its enforcement of the mili
tary policy on homosexuality and for the intru
siveness of its investigation. It promises to
reverberate beyond the military to all govern
ment that might want to bolster investigations.
Senior Chief Petty Officer McVeigh, a highly
decorated 17-vear Navy veteran, landed in
trouble last fall w hen the Navy found a "profile
page" posted on America Online in which a
"Tim" from Honolulu described himself as ga\
and expressed a sexual interest in young men.
