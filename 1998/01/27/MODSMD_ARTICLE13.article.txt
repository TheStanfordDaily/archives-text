# Northern Ireland peace talks stalled
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) â€” The party
representing Northern Ireland's
largest pro-British paramilitary
group withdrew from peace talks
yesterday, leaving before they could
lie expelled because of three killings
claimed by their outlawed ally.
The sudden departure of the
I Uster Democratic Party, which rep
resents the banned Ulster Defense
Association, will likely raise fears of
more attacks against the north's
Roman Catholic minority.
The group walked out of negoti
ations tni Northern Ireland's future
before the British and Irish govern
ments could force them out for
allegedly violating the pledge
required of all participants non
violence.
I'DA commanders "have them
selves admitted responsibility for a
series of appalling murders which
have created such fear on the
streets in Northern Ireland." said
Mo Mowlam. Britain's Northern
Ireland Secretary.
"You can't have people mur
dered and ignore it." she added.
The UDA is supposed to be
maintaining an October IW4 cease
fire to ensure the I 'Ister Democrats
a place in the talks. But the group
admitted that it killed at least three
of the eight Catholics slain in
Northern Ireland since Christmas.
Former U.S. Sen. George
Mitchell, chairman of the talks and
author of the nonviolence stipula
tions. said it was necessary to regis
ter protest against "a relatively
small number of eunmen ... acting

in defiance of all democratic princi
ples."
Ulster Democratic Part) leader
Gary McMichael vowed to keep
counseling UDA members not to
kill and to get his party back in
the negotiations, which began in
June IW6 and are supposed to con
clude by May.
"I want to make it clear that we
will not walk away from this pre
cess." he said, flanked by seven col
leagues. four of whom spent time in
prison for attacks on Catholics.
Mitchell. Mowlam and Irish
Foreign Minister David Andrews
suggested the Ulster Democrats
could be admitted again within
weeks if the UDA isn't blamed l"r
any more murders.
At a reception at the I S.
embassy yesterday evening, anibas
sador Philip Lader said it was
hoped they could rejoin si>on "on
the basis of a genuine commitment
to exclusively peaceful and demo
cratic methods."
Leaders of the Ulster I momsts.
the main pro-British Protestant
partv. and the Social Democratic
and labor Party, which represents
most of the north's Catholics, had
demanded that the UDA represen
tatives be punished.
"Some distance had to 'v put
between the killers and this pro
cess." SDI.P negotiator Mark
Durkan said. " I h*. Ulster Demo
cratic Party themselves said that
their mandate, their right to be at
the table, depended on the silence
of their guns."
