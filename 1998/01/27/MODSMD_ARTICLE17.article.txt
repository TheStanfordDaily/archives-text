National council's decision
is impractical and diverts
responsibility from houses.
THE DECISION of The National
Interfraternity Conference last week
to encourage a ban on alcohol
among member fraternities is an ineffective
attempt to stop the misuse of alcohol bv
undergraduates, and overlooks what col
lege education, and fraternity life, is all
about — responsibility.
Several major international fraternities
announced programs last year to ban alco
holic beverages from their facilities. Last
week. Phi Kappa Sigma also announced
programs to ban alcoholic drinks.
These moves may have been made with
the best of intentions, but they overlook
two important drawbacks that render them
virtually null: first, that such a ban is easier
to announce than to enforce, as many fra
ternity members are likely to simply seek
alcohol elsewhere; and second, that coer
cion is not, most college students would
hope, what compels their actions.
Similar "resolutions" to ban alcohol
within fraternity facilities have been made
in the past, and they were quickly proven
ineffectual. Students who like to drink will
drink — if not within fraternity facilities.

then elsewhere. A ban. then, simply draws a
thin line around the boundaries within
which alcohol is prohibited: it does not in
any way prevent its potential to harm. Con
versely. it may facilitate off-site drinking
and by association drunk driving.
Furthermore, banning alcohol seems
more like a measure for children than for
adults who should know how to behave
responsibly. College is a time of learning,
not only about academia and society but
also about self-discipline, responsibility and
individual maturity. If alcoholic beverages
are banned in a facility, it should be because
the students in that facility understand the
harmful effects of excessive drinking and
decide to individually or as a group elimi
nate it from their activities. It should not be
because they are deprived of the power to
make that decision.
Alcohol is not a social ill. It is the irre
sponsible use of it that causes harm to indi
viduals and communities. Such irresponsi
bility will not be stopped by a ban.
The resolution is an effort to encourage
member fraternities to recommit them
selves to their core missions — i.e. to
encourage scholarship, build leadership
skills, develop friendships and provide com
munity service. But if collegiate fraternities
are in essence about community-building,
then a ban on part of its activities effective
ly denies the very principles of trust and
responsibility that foster these values.
