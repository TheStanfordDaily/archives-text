## Overcome the rut of "God is dead" 
### 
Rec all the old
picture of the
mouse, the cheese
and the maze. The mouse
runs furiously around the
maze until it reaches the
gratification of the cheese.
After this happens, the

human observer may place another piece of
cheese elsewhere in the maze, and the sim
ple process restarts.
Now let's modify things a bit and say that
the maze's bottom is only made of dirt and
that there are mouse-size shovels dispersed
throughout the maze. There are even small
signs that say "Dig here to escape." Given
that the mouse doesn't read and cannot use
a shovel, of course, the mouse runs right by
these things.
The mouse is seemingly content to run
around in the endless passages looking for
the pleasure of cheese. Now. some mice are
more adept than others at finding the
cheese due to better developed skills in
achieving the goal of their common endeav
or. But all of them are just "happy' to do the
same thing — over and over. The same
often goes for humans.
In fact, when Nietzsche wrote his famous
declaration that "God is dead." he seemed
to have humanity's tendency toward mun
dane repetition in mind. Specifically, Niet
zsche's target was often the blandness of
Christians, those God-seekers. And he pro
claimed "God is dead" partly because he
saw the growing possibility of more and
more people freeing themselves from the
bindings of "God" and Christianity.
To offer an example of his criticism,
Nietzsche outwardly blasted Christians for
their narrow-minded focus upon requiring
the "gospel" before one can 'think.' For

instance, he characterizes the reading of
biblical verse as "impudent arbitrariness"
where the Christian crudely says "1 am
right, for it is written."
Similar to some Christian communities,
we must recognize the perils of a modern
day mind-set with which we are tempted in
our 'enlightened.' elitist community. That
is, like the mouse that is boxed in by the
walls of its maze, we are tempted to spout
"God is dead" with "impudent arbitrari
ness," thereby boxing ourselves.
For example, modern-day atheists are
frequently very efficient at regurgitating
Nietzschean criticism, regardless of whether
or not one is intimately familiar with Niet
zsche's works or can even pronounce his
name. The reason that one can be familiar
with aspects of Nietzsche's thought without
having read him, unsurprisingly, is because
it has meshed quite well with many modern
perspectives.
And as indicated above, it is difficult to
dispute the insight of some modern thought,
but we must recognize about what it is
insightful! For example, does the wisdom
stem from unveiling certain stale and ques
tionable ways of following "God?" If so —
that is, if "God" is dead because thinkers
have illuminated pitfalls of some Christians
— does this necessarily lead one to athe
ism?
No! The problem is that one can become
so wrapped up in criticizing something like
the way of life of many Christians that one
becomes defined by that which they
despise! And further, one cannot see
beyond this very limiting definition — quite
ironically, just as an atheist might argue that
a person cannot see beyond biblical doc
trine.
Regardless of the way of thinking, it

seems that human beings have a strong ten
dency to be like the mouse in that we
quickly run past the shovels that otfer
something more than the same old thing.
That is to say, we are easily seduced into a
cohesive yet extremely incomplete philoso
phy (whether it he Christian, anti-Chris
tian, conuvunist, capitalist, etc.). And once
inside whatever particular philosophy we
have 'selected,' we find it hard to stretch
the mind and dig somewhere beyond where
we have been.
For instance, one could be quite accurate
to say that "God" is dead in the sense that a
part of humanity has freed itself from some
of the atrocious manifestations olChristian
ity by "killing" the burdensome idea of Cod
(commonly cited examples of "God's" ugli
ness: the Crusades, the murder of Native
Americans "in the name of God," etc.).
However, to go no further than to say
that these atrocities are synonymous with
"God" and to therefore conclude that one is
an atheist is to care to be no more than the
mouse. For instance, to base one's life upon
opposing Christianity or upon Nietzschean
thought is to violate a core aspect of Christ
and Nietzsche alike — that is. the idea of
continually fighting against the temptation
of narrow-mindedness.
And in doing so, one must learn to pick
up a shovel and dig for oneself. Sometimes,
there may even be sign posts hinting at
where to dig. And in the process, we may
discover that although "God" can frequent
ly be dead. God is not.

Jon Servaites, a December graduate in
chemical engineering, also says that shovels
are pretty heavy and that maybe this is
where the insightful Nietzsche went wrong.
