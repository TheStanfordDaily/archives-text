# End to bilingual education?
## Panel decries Unz initiative 
### Ann Kim Contributing writer 
A recently proposed initiative to end bilingual educa
tion in California schools wouldn't allow schools to re
spond to communities' needs, panelists said in a discus
sion last night on "The Case for Bilingual Education."
Panelists presented arguments against the "English
for the Children" initiative, which Silicon Valley busi
nessman Ron IJnz has placed on the June ballot. The dis
cussion was sponsored by the Stanford branch of the In
ternational Socialist Organization.
Panelist Leyda Garcia of the Redwood ( ity Commit
tee Against the Unz Initiative explained to a group of
about 31) that "all bilingual programs have the goal to
teach English. The idea is that its easier to learn a second
language when taught in the native language."
Garcia provided an overview of the current manner
in which bilingual education programs operate and the
changes that the Unz initiative proposes.
Currently there are 1.4 million limited English profi
ciency (LEP) students in the California, and 30 percent
are enrolled in bilingual education programs, she said.
Individual schools have discretion in determining
whether or not to implement a bilingual education pro
gram for their students, and parents also can decide
whether or not to enroll their children in schools that
offer these programs.
Bilingual education programs teach content-based
subjects such as math, science and social studies in the
students' primary language while they learn English,
until they gain the skills and ability to learn other subjects
in English.
Garcia explained that the Unz initiative calls for one
year of "sheltered English immersion." which would
place LEP students in an English-only classroom where
they would learn their second language without receiv
ing instruction in any other subjects, such as math or sci
ence. After this year, the students would return to a class
room of their appropriate grade level, "supposedly hav
ing learned the English they would need," she said.
"It prescribes only one method of English teaching
for all schools and all students," Garcia said of the Unz
plan.
The initiative also makes teachers personally liable
for speaking a non-English language in the classroom, al
lowing for lawsuits if a teacher is caught doing so. "This
wouldn't encourage teachers to try and use different
methods to teach their students." she said.
Garcia opposed the proposed program's omission of
content-based instruction during the one year of English
instruction. She also disagreed with the way in which the
ballot initiative would take away a parent's choice in en
rolling their child in a bilingual education program.
The initiative allows for bilingual education schools if
there are 20 parents per grade level who receive a special
waiver that must be approved by a teacher, a principal
and in some cases the district superintendent.
Garcia pointed out that the process of obtaining a
waiver would be especially difficult for immigrant par
ents who themselves may have limited English skills.
"Overall, [the initiative] limits how much leeway
schixils have in addressing the needs of their own com
munity," she said.
According to Eduardo Capulong of the San Francis
co branch of the International Socialist ()rganization. the
Unz initiative is merely capitalizing
on a general crisis of education na
tionwide.
"Every time there's a crisis, people
look for scapegoats." said ('apulong.
He explained that many schools in
California employ uncertified teach
ers because ol a large shortage as well

as underfunding.
"In the past 10 years, the number
ol students in California has doubled
but the funding has not kept up." said
Capulong.
Freddy Tejada, a community or
ganizer for the Northern California
Coalition for Immigrant Rights, char
acterized the I i 11/ initiative as "one
more attack on immigrants." in the
tradition of Propositions IX7 and 2(W.
He opposed the initiative's one

year English program, explaining
how it took him almost four years to
learn English as a legal immigrant
from F.I Salvador.
I'ejada added that "regardless of
whether we beat this initiative or not,
what we want is to empower immi
grant communities so they know
what's going on around them.
"Unless we become more politi
cally involved, we can't defeat the ini
tiative."
