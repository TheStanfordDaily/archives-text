Don't blindly follow the
left: bilingual education
The Daily recently published a story on
students protesting against the IJn/. June
ballot initiative to eliminate bilingual edu
cation. While I greatly admire the students
for being active in political issues, I read
the report with some concern.
Earlier in my college career I too
aligned myself with the left, albeit a bit
blindly, and found myself active in a variety
of protests: against the damage to the Gay
Liberation Sculpture, alongside the
hunger-strikers who were protesting the
firing of Cecilia Burciaga and against the
removal of the Women Defending Our
selves Collective from campus. I am grate
ful. however, that in the past few years a
good friend has taught me the enormous
value of objectively considering issues
independent of my prior political alle
giances.
As for the ballot initiative. I received a
letter from English for the Children late in
IIW7.l l W7. I was troubled at first when I read
that bilingual education was being chal
lenged. but when I read further. I realized
that LJnz was acting because he had been

asked to by Latino parents who felt that
their children were being hurt, not helped,
by California's broad bilingual education
program. I proceeded to write him and his
organization a long letter describing my
own positive experiences with bilingual
efforts in various Peninsula schools, and I
included copies of literature praising other
programs in the state. I urged him to insure
that any literature provided by the organi
zation to voters present the virtues as well
as the vices of the current bilingual system.
Just as I felt Unz's organization neglect
ed some of the relevant evidence contrary
to their position. I also feel the same con
cern about the Stanford community, which
often prematurely dismisses anything that,
at first sight, appears to threaten the inter
ests of people of color. To those who joined
the protest. I hope that in your fervor to
work for justice, you will consider that per
haps this movement has some valid points.
Many teachers would agree that bilin
gual education is not working as it ought to
and would benefit from a massive over
haul. Anyone who has spent any time
working in local schools has seen or heard
evidence of how the system can come to be
abused. It would be unfair, as well as detri
mental to the health of our schools, to dis
miss I Jnz as a right-wing reactionary whose

efforts are corrupted by racism. Good ideas
are so rare that we cannot afford to over
look those that come from people who
appear to be standing on the other side of
the fence. If we all make conscientious
efforts before we vote to see the valid con
cerns raised by both sides of the campaign,
our decisions are much more likely to be
sound and to remedy the flaws that plague
our schools.
Finally, very little is gained when we
demonize all such initiatives as "anti-immi
grant." Of course, some are just that, but
many are not. Rather than jump to conclu
sions based on stereotyped categories and
surface appearances, it is our responsibility
as citizens carefully to consider issues inde
pendent of our ideological pre-dispositions.
As for me, I cannot be sure which cam
paign will receive my vote. No longer do I
give any camp my unquestioning allegiance.
I think it crucial that we all suspend our
prejudices and initial reactions to social
issues so that we may truly appreciate their
complexities. It may feel good to sign a peti
tion or to rally alongside other right-think
ing, good-hearted people without investi
gating what can be said for the other side.
Hut such automatic and inflexible demons
trations of loyalty to our principles serve
neither the truth nor the people in society

about whom we profess to be concerned.

Self-ops save money and
teach life skills
As a former resident of three self-oper
ated undergraduate houses, it is with great
sadness that I read of their upcoming
demise ["No more self-ops," Jan. 23].
While Keith Ciuy has managed to cover the
collective hindquarters of Stanford Hous
ing and Dining Services by claiming "We're
not doing this to make money," I wonder if
he has fully considered alternative possibil
ities.
The cleanliness of a self-op is generally
related to how anal one's house manager is.
You leave a mess or forget to clean, you get
fined ... or does the house manager let it
slide? Instituting an appropriate screening
procedure for house managers that identi
fies slackers would result in more effective
enforcement of house cleaning rules, or at
least help identify which residences might
require more frequent inspections.
While most self-ops only pay students
for doing the most heinous cleaning tasks

(Oh, no! The grill!), perhaps the house or
University might consider paying a student
to vacuum the floors or clean the bath
rooms. Certainly the student minimum
wage is lower that what our University
union workers pull down. This could lessen
the impact on rent, and many of us could
use the money to pay for rent or books or
smoothies ... but no. Mommy still works
here, and she's wearing a Housing and Din
ing Services uniform. Imagine if she could
follow you everywhere!
As the renovation program continues, it
would certainly do well for us to look
around and admire the increased value that
is being added to the Stanford community.
Not the brighter lights and fresh paint, but
the sense of community and responsibility
that is instilled in the student body through
the independence of the self-ops. Some
times we forget that our Stanford-educated
students, who will go out into the world as
(hopefully) responsible alumni represent
ing our University, are our greatest asset. It
would be nice to know that someone has
given some thought toward maintaining
their value, too.
