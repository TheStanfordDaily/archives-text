## Casper's unbecoming commencement 
### 
Garry Grundy

RIGHT NOW. NO one is speaking al
the 1 (KSth Commencement Ceremo
ny.
As of this day, graduates of this fine I Jni
versity shall not he forced to pretend we are
interested in the advice shoveled down to us
from a strategically placed podium in Stan
ford Stadium on June 14, IWK. I ast year's
commencement speaker. Justice Stephen
Breyer, was confirmed as early as Novem
ber to deliver the summertime lullaby; but
as of now, there is no one.
What is Gerhard doing then?
I can only assume that President Gasper
— the man who ultimately makes the deci
sion — is still considering candidates hand
ed down to him from this year's senior class.
So what then is the difficulty?
I would argue that Gasper's self-imposed
'Stanford affiliated' rule on the speaker
poses an unnecessary strain on securing a
commencement speaker. Saying that the
designated speaker must have some con
nection with the University grossly limits
this year's marvelous prospects prospects
engaging enough to translate this years cer
emony into a memorable experience.
President Casper, if the speaker is charis
matic (a quality, mind you. lacking in more

recent commencement speakers) and if the
guy (or gal) is wanted by the student body,
then you should like a good German
president try everything in your power to
bring such a person to campus. President
Casper, break from this 'Stanford affiliated'
lunacy and permit the peoples' choice to be
heard. Stanford isn't a Pomona or Williams:
we are big time! Internationally known and
recogm/ed we could bring in any god
damn body! I rom Jimmy < arter to (ieorge
Bush; Benjamin Netanyahu to Nelson Man
dela to Michael Jackson we could really
have ;i thrilling commencement! Are our
dreams truly this stunted - limited to an
ambitious former San Francisco mayor
turned Senator and a handful of Clinton
appointees (those who are not yet facing
indictment); or are we still dreaming of lur
ing Tiger back to the Farm?
I don't put nothin' pass 'em.
I. on the other hand, do dream big. And
I have in mind the perfect person to deliver
the final send-off at the 106 th Commence
ment. My proposed speaker is one that has
managed to (and continues still to) touch
the life of every senior on this campus.
Transcending the boundaries of race and
economic class, this man has caused us all to

turn the analysis of the human condition
inward, while maintaining a great sense of
wit, charisma and animation.
I propose that Jerry Springer deliver the
KKHh Commencement speech.
Jerry is the ideal commencement speak
er for Stanford students. The former mayor
of Cincinnati (former because he wrote a
personal check to a hooker), there is no
question that he can add that certain 'bad
bov' politician dimension to the graduation
(hell, he makes Marion Berry and the pres
ident look like Augustinian monks), while
importing a little real world intellectualism
into the commencement celebration — for
this man has been there, seen both sides and
rode with the rise and fall. Furthermore.
Jerry's daytime / late-night talk show has
emerged as the integral component to much
of the Stanford experience, he transforming
our TVs into mirrors that reflect the human
soul.
Moreover, The Jerry Springer Show is a
bold testament on the nature of the world in
which we're being slung into — that is a
world of pre-op transsexuals, transvestites.
racists, rednecks, hermaphrodites (and
sometimes a combination of any of the two
or three). Jerry has schooled us on life on

the outside. Preaching that we take care of
ourselves and each other' is a lesson tar
more valuable than any lecture on "why
(iod is dead. Jerry is the reason that most
Stanford students will he able to enter this
hrave new world beyond I University Ave.
And judging from the show. Jerry cer
tainly has more than theme in his favor: ht
doesn't blab for hours to the sound of hi»
own voice as past speakers have been know
to do — a clear indication of ( asper's ham
in the selection.
Jerry could certainly serve up a memo
rable adieu for Stanford graduates. He
touched our lives every day for the past lour
years — while we've endured the shitty post
office service, the incessant jogging on this
campus and the hypersensitive people that
write into The Daily every goddamn day
Jerry has been with us.
Monday through Friday. 11 a.m.
So what is stopping us from bringing the
man that has molded the minds of the next
millennium?
President Casper, break from the old
and enter the new: permit non-Stanford
affiliated speakers to speak at graduation. I
don't know if I shall be able to sit through
another dull speech presided over by anoth

er member of the Supreme C ourt.
I hat constitutes cruelty.
Word on the street has it that President
( asper may be considering the 112 irst Lady as
a speaker.
How tasteless.
Freshman Chelsea Clinton hasn't even
finished CIV \el. How much more devoid
of class can we be'.' I he Classless Class of
IWK You people have got no style!
Now, Jerry, he has style. I he jaz/y intro
music and the Kandinsky-esque painting
that looms over his "Final I hought.' Picture
the hype: "Jerrv Springer delivers Com
mencement Address at Stanford." The
cameras would return to campus — the
country's spotlight would be ours again.
While old judges and old money addressed
our Iriends on the Fast coast, we would be
the envy of the nation.
And il his speech is an\thing like his talk
show , the I (Kith ( ommencement is destined
for history.
Hell, maybe Condi will jump up in the
middle graduation and slug Gerhard.
