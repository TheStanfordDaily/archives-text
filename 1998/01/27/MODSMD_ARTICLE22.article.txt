# The 						early admissions debate
## Both students and schools win 
### Alda Leu Editorial staff 
SINCE THE ADVENT of an early
admit program at Stanford two years
ago. both the number of applicants
and the University's yield rate have risen
steadily. These factors indicate that Stan
ford is moving up in popularity and nation
al prominence.
I he instatement of two early decision
programs at Stanford, Early Decision 1 and
Early Decision 11. brought Stanford's sys
tem up to par with other top notch universi
ties like Harvard and Yale that have Early
Decision or Early Action programs.
I here are two ways to consider the value
of such early admission programs, looking
at the impact to students and the effect on
the admitting University.
I he student .
These programs allow students to ippty
for admission to their top school of IhoHj
choice and.in some cajflpfrcicre.ise Iheir
likelihood of admission and secure admit
tance at an earlier date. lTiese three benefits
apply to the student that knows \fchat they
want and want the quickest way there.
The argument has been made that stu
dents applying for early admission tend to
be white and from higher socioeconomic
backgrounds. This, however, is not a direct
consequence of an early admit program, nor
is it its intent.
Applying early does not cost more, nor
does it require special training. It only
requires thinking about college a little bit
earlier. Students that had an upbringing
that did not or eould not emphasize a col
lege education are at a disadvantage
regardless. It applies as much to college
admissions altogether as it does to early
action. Irrespective of race or socioeconom
ic background, students need to be thinking

about college admissions earlier. An earlier
deadline simply requires more forethought.
And it is not for all people. Some stu
dents may want to explore their options,
visit other schools and decide later. These
students can apply for regular admission.
The argument that their admissions are neg
atively affected is bogus. The early admit
pool at Stanford actually had higher scores
and GPAs than Stanford's regular admit
pool. An outstanding academic record and
list of activities will distinguish a student no
matter when they apply.
Furthermore. Dean of Admissions and
Financial Aid Robert Kinnally has said that
he has tried to limit accepting too much of
the entering class through these early admis
so that regular admit stu
dents O still have a fair chance of getting
in.
The school
Cynics have pointed to a university's
to increase its yield rate to bolster its
Pcademic reputation and perhaps its US
News ranking. Stanford does not subscribe
to that ranking system and would thus not
likely be trying to influence its outcomes.
The University views early admission as
what it is: a chance to take a closer look at
students that have made Stanford their top
choice and a chance to save some students
months of worrying.
Schools that have early admissions pro
grams realize that diversity is important.
They understand that for most students,
college selection is a long process. These
students will still be recognized and
addressed.
Regular admissions are not a thing of the
past and never will be. Competition for top
students is won through good teachers,
classes and programs — not through early
admission.
No one is denying that.

Since Stanford, Princeton and Yale
instituted Early Decision programs
effective with their 1996 applicant
pools, Early Decision programs
have become one of the most con
troversial topics related to higher
education. Over the past decade
Early Decision, a program that
once appealed to a small number
of students, has become an option
increasingly encouraged by uni
versities and adopted by students.
Although Early Decision continues
to -serve well'those students who
are positive they want to attend a
particular institution, other stu
dents increasingly feel compelled
to make early application to
schools simply because many
Early Decision programs offer
higher admission rates than do
Regular Decision programs.
Assembled here are the argu
ments for and against the mainte
nance of Early Decision programs
and the accounts of how two
members of the Class of 2001
• dealt with the Early Decision
option.
