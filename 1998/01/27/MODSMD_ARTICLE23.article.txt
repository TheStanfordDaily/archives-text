# Mania has gotten out of hand

THE INCREASING TREND
among high school seniors to apply
to colleges under Early Decision
programs has been termed a "mania," a
"frenzy," and "a system that is out of con
trol" by admissions officers and college
counselors alike. And they couldn't be
more on target.
While Early Decision was once an
option exercised by a small minority of stu
dents who were KM) percent sure that they
wanted to attend a particular institution.
Early Decision applications are now made
by about l()(),()()() high school seniors
nationwide. While these students still rcg|i!
resent a small percentage of college bounatf
seniors, the trend toward Early Decision
has been encouraged by the lai&e number
of schools that have created si«ch programs
during the past decade, J,he ( ©liege Board
reports that than 450 schools nation
wide now Decision programs.
Indeed, although morelstudents are
making to jejpols earlier
than in the pall, many students today are
no better equipped at finding the perfect
school by October than they were a gener
ation ago.
According to Rory Bled, college adviser
at Berkeley High School, Early Decision
has become an option increasingly
embraced by students and parents due to
candid acknowledgment at many institu
tions that early decision programs enhance
prospects for admission.
But while such programs tend to benefit
colleges and universities by ensuring them
higher yields and the chance to claim exclu
sive rights to the best and brightest in each
year's applicant pool, such programs are
not in the best interest of a vast number of
students.

Colleges, in their quest for higher yields
and strong student bodies, seem to he lor
getting the developmental changes that
occur during the senior year of high school;
changes that often result in students view
ing what they want out of their college
experience differently in the fall than they
do in the late spring.
Moreover, early admission applicants
are disproportionately Caucasian and come
from middle to higher income families who
are not seeking financial aid. The require
ment "binding" students to schools where
they have received early admission discour
ages students needing financial aid from
applying for fear that the aid package
offered by the school will not meet their
111l Early Decision programs also favor stu
dents on the East Coast where the largest
numbers of schools offering such programs
! are clustered. Students on the East Coast
have an easier time visiting schools there
during the academic year, the only time
when students can obtain an accurate feel
for the atmosphere of the institution.
Despite of the very real drawbacks to
Early Decision programs, the Early Deci
sion mania isn't going to stop until colleges
take the lead and put an end to the mad
ness. While yields and strong student bod
ies are important, the current system places
a greater premium on enhancing prestige
and a school's economic well-being than on
the true needs of students as they grow and
change during their senior year.
The solution? Colleges should place a
nationwide moratorium on Early Decision
admission programs for three years. Such a
plan would allow students to make
informed choices in the spring of the senior
year rather than nine months before they
enter college. It would also allow colleges
to re-evaluate the necessity of these pro
grams.
