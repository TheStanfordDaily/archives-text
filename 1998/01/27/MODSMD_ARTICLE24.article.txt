## Keeping my options open 
### 
EARLY DECISION WAS never an issue for me.
Although I spent hours (lipping through page
after page of college guidebooks, agonizing over
every detail, from location and selectivity to the quality of
the food, it never even occurred to me to apply anywhere
Early Decision.
For one thing, I had no idea where I wanted to go.
Did I want a school with a couple thousand undergradu
ates or a couple hundred? Would I like the atmosphere
of an Ivy League school? What factors were most impor
tant? I debated. I pondered. I fantasized about being the
first woman to go to Deep Springs. Mostly though. I was
indecisive.
Sometime in the middle of junior year, rumors started
spreading about how colleges were filling more and more
of their spots with Early Decision candidates. Stories
came down though long chains of people that it was next
to impossible to get into highly selective schools during
the regular decision admission round.
I heard these stories, but didn't pay much attention to
them. It seemed that Early Decision was more like a
bonus, a convenient option for people who had known
where they wanted to go to college since the day they
were born rather than a sneaky way to beat the system.
I figured that if a college was going to accept me,
they'd accept me. It seemed strange to me that so many
people were applying to colleges early out of fear, believ
ing that they otherwise couldn't make the cut.
And besides, applying Early Decision meant choosing
a school in the fall of my senior year. I had narrowed my
choices to about 30 colleges and none of them stood out
as the one place I could be happy and productive. Well,
sometimes one did, but by the next day it was displaced
by an even more amazing school. My short list included
everything from Reed to Amherst, from Cornell to Col
lege of the Atlantic.
When I finally sent out my applications, they were to
Carleton, Stanford. Wesleyan and Brown, although I
never completed the last one. My favorite still fluctuated
daily, but it was mostly between Carleton and Wesleyan.
After having compared the experiences of going to a high
sch(K)l of 3.000 people and spending an entire summer
living and working with the other members of a Forest
Service trail crew, I had realized that I was much more at
home in smaller settings.
I liked being where I could be an active part of my envi
ronment and not an anonymous body being herded along
and tunneled off to the appropriate area or class. A small
liberal arts college seemed like the perfect place for me.
Until I went to visit one, that is. The idea of Carleton
had seemed so appealing â€” a small, close-knit college
tucked away in a p<xket of Minnesota. Once I was there,
though, and realized what "small" meant, it didn't seem
so great anymore.
My tour of the campus took about 10 minutes and
after a walk through the arboretum, there wasn't any
thing left to explore. Did I really want to spend four
years, four Minnesota winters, on a tiny, isolated campus
in the middle of nowhere, seeing the same few faces again
and again? No.
I visited Wesleyan as well. There was a town at the

edge of campus, hut I liked that even less than the isola
tion of Carleton. The whole area seemed like an endless
collection of sidewalk and buildings, and I wasn't espe
cially enthusiastic about the overall atmosphere. 1 met a
lot of very stylish, very catty people.
Then I came to Stanford, mostly just to visit California,
because I was convinced that I wouldn't like the school
itself. That attitude changed soon after I arrived. Instead
of feeling intimidated, overwhelmed or anonymous, as I
had anticipated, I was immediately happy and at ease.
There were palm trees, blue skies and smiling people
who started detailed and personal conversations rather
than just shaking my hand and walking away. Most
importantly there was a sense of opportunity, limitless
ness and excitement that I hadn't felt at the other colleges
I had visited.
I found that I liked the bigger size, both the physical
space: the foothills, the lake, the spread-out campus and
the sheer number of students, each with his / her own
opinions and backgrounds. And I realized that 1 was, in

fact, more suited to both an Ivy League and more techni
cal environment than to that of a small liberal arts college.
I decided to come to Stanford. I'm glad I did, and I'm
glad I waited long enough to find out where I really
belonged. What I wanted in a college experience seemed
different in April than it had in October. Although I'm
sure I would have been fine anywhere, I'm happy I kept
my options open.
