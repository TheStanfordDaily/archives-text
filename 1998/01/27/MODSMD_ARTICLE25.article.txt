ALTHOUGH I HAD wanted to come to Stan
ford since eighth grade, I never realistically
thought I could he admitted until the summer
before my senior year when I spent six weeks at Lamb
da Nu with the Stanford Youth Environmental Science
Program. While most of the program's curriculum is
devoted to exploring environmental issues, part of the
program is also directed toward preparing for the
upcoming college application process. It was at this
program when I first heard of the somewhat weird pol
icy of Early Decision. At first it struck me as a sort of
twisted Faustian pact:
Me: Please, I want to come here more than anything
else! 1 don't care about other schools!
Stanford: OK, turn in your application two months
early to show how serious you are. And if we accept
you. you must withdraw your applications from all
other schools.
Me: OK, I'll do it!
Stanford: Then you'll HAVE to come here. There's

no turning back, ha ha ha!
Hut (hen I started hearing things like SO percent of
Harvard admits in IIWSl l W5 came from harly Action and
that Stanford Early Decision applicants are accepted at
a slight ly higher rate than Regular Decision candidates.
And I started to think, hey, maybe there's something to
this. I figured, "If I am sure that I would accept an ofler
to Stanford before anywhere else, why not let the
admissions committee know just how serious I am?"
The decision to apply early was completely a jx-r
-sonal one. and it is a decision I made without hesita

tion. Some people are not sure which school is best for
them and need more time to weigh their options, but I
felt comfortable here from the first time I visited.
Some base their decision on financial aid. but I
knew that Stanford would have more financial
resources to offer me than most schools. Some need
the extra months to get their act together, get that last
SAT out of the way. but not me â€” 1 was ready.
My family was definitely behind me in my decision,
however, I somewhat downplayed the fact that 1
wouldn't be able to consider financial aid and admis
sion offers from other schools if Stanford accepted me.
I just figured if Stanford shortchanged its helpless
Early Decision applicants with obscenely low financial
aid offers, that would be reason enough to break my
"pact" and consider other schools. I remember asking
for letters of recommendation at the end of September
of my senior year. I was the first person in the history
of my high school to apply anywhere early. I thought it
was insane that I was reading over my essays for the mil
lionth time in between handing out candy to trick -or
treaters. At that time, most of my classmates had hard
ly given thought to their applications.
My high sch(x>l counselor was a bit concerned that I
was placing all my eggs in one basket (I was only the
second person in the last 10 years or so to be accepted
to Stanford from my small school). She insisted I apply
to at least two UC's for her own "peace of mind."
There were some definite fringe benefits to apply
ing early. For example, those six weeks that I had to
wait before I received a response from Stanford,
although it seemed like sheer torture, were nothing
compared to the four months that many of my friends
had to wait. Additionally, the acceptance letter from
Dean Montoya was a great Christmas gift!
Although it was difficult for me to withdraw those
other applications (not because I would never know if
I got in, but because I spent the money applying in the
first place), I am glad 1 did not have to spend the extra
time getting test scores sent, hassling faculty for more
letters or weighing different acceptance offers.
The quick acceptance in December gave me more
time to concentrate on AP tests, scholarship applica
tions and day-to-day school activities. Also, it was nice
having a whole semester of approving nods from teach
ers and admiring gazes from underclassmen. My
friends, however, got a bit less limelight because by the
time they made their decisions in late spring everyone
was too wrapped up in his/her own future decisions
and the general "we're-graduating-soon" stuff.
Early Decision is definitely a growing trend in col
lege admissions. An article in this year's college rank
ings issue of US News & World Report discussing the
program, and Dean of Admission and Financial Aid
Robert Kinnally said at an informal talk. "Half of the
East Coast applied early to Stanford." At the same
time. Early Decision is certainly not for everyone. For
me, it worked, and I was completely satisfied with the
process and my decisions.
