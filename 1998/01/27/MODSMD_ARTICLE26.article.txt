plenty of top-notch athletes.

UCLA, 2 p.m.

Hut seldom have they had the
attitude ol Catherine Fox, a spark
ly sophomore who helped the
United States swimming team to a
gold medal in the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta. And fewer have met
George Clinton and the P-Funk
All Stars and Bill Clinton on the
same night.
"She is always really happy and
has a smile on her face," said five
time gold medal winner and Fox
()lympic teammate Jenny Thomp
son. who graduated from Stanford
in 1995. "She tells great stories,
too."
()ne of Fox's favorite subjects is

her two weeks in Atlanta.
"Atlanta was amazing," she
mused. "I don't think anything will
ever top it. Imagine 17,(KX) people
cheering for you. Just for you."
In the 4(X)-meter freestyle relay.
Fox turned in the performance of
her career, steaming through the
pool and helping the relay team
win the gold.
But Fox's tale doesn't linger for
long on her own achievements.

Instead, she plowed ahead into
a vivid description of the early
morning hours of July 27th. the first
night after the swimmers' events
had been completed.
"We were all given pagers by
the Olympic Committee so they
eould find us if they needed to." she
said. "We were just hanging out
and all of a sudden I got a page that
said, 'Bomb went off in Centennial
Park. Please call ASAP.'

"I thought it was a joke. But
then everyone else started getting
them. We went downstairs and on
the TV the news was going crazy.
No one knew anything, and we had
no idea what was going on.
"So eventually we get the mes
sage to meet at our hotel, as fast as
possible, so they could check us in
and make sure we were all OK. But

we didn't know where the hotel was
in relation to where we were, so we
started to walk. Pretty soon most of
the team was hiking through down
town Atlanta, with no idea where
we were or where we were going."
"Hut eventually we found our
way hack. Unfortunately they in
stated a curfew the next night."
Fox still found ways to have fun,
especially within the Olympic Vil
lage.
" They had the biggest cafeteria
for all of the Olympians, with a 24-
hour free McDonald's. The second
week, after all of the swimming
events were over, that was all I ate. 1
became the biggest bum."
Such a bum. in fact, that at a na
tional meet after the Olympics, Fox
was so out of shape that she swam
one of her worst meets just a month
after winning a gold medal.
After such an incredible experi
ence. many Olympians slip into de
pression. Hut somehow it eluded
Fox.
"I don't know what post-
Olympic depression is," she said.
"For me,

I was going into a whole new situa
tion: I was going to start my fresh
man year of college [at Stanford]. It
was a huge change, and in many
ways the events of my freshman year
were comparable to those at the
Olympics."
As Thompson said. "She really
knows how to enjoy life to the ut
most."
Overall. Fox said, her Olympic
experience was,"the most crazy,
exciting thing I've ever done."
Fox's road to the Olympics was
an unconventional one. As a child in
Kansas City, Kan., the future
Olympian started as a young "pool
rat."
"One day," Fox remembers, "the
coach came up to me and said. 'Take
me to your mom.' " The next time
she stepped into the pool, it was as
part of Kansas City's youth league.
()nce on a team, the young swim
mer always preferred diving to
swimming.
"I used to hate swimming prac
tice. but loved diving practice. When
it came time for swimming practice,
I'd have a stomach ache or some
thing."
If only all stomach aches could
end with a gold medal and 24-hour
free McDonald's.
