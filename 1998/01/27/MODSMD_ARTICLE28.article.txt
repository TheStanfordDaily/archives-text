WOMEN'S RUGBY
■ SATURDAY'S RESULT: Stan
ford 29. S;in Diego Surfers (lub 5
■ SUNDAY'S RESULT: Stanford
42, UC-San Diego 0

The team traveled to San Diego
over the weekend where they en
joyed not only adding two vietories
to their record, hut a break from the
Stanford rain and a chance to bask in
the Southern California sun.
The Stanford women's rugby
team competed once Saturday
against the San Diego Surfers club
team and again Sunday against
tJC-San Diego. Stanford defeated
the Surfers by a score of 29-5, and
then beat UC'SD 42-0. Stanford
head coach Franck Hoivert was
pleased with the quick style of play
which Stanford took into the
games.
"Stanford played quicker than
the opposition." Hoivert said.
" I hit is our philosophy of play, es

pecially when Stanford is generally
a smaller team than much of the op
position."
Coach Boivert said that Sunday's
game against I J("SD was highlighted
by the team's quick offensive reposi
tioning. This allowed Stanford to ex
ploit the poor defensive reorganiza
tion of the Tritons. By creating over
laps of excessive attackers on multi
ple-phase balls, Stanford was able to
break through the defense.
There are points to work on as
well. Coach Boivert said that the
negative was that Stanford had too
many turnovers and ball handling
errors, especially in the UCSD
game.
"The team lost interest, intensity
and concentration at the end of the
IJCSD game," Boivert said.
Boivert said that this could have
been the result of a long weekend of
multiple games, and also because
the team does not have many re
serves at the moment. The inability
to have many substitutions over a
weekend of games may prove to be a
handicap for Stanford when it comes
time for the playoffs, which general
ly have multiple games scheduled
over a single weekend.
Coach Boivert was particularly
pleased with the play o! sophomore
flyhalf Janet Lewis.
"Having improved positioning
and playing closer to the advantage
line at the flyhalf position may ex
plain why the team is scoring more
points," Boivert said.
Also instrumental in these games
were sophomore blindside flanker
Biasha Mitchell, junior prop Susan
Landsitel, and senior fullback Su/.ie
Hoffmann who scored several trvs.
"Su/.ie was in her ordinary form."
Boivert said, "she has had a good
season so far."
The Stanford's only loss came to
the Berkeley club team that has sev
eral U.S. National team players.
Playing against club teams that
often have older and more experi
enced players is nothing new for the
women's rugbv team.
In order to fill in their schedule,
games are often scheduled with club
sides due to the fact that many col
leges and universities have not had
women's rugby teams — not entire
ly a bad thing since the team can gain
experience by playing these tougher
opponents.
But much of this is about to
change. A newly formed Northern
California Women's Rugby Colle
giate League has been formed.
There are now ten collegiate sides in
the new league including I JC-Davis,
Humboldt State, UC-Berkeley,
UC-Santa Cruz. Santa Clara. San
Jose State, ( al. State Monterey, and
Nevada along with Stanford. Al
though some of the teams in the
league are young, thev already are

providing tough competition. Ihe
Stanford team now has more oppor
tunities to play collegiate sides in
order to better prepare for regionals
and nationals.
Not only will this help the Stan
ford team to prepare for the play
offs, but this is a huge step for
women's collegiate rugby. The re
sponse from all the teams has been
outstanding. Women's rugby is one
of the fasted growing collegiate
sports having added 23 teams last
year, for a total of 22N in the nation,
and more forming this year.
The top two teams from the new
Northern California league will go
on to the Pacific Coast playoffs
which leads to the National tourna
ment. The National tournament has
been divided into two divisions, the
cup and the plate. Last year the Pa
cific Coast was slated to play in the
plate division, rather than the more
competitive cup division. The for
mation of the new league will help
Northern California teams get
stronger and hopefully earn a birth
into the cup division.
The Stanford women's rugby
team hopes to again make a strong
showing at the National tourna
ment. Last year's team posted a
third-place finish in the plate divi
sion and the team has aspirations of
bettering that performance.
Stanford next plays Humboldt
St. at New Maloney Stadium on Sat
urday at II a.m.
"We're excited to have a better
collegiate schedule and now its time
to get it on," said junior winger
Stephanie Reigg.
