WOMEN'S RUGBY
■ SATURDAY'S RESULT: Stan
ford 29. S;in Diego Surfers (lub 5
■ SUNDAY'S RESULT: Stanford
42, UC-San Diego 0

The team traveled to San Diego
over the weekend where they en
joyed not only adding two vietories
to their record, hut a break from the
Stanford rain and a chance to bask in
the Southern California sun.
The Stanford women's rugby
team competed once Saturday
against the San Diego Surfers club
team and again Sunday against
tJC-San Diego. Stanford defeated
the Surfers by a score of 29-5, and
then beat UC'SD 42-0. Stanford
head coach Franck Hoivert was
pleased with the quick style of play
which Stanford took into the
games.
"Stanford played quicker than
the opposition." Hoivert said.
" I hit is our philosophy of play, es

pecially when Stanford is generally
a smaller team than much of the op
position."
Coach Boivert said that Sunday's
game against I J("SD was highlighted
by the team's quick offensive reposi
tioning. This allowed Stanford to ex
ploit the poor defensive reorganiza
tion of the Tritons. By creating over
laps of excessive attackers on multi
ple-phase balls, Stanford was able to
break through the defense.
There are points to work on as
well. Coach Boivert said that the
negative was that Stanford had too
many turnovers and ball handling
errors, especially in the UCSD
game.
"The team lost interest, intensity
and concentration at the end of the
IJCSD game," Boivert said.
Boivert said that this could have
been the result of a long weekend of
multiple games, and also because
the team does not have many re
serves at the moment. The inability
to have many substitutions over a
weekend of games may prove to be a
handicap for Stanford when it comes
time for the playoffs, which general
ly have multiple games scheduled
over a single weekend.
Coach Boivert was particularly
pleased with the play o! sophomore
flyhalf Janet Lewis.
