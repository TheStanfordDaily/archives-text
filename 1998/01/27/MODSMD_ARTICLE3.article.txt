# Report attacks cost of higher education
## Hoover fellow on national commission examining issue 
### T.J. Babbitt Staff writer 
Stanford's footprints are all over
a new report to Congress from the
National Commission on the Cost of
Higher Education.
Congress charged the commis
sion last August with the task of find
ing ways to keep higher education
affordable. The main conclusions of
the report were made public last
week.
Some of the most strongly word
ed recommendations in the report
were first made in a speech to the
commission last October by Univer

sity President Gerhard Casper, in
which he attacked the layers of "ir
rational" regulations that the federal
government imposes on universities.
He said that the federal government
should drastically reduce its regula
tory and administrative role in high
er education, a position that the re
port echoes.
Stanford also had a direct voice, if
not an official spokesperson, on the
11-member commission. Rep. Newt
CJingrich. R-(ia.. appointed Hoover
Institution Senior Fellow Martin
Anderson — who served as a do
mestic policy adviser to Presidents
Nixon and Reagan — to the panel.

Congressional leaders of both par
lies and Secretary of Education
Richard Riley appointed other
members.
Anderson emphasized Casper's
influence on the commission's re
port.
"When the president spoke on
the issue of regulatory costs. I think
it had a real effect on how the com
mission looked at the issue," he said.
As examples of regulatory over
load. Casper cited the large amount
of paperwork created bv following
government health and safety regu
iations and the costs ol updating
physical facilities to comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
II those costs were not imposed,
( asper said. Stanford might be able
to lower its tuition rates.
At the same commission meet
ing. Anderson suggested that Con
gress should "deregulate" universi
ties in the same way that telephone
companies and airlines had been
deregulated.
"If you and I were in ( ongress, I
would vote for your bill," Casper
told Anderson.
The new report preserves this
emphasis on deregulation as well. In
its most specific section of recom
mendations. it cites several of what it
calls burdensome federal regula
tions and procedures, ranging from
the way federal student loans are
made to a newly imposed law that
requires universities to report finan
cial information about students and

their parents to the Internal Rev
enue Service.
On the subject of environmental
and safety regulations, the report
calls lor "dilferential regulation of
industrial facilities ... and research
and training facilities. Presumably,
the requirements lor academic facil
ities would be weaker.
"()ver the last 10 to 20 years a lot
o! | health and saletyj laws have
been passed largely with large cor
porations in mind," said Anderson.
Hut should the same rules apply to
teaching in a chemistry laborato
ry?"
The committee's main recom
mendations were that government
regulations be reduced and that uni
versities should seek tocontrol costs
through aggressive internal mea
sures. Anderson said that the latest
data seems to indicate that this has
been happening.
" I he net cost of higher education
was increasing very rapidly in the
late I9NOs and early 19905," he said.
"But the rate of increase has dra
matically slowed. If you look at the

new data, you can come to no other
conclusion than that universities are
now controlling costs."
Stanford's tuition increases have
followed the same trend, peaking at
9.5 percent in 1992 but hovering
around4or 5 percent in the last four
years.
I he commission was unable to
reach any conclusions about contro
versial issues such as trends in facul
ty workload and compensation,
tenure policies, class size and facul
ty-to-student ratios and how these
issues relate to the cost of education.
The final report simply avoids these
issue by saying that universities
should examine their own policies to
determine what works best for their
particular needs
Anderson downplayed media
speculation last week that the re
port. initially scheduled for release
in December, had been delayed due
to the inability of commission mem
bers to agree on the language of the
final report. He said the report had
been held back largely because of
delays in assembling data.
