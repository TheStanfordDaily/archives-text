### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
A number of Stanford track and
field athletes kicked off the 1998 sea
son in fine fashion at both the Na
tional Pole Vault Summit and Silver
State Indoor Invitational this week
end in Reno. Nev.
Highlighting the weekend was
the performance of Adam Connolly.
The senior hammer thrower estab
lished a new Reno Stadium and
Stanford school record with a dis
tance of 69-11 in the 35-pound
weight. In just the first competition
of the season. Connolly's record
throw has already automatically
qualified him for the 1998 NCAA
Track and Field Championships.
Provisionally qualifying for the
NCAA meet were Cardinal pole
vaulters Toby Stevenson and Melis
sa Feinstein. The sophomore
Stevenson had a vault of 17-2 while
Feinstein, a freshman, vaulted 11-9
in the meet.
Sophomore Tracye Lawyer, who
is also a standout on the women's
soccer team, placed first in the high
jump, clearing 5-7 3/4. Freshman

Todd Beyerlein tied for third in the
same event with a jump of 6-9.
Women's Golf: Tim Baldwin,
head coach of the Stanford women's
golf team from 1979-96, will be in
ducted into the National Golf
Coaches Hall of Fame Wednesday.
The ceremony will take place at the
National Golf Coaches Convention
in Orlando, Fla.
After a 17-year stint as women's
head coach, Baldwin was named
Coach emeritus last year. He was
named the 1996 Pacific 10 Confer
ence Coach of the Year, the first
time a Stanford women's golf coach
ever received the honor. His 1995-96
squad notched eight top-five finish
es, including a second-place finish at
the PING / ASIJ Invitational.
In his 17 years on The Farm, he
led the Cardinal to 15 NCAA Tour
nament appearances, including
eight consecutive from 1988-95. His
1995 and 1992 teams finished in
fourth place, both best-ever finishes
by a Cardinal women's golf team.
Baldwin has coached nine Ail-
Americans, 12 All-Conference play
ers and seven Pac-10 All-Academic
team members.
