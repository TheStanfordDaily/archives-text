# University may run Alumni Association
## 
### Evan Nordby Contributing writer 
The Stanford Alumni Association may
become a part of the University by this
fall, ending a century of independence.
Founded by the first graduating class in
1892, the Alumni Association has operat
ed since as an independent corporation,
delivering programs such as Travel Study
and Stanford Sierra Camp to alumni.
Now. a task force made up of Board of
Trustees members and Alumni Associa
tion board members, plus a senior class
president and a faculty member, is cur
rently studving the issue of "integration."

The task force hopes to present a tentative
agreement to the lull Board of Trustees at
the board's February meeting, for ap
proval by the end of spring.
"We're looking at merging the talents
of the Alumni Association with the re
sources of the University ■. • building on
the successes of the independent associa
tion." said task force staff member and
Vice President of Development John
Ford.
"It's one of the best alumni associa
tions."
Ford said that in the past, both the Uni
versity and the Alumni Association had
felt limited bv their lack of connection.

"It is a bit of an odd structure," said
Ford, adding that many alumni don't real
ize the two are separate entities. "The as
sociation has been limited by the amount
of money it could raise on its own. and the
University might not have invested as
much in alumni relations."
The University offered similar reason
ing three years ago for the merger of the
Alumni Association-produced Stanford
magazine and the University News Ser
vice-produced Stanford Observer. The
Observer now appears as the "Stanford
Today" section of the magazine, which is
no longer editorially independent of the
University.

At the time of the magazine merger ir
1995. University Communications Direc
tor Terry Shepard said the new forma
would be less confusing to alumni. wh(
didn't understand that different organiza
tions produced each publication.
Three years later, the Alumni Associa
tion itself faces a loss of independence
According to Ford and association Fresi
dent Bill Stone, the goal of the proposec
merger is to serve alumni better and tc
help them become more involved with the
University.
Stone noted that according to survevs
around 90 percent of alumni were
very happy with their Stanford ex
perience. The merger, the Universi
ty hopes, will encourage alumni to
remain connected to the University
and help provide the same positive
experience to future students. Stone
mentioned several alumni pro

grams, including volunteering, re
cruiting and annual giving.
Both Ford and Stone acknowl
edged the relationship between con
tinued alumni connection to a uni
versity and their monetary support
of the university.
"It definitely is a bv-product.
Alumni who feel more connected
tend to give." said Ford.
1 hey denied, however, that the
move was strictly financially moti

vated.
Since University President Ger
hard C asper arrived in ] 993. the Uni
versity has taken a number of steps
to increase annual alumni giving.
Though the annual rate of donations
has risen from 22 percent to 34 per
cent in that time, it is still far below
the 50 percent to 55 percent giving
rates of Stanford s Ivy League rivals.
That is one factor but not the onl\
one. said Stone.
