The Stanford Alumni Association may
become a part of the University by this
fall, ending a century of independence.
Founded by the first graduating class in
1892, the Alumni Association has operat
ed since as an independent corporation,
delivering programs such as Travel Study
and Stanford Sierra Camp to alumni.
Now. a task force made up of Board of
Trustees members and Alumni Associa

The task force hopes to present a tentative
agreement to the lull Board of Trustees at

of money it could raise on its own. and the
University might not have invested as
much in alumni relations."
The University offered similar reason
ing three years ago for the merger of the
Alumni Association-produced Stanford
magazine and the University News Ser
vice-produced Stanford Observer. The
Observer now appears as the "Stanford
Today" section of the magazine, which is
no longer editorially independent of the
University.

At the time of the magazine merger ir
1995. University Communications Direc
tor Terry Shepard said the new forma
would be less confusing to alumni. wh(
didn't understand that different organiza
tions produced each publication.
Three years later, the Alumni Associa
tion itself faces a loss of independence
According to Ford and association Fresi
dent Bill Stone, the goal of the proposec
merger is to serve alumni better and tc
help them become more involved with the
University.
Stone noted that according to survevs
