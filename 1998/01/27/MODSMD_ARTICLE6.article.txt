# Melt in your mouth
## Senior wins year's supply of M&Ms 
### Krista Glaser Contributing writer 
Imagine opening a bag of McV: M
candies and discovering that
you've won a year's supply of those
bite-si/ed chocolates that "melt in
your mouth and not in your hand."
What would you do?
Senior Anne linger is currently
facing this very predicament.
"If I see another M&M. I'm
going to die." I 'nger said. "They're
coming out of my ears."
Last summer, Unger found the
pri/e-winning gray M&Ms in her
bag during the Impostor M&Ms
Contest while on a visit to Seattle.
"I was sick as a dog," com
plained I Jnger. who had contracted
mononucleosis and strep throat.
"My mom said, 'We're going to
make Anne feel better' so she rent
ed 'Out of Africa" and bought me
my favorite canities, including a
huge bag of almond M&Ms."
Unger said she opened the bag
to find gray M&Ms and wondered

if the company had produced a new
color.
"1 opened the Peel and see if
you won' sticker and saw that I won
first prize... a year's supply of
M&Ms," linger said.
The year's supply of M&Ms
does not mean Unger can eat all
the M&Ms she wants in the next
year. Actually. I 'nger received 365
coupons for the 50 cent M&M
bags, redeemable at any store sell
ing the candy.
"The first time I redeemed the
coupons was at the Safeway in
Mountain View." Unger ex
plained. "Everyone heard from the
cashier about my year's supply and
came over to see me. Later, a ran
dom guy in my apartment who was
actually at Safeway saw me unload
ing my groceries and said, 'You're
the one who won a year's supply of
M&Ms!"
I Inger proceeded to hand the
man a bag of M&Ms.
