Think
about it.
v ii
Think about joining a company where
anyone with a good idea can change
things. Where you'll be involved with
an impressive breadth of technology,
from the O* desktop workstation to
Cray supercomputers, and encouraged to
take risks. Where creativity is paramount,
and the technology spans from interactive
3D graphics, digital media, RISC
microprocessors and scalable shared
memory multiprocessing.
The company is Silicon Graphics.
Catch us on campus.
