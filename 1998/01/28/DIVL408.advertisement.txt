MERCER
Management Consulting
More than anything, Mercer's
corporate climate' has made this
summer an amazing experience.
The friendliness and non
hierarchical structure of the
people here create an environment
which fosters teamwork,
creativity, and enthusiasm. At
the same time though, the people
here retain a distinct air of
professionalism and
intellectualism which helps push
you into new ways of thinking. "
