School of Business sweatshirt.
Gates discussed his business
strategy and outlined some of the
changes he thought technology
would bring in a half-hour talk
sponsored by the Business
School's View from the Top and
Public Management Initiative
programs.
"We're really just at the be
ginning of the information age,"
Gates said. "It's going to reshape
not only how companies work,
but the way people learn, the
way people work and the way
people buy things."
"The very mechanism of capi
talism will be changed by having
this wealth of information that
will be out there."

The path that led Gates from
founding Microsoft with Paul
Allen in 1975 to becoming the
world's richest man 20 years
later was due to a mix of luck and
successfully anticipating changes
in the industry, he said.
In starting the company that
has come to dominate the soft
ware industry. Gates had no
more of an idea than anyone else
how information technology
would flourish. However, he
said, he did suspect that software
would be important and that spe
cialization was necessary within
the industry.
Failure to specialize has led to
the demise of more than one
company, Gates said, most no
tably Digital Equipment Corp.,
which Compaq Computer Corp.
bought this week.
"When I grew up. the really
cool computers were computers
from Digital Equipment," Gates
remembered. "They should have
been the company that led the

PC revolution, but they didn't
foresee it."
Not even Microsoft can let
down its guard, he said.
"Microsoft is in the best posi
tion ol any technology company,
but by no means is it in a secure
position." Gates said. "And that's
what makes it fun. We come into
work every day knowing we could
destroy the company."
One of the trends in computing

that Microsoft did miss was the
quick growth of the Internet,
Gates admitted. As a result, the
company has had to plav catch-up
with Netscape Communications
Corp. for dominance of the World
Wide Web browser market. Mi
crosoft is currently undergoing a
Justice Department investigation
of alleged antitrust violations re
lated to packaging its browser with
standard Windows operating sys
tem software.
The investigation is not keeping
Microsoft from continuing with
development of its next version of

Windows. Gates said. He argued
that separating Microsoft's Inter
net Explorer from Windows soft
ware would "cripple" the product.
Hut the main challenge to Mi
crosoft and other software compa
nies is to make their products
more user-friendly. Gates said.
"I'm painting a very optimistic
picture here." he said. "I'm the
first to admit the software industry
isn't making things as easy as it
should .... We get error messages
that even we don't know what they
mean."
In addition to eliminating bugs.

Microsoft will he working to ad
vance technology in forms such as
voice recognition, Gates said.
Stanford graduates are likely to
play a role in lhat development as
they did in the formation of Mi
crosoft, he added.
Ciates had to lure his current
vice president, Steve Ballmer,
from the Stanford Business School
for guidance on managing the
growing company. He and
Ballmer met while undergradu
ates at Harvard, where they took a
class from current Stanford Busi
ness School Dean Mike Spenee.
