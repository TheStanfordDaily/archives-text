IRS to enter new era
WASHINGTON (AP) — As
the Senate begins work on
restructuring the Internal Rev
enue Service, the agency's new
commissioner is ordering its
biggest overhaul in 45 years.
The reorganization will focus
the IRS on serving taxpayers'
needs, officials said yesterday.
Under the plan. IRS Commis
sioner Charles (). Rossotti would
reorganize the agency into "tax
payer service organizations"
devoted to four categories: indi
vidual taxpayers: small businesses
and the self-employed; large cor
porations; and pension plans, non

profits ;iikl state and local govern
ments.
Rossotti is scheduled to unveil
the plan during testimony today
before the Senate Finance Com
mittee.
The announcement shows the
Clinton administration taking the
initiative in proposing major
changes at the IKS before Senate
Republicans begin reworking an
IRS overhaul bill that passed the
I louse in November.
Next week, the National Per
formance Review. Vice President
Al Gore's "reinventing govern
ment" group, will release a
detailed report on IRS restructur
ing.
A key principle of the effort,
billed as '"modernizing Ameri
ca's tax agency." would have the
IRS better "understand and
solve problems from a taxpayer's
point of view," according to an
IRS briefing paper. Officials
briefed on the plan described it
as conceptual, with details left
for later.
I he changes would scrap the
current division ol the IRS into
the various functions ol the tax
collection process, such as exami
nation. collection and appeals.
