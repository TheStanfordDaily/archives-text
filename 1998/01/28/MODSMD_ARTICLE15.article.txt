Men's hoops" spectacular
start deserves the attention
of the Stanford community

STANFORD MEN S basketball we
salute you. Off to the best start in the
school's history, you are the IK-0
bomb.
Despite the hoopla that surrounded
Brevin Knight's departure last year, you
have shown you are a "team" that can win
without him.
Despite the skeptics who felt you were
undeserving of a top-10 ranking, you
spanked then No. 9 UCLA.
Despite a 72-71 score in the closing sec
onds against Washington this past Satur
day, you sank a three-pointer for the win.
Clearly, you crushed the Weenies.
With a pre-season No. 14 ranking, you
are now ranked No. 5 in the nation in one
poll. No. 4 in the other.
It seems that the nation is noticing. But
we want Stanford students to notice, Stan

ford faculty to notice and Stanford staff to
notice. T his is history in the making.
For several years, men's basketball has
been in the shadow of the very deserving
women's team. Although the men have
consistently made it to the NCAA tourna
ment, and even appeared in their first
sweet-16 last season, the team's glory was
a dim light burning in the flame of the
women's final-four games.
It's your turn now, and you deserve it.
A Stanford men's basketball team has
never started the season with a better than
13-0 record, until this year's 18-0 domi
nance.
In fact, a Stanford men's basketball
team has never won IS games in a row at
any point in the season, until now. And.it
hasn't been since the 1962-63 season that a
Stanford men's basketball team enjoyed a
national ranking as high as No. 4.
At 7-0 in the Pac-10 Conference and
tied for first place with Arizona, here's
hoping that the Wildcats feel the bomb
explode tomorrow night; it's time to
knock off yet another skeptic of Stanford
success.
