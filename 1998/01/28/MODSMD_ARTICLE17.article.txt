Don V condone Clinton
Kerry Rodgers' Jan. 26 column is outra
geously moronic. To offer any excuse for
Clinton's pattern of repeatedly arrogant,
immoral and illegal behavior is completely
absurd.
Her refusal to condemn Clinton's
actions is ironically self-righteous; it is based
on the idea that we are all fallible, and that
therefore "the rest of the world needn't butt
in." On the contrary, this scandal is an
important public issue for several reasons.
First. Clinton's admission of a 12-year
affair with Gennifer Flowers shows that his
sexual indiscretion is not an occasional
yielding to temptation. (Not to mention the
countless other women who are alleged to
have fooled around with Clinton, including
former White House staffer Kathleen
Wiley.) Even if Rodgers' figures are accu
rate (50 percent of married people have
cheated on their spouses), it does not follow
that we cannot condemn the long-term
behavior patterns of misogynists like Clin
ton.
He orchestrated a long-term deception
of his family and constituents — a decep

tion that Rodgers ridiculously equates with
speeding. To err is human, hut to systemat
ically deceive ;ind exploit is deplorable.
Second, Rodgers ignores the extraordi
nary circumstances of the Monica Lewinsky
allegations. This is not a clear cut matter of
"consenting adults." Instead, it is alleged
that the most powerful and famous man in
the world received oral sex from a 21-year
old intern. He is a married 50-year-old. This
is her first job out of college. She is imma
ture, infatuated and vulnerable. He is her
boss. How can Rodgers, a feminist, fail to
see that the sexual activity in question is
purely a matter of power and exploitation?
It is a one-way transaction, designed for the
pleasure of the recipient. The imbalance of
power is shocking. Decent people do not
exploit the vulnerable.
The special circumstances of these alle
gations make this much more significant
than the Flowers scandal. If the Wipes prove
true, the American public will have cause to
be horrified.
Third, Rodgers fails to consider that
human progress seeks to control "animal
instincts" for the benefit of all. Civic life
provides structure and protection so that we
are not victimized by Hobbesian beasts. In

one of her most ridiculous statements,
Rodgers posits the possibility that "in our
natural state humans live and love commu
nally." What natural state is that? Pre-civi
lization? Perhaps the same "natural state"
in which a person can kill another in order
to steal his property without any repercus
sions? Sounds great, Kerry!
The argument that our animal instinct
tempts us to have multiple partners is not
an excuse for infidelity, just as rage is not an
excuse for murder. It is not too much to ask
that our leaders not be ruled by their
instincts, but uphold their vows and be
ruled by reason.
Finally. Rodgers irresponsibly appropri
ates the very worthy and fascinating work
of Biology Prof. Sapolsky to support her
ridiculous pontifieations. To dismiss Clin
ton as an alpha male is to ignore the
progress of feminism and of civilization, in
general.
As Robert Wright said in the Feb. 2 issue
of I ime. "if there is anyone whose job it is
to symbolize our aspirations for further
progress, to refrain from the naturally self
indulgent use of power, it's the president of
the United States. Especially, perhaps, a
president who is liberal and thus holds that

the privileged shouldn't exercise their vari
ous appetites untrammeled."

Redefining repression
Vanessa Bartsch's article "Shaving the
Shameful Purity Test Score" is written in
fun and relatively good humor. Yet it has a
subtle manipulative undertone, that per
haps reading one too many books by Naomi
Wolf, makes it difficult to overlook.
There is a fine line between ridding a
friend of repressive shackles and being
repressive in doing so.
To liberate a "spirit longing to be free" is
to open up options and possibilities rather
than to impose pressure. Especially a pres
sure that suggests this woman's highest
freedom is measured in love bites rather
than. say. the creativity of her mind.
"Sex sells" is not a statement of the obvi
ous. except in America. As a nation, we've
chosen to strip the meaning and beauty out
of sexuality, cheapened it by writing articles
to "grab a piece of the action."
If we were to take a step hack, and look

at our country, where every comedian, pop
song. I V news broadcast and sitcom has
some sexual undertone, we might find our
selves shocked by our excesses.
Will we buy into it, conform to the
rhetoric, or (hopefully) ... question its
superficiality?
