## Pondering the untold stories 
### 
SO IT'S 3:01 A.M.,
one of my favorite
times of the day.
It has many high points.
First, it's late enough that
no one's usually awake
enough to bother you.
Second, by this point.

you've usually overcome the first wave of
sleepiness, propelling you into a productive
period.
Third, small joys you'd miss during the
day get magnified into big joys. Like a real
ly hot cup of tea, that causes your gut to
glow and your head to settle. Or a cigarette,
which can put you into a nice pensive state.
So you might be wondering why I'm still
awake.
I've been dwelling on what to write in
this column for a while. There's still way
too much for me to say. I was arrogant
enough, walking into this, to think that I'd
be able to say my piece in the time allotted.
Ha.
There are still a lot of things that will go
untold.
For example, amusing drug stories told
in homage to Hunter S. Thompson.
My expose on the true connection
between graduate students and bike hel
mets.
I'll have to permanently shelve my plans
to reveal our student government for what
it really is: a bunch of over-politicized
freaks who use petty conspiracies and

power-plays to justify their pathetic exis
tence. Or wait, was that the ASSU? 1 keep
forgetting.
I have a feeling that rallying the campus
to protest those damn little plastic rings the
CoHo makes you wear if you drink alcohol
isn't going to happen.
And, tragically, I won't get a chance to
promote my ultimate dream — installing
bumper boats in M;iin Ouad.
Now. it may sound like I'm just being
flippant and silly.
That's about right, as a matter of fact.
This school has a lot of problems. If
there's been one consistent theme to what
I've written, it's that.
But let me tell you — the one thing I've
learned over the course of writing this is
that just saying so isn't worth much.
People don't want to hear about it.
There are those who just have their heads
up their asses. There are others who just
don't care. And there are plenty who think
they have enough problems to justify not
hearing about Stanford's anymore.
Besides: it isn't very catchy or interest
ing to point out real problems.
That's especially true given our venue of
choice. If I wanted to get your attention, I
should have written about that person I
can't write about, preferably in violent
terms. Or talked openly about my sex life.
Or told a lot of lies to get other people in
trouble.
I turned on the television today to find

Miehael McCurry boring the pants off the
White House Press Staff with a press con
ference about the president's plans to see a
movie sometime over the weekend. It was
broadcast on all three networks as a live
special report, merely because some people
think the president might have lied about
having sex with someone.
Turning that off, I noticed that the
Unabomber was on page one of the San
Jose Mercury News. He and his lawyers
had decided, instead of enduring another
ridiculously publicized trial, that he would
just go to jail. If the public remains fasci
nated with his murderous impulses, they'll
have to watch him behind bars.
Turning away from that, I noticed the
pile of Entertainment Weeklies, Rolling
Stones, funny pages and television guides
sitting on our coffee table. The national
pages for the past two days sat untouched
elsewhere.
Plenty of circuses. Unfortunately, we
happen to be out of bread.
So you'll ask me what I'm doing here.
Holding up this lamppost.
Flipping this quarter.
Trying to make up my mind.
If it's heads. I'll go to Tennessee.
Tails, I'll buy a drink.
And if it lands on the edge,
I'll keep talking to you.

Eric Bauer is, was ami will he a
student in computer science. Good luck.
