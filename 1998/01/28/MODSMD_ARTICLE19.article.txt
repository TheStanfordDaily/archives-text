## Tomoeh Murakami Jailed by ring of the cellular phone 
### 
I HATE MY new cellular phone. It's the
biggest nightmare. When I first took the
palm-sized, air-light, snazzy little pearl
pink machine out of its box a few weeks ago,
I thought it would make life a lot more
organized and convenient in this busy, hec
tic city of Tokyo. Or so everyone had con
vinced me.
"I can't believe you haven't gotten one
yet!" My friends all echoed their disbelief
when they heard I didn't possess this "daily
life necessity."
"How can you possibly get by these days
without at least one cellular?" they said. In
Japan some people seem to have two or
even three of these portable phones, effi
ciently using one for business, one for per
sonal use and the third one solely for mak
ing calls as it has a cheaper calling rate.
"You know, it's kind of social manners to
have one," one friend lectured. "You're just
about the toughest person to get a hold of,
think how frustrated people are when they
call you at home and get your answering
machine? In this age. where timing is every
thing, you really could be missing out on a
world of opportunities, you know."
So I joined the club, and the nightmare
began. Although many things about the cel
lular phone bug me, I most despise the fact
that it now makes me accessible 24 hours a
day; all it takes is a simple punch of a 10-
digit number, and absolutely anyone is
guaranteed to get a hold of me.

"Hey, where are you? Good, you're still
close by — do you mind swinging hack (to
work) for a little hit? We could use some
extra help after all."
This has heen the most popular message
I receive on my cellular, and I often find
myself heading back to the office even
though I'd just left. My phone is not exactly
ringing with glamorous offers nor is it bring
ing me new opportunities.
What's worse, the cellular is not making
my social life any better either.
It may seem like the ideal tool. Friends
can get a hold of you wherever you may be
and invite you to join the action. Hut for the
most part, all my cellular phone has done is
cause social frustration. Now people call
and inform me of "a sudden change in
plans."
For example, I was waiting for friends in
front of a bookstore, when the phone rang.
We had arranged a few days ago to spend
the evening together. One of my friends
rang me five minutes after he was due to
arrive and told me he was running a bit late.
"I'm still at the library," said the apolo
getic voice on the other end of the line, "it's
taking a bit longer than I thought to finish
up this paper.
Do you mind finding a cafe or something
and waiting for a while? Call me and let me
know where you are, and I'll be right over as
soon as I'm done, okay?"
Someone beeped in. A sinking feeling

took over as I recognized my other friend's
cellular number on my phone's little green
screen. When I answered, she told me what
I had already guessed — she was also run
ning a bit late; in fact, she said she might not
be able to make it at all. but that she'd keep
me updated.
This was not the first time I felt stupid for
having rushed to make an appointment. I
miss the good old days when people had to
call me at home the night before to let me
know if our plans looked doubtful. At least
that way. you could plan ahead and rear
range your own schedule accordingly.
Now. due to my increased accessibility,
calling is possible right up to the last minute,
and I dread these last minute ditchings and
apologies the phone makes possible.
I have come to see my cellular as an ever
demanding machine that tracks me down,
anywhere, anytime, and deprives me of my
space, free time and privacy. It has even
taken away the simple pleasure of wander
ing aimlessly on a short walk.
Now, the sharp ring of the phone can be
counted upon to shatter the calm and peace
and drag me back to reality.
It must also be mentioned that it's not
always so useful to be able to get a hold of
people with ease.
No longer can one lightly say. "I'll give
you a ring sometime." To say you'll call has
become a commitment bigger than you
could possibly have imagined.

Whenever I receive a business card,
there are a bunch of numbers on it.
"That's my work number. Here's my
home number. I rv me there first: it I'm not
there, call me at this number, and if the
line's busy and you can't reach me there, it 'll
give you a different number to reach me at.
Oh. and it for some weird reason, you can't
reach me, that's the beeper number at the
bottom here, and I should give you a call
right back." Whew.
I'll admit that sometimes. I just want to
leave a quick, simple direct message on
someone's answering machine rather than
catching him/her and going through the
"hey, how are-you-how's-it-going-lately"s.
But the fact that people are reachable 24
hours a day does not allow me to do this
anymore.
Absolutely everyone walks around with
a phone. The sound of ringing and heeping
is the first thing I hear whenever I'm in pub
lic. be it on the subway trains, or at restau
rants. amusement parks and movie theaters.
They're ringing left and right, you just can
not go a minute without hearing people
loudly talking into their miniature phones.
New types and models are continuously
coming out. and they all offer a variety of
noises so that your rings can be distin
guished from the other ones. The entire
nation is a whirlwind of rings, from the tra
ditional "Brrring! Brrring!" to super-unique
electronic sounds similar to TV-game-like

IJFO noises to sounds of dogs barking.
I'm sure I'm not the only one that's going
crazy.
So. did the cellular phone — which
comes complete with clock, address b<x>k,
calendar and schedule book features
make my life more convenient? I must say it
did not.
So far. all my cellular has given me is a
huge phone bill. Because I have if on me all
the time. I no longer use my discount calling
cards nor take the time to find a public
phone. Worse yet. I even find my la/y self
using it in my own room to save the trouble
of getting up and walking over to the regular
phone. The jacked up prices of the cellular
calls were an unforeseen side effect that is
infringing on my financial freedom as well.
Taking my cellular with me everywhere I
go has become a duty I dread: the little
phone rests heavily on my shoulders as a
huge responsibility. I shudder every time it
rings, knowing I cannot ignore it.
I have reached the conclusion that the
whiny machine is far t<h» demanding and
rather restricting than it is helpful and use
ful. I can go on and on about the horrors of
the cellular phone. Hut I must go now. as I
think I hear my phone quacking.
