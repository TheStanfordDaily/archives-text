### Saurabh Prakash Staff writer 
Affirmative action critic Dinesh
D'Souza presented his controversial
views last night before an audience
of more than 1(K) in Kresge Audito
rium in a speech entitled "Racism Is
Not the Problem: The Rise and Fall
of Racism in the West."
His talk, which is part of a five
day visit to the Stanford area, pro
voked strong responses from listen
ers during his speech and in a subse
quent question and-answer session.
Differences in cultural skills be
tween racial groups, not racism, are
the primary determinants of educa
tional and economic inequality, he

said.
Racism, while still present in
America, is not endemic enough to
account for economic and social in
equalities. he explained.
"I don't deny the existence of
racism," D'Souza said. "But does it
have the power it once did?"
D'Souza instead posited that
"merit produces inequality between
groups." Asians and whites, he said,
are more successful than Hispanics
or blacks by almost any academic or
economic measure because as a
groups they have resilient family
structures, stronger work ethic and
greater drive.
"The whole debate is not about
whether merit produces inequality

but why," D'Souza said. "The root
cause of group inequality lies in ...
the educational area."
As practiced, affirmative action
unfairly penalized qualified Asians
and whites to give a leg up to less
qualified Hispanics and blacks,
D'Souza said.
Under the principle of merit,
some runners in a sprint are going to
win, D'Souza said. Affirmative ac
tion compensates those who came to
the race with fewer skills by rigging
the race so that they start closer to
the finish line, he added.
"Equality of rights would let you
come to the race ... but it would not
let you get a medal." D'Souza said.
"If differences are due to factors that

can be changed, let's focus our ef
forts on changing them."
Policies which give disadvan
taged racial groups the cultural tools
to succeed are the appropriate re
sponse to economic and social in
equality, D'Souza said.
"Even if you as a victim are not to
be blamed for being knocked down,
you are responsible for getting up."
he said.
Several students criticized
D'Souza for not offering a practical
alternative to affirmative action. He
clarified that he was not against all
types of affirmative action.
Socio-economic based affirma
tive action is more justifiable than
race-based policies, he said.
