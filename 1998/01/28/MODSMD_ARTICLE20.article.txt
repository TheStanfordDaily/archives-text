## Rob, Va and Mr. T: Preparing for pros 
### 
In the wake of the Super Howl
(did yon hike The Quiz?) Vanessa
and I deeided lo discuss some of the
more interesting aspects we noticed
about the world of professional
sports.
Kohin: Vanessa, I feel I'm a little
too articulate to become a profes
sional athlete. Are you apprehen
sive about the prospect of becom
ing a professional athlete?
Va: Well sometimes I do feel a lit
tle too articulate for the profes-

sion.
Kohin: Aside from allowing your
vocabulary to deteriorate, what
else do you plan to do in order to
prepare yourself for the profes
sional ranks?
Va: Well. I've conveniently come
up with a list.
Kohin: I can barely contain myself.
Do tell
Va: No. 1. I'm in search of a per
sonal jeweler to forge my hubcap
sized No. 13 that I'll wear on a big
gold chain around my neck.
Kohin: Does that mean Mr. T is a
professional athlete?
Va: Yes, in French-speaking
provinces of Canada. Secondly,
I'm also getting used to wearing
shades indoors because fluores
cent lights are really bright. I'd also
have to start going to a personal
stylist instead of getting a $7 hair
cut.
Kohin: I get mine for five, you're
getting ripped off. But what else?
Va: Fourth, I'm currently inter
viewing for members of my en
tourage.
Kohin: What are your prerequi
sites? Am I a candidate?
Va: Sadly, no. You either have to
he a distant cousin or have gone to
high school with me.
Kohin: Ibo bad you're not from
the South. Wecould've been relat

ed. Are there any difficulties
you've found in the transition?
Va: Yeah, I have this strange need
to say hello to my mother whenev
er I'm on camera, and I'm contem
plating getting my name and num
ber tattooed somewhere on my
body.
Kohin: What if I already have my
name tattooed on my body?
Va: A little too much information
for me. Let's move on. You also
have to have a trademark move
when you score. You know — the
Mile High Salute, Raise the Roof,

Lower the Floor. Stucco the Walls,
that sort of thing.
Kohin: Sounds complicated.
Va: It is. And lastly. Vanessa Ny
gaard is currently working to make
sure that Vanessa Nygaard refers
to Vanessa Nygaard as often as
possible in the third person.
Kohin: With the rise of women's
professional team sports, aside
from salary differences how do
you think men and women profes
sional athletes will be different?
Va: Are we having a serious dis
cussion now?
Kohin: Well, we could at least try.
Va: OK. then I'll pretend like I'm
in CIV section, and 1 haven't done
the reading. I always have lots to
say then. Starting with. "It seems
to mc like..." the fan-base for
women's athletics is not as big and
obsessive as men's professional
sports.
Kohin: Exactly what do you mean
by that?
Va: Let me extrapolate that point
for you. All guys have an opinion
on sports, no matter how unjusti
fied. For example, just this past
weekend while watching the Super
Bowl every guy in the room with
me felt he had to say something
about every plav and every penal

Nygaard
ty even though they were obviously
not athletes and probably never
played football in their lives. I mean,
who are you going to believe? The 5-
foot-4, 2(X) pound computer soft
ware engineer from Cal who just
couldn't get enough of the gua
camole or me—someone who's got
ten five concussions in the last three
years. 1 think I know more about
contact sports.
Robin: I agree with your point, but 1
also think it's worthy to mention that
most women don't follow sports.
I've noticed in my line of work that a
majority of women didn't grow up

around sports and as a result don't
have that obsessive, I-need-to
know-every-anal-fact-about-my-
team mentality. Most women don't
even understand the basic rules of
sports they've never played.
Va: Exactly. My mom doesn't even
know what a pick and roll is. My
sophomore year she actually asked
me, "When did you get good at that
shooting thing?"
Robin: Well, aside from your mom,
don't you think women are catching
up?
Va: Yes, can we end the column? I
have to relieve myself.

Vanessa has recently redirected her
career ambitions. She no longer
wishes to he a White House intern.
