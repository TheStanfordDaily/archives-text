Stanford assis
tiint coach Dana
Bible is moving
off the Farm and
into the Vet.
Bible, Stan
ford's 44-year
old offensive co
ordinator, is
headed to Veter-

ans Stadium after agreeing yester
day to lead the Philadelphia Eagles'
offense.
All eyes in Philadelphia were on
the Bay Area last week when Eagles
offensive coordinator Jon Gruden
was named head coach of the Oak
land Raiders. Looking for a coach to
continue Gruden's West Coast of
fense. the Eagles turned their heads

just across the Bay to Stanford and
focused on Bible, the ('ardinal's of
fensive coordinator of three years.
"Dana is a bright, young, ener
getic coach," said Philadelphia head
coach Ray Rhodes. "As I said short
ly after the season, if Jon were to
leave the Eagles, I wanted to make
sure we kept the same philosophies
of the West Coast offense and Dana
is certainly a student of it."
Bible will take his first steps as an
NFL coach early next month at the
Indianapolis scouting combine. "I'm
really excited about the opportunity
to join this organization," he said.
In leaving Stanford for the NFL.
Bible joins the ranks of Bill Walsh
and Dennis Green, both former Car
dinal coaches who left the school to
coach professionals. Like Walsh and
Green, Bible has aspirations of a
head coaching job, though his choice

to leave was not an easy one.
His family played a large part in
the decision. "We me included
have mixed emotions." Bible said. "I
think we appreciate w hat we're lea\
ing behind, and we leave that relue
tantlv.
" There's so mam ways Stanford
has impacted myself and my family.
Professionally, this has been a great
move, and my very best job in foot
ball."
"This is a tremendous loss for
Stanford University but a great op
portunity for Dana." said Cardinal
head coach Tyrone Willingham.
"We realize it was a difficult decision
for him. but at the same time were
honored that the tradition of Stan
ford University being a breeding
ground for NTT coaches continues.'
Prior to his tenure at Stanford.
Bible served as offensive coordina

tor of the University ol ( incinnat
and the quarterbacks eoach of th
( ineinnati Bengals. His lust year ;i
Stanford was a large success, as tin
Cardinal racked up 30.1 points pe
game, fusi in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. arid earned ;i berth in the I ib
erty Bowl.
I he 1997 season was not ;is kind
as the Cardinal's 25.1 points and
362.6 yards per game ranked eighth
in the Pac-10 ;md 60th in the nation.
The Eagles may have overlooked
those numbers in favor of Bible's fa
miliarity v\ith the West Coast of
fense and reputation as a great de
veloper ol quarterbacks. At Skin
fold. Bible helped turn quarterbacks
Mark Butterfield and Chad
Hutchinson into stars, and Philadel
phia is hoping he can do the same


Dana Bible
with second-year signal caller
Bobby Hoying.
"I loved playing for (Bible),"
Hutchinson said. "He's pretty
much the guy who developed me to

the guy 1 am now. I'm definitely
going to miss him."
Hoying should benefit under
Bible's wing in Philadelphia,
Hutchinson added. "Any good
coach will have an impact on a
young quarterback, and coach
Bible will have that effect on any
one he coaches."
