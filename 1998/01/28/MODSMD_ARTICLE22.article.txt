# Bears next for spikers
## Men travel to Berkeley for match with club team 
### Michaela Crouch Contributing writer 
The sixth-ranked and defending national
champion Stanford men's volleyball team
looks for victory tonight as it travels to
Berkeley to face the California Golden
Bears.
At Cal. men's volleyball is a club sport and
does not have varsity standing, therefore
tonight's match is not sanctioned by the
NCAA. The result will not affect the Cardi-

nal's record and is not supposed to have any
impact on postseason standings or play.
In the about 25 years that the two teams
have faced each other, usually twice per sea
son. Cal has never been able to defeat the
Cardinal, although there have been some
close matches.
Because of the status of today's match.
Stanford (3-0, 2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) will most likely attempt to get
those players who have not seen much action
to date some playing time.
"We have the luxury of approaching this
match differently than most of our others."
Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves said.
Junior outside hitter Chris Griffith, junior
middle blocker Jeremy Bart, freshman mid
dle blocker Dan Zhang and freshman setter

Brad Griffith will all probably get playing
time in tonight's match and will benefit great
ly if they are incorporated into the lineup.
Zhang and Brad Griffith have had ver\
limited minutes in Ibis season's matches and.
as freshmen, would both benefit from game
experience.
"Brad Griffith will be a factor at some
point in his time here." Nieves commented.
"We'd like to get him some time."
Senior middle blocker Keenan White
hurst and sophomore outside hitter And\
Witt will likely see limited action tonight
after missing last Saturday's match against
San Diego State. Whitehurst is in the process
of recovering from illness and W itt is recov
ering from a shoulder injury.
"There is no reason to rush Whitehurst
and Witt back." Nieves said. " I here is no ur
gency."
The main focus for these two players is a
Saturday return for the team's matchup with
14th-ranked Pacific.
Stanford will work to shut down Golden
Bear star senior outside hitter Pat Aparicio.
Aparicio is a player who could easil\ pla\
on a NCAA Division I squad, but rather
chose to attend a school where volleyball is a
club sport. If the Cardinal is unable to control
him. he has the ability to become a dominant
force in the match.
Last year. Stanford defeated Cal easily as
they held Aparicio's hitting percentage to
.208. Two years ago the match was much clos
er. as the Cardinal allowed Aparicio to be
come a factor.
