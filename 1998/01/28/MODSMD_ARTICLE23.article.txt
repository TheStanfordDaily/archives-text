Stanford boasts ()lympians, physics gurus, poets, peo
ple who can do the Rubik's cube really fast and the win
ner of a year's supply of M&Ms. Everyone here does
something special, but rarely does someone have a myri
ad of specialties.
Meet sophomore gymnast Kim Young.
Don't be fooled by her disarming smile or quiet voice:
she is hard eore.
Flash back to Young's summer before her freshman
year at Stanford. She had been training intensively in pur
suit of being in perfect shape. Her intensity stemmed
from her excitement at finally arriving on the Farm and
eompeting for the gymnastics team, her dream since she
was a child.
However, her training proved too much and she
overused her ankle, forcing her to miss her entire first
season. Young not only had to adjust to the transition to
college but she also had to deal with recovering from an
injury.
"For such an active person it was really frustrating.''
said Young. "It's also discouraging when your own body
is what holds you back.
Young was limited to working out on the Stairmaster
when her ankle permitted and cheering lor the team from
the sidelines.
Young watched the team compete in their first meet
and was heartbroken. Everything about her wanted to be
out on the floor competing while the crowd cheered her
name. Instead, she learned to contribute from the side
lines.
"Standing on the sidelines made me wiser." Young
said. "It taught me to appreciate gymnastics and not take
it for granted."
It was here that Young discovered her inner strength
and learned that she had the power to overcome obsta
cles when life didn't proceed as planned.
She wasn't fully recovered until last June when she
started training near her home in Colorado, again in an

tieipation of the fall w hen she would train with the ( ardi
nal and finally get her chance to compete at the collegiate
level.
()n Jan. If). Young finally got what she had been wait

ing two years for when Stanford competed against the
Washington 1 luskies.
"It was an ama/ing feeling competing with the team
and they all gave me so much support," oung said. "I
tried to relax because I know the season is a long h.iul and
I have many meets to get into my groove."
She competed on the bars (9.75). the fKx>r (9.25) and
beam (9.3). performing them all strongly especially con
sidering she hadn't competed in two years and had only
started training in June.
"Kim Young is a strong athlete," said head coach
Mark C\x>k. "She did great in all three events tor us "
Young's success in the first meet carried over to last
Friday's contest against Arizona State. She again com
peted in three events and was one of only two gymnasts
to land her beam routine. Despite high scores on the bars.
Young's favorite event is the fkx>r.
"It's an ama/ing feeling knowing you can captivate the
audience through your movements." said Young.
The path to the Stanford gymnastics team was not al
ways a sure one for Young. She has had to make man\
choices along the way â€” they come with the territory
when one is gtxxl at many things. After all. there are onK
so many hours in a day.
When she was four. Young chose to quit ballet and do
"real gymnastics." Then, at the age of ten. Young was the
Colorado state tennis champion but. chose to forgo her
tennis career and focus on gymnastics. In her junior year
of high schtxM. Young had the choice to quit school to try
to train for the ()lympics. Her club gymnastics teammates
all decided to quit schix>l and increased their training to
36 hours a week Young decided to stay in schix>l and
dropped down from the elite level of club gymnastics to
Level -10 where she trained 30 hours a week.
"At the time it was a really hard decision because I
wanted to be the best at gymnastics, and I was changing
what was important," Young said. "Hut it was the best
thing I have ever done because the friendships 1 have with
my teammates at Stanford is truly special. We support
