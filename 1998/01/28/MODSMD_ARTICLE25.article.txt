eDear Health Forum,
I am a sexually active
freshman and was won
dering if you could give
me some insight as to what are the
most common sexually transmit
ted diseases? I think it would be
beneficial for others to know as
well.

A Dear Reader.
Some of the most com
monly sexually transmit
ted diseases (STDs) are.
but not limited to, the following:
Herpes Simplex: Type I (non
genital) and Type II (genital).
Type I is commonly denoted by
cold sores around the mouth. It is
an inflammation of the skin caused
by the herpes virus that creates
groups of small, painful blisters.
Type II is usually found in the gen
ital area and can be passed from
person to person through sexual
contact, including oral sexual con
tact. Herpes often causes groups of
small, fluid-filled blisters to appear
on the skin and accompanying flu
symptoms are common. Because
herpes is a virus, symptoms can
only be treated, not cured.
Gonorrhea is an infectious dis
ease that is contracted from an in
fected partner during sexual inter
course and is caused by the gono
coccus bacterium. The incubation
period is two to lOdays. Symptoms
for both sexes include a burning
sensation during urination, with
males suffering from an irritation
of the penis and females
encing a .vaginal
Antibiotics are used for treatment.
Chlamydia is another infectious
disease transmitted via sexual con
tact. It is caused by the bacterium
chlamydia and, fortunately, is usu
ally found during a routine exam.
Undetected, this disease can lead

to infertility in females and can in
fect a newborn during birth. It is
also treated with antibiotics.
And probably the most infa
mous STD is Human Immunodefi
ciency Virus (HIV), the virus that
causes AIDS. HIV attacks the T
cell lymphocytes of the immune
system, making the body suscepti
ble to serious illnesses normally re
pelled by a healthy person. Cur
rently, three main groups appear
to be at risk: those engaging in un
protected sex, those sharing un
sterilized drug needles, and hemo
philiacs receiving regular blood
transfusions (this last case is rare
because blood transfusions have
been tested for HIV for the past
decade). There is no cure for HIV.
These diseases are preventable.
For more information about com
mon STDs — symptoms, testing
and treatment — and how to pre
vent them, contact your physician
or the Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center located in Cowell
Student Health Center, which is
open Monday through Friday,
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
0Dear Health Forum,
When a doctor takes
a blood pressure, what
does it really mean?
—TKW
A Dear TK,
As your heart
pumps blood through
your body, there is a
pressure exerted against the walls
of yimr arteries. The systolic pres
sure is equivalent to the arterial
pressure when the heart muscle
e<Kitmts in the cardiac cycle; the
diastolic pressure is equivalent to
the arterial pressure during the re
laxation or dilation phase of the
heart muscle in the cardiac cycle.
Blood pressure is controlled to an
extent bv hormones secreted bv
the kidneys and by the sympathetic
nervous system, which controls the
dilation and constriction of blood
vessels throughout your body.
When your blood pressure is
taken with a sphygmomanometer
(the manual instrument consisting of
a cuff and gauge), a cuff is placed
around your arm and inflated tight
enough to momentarily stop the
blood llow through your artery. As
air is gradually let out of the cuff, the
person taking your blood pressure
listens to the blood llow sounds in
your arm with a stethoscope (placed
over your artery at the inside of your
elbow). When that person hears a
thumping sound, the gauge reading is
recorded as the systolic pressure.
When the thumping sound stops, the
gauge reading reflects the diastolic

pressure.
Someone suffering from high
blood pressure could he suffering
from any number of diseases. For ex
ample, if a person is suffering from
atherosclerosis (hardening of the ar
teries), there will be plaque blocking
the blood's path in the artery, giving
the blood less space in which to
move. With this in mind, the blood
creates a higher force against the ar
terial walls under such strain. Thus,
high blood pressure. You may have
heard Dr. Benton yell out "His pres
sure is bottoming out!! Get him up to
OR — STAT!!" some night on ER.
That usually means the patient is
bleeding so heavily that blood is rush
ing out of his body at a greater rate
than doctors can keep it in. The blood
volume decreases, and there is less
pressure or force being exerted
against the arterial walls. Thus, low
blood pressure or a drop in blood
pressure results.
