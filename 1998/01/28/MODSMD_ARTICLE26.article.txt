# Researchers study solar neutrinos
## New evidence suggests 28.4-day cycle in emissions from sun

You would think that if one mil
lion billion sub-atomic particles
were passing through your body
every day. someone would be wor
rying about it. Luckily some people
are. except that they are worried
about why there are only one mil
lion billion particles passing
through instead of many more.
Stanford researchers have been
compiling information about neu
trinos â€” nearly massless particles
first discovered 40 years ago.
Rarely interacting with other mat
ter. neutrinos produced by the
sun's nuclear reactions can reach
earth in about nine seconds.
In this particular study, the
Stanford researchers led by Ap
plied Physics Prof. Peter Sturrock.
Asst. Statistics Prof. Guenther
Walther and physics research asso
ciate Michael Wheatland, analyzed
evidence collected more than 24
years from the Homestake neutri
no detector in South Dakota. Using
advanced statistical procedures,
they found clear evidence for a
28.4-dav cycle in the number of
neutrinos reaching the Earth from
the Sun. The statistical evidence
was reported in the Dec. 10 issue of
the Astrophysical Journal.
Neutrinos from the sun. or solar
neutrinos, are especially puzzling
to scientists because the small num
ber of neutrinos that are detected
on earth do not match the number
expected by current scientific cal
culations. In fact, in order to detect
these virtually invisible particles,
the Homestake detector project
built underground tanks filled with
tens of thousands of gallons of car
cinogenic chlorine-based chemi
cals. Occasionally the same neutri
nos that pass harmlessly through
our body will strike and convert
chlorine into argon. The neutrinos
are then detected by picking out in
dividual argon molecules from the
huge tanks which are built miles
underground in order to prevent
solar rays from interfering with the
experiment.
In this studv the Stanford re

searchers obtained their informa
tion from a detector located in the
Homestake Gold Mine. Buried a
mile underground, the detector
contains 1(H).(M)() gallons of carbon
tetrachloride. For the last 30 years,
the Pennsylvania State University
scientists who operate the detector
have filtered out and counted the
argon atoms that have accumulat
ed every few months. Over this pe
riod. the instrument has identified
an average of about one neutrino
event everv two davs. which is onlv

one-third the amount that was ex
pected.
Identifying a 28-day cycle for
the number of solar neutrinos
reaching earth has led to two con
troversial explanations. The pre
ferred explanation attributes the
cycle to intense magnetic fields ro
tating deep within the solar interi
or. However, this explanation re
quires the alteration of some cur
rently held beliefs.
The hypothesis suggests that
because neutrinos are created in

the nuclear reactions that take
place at the Sun's core, they may
pass through a magnetic region
that could disrupt their flow and
cause the cycling. However, this
idea depends on the assumption
that neutrinos must have some
thing called a magnetic moment, a
physical characteristic that allows
something to he affected b\ a mag
netic field. Current particle physics
have concluded that neutrinos do
