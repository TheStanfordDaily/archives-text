# Man vs. germ
## Pathogen-human relationship explored 
### Erika Cheek Contributing writer 
Stanley Falkow has always been
fascinated by organisms that most
people probably wish they could
wipe off the face of the earth. Since
his introduction to the field of micro
biology at age 11, when he read a
book called Microbes on Earth,
Falkow has studied the way that
"germs" evolve to infect the human
body. "Unlike physicians who study
disease. I'm much more interested in
the biological interaction between or
ganism and host," he explained.
Falkow, a professor of microbiol
ogy and immunology at the medical
sch(H)l, is the 1997-1998 president of
the American Society for Microbiol
ogy. His work on pathogens gives him

a unique perspective on the relation
ship between humans and bacteria.
Scientists used to believe that
pathogens, or disease-causing organ
isms. evolved from free-living inde
pendent beings into parasitic forms
that now depend on humans for sur
vival. This seemed to represent a
backward step in evolution, because
the pathogens had lost the ability to
live freely. But Falkow's work proves
that from a bacterium's perspective,
the ability to infect human beings rep
resents a giant evolutionary step for
ward.
Falkow explained it from the per
spective of a pathogen. "Organisms
we now call pathogens are actually or
ganisms that evolved as commensals
that were able to occupy a new niche
that other organisms couldn't. If vou

find a new niche with new food, you
can extend the range of the organism.
In humans, the challenge was extend
ing beyond the cellular barrier. I'lie
ability to penetrate those barriers is
what we call pathogenicity but is real
ly an advance over other forms."
How did microorganisms evolve
to cross the cellular barrier? The key
lies in pathogenicity-conferring seg
ments of the genome that allow or
ganisms to invade human hosts.
Commensal species that live on
human beings but don't harm them
might inherit these chunks of DNA
and gain the ability to invade and de
stroy host cells. Falkow likened this
method of information exchange to
"a sort of 'microbial Internet'" in
which organisms that are able to ac
cess and integrate pathogenicity

genes have an advantage over those
that cannot.
Additionally, because microbes
are haploid. with one copy of each
chromosome present in each individ
ual, any new genetic information they
gain will be immediately expressed in
their phenotypes. I his might allow
microbes to evolve in quick jumps as
they gain new genes in the form of
chromosomal DNA or plasmids.
small extra-chromosomal pieces of
DNA that can transfer between dif
ferent species of bacteria.
But why should human beings fx*
concerned with the microbial per
spective? Who cares how the com
mon cold became the misery-induc
ing pest that it is: shouldn't we just
concentrate on eradicating it?
Falkow believes such an approach is
naive. "An awful lot of human biolo
gv has evolved because we live in a
sea of microbes, and we can't live
without them, t ierm tree life is not in
the cards for humans." he said.
But Falkow s microbe centric ap
proach is also important because it
helps explain why disease outbreaks
happen For instance, .is people
began to take more showers instead
of baths, bacteria that can convert
into aerosoli/able form like those
that cause legionnaire's disease
have experienced rapid population
expansion A not he t example of mi
crobes taking advantage of human
progress is in the move to the sub
urbs As people encroach on forest
areas and eliminate predators like
bears and wolves, they create ideal
conditions for contact with deer and
mice and the Lyme ticks they carry
with them
In another example, the toxic
