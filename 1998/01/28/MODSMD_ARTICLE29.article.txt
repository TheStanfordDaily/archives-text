Urologist recommends healthy diet to pre
vent prostate cancer

According to Stanford researchers, maintain
ing a health\ diet can prevent prostate cancer.
Asst. Urology Prof. James Brooks claimed that
"we need more studies, hut preliminary evidence
suggests that up to 75 percent of prostate cancer
cases could he prevented by changes in lifestyle
particularly diet."

Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer afflicting
men. Usually, doctors recommend that all men over the age of 50
have yearly rectal exams and blood tests. Those xxho have had fam
ily histories of prostate cancer and African Americans who arc
twice as likely to develop prostate cancers compared to whites or
Asian Americans â€” should have exams beginning at age 40 How
ever. Brooks suggested that men can take an active role in prevent
ing prostate cancer from developing.
"Cutting out the fat max be the best xxav to prevent prostate can
cer." he said. "We've also seen studies indicating that natural sub
stances in vegetables including Ivcopene, the red pigment found
in tomatoes, and selenium, .in element found in garlic, grains and
other plant foods may help reduce prostate cancer."
Selenium is used bx the bodx to produce antioxidant enzymes,
which can prevent electrically unstable molecules called free radi
cals from damaging the body's cells and the DMA contained within
them Damaged DNA often causes cancer. Beta carotene, an an
tioxidant substance found in carrots, is under study tor its possible
role in preventing prostate cancer. Brooks said.
Brooks is also researching how another antioxidant enzyme nor
mally produced in the prostate disappears in patients with prostate
cancer "If we can figure out how to turn it back on or compensate
lor its disappearance, we may be able to find new ways to prevent
or slow prostate cancer," he said.
However, doctors emphasize that routine screening is still nec
essary to detect prostate cancer. Brooks recommended increased
vigilance among men at risk for the cancer. "When found early and
treated aggressively, prostate cancer can usually be cured which
means that regular checkups can save lives." Brooks said.
