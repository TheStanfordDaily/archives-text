# Next up for ASSU: controlling tuition
## 
### Allison Hays Staff writer 
ASSU Senate Deputy Chair
Matt Spence, a sophomore, intro
duced a new bill to create the ASSU
Alliance to Control Tuition at last
night's senate meeting. This com
mittee would conduct research on
tuition increases and present the
findings to the Board of Trustees,
with the goal of keeping tuition
hikes lower.
The impetus behind the task
force is a steady increase in Stanford
tuition above current inflation lev
els. This poses a burden to many stu
dents and presents a threat of future
increases. Spence said.
Spence credits University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper with bringing
attention to the tuition problem.
hope now the ASSU can pick
up i lie other end of the stick and
show the strong student support for
these efforts," Spence said.
1 he Board of Trustees each year
determines the rate of tuition, and
Spence said he feels the alliance
could help prevent drastic hikes.

"Even though the Board of
Trustees has made efforts to keep
tuition costs low, in the future, the
threat of exorbitant tuition increases
looms." Spence said.
The alliance will consist of
Spence, two or three senators and
one student unaffiliated with the
senate. So far. the effort has gained
support from other senators.
Senate Chair Joe Freund. a se
nior, remains positive towards the
prospects of such a committee.
"This alliance can be valuable be
cause it draws attention to an impor
tant issue." Freund said. "It will give
administrators interested in curbing
tuition one more reason to do so."
Part of the problem, says Spence.
is that plans for tuition increases are
not widely publicized.
"We can always scream and
shout after the fact," said Spence.
"We need to take responsible steps
before an increase shows up on your
bill."
Some students feel strongly
about the recent trend in tuition
