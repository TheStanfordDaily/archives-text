who taught in the Creative Writ
ing Program from 1982 to 1993.
She passed away last month
among family and friends after
battling lymphoma. She was 74.
"The death of Denise Levertov
is a sad and diminishing loss for
everyone who cares about poetry
in our time." said English Depart
ment Chair Terry Castle in a state
ment which was read at the memo
rial service. "It has been especially
hard for those of us who had the
honor and pleasure of knowing
Denise during her years in the
Stanford English department. She
was an inspiring colleague, a loyal
friend and an unforgettable pres
ence."
The memorial poetry service —
attended by about 100 people
was comprised of eulogies given
by close friends and colleagues, as
well as readings of her poems by
various members of the Creative
Writing Program.

Poet Adrienne Rich told per
sonal stories about Levertov and
discussed their long-time friend
ship and mutual critiques of one
another's work.
"I will always be indebted to
her ... for the kind of challenge
she presented to me," Rich said.
Stegner Fellow Chris Wiman,
who had been Levertov's student,
said. "Denise had that sort of pas
sion that came from connection
with poetry at the most primary
level."
A statement bv poet Robert
Creely was also read: "Her voice
was lovely. Her laughter, particu
larly her helpless, loud giggles,
were what finally must define 'hu
manness'."
Family friends John, Mary and
Alek Felstiner sang a three-part
choral piece to honor her love of
music. English Prof. Ken Fields,
who also recalled stories of Lever
tov's years here at Stanford, high
lighted that she was "warm,
human, funny, eccentric and obsti
nate."
Poems read included those
with environmental, political and
religious themes, in accordance
with the three primary topics ad

dressed in her works. Known for
her "passionate advocacy." Lever
tov was heavily involved in anti
war protest during the Vietnam
War.
"One of the reasons we honor
Denise Levertov is for her unique
combination of humane energy
and political commitment." said
Creative Writing Program Direc
tor Eavan Boland. "Those led her
into uncompromising statements
on violence and the poet's place in
such a time."
In Levertov's honor, the Eng
lish Department announced that it
will award annually a $1,000
Denise Levertov Poetry Pri/e,
which will go to an undergraduate
who has written the best poem
about the environment.
"In that way, Denise's name
will be associated every year, in a
place which she loves, with a cause
she was deeply committed to, and
through this prize, our hope is that
each year undergraduates will find
in their own lives, and their own
words, and in the name of Denise
Levertov, the place where com
mitment and poetry meet — of
which she was such a clear and
bright example," said Boland.
