# Bookstore lawsuit ends
## Judge finds no evidence of fraud 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Nearly six years after alleged
wrongdoings by high-level Stan
ford Bookstore managers surfaced,
a Santa Clara County Municipal
Court judge has declined to send
the case to trial.
The December decision by Jus
tice Thomas Cain ends more than
two years of preliminary hearings
on the charges brought against
Bookstore General Manager
Eldon Speed, Assistant Manager
Philip C'hiaramonte and Controller
Patrick McDonald by the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's
Office.
The lawsuit stems from an arti
cle published in The Daily in Feb
ruary 1992 that revealed that top
level Bookstore managers were re
ceiving questionable perquisites,
including use of a vacation home in

Twain Harte. Calif., a variety of
cars and a motor home.
Cain found that "there was no
evidence — there wasn't even a
strong suspicion — that Mr. Speed
or Mr Chiaramonte committed
any crime, defrauded anyone or
was dishonest in any shape or
form." said Chiaramonte's attor
ney. Kenneth Robinson. Chiara
monte is "very happy that this mat
ter has finally been put to rest." he
added.
Deputy District Attorney Linda
Condron. who argued the case
against the managers, has the op
tion to refile the charges but said
she has not yet decided whether to
do so.
Condron said she was surprised
by the ruling. "I felt that the evi
dence more than amply support
er!" sendino the case to trial, she
