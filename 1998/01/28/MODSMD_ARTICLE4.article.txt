# Bookstore lawsuit ends
## Judge finds no evidence of fraud 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Nearly six years after alleged
wrongdoings by high-level Stan
ford Bookstore managers surfaced,
a Santa Clara County Municipal
Court judge has declined to send
the case to trial.
The December decision by Jus
tice Thomas Cain ends more than
two years of preliminary hearings
on the charges brought against
Bookstore General Manager
Eldon Speed, Assistant Manager
Philip C'hiaramonte and Controller
Patrick McDonald by the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's
Office.
The lawsuit stems from an arti
cle published in The Daily in Feb
ruary 1992 that revealed that top
level Bookstore managers were re
ceiving questionable perquisites,
including use of a vacation home in

Twain Harte. Calif., a variety of
cars and a motor home.
Cain found that "there was no
evidence — there wasn't even a
strong suspicion — that Mr. Speed
or Mr Chiaramonte committed
any crime, defrauded anyone or
was dishonest in any shape or
form." said Chiaramonte's attor
ney. Kenneth Robinson. Chiara
monte is "very happy that this mat
ter has finally been put to rest." he
added.
Deputy District Attorney Linda
Condron. who argued the case
against the managers, has the op
tion to refile the charges but said
she has not yet decided whether to
do so.
Condron said she was surprised
by the ruling. "I felt that the evi
dence more than amply support
er!" sendino the case to trial, she
said.
Cain felt otherwise, writing in
his ruling that many of the perks the
Bookstore managers received —
which the District Attorney's Of
fice regarded as equivalent to thefts
from the Bookstore — were not un
reasonable rewards for the people
responsible for making Stanford's
one of the best university book
stores in the country.
In addition to the theft, the man
agers also allegedly mishandled in
vestments that resulted in more
than $2 million in losses to the
Bookstore.
The investments were the center
of another investigation conducted
by the California Attorney Gener
al's Office in 1994. Those charges
were settled, and the managers
paid $1 million to the Bookstore.
Two months after the settle
ment. the District Attorney's Of
fice charged the managers with

seven counts of grand theft and six
counts of violating the state tax
code.
Cain dismissed one count of
theft against McDonald because
the statute of limitations on filing
the charges had expired. He found
the other 12 not to have a strong
enough basis for criminal punish
ment.
The lavish perks "raised the
specter of the 'appearance of im
propriety,' " Cain wrote, but can be
blamed on negligence rather than
criminal conduct.
With encouragement from then-
Bookstore Board of Directors
Chair Jack Friedenthal, the man
agers felt they deserved the perks
as a reward for transforming the
Bookstore from a small shop to a
booming $40 million-a-year busi
ness, Cain wrote. The judge came
to the conclusion that Speed and
Chiaramonte had indeed been in
dispensable to the Bookstore's suc
cess.
"Not only did (the Bookstore]
benefit from the innovative man

agement actions of Speed and
Chiaramonte, hut the University,
faculty and student body likewise
profited greatly from their achieve
ments."
Throughout the trial, the district
attorney argued that Speed and
Chiaramonte purchased the perks
without the consent of the Hook
store board, but Cain responded
that, in his opinion, the board had
been so disorganized that it would
be unreasonable to expect all deci
sions to go through it.
Instead. Cain wrote, Speed and
Chiaramonte relied on Friedenthal
as a liaison.
An audit committee in 1992
which concluded like Cain that
nothing illegal had taken place
described the board as seeing itself
"not as a corporate board of direc
tors but as an academic commit
tee." Asa result, the board not only
met irregularly but included mem
bers with no prior experience as di
rectors of a nonprofit corporation,
Cain pointed out.
Friedenthal, who had been in

volved with the Bookstore tor sev
eral years, never delineated the
board members' responsibilities,
and therefore they "routinely
turned over most of the board mat
ters to Dr. Friedenthal with the be
lief that if it was OK with Dr.
Friedenthal. it was OK with them."
Cain wrote.
It was in such an atmosphere
that Friedenthal and the managers
felt cars and other perks were with
in the limits of "creative" rewards
for the benefits top-level employ
ees had brought to the Bookstore,
the judge said. Because University
guidelines put a cap on compensa
tion for Bookstore employees, re
wards had to come in other forms.
The plaintiff also failed to prove
its allegations of tax fraud, Cain
wrote, by assuming too many things
and not showing fraudulent intent
on the managers' part. Further
more. the District Attorney's Of
fice had "individuals possessing
limited competency in the tax field"
examine the Bookstore's tax re
turns, weakening its case, he said.
