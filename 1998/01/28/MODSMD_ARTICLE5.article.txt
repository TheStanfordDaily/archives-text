Without cutting-edge labor his
torian Karen Sawislak on the fac
ulty. Stanford risks undermining
the importance of labor history,
said professors during a one-hour
"teach-in" yesterday.
Sawislak. author of "Smolder
ing City: Chicagoans and the Great
Fire," was denied tenure last year
and currently awaits a verdict from
Provost Condoleezza Rice on her
appeal.
The Committee to Tenure
Karen Sawislak sponsored the
teach-in. entitled "Why Labor His
tory Matters." as a forum for histo
ry professors to communicate to
students the importance of labor

studies and the need at Stanford
for a labor historian such as Sawis
lak. About b() students attended
the forum.
The three-professor panel dis
cussed the role of labor in social
history and Sawislak's contribu
tion to herflfßT.
"The [history] department
badly needed a labor historian,
and Karen Sawislak was head and
shoulders above the rest. She filled
an important gap in the depart
ment." said Histors Prof. George
Fredrickson, who specializes in
19th century America.
"From the mid-1960s to the
mid-8()s. social history was the
dominant form of historical work
I would argue that labor history
was its leading edge." said History
Prof. Joel Beinin, who specializes
in the Middle East.
According to History Prof. Lou
Roberts, an expert on French cul
ture. old labor history focused on
prominent labor leaders and cast
the history of labor as ;i series of
negotiations among top officials.
"What social history did was
create interest in the rank and file"
and the experience of workers.
Roberts said.
Sawislak's work is important.
Roberts said, because il questions
basic assumptions that might be
culturally constructed.
Roberts presented the free
market as an example of a concept
that is often taken as given while,
in fact, the market could be an idea
that gained legitimacy because il
was advantageous to some, serv mg
as a concept by which "capitalists
could intellectually control (work
ers and] the work process,"
Roberts said.
According to Fredrickson. tra
ditional labor historians contend
that the lajKfi
the support of the middle class at
the turn of the century because the
movement had grown less radical.

lii contrast. Fredrickson said, Saw
islak attributes middle-class sup
port to more complex factors.
Sawislak argues that members
ol I lie middle class who often sup
ported welfare capitalism saw
union membership as the way for
individual workers to better their
economic circumstances,
I rcdrickson said.
At the same time, labor leaders
maintained an ideological com
mitment to collectivism and social
ism. As a result, both workers and
middle class proponents of free
market economics found labor
unions acceptable.
Sawislak"s book. Fredrickson
said, presents "ideas of labor that
cross the class divide. [This book]
w ill change the course ol labor his
tory."
Members of the panel praised
Savvislak's work as important and
influential. "Her book is the
strongest link yet forged between
intellectual history and labor his
tory." Fredrickson said. "(Sawis
lak's book] will be of great influ
ence and value."
"|Sawislak| uses innovative
sources.'' drawing on political
economy, poetry, biographies and
memoirs. Roberts said.
