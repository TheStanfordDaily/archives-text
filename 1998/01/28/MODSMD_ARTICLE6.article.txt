# Liberal arts majors find high-tech niches
## Grads 'shed the fuzz' 
### Minna Sandmeyer 
The next time friends and relatives ask what you
could possibly do with an English major, tell them
you're interviewing with software companies.
Contrary to popular belief, there are plenty of
jobs for liberal arts majors, even in technical fields.
Recent Stanford graduate Julie Davisson. an Eng
lish major, now works for Trilogy, a local software
company.
"Of my recruiting class, 21 of us come from Stan
ford. and five are non-technical." Davisson said.
"[Trilogy] believes that any major can prepare you
for the kind of learning and work that goes on here."
For liberal arts majors, marketing positions are
the most available. This is due to the recent realiza
tion in the software industry that simply writing
good software isn't enough, explained Ben Zaniel
lo, who graduated from Stanford with a double
major in urban studies and German studies and now
also works for Trilogy.
"Often the best marketing team comes out on
top. regardless of the quality of the software,
Zaniello said. "So. slowly but surely, software com
panies have realized the need for clarity of prose in
their releases and documentation, the necessity of
strong leadership for running trade shows and the
benefit of a quick mind in marketing strategy — the

list of opportunities goes on, and you
don't need to know how to write
Java to do any of them!"
Lance ( hoy. associate director of
the Career Planning and Placement
Center, ran down a list of non-tech
nical opportunities for fuxzies, rang
ing from management and human
resources to script writing and multi
media work.
"There is an image that only en
gineers get hired (by technology
firms]," Choy said. "A lot 01 liberal
arts majors go to career fairs and get
frustrated because they see compa
nies swarming after the computer
science and engineering majors. The
opportunities [for fuzzies] are there,
you just have to work harder to find
them."
It can be difficult to find these op
portunities, however. "The high tech

industry can look very forbidding to
non-technical people," Davisson
said. She only submitted her resume
to Trilogy at the urging of a friend,
who knew that it was a company that
is friendly to people of all back
grounds.
Even though opportunities for
liberal arts majors to work in techni
cal disciplines are increasing, com
panies that welcome only the techni
cally gifted still exist.
"Wc don't talk to anyone outside
the technical fields at all," said
Roger Milovina, a recruiter for
Hewlett Packard. "Last October
was the first time we even hired out
of the chemistry school. Marketing is
a very small (department]—we don't
conduct interviews on campus. If we
need people, we look to the business
school."
Zaniello recommended finding
fuzzie-friendly companies as the best
approach to take when looking for a
job. "Cio talk to them, learn what
they do and how they do it. If you

think there's a match, don't hold
back —demand an interview, and
tell them why. Enthusiasm, motiva
tion and good communication—
those can he your tickets into the
high tech world."
Davisson advises undergraduates
to "major in what you love and know
that no matter what, you are learn
ing a discipline. The job market can
look scary coming out of Stanford
because you are competing against
each other, but in the real world,
what you majored in is not as impor
tant as how well you perform and
how quickly you learn."
Neither Davisson nor Zaniello
regret their choice of majors. "I'm
glad that 1 majored in English,"
Davisson said. "My major was very
rewarding, and even when I saw the
CPPC listings that indicated that
most companies were looking for
someone with a BS, preferably in
(electrical engineering or industrial
engineering], I would not have trad
ed in [my major]."
