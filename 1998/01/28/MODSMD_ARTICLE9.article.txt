## White House prepares for political war 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)
Catching their breath alter a di/zy
ing string of events. President ( lin
ton's closest advisers are settling in
for "a light to the death" against
prosecutor Kenneth Starr and, il
necessary, Monica Lewinsky.
They hope the president can lie
low, issuing blanket denials and
absolutely no details, until the con
troversy dies down. In the mean
time, Clinton's newly formed crisis
team is searching for ways to
counter secret tapes, salacious
rumors and accusations that could
bring down his presidency.
Their strategy includes trying to
speed up the start of Paula Jones'
sexual harassment trial, blaming
accusations on "this vast right
wing conspiracy" and — as a last
resort — picking through Ms,
Lewinsky's background.
The battle-ready mood is a
stark contrast to last week, when a
stunned Clinton awoke to an ugly
headline: "Starr probes whether
president told woman to deny
alleged affair."
First lady I lillary Rodham ( lin
ton says Clinton woke her up and
said. "You're not going to believe
this, but..."
Hours later, the president
tepidly denied the reports. His
favorability ratings plunged, and
Democrats discussed the matter in

dire terms.
Clinton telephoned donors and
Democratic activists across the
country, gi\ing vague assurances
that the accusations were false.
Reprising her get-it-together
act from the period after the 1994
Republican congressional land
slide. Mrs. Clinton reached out to
trusted friends who have weath
ered past Clinton crises. Former
("ommerce Secretary and political
ly savvy lawyer Mickey Kantor
soon joined the legal team, acting
as the go-between for Clinton's
political and legal shops.
Harold Ickes, slighted by the
president after engineering the
1996 re-election campaign,
received the next call. He is a
brass-knuckles political operative
urging Clinton to fight fire with
fire against Starr and — if push
conies to shove — Ms. Lewinsky.
Harry Thomason, a TV and
movie producer with Arkansas
tics, will help Clinton tell America
about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky — once the lawyers give
him the go-ahead.
Though not in the inner circle,
('linton also has talked recently to
disgraced consultant Dick Morris.
Incredibly, Morris popped off in a
California radio interview yester
day. speculating about the Clin
tons' sex life.
