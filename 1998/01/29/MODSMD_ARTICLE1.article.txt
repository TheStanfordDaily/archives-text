Before a lull house nl Kresge Auditorium yesterday
evening, former Senator Mill Bradley critiei/.ed the cur
rent stale of American democracy and presented a
numher of his ideas for reform.
Hradley is the IW7-MK Payne Distinguished I'rolcs
sor al Stanford's Institute for International Studies.
I he lecture, "In Search of a New American Narrative,"
was the second in his series of five lectures entitled
" I houghts for a New Century: America's Kole in the
World."
Bradley opened by lamenting that even as democra
cy expands dramatically around the world, voter par
ticipation and other elements ol the democratic process
are on the decline in America. This decline, he con
tends. comes from three major areas: politicking, the
media and the public.
I iist. Bradley attacked the current political system.
" I here's too much money in politics" and too many
special interests, he said.
I le told the story of a candidate for Senate who once
approached him for advice. I he candidate insisted he
could win because he could raise money. In fact, he said
he had personally called thousands of wealthy I)emoc
ratic donors.
Instead ol engaging Ins opponent on important
policy issues, lie was on the phone, dialing for dollars,"
said Bradley. Incidentally, the candidate lost.
Bradley also decried politicians' excuse that they
only pursue money at all costs because "everyone does
it."
"It's an untruth, demeans all politicians and drives
the thoughtful away from politics," he said. The many
honest politicians are lluis "trapped in a bad system
within which they can't prove their honesty."
()n the issue «»l special interests, he said that "politi
cians avoid offending any interest group with more
than a SO percent approval rale."
1 ess political favoritism for deep-pocketed special
interests would result in lower taxes for all of us, he ar
gued.
Second, "the media overemphasizes the personal,
the innuendo, and the violent," he said.
I hey provide no context and no view of the big pic
ture ol society, a necessary component of democracy,
he said.

Former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley, now a professor at Stanford's Institute for In
ternational Studies, spoke last night in Kresge Auditorium on "Thoughts for a New
Century: America's Role In the World."
This "fragments reality, driving
the thoughtful to the sidelines, and
allowing the extremists center
stage," he said.
Third, Bradley sees problems
with the American people.
"We need citizens who think
about what's good for the whole
country, not just themselves" and
then exercise their basic right to
vote, he said. "An interested, in
formed electorate gives us far
sighted democracy."
In response to these corrupting
influences, Bradley outlined a
three-pronged proposal to renew
democracy in America.
He championed meaningful

campaign finance reform and the
prohibition of "soft money" dona
tions, hut listed three prerequisites
for reform to happen. A grassroots
citizens' movement, the support of
business, religion, or academia,
and a president willing to force the
issue are necessary, he said.
But as campaign finance reform
laws have been struck down by the
Supreme Court, drastic measures
are necessary.
"We could amend the Constitu
tion to allow Congress and the
states to restrict the amount of
money spent in political cam
paigns," he proposed. He also
mentioned public financing or an
other court challenge in a favor
able district.
Second, he promoted reform
within political parties.

"Parties began as extensions of
communities ... with a mission of
grassroots outreach." he said.
Today, people don't feel that poli
tics is connected to their lives, and
thus the system lacks broad-based
support. He told the audience one
woman's story of Franklin Roo
sevelt's radio addresses in the 19305.
Everyone on her block was
tuned in.he said, and she could
hear it when she walked down the
street.
"It was stereo before there was
stereo."
Finally, he called for a "revolt of
the middle."
"When the debate is dominated
by extremists, you get a one-di
mensional polarization that kills
civility .. . and rarely solves prob
lems," he said.
