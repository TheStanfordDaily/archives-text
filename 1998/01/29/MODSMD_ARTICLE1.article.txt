Before a lull house nl Kresge Auditorium yesterday
evening, former Senator Mill Bradley critiei/.ed the cur
rent stale of American democracy and presented a
numher of his ideas for reform.
Hradley is the IW7-MK Payne Distinguished I'rolcs
sor al Stanford's Institute for International Studies.
I he lecture, "In Search of a New American Narrative,"
was the second in his series of five lectures entitled
" I houghts for a New Century: America's Kole in the
World."
Bradley opened by lamenting that even as democra
cy expands dramatically around the world, voter par
ticipation and other elements ol the democratic process
are on the decline in America. This decline, he con
tends. comes from three major areas: politicking, the
media and the public.
I iist. Bradley attacked the current political system.
" I here's too much money in politics" and too many
special interests, he said.
I le told the story of a candidate for Senate who once
approached him for advice. I he candidate insisted he
could win because he could raise money. In fact, he said
he had personally called thousands of wealthy I)emoc
ratic donors.
Instead ol engaging Ins opponent on important
policy issues, lie was on the phone, dialing for dollars,"
said Bradley. Incidentally, the candidate lost.
Bradley also decried politicians' excuse that they
only pursue money at all costs because "everyone does
it."
"It's an untruth, demeans all politicians and drives
the thoughtful away from politics," he said. The many
honest politicians are lluis "trapped in a bad system
within which they can't prove their honesty."
()n the issue «»l special interests, he said that "politi
cians avoid offending any interest group with more
than a SO percent approval rale."
1 ess political favoritism for deep-pocketed special
interests would result in lower taxes for all of us, he ar
gued.
Second, "the media overemphasizes the personal,
the innuendo, and the violent," he said.
I hey provide no context and no view of the big pic
ture ol society, a necessary component of democracy,
he said.
