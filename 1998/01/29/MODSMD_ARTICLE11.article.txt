# Officials uncertain of Iraqi weapons supply
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) Even
as the United States considers a
possible attack against Iraq, top
intelligence officials acknowledged
yesterday that there are hig gaps in
what they know about Iraqi chemi
cal and biological weapons.
The problem is particularly
acute now that U.N. weapons
inspections have ceased due to Iraqi
refusal to allow access to sensitive
sites, doubly so because U.S. mili
tary commanders may be hoping to
damage Iraq's weapons capability
with air strikes.
"There are enormous gaps in
what we know about where they
were in development of these
weapons of mass destruction," said
Phyllis Oakley, the State Depart
ment's chief intelligence official.
"The number of off-limits sites has
been whittled down, but they're
large enough that we don't know
what they've moved into them, and
if we can't gel at them, we don't
know."
Oakley, along with C'lA Direc
tor George Tenet and Army Lt.
Gen. Patrick Hughes, head of the

Defense Intelligence Agency, told
lawmakers that Iraq probably h;is
little in the way of a chemical or bio
logical arsenal but may have
weapons production facilities.
"Mv personal belief is that fSad
dam) has somehow protected the
essential knowledge and some lew
capabilities that he still has at his
command to continue weapons ol
mass destruction production at some
later time." Hughes said in yester
day's hearing of the Senate Intelli
gence Committee. "That s why lx
being so difficult with us nov\ to
protect that core capability he •>
managed to conceal from us
Although the three officials did
not address in open session the
increasing likelihood ol I S. air
strikes on Iraq, their testimon\
underscored the difficulty ol grap
pling through military means with
Iraq's potential weapons capabilitv.
Defense officials have said
repeatedly, if anonymously, that
they are concerned that the Is
conventional arsenal would be inca
pable of penetrating some of Iraq's
most hardened targets, such as

deeply huried hunkers that may
house biological or chemical
weapons labs Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon earlier this week
pointedly declined to rule out the
possible use of tactical nuclear
weapons against these fortified tar
gets.
And the testimony yesterday
about the uncertainty over what
Iraq has and where weapons or pro
duction facilities may be located
suggests the Pentagon may not be
able to guarantee that air strikes
can destroy what U.N. weapons
inspectors ha\e yet to find.
What is known about Iraq sug
gests a continued erosion of military
strength Ihe Defense Intelligence
Agency reported "significant weak
nesses in Iraq military readiness,
leadership, morale, logistics and
training. Hughes reported "limited
efforts' by Iraq to preserve and
expand missile technologv and
weapons of mass destruction capa
bility And I enet said Iraq remains
strong enough to threaten small
regional neighbors and internal
opposition groups.
