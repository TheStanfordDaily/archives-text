University should be wary
of cleaning cost's impact
in renovated self-ops

Requiring university clean
ing in renovated houses is fair to
students only it" additional costs to
students are kept at a minimum.
Self-ops are deemed as such if (he house
residents are in charge of food service. Typ
ically. these houses hire a cook and dole out
hashing responsibilities in an effort to save
money; in these self-ops. cleaning may or
not be University provided. Co-ops. on the
other hand, must cook their own meals and
clean their own residences. Judging by past
instances, the assessment of charges for
University cleaning to the room bill of a stu
dent in row house adds more than $ 1 (K) to
the resident's bill.
The decision to require University clean
ing is a practical move. The investment that
Stanford makes into the houses should be
protected; keeping costs down is the only
concern. The problem of cleanliness in self
ops is one that most students are aware of.
but not one without a cheap solution. If the
University wants to protect its investment
in the refurbished houses there are other
options that can be explored. It can provide
cleaning services at a lower cost, or make
house residents more accountable. Institut
ing regular inspections and levying heavy

fines for unsanitary facilities could alleviate
the problem.
Alternatively a system could be institut
ed for University cleaning to take place in
areas that are typically unpopular or
neglected during student assignments such
as the bathrooms. This could potentially
balance costs with hygiene concerns.
The former Deke House, now known as
Andromeda, was renovated in the summer
of 1996. The residents saw an increase in
their room hills by over $ 1 (K) per quarter.
One former resident said that the work
performed by the University-hired custodi
ans took each resident about 15 minutes
per week to perform — comprising two
hours and 30 minutes over the course of
the quarter. The residents felt that paying
over $ 1 ( K) for work that they could have
done in two and a half hours was a bit exor
bitant.
Nonetheless, it is commendable that the
University has made a commitment to keep
co-ops in place, respecting their community
focus. Director of Housing and Dining Ser
vices Keith Guy said that even if co-ops
were renovated, they would likely still be
student cleaned and managed.
Many people draw into self-ops, as well,
for the lower total room and board costs as
well as for the desire to live in a smaller
community. Part of community building is
sharing responsibility. Protecting an invest
ment and relying on students to assume
responsibility need not be mutually exclu
sive.
