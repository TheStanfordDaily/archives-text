## Reflecting and finding meaning 
### 
DURING a recent
trip to the San
Francisco Muse
um of Modern Art, I had
an epiphany. As I walked
among the current instal
lations — from brightly
colored canvasses to piles

of candy in a corner, from video presenta
tions to intricate multi-media sculptures —
there were a couple of things I repeatedly
overheard. First, "What is that supposed to
mean?" Second, "I could have done that\"
(Actually, eventually there was a third.
"Excuse me, sir, would you please stop
eavesdropping?" ... but I digress.)
After SFMOMA Security released me, 1
realized that for the average lay person, it is
very difficult to judge art. Those who are
more versed in the world of art can contex
tualize a piece and appreciate its import at
an historic and aesthetic level. For the rest
of us, we're stuck using a more personal
barometer, which translates to whether or
not we "get" what it means and whether or
not we could have done it ourselves. It then
hit me how similar these reactions were to
those that face all of us in academia.
We all walk the tightrope between being
accessible, but not too accessible. Students
who have written papers or dissertations
know what I mean. You don't want to be
too obtuse ("A Deconstructive Analysis of
the Media Imagery of the Portrayal of the
Female Archetypes of the Post-Feminist
Women and the Femme Fatale"), but you
also don't want to seem too banal ("Gilli
gan's Island: Why Mary-Ann is Cooler
Than Ginger"). We're constantly in search

of some middle ground.
When you do research, this tension
affects not only the question you ask. hut
also the methods employed. People scoff at
interviews (You mean you just talked to
people? I could have done that\), they're
impressed by regressions, but are puzzled
by structural equation modeling (What is
that supposed to mean?).
Some disciplines have it better than oth
ers. Anthropologists have their notebooks
and tape recorders, which are nice, but
chemists have the seemingly more impres
sive pipettes and centrifuges and petri dish
es (oh my!). (This, of course, can be deceiv
ing ... I once had a job washing glassware
in a biochemistry lab and stumbled upon an
impressive contraption: Bunsen burners
heating a strange dark liquid in a beaker,
being mixed by a spinning stirring rod — I
eventually found out that the professor was
simply making a cup of coffee.)
You can also be strategic about this.
There are times when you want to be more
accessible (e.g., family functions) and times
when you want to be less accessible (e.g.,
job interviews). I find this contrast most jar
ring when attending scholarly meetings.
When I talk to colleagues at the meeting
about my research, I slip into one mode:
"I'm utilizing Foucauldian genealogy in a
study of the construction of meaning in
learning centers." Twenty-lour hours later
on my return home 1 tell the person sitting
next to me on the plane "I study how
schools work."
In much the same way, I've faced this
same dilemma during my tenure as a colum
nist. Each week as I prepared my column, I

wondered who would eventually read it and
say, "What is that supposed to mean?" and
who would say "I eould have done that' \
constantly struggled to keep from coming
off as rather stupid, hut also didn't want to
end up trying so hard that the column was
unfathomable. This led to some heavy edit
ing, and this being my last column, I don't
mind sharing a few of the "bloopers" that
almost made it into print ("... I slipped into
a deep depression, at once realizing that my
personal home page had had fewer hits than
Billy Ray Cyrus ... .. the only choice
for my new moniker: Postmodern Spice
.."... and if the likelihood of passing my
defense wasn't already shaky enough as a
result of my liberal application of Hai
Karate, it certainly didn't help when I
turned off the overhead projector and
attempted to "Use the Force ...").
As I look back on my columns, I am
proud that 1 didn't make too big a fool of
myself (and actually I'm most proud of the
fact that 1 was able to resist until now the
desire to write the obligatory column about
writing a column). When I first met with
the Opinions editors, I told them that I
didn't consider myself particularly insight
ful, and 1 didn't have any profound wisdom
to share. I am just one voice in the Stanford
University community, and I am glad to
have had the opportunity to share the view
from my little corner of the campus.
Thanks for eavesdropping.

Marc Chun is still a doctoral student in
education. A fter re-reading his columns. he
now understands why there aren 7 any I V
shows about graduate students.
