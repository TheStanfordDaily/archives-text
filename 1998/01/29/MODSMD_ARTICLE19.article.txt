Anti-Unz arguments
ring false
Reading the article on the IJnz initiative
[Jan. 27], I could not hut wonder ahout the
validity of the arguments against the initia
tive given hy the panelists.
When panelist Leyda Garcia said that
"it's easier to learn a second language when
taught in the native language," doesn't that
feel odd to you? My interpretation of her
stajement is her saying that I can learn C3er
mi»n more easily if they teach it to me in Can
tonese?
; From taking four years of Spanish in high
school, I will testify that language courses
much room to improve in terms of
teaching students to communicate in that
particular language. As evident from talking
with people coming hack from overseas pro
grams, language skills rise exponentially
when they are "forced" to use it daily in for
eign countries.
, If students continue to be taught content-
subjects in their native language and
then English separately, most students
wbuld fall back on what's the easiest, name
ly" the native language. It is human nature to
do what one is g(xxl at. And if the goal is to
tewch each and every immigrant English, this
goal would never be attained other than by
thiose who are highly motivated.
! The English language, or any other lan
guage, can only be learned to a proficient
level if a student is constantly exposed to it.
Having a year of strictly English, as accord
ing to the Unz initiative, would definitely

help the students master the skill. No one
can argue that a proficiency in the English
language is necessary to survive in a country
in which English is still the official language.
And if you argue even this point, then you
should ask yourself why students would even
need English in the first place.
Furthermore, when the panelists
described the initiative as "one more attack
on immigrants." I would say that 1 myself
am a first-generation immigrant. I learned
long ago to live with existing customs and
rules when you go to a foreign country.
Taking away bilingual education is not an
attack on immigrants; rather, it is taking
away something, namely bilingual educa
tion. that should not have existed in the first
place.
People do need to be helped and lifted,
but only up to a certain level. After that,
they'll need to climb the fence themselves.
And if you question this, just ask yourself
sincerely: When you look back at your life
and achievements, how proud of yourself
can you be if every single step of your "suc
cess" was due to a break, a law or a govern
ment policy?
Wouldn't you rather say to yourself every
morning that your accomplishments resulted
from your hurdling past every obstacle and
barrier? Wouldn't you?
Hut after all is said and done, let the vot
ers decide. If the initiative is struck down,
hooray for the pro-bilingual education camp;
if not. they can always claim the
cally approved decision as unconstitutional
and take it up the ladder of the court system.

Who exactly is the
arrogant fool?
I was more amused than appalled by
freshman Lex Bayer's somewhat heavy
handed letter to the editor (Monday. Jan
uary 26, 1998), in which he launches an ad
hominem attack against Daily columnist
Darron Evans and his article "Mr. President,
I want your job." However, I found Bayer's
shift from a content-based critique to a gram
mar-based one to be particularly jarring.
Bayer is perhaps premature to conclude
that "Evans has not mastered the simple
rules of grammar." simply because he uses a
split infinitive. Neither "Strunk & White"
nor the "New York Times Manual of Style"
are as absolutist in their treatment of split
infinitives as is Bayer. Both, in fact, concede
that occasionally split infinitives are valid
stylistic devices. Indeed, one could not dis
place the actually in Evans' infamous line 57
without changing the meaning of the sen
tence.
I doubt, however, that Bayer could pro
duce any prescriptive grammarian who
would sanction his expression, "besides from
faulty logic," which seems to be a bizarre
hybrid of "besides faulty logic" and "aside
from faulty logic." Whether this is a product
of carelessness or of an ignorancc of "the
simple rules of grammar," I do not know.
In any case, it is regrettable that Bayer
chooses "besides from" to start out his holi
er-than-thou attack on Evans' command of
the English language, for in doing so any
intended superiority is lost. The moral of all

this, I suppose, is that we should all proof
read our rabid denunciations before we pub
lish them, especially when they contain
unfortunate lines like, "You are an arrogant
f(X)l, who doesn't know how to think, let
alone write." To do otherwise might leave
some confusion in the reader's mind as to the
exact identity of the arrogant fool.

Women, abstain or
use birth control
There has been a lot of arguing over the
topic of abortion in The Daily recently, so I
thought that I'd throw in my two cents. My
little sister. Courtney, died on the 22nd of
December, 19K8. Unfortunately, neither did
I or my family know of her death until three
days later, when she was born on Christmas
day. Through my family's tragic experience
of a stillbirth, I have come to know without a
doubt that a baby doesn't have to be touched
by a doctor's hand to magically become a
"human being" with all of the human rights
there entailed. Even though Courtney was
still unborn, she was a living person and my
baby sister. Why docs it seem that unborn
children don't even have the basic right to
life? Maybe the answer lies in the fact that
there are currently no fetuses serving in
Congress. The point is that when a group of
people is powerless, this world tends to kick
them around. There are, of course, plenty of
examples of this principle throughout histo
ry, but I choose to point you to the authority

on the subject — the movie "Men in Black."
Remember the final scene, right before Will
Smith and Tommy Lee Jones splatter the
alien "bug"? What are the bug's last words?
He explains how millions of his kinfolk have
been poisoned and stamped by mankind.
Were these "murders" justified? I personally
have smashed my fair share of ants. Would I
think twice the next time if that living crea
ture could possiblv scream back at me before
I killed it?
It takes a few courageous people to stand
up against the status quo and protect the
rights of the powerless. Like the bugs in the
movie, there are millions of fetuses currently
being smashed and squashed. Do they not
deserve protection, just because they can't
scream back at us?
If a woman doesn't want to bring a child
into this world, why d(x-sn't she make the
CHOICE to use birth control? A little
responsibility on our part is little to ask in
exchange for stopping the deplorable act of
abortion. Sure, there are some women who
might not have the finaneial means to buy
birth control, but the medical expenses
saved by cutting the number of abortions
would easily pay for a social program to pro
vide birth control for the needy. And of
course, woman have the CHOICE to not
have sex until they are married and pre
pared to have a child. Hiese options are not
about "enslaving women," but are instead
about being a responsible adult who
respects the life of the powerless.
