(1 recii I ibrary is close to select
ing a vendor to run the coffee kiosk
undei construction outside the Ii
brary Peel's ( offee, the chain that
had earlier negotiated with (ire en
to operate the kiosk, eventually
pulled out of the agreement last
year.
I he idea to build ;i coffee kiosk
outside (irecn began in l ebruary
ol 19%. I lie kiosk was part of an
"enhancement to the services
(irecn library provides lor stu
dents." said Sarah Williamson, the

library's director of communica
tions.
Since I'eet's canceled its con
tract, the library has been search
ing for new vendors during the last
several weeks to try to get the pro
ject up and running again
I .ibrary officials interviewed six
prospective vendors and expect to
choose one and begin negotiations
late this week or early next week.
I he primary criterion for selec
tion was the quality ol the coffee
served, and secondarily, the quali
ty of the associated food products.
However, the library ;ilso con

sidered the vendors' environmen
tiil responsibility, customer service
and prices.
"We examined whether ven
cl<»i s' client service record w;is
good and whether they hail .1 good
interface with the public they're
serving," Williamson explained.
111 order to speed completion ol
the kiosk, (irecn officials ;»ls»» re
quired that vendors he able to
begin business relatively soon
"We weren't willing to considei a
company that would take six
months to complete the project,"
she said.

I hough the exact completion
date of the kiosk will depend on
the vendor selected, construction
of the kiosk building has begun and
should be completed by the end ol
this month." Though the exact date
depends on the length of time slip
ulated in the vendor agreement, we
hope to have the kiosk 111 business
sometime 111 March," Williamson
said.
According to Williamson, when
the kiosk is completed it should
bring a "decided enhancement to
the quality of coffee available to
students and faculty."
