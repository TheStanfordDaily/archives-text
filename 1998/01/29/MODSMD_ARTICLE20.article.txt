## A 						call to action on race in America 
### 
Albert Camarill*

IN 1903, AS he surveyed the terrible state
of race relations in the United States, the
famous African American intellectual
W.E.B. Dußois offered a troubling, but
accurate forecast for America at the dawn
ing of the new century. "The problem of the
2()th century," he predicted, is "the problem
of the color line." As the 2()th century comes
to a close, so much of Dußois' prognostica
tion was correct. Despite the civil rights
movement and landmark federal legislation
during the 1960s to protect the civil and vot
ing rights of historically disadvantaged
minorities across the land, racism, discrimi
nation, intolerance and misunderstanding
persist into the late 20th century.
Realizing that a racial divide continues to
separate Americans from other Americans,
President Clinton recently called on us all to
engage in a national conversation about

race. Through his Initiative on Race and
Reconciliation, the president challenged all
citizens of the nation "to promote a dialogue
in every community in the land to confront
and work through these issues, to recruit and
encourage leadership at all levels to help
breach racial divides and to find, develop
and recommend how to involve all of us is
government, business, communities and as
individuals." As the first U.S. president in 30
years to tackle head on the problems associ
ated with race in society, Clinton under
stands well that American democracy in the
21st century is in jeopardy if we cannot deal
effectively with the burdensome legacies of
racial and ethnic disharmony.
As this century comes to a close, Ameri
cans from all walks of life, from all ethnic,
racial, religious and cultural backgrounds
must make a personal effort to grapple with

the meanings of race in their lives, as indi
viduals and collectively as a society. We
must take up President Clinton's challenge
and engage in the difficult task of searching
for ways to breach the historic racial divide.
We must enter the national dialogue at vari
ous levels and at every opportunity — at
home, at work, in our public and private
schools and on college campuses, in places
of worship — and we must equip ourselves
with accurate information. Most important
ly, we must start this dialogue with open
minds and hearts and with a spirit of toler
ance for differences of opinion.
To be sure, significant progress has been
achieved in race relations since the era of
"Jim Crow" when Dußois offered his dire
predictions more than 90 years ago and since
the days when Martin Luther King, Jr.
worked diligently until his death to knock

down the walls of prejudice to build a more
racially just society. However, so much more
progress needs to occur if we have any
chance whatsoever of shaping a society in
the next century for our children and their
children's children to look back and to sa\
that race relations in America have
improved greatly since the late 20th century
The challenge before us is indeed a difli
cult one. If we can muster the national will to
make our ethnically diverse democratic soci
ety function well, we may be able to turn oui
civilization in a direction away from the lega
cies of racial discord that have separated us
for generation after generation. We must
make personal and societal commitments n
engage in discourse and actions to facilitate
race and ethnic relations that will help nar
row the social distance between millions ol
Americans.

As part of the national dialogues on race
in 199K, Stanford University and its newly
established Center for Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity will do its part to pro
mote these dialogues in a variety of ways.
We invite the entire Stanford and Bav Area
community to participate in the events
throughout the year that are intended to
provide information and various perspec
tives important for Americans to consider as
we struggle with issues related to race and
ethnicilv in our society.
