## Mayhem at Maples as Cats come to town 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Head coach Mike Montgomery won't say it
himself, hut Arizona's visit to Maples Pavilion
tonight may be the biggest game the Stanford
men's basketball program has ever played.
Both teams are undefeated in conference play.
Both are in the top 10 of both major national polls.
Students are so excited some begin camping out in
front of Maples as early as Monday afternoon,
hoping to get a chance to witness this event from
the sidelines.
The No. 4 Cardinal (18-0,7-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) will face the No. 6 Wildcats (17-3, 7-0)
tonight at 7:30 p.m. for sole possession of first place
atop the league as well as the upper hand in the
race for the conference title.

Though tonight's game is far from the deciding
factor in the Pac-10 race, its result could have seri
ous implications for the rest of the season.
For the Cardinal it's almost a must-win situa
tion. A loss at home to the Wildcats doesn't paint a
bright picture for the next half of the season, when
the team will take its hardest road trips of the year
through Arizona and Los Angeles.
A win would give more momentum to the Wild
cats, who will only face one of the three other top
conference teams (IJC'LA) on the road next
month.
"1 think if Arizona wins here it really gives them
a leg up," said Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "Just looking at it philosophically, you
have to feel like you have a better opportunity to
win at home than you do on the road. And if they
came in and did that it would certainly be a huge
step for them.
"It would not preclude anything from happen

ing, but it would be a pretty significant step for
them."
The Cardinal still have plenty of emotion left
over thanks to Junior guard Kris Weems's heroics
last weekend. They also hold the nation's longest
winning streak at 18 games, and are still riding their
school-record 20 consecutive victories at Maples
Pavilion.
But all that goes out the window when the de
fending national champions come into town.
"For the Pac-10 race I think it is (a big game],"
said junior forward Peter Sauer. "There's a lot of
pressure on the home team to win because its hard
er to win on the road than it is at home. You can
take your chances on the road, but if you don't win
your home games it puts you in a pretty difficult
spot."
The Wildcats have their own 10-game winning
streak to boast, as well as the quickest, most pro
ductive offense in the Pac-10. The team scores 95.9
points a game (a conference record thus far) and its
18.7 point scoring differential ties it at the top of
the league with the Cardinal.
Lute Olson's squad will look to break the game
open by picking up and controlling the tempo.
They hold a definite advantage over the Cardinal
athletically with guards Mike Bibby and Miles
Simon and quick swingman Michael Dickerson.
They also have the one of the league's most tal
ented backup guards in Jason Terry, who averages
4.8 assists and 1.9 steals off the bench.
"It's much more difficult to handle a team as tal
ented individually as Arizona on the run," Mont
gomery said. "For that to happen that means that
we're not scoring the hall consistently or we're not
doing a very good job on the offensive boards or
we're turning the ball over.
"We need good shot selection, good board cov
erage, good high-percentage scoring, so that
they're maybe having to play half-court offense."

forward Pete Van Elswyk continue to perform as

going to have to run a lot. But win

sophomore, has begun practicing

good job of making sure Madsen
isn't missed too much. Against the
