# Champs await hostile crowd
## 
### Craig Degel Special to the Daily 
TUSCON, Ariz. — While it may
not have the mystique of Duke's
Cameron Indoor Arena. Maples
Pavilion is quickly becoming a
house of horrors for visiting
teams.
Just ask troubled IX'LARen
ter Jelani McCoy.
During the Cardinal's 93-80
win over the Bruins on Jan. 17. the
Maples crowd serenaded McC oy,
who was reportedly suspended for
a positive drug test earlier in the
season, with chants of "marijuana
. . . marijuana" whenevef he
touched the ball.
"I expect the same for Miles
(Simon) or Mike Bibbv," Arizona
sophomore Eugene Edgerson
said. "But that's part of the game
to try and frustrate your opponent
any way you can."
Edgerson for one, welcomes
that kind of environment. !
"Maples is going to! be
rockinY" he said. "We shoulj just
take them out of the game early."
Arizona junior Jason Terry,
vsho plays with the same kind of
emotion that Edgerson does,
thinks he can feed off of that kind
of crowd, no matter who they
cheer for.
"We'll let them do their thing."
Terry said. "This game is impor
tant to us because this will proba
bly decide the Pac-10 Champi
onship."
The Maples Pavilion floor is
also an advantage for the Cardi
nal. It is a springboard-type floor
Arizona's McKale Center will
have one installed after the season
— that bounces as much as 1/4 of
an inch when the students begin to
bounce up and down.
That can cause problems for an
opposing team unaccustomed to
shooting the ball off a trampoline.
"The Pac-10 needs to make
sure they don't allow the students
to bounce when you're shooting
free throws," Arizona head coach
Lute Olson said.
One positive note, however, is
that Arizona tends to shoot well at
Maples and has played well de
spite not Nsining there since 1995.
Last season, the Wildcats (17-3,7-
0 Pac-10) lost on a last-second
shot b\ Pete Sauer. Over the last
10 years, the winning team's aver
age margin of victory in this series
is a mere five points.
Much has been made of Steve
