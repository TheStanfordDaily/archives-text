# Sixth Man Club feeding on hype
## 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
The tents are raised. Tickets are
unavailable even at the poshest of
agencies. National college basketball
attention again shifts its focus to
Maples Pavilion.
And that was on Monday.
Stanford men's basketball faces
the defending national champion
Arizona Wildcats at 7:30 p.m. tonight
in possibly the most hyped men's
hoops home game in school history.
Hut the hype is not without merit.
Sportswriters have ranked Stanford
(IK-0. 7-0 in Pacific 10 Conference)
No. 4 in the nation, best in school his
tory. Arizona, which until Stanford's
victory over UCLA on Jan. 17 was
ranked above the Cardinal, is now

No. 6.
The outcome of this game, to be
seen by a national cable audience on
Fox Sports Net. will likely be very
important for NCAA tournament
rankings, not to mention the Pac-10
championship.
In the last two years. Arizona has
proven to be the most intense and
closely-fought home game of the
year for the Cardinal, which tonight
looks to extend its home winning
streak to 20.
Tickets have been sold out the en
tire month of January, and even tick
et agencies are not expecting an\
last-minute sales. One agency. Mr
Ticket in San Francisco, said it
buying top seats at $150 and selling

them at $350.
The game has undoubtedly bro
ken the earliest Sixth Man Club cam
pout record, with the first tent being
raised Monday afternoon by Chang
Kim.
Kim. a sophomore, has slept out
each of the last three nights to earn
the primest of the prime seats for
himself and some dormmates from
Kimball.
"When we need to go to class, we
have rotations," said Kim. who ad
mitted he has spent most of his time
over the last few days in front of
Maples' student gate.

Even when the Cardinal faced
UCLA, students did inot arrive at
Maples until the day before the
game.
"A lot of people just come up and
say. this isn't for the Arizona game is
it?" said Andv Miller, taking a break
from reading "What is Dance" ("It's
a DR quarter," he says) while saving
spaces for other members of the
Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.
The Sixth Man Club is attempting
to crack down on last-minute line cut
ters to avoid the chaos when the gates
are opened one hour before tip-off.
Jamie Zaninovich, director of
marketing for men's basketball,
asked students hoping to claim a
saved spot in line to arrive by 5 p.m.
The problem was confounded at

the UCLA game when a second stu
dent gate was unexpectedly opened,
allowing some students who did not
sleep out to enter before those who
did.
People on campus who can't make
it to the game today have another op
tion than going off campus. Histori
cally, games televised on BayTV such
as tonight's have not been available
for campus viewing. However, the
Stanford Television Network an
nounced yesterday it will carry the
game live on STV channel 55.
But Scott Scruggs, who also came
early for good seats, knows that any
seat in Maples beats listening to
George Raveling and company.
"A lot of people just shake their
heads and look at us here," he said.
