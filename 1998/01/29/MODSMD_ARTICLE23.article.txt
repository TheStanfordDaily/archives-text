# Sixth Man Club feeding on hype

### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
The tents are raised. Tickets are
unavailable even at the poshest of
agencies. National college basketball
attention again shifts its focus to
Maples Pavilion.
And that was on Monday.
Stanford men's basketball faces
the defending national champion
Arizona Wildcats at 7:30 p.m. tonight
in possibly the most hyped men's
hoops home game in school history.
Hut the hype is not without merit.
Sportswriters have ranked Stanford
(IK-0. 7-0 in Pacific 10 Conference)
No. 4 in the nation, best in school his
tory. Arizona, which until Stanford's
victory over UCLA on Jan. 17 was
ranked above the Cardinal, is now

No. 6.
The outcome of this game, to be
seen by a national cable audience on
Fox Sports Net. will likely be very
important for NCAA tournament
rankings, not to mention the Pac-10
championship.
In the last two years. Arizona has
proven to be the most intense and
closely-fought home game of the
year for the Cardinal, which tonight
looks to extend its home winning
streak to 20.
Tickets have been sold out the en
tire month of January, and even tick
et agencies are not expecting an\
last-minute sales. One agency. Mr
Ticket in San Francisco, said it
buying top seats at $150 and selling
