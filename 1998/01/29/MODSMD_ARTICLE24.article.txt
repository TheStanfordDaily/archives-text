Golden Bears last night.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL

â–  WEDNESDAY'S RESULT: Stanford def. California,
15-4,12-15,15-6.15-9.
The Bears continue to he winless in the 25 years
that the two schools have competed. The Cardinal de
feated Cal last night in four games, 15-4. 12-15, 15-6
and 15-9.
Since the Cal match will not affect the Cardinal's
record because the Bears do not play at the varsity
level. Stanford used this match as an opportunity to
give some players who have not seen much action this
season some playing time.
Freshman middle blocker Dan Zhang had previ
ously made some brief appearances in the Cardinal
lineup. Last night, he made his first collegiate start and
played the entire match, finishing with 13 kills.
Freshman setter Brad Griffith also made some of
his first major match contributions to the Cardinal.
"Brad Griffith did a nice job of going with what was
working." Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves said.
The player that has been vital to
Stanford's defense in the Cardi
nal's previous matches, sopho
more outside hitter Josh Palacios,
also made a major impact against
the Bears. In addition to his strong
defensive presence, Palacios also
had a very strong offensive match.
He had 22 kills on the night, with
only three errors.

"The difference was that Pala
cios had spectacular offensive
night," Nieves said.
Stanford again had a strong
night in terms of serve receive,
something Nieves has repeatedly
said is important for Cardinal suc
cess.
The Cardinal sided out well, an
other crucial part of the match, as
Cal did not give up any points eas
ily.
Junior outside hitter Patrick
Klein led the Cardinal offense with
24 kills. Senior swing hitter Devin
Poolman added 23. and in junior

Jeremy Bart's second collegiate
game as a middle blocker, he start
ed and added 12 kills to Stanford's
total.
Earlier this week, Nieves com
mented that Cal's success or fail
ure would depend largely on Cal
senior outside hitter Pat Aparicio.
Aparicio did his best to help Cal
get their first victory against the
Cardinal, adding more than 30 kills
to the Bears' total.
"At key times in games three
and four we stopped him just
enough." Nieves said.
Much of Stanford's success in

stopping Aparicio can he attrib
uted to Su.nford assistant coach
John Kosty. He helped ensure that
the players put up strong double
blocks on Aparicio. Because of
this direction, the Cardinal forced
Aparicio to tip and hit offspeed.
Stanford also did a great job block
ing and digging his attacks.
Overall, the Cardinal was able
to do some of the things it wanted
during this match. Some previous
ly inexperienced Cardinal players
were able to make an impact and
get some playing time necessary to
Stanford's later success.
