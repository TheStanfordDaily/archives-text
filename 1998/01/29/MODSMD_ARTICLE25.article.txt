# Resolve carries Freuen through injuries

Biding her time.
That's probably what has best personified redshirt ju
nior Regan Freuen, a member of the highly-touted re
cruiting class of 1994 that included Kristin Folkl. Naomi
Mulitauaopele, Olympia Scott and Heather Owen.
While they have flourished in Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer's post-oriented offense at one point or an
other, it has been a slightly different road for the
Spokane. Wash., native.
"I think (Freuen) is displaying great determination."
VanDerveer said. "And a lot of people who maybe
didn't plav that much as a freshman, didn't plav that
much as a sophomore, was hurt for a year, would hang it
up. And 1 think Regan is doing well. I'm getting greedy;
1 want more."
Displaying great determination has been something
of a two-edged sword for the former AAU All-Ameri
can. While determination and patience have paid off
with some solid contributions this season, the desire to
come back from injuries too s<x>n her first two seasons
may have initially set her back. But there have been
other factors as well.
"It's been a real transition in the competitiveness and
the intensity of everything." Freuen said. "Defense is
much different here. In high school, you thought you
were a pretty go<xl defensive player, but you get here
and you find you're not applying nearly (enough defen
sive) pressure. I"hat was the biggest adjustment for me. I
was also having injury problems, so I was dealing with
that."

During her freshman year. Freuen had to wait behind
great players like Kate Pave and Kate Starbird while oc
casionally contributing to the team's Final Four run that
year. The following vear. naumng injuries to her back

and ankle limited her to 18 games, although she was able
to come home and pi>st a then-career high eight points
against Washington State.
"The injuries were a struggle 1 had to go through be
cause I'd get injured and then I'd come back and try to
get in good shape, and then I'd get injured again."
Freuen said. "So I w as never in good shape and if you're
not in giHÂ»d shape, you can't perform. You can't com
pete with the people you're playing against. I"hev're just
going to run you down the floor and vou'd get tired.''
Rut the iniury problems were only a prelude to what
happened last season when she suffered a femoral neck
stress fracture of the right hip the first week of practice.
Needless to say. this was not an injury that she could be
stubborn about and try to come back quickly, so she de
cided to redshirt.
Rcdshirting "was difficult because I couldn't practice
and I couldn't travel, so you feel kind of separate from
the team." Freuen said. "Mentally it was tough. 1 hon
estly think rcdshirting was the best thing that could have
happened to me because I was able to watch people in
practice and learn from watching 1 was able to mentally
refocus. and I w as also able to get stronger because all I
could do was lift (weights). Also, 1 was able to take my
time and get in gixxl shape instead of having the pres
sure of trying to get back "
So despite not having Freuen during the emotionally
intense season, the Cardinal has benefited frtmi
having an experienced player out on the perimeter this
season in order to help take pressure off the combustible
backcourt of Melody Peterson. Christina Hatastini and

Former AAU All-American Regan Freuen, a red
shirt junior, has stepped up her defense in the col
lege ranks.
