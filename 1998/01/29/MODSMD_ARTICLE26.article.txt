# Cardinal women embark on southwestern swing
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Unusual road trips have become
the norm for the ninth-ranked Stan
ford women's basketball team.
This weekend the Cardinal (10-5,
7-1 Pacific 10 Conference) heads to
Arizona, not for the usual Arizona-
Arizona State weekend, but for one
game against the Sun Devils tonight
at 7 p.m. After that Stanford travels
to Lubbock, Tex., along with Ari
zona for the Big 12/Pac-10 Chal
lenge.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ TODAY: Stanford (10-5, 7-1) vs.
Arizona State (7-9, 3-4) at Tempe,
Ariz., 6 p.m. PST. RADIO: KPBA
AM (1050), KZSU-FM (90.3).
■ SATURDAY: Stanford vs. Texas
Tech (13-3, 6-1) at Lubbock.
Texas, 3 p.m. PST. TV: ESPN2.
RADIO: KPBA-AM (1050),
KZSU-FM (90.3).

Hut first up is Arizona State. The
Sun Devils (7-9, 3-4) are in the bot
tom half of the conference but have
proven to be much tougher at home
than on the road. As a team, Ari
zona State is first in the Pac-10 in
free throw percentage with a 76 per
cent clip in conference games.
"1 think Arizona State has to get
our team's attention in that they
beat Washington and they played a
10-point game with Arizona," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"They do have a young team, but
they play very aggressively and they
have nothing to lose. We still have
the big bulls-eye on our back in the
Pac-10."
The made for television extrava
ganza in Lubbock pits the Cardinal

against No. 5 Texas Tech, while the
lOth-ranked Wildcats take on
Kansas. And while tonight's game
against the Sun Devils is important
for the conference standings (the
Card holds a one-game lead over
Arizona and Oregon), Saturday's
game is even bigger as the 5 p.m. na
tionally televised game has NCAA
tournament implications written all
over it.
"Both games are important for
different reasons," VanDerveer
said. "At this point a win at Texas
Tech is more of a confidence builder
than anything else. A win at Arizona
State helps us in our conference. A
win at Texas Tech helps you with the
NCAA and gets people's attention
that 'hey, they're a better team than
in the beginning of the year.'"
For Stanford, it's a pivotal oppor
tunity to move to .500 against non
conference as well as ranked oppo
nents. The game is also on national
television, so it's a prime time for the
Cardinal squad to show how im
proved it is since the early season.
Stanford's current four-game win
streak and a 8-1 mark since Dec. 28,
have erased memories of a 2-3 start.
A matchup against a top-five oppo
nent, however, is the Cardinal's first
real test since a one-point loss to
then-No. 10 Arizona. And for Stan
ford to win, it will have to do what no
other Cardinal team has ever done
— get a win in the unfriendly con
fines of the Lubbock Municipal Col
iseum.
"They're a legitimate top-five
team," VanDerveer said. "They've
been in the top five or six all year
long. It's very tough to play there.
They'll have a huge crowd, and
they've got a great player in Alicia
Thompson."

Stanford is 5-2 all-time against
the Lady Raiders, but the Card's
only two losses were in Lubbock
(1993-94, 1995-96). But Texas Tech
(13-3, 6-1 Big 12) likely harbors
some ill will toward the Cardinal for
ending its season a year ago.
The Lady Raiders came into
Maples Pavilion for the NCAA sub
regional and were turned away by
the Final-Four bound Cardinal, 67-
45. Texas Tech's Alicia Thompson
led all scorers with 24 points in that
contest, and this season the senior
forward Naismith candidate is aver
aging 22 points and 8.6 rebounds per
game.
But if Thompson is an outstand
ing post player, she's up against a
barrage of them in the Cardinal.
Stanford has four posts players aver
aging double figures, including ju
nior forward Kristin Folkl who's
coming off the bench to be the
team's leading scorer (19.7) and re
bounder (9.0). Folkl's performance
against the Washington schools
earned her Pac-10 Player of the
Week honors for the first time in her
basketball career.
"Right now they're just dominat
ing whoever else is down there,"
sophomore guard Milena Flores
said of the Stanford post game.
"And I'm pretty sure that's how it's
going to keep up the rest of the year.
I don't think there's anybody better
than them in the country."
Against Washington she and se
nior center Olympia Scott combined
for 59 of Stanford's 90 points and to
gether with senior forwards Heather
Owen and Vanessa Nygaard the
quartet is notching 62.8 points and
28.5 rebounds per game.
"I think we have a great inside
game," VanDerveer said. "I just call

it the meat and potatoes — go inside.
When you look at the Stanford men
it's an inside game and your perime

ter people compliment that. We have
a great inside game, and we've got to
go to it and make people stop it."
