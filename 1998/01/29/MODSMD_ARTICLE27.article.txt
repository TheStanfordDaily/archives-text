### Gabby Duno 
In a clash of unbeatens last week
end, the San Diego State men's
rugby team proved no match for
Stanford as the Cardinal improved to
'•-() with a 3K-17 victory.
After an impressive 5-0 start to
the season. Stanford took its unde
feated record to San Diego Saturday
to face off against last year's regional
qualifiers and Southern California
Champions, San Diego State. The
A/tecs are currently ranked No. 2 in
Southern California and in the top 15
nationally.
The obvious offensive dominance
of Stanford somewhat overshad
owed the incredible efforts given de
fensively. "{Jsually the offense is our
strongest point," said coach Franck
Boivert. "but this time the team dis
played some good lighting on de
fense."
Coach Boivert seemed pleased
with his team's efforts. While admit
ting that his team made too many
mistakes offensively, he was happy
with the defense, saying that one of
his main glials was too apply more
pressure. " This time," he said, "we
did it."
The Cardinal scored first in the

game when senior inside center Mike
Weiner scored the first two tries of
the game. Kicker Dave Warter con
tributed equally well, hitting four out
of six conversions.
At the half. Stanford led 12-0. The
first score of the second half came
when sophomore Michael Ceballos
contributed a try of his own. extend
ing the lead to 19 points. San Diego
State quickly countered the Cardinal
attack, scoring a try and making it 19-
5.
The Cardinal came right back as
senior flyhalf Nathan Rundell scored
his first try of the game. Again coun
tering Stanford's offense, the Aztec's
scored a try of their own. Carl Wente,
who played basketball for Stanford
last year, showed his athleticism as he
scored a try to put Stanford up 31 -12.
With minutes remaining in the game,
Kundell scored his second try of the
afternoon. In the last minute, San
Diego State scored again, but it was
not enough to overcome the Cardi
nal's powerful combination of offen
sive and defensive dominance.
The victory over the Aztecs shows
the team's potential. Three of Stan
ford's best players, including captain
Trung Ngo, were injured and did not
play. More importantly, the game set

a precedent for the weeks to come.
Over the next five weeks, the Cardi
nal will face a core of tough oppo
nents: UC Davis, the University of
Victoria — the North American
Champions the last two years in a
row — British Columbia, BYIJ and
Cal.
Cal has won the National Cham
pionships six years in a row. Two
years ago, the Cardinal became the
only US college to beat the Bears in
six years. Despite Cal's obvious
strength, coach Boivert feels that his

team has a better chance this year to
pull out a victory than in years past.
"If we work hard and believe in our
selves. we can do it."he said.
Stanford next game is against
league opponent Humbolt State, at l
p.m. Jan. 31 at New Maloney Field.
This game is an important one for the
Cardinal. A victory would secure a
playoff spot.
Rugby's second team also provid
ed a strong effort over the weekend,
despite losing 38-26 on Sunday ver
sus UC-San Diego.
