## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
Just when the ring starts to feel
comfortable, you have to go out and
defend the title.
With an 8-1 win over Hawaii last
Tuesday and three road matches
this weekend, the 1997 NCAA
champion Stanford women's tennis
team has kicked off its pre-confer
ence season this week.
The preseason No. 5 ( ardinal
(2-0) travels to Oregon. Washing
ton State and Washington this
weekend for a stretch of three
matches in three days.
The Cardinal has been at the top
of the collegiate tennis world since
Julie Scott's overhead gave the Car
dinal the title in last season's cham
pionship triumph over Florida at
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
But the rankings seeded Stan
ford fifth in the preseason polls,
perhaps noting the graduation of
seniors Katie Schlukebir and San
dra De Silva, and the loss of NCAA
champion Lilia Osterloh to the pro
fessional ranks.
Despite the ranking. Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan will
take his lineup just as it is shaping
up.
"It's a new year and a new
team." Brennan said. "There are
different roles for people. But I
think No. 1 through No. 6. we're as
good as anybody." Brennan said. "I
think our lineup is just as tough.
The ranking was just low enough to
insult us."
Sophomore Anne Kremer is at
the top of that lineup in the No. 1
singles spot. Kremer spent last sea
son at the No. 2 spot, behind Oster
loh.
"Anne might have been the best
player in the country last year."
Brennan says of his new No. 1. "She
is bv far the highest-ranked ama

teur in the world. So theoretically'
she is the best No. 1 in the
Not even theoretically."
Kremer cruised in her match,
against Hawaii, defeating Petfa,
Holma easily. 6-0.6-2. •
Scott, now a senior, is one spot,
behind Kremer at No. 2. Scott final-,
ly received her due national attenr<..
Hon at the end of last season, after,
winning her second straight Pacrlw
10 Conference title and reaching
the semifinals of the NCAA singles
draw.
Following Scott in the lineup i>
hard-hitting sophomore Teryw
Ashley, who went undefeated last
season at the No. 6 spot. Both Scott
and Ashley are making jumps into
the top half of the lineup, but agauj,.
Brennan isn't concerned.
"Julie and Teryn are up quite a
bit in the lineup." he said. "But Julie
was obviously an outstanding No, 5,
player, and we know what Terya
did last season."
Ashley had little trouble with
Hawaii's Michelle Radman. regis
tering a 6-1.6-1 win at the No. 2 spot
in Scott's absence.
Senior Ania Bleszysnki will ocy>
cupy the No. 4 singles position
the Cardinal. After finishing
season an All-American and
tional semifinalist in douhlong
Bleszysnki is returning to the i<>nqC
that took her to the national semjfft
nals in singles as a sophomore.
Bleszysnki did not lose a gamafl*»
her match against Hawaii. blankttHJ
Lynn Novack. 6-0.6-0.
Stanford's only freshman staffiS
ingin the top six is Sarah PestieatiiflK
the No. 5 spot. Brennan has
particularly impressed with
freshman s game in her first f(gir.
months as a collegiate player.
"We didn't know too
about Sarah before she got here
but she has been great," Brennan
said.
Sophomore Jenn Heiser rounds
out the singles lineup at the No. 6
slot. Heiser will be starting for the
first time in her Stanford career after
serving as a reserve on last year's
championship team.
"Jenn was on one of those in
credibly deep teams last year,"
Brennan said. "But she is a really
good player. She came back from
last year with a vengeance and she is
our most improved player on the
team."
Pestiau won a tight three-set
challenge match to earn the spot
and determine the bottom of the
lineup. Both Pestieau and Heiser
won in straight sets against their

Rainbow opponents. At the No. 6
position against Hawaii, senior
Sophy Woodhouse earned a
straight-set win over Nalani Cruz, 6-
0.6-2.
Two of the three doubles team
remain intact from last season. Kre
mer and Ashley, who served at the
No. 3 spot last season, have earned
the No. 1 spot despite the return of
Bleszysnki and Scott, who proved to
be the Cardinal's top team last year.
"kremer and Ashley are just bet
ter right now," Brennan said. "They
are simply beating them in prac
tice."
Bleszysnki and Scott get the nod
in the No. 2 position.
Pestiau and Heiser will team up
in the third position, and seem to be
answering one of the team's biggest
question marks.
"I think they have meshed beau
tifully as a team," Brennan said of

his third doubles squad. "They arc a
match made in heaven."
Pestieau and Heiser bulldozed
Rainbows Natalie Lum and Novack.
8-1. In the No. 1 match against
Hawaii. Kremer and Ashley earned
an 8-5 win over Holma and Susie
Saunders. The Cardinal lost their
only match of the day in the No. 3
doubles match, where senior Heidi
Stalla and freshman Julia Sherbakov
dropped a 9-8 tiebreaker.
The Cardinal takes this lineup up
north for a meeting with three West
Coast teams that have traditionally
not spelled too much trouble for
Stanford, a Pac-1() South power
house.
"I don't think we will win all 27
matches up there this year," Bren
nan said. " There are some surpris
ingly competitive teams up there."
And everyone will be gunning
for the defending champs.
