Just when the ring starts to feel
comfortable, you have to go out and
defend the title.

Tuesday and three road matches
this weekend, the 1997 NCAA
champion Stanford women's tennis
team has kicked off its pre-confer
ence season this week.

ton State and Washington this
weekend for a stretch of three
matches in three days.

of the collegiate tennis world since
Julie Scott's overhead gave the Car
dinal the title in last season's cham
pionship triumph over Florida at
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.

ford fifth in the preseason polls,
perhaps noting the graduation of
seniors Katie Schlukebir and San
dra De Silva, and the loss of NCAA
champion Lilia Osterloh to the pro
fessional ranks.
Despite the ranking. Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan will
take his lineup just as it is shaping
up.
"It's a new year and a new
team." Brennan said. "There are
different roles for people. But I
think No. 1 through No. 6. we're as
good as anybody." Brennan said. "I
think our lineup is just as tough.
The ranking was just low enough to
insult us."
Sophomore Anne Kremer is at
the top of that lineup in the No. 1
singles spot. Kremer spent last sea
son at the No. 2 spot, behind Oster
loh.
"Anne might have been the best
player in the country last year."
Brennan says of his new No. 1. "She
is bv far the highest-ranked ama

teur in the world. So theoretically'
she is the best No. 1 in the
Not even theoretically."

10 Conference title and reaching
the semifinals of the NCAA singles
draw.

hard-hitting sophomore Teryw
Ashley, who went undefeated last
season at the No. 6 spot. Both Scott
and Ashley are making jumps into
the top half of the lineup, but agauj,.
Brennan isn't concerned.
"Julie and Teryn are up quite a
bit in the lineup." he said. "But Julie
was obviously an outstanding No, 5,
player, and we know what Terya
did last season."
Ashley had little trouble with
Hawaii's Michelle Radman. regis
