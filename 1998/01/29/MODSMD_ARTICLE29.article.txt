# Paint problems for Rains
## Residents complain about inconvenience of maintenance 
### Kelly Christeson 
When some apartments in
Rains Houses are painted early
next month, the walls w ill be white
and some of the residents will be
red with frustration.
According to an e-mail sent to
some Rains residents, students
will be notified 48 hours before
their apartments are coated in a
new layer of eggshell paint — the
houses' first retouching since their
construction 10 years ago.
Some residents have com
plained that the short notice and
the timing of the maintenance, set
to begin Feb. 3, will cause them
un d ue i ncon ve nie nee.
Oliver Fringer, a doctoral stu
dent. said he thought Student
Housing Services could have bet
ter accommodated students. Sum
mer would be a better time, he
said, because the residences are
less populated then. Also, resi

dents have a more flexible sched
ule during summer because they
are mainly doing research, and not
attending and teaching classes.
Paul Harvey, a manager for
I lousing Services, agreed that this
painting is not being done at the
best time. "It is inconvenient, but
it's not a huge disruption," he said.
There really is no convenient time
for capital improvements in grad
uate housing, he said, because res
idents occupy the buildings 12
months a year and do not often
travel home over school vacations.
Other residents do not seem
too concerned about the painting.
Kristin Fridgeirsdottir, a doctoral
student, said "It's nice to get new
paint."
Others did not see a pressing
need for the new paint job. Jeff
Florando, a master's student, said
his apartment did not need new
paint. However, Harvey said that
the longer the process is post-

poned, the more expensive il is.
The process will take two days.
On the first day, bedrooms and
bathrooms will be painted; the
common areas will follow on the
second day. Students are expected
to remove all wall decorations,
and box all breakables, bathroom
and living room decorations and
kitchen items. A new odorless
paint will be used, allowing resi
dents to reside in their apartments
during and immediately following
painting.
Due to a lack of funds, only
about 50 percent of the 400 or so
apartments will be painted.
Housing Services is repainting
now in order to finish the im
provements before Aug. 31. whieh
is the end of the fiscal year. After
this date, all the funds that were
earmarked for Rains will be
turned over into a general fund
and used for another project, Har
vey said.
