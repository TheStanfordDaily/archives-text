director of Stanford's ( enter for In

"The |Academu Strategic Al
Nances IVi»giam) in essence gets urn
versities working on non weapons
problems that are important U> our
society In the process the universi
ties will produce new modeling and
computation technology that the
[Department of Energy] will adapt
for its needs," he said.
The program's $20 million is dis
tributed to Stanford's Center for In
tegrated Turbulence Simulations
where it goes to the study of gas tur
bine engines. However, the report
contends that this research is indi
rectly focusing on problems associ
ated with nuclear weapons.
"Stanford's research involves
the study of turbulent fluid flow
which is important to both nuclear
weapons and gas turbine engines,"
said McKinzie. "In a sense each uni
versity involved in the [program] is
working 011 pieces of the nuclear
weapons puzzle."
Reynolds disagreed. "This same
thing can be said about almost any
thing. including weather prediction,
fabrication of semiconductor elec
tronic devices and advanced meth
ods of cardiovascular diagnosis and
treatment, " said Reynolds. "The
report is far too shortsighted in its
view."
At the heart of this debate is the
possible proliferation of arms due
to the conjoined government / uni
versity effort. Though against nu
clear armament in general, the
council stipulates that research into
new nuclear technology is its prima
ry grievance, while it feels the main
tenance of old nuclear weapons rep

resents a necessary safeguard.
"Universities should focus on re
manufacturing and surveying the
current nuclear stockpile, not in the
research for new weapon types,"
said McKinzie.
"The [Academic Strategic Al
liances Program] is a valuable com
ponent of stockpile stewardship,"
said Deputy Director of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
Sidney Drell. "Advances in com
puter speed, capacity and codes will
permit more accurate and reliable
simulations as substitutes for nu
clear tests for identifying potential
problems."
The program is an unclassified
venture, but foreign nationals are
not allowed security clearance to
work on the supercomputers at the
Department of Energy's labs which
"alone shows how this program is a
bad idea since it compromises the
University's non-discrimination
policy," said McKinzie.
" The restrictions on foreign stu
dent use of the [Department of En
ergy] computers have to do with
technology export controls im
posed by the Congress, not with nu
clear weapons secrecy." explained
Reynolds. "Personally. I believe
that this is rather unfortunate be
cause our foreign students are in
many cases future citizens and are
one of our greatest national re
sources."
The program "is a great oppor
tunity for Stanford faculty and stu
dents interested in this field," said
Drell. "It is good research."
