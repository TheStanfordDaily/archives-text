## I Been All Night Coming Home Grateful Dead Records Releases Two New live Albums 
### Zachary Roberts Editorial staff Zachary Roberts Editorial staff 
Intermission had the chance to get the history
of Grateful Dead Records from GDR publicist
Dennis McNally. He also explained how GDR
ended up releasing the Crosby-Nash album.
Intermission: So how did Grateful Dead
Records get started?
Dennis McNally; GDR began in the mid '80s
as a reaction to the transition to CD by the music
industry. By that point, the Grateful Dead had
had three different eras in its recording career,
the early years with Warner Brothers, and from
1976 on, with Arista. In between, the Dead
briefly worked with United Records and also
tried to start its own label, but to no avail.
When the '80s rolled around, rights to the
material from that middle period and some of
the early solo work by Dead members — like
Jerry Garcia's album "Garcia" and Bob Wier's
album "Ace" — had reverted back to the Dead.
Unfortunately most of that stuff, which was re
leased on vinyl records, was also out of print So
the Grateful Dead formed GDR as a way to re
release early Dead albums on CD.
I: What about the live albums?
DM: Early in the 19905, in reaction to years
of Deadhead requests, the Dead began to release
tapes from its legendary vault. The"From the
Vault" series is made up of first string tapes.
They're multi-track recordings that can be
mixed down and polished- The second string of
tapes, which are released as 'Dick's Picks,' can't
be mixed down because [the tapes] are mosdy
dual-track recordings. They"re acoustically less
fancy, but they sell in tremendous numbers.
I: How many albums has GDR released?
DM: More than 25, probably close to 30.
There are nine Dick's Picks, five "From the
Vault" releases and several other Dead albums
with random tides. Warner Brothers and Arista
still distribute the albums made when the Dead
were under contract with them, but GDR han
dles all the spin-off projects, including Mickey
Hart's Planet Drum and Bob Wier's stuff.
I: Why did the Crosby-Nash album end up
getting released by GDR?
DM: The Crosby-Nash tapes were released
on GDR because Stephen Barncard, who pro
duced "Another Stony Evening," also produced
the Grateful Dead's 1971 album "American
Beauty." At first he was considering self-releas
ing the new Crosby-Nash disc, which is not that
hard to do, actually, with about $5,000. It's $2
per disc and packaging total, so you make the
profit, but it's also a lot of time spent licking
stamps and sealing envelopes. When Barncard
realized that the GDR "Almanac" newsletter
had a subscription of 175,000 people and was
sent out four times a year, he proposed to release
on the GDR label, and we said fuck yes. It ap
peals to the same audience that receives the
GDR Almanac, so it just made sense.

"We can share the women / we
can share the wine /we can
share what we've got of
yours / since we've done shared
all of mine."
—Jack Straw
The saga that is the Grateful
Dead continues after 30 years,
an epic tale that included over
2,000 concerts and a sociocul
tural impact that will rever
berate for generations to
come. The next chapter of the
story has begun in the form of
two simultaneous releases by
Grateful Dead Records
(GDR).

"Terrapin Station," Grateful
Dead
"Terrapin Station" is the
Grateful Dead's entire two
hour, 47-minute concert on
March 15, 1990. That an en
tire live concert would be re
leased on CD is not new to
GDR. But "Terrapin Station"
— which carries the same
name as the epic Dead studio
album of 1977 — is the first to
be printed in a limited edition
only. (The copy sent to Inter
mission is #35793.)
What makes this album
even more special is that "Ter
rapin Station" was released in

conjunction with the announcement
that the Grateful Dead are planning to
build an actual Terrapin Station, a huge
multi-media playground, museum and
hotel in San Francisco. The remaining
members of the Grateful Dead are even
rumored to be considering a 1999 New
Year's Eve reunion concert at the 1000-
seat concert hall.
So this album establishes a unique
link between owners in way that is far
different from any other Grateful Dead
release. Which is, perhaps, one of the
reasons that GDR released it. The idea of
community has always been central to
the Grateful Dead, so much so that
heads refer to each other as "family" and
"kids." The Dead were ever aware of this
community that had developed around

them, and the Grateful Dead (as their
corporate entity is known) worked to
foster it through organizations such as
the Rex Foundation and GDR.
That some CD recordings of live
Grateful Dead can sell like hot cakes de
spite a) being absent from retail music
stores (they are available only through
mail-order) and b) the cult of concert
taping that the Dead fostered (which has
made CD-quality recordings of hun
dreds of shows available on audio cas
sette and DAT), says something about
the respect this music commands.
Listening to the 1990 concert, it's no
wonder that folks are willing to order
the $39.50 limited edition "Terrapin
Station." The first disc starts with a six
minute plus "Jack Straw," one of the
Dead's nugget tunes. When Bob Wier
misses a line of lyric in the second verse,
the sound of the audience and band
laughing prophecy the looseness and

good mood that pervades this show
from start to finish.
Following "Jack Straw" is the melo
dious "Sugaree," another crowd fa
vorite. After a standard "Easy To Love
You," written by then-keyboardist
Brent Mydland, comes Wier's interpre
tation of Robert Johnson's classic
"Walkin' Blues," a sultry slide-blues
groove. The disc continues with an
eight-minute version of "Althea" and a
bizarre interpretation of Bob Dylan's
"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues," in
which bassist Phil Lesh improvises some
lyrics and removes others.
A nine-minute version of Jerry Gar
cia and Robert Hunter's southern
honky-tonk "Tennessee Jed" leads to
the ethereal "Cassidy," and the disc clos
es out with a fantastic version of "Don't
Ease Me In," a traditional folk tune the
Dead have been ripping up since the late
'60s.
The second and third discs — which
have 10 tracks combined, only one
more than the first disc — capture the
technical mastery, psychedelic glory and
lyrical genius of the Grateful Dead in ex
tended jams. The stage is set from the
start with the masterpiece of "China Cat
Sunflower" played into "I Know You
Rider," a combo the Dead jammed for
almost 20 years. After the raucous
"Samson and Delilah" comes the title
track, which stretches over 22 minutes
with an eight-minute jam that blends
straight into the trademark "Drums,"
an up tempo improv interlude by
drummers Mickey Hart and Bill
Kreutzmann that finishes the second
disc.
Since the late 19705, the Dead had
used "Drums and Space" as a way to
both give the melodic section and the
rhythm section a rest halfway through
the second set in preparation for the
show's finale, and as an experimental
space in which the musicians could ex
plore sound outside of the strict bounds
of their usual songs. So the third disc
picks up with the "Space" section of the
show, and is quickly followed by anoth
er disappointing Mydland song ("1 Will
Take You Home"). Although Brent's
tunes were disappointing, his playing on
the entire album adds energy and class
to the show.
The Dead end its show with a tri
umvirate of virtuoso songs. A 11-
minute version of the slow and emo
tionally grueling "Wharf Rat" ends on
the same note that Wier's poppy but
brilliant "Throwing Stones" starts on.
Nine minutes later, the Dead slip easily
into the classic "Not Fade Away" with
pounding rhythms and blistering gui
tars.
In a move that really helps translate
the show's continuity to the recording,
GDR included the four minutes of
crowd cheering between the end of the

show and the encore, a cover of the Bee
tles' "Revolution." The boys are tired,
and it's a little hard to hear Jerry singing,
but they dial up to 11 and really rock it
in a bluesy way that John Lennon would
have been proud of. It's the perfect song
to play, and it gives the show — and the
album — a sense of closure that can
come only from a well-constructed and
emotionally stirring set.
"Another Stoney Evening,"
David Crosby and Graham Nash
In contrast to the electric rock of the
Dead, Crosby and Nash's "Another

Stoney Evening" is real "wooden
music," as Steve Silberman points out in
his extensive and excellent liner notes.
That is not to say that Crosby and Nash
can't rock on acoustic guitars, as this
album proves.
Recorded live on Oct. 10,1971 at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los An
geles, the 15 tracks of music on this
album range from the magnificent har
monies of the opening track "Deja Vu,
to the sparse brilliance of rarely per
formed songs like "Traction in the
Rain." Utterly stoned on Lebanese
Hash, Crosby and Nash talk and joke
naturally with the audience, and their
stage banter is revealing of the men and
their music. As Nash says, they are "in
rare form."
