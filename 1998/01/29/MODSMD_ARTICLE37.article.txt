## Moja and Silten cover Stanford's Walls 
### Meredith Alexander 
One can hardly imagine two artists as
distinctly different as Peter Silten and I
Mad£ Moja. The contrast between these
two artists now sharing an exhibit at the
Stanford Art Spaces may startle you, but
do not let it scare you away. While Sil
ten's canvasses present the harmonies of
abstract, geometric forms, Moja's work
harkens back to traditional imagery of
living creatures and their natural envi
ronments.
What both artists share is a life-long
passion for inventing variations on their
themes, and despite the difficulties in
herent in viewing them together, both
artists deserve more than a glance as you
pass through the Center for Integrated
Systems, the Gates Building, Terman
Engineering and the Humanities and
Sciences Buildings where they are cur
rently on display.
Both Silten and Moja started explor
ing art very young, under the influence

of their fathers.
SiJten was born and raised here in
Palo Alto, and his Bay Area youth was in
fused with an interest in art partly in
spired by his graphic-designer father. As
a young man, the desire to pursue art
sometimes obscured his desire to do

homework. He explained, "In college, I
was ostensibly a history major. But 1
spent most of my time doing art. I didn't
have any formal training, but it was
through that process that I developed
my own techniques."
Experimenting with "repetitions and
patterns," Silten avoided formal training
in order to create his own style. He sees
himself in the tradition of M. C. Escher,
an artist who used geometry to its fullest.
Some of the lithographs on display bear
a striking resemblance to Escher's work
in "Black and White Crosses," a square
piece composed of variations on the
cross motif, Silten is able to balance the
flatness of these geometric shapes with
an illusion of depth. This technique was
important to Escher and remains an en
gaging way of playing with space.
Other pieces, like "Black and White
Boxes No. 1," do not create the same
feeling of depth, but their patterns draw
the eye into their complexities.
Silten's work gains more depth from

his own biography. In addition to pro
ducing these precise, painstakingly
hand-made paintings and lithographs,
he is also a criminal defense lawyer. Rep
resenting people accused of extremely
serious crimes preoccupies much of Sil
ten's time but not all of his energies. This

high-stress career allows him to pursue
art without making it a business.
Although he is sometimes asked
whether his art was done with a comput
er, Silten said, "I don't know whether to
take that as a question or an insult." He is
not interested in using computers, he
said, because for him "the creative
process is what's important. It's like
climbing to the top of Mount Everest
rather than taking a tram to the top."
Often Silten's work, which has been col
lected into a limited edition book by Bar
bara Luck, takes him months to com
plete.
Moja could never be accused of try
ing to take a quick way out, because his
paintings abound in incredible detail.
Moja came to the Bay Area from the vil
lage of Batuan on the island of Bali, in In
donesia, but like Silten he has done art
from a very early age. His father, I Made
Budi, was a well-known village artist
who worked in the traditional Chinese
watercolor style. Moja first studied with

his father. After attending a special
school for the arts, Moja began to exhib
it, first in Bali and later in Malaysia and
Switzerland.
According to Moja, his work "is in
spired by the background of my culture,
the culture and religion there in Bali."

H is works combine an interest in realism
— his portrayals of animals can be quite
accurate, as in "Iguana"—with the spir
itualism of Hindu myth.
Some of the paintings on display, like
"Dancers," illustrate Moja's attempts to
stylize the human form. The women's
elongated limbs seem to lack mass or
depth. He also captures traditional
scenes, like "Batuan Village," even bet
ter. The combination of a detailed back
drop of foliage, mountains and clouds
with the scene of men and women and
children engaged in daily activities
makes for a lively portrait of Moja's
homeland.
Overall, the smaller, more colorful
paintings draw the viewer's attention
better and present a more unified aes
thetic. Moja's talent lies in the details; his
intricate flowers and the birds that play
in them, for example, mirror medieval
marginalia in wit and charm.
This is not an easy exhibit to absorb.
Surrounded by offices and cubicles in
habited by Stanford faculty and staff, the
paintings are not displayed in the mast

friendly of spaces. In addition, the artists
emerge from two opposite artistic tradi
tions, one modern and Western and one
traditional and Eastern. The gap be
tween the two is too huge to produce a
fruitful exchange, but each artist can be
appreciated in his own right at the Stan
ford Art Spaces.
