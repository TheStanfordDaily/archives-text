## Mucho mystery in "When Last Seen Alive" 
### Katie Young 
As a private investigator, Aaron
Gunner is accustomed to guns, drugs,
and corrupt business. He can pin a tail
on anyone, whether politician or
prostitute, and has more informants
than the LAPD. But when he's hired
to track down a man who never re
turned home after the Million Man
March in Washington, D.C., Gunner
learns more than he bargained for.
Knee-deep in the shady dealings of
south-central Los Angeles, Gunner
discovers that his target, Elroy Cov
ington, is actually Thomas Selmon, a
crooked ex-reporter living under a
false identity.
Finding himself face to face with
old enemies, FBI agents and an elusive
gang of political extremists known as
Defenders of the Bloodline, Gunner is
forced to grapple with personal and
professional decisions while the lives
of his friends and clients hang precar
iously in the balance. Not to mention
his chance of developing a romance
with Selmon's seductive sister.
In his fifth Aaron Gunner mystery,
"When Last Seen Alive" (Putnam
Publishing Group, $22.95), Gar An
thony Haywood weaves an intriguing
tale of the private investigator's latest
exploits. Though longtime fans are
sure to enjoy Haywood's references to

past Gunner novels, "When Last Seen
Alive" contains enough explanation
that newer readers won't feel out of
the loop. (Those who want to read
about Gunner's escapades from their
beginning should sink their teeth into
"Fear of the Dark," Haywood's first
Gunner mystery, which was pub
lished in 1988.)
A noteworthy aspect of Hay
wood's writing is the ease with which
he blends social commentary into his
characters' thoughts and dialogue.
Considered by some critics to be one
of America's most talented modern
African-American novelists, Hay
wood uses the middle-aged gumshoe
Gunner to give his readers a glimpse
of big-city street life through the eyes
of an African-American male. In ad
dition, the majority of Haywood's
characters, except for the most pe
ripheral, are African-American. By
frugally employing race-related com
ments, the author is able to strength
en their impact and prevent his novel
from putting readers of other races on
the defensive.
The novel's sole downfall is that it
is not exceptionally well-written.
Though the dialogue is pleasantly
fast-paced and realistic, the rest of
"When Last Seen Alive" is cluttered
with over-explanation of past events,
poor sentence structure and

metaphors strewn about with such
frequency that their effectiveness is
lost. Stylistically, it is comparable to
William Bernhardt's legal series fea
turing defense attorney Ben Kincaid.
Even so, these shortcomings do
not outweigh the dynamic plot, and
should deter only the pickiest of read
ers. By keeping the storyline flowing,
Haywood is able to avoid the Gr
isham-like predictability to which
many modern mysteries and legal
thrillers fall prey.
Haywood's characters each have a
distinct vitality that distinguishes
them from the stereotypical assassins,
washed-out ex-cops and parrot-like
sidekicks that tend to stain the pages
of less interesting mysteries. Though
he introduces a greater number of
characters than would ordinarily be
advisable in a relatively short novel,
Haywood's ability to develop them
uniquely allows each to stand on his
own and spares the reader any confu
sion.
Overall, Haywood's latest is an
easy, comfortable read. It contains
enough action to be exciting, enough
humor to be amusing and enough
plot twists to be interesting. It may not
be Hemingway or Dickens, but for
readers seeking a good book of the
week to keep on their night stand,
"When Last Seen Alive" is a solid bet.
