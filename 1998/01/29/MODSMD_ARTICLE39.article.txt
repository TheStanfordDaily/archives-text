# The 						Size of Watermelons

### Catherine Quinones Editorial staff 
Director Kari Skogland's debut fea
ture film, "The Size of Watermelons"
will be in the Maverick Competition at
the San lose Film Festival Cinequest this
weekend. The film has already made a
splash at the off-Sundance film festival
"Slamdance," among others. With its

Gen X angst and self-deprecatory
humor of the Kevin Smith variety,
"Watermelons" will turn some heads.
It's the usual indie flick routine —
shot in 12 days on a shoestring budget,
it incorporates just enough vomit-in
ducing camera work to make sure you
know that this is a down-to-earth flick
because human hands held the camera
much of the time. No complicated dolly

or crane shots. No gloss and no glam
our. Well, maybe a little bit of glamour:
lone Skye (the chick in bed with Rob
Lowe in "Wayne's World") is in it and
Adam West, TV's Batman, makes a
cameo. But that's as glamorous as it
gets.
But this flick doesn't need glamour.
It doesn't pretend to be anything that
it's not. It's just funny in a low-key,
sometimes low-brow, sort of way. It's a
slice-of-life look at a bunch of losers
while they go to art school, run a comic
book store or just get drunk in Venice
Beach. Losers seem to come out of the
woodwork, or graffiti rather, but two of
them decide that they have "balls the
size of watermelons" and can therefore
pull themselves out of their pointless
existence.
Alex (Paul Rudd), a slacker who is
always getting beaten up, determines
that he has talent and should showcase
it by making a film about his friend
Gnome (Donal Logue), a complete slob
that is running for president just so that
he can liberate Hawaii if he wins.
The two manage to round up the
help of a couple of film students and
three of their friends — Maggie (Skye)
who is Alex's girlfriend; Patrick (Dono

van Leitch - Skye's real-life brother), a
singer in a band; and Elizabeth (Maris
sa Ribisi), a singer-grrl with freakishly
orange hair. Come to think of it, she'd
make a great Spice Girl. If Spice Girls
can be referred to as "great" in any
sense.
Talking about making their black
and white political documentary, the
group makes itself feel important
enough, but when it comes time to ac
tually roll the cameras, it turns out that
certain members of the group might
not be as ballsy as they think. And the
hubris of Gen X comes to the surface:
When it comes to dreaming, there's no
problem. When it comes to doing, the
insecurities formed by a suburban up
bringing put a stopper on ambition. As
Alex states in his "Wonder Years"-
esque narration, the kids in his neigh
borhood that used to beat him up actu
ally just "wanted to kill their parents for
raising them in the suburbs."
"The Size of Watermelons" has its
moments and will definitely bring a
smile to your face. You can't help but
identify with Alex, the consummate
outsider that's always getting licked. Al
though it's yet another director's take
on Generation X, it manages to take

some of the good and some of the not
so-good aspects of the genre — the too
quirky characters, the struggling musi
cian and / or artist and / or comic in
dustry-related person (rememhe
"Chasing Amy"?), relationship di.sap
pointments and shaky camera work —
which results in a fresh piece of work.
