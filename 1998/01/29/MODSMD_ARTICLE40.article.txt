## It's not just Lesbian Theater, It's Ballistic The Luna Sea Women's Performance Project January 9-10, 16-17 Ballistie Femme 
### Ilana Mantell 
You can walk into any theater and
see a mere show, but few can compare
with Luna Sea's raw energy. One of
very few lesbian-oriented theaters in
the country, Luna Sea Women's Per
formance Project was founded in 1994
by two low-income, lesbian women as
a multi-racial women's arts organiza
tion with a commitment to diversity.
The theater operates as a "safe
space" for community-based perfor
mance — meaning it provides an eco
nomical forum for different directors
to produce their work without cen
sure. It's unique because the women
who perform there have a sense of
ownership, and because it provides op
portunities to women who might oth
erwise be excluded from the theater.
"1 found this new love, directing,
and Luna Sea allowed me to develop

it," said Artistic Director Veronica C.
Combs. Actors write from their experi
ences and bring their true selves to the
stage — "I just take their stories and try
to enhance them for the audience so
they can have an even greater impact,"
said Combs.
While she has been involved in the
performing arts for her entire life,
Combs feels that Luna Sea is special be
cause the lesbian community and the
artistic community come together to
create a place where "people feel they
can do and be and perform how and
what they want to. They have the free
dom to create art without the pressures
of other theaters, where you can't al
ways say what you want, (and where]
you can't take oft your clothes. You feel
your work is being stepped on, you feel
censored."
That philosophy of creative free
dom sounds great in theory, but you're

probably wonder
ing if it works in
practice. As with
any theater that in
vites experimenta
tion (and where the
actors are allowed
to take off their
clothes), sometimes
it does work and
sometimes it
doesn't. Some
shows make one
quake with recogni
tion, feeling grateful
that there are writ
ers and actors de
voted to making
sense of lesbian life
and doing it well;
others don't.
Luna Sea's two
most recent pro
ductions, "Ballistic
Femme" and "Liq
uid Fire," highlight
this inconsistency.
"Ballistic Femme"
was banal and not
that femme. My
roommate and I
spent the first hour
trying not to laugh
and the second
hour trying not to
snore. I don't blame
Combs completely,
but I think that
Luna Sea should

implement some type of quality
control. It seems that Combs is
just sticking with the mandate
of 'providing a safe space for
artists to present their work.' A
more apt title would have been
"Lady in Lingerie Writhing on
Floor and Telling Personal Sto
ries in a Way that Makes Audi
ence Members Become Increas

ingly Intolerant of Performance
Artists."
The brochure had also promised
that playwright and performer Marie
Cartier would "dive into the wet and
wild world of the butch / femme dy
namic and its 'persistent desire.' Can
two femmes get it on outside of a Play
boy centerfold? Why are drag queens
and femmes such good friends — is it
just about nail polish? What is the
butch test? ... Come laugh, cry, talk,
get angry, and a little hot and both
ered." Well, I didn't cry, and 1 only
talked to the bored people sitting next
to me. I got angry for the wrong rea
sons, and 1 was bothered but definitely
not hot. I'm still wondering what the
butch test is.
After that debacle, I wanted a sense
of closure to what had been a long and
ultimately disappointing
theater / viewer relationship, so I went
to see Luna Sea's performance of "Liq
uid Fire." Surprisingly, the intensity of
this show and reminded me of Luna
Sea's amazing potential.
In her Director's Notes for "Liquid
Fire," Combs writes that, "this show is
dedicated to the memory and spirit of
Audre Lorde. I came upon her piece,
"The Uses of the Erotic / The Erotic As
Power" ... and immediately realized
that this is who I am. .. [and that) I'm
not the only one. That all of us possess
the power of the erotic within us. We
must tap into this innate power for it
enables us to live rich and passionate
lives."
That might sound cheesy to you,
but it was a very intense experience.
I'm not saying that every minute was
great, because the actual words of the
script were not that brilliant or origi
nal. But the performers said them with
a truthfulness and vulnerability that
broke through this jaded critic's cool
facade. I wasn't prepared for the extent
to which they revealed themselves,
both physically and emotionally, and
there were times when I felt it was too
raw, too much for me to handle. It was
like the bright light of a Xerox machine
that makes you turn away for fear of
going blind.
The performance began with
women lighting candles and drum
mers whose versatile maneuvers elicit
ed cat calls from the audience. Four
African American women in skimpy
dresses slinked on-stage chanting,

"erotic, erotic," like a mantra. At first,
their sensual gyrations recalled the typ
ical B-movie stripper dance, except
that the audience was all women. But
then, one of the dancers, a large
woman who, shall we say, defied con
ventional notions of the ideal female
body, started dancing apart from the
others, and I found myself in awe of
her. Here was a big woman who was
not only unapologetically proud of her
body, she wanted everyone else to
know how sexy she was. And she really
was.
The performers of "Liquid Fire" are
probably very different from myself.
Most of them are working class and
African American, yet my sense of
being able to relate to their experiences
was a testament to the transcendent
power of their performances.
After the show, 1 wandered back
stage to talk with the cast members.
Yolanda Noriega, one of the drum
mers, best summed up their senti
ments when she said that "this perfor
mance was extraordinarily empower
ing— it is one of the few venues for les
bians of color. 1 think that erotica needs
to be spoken, and it is done so very elo
quently here. 'Liquid Fire' empowers
my womanhood as well as helps me
feel more comfortable with mv sexual

ity. These women are amazing and I
am honored to perform with them."
While it's true that consistency is
not Luna Sea's strongest point, the
group's performances often feature vi
tality and ingenuity. This raises the fol
lowing questions: Is it fair to demand
that a young, non-profit theater has
amazing performances every time?
And does it need to be consistent in
order to be effective?
I don't have definitive answers, but
1 am convinced that if you attend
enough of Luna Sea's shows, you
might be a witness to something sa
cred.

Floor and Telling Personal Sto
ries in a Way that Makes Audi
ence Members Become Increas

ingly Intolerant of Performance
Artists."
The brochure had also promised
that playwright and performer Marie
Cartier would "dive into the wet and
wild world of the butch / femme dy
namic and its 'persistent desire.' Can
two femmes get it on outside of a Play
boy centerfold? Why are drag queens
and femmes such good friends — is it
just about nail polish? What is the
butch test? ... Come laugh, cry, talk,
get angry, and a little hot and both
ered." Well, I didn't cry, and 1 only
talked to the bored people sitting next
to me. I got angry for the wrong rea
sons, and 1 was bothered but definitely
not hot. I'm still wondering what the
butch test is.
After that debacle, I wanted a sense
of closure to what had been a long and
ultimately disappointing
theater / viewer relationship, so I went
to see Luna Sea's performance of "Liq
uid Fire." Surprisingly, the intensity of
this show and reminded me of Luna
Sea's amazing potential.
In her Director's Notes for "Liquid
Fire," Combs writes that, "this show is
dedicated to the memory and spirit of
Audre Lorde. I came upon her piece,
"The Uses of the Erotic / The Erotic As
Power" ... and immediately realized
that this is who I am. .. [and that) I'm
not the only one. That all of us possess
the power of the erotic within us. We
must tap into this innate power for it
enables us to live rich and passionate
lives."
That might sound cheesy to you,
but it was a very intense experience.
I'm not saying that every minute was
great, because the actual words of the
script were not that brilliant or origi
nal. But the performers said them with
a truthfulness and vulnerability that
broke through this jaded critic's cool
facade. I wasn't prepared for the extent
to which they revealed themselves,
both physically and emotionally, and
there were times when I felt it was too
raw, too much for me to handle. It was
like the bright light of a Xerox machine
that makes you turn away for fear of
going blind.
The performance began with
women lighting candles and drum
mers whose versatile maneuvers elicit
ed cat calls from the audience. Four
African American women in skimpy
dresses slinked on-stage chanting,

"erotic, erotic," like a mantra. At first,
their sensual gyrations recalled the typ
ical B-movie stripper dance, except
that the audience was all women. But
then, one of the dancers, a large
woman who, shall we say, defied con
ventional notions of the ideal female
body, started dancing apart from the
others, and I found myself in awe of
her. Here was a big woman who was
not only unapologetically proud of her
body, she wanted everyone else to
know how sexy she was. And she really
was.
The performers of "Liquid Fire" are
probably very different from myself.
Most of them are working class and
African American, yet my sense of
being able to relate to their experiences
was a testament to the transcendent
power of their performances.
After the show, 1 wandered back
stage to talk with the cast members.
Yolanda Noriega, one of the drum
mers, best summed up their senti
ments when she said that "this perfor
mance was extraordinarily empower
ing— it is one of the few venues for les
bians of color. 1 think that erotica needs
to be spoken, and it is done so very elo
quently here. 'Liquid Fire' empowers
my womanhood as well as helps me
feel more comfortable with mv sexual

ity. These women are amazing and I
am honored to perform with them."
While it's true that consistency is
not Luna Sea's strongest point, the
group's performances often feature vi
tality and ingenuity. This raises the fol
lowing questions: Is it fair to demand
that a young, non-profit theater has
amazing performances every time?
And does it need to be consistent in
order to be effective?
I don't have definitive answers, but
1 am convinced that if you attend
enough of Luna Sea's shows, you
might be a witness to something sa
cred.
