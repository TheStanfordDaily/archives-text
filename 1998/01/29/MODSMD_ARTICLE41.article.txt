## Iris Chang's "The Rape of Nanking" 
### Eric Leventhal Contributing writer 
The Rape of Nanking should be remembered not only for the num
ber of people slaughtered but for the cruel manner in which many met
their deaths. Chinese men were used for bayonet practice and in decap
itation contests. An estimated 20,000-80,000 Chinese women were
raped. Many soldiers went beyond rape to disembowel women, slice off
their breasts, nail them alive to walls. Fathers were forced to rape their
daughters, and sons their mothers, as other family members watched.
Not only did live burials, castration, the carving of organs and the roast
ing of people become routine, but more diabolical tortures were prac
ticed, such as hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks or burying
people to their waists and watching them get torn apart by German
shepherds. So sickening was the spectacle that even the Nazis in the city
complained that it was the work of "bestial machinery."
— Iris Chang, "The Rape of Nanking" (1997)
My stare gripping the pages of "The Rape of Nanking" (Basic-
Books, $25), I had to pause every other paragraph or so to compre
hend the full meaning of the acts Iris Chang so vividly and fearlessly
depicts in her story of the 1937 Japanese occupation of Nanking

(now Nanjing), China.
Why have I never learned about this? I
kept asking myself. Growing up in this coun
try, elementary and high school students are
uniformly taught of the horrors that Hitler's
Third Reich inflicted on Jews and other mi
nority groups in Nazi Germany. But rarely, if
ever, is there any mention of the mind
numbingly brutal massacre of over 300,000
Chinese civilians at the hands of the Japanese
army in the six- to eight-week period begin
ning Dec. 13, 1937.
The answer to this question lies less with
the facts of history than with the nature of
the historical process itself. For in denying
any responsibility for, if not the existence of,
the events which transpired in China's an
cient capital, Chang argues that some Japan
ese have attempted to distort the historical
truth of an event that openly discredits the
view of Japan as the victim of World War 11.
We commit a second atrocity, beyond the
scope of the Rape itself, if we choose to ig
nore or forget that these events did in fact

happen just
over half a
century ago.
For
Chang, whose
grandparents
barely sur
vived the
Nanking mas
sacre, the Rape
of Nanking re
mains a
prominent el
ement of her
heritage
throughout
her life.
Chang's par
ents related
stories to her

of the Nanking atrocities from a very
young age — stories so horrible that
they were indeed difficult to separate
from myth. What made the truth of
the whole event even harder to believe
was the sheer lack of historical re
sources available in the libraries.
"If the Rape of Nanking was
truly so gory, one of the worst
episodes of human barbarism in
world history, as my parents insisted,
then why hadn't someone written a
book about it?" Chang writes. Given
such a seeming dearth of source mate
rial, the event remained a memory in
the back of her mind until the age of
26.
It was when she attended a
December 1994 conference on the
Rape of Nanking, organized by the
Global Alliance for Preserving the
Truth of the Sino-japanese War, that
Chang encountered the images which
would drive her to pursue and uncov
er the truth of the event. In the confer-

ence hall of a building in Cupertino, Chang was confront
ed with close-up photographs of just a few of the hun
dreds of thousands of forgotten victims of one of the
worst genocides in human history.
"Though I had heard so much about the Nanking mas
sacre as a child," Chang states, "nothing prepared me for
these pictures — stark black-and-white images of decap
itated heads, bellies ripped open, and nude women forced
by their rapists into various pornographic poses, their
faces contorted into unforgettable expressions of agony
and shame."
The pictures came as a sharp contrast to the carefully
fabricated photographs splashed across Japanese newspa
pers in the 19305, showing Japanese soldiers giving candy
to Chinese children and playing with them in the streets
of Nanking.
As Chang told Intermission, a sense of urgency per
vaded the writing of this, the first full study in English of
the Nanking massacre, for soon the remaining survivors
would be gone, and no one would be able to provide a
first-hand account of the horrors they witnessed.
" I was very concerned about the possibility of this van
ishing from history. I wanted to make sure that the world
knew the truth of the Rape of Nanking. I don't want
something like this happening again," Chang explained to
Intermission.

"The Rape of Nanking did not penetrate the
world consciousness in the same manner as the Holo
caust or Hiroshima because the victims themselves had
remained silent," Chang writes. The primary reason for
this silence, the author reveals, was political: In courting
the favor of the lapanese government, other nations
chose not to try to elicit an official apology from Japan.
The Rape unfolds from three perspectives: that of
the lapanese officers, who subjected their soldiers to bru
tal disciplinary measures to arouse an instinct of hatred
and malice on the battlefield; that of the Chinese citizen
ry, whose trust in the mercy and humanity of the Japan
ese led to their individual and collective slaughter at the
hands of their captors; and, finally, that of the European
and American nationals, who risked their lives to estab
lish and maintain an International Safety Zone in the
middle of the city, an effort that eventually saved more
than 200,000 Chinese lives.
Chang begins by exploring the conditions creat
ed to transform peace-loving Japanese boys into hard
ened killing machines. "That was the most difficult thing
when 1 wrote the book: trying to penetrate the mind of a
Japanese soldier. That's what I find so incredibly scary,"
says Chang, "that these soldiers ... were just ordinary
people."
The military traininc relied on desensitization to

violence and popular reinforcement of the
bushido, or warrior code, of the ancient samu
rai. "Some Japanese soldiers admitted it was
easy for them to kill," we learn from Chang's
book, "because they had been taught that next
to the emperor, all individual life — even
their own — was valueless."
The Japanese military leaders worked
relentlessly to ensure the martial prowess of
their armies, but they underestimated the
time it would take to defeat the considerably
larger Chinese forces. The Japanese adopted a
strategy of organized deception to encourage
their opponents to surrender, promising food
and humane treatment if no resistance was
offered.
The strategy worked. Camps of Chinese
soldiers discarded their weapons and peace
ably offered themselves up to the invaders —
an action that prompted the Japanese to fur
ther dehumanize their prisoners as "ignorant
sheep."
The sheer number of their captives cre
ated a pressing dilemma for the Japanese:
How were they

to feed so many
POWs? Soon,
the answer
came through
from the head
quarters of
Prince Asaka,
commander
in-chief of the
army around
Nanking: KILL
ALL CAP
TIVES.
The carnage
would have
claimed per
haps twice as
many Chinese
lives had it not

been for the efforts of a small group of
foreign nationals led by German busi
nessman John Rabe. A loyal member
of the Nazi party, Rabe came to be
hailed as "the Oskar Schindler of
China." Rabe used his status as a loyal
Nazi supporter to intimidate the Chi
nese soldiers, often roaming about the
city trying to prevent individual atroc
ities from occurring.
The denouement of this travesty
contains what may come to be consid
ered one of the bitterest ironies in
modern history. On returning to their
home countries, Rabe and the other
foreign nationals — those whom the
Chinese hailed as the "living Bud
dhas" of 1930s China — faced cruel
punishment and humiliation for their
roles in the conflict. Most never recov
ered from the psychological trauma of
these events. The Japanese war crimi
nals who were not sentenced to execu
tion during the International Military
Tribunal of the Far East (IMFfE) of

1946-1948, however, spent the rest of their lives in luxury, popular
ly hailed as heroes of the Japanese military effort.
What Chang makes us understand from the beginning is that she
does not intend for"The Rape of Nanking" to be taken as a con
demnation of the lapanese character or cultural values. To do so
would be to deny her readers the truth of this event, which is that "all
human beings are capable of committing these kinds of atrocities
when they're put under the right social and political circumstances."
It is tempting to mentally draw a line between ourselves and those
"others" who would commit these acts of seemingly inhumane bru
tality. But that is precisely the mistake which we too often commit
when we see images of violence and suffering on the evening news.
We need to realize that "they," the perpetrators of these crimes, are
not monsters. "They," like us, are human beings, and it is because of
our humanity that we, too, are capable of such depravity. This is the
message of "The Rape of Nanking": to keep the memory of the vic
tims alive, to understand the circumstances of their demise, and to
accept the responsibility that comes with being human.
Of the lasting importance of "The Rape of Nanking," Chang adds
a few final words: "This is a story that transcends the mere conflict
between the Chinese and the Japanese. This is z cautionary tale
about what we as human beings are capable or perpetrating. These
kinds of atrocities still happen."
