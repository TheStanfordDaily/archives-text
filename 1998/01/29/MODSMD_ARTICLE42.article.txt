## The 						Erratics The 						Erratics 
### 
The Erratics redefines fringe pop music
with its latest release. The vocals, guitars,
drums and bass are not in themselves particu
larly bizarre, but the sound is unusual, fresh
and entertaining as hell. Combining reggae
swank with gentle punk rock and undeniable
groove, "The Erratics" is a real winner.
These guys love to jam, rock out, play their
songs and have a good time, as displayed on the
harder "Everything's Right" and the raw "I
Don't Mind." The Erratics is a prototype club
band.

"All American Jesus" is a low-down rocka
billy western slack-jawed number to tap yer
foot to; but just as soon as the song started, it's
over — and The Erratics have already
launched into its chorus-powered "Grain of
Sand." "Oh, take this grain ofsand /1 place it in
your hand / extend the life of time / the time
that we've lost," they wail.
The guitar solos on the album are dang
magnificent, putting the finishing touch on
each song. They are aggressive, solid and fine
tuned to the feeling generated by the overall at

mosphere of the music. Very well done.
"Johnny Jesus" is a somewhat annoying
'isn't this a Blues Traveller cover?'-ish song, not
unlike "Fence Sitting." The album's best in
clude the skankalicious ska tune "Sense Of
Truth"and "Silver Thorned Princess."
Expect the unexpected from The Erratics.
The music is great to listen to, yet I can't help
but fear that the fun and games show signs of
wearing thin after repeated listenings. The vo
cals are creative and off the wall, but they are
often misguided and poorly executed, as in

"Red Room." There are plenty of trip-ups,
which surely could have been eliminated by a
better producer. Regardless, The Erratics is an
excellent addition to any rock collection, espe
cially for fans of Smoking Popes, Barenaked
Ladies and Butthole Surfers.
Make sure you don't neglect the hidden
track, number 13 on a CD player — it's a
strong jazz song with piano and ad-libbed
drum solos. Hear The Erratics in its natural el
ement.
