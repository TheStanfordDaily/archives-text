The "Good Will Hunting" soundtrack is
great. Usually, when you buy a CD you hope
that six of maybe 15 songs are worthwhile. This
CD, produced by Gus Van Sant, Lawrence Ben
der, Jeffrey Kimball, Liz Heller and Kim Niemi
is definitely a credit to their faculties. They in
corporated the musical talents of highly cele
brated artists whose music truly complements
each other. This music mix really makes me feel
good.
The Capital Records team did a wonderful
job at blending the selections. "Good Will
Hunting" doesn't give you the feeling that you
are being tossed around from one extreme state
to another. All the selections are wonderfully
mastered by Ron McMaster, whose subtlety re
ally makes the difference. The selections defi
nitely mesh well together. The pieces capable of
being good singles on their own make a won
derful blend together. They are beautifully in
corporated.
The musical talents of Elliot Smith, Jeb Loy
Nichols, The Waterboys, Luscious Jackson,
Danny Elfman, Gerry Rafferty, Andru Donalds,
The Dandy Warhols and Al Green are cures for
any blues you may be feeling. Their music is
highly therapeutic. It's fresh and exuberating.
"Fisherman's Blues" by The Waterboys is a
coffeehouse-type mix of folk and swing with ex
hilarating lyrics: "I wish 1 was the brakeman on
a heartland fever train / crashing headlong into
the heartland like a candle in the rain."

The lyrics are sung with a force that really
gets to the core of what they are trying to say.
The musical accompaniment is rich and suc
ceeds in exemplifying the passion of the artists
by playing an active role in its transference. For
example, Elliot Smith's "Angels" is a quiet, mel
low relaxing tune with a good beat. It really
sucks to have a beat and distinct sound that
doesn't coincide with what the performer is
singing.
"Good Will Hunting" definitely gives you a
sense of completeness. All parts of the song
from the beat to the vocal stresses play a vital
role in enriching the music. You should check
out these artists for their music is fab.
The CD as a whole has a mellowness to it
that fills you with a sense of tranquillity. It is a
perfect album to listen to when looking to take
in a little R&R. "Good Will Hunting" is the kind
of music appropriate for cold winter days, con
templating life and small group discussion
gatherings. Most soundtracks seem at a loss for
good material. You usually have long interludes
in which dry pieces of orchestrated crap plays
on and on. "Good Will Hunting" is not your
mediocre movie soundtrack. This album devi
ates from the norm and provides the listener
with music that is really worthwhile. If the
movie is as wonderful as the album, you should
check it out!
