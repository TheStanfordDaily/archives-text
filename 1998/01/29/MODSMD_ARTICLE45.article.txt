# They Could Have Than The Beatles
## Television Personalities 
### 
It is obvious that the Television
Personalities was not referring to
itself when it titled its album "They
Could Have Been Bigger Than the
Beatles." A bland, repetitive, com
pletely unmusical conglomeration
awaits the unfortunate listener
who is motivated enough by entic
ing song titles like "David Hock
nev's Diaries" to pop the CD in a
stereo.
The Personalities present the
sound of junior high garage band
rock — it might be a lot of fun if
you were 12-years-old, saw the
band live and knew every single

person in it. But because I am stuck
listening to the album, I'm 20-
years-old and don't know anyone
in the band, I am forced to judge
the music alone, which is sadly
lacking.
Though the opening track,
"Three Wishes," seems promising
for the first 45 seconds due to the
unexceptional but intriguing in
strumentals, as soon as the lead
singer opens his mouth, the album
is shot. Bringing to mind Oasis'
Liam Gallagher on a really bad day,
the vocalist is not only coarse,
nasal and behind the pace of the

song, but he is also apparently tone
deaf. As if that weren't bad enough,
on several tracks he affects a
strange breathy quality that is
probably supposed to be artsy and
sexy but is actually just kind of
asthmatic.
His supporting musicians aren't
much better. On "In A Perfumed
Garden," we hear, for the first time,
the full range of Personalities'
vocal capabilities. Though I am
usually all for pronounced harmo
ny and multiple vocals, in this case
it is just a matter of having to toler
ate two bad (and unsynchronized)

singers instead of one. Further
more, the drummer doesn't always
maintain a steady tempo, and his
prolific use of cymbals sounds like
static rather than music — though
whether it is due to his playing or
to Velvet Records engineering is
unclear.
Even the unoriginal material
doesn't seem to work for the Per
sonalities. On "King and Country,"
the opening sequence sounds a bit
like the James Bond theme; anoth
er track makes use of a simple and
beautiful Byrds riff. But while
these covers are recognizable, they

demonstrate all the problems that
the Personalities show in its origi
nal material. The presentation
sounds unrehearsed, uninspired,
uninteresting and even untalented.
"They Could Have Been Bigger
Than the Beatles" is definitely a
disappointing effort from the Tele
vision Personalities. Though there
are some songs, for example
"David Hockney's Diaries," which
have potential, the group is simply
lacking as a band. This musical in
sufficiency comes across loud and
clear.
