This is the rebirth of cool.
Who could possibly improve
on the amazing jazz-funk fusion
of the New York trio Medeski,
Martin and Wood?
Guitarist John Scofield.
Scofield's new instrumental
album "A Go Go" is a heady mix
of the Meters-style 1970s New
Orleans rhythm driven groove
and the brainy jazz-funk of the
present day NYC scene embodied
in Medeski, Martin and Wood
(MMW) — a damn good ensem
ble to recruit as your backing
band.
As when The Hawks (who be
came The Band) backed Bob
Dylan on his electric tour of 1966,

the playing of Scofield is matched
and at times eclipsed, particularly
by the abilities of keyboardist
John Medeski. And the rhythm
section of Chris Wood (bass) and
Billy Martin (drums) provide ab
solutely killer grooves time and
again.
But Scofield wields his ax with
subtlety. He reigns in MMW's
taste for freak-outs and free jazz,
keeping to a more steady diet of
solid jams with occasional noisy
interludes such as "Southern Pa
cific," which lays dishes of gritty
blues, free improv and even
quasi-classic rock on a polyester
tablecloth of sound.
The album starts with the title

track, a pimpin', loungy number
in which the guitar and keyboard
counterpoint creates an irre
sistible slink. It then dives into
"Chank," a funky Crescent-City
bass driven groove that magnifi
cently slides from Medeski's
organ solo into Scofield's distort
ed, slightly cock-rock solo. This
groove comes back in the similar
but distinct "Jeep On," a lowdown
mid tempo hip shaker that sup
ports Scofield's tremolo soloing.
"Boozer" is a sultry, sexy
groove that borders on poppy
without losing its grit, while
"Kubrick" drapes an ominous
jungle-sounding backdrop be
hind a tropical, fruit punch

melody. It is sparse and spacey
with tribal drums and a modal,
repetitive melody.
This tendency toward ungain
ly, pseudo-poppy melodies
haunts the cool mellow groove of
"Green Tea." This is perhaps this
album's weakest point — many of
the tracks featuring great grooves
by Martin and Wood take their
time to warm up past the pre
dictable and unfortunate
melodies to the uniformly excel
lent improv stages.
The album continues with
"Hottentot," a tough bluesy
romp, and the Crescent City
funk-rock of "Chicken Dog,"
which features fantastic low-reg

ister bombs dropped by bassist
Wood. "A Go Go" then ends with
"Deadzy," a dissolving freak-out
that is slower and softer than the
rest of the album. It's an interest
ing choice to pick for the album
closer, but it just feels weird.
There are some interesting
facts about "A Go Go" 's produc
tion that perhaps illuminate its
weaknesses; the quartet rehearsed
only five times before going into
the studio and the album was
recorded in three days. So it's a
little off the cuff, and it may not
be "Blue Train." But it is certainly
worth checking out.
