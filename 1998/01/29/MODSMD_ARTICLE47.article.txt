# Great Expectations Album
## Various Artists 
### 
How many classic novels can Holly
wood try to turn into hip, popular movies?
As many as they want, I suppose. But it
seems that these days selling the music that
drives these movies is nearly as important
as selling its new-fangled interpretation of
the plot. Producers are trying more and
more to market an appealing soundtrack
with each new movie, and "Great Expecta
tions" is no different.
My sixth grade English teacher made us
read "Great Expectations," apparently in
an attempt to make our 11- and 12-year
old minds forever despise this Dickens
chap for being so damn wordy. I don't re
member much of the book, but I know if
you had asked me then what soundtrack 1
would envision for a movie version of it, I
wouldn't have picked this one.
Apparently, the producers wouldn't
have either. Instead of choosing perhaps

more "Dickens-like" music, however, they
chose to alter the storyline for contempo
rary times, transforming Pip the culture
seeker into Finn (Ethan Hawke) the lust
ing, sexually frustrated artist. Luckily, this
version fits the music more appropriately.
Putting Tori Amos, Duncan Sheik, Poe,
The Verve Pipe and The Grateful Dead to
gether on one soundtrack seems a strange
if not inappropriate mix of musical styles,
but it works well in creating a complete
and solid album.
The intro music of "Siren," performed
by Tori Amos, starts the album, setting the
sad, introspective mood featuring the per
former's famed harpsichord skills in creat
ing an eerie tune.
New band Mono brings a flowing and
soft tune which, when combined with the
sexual tension of TV previews, does very
well in setting the tone of angsty dissatis

faction that Hawke no doubt brought to
this movie from previous efforts.
Even the lyrics of the songs fit the mood
of the story. The Verve Pipe wail strife-rid
den vocals on "Her Ornament": "I just
want to be her exploitation and abbrevia
tion / 1 just want to be her ornament."
And on "Walk this Earth Alone," anoth
er spooky but entrancing tune, Lauren
Christy vents her frustration: "You're in
the fire in my belly/The fucked up way
I'm feeling."
Scott Weiland, former singer for Stone
Temple Pilots, puts in a playful but down
trodden tune with "Lady, Your Roof Brings
Me Down." Reminiscent of the Doors' "Al
abama Song," it's backed by a waltz rhythm
and more troubled vocals.
