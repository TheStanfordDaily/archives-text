# Great Expectations Score
## Various Artists 
### 
The intro theme song, "Finn," and the
Spanish love song "Besame Mucho" ("Kiss me

a lot") share spots on both the album and the
score, but the rest of the music on the score
hails from the background orchestral arrange
ments for the movie.
This is not a typical movie score by any
means. Encompassing everything from pure
ly symphonic melodies to instrumental vocal
ization to techno beats and opera-style
singing, this collection of songs crosses and
mixes a wide range of musical forms, while
staying relatively cohesive as an album. The
songs are short and mostly instrumental, but
they flow into each other well enough that the
album doesn't seem choppy.
Some songs even play off each other's
themes. "Kissing in the Rain" features heavy
harpsichord beats, building momentum with
an add-in drum beat, top hat and powerful,
wordless vocals. This song sets a melodic
theme that gets repeated in other songs
throughout the album.
"A Walk in the Park" plays out as a beauti
ful guitar ballad, including full strings accom
paniment and sweetly sung vocals.
Kiri Te Kanawa gives a sampling of opera
on "1 Saw No Shadow of Another Parting," a
floating and moving aria that hits hard from

the higher registers.
For the most part, the score sticks with
slow, melancholy singing and walking-paced
beats, But the last three songs are a little differ
ent.
A cute, lounge-singer-esque "Besame
Mucho" keeps the same retracted speed as the
previous tunes, but it sports a more straight
forwardly romantic tone.
And in a completely different song, "By the
Inch or By the Hour," a jazzy swing beat backs
the improvisation of piano in a chilled, dark,
smoky room of a song. It's not hard to envi
sion an underground jazz club in San Francis
co while listening to this song, but it is a chal
lenge to imagine where it comes into the
movie.
Finally, in the big band version of swing,
"The Big Trip" rounds out the album in a flur
ry of twirling dresses and flashing feet.
Both "Album" and "Score" contain strong
musical efforts, and 1 wouldn't be surprised if
they became as popular as the movie is look
ing to be. And though most will probably pick
up "The Album" for its more mainstream
styles of music, "The Score" is not one to pass

up. The latter will help to make the movie a
success. Not that Ethan Hawke acting oppo
site Gwyneth Paltrow will hurt, either.
