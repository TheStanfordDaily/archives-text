## SPICE WORLD 
### 
Okay, this is really embarrassing,
so let me just say it and get it out of
the way. I just saw "Spice World." I
know, 1 got paid to see it, but that
doesn't make the experience any
less embarrassing for me.
Worse yet, I didn't hate the
movie. In fact, I was laughing the
whole time. So was the person 1 saw
"Spice World" with. And so was the
entire pre-teen population of San
Francisco — the movie's target de
mographic, with a vengeance —
and so were their parents.
It pains me to admit this, but
"Spice World" is actually a hilarious
look at five girls, all mildly talented
singers and slightly more talented
comediennes, who know that their
15 minutes of artificially-induced
fame are almost up. Armed with
this knowledge (and little else),
they're basically having the time of
their lives, and they aren't ashamed
to admit it.
The best and worst part of
"Spice World" is that, whether you
abhor or appreciate that crazy
quintet known as the Spice Girls,
you're going to have to laugh at
some point in the movie — because
the whole thing is one big joke at
their expense. (The question here is
whether or not they know it, and
scary as it may be, 1 think they do.)
It's difficult not to laugh at people
so skilled at poking fun at them
selves. After all, who knows better
than they how lame they truly are?
In one of the movie's funniest
sequences, the girls lament their

being trapped in their
management — and
media-given personas
(i.e. Scary, Sporty, Baby,
Posh and the irrepress
ible Ginger) — and de
cide to switch places.
They spoof each other's
"identities" to the hilt,
complete with ridiculous
outfits and cliched Spice
sayings, in a way no pa
thetic "Saturday Night
Live" skit ever could.
Somewhere in there a
plot apparently exists. I
personally had NO idea
what it was, but 1 think it
was supposed to be along
the lines of "A Hard Day's
Night" on bubble gum,
estrogen and saline im
plants — and minus the
Beatles. Basically, "Spice
World" is just an excuse
for young girls in the au
dience to witness a "typi
cal" day in the life of the
marketing extravaganza
we know as the Spice
Girls. And witness it they
did, complete with ap
plause after "perfor
mances" and whistles
whenever the girls threw
out one of their "Girl
Power" gimmicks.

The fact that the Fab
Five are so aware of their own
ridiculousness poses the critic's
greatest problem in reviewing

"Spice World": Is the movie chock
full of hilariously self-aware irony
or are the Spice Girls just utterly
asinine idiots? (The answer may be

both.) Five stars or one? Trash or
art? Trash? Or art?
I don't know for sure, but I'll tell
you that the 7-year-old next to me

thought "Spice World" was"the
bomb." Hey, more girl power to her.
