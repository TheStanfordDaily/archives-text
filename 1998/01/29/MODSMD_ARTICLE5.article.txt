•vßeing a South Korean student.
Haiti has had to deal with more than
just Flicks in recent months.
"Because of the economic crisis
back home, many Korean interna
tional students are going hack to
Korea because their parents can't
afford tuition anymore," Han ex
plained. "My tuition will be dou
bled because my parents have to
convert Won to dollars ... but my
parents at least have a job."
Nevertheless, the economic cri

Instead of flying home to be with
his family over winter break, eco

er buy a computer last month.
"My brother's college doesn't
have computers like Stanford
does," he explained, "so in order to
write his school papers he needed a

as a guardian of Stanford's cine
matic tradition, as well as of the
entertainment that Flicks brings to
the community.
"The audience wants better
movies shown. They want 110 tech
nical problems. They want to be en
tertained. and they want their
entertainment to be perfect. It's my
iob to secure that for them."
