# The 						Apostle
## 
### 
A guy just knows when it's time to
drive out of town and seek a new life
in Louisiana. For Sonny, a bump
tious and burly Pentecostal preacher
from Texas, that time comes when he
publicly clubs his wife's lover over
the head with a baseball bat. The vic-

Tim, surprisingly enough, keels over
like a man eager to meet his Maker;
and Sonny hits the road as "The
Apostle."
Robert Duvall is the man under
the mask. As Sonny, he is larger than
life. Even his walk is more a bound-

ing gambol
ing celebra
tion of life
than just a
walk. Beefy
to look at
and full of
words —
Man! He's
got more
words com
ing out of
his ears than
the Presi
dent of the
United
States him-

self. When he's up on stage preaching
the Good News, nothing can stop
him: "We're going right up to the
kingdom of Heaven! Sun, get out of
the way! Moon, get out of the way!
Planets! Venus, Mars! Move right
over!"
Is it all just stagecraft? Does
Sonny, heartless, philandering bat
wielder that he is, really practice
what he preaches? Is he right to run
away to Louisiana of all places, leav
ing the due processes of Justice
clutching vainly after him?
Rather than attacking these
painful questions directly, the story
leads us on into Sonny's new life in
the town of Bayou Boutte. Arriving
as a man of mystery he soon strikes
up friendships, and before too long
the townsfolk rally round him to
build a new church. The local radio
station owner, Elmo (played win
ningly by Rick Dial), is a staunch

supporter, and soon the movement
gains force as Sonny takes to the air
waves and wins new admirers.
It turns out that the man behind
the script (and also behind the cam
era) is Duvall himself. His relatively
recent focus on writing and directing
comes after many years as an ac
claimed actor. Perhaps that sets him
up to be the proverbial "actors' di
rector": certainly the cast, especially
in the congregation, play very natu
rally. The bickering women, the
feisty kids, the soulful young appren
tice — they're all there, living and
breathing and joining in on the tam
bourine.
The only exception is Miranda
Richardson, (well-known to fans of
"Blackadder" as mad Queen Bess of
England), whose somewhat pre
cious acting frankly jars.
Duvall himself is very strong, al
though I find it hard to judge a per

formance when I find the character
so unlikeable. That may be testimo
ny to Duvall's artistic honesty. In
deed, Duvall seems to play fair on
many counts. The camera has an air
of respectful, but not reverential, in
terest in things. The script doesn't
waste time trying to excuse Sonny,
and it mostly leaves the preaching to
the preachers on-screen.
Duvall, who also wrote the script
and directed, presents one or two key
scenes where I beg to differ from his
take on life. The real strengths of
"The Apostle" lie elsewhere, though.
The single greatest joy of the film is
that it gives us the chance to sit in on
some high-octane proselytizing:
whole line-ups of preachers working
up the crowd and taking turns with
the microphone, like a well-tuned
jazz band. Now that's a sight.
