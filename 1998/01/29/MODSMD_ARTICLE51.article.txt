# The 						sweet hereafter
## 
### 
Seconds after slamming through a
guard rail, a yellow school bus slides to an
abrupt stop hundreds of feet below, atop a
frozen river. The fragile ice gives way and
the bus lunges downward, killing 14 chil
dren and crippling others.
In another film, this moment might
have been drawn out, romanticized and
bathed with weepy violins and resplendent
cinematography. But not in"The Sweet
Hereafter."
The camera quickly turns to the subtle
trembling of a man whose face looks chis
eled with grief. He has already lost his wife
to cancer, and now his two young children
in this monstrous accident.
This turn from the drama of the acci
dent toward the pain and melancholy felt
by its survivors is characteristic of the film.
Director Atom Egoyan extends extreme
sympathy toward the members of the
small Canadian town who have been torn
by the accident. Each family commands
Egoyan's sincere consideration and com
passion.
To this small town comes a quiet, an
guished man, a lawyer named Mitchell
Stephens (lan Holm). He is a complex
character with a wizened face and diminu
tive frame. At first his motives for wanting
to represent the residents in a class action

suit are unclear.
"Let me direct your rage,"
he implores of the parents of a
child who died in the accident.
Not until we understand that
he is, in fact, directing his own
rage — the helplessness of
having a daughter who is a
drug addict and dying of AIDS
— do we overlook the follies
of his profession and sympa
thize with his pain.
The story more unravels
than unfolds. With seamless
fluidity and intuition, we are
carried back and forth
through time and memory.
This mosaic narrative style
both catches the layered com
plexity of the film and allows
for the poignant juxtaposition
of events that might otherwise
have existed only in the minds
of the survivors.
It is the grief of surviving,
we find, that is the most trag
ic. In"The Sweet Hereafter," a

Browning poem about the Pied Piper is
read, and we are reminded of the lame boy
who is unable to join the others and follow
the piper. A teenage girl, once full of vi

brancy and promise, finds herself in the
same position: paralyzed, bereft and un
willing to accept the life left for her.
"The Sweet Hereafter" resounds with

honesty, sympathy, lament and insoluble
pain. It is a film that you will not soon for
get.
