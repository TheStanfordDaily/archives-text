# Phantoms
## 
### 
Any horror movie that features a
cheerful-looking yellow Labrador as
its primary bad guy has got more
problems than suspension of disbe
lief. The Labrador is not, by nature, an
angry dog. It needs some psychologi
cal effort behind it to be scary, and the
lack of that effort is only one of the
many ways in which "Phantoms" fails
to satisfy the viewer. The film has plot
problems, to be sure, but it's got a

whole host of other hurdles to over
come and fails miserably both as a
horror movie and as entertainment.
The aforementioned Labrador is,
of course, merely an incarnation of a
far more powerful evil, lain dormant
for decades, now returned to slaugh
ter humanity and bore the audience
with long breathy soliloquies. Op
posed against this horrific power —
The Ancient Enemy — are the only
survivors of the 700-person town of

Snowfield, consisting of two attractive
young sisters (Joanna Going and Rose
McGowan), one good sheriff (Ben Af
fleck), and one bad sheriff (Liev
Schrieber), characterized by his ram
pant necrophilia. Subtle, no?
Add to this mix an exasperated
Peter OToole ("Lawrence of Arabia")
as a tabloid-writing expert on ancient
epidemics, and you've got the mak
ings of a pretty poor ensemble perfor
mance. Most of the blame for the

anesthetic
weight of the
movie, though,
has to go to Dean
Koontz, the best
selling suspense
author who
wrote the screen
play based on his
book of the same
name. Koontz
may write some
decent books,
but to hear actors
actually pro
nounce lines like,
"It ate all of the
soft tissue out of
his head — even
the brain!" is
more than
painful.
To be to
tally objective,
"Phantoms" has

its moments, both visual and dramat
ic Schrieber actually proves much
more interesting of a character once
he's dead, and the injection of OToole
into the action proves refreshing, for a
little while. About 45 minutes in,
though, you can actually feel the bot
tom fall out of the movie. Once The
Ancient Enemy has dispatched the
erstwhile Army cavalry, both it and
the hapless survivors have little do but
wait for the deus ex machina to arrive.
When it does, in the form of a petro
leum-eating Army bacteria,

the ending comes as less of a
climax than a relief.
Save for one, startlingly
well-done shot in which
OToole confronts The An
cient Enemy as it inhabits the
silent bodies of the murdered
townspeople, the movie ends
as uninspiringly and as anti
climactically as it began. Even
special effects, the perennial
savior of corny horror
movies, can't save "Phan
toms." Throughout the
movie, the monsters look
cheap and hurried, as if they
were as eager to flee the the
ater as the audience.
Empty of technical flair,
saddled with poor acting,
burdened by mind-numbing
dialogue, "Phantoms" never
gets off the ground. The trou-

ble with the movie is that it's intended
less as entertainment than a philo
sophical treatise. Koontz's efforts to
make this genre flick a commentary
on humanity's ignorance are feeble.
The message is undercut at every level
by the inescapable, inevitable conclu
sion: the good guys win, the bad guys
die. "Phantoms" lacks a shred of ei
ther coherence or originality, and no
big-name screenplay can rescue it.
