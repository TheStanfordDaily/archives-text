## A 						Challenge of Love 
### Zachary Roberts Editorial staff 
This is the end, my friend, the
end. As Volume 212 of the Stanford
Daily draws to a close and I reflect
on what I have learned about this
school this volume, I know that it's
been a different four months for me
than any other I've had at Stanford.
As editors of Intermission,
Cathy Quinones and I have tried to
focus more of the attention on
Stanford and the surrounding com
munity. And I'm glad to say that I
think we did a pretty good job most
of the time. We discovered art ex
hibits in the halls of the CIS build
ing, talked with local musicians and
covered big and small events, from
nationally known speakers to inde
pendent drama productions.

But I learned that there are some
painful things that go with being as
sociated with Intermission. No
matter how good we try to make it,
people are going to leave several
scattered Intermissions around The
Daily delivery boxes. And many
more people pick it up but don't
read it.
I also learned that there's a lot of
cool things going on Stanford that
most people don't tend to know
about. This quarter, for example,
the English Dept. is sponsoring a
series of readings by some of the
most influential poets of the last 20
years. It's free, it's at the bookstore,
and it's brilliant. It's also badly
publicized.
I have heard people complain
(and sometimes feel it is true) that
this school is so focused on math

and science that the arts and hu
manities are given short shift. Take
the facilities for the arts and hu
manities. The sciences get two new
buildings (the Gates building and
the Science Quad under construc
tion) whose combined cost totals
more than $140 million — because
it is the scientists who make the
money and donate it. And the hu
manities get ...? There's plenty of
famous Stanford alumni in the field
of arts and humanities — Ken
Kesey and Larry McMurtry, just to
name two. Why aren't they getting
tapped?
Maybe the University just
doesn't care about the arts that
much.
Ask anyone in the Art Depart
ment and they'll tell you that it is
badly underfunded and scrounging

for paint. If anybody is reading this,
what I'm saying is that sometimes it
feels like I am a token liberal schol
ar at a tech-voc school.
Stanford is a discouraging place
to be a writer or artist, especially
when the Academy is sometimes
against creative experience. For ex
ample, the English Department
once allowed students to write a
thesis in creative writing, but ended
that in 1988. They'll tell you it was
because of lack of demand, but
that's not the end of it.
These are people who have made
it their living and profession to
study creative writing, but they
don't think that the practical expe
rience is worthy of recognition as
an integral part of the experience of
being a scholar in this field. So you
can't do a thesis in creative writing

It's like a chemistry major not
being allowed into the chem lab, or
a computer science student not
being given assignments to write
programs. It just doesn't make
sense.
That's my pet peeve. It doesn't
have to be yours. All I'm saying is
that there is good and bad in the
arts and humanities at this school,
and it is up to us to change it for the
better.
Love what there is, and fight for
more. That's why we work at Inter
mission, and that's what Intermis
sion's coverage has been about this
volume. To all the writers who con
tributed and helped us do it, thank
you. And to all the readers who are
fed up with the state of the school,
we issue you a challenge born of
love: try to change it.
