CHAMPAIGN, 111. (AP)
Far from the embarrassing tem
pest in Washington, President
Clinton was welcomed with thun
derous cheers in the nation's
heartland yesterday as Vice Presi
dent Al Ciore urged Americans to
"join me 111 supporting him and
standing by his side."
"We have had an incredible
day." Clinton enthused. But
before he could fly to his next
stop in Wisconsin, Air Force One
got stuck in the mud taxiing for
takeoff â€” an unfortunate bit of
symbolism for the besieged presi
dent. A backup plane was
brought in.
Buoyed by the rousing recep
tion here and at Ins State of the
Union address, Clinton did not
comment directly on the allega
tions of an affair with a young
intern and a cover-up. But he
might have had his problems in
mind as he joked about the bois
terous music and overflow crowd
that greeted him at the University

of Illinois.
"I wish I could take the pep
band with me for the next month
or two wherever I go," the presi
dent said. I le came here to extol
his education initiatives and his
call for a Social Security fix.
Clinton told the mostly youth
ful audience lie had never worried
about Social Security at their age.
"I thought I would live forever,
always young." said Clinton, now
51.
Passing farm fields and busi
nesses, Clinton's motorcade drew
friendly waves from hundreds of
people. "Fact, not fiction," read
one sign outside the arena. "Kill
the overkill." said another.
In I.a Crosse. Wis., there was a
message in big block letters in the
snow i>n the banks of the Missis
sippi River: "IMPEACH."
All 12.1KK) tickets for the Uni
versity of Illinois event were
quickly grabbed up, distributed bv
the school and Democratic sup
porters. After addressing the uni

versity crowd. C linton and (lore
spoke to thousands of supporters
at two overflow rallies.
A large, enthusiastic crowd also
cheered Clinton at a chilly outdoor
rally in La Crosse. An hour late
because of his plane problems.
Clinton looked out over the sea of
people and said. "This is the best
of America. This is the best of past
and the hope of our future."
The Illinois and Wisconsin
events were arranged before the
sensational allegations broke. Bui
the appearances were tailor-made
for a troubled president trying to
show the world that he still com
mands support.
Clinton's supporters were
eager to back the president. "I'm
just so excited I can't hardly stand
it." said Diane Weidner. who
works at the university. But about
the charges facing Clinton, she
said, "I really don't know what I
think."
She said there was a big turnout
"because it's the president."


President Clinton exhorts the outdoor crowd in Lacrosse yesterday to support his proposals out
lined in his State of the Union speech. The highly supportive crowd cheered often for the president
despite waiting for hours in sub-freezing weather.
