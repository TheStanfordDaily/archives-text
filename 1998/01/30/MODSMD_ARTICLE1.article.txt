hear each other's perspectives," said
CCS RE Director and History Prof.
A 1 ( amarillo.

issues," he said.

ready made reservations for 250
participants from the surrounding
community and are expecting hun
dreds more to attend without reser

"Our intent was to open up the
summit to the Bay Area," said Ca

for the surrounding community as it
was for the Stanford community."
"I'm hoping that we attract many
people from the community," said
Education Prof. Martin Carnov.

who will serve as a panel moderator.
"Palo Alto and Menlo Park are very
insulated from the whole racial
issue. Very few of the people in this
area are quite aware that there is a
big race and ethnicity problem in
this country."

coordinator Elisa Nino-Murcia, sev
eral local elementary and high
school teachers have even request
ed the day off from work to attend

the conference will do."
