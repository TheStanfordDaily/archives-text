Greenspan delivered a strongly
upbeat assessment of an "excep
tionally healthy" U.S. economy yes
terday. lie previewed a best-case
scenario in which the Asian finan
cial crisis slows but does not threat
en America's long economic expan
sion.
Greenspan's sunny economic
views cheered Wall Street, with
investors seeing the remarks as an
indication the central bank will not
feel the need to raise interest rates
anytime soon.
"Mr. Greenspan was a good
friend of the financial markets yes
terday. What he said was music to
our ears," said Sung Won Sohn.
chief economist at Norwest Corp. in
Minneapolis.
The Dow Jones industrial aver
age was up more than 50 points in
late trading while heavy demand for
bonds sent interest rates down.
Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond declined to 5.85 percent, com
pared to 5.94 percent the previous
day.
Analysts said Greenspan's com
ments made them even more cer
tain that central bank policymakers,
who meet Tuesday and Wednesday,
will not feel the need to push inter
est rates higher for some time to
come.

Taking note of current condi
tions. Greenspan said, "It is elear
that the U.S. economy has been
exceptionally healthy, with robust
gains in output, employment and
incomc. At the same time, inflation
has remained low — indeed, declin
ing by most measures over the past
year."
Greenspan said while the strong
growth and tight labor markets had
been threatening to increase infla
tionary pressures down the road, he
believed the Asian financial crisis
would cause U.S. growth to moder
ate to a more sustainable pace.
"Before spring is over, the
abrupt current account adjustments
that financial difficulties are forcing
upon several of our Asian trading
partners will be showing through
here in reductions in demand for
our exports and intensified compe
tition from imports," Greenspan
said.
The Economic Policy Institute, a
labor-backed think tank, last week
predicted that America's merchan
dise trade deficit, already running
close to $2(H) billion, could swell by
another $1(K) billion at a cost of 1.1
million I ).S. jobs.
Asked about that forecast,
Greenspan said every week 3(X).(HX)
jobs are lost in the U.S. economy
but that figure is exceeded by the
number of new jobs being created.
