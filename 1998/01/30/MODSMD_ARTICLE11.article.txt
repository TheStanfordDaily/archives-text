Crackdown on child labor
WASHINGTON (AP) — President C linton will
ask for million in additional funding to help
enforce child labor laws when he presents his budget
to Congress next week, adminlsfration'officials said
yesterday.
The money would fund a program aimed at
strengthening the enforcement of child labor laws in
the United States and overseas. I he program calls
for hiring additional investigators, boosting educa
tional funds for migrant children and increasing glob
al support for an international foundation against
forced child labor.
Clinton briefly referred to the initiative during his
State of the Union address Tuesday night but pro
vided few details, saying only that he would "send
legislation to Congress and ask other nations to join
us to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all
abusive child labor."
The initiative calls for a $27 million increase in the
U.S. contribution to the International Programme
for the Elimination of Child Labour. The United
States gave the organization $3 million last year.
Another $355 million would go to a federal
migrant education fund — a $50 million increase
over last year that would serve 7().(XK) to HX).(KH)
migrant children in addition to the 55(),(KK) to h(H).(MH)
who are served now.The Labor Department would
get $4 million to hire 36 new investigators to enforce
child labor laws, and $5 million would go toward set
ting up a pilot job training program for youths.
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said the initiative
allows the department to make fighting child labor a
priority and to help children who "are stuck in the
workrooms instead of studying in the classrooms."
Sen. Tom Harkin. D-lowa. commended the
administration for urging other countries to crack
down on child labor abuses but he said Americans

must lead by example.
"If we're going to be the leaders of the world, we
have to make sure our own back yard is clean." he
said.
I larkin said while he expects both Democrats and
Republicans in Congress to support the initiative, he
believes it could be a "ripe target" because it repre
sents a 9(H) percent increase over last year's funding
for child labor programs.
Microsoft maneuvers in court
WASHINGTON (AP) Microsoft Corp. urged
a federal appeals court yesterday to overturn a low er
court's ruling that it separate its Internet Explorer
software from its Windows 95. saying the Justice
Department's case is fundamentally flawed.
In the latest move in the complex legal battle,
Microsoft is arguing the Justice Department's lawsuit
last October was based on a misreading of a 1995
court agreement aimed at preventing the company
from engaging in anti-competitive business practices.
Microsoft argued the 1995 agreement "explicitly
preserves Microsoft's freedom to develop "integrated
products"' such as blending Internet Explorer into
Windows 95.
"The principle at stake in this case is whether
Microsoft — and every other software company
has the right to continually improve its r »ducts and
add new innovations for consumers." K> bert Her
bold. Microsoft's chief operating officer, said in a
statement.
The assertion came in a 51-page brief Microsoft
filed with the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia. Ihe company is asking the
panel to overturn a Dec. 11 preliminary injunction by
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penficld Jackson
that ordered separation ot Internet Explorer from
Windows 95.
