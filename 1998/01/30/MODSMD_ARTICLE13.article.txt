BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)
Iraqis will defend their country
"with expertise, faith and persever
ance" if the United States attacks.
President Saddam Hussein
declared yesterday â€” adding that
there was no reason for the United
States do to so.
While the Clinton administra
tion and Congress were laying
groundwork for possible U.S.-led
airstrikes on Iraq. Saddam was
quoted as saying his army will fight
"in a manner that will he a subject
of admiration."
"They don't have any national
interest or any justification to come
thousands of miles to attack us."
Saddam said. "[Hut] if the devil
pushed these enemies to commit an
evil act and an aggression on us. we
will be forced to fight them with all
our capabilities, expertise, faith and
perseverance... .Their aggression is
against God."
His comments, reported by the
official Iraqi News Agency, came at
the start of Eid al-Fitr. a three-day
holiday that marks the end of the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Saddam spoke as he met with mem
bers of the ruling Baath Party, th.-
Revolutionary Command Council
and his Cabinet, the agency said.
Iraq and the United Nations are
in a standoff over U.N. inspections
intended to ensure that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction. Baghdad was forced to
accept the inspections at the end of

the 1991 Gulf War. and tough U.N.
sanctions imposed in 1990 are
unlikely to be lifted until inspectors
certify the programs have been dis
mantled.
Washington demands Baghdad
provide U.N. experts with uncondi
tional access to any site they wish to
inspect. including Saddam's
palaces, or lace air and missile
attacks.
Russia has had some success in
mediating disputes between Iraq,
the United States and the United
Nations, and Russian Foreign Min
ister Yevgeny Primakov said he is
optimistic a peaceful solution will
be found.
Primakov, speaking in Madrid.
Spain, said a military attack on Iraq
would be "very serious and very
negative."
Primako\ was to discuss the situ
ation with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in Madrid on
today during her visit to Europe to
explain the U.S. position to its
allies.
Her visit was to begin in Paris,
where Foreign Ministry spokesman
Yves Doutriaux declined to say yes
terday whether France would try to
block any U.S.-led air strike. How
ever. he repeatedly called the Iraqi
stand "unacceptable" and an air
strike "undesirable."
Defense Secretary William
Cohen said in Washington that the
United States still was seeking a
diplomatic solution to the impasse.


Rick Krystof of Westford, Mass., signals the launch an F-14 "Tom
cat" from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz yesterday.
The Nimitz is currently deployed to the Gulf in support of Opera
tion Southern Watch.
