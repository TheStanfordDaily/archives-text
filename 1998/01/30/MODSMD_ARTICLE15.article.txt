responsibility by yesterday evening.

said the bomb appeared to be
homemade and not intended to
blow up the entire clinic, it was a
smaller device intended to kill or

injure," he said.
FBI Agent Joseph R. Lewis said
the bomb apparently was in a pack
age, but it was not immediately
known what kind.
A year ago. two bombs went off
an hour apart at a clinic in Atlanta,
injuring seven in the second blast.
That bombing is still unsolved.
Hours after the explosion in Birm
ingham. the surrounding area
remained sealed off while bomb
experts in masks and heavy protec
tive gear combed over it.
"We still have a hot scene. We're
being very cautious because of what
happened in Atlanta," said the
A TP's Brian Lett.
The bomb went off about 7:30
a.m. just outside the main entrance
of the New Woman All Women
Health Care clinic, rocking nearby
buildings at the university and leav
ing a crater outside the blackened,
wrecked entryway. The explosion
occurred as clinic employees were
arriving but about .Ml minutes
before doors normally open to
patients.
"We were shaking We were X)
seconds away from being in that
parking lot." said Terry Hermes,
who was taking his wife. Lisa, to her
counseling job at the clinic.
His wife, who has worked at sev

eral clinics, added: "I hope I can
retain the belief that what I'm doing
is right and not be scared off. After
this. I don't know."
Witnesses said the off-duty
police officer appeared to have
been killed instantly, while the
nurse lay injured in the yard as the
smoke rose from the blast. Her
charred clothes were partly torn
away.
The victims were identified as
Officer Robert D. Sanderson. 35.
and nurse Emily Lyons, 41. Both
were from Birmingham
The police officer "had gotten
off work and he had just gotten
there." Coppage said.
Gov. Fob James, a Republican
who opposes abortion, offered full
state support in the investigation,
saying. "I cannot think of any more
cowardly and reprehensible act."
He said those responsible should be
"tracked down, indicted, convicted
and executed
