## Editorial Editor's farewell 
### 
IN THE MORNING, when 1 get up
and bike to class and see people pick
ing up The Daily, flipping to different
sections, checking out the reflections of
the day's columnist or the wrap-up of the
weekend's baseball game. I feel proud of
the work we do.
I am proud because I spent most of the
previous day in The Daily's chaotic, messy
newsroom, helping my staff edit stories, fix
computers, lay out the paper, brainstorm
graphic ideas and write editorials. Each
day. a stall of more than 50 people help
create The Daily. The staff this volume has
been incredible, and 1 couldn't have made
it though this without everyone's hard
work.
At The Daily 1 have written well, writ
ten poorly, missed mistakes, laughed loud
ly. failed miserably, listened carefully,
cried desperately and explained myself
until I was out of breath. And I leave my
position as editor in chief a wiser person
because of what other students here have
taught me.
I have learned that it is OK even when
everyone is not on your side, and that peo
ple won't always agree. Moreover, stand
ing up for one's beliefs is necessary, and it
is reassuring to know there will be people
who support you.
I have learned that problems are best
resolved when you take responsibility for
your mistakes and concentrate on realistic
solutions.

Most importantly, I have learned that if
you respect people and treat them as
equals, they will respect you hack.
When I decided to run for editor in
chief of The Stanford Daily last spring. I
had a lot of noble goals for the organiza
tion. Reporters with "integrity," more sto
ries that addressed difficult student issues,
color photos, more dynamic sports cover
age. better computer equipment and con
trol over our own design. I focused pri
marily on what my staff and I had to do to
make The Daily the best paper it could be.
Some of my goals I accomplished, some of
them I didn't.
I thought I could give a lot to The Daily.
What I didn't realize is what The Daily
would give to me.
The Daily staff is more than a group of
dedicated people working for a paper they
believe in. Researching the issues at Stan
ford. reporting on them and empowering
our student body with a better understand
ing of our University is only one aspect of
the Daily experience. Sharing a passion for
our work creates a close-knit community
that provides many of us a third home
away-from home. Late nights, long hours
and missed deadlines have brought me
close to a group of talented people who are
more special than anything.
