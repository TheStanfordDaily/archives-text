Not regurgitating Nietzche
In his Opinion column "Overcome the
rut of 'God is dead.'" Jon Servaites makes a
fair criticism of the extremes of lKth centu
ry Rationalism.
Yet he also makes an unfair portrayal of
atheists as "narrow-minded," "very effi
cient at regurgitating Nictzschean criticism,
regardless of whether or not one is inti
mately familiar with Nietzche's works or
can even pronounce his name." This leads
me to question how familiar Servaites is
with atheism.
I have yet to meet an atheist who reject
ed God as an excuse to "regurgitate" Niet
zche. I know many, including myself, who
reject God for the crimes that He and His
beliefs have perpetrated on humanity.
And these crimes are not limited to the
atrocities of past centuries that Servaites
mentions - they are happening today. You
only need to hear that God hates homosex
uals, AIDS victims, minorities, scientists
and the "unsaved" so many times before
you stop feeling like worshipping the guy.
"Oh. but that's not what God reallv
meant." the believer exclaims. "That's false

religion." Well and good. And if that is the
case, why is all of this going on in God's
name?
An atheist approaches the situation logi
cally: there is no God, in which case there's
little point in worshipping Him; or God is
not all powerful, in which case He's really a
finite being just like us; or God is permitting
unimaginable crimes against humanity, in
which case I want nothing to do with him.
Think of it this way; if someone had the
power to stop the Holocaust, and declined,
would he deserve to be worshipped?
This is NOT a criticism of religion
(please don't flame me); atheism is one phi
losophy among many, and I'd be the last to
deny that all belief systems are legitimate,
from atheism to Satanism to fundamental
ism.
But let no one tell me that atheists
arrived at their beliefs through narrow
mindedness. Theirs is the sch<x)l of philoso
phy, which states that Man does not need
God, that if a Supreme Being said to them
"Abraham, I'm God, and I order you to kill
your son," they'd prefer to say "I don't
believe in you."
