## There is a far better thing to be done 
### 
I'M DISAPPOINTED
in you. You only
responded to my
columns when you dis
liked what I said. Even
then, you didn't disagree
"constructively." You
attacked me in rather

droll and uncreative ways that made me
stay up late at night wondering how you
justify your existence to yourselves. You
may have found fault with my arguments,
hut you didn't THINK about what you
found fault with. Though your brain mas
tered the SAT, the thought somehow
never entered your head that other peo
ple's ideas are worth considering.
1 don't understand you.
Why are you not filled with rage when
you realize there are children in the Unit
ed States being taught in bathrooms
because schools are so overcrowded? No
one cries about the unfulfilled promise of
a child. Perhaps you just don't under
stand.
Author Jonathan Kozol writes, "... I'm
just not sure that we don't understand.
Many poor people think we understand
these things extremely well hut acquiesce in
them without much personal discomfort. In
other words, they don't see innocence in
our behavior. They do not think that what
is being done to them is a mistake."
I've never agreed with that notion until
this year. But you know why I do now?
F Because you get drunk on the weekends.
< You blindly aspire to be consultants and
investment bankers. You stick with what
i you know. You just look the other way. or
even if vou don't, vou cover your eyes.

At times, I dislike you.
I can't help it. I'm struggling to figure
out what roles happiness and personal ful
fillment can play in my own life. How can 1
ever truly be happy knowing that others are
not? What sense of fulfillment can 1 obtain
living in a reality without the presence of
justice?
You are the source and the target of my
frustrations because you offer no help in
answering these questions. You apparently
have answered them to your own satisfac
tion quite well. Maybe they never were
questions for you because your definitions
of happiness and fulfillment don't involve
other people. That makes me angry. You
are perfectly content to move forward with
out noticing whom you've left behind.
1 don't know what motivates you.
You organize around strange things.
You set up very active student groups com
pletely devoted to tenuring Gupta and
Sawislak, yet there is no movement protest
ing the administration's overall lack of'sup
port for public service research. Why is it
that public service activities are widely
regarded by faculty as detrimental to their
quests for tenure, but writing books and
presenting papers to colleagues are benefi
cial to that cause?
More troubling is what you don't orga
nize around. Have you become so accept
ing of the ASSI J's incompetence and sloth?
Why are you content to let them play poli
tics and put something on their resumes
that should mean something? They know
they've got you duped, even though some
of them actually believe their positions are
meaningful. It's not best simply to ignore
them while they play their little games.

I sec hypocrisy in you.
You rally in favor of affirmative action
and principles of diversity and multicultur
alism. but you segregate yourselves into
separate dining hall tables, parties and
exelusive student organizations. Diversity
doesn't mean integration. It also doesn't
mean understanding, or sensitivity, or even
tolerance. Did you know that many of your
colleagues feel misunderstood and unwel
come here? Other than Big Game, when
have you felt united with everyone on this
campus in a common cause? Don't you see
something wrong with that?
You have groups that condemn abortion.
You feel so passionately about the unborn,
but that's the only issue you seem to care
about. You harp on issues of responsibility
in your arguments, but you stop there. What
responsibility do you take for the social
inequities that made it possible for you to
come to Stanford while a kid from the South
Bronx never stood a chance? Does the value
of a life end at birth?
I don't know what to do with you.
It's not righl and it's not fair simply to
accept things as they are and to throw your
arms up in frustration while you go off 011
your own merry way. Think about what
you do. Question the underlying assump
tions that guide your reality. Simply
because you were born in the 1970s does
not mean you hold no responsibility for
addressing the legacy of everything that
happened before your existence. Shape up
and act up.
