## No. 4 Card subdued by No. 6 'Cats 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
It was a harsh taste of reality
The men's basketball team's dream season hit a
hard roadbump last night as defending national
champion Arizona came into Maples Pavilion and
ended the Cardinal's unbeaten streak at 18.
The No. 6 Wildcats (18-3. 8-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) used an offensive onslaught in the second half
to pull away from the Cardinal. The 'Cats hit 61 per
cent of their field goals after halltime. and their de
fense threw off the Stanford halfcourt set. holding
them to 38 percent from the floor
Fhe loss gives the Wildcats sole possession of first
place atop the conference and drops the No 4 Cardi
nal (18-1.7-1) into second place in the conference.
It also gives a huge advantage to Arizona heading
into the second half of conference play, having al
ready taken care of the Cardinal on the road.
"1 don't think we could play any better that what
we did.'' said Arizona head coach Lute Olson."This
is a really tough place to play. The crowd was fired up
and into it.
"Defensively Stanford runs their halfcourt of
fense so well and our whole thing to the guys is to
make them make basketball plays, not let them get
their shots off the set offense, make them scramble a
little bit. I think overall we did a good job there."
Indeed the Cardinal offense was off its usual
game. Arizona was relentless in pressuring power
forward Pete Van Elswyk in the high post, which
kept him from hitting open cutters off the wing.

son also kept Van Elswyk from pulling
down the weak side offensive boards,
something that has been key for the Cardi
nal as of late.
"I think the advantage for us potential
ly might have been at the second post."
said Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery.
"Had we been able to get good shots up we
might have been able to rebound the ball.
But Van Elswyk did not have a really good
game as a starting second post and that's
maybe where I think the loss of [regular
starter Mark| Madsen might have been a
little bit of an issue."
Madsen was participating in his first
pregame shootaround since being
benched with a stress fracture in his right
foot before the team's league opener at
Oregon State. But despite chants for Mad
sen from the Sixth Man Club, he did not
play.
Arizona swingman Michael Dickerson
lit the Cardinal for 26 points on 12-of-16
shooting, constantly burning by Stanford
defenders and hitting the pull-up jumper in
the lane or on the baseline.

"They were definitely sinking some
shots, hut we could have played better de
fense," said Cardinal point guard Arthur
Lee. "We weren't playing good team de
fense at all. They we're doing a good job of
penetrating and getting into the paint and
kicking.

Guards Mike Bibby and Miles Simon
were just as effective, both streaking down
the key for easy layins without the hin

Bibby finished with 26 points and 10 as

Simon added 15 points.
"Offensively, the way Michael Dicker

A.J.'s inside presence tonight it was just

The Wildcats led by only three at half
time, but they used a 10-0 run behind five
points by Bibby for a 59-48 lead with 14:15
