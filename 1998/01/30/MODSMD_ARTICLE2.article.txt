## No. 4 Card subdued by No. 6 'Cats

It was a harsh taste of reality
The men's basketball team's dream season hit a
hard roadbump last night as defending national
champion Arizona came into Maples Pavilion and
ended the Cardinal's unbeaten streak at 18.
The No. 6 Wildcats (18-3. 8-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) used an offensive onslaught in the second half
to pull away from the Cardinal. The 'Cats hit 61 per
cent of their field goals after halltime. and their de
fense threw off the Stanford halfcourt set. holding
them to 38 percent from the floor
Fhe loss gives the Wildcats sole possession of first
place atop the conference and drops the No 4 Cardi
nal (18-1.7-1) into second place in the conference.
It also gives a huge advantage to Arizona heading
into the second half of conference play, having al
ready taken care of the Cardinal on the road.
"1 don't think we could play any better that what
we did.'' said Arizona head coach Lute Olson."This
is a really tough place to play. The crowd was fired up
and into it.
"Defensively Stanford runs their halfcourt of
fense so well and our whole thing to the guys is to
make them make basketball plays, not let them get
their shots off the set offense, make them scramble a
little bit. I think overall we did a good job there."
Indeed the Cardinal offense was off its usual
game. Arizona was relentless in pressuring power
forward Pete Van Elswyk in the high post, which
kept him from hitting open cutters off the wing.
