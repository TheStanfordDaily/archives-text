## Irresistible force meets immovable object Arizona's quickness, athleticism wear down weary Cardinal 
### Ben Hur Senior staff writer 
The best defense faced off
against the best offense in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference last night.
The best offense won.
Sixth-ranked Arizona scorched
No. 4 Stanford 93-75, ending the
Cardinal's 18-game winning streak
and giving Stanford its first home
loss in almost two years.
Arizona entered the game as the
league's best scoring team, averag
ing 95.9 points per game. Stanford
came in allowing only 63.4 points
each contest, giving it the stingiest
defense in the Pat-10.
The Card's sudden generosity
was particularly welcomed by Ari
zona sophomore point guard Mike
Bibby and senior swing man
Michael Dickerson. Bibby poured in
26 points, while Dickerson shot 75
percent from the field, and shot an
incredible 91.1 percent inside the

three point line.
Stanford has shut down oppo
nents all year with cohesive team de
fense, something the Card aban
cloned during stretches of last night':
game.
"They were definitely hittiin
their shots," junior Arthur Lee said
"But we could have played bettei
defense. We didn't play good tearr
defense at all."
When the Card needed a stop, i
couldn't get it. Dickerson was al
lowed to consistently drive the lane
pulling up in front of his lone Cardi
nal defender and sinking jumpei
after jumper. No help defense was ir
sight. Then again, the kind of help
the ( ard needed may have been of;
different nature.
"Tonya Harding tried. I guess
that would be one way." Mont
gomery said. "Quickness is a
tremendous advantage. Dickerson
was great, he took us off the dribble
and just jumped over us regardless

of who we had on him."
The Cardinal also suffered from
uncharacteristic lapses in moving
around Wildcats screeners. often
leaving Bibby, Simon, or senior
Miles Simon open behind the arc.
Arizona shot a sizzling 55.6 percent
from three-point land in the second
half.
However. Stanford at least ex
pected to battle Arizona's quick
ness. What the Card did not seem
ready for was the Wildcats' interior
play.
Unheralded Arizona junior cen
ter A.J Bramlett tossed in 12 points
on 4-of-S shooting. But his most im
portant accomplishment may have
been drawing fouls on Stanford ju
nior Tim Young.
"A lot of times our inside guys
don't get the credit that they de
serve." Arizona head coach Lute
Olson said. "They are as much of a
key to us as the perimeter guys are."
Young picked up his fourth foul

less than two minutes into the sec
ond half, and his absence seemed to
open the door tor ;i Wildcat strike
Arizona caught lire, going on a 10-2
run and never looked hack.
Even when Young returned, it
was Arizona, not Stanford, that es
tahlished its interior defense. Excel
lent help defense from the opposite
side post limited Young's effective
ness.
Thev brought the second posi
over and doubled everv time wt
went in." Montgomery s.nd. "The\
did a real good job of weak side helf
defense
For the first time all season, <■
game at Maples Pavilion ended with
silence, except for the cheers ol a tew
Arizona faithful. But for the Card
the season will go on.
" There's a long way to go." Lee
said. " This is just one little bump in
the road for us. "We've got a lot
more games to pla\ We re definite
ly not done yet."

Junior guard Arthur Lee was clearly fatigued by the end of the
evening, having played 37 minutes and missing 10 of his 15 shots.
