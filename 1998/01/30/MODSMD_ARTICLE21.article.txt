## Baseball travels to Fresno for key series 
### Brian Eule Contributing writer 
There is no question as to the
home field advantage Sunken Dia
mond provides for Stanford's base
ball team. Its fans are loud, loyal,
and can be bothersome at times to
the Cardinal's opponents.

The No. 20 Fresno State Bull
dogs shouldn't have much trouble
remembering this. It was only last
May when Stanford defeated the
Bulldogss-2 in the NCAA West Re
gional Final, in front of a standing
room only Cardinal crowd.
Now, Fresno State gets its shot at
showing Stanford its version of a

home field advantage.
"It's very difficult to play there
because of their fan support." said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. whose No. I squad opens up a
three game series with the Bulldogs
(0-0) tonight at Beiden Field. Hav
ing already sold more than 2.000
season tickets this season and broad

casting its games live on a commer
cial radio station, the Bulldogs havt
a lot dI support in Fresno, not u
mention a solid pitching stall
