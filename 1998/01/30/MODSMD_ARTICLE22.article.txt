Despite one of its best offensive
performances of the year. Stanford
fell to Arizona on a buz/er
beater. Hut this lime it was Arizona
State rather than the Wildcats, and
the No. C ardinal (11-5. H-l Pacif
ic 10 Conference)cruised to an Sl
>4 win over the Sun Devils (7-10.3-
5).
But things didn't get off to an ex
ceptionally good start tor Stanford,
and the Card onlv led b\ one, Ib
-15. with 11 minutes. 19 seconds re
maining Neither team was able to
get things going in the early min
utes. but junior guard Regan
Freucn changed all that for Stan
ford.
In just her fourth start of the sea
son. Freuen came out hot. connect
ing on five-of-six shots in the first

halt I'he onh miss came on of her
three attempts from behind the arc.
and Freuen made both of her free
throws to contribute a career-high
14 points in the first half.
"It feels really good," Freuen
said. "I think the more I've been
out there, the more confident I've
felt, and I think that's a big part of
it. They were taking some gambles
because they were obviously dou
bling tin our post players They
were leaving me open so it's my |ob
to hit those shots."
That proved to be the difference
in the first half as Stanford's usual
big guns weren't producing. Senior
center Olympia Scott was on I \ t wo
of-six from the field with five
points, while senior forward
Vanessa Nygaard onl\ played six
minutes because ot toul trouble
and added two points.
Junior supcrsub Kristin Folkl
was also quiet, scoring |ust two
points in II minutes of action. Hut
thanks to the contributions of
Freuen and players such as sopho
more guard Melody Peterson (six
points on three of four shooting),
the Card staked .i 12-point lead at
the half.
"I think Freuen is a little bit of a
sleeper for them." said Arizona
State head coach Charli I urner-
Thorne. "She's been in that pro
gram for a long time; she's learned
a lot. If she misses some easy shots
