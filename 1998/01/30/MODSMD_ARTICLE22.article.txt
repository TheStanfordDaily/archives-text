Despite one of its best offensive
performances of the year. Stanford
fell to Arizona on a buz/er
beater. Hut this lime it was Arizona
State rather than the Wildcats, and
the No. C ardinal (11-5. H-l Pacif
ic 10 Conference)cruised to an Sl
>4 win over the Sun Devils (7-10.3-
5).
But things didn't get off to an ex
ceptionally good start tor Stanford,
and the Card onlv led b\ one, Ib
-15. with 11 minutes. 19 seconds re
maining Neither team was able to
get things going in the early min
utes. but junior guard Regan
Freucn changed all that for Stan
ford.
In just her fourth start of the sea
son. Freuen came out hot. connect
ing on five-of-six shots in the first

halt I'he onh miss came on of her
three attempts from behind the arc.
and Freuen made both of her free
throws to contribute a career-high
14 points in the first half.
"It feels really good," Freuen
said. "I think the more I've been
out there, the more confident I've
felt, and I think that's a big part of
it. They were taking some gambles
because they were obviously dou
bling tin our post players They
were leaving me open so it's my |ob
to hit those shots."
That proved to be the difference
in the first half as Stanford's usual
big guns weren't producing. Senior
center Olympia Scott was on I \ t wo
of-six from the field with five
points, while senior forward
Vanessa Nygaard onl\ played six
minutes because ot toul trouble
and added two points.
Junior supcrsub Kristin Folkl
was also quiet, scoring |ust two
points in II minutes of action. Hut
thanks to the contributions of
Freuen and players such as sopho
more guard Melody Peterson (six
points on three of four shooting),
the Card staked .i 12-point lead at
the half.
"I think Freuen is a little bit of a
sleeper for them." said Arizona
State head coach Charli I urner-
Thorne. "She's been in that pro
gram for a long time; she's learned
a lot. If she misses some easy shots
here and there, it's just a lack of
playing time. T he kid is a player,
and I think they need her to
emerge more down the stretch if
they're going to have a good run at
a championship."
When the second half began.
Stanford was a markedly different
team. The energy level seemed to
rise and so did the Cardinal's de
fensive intensity. Nygaard drained
two threes early on to pump things
up. and Stanford jumped to a 21-
point lead on a three-point from
senior forward Heather Owen with
15:11 remaining.
Stanford started getting the
easy baskets as sophomore point
guard Milena Flores, who finished
with a game-high seven assists,
made several of her signature
length-of-the-court passes for easy
layups. Flores also displayed im
pressive defense, creating bad
passes that were easily picked off
and converted into points.
"If there's anything I like to see
us play well, it's our defense." said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "And it was great to see
our defense be so aggressive and
force turnovers. Milena putting a
lot of pressure on the point guard
and that started the whole defense.
She disrupted their offense and set
the tone for us defensively."

While Flores was setting the
tone, Scott was taking it and turn
ing it into a personal layup drill.
Scott drained a short jumper at the
11:04 mark and then proceeded to
score 10 straight points over the
next 1:47. It seemed like the same
instant replay over and over again
Flores playing excellent defense.
Scott jumping out for the double
team at the top of the key, the ball
getting poked away and Scott off to
the races for the easy two.
By the time Scott was done, the
Cardinal had a 25-point lead with
just over nine minutes to play. And
that's about where it would stay as
Stanford cruised to a 27-point vic
tory and extended its season-best
winning streak to five games.
Arizona State was completely
dismantled by the Cardinal's de
fense which recorded 12 steals and
seven blocked shots. The Sun I )cv
ils shot a miserable 30 percent from
the field compared to Stanford's 57
percent (67 percent from three
point land), as the Card dominated
the weaker Arizona State team.
Scott led all scorers with 17
points and was followed by Freuen
with 14 and Nygaard with 12. Folk I
notched another double-double
with 10 points and II boards.
Next Stanford travels to Lub
bock. l ex., to take on No. 5 Texas
Tech tomorrow at 3 p.m. The game
is part of the Pac-10/Big 12 Chal
lenge and will be aired live on
ESPN2.
