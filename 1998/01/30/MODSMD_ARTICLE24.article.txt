## No. 6 Stanford hopes to stay unbeaten in league play 
### Michaela Crouch Contributing writer 
Following Wednesday's rather unimportant match,
the sixth-ranked Stanford men's volleyball team (3-0,2-
0) looks to add another important Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation victory and keep their unblemished
record.

VOLLEYBALL

■ SATURDAY: No. 6 Stanford (3-0,2-0 MPSF) at No. 13
Pacific (4-1.2-0). 7 p.m.

Tomorrow night, the Cardinal will travel to Stockton,
Cal., to play the 13th-ranked Pacific Tigers (4-1, 2-0).
Stanford and Pacific, along with Hawaii, are tied for first
place in the Pacific Division of the MPSF.
The Cardinal and the Tigers have played many of the
same teams this season, with some similar results. Both
schools have posted victories against California, UC-
San Diego, and San Diego State. One noticeable differ
ence in the two school's records is the result of each
match against Ohio State. The Cardinal defeated OSU
in four games, while Pacific was defeated by Buckeyes in
three.
The Stanford and UOP teams have some overall sim
ilarities. Both schools have a different look this year due
to graduation of several senior starters. IJOP graduated
their starting setter, top hitter and best passer.
UOP will definitely start one freshman, and possibly
even two or three. Their primary passer and outside hit
ter are both freshmen. In addition, UOP's setter is new,
a transfer from Cal State-Northridge. I'he team has
some very talented players, but like Stanford's, they lack
experience.
UOP has a dominant hitter, sophomore outside hit
ter Vladimir Andric, who posted 38 kills and hit .460 in
last weekend's match against SDSIJ. He brings interna
tional experience to the Tigers as a former member of
the Croatian Junior National Team. Andric was also
considered one of the top five recruits in the country and
was named one of Volleyball Magazine's Fab 50.
"Our ability to contain (Andric] will have to do with
the outcome of the match." Stanford head coach and
1997 American Volleyball Coaches Association Coach
of the Year Ruben Nievessaid.
The Cardinal will look to serve receive well tomor
row night, a skill at which thev were successful in
Wednesday's victory over the California Golden Bears.
Also, sharp passing will be another key to Saturday's
match.
"We sideout and have plenty of offense when we pass

the ball well." Nieves commented.
Stanford fans should look, hopefully, for the return of
senior middle bloeker Keenan Whitehurst from illness
and sophomore outside hitter Andy Witt from a shoul
der injury.
UOPisa team that will take advantage of their home
court. Fans are tough on Tiger opponents and make the
environment at UOP's A.G. Spanos Center a ditficult
one for visiting teams. Stanford should not have a prob
lem with a tough crowd, as they have some previous ex
perience in that area, playing in difficult places such as
Penn State.
With a victory tomorrow night, the Cardinal would
break the three-way tie to take sole possession of first
place in the MPSF Pacific Division, as Hawaii is inactive
until February 3rd.
