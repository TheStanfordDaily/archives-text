When the No. 1-ranked Stanford
women's swimming team heads to
southern California this weekend
they will swim two meets, hut one of
the two will have added significance.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
â–  TODAY: N'o. 1 Stanford at No. 14
UCLA, 2 p.m.

The Cardinal will open with a
meet today at 2 p.m. against the No.
14 UCLA Bruins. At the conclusion
of that meet all attention will be
turned toward tomorrow's I p.m.
matchup against the second-ranked
USC Trojans. Last year the Trojans
ended Stanford's reign in the
women's swimming world. The
NCAA ( hampionship trophy, which
had been at Stanford for five straight
years suddenly had a new home:
USC. Ihe Cardinal women under
stand the significance of this meet.
"The USC meet is the big one,"
said sophomore Jessica Amey.

The Cardinal's first meet against
UCLA may be a warmup for the
I JSC meet, but it will still be compet
itive. The Bruins boast several swim
mers who are among the elite in the
collegiate ranks. Keiko Price is one of
the top sprint freestylers in the coun
try and will test the speed ol the ('ar
dinal. Breaststroker Lindsay Liter
ranks in the top five nationally in
both the KM) and the 2'M) yard breast
stroke events. The combination
these individual times with strong re
lays gives UCLA a potent squad.
However, the Cardinal women
should come away with the win. Even
if the swimmers have subpar times
Stanford's depth will prove too great
an obstacle for the Bruins.
I JSCon the other hand, will have
no such trouble claiming a victory if
the ( ardinal women do not pel form
well. The Trojans return seven of
nine All-Amcricans from last year's
championship squad. Not only does
USC have plenty of stars, it has the
depth to match Stanford as well.
The brightest of these stars is ju
nior Lindsav Benko. Benko is the

two-time defending N( AA champi
on in both the 2(H) and the S(H)
freestyle. She owns these events.
Also among the nation's best at
these same distances is Kim Black.
liojan swimmers also rank among
the top 10 in the 1(H) and 2(X) fly as
well as the 4(H) individual medley.
I S( also boasts two All-Amcricans
and an Olympian on its diving team.
To combat such talent the Cardi
nal will need the use of its entire arse
nal As usual sophomore Catherine
l ox will lead the way. Returning to
action after being ill. freshman Misty
1 lyman will also need to come in first
in her races. I hese two should set the
pace in butterfly, backstroke and the
sprint freestyle events.
Junior Elin Austevoll will need
several fine performances to sweep
the breaststroke events. Sophomores
Jessica Amey and Gabrielle Rose,
freshmen Siobhan Croppper and
I auren rhies will all need good races
to provide the ( ardinal with valuable
points m a number of different
events.
The women's diving team will also

be in for its stillest challenge so far
this year.
While the swimmers view this as
an important meet they realize that it
is not the climax of the season.
"Win or lose, we'll come back and
evaluate" said senior Amy Obcrhel
man. "We realize that the more im
portant meets lie ahead."
But by no means is the Cardinal
willing to concede this meet to the
Trojans. Seeking a small bit of re
demption the Stanford women will
be psyched and ready.
" I here is definitely a certain re
venge factor" said junior Alison
Fealey.
While this dual meet victory won't
bring the trophy back, the Stanford
women would prefer not to let the
Trojans make it two in a row. An
other source of motivation for the
Cardinal is that their coach. Richard
Quick, will be celebrating his birth
day Saturday.
He would no doubt like nothing
more than to take a step toward
reestablishing the Cardinal as the
premiere team in the land.
