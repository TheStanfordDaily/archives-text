" The first week we had two gooc
events and last week we had three
good events." said sophomore
Tracey Kohl, who will compete or
the floor for the Cardinal. "We need
to hit all four events to beat Ari
zona."
Cook eventualh wants his team to

be able to score an average of 195 to
1% points but Friday they will at least
have to beat 193 points— Arizona's
score last week against the top
ranked Georgia. Cixik believes his
team can make up several points to
improve on their score against ASU
of 192.77 if they are consistent and
aggressive on the beam.
The uneven parallel bars will be
an exciting event to watch for it is
both team's strongest event. The
C 'ardinal is currently ranked fourth in
the country on bars but Cook thinks
the squad has the talent to be even
sharper. Junior co-captain Amy Mu
rakami led the Cardinal last week in
the event with a score of 9.925.
The Wildcats are led by all
arounders senior I enli Poggemeyer,
freshman Kara Fry and junior Kristin
McDermott. I Friday in the Wild

pion UCLA. Fry competed with a
broken rib and won the all-around
with a score of 38.85. Fortunately for
the ( ardinal. Arizona will be without
top competitors Maureen Kealev
and Heidi Hornbeck due to season
ending injuries. Arizona head coach
and 18-year veteran. Jim Ciault. who
was C<x>k's coach in high school will
be honored on Friday as he is retir
ing.
Friday's match will mark the par
tial return of sophomore Larissa
Fontaine. Fontaine, a second team
Ail-American and former member
of the I S National Team, hasn't
been in full strength and has only
competed on the vault after breaking
her thumb but will compete on Fri
day on the vault and on the beam.
"Larissa is a seasoned, experi
enced competitor and will really help
anchor the beam squad." said Cook.
The rest of the line-up will stay the
same voth all- arounders Monahan
and Murakami leading the way to
what will hopefully be the Cardinal s
first victory.
