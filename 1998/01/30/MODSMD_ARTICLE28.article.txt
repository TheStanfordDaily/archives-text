# Facilities to take over students' bottom hygiene

With the coming of the capital improvement program, the University plans
to end all "Self-Wipe" houses on the Row. "We just want to make money,"
explained Dean of Housing Roger Push, "we're complete whores."
Under the current system "Self-Wipe" houses make it the students' respon
sibility to, among other things, wipe their own backsides. "Although some stu
dents are doing a great job, some simply weren't handling the responsibility and
we thought it was time that such activity be handed over to Facilities," added
Push. "Sometimes students would go into the stalls even when there was no toi
let paper there, that's the sort of thing that facilities can end."
"Thank heavens for facilities stepping in and doing this for me," said Sopho
more Jessica Totes. Totes' statement was later put in doubt when it was discov
ered that she was just one of Push's socks with two eyes painted on. "In no way
am I a sock manipulated by Push's finger and thumb," responded Totes.
Push also sees the end of the "Self-Wipe" system as a launch pad for other
reforms in Row housing. "My hope is that by the year 2002 each house will employ
a staff that will tie students' shoelaces, wipe dribble from their jaw, cut their meat
into nice little pieces, tell students that they won't be excused until they've eaten
their greens and play 'choo-choo the food train goes into mouthy-mouth'."
"The purpose of University education is not just about getting grades and
packing resumes," said Push, "it's about learning that you can pay people of a
lower class to do anything for you. And I really mean everything it's great! In
my house, 1 pay someone to chew my finger and toe nails for me. That's the sort
of service Facilities can provide."
"A penny saved is a penny the University doesn't have yet," said Push when
asked about the considerable financial burden this would place on students.
"Don't think we're going to make money on this, because we are."
