### Krishna Rangarajan 
In the 50th anniversary year of
the founding of the state of Israel,
Israeli author and Political Science
Prof. Ehud Sprinzak addressed a
crowd of more than 50 people in
Tresidder Union's Oak East

Lounge last night.
Speaking on the issue of " The
Quest for Peace and Security ...
from Ben-Gurion to Netanyahu"
Sprinzak asserted that "looking at
the big picture [of the goals of the
Zionist movement] ... Israel is a
strong, sound and stable society,"

and that "the real threats to Israel
are not from outside but from Is
raeli hubris and Israeli extremism."
Stressing the importance of
"magnanimity and good will (to
ward the Palestinians!" Sprinzak
sketched out a leftist Israeli point of
view and was often sharph critical

of current Prime Minister Ben
jamin Netanyahu.
Alter being introduced by junior
Maia Daniels, president of the
Stanford Israel Alliance, Sprinzak
started his speech by noting the pes-
simistic tone that pervades the Is
raeli press and public — a feeling
that "the peace process has
stalled."
But Sprinzak contrasted Ne
tanyahu's situation today with the
problems faced by Israel's first
prime minister, David Ben-Gurion:
five armies intending to invade and
destroy Israel; a "non-existent"
economy; the tremendous influx of
refugees, many of them ravaged by
the Holocaust and no established
political system.
Today, with a strong army, econ
omy and democracy, "All the polit
ical goals of Zionism proper have
been achieved. But some now
[seem to want] to reduce the state
of Palestinians living in Palestine to
human rubble. This is not neces
sary, even if we can," he said. "The
security of Israel does not depend
only on how many acres of land we
control, but in satisfied neighbors."
Sprinzak clarified his view of
what "magnanimity in victory"
meant, supporting the plan backed
by former Israeli Deputy Foreign
Minister Yossi Beilin to annex 10
percent of the West Bank into Is
rael, with the other l >() percent for a

Palestinian state. This can be com
pared to the two proposals current
ly being floated by the Netanyahu
government, one of which would
give 34 percent of the West Bank
territory to the Palestinians, the
other of which gives 4K percent.
Besides the Palestinian issue,
Sprinzak singled out the conversion
bill as particularly significant. The
bill would restrict Jewish conver
sion — and some state benefits —
only to those who follow the strin
gent Orthodox Jewish doctrines, as
opposed to the more liberal Re
form sects. Noting the dangers of
extremism, Sprinzak said, "If the
Orthodox and ultra-right wings get
their way, such a division will be
created in the Jewish community
... that it may split apart."
Sprinzak concluded that "these
are not small issues, and they in
volve risk .... But if we can over
come the challenges of hubris and
extremism, then we are ready to
build a strong Israeli society for the
21st century."
T he speech was part of the Israel
at 50 Campus Lecture Series and
sponsored jointly by the Stanford
Israel Alliance, the Hillel Founda
tion and the Hoover Institution.
The speech coincides with Jewish
Culture Week, which started Mon
day and concludes tomorrow.
