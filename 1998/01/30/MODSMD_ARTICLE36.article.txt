# Clutch shots by Arizona guards spell doom for Stanford
## Dickerson's three the dagger that ends comeback bid 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Michael Dickerson couldn't have
picked a better time to bury his second
three-pointer.
After being up by 15 points in the mad
house of Maples Pavilion, the Arizona
Wildcats had watched Stanford cut the lead
to eight on a three-pointer by David Mose
lev with 5 minutes, 34 seconds left in the
second half.
The Maples crowd was going wild. And
although Arizona coach Lute Olson in
structed his players to ignore the Sixth Man
Club as if there was no one there. Dicker
son could feel the momentum switching.
Thirteen seconds later, the Wildcats led
by 11 and would never look back.
After a 10-0 run put Arizona ahead bv
11 points early in the second half, the Wild
cats matched every attempted comeback
bv Stanford with clutch shots, the bulk of
which were by Dickerson and point guard
Mike Bibby.
Together, the duo scored 52 points and
shot a whopping 70 percent en route to a

93-75 victory over the Cardinal.
"I'm not sure we could play much bet
ter." Olson said after the game. He credit
ed Dickerson and Bibby's play for dis
pelling any Cardinal hopes of a comeback.
Dickerson i> "so hard to defend," Olson
said. "If you get up on him too tightly he'll
blow right by you."
When Stanford's players attempted to
prevent the 6-5 forward from driving to the
hoop, he shot right over them.
Each time Stanford cut the Wildcat lead
to under 10 points, Dickerson or Bibby an
swered. Immediately.
"That's what good teams do," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said. "They an
swered every call."
Bibby said after the game he was suc
cessful at not letting the Maples crowd af
fect his play. Asked about the myriad of
jeers about Bibbv's personal life, Bibby
said. "I didn't even hear them. I heard them
quiet down."
The Wildcats now will face California
on Saturday before returning home to
begin the second half of Pacific 10 Confer
ence play against Washington.

Overall, the Wildcats shot 67 percent
from within the three-point line, often over
the outstretched arms of Cardinal defend
ers.
Bibby, who was very confident about
the Wildcats' chances in the days leading
up to the game, proved his confidence on
the court. Bibby complemented his own 26
points with 10 assists leading to an addi
tional 14 points.
"Anybody on our team can break any
opponent down," Bibby said.
Despite last year's national champi
onship. no one on the Arizona team has
won a Pac-10 title, and that provides the
motivation for the team, Bibby said.
For the Wildcats, it might be tough to
play as perfectly as last night. The starting
five committed only four turnovers and
outrebounded Stanford's starters 28-24.
An hour after the game. Wildcat players
were still on the Maples Pavilion floor, sa
voring their victory with some Arizona
fans, hoping the final 10 Pac-10 games will
be as good as the first eight.
"That's the best we've played." a de
lighted Olson said.
