## 
### Bobby Blunt 
The Stanford women's rugby
team will defend its unbeaten colle
giate record in its first home league
game tomorrow against Humboldt
State. The team is excited as this is
one of the few home league games
for this season. This is also a very im
portant game in determining the
Northern California Collegiate
rugby standings.
Humboldt is a new team just
formed this year. The Northern Cal

ifornia Collegiate Women's Rugby
league was recently organized for
this year's season. The top two teams
of this new league will advance on to
the playoffs.

WOMEN'S RUGBY
■ SATURDAY: Stanford vs. Hum
boldt State at New Maloney Field, 11
a.m.

Although a new team in the
league. Humboldt is one of the
strongest. Of all eight new teams in

the league, Humboldt was one of the
first to form and has the most experi
ence. Several of the women on I lum
boldt's team have experience playing
rugby as they played with their
school's men's side last season due to
the absence of an organized women's
team. This rugby experience will
prove to be very helpful for Hum
boldt.
Although the Stanford team is ex
pecting a tough game, they know rel
atively little about the style of play
that they will face against Humboldt.

Thus far Humboldt has played most
of its matches against the closer (Ore
gon teams rather than travel within
California. Therefore Stanford must
concentrate on its own game plan.
"Execution w ill be the main focus
of our game," said Stanford head
coach Franck Boivert. "We must play
with confidence and determination.
The team must make a point that they
are the best in the West Coast. We
want to win by a good, strong margin
by playing clean rugby."
"Humboldt is one of the better

sides and this will be achanee to see
how well we play defensively and
as a team," said junior team presi
dent and open-side flanker Lara
Strauss.
This Saturday's game will he
played at the New Maloney Stadium
beginning at 11 a.m. Stanford rugby
takes great pride in being able to play
in the stadium.
"We are excited and honored to
open the season on the field." Strauss
said. "Being in the stadium makes
you feel like you're really playing."
