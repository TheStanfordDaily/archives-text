The Stanford wrestling team faces Portland State to
morrow for a noontime home meet. Portland State has
been so successful in Division II (winning two Division II
NCAA championships in the early l X)s) that they will
enter the Pacific 10 Conference and Division I in

wrestling next year.
The Vikings are led by coach Marlin Grahn, who de
feated Stanford head coach Chris Horpel in Horpel's
freshman year at Stanford and served as I iorpel's assis
tant coach during the Ail-American Pour through Mace
donia last summer.
With the NCAA tournament fast approaching, sev
eral Stanford wrestlers are looking to qualify with a
strong showing at the Pac-1() Championships in early
March. Saturday's meet will he one of their last opportu
nities to build up momentum going into the conference
tournament.

class. Sophomore Rudy Ruiz won a wrestle-off in the
118-pound division, and so will bring his six wins to bear
against the Vikings.
Stanford may also enter the match with a new lineup
wrinkle. For the first time all season, I iorpel may employ
Morgan Flager in the heavyweight division. Stanford has
forfeited six points in the heavyweight division in every
dual meet, and so Flager, a natural 177-pounder. will
only have to avoid being pinned to improve on the
heavyweight forfeit.

'it should he a close, tough match anil will be a good
indicator of our progress," Horpel said. "We've been
working hard anil I expect to see quite a bit of improve-
