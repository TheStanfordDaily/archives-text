## Kameelah relates MTV experiences 
### Leslie A. Gordon Contributing writer 
If there is anything Kameelah
is. it's real. Last fall, the sopho
more human biology major who
asked that her last name not be
mentionedâ€”charmed and some
times enraged viewers of " The
Real World - Boston." the MTV
show that films the lives of seven
strangers w ho temporarily live and
work together.
Though she has added unique
distinction to Stanford's list of
celebrity students, Kameelah. ca
sually dressed in jeans and a white
T-shirt, is disarmingly low-kev.
Perhaps the only hint of her being
a product of the MTV generation
is a small silver stud in her tongue.
Kameelah's road to stardom
began during the summer after her
freshman year. Surfing the Inter
net while bored at her job at a
chemical engineering firm, she
happened upon the show's World
Wide Web site. She e-mailed the
producer saying, "You want me
(on your show). You just don't
know it yet." After starting an e
mail rapport with the producer,
she headed up to the Hard Rock
Cafe in San Francisco for the
show 's open tryouts.

"There was already a line
around the corner," she said.
"Everyone was trying to stand out.
to be what they thought MTV
wanted."
Kameelah went through several
rounds of interviews lor both Ihe
Real World" and its traveling spin
off show. "Road Rules." After se\
eral months. Kameelah learned
through an MTV deliverec
Boston cream pie that she hai
been chosen for " 1 he Real World'
in Boston. For the next six months
the San Diego native would re
ceive free rent in a refurbished
Boston firehouse and a lump sum
payment, provided she volun
teered in an after-school program
for kids and let cameras document
her every move.
" I he cameras were ;ilw.i\s on."
she said. "II you were in the bath
room talking. the\ 'd be there."
Kameelah's roommates were
Genesis (a lipstick lesbian from
Mississippi). Jason (.in analytical
poet). Svrus (a basketball playing
Casanova), Montana (a Manhat
tan redhead). I Ik a (a naive
Catholic), and Scan (a lumberjack
law student). Ihe roommates were
quickly divided, with Kameelah.
