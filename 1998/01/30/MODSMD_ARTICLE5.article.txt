# Life in 'The Real World'
## Kameelah relates MTV experiences 
### Leslie A. Gordon Contributing writer 
If there is anything Kameelah
is. it's real. Last fall, the sopho
more human biology major who
asked that her last name not be
mentioned—charmed and some
times enraged viewers of " The
Real World - Boston." the MTV
show that films the lives of seven
strangers w ho temporarily live and
work together.
Though she has added unique
distinction to Stanford's list of
celebrity students, Kameelah. ca
sually dressed in jeans and a white
T-shirt, is disarmingly low-kev.
Perhaps the only hint of her being
a product of the MTV generation
is a small silver stud in her tongue.
Kameelah's road to stardom
began during the summer after her
freshman year. Surfing the Inter
net while bored at her job at a
chemical engineering firm, she
happened upon the show's World
Wide Web site. She e-mailed the
producer saying, "You want me
(on your show). You just don't
know it yet." After starting an e
mail rapport with the producer,
she headed up to the Hard Rock
Cafe in San Francisco for the
show 's open tryouts.

"There was already a line
around the corner," she said.
"Everyone was trying to stand out.
to be what they thought MTV
wanted."
Kameelah went through several
rounds of interviews lor both Ihe
Real World" and its traveling spin
off show. "Road Rules." After se\
eral months. Kameelah learned
through an MTV deliverec
Boston cream pie that she hai
been chosen for " 1 he Real World'
in Boston. For the next six months
the San Diego native would re
ceive free rent in a refurbished
Boston firehouse and a lump sum
payment, provided she volun
teered in an after-school program
for kids and let cameras document
her every move.
" I he cameras were ;ilw.i\s on."
she said. "II you were in the bath
room talking. the\ 'd be there."
Kameelah's roommates were
Genesis (a lipstick lesbian from
Mississippi). Jason (.in analytical
poet). Svrus (a basketball playing
Casanova), Montana (a Manhat
tan redhead). I Ik a (a naive
Catholic), and Scan (a lumberjack
law student). Ihe roommates were
quickly divided, with Kameelah.
Genesis, and Jason in one faction
and Montana, Syrus, Elka, and
Sean in the other. The fiercest divi
sion was between Kameelah and
Montana. In fact, she stopped
speaking to Montana after only a
month in Boston.
"She still has clothes of mine,"
Kameelah said. "But I don't want
them back." Kameelah is still very
close v\ ith Genesis. Jason and Elka.
She also keeps in touch with the
crew and her boss from the after
school program.
"I learned a lot about toler
ance." Kameelah said about the
six-month experience. "I also
learned about the kind of person I
don't want to be and how to avoid
being that person."
"Kameelah is going to be
Kameelah," said Tracey Thomas,
("lass of an alumni member of
Alpha Kappa Alpha, Kameelah's
sorority. "She is a sweet, honest
and open person. [MTV] couldn't
have picked a better person."
"The coolest part has been
watching her turn into a celebrity."
said senior Anndretta Lyle. anoth
er sorority sister. Lyle attended an
MTV awards show with Kameelah
in New York and "people
screamed like she was a nominee or
something."

Kameelah said she started get
ting recognized after only two
episodes of the show aired. Sinee
then, she has received love letters
and gifts from men and women.
People have followed her through
stores and listened in on her con
versations in restaurants.
"I'm usually pretty cool about it.
hut il depends on the person's ap
proach." she said. "Some people
come up just to tell me how much
they don't like me. 1 don't need
that."
After seeing the first few
episodes, Kameelah feared that she
didn't come off well. She even
called the production company to
complain about being portrayed as
"the angry black woman." But she
soon stood out as the star volunteer
at the kids' after-school program.
Kameelah also did a bit of dat
ing in Boston. The most embarrass
ing thing about being on the show
was that her strictly religious fami
ly found out she "wasn't an angel,"
Kameelah admitted with her signa
ture giggle.
Although Kameelah will partic
ipate in a reunion show, she re
mains focused on becoming a doc
tor and practicing medicine in Hon
duras where she lived for six
months during high school.
"I'd [be on the show] again if I
was 19 again," she said. "But it's
not fun to wake up to a zoom lens in
vour face."
