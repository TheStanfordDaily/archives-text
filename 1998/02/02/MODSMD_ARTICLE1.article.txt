# 'Core-to-core cultural conflict'
## Potok tells an author's tale 
### Carolvn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
In his booming, story-telling
voice, author Chaim Potok spoke
to a crowd of 270 people Friday
night about the "invisible scaf
folding" that holds together his
books.
Potok began by relating how
he became a story-teller. Growing
up in what he called "a sheltered
world," Potok decided in high
school to expose himself to "mod
ern literature." including Evelyn
Waugh's "Brideshead Revisited"
and James Joyce's "Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man."
These two books struck Potok
and made him appreciate writing
because "it was not just the story
that dominated the experience,
but the language became funda
mental" to the telling. At that
point, Potok knew that he wanted
to "use writing to explore I knew
not what."
Potok explained that in each of
his books he addresses the mount
ing problem of "core-to-core cul
ture conflict." a kind of "bumping
into other value systems." Potok's
works include "The Chosen,"
"My Name Is Asher Lev." " The
Book of Lights" and"I Am the
Clay."
He used the example of "Por
trait of the Artist as a Young
Man" to elaborate, describing
how as a young boy. the character
Stephen Daedalus is raised
Catholic and brought up to want
to be a priest. He is exposed to the
core of literature, another world
that clashes with his own that
deeply affects him.
When he began writing. Potok
said he realized that nothing is sa

cred to the modern novelist, and
that a person is a battleground. He
described lour ways in which the
culture confrontation occurs. One
was when a person's core of cul
ture remains strong, despite influ
ence by peripheral elements, ex
emplified when children are born
into one world and raised there.
They encounter another weaker
element outside their world, "the
heart is inundated by the periph
ery."
The second is when "the expe
rience at the core alters your un
derstanding of your position in
your own world, and thereby af
fects your view of the periphery."

The other two types of culture
confrontations are where the pe
riphery affects the core, and when
both experiences are peripheral.
Potok explained that his books
are written in the ascending order
of these confrontations, and with
each one he deals with a larger
problem.
Laurie Hahn and David
Douek, coordinators for Jewish
Culture Week, brought Potok
through Stanford Hiliel as the
keynote speaker for its weeklong
observation of Jewish culture.
Both students and members of the
Palo Alto Jewish community at
tended.
