## Clinton: back to business? 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Mon
ica Lewinsky's attorney predicted
yesterday that the controversy over
whether the former White House
intern had an affair with President
Clinton will "go away" and the
president will survive unscathed.
"It'll pass," William Ginsburg
said in a round of TV talk show
appearances. "The president will
remain in officc, he'll do a good job
... and I think everything's going to
be fine."
I he White House, apparently
agreeing, maintained a confident
silence about the matter. That stood
in marked contrast to a week earli
er, when Clinton allies were out in
force on yesterday's shows.
Independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, who is investigating the
Lewinsky matter, was back at his
office yesterday. But with immunity
talks between Ginsburg and Starr at
an impasse, Lewinsky was making
plans to return to California in the
next three days, her lawyer said.
That underscored the impor
tance to investigators of finding
other evidence if they are to prove

allegations of a presidential affair
and coverup. The White House
already has turned over some docu
ments in response to subpoenas
from Starr, and several administra
tion officials have appeared before
the grand jury.
But there were signs that admin
istration officials may resist comply
ing with portions of Starr's subpoe
nas that one White House source
said they consider "overly broad,
burdensome and ambiguous." In
addition, there may be disagree
ments over the subjects that White
House officials would be willing to
discuss, the source said.
For now, though, a White House
official who refused to be identified
by name, said. "We are cooperating
with the independent counsel fully
and will continue to do so."
Ginsburg was a one-man show
on yesterday's TV news circuit,
appearing on five different pro
grams.
Willi the president's popularity
reaching all-time highs in polls after
dipping when the allegations first
arose, the White House stuck with

its strategy of saying as little as pos
sible about the matter.
"We're at a point where every
body is getting back to business,"
Sen. Joseph I.ieberman. D-Conn.,
said on the CBS show "Face the
Nation."
Republicans, who in recent days
have become more aggressive in
attacking Clinton over the allega
tions, were not so sure.
"If in fact he did not tell the
truth, his programs are in deep
trouble,' House Budget Committee
Chairman Rep. John Kasich, R-
Ohio, said on ABC's "This Week
with Sam and Cokie."
(iinsburg said there were no
ongoing "intense negotiations" with
Starr's office to obtain a grant of
immunity from prosecution.
Lewinsky became the focus of
Starr's investigation when a one
time friend taped her saying that
she had an affair with Clinton and
that the president urged her to
cover it up. She signed an affidavit
in the Paula Jones sexual harass
ment case denying she had a sexual
relationship with Clinton.

"She stands by her affidavit."
Ginsburg said on C 'NN's "Late Edi
tion."
At the same time. (iinsburg sug
gested that Lewinsky may have
exaggerated in her taped conversa
tions with Linda Fripp. once a Pen
tagon coworker of Lewinsky's.
