## Editorial Editor's welcome 
### 
ALAS, THE "virtual pres
ence" I lamented so loudly
in Hong Kong has passed,
and I am home again.
Once more, I bike past Old
Union daily and blast my Ameri
can radio stations loudly. The old
familiarity of Stanford welcomed
me — yet confounded me. Too
many things looked as they did
before, but there was an unexplain
able hollowness to it all. After four
months of traveling around Asia,
returning to campus didn't offer me
the sense of stability I was looking
for. To be honest, I was a little more
than lost when I came back ... as
were most of the students who had
just returned from overseas.
But 1 went with my gut and
decided to run for editor in chief
despite the "big gray fog" before
me.
I remembered the first time I
walked into Hie Daily newsroom
as a Pro Fro. I felt at home here
this was my niche.
I took my time settling in. I wait
ed until February 19% to join the
staff as a news productionist. laying
out the front page of the paper one
night a week. 1 was intoxicated by
the power to write the teasers at the
bottom of the page.
Hut it took me two more months
to actually start writing for the
paper. Since then, I've acquired
many stories to tell, such as riding
in the Rev. Jesse Jackson's car as he
was driven to Memorial Auditori
um to debate with Dinesh D'Souza.
As a freshman, 1 pretended to be a
member of the Band's alto sax sec
tion as they rallied (unsuccessfully)
in San Francisco to get a spot on
David Letterman's Late Night
Show. When the campus was visit
ed by a power outage last year, I
found myself biking through abso
lute darkness to a mysterious place
called Cardinal Cogen ... I even
tried to climb the fence to get the
storv.

The Daily has been invaluable to
me in terms of experiences and the
people I've gotten to know here.
Now it's my turn to give back to the
paper.
As the largest publication on
campus. The Daily has a responsi
bility to provide more insightful
coverage for our readership. I plan
on maximizing this paper's poten
tial to provoke more thoughtful
discussion on issues ranging from
bilingual education to faculty
tenure to disability access.
With this goal in mind, I plan on
forging a closer relationship with
the Stanford community, because
we can't provide insightful cover
age without knowing what our
readership is thinking in the first
place. I will wear many hats in my
tenure as editor: 1 will listen to
those who come to me with con
cerns. grievances or suggestions. I
will initiate conversations with stu
dent groups so that better commu
nication can be achieved. And yes,
1 will play loud music in the news
room after hours.
The Daily office will be one
which welcomes all those who find
themselves here, but my interaction
with the community at large will
most definitely not be confined to
these walls.
After all. there aren't even real
windows in this place.
But there is an abundance of
good people willing to work hard to
make the paper better for you. 1
entreat you to work with us in our
endeavor to make it more respon
sive and proactive in its coverage.
A lesson I've learned before the
games have even begun: the big
gray fog is never as intimidating or
unchangeable as it may seem.
It's just where all the fun is.
