## Stanford neglects humanities 
### 
1 A COUPLE OF weeks
. ago, I had lunch with two
\ professors visiting from
the University of Chicago.
While they envied our
blue skies and "country
club" campus, they no
-1 ticed the lack of a strong
community of scholars in

the social sciences and humanities.
They were coming from a university
where the strongest departments are eco
nomics and anthropology to a place where
pre-medical students and engineers domi
nate.
While Stanford claims to he a global
institution, a place where students are
given a broad education, I feel we are
rapidly morphing into SIT (Stanford Insti
tute of Technology). A science-centric cul
ture has overtaken The Farm. This is
reflected in Stanford's poor commitment to
the humanities and social sciences.
The institutional bias towards the natu
ral sciences and professional schools is
embodied in many ways. Notice how quick
ly the Gates Building appeared and the
pace at which the Science and Engineering
Quad is taking form.
The Stanford Art Museum, which
closed down in 1989, is not scheduled to
open until next year — a decade after the
earthquake. Many claim that this is a ques
tion of funding — donors to Stanford are
often from technical industries, leading to
better facilities in these fields.
But by donating only to these depart
ments. the University as a whole loses out.
We need not only a Gates Information Sci
ences Building, but also a Gates Fine Arts
Center, .lust look at our moderate facilities
for photography, art. dance and music.

An emphasis on the sciences at Stanford
affects the University in more significant
ways. More than half of incoming freshmen
claim to be pre-med. Many students I know
are in their fields to make money as com
puter scientists, engineers and physicians.
Have we lost our love of knowledge and
our desire to contribute to our communi
ties?
Compared to many East coast schools,
we have fewer true scholars than we have
people with professional goals — "pre
money" as 1 like to call them. As an aca
demic institution, we need to re-emphasize
the importance of learning for its own sake,
and for the ways that learning can help and
touch people's lives.
However, the administration has made
recent efforts to support the arts by creat
ing four endowed chairs in the social sci
ences and humanities and a lecture series
that will bring academics such as Jacques
Derrida and Wole Soyinka to campus.
From the hiring of four professors to lili
the endowed chairs, benefits will trickle
down to undergraduates. But how closely
will the administration examine the teach
ing and mentoring records of the four fac
ulty chosen to fill these new professor
ships?
While I applaud the upcoming lecture
series, the lectures may also have a limited
impact, since the audience will consist pri
marily of professors and graduate students.
Additionally, Stanford has been slow in
responding to changes in student demo
graphics and interests. While our ethnic
studies program was instituted in 1997,
Berkeley has had one since the late l%()s.
Students have also expressed interest in
Islamic studies, South Asian studies and
Middle Eastern studies, interests which

reflect the changing face of the student
body.
Each of these academic areas includes
several hundred million people who are
underrepresented in Stanford course work.
Response to the student proposal for a
public service minor has been weak, and
resources for interdisciplinary programs
have been tenuous.
No university can be the top institution
in every department, but we deserve pro
fessors and classes that can fill in major
gaps of knowledge in the current curricu
lum These gaps are also important reasons
why many admitted students choose not to
enroll at Stanford.
If Stanford truly hopes to be an interna
tional university, it is imperative that we
make some serious changes. I commend
the University on its efforts, but would
make the following recommendations: (1)
raise more money for the fine arts and cre
ate a Fine Arts C enter with more endowed
professorships and funding, (2) hire schol
ars in underrepresented fields, with the
eventual goal of creating strong new
departments and expanding interdisci
plinary programs, (3) encourage more
donations from people in the arts and from
those in the sciences to contribute to the
arts. (4) aim to create departments of excel
lence by supporting a diverse faculty and by
increasing funding to increase the size of
social sciences and humanities programs,
(5) revamp the tenure system to retain fac
ulty members with broad interests and a
commitment to their students.
