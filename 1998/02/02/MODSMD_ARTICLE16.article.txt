Sixth Man Club Jans
chastised for heckling
Stanford is often the subject of atten
tion in the media and that is something I
t;ikc pride in on most occasions. However.
I was horrified and embarrassed to read a
column in I he San Francisco Chronicle
this weekend about the vulgar and dis
gusting behavior of Stanford students at
sports events.
Reportedly, at last fhursday's game
against the University of Arizona. Sixth
Man Club chants included. "Your daddy
hates you." in reference to one opposing
team member's estrangement with his
father, as well as the grade point average
of another member suspended for poor
grades. I he Sixth Man Club hooligans
also reportedly waved diapers at a player

who is said to have fathered two children
out of wedloek. I experienced similar atro
cious behavior while in attendance at my
final Rig CJame last November, an event
mostly ruined by the ridiculous "Your
mama ..insults spewed by some person
sitting behind me who was apparently
raised by wolves.
Although the Sixth Man Club might be
surprised to find out. I am pretty sure that
the fact that we won Rig Game and lost
on Thursday to Arizona — had nothing to
do with the amount (anil caliber) of siek
"jokes" chanted by our crowd. Team spir
it and support is an important factor in any
sports event, hut we would do just as well
il we employed the less offensive types of
cheers and chants. Besides, such behavior
results in some potential supporters decid
ing to forego the live experience altogeth
er and listen at home on the radio. It
makes some of the rest of us less excited

about being a part of the sports culture at
Stanford.
As The Chronicle put it, such behavior
from the "future business, political and
technology leaders" of tomorrow is disap
pointing. to say the least. I don't care how
smart we think we are or how many man
agement consulting offers we gather by
the end of each interview season. We are
not deserving of any more pats on the
back if a packed stadium and the heat of a
sports event inspires such responses from
the crowd.
While we all sit around getting cheap
laughs out of President Clinton's reported
indiscretions, perhaps we could examine
our own actions. President Casper is to be
commended for speaking out on this issue
after Hig Game, but it is up to students to
condemn this despicable behavior.

I didn't object so much to the concrete
sentiments expressed in Darron Evans' col
umn entitled "There is a far better thing to
be done" — those ideas are worn on the
sleeve of every do-gooder who thinks he or
she has a monopoly on empathy and service
to the community. Hell, I've expressed
those same sentiments many a time.
It was probably the self-satisfied, superi
or tone that annoyed me. It was also proba
bly the fact that I don't see Darron going
out to actively understand or change many
of the aspects of the Stanford community he
finds troubling.
Rather than writing a column on the
subject of upper-middle-class privilege and
the blindness of the average Stanford stu
dent to the problems of poverty, to the
lack of support for community service

options, to the incompetence of the ASSU,
and to the hypocrisy of student groups, I
suggest that Darron actually interact with
students who are attempting to change
these things.
I invite Darron to a Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) meeting —
one of the so-called "exclusive student
organizations." There's one on Monday at
4:3(1 p.m. in the basement of Old Union
Clubhouse. And why don't you talk to
someone from Stanford Students for Life
or whatever they call themselves? You will
see that those students probably have a
variety of causes for which they feel pas
sionate enough to organize for.
And there's at least one ASSIJ senator
who is attempting to use her position to
positively affect her surroundings. Maybe if
Darron weren't such a hang-around-the-
Haas-C'enter student, he would realize that
there exists a world of students at Stanford
who don't actually need to read his plati
tudes — they live them far better than he
will ever write them.
Paolo Freire writes in "Pedagogy of the

Oppressed," "Discovering himself to be an
oppressor may cause considerable anguish,
but it does not necessarily lead to solidarity
with the oppressed ... The oppressor can
act in solidarity with the oppressed only
when he stops regarding the oppressed as
an abstract category ... when he stops mak
ing pious, sentimental, and individualistic
gestures and risks an act of love."
Darron, keep up your exemplary com
munity service record — even 1 have heard
of the good work you do. But save your
preaching and keep risking acts of love.
