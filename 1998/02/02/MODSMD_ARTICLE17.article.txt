## Merlot and music: the value of diversity 
### 
Alda Leu

ONE OF MY closest friends pays
$2(H) a quarter to go to Stanford.
Not surprisingly, her family's
annual income hovers well below the
poverty level.
Another friend is the progeny of two
doctors who make over hall a million a
year. She grew up attending private
schools and learning the art of wine tast
ing.
One is white, the other is Hispanic.
I have learned invaluable lessons from
both of my friends. They have each, in her
own way, contributed to my growth as an
intellectual and as a person. I've learned to
appreciate Mexican music, to improve my
Spanish accent and to tell the difference
between merlot and cabernet sauvignon.
Last Friday, Stanford hosted Califor
nia's Summit on Race in America. Impor

tant thinkers came to respond to Clinton's
challenge to commence a dialogue on race
in America. It is a perfect time to think
about how we feel about topics like Propo
sition 20 l > and affirmative action. From a
personal perspective, I have always been a
strong supporter of affirmative action.
I benefit from having a diverse group of
people to learn from and about. Different
cultures, values and ideas serve to open
minds and expand horizons.
Life is about expanding your horizons,
and diversity achieves that. There's noth
ing that facilitates learning about others
more than putting people together on an
even playing field.
This is exactly the principle behind
affirmative action.
On the surface, the attainment of
equality using preferential treatment

seems inherently contradictory. However,
issues of race and gender discrimination
are not ones that are always visible on the
surface.
Inherent inequalities exist in testing
and educational procedures. Female stu
dents receive less attention in classes and
black students somehow manage to score
consistently lower on standardized tests
than do white students with equivalent
lOs. Such biases directly contribute to dis
crimination in the selection processes of
employers as well as those of academic
institutions.
Consequently, women and minorities
are disproportionately underrepresented
in universities, employment and govern
ment positions. ( hildren and young adults
need role models to look up to. In the
United States, however, there is a dearth

of minority and female role models within
government agencies.
I he argument that affirmative action
should be abolished because it has failed
or somehow become unnecessary is
patently lalse. Some cite cases in which
wealthy minorities receive preferential
treatment intended for the economically
disadvantaged, ignoring the racism that
persists in society regardless of economic
status. I he basis for initiating affirmative
action in a word, inequality has not
been eliminated. I here is still an unequal
hierarchy in American society which per
petuates a system of racism and preju
dices.
Specifically. Proposition 209 abolishes
affirmative action in"state operations ol
public employment, public education or
public contracting." A government should

reflect the diversity of its people. ()urs is ;i
nation that cheiishes differences of opin
ion. It is the government's responsibility to
act in the interest of the public good: in
this case, collective good exceeds the good
of the individual.
Affirmative action impacts individuals,
classes, races, universities, cities and state*
it benefits society as a whole. A richness
of diversity and learning should be a goa
towards which we all strive.
We should strive for a culture in which
differences in wealth, race, and gender car
be equalized one in which we no longei
differentiate between who is rich or pool
and who is white or Hispanic.
