## Cardinal women gun down No.5 Texas Tech 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
LIJBBOC K. I'exas— A slight breeze picked up at
Lubbock Municipal ( oliseum over the last few minutes
of Saturday's game between No. 5 Texas Tech and the
ninth-ranked Stanford women's basketball team.
For the first time all night the hostile crowd was silent,
and most of the Lady Raider contention was filing out
the door. The reason — the Cardinal (12-5) had com
pleted the comeback from a l()-point deficit and mo
seyed out ot Lubbock with an 80-71 win over Texas Tech
(14-4) in the late game of the Pac-10 / Big 12 Conference
Challenge. No. 10 Arizona completed the Pacific 10
( onlerence sweep with a 57-52 win over Kansas in the
earlv game.

"This was a huge win for our team," said head coach
I ara VanDerveer. "I have a tremendous amount of re
spect for Texas Tech. We had to play extremely well to
come out and beat them today."

But early on it was the Lady Raiders getting it done.
Texas Tech shot 53 percent from the field in the first hall
and forced 13 Cardinal turnovers as the Lady Raider
fans watched their squad stake a 36-30 halltime lead.
It was the first time all season that Stanford has
trailed at the break, and when the second halt started,
VanDerveer went with a different lineup. Alter a 12-

point, eight-rebound performance junior forward
Kristin R>lkl earned the start along with sophomore
guard Melody Peterson.
The duo joined senior post players Olympia Scott.
Vanessa Nygaard and Heather Owen for probably the
biggest lineup in the country. Two quick jumpers from
Texas Tech senior forward Alicia Thompson stretched
the Lady Raider lead to 10. but that's as big as it got as
Stanford promptly went on a 9-0 run to cut the deficit to
one.
"I think Stanford is the best basketball team we've
played this year." said Texas lech head coach Marsha
Sharp, who lost to No. 3 Old Dominion earlier in the
year. "I felt like we had some big breakdowns, and I'm
really disappointed we didn't do the things we should've
done. When you do that they make vou pav: they're an

awfully good basketball team."
I'he second hall saw the Card play perhaps its best
basketball of the year en route to the road team's first
ever win in the schools' rivalry. Stanford moved the ball
extremely well in the halfcourt offense and scored points
from every spot on the court.
After recording just one assist to six turnovers in the
first half, sophomore point guard Milena Flores came off
the beneh in the second to put together one of her best
performances. Flores made two free throws with 10 min
utes. 10 seconds remaining to cut the lead back to one at
51-50.
Texas Tech junior center Angie Bra/iel. w ho finished
the game with l points, converted on one of two free
throws, hut Flores answered with
the first of back-to-hack three
pointers to give Stanlord the lead
for good. Flores finished the game
with 15 points (12 in the second half)
on 4-01-6 shooting.
"My first half was terrible." Flo
res said, 'in previous games 1 got
frustrated, hut this time I just tried
to locus and do what 1 needed to do
to help my team."
But the Cardinal got its higgest
scare of the game about a minute
after 1 lores second three. Folkl
drove down the lane, hit the floor
hard and did not get up. Scott had
landed on 1 olkl's right hand, break
ing the nail of her pinkie at its base
and smashing her ring and middle
finger as well.
Folkl sat down with a game-high
20 points and 13 rebounds, and
Texas lech fans seemed more con
fident with Stanford's hit! ''Lin on the

bench. But Nygaard promptly drove
down the left side for a layup to put
Stanford up 60-56 with 7:43 remain
ing.
"With Kristin being out 1 knew it
was a do or die situation for us,"
Scott said. "I also wanted to step it
up because 1 didn't want it to get us
down. It's a really big (win). It's hard
to say what game is the biggest, but
it had a Final Four feel to it."
From that point on. the Card got
all the big buckets. Scott converted a
steal and two huge offensive re
bounds into easy points, and Stan
ford got big shots from Owen. Ny
gaard and Flores.
But perhaps even bigger was the
Cardinal defense which held the
All American Thompson scoreless
over the last 8:22 of the game.
"1 think this was very important
for our team." VanDerveer said.
"Obviously Kristin means a tremen
dous amount to our team, but there
might have been some people who
felt we couldn't win without her. It's
a confidence booster."
