### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
LIJBBOC K. I'exas— A slight breeze picked up at
Lubbock Municipal ( oliseum over the last few minutes
of Saturday's game between No. 5 Texas Tech and the
ninth-ranked Stanford women's basketball team.
For the first time all night the hostile crowd was silent,
and most of the Lady Raider contention was filing out
the door. The reason — the Cardinal (12-5) had com
pleted the comeback from a l()-point deficit and mo
seyed out ot Lubbock with an 80-71 win over Texas Tech
(14-4) in the late game of the Pac-10 / Big 12 Conference
Challenge. No. 10 Arizona completed the Pacific 10
( onlerence sweep with a 57-52 win over Kansas in the
earlv game.

"This was a huge win for our team," said head coach
I ara VanDerveer. "I have a tremendous amount of re
spect for Texas Tech. We had to play extremely well to
come out and beat them today."

■ Saturday: Stanford SO, Texas Tech 71

But early on it was the Lady Raiders getting it done.
Texas Tech shot 53 percent from the field in the first hall
and forced 13 Cardinal turnovers as the Lady Raider
fans watched their squad stake a 36-30 halltime lead.
It was the first time all season that Stanford has
trailed at the break, and when the second halt started,
VanDerveer went with a different lineup. Alter a 12-

point, eight-rebound performance junior forward
Kristin R>lkl earned the start along with sophomore
guard Melody Peterson.
The duo joined senior post players Olympia Scott.
Vanessa Nygaard and Heather Owen for probably the
biggest lineup in the country. Two quick jumpers from
Texas Tech senior forward Alicia Thompson stretched
the Lady Raider lead to 10. but that's as big as it got as
Stanford promptly went on a 9-0 run to cut the deficit to
one.
"I think Stanford is the best basketball team we've
played this year." said Texas lech head coach Marsha
Sharp, who lost to No. 3 Old Dominion earlier in the
year. "I felt like we had some big breakdowns, and I'm
really disappointed we didn't do the things we should've
done. When you do that they make vou pav: they're an

awfully good basketball team."
I'he second hall saw the Card play perhaps its best
basketball of the year en route to the road team's first
ever win in the schools' rivalry. Stanford moved the ball
extremely well in the halfcourt offense and scored points
from every spot on the court.
After recording just one assist to six turnovers in the
first half, sophomore point guard Milena Flores came off
the beneh in the second to put together one of her best
performances. Flores made two free throws with 10 min
utes. 10 seconds remaining to cut the lead back to one at
51-50.
