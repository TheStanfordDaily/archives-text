I RESNO, Calif. — It's early in
the evening and three males spill out
of the hotel ballroom and into its
lobby a couple blocks from Fresno
State University. It appears as if
they've enjoyed themselves at a
wedding reception, have had a little
to drink and are ready to check into
their respective rooms.

"I wonder if Stanford is staying
here," one mumbles to another.
When the receptionist confirms that,
in fact, the Stanford baseball team is
staying at the same hotel, the three
run off, deciding to try and "hang"
with the traveling celebrities.
There was a certain buzz in the air
in Fresno when the consensus No. 1
Stanford Cardinal came to town this
weekend to face the No. 20 Bulldogs
(0-3). They were talking about the
series on the radio, there were sto
ries in the local papers, and the
sports fans came out to Beiden Field
to see what all the hype was about.
With a total of 12,395 in attendance
for the weekend's series, including a
Fresno season-opener record of

5,113. the locals got to see what all
the hype was about, got to see a Stan
ford sweep and got to see the No. 1
Cardinal leave with its top ranking
and a 5-0 record intact.
On the eve of his first start of the
season, junior pitcher Chad
Hutchinson walked up to the mound
and stared at home plate. 'Hie Cardi
nal had won two long games already
on the weekend, and Hutchinson
was the hope for the Stanford sweep.
He went through his pitching mo
tions, without a ball, while the rest of
the team started making the trek to
ward the team bus. Finally, someone
snagged Hutchinson, and laughing,
the stragglers ran to the bus.
Yesterday, Hutchinson threw a
no-hitter.
Lasting five full innings, a com
plete game, before the rain began to
wash Beiden Field away, Hutchin
son threw 63 pitches and 39 strikes,
struck out six batters, gave up no
walks and allowed no hits as the Car
dinal defeated the Bulldogs 4-0.
"It was getting a little slippery out
there," Hutchinson (2-0) said. "I was
just pleased with getting the win.
Although he tried to downplay
the accomplishment. Hutchinson
did say that everybody was being
careful in the dugout.
" They didn't mention [the no-hit
ter) until ... they called the game,"
he said after the 50-minute rain
delay. "They were avoiding the
topic. It was a little bit of a hush-hush

Regionals. This weekend he pitched 5 hitless innings before the
game was called due to rain.
thing."
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
was just happy to end the series on a
high note.
1 his was a great effort in tough
conditions," Marquess said of
Hutchinson. "He was sharp. He had
command of everything."
I heC ardinal scored all four of its
runs in the top of the fifth inning,
when it hatted around in an inning
for the third game in the series.
It was the lirst Stanford no-hitter
since Jason Middlebrook defeated
UCLA at Sunken Diamond in IW4.
Hutchinson wasn't the only star
to shine in rainy Fresno. Junior
catcher John Salter showed that he
could step up and continue the tradi
tion of quality players behind the
plate when he cracked two homers
Saturday in Stanford's 16-9 victory.
Salter was 3 for 6 on the day and
landed live RBIs. He had hit only
two home runs in his Stanford ca
reer prior to the game,
"Its just my turn to contribute,"
Salter said. "I just want to make sure
I become a central part of the team."
Salter has certainly been given
the opportunity to learn from the
best. During his freshman year, A.J.
Hinch, now in the Oakland A's or
ganization. was behind the plate.
Hinch was followed by the Jon Scha
efler, who led the team in home runs
prior to being drafted by the Min

nesota Twins. Now it's Salter's turn.
"I learned from the best," he said.
"I took what I could get from them."
Freshman designated hitter Joe
Borchard also helped power the
Cardinal offense with four hits and
five RBIs.
I he series opened in an unusual
way Friday evening. In a game that
spanned four hours, 11 innings and
seven pitching changes between the
two teams, the Bulldogs were able to
score four runs in the bottom of the
11th inning and still lost to Stanford
12-10.
After struggling early in the
game to get on board, the Cardinal
doubled its hit total in the 11th in
ning and went through a complete
cycle of its lineup. A two-run double
bv sophomore left fielder Edmund
Muth and a two-run homer by
sophomore first baseman John C Jail,
both with two outs in the inning,
gave the Cardinal a 12-6 lead.
The six-run lead was just barely
enough for the win. Freshman re
liever Austin Coose was able to land
the save when he ended the game
with Fresno's tying run at second.
"They're a very capable team,"
Marquess said. "If you don't play
well, they can beat you."
The game marked the end of
Bulldog Josh I lannah's3B-game hit
ting streak. Hannah went 0 for at
the plate in the series.
The Cardinal returns home this
weekend, the only weekend home
series until March 6, for a three game
series with Cal State-Fullerton.
