I RESNO, Calif. — It's early in
the evening and three males spill out
of the hotel ballroom and into its
lobby a couple blocks from Fresno
State University. It appears as if
they've enjoyed themselves at a
wedding reception, have had a little
to drink and are ready to check into
their respective rooms.

"I wonder if Stanford is staying
here," one mumbles to another.
When the receptionist confirms that,
in fact, the Stanford baseball team is
staying at the same hotel, the three
run off, deciding to try and "hang"
with the traveling celebrities.
There was a certain buzz in the air
in Fresno when the consensus No. 1
Stanford Cardinal came to town this
weekend to face the No. 20 Bulldogs
(0-3). They were talking about the
series on the radio, there were sto
ries in the local papers, and the
sports fans came out to Beiden Field
to see what all the hype was about.
With a total of 12,395 in attendance
for the weekend's series, including a
Fresno season-opener record of

5,113. the locals got to see what all
the hype was about, got to see a Stan
ford sweep and got to see the No. 1
Cardinal leave with its top ranking
and a 5-0 record intact.
On the eve of his first start of the
season, junior pitcher Chad
Hutchinson walked up to the mound
and stared at home plate. 'Hie Cardi
nal had won two long games already
on the weekend, and Hutchinson
was the hope for the Stanford sweep.
He went through his pitching mo
tions, without a ball, while the rest of
the team started making the trek to
ward the team bus. Finally, someone
snagged Hutchinson, and laughing,
the stragglers ran to the bus.
Yesterday, Hutchinson threw a
no-hitter.
Lasting five full innings, a com
plete game, before the rain began to
wash Beiden Field away, Hutchin
son threw 63 pitches and 39 strikes,
struck out six batters, gave up no
walks and allowed no hits as the Car
dinal defeated the Bulldogs 4-0.
"It was getting a little slippery out
there," Hutchinson (2-0) said. "I was
just pleased with getting the win.
Although he tried to downplay
the accomplishment. Hutchinson
did say that everybody was being
careful in the dugout.
" They didn't mention [the no-hit
ter) until ... they called the game,"
he said after the 50-minute rain
delay. "They were avoiding the
topic. It was a little bit of a hush-hush
