A heated panel discussion on
"Education, Bilingualism and the
Minority Student" focused primari
ly on the "English for the Children"
ballot initiative that seeks to curtail
bilingual education programs in
California public schools.
The three-hour panel was part of
Friday's California Summit on Race
in America, sponsored by the Cen
ter for Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity.
Each of six panelists was given a
20-minute speaking limit, then an
swered written questions submitted
from the audience.
Palo Alto businessman Ron Unz,
the chair of the initiative's cam
paign, spoke first. The audience pro
vided him with little support: there
was a distinct lack of applause after

his statement, and some of his com
ments were hissed at and booed b\
members of the audience.
Unz emphasized that the main
issue was simply "whether younj;
children should or should not bi
taught English when they entei
sch<K)l." and "whether bilingual ed
ucation works or does not work."
"Today in California, bihngua
education is an utter and dismal fail
ure." he said. He cited governmeni
figures showing that only about 5 ti
6 percent of California students des
ignated as having limited English
proficiency are transferred to main
stream English classes every year.
One of every four students in
California, a total of 1.38 million, is
designated as having limited English
proficiency.
Panelist Fernando Vega, the
Peninsula chair of "English for the
Children." recounted how his

grandson had been placed in a bilin
gual education classroom even
though he spoke no Spanish. Vega
could only think that his grandson s
"Spanish surname was a factor."
I n/ s initiative mandates the
placement of limited-English stu
dents in classrooms using a method
of "sheltered English immersion'
for no longer than one year. His ini
tiative explicitly allows schools to
place children of different ages but
the same English proficiency level in
the same classroom.
Other panelists argued that it is
not sound educational policy to
place students of various ages in the
same classroom for a sch(X)l year.
The initiative allows lor an ex
ception i! parents sign waivers stat
ing that they wish their child to be
placed in a bilingual education pro
