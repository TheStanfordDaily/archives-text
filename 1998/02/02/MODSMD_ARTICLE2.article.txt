# Center hosts race summit
## Unz squares off with audience, critics of school initiative 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
A heated panel discussion on
"Education, Bilingualism and the
Minority Student" focused primari
ly on the "English for the Children"
ballot initiative that seeks to curtail
bilingual education programs in
California public schools.
The three-hour panel was part of
Friday's California Summit on Race
in America, sponsored by the Cen
ter for Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity.
Each of six panelists was given a
20-minute speaking limit, then an
swered written questions submitted
from the audience.
Palo Alto businessman Ron Unz,
the chair of the initiative's cam
paign, spoke first. The audience pro
vided him with little support: there
was a distinct lack of applause after

his statement, and some of his com
ments were hissed at and booed b\
members of the audience.
Unz emphasized that the main
issue was simply "whether younj;
children should or should not bi
taught English when they entei
sch<K)l." and "whether bilingual ed
ucation works or does not work."
"Today in California, bihngua
education is an utter and dismal fail
ure." he said. He cited governmeni
figures showing that only about 5 ti
6 percent of California students des
ignated as having limited English
proficiency are transferred to main
stream English classes every year.
One of every four students in
California, a total of 1.38 million, is
designated as having limited English
proficiency.
Panelist Fernando Vega, the
Peninsula chair of "English for the
Children." recounted how his

grandson had been placed in a bilin
gual education classroom even
though he spoke no Spanish. Vega
could only think that his grandson s
"Spanish surname was a factor."
I n/ s initiative mandates the
placement of limited-English stu
dents in classrooms using a method
of "sheltered English immersion'
for no longer than one year. His ini
tiative explicitly allows schools to
place children of different ages but
the same English proficiency level in
the same classroom.
Other panelists argued that it is
not sound educational policy to
place students of various ages in the
same classroom for a sch(X)l year.
The initiative allows lor an ex
ception i! parents sign waivers stat
ing that they wish their child to be
placed in a bilingual education pro
gram. However, the initiative states
that waivers may only be granted to
parents with "children who already
know English ... [are] 10 years or
older... [and | children with special
needs."
Kelly Hayes-Raitt, director of the
"No on Unz" campaign, argued that
an 8-year-old who cannot speak
English would "fall through the
cracks" of this proposed system.
"This is a one-size-fits-all, state
mandated initiative that eliminates
all local control," she said.
Unz was criticized by panelists
for attributing a larger crisis in Cali
fornia education to bilingual teach
ing methods than necessary. It was
also pointed out that Unz, who is a
theoretical physicist by training, has
no background in education and
therefore cannot know what is best
for California students.

The audience broke into ap
plause when Henry Der, deputy su
perintendent of the California De
partment of Education asked, "Has
bilingual education been a success?
No? Hut has teaching reading in Cal
ifornia been a success?"
Four years ago, California
ranked last in a nationwide survey of
reading skills, Der noted.
Panelists also cited figures that
only about a third of limited-English
students are actually in bilingual ed
ucation programs. Thus, they ar
gued. Unz's focus eliminating
such programs was inappropriate.
In response to this argument,
Unz attacked the state's method for
identifying limited-English students.
"The classification methodology
of the state is nuts," he said. He con
tended that nobody in the state
knows how many students have lim
ited English proficiency or how
many are learning English.
He argued that the whole system
of bilingual education is driven bv

money,* because schools and teach
ers involved in such programs re
ceive more money. These schools
and teachers would therefore he un
willing to alter a program from
which they benefit.
Der, whose wife teaches second
graders in a bilingual education pro
gram in San Francisco, said his wife
was not receiving extra pay for her
work.
Hayes-Raitt also noted a provi
sion in I Jnz's initiative that states "as
much as possible, current supple
mental funding for English learners
shall be maintained." Thus his initia
tive does not change current levels
of spending on teaching limited-
English students.
UC-Davis Education Prof. Patri
cia Gandara pointed out research re
sults showing that acquisition of read
ing skills in any language by the third
grade is highly predictive of future
academic success, while the speed
with which English is learned is not.
"Hence it is critical that children

learn to read in any language by the
third grade," she said. "What we had
best be doing is teaching reading,
and worrying less about English."
Stanford Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy agreed with Gandara. "It's a
lot easier to teach students to break
the code of reading in a language
they know,"he said.
Unz was challenged by panelists
to cite studies showing that his plan
would work better than bilingual ed
ucation.
He could only say that studies
about educational methods do not
tell us anything because academic
research is often biased by the orga
nizations funding it."The academic
field is garbage ... complete acade
mic lunacy." said Unz.
Unz and his detractors on the
panel also disagreed about how long
a child needs to learn English. I le ar
gued that the claim by bilingual edu
cators that seven to 10 years are nec
essary was wrong, and that one year
is sufficient.
