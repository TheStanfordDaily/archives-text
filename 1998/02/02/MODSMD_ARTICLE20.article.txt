# Stanford bedeviled at Maples
## ASU shocks men's hoops in overtime 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Arthur Lee couldn't even face
the reporters.
The junior point guard, who
was direct even after the team's
18-point loss to Arizona last
Thursday, was hesitant to answer
questions after visiting Arizona
State upset Stanford W-87 in
overtime Saturday.

MEW S BASKETBALL
â–  Saturday: Arizona State W.
Stanford 87 (OT)

"The guys weren't ready to
play today," Lee said. "Too many
people were still thinking about
Thursday. We took them for
granted. We figured that we
should beat them with minimal ef
fort. We didn't come out with a
good attitude and they did the job.
We weren't ready mentally for
this one."
Stanford wasn't the only one
that came out less than enthused

for the game. Ev en the rabid Sixth
Man Club, which had reached a
new high in national respect for
boisterous fans, was short a hun
dred or so members.
The No. 4 Cardinal (18-2. 7-2
Pacific 10 Conference) now drop
sinto a second-place tie in the
league race with UCLA The Sun
Devils (14-8. 4-5) are now tied
with California at fifth.
C oming into the game, it would
have seemed the Cardinal had the
emotional advantage. Suffering
their first loss of the season
seemed like reason enough to
want to crush Arizona State.
Then there w.is Mark Madsen.
The 6-foot-8 sophomore power
forward made his first appearance
in Pac-10 play, bringing the capac
ity crowd to its highest decibel
level of the afternoon.
Madsen also gave the Cardinal
some strong support on the court,
scoring 10 points and pulling
down five rebounds in 14 minutes.
After going through onlv one
half of a full practice this week,
Madsen was supposed to be used

sparingly in order to prepare hirr
for games at Cal and Connecticut
this weekend.
"Three days ago I was not an
ticipating playing tonight at all."
Madsen said. "The plan was to he
extremely limited tonight in terms
of court minutes."
Unfortunately, his return
wasn't more joyous.
"We're upset with ourselves.
Arizona State came in and played
a great game, and the> should be
given credit," Madsen said.
"We're upset with ourselves be
cause our intensity wasn't that
great tonight; our help defense
wasn't that great. These are men
tal things that can be controlled."
Madsen's return is extremeK
timely. Junior Pete Van Elswvk
left the game with a sprained
shoulder after playing only five
minutes. It is unknown when he
will return.
If the team looked flat in regu
lation. it was even worse in over
time

The Sixth Man Club was as lethargic as the players in Saturday's stunning 90-87 overtime loss to Ari
zona State.
