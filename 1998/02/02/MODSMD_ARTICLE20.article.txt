# Stanford bedeviled at Maples
## ASU shocks men's hoops in overtime 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Arthur Lee couldn't even face
the reporters.
The junior point guard, who
was direct even after the team's
18-point loss to Arizona last
Thursday, was hesitant to answer
questions after visiting Arizona
State upset Stanford W-87 in
overtime Saturday.

MEW S BASKETBALL
â–  Saturday: Arizona State W.
Stanford 87 (OT)

"The guys weren't ready to
play today," Lee said. "Too many
people were still thinking about
Thursday. We took them for
granted. We figured that we
should beat them with minimal ef
fort. We didn't come out with a
good attitude and they did the job.
We weren't ready mentally for
this one."
Stanford wasn't the only one
that came out less than enthused

for the game. Ev en the rabid Sixth
Man Club, which had reached a
new high in national respect for
boisterous fans, was short a hun
dred or so members.
The No. 4 Cardinal (18-2. 7-2
Pacific 10 Conference) now drop
sinto a second-place tie in the
league race with UCLA The Sun
Devils (14-8. 4-5) are now tied
with California at fifth.
C oming into the game, it would
have seemed the Cardinal had the
emotional advantage. Suffering
their first loss of the season
seemed like reason enough to
want to crush Arizona State.
Then there w.is Mark Madsen.
The 6-foot-8 sophomore power
forward made his first appearance
in Pac-10 play, bringing the capac
ity crowd to its highest decibel
level of the afternoon.
Madsen also gave the Cardinal
some strong support on the court,
scoring 10 points and pulling
down five rebounds in 14 minutes.
After going through onlv one
half of a full practice this week,
Madsen was supposed to be used

sparingly in order to prepare hirr
for games at Cal and Connecticut
this weekend.
"Three days ago I was not an
ticipating playing tonight at all."
Madsen said. "The plan was to he
extremely limited tonight in terms
of court minutes."
Unfortunately, his return
wasn't more joyous.
"We're upset with ourselves.
Arizona State came in and played
a great game, and the> should be
given credit," Madsen said.
"We're upset with ourselves be
cause our intensity wasn't that
great tonight; our help defense
wasn't that great. These are men
tal things that can be controlled."
Madsen's return is extremeK
timely. Junior Pete Van Elswvk
left the game with a sprained
shoulder after playing only five
minutes. It is unknown when he
will return.
If the team looked flat in regu
lation. it was even worse in over
time

The Sixth Man Club was as lethargic as the players in Saturday's stunning 90-87 overtime loss to Ari
zona State.
Junior forward Peter Sauer
missed a three. Junior center Tim
Young missed a turnaround
jumper. Young then missed anoth
er shot, grabbed his own rebound
and missed again.
Seven shots and seven misses
later, the Cardinal trailed 83-77.
The only one with any offensive
touch was Lee, who scored 10 of
Stanford's 11 points in the extra
period.
In all. the Cardinal made only 3
of 11 shots (27.3 percent). Arizona
State wasn't much better, shooting
only 33.3 percent, but it was
enough for the win.
Sun Devil guard Jeremy Veal
led all scorers with 27 points, and
forward Bobby La/or contributed
22 points and 14 boards.
But the Sun Devils shut the
door on the Cardinal from the free
throw line. They hit 29 of 33 from
the charity stripe, including 9 of 10
in overtime.
Young led the Cardinal with 24
points and 12 rebounds, but he
also committed five turnovers. Lee
had his second straight double
double with 13 points and 10 as
sists but went scoreless in the sec
ond half.
"I don't think we were pre
pared mentally for the idea that
Arizona State is as good as they
are," said Cardinal coach Mike
Montgomery. "1 thought we were
flat to start the game. They've got
some really good athletes that hurt
us. I (think) fundamentally right
now that we're broken down a lit
tle bit.
"We're not doing a very good
job defensively at helping one an

other. We're not doing a very good
job at point of attack. We thought
we could attack inside because
they defend behind at the post,
and we had limited success with
that."
The Sun Devils beat the Cardi
nal in much the same way their
cross-state rivals did. using an up
tempo offense and high-pressure
defense to throw off Stanford's
half-court set.
The Cardinal also found trou
ble trying to find ways to match
up man for man with Arizona
State.
With the game tied at 76 and 12
seconds left in regulation, Mont
gomery had no choice but to put 6-
7 sophomore swingman Ryan
Mendez, who had just made a
game-tying three-pointer, on Veal
to try and stop the game-winning
shot.
Sauer is a better defender, but
Veal may be too quick for him.
The only other option was fresh
man point guard Mike McDonald,
and his inexperience may have
been a factor in choosing Mendez.
Veal got a decent look at basket
but bricked the bank shot.
"It had to be a tempo-type
game, and 1 thought we controlled
the tempo," said Sun Devil coach
Don Newman. "I am extremely
proud of the Sun Devils. Stan
ford's going to continue winning
and probably go very deep into the
tournament, but today on this
floor we were the better bunch and
I'm really proud of the guys."
The Devils finally snapped
their 14-game losing streak against
ranked teams, as well as giving the
Cardinal its first back-to-back
home losses since the 1993-94 sea
son, when, ironically, Stanford was
swept by the Arizona schools.
