# Sleepy Card never wakes
## 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
It was like a had dream.
Stanford, the fourth-ranked
team in the country, playing at
home against a team which
hadn't beaten a ranked opponent
in almost three years, just wasn't
pulling away.
Sure, the Cardinal had leads
of seven points. Hut there was no
death blow
Oddly enough, both the fans
and players at Saturday's men's
basketball overtime loss to Ari
zona State seemed to be having
that same nightmare. And when
the\ woke up with two minutes
• left to ffffTfTOW nm'p STftt
that dr#am \vus«u;alit\. the Cardi
nal lead was just one.
"We didn't play well enough
to win.'" said Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery "We weren't
prepared mentally thai Arizona
State was as good as they were."
After weeks of national atten
tion focused tin the intensity of
(he Maples crowd, home court
advantage did not really become
a factor until the last two minutes
of regulation and the five-minute
overtime.
The Maples faithful may have
inspired sophomore R\an
Mendez to sink a game-tying
three-pointer that sent the game
into overtime, but not even the
crowd could help the Card in the
extra period. During overtime,
the Cardinal was its own worst
enemy
The game was played as if
everyone on the Cardinal team
was expecting to run on the Sun
Devils but waiting for it to hap
pen without any leadership.
After scoring only three
points during regulation, junior
guard Arthur Lee spearheaded
the Cardinal effort in overtime,
scoring 10 of Stanford's II points
in a span of 51 seconds. Unfortu
nately. when the rest of the team
shoots zero percent, it's tough to
win, no matter what the circum
stances.
It's not like they were necessarily
difficult shots. Stanford missed three
point-blank layups in the extra peri
od.
"We took them for granted," Lee
said. "We thought we could heat
them with a minimal effort.
"We didn't come out with the
mindset to win. This was a horrible
game for us."
Oddly enough for the hot free
throw shooting Cardinal, the stripe
proved to he a decisive factor in Sat
urday's loss. Although Stanford

made 15 of 21 free throws, the Car
dinal missed them in the clutch. Ju
nior center Tim Young missed two
near the end of regulation that
would have given Stanford the lead
and one during overtime. Arizona
State, on the other hand, had 33 free
throw attempts and scored 29 points
from the line, including 11 of 14 in
overtime.
"We're supposed to be the bigger
team according to everybody,"
Montgomery said. "Hut we can't
seem to get to the foul line against
anybody."
Senior Jeremy Veal's three
pointer put the Sun Devils up by five
early in overtime and was the only
field goal the Sun Devils scored in
the extra period.

"What we did is v\e sustained
(our game plan) for 4<) minutes, and
we kept it up to 45 minutes," Ari
zona State coach Don Newman said.
"We've been shooting at it all vear.
and we finally get to bring one
home."
Even before the game, it was ob
vious the Sun Devils were pumped.
Their shouting could be heard
throughout the hall leading to their
locker room and the noise carried
into the nearby press room.
"We wanted to come in here and
focus," Newman said. "Today, on
this floor, we were the better team."
Stanford, admittedly, overlooked
the Sun Devils in its preparation for
the Thursday game against Arizona.
The Cardinal has had to battle

through each of the last three game v
and none of the next four games oif.
