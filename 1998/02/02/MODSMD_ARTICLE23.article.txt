Do the laws of physics apply in
the sport of gymnastics? For a cou
ple of moments Friday in the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team win
192.850-192.025 over Arizona, it
was doubtful.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Friday: Stanford 192.85. Arizona
192.025

Whether it was junior co-captain
Amy Murakami suspended in
midair in a handstand during her
bars routine for what seemed like
forever or sophomore Larissa
Fontaine defying gravity on the bal
ance beam with a "You think I'm
going to fall on my head" maneuver,
science was definitely in question
Friday night, but the Cardinal's skill
was not.
"It was great to finally get a win,"
said head coach Mark Cook. "It's
good to know we are gelling as a
team and refining our routines."

Even though the No. 13 Cardinal
(1-2,1-2 Pacific 10 Conference) was
behind 48.425-48.2 after their first
event, the vault, it was a good sign.
No. 19 Arizona (1-5. 0-2) had
opened with the uneven parallel
bars, the Wildcats' strongest event.
I he Cardinal lared well on vault
with Murakami, Fontaine and se
nior co-captain Keri Monahan all
scoring above 9.7.
A lead of two-tenths of a point
wasn't good enough as bars was the
next event for the Cardinal. Stan
ford performed well enough to steal
the lead from the Wildcats bv six
tenths of a point (96.9-96.3). Mona
han led the way for the Cardinal
with a 9.775 and dazzled a packed
Burnham Pavilion with her lengthv
handstands.
The event marked the debut of a
former Canadian Olympian, fresh
man Jennifer Exaltacion. who has
been out with a stress fracture. De
spite the fact that it was her first col
legiate competition and she hadn't
competed since July. Exaltacion
rocked the bars with a 9.7
"It was a different format than

what I was used to, so I was really
nervous," Exaltacion said. "Hut I
had been waiting for so long, and
when I heard the crowd cheering, I
used that energy."
Balance beam, a point of con
tention for the team after four gym
nasts fell in last week's meet, was the
squad's third event. The team's
mental training must have helped,
because each gymnast looked
poised and relaxed before starting.
Competing for the first time this
year on the beam, Fontaine nailed
her routine with a 9.7.
"I think this is a turning point in
the season," Fontaine said. "It was
our third meet, and we all got it to
gether mentally. Now we have
somewhere to go."
While the Cardinal was in prime
form throughout the night, the judg
ing was not. ( ook posed a number
of inquiries regarding the scoring
lor the balance beam after numer
ous Stanford gymnasts hit their rou
tines but were given poor scores.
" I he officials were flow n in from
I tah because of lack of local judges,
and I think they were confused with

0
the code." Cook said. "I was ups£{
but we were trying to focus on our
performance and not our scores." '•
The team wrapped up the me£*
with the floor exercise. The g\iij

Sophomores Tracey Kohl ana
Sarah Harding came throui*
strong with scores of y.K aiij

performance in the final eve»
was enough to seal their first vi£»

"Our team score is not reflect i \ j*

Cook said. "I was happy with o ii
performance, and I loved thi£

His team agreed with him.
"I think this is the most
tent we've ever been at this point iif
the season." Monahan said. "No\ir
we can add in difficulty."
