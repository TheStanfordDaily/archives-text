# Cheers for anti-209 panelists; cool reception for supporters
##

On Friday afternoon, the Center for Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity brought together six
people to find out what happens when the affirmative
action experts stop being polite and start getting real.
About 200 people filled Kresge Auditorium for a
panel titled. "In the Wake of Proposition 209: Race
and Opportunity." to hear the panelists' opinions ...
and to voice their own.
The crowd greeted affirmative action supporters
with cheers and loud clapping. Audience favorites
were UC-Berkeley Ethnic Studies Prof. Ron Takaki;
Constance Rice. Western legal council for the Nation
al Association for the Advancement of Colored Peo
ple Legal Defense Fund; and Santiago Rodriguez, for
mer director of multicultural programs at Apple, Inc.
Proclaiming equality to be one of the most impor
tant American ideals, iukaki asserted new affirmative
action reform needed to be undertaken.
"Measures used to measure merit reallv aren't

quantifiable," Takaki said. "How do you measure in
sightfulness?"
Takaki advocated widespread education reforms:
ending property taxes for school financial support, cut
ting defense expenditures to redirect lunds to educa
tion and other types of resource redistribution.
The other main crowd-pleaser was Rice, an ardent
opponent of the initiative process.
Rice held that affirmative action should not be ad
dressed on an initiative. "You cannot start a conversa
tion on something as complex as race and class and
gender in a war environment." Rice said.
Rice's main example against race issues being de
cided by initiatives was Proposition 2W itself, the ini
tiative passed in 19% that eliminated affirmative ac
tion policies within California's state government.
"(Proposition 209] was a political strategy that was to
wedge white Democrats away and put them into the Re
publican party." Rice asserted, 'it was a racial wedge
strategy that was to pii ui> against one another and in-
crease the racial divisions with fear."
Rice, though opposing the initia
tive. did support affirmative action
reform. She called upon politicians
to strengthen their will to work to
gether on "bigger issues" like school
reform.
"Don't give me a slogan," Rice
said. "Give me a program and tell
me systematically how we're going
to reach all those kids."
Rice also proclaimed public apa
thy to be a central reform problem.
"We're not interested in solving the
problem," Rice said. "We're inter
ested in scapegoating and escaping
our fears."
Rodriguez called for greater di
versity in society. The first step, he
said, was overcoming current group
prejudices. "Notions of race are cul
turally bound," Rodriguez ex
plained.
As much as the crowd liked

Takaki, Rice, and Rodriguez, it dis
liked UC-San Diego Law Prof. Gail
Herriot, who co-chaired the Propo
sition 209 Committee.
"Look, ladies and gentlemen,
the post-Proposition 209 caravan is
rolling and we're going to have to
adopt new programs," Herriot said.
Citing a Harvard study that re
ported success for a Milwaukee
urban voucher plan, Herriot sug
gested vouchers were a viable alter
native to affirmative action.
"[Vouchers] are doing a good deal
better than racial preferences
have," Herriot said.
Speaking against affirmative ac
tion, Chico State University History
Prof. Charles Geshekter, who was
an adviser to the Proposition 209
committee, did not cater to the
crowd either.
Geshekter pointed out affirma
tive action implementation prob
lems: increased bureaucracy, lack of
public accountability for the direc
tion of education funds and unqual
ified students getting into college.
