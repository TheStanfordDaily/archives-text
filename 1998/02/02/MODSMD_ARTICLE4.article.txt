## Confidentiality issues interrupt testimony in dismissal hearing for psychiatry prof 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
A question of confidentiality Fri
day postponed the conclusion of tes
timony in hearings regarding Psychi
atry Prof. Adolf Pfefferbaum's dis
missal.
An independent hearings officer
hired by the Advisory Board of the
Academic Council is investigating

six disputed facts in the case. Upon
the officer's resolution of the six is
sues, the Advisory Board will deter
mine whether University President
Gerhard Casper's request to dismiss
Pfefferbaum from his Stanford post
is warranted.
The officer. UC-San Francisco
Law Prof. Richard Marcus, heard
three days of testimony in Decem
ber. but final statements bv lawvers

were postponed to allow for testi
mony from Richard Popp. senior as
sociate dean for academic affairs at
the School of Medicine, who w as out
of the country in December.
But Popp was unable to conclude
his testimony after a question from
Pfefferbaum's lawyer, Pete Mc-
Closkey. created a potential viola
tion of the University's confidential
ity policy. Marcus directed Eli

Gould, who is representing the Uni
versity. to determine what testimony
the policy would allow before meet
ing again to hear Popp's response
and both lawyers' closing state
ments.
Pfeffcrbaum retired from a posi
tion at the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs
Hospital in IW6. an action that the
I Jniversity considered to constitute a
retirement from his Stanford profes
sorship as well. Pfefferbaum has con
tested that view, saying he remains a
tenured professor. After a Santa
Clara County judge agreed with Pf
efferbaum in January Il>%.1 l >%. Casper
filed formal charges asking the Advi
sory Board to dismiss Pfefferbaum.
Popp's testimony encompassed
several of the issues before the hear
ings officer, including whether Pfef
ferbaum's research space and staff
were curtailed after he lost his posi
tion of deputy chief of staff at the
VA hospital, whether a letter of
counseling sent to Pfefferbaum was
circulated beyond normal channels
and whether the decision not to
allow Pfefferbaum to continue his
work at the hospital on "without
compensation" status was inconsis
tent with normal policy.
McCloskey questioned Popp
closely about how he dealt with an
other professor's letter of counsel
ing. asking if he had handled it in the
same way as Pfefferbaum's. But
Gould directed Popp not to answer
any specific questions about the
other professor because doing so
might violate confidentiality.
Popp did discuss his investiga
tion into a grievance filed bv Pfef

ferbaum with regard to loss of staff
and research space.
After speaking with then-VA
("hie! of Staff Richard Mazze, Popp
determined that Pfefferbaum was
victim only of general budget cuts at
the hospital, which affected other
staff members as well.
"The information I received was
that others had had their staff cut,"
Popp said. "I asked whether this
was something that related only to
Dr. Pfefferbaum. The answer was
that this related to the budget and
general cutbacks."
McCloskey asked whether Popp
had inquired if any other Stanford
affiliated VA personnel also had
their staff cut. and Popp responded
that he had only asked if Pfeffer
baum had been singled out.
Popp also testified that he was not
involved in discussion about whether
to grant Pfefferbaum "without com
pensation" status, which would
allow him to continue his work at the
VA hospital without pay. Ma/ze told
him Pfefferbaum's status had been
set to "without compensation" not
indefinitely, as Pfefferbaum con
tends. but for a few months so Pfef
ferbaum could conclude his work.
At earlier hearings in December,
Ma/ze had testified that the VA had
seen no reason to grant Pfeffer
baum "without compensation" sta
tus for longer than it look him to
conclude his pending research.
