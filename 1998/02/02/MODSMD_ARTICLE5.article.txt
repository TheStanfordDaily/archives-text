# Psychologists and sufferers fight shyness
## 
### Stephanie B. Luo 
Are you shy? If the answer is
yes, you're not alone. A 1991 study
shows that nearly half of all adults
consider themselves chronically
shy, a figure up from 40 percent in
the early 1970'5. In fact, the 1994
National Co-morbidity Survey
shows that 13.3 percent of our pop
ulation experiences lifelong six-ial
phobia.
Shyness is held by psychologists
to be the reversal of the self-en
hancement bias, the idea that the
average person credits himself for
success, and assigns failure to exter
nal or temporary sources. While a
shy person may not behave this way
in academic affairs, he is likely to do
so in interpersonal situations.
Unknown to many, a solution to
the problem is available on campus.
The Counseling and Psychological
Services Center offers eight-week
group sessions each quarter dealing
with shyness. This' program runs

parallel to the work of the Shyness
Institute, a private organization off
campus.
Lvnne Henderson, who is co-di
rector of The Shyness Institute and
a visiting scholar in the psychology
department, works regularly with
cases of shyness and is working on a
comprehensive study with Psychol
ogy Prof. Philip Zimbardo.
"There are particular negative,
automatic thoughts that people
have when they feel shy in social sit
uations," Henderson said.
"They're apt to jump to conclu
sions, over-generalize. They think
things like, i won't be interesting to
other people, or 1 won't be able to
think of something to say.' "
Research done by Zimbardo
and Henderson examines the
premise that during this technolog
ical age, it is not surprising that
more people see themselves as shy.

Zimbardo and Henderson find that
the need for human interaction has
lessened dramatically.
In the Silicon Valley, computer
related work and scientific labora
tories are abound. In this fast-paced
world, social time is limited, with in
formation exchange based on effi
ciency and speed.
The shyness counseling center is
located at the Cowell Student Health
Center. The shyness counseling pro
gram. which began in 1990, limits
group size to eight students, meets
once a week and provides a comfort
able setting for students. Flyers are
posted and interested students may
come in at any time.
"It's really nice to have a support
system because there are a lot of
people on campus who probably
struggle with shyness and don't feel

comfortable talking to other people
about it," Henderson said. "A lot of
what makes it work really well is that
they take risks with each other in the
groups and they practice."
Henderson added that "shyness
itself, the experience, is probably
nearly universal. Everybody proba
bly has it. or most people have it
from time to time."
Activities are focused on role
plaving exercises, in which students
participate in simulated nerve
wracking situations. Some may feel
uncomfortable or shy when asking
someone out, visiting with profes
sors or even talking in class. By
practicing beforehand, they are able
to shake off some of the anxiety and
fear that accompanies shyness.
One student, a self-proclaimed
shy person, feels skeptical about the
program.
"I would feel uneasy about going
to the clinic," said senior Lydia
Choi. "I would only go if it ad
vanced me in a practical sense, such
as for job interviews."
