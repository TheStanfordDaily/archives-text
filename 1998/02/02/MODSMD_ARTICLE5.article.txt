# Psychologists and sufferers fight shyness

### Stephanie B. Luo 
Are you shy? If the answer is
yes, you're not alone. A 1991 study
shows that nearly half of all adults
consider themselves chronically
shy, a figure up from 40 percent in
the early 1970'5. In fact, the 1994
National Co-morbidity Survey
shows that 13.3 percent of our pop

group sessions each quarter dealing
with shyness. This' program runs

parallel to the work of the Shyness
Institute, a private organization off
campus.
Lvnne Henderson, who is co-di
rector of The Shyness Institute and
a visiting scholar in the psychology
department, works regularly with
cases of shyness and is working on a
comprehensive study with Psychol
ogy Prof. Philip Zimbardo.
"There are particular negative,
automatic thoughts that people
have when they feel shy in social sit

"They're apt to jump to conclu
sions, over-generalize. They think
things like, i won't be interesting to
other people, or 1 won't be able to
think of something to say.' "
Research done by Zimbardo
and Henderson examines the
premise that during this technolog
ical age, it is not surprising that
more people see themselves as shy.
