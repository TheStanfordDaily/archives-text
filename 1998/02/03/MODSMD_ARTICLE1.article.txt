## Student and faculty tenure opinions Faculty, students disagree on tenure 
### Bill Bowen Contributing writer 
Faculty members and students do not see-eye-to
eye on the tenure process, according to a recent poll
taken by the Stanford University Issues Forum.
Freshman Bryan Hughes and sophomore Sarah
McMullen, the group's officers, surveyed 69 faculty
members from a variety of disciplines including com

pology, political science and linguis
tics. Nearly 90 students responded
to a similar survey by e-mail.
The group conducted the poll in
preparation for last night's forum on
the faculty tenure process, which in
cluded both faculty and student
opinions as well as information
about the process and the issues that
surround it.
"We wanted a forum where peo
ple from administration, faculty and
the student body could address is
sues surrounding the tenure
process," Hughes explained. "We
used the poll to identify what peo
ple's concerns were and where they
needed more information."
One of the more surprising re
sults showed that 47 percent of stu
dents surveyed knew nothing about
the tenure review process at Stan
ford. McMullen said.
"It was surprising how quick stu
dents were to admit they didn't
know enough about the tenure
process, but still maintained opin

ions on system bias and tenure qual
ifications," she said. "The most valu
able part of the survey was seeing
the responses of professors and the
insights they were willing to offer
into the tenure system and student
interest in the process and willing
ness to learn more."
According to Hughes, the survey
results highlighted the major differ
ences between student and faculty
opinions of the tenure process.
"Most of the faculty seemed con
tent with the current process," said
Hughes, but "students that know
about it seem dissatisfied."
On the whole, students were
more likely than faculty to believe
the tenure system was biased toward
white males.
While 67 percent of faculty felt
there was no institutional bias to
ward men, 20 percent of the respon
dents felt one existed. Among stu
dents, 31 percent of students felt a
bias toward men and 13 percent
didn't see such a bias. Similarly, the
majority of faculty felt there was no
institutional bias toward whites
while more students felt there was.
There was also a large disparity

between faculty and student opinion
concerning end-quarter evaluations.
"One of the most surprising re
sults of the survey was that 6S per
cent ol faculty felt these examina
tions should only play a moderate
role in determining tenure, and 22
percent felt they should play a mini
mal role in the tenure process,"
Hughes said. "The faculty does not
seem supportive of students having
a large role in the selection process."
Among students, however, only 6
percent felt that evaluations should
have a minimal role versus 72 per
cent who felt they should be of mod
erate concern.
Despite these differences in opin
ion. the issues forum hopes to use
the poll information to find accept
able compromises between faculty
and student desires.
"We're trying to break down that
barrier," Hughes said. "If we know
where the differences between fac
ulty and student perspectives lie,
that will be the best opportunity for
us to find common ground. We can
see where each side needs to address
the other and why they are con
cerned about the tenure process."
