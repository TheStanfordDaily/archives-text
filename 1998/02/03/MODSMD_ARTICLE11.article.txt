## International envoys urge compromise in Iraq 
### 
BAGHDAD. Iraq (AP) With
the I nited States pressing lor sup
port for a possible military strike.
Russia, I ranee and Mamie leaders
were rushing envoys to Iraq yester
day to push lor a peaceful end to the
standoff over U.N. weapons inspec
tions.
A Russian envoy spoke with
President Saddam Hussein in Bagh
dad. leading the way among Iraq's
sympathizers in pushing for a diplo
matic solution. France. Turkey, the-
Arab League, Jordan and Palestini
an Iradei Yasser Arafat all launched
their own peace missions and
appeals to Saddam.
Envoys from Russia. France and
Turkey would stress the same mes
sage. France's Foreign Ministry said:
The danger would end only it Iraq
gave in to IJ.N. demands for full
access to all suspected weapons sites.
At the United Nations. Secre
tary-General Kofi Annan asked the
Security Council to double the
amount of oil Iraq can sell under an
exemption to a U.N. embargo. The
United States and Britain, Iraq's
leading adversaries on the council,
indicated they could go along with

the increase for humanitarian rea
sons. The slep could ease tensions in
the crisis.
For its part. Iraq insisted it was
open to anything that would help
avert attack.
"Iraq will not neglect any oppor
tunity that will help it foil American
schemes to direct a military strike
against it." Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed Al-Sahhaf told
an emergency session of Iraq's
National Assembly.
The intercession by Iraq's allies
came as Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright visited Saudi
Arabia. Kuwait and Bahrain, mak
ing Washington's case lor military
force to end the standoff.
Iraq repeatedly has refused to
allow U.N. inspectors into Saddam's
palaces and other off-limits sites,
drawing the American threats to
attack.
The inspectors are trying to
determine whether Iraq has
destroyed its chemical and biological
weapons programs, and a U.N.
embargo imposed after the IWO
invasion of Kuwait is to stand until
that and other conditions are met.

Iraqi IJ.N. Ambassador Nizar
Hamdoon said Iraq would fax
House Speaker Newt Gingrich an
invitation to send a congressional
delegation to one of Saddam's off
limits palaces.
"We want to allow them to make
sure for themselves there are no pro
hibited items in those sites." Ham
doon said
Britain said it would draft a U.N.
Security Council resolution
demanding that Baghdad grant the
weapons inspectors "full and unre
stricted access" to all sites.
The resolution could lay the
foundation for military action. It
would run the risk, however, of veto
bv Iraq's sympathizers — Russia.
( hina or France — among the five
permanent Security Council mem
bers.
In New York. Annan made
clear he hoped Washington would
not act on its own. but refused to
say if he believed it had the
authority to do so: "I think the
international community has
acted in unison on Iraq in the past,
and I think everyone would want
to maintain that unity."
