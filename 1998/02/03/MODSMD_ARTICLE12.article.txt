AIDS deaths decrease
CHICAGO (AP) — AIDS deaths
across the United States dropped a stun
ning 44 percent in the first half ol last year,
showing the power of new treatments to
control the disease.
Doctors have known almost since they
began widely prescribing potent three-drug
combinations two years ago that fewer
people with AIDS were dying, but even the
experts seem surprised by the scope of
their success.
"We can't see the end of the epidemic,
but it's the beginning of a new era." said
Dr. Kevin DeCock of the national Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta.
The latest evidence of this change anwe
yesterday when CDC officials presented
new data at the Fifth Conference on Retro
viruses and Opportunistic Infections.
Deaths from AIDS peaked in 1994 and
1995, then nosed downward in 1996. l.ast
year, that fall accelerated.
"Treatment is having a marked, dramat
ic impact on AIDS mortality." said the
CDC's Dr. Patricia Fleming.
According to the CDC. 12,040 Ameri
cans died of AIDS in the first half of 1997,
compared with 21,460 in the lirst half ol
1996. The total nationwide figures for last
year will not be tallied until July. Experts
attribute the improving figures to better
treatments, not any advances in preventing
people from catching HIV.
Texas to execute woman
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A state board
unanimously rejected Karla Faye I ucker's
bid for clemency vesterday. leaving only

the Supreme Court and the governor with
the power to halt the pickax killer's sched
uled execution today.
Despite pleas of mercy, including one
from Pope John Paul 11. the gruesome
nature of her crime left the Board of Par
dons and Paroles with no qualms, the
chairman said. They turned down Tucker
16-0. with two members abstaining.
"There is no question as to their vote.
There is no question as to how they feel."
said chairman Victor Rodriguez. "I.
myself, have absolutely no quarrel with the
decision to deny Tucker's request on all
fronts."
Tucker. 3X. a former teen-age prostitute
who found religion in prison, would be the
tirst woman executed in 1 exas since the
Cii'il War. I lei execution is scheduled for
today at 6 p.m. (SI
In her appeal before the Supreme
Court. Tucker's attorneys contend the
commutation process is flawed and uncon
stitutional in part because ol the consistent
lack of favorable rulings.
All 7b requests since 1993 have been
rejected, including 16 last year when the
state executed a record 37 convicted
killers.
" Texas has no mercy," said David Hots
lord. Tucker's lawyer. " The clemency pro
cess in this state is a farce."
He added that Tucker was still hopeful
that the Supreme Court would hear her
appeal.
"She's upbeat." he said.
Rodriguez said neither her gender nor
her newfound religion played a role in the
board's decision. The board also rejected
her request for a 60 or 90-dav reprieve to
allow courts time to consider her challenge
to the state's clemency process.
