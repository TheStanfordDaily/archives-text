### 
WASHINGTON (AP)- Proclaiming
an era of fat federal surpluses. President
Clinton unveiled a $1.73 trillion budget
yesterday claiming the first surpluses in 30
years and pumping billions to schools,
health and child care. Republicans saw a
big government revival, and House Speak
er Newt Gingrich scoffed. ' This is a bud
get only a liberal could love."
Clinton's fiscal 1W C > proposal plays
political offense and defense simultane
ously. thanks to huge windfalls from a
possible tobacco settlement and from a

surging economy that has generated soar
ing federal revenues.
The president would please Democrats
by pouring money into a wide sweep of
initiatives, including hiring teachers,
boosting scientific research and expand
ing welfare. He would cater to Republi
cans by producing a $9.5 billion surplus
next year and $1.1 trillion in black ink
through the decade. Hut he again warned
them to leave that money alone vvhile a
solution to the long-term fiscal ills facing
Social Security is found.

"You can have a smaller government
hut a more progressive one that gi\es you
a stronger America." Clinton said at a
White House ceremony.
GOP leaders were buying none of
that. They complained that the president
was unleashing tens of billions of dollars
in nev. programs over the next five years,
producing a balanced budget but also a
bigger one than necessary, lhey
promised to come up with a leaner plan
of their own that emphasized tax cuts, not
new snendine.
