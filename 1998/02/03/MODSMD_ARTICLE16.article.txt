## Editorial Demystifying tenure 
### 
SUNIF forum opens
dialogue between
faculty and students

Although last night's
Stanford University Issues
Forum may not have revolu
tionized Dean John Shoven's outlook
on the tenure process, it was a posi
tive first step towards explaining a
process that mystifies and frustrates
students and faculty alike.
The attention that the Akhil Gupta
and Karen Sawislak tenure cases have
gained in the past year is indicative of
campus interest in the tenure process.
However, many students read front
page stories about tenure appeals and
still feel bewildered.
Last night's open forum should be
welcomed as an effort on the part of
administrators, faculty and students to
grapple with the institution of tenure
rather than focusing exclusively on
individual cases.
The forum organizers recognized
that students need to understand the
broader context behind specific tenure
cases. Students want to know how
tenure decisions are made, why some
students and faculty are demanding
reforms, how they can influence tenure
decisions and how they can challenge a
ruling that seems unfair.

Part of the reason students are
angry about the tenure process
results from a sense that University
administrators care less about a pro
fessor's teaching skills than about his
or her academic reputation. Students
come to Stanford to find quality men
tors and teachers who care about
them.
The problem is that by the time
tenure is denied to a professor, there
is little that students can do to help.
But students can be constructively
involved in the tenure process prior to
the initial decision. Many departments
routinely solicit students and recent
graduates to write letters of recom
mendation on behalf of professors
undergoing evaluation for tenure.
Hopefully, last night's forum will
encourage students to take advantage
of such opportunities.
It may be that once students under
stand more about the tenure process,
they will decide that the system is
workable and fair.
But it is also possible that they will
question the system that not only
decides which professors receive
tenure, but also influences the content
of their classes.
Open dialogue that includes stu
dents, faculty and administrators is
only the first step in the process of
educating everyone about tenure and
the issues surrounding it.
