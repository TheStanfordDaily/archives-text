Badger's comments
incendiary in nature
Brandon Badger's letter on abortion
( Thursday. January 29. 1998) captured my
attention with its comparison between a sci
ence fiction movie and a medical procedure.
Even if he had provided some scientific evi
dence for the parallel he draws between
aborted fetuses and the bugs in "Men In
Black," I found the article's call for every
woman considering an abortion to "be a
responsible adult" (by abstaining or using
birth control) needlessly incendiary.
While there is perhaps no easy way to
resolve the division between people's differ
ent conceptions of when life begins, his let
ter ignores the frustrating realities women
face when making this choice.
I find it ironic that, for all his references
to the "powerless" and his plea that "A lit
tle responsibility on OUR part is little to
ask." he doesn't acknowledge the other side
of the gender equation.
In many instances, the male "responsible
adult" of the baby-making equation does
not stay around long enough to offer finan
cial or emotional support to the pregnant
woman, provide a safe household or care
for the child.
Considering that we live in a society in
which early sexual activity is a source of
prestige and status for teenage males, yet
stigmatizes many young women as "sluts."
it is unfortunate that his letter places the
blame for unplanned pregnancies solely on
females.
When one considers how single parent

households have increased over the last
decade, as well as the dramatic spending
cuts the government has recently imposed
on welfare and other programs that offer
aid to low-income single parent families, it
seems that women are taking on more than
their share of responsibility.

Infantile behavior at
Flicks was callous
If I have learned one thing during my
three years at this school, it is this: Chxkl
SAT scores, impressive high school GPAs,
and flashy records of extracurricular achieve
ment are not even remotely commensurate
with emotional intelligence, maturity, dignity
and overall human decency.
Unfortunately, this point was proven yet
again during the 10 p.m. showing of Neil
Laßute's "In the Company of Men" at
Flicks this past Sunday. The audience
response to this movie was infantile and
reeked of callousness; it greatly disgusted
me. Laßute's film presents a scathing look
into the dark heart of an ordinary man. It is
a gripping and disquieting work.
Upon initially viewing the movie, I was
profoundly disturbed; the film caused me to
l<K>k deep within and question my sense of
decency.
Upon witnessing the response of a cer
tain segment of the crowd at Flicks to this
movie — a segment who. judging by the
timbre of their voices, was overwhelming
male — I was utterly appalled. Iliese peo

pie found hilarity in situations that overtly
devalued the lives of females and the hand
icapped. Lines such as, "I don't trust any
thing that bleeds for a week and doesn't
die," and, "Women are nothing more than
meat and gristle filled with hatred," were
met with uproarious laughter and applause.
Further, when the deaf woman's voice
was likened to a dolphin's, laughter erupted
again. These are just a few isolated exam
ples from a disgusting pattern of behavior
that developed over the course of the film.
Also, it is incredible to note that even as the
depths of this woman's suffering became
more apparent and increasingly acute, the
laughter never lessened.
I would like to chalk this repugnant
response up to the mob mentality that
inevitably arises whenever you get a group
of people together — a mentality which,
admittedly, can make for a fun night of
laughter and audience interaction when B
movie horror flicks like "I Know What You
Did Last Summer" and action / suspense
flicks like "The Ciame" are playing.
But "In the Company of Men" is an
entirely different type of movie with an
extremely sensitive subject matter, and I
fear that the audience response points
toward the fact that something deeper may
be at work here.
To those faceless cowards who laughed
while safely cloaked under the cover of a
darkened theater, I say this: Search deep
within yourselves and seek to determine
why you behaved in this manner. I.for one.
will freely declare that I did not enjoy being
in the company of such men.

Remtulla forgets that
fuzzies make millions
I read Aly Remtulla's column about his
fear that Stanford is becoming SIT, and I
want to contribute my two cents. I received
a Bachelor of Science from Stanford in 19%
and am working as an investment banker.
Thus according to Remtulla, I am doubly
guilty. However, in reply to Mr. Remtulla's
suggestions that only scientists and engi
neers are money-grubbing, cold-hearted
monsters, let me present a dose of reality.
The highest paid jobs out of college are
still those in "business" — investment bank
ing and management consulting. Many
more "fuzzies" are employed in these pro
fessions than "techies." For those "fuzzies"
who resist the temptation of the bank
ing / consulting route, there is law school.
So investing money in philosophy and
political science might have the unfortunate
consequence of creating more investment
bankers, consultants and lawyers.
I"he reason that engineering and science
get a disproportionate share of money is
because of the structure of the U.S. econo
my and the private educational system.
Intellectual property is where the U.S. has
its economic strength — that is why compa
nies will donate money to engineering and
biology departments.
If Mr. Remtulla could get the many
wealthy humanities grads of Stanford to
donate the money for state-of-the-art build
ings. many of his concerns would be non
existent. In fact, a Korean engineering firm
paid for a Korean Studies program at Stan

lord. Perhaps Mr. Remtulla could ask the
numerous financially successful South
Asians in Silicon Valley to facilitate the con
struction of a South Asian Studies program.
Humanities and social sciences are an
integral part of the human experience. But I
deplore the attitude that rejects the pursuit
of science as a "necessary wvil" at best and
an unmitigated disaster at worst.
Mr. Remtulla should understand that
the reason engineers in the Silicon Valley
do so well is because U.S. educational insti
tutions produce far too few engineers. High
demand causes salaries to skyrocket.
The only advice I can lend to Mr. Rem
tulla is to point to another Stanford exam
ple. The founders of Excite included four
computer science engineers and one politi
cal science major, Joe Kraus. Mr. Kraus was
able to lend his negotiation and business
skills to the search engine company and is a
millionaire today.
Maybe Mr. Remtulla can befriend some
good engineers. Mr. Remtulla should be
proud to advertise his AH once he becomes
the next Silicon Valley sensation. Maybe he
could pay the multimillion dollar sum for
the first endowed professorship in South
Asian Studies. Who knows, I may too, in
spite of my BS, if I get rich some day.
