## Don't let religion separate us 
### 
IDO NOT believe that
any one religion has a
corner market on
God. Religion is limited
by geography. God. how
ever. is unlimited and
exists in the hearts of all
men and women.

I do read the Bible, but I am not literal
istic or legalistic. I do not believe that
every chapter and verse in the Bible can be
literally translated. The principles are what
is important; God within your heart should
guide your life. That little voice that tells
you what is right and wrong is the presence
of God in your life. Listen to that voice.
Religion is good, but it is the creation of
man and thus, imperfect. We need religion
for instruction and guidance in our spiritu
ality. To my knowledge, most religions
teach us to be good citizens and moral
beings. Unfortunately, there are distinc
tions that create tensions and walls of sep
aration between men and women. I wish
that somehow we could eradicate the ten
sions and tear down those walls.
My relationship with God is intimate. I
am a Christian, though 1 dislike calling
myself that. What does that mean? The
word itself means nothing. I believe in
Jesus Christ, but saying you believe in
Jesus means nothing. God is concerned
with how you live your life. Jesus Christ is
an entity, exemplifying all that is good

(love, peace, patience, mercy, grace, for
giveness, etc...). There are many so-called
"Christians" that exemplify none of these
characteristics, and there are numerous
people from different religions who
embody all of these characteristics.
Some children are raised and taught
about Mohammed. From birth, their par
ents teach them the Islamic religion. These
children can no more say that they believe
in Jesus Christ than I can say 1 believe in
Mohammed. Does this mean that they are
perishing and damned to hell? Certainly
not! Agreeing to this would be saying that
God, who created every living thing, sen
tenced those children to damnation. God,
who is all knowing, knew that those chil
dren were never going to be able to believe
in the name Jesus Christ. And the God
that I know would never damn a righteous
soul because he or she cannot say some
name.
When Helen Keller was a little girl, a
priest came to communicate with her and
tell her about Jesus Christ. When he fin
ished, Helen told the priest that she had
already known Jesus Christ. Helen said
that she had met Him in her heart. From a
literalistic perspective, Helen was damned
to hell. Prior to the visit from the priest
Helen had no way of knowing about the
son of God. She was blind so she could not
read about Christ. She was deaf so no one
could tell her about Christ. But we cannot

limit God. He can reveal himself in an infi
nite number of ways. Helen Keller could
not say the name Jesus Christ, but she did
know Him.
The name is not important. 1 would
argue that everyone in this world who lis
tens to that little voice in his or her heart is
listening to Jesus Christ. I am not con
cerned with what you call it or what reli
gion you belong to. I am only concerned
with your actions and intentions. Any man
or wojpan who lives a righteous life can sit
in my home and sip from my cup.
CIV class taught me to fight for my reli
gious beliefs. Wisdom is teaching me to
fight for the just and the righteous. In the
Stanford community, everyone wants to be
right. We all believe that we have the truth.
But no one can have the full truth. You can
go to the Atlantic Ocean and bring back a
filled cup, but you can never have all of the
Atlantic Ocean. God is too big to under
stand completely.
We should not let religion divide and
separate us as a Stanford community or as
a human race. In as much as religion cre
ates division and keeps us from loving our
neighbor, it is not good. The greatest com
mand that my God gave to me was to love
my neighbor and love my God with all of
my heart, mind and soul.
