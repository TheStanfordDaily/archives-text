# Forum sheds light on controversial decisions
## 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Staff writer 
Faculty members, administrators and students put
the tenure process under a magnifying glass last night
in a panel discussion sponsored by the Stanford Uni
versity Issues Forum.
Speakers included Senior Assoc. Provost Kathrvn
Ciillam, Dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven, Political Science Prof. David
Brady, Computer Science Prof. Terry Winograd, His
tory Prof. James Sheehan and doctoral student Chuck
Carlson.
Carlson, a member of the Coalition to Tenure
Karen Sawislak, explained that four major issues have
come up during the past year's debate on tenure, fueled
by Shoven's decisions not to grant tenure to two hu
manities professors despite unanimous approval bv
their departments.
Carlson identified the role of teaching and advising
in tenure decisions, the question of who decides tenure
and how. the evaluation of innovative and non-tradi
tional scholarship and the question of the University's
commitment to diversity among tenured faculty as fac
tors that need to be discussed.
The panel began tackling these issues by discussing
the nuts and bolts of the tenure process.
Tenure approval requires a positive vote by depart
mental faculty, the dean's office and the University
president, all of whom are advised by faculty commit
tees. Ciillam explained.
A great deal of the decision process is based on let
ters written by outside experts in the applicant's field of
research that rank the applicant against five or six ex
perts in the field, said Brady.
"You'd better be No. 1 or No. 2," he added.
If an applicant appeals a negative decision, three cri
teria are examined in evaluating the appeal: Was the
process carried out properly? Were the right criteria

used? Does the conclusion follow from the evidence?
"The person reading the grievance does not re
judge the merits of the case." (iillam noted.
Brady stressed that the high standards imposed dur
ing the tenure process are necessary to ensure the qual
ity of faculty at Stanford.
"We have a talented student bod\. and we want to
have a talented faculty." he added.
One of the major complaints of students fighting lor
the tenure of Assoc. Anthropology Prof. Akhil (iupt;i
(who won an appeal and is now tenured) and Asst. His
tory Prof. Karen Sawislak has been that teaching and
student evaluations are not influential enough in
tenure decisions.
()ne of the reasons student evaluations play a minor
role in the decision process is that it is difficult to dis
tinguish between popularity and good teaching. Brad\
said.
However. Shoven added, "if your evaluation forms
sav, 'T his is the worst class I have ever taken." I don't

care it you'll win a Nobel Prize
you're not getting tenure."
Pressed by students in the audi
ence, Shoven later said that while
teaching isri't the most influential
factor, the emphasis placed on it has
increased during the past 15 years.
"1 believe we have a proper bal
ance in respect to teaching and
scholarship." he said.
The criteria lor granting tenure
reflect the University's values,
Winograd said.
"In order of priority, the current
process values respected research,
research advising, classroom teach
ing, influence on students and social

impact," he said.
Phe reason for the order of prior
ities lies in the way Stanford finances
its operations, Winograd added, cit
ing corporate research sponsorships
and large donations as examples of
interests influencing the Universi
ty's value system.
Sheehan agreed, but pointed
out that Winograd's examples of
corporate sponsorship apply more
in the fields of science and engi
neering.
"Tension [around the tenure
process] is more apparent in the
fields where implications of tenure
denial are grim," he added, explain
ing why recent controversies about
tenure at Stanford have involved
faculty in the School of Humanities
and Sciences rather than the School

of Engineering.
"Someone who does not get
tenure [in the Computer Science
Department] goes out to Silicon
Valley and doubles their salary,"
Winograd joked.
Several aspects of the tenure
process could change for the better,
Sheehan said.
"The best way to improve the sys
tem is to improve the quality of in
formation on which decisions are
made," he said.
Course evaluations should be re
vised. and the quality of recommen
dation letters from students and out
side experts also could be raised, he
stressed.
"Be more honest. Tell the truth."
Sheehan advised. "It's an essential
part of making the system work."
