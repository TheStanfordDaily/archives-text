### Alex Scherbakovsky Staff writer 
Faculty members, administrators and students put
the tenure process under a magnifying glass last night
in a panel discussion sponsored by the Stanford Uni
versity Issues Forum.
Speakers included Senior Assoc. Provost Kathrvn
Ciillam, Dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven, Political Science Prof. David
Brady, Computer Science Prof. Terry Winograd, His
tory Prof. James Sheehan and doctoral student Chuck
Carlson.
Carlson, a member of the Coalition to Tenure
Karen Sawislak, explained that four major issues have
come up during the past year's debate on tenure, fueled
by Shoven's decisions not to grant tenure to two hu
manities professors despite unanimous approval bv
their departments.
Carlson identified the role of teaching and advising
in tenure decisions, the question of who decides tenure
and how. the evaluation of innovative and non-tradi
tional scholarship and the question of the University's
commitment to diversity among tenured faculty as fac
tors that need to be discussed.
The panel began tackling these issues by discussing
the nuts and bolts of the tenure process.
Tenure approval requires a positive vote by depart
mental faculty, the dean's office and the University
president, all of whom are advised by faculty commit
tees. Ciillam explained.
A great deal of the decision process is based on let
ters written by outside experts in the applicant's field of
research that rank the applicant against five or six ex
perts in the field, said Brady.
"You'd better be No. 1 or No. 2," he added.
If an applicant appeals a negative decision, three cri
teria are examined in evaluating the appeal: Was the
process carried out properly? Were the right criteria

used? Does the conclusion follow from the evidence?
"The person reading the grievance does not re
judge the merits of the case." (iillam noted.
Brady stressed that the high standards imposed dur
ing the tenure process are necessary to ensure the qual
ity of faculty at Stanford.
"We have a talented student bod\. and we want to
have a talented faculty." he added.
One of the major complaints of students fighting lor
the tenure of Assoc. Anthropology Prof. Akhil (iupt;i
(who won an appeal and is now tenured) and Asst. His
tory Prof. Karen Sawislak has been that teaching and
student evaluations are not influential enough in
tenure decisions.
()ne of the reasons student evaluations play a minor
role in the decision process is that it is difficult to dis
tinguish between popularity and good teaching. Brad\
said.
However. Shoven added, "if your evaluation forms
sav, 'T his is the worst class I have ever taken." I don't
