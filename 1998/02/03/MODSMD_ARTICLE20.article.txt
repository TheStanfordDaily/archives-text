# Showering with the boys
## Vanessa Bartsch When we frolicked in the Land of Jell-O 
### 
ONCE, A LONG time ago, there
was a time when life wasn't quite
so serious. In a great land known
as Stanford, where true worries were few
and far between, life was good.
Freshmen were free and frolicked with
reckless abandon. Though it's now diffi
cult to believe, I was one of those frosh. A
mighty Branner frosh.
It was a prosperous time. CIV guaran
teed each freshman the chance to earn five
units of B+ without attending a single lec
ture. And there were open doors on every
hallway and 180 new accomplices for mis
chief any night of the week.
There were also places to visit on the
weekends called fraternities. And they
sometimes had parties.
Yes, this was so long ago that there
existed a Deke Jell-O Party. And a Deke,
for that matter.
And it is at the gala Jell-O affair that I
shall begin my tale.
It was a warm and starlit Friday night.
Those that had found that special some
one down the hall were co/.ily tucked away
on the top bunk of the inner room. Those
who had not were busily readying them
selves in shirts that maximized cleavage
while minimizing the "Freshman 15."

Thoughts of a place once known as
home, and people once known as parents
and hometown honeys, had long since
heen tossed out the window. Pre-parties
ruled the halls and strains of disco music
permeated the night.
After a bit of progressive merriment,
my epic journey began. I traveled with my
trusty hallmates down the sidewalks of
Campus Drive, my arms around my room
mate and my next door neighbor.
We soon arrived at a lovely house exud
ing rowdiness from every beam and rafter.
After Hashing our recently acquired IDs.
we were admitted to join the festivities.
To the yard we pushed, to watch many
poor and guileless frosh catching Jell-O in
their mouths, suckered by jaded frat hoys
into believing that there was actually alco
hol in the gelatin they consumed.
We watched them stagger and sway.
And hook up and get naked. All on
account of these sticky masses of red and
green being thrown about, stuck on and
licked off.
Alas, as we tried these lumps, our finer
taste buds recognized the cruel trick being
played. We shortly charged the stairs in
search of a more potent substance. We
were soon happily slurping away with a

kindly senior possessing a lull fridge.
The night wore on. We danced. We
laughed. We macked. We drank. We rev
eled in camaraderie.
And there came a time when I felt I
must leave. I found a guide to escort me
home and we walked arm in arm. holding
each other vertical, meandering down the
row.
After a romp behind Wilhur. we fared
each other well and I took my leave. I Jpon
arriving at the great doors of Branner, I
was overwhelmed by a dire need. An
internal desire not fueled by any rational
thought. And for reasons I have long since
forgotten. I knew what I needed to do.
I needed to check my mail.
So, at 2 a.m., with a bit of difficulty. I
wrenched the U-lock from my bicycle and
mounted the seat with a determined
effort.
Around the building I teetered,
unevenly pedaling on the sidewalk next to
Toyon. My balance was not at its finest
and shortly I was seen bombing off the
sidewalk, through the hedge and into the
Toyon parking lot.
Though a bit shaken, I valiantly man
aged to stay astride and continue onwards.
I even crashed my way back through the

hedge and onto the sidewalk once again.
1 rode on in my euphoric state, singing
to the night and wobbling on my way to
look for mail. I was the Fed Ex. The U.S.
Postal Service. Pony Express. UPS.
Hut just ahead, an evil darkness lurked.
A sinister creature feared by many. One
who possessed enough tickets for Califor
nia stops and ('-parking violations to
wreak fear into the heart of every student.
I here, in the shadows, a figure lurked,
his badge glimmering in the ambient light
ing of Crothers Memorial Hall. His shifty
eyes watched my every move. I began ped
aling faster, trying to escape his stony
ga/e. Alas, as I hit a the pace of a brisk
walk, the unthinkable happened. A large
cement bollard appeared before me. And
as my front tire struck the cold structure. I
tumbled to the ground, thrown from my
trusty steed.
The officer took notice and made his
move. As he approached, 1 gathered mv
wits, prepared to be cunningly suave.
"Well, hello, Occifer." 1 said coyly.
"Hi." he responded. Ah ha! I had him
right where I wanted him. Well, almost. I
would have preferred not to be lying on
the ground.
"You haven't been drinking, have

you?" the man in blue said.
"Nooooo! (J! course not!" I managed
with a poorly timed hiccup.
"You know, if you had been drinking. I
would have grounds to arrest you under
California law for biking under the influ
ence of alcohol," he said as my heartbeat
quickened. "And we wouldn't want that,
would we?"
"No?" I guessed.
"Right." he said, "so I am going to walk
you. and your bike back to your dorm,
because you are too smart to do something
like that, right?"
"Yes?" I said.
"Right, the officer said. I was getting
better at this And as the officer wheeled
me home, I realized life was good.
Indeed, it was a very long time ago. in a
place where a fair maiden and her trustv
two-wheeled steed could embrace a bit of
adventure. Because once upon a time,
before (iREs and looming futures, there
were adventures to be had.
So ends mv tale.
