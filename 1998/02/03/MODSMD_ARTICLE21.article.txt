The Card, playing at home, ended its first 30-win sea
son last year by going 7-3 in its last 10 games, including
victories over No. 6 Washington and No. 23 California.
Last season. Stanford posted nine wins over ranked
opponents while compiling an overall record of 31-27-1
and a 10-I<S record and fifth place finish within the Pacif
ic 10 C 'onference. Despite the strong finish, the Card did
not make it to the NCAA Tournament.
"We were so close to regionals last season we felt sort
of robbed by not receiving an NCAA berth." said junior
shortstop Michelle Schneider. "Our main goal this sea
son is to make it to regionals."
This season the Cardinal hopes to improve on last
year's successes; however. Stanford will have to win the

one-run ball games it lost last season
if it wants an invitation to this year's
NCAA tournament.
Stanford comes into the season
with a preseason ranking of fourth in
the Pac-1(), one of the toughest con
ferences in the nation.
"We hope to be able to win more
of the close games that we lost last
year." said junior pitcher / outfielder
Marcy Crouch. "We will have to
keep our focus and intensity up for

the entire seven innings if we want to
win the tight games."
The core of last year's team re
turns as Stanford brings back eight
starters and 11 letterwinners from
last year's squad. Four new faces join
the team to replace last year's gradu
ates, outfielder Katie Beattie, third
baseman Amanda Renteria, first
baseman Summer Lee and pitcher
Angela Webb.
Freshmen firstbaseman Jenny
Shideler and rightfielder Ramona
Shelburn are two newcomers ex
pected to have an immediate impact
on the team.

The Cardinal was perfect
against the Gaels last season,
sweeping the four-game series in
commanding fashion. Stanford de
feated Saint Mary's 8-0,7-1 on Feb.
12 in Moraga and embarrassed the
Gaels 10-0, 10-0 at Stanford, where
junior Becky Blevins threw a no
hitter in the first game of the dou
bleheader.
I'he Gaels return eight starters
and have two important additions to
their coaching staff: head coach
Michelle Putzer, who was an assis
tant last year at Stanford, and assis
tant coach Summer Lee.

"We know Stanford well because
of our previous affiliations, which
gives us an advantage with regard to
scouting reports," Putzer said. "We
also have a great group of athletes
and excellent hitters all through the
lineup."
The Gaels will look to come out
strong against Stanford's impressive
pitching and will have to play solid
defense if it hopes to beat the Card.
"Though Saint Mary's doesn't
get the big recruits or have the big
names, they are a pretty scrappy ball
club that cannot be taken lightly,"
Crouch said.
