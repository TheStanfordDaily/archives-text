WRESTLING

■ Saturday: Stanford 39, Portland State 3

As the Stanford wrestling team broke
down the mats after its meet against Portland
State, the usually reserved head coach
grabbed the announcer's microphone and.
with sufficient prompting, treated the crowd
to a few bars of "The Star Spangled Banner."
But it's easy to forgive Horpel for his en
thusiasm — that's what happens when your
team scores two falls, a tech and a major de
cision en route to a 39-3 romp. That's what
happens when your senior co-captain and
Ail-American wrestles as if his elbow injurv
were a thing of the past and when your 177-

pound freshman wrestles the match of his life
in the 275-pound division.
That's what happens when your team fi
nally puts together the performance they're
capable of: You sing.
"Every once in a while, you have a meet
where everyone wrestles up to their poten
tial." Horpel said. "This was one of those
meets."
Sophomores Kudy Rui/ and Zach Zim
merer began the meet with regular decisions
in the 118- and 126-pound divisions, respec
tively.
After freshman Jason TaJbott collected a
forfeit in the 134-pound weight class, junior
Beau Weiner laced a tough match against
Brad (ialletes, the Viking's second-win
ningest wrestler. Weiner brought an K-l lead
into the third period before bringing the
crowd to its feet with a wild, gambling pin.
"Beau rolled the wrong way out of a front
headlock." Horpelsaid. "It's called a
Ventriloquist. It's a very risky ma
neuver. hut if you pull it off, you're in
great position for a pin."
With the team score 18-0 in favor
of the Cardinal, junior H.J. Sanchez
quickly thrashed Viking sophomore
Wayne Miller. Stanford's leader in
team points, Sanchez scored three
takedowns, three near-falls and a re
verse en route to a 19-4 technical vie

tory.
"Sanchez basically made that kid
look foolish." said teammate John
Penn.
Alter Doug Bardsley's major de
cision in the 158-pound division, the
meet effectively was over, as Stan
ford led by 27 points with only four
matches left. Unfortunately for
Portland State, the meet continued,
as did Stanford's domination of the
hapless Vikings.
Junior Shane Cross and senior
co-captain Scott Chapman followed
with victories, and sophomore Tim

Kendall finished the Cardinal's scor
ing by overpowering Portland
State's Adam Thomas. Kendall was
well on his way to a technical victory
with a 13-0 lead before pinning
Thomas with a brutal Saturday
Night Ride.
Sophomore Morgan Flager, at
177 pounds, turned in a courageous
performance against Portland
State's true heavyweight in the 275-
pound weight class, eventually
falling 7-3 in Stanford's only loss of
the afternoon.
"Flager wrestled with a lot of

heart." Horpel said. "1 asked him if
he wanted to wrestle, and he said,
'Yeah!' So I asked him if he needed
to wrestle, and he said. 'Well, yeah!'
It all depends on what he wants to
do."
Stanford's clutch performance
couldn't have come at a better time,
as the Pacific 10 tournament is fast
approaching and with it the chance
to qualify for nationals.
"Basically, that was just an all
around good time," said redshirt
freshman Kayvon Bina. "That was
great — absolute devastation.
