# Diagnosis: fracture
## Folkl's finger leaves return in doubt 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
The had news got a little worse
for the sixth-ranked Stanford
women's basketball team yester
day.
Junior forward Kristin Folkl's
\-ra\s revealed two fractures in
her right hand, and the team is un
certain as to when she will return.
Folkl injured the hand in Satur
day's 80-71 win over then-fifth
ranked lexas lech.
With about eight minutes re
maining in the game, the 6-foot-2
forward drove down the left side of
the lane and went up for the shot.
Folkl was undercut by Texas
lech's Melinda Schmucker and
landed hard on her shooting hand.
To add insult to injury. Folkl's
teammate, senior center Olympia
Scott, went for the rebound and
landed on the hand as well.
At the time, Folkl's status was
uncertain, and doctors didn't think
she even needed an X-ray. Hut the
X-rays revealed a fracture in the
tip ot the right pinkie and a slight
fracture in the mid-joint of the ring
finger.
"The pain gt>cs in waves." Folkl
said. "Sometimes the throbbing
sensation is so strong it feels like
m\ heart is beating in my hand."
But even with the throbbing

pain. Folkl is optimistic. She is
scheduled to see a hand specialist
this morning, and her status will be
more clear after the visit.
"Despite not having an\ kind of
timeline. I feel extremely opti
mistic about when I'll be back,"
Folkl said. "I don't think it's very
serious, and I'm very excited to get
back on the floor."
The entire Stanford contingent
will be excited to get Folkl back.
She's currently averaging IK.N
points and 9.5 rebounds per game,
both team-leading, in just over 25
minutes of action per game
On the bright side, a Folkl ab
sence this week is better than an\
other time on the Cardinal sched
ule.
Stanford's only game this week
is a Friday matchup against Califor
nia at Maples Pavilion. I he Golden
Bears are 5-14 overall with a con
ference record of 1 -S. Cal is nding a
nine-game losing streak and has
not won a single game since losing
to Stanford Jan. 9.
"We're obviously very disap
pointed that there is a fracture and
hope it heals quickly," said head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "We
don't have a timeline yet. so it's dif
ficult to think about a plan There's
never a g»xxl time for an injury, but
we are at home now for two
weeks."
