■ Saturday: Stanford 7, Washing
ton State 0

■ Sunday: Stanford 7, Washington 2

Five singles players and all three
doubles squads went undefeated for
all three matches for the Cardinal (5-
0). Sophomore Teryn Ashley has yet
to lose a collegiate dual match after
five games this season. The 10th
ranked singles player in women's
tennis, Ashley is 27-0 in her career
dual matches for Stanford.
Against the Huskies, the tough
est of the Pac-10 Northern Division
teams, Washington managed to grab
two points against the Cardinal. But
Stanford ran away with five of six
singles matches and two of three
doubles matches to earn the victory.
"It was a good weekend for us,"
Ashley said. "It was good to get
some matches in before we played
Washington because they have a
pretty good team. There is some
good competition up there, and
Washington was really psyched to
play us."
In the No. 2 singles spot, senior
Julie Scott (4-0) cruised by Washing
ton's Zuzana Stunova 6-2,6-3. Ash
ley followed suit and moved to 5-0
on the year with a 6-3, 6-2 win over
Husky Peggy Wu.
Senior Ania Bleszysnki (4-0) and

freshman Sarah Pestieau (5-0) also
defeated their Washington counter
parts in straight sets. Erica Stoloff
fell victim to Bleszysnki 6-3, 6-2,
while Pestieau took care of Jenny
Svanfeldt 6-2,6-3.
"Everybody was ready to play
some serious matches," Ashley said
of her teammates. "We played
Hawaii twice and Asia, hut we want
ed to get some more matches in. On
the whole, everybody was focused
and very competitive."
The Huskies did take the No. 1
and No. 6 singles matches, however.
Washington's top singles player,
Kristina Kraszewski, earned an
enormous victory by upsetting Stan
ford sophomore Anne Kremer 1-6,
6-3,7-5. Kraszewski, the No. 34 play
er in the country, handed Kremer (3-
1) her first loss of this season.
Washington's Zeta Wagner also
was able to blemish the Cardinal's
scorecard with a 6-2, 6-4 win in the
No. 6 match vs. Stanford sophomore
Jennifer Heiser (3-1).
The Cardinal's top three doubles
teams remained unbeaten on the
year with three more wins against
the Huskies. In the top spot, ninth
ranked Ashley and Kremer (4-0)
took an 8-4 victory over Wu and
Kori Sosnowy. Seventh-ranked
Bleszysnki and Scott (3-0) rolled to
an 8-1 blowout of Kraszewski and
Stunova in the second spot, and
Pestieau and Heiser (4-0) edged
Wagner and Hannesdottir 9-7.
It was blowout city against both
Washington State and Oregon, who
combined could only push thrtje
matches into a third set against the
Cardinal.
Ashley. Pestieau and Heiser won
all of their respective matches
against the Ducks and Cougars in
straight-set fashion.
Oregon's Alina Wygonowska
pushed Kremer in their No. I
match as the sophomore Duck
took the first set and a 4-1 lead in
the second. But Krcmer, who de
feated Mary Pierce this summer,
stormed back for a 2-6. 6-4,6-1 vic
tory. Kremer bulldozed Washing
ton State's Tunde Nagy 6-0, 6-2 on
Saturday.

Cougars Erica Perkins and An
drea Reisz had mild success against
Scott and Bleszysnki, respectively,
managing to win one set each. But
both Cardinal players soon regained
their focus to the tune of three-set tri
umphs.
Perhaps even more significant
than the scores, the Cardinal was on
the road with its new roster for the
first time this season.

"We had a great time," Ashley
said. "This was the first time with the
starters all together in the same
place. It was good to have everybody
together."
The Cardinal dual match season
breaks for a couple of weeks for the
Rolex National Individual Tourna
ment in Dallas this weekend and re
sumes on Feb. 11 at home versus Pa
cific.
