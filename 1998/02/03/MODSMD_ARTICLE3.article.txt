# Stanford faculty advise on new state curriculum
## Profs set math standards 
### David Arulanantham Staff writer 
Four Stanford math professors,
acting as consultants to the State
Board of Education, helped rewrite
the math curriculum standards that
will be unveiled today.
Ralph Cohen, Gunnar Carlsson.
James Milgram and Steve Kerck
hoff advised a commission to devel
op the new education standards,
part of a statewide push to develop
curriculum guidelines for elemen
tary and secondary school in all of
the basic subject areas. The com
mission, which began meeting
about a year and a half ago, broken
down into subgroups, conducted
public inquiries and made recom

mendations to the State Board of
Education.
The Stanford professors helped
"correct errors and make state
ments more clear," Cohen said.
"Basically, our role was to act as
consultants to the State Board of
Education, and we didn't really
have much to do with the individual
standards," Milgram said. "All we
did was tocheck that the statements
made sense mathematically."
Working on the standards some
times meant more than clarifying
the language, though.
"The changes made were always
based on the mathematics, except
that at the board's insistence, we
put in Know the multiplication ta
bles' and 'Know how to do lone di

vision.' " Milgrani said. "Other
wise. if a standard was simply
wrong — and there were a number
like this — we deleted it.
"If it was poorly phrased and we
could figure out what was meant,
we tried to rewrite it to make it
clearer. We also moved standards
around."
The Stanford professors were
joined by experts in math-related
fields in the private and public sec
tors.
On the whole, the group was
pleased with the language of the
standards. The professors empha
sized that teachers still have leeway
in determininu the best wav for
their students to learn.
"The standards were really quite
good, hut we're not trying to say
how to teach third- or lOth-grade
math," Cohen noted. "We're just
recommending what students
should learn in preparation for col
lege and in life."
