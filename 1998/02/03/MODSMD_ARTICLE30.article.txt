# Both ultimate teams open as champs

### Brian Auld Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and women's
I Jltimate Frisbee teams started their
seasons on a high note, each return
ing from a Jan. 17-IS tournament in
Santa Barbara as champions.
The men ousted arch-rival UC-
Santa Barbara in a tight 15-13 final,
and the women cruised to victory in
the finals by defeating California 11-
5.
For the men, it was a huge win.
The Santa Barbara Black Tide
ended Stanford's season one year
ago by knocking off the then-top
ranked Cardinal in the finals of the
national tourney 21-14. Stanford
lost only two matches during all of
1997, both at the hands of the Black
Tide.
To win this match at Santa Bar
bara to start the season was a big
confidence booster. "I think this
tournament establishes us as the
best team in the country, at least in
the early going," said graduate stu
dent and co-captain Daniel Eisen
berg. "It was important to beat Santa
Barbara."
This year's Cardinal squad is dif
ferent from the 1997 team in a num
ber of ways. Last year's star player.
Jim Schoettler, is gone. Schoettler
last year received the Callahan
Award, recognition of the best play
er in the country.
Helping to fill the void Callahan
left are a number of solid rookies, in
cluding senior Matt Broaddus and

Mike Chevalier. Chevalier, a gradu
ate student who played division two
football, had a huge game in the
final, scoring six of Stanford's 15
points.
"I think he's only 5-foot-10. but
he can really jump," said Eisenberg.
"He was on fire so we just kept
throwing it up there for him, and he
would out-jump guys, awing the
crowd."
The road to the finals was tough
for the Cardinal. The team won five
games on Saturday and then eight
more on Sunday to take the title. In
addition to UC-Santa Barbara, UC-
San Diego posed a serious threat in a
match the Cardinal won 11-9.
"UC-San Diego is always a tough
teamm, and they'll be contenders"
for the national championship, said
Eisenberg. "We played pretty well
to beat them, even though it was
close."
The men do not have an official
coach, so most organizational and
strategy matters are left up to the
captains, Eisenberg and senior Alex
Young, who hope to steer Stanford
toward the national championship.
To do that, the Cardinal must im
prove on its offense as the season
progresses. Santa Barbara is expect
ed to get better, and the Card will
have to score more if it wants to stay
on top.
"We love to play defense, and we
have some great athletes. But our of
fense needs to get a little better,"
Eisenberg said.
Stanford hopes to develop a

steady and balanced attack. The
team wants to be able to move the
hall with short, consistent passes and
with long hucks. At Santa Barbara,
about half the team's scores resulted
from hucks, which is what the Cardi
nal wants.
The women cruised to the Santa
Barbara title with relative ease. Cal
came closest to stopping Stanford
in the finals, but even a strong Bear
squad could only manage five
scores against the stiff Cardinal de
fense.
"It was good to get off to such a
solid start," said senior Martita
Emde, who, along with senior Mag
gie Mathias and coterminal student
Ashley Simons, captains the
women's team. "We had just made
the cuts for the A-team, and we
played really well together. We
knew we should win the tourna
ment, but I'm not sure we expected
to beat everyone so handily."
The women are the defending na
tional champs, finishing the 1997
season with an unblemished 22-0
mark. They knocked off the Univer
sity of British Columbia in the na
tional finals.
But while this Stanford team is
once again the early favorite, it did
lose some key players from last sea
son's perfect squad, including Do
minique Fontenette, Abby Hoover
and Lena Ting. Replacing their con
tributions won't be easy.
Coach Jennifer Donnelly's team
returns 11 players from the 1997
squad and has added eight rookies.

including Delia Chiu, the only fresh
man to earn a spot on the A-team.
"One good thing about the tour
nament was that we could get a lot of
our rookies some real playing time,"
said Emde. "They got some good ex
perience ... but it was also just a lot
of fun to be down there in the beau
tiful weather."
Mary Hunt Martin — a junior
whose teammates say they refer to
her as "Mary Hot" only because of
her Ultimate talents — led the way
for the Cardinal throughout the
weekend.
"She stepped up and played real
ly well." Emde said. "She threw a lot
of scores and took control of the of
fense, running it very well."
Like the men, the women's team
came away from the weekend feel
ing good about itself but with the
knowledge that there is a lot of im
proving to be done.
"We didn't play up to our poten
tial," said Emde. "We need to get a
little sharper on our hucks and in
crease our consistency with short
passing."
In addition to the Santa Barbara
title, the women also scored some
other good news recently. A video
design company, 3DFX, has agreed
to sponsor the team, funding new
uniforms and equipment.
Up next for both the men and
women is the Stanford Invite, a
major tournament in early March
that will be held either at Stanford or
in Santa Cruz. The field will include
teams from all over the countrv.
