■ Saturday: No. 6 Stanford del". No,
13 Pacific, 11-15,15-9,15-11,15-13

In an almost three-hour match
in Stockton, the Cardinal (4-0. 3-0
MPSF) defeated the 13th-ranked
Pacific Tigers 11-15. 15-11,15-
13.
The match marked the return
of two key Cardinal players,
sophomore outside hitter Andy
Witt and senior middle blocker
Keenan Whitehurst. after ah

sences due to injury and illness,
respectively.
Pacific (4-2, 2-1) also hoped to
bring back its top outside hitter,
sophomore Vladimir Andric, after
a two-game absence due to injury,
but that was not to be. Andric was
replaced by freshman outside hit
ter Tim Gerlach, who led the Tigers
with 25 kills but had lb errors and
the worst hitting percentage on the
team. .164.
One key to Saturday's match
was the fact that Witt, the Cardi
nal's top hitter, played and Andric
did not. Witt was not playing at 1(H)
percent, but still made a major im
pact for Stanford.
After Witt and Whitehurst's
two-game absences, both made
good showings Saturday. Witt led
Stanford with 32 kills and White
hurst added 20 on the way to hitting
.621. Senior middle blocker Tad
Hoffman posted 21 kills and hit
.600.

"The middle, the quick attack,
was extremely effective for us,"
said Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves.
Freshman setter Josh Lukens
set 100 assists, a high total for a
four-game match.
The Cardinal was also strong de
fensively. Sophomore outside hit
ter Josh Palacios had 15 digs and
Witt added 14. Whitehurst blocked
the Tigers nine times, while Hoff
man had 7 blocks.
Saturday's match became a side
out battle. In the fourth game of the
match, the Cardinal fell behind
early, and about halfway through
that game, both teams began to
serve more aggressively.
"Our serves produced imperfect
passes that led to points," Nieves
said.
Even though strong serves
helped Stanford to wrap up the
match, it was overall not a good ser
vice nieht for the Cardinal. Stan

ford only had two service aces, both
by Lukens. but totaled 21 service
errors.
"We need to be willing to miss to
serve tough," Nieves said, "but we
weren't serving tough."
A rematch will be played in
Burnham Pavilion this Saturday, a
match that promises to be just as
exciting as the first meeting. Both
teams will review the match and
will be able to make immediate
preparations for the rematch.
Witt will sit out the Cardinal's
next match, a Thursday contest
against Trinity Western, as he rests
up for the rematch against Pacific
Saturday night.
If Andric is able to return, he
will make a tremendous impact on
the Tiger lineup. Andric adds a
strong offensive boost for the
Tigers.
"It was a good win for us,"
Nieves said, "because we start next
week first in our division."
