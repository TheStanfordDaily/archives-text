# Stern: Terrorist threat growing
## 
### Dan Arnold 
Countries face a growing threat
from terrorists who have access to
weapons of mass destruction, Jessi
ca Stern told a group of 15 people in
a noontime lecture yesterday.
Stern, a guest lecturer for the Po
litical Science Department, was di
rector of Russian, Ukrainian and
Eurasian Affairs for the National
Security Council and now consults
on terrorism.
In the past, people have thought
very little about the possibility that a
terrorist might use a chemical, bio
logical or radiological weapon.
"The traditional view is that ter
rorists would not use weapons of
mass destruction because it would
be irrational," Stern said. However,
she argued, if even a handful of ter
rorists were to attack with such
weapons, the results would be so

costly that the threat must be taken
seriously.
Stern described the terrorist or
ganizations that would attempt to
use those types of weapons and their
motivations. She said that only
groups who could combine capabili
ty, desire and organization could
successfully carry out an attack with
a weapon of mass destruction.
With most superpower nations
downsizing their militaries, some
unemployed nuclear and biological
scientists have turned to terrorist or
ganizations for work, giving terror
ists the necessary knowledge to
build weapons.
Stern also observed that the ex
pertise needed in the construction of
nuclear and chemical weapons is not
nearly as advanced as was previous
ly thought. Furthermore, she said,
"as few as three to four people might
be needed" to construct an atomic

bomb.
Organization is far more difficult
for groups who are Iwking to use
weapons of mass destruction be
cause it is difficult to keep the
weapons secret from government
watch dogs and infiltrators. Stern
noted. Also, individual group mem
bers get cold feet about actually
using a weapon that could kill hun
dreds or thousands of people and re
port their groups' intentions to gov
ernment authorities.
There are currently SO groups
being watched by the FBI on the sus
picion that the group may at some
point attempt to use a weapon of
mass destruction.
The organizations most likely to
use such weapons do "not have a
clear constituency." Stern said, of
fering the Irish Republican Army as
an example of a group that she
would not worry about because the
IRA has a clear following and sup
port base.
One category of terrorist groups
that would use weapons of mass de

struction are apocalypse groups at
tempting to instill mass chaos or
exact revenge, she said. Such groups
would not be concerned with hack
lash because their aim would be "to
kill lots of people and produce
chaos" instead of the popularization
of their group. Another threatening
group would be one looking for the
shock value inherent in a weapon of

mass destruction.
Stern said she is most concerned
about religious fanatics and the rise
of the extremist right wing move
ment.
1 n 1995, only one-fourth of recog
nized international terrorists were
religiously motivated, yet they were
responsible for 58 percent of the fa
talities from terrorist actions.
