The pressured atmosphere at
Stanford can lead to eating disor
ders and low self-esteem — a prob
lem the Body Image. Food and
Self-Esteem support group hopes
to combat with Body Image
Awareness week.
Yesterday marked the begin
ning of the event, which consists of
activities ranging from discussion
groups to yoga.
"We are 111 a very pressured en
vironment. and that's why our
group is so important," said junior

Amy Wertheimer. Co-president of
the support group. "Because
where there is pressure, there are
also people cracking under the
pressure."
The week kicked off with a
meeting of the support group at
Ihe Bridge last night. The meet
ings. which led to the creation of
the group several years ago. pro
vide an open forum to allow people
to discuss how they feel
"It's about people being there
and understanding that there are
other people in the same kinds of
situations." Wertheimer said.
I'odav will feature an open di-

cussion at noon in the Women's
( enter, focusing mainly on hum
people perceive themselves and
others at Stanford.
Tonight, the group will offer a
yoga workshop designed to ex
plore mental health and stability
through the body. This program
was first introduced last year:
tonight's seminar will begin at 7
p.m. in the Women's Center.
The main discussion relating to
eating disorders will be held to
morrow at 7 p.m. at Chi Theta Chi.
This will involve prepared presen
tations from different group mem
bers — ranging from informational
talks to personal experiences on
topics from eating disorders to bad
eating and dieting habits and the
obsession with physical perfection.
On Thursday, the group will be
presenting a self-esteem discussion
at y p.m. in the Branner library.
This will be an informal talk that
will address how self-esteem af
fects ideas of body image and gen
eral well-being.

"We really want to stress the
idea of self-esteem being important
just lor the way we live and our
body image." said senior Karen
Felzer, co-president of the group.
The final event of the week will
be a hike into the Foothills on Sat
urday morning.
The hike is designed to he an ex
tension of the self-esteem theme of
the week and will provide partici
pants with an opportunity to expe
rience true natural beauty,
Wertheimer said.
"Stanford is not just the Quad
and the classes," she said. "I think
people sometimes tend to forget

about that." The hiking group will
leave from Tresidder Express at 11
a.m.
Body Image Awareness Week is
part of the support group's devel
oping outreach program, which
also includes dorm panels.
The events were originally de
signed to coincide with National
Eating Disorder Week. This year,
though, the focus of the campus
programming is more varied, so
events are being held two weeks
earlier than the national program
ming.
