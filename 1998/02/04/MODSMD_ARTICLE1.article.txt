# El Ni√±o storm leaves campus reeling
## Classes canceled, buildings damaged 
### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
Caught in the eye of an El
Nino storm, the Stanford cam
pus was thrown into an uproar
yesterday, with damage to sev
eral University buildings and
the cancellation of classes.

University Registrar Roger Printup said cancel
lations were due to "flooding and damage." Class
es resume today.
More than five inches of rain fell Monday night,
creating a river flowing on the downward slope
from the Braun Music Center to the Meyer and
Green library area. Buildings that sustained flood
damage include Cubberley Auditorium. Green Li
brary. Jonsson Library of Government Docu
ments. Braun and the basements of Wilbur and
Stern Halls.
The storm drains around Green Library could
not handle the sudden, large amount of uater,
which created a back flow that flooded the library's
basement, according to Larry Gibbs. director of
Environmental Health and Safety.
Other damage around campus included a fallen
tree on Junipero Serra Boulevard between Cam
pus Drive West and Page Mill Road. A car hit the
tree sometime Monday night, but no one was hurt,
and the road was onlv closed until late vesterdav


morning, said Stanford Police Sgt.
Hilary Karp. In addition, a 250-
vear-old oak tree was toppled
near Webb Ranch.
A large eucalyptus tree branch
also fell on two cars in the Mudd
Chemistry Building parking lot,
crushing their windshields and
driver's side doors. The Grant
Building in the Medical School
also incurred some water damage.
Other buildings, such as Lane His
tory Corner, have wet floors and
could possibly need new carpet.
San Francisquito Creek, which
runs along the western edge of
Stanford's property out to the
Bay. was also running much high
er than normal. Much of the bank
and the walking trails that run
along the creek were washed
away, and the maintenance ad
ministrator at the Oak Creek
Apartments put up yellow caution
tape to prevent pedestrians from
entering the slippery area.
Classes canceled
Some students did attend their
first classes because neither they
nor their professors had heard of
the cancellation, which circulated
through e-mail shortly after 4 a.m.
Classes that had midterms sched
uled for today were also canceled,
including all chemistry midterms
and the Computer Science 109
midterm.
Classes were canceled in part

because roads were closed and
off-campus students and faculty
were unable to commute to cam
pus.
Some graduate schools did re
main open and continued to hold
classes, including the Law School,
Medical School and the Graduate
School of Business. All adminis
trative and department offices re
mained open throughout the day.
as well as the food services in
Tresidder Union. A foot of water
filled Sunken Diamond, almost
covering the pitching mound. By
mid-afternoon, when the baseball
team began practice, most of the
water had been pumped out.
Transportation
Flooding occurred elsewhere
around Stanford as well. Parking
lots in Stanford Shopping Center
filled with water as a result of
backed-up storm drains, but the
water did not prevent access to the
center, and stores remained open
for business.
The University Avenue under
pass into downtown Palo Alto was
closed off. as well as some other
streets in the area. At least one car
was submerged under the water in
the underpass.
Despite delays early this morn
ing. the Marguerite shuttle oper
ated on time for most of yester
day. said Parking and Transporta
tion manager Leslie Quintero.
