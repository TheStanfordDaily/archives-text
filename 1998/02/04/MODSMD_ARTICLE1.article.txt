Caught in the eye of an El
Nino storm, the Stanford cam
pus was thrown into an uproar
yesterday, with damage to sev
eral University buildings and
the cancellation of classes.

University Registrar Roger Printup said cancel
lations were due to "flooding and damage." Class
es resume today.
More than five inches of rain fell Monday night,
creating a river flowing on the downward slope
from the Braun Music Center to the Meyer and
Green library area. Buildings that sustained flood
damage include Cubberley Auditorium. Green Li
brary. Jonsson Library of Government Docu
ments. Braun and the basements of Wilbur and
Stern Halls.
The storm drains around Green Library could
not handle the sudden, large amount of uater,
which created a back flow that flooded the library's
basement, according to Larry Gibbs. director of
Environmental Health and Safety.
Other damage around campus included a fallen
tree on Junipero Serra Boulevard between Cam
pus Drive West and Page Mill Road. A car hit the
tree sometime Monday night, but no one was hurt,
and the road was onlv closed until late vesterdav
