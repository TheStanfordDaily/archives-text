## El Nino drenches California 
### 
I lie big HI Nino storm every
one had been tearing for months
clobbered California with driving
rain and hurricane-force wind
yesterday, threatening beach
homes with 18-foot waves, caus
ing freeway pileups and sending
thousands fleeing to high ground.
Thousands of people were
without power after wind up to
80 mph uprooted trees and sent
patio furniture sailing like mis
siles. A falling tree killed one
person in Northern California.
"We've received over the last
24 hours nothing less than a
bomb." said James Bailey, assis
tant chief of California's flood
center.
()n the other side of the coun
try. a storm drenched the South
east after plowing across Florida
with tornadoes. At least two
ships were driven aground during
the night off Florida, several peo
ple had to be rescued at sea, and
one person was killed. About
200.0(H) people were left without
power yesterday in Florida.

I leavy snow warning warnings
were issued for West Virginia,
and coastal flood watches
extended as far north as Chesa
peake Bay.
The West Coast storm
stretched the length of Califor
nia. with flash flood warnings
posted for most coastal counties.
Thirty- to 40-foot waves
crashed ashore at Pacifica south
of San Francisco.
"I've never seen anything like
this here — not this rough in this
area." said Joe Sciascia. "I've
been in typhoons in World War
11. and this is similar."
Eighteen-foot breakers 111
Southern California wrecked
piers and eroded the sand barri
ers that protect beachfront
homes. Santa Barbara County
got some of the heaviest rain,
with more than 13 inches since
Sunday.
Bailey said it was one of the
biggest storms on record for Cali
fornia but nowhere near as seri
ous as the flooding in January

1997 that caused billions of dollars
in damage.
"There's more coming in. hut
it's no time for panic," Bailey
said.
In Northern California, the
Pajaro River spilled over its
banks, threatening to breach lev
ees. and the S.(MK) people of the
town of Pajaro were ordered to
evacuate. In Willows, with some
6.000 residents, more than 100
homes were flooded, and raw
sewage backed up from overload
ed sewers.
The Russian River north of
San Francisco was expected to
reach about 9 feet above flood
level, threatening the community
of (iuerneville, which got as much
us 5 inches of rain overnight.
People jammed the
(.iuerneville Safeway to grab sup
plies in anticipation of the worst.
"We're swamped." clerk
Philip Weinstein said. "People
are buying everything: water, bat
teries. cereal, fire wood, dog food
and ice."

Maggie Edmunds loads her truck with belongings as she prepares to evacuate the Hilton Mobile
Home Park yesterday to avoid the rising flood waters of the Russian River. A fierce winter storm
that hit California has caused flooding, mud slides, traffic tie-ups and at least four deaths.
