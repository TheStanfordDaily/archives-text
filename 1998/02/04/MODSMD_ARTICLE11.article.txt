# Investigation continues
## Stephanopoulos denies knowledge of affair 
### 
WASH INCHON (AP) — Monica Lewin
sky left town yesterday for a California
respite as her lawyers waited for prosecutors
to make the next move to secure her cooper
ation. The investigation into an alleged pres
idential affair and coverup pressed deeper
into the White House inner circle.
Prosecutors questioned one of President
Clinton's former senior advisers and confi
dants, George Stephanopoulos. before a
grand jury and subpoenaed one of the presi
dent's current top deputies. John Podesta, to
testify later this week.
"I have no firsthand knowledge at all
about the nature of the relationship, if any.
between the president and Monica Lewin
sky." Stephanopoulos said after more than
three hours before the grand jury. 1 le said he
had met Lewinsky a few times.
The summons to Podesta, the White
House deputy chief of staff, along with
anothei subpoena to Clinton's most trusted
adviser. Bruce Lindsey, prompted White
House lawyers to hold preliminary discus
sions about whether to invoke executive priv
ilege to bar certain testimony.
Presidential lawyers debated whether to
instruct key witnesses, such as Podesta and
Lindsey. not to testify regarding their conver
sations with the president or presidential
lawyers about Lewinsky, officials confirmed.
I lie officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, stressed the discussions were pre
liminary and some of Clinton's political
advisers vorried the strategy might create a
public appearance »>l stonewalling.
I hc principle of executive privilege,
asserted unsuccessfully during the Watergate
battle lor President Nixon's tape recordings,
gives the president the right to keep secret
internal deliberations that could affect
national security or foreign policy.
It was unclear how Clinton's lawyers
might apply that to the Lewinsky matter.
Meanwhile, Lewinsky took a first-class
flight back to I os Angeles to spend time with
her father, departing the nation's capital for
the first time since the controversy arose inno
weeks aco.

"We're not planning any sort of extended
stay." her lawyer. William (iinsburg. said in
an interview with The Associated Press. "We
will he working with Monica to calm her
down, advise her on her legal strategy and let
her see her dad."
(iinsburg said his talks with prosecutors
about whether his client should receive
immunity from prosecution in exchange for
her testimony remained "cordial" and that
"generally speaking, we are where we want
to be." He said Lewinsky's offer to testify
had not changed over the last two weeks.
"Quite honestly, it is up to him to be in
contact with us." (iinsburg said of Whitewa
ter prosecutor Kenneth Starr, who is heading
the investigation.
(iinsburg said he did not have access to
records that would confirm the exact number
of visits Lewinsky. 24. made to the White
I louse after she left her job there in l l )%. Hut
he said a report in The New York Times of
37 visits was not surprising.
"It doesn't seem high to me," (iinsburg
said. "I'm not denying she'd be making visits
like that."
Lewinsky, a former intern and then paid
White House employee, swore in an affidavit
last month in the Paula Jones sexual harass
ment case that she did not have an affair with
Clinton.
Prosecutors are in possession of secretly
taped < onversations in which Lewinsky told a
friend that she had sexual relations with the
president and that he and presidential friend
Vernon Jordan asked her to lie about it
under oath. Clinton and Jordan deny the
charges.
Lewinsky already has been told that she is
a target likely to be indicted. Her trip to Cal
ifornia signaled a new. lower-profile strategy
by her defense team after a two week nation
al media blitz on her behalf
Lot his part, Starr promised to move his
investigation forward as swiftly as possible.
"We're trying to gather evidence .is quickly .is
we can. and that's important to clear people or
to make an assessment of whether there are
issues that have to be faced." he said.
