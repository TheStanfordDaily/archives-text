111 N I'SVILLE, Texas (AP) Karla Faye Tucker
calm, composed and contrite went to her death
yesterday wishing that her victims' families would find
some comfort in her execution. "I hope (iod will give
you peace with this." she said in her last words.
I ucker, 3K. whose born-again Christianity sparked
a worldwide debate over redemption and retribution
on death row. was declared dead by injection at 6:45
p.m. She became the first woman executed in Texas
since the ( ivil War, and the first nationwide since
IW4.
In her linal words. I ucker expressed love for her
family and husband and apologized to the families ol
the two people she hacked to death with a pickax in
1 iouston in 1983.
"I am going to be face to face with Jesus now. I love
all of you very much." she said. "I will see you all
when you get there. I will wait for you."
Richard Thornton, husband of victim Deborah
I hornton, witnessed the execution and wasn't swayed
by l ucker's apology or expression of remorse.
"My religion says to forgive, turn a cheek. I'm not

a perfect man. I cannot do it." Thornton said. "I've
heard her words. I don't think they are heartfelt. I
don't believe her conversion. I don't believe her
('hristlanity."
Other witnesses held hands and cried. "I love you.
Karla." said Kari Weeks. Tucker's sister.
Outside, hundreds of people and hordes of news
reporters waited for word about the execution. When
prison officials and witnesses emerged, many cheered.
I he execution came less than an hour after the U.S.
Supreme Court rejected an llth-hour appeal and
Ciov. George W. Hush refused to grant a 30-day
reprieve, saying her case had been thoroughly
reviewed by appellate courts.
' I have concluded judgment about the heart and
soul of an individual on death row are best left to a
higher authority." Hush said. "May God bless Karla
1 aye I ucker and God bless her victims and their fam
ilies."
Earlier yesterday, the Supreme Court had rejected
another appeal in which Tucker had argued that the
clemency process in Texas is unconstitutional.
