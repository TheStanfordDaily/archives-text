# Scientists find earliest AIDS case

CHICAGO (AP) — Scientists
have pinpointed what is believed to
be the earliest known case of AIDS
an African man who died in 1959
and say the discovery suggests the
virus lirst infected people in the
1940s or early *>os.
Where AIDS came from is still a
mystery, although experts assume an
ancestor of the virus crossed from
monkeys or other primates into peo
ple at some point. However, whether
this occurred in recent decades or
centuries ago is a matter of debate.
Now. researchers say they have
conducted genetic analysis of an
HIV sample that appears to date
from early in the epidemic. They
believe it is an ancestor of the viruses
that have infected more than 40 mil
lion people worldwide, most of them
since the early 19Ktk.
Dr. Toufu Zhu of the University
of Washington in Seattle presented
the findings yesterday at the Fifth
Conference on Retroviruses and
Opportunistic Infections. They will
also be published this week in the
journal Nature.

" I his is to date the oldest known
HIV case." said Dr. David Ho. head
of the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center at Rockefeller
University and a co-author of the
study.
I he scientists looked for signs of
HIV in 1.213 bl(x>d samples that
were gathered in Africa between
1954 and 19K2. They found clear
signs of the virus in one taken from a
Bantu man who lived in
Leopoldville. Belgian Congo — what
is now Kinshasa. Republic of ( ongo
— in 1959.
The virus in the sample had
degraded, but the scientists were able
to isolate four small fragments of two
viral genes. One gene holds instruc
tions for assembling the outer coat of
the virus, whik :In wher is code for
one of the protein* the virus needs to
reproduce.
HIV mutates quickly. About 1
percent of its genetic material
changes each year. So the scientists
compared the genes from the 39-
year-old sample of HIV with those
carried bv current versions of HIV.

"We realized that if we had an old
sequence" of HIV genes, "it would
serve as a yardstick to measure the
evolution of the current HIV." Ho
said.
HIV has mutated over the years
to form 10 distinct subtypes, lettered
A through J. One of these, subtvpe
B. is the dominant strain in the Unit
ed States and Europe, while subtvpe
D is most common in Africa.
The family tree of HIV looks like
a bush with the various subtypes
forming the limbs Ho said the 1959
HIV is near the trunk, around the
point where subtypes Band D
branch off.
"This is no doubt an ancestor to B
and D." he said.
Zhu said this suggests that all the
HIV subtypes evolved from one
introduction of HIV into people,
rather than from many crossovers
from animals to humans, as some
have speculated. And given the
steady rate at which HIV mutates, it
also means that the virus probablv
first got into people sometime in the
1940s or earlv '50s
