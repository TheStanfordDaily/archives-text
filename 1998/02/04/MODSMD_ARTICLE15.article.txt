Rescuers work around the wreckage of a cable car after a U.S. military airplane hit its line above the northeastern
Italian ski resort town of Cavalese yesterday. Twenty people were killed and a second cabin was left dangling from
the cable car line. The plane, which is part of the NATO-led stabilization force working in Bosnia, had to make an
emergency landing at the U.S. military air base in Aviano.
