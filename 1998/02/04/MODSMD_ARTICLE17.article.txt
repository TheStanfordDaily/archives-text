Successful tuition control
bill requires the ASSLTs
long-term commitment

EVEN THE MOST exciting
plans merit careful considera
tion before they can be brought
to fruition.
ASSU Senate Deputy Chair Matt
Spence embarked on such a potential
ly important venture last Tuesday
when he introduced a bill to create an
Alliance to Control Tuition. Control
ling tuition? Sounds like a splendid
idea — assuming it can happen.
Considering the ASSU's spotty
track record on following through with
grand promises, this is a large assump
tion indeed.
In order to maintain credibility, the
ASSU's tuition contro alliance should
focus on making informed and feasible
proposals, on ensuring long-term conti
nuity of its work and on educating the
student body about how tuition is set
and spent.
ITie University's financing structure
is hardly a simple matter. If the alliance
expects to be taken seriously — and it
ultimately plans to bring its proposals
to the Board of Trustees — its work
must reflect awareness of Stanford's
budgetary realities.
Much to Spence's credit, this consid
eration is not lost on him. Meetings
with the University's budget officers
are already in the works. 'Hie alliance is
also expected to cooperate with the
student representative on the Board's
Committee on Academic Policy, Plan

ning and Management.
In short, the alliance has a lot of
work ahead of it — work that will take
some time. Since the bill creating this
group has yet to clear the senate, it is
highly unlikely that a concrete propos
al will be ready when the Board meets
later this month to set next year's
tuition.
Targeting the alliance's efforts for
February of 1999 sounds more realistic.
However, the choice to focus on the
tuition issue is rather surprising, due to
the fact that tuition hikes were set at a
tame 4 percent in 1996 and 1997.
Moreover, a long-term reform effort
introduces the issue of whether the
ASSU can sustain its crusade against
tuition. Unless the senate provides
some concrete measures for the
alliance's continuity — such as staffing
it predominantly with students from
outside the ASSU — its efforts are
probably wasted.
That would be a shame. The alliance
is promising, particularly because it
could focus attention on an important
issue that few students know much
about.
If the ASSU succeeds in educating
peers about the factors determining
the price of tuition and how it is spent,
it will make a notable contribution to
student advocacy.
As far as actually containing the
growth of tuition ... well, we'll believe
it when we see it. Or, better yet. when
we don't have to pay it.
Meanwhile, the Senate must con
centrate on creating an alliance that
will be taken seriously. Emphasis on
feasibility, continuity and education
would be a good start.
