## Creating a true dialogue on race 
### 
RACE matters
Racism has been
ingrained in the
foundation, structure and
history of our nation, and
we must continue to con
front it because it will be a
part of our future.

As an RA. I am disappointed with the
multicultural education we received during
training and the nature of multicultural edu
cation in the dorms. We have taken on this
happy and cheesy version of race education,

Just because we talk about the impor
tance of all people, showcase "foods and
dances of the world" and act like we all get
along, it doesn't mean that we get along in
practice. 1 feel that we are avoiding large,
pertinent issues that must be dealt with in
order to create a community that communi
cates with and cares about others.
Not to he mistaken, this is hard work.
Racism is no small nemesis and should not
be treated as such. It is not easy to overcome
a 4(X)-vear history of racism. We cannot over
come it by singing "All the Colors of the
Rainbow," nor by participating in "Crossing
the I .ine." And 30 years of affirmative action
are not going to do it either. A certain system
of hate, privilege and disadvantage struc
tured by race exists in our society. We must
acknowledge its presence in order to over
come it.
1 often hear statements such as "Multicul
turalism at Stanford is overemphasized and
too politically correct." Well, I partially

agree. There is not too much emphasis, but
the emphasis is too politically correct. We
need to get down, dirty and honest with each
other if we want to make progress.
Another common statement claims, "We
keep perpetuating the idea of race. Racism
cannot end unless we stop thinking and talk
ing in those terms." This attitude seems to
be: "Hush!! Lest we waken the monster of
racism." If you don't talk about it.it won't
exist. This is very dangerous. Even if the
monster is asleep, it is still there, alive and
breathing.
Ancflfinally there is the conimenT
doesn't,,really matter anymore. We've pro
gressed." Well, even if we have progressed,
we still have a long way to go.
Perhaps taking on the aforementioned
attitudes leads to an easier mode of living.
Unfortunately though, people are dying
from racism.
In fact, we are all dying from lack of job
and educational opportunities and from
physical and mental violence. We are dying
in the prisons, in poverty, in the streets and in
the schools. We may not all feel this slow
death, and it is not physical for all of us. but
we are all dying.
We live in a racist and hateful society. We
nurture, support and build our lives within
the structures of this society. Even those who
are socially minded and active are equal par
ticipants in upholding these structures.
It is impossible not to be. We would have
to stop eating, buying clothes, computers and
other services that exist through an unequal,
capital-oriented market economy. We are all
racists in that sense. So, change must come

from ourselves, or we cannot change any
thing.
This change must go beyond having a
black friend and a gay teacher. When are you
ready to give up the society that you may be
benefiting from? When are you ready for the
life work of creating and building this new
community?
On the other extreme, the "take down
The Man and destroy the system" attitude is
destructive too. We must combat destruction
with creativity and building. F or if we fail to
do so, what will be kit once the system is
" m WOV""" r
torn down?
This creativity must come through many
different visions and directions. The strate
gies must be as complex as our society is. We
don't all have to become poor or martyrs to
change the world. We must, however, main
tain a certain consciousness in whatever life
path we choose and desire to continue to
learn about, understand and care about oth
ers.
As an upstanding and leading academic
institution, Stanford must make a commit
ment to creating and building a true commu
nity. T his means re-evaluating Stanford's val
ues and reward system: values expressed in
teaching and research.
I do not believe that Stanford and Stan
ford students have truly committed them
selves it) change. And 1 am left wondering,
what will happen if we don't?
