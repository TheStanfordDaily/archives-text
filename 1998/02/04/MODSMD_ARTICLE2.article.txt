# Libraries face ruined books, daunting clean-up process
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Senior staff writer 
The battle to save thousands of
books, recordings and other library
materials began late Monday night,
as muddy rainwater seeped into
University libraries and buildings.
Within a few hours, materials on
the basement floors of Green Li
brary, Jonsson Library of Govern
ment Documents, Cubberlev Audi
torium and Braun Music Center
were submerged in up to two feet of
water. The flooding damaged or de
stroyed 12(),(X)0 books at Green and
1 ().()()() recordings at the Braun
Arehive of Recorded Sound.
The damage to Cubberley and
Jonsson could be even worse. Cub
berley may be closed for days due to
electrical hazards related to the
flooding. Estimates of the number
of documents affected at Jonsson
were not available yesterday.
The damage to buildings and ma
terials is the most significant the
University has seen since the IW)
Loma Prieta Earthquake. Although
there have not been any formal
damage estimates yet. projections
indicate that costs will far surpass
the University's SI million flood in
surance coverage.

Rising water
University Librarian Mike
Keller became aware of the flooding
after Richard Koprowski. assistant
archivist at Braun, called to tell
Keller that water was rising up from
the floor of the library.
"By midnight, we knew we were
in trouble." Keller said.
The frantic calls to University
staff and administrators began soon
afterward. As library officials on the
emergency contact list arrived on
the scene, the evacuation of materi
als began in earnest.
Hundreds of volunteer students
who showed up at the libraries to
help proved crucial in the effort.
Dean of Students Marc Wais re
ceived a call from the Provost's Of
fice at 3 a.m. asking him to gather
"as many students as possible" for a
campaign to save the materials.
Wais began by recruiting stu
dents in Junipero, where he is a res
ident fellow. Then he called other
RFs as well as student leaders.
