# Libraries face ruined books, daunting clean-up process
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Senior staff writer 
The battle to save thousands of
books, recordings and other library
materials began late Monday night,
as muddy rainwater seeped into
University libraries and buildings.
Within a few hours, materials on
the basement floors of Green Li
brary, Jonsson Library of Govern
ment Documents, Cubberlev Audi
torium and Braun Music Center
were submerged in up to two feet of
water. The flooding damaged or de
stroyed 12(),(X)0 books at Green and
1 ().()()() recordings at the Braun
Arehive of Recorded Sound.
The damage to Cubberley and
Jonsson could be even worse. Cub
berley may be closed for days due to
electrical hazards related to the
flooding. Estimates of the number
of documents affected at Jonsson
were not available yesterday.
The damage to buildings and ma
terials is the most significant the
University has seen since the IW)
Loma Prieta Earthquake. Although
there have not been any formal
damage estimates yet. projections
indicate that costs will far surpass
the University's SI million flood in
surance coverage.

Rising water
University Librarian Mike
Keller became aware of the flooding
after Richard Koprowski. assistant
archivist at Braun, called to tell
Keller that water was rising up from
the floor of the library.
"By midnight, we knew we were
in trouble." Keller said.
The frantic calls to University
staff and administrators began soon
afterward. As library officials on the
emergency contact list arrived on
the scene, the evacuation of materi
als began in earnest.
Hundreds of volunteer students
who showed up at the libraries to
help proved crucial in the effort.
Dean of Students Marc Wais re
ceived a call from the Provost's Of
fice at 3 a.m. asking him to gather
"as many students as possible" for a
campaign to save the materials.
Wais began by recruiting stu
dents in Junipero, where he is a res
ident fellow. Then he called other
RFs as well as student leaders.

early morning phone calls to frater
nity presidents, estimated that over

nity volunteered to help.
"They were tough to get out of
bed but very willing to help," Ro
drigues said.
"It was very gratifying to see —
the University was in a time of need
... and students rallied to help,"
Wais said.
"It was hard work, a lot of bend
ing down and picking up big. heavy,
wet books," he added. "People were
exhausting themselves."
In the early hours of the morning,
volunteers worked with flashlights
in water up to their calves. Wais esti
mated that 150 students were at
Green at 3:30 a.m. forming lines to
pass books upstairs. By 11:30 am. a
total of 3.(KM) boxes of materials had
been moved to higher ground.
Freshman Brian Williams helped
move wet materials upstairs with
two other students in Braun from
2:45 a.m. until 5 a.m.
"1 was not really thinking at the
time, just trying to get it done,"
Williams said.
A different kind of recovery ef
fort took place outside of Braun later
yesterday afternoon. After library
officials were forced to discard thou
sands of water damaged records in

dumpsters outside, students scav
enged stacks of Li's. According to
Barbara Sawka, director of the
Braun Music Library and Archive of
Recorded Sound, the discarded
records were not rare or unique, but
commercial albums, many of which
the library has duplicates of.
The clean-up
Restoration Management Com
pany, a Fremont-based firm, is
working to clean up the damage. In
Green, where carpets are soaked,
desks ruined and a temporary re
taining wall in the basement has
crumbled, supervisor Jon Takata es
timated that the clean-up costs
would be between $5(),(M)() and
$75,(XX).
"It's a major job," Takata said.
"The loss is pretty large."
The thousands of books dam
aged will probably be saved by un
dergoing a freeze-drying process
which minimizes water damage.
Four truckloads of books were
taken to Union Cold Storage in
I Jnion City yesterday to be frozen.
According to University library
specialist Jane Vaden, time is of the
essence in book recovery. Within 24
to 48 hours, mold begins to grow on
wet hooks, and they are ruined.
Areas reached by the flood water
will have to be sanitized and disin

fected. Clean-up volunteers were
advised to shower immediately in
case of water contamination. Ru
mors about raw sewage being in the
water proved false.
The damage to personal posses
sions in library carrels and offices in
Cubberley has not yet been deter
mined. As well as computers and
documents, many researchers may
lose their data. Assoc. Education
Prof. Brigid Barron, who recently
moved her office to the basement of
Cubberley. was not able to enter the
building to see the damage.
Braun, Jonsson and Green per
sonnel alternated shifts with each
other last night so that staff was pre
sent at all times.
Sandbags have been prepared in
case there is another Hooding risk.
However, Keller estimates that
water levels would need to be four
to five times what they were Mon
day night for more damage to occur.
For now. library personnel are
focusing on recovery from the flood.
If power can be restored, (ireen will
be open today. However, the boxes
of books stacked throughout the
first floor and ruined ground floor
make recovery seem daunting.
Robert Mantovani, who works at
the (ireen privileges office, said. "It
seems to be under control now. but
we're in for the long haul."
