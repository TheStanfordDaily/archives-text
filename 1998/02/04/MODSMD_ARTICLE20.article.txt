Lectures don't indicate
belief in the humanities
In late 17th-century France, a hand of
scientifically-inclined putschists, headed by
Perrault tried to put down the ancient clas
sics. The finest writers of the period
Racine. La Fontaine. La Bruyere, Boileau
— would have none of this ...
The ensuing clash was dubbed "The
Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns."
But the defenders of the "Ancients" were
actually far more modern than the partisans
of the "Moderns" as well as solidly
anchored in their traditions. They were
great and of permanent importance where
as their opponents were relative medio
crities.
Flere is the key point: science looks only
forward, art looks back and really all
around (just as "metaphoricity" does: it
reaches paradoxically up and down and is
holistic). Artistic "progress" is a very shaky
idea, influenced by the rise of specializing
science along with the dynamism of Protes
tantism.
Professor Gumbrecht (Jan. 20) says that
in launching the new presidential lecture
series, he and University President Gerhard
Casper want to "establish the foundations
of the humanities more soundly. Most of
the humanities have their roots in the early

l l )th century ... They were founded under
some specific conditions, and their legitima
tions are not convincing anymore ..."
That's what the Protestant fanatics more
or less said as they knocked the heads off of
statues of the Virgin Mary. Why should
anyone truly anchored in.and pious to. the
3,(XX)-year-old tradition of Western Judeo-
Christian and Greco-Roman culture give a
tinker's damn about the specific formula
tions of it in the early l L )th century?
No humanist I know of felt substantially
hampered by such merely formal arrange
ments. Those marginal academic maneu
vers come and go. I he "specific conditions"
we ought to worry about are Gumbrecht s
and Casper's all-too-familiar (since the '60s)
power play. Meanwhile, high art, as Cynthia
Ozick observed, is "dead" on campuses,
and the humanities arc reduced to a frazzle,
under precisely the sort ol cultural revolu
tionary impact that Casper and Gumbrecht
still stand for.
Will someone please tell me this: in what
way will that scattering of ephemeral visi
tors. usually safely left-wing (in line with the
new-Marxist ideology which our dominant
pair probably doesn't really believe in but
are willing to go along with for power's
sake) improve humanistic study here over
the long run?
What radical twist of thought will pro
duce a better book on Lzra Pound than
Hugh Kcnner's; better than Richard Ell

man's "Joyce;" Leon Edel's "Henry
James": our own lan Watts' "Conrad:' Joe
Frank's "Dostoevskv?"

Being a techie or fuzzie
isn't mutually exclusive
There are two implications of Aly Rem
tulla's column with which I cannot help but
agree. 'Hie first is that any cluster of aca
demic disciplines at a given time and a given
place — e.g.. humanities and arts at Stan
ford — should strive for improvement. It is
also true that, in a very impressive tradition,
Stanford's intellectual and institutional
identity has been defined more by the sci
ences. engineering, economics and law than
by the humanities and arts.
This said, I find that Aly Remtulla
indulges in a discourse of self-pity that I find
typical of the very worst in the Stanford tra
dition of the humanities and arts.
It is of course always appropriate and
laudable to be critical, but if a student reacts
to the announcement of three (and more)
new endowed chairs for the humanities by
questioning whether "benefits will trickle
down to undergraduates." I cannot help dis
covering a certain injustice in those words.
I'his is even more true for Remtulla's

remark on the forthcoming "Presidential
Lectures and Symposia": he fears that they
will he mainly attended by faculty and grad
uate students. Rather than expressing such
concerns, he should be encouraging under
graduates to attend these lectures.
What 1 really resent, however, is Rem
tulla's implication that "computer scientists,
engineers and physicians" whom he defines
as "pre-money" are the opposite of "true
scholars" and.in general, incapable of
becoming interested in any cultural activi
ties or values.
This exactly is the assumption where the
traditional — and traditionally problematic
discourse regarding the Stanford human
ities and arts becomes highly problematic.
Why see scientists, engineers and physicians
as potential — or even real — enemies?
Why complain about a great Stanford tradi
tion rather than welcoming it as an intellec
tual challenge?
Having taught at Stanford for almost
nine years as a professor in comparative lit
erature in French and Italian, I can certain
ly not confirm that humanities majors and
humanities graduate students are always
the greatest luminaries in my classes. I
indeed enjoy teaching students who come
from other disciplines because the differ
ence between their ways of thinking and my
own becomes a new experience, of mutual
challenge and. ultimately, of joined intellec
tual improvement.

So rather than assume that positive
changes only occur against a background of
repression and dominance ~ci the human
ities. why don't we just look forward to what
the future will bring without presupposing
that the humanities and arts are the victims?
