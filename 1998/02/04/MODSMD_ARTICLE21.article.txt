# The
						fourth dimension
## Twinkies, cows and keeping life in perspective 
### 
Kerry Rodgers

A I 1 A.M. our foamcore cow was
successfully shitting Twinkies, but
the (iatorade peeing mechanism
was failing to trigger reliably.
By 2 a.m. it all began to seem impossi
ble. My brain power was rapidly diminish
ing and my body was overwhelmed with
exhaustion.
My mind became obsessed with a single
thought: ME 101 sucks. Then another:
Stanford sucks. Lastly: This whole thing
called life sucks.
It's amazing how easily one's sanity can
disintegrate, and all the world becomes
one big ball of negativity spiraling towards
oblivion.
"School sucks" is a sentiment I fre
quently hear, especially around midterm
time, or during finals, or any time of the
year in the dark basement of the studio art
building where marginalized artists express
anger at the institution.
Of course our elders are constantly
reminding us how incredibly lucky we are
to be here and how we should cherish our
college years — but amid the stress, the

pressure and the desire to achieve, it seems
impossible to appreciate it fully.
Why do intelligent, capable, young peo
ple ditch resilience for depression?
What throws me out of balance is that
during each part of my day — classes,
meetings, activities — there is this subtle,
lurking message that responsibility X is the
Most Important Thing. The clincher is
when I believe it.
When I take a step back and meditate
on life, I always remember that the knowl
edge gained in classes and activities is valu
able and empowering, but it is not The
Most Important Thing.
I made a new friend the other day. As we
were sharing our life stories over lunch, I
noticed that the things we spoke about were
our childhoods, our loves and heartbreaks,
our health and our respective passions for
psychology and art. However, for two peo
ple who have spent the majority of their
lives in academic pursuits, anything resem
bling academic discourse was conspicuously
absent from the conversation.
So the following day when a section

leader posed an obscure question to an
impassive class, I felt like yelling, "Why
don't we talk about something Impor
tant?!"
Certainly, Important Things are diffi
cult to integrate into formal scholastic dis
cussions. It's as if the closer we get to talk
ing about them, the more absurd and
ridiculous it all begins to sound.
What exactly are the Important Things?
I think it is the Something that all the
world's religions are getting at. Though I
don't subscribe to any of them, I subscribe
to the idea that there is spiritual purpose
for growth. I subscribe to the notion that
there is beauty in believing that there is
meaning in life.
I think we seize this meaning by feeling
things deeply, by pursuing our passions, by
talking about Important Things.
But it is so easy to forget, to be distract
ed, to get too busy for anything Important.
I have a friend whose father spent his
life postponing Important Things. He put it
aside during college and law school and
again when he settled into a busy legal

career and full family life. He bargained
that when he turned 50 he would retire and
finally have the time for himself that he
had always dreamed of.
Me turned 50 this year. His momentous
birthday was marked by a peculiar cough.
This fit, just-about-to-embark-on-his-real
life man was told by his doctor a week later
that he had esophageal cancer which had
already metastasized to his major organs.
He has about a 5 percent chance of living
through the spring.
This story reminds me that the possibil
ity of death makes it imperative for us to
set priorities. Don't wait for tomorrow to
live life.
The idea of carpe diem is reminiscent of
the often-said phrases that I used to hear
when I was a child. Things like. "Do what
you love," "Live in the moment" and
"Always be happy."
At the time, I remember thinking that
they were so obvious and banal that I
couldn t understand whv grown-ups
repeated them ad nauseam.
As I've grown into adulthood, I've

noticed that the advice I'm given (both
explicit and implicit) has changed.
Now people say things like, "Do what
makes money," "Live for the future," and
"Always be secure."
While certainly there is some amount of
practical wisdom in the adult versions. I
think the aphorisms heard in my childhood
are much more in line with the Important
Things.
Remembering them helps me keep
things in perspective.
School? It's nothing. Midterms? Hah. A
I winkle shilling cow'.' Entirely inconse
quential when compared to what's Impor
tant.
Friends and family are way more
Important Love and passions even more.
And a thing I call soul-awareness is
paramount one of the Most Important
Things.
