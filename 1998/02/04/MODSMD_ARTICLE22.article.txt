## HIV strains resistant to new classes of drugs 
### Krishna Rangarajan 
Postdoctoral fellows Sarah Palmer and Jody
Lawrence, working under Professor of Medicine
Thomas Merigan at Stanford's Center for AIDS
Research, have recently conducted laboratory and clin
ical studies on HIV.
The studies show that many of the new, experimen
tal drugs being developed by pharmaceutical compa
nies are not effective against "resistant" strains of HIV.
The clinical test confirmed that the phenomenon of
cross-resistance — the tendency of HIV strains resis
tant to one drug to be resistant to all drugs in the same
class — manifests itself not only in laboratory studies
but also in patients.
The studies' findings are currently being presented
at the Fifth Conference on Retroviruses and Oppor
tunistic Infections, at the Chicago Sheraton Hotel.
There are two broad types of drugs that are used to
suppress HIV: reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors,
which work against the RT enzyme, and protease
inhibitors, which inhibit the protease enzyme.
The RT inhibitors are further categorized into three
different classes of drugs. They all work by sabotaging
some aspect of the viral replication process.
For every HIV patient, there is an individual "set
point" at which the amount of HIV in the body, the
"viral load," stabilizes. The purpose of the anti-HIV
drugs is to suppress the viral load below the set point by
preventing viral replication.
Since the development of the first anti-HIV drug —
the RT inhibitor commercially known as AZT — many
new drugs have been created. Since 19%. doctors have

achieved remarkable success in suppressing HIV by
using a "cocktail" of anti-HIV drugs. Today, the stan
dard treatment for HIV patients in Europe and North
America is a three-drug regimen of two RT inhibitors
and one protease inhibitor.
"For 80 to 9() percent of new patients, the triple
combination treatment works to reduce the virus to
undetectable levels," Lawrence said. Though no one is
suggesting the virus has disappeared, patients generally
remain healthier than expected.
The hope is that HIV could potentially be treated as
a chronic condition, though Lawrence adds, "That's
quite optimistic."
Palmer is more circumspect. "We hope to extend the
patient's life," she said.
Hut the success of the drugs against non-resistant
strains of HIV contrasts with their inability to suppress
resistant strains. Against those strains, the viral load
may decrease temporarily, but eventually the HIV load
rebounds to the set point.
These resistant strains are a product of the HlV's
ability to mutate rapidly. "Any suboptimal treatment
gives the virus a chance to develop resistant strains,"
Lawrence said. The resistant strains arose partly due to
the early HIV drugs, which were not completely effec
tive.
"AZT is a suboptimal treatment," Lawrence added.
"We know it now, but we didn't know it then." Resis
tant strains also emerge when patients stop one or more
drugs in their regimen, thus making the treatment sub
optimal.
Palmer's lab study grew two different resistant HIV
strains in cell cultures — MNR and MI)R — and test-

Ed them against new anti-HIV drugs developed by
pharmaceutical companies. They have yet to be
approved for treatment.
The MNR strain was highly resistant to three K I
inhibitors, but three others showed some promise.
Against the MDR strain, two RT inhibitors and five

protease
inhibitors
were ineffec
tive, hut one
protease
inhibitor and
the same
three RT
inhibitors
from the
MNR strain
were some
what effec
tive.
"We're
hoping to
start a clinical
trial," Palmer
said.
Lawrence
treated
patients
infected with
resistant HIV
with different
protease and
RT inhibitors

than they had previously been receiving. The new treat
ments were effective initially, hut viral load rebounded
to previous levels for most patients, showing evidence
of "cross resistance."

Cross resistance occurs when a
strain resistant to one specific pro
tease inhibitor is also resistant to
other protease inhibitors, 'it was
disappointing, because we found a
somewhat higher level of cross re
sistance [than predicted),"
Lawrence commented.

Looking ahead, the center is con
ducting a clinical study to test a new
four-drug regimen for patients who
have not been treated before and
thus probably don't have resistant
HIV. The center is also testing the
effects of taking treatment drugs
twice a day, in higher doses, instead
of three doses. Two doses will be
easier lor a patient to adhere to, but
the side effects may be more severe
with the higher dosage.
