Mcdicine alone can't solve childhood depression

Though anti-depressant drugs like Prozac have
been widely used to combat depression in adults,
experts say that drugs alone cannot fully benefit chil
dren with such mood disorders. A Stanford child psy
chiatrist says that children exhibiting symptoms of
depression need individual and family psychotherapy
along with drugs.

Hans Steiner, professor of psychiatry and behav
ioral sciences, suggested that "while drugs alone may work for some
adults, it's unlikely that a child will benefit from drugs alone." Stein
er said that while insurance companies often encourage physicians to
prescribe drugs rather than expensive psychotherapy, doctors work
ing with children should be especially wary.
"We need to be especially careful when prescribing drugs such as
Prozac (fluoxetine) for children, because physicians are less familiar
with their effects on younger patients and because children are less
likely to benefit from medication without psychotherapy," he said.
Prozac is among a new class of drugs called selective serotonin-reup
take inhibitors. These drugs replace the hormone serotonin, which the
body usually produces. Studies have shown that those suffering from
depression also often have abnormally low levels of serotonin. Other
symptoms caused by lack of serotonin are aggression and irritability.
Though children may feel better when taking Prozac-type drugs,
underlying behavioral issues may not improve. Steiner explained that
"The drugs kind of fuel the recovery, but they won't fix the whole
thing. If kids have trouble with as complex an issue as relationships
with peers, simply elevating their mmxl helps but does not automati
cally give [them] a whole new set of social skills."
Steiner also commented that in terms of diagnosing childhood
depression, parents should consult experts if their children exhibit
sadness which seems unrelated to events in the child's life.
"If a child is sad one day because his or her friend didn't come over
to play after school, obviously that's not depression. But if the child is
sad for several weeks, even when that best friend is supportive and
things are going well, parents may be well advised to consult with the
sch(X)l counselor, family physician or a child psychiatrist," Steiner
said.
