# Surgery without scalpels:
## Robots destroy brain tumors 
### Saurabh Prakash Editorial staff 
Researchers from the Computer
Science Department working in
collaboration with the Department
of Neurosurgery may make certain
surgical procedures as painless and
unintimidating as a dental checkup.
The robotic system devised hy
these scientists uses precisely tar
geted beams of radiation to destroy
brain tumors without drawing a
single drop of blood.
In this type of treatment, a
patient wearing street clothes
walks into a surgical arena contain
ing only a large robotic arm con
trolled by a real-time imaging sys
tem. After surgeons secure the
patient on a bed, the robot spends
a few minutes performing the
surgery. The patient is then free to
go home.
The team that designed the
robotic system included Assoc.
Neurosurgery Prof. John Adler
and Computer Science Prof. Jean-
Claude Latombe. A former doctor
al student in Latombe's lab, Rhea
Tombropolous, and one of
Latombe's former research associ
ates, Achim Schweikard, were also
vital to this project.
Like other radiotherapy
machines, the robot employs radia
tion to destroy tumors. It sequen
tially emits beams of radiation at
the cancerous growth from several
different directions. Each beam is
individually weak, but their inter
section gives the tissue a lethal
dose of radiation.
Conventional radiotherapy
machines use a similar process to
destroy tumors. But while the
robot developed at Stanford can

aim a radiation beam from hun
dreds of angles, conventional
machines can irradiate only while
traveling along an arc-shaped path
circumscribing the patient's head.
Surgeons using conventional
radiotherapy devices also have to
screw the patient's head to a frame
to prevent the slightest shift in cra
nial position: such a shilt would
deliver a lethal dose of radiation to
healthy brain tissue.
Because of these and other limi-

tations, conventional radiotherapy
devices are useful only for treating
certain sphericallv-shaped brain
tumors. They cannot target irregu
larlv shaped malignancies without
severely damaging adjacent
healthy tissue.
Consequently, surgery is the
onlv viable treatment for mam

patients with brain tumors. Like all
surgical procedures, these invasive
operations require lengths hospital
stays and can be painful, expensive
and risky.
Ihe robot developed b\
Latombe and Adler incorporates
several technologies which over
come the limitations ot convention
al radiosurgery devices and permit
selective irradiation ol often irreg
ularly-shaped brain tumors.
To identifv the location of the

tumor, surgeons t.ike a three
dimensional computer-aided
tomographs scan or magnetic reso
nance imaging of the patient's cra
nium. After devising a plan ot
treatment, surgeons feed the data
into a computer which controls the
robot's movements.
I he robot's arm can aim a beam

of radiation at the tumor from hun
dreds of different angles Software
developed bv Latombe's research
group instructs the robotic arm to
deliver radiation in sueh a wav that
the tumor gets the high dose.
Even irregularly shaped tumors
ranging in diameter from approxi
mately live to Nl millimeters can be
targeted by the robot.
I nlike conventional radiothera
py machines, a non-intrusive
restraint lightlv holds the patient's
head in place during treatment.
Two X-rays cameras located
orthogonal to each other monitor
the patient's head for shifts in posi
tion Every half second, these X
ray cameras relay a pair ol images
to the computer controlling the
robotic arm's movements.
Software designed by Latombe
compares the pictures generated
bv the X-ray cameras to a previ
ously generated MKI or ( ATscan.
With submillimeter accuracy, the
computer adjusts the path of the
radiation beam to compensate for
patient movement.
Though the new system is still
waiting for approval bv the Fixkl
and Drug Administration, clinical
trials at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter and elsewhere have shown that
the robot performs as well, if not
better, than intrusive surgery.
Some inoperable tumors
those which cannot be removed
surgically without risking irrepara
ble and severe damage to the sur
rounding tissue — can be
destroyed with the robot.
The Stanford researchers are
hopeful that with FDA approval,
neurosurgeons will use their robot
to treat tumors throughout the ner
vous system.
