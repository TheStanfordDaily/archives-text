GDear Health Forum,
I've seen several people
taking the drug "ecstasy"
at parties and raves for
years now. What exactly is ecstasy
and how does it work? Is it had for
you?

A Pear KLM,
Ecstasy — also known
as E. X, MDMA.
ADAM — is a recre
ational designer drug used by a
growing majority of today's youth.
Its use is commonly accompanied

by alcohol and marijuana con
sumption. The official name in
organic chemistry for the drug is
(yes, it's a mouthful) 3,4-
methylcnedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA).
This recreational drug has
caused widespread concern of late
as a neurotoxin. Long-term studies
show that it depletes 5-HT from
neurons in rat and primate brains.
Before its classification as a con
trolled substance by the American
and British governments, ecstasy
was synthesized by street chemists
as a recreational drug. MDMA was
originally synthesized in and
intended for use as an appetite sup

pressant. However, it was never
marketed because of the noted side
effects that emerged.
When MDMA is swallowed, it is
digested in the stomach and enters
the bloodstream. Afterwards,
about two-thirds of the drug is
cleared through the kidneys and
the other one-third goes to the
brain; a small amount is metabo
lized to MDA. The amount of drug
remaining in the body is cut in hall
approximately every six hours, and
roughly 3 percent is left after 24
hours.
MDMA was popular among
psychotherapists because of its
ability to reduce anxiety and facili
tate communication. The most pre
dictable feelings experienced by
someone taking the drug are empa
thy, openness and caring. These
assumptions, however, are unquali
fied. as each person is different and

will experience different effects
from the drug.
It has long been touted that
MDMA will provoke feelings ot
sexual arousal among users and
provides for a more heightened
sexual experience. However, the
opposite is usually the case in men.
as use of the drug leads to loss ot
erection and extreme placation.
The drug's effect seems to be
influenced by the environment in
which the drug is taken. For exam
ple. it the user is at a rave or party,
that person may experience sexual
arousal. In IW2. researchers in the
U.S. found that psychiatrists' expe
riences using MDMA varied from
losing track of time to having long
term changes in their spiritual out
look in life — even after their trip
was over. Headaches, stomach
cramps and even death have also
been reported to result from the

drug. I'he information that exists
on the numbers ot deaths expert
enced each year is uncertain -
that's not to say it is completely off
of the mark either.
h this drug bad tor you .' I hat "s
hard to sa\. and I don't think that I
am fit to answer that question. I'hc
available information seems to sug
gest that the drug has mild effects
and carries an inherent risk \shen
taken. The side effects vary with
the individual, and few deaths are
reported each year from the use of
MDMA. However, ot greater con
cern is the tact that LSD is com

monlv sold as ecstasy, and LSD is a
dangerous drug which can cause
hallucinations, brain damage and
death
1 guess the one thing that would
give me the most pause about
someone taking ecstasy is this: if
someone gives you a white pill and
tells you that it is indeed ecstasy,
how do you really know that it is
what they say it is? And moreover,
is it worth the risk? I guess each
and even one of us must make our
own decisions when faced with the
temptation of controlled substance
use. Good luck.
