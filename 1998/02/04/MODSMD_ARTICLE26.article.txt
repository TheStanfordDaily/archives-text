## 
### Bimal Shah Senior staff writer 
More than three years after rob
bing and murdering Stanford grad
uate student David Liu, Larry
Nakia Paul was sentenced for 28
years to life by Santa Clara County
Judge Diane Northway on Mon
day.
Paul pled guilty in December in
exchange for the sentence. Ac
cording to Sergeant Dennis Burns
of the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment, Paul will probably have to
serve at least SO percent of his time
before being considered for pa
role.
"A crime of this magnitude
would probably preclude him from
being paroled" before serving his
lull term. Burns added. Liu was a
"totally unsuspecting victim" with
tremendous potential, noted
Burns, who supervised a task force
that investigated the incident.
The robbery occurred in the
early evening hours on Nov. 13,
IW4, in a carport of an apartment
complex near Oregon Expressway
and West Bayshore Road. As Liu
left his car, Paul and his co-con
spirator, Eddie Jay Pereles, con
fronted him.
A black belt in tae kwon do, Liu
struggled for his life but was
knocked to the ground. Liu was

then held down and shot in the
back by Paul. He was pronounced
dead at Stanford Hospital shortly
after.
Both Pereles and Paul con
fessed to their participation in the
robbery and murder. Pereles did
not strike a plea bargain and was
convicted by a jury last May. He
received a sentence of life without
the possibility of parole that he is
currently appealing.
"This was a good case," Burns
said. "We really had very little evi
dence to connect those guys to
their crimes except their state
ments."
Liu, 23, was a master's student
in product design but was on an
academic leave of absence at the
time of his death, completing the
required work-experience compo
nent of the program.
According to Philip Bourgeois,
founder and president of Studio
Red, a Menlo Park product design
firm where Liu was working, "The
sentence of the guy doesn't even
begin to touch the magnitude of
the loss."
Bourgeois added he would have
preferred to see the death penalty
given to Paul.
Comparing Liu's death to the
loss of a brother. Bourgeois said,
" The whole group was hurt so
much by the occurrence."
