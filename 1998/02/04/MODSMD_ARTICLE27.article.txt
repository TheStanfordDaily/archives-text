## Va talks Violence 
### 
The recent events in my life led
to the topic of this week's column.
At my last intramural basketball
things got a little intense.
One cheap foul and an extremely
hard screen later and a brawl broke
out. Everyone shoving and fighting
— it was ridiculous. So this week,
Vanessa and I have decided to dis
cuss excessive violence in sports.
Robin: Vanessa, do you think
there's too much violence in sports
today?
Va: Once again, you're being un
clear. How do you define vio
lence?
Robin: Well let's go with Web
ster's definition: violence — "a use
of physical force so as to damage

or injure, an abusive use of force,
fury, desecration."
Va: Well, it's all about semantics.
As my friend Jamila Wideman
once told me, "It's all just part of
the game."
Robin: Well, obviously because of
the physical nature of sports such
as football, ice hockey or basket
ball there will inevitably be some
violence, but where do we draw
the line?
Va: 1 recently converted to Cu
bism, and I no longer draw lines.
Robin: OK. Let me phrase it a dif
ferent way. Some people would
say you're violent. How do you re
spond to that?
Va: I like to think of it as con
trolled legal aggression.
Robin: Well when do you think it's
too much? What about spitting in
someone's face like Bill Ro
manowski or biting someone's ear
off like Mike Tyson '
Va: Biting someone's ears is obvi
ously going too far. 1 mean, that
limits a person's piercing opportu
nities, and as Americans we all
have the right to pierce.
Robin: Do you think these types
of violent episodes reflect an over
all violent nature of our society?
Va: Yes.
Robin: Would you like to extrapo
late on that statement for our
readers?
Va: No, you better stop pissing me
off. Next question.
Robin: Well do you think violent
athletes encourage violence in cit
izens?
Va: To some extent yes. As we
said before, the No. 1 abuse day
for women is Super Bowl Sun
day. But then again, you don't

see businessmen going to board
meetings with breathe-rights on
their noses.
Robin: I have a professor who puts
black grease under his eyes before
he passes out exams. But serious
ly, do you think as spectators, we
are paying to see violence?
Va: I don't pay. 1 usually sneak in.
Robin: Well what about the rest of
us?
Va: How would I know? You're
pissing me off again!
Robin: Let's move on. Utilizing
your expert opinion, give us an ex
ample of a hypothetical incident
which you think might be too vio
lent.
Va: Well say you're in some other
state — Texas for example. And a

ref refuses to control the violence
of the game. And a world-class
athlete falls to the ground and
breaks the pinkie on her shooting
hand. That's violence out of con
trol.
Robin: Are you thinking of'some
body in particular?
Va: No. Ahem. Man Hands.
Robin: Do you think violence in
athletes can spill over into their
personal lives and lead to an
above-the-law mentality? Take
for example Mike Tyson or Latrell
Spreewell.
Va: Yes, definitely, but athletes
need to be held accountable just
like anyone else. They must obey
the rules of society no matter how
talented they are.
Robin: Well as an athlete yourself,
have vou ever had violent impuls
es?
Va: No, my coach could mess me
up.
Robin: What are you. a wimp?
Va: Shut up. Whatever, sissy girl.
Robin: Yeah, that's mature. Ow!
Stop hitting me!
Va: Who's your mania?
Robin: Ouch! Knock it off! Ow!
Help! 0w...
Robin and Va's column has unex
pectedly ended due to unforeseen
circumstances. Robin's injuries
should only keep her out for a
week, and the column will return
next week as scheduled.

Vanessa and Robin would like to
thank the LSJUMB for following
us to the hell known as l.ubbock,
Texas. We apologize that your tal
ents went unappreciated by the gun
slinging Texas Tech fans.
