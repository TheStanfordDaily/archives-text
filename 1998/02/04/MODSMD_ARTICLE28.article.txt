### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
It's time for the players to piek themselves up and
dust themselves off.
With four conseeutive games on the road begin
ning at 7:30 p.m. against California in the New Arena
in Oakland, the men's basketball team doesn't have
much time to lament its two losses to the Arizona
schools last week.
Although the Cardinal (18-2.7-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) saw its undefeated season stopped cold and its
national ranking drop from fourth to ninth after last
week's sweep, it has other things to worn about for
now.

"It's harder for the kids." said head coach Mike
Montgomery. "You'd rather they not read anything
about you. good or had. to keep some kind of balance.
You're aware of how things are being said a different
way than they were being said two weeks ago.
"It's just the experience of dealing with it. trying to
keep it in perspective and understanding the nature of
the beast, both when got»d things are being said about
you. which you know are only partially true or not true
at all. versus when you lose a game or two and all the
things are being said the other way."
Arizona controlled the Cardinal in the much-antic
ipated face-off of conference undefeateds last Thurs
day. But it was the 90-87 upset loss to Arizona State in
overtime that really shocked the nation.
The Cardinal played flat from the opening tipoff to
the closing buzzer with the loss to the Wildcats still
weighing heavily on their minds.
But the team must move on and prepare for its
toughest stretch of the year. The Cardinal opens the
second half of conference play tonight with what is
perhaps its most taxing portion of the season.
Stanford will face the Bears (8-9,4-5) tonight, then
leave for No. 7 Connecticut (19-3") Thursda\ morning
for a nationally televised game against the Huskies or
Saturday.

Junior Mark Seaton attempts to block the shot of UCLA's Jelani McCoy two weeks ago
at Maples. Stanford beat UCLA 93-80 and hopes to do the same to the Weenies tonight.
Next weekend, the Card will
travel to face the Los Angeles
schools, including a rematch with
No. b UCLA. The Bruins currently
share second-place in the Pac-10
with the Cardinal.
"We were all upset that we lost
both games last week, but we're
not in any kind of desperation
mode," said sophomore power for
ward Mark Madsen. "It's definitely
a very significant portion of our
schedule in that we're playing
some very good teams on the road.
If anything, in my opinion, it's a
motivating factor that will help us
raise our level of play."
Despite having to deal with two
road trips right after a disappointing
week, the team isn't about to con
cede anything.
"We're just going to play a bas
ketball game," said junior point
guard Arthur Lee. "Forget that it's
on the road. The road doesn't mat
ter. Obviously last weekend home
court didn't matter, so we're going
to go out and make homecourt not

matter for the teams that we play."
Montgomery agrees that the
team has taken on a healthy attitude
with regard to its situation.

You'd rather they not read
anything about you, good
or bad, to keep some kind
of balance. You're aware
of how things are being
said a different way than
they were being said two

"It's a tough stretch, and we're
really going to have to play at our
best to have a chance to win." Mont
gomery said. "We knew this stretch
was going to he tough. We're fine
mentally. We got rocked ;i little hit
mentally Saturday, probably people
weren't expecting that."
Madsen made his first appear
ance in conference play against the

Sun Devils since suffering a stress
fracture in his right foot in Decem
ber. Though he played only 14 min
utes, that was more than he was ex
pected to participate, and he made
his presence known with 10 points
and five rebounds.
Madsen also adds more depth to
the Cardinal, especially after for
ward Pete Van F.lswvk injured his
shoulder against Arizona State.
Montgomery still isn't sure
whether Van Elswyk will start, or
whether Madsen or junior center
Mark Seaton will replace him if he
doesn't.
The team already defeated Cal
this season with an S4-74 victory on
Jan. 10. In the loss, the Bears got
strong performances from their
backcourt transfers, Cieno Carlisle
and Thomas Kilgore.
Focusing mainly on Carlisle in
the first half, the Card was surprised
by Kilgore, who led all scorers at
halftime with 11 points.
After intermission, the team was
able to shut Kilgore down, but
Carlisle exploded for 22 of his game
high 25 points.
"Carlisle was hitting some

tremendous shots," Lee said. "He
was feeling it. Sometimes you can't
stop that. Kilgore. we didn't expect
him to be a driver and a shooter
scorer as much as he was last time, so
that caught us by surprise.
"We don't expect that to happen
again. We just have to get into them
and turn it up a little bit defensive
ly."
The deciding factor in the game,
however, was the overall team play.
The Cardinal dished out 19 assists
compared to Cal's nine, and the
Bears only had two dishes in the sec
ond half.
