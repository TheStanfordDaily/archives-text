## Men's hoops looks to regain momen- 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
It's time for the players to piek themselves up and
dust themselves off.
With four conseeutive games on the road begin
ning at 7:30 p.m. against California in the New Arena
in Oakland, the men's basketball team doesn't have
much time to lament its two losses to the Arizona
schools last week.
Although the Cardinal (18-2.7-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) saw its undefeated season stopped cold and its
national ranking drop from fourth to ninth after last
week's sweep, it has other things to worn about for
now.

ence) vs. California (8-9.4-5) at the New Arena in Oak

"It's harder for the kids." said head coach Mike
Montgomery. "You'd rather they not read anything
about you. good or had. to keep some kind of balance.
You're aware of how things are being said a different
way than they were being said two weeks ago.
"It's just the experience of dealing with it. trying to
keep it in perspective and understanding the nature of
the beast, both when got»d things are being said about
you. which you know are only partially true or not true
at all. versus when you lose a game or two and all the
things are being said the other way."
Arizona controlled the Cardinal in the much-antic
ipated face-off of conference undefeateds last Thurs
day. But it was the 90-87 upset loss to Arizona State in
overtime that really shocked the nation.
The Cardinal played flat from the opening tipoff to
the closing buzzer with the loss to the Wildcats still
weighing heavily on their minds.
But the team must move on and prepare for its
toughest stretch of the year. The Cardinal opens the
second half of conference play tonight with what is
perhaps its most taxing portion of the season.
Stanford will face the Bears (8-9,4-5) tonight, then
leave for No. 7 Connecticut (19-3") Thursda\ morning
for a nationally televised game against the Huskies or
Saturday.

at Maples. Stanford beat UCLA 93-80 and hopes to do the same to the Weenies tonight.
