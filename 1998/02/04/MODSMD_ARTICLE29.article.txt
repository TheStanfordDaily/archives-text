Sixteen of the 26 members be
long to the national team. They just
defeated the No. 1 team in the na
tion. Their NCAA tournament is
coming up, and you didn't even
know Stanford had a team.
Fencing â€” a sport of agility,
quickness and athleticism. The Stan
ford varsity fencing team is one of
the best in the nation.
Two weekends ago. the women's
team defeated No. 1 Penn State for
the first time. Ever. With a 5-0 victo

ry at the Penn State Invitational, the
women proved that they are the
team to beat in the upcoming
NCAAs
The men finished second to the
defending national champions in the
same meet. Stanford finished 5-1. its
only loss coming to Penn State.
"I lands down, it was the toughest
performance we've ever had." said
senior Sasha Zucker.
In its closest match of the tourna
ment, the women defeated Penn
State 18-14. The women cruised past
the rest of its opponents, with the
next closest matches being 24-8 vic

tories over NYU and Penn.
The Penn State men defeated
Stanford 17-10, but the Card easily
beat the rest of its competitors. The
match with Pennsylvania proved ex
citing. as Stanford won 15-12. The
next closest match was the Cardi
nal's 19-8 victory over Air Force.
(ioing into the NCAA tourna
ment. the Stanford men will have to
defeat the Nittany Lions to capture
the title.
"Our nund-set is that they're
coming after us." said junior Tim
Chang. "At the same time, we're
coming after them. We're the No. 3

team in the country, so it is just a
matter of focusing and coming to
gether."
Though the Penn State Invita
tional was the biggest meet of the
year, the men and women traveled
to southern California for their final
matches of the season last weekend.
Again the Cardinal was a tough
match for the opponents with both
teams cruising to easy victories. The
final score was 11-1 for the women
and 8-3 for the men.
