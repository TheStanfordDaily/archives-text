■ Thursday-Sunday: Rolex Intercollegiate
Indoor Championships in Dallas.

Sophomores Bob and Mike Bryan and
freshman Alex Kim, along with head
coach Dick Gould, traveled yesterday to
Brookhaven Country Club in Dallas.
The tournament features a 32-player
field out of 5,000 who attempt to qualify.
The pool consists of winners and runners
up from the eight Rolex regional tourna
ments. which were played earlier this
year.
The rest of the pool comprises the win
ner from the Ail-American champi
onships and other at-large and wildcard

selections.
"This is a great chance for the players
individually," Gould said. "It is great to
have practice matches going into the sea
son."
Only three of the 20 top-ranked play
ers will not compete at the tournament.
And Pacific 10 Conference rivals Vince
Allegre and Jean-Noel Grinda of UCLA
and Kyle Spencer from USC will partic
ipate in the tournament.
Bob Bryan was the first of the Stan
ford players to qualify for the Rolex na
tional tournament when he won the All-
American tournament in October.Bob
Bryan is also the Rolex defending cham
pion.
Bob Bryan, the top-ranked collegiate
player, won six straight matches in that
tourney, including wins against eighth
ranked George Bastl of USC «ind fourth
ranked Allegre. to capture a berth in the
Rolex Indoor Championships.
Sophomore Mike Bryan, llth-ranked
in singles, was the next to earn a trip to
Dallas with a win at the Rolex regional
tournament played at Stanford in No
vember. Mike Bryan defeated Kim in the
all-Stanford championship match.
Kim. ranked in the country and

runner-up at the Rolex regionals, re
ceived an at-large berth into the tourna
ment for his outstanding play during fall
tournament competition.
Having won the Rolex regional tour
nament in November, the Brvans will
also compete for the Rolex title in dou
bles.
The Bryans. currently ranked seventh
among collegiate teams, are the only
Stanford team in the 16-team draw, which
features eight of the top 10 collegiate
doubles teams.
The tournament will be played from
Thursday through Sunday with a re
quired consolation draw for all first -
round losers 111 singles and doubles.
Though he said he was looking for
ward to the tournament, Gould also said
he was disappointed that senior captain
Paul Goldstein and junior Rvan Wolters
would not be able to compete.
Goldstein was ineligible to play be
cause he was not a registered student for
the fall season, and Wolters had back
problems for the first part of the year.
"Its unfortunate that they can't go."
he said. "They're both very capable play
ers. and I think they would have done
well."
