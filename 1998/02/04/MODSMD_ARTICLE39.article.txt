# THE 						FLOOD OF '98
## Flood damage pricey but manageable 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
Damage to the University from
Monday's storm, already estimated
at more than $1 million, is the most
expensive since the 1989 Loma Pri
eta Earthquake.
Immediate effects of the storm
were similar to those of the earth
quake. including the cancellation of
classes, the closing of libraries and
periodic losses of power.
Classes, which were canceled
yesterday for the first time since Oct.
18. 1989, the day after the earth
quake. are expected to resume
today.
Though exact dollar figures are
not available, the flood's damage

will cost the University much less
than the earthquake's total bill of
$160 million.
Stanford, which did not have
earthquake insurance to help cover
the damages eight years ago, now
has its own internal insurance policy
for Hood relief. Any damages over
the limit of this plan will be covered
by an outside agency, according to
Jean Hakes, an administrative asso
ciate in the Office of Risk Manage
ment.
Flood repair costs will also be
lower than the earthquake's costs
due to the nature of the damage.
"Long range, we will recover
much more quickly than we did in
'89 because the damage now isn't
structural like it was then," Hakes

said. "It's primarily water damage,
which is easier to fix."
Insurance assessors and a "causa
tion expert" spent yesterday travel
ing around campus surveying the
flood's aftermath, according to Jef
frey Seilbach, director of risk man
agement.
Effects of the Hood appear to be
primarily short-term, unlike those of
the earthquake. Four Row houses
that were damaged in the quake
were uninhabitable for the rest of
the academic year. Structural dam
ages at the Stanford Art Museum
and the west side of Green Library
are still being repaired eight years
later.
In contrast, most of the buildings
hit by the recent storm should re

open very soon. Facilities Opera
tions said they expected to have
power restored to Green, C übberlev
Auditorium and Braun Music C en
ter by today. Water damages may
take longer to repair, hut all build
ings should be operational within
the next few days.
The storm, which dropped 4.9
inches of rain on Santa Clara Coun
ty over 24 hours, was the largest to
hit the Palo Alto area in 30 years.
The last significant storm in the
Bay Area occurred in January 1995.
Like this one, it overflowed storm
drains and caused flooding but on a
much smaller scale. It caused no
power outages, and the sole dam
ages in libraries and dormitories
were wet carpets.

Students splash through the water behind Braun Music Center late Monday night. Students were also seen floating down the Row on mat
tresses and kayaks.
