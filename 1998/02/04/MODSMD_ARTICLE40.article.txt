Stanford stu
dents managed
to find the silver
lining in some
very rain-laden
clouds Monday
night.

The center of campus, which
bore the brunt of the storm, turned
into a water park for some students,
with water pooling up to two feet in
some places.
Sophomore Eli Smith tried many
activities to make the best of the
soggy situation with fellow Sigma
Chi members. "We had somebody
taking pictures," he said. "There

were little pools of water all over,
and we floated around in the water
in a baby pool."
Other fraternities were not left in
the lurch.
"[Kappa Sigma residents) all
started getting ideas around 11:30
p.m. to go out in the water," said
Woo-Jin Park, a sophomore major
ing in economics. "We rafted down
Campus Drive with mattresses until
they became so waterlogged we
couldn't use them anymore."
In addition, Lasuen Mall, which
is behind Braun Music Center, was
partially submerged. Park attempt
ed to go surfing in the Hooded area
but failed when he discovered the
water was not deep enough.
Areas around White Plaza were

also Hooded. "There were some nice
little rapids between Cubberley and
Green Library that we floated
through," said Collin Hathaway, a
sophomore member of Sigma Chi.
Even as students were having fun
frolicking in the rain, Hathaway said
he could see the School of Educa
tion's walls already caving in from
the water pressure.
"We were able to get into Cub
berley. and we were floating in there
until we saw that water was almost at
the electrical switch box," 1 iathaway
said.
Other activities that students at
tempted included kayaking, rolling
down slippery slopes inside garbage
cans, playing Frisbee in the rain and
riding bikes into knee-deep water.
