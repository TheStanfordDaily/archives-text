### Evan Nordby Contributing writer 
There were cascading rivers and candlelight din
ners hut few romantic implications in residences
around campus yesterday No major damage from the
tlcxKi was reported in student housing. Students for
the most part rode out the water and power outages in
gixxJ spirits.
Crothers Hall sustained the most damage of any
residence. Seven graduate students were evacuated to
Escondido Village after their basement residence
rooms were llixxled. Water flowed into the basement
through ground-level windows on the side of the
building facing Escondido Road and through a service
entrance in the rear. Water soaked the students'
rooms. hallwa> sand a library. said Peter Harvey, man
ager ol major repairs for Housing and Dining Services.
Four feet of water was reported in the La Maison
Fran<;aise basement, hampering early efforts to re
store electricity, heat and hot water to the house.
Minor fkxxiing of basement rooms and hallways was
reported in Wilbur Hall. Stern Hall. Roth and Ham
marskjold.
"At Wilbur, our sump pump couldn't keep up."
Harvey said. "And at La Maison the pump
runs on (Pacific Gas & Electric Co.)
electricity," which was out.
Glen Cartwright, facilities super
visor for Branner Hall. Toyon Hall
and Manzanita Park, was upbeat.
"We're very nice and quiet and
dry over here," he said.
Harvey cited the University's El
Nino Hood preparation last fall as
particularly helpful in the storm. He
noted that several past problem
areas, including the first floors of
Larkin and Twain and the Lagunita
basement, remained dry.
"We put in some extra effort, and
we feel it's paid off," he said.
For a couple of hours yesterday
morning, the Cardinal Cogen steam
plant was down, cutting off heat and
hot water to residences from Mir

rielees to Enchanted Broccoli For
est. The steam plant was back on
line by the early afternoon, Harvey
said.
After 19 hours of darkness and
cold, power was restored to the fac
ulty ghetto and the outer Row late
yesterday morning.
The return of electricity was a
welcome relief to Row residents,
coming on the heels of the cancella
tion of classes at 10 a.m.
"We lived in a cave," said Slavian
skii Doni resident Paul Chan. "No
heat, no hot water."
Slav Dom residents played Mafia,
while in Haus Mitteleuropa,sardines
was the game of choice to pass the
time.
"Someone said we should have
these things more often," said sopho
more Eric Leventhal.
Phi Sig residents went one better,
organizing a "synthesizer jam."

Academic pressures, however,
did not abate for everyone. Most
Row houses saw an exodus to
Tresidder Lair, libraries or anywhere
else people could study in the light.
Still others studied by flashlight and
candlelight.
"I need a break," sophomore
Aloha Jamias explained. "1 had the
Hum Bio B-side midterm in Dink at
nine. 1 spent last night studying by
flashlight. The last 24 hours have
been bad."
At Haus Mitt, residents were also
upbeat.
"I saw the 'Classes Canceled'
sign, and I thought it was a joke," said
senior Joie Bernabe. "If President
Casper would just have a moratori
um on class until the sun shines
again, that would be cool."
