# Mid-quarter facilities work causes inconveniences
## Rains painting irks students 
### Zachary Roberts Staff writer 
An eight-day repainting project
began in Rains House yesterda\
when contractors moved into Build
ing Ficht of the graduate housing

complex
Each two- and four-person
apartment is scheduled to take two
days to paint. Bedrooms and com
mon rooms are being painted on dif
ferent days in an attempt to ease the
strain placed on students.

The painting forces some stu
dents to remove everything from
their walls and to pack the entire
contents of their apartments into
boxes Housing and Dining Services
is providing boxes for those stu
dents.
Residents' reactions to the paint
ing process have been mixed. "It
works out well," said electrical engi
neering student Bob Schaffer,
whose apartment is scheduled to be
repainted tomorrow. "I've got a hig
assignment due Wednesday, and
anything after Wednesday I was
happy with."
But some residents are furious
with the painting program.
"1 don't know what they were
thinking," said Rains resident
Derek Lopez, an education gradu
ate student. "They could have wait
ed until spring break at least."
Representatives from Housing
and Dining Services feel that the
painting process is going well.
"We've had very good respons
es," said Peter Harvey, manager for
major repairs and planned projects
at Housing and Dining Services.
"Some students want their homes to
he painted. Rains students tend to
take care of their apartments, and
some are happy with the results of
the repainting."
The improvements are part of a
program of general maintenance
painting for Rains. Since its con
struction and occupation in 1988,
Rains has received necessary main
tenance painting hut no complete
repainting. The repainting is seen as
necessary not just for aesthetic rea
sons. but because it also protects the
sheet rock walls.
Sixty apartments in six Rains
houses were painted this summer as
part of the program.
Residents must find their own
housing for the two days their apart
ments are being painted. For Lopez,
who can sleep in his Volkswagen mi
crovan in the Rains parking lot. this
is not a problem. "1 can sleep in my
van. but it's not the ideal situation,"
he said.
Many people feel that the
process is an inconvenience, and
some, includinn business student

Kathy Williams, have been able to
get their apartments skipped over.
"I sent an e-mail to (Facilities Su
pervisor] Betsy Del Sarto telling her
that the four people in my apart
ment didn't want [it| to get repaint
ed." Williams said. "They've been
surprisingly good about responding
to it."
Williams said that if she was
forced to move, it would irreparably
disrupt her work schedule.
"My main thing is that my com
puter is in my room," she said. "This
is my residence, but it's also mv
place of business. This is where I get
my work done."
The idea of painting sounds good
to Williams, but the timing is bad.
"I'm here in the summer, and it'd be
much easier for me to deal with the
repainting in the summer. It's easier
to take time off from work than
school."
"There is no good time to paint,"

Harvey said. "Rains is occupied 12
months a year. It's just not feasible
to get to all the apartments during
breaks. But we understand that
there are some residents who don't
want the painters to come through
their apartments at this time, and we
respect that.
"We're looking for volunteers
who want their apartments paint
ed." Harvey said. "We're not just
skipping over those who absolutely
don't want the repainting, and we're
not doing it in spite of individual stu
dents. We're trying to be accommo
dating."
However, it did not appear that
all of the affected residents were
aware of that option.
"We're pissed off, but we have so
much work to do that we can't even
worry about the painting," Lopez
said. "I have a six-by-eight loft that I
built in my room and shelves I built
into the walls. No way I can take

them apart."
The biggest complaint by resi
dents is that 48 hours is not enough
time to pack their belongings.
The painters think that things
have been going well. Painters in
Apartment SB said that residents
had complied with the painters and
that there hadn't been any unfore
seen problems.
The paint being used is a new
odorless paint that contains no am
monia products. Most of the resi
dents were not concerned about
possible health effects from the
paint although some expressed
skepticism that the paint was a new
miracle.
"I 've been painting houses since I
was a kid with my father, and I've
never heard of a non-fuming, non
toxic paint," Lopez said.
" They say that they only have the
funds now, but there's a thing called
a bank," Lopez said.
