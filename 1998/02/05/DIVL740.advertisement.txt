'Beta of CaUfornia at Stanford University
A Message from Piii Beta Kappa, Stanford Chapter
Phi Beta Kappa is a nationwide society honoring students for the excellence and breadth of their undergraduate scholarly
accomplishments Membership in the Stanford Chapter (Beta of California) is open to undergraduates of all majors. To be
elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Stanford, at student must achieve academic distinction in the major as well as in courses across
a broad range of fields.
Approximately a tenth of the members of a graduating class are elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Of this number, about one fifth are
chosen in their junior year, the remainder in their senior year.
The Chapter's election guidelines (revised July, 1997*) define "breadth" of study as excellence beyond the major field. To be
considered for election, a student must have taken, by the time elections are held early in the Spring Quarter, at least three
courses in each of the following three ma|or domains of knowledge: Humanities; Science, Engineering and Math; and Social
Sciences To be considered for election, transfer students must have taken at least two courses at Stanford in each of these
major domains
Examples of courses that will satisfy the Phi Beta Kappa breadth criterion include those listed in the BULLETIN for the
undergraduate General Education Requirements (GER) in Areas 2 to 4. Course taken fro GER Area 1 will not be considered
as satisfying the PBK breadth criterion.
A grade ofor "CR" is not considered a sign of distinction. Minimally satisfying the "breadth" criterion is not considered
a sign of distinction,
The academic records of all students are automatically reviewed, so no special action is required for students wishing to be
considered for membership Anonymity in the election process is ensured by removal of students' names from their
academic records before consideration Students who desire that their records not be made available for consideration
by the Stanford chapter of Phi Beta Kappa should inform the Registrar, room 133, Old union.
•NOTE Seniors who graduate in 1997 98 will ba covered under the old guidelines Isee Stanford Bulletin 1996 971
