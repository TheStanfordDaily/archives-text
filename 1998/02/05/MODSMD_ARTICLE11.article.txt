# Illinois newspaper declares no Lewinsky news for a day

SPRINGFIELD, 111. (AP) â€” Too much Monica
Lewinsky? Not here. The newspaper in Illinois' capital
declared yesterday's edition Monica-free.
The State Journal-Register didn't even run
, v Doonesbury" because it would have violated the one
day moratorium on coverage of the sex allegations
involving President Clinton and the 24-year-old former
White I louse intern.
"We've declared this edition Monica-free," Patrick
Coburn. the publisher and editor, wrote 111 a letter to
readers. "Except for this column, you will find no ref
erences to Lewinsky or related allegations in today's
newspaper."
1 he State Journal-Register made it clear the paper
isn't dropping the story altogether. It just waited for

one of the slower days in a rapidly changing story and
took a breather.
"Are we nuts?" Coburn asked readers. "I hope not.
We're just trying to respond, however symbolically, to
the criticism that news organizations, including The
State Journal-Register, arc blowing this story out ol
proportion."
The Monica-free day in Springfield isn't exactly a
trend.
In New York, for example, the Daily News planted
a reporter in first-class on Lewinsky's flight to Los
Angeles to visit her father I'uesday and reported on
everything from her dinner (salmon and an ice cream
sundae) to her choice of reading material (an article on
situps in Cosmopolitan).
