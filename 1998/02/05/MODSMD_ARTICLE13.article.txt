Would-be peacemakers from
around the world pressed Iraq yes
terday to end a standoff over
weapons inspections with diploma
cy before Washington does it with
air strikes. Word emerged of possi
ble progress, including an Iraqi
offer at compromise.
Russia insisted there were signs
of optimism, but President Boris
Yeltsin, using language reminiscent
of the Cold War. said ;i U.S. attack
could lead to "world war."
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
meeting with an envoy from
France, said he was striving for "a
balanced political solution." the
official Iraqi News Agency said.
Iraq has refused to allow U.N.
inspectors into Saddam's palaces
and other key sites, calling it a mat
ter of national sovereignty.
CNN reported the Iraqis were
offering to open some — but not all
of the suspected weapons sites to
inspectors.
Since March 19%. inspectors
have visited 63 sites where they
believed the Iraqis were hiding con
traband. Charles Duelfer, the
deputy chief weapons inspector,
said recently. Inspectors were
delayed from entering 38 of the sites
and flatly denied access to 14 others
in the name of national security.
The I Jnitcd States increasingly is
threatening to resort to military
force to end the Iraqi defiance.
Congress worked yesterday on a
resolution authorizing President
Clinton to launch air attacks, and
U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson
traveled the world seeking support
from fellow U.N. .Security Council
member-nations.

I loping to avert attack, the Arab
League's secretary-general and
I urkey's foreign minister arrived in
Baghdad, joining envoys from Rus
sia ;ind France in pressing Iraqi
leaders for a peaceful solution.
Quoting unidentified sources.
( NN said that Iraq was offering to
allow U.N. inspectors access to
eight disputed sites for ;ibout a
month.
CNN said the Iraqi proposal
called for each of the 15 members of
the Security Council to appoint five
inspectors. The 21 countries repre
sented on the I J.N. Special ( 'ommis
sion. which oversees inspections,
would then each appoint two more.
It said that these experts would
make "visits" to the palaces and
would report their findings directly
to the Security ( ouncil.
Asked about the reported Iraqi
offer. Egyptian Foreign Minuter
Amr Moussa in Cairo said: "We
have been informed by the Iraqis ol
this." He refused to elaborate.
Iraqi government officials would
not confirm the report, which was
similar to an offer Iraq made in
November.
I he Americans rejected the ear
lier plan, saying il appeared to be an
attempt by Baghdad to bypass the
Special Commission and ignore the
commission's mandate to set up
long-term monitoring of suspected
chemical, biological and nuclear
programs.
At the United Nations, British
Ambassador John Weston suggest
ed the latest reported proposal
would also prove unacceptable.
"The Security Council will want
to be satisfied the Special Commis
sion can t>o about its job in the man

ner required by Security Council
resolutions." he said.
In Washington. Clinton said the
United States' "bottom line" is to
deny Saddam the capacity to devel
op and deliver weapons of mass
destruction.
" I he best way to stop Saddam
from building nuclear, biological or
chemical weapons is simply to get
the international inspectors back to
work with no restraints," he said.
Iraq's National Assembly was to
hold an emergency session on the
crisis today. A senior member of
the Iraqi parliament said yesterday
