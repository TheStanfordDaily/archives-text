University should help
students pressured by
Asian economic crunch

Affording Stan
ford's $21,300 tuition is
not an easy task.
This is even more true for those
who must pay at least twice that
amount due to southeast Asian cur
rency devaluations.
The University must act more
effectively to respond to the needs
of students being hit hard by the
financial meltdown in their home
countries*, SJ ,
In the past few months, countless
Asian international students »in the
United States have watched their
costs of living and learning abroad
soar as their governments floated
their currencies.
And as the baht, won and ringgit
continue to lose their strength to the
American dollar, many internation
al students are being forced to find
new ways to afford staying at Stan
ford.
Students and Asian governments
have already approached university
administrators across the nation to
address the financial burden of con
tinuing study in the United States.
At Stanford, the Bechtel Interna
tional Center has been working with
students to try to ease the pressure
brought on by the deflation of their
money.
But the University has been too
slow in joining the effort to help stu
dents.
The international center has been
working to help students approach
University officials with their con
cerns and requests for financial
assistance.

International students are not eli
gible for financial aid from the U.S.
government, so options are limited.
Options available to them include a
waiver of the late fee, an extension
of the deferment period or an emer
gency loan.
But while officials are assessing
the situation and considering the
options, penalties are accruing on
international students' bills.
Not enough concrete action has
been taken to ease the difficulties
and anxieties that these students
face.
The University is not responsible
for dealing with individual financial
circumstances, nor is it expected to
provide unfair tuition exceptions
for international students because
of situations in their home coun
tries.
But Stanford is responsible for
ensuring that students who are
already here are not hindered in
their academic pursuits because of
circumstances that are beyond their
control.
The University should maintain
its commitment to all of its current
ly enrolled international students —
not just the wealthy students who
may survive the economic crisis
without the need for Stanford's
financial aid.
Within the next week, officials
from the international center, the
Financial Aids Office, the Office of
the Dean of Research and Graduate
Policy and the Bursar's Office will
meet to discuss strategies for help
ing affected students.
We hope that as a result of those
meetings, the University will offer
these students more flexibility in
payment schedules.
Students should not be penalized
as they try to find new and creative
wavs to finance their education.
