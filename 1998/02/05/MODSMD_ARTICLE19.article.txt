# Campus Viewpoint: Courtney Lake
## LGBCC glass appears half full 
### 
WE ALL
REMEMBER
those little
motivational and inspira
tional sayings we've read
in books, heard from var
ious friends and have
coined ourselves.

However trite these sayings are, they
encompass aspects of reality in concise
and simple ways. For example, people use
the water glass metaphor to describe their
outlooks on life. Is the glass half full or
half empty? Are we optimists who see the
benefits of the glass's contents, or pes
simists who recall that the water in the
glass is not mineral but tap? What is your
outlook on life's trials?
Three weeks ago, the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center received a
letter from University administrators that
stated the center had won the battle to
receive a director. But the letter went on
to say that due to fiscal considerations, the
center would only receive a half-time
director. When the decision was released
at the center, the 15 people who were pre
sent there expressed mixed reactions.
Within the space of three hours, the news
had spread throughout the queer commu
nity. Many felt that this decision was a slap
in the face to gay campus politics.
The center has fought a long and hard
campaign for a full-time director. In 19K7,
it presented a working report assessing the
needs of the gay community on campus to
then Dean of Students Michael Jackson.
Unfortunately, the report was released as

Jackson was leaving his position as dean of
students. As it was a time of transition and
flux for the adminisjshelved and left to
gather dust until 1994.
In 1994, the report was rediscovered by
gay students and faculty. Together, they
updated and reworked the report until
Dean of Students Marc Wais arrived. This
was 1996. No one ever said progress was
speedy.
Fast forward to 1997. The final propos
al for a full-time director was submitted to
Wais and Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya. Within a month, the Cen
ter was granted the funds to obtain a half
time directorship. When the news came
out, it caused a decisive split between
those who saw this as progress and those
who saw this as an administrative white
wash. For these individuals, the glass was
half empty.
My close friend labeled the center's
case as "classic minority politics." "Minor
ity groups never get what they fully want.
If they did, those in power would lose their
grasp," she says. To her. this is a situation
of haves and have-nots. For her, the Uni
versity's refusal to hire a full-time director
implies that the administration sees the
LGBCC as inferior to other community
centers on campus. "Furthermore," she
states, "the whole thing about not having
funding is crap. Everyone knows this Uni
versity is loaded!"
We all make jokes referring to Ger
hard's salary and the little expensive oddi
ties which Stanford acquires during the
year; it is part of dealing with the painful

process of paying tuition. But Stanford
just completed a four-year fiscal reduction
plan. All areas of the University from
administration on down to technical sup
port were affected by funding cuts. The
administration had to consider the recent
financial cuts as they reviewed the center's
request for a full-time director.
Maybe my eyes are glazed over with
the prospects for the future of the center.
Some would say that 1 have been co-opted
by the mainstream and have sold out to
the establishment.
Maybe I am too naive and too trusting
of people when 1 take their word for face
value, but I believe the administration
would have funded a full-time director if
doing so had been possible. The Center
had no director prior to this decision, and
1 do not see the addition of a part-time
director at the center as a negative occur
rence.
Every group needs to start somewhere.
For the center, it will be with a half-time
director. While a full-time director would
have been optimal, a part-time director is
a step in the right direction. Leaders
emerge from the strangest situations and
change occurs when no one expects it.
Instead of comparing the glasses to sec
which one is more full, maybe it is time to
raise them in a toast — a toast celebrating
how far the center has come.
