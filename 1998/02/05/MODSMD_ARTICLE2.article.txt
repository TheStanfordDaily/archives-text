ing up to celebrate.
"With legacies as our guide, we create our
path to the future" is the theme for this celebra

of national Black History Month. Today's book
signing by award-winning author Darlene Clark
and tonight's Jazz and Poetry Night at the Cof
fee House mark the beginning of a month filled
with activities.
Nnenna Ozobia, a sophomore international
relations major and one of the three Black
Leadership Month directors, describes the
theme as a desire to "promote awareness not
only of historical aspects [of the black commu
nity] but future leadership." Activities reflect
this desire to both recognize the past and cele
brate the future.
One of this year's new events is a poster con
test titled "Who's Who in Black America,"

which asks students to identify key black ac
tivists. some of whom are widely recognized and
others whose influence has gone unnoticed.
The month is full of a wide range of activities
that emphasize the commitment to serve the
whole community. Tomorrow,Lagunita Dining
