Dunn's message fails
to support tolerance
I was deeply disturbed by Damon
Dunn's column entitled "Don't let religion
separate us" in Tuesday's paper. The mes
sage of the title is one 1 enthusiastically
support, but the body of his column
proved deceptive to that message and
frightening in its implications.
Mr. Dunn begins by writing. "I do not
believe that any one religion has a corner
market on God" in what seems to be a
tone of tolerance towards various religious
beliefs. But he quickly strays from this tol
erant voice. He suggests that Islam is
acceptable because Mohammed is only a
different name for Jesus Christ.
He forgives Muslims because they were
raised calling Jesus by this name, writing
"the God that I know would never damn a
righteous soul because he or she cannot
say some name."
Dunn's ultimate point is this, in his own
words: "I would argue that everyone in the
world who listens to that little voice in his
or her heart is listening to Jesus Christ."
With this thought. I would warn Mr.
Dunn to be extremely careful. It is disturb
ing. even frightening, to combine the idea

of not letting religion "separate us" with
the assertion that all of us can find Jesus
Christ inside ourselves. If one reads
between the lines, it sounds like he is sug
gesting that if everyone were Christian,
there would be no separation, and the
world would be a better place.
I would like to know how Mr. Dunn
knows that Jesus is inside everyone and
exactly what his intention is in making this
claim in a public forum. I can say to him
that Jesus Christ is not inside my heart
speaking to me, nor is he within the hearts
of other Jews. Buddhists. Muslims or the
followers of countless other religions. I
agree that religious division is an issue that
needs to be focused on because it claims
the lives of innocent people every day. all
over the world.
However, the solution is not to be
found in having everyone find Jesus or
convert to Christianity. We must accept
each other's differences and learn from
each other with open minds. Together, we
can work towards unity. I would rather Mr.
Dunn embrace and enjoy his own religion
without feeling the need to convince the
Stanford community that everyone is a fol
lower of Jesus Christ or a "child of God."

Dunn incorrect in his
assessment of Muslim
belief in Jesus Christ
Though 1 agree fully with the major
points of the eloquent column penned hy
Damon Dunn on Feb. 3, I have one small
correction to make.
Dunn writes. "Some ehildren are
raised and taught about Mohammed.
From birth, their parents teach them the
Islamic religion.
"These children can no more say that
they believe in Jesus Christ than I can
say I believe in Mohammed."
As a Muslim. I would have to dis
agree. Muslims, the followers of Islam,
believe in all of the prophets of Judaism
and Christianity.
In fact, we believe Jesus (peace be
upon him) to be one of the greatest and
most important prophets of God.
The only difference is that we do not
believe him to be divine, i.e. the son of
God.

'Company' is comedy
It is surprising to me that an audience's
reaction to a movie can bring out the type
of bitterness expressed by Ware Wendell's
letter on Tuesday, Feb. 3. He is being over
ly sensitive considering the context of the
situation.
Wendell incorrectly evaluates Laßute's
excellent and disturbing film "In the Com
pany of Men." It is not a documentary on
discrimination towards the handicapped
women. It is a black comedy in the genre of
other excellent films such as Stanley
Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove." It is not "a
look into the dark heart of an ordinary
man." It is an examination of an extraordi
narily evil man who hurts and humiliates
people "because he (can]." If his diatribes
were accurate reflections of the feelings of
men towards women, people wouldn't
have relationships, and those statements
wouldn't be comical.
Wendell also fails to notice that the vic
timized characters are not admirable
either. Chad's friend Howard is a willing
accomplice to Chad's evil plans, despite
Howard's clear objections. The deaf
woman deceives Howard and allows their
relationship to continue, even though she
has no feelings for him.

While laughing at disabilities is certain
ly not acceptable, it is hard to expect peo
ple not to laugh under the circumstances.
People expect the 10 p.m. showing of
Flicks to be a wild, fun experience. It is dif
ficult to watch a deeply disturbing film in
silence when you are accustomed to the
traditional Flicks films and atmosphere.
In "Dr. Strangelove," is it funny when in
the midst of a nuclear crisis, the president
declares, "Gentlemen, there's no fighting
in here, this is the war room"? Would it be
funny if that really happened? Wendell
needs to look at this film in the same way.
While "In the Company of Men" is def
initely disturbing, its still just a fictional
black comedy, and portions of it are
humorous only because the context is
absurd. Just because the evil is slightly
more subtle than a meathook murderer
doesn't mean that it's any more realistic.
