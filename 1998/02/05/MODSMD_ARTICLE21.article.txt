## The 						demise of the different-drummer Row

T. J. Babbitt

THIS YEAR, Housing Assignment
Services is paying people to assem
ble the history and vital statistics of
Stanford's Row houses and then place them
on attractive Web pages. This will enable
student consumers to learn, with a few easy
mouse clicks, the kinds of available housing
options
I'm all for it. Though your typical fresh
man might not know the difference between
ZAP and Zapata, those differences are
j/. what make Stanford housing great. Nothing
* is more symbolic of the w ide range of choic
p es available to Stanford undergraduates
t than the Row.
t Over the decades, the Row has evolved
\ into an idiosyncratic group of houses with
' highly differentiated personalities. Some
' houses are haughty, some are laid-back and
others are downright seedy. On the whole,
the people compiling those Web pages have
a lot of interesting material with which to
work.
Unfortunately, a lot of these wonderful
little differences will disappear next year.
From cleaning methods, to the house stall
selection process, to the color of the walls.

the University is stamping one cookie-cut
ter policy after another on Row housing.
One Residential Education staff member
stated that the new policies represented "a
hunger for simplification." So whatever
happened to valuing diversity, once such a
big Res Ed priority?
The simplification, standardization or
whatever you want to call it is taking many
forms. For example, Housing and Dining
Services recently announced that most
houses scheduled to be renovated must be
university cleaned, thus ending a decades
old tradition of self-cleaned houses. Many
students find that self-cleaned houses pro
vide a cheaper and more communal alterna
tive to professionally-cleaned houses.
According to Keilh Guy, director of
Housing and Dining, some student-cleaned
houses have more maintenance problems
than professionally cleaned houses. I find
this hard to believe. When a typical student
cleans the toilets and sinks, he or she rarely
causes structural damage to the building.
The administration justifies the new
cleaning policy as a means of protecting the
investment it will make when it renovates

the houses. Ilowever, the scheduled renova
tions will have a minimal impact on most
houses. The Capital Improvement Program
is running out of money and lagging behind
schedule. It is now concentrating only on
routine maintenance tasks such as replacing
antique kitchen appliances, putting in new
carpets and painting the walls.
Oh. yes, the walls. A lot of houses on the
Row have not received University-spon
sored coats of paint in decades. Students
have stepped in to fill the vacuum. Row
house rooms are filled with chartreuse and
mauve, purple and forest green, lemon yel
low and sky blue. If you wander around the
Row. you will encounter interesting murals,
elaborate abstract designs and aesthetically
challenging color choices. Unfortunately,
next year we Children of the Rainbow will
have to cope with off-white walls. And peo
ple who resist the new paint regime will see
that resistance reflected on their University
bills.
With these two misguided policies.
Housing and Dining seems hell-bent on
turning livable houses into sterile museums.
Not to be outdone, Res Ed also has a plan

for ruining the Row. They want to turn the
communal house manager system into a
centrally administered program by imple
menting a new University-wide manager
selection process. To do this. Res Ed will
change the timetable that has been tradi
tionally used to select house staff. Adminis
trators have also created standard applica
tion paperwork and now insist that all hous
es use it.
I his year, administrators say they aren't
interested in having a voice in the manager
selection process — that most intimate and
private of house decisions. Hut who knows
what will happen next year? Is Res Ed ulti
mately planning to do all the selection
itself? That would be sad. but it wouldn't be
surprising.
The basic problem is that Res Ed is try
ing to insert itself into a decentralized sys
tem in which it has no obvious role to play.
Maybe it has too many administrators doing
too little work. It there's ever a new round
of University budget cuts. I'd suggest that
the president and provost take a long hard
look at Res Ed.
Obviously, Row houses at Stanford are

not perfect, and not all change is had. But
recently. Housing and Dining and Res Ed
have begun imposing policies that are bad
for students and widely opposed by them.
The only advantage these new initiatives
might have is that they will make life sim
pler for administrators who impose them or
that they will enable the administrators to
justify the existence of their own jobs. But
these departments exist to serve Stanford
students, not themselves.
