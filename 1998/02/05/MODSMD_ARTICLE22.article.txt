### Bobby Blunt 
The Stanford women's rugby team more than ful
filled head coach Franck Boivert's expectations with a
57-0 drubbing of league opponent Humboldt State on
Saturday.
Boivert wanted the Stanford team to win by a large
margin to prove both to others in the Northern Califor
nia Women's Collegiate Rugby League and to the team
itself that the Cardinal deserves the top league ranking.

■ Saturday's result: Stanford 57. Humboldt State 0

Although Humboldt State had an advantage physi
cally, the Cardinal showed technical superiority. Stan
ford (5-1,3-0 league) played a game of quick transitions
that proved too fast for the opposition.
"Even though Humboldt attempted to kill the ball in
rucks and mauls, we were able to play the ball quickly,"
said junior winger Stephanie Kiegg. "A big help in this
was good refereeing. There was a lot of advantage
play."
Although Humboldt is a new team this year, it al
ready has become known as one of the tougher oppo
nents in the league. The team came out very strong and
aggressive at the beginning of the Stanford match,
showing off strong tackling.
Stanford, however, kept its composure early and re
tained control of the ball. The key to the Cardinal's
strong performance was its ability to take advantage of
its opponent's poor defensive alignment.
Stanford quickly set the tone of the game by scoring
early in the first half and never allowing Humboldt a
scoring opportunity. The Cardinal attacked Humboldt
on the fringes of the forward play as well as putting to
gether quick attacks on the outside with the play of the
backline. A key to Stanford's ability was the quick and
timely transitions between the group and spread-out
games.
'"Our quick transitioning of the ball from the group
game to the spread-out game is getting much better,"
Boivert said. "We had very quick trafficking of the ball
in the back line."
The aggressiveness of Humboldt did wear on Stan
ford a bit. though. As the game progressed, the team
lost its composure at times. Boivert said.
This game provided experience for the Stanford
team as preparation for the tough competition it will
face in the playoffs in March and April.
"At times we are not very much a team yet," Boivert
said. " This game was very valuable for the players to
work under tremendous mental pressure, to learn to
stay calm and composed with adversity."
Junior eight-man Judy Mahtaban said team play is
improving.
"We did better at working together as a cohesive unit
— we are starting to gel," she said. "It is frustrating to
play new teams that don't respect the rules, but we have
to let that not distract us or take away from the game.
I'm glad that we kept relatively
calm."
Several of the players provided
excellent performances for the
Stanford team, particularly fresh
man outside center Brittney Blunt,
junior hooker Sara Dwight and se
nior captain and kicker Suzie Hoff
mann.
The team will take its unbeaten
league record on the road this
weekend to play UC-Davis. Also a
new team. Davis should not prove
to he one of the tougher league op
ponents because it does not have
the Cardinal's level of experience.
Junior team president and open
side flanker Lara Strauss said Davis
was one of the last teams to orga
nize and has only been practicing
since the start of this quarter.
Boivert emphasized that any
game is a gixxJ opportunity.
"We need to work on playing
full out for HI) minutes wrth concen
tration and intensity,* he said. "Our
next goal is to season our new. up
and-coming players."
