### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
OAKLAND — It was a story of two
halves.
The No. 9 men's basketball team eame
out slow and sloppy in the first half of last
night's matchup with (alifornia and found
itself trailing at halftime.
The second half wasn't a rout, but the

Cardinal (19-2. K-2 Pacific 10 Conference)
played more aggressively and cleanly en
route to a 74-72 victory at the New Arena.
The team hit all six of its shots from he
hind the arc after the intermission, and its
tenacious defense helped make all of Cal's
big men nonentities.
"We had a little slump at home, and we
didn't expect that to happen." said junior
point guard Arthur Lee. "We knew we

had to come out on the road and just play
for ourselves. We started out slow in the
first half. I hings weren't working. Hut
when it counted, guys stepped up and
played well."
I he victory snaps the Cardinal's two
game losing streak and brings its record
away from Maples Pavilion this season to
11-0. It marks the first time in three years
that Stanford has swept its season series

with the Hears.
The win also gives the ( ardinal a littlt
bit of a relief before having to face No '
C onnecticut this Saturday and No. <
UCLA next Thursday.
The Cardinal found itself down by onl;
five at halftime. thanks largely to Cal
p<x>r shooting performance up to tha
point. The Bears shut only 12-of-34
from the field for 35 percent in the
first half.
Stanford shot 46 pfercent hut only
had 26 attempts and Was a miserable
0-for-7 from three-point territory.
They also racked up 13 turnovers
compared to only seven assists.
The most glaring problem for the
Card in the half was the absence of
Lee, who had only two points on two
shot attempts. He also had three
turnovers and only two assists.
"I think it was a ease of Stanford
making the big plays down the
stretch," said Cal coach Ben Braun.
"The thing about the game, though,
is our guys played awfully hard.
Stanford is a veteran ball club, but
our guys battled and battled."
And if Stanford's big plays could
be singled out, Lee would be in
volved in most of them. He only took
four shots after the intermission, but
he made each one count.
With Cal (8-10, 4-6) holding its
largest lead of the game at 43-35 with
16:39 to play, Lee hit back-to-back
three-pointers to pull Stanford back
to within two points.
After that, the two teams spent
the next 10 minutes going neck-and
neck, tying each other four times.
The Bears still had a 62-60 edge when
Lee tcx)k control once again.
With 2:12 to play, he pulled up for
a three-pointer near the top of the
key and was knocked down by Cal
forward Sean Marks as the basket
sank. Lee converted the free throw
for a two-point lead.
After Bear junior guard Geno
Carlisle hit a 15-foot jumper for an
other tie score, junior guard Kris
Weems led Lee as he came off a
screen and hit another trey to put the
Cardinal up for good with one
minute remaining.
Lee finished with a team-high 17
points and was a perfect three-for
three on free throws, all of which
came in the final 2 1/2 minutes.
Weems added five rebounds and
16 points, including two clutch three

pointers in the second half, and ju
nior center Tim Young had another
double-double with l7pointsand 15
rebounds.
Young's work at the defensive
end of the court was even more im
pressive.
He and the rest of the frontline
held the Bear frontcourt to 13 points

and 16 rebounds combined.
"Frankly, in the first half we
looked like a team that doubted
ourselves a little bit," said Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery.
"We were really out of sync in the
first half. We turned it over 13 times
and really were not playing with a
lot of confidence."
