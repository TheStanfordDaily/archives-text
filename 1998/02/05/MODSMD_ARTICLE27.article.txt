■ Tonight: No. 6 Stanford vs. Trinity
Western University at Burnham
Pavilion, 7 p.m.

The Cardinal (4-0. 3-0 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) has its
second opportunity in as many
weeks to show a different face on
the court in a match against Trinity
Western University at 7 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.
The team from Langley, British
Columbia, meets Stanford in an ex
hibition match that will not affect
the Cardinal's record because the
Spartans are not NCAA members.
Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves and TWU head coach Ron
Pike are acquaintances and will
meet as part of the Spartans' Cali
fornia tour, which includes a match
against Sacramento State this week
end.
Nieves said he likes exhibition
matches because "it gives us the
freedom to play personnel who
have not gotten much playing time."
Cardinal fans will likely see se
nior Devin Poolman and juniors
Patrick Klein and Chris Griffith as
outside hitters tonight, junior Jere
my Bart and freshman Dan Zhang
as middle blockers and freshman
Brad Griffith as setter.
"With this type of match at this
point in the season, the most pro
ductive way to approach it is with
these players," Nieves said. " There
is no need to give the starting six an
other match of experience."
What fans will most likely not see
are senior middle blockers Tad
Hoffman and Keenan Whitehurst.
junior outside hitter Josh Palacios
and sophomore outside hitter Andy

Witt. Nieves hopes to give Hoffman
and Whitehurst a break as the ( ar
dinal should not need them for a vic
tory: Palacios and Witt have health
concerns.
Palacios has a long-term shoul
der problem that required surgery

last year hut continues to pla\ with
discomfort and pain W itt also has a
shoulder problem considered to
be short-term resulting from a
muscle pull in warm-ups prior to


Kwesi Legget Daily fil«
Freshman Joshua Lukens holds back for the block in a game last
month against UC-San Diego. The Cardinal's undefeated record will
be tested tonight against the British Columbian Trinity Western Uni
versity team.
Stanford's match with UC-San
Diego in January.
Like last week'* California
match, tonight's is expected to be
competitive.
"We expect our opponent to put
pressure on us," Nieves said.
To defeat Trinity Western, the
Cardinal will have to stop junior
outside hitter Dan Bainard. a two
time All-Canadian and one of the
most dominant offensive players in
the Spartans' conference, the
British Columbia Colleges' Athletic
Association. Bainard has carried a
heavy hitting load for TWU. with
225 more attacks than any other
Spartan hitter.
Senior outside hitter Eric Doef is
considered the best all-around play
er at TWU and brings significant ex
perience to the Spartans. His previ
ous school. Red Deer College, won
back-to-back national champi
onships his freshman and sopho
more years.
As a team, TWU is currently first
in its division. Stanford is now tied
with Hawaii for first place in the
MPSF Pacific Division.
