MEN'S RUGBY

■ Saturday's result: Stanford 59
Humboldt State 24

During the game at Maloney
Field, the Cardinal (7-0 2-0 Pacific
Coast Conference) extended its
undefeated record with hard work
and strategy — namely keeping a
fast tempt) and taking advantage of
superior speed and technique.
Sophomore flanker Borut Grgic
played an exeeptionul game for
"Stanford, running the ball well and
breaking tackles. Senior inside cen
ter Mike Weiner scored two tries, as
did junior Steve Preonas and senior
Dave Warter.
Senior president Greg Guinney,

senior captain Trung Ngo and
sophomore newcomer Jackson
Wagener added to Stanford's at
tacking offense with a try each. Se
nior kicker Dave Warter comple
mented Stanford's nine tries with
seven conversions. Senior Tom
Efird, who took over as captain for
the second half, also contributed
significantly.
This Saturday, the Cardinal
travels to UC-Davis to face a team
that finished last season ranked
No. 3 in the nation. Although Stan
ford beat the Aggies last year, a vic
tory this weekend is by no means a
sure thing.
The victory over Humboldt State
highlighted Stanford's excellent of
fensive abilities but also showcased a
defense plagued by poor tackling
and bad judgment.
"The pack anil baekline had a
great game handling the ball," said
sophomore prop Eric Ciroff. "but
the whole team needs to step up the
defense if we are going to beat
Davis."

More important, the game
against Davis may reflect how well
the COrdinal can expect to do for the
remainder of the season.
"We need to improve in defense
it we are going to have a successful
season," Ngo said. "The game
against Davis will he a good test to
see whether we can implement
changes made to the defense during
practice this week."
Stanford coach Franck Boivert
anticipates a great game against
Davis hut is also concerned with the
Cardinal defense.
"Hopefully, the tackling of Ngo
and senior Jeremy Toner, who is re
turning from an injury, will improve
our first line of defense, especially
near the goal line." he said.
Boivert emphasized that a victo
ry against the Aggies on Saturday
will rely on two things: emotion And
tackling. This Stanford team does
not lack the emotion needed to en
sure a victory. What remains to be
seen is if the team can come togeth
er to fill the defensive gap.
