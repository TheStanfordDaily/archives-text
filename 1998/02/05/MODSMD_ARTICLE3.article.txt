Mary Edmonds, a long time
professor at the School of Medicine
and former vice provost for student
affairs, will traveled to San Francis
co last night to receive the 1998 Bay
Area Black History Month Award
in the area of education.

The award, which is in its third year, is presented
by Union Bank and KQED Broadcasting. Honorees
are chosen by a secret committee composed of com
munity representatives iir.d members of the bank.
The committee accepts resumes and nominations
from individuals and groups in the community but


Edmonds
makes its selections independently.
"We're looking for people who
go beyond the call of duty." said Gill
Gordon, producer of the event and a
past recipient of the award. "We're
looking for people to whom helping
other people is a way of life."
There are five recipients of the
award each year, divided into the
categories of education, community
activism, entrepreneurship, cultural
art and charity. The recipients are
honored in a ceremony, held at the
offices of KQED Broadcasting,

which doubles as a performance
program; several groups will per
form original and historical African-
American works.
In addition to the ceremony,
however. KQED will be airing 30-
second biographical films about
each of the honorees on its Channel
9 television station. The films were
put together in December and will
be aired throughout the month.
"I think this is a magnificent
statement on the part of KQED and
Union Bank." Gordon said. "It
shows that they are really interested
in investing in the community."
Edmonds was nominated for the
award by the "100 Black Women of

the South Bay," of which she is a
member.
"I'm amazed and humbly grati
fied to have been chosen." Ed
monds said. "I'm really very
pleased."
Edmonds, who is currently acting
as the special assistant to the
provost, retired as vice provost for
student affairs in June of last year. In
addition to her work in the Provost's
Office, she chairs the steering com
mittee for NCAA certification of
Stanford athletics and is contem
plating teaching a course in the
spring.
"I'm retired, but I'm not retired,"
she laughed. "And I'm loving it."
