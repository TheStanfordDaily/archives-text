# Jencks: Race gap in testing real
## Visiting scholar from Harvard identifies racial factors in SAT, GRE scores 
### Sangman Lee 
In a speech given last night. Christopher Jencks, a visiting
scholar from Harvard, told the audience that the testing score
gap between black and white students is very real.
According to Jencks. the average scores for black students in
standardized tests such at the SAT or the ORE. as well as in
many common "intelligence tests'" are about one standard devi
ation below those for white students.
The gap is larger on "more reliable"' tests and increases as the
age of the student increases, Jencks said.
"Some people thought that standard tests underestimate
black students' innate skills, and that black students who get S(X)
points on tests will do better than white students that get 5(H)," he
added.
Studies indicate that at elite colleges, white students do better
than black students with identical SAT scores.
However, the gap in academic performance is much less than
the gap in test scores, which only range from about 0.2 to 0.4
points on grade point average.
Jencks added that many of the standardized tests that appear
to measure an innate skill or ability are misleading.
Calling a test an "intelligence" or "aptitude" test suggests to
most laypeople that it is supposed to measure an innate skill or
ability, he said.

"When people hear that blacks do less well than white [on in
telligence tests], they understand intelligence' to mean some
thing innate." Jencks said.
He said this was a misperception. and that so-called intelli
gence tests tended only to measure test-taking abilities.
"You should discount those exams as a measure of intelli
gence and academic aptitude," he added.
Furthermore, many factors may bias the results of these tests.
The context in which a student takes the test can significantly
influence the results "For some students, the way in which the
test is described before can make a huge difference in their per
formance."
"If you give black students and white students a test like the
GRE and describe it with some technical jargon like some psy
chology dissertation, there is virtually no difference in score,"
Jencks said. "II you tell them that it's an intelligence test, the
white students do better. If you tell them to indicate their race,
there is a greater difference.
"After 30 years of being berated for calling the SAT the
Scholastic Aptitude lest, the [Educational Testing Service]
changed its name to the Scholastic Assessment Test," Jencks said.
On the other hand, the content of the tests or their methodol
ogy has little effect. "There doesn't seem to be much of an evi
dence to suggest that changing the contents of these tests changes
their outcome."
