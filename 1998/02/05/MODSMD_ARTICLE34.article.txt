Seniors David Beutel and Timothy
Dalrvmple only expected a handful of
people to show up for (heir inaugural Sun
dav-night lecture on "Intellectual Founda
tions of Christian Faith."
But more than 120 gave up Flicks and
studying for midterms to to sit in the base
ment lecture room of Jordan Hall with a
19-page packet of notes on the subject.
Beutel. a history major, and Dalrvmple.
a religious studies and philosophy major,
created the series "to provide a thorough
introduction to both classical and modern
Christian scholarship and to enable stu
dents to grasp and articulate the intellectu
al case for Christian faith." according to
the organizers' pamphlet.

The series targets "students who find
themselves uncertain of their own faith,
those who wish to be better able to articu
late the Christian faith to others and those
of other backgrounds interested in the
bases for theistic and specifically Christian
belief." the pamphlet said.
The students in attendance came for a
variety of reasons.
Senior Nathan Nutter, a solid Christ
ian. wanted to hear "scientific proof of the
existence of God." Senior David Hong
was attracted by the opportunity to ex
plore "different views on something we
never talk about in Stanford." And junior
Dan Sandberg made the journey because
"1 like to consider myself open-minded: 1
came to hear something 1 totally disagree
with."

The nine-week series systematically ar
gues in favor of a rational belief in God
using an extensive array of logical, scientif
ic and mathematical proofs, according to
the pamphlet. Presenting arguments,
counterarguments and refutations by fa
mous Christians, non-Christians and athe
ists, each lecture attempts to reconcile
faith with reason.
According to Dalrymple, both he and
Beutel "have gone through grave ques
tions of faith." Now that they've made
peace with their own spirituality, they
want to serve as a resource to other stu
dents.
"Generally, theism isn't part of Stan
ford's plausibility structure" or what stu
dents believe in. Beutel said. "We're trying
to change that."
