## Financial Aids Office faces problems of currency crisis 
### James Pritchard Contributing writer 
The Financial Aids Office has
begun to feel the impact of the re
cent southeast Asian financial crisis
as international students affected by
the disaster approach the office for
help.
Many of these students have
been receiving financial aid from
their home governments. But as
these governments now struggle
with economic turmoil and currency
devaluations, their student financial
assistance programs may be some of
the first to suffer cuts. This has
forced Asian international students
to look elsewhere for answers.
"I'm not sure what the Universi
ty can do to help these students."
said electical engineering student
Hae-chang Lee.
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid Robert kin
nallv encouraged students affected
bv the crisis to approach his office

"Any student
concerned should
go right there,
even if they are
not currently re
ceiving financial
aid." he said.
He recom
mended that
graduate students

first contact their departments of
study, which often handle graduate
aid.
The administration is just now re
alizing the implications of the finan
cial disaster as more students go to
the Financial Aids Office for assis
tance.
"We've been approaching this on
a one-by-one basis so far." Kinnally
said. "Even student affected will be
affected in a different way."
Kinnally recently heard from the
Thai Minister of Education that the
Thai government would temporari-

has been one of the countries worst
hit by the region's financial crisis.
Hong Sang Bae. president of the
Korean Student Organization, re
cently drafted a letter to University
President Gerhard Casper, Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James
Montova and Bechtel International
Center Director John Pearson, re
questing the establishment of spe
cial loans for students affected by
the crisis and the extension of defer
rment loans.
Bae asked that students not be
required to pay deferred tuition
until the following quarter.
Casper and Montoya have not
replied. Bae said.
According to Kinnally. students'
individual requests lor assistance
have been successful for the most
part, resulting in extended loans or
adjusted financial aid packages. The
Financial Aids Office has heard of
students' difficulties primarily
through students' advisers and resi
dent assistants.
"There is no special fund for

this." Kinnally said. "Wo arc fortu
nate that we can be helpful."
Officials from the international
center. Financial Aids Office, the
Office of the Dean of Research and
Graduate Policy and the Bursar's
Office will meet next week to devise
strategies to deal with the situation.
Pearson said.
"One thing they're allowing
[graduate students) to do is pay by
the unit." Lee said. Master's stu
dents may take nine units if neces
sary.
Less than a dozen have actually
made requests for help, Kinnally
said.
However, the next school year
could bring real hardship for fami
lies who attempt to tackle the rising
cost of tuition.
Although there may be more re
quests for financial aid next year, the
Financial Aids Office will still be
working from the same amount of
available funds.
"I'm hopeful that the University
will look at these issues." Pearson
said. "II the crisis continues, that's
when it may be difficult to make the
choices."
Although the international cen
ter is not directly involved in the cri

sis. they have acted as a liaison be
tween concerned students and the
Financial Aids Office.
The center has also been work
ing with the Immigration and Natu
ralization Service in Washington.
D.C., to see if there can be some re
lief. One option would be to shorten
the processing period for interna
tional students applying for work
permits.
Pearson reported that there are
1,241 international students from
Asia at Stanford. Kinnally empha
sized that these students are being
treated the same way as other stu
dents who have had an emergency
financial situation.
Kinnally added that the situation
in Asia should not affect admissions.
Stanford's policy on international
admissions has not changed; it has
never been need-blind.
Lee expressed distress that in
ternational students were typically
exempt from receiving University fi
nancial aid.
"A lot of the life savings of Stan
ford parents have been cut in half,"
he said. "Taking that into considera
tion. I think the school needs really
needs to reconsider its position" on
financial aid.
