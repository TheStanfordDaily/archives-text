# television: "Dawson's Creek"
## You Think I'm a Teenager, But I'm Really Satan! 
### Jeff Cooper Contributing writer 
Teenage dramas like "Beverly Hills 90210" and "My So-
Called Life" have long been staples of prime time TV. "But why
stop there," asks the television executive. Sexual dramas are
good, yes, but why not make the series a commentary on ado
lescence, too? And while we're at it, we need a good family
drama for prime time. If we play our cards right, we can bring
all of these elements together into a ratings blockbuster. The
product of this thinking is "Dawson's Creek," the latest in a
long line of programs starting with "The Wonder Years" and
continuing through "Parry of Five."
The flaw in the above logic, though, is serious. Most — if
not all — of the aforementioned prime time soaps rely on sex
to sell the show. Lots of sex. Lots of gratuitous sex. This pattern
works well with college students, even high schoolers, but once
the stars are claiming they're 15 years old and then shagging
their teachers at the school dance, the whole idea of the "fami
ly drama" flies out of the window.
Hearing a high school "freshman" say to a companion,
"You have very nice breasts. No, I'm totally hetero and every
thing, don't worry," is a little disconcerting. The show has
some promise, some humor, and an occasional insightful
comment, but the constant pedophiliac tone is only the first of
"Dawson's Creeks" problems. In the end, I turned off the TV
feeling like a high school freshman: uncomfortable, a little
dirty and pretty sure that whatever I had just done wasn't a
great idea.
The show follows the trials, tribulations, and growing
pains of Dawson Leery (James van der Beek), a 15-year-old
freshman trying his best to live the life of an aspiring filmmak
er while fending off the pains of adolescent emotion. As we fol
low his daily life, we also learn of the stories of his three best
friends: Joey Potter (Katie Holmes), Dawson's childhood con
fidant who now finds herself torn by an awakening crush on
Dawson; Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson), Dawson's.reserved,
sarcastic sidekick, who's engaged in a Clinton-esque scandal
with his English teacher; and Jen Lindley (Michelle Williams),
the new girl in town, whose very presence sends Dawson into
a sweaty-palmed monologue about the mysteries of love in the
modern world. Throw into this mix Dawson's feel-good father
and his adulterous wife, and you've got a domestic mix to en
tertain ... someone.
The target audience for this show is frankly a little unclear.
The opening credits include a disclaimer encouraging only
"mature audiences" to watch it. "Dawson's Creek" is rated
TVI4, so clearly the whole family isn't intended to sit around
the tube together. The idea of the "mature audience," though,
is cramped by the overwhelming bias towards the teenage

point of view.
The young run roughshod over their adult counterpart:
— whether they be securing a place in film class or theatrical
ly confronting a friend's mom about adultery. Even in the ro
mantic spheres, the teenagers win out: Pacey's English teachei

ignores him for 55 minutes
of the show beforel they end
the episode with a passion
ate kiss.
Clearly, the message of
the show isn't entirely
aimed at a bemused adult
audience; with pop culture
references ranging from
"Scream" to a self-con
scious mentioning of
"90210," "Dawson's Creek"
considers the teen viewer
supreme.
The young adult audi
ence is slippery, though,
and needs a lot of talent to
hold onto. The series is
written by Kevin
Williamson who is fresh off
his explosive successes with
"Scream," "Scream 2" and
"I Know What You Did Last
Summer." Williamson has a
very distinctive style of dia
logue, and although the
densely-packed, quirky
tone worked well in such a
self-aware movie as

"Scream," it doesn't quite fly coming out of the mouths of
"normal" high school students.
I often wished I had a rewind button on the TV just to hear
the characters repeat the lines. To hear Joey almost in the same
breath tell Dawson she's "not above witnessing (her) hor
monal suicide," and then assert to his mother, "Your actions
affect others; they bleed into the lives of those around you," is
so jarring that it knocks the viewer loose from the story. When
David Mamet does this sort of thing with the dialogue, it
works. When a prime time soap opera tries it, it's stifling.
The heavy-handed speeches and dramatic monologues
aren't enough to totally crush the fun of the show. Many casts,
it must be said, wouldn't be able to hold on to even the mod
icum of dignity that these actors and actresses retain. When
the writers stop sensationalizing and simply let the circum
stances speak for themselves, the situations seem clear and re
alistic.

Holmes and van der Beek, in particular, play their rela
tionship in a way that anyone who's been a teenager can iden
tify with.
Dawson may be a painfully melodramatic guy most of the
time, but we can see where he's coming from. Katie, similarly,

shoulders the burden of being
the moral center of the show;
her concern and confusion
about her best friend are well
evoked and more than occa
sionally touching.
The relationships among
the central characters, as is
unfortunately the case with
many ensemble shows, are
often almost lost in the whirl
of subplots and threads of ac
tion surrounding them. All of
the threads in "Dawson's
Creek," of course, are about
sex: sex with English teachers,
sex with co-workers, sex on
the kitchen counter. Maybe
the most jarring moment of
the show, came when Dawson
approaches his father looking
for advice on women.
As he enters, he asks,
"Have you seen my video
camera?" The father calmly
and cheerily replies, "Oh,
yeah. It's on our bedside table.
Your mother found it last

night. You ... might want to
take the tape out, though." Without warning, our innocent lit
tle "Wonder Years" encounter has been transformed into
something more reminiscent of "Days Of Our Lives."
The effect is calculated to surprise, which it does, but it
doesn't do so in a way consistent with the show. All it does is
make you laugh ... at the show, not with it. Those sorts of
gimmicks can keep a viewer watching for a few weeks, but
even a talented screenwriter can only take them so far. It's fun,
in a campy, corny sort of way, but I'd rather watch lerry
Springer.
What cripples "Dawson's Creek" in the end is its trans
parency. Young actors and actresses play characters who solil
oquize in honors thesis language and make the show seem like
an overdone children's theater piece on sexual tension. That's
fun, but on the stage of innocent adolescent growth, the com
mercial nature of the program spreads out in all its glory. What
it forgot was the entertainment.
