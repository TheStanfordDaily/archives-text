## 50-pound Chihauhua??? 
### Katie Young Contributing writer 
Padgett Powell's "Aliens of Affection"
(Henry Holt and Co., Inc., $22.50) is thor
oughly bizarre. In his fifth tome, Powell de
parts from his usual style of novel writing
and presents readers with a collection of
nine short stories that laugh in the face of
sanity. "Aliens of Affection" continues where
"Typical," Powell's third book and only other
collection of short stories, leaves off.
Contrary to what the title might suggest,
the "aliens" are not extraterrestrials but hu
mans trapped in the depths of their own na
ture. For the most part, Powell's tales revolve
around individuals who have an abnormal
ability to give and receive affection. From a
mental patient in search of a 50-pound Chi
huahua to the romantic rendezvous between
a middle-aged housewife and a 12-year-old
boy, Powell spins tales that are both revealing
and disturbing. Though dark in nature and
content, their pessimism is more gripping

than depressing.
Many short-story writers have difficulty
creating character depth in a limited number
of pages. But Powell is right on target. With a
seemingly uncanny knowledge of human
behavior, he generates characters in under
50 pages that are as memorable and distinct
as those in full-length books. The characters'
lack of predictability not only makes them
more authentic, but more intriguing as well.
This is far from the cookie-cutter paragons
of consistency that seem to fill the pages of
many modern novels. Powell also makes no
attempt to classify his characters into heroic
or villainous roles. He simply presents them
with all of their virtues and imperfections
for readers to judge for themselves.
One example is Rod, who appears in the
story "Scarliotti and the Sinkhole." Rod, an
accident victim forced to remain in bed most
of the time, is portrayed by Powell as a
predator who makes repulsive comments to
a young store clerk. The latter is a sympa
thetic victim whose father takes a few swings

at him when he comes to visit. Rod is also
an idealistic dreamer who believes he's
about to become a millionaire. In exploring
different sides of his characters' personali
ties, Powell shows a deep understanding of
human nature.
It is also interesting to note that Powell
steers clear of upper middle-class charac
ters, preferring those,to whom fortune has
not been kind. This adds to the book's pes
simistic tone, and the reader cannot help
but compare the unfortunate situations of
the characters to his / her own.
At the same time, Powell prevents read
ers frpm generating much sympathy to
ward his characters. For the most part, his
cast is comprised of sexually frustrated, un
educated, middle-aged Southern men who
rarely leave their lewd intentions unex
pressed. For this reason, "Aliens of Affec
tion" is likely to be at least mildly offensive
to all but the most insensitive readers.
In the uniqueness of its content,
"Aliens of Affection" bears similarity to Ray
Bradbury's "The Illustrated Man." Though
the ideas presented by Powell pale in com
parison to Bradbury's, both writers are sim
ilar in the attention they pay to language.
Using off-beat, dynamic images, Pow

ell is able to keep readers interested when
his plots seem too strange and random to
follow. With an incredible vocabulary, he
chooses words with great care, often juxta
posing obscene references and eloquent de
scription — a stylistic technique which
mirrors his dual portrayal of characters as
crude and wondrous.
In addition, Powell's sentence struc
ture is masterful, varying between simple
and complex language, between long and
short sentences, and between first and third
person narrative.
This enables storylines to continue
flowing when they might have otherwise
been sabotaged by odd plot twists. Though
"Aliens of Affection" may not be suited to
the tastes of some readers, its uniqueness
and absurdity make it worth a trv.
