# Halftones of Harlem

### Elizabeth Brooks Contributing writer 
"Roy DeCarava: A Ret
rospective" offers a moving
look at the photographer
through hundreds of visual
treatments of Harlem life,
ranging from emotional por
traits of everyday people to
adrenaline-stirring prints of
jazz greats.
The exhibit, on display
at the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art, is a historical
tribute, tracing DeCarava's
50 years of monumental
work and focusing on his
prints from the 19505.
DeCarava's unconven
tional use of limited lighting
and seemingly overexposed
photographs creates rich
landscapes while encourag
ing the viewer to look closer
for subtle detail.
"Couple Talking"
(1952), for example, cap

tures a darkened subway
scene of a couple embracing
inside as the lights of a car
whizzing by illuminate the
soft outlines of their faces.
The print captures a whirl
wind of eros, and the couple's
diverted gazes lend to a
voyeuristically charged mo
ment.
"Window and Stove"
(1952) is another piece that
uses limited lighting to con
jure empathy through stark,
realism. The still-life epito
mizes poverty amid looming
urban terrains by showing a
barren, decrepit kitchen
scene of a kettle on a stove.
Lit by dirty windows, the
scene is closed off from a
sullen world of warehouses.
His more recent still-lifes
are similar to Steiglitz's or
Weston's quintessential
work, except they are laden
with social commentary on
the urban plight of poverty.

"Work Glove 3" (1991) is a
close up of a tattered work
glove, worn down at the fin
gertips. Another portentous
image that evokes the view
er's empathy for hardship is a
profile of a mended shirt with
stitching down the back that
looks like scars and lacera
tions.
DeCarava also uses com
positional lines to evoke feel
ing. "Man Looking in a Pet
Store" (1952) depicts a suited
man's back in the center of
the image, facing a minimal
store front on a barren street.
Surrounded by nothing ex
cept his own image, he is like
a James Baldwin character,
desperately alone, continu
ously aware of it, but some
how cool enough to feign
confidence.
DeCarava is sometimes
playful with structure. In one
print, a lone street sign juts
out in the middle. The only

other element is a man's arm
reaching out and grabbing it.
This kind of ordinary, pass
ing humor, created by com
position, typifies DeCarava's
work. His interests lie in cap
turing the undertones of
everyday interactions among
people and the city's geogra
phy, bus stops, train stations,
and congested streets.
As a native New Yorker,
DeCarava has an urban sen
sibility that resonates
through his work. He por
trays movement — a pianist
playing, people dancing and
cars racing.
He also shows the un
derside — running around
in a money-draining work
horse. The proud, stern ex
pressions in his portraits
convey tenacity amid ram
pant racism.
These images are replete
with emotion in the melan
choly eyes of the people.
