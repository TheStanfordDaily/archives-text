## Take Your Stereotype and Shove It: 
### Karin West Contributing writer 
They sit on the floor in a casual circle, a
group of young Native American women,
chatting comfortably over beautiful pieces of
silver and beaded jewelry. The scene is time
less and could easily have existed hundreds of
years ago. The women are fastening each
other's long, shiny dark hair with beaded bar
rettes, perhaps with a fire flickering in the
background...
"Those look dope," one suddenly ex
claims of another's turquoise earrings.
Welcome to the 20th century, and the
world of the "Night Wind Women."
Next weekend, the Stanford Drama De
partment will present "Night Wind Women,"
a groundbreaking performance piece which
examines the relationships of today's Native
American women and the realities of their
lives.
"Night Wind Women" is the vision of
Tanya Lukin, a member of the Alutiiq tribe in
Alaska. The program uses the words of Native
American women poets to examine issues of
race and gender. The 15 poems that comprise
the play are from the pens of Joy Harjo,
Chrystos, Janice Gould, Marcie Rendon,
Connie Fife, Denise Sweet, Linda Noel and
Lukin herself.
"The play is really all about healing,"
Lukin said. The poems in the first part of the
production deal with fear. "The history of
genocide coming through, and the everyday
struggles of racism and sexism."
Lukin is a senior studying English on a
Mellon Fellowship with a Native American
literature focus, and "Night Wind Women" is
the culmination of her honors tutorial and
fellowship research.
Lukin, who has been involved in several
Stanford drama productions, was urged by
her thesis advisor, English Prof. Robert War
rior, to turn the words of the poets she was
studying into a performance piece. She has
since turned her interest in feminist writings
by women of color into a unique drama of
word, emotion, color and sound.

Noshua Watson, a graduate student in
economics who serves as the show's producer
and assistant director, considers Lukin's work
to be groundbreaking. "This is really exciting
to me, because 1 don't think anything like this
has ever been done at Stanford." Turning po
etry into a performance piece is an amazing
process, she says, and the fact that it is also a
piece about Native American culture makes it
valuable for the entire community. "This is
what Stanford's all about — it's cutting edge."
"The great thing about this compilation
is that there aren't really Native plays out
there, and nothing that is this positive," says
Annette Evans, a junior from Alaska who is
Aleut / Athabaskan. She says the work is
"about family, sexuality, tradition and, as one
of the poems says, 're-igniting the fires within
people.'"
One History, Different Stories
The group of young Native American
women who bring the production to life are
as varied as the play's many themes and voic
es. Although only two of the cast members
have had previous performance experience,
the intensity of their performances and com
mitment suggests otherwise. As the lights
come up on the group's staging of "Coy
otismo,, by Janice Gould, the intensity and
focus in the shining brown eyes of the five ac
tresses are disarming and impressive.
Five of the poems are presented by the
five actresses together. Lukin said she based
the group interpretations on the tradition of
the Greek chorus, "only with a lot more
movement." During the chorus pieces, each
cast member wears a jewel-toned blouse
which she had sewn herself in the Drama De
partment's costume shop. The costumes,
made of a single fabric in five different colors
and styles, reflect a central theme of strong in
dividuality born from a shared history and
background.
One theme reflected by the authors'
words is the shared traumatic history of all
Native American women. Cast member
Wendy Shelly Greyeyes is from Arizona and is
a member of the Din£ tribe. She agrees that

the "angst of being misplaced by the Federal
government and trying to cope with it while
still trying to be mothers, daughters and sis
ters" is an underlying circumstance that ties
Native American women together.
"We are all the same in that we come
from a strong culture that has adapted to the
times," said sophomore cast member Enei Be
gaye, a Din£ / Tohono O'Odham from Ari
zona. "But at the same time, we're all differ
ent; we're not trying to represent all Indians."
Senior Ahtza Chavez, of the Din£ and
Santo Domingo tribes, serves as the Stage and
Technical Manager. She, like Lukin, studies
Native American women's poetry and was in
volved in several Stanford theatrical produc
tions. Chavez appreciates the emphasis the
play gives to the unique historical and spiritu
al background of Native American women
and the acknowledgment that is given to the
"feminine power and strength that comes
from our ancestors."
The production's use of words, move
ment and music also honor the "oral tradi
tion" of most Native American tribes, where
history and knowledge pass through the gen
erations through storytelling and song.
Chavez feels the poems chosen by Lukin "re
ally emphasize the power of speech, the
power of language the power in the words
coming from other women."
Goodbye, Pocahontas
The piece also takes a stab at the stereo
types that still haunt Native Americans, par
ticularly women. Lukin said the play shows
Native American women as people, not as
images taken from a movie screen. She feels
the poems she has chosen to represent this
theme will allow people to "walk away with
the idea that Native women are multiple indi
viduals, not like they're seen on film."
"We're not all raising hell and being
rebels like 'Lakota Woman,' " Greyeyes said.
"We are all just trying to survive — the
woman ends up keeping the family together."
Sophomore Sassa Kitka, who is from
Alaska and of the Tlingit / Alutiiq tribes,
agrees. The piece, she says, conveys themes

sage that, "we're not Pocahontas. We're mod
ernized."
Kitka performs "I Am Not Your
Princess," a piece by Chrystos that rails againt
stereotypes through the voice of a Native
American woman who is cooking in her
kitchen. She cooks fry bread, ironically con
sidered a "traditional" Native American food,
despite its origins in the not-so-traditional
commodity ingredients given to Native
Americans by the federal government nearly
a century ago.
Sexuality and Spirit
Lukin found the issues of sexuality and
identity expressed in the poetic literature that
she studied and uses the poets' words to ex
press the themes in the play. The idea is that
"sex and the spirit are intertwined," she said.
"If you alienate one, then you alienate the
other."
Evans acknowledges that some of the
works presented "may be controversial, as wc
are dealing with sexual issues including ho
mosexuality," but that the over-arching
theme of "reclaiming sexuality" is a very pos
itive one. Begaye presents Chrystos's "O Hon
eysuckle Woman," which describes an impas
sioned, sensuous appreciation of a female
lover.
Greyeyes performs "You See This Body'
by Marcie Rendon, and the poem's biting sar
casm gives the history and experiences be
hind the legs and the buttocks of an objecti
fied woman.
Lukin included the piece to emphasize
the theme of sexuality and the spirit in a pos
itive way. "We have to reclaim our bodies," she
said, "and we have to reclaim our voices."
