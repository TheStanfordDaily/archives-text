Let's be honest — there's a certain appeal
to blasting the limbs off snarling, flesh- eating
space aliens or confronting Mike Tyson in a
test of flying fists. And what about go-cart
racing against a cast of opponents that in
cludes a mushroom, a gorilla and a princess?

Over the course of four years, the typical
Stanford student will undoubtedly try a video
game or two. From the casual player ("I've got
nothing better to do"), to the addict ("Prob

"They HAVE to be multiplayer," said
freshman Jordan Jacobs, "because that's the
whole fun of it."
As of late, many games allow for more
than just head-to-head competition. Ninten
do 64 and Sony Playstation, two of the pre
mier game systems, can accommodate up to
four players at once. The extreme popularity
of both "Mario Kart 64" and "Goldeneye" is
largely due to this four-player option. The
premise of each game is rather simple —
"Mario Kart" is a racing game and "Golden
eye" is a shoot-em-up. Yet beware of flying
egos!
With palpable complacency, sophomore
Jason Cutlip joked, "So you think you can
beat me?"
In bringing together a big group of peo

Nowadays, computer games have anjwl
vantage over console systems in that they can
utilize the Internet for an incredible breadth
of players, experiences, and fun. Perhaps one
of the first games to do this and attract a wide
level of support was "Doom." The concept of
"Doom" is tried-and-true: as the player, you
control a guy with a major attitude problem,
a thirst tor weapons of mass destruction and
a hunger to annihilate space aliens. "Doom"
allows you to play human opponents from
Palo Alto to Paraguay.
A step up from its predecessor, "Woffen
stein 3D," "Doom" forge a path for similar
computer game&like "Heretic" and "Quake."
One of the most popular games right now is
"Quake It* Its formula? Same as the rest, phis
an extensive array of weapons and spectacu
lar graphics.
One drawback to playing games over the
Internet, however, is the lack of real-life inter
action withyour opponent. *
Freshman Laura Brown recognizes the
social value of playing video games with fel
low classmates. When playing alone, Brown
doesn't see how "shooting pixelizeti blips for
hours upon hours could be fun." 1
When you're on the Internet playing
someone in Kentucky, Colorado and
Malaysia, social interaction is definitely lack
ing, freshman Joseph Kugelmass commented
that, as far as social interaction, "Networked
games have the same degraded, hollow inter
action as in a chat room"
However, students said that playing a
video game is a form of entertainment, much
like reading a book, strumming the guitar, or
going to the batting cage to practice your
swing.
The video games of today are bigger than
ever. When asked what their favorite games
are, serious Stanford gamers consistently

point to the same few games. "Final Fantasy
VII," for the Sony Playstation, is being herald
ed as the best Role-Playing Game (RPG) ever.
An RPG is like a digital soap opera with its in
tricate plot and long list of characters. With a
Hollywood-style budget of $45 million,
"Final Fantasy VII" is sure to give players a lot
of bang for their buck.
You could also try your luck at "Myth:
The Fallen Lords," a computer game revolv
ing around both strategy and execution in
war. The networking feature here is especially
appreciated.
If you don't play video games, you may be
feeling a little out of the loop right now.
Aliens, soap operas, guns... this stuff can't be
for real, can it? One question remains to be
answered. Who is actually playing these
games?
I found it to be the case that there are
more guys than girls among the serious game
players. However, many girls I talked to said
that they enjoyed video games, although they
have never owned their own system.
"Video games? Oh yeah, I think my
brother hatf a Nintendo or something, " said
senior Teesha Wallace
Additionally, there remains a latent
stereotype about video games — only dorks
play them. Most people, however, believe that
this myth is fading.
While junior Gordon McNaughton
agrees that he has "never met a dork who
didn't play video games," he believes that
there are many students at Stanford who are
"closet video game addicts*
If you or someone you know is a closet
addict, afraid of ruining hit or her image,
don't lose hope! Ift case you missed the flyers,
there is a new organization on campus.
Founded by freshman Clifford Chao of
Wilbur HalL the Interactive Media Society
(IMS) had their first meeting this past Tues
day to sort out the logistic# of assembling
Stanford's first club for video gamers.
When asked why he organized IMS,
Chao responded, "Every other form of media
is represented bn campus accept for video
games." He is excited to hear member input
and adapt the club as needed.
IMS has three main goals. First, Chao
hopes to provide a great source of entertain
ment for players. He plans to set up tourna
ments within Stanford, as well as arrange
competitions with similar organizations at
other universities. Second, Chao hopes that
sfiMS will boost the image of the video game
indttttry Qocamfnis. Finally, he feels that IMS
should introduce newcomers to the exciting
world of video games.
The hardest part about getting the club
started, IMS treasurer David Weaver noted,
was getting the capital they needed. With the
initial start-up cost (to purchase televisions,
consoles and the like) out of the way, he ex
pects maintenance to be relatively cheap.

Having approached video games solely
from the perspective of players, 1 decided to
look at the industry itself — its greatest suc
cesses, its target audience and its direction. I
headed down to the Computer Science de
partment to ask Professor Terry Winograd
about his opinions on the industry. Wino
grad is currently teaching CS 2478, "Human-
Computer Interaction: Contextual and Orga
nizational Issues."
One of the first things Winograd men
tioned about the industry was what he de
scribed as "the arms race of graphics." As
computers become increasingly powerful, he
envisions future video games to have graphics
similar to those in the movie "Toy Story."
Winograd added, "Of course, better res
olution doesn't make a game inherently more
interesting."
Other Stanford students feel that the em
phasis on graphics will slowly decline, espe
cially once they become photo-realistic and
run in real time.
Can video games excel in anything be
sides graphics? Freshman Andrew Vestal feels
that, "Just like a good movie, a soundtrack
can enhance the quality of a game."
I also asked Winograd about the new em
phasis on multipiayer options in games. He
believes J&at this option will soon become a
standard feature of games because "the limi
tation is connectivity — and connectivity is
going up."
The world of computer marketing is also
undergoing a drastic shift, as companies are
trying to extend their audience. Winograd in
formed me of a new company, "Purple
Moon," which makes video games targeted
for girls ages eight to 12. He had bought a cou
ple of their games to see what they were like,
and he offered me a chance to play one of
t^em.
M Eager to see this company's marketing
strategy, I quickly accepted the offer and
began opening "Rockett's New School,"
which (as the box claimed) gave insight into
the first day in a new school — "Meet cool
friends! Peek into lockers!"
Imagine my surprise when! opened the
box to find, in addition to the compact disc
containing the game, arßockett action figure,
plastic jewelry, trading cards and stickers!
Thk indefinitely the beginning of a new era
in video games. '
Video games have come 4 kmg way. At
Stanford, video games are a great way to have
fun, spend time with friends and disappear
from everything around you. There will al
ways be students who won't appreciate video
games for various reasons, but that won't stop
the rest of campus from enjoying their unique
forms of entertainment They are here to stay.
When I asked junior Robert Bryden to
comment on video game culture here at Stan
ford, he hurriedly responded, "Can't — busy
playing."
Let's be honest — there's a certain appeal
to blasting the limbs off snarling, flesh- eating

"They HAVE to be multiplayer," said
freshman Jordan Jacobs, "because that's the
whole fun of it."
As of late, many games allow for more
than just head-to-head competition. Ninten
do 64 and Sony Playstation, two of the pre
mier game systems, can accommodate up to
four players at once. The extreme popularity
of both "Mario Kart 64" and "Goldeneye" is
largely due to this four-player option. The
premise of each game is rather simple —
"Mario Kart" is a racing game and "Golden
eye" is a shoot-em-up. Yet beware of flying
egos!
With palpable complacency, sophomore
Jason Cutlip joked, "So you think you can

In bringing together a big group of peo

Nowadays, computer games have anjwl
vantage over console systems in that they can
utilize the Internet for an incredible breadth
of players, experiences, and fun. Perhaps one
of the first games to do this and attract a wide
level of support was "Doom." The concept of
"Doom" is tried-and-true: as the player, you
control a guy with a major attitude problem,
a thirst tor weapons of mass destruction and
a hunger to annihilate space aliens. "Doom"
allows you to play human opponents from
Palo Alto to Paraguay.
A step up from its predecessor, "Woffen
stein 3D," "Doom" forge a path for similar
computer game&like "Heretic" and "Quake."
One of the most popular games right now is
"Quake It* Its formula? Same as the rest, phis
an extensive array of weapons and spectacu

One drawback to playing games over the
Internet, however, is the lack of real-life inter
action withyour opponent. *

When you're on the Internet playing

that, as far as social interaction, "Networked

However, students said that playing a
video game is a form of entertainment, much
like reading a book, strumming the guitar, or
going to the batting cage to practice your
swing.
The video games of today are bigger than
ever. When asked what their favorite games
are, serious Stanford gamers consistently

point to the same few games. "Final Fantasy
VII," for the Sony Playstation, is being herald
ed as the best Role-Playing Game (RPG) ever.
An RPG is like a digital soap opera with its in
tricate plot and long list of characters. With a
Hollywood-style budget of $45 million,
"Final Fantasy VII" is sure to give players a lot
of bang for their buck.
You could also try your luck at "Myth:
The Fallen Lords," a computer game revolv
ing around both strategy and execution in
war. The networking feature here is especially
appreciated.
If you don't play video games, you may be
feeling a little out of the loop right now.
Aliens, soap operas, guns... this stuff can't be
for real, can it? One question remains to be
answered. Who is actually playing these
games?
I found it to be the case that there are
more guys than girls among the serious game
players. However, many girls I talked to said
that they enjoyed video games, although they
have never owned their own system.
"Video games? Oh yeah, I think my
brother hatf a Nintendo or something, " said
senior Teesha Wallace
Additionally, there remains a latent
stereotype about video games — only dorks
play them. Most people, however, believe that
this myth is fading.
While junior Gordon McNaughton
agrees that he has "never met a dork who
didn't play video games," he believes that
there are many students at Stanford who are
"closet video game addicts*
If you or someone you know is a closet
addict, afraid of ruining hit or her image,
don't lose hope! Ift case you missed the flyers,
there is a new organization on campus.
Founded by freshman Clifford Chao of
Wilbur HalL the Interactive Media Society
(IMS) had their first meeting this past Tues
day to sort out the logistic# of assembling
Stanford's first club for video gamers.
When asked why he organized IMS,
Chao responded, "Every other form of media
is represented bn campus accept for video
games." He is excited to hear member input
and adapt the club as needed.
IMS has three main goals. First, Chao
hopes to provide a great source of entertain
ment for players. He plans to set up tourna
ments within Stanford, as well as arrange
competitions with similar organizations at
other universities. Second, Chao hopes that
sfiMS will boost the image of the video game
indttttry Qocamfnis. Finally, he feels that IMS
should introduce newcomers to the exciting
world of video games.
The hardest part about getting the club
started, IMS treasurer David Weaver noted,
was getting the capital they needed. With the
initial start-up cost (to purchase televisions,
consoles and the like) out of the way, he ex
pects maintenance to be relatively cheap.

Having approached video games solely
from the perspective of players, 1 decided to
look at the industry itself — its greatest suc
cesses, its target audience and its direction. I
headed down to the Computer Science de
partment to ask Professor Terry Winograd
about his opinions on the industry. Wino
grad is currently teaching CS 2478, "Human-
Computer Interaction: Contextual and Orga
nizational Issues."
One of the first things Winograd men
tioned about the industry was what he de
scribed as "the arms race of graphics." As
computers become increasingly powerful, he
envisions future video games to have graphics
similar to those in the movie "Toy Story."
Winograd added, "Of course, better res
olution doesn't make a game inherently more
interesting."
Other Stanford students feel that the em
phasis on graphics will slowly decline, espe
cially once they become photo-realistic and
run in real time.
Can video games excel in anything be
sides graphics? Freshman Andrew Vestal feels
that, "Just like a good movie, a soundtrack
can enhance the quality of a game."
I also asked Winograd about the new em
phasis on multipiayer options in games. He
believes J&at this option will soon become a
standard feature of games because "the limi
tation is connectivity — and connectivity is
going up."
The world of computer marketing is also
undergoing a drastic shift, as companies are
trying to extend their audience. Winograd in
formed me of a new company, "Purple
Moon," which makes video games targeted
for girls ages eight to 12. He had bought a cou
ple of their games to see what they were like,
and he offered me a chance to play one of
t^em.
M Eager to see this company's marketing
strategy, I quickly accepted the offer and
began opening "Rockett's New School,"
which (as the box claimed) gave insight into
the first day in a new school — "Meet cool
friends! Peek into lockers!"
Imagine my surprise when! opened the
box to find, in addition to the compact disc
