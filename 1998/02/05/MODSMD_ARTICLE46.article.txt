## Jake Kasdan's first film cracks a good case 
### Catherine Quinones Staff writer 
The keys to a wealthy man's safety deposit
box disappear and the next thing he knows,
he's being blackmailed. Sounds like a case for
Daryl Zero (Bill Pullman), the best gumshoe in
the world.
The thing is, Gregory Stark (Ryan

O'Neal), the
wealthy timber ty
coon, won't reveal
what's in the safety
deposit box. He
also never meets
the detective who is
working for him.
Daryl Zero is not
your ordinary de
tective. He's not
your ordinary any
thing.
With a hip
whodunit called
"Zero Effect," first
time movie direc
tor lake Kasdan has
revived the detec
tive mystery. But
the biggest mystery
in this movie is not
the case — it's the
detective. He's a
strange bird — he's
so detached from

the world that he's induced an inhuman abili
ty for observation. This ability is the key to his
success. But his success comes at a cost: his
keen abilities for observation result in his be
coming a recluse and an eccentric tunafish
eating, sleep-deprived, socially inept person.
"I wanted to write a detective story," Kas
dan explained to Intermission. "That's the
kind of story that I've always liked and re
sponded to ... What was a way to personalize
this kind of story? I came up with an uncon
ventional hero — a miserable, incredibly with
drawn hero who develops an acute, powerful

sense in one area and is struggling to get along
in the rest."
Kasdan honed his writing skills early on
— only 22 when he directed this film, he wrote
and directed four plays right out of high school
before spending a year and a half writing "Zero
Effect." He said that he sees himself in Daryl
Zero.
"That's part of why I wrote it," Kasdan
said. "I'm probably not the only one who

doesn't know what
you're like when you
leave the house, and you
think maybe it would be
better not to leave the
house."
Kasdan said that he
identifies himself more
as a writer because he's
spent more time writing
than he has directing.
Directing, he says, is a
"natural extension of
storytelling."
Comparing him
self to Zero, Kasdan said,
"As a writer, you spend a
lot of time indoors and
you feel like you're al
ways watching and
never participating."
Kasdan said that
he's the only one »vho
wrote "Zero Effect," and
in the land of Holly
wood — the land of

rewrites and ghostwriters — it's not always the
case that only one writer's mind and hands
touch the script. But why not let someone else
direct his script? "I'm the only one who knew
how it played in my head," Kasdan explained.
So how does a 22-year-old get to direct his
own script and get Bill Pullman and Ben Stiller
— who plays Zero's libidinous sidekick and
frontnian Steve Arlo — to star?
"1 wrote the screenplay and started send
ing it to people. Actors, directors, produc
ers. . explained Kasdan. "It took nine
months. Eventually, 1 ended up with enough

people interested in it." And a feature film was
born.
Kasdan stated adamantly that his young
age is not an advantage in Hollywood. "Occa
sionally it's a disadvantage. Maybe it turns peo
ple off. Sometimes they ask, "Aren't you a bit
young for this?"'
Another factor that might be working for
Kasdan is the very large shadow his father's ca
reer casts. Jake Kasdan is the son of Lawrence
Kasdan, the Hollywood great who's written
screenplays for "Star Wars," "Return of the
ledi" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The senior
Kasdan also produced, directed and wrote the
screenplay for the Academy Award-winning
film "The Accidental Tourist."
It's a tough pedigree to follow, but the
younger Kasdan is off to an early start. He
spoke enthusiastically about his father and

identifies him as an in
spiration. He said he
learned some of what
he knows about film
making just from being
around it all his life.
The rest he learned on
the set.
Kasdan admits
that if he had known at
the start of production
what he knows now,
the film would have
turned out differently.
But this first-time film
maker is very proud of
his work. "The film is a

representation of the best I was capable of at
the time, given the limitations of my skills and
talent."
Limitations aside, "Zero Effect" is fun to
watch. Humor mixes with empathy for the
protagonist, preventing the audience from
feeling downright sorry for him. Acting out a
conventional and old-fashioned character
with unconventional personality issues, Pull
man produces a memorable performance. As
Arlo, a man torn between his work and his
love-life, Stiller is perfect — but the suits he has
to wear don't do much for him — the poor guy

has no neck! Kim Dickens, as Gloria, the love
interest, displays the right amount of interest
and hesitation towards Zero.
Yup, Zero, the ultimate in detachment,
hence the ultimate non commitment type,
falls in love with Gloria, a pretty paramedic
who he meets while conducting an investiga
tion at a health club. Throughout the film, he
returns to the health club many times, suppos
edly to work on his investigation. Or is it be
cause of his attraction to Gloria?
"It's a detective story and a love story," ex
plained Kasdan. "It's about a detective trying
to figure out the answers to a whole bunch of
different kinds of mysteries. It's a whodunit as
much as it's about how to be with a girl and
how to function in the world."
Kasdan's film blends romance with mys
tery: it's cute without being too cute and sexy

without being
gratuitous. And
of course, the ro
mance gets en
tangled up with
Zero's case, pre
senting him with
a problem that he
previously has
never had to face
before: balancing
relationships
with work.
It's an old
story with a mod
ern twist — an

atypical hero with
common contemporary problems like an in
ability to commit, a lack of social prowess and
general confusion who tries to find the right
balance for things in life. Kasdan may be
young, but "Zero Effect" shows that he is not
short on understanding something about the
human condition.
Making "Zero Effect" was an exhausting
experience for Kasdan, who is taking a break
from screenwriting and filmmaking. But the
storyteller in him will not let him rest for long.
"Eventually I'll have to break down and write
another script."
