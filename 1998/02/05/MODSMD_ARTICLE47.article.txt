Mark Knopfler of Dire
Straites fame composed and
performed everything on this
CD. His gruff voice is familiar
and pleasing because it re
minds one of Dire Straites.
The theme song is the first
track and the lyrics are quirky,
using phrases like, "funky
chicken," "mashed potato" and

"monkey in the storm." This
would be funnier if it weren't
for the fact that the music is so
catchy. The accordion in the
background could be corny,
but somehow the balance be
tween the lyrics and the accor
dion is harmonious and pos
sesses a wholeness that one can
appreciate without sarcasm.
The second track and the
rest of the album are purely
acoustic save for a few chords
on the third track. The second
half of the song evokes the
Grateful Dead as the music
surges in and out in a series of
crescendos.
The guitar solo's energy
and groove is like an old pair of
pajamas, vaguely familiar and
comfortable.
The third track is probably
the strongest. The guitar piece
is a good combination of tangi
ness and tranquillity.
Track No. 4 expresses the
Chris Isaac in Mark Knopfler.
There is a western edge which
corresponds well to the title of
the song "An American Hero."
He evokes images of wide open
spaces and the stereotypical
Heartland.
A hint of European flavor
is prevalent throughout track
No. 5. There is a fast-paced

back beat that could almost be
Italian folk music. The final
chords end quickly with a sub
tle but dramatic finale that dif
fers considerably from his
other pieces. It is more fun and
sillier than the rest of the
album. His perverse wit makes
it a tad more exciting.
The piece "Stretching Out"

was mellow but had no distin
guishable caliber. It was there
— it just existed like an amoe
ba. But with a name such as
this, what more can you ex
pect?
Track No. 7, "Drooling Na
tional," has the most intriguing
title in the entire album. The
music doesn't disappoint. A
wonderful hodgepodge of
banjo flavor and jumpy guitar
revive some juice into the final
songs of the soundtrack.
The final piece, "We're
Going to War," also adds a new
twist. This track is just more
rock and roll. It is much
rougher. The guitar increases
in amplitude, and a stronger
back beat augments the power
of the piece.
Not necessarily the most
appealing piece but definitely
another solid effort.
The subtlety and complex
ity of Mark Knopfler's album is
not initially apparent.
His experimentation with
different styles and beats cre
ates a group of songs cautious
ly diverse enough to appeal to a
wide range of tastes. The
album's tranquillity and spice
make it much more investing
than average.
