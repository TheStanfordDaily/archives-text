## A 						Little Bit of Country WHISKEYTOWN 
### 
I used to hate country music. The very
sound of a steel guitar was enough to make me
cringe. In retrospect, I realize that I didn't hate
the music — I hated the culture: John Denver's
endless series of insipid Christmas specials,
Kenny Roger's smugly-trimmed beard, Dolly
Parton's miracle-of-modern-technology body,
and songs with titles like Hal Smith's "I Got a
Stomach Full of Chitlins and a Bellyful of You."
Garth Brooks' inexplicable ascent to a level of
popularity akin only to Elvis and the Beatles
made things worse as country's '90s "revival"
had all the integrity of that of 70s "rockers" like
Rod Stewart.
Thus, when 1 entered Stanford, I was fully
confident in my belief that country music was
the nadir of American music. However, as my
musical tastes grew, I kept discovering that a
number of my favorite artists (the Rolling
Stones, Bruce Springsteen, the Byrds, the Velvet
Underground, Neil Young, even Elvis Costello)
had recorded music that sounded like country
to my untrained ear.
Moreover, their performances sounded
great, which meant 1 either had to accept coun
try as music or fascistly reject it.
I chose the former and now receive con
fused stares from other students who pass my
room as I blast Patsy Cline and lohnny Cash.
Indeed, Stanford's elitist disdain for country
music is unfortunate, as that prejudice blinds
many people to some of the great country
music oeing made today. Dwight Yoakam,

Maria McKee, Steve Earle and the Cowboy
Junkies have all made music as diverse and in
spired as R.E.M., Counting Crow, Oasis or any
other "college" band.
Two brilliant new albums, Whiskeytown's
"Strange's Almanac" and Wayne Hancock's
"That's What Daddy Wants," continue this
trend.
Whiskeytown clearly derives from the al
ternative-country movement started by Gram
Parsons in the early '70s and most recendy
mined successfully by Uncle Tupelo, the Bottle
Rockets and Wilco.
At its best, Whiskeytown's music main
tains a country aesthetic while packing the dra
matic punch of Memphis soul creating an im
pressive combination.
Led by guitarist / vocalist David Ryan
Adams, the Texan quintet hits their mark every
time, making remarkably assured music. The
song writing is remarkably consistent as Adams
provides 13 powerful tracks with no filler.
The ballads, such as "Turn Around," are
gorgeous studies in the resonant beauty of
country music. With "Waiting To Derail," the
band proves that they are capable of executing
equally compelling rockers.
"Yesterday's News" sounds like the perfect
country-rock crossover with plaintive vocals,
crunchy guitars and a charging beat. This
three-minute gem deserves to be playing on
every radio in the country.
Moreover, on experimental tracks like

"Not Home Anymore," the group shows a will
ingness to push the limits of their genre, with
no poorer results. The song's climax provides a
perfect ending for the album, resilient and de
spairing.
I hesitate to call this album a "master
piece," but "Stranger's Almanac" is clearly one
of the two or three best albums 1 have reviewed
during my four years with Intermission.
