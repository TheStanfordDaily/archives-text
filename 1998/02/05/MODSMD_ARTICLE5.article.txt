## 
### Lauren Phillips 
As the winter quarter begins, stu
dents facing charges in violation of
the Honor Code or the Fundamen
tal Standard will he tried under the
newly reformed judicial system.
The judicial charter, which was
rewritten by a group of students, fac
ulty and administrators under Uni
versity President Gerhard C asper's
commission last year, now incorpo
rates students more fully into the
University's judicial process. Signif
icant reforms were made in the ad
ministrative and structural compo
nents of the system.
"The charter dix.*s three main
things — it sets up an administrative
framework, establishes judicial in

stitutions and guarantees certain
rights to the students involved in the
judicial process." said former ASSI
Senator Howard Loo. who was part
of the Committee of 15 that rewrote
the charter last year.
His main concern as a student
representative on the committee
v/as to make sure that students were
more extensively involved in the en
tire judicial process.
Under the new system, the ad
ministrative process has been
changed to accommodate two posi
tions — the judicial officer and the
judicial adviser Hie new ludicial of
ficer. Suzanne Mak. was chosen in
Januarv and functions as an investi
gator Idi eases that arc expected to
go to trial. Hei position has been
limited to these functions in order
prevent the previous conflicts ot
ijrterest. 1 am Irving to leatn all ol
A different angles of the story,"
Mak said.
I he judicial adviser. Jennilci
I erkins. runs the day to day tunc
lions of the department, which in
eludes advising students and pro
fessors involved in the process and
making sure that all ol the judicial
I anels are staffed.
"My hope will be that the new
position will make students, faculty
find staff more comfortable to have
someone neutral to come to.
Perkins said.
- Dean ol Students Marc Wais
commented that the expansion of
the judicial affairs stall will allow for
improved training of faculty, staff
and students, educational outreach
and implementation ol the process.
Sti uctural changes to the sy stem
were also extensive. I he new Board
ol Judicial Affairs serves as the
main policy-making body and will
meet regulai ly to monitor the elTec
i ivencss and implementation of the

ch.nter. I he board is comprised of
six students, six faculty members
and three administrators I hey will
pass legislation <»i change rules as
necessary, lach of these positions
will change annually.
Although the hoard, as the main
policy making institution, has the
powei to make mles on charter re
form. it receives oversight from the
\SSI Senate, the Faculty Senate
and the ()11 ice of the President.
A rule that meets objection from
any of these three organizations is
considered \oid until all three
groups can analyze and determine
the validity of the rule.
Lite second and third elements
ol the sti uctural changes are the ex
istence of a judicial panel pool and
the judicial panel. I he panel pool is
a group ol students and faculty from
which the panels are selected. At
present. Mak said, orientations of
the panel pool are taking place and
the panels will be selected over the
next couple ol weeks.
I he judicial panels are com
prised of four students and two
members ol the faculty or staff. The
panel is the "central decision-mak
ing body.' I oo said. "They decide
the facts, guilt and punishment" of
the cases brought forth.
Wais. Zobaek and Loo empha

sized the new and important role
that students play in judicial affairs
on campus.
" I he Honor Code is something
by and for the students," Zoback
said. "If they aren't included in the
[judicial] process, they won't take it
seriously.
" The power really resides within
the students ... We hope that stu
dents will embrace the system and
really take pride in it," Zoback said.
Those cases that were brought
before the board prior to winter
quarter will be tried under the pre
vious system. "At this point, the dif
ficult thing is juggling both systems
side by side." Mak said.
Although no cases have gone
through the new system, all in
volved seem to be hopeful that the
system will turn out to be the best
judicial process for the Stanford
community.
"We really hope that the reforms
will reinforce the importance of the
Honor Code and the Fundamental
Standard and integrate them into
the very fabric of the campus life."
Wais said.
"They reflect the values and
principles of Stanford University
and ... insure the academic integri
ty of each Stanford course and each
Stanford degree."
