# WAYNE HANCOCK

### 
Wayne Hancock's new album, howev
er, might be even better. "That's What
Daddy Wants" displays an acute awareness
for country's long history. Hancock's stud
ied vocals recall the sound of Jimmie
Rodgers, the original country yodeler him
self. The music itself— centering around a
slapping bass line and acoustic guitars re
veals a facility for rockabilly, and the
prominent steel guitar gives the album a
contemporary flavor.
On tracks like "Misery" and "Life On
The Road," Hancock delivers confident
performances which sound both tradition
al and contemporary. "Johnny Law" is an
organic, Chuck Berry-inspired rocker, re
minding the audience that "Maybelline"
was originally a country song called "Ida
Red."
Further, Hancock resurrects a long-for
gotten connection between country and big
band swing. Inserting the drum-line from
"Sing Sing Sing" into the title track, the ex
periment sounds less like a reclamation pro

ject and more like a cal] to revolution.
The album's best moment comes with
a meltdown performance of Vince Taylor's
obscure rocker "Brand New Cadillac." The
ensemble is so tight that the band sounds
ready to explode.
Indeed, Hancock's version actually
overpowers the Clash's cover from "Lon
don Calling," making one wonder exactly
what Wayne Hancock can't do.
Nonetheless, "That's What Daddy
Wants" is not for the faint of heart. Han
cock's voice will sound downright ugly to
ears weaned on the syrupy nonsense of Ce
line Dion and Toni Braxton.
While Whiskeytown's "Stranger's Al
manac" should appeal to anyone with ears,
Wayne Hancock is something of an ac
quired taste. However, if you want music
which will challenge your notion of the
imagined boundaries separating country
music from Stanford's accepted version of
popular music, look no further.
