# HEPCAT
## 
### 
The third wave has arrived. Too bad.
It's not ska, it's not reggae and it's certainly
not jazz. But Hepcat's latest, "Right On Time,"
tries to be all of those without finding its niche
anywhere.
The defining characteristic of this album is
self-indulgence. Hepcat claims to be "rudeboys"
without understanding that what that name de
fines is a way of life and not just a musical sensi
bility. Not to mention that Hepcat replaces true
rudeboy dancehall melodies and vocals with
watered-down, Motown-bred R&B.
The ego gratification starts with the first
cut, the title track, which is a telephone answer
ing machine message that talks about how "the
Hepcats are right on time." Sorry, but when a
band mentions its own name in the title track of
an album, I automatically deduct points.
Most of the album attempts to fuse jazz and
reggae into a leviathan of horn-led sound that is
barely mobile. The poppy "I Can't Wait" ap
proaches traditional East coast ska but doesn't
get there, while "Goodbye Street" is a sparse,
2tone midtempo snoozer.
It seems that Hepcat just couldn't decide on
a coherent musicality when it made this album.
"Nigel" is a big band number with interesting

Chubby Checkerish vocals, but grating reggae
undertones obscure the excellent jazz. Likewise.
"Together Someday" blends 1930s doo-wop
swing with mundane reggae rhythms, and the
result is not that interesting.
There are some good things going on in this
album. The three instrumental tracks
"Pharaoh's Dream," "Tommy's Song" and
"Baby Blues" are loungy jazz tracks that show
case the sometimes superb musicalitv of the
band.
But those tunes become frustrating indica
tors of Hepcat's unrealized potential under the
crushing mass of inane breakbeat tracks.
Moreover. Hepcat chose to package the
album in an annoving retro-shtick style that
communicates nothing about the band itself.
But 1 guess it's more ego-stroking — as if the
tunes "Rudies All Around" and "Open Season..
. Is Closed" weren't standard, dare 1 say, banal at
tempts to recapture the spirit of long since past
2tone.
Hepcat tries, and I give them credit for that.
It's just that this protect doesn't reallv succeed
Maybe it'll stick to instrumental the next time
around.
