## "Desperate Measures" breaks the chains 
### 
"Desperate Measures," a new film by
Barbet Schroeder starring Andy Garcia and
Michael Keaton, is an action-packed pro
duction from start to finish. While the
screenplay is based on an unlikely sequence
of events, the events are coherent enough to
form a solid story that doesn't require des
perate measures to retain the audience's at
tention.
Frank Connor (Garcia) is a San Fran
cisco police officer who lives to uphold the
law. However, when his young son Matt
(Joseph Cross) is diagnosed with leukemia,
his top priority becomes finding a bone
marrow donor who can save Matt's life.
As it turns out, the only person with
DNA suitable for the transplant is Peter
McCabe, a sociopathic killer who is serving
a life sentence (Keaton).
While McCabe appears to consent to
the surgery in order to receive redemption
for all his previous crimes, he really has ul
terior motives.
After an ingeniously orchestrated es
cape from the operating room, McCabe
starts ravaging the hospital, which happens
to be connected to a prison ward via a
pedestrian bridge. While the entire San
Francisco Police Department's goal is to

eliminate McCabe as soon
as possible, Connor is ac
tually trying to save him
because bone marrow
from a dead man is worth
less.
Connor figures that
the only way McCabe will
survive is if he helps him
escape the hospital. The
unlikely partnership be
tween Connor and Mc-
Cabe and the interesting
hospital / prison setting
are the two elements that
make this film so much
fun.
Naturally, these two
elements alone do not
make an action movie and
even though the scenes in
the hospital include every
thing ranging from gun
fights to hostage situa
tions, the movie would
not have been complete
without a thrilling car
chase.

In one particularly spectacular scene,
Connor jumps his police car over the medi
an on Flighway 101 and has to drive back
wards to avofd a collision with a trailer that
is sliding right at him.
The characters in this movie were well

developed. Both the antagonist and protag
onist invoke strong feelings of compassion
because so much depends on their success.
Both men's actions are driven by despera
tion, as each one is fighting for someone's
life. Both Garcia and Keaton play their re

spective parts very convincingly.
"Desperate Measures" is a sensible
movie pick if you are looking for action that
is nicely packaged with an unusual story.
Not too bad for a measly

Andy Garcia looks deep into the eyes of a killer. "Yes," he thinks to himself, "those are eyes."
