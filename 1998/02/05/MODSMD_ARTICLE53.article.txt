Imagine "Alien" invading
"Titanic" ... tf you think this
might be a fun or interesting
combination, "Deep Rising" will
be just your type of film. While it
offers nothing new plotwise, the
visual effects are truly stunning,
and the action is nonstop.

There is really nothing to the
story of "Deep Rising" that
hasn't been told before. Just like
in "Alien," some people are stuck
in a remote location with a
seemingly invincible monster
that's picking them off one by
one. As for comparing it to "Ti

tanicthe only similarity is that
the events occur on a really big
cruise-ship.
The story begins as the
newest and most state-of-the-art
cruise ship sets sail on the South
China Sea. When a traitor from
among the crew shuts off all

power, the ship loses its commu
nication systems and starts float
ing helplessly on the South
China Sea. Unfortunately for the
passengers, the ship stalls right
above the location that is home
to a bored sea monster that
needs a new toy.

Shortly after the attack
by the sea monster, a band
of gunrunners with the in
tention of hijacking the
ship arrive on board to find
that only three people have
survived the slaughter: the
captain (Derrick O'Con
nor), the ship's owner (An
thony Heald), and a con
woman named Trillian
(Famke Janssen) who was
locked upjn the galley be
cause tried to rob
the vault.
The antagonism be
tween the stereotypical
macho males stranded on
the cruise ship is fun to
watch; not only must they
all try to survive the mon
ster, but they must also sur
vive their trigger-happy

companions. The developing
love story between tough guy
Finnegan (Treat Williams) and
Trillian, the woman who tries to
act as tough as her male counter
parts, is perhaps the most tired
part of the film.
Thanks to the spectacular
visual effects, "Deep Rising"
rises far above mediocrity. The
monster is elaborately developed
and its victims are portrayed in
gory detail.
The director wasn't shy
about showing the monster in all
its glory, another indication that
this film relies on strong visuals
rather than suggestion to fright
en its audience.
In a superb scene, Trillian
and Finnigan race a wave runner
through the ship's narrow pas
sages, trying to escape the
clutches of the monster.
While "Deep Rising" relies
on a somewhat tired storyline,
the visuals are so exciting that its
few shortcomings did not really
matter.
