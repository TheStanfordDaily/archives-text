## Just as we expected

What's so great about "Great Expecta
tions?" The previews promised a lot: a story
based more or less on the Charles Dickens
novel, with lots of intrigue, romance and
visual artistry. 1 was happy to see that the
film delivered it all.
"Great Expectations" follows Finnegan
Bell (Ethan Hawke) as he makes his re
markable journey toward manhood. Aban
doned by his immediate family, Finn is
raised by his "Uncle" Joe (Chris Cooper), a
poor fisherman in a small town in Florida.
Finn enjoys drawing and painting, but
these interests are nothing more than hob
bies.
His life changes when he is discovered
by Nora Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft), a
wealthy woman who has gone crazy and left
her mansion to rot after being left at the
altar in her youth. Ms. Dinsmoor has Finn

come every week to entertain her and spend
time with her niece, Estella (Gwyneth Pal
trow).
Under Ms. Dinsmoor's supervision,
Finn learns to dance with Estella and paints
portraits of her. This leads him to fall in
love not only with Estella, but with her rich
way of life. When Estella moves to New
York, he takes the opportunity to follow
her.
A mysterious benefactor pays for Finn
to move to the city, furnish a studio and set
up his first art show. He crosses paths with
Estella only to find that she has a new love
interest, the well-to-do Walter Plane (Hank
Azaria). He also runs into Lustig (Robert
DeNiro), an escaped convict whom Finn
had helped as a boy.
It's not quite the Dickens novel; in the
'90s, "Finn" is an easier name to swallow
than "Pip." But as reviewer James Berar
dinelli notes, it retains all of the strong plot
elements in a modern interpretation, much
as "Clueless" successfully modernized Jane
Austen's "Emma."

Hawke's character is sufficiently
"mousy" as he moves through the
maze, unaware that he's being pushed.
Paltrow is downright icy as Estella, the
snake that has been trained carefully
by the bitter Ms. Dinsmoor. And
Dinsmoor herself is played charming
ly by Bancroft, an Academy Award
winner.
The real power of "Great Expecta
tions" comes from the creative minds
behind the camera. Director Alfonso
Cuar6n captivates the audience, mak
ing things unpredictable for everyone
who hasn't read the book. The cine
matographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, has
also done a spectacular job. Even a
house overrun with grime and weeds
and a dirty subway train in New York
manage to look beautiful.
"Great Expectations" proves how
timeless a good story can be. It's a ter
rific romance movie — just in time for
Valentine's Day.
