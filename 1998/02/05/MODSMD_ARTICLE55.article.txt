"Replacement
Killers" is bad, really
bad. It is bad because it
is boring. It is bad, bad,
bad. It had no point.
In case my point is

escaping you, this film contains six
long gun fights and only the most
basic dialogue. I'm still trying to fig
ure out the theme.
To be fair to the people who
made this film (surprisingly, that
would include John Woo who made
"Broken Arrow" and "Face / Off'), I
will go into some more detail about
why I feel this way about "Replace
ment Killers."
Here's the story in a nutshell:
John Lee (Chow) is an assassin for a
Chinese crime lord named Terence
Wei (Kenneth Tsang). Lee's only
reason for being in this profession is
that Wei has gained control over his
family, and he is threatening to kill
them if Lee doesn't obey his orders.
Lee has no problem killing a few
bad guys, but when he is ordered to
kill the child of a police detective,
Lee decides to quit. He now must get
to his family as soon as possible, if he
is going to save them from Wei.
While picking up his fake Chinese
passport from a forgery artist named
MegCoburn (Mira Sorvino), there

placement killers assigned to kill Lee
bust in. Miraculously, Coburn and
Lee escape unharmed. For no partic
ular reason, Lee takes Coburn
hostage. Then Coburn inexplicably
falls in love with Lee. Together, they
go on a seemingly endless quest to
kill Wei.
While Lee's weapon of choice is
the Beretta, Wei's men prefer auto
matic assault rifles. In my ignorance,
I thought that the automatic gun
would be the more effective weapon,
but after seeing "Replacement
Killers," I stand corrected.
Apparently, Lee can dispose of a
small army of automatic gun- wield
ing villains using just two handguns.
Maybe it's his snazzy spinning move
that confuses his opponents — or
maybe his killers iust get too caught
up looking at the provocatively
dressed Coburn.
The dialogue was just as unin
spired as the numerous gun battles.
For example, when Coburn tells Lee
that she does not want him to go
back to China, he replies, "1 will miss
you."
Overall, I would say that "Re
placement Killers" deserves to be the
first nominee for worst film of 1998.
