So you're standing in the corner drug
store and you're looking at the condom dis
play. If you're in the right sort of place,
they'll actually have a nice selection on dis
play and you can finger all the packages and
debate the relative merits of ribbed-for
her-pleasure vs. studded.
You're laughing at the boxes — the
tastefully silhouetted hetero couple a chaste
few inches away from each other — and you
spot the Reality Female Condom box be
cause it looks like a tampon box: pink, pur
ple and white with "art" that looks like
somebody did it with a paintbrush. The Re
ality brand is pretty much the only kind
you're going to find.
You're standing there and thinking
about how one company seems to have cor
nered this particular market and you're
noticing something: For about $10 you can
get 12 top-of-the-!ine male condoms,
ribbed and lubed and the whole nine yards,
or you can get a box of Realities. Three of
them.
You will curse the harsh realities of mo
nopoly economics and you will rail against
the unjust society that allows this price dis
crepancy, but if you're like me you will
eventually fork over the money for the Re
alities, grumbling all the way.
So you get home with the goods and
you're ready to try them. You read in the di
rections which tell you that "Reality can be
inserted up to eight hours before sex" and
that "it's important to practice putting Re

ality in without having sex."
So you take one of your purchases, you
find a secluded spot and here, my dear, your
problems begin anew.
It's sometimes a little hard to get a grip
on the condom. They're little polyurethane
pouches with flexible plastic rings on each
end, and they come drenched in lubricant.
The ring at the closed end isn't actually at
tached to the condom at all — it's just stuck
inside it.
So it's highly possible that the firm
grasping and bending the instructions re
quire will cause that second ring to squirt

out of the condom and skid
across the floor of the bath
room, forcing you to answer
some potentially dicey ques
tions.
It may be a pain, but it's nol
impossible.

You're going to have to do some shov
ing to get it in there, and some poking to
ensure proper placement — the inside ring
needs to be wedged between your cervix
and your pubic bone to hold the whole ap
paratus in there.
Sounds kind of uncomfortable, doesn't
it?
It probably won't spoil the moment if
you're having fun, but you won't want to
walk around wearing it for eight hours.
And it doesn't help that there are sever
al inches of condom that dangle outside of
you. Women who don't wear underwear
won't find the dangling too annoying. As
for the rest of us .. . oh, well.

So here you are, all set up, and you have
a few hours to kill until... well, you know.
What are you going to do? It might be best
if you sat still for awhile (since the less you
squirm, the easier it is to forget that you
have a mutant cousin of a Ziplock bag stuck
inside you).
God help you if you have to pee.
Now then, let's skip all the boring an
ticipation and cut right to the chase. You're
finally getting down to business — now
what?
Well. Reality is not snug-fitting latex
like the male condom. It's a plastic pouch

that really does bear a striking
resemblance to a sandwich bag.
And so it makes those same
sandwich bag noises when you
move, unless you use enough
lubricant to float a cruise ship.
The noise is a minor irri-

tant compared to the resi of the gymnastics
necessary for proper use. The directions
recommend holding the outer ring in place
with one hand and using the other hand to
guide the penis in the proper direction, lest
the penis slip to one side or the outer ring of
the condom slip inside you (a common
problem that isn't surprising given all the
lubricant down there).
And supposing you've had intercourse
but you're not done playing? The newest
"Our Bodies, Our Selves" reports that Real
ity lubricant has a less-than-gourmet taste,
a statement that remains unchecked by me
but that is believable given that it smells like
a chemical plant. In these modern days of

flavored dental dams and edible panties, is
it too demanding to ask for something less
noxious?
In all seriousness, though, the biggest
drawback of the female condom is what
happens after all the mess and hassle. Of
100 women using Reality, 18-25 will get
pregnant or contract a sexually transmitted
disease.
Granted, this is with "typical use"
(meaning sometimes you don't use it prop
erly, and maybe once you forget), but even
with perfect use the Reality failure rate (5
percent) is almost twice as high as the fail
ure rate for male condoms (3 percent).
And that's the problem with Reality. It's
being touted as empowering. Cheap con
traception and STD protection for women!
But it's more expensive than male con
doms, less comfortable and less effective.
It's 75 percent to 82 percent better than
nothing, but why use such a product when
the other option is so much better?
"Our Bodies, Our Selves" calls it an al
ternative for women whose partners can't
sustain an erection while putting on a male
condom or who refuse to wear condoms.
Now, I understand the first reason — you'll
get nothing but sympathy from me. But the
second — how empowering can Reality be,
if it enables us to have sex with someone
who doesn't respect us enough to wear a
condom himself?
I love the idea of Reality, I honestly do.
But faced with, well, the real thing, I have to
say I'll take the male version — or just stick
with fantasy.
