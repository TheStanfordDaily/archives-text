## 
### Julia Beeson Contributing writer 
This spring, the Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics, operating within the
Music Department, is offering a
new course: Music "Work
shop in Popular Music Arranging."
Modeled after the workshop
format of the popular fiction writ
ing course of the English Depart
ment, the new music class will
allow students with divergent mu
sical tastes to gain hands-on expe
rience in the arrangement of pop
music.
The new class will be led by
Daniel Levitin and Jay Kadis, both
lecturers in the Music Department.
Levitin and Kadis have extensive
backgrounds in the music industry
and say they are eager to help de
velop the music skill of students.
"We want to see students think
more seriously about arranging,
about presenting popular music
songs in creative and imaginative
ways," Levitin said.
As producer and arranger for
Columbia Records during the
IMStK and president of the label
from WHS to IWM. Levitin has

worked in various capacities with
such well-known musicians as the
Grateful Dead, Santana, Joe Satri
ani. Blue Oyster Cult and Chris
Isaak. He also arranged and
recorded material, as well as
played guitar for Whitney Hous
ton's band.
Kadis has recorded nearly 15 al
bums for several independent
artists. He currently plays, writes
and performs rock music with the
band Offbeats. He has been work
ing at the computer research cen
ter at Stanford for over 10 years.
The class will focus on the vari
ous technicalities of musical
arrangement such as deciding what
instruments will be in a song, what
notes each instrument w ill play and
the number of verses before a re
frain.
According to Levitin, the new
course illustrates the department s
commitment to the study of "not
just the theory of music, but the sci
ence of music."
"By popular music," we are
making no assumptions about the
types of music people w ill be into,"
Levitin said. "We don't want to ex
clude anyone ... We want students
who work in any i>enre. including

hip-hop. R&B. blues, rap. country,
jaalternative and so on."
The class is a break from the ex
isting music classes that focus sole
ly on the arrangement and orches
tration of classical music.
Students will be required to

write and record a new arrange
ment each week and distribute
theii work to the class for peer cri
tiques.
"Jay and I will really iust be ref
erees." I evitin added. "The course
is about getting input from your

colleagues because this is more like
what happens in the real world."
The class w ill be limited to six to
eight students admitted tin the
basis of a demo tape submitted to
the department by Feb. 23. While
there are no formal requirements

fiÂ»r the course, students w ill need to
know how to record their own
work in a four- or eight-track for
mat. Although the assignments wifl
be recorded instead of written, stu
