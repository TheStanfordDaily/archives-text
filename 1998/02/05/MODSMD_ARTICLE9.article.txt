FOR THE RECORD
An article in yesterday's Daily incorrectly stated that graduate
students living in Rains Houses are required to vacate their apart
ments for two days while the rooms are being painted. Actually,
the painters will paint the apartments while students are in class
es, and students have the option of remaining in the commons
room while the bedroom is being painted and vice versa.
