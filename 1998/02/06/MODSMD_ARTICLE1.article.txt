Expressing dismay over student
behavior at recent athletic events.
Athletic Director Ted I eland yester
day proposed reconsidering the de
partment's policy of seating the Sixth
Man Club on the floor of Maples
Pavilion.
At an afternoon Faculty Senate
meeting, University President Ger
hard Casper remonstrated the Sixth
Man Club for their taunts of I JC1.A
student Jelani McC oy. During last
month's Stanford / IJCLA game,
students shouted "marijuana" and
shook oversized marijuana joint
props at McCoy, who had been sus
pended earlier this year for alleged
marijuana possession.

" lhe Sixth Man Club brought
Stanford disrepute by bringing all as
peets of this young man 's life in as fair
game." ( aspei said. "Students have a
responsibility to protect the I Jniver
sity name, and actions like thai weak
en the University rather than
strengthen it."
"The deterioration of civility
began with the Band's performance
at the Notre Dame game, continued
with the melee after Big Game and
has increased at the men's basketball
games," Leland said.
One of the original aims in creat
ing the Sixth Man ( lub, according to
Leland. was to organize the crowd to
prevent obscene behavior like that
which occurred at the IJCLA game.
