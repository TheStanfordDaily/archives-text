Expressing dismay over student
behavior at recent athletic events.
Athletic Director Ted I eland yester
day proposed reconsidering the de
partment's policy of seating the Sixth
Man Club on the floor of Maples
Pavilion.
At an afternoon Faculty Senate
meeting, University President Ger
hard Casper remonstrated the Sixth
Man Club for their taunts of I JC1.A
student Jelani McC oy. During last
month's Stanford / IJCLA game,
students shouted "marijuana" and
shook oversized marijuana joint
props at McCoy, who had been sus
pended earlier this year for alleged
marijuana possession.

" lhe Sixth Man Club brought
Stanford disrepute by bringing all as
peets of this young man 's life in as fair
game." ( aspei said. "Students have a
responsibility to protect the I Jniver
sity name, and actions like thai weak
en the University rather than
strengthen it."
"The deterioration of civility
began with the Band's performance
at the Notre Dame game, continued
with the melee after Big Game and
has increased at the men's basketball
games," Leland said.
One of the original aims in creat
ing the Sixth Man ( lub, according to
Leland. was to organize the crowd to
prevent obscene behavior like that
which occurred at the IJCLA game.
Because the C lub no longer seems to
serve that function, Leland indicat
ed, it might lose its special seats.
"Have we created a monster?"
I eland asked.
Another reason for moving the
club, Leland indicated, would be to
give other students, those not in Sixth
Man. the opportunity to sit closer to
the action.
The Department of Athletics also
continues to apportion blame for the
Stanford Band's half-time show dur
ing the Stanford / Notre Dame loot
ball game.
"My stall made a mistake in ap
proving that script," Leland said.
"On the other hand, the idea that
[the Band] reports to anyone is hard
to believe."
Members of the senate also
voiced reservations about the level of

corporate sponsorship at athletic
events.
"Have we talked carefully
enough about what, if anything, it
means for Stanford student athletes
to be marked in such a large percent
age of things by the Nike swoosh?"
asked Classics Prof. Marsh MeCall.
" I he commercialization of col
lege athletics over the past decade
has been extreme, and we are not im
mune," Casper said.
Phe Athletics Department cur
rently receives $2 to $2.5 million per
year in corporate sponsorships. T his
includes uniforms provided by Nike
for almost every varsity team in ex
change for the prominent placement
of Nike's "swoosh" logo.
"We're beginning to cross over a
line, and we need to re-examine our
corporate sponsorships," Leland
said.
"I would like to see if we can at
least reduce our dependence (on
corporate sponsors], but that would

call for a huge increase in endow
ment to replace the funding,"
Casper said.
I he Athletics Department is as
sessing the feasibility of removing all
corporate signs from Stanford Stadi
um and Maples Pavilion except for
those under the scoreboards.
The senate continues to look into
the scheduling of athletic events dur
ing I )ead Week. The conflict centers
over whether the weekend between
Dead Week and finals counts as part
of Dead Week, and is therefore off
limits to athletic events, or whether
events are permitted to occur over
that weekend.
"We want athletes to be regular
Stanford students," McCall said.
University Registrar Roger
Prin tup gave the task of defining the
parameters of Dead Week to the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement, which will discuss
its decision at a future senate meet
ing.
