## Officials not worried despite Monday bombing 
### 
NAGANO. Japan (AP) —
Police played down any threat
from radicals who boasted they
had beaten the Olympics' "heavy,
counter-revolutionary" security,
and thousands of officers prepared
for the arrival of the emperor and
other VI Ps for the start of the Win
ter Games today.
There have been no security
scares in Nagano. But a Monday
night attack at Tokyo's airport so
close to the start of the games
clearly embarrassed the Olympic
host.
The ultra-leftist Revolutionary
Workers Association sent letters

to Tokyo media yesterday claiming
responsibility for three homemade
rockets that were fired Monday
night into a cargo plane area at
Tokyo's international airport. One
airport worker was injured.
In the letter, the group said it is
opposed to the construction of a
second runway at Narita airport,
which opened in 1978. Leftist
groups claim a larger airport could
be used for military purposes.
Some 6,(XX) police are being
mobilized in Nagano, and an addi
tional 3.0(H) security personnel are
working for the Olympic organiz
ing committee.

"We arc ensuring that all securi
ty is in place.' said Nagano Police
spokesman Toshio Gomyou.
The officers at the Olympics are
at nearly every street corner. But
in contrast to the dark, militaristic
uniforms usually worn b\
Japanese police, these officer;
wear special yellow and light-blut
gear that resembles skiwear. Tha
is so they don't disrupt the peace
ful ambience of the games. Gomy
ou said
International Olympic Commit
tee officials reiterated their conti
dence in the Nagano committee
ability to protect the Games.
