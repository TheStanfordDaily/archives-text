Evaluate media sources
for integrity and values
before forming opinions

I FIND IT quite ironic that in an era
when we have access to all the
information in the world, we still
tend to make judgments on the bases
of hearsay and innuendo. In doing so,
we hurt ourselves by failing to take
advantage of innate decision-making
skills. Instead, we allow our opinions
to be formed by the media machine.
The other day. I was talking with a
friend about the Monica Lewinsky
"scandal." My friend seemed com
pletely convinced of the president's
complicity, citing the "pieces of evi
dence" that were mounting — the
tapes, the dress, the phone calls, the
White House visits. This evidence was
strengthened all the more bv the pres
ident's supposed past indiscretions.
As I listened to the "evidence," I
envisioned a different spin on the story
— Ms. Lewinsky as Abigail Williams
in the newest version of Arthur
Miller's "The Crucible." I could pic
ture a woman in a private conversa
tion. spinning a yarn about an affair
with a politically powerful man.
The conversation begets one embel
lishment after another — encouraged
by the attentive audience of her sup
posed confidant. I could easily use all
the "evidence" shown to support the
other view of the story.
Who is right? Did the president do
it? We might never know. In this world
of spin doctors and media maestros,
how can anyone be certain of the facts
regarding events outside our control?

Just before this "scandal" broke, I
saw Barry Levinson's "Wag the Dog,"
a film in which a movie producer is
hired to generate the illusion of a war
in order to divert the country's atten
tion from a W'hite House sex scandal.
Through the judicial use of press
releases, innuendoes and"leaks,"
three people duped the ever-vigilant
media and the entire country into
believing the concocted story.
Is it a surprise that spin doctors have
this much control over our collective
viewpoint? In the recent movie "Con
tact," Jodie Foster's character is passed
over for her dream position because of
her honesty and integrity in answering
a question about her relationship with
God. Tom Skerrit's character, who is
selected for the position by "playing
the game," sums it up simply when he
says, "Ellen, I know how much you
wanted to go. 1 truly wish we lived in a
world where that kind of honesty and
integrity really mattered."
In the early days of television, we
trusted people like Walter Cronkite
and Edward R. Murrow — people
who had integrity and values we
respected. Today, there are few news
casters or media moguls who don't
have their own spins on stories — spins
that best fit their own agendas.
As media consumers, we need to
take it upon ourselves to evaluate the
sources of our information — are they
reflecting our own personal biases?
We need to look beyond the "facts"
that are being presented and be more
vigilant in our search for the truth.
Only with vigilance, honesty and
integrity will we overcome our human
nature and learn to grow into a well
connected society.
