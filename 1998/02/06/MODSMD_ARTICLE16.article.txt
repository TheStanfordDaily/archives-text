When volunteering in the
surrounding communities,
I often find myself winc
ing every time someone
asks this question. Why?

Because despite the University's vast tech
nological and academic resources, I feel
powerless in my ability to use them to ben
efit the outside community.
By attending Stanford, my capacity to
engage in public service has increased. But
ironically, this capacity is not realized to
its fullest extent due to insufficient Uni
versity support. This leaves me with two
questions: What is the role of Stanford stu
dents working in communities beyond
Stanford? And what is the role of an
international university, like Stanford, in
its local community?
With no easy answers, I turned to his
tory. David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first
president, declared that universities
nationwide were moving towards empha
sizing "reality and practicality." Indeed,
Stanford's l(X)-year legacy is most visibly
one of technological innovation, and the
vibrations of Stanford's humming engine
of production continue to be global in
reach.
This far-reaching effect on society
resulted from a marriage between Univer
sity departments and local industry. Cer
tainly, while Silicon Valley is one compo
nent of our local community, it is not the
only resident. Are these prized technolog

ical discoveries the most significant gifts
that Stanford can contribute to improving
the human condition?
A quote by University President Ger
hard Casper provides some illumination:
"Members of a university community,
whatever their views, must not shy away
from the social and political issues of their
time, from citizenship, from engaging in
service to the public — service in the many
forms such service can take. Stanford is
very supportive of these endeavors that
are made most effective by applying the
same critical reasoning to public service
that is otherwise prized in the University."
So, to President Casper, it seems that
the most fundamental relationship that
can be built between Stanford and our sur
rounding community is one which mobi
lizes the core purpose of our university:
education and research. But how can an
academically rigorous education be
geared toward public service?
Two potent ways of bringing academic
pursuit and public service together are
through service-learning and public ser
vice research. Service-learning classes are
taught by Stanford faculty from a variety
of departments who design an academic,
theoretical framework around course
themes such as "Urban Policy," "Poverty
and Homelessness in America"and
"Race, Poverty, and the Environment."
Concurrently, many service-learning
classes have a community-based compo
nent which enables students to participate
in a structured internship. The fusion
between academic theories and practical

experience provides students with a more
complex understanding of the world and
enables students to contribute to commu
nity organizations.
Similarly, public service research chal
lenges the student to work with faculty
and organizations to address community
needs and to produce academically rigor
ous work, such as a thesis or scientific
paper. These partnerships integrate ser
vice, learning and research. Moreover,
they address questions important to the
community while simultaneously meeting
the University's standards for academic
excellence. Student demand for this type
of academic work already exceeds the
capacity of the current system.
University partnerships with Silicon
Valley industries spawned innovation and
economic growth. With similar institution
al support and recognition, and by apply
ing the same critical thinking, innovation
and resources to public service, the Uni
versity can both sow and reap the benefits
of a broader-based partnership with the
surrounding communities.
If we are courageous enough to pursue
a broader vision for a partnership among
the University and surrounding communi
ties in the coming millennium, where
could imagination take us? What if uni
versities were organized to do work
addressing critical social issues — work
worthy of a different Nobel Prize — the
peace prize?
