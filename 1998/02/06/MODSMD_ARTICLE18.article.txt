Evans column uses wrong
approach to today's youth
I am writing to offer advice to Darron
Evans before he makes his presidential
hid in 2012. His Jan. 30 column, "There is
a far better thing to be done," criticizes
many people for a multitude of reasons.
While Evans' intentions are admirable,
the effect of his message is marred by the
patronizing tone and unfocused presenta
tion of his concerns. Demeaning people's
emotions, ambitions and interests does not
cause them to change. Mr. Evans might
learn something from Robert F. Kennedy
about true leadership.
"The task of leadership ... is not to
condemn or castigate or deplore; it is to
search out the reason for disillusionment
and alienation, the rationale of dissent
and protest â€” perhaps, indeed, to learn
from it. And we may find that we learn
most of all from those political and social
dissenters whose differences with us are
most grave; for among the young, as
among adults, their sharpest criticism
often goes hand in hand with the deepest
idealism and love of country."
If "other people's ideas are worth con
sidering," I encourage Evans to reflect on
the cause of disillusionment and alien
ation of today's youth rather than to state
the obvious effects of it.
