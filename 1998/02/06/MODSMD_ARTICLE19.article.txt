## Presidency shall profit from 'Spice trade' 
###

DEAR MR. PRESlDENT:Consol
idate the ground troops. Mobilize
the Marines. Reincarnate the min
utemen. It's time to invade Britain.
When movie theaters opened two weeks
ago, "Spice World," the Spice Girls' newly
released chick Hick (although my brother
says boys like it, too) caught fire. Forget
Iraqi oil. England's got a slicker natural
resource. And tomorrow at this hour,
according to my best strategic estimation,
we should already he in control.
1 feel inclined to assure you of the
appeal of such an invasion, transparent
though they may be. With the Spice Girls in
your pocket, you can capitalize on stellar
economic and foreign policy successes
while revamping your image with the anti
libido moralists. Forget about oil — Scary,
Baby, Clinger. Posh and Sporty Spice are
HOT commodities. We need to cash in.
In their first year, the girls have sold
more records than the Beatles. Four singles
off their first album have topped the charts
in Britain, and "Wannabe" has hit No. 1 in
the United States. An analysis of the song's

lyrics easily explains its universal populari
ty-
"Yo, I'll tell you what I want, what I
really really want ... Tell me what you
want ... (repeat many times) I wanna, I
wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna really
really really wanna zigazig ha." It's you.

Straightforward. Of the people.
Memorizing this song (study
hard, and you can do it) will be
essential to garnering the
younger population's support
and esteem. Today's little
wannabes are tomorrow's yup
pies. Twenty years from now,
when you have a solid career in
speech-making, you will want
them by your side. Al Gore per
formed the Macarena at the
Democratic National Conven
tion. He is vice president, and
his showmanship must not

overshadow your own presidential youth
fulness.
Not only political tap dance, hut hard
economics also offer additional proof of the
market value of the Spice Girls. According

to the widely-reputed Daily Express, the
girls currently earn $12.5 million each. Next
year that could easily double. Their GSP
(Ciross Spice Product) could be up to $5.3
billion by the year 2(KM).
By conquering Britain, not only could we
collect these kissable sums of money, we

could appeal to the right-wing
crowd, propping them up as
examples of the rugged individ
ual (Sporty), Toryism (Ginger)
and family values (Scary).
Please, Mr. President, restrain
your radical political agenda.
Stop making promises about
school reform. Instead, try the
middle-of-the-road stance just
this once. Come on, tell 'em
what they want, what they real
ly, really want.
The societal ramifications
of the Spice Girls, with implica

tions for feminists and youth, are especially
noteworthy. As exemplified by the lyrics
"Generation next, generation next/ (Ah
generation next) / Generation next, gener
ation next / (Cieneration) / Generation

next. gen..the Spice CJirls have the
minds of today's girls and tomorrow's
women clutched tightly to their chests.
The Ciirls represent feminism. They sing
for junior-high fans who have informed
Weh surfers that. "We went to school wear
ing Spicy-type clothes and making lots of
noise!! We basically had GIRL POWER!!
We loved it!! ... First of all. about 2(XX)
guys asked us out!!" The Spice Girls sing
for Margaret I hatcher, the embodiment of
modern feminism. They sing for Hillary
and her cookie-free healthcare reform.
They sing for a young White House intern
... well never mind her. actually.
And. whether or not they intend it. as
they sing, the Spice Ciirls substantiate the
notion that absolutely ANYONE can be a
star. In fact, rather than visit the CPPC, I
took an on line qui/ to see which Spice Girl
I most resemble. To question three. I
responded that I would more likely spend
my last two hours before the earth explodes
"kissing the nearest available person" than
"clothes shopping."
Perhaps because of this, my closest kin is
Baby Spice, who claims to win arguments

by "shedding a tear for sympathy." SEE!
They nurture dreams and aspirations of
youth in my own aimless and troubled gen
eration. In the State of the Union, you men
tioned prioritizing social security. Now
here's an item with more universal appeal.
And you can own them!
In 1492, Columbus came to America
l(K>king for a way to bring spices to Ferdi
nand and Isabella. Now. 506 years later, we
have discovered the path Columbus
missed. It's time to go down in history. Mr.
President. And the invasion is made even
more urgent because according to music
industry experts, the Spice Girls will come
to an end within two or three years.
As soon as they cease to be economical
ly profitable, we can always, well, pull out.
But meanwhile, may I suggest that we take
their lyrics to heart and "Wey hey /Come
on. come on, come on / Come on and do it
(x 2) / Hey / Do it. do it. do it."

and self-appointed Clinton adviser, will he
writing a column that appears here on Fri
days.
