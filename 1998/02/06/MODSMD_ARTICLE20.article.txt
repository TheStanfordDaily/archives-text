at the DC LA Invitational at Pauley Pavilion.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
â–  SATURDAY: No. 13 Stanford (1-2.1-2 l>;i
cific 10Conference) at the IJCLA Invitational,
all day.

The Cardinal (1-2, 1-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) is riding on the success of last week's win
over the Arizona Wildcats, when it had strong
individual performances and intense focus.
This weekend will be a true test of where the
Cardinal stands in relationship to the rest of the
country.
"I like going against the best teams." said
head coach Mark Cook. "It shows us the level
we need to be better than in order to establish
ourselves as a team that will challenge for a na
tional championship each year."
No. 7 UC LA (4-1, 2-0) returns four Ail-
Americans from last year's national champi
onship squad, including juniors Kiralee
Hayashi and Stella Umeh. Sophomore Heidi
Moneymaker promises to give the Cardinal a
run for its money.
Added to the squad this year is freshman
standout Mohini Bhardwaj. Standing ;it only 4-
foot-10, Bhardwaj has made quite a contribu
tion this year. The Bruins are strong as a team,
averaging 193.35 points. They also had a stellar
meet last weekend, defeating Arizona State,
UC-Santa Barbara and Denver, taking first
place in every event, including the Ail-Around.
Ninth-ranked Michigan (6-2) is also full of
talent. The Wolverines finished fourth at na
tionals last year and have made four consecu
tive Super Six appearances. Returning from
last year's squad are Sarah Cain, Nikki Peters,
Kathy Burke, Beth Amelkovich and Heather

Kabnick. who were all recognized as All-
Americans.
Cornell University (4-1) will round out the
competition, but they don't pose a real threat to
the Cardinal as they are in Division 111 and are
attending the meet for pure enjoyment.
"It's going to be a tough battle," Cook said.
"But our battle is to improve our team score
from each weekend."
Cook will be returning to his former place of
employment, where he helped lead the Bruins
to last year's national championship. I lowever.
he refuses to focus on his past ties with UCLA
and is concentrated on Stanford, His goal for
this weekend is cleaner execution and focus
throughout the entire meet.
"We have to focus on our landings," said ju
nior co-captain Amy Murakami. "Last year we
came so close to UCLA at Pac-lOs. This year
we have to focus on what we can do."
The meet will mark the debut of second
team All-American sophomore Larissa
Fontaine on the fl(X)r. Fontaine is returning
from a broken thumb and has gradually been
competing in more events at each meet.
"I expect Larissa to really step it up," ( ook
said. "She competed at nationals last year and
is an experienced competitor."
Former Canadian Olympian Jennifer Ex
altacion, a freshman, will compete again on the
bars for the Cardinal, which according to Cook
is "refreshing." Although Fontaine and Exalta
cion are partially back, the squad is still not in
full force as it is waiting for junior Katie Fitz
patrick to return from ankle surgery.
The tournament will be a good warmup for
the C ardinal as both the Pac-10Championships
meet and nationals are being held at Pauley
Pavilion this year.
" I his meet will be a good chance for the girls
who haven't competed at Pauley to get a feel
for it before the major meets," Cook said.
"I think we all regained our perspective over
the weekend and remembered that we're doing
this tor lun and we are supposed to relax and
enjoy it." said senior Amy Neil.
