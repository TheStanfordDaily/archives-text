# Women face Cal at Maples
## Folkl won't play, six straight wins at stake for Card

Two months ago, the world seemed
to be slipping off its axis for Stanford
women's basketball fans.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ TONIGHT: Stanford (12-5. 8-1 Pa
cific 10 Conference) vs. California (5-
14, 1-8) at Maples Pavilion, 7:30 p.m.

Their beloved Cardinal was off to a
1-3 start, its worst in 15 years, and had
slipped to as low as lKth in the national
rankings. But that was two months ago
and several galaxies away from where
Stanford is today.
Entering tonight's 7:30 p.m. game
against California at Maples Pavilion,
the Cardinal (12-5. X-l Pacific 10 Con
ference) is back up to No. 6 in the coun
try and riding the high of last Satur
day's 80-71 win at then-No. 5 Texas
Tech.
That victory was the first in three
tries for a Stanford team in Lubbock.
Tex., and it extended the Card's sea
son-best win streak to six. Suddenly the
moons are properly aligned, and if any
thing out of the norm is happening
around Maples, it's probably a result of
El Nino.
"It feels like in the beginning we
were way out here." said head coach
Tara VanDerveer, spreading her
hands a few feet apart. "And it just
feels like we're getting tighter and
tighter — and tougher. 1 think we're a
whole different team than we were
three months ago. and what I'm excit-

ed about is where we want to go in
another month."
But first the Cardinal will have to
deal with the loss of junior forward
Kristin Folkl, who is out for at least
10 days with the two broken fingers
she suffered at Texas Tech. Folkl is
the team's leading scorer and re
bounder. Since her return. Stanford
is 9-1 with its only loss coming at
Arizona.
"Because she's shooting such a
high percentage, I think people are
really fouling her," VanDerveer
said. "People just go after her. 1
don't really know what to do except
I think the officials need to tighten it
up. I hate to sec anyone get hurt, es
pecially when I think it could've
been prevented."
Now Folkl's absence will create
new questions for VanDerveer in re
gards to her lineup. VanDerveer
could bring in some freshmen post

players, or she could move senior
Vanessa Nygaard from small to
power forward and dig into her sup
ply of young guards on the perimeter.
"I really think that's probably
what we'll do a little bit," Van-
Derveer said of moving Nygaard in
side. "It will really depend on what
we need and how different people
are playing. Against C'al especially,
Vanessa's so valuable on the perime
ter shooting, and against a team like
IJCLA you want to be big."
VanDerveer will have plenty of
time to contemplate lineups for next
week's game against the Bruins, but
first her team will face a Cal team
that's tailspinning toward another
planet.
The Golden Bears (5-14.1-8) are
currently on a nine-game losing
streak and have not won a single
game since the last time these two
teams met. That was a sloppy con
test that saw Stanford lead by as
many as 30 before finishing off the
Bears 72-52. Folkl led the way in
that matchup with 16 points and 13

rebounds, both game-highs.
"Obviously Kristin is really im
portant to our team," VanDerveer
said. "We're a lot better with her,
but this isn't a one-person team.
And in order for us to play at the
level we want to play at. you're not
going to win being a one-person
team. Everyone has to play well."
And that's exactly what the Car
dinal did when Folkl went down at
Texas Tech. Everyone knocked
down big shots, and Stanford
charged out to an 11-point lead in
the final eight minutes of the game.
That kind of performance in the ab
sence of your best player is a definite
confidence booster and may show
just how far the Cardinal has come
this season.
"I think this team is on a steep
improvement curve," VanDerveer
said. " I'llis may be our biggest team
in terms of improvement. I can't tell
you we've worked any harder with
any other team, and it will be inter
esting to see how we do the second
time around in the Pac-10."
