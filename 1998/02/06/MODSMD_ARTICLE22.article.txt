### Michaela Crouch Contributing writer 
In last night's showcase of the
Stanford men's volleyball team's
depth, the Cardinal posted a home
victory against the Trinity Western
University Spartans, 12-15, 15-6, 15-
8,15-10. "
The sixth-ranked and defending
national champion Cardinal (4-0, 3-
0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion), did not improve its record with
last night's victory, as TWl' is not an
NCAA member.

Although Stanford was victori
ous in the four-game match, the
team did not put out their best effort.
"We should never take winning
for granted," Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves said, "but I'm disap
pointed with our play."
Some positive things did exist in
the Cardinal's match. In his first
game appearance since early Janu
ary. junior outside hitter ( litis (Grif
fith had the highest hitting percent
age for Stanford with 4(H). Griffith
injured his ankle in the first game of
the match, but came back to post

nine kills for the Cardinal.
"Chris Griffith was the closest to
putting together a solid match
tonight," Nieves said. "His play was
a bright spot."
Senior swing hitter Devin Pool
man and junior outside hitter
Patrick Klein also had strong offen
sive nights for Stanford, adding 23
kills each to the Cardinal's total.

MEN S VOLLEYBALL
■ LAST NIGHTS RESULT:
Stanford del. Trinity Western Uni
versity 12-15,15-6.15-8. 15-10
■ TOMORROW: No. 6 Stanford
(4-0,3-0 MPSF) vs. No. 14 Pacific (5-
2,2-1) at Burnham Pavilion, 7 p.m.

Klein was also strong on the de
fensive side, posting 14 digs. Junior
middle blocker Jeremy Bart added
nine digs. As a team, the Cardinal
had 44 digs compared with only 24
for the Spartans.
Freshman setter Brad Griffith
had 73 assists for the Cardinal, hut
was also a factor in Stanford's Mak
ing. posting five assisted blocks and
one solo Nock.
"Brad Griffith did a nice job
blocking on the right." Nieves com
mented.
Griffith's blocking worked to
slow down the Spartans' top hitter,
senior outside hitter Eric Doef.
Doef was TWU's kill leader with 14.
but only hit .103.
Stanford struggled early in the
match, dropping the first game 12-
15. Poolman took charge of the Car
dinal and provided a leadership
presence.
*'While we were struggling. Pool
man kept us together and heljx'd us
get going." Nieves said. "He played
and acted like a leader."
Later in the match, after falling
behind 7-8 in the third game, the
Cardinal proceeded to post 15 a>n
sccutive points through the third and
into the fourth game. Stanford let
TWl' back into the fourth game, but

scored the final four points of the
match.
After last night's rather meaning
less victory, the Cardinal must turn
around and play a completely differ
ent match. At 7 p.m. tomorrow, the
Cardinal will face the 12th-ranked
University of the Pacific at Burnham
Pavilion.
Last Saturday at Pacific, the Car
dinal posted a four-game victory
against the Tigers. The Tigers' top
hitter, sophomore outside hitter
Vladimir Andric. did not pla\ in the
match due to an injury.
In Andric's last match two weeks
ago. he posted a match-high 38 kills
against San Diego State. Andric
brings international experience to
the Tigers as a former member of the
Croatian Junior National Team.
After a rest last night, senior mid
dle blocker Keenan Whitehurst,
sophomore outside hitters Josh
Palacios and Andy Witt and fresh
man setter Josh Lukcns should all
return to Stanford's lineup.
Whitehurst and Lukcns rested
because they were not necessarx to
last night's victory, while Palacios
and Witt rested due to health con
cerns. Witt did not dress lor last
night's game after a muscle pull in
his shoulder two weeks ago. Palacios
is still not in top form after shoulder
surgery last year
After dedicating this week to to
morrow night's match, the Cardinal
definitely has some things in mind to
prepare for against Pacific.
"We want to put energy into
slowing down their front attack."
Nieves commented, "especially il
Andric doesn't play."
Stanford entered this week first
in the Pacific Division of the MPS!
A victory tomorrow night has some
potential implications in the Cardi
nal's hopes for postseason play.
When the MI*SI tournament occurs
in April, victories against tough con
ference opponents like Pacific will
make a major impact on the Cardi
nal's postseason appearances.
