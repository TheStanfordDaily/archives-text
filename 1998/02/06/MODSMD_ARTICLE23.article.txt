But first. the\ have other things
to take care of.
After snapping its two-game los

(14-2, 8-2 Pacific 10 Conference)
will look to solidif) their status ,is

tomorrow at 4 a.m. PS I
1 he game will be nationally
broadcast on CBS from Connecti
cut's sold out Gampel Pavilion,
mat king Stanford's second appeal
ance on the network this season. It
also gives the ( ardinal another
chance to displav its talent to the
nation against a strong opponent.
Voters across the country were
impressed with the ( ardinal s 43-80
victor) over UCI A on Jan. 17 as
the) bumped the Cardinal up to
No. 5 in the rankings.
Another sign that the C ardinal is
still respected as a national power:
despite dropping games to Arizona
and Arizona State last week, the
team didn't tall out of the top 10 in
either poll.
I he team has built itself up with
an all around attack that forces op
ponents to try to shut the entire
team down, not just one man.
"I think we're fairly versatile,"
said Stanford head coach Mike

Montgomery i don't think you
can key in on one particular person
I don't think we have a star that \ou
can focus on. and it sou take him
out you're done.
"I think that we've got prett\
gotnJ depth from the standpoint
that it we get in foul trouble or it we
get a little fatigued, we can come
with eu\s oil the bench that give us
a lift."
Ol course, retaining their st;itus
won't be easy.
I he Huskies (20-3. N-2 Mig East
Conference) are led bv an All-
Amencan caliber forward in sopho
more Richard Hamilton. Hamilton
is averaging 21» points per game
for the I luskies. and is the frontrun

honors.
C onnecticut also has a strong
point in Khahd I I Amin.whoavet
ages 14 J points and iust over four
assists a game.
The Cardinal will be facing a fa
miliar team, one that is quick, loves
to run the floor and is able to move
the ball efficiently
Stanford has played its last tout
games against teams w Inch prefer a
high tempo st\k> of pla\ Although
the Card s starters have been able
to step up. its seems the bench has
had trouble keeping pace.
Against the Hears. Stanford had
only i: points and seven rebounds
combined from its reserves, a trend
that has been apparent since the
team's trip through Washington
two weeks ago.
I he only problem with having to
take time out to face Connecticut is
that the ( ardinal must do so right in
the middle of the Pac-IO season
and. perhaps more importantly,
right before its rematch with the
No. (> Bruins.
But Montgomery knows that
