WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ SATURDAY: Stanford vs. Cal at
UC-San Diego. 4 p.m.

With new head eoach John Tan
ner and assistant coach Susan Or
twein in charge, the Cardinal has
been gearing up for the first tourna
ment of the year. This weekend, the
team will travel to UC-San Diego.
Based on a fourth-place finish last
year at nationals, Stanford is ranked
fourth going into the San Diego tour
nament.
"Nine out of the top 10 teams will
be there," Tanner said. "We're going
to find out how we stack up."
The team's performance this
weekend and the quality of the com -
petition will be an important preview
of what to expect in the upcoming
season. This year, lone senior Julie
Baker is joined by eight juniors, six
sophomores, and eight freshmen
from whom the 15-person traveling
team will be selected.
"The team is working very well
together," Tanner said. "You can
only put seven people in the water,
but whatever they're doing will re
flect the work that all 23 have
done."
Tanner and Ortwein joined the
Stanford coaching staff this year after
12 years of working with the water
polo program at University of the Pa

cific. A graduate of Stanford, Tanner
was a member of the men's water
polo team during his undergraduate
years.
"It's nice to be back, since 1 went
here and played here," said Tanner.
"But the inspiring part is coming to
the pool and being around the best
coaches in the world ... it's a terrific
atmosphere."
Ortwein, in addition to coaching
for two years at Pacific, was a four
year All-American at UC-Santa Bar
bara and a member of the Senior Na
tional Team for two years.
Since practices began in the fall.
Tanner and Ortwein have worked to
bring together the strengths of the re
turning women with those of the
large recruiting class. The combina
tion of Tanner and Ortwein's strong
water polo experience — both in the
water and on the deck — and the
wealth of talent among the players is
an encouraging prospect.
"The philosophy we're trying to
put in place is to be aggressive and to
create offensive opportunities on de
fense ... to play aggressively but
under control," said Tanner. And
with both the two-time national
champion UCLA and the two-time
runner-up Cal squads to contend
with, the Cardinal women will have
to do just that.
Stanford faces Cal's junior varsity
team today at 4 p.m. They then take
on USC tomorrow at 9 a.m. Depend
ing on the results of the first two
matches, the Cardinal will be seeded
in the quarterfinals on Saturday af
ternoon. Semifinals and finals will be
held on Sunday.
