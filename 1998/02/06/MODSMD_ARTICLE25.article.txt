last season.

USC, 1 p.m.

Last year's meet was a tense af
fair, with the Trojans eventually
winning a very close meet after the
No. 1 Cardinal (5-0, 2-0 Pacific 10
Conference) jumped out to an early
lead. While this has always been an
intense rivalry, last year's loss to a
questionably sportsmanlike USC
squad has only added more fuel to
the Cardinal's fire.
"That was the first (and only)
dual meet we've lost while I've been
here," said junior Dod Wales.
Stanford is also looking forward to
winning back the Bell Trophy, which
goes to the victor of the dual meet be
tween these two squads. The loss of
the Hell Trophy to USC last year was
one of the most painful moments of
the season, and this year's team is de
termined to go in to USC's pool and
dominate their Trojan rivals.
Since the team's focus is always
on the national title meet in March,
this week's training program was not

altered for the meet. Hut the swim
mers will be motivated and ready to
swim fast at I JSC' on Friday.
" This is the biggest meet of my
life (except for NC'AAs)," said se
nior captain Scott Claypool about
his last dual meet against USC.
This rivalry goes back many years
to the days of legendary USC coach
Peter Daland. The teams have had
great swimmers and great races over
the years, with memorable
matchups between such swimming
greats as USC's Dan Jorgenson and
Stanford's Jeff Kostoff. One l(KK)
freestyle race saw them both swim
under nine minutes, considerably
faster than the top time of the year
this year in the event, which is 9:04.
Several deGuerre pool records
have also been set in this matchup,
the latest being in 1993 when Stan
ford's medley relay swam a 3:16.75.
This record was broken earlier this
year by the Cardinal men against
Texas, which provides some indica
tion as to the talent on this year's
Stanford squad.
While all deGuerre records are
safe for this meet because it will be at
Southern California's pool, the meet
is still expected to be fast and in
tense.
In 1992, USC, under Daland,
swam a great meet to beat eventual
champion Stanford, one of the best
college swim teams ever assembled.
Since Daland's retirement, Stanford

won a few meets handily over new
coach Mark Schubert, and the rival
ry ehhed somewhat. Hut the past
two years saw the resurgence of
I JSC's pride.
USC came in to last year's meet
prepared to win. and the team pulled
it off with its usual charm. The I JS('
coaches entered the lineups incor
rectly for the 2(H) backstroke and the
S(H) freestyle, inadvertently signing
the backstrokers up for the freestyle
and vice versa. In a well-spirited
move, the Stanford coaches allowed
USC to revise the lineups after they
had been announced.
Capitalizing on this kindness,
USC managed to finish 1-2-3 in the
S(X) free, which marked the turning
point of the meet. In celebration of
this finish, the Trojan swimmers
began a "1-2-3!" chant.
The Stanford loss last year
marked the first time the seniors lost
anything to USC, and this year's
Stanford seniors are very adamant
about going out with a victory.
"We're going to go down there
and bring the Hell back!" said senior
Tom Wilkens.
Whether USC comes out with
last year's fire or gives in early, ex
pect the Cardinal to show the inten
sity of champions this weekend.
"It's not if we're going to win or
lose, hut how much we will win by."

son.
