# Stanford hosts Fullerton
## El Nino postpones series opener until tomorrow 
### Brian Eule Contributing writer 
With the mighty El Nino at the
plate, many Bay Area baseball
teams are getting their series called
on account of rain. The Cardinal,
however, is one step ahead of the
game — tonight's series opener with
Cal State Fullerton was postponed
on account of the possibility of rain.
While Sunken Diamond is hold
ing up after Monday night's torren
tial downpour, the three-game series
with Cal State Fullerton, to start Fri
day, was pushed back to Saturday in
order to avoid a rainout tonight. The
downside for Stanford's baseball
team, however, is that it now has
four straight games, two days off.
and then travels to Texas for a three
game series.
"It will force us to use a little
more pitching, which is not bad at
this point in the season." said Cardi
nal head coach Mark Marquess,
whose players have to check the
scheduling of their midterms with
the addition of Monday's game.
"Most of the time [classes are] not a
problem. If it becomes a problem,
then they go to class and come out
when they can."
After rolling over Fresno State
last weekend, the No. I Cardinal (5-
0) plays host to the I'itans (3-1),
ranked 10th. tomorrow at 1 p.m.

Starting three left-handed pitchers,
Fullerton will provide a challenge
for Stanford's offense.
"It will be a little different." Mar
quess said. "It's another good test.
It's tough to play them because they
do a lot of different things."
