### Mino Martinez Contributing writer 
The dual meet portion of the
season is winding down for the
top-ranked Stanford women's
swimming team. Hut before it con
eludes, the Cardinal must take to
the water at noon tomorrow
against the No. 13 Texas Long
horns at deGuerre Pool.
While the Longhorns have a
deep and talented team, they pose
little threat to the Cardinal women
(5-0.4-0 Pacific 10 Conference).
With the Pac-10 Champi
onships fast approaching, the Car
dinal swimmers will take more in
terest in their own races than they
will in the overall competition.
Still on a tough training schedule,
the Stanford swimmers will he
given an opportunity to focus on
their racing form without the wor

ries of losing the meet.
The Longhorns will not be
lacking in swimmers when they ar
rive on the Farm. Erin Maher is
among the fastest in the nation in
the 50-yard freestyle, as is Colleen
Lanne.

vs. No. 13 Texas at deGuerre fxxil.
noon.

A testament to the Longhorn's
depth arc the relay teams. Every
freestyle relay and medley relay
ranks in the top 20 in the nation.
The best of these relays being the
2(X)-yard freestyle relay, which
ranks third in the country.
However, swimming against
the Cardinal is like sending trwp s
into battle armed only with butter

knives. The Stanford squad will be
led by sophomore Catherine Fox
and freshman Misty Hyman. who
turned in fantastic times in last
week's competitions. Looking to
continue her streak of fine perfor
mances will be junior breaststro
ker Elin Austevoll.
Many other swimmers will also
get a chance to contribute a large
number of points for the Cardinal.
Freshman Lauren Thies. coming
off three victories last weekend,
should be in the hunt for a few
more victories. Another fresh
man. Siobhan Cropper, will be
among the leaders in the sprint
freestyle events. Adding to this
depth will be sophomores Jessica
Amev and Gabriclle Rose.
Against this overmatched
Texas team, each member of the
Stanford team should enjoy ven
successful results.
