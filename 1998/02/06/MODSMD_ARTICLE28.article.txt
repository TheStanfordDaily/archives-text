# Momentum to lead Card
## Fullerton up next in wrestlers' final home meet 
### Evan Meagher Contributing writer 
The Stanford wrestling team
hosts its final home dual meet of the
season tonight against C'al State
Fullerton in Burnham Pavilion. Al
though Fullerton matches up well
with the Cardinal, Stanford will un
deniably have one key advantage
over the Titans: momentum.
"I feel as though we have turned
a corner in our season and expect us
to compete really well." said Stan
ford head coach Chris Horpel.
Indeed, last Saturday's 39-3
thrashing of Portland State may
have represented a crossroads for
not only the team, which notched its
first dual-meet win of the season,
but also for several individuals.
Junior Beau Weiner's pin in the
142-pound weight class continued
his streak of superb wrestling. Wein
er has won his last two matches in
convincing fashion and appears to
be putting on the type of stretch run
that will vault him into the nationals
Sophomore Tim Kendall also
pinned his opponent on Saturday,
and will brine a two-match home

winning streak into tonight's con
test.

State, all dav.

Perhaps the biggest contribu
tion has come from senior co-cap
tain Scott Chapman With senior
co-captain Jeff Grant out with a
knee injury. Chapman has re
sponded to the team's need for
leadership with four consecutive
wins, including a major decision
over Ryan Huftless of Davis. An
honorable mention All-American
last year. Chapman seems fully re
covered from an elbow injury that
kept him out for most of the pre
season.
"You've got to look up to the
guy." said teammate Kavvon Bina.
"He's worked so hard coming back
from his injury, and he really means
a lot to the team."

Chapman's presence solidities a
lineup that is peaking at just the
right time, as the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships are just weeks
away.
"The dual with Fullerton should
be a good one." Horpel said. "If we
continue to compete like we did
against Portland State, we will finish
the season on a very strong note."
The team will then travel to San
Francisco State for the All Cal Invi
tational. to which all teams in Cali
fornia are invited. The number of
teams competing has dwindled from
32 in to just seven today, but
the competition remains fierce, as
four of those teams ranked in the na
tion's top 50, with San Francisco
State winning the Division II cham
pionship.
The tournament allows two
wrestlers per weight di\ ision. so per
formances here will likely have a di
rect effect on starting positions for
the last few dual meets and the I'ac
-10 tournament. Grant is expected to
return to action in the 1 h7-pound di
vision. as is freshman Stu White, de
pending on the severity of his ankle
injury.
