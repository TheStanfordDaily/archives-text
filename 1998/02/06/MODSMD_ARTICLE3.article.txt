Increases in research spending
in the proposed 1999 federal hud
get mean good news for Stanford,
according to several I Jniversity of
ficials.
President Clinton's budget pro
posal. heralded as the first bal
anced budget in three decades
when it was unveiled Monday, pro
vides nearly $5 billion in new re
search funding. Of particular im
portance to Stanford are an in
crease of $S3B million in university
based research and an additional
$1.5 billion for the National Insti
tutes of Health.
"The budget this year looks

quite good." University Director
of Government Relations Larry
Horton said. "The President has
been very generous."
Federal research funding
growth has leveled off in recent
years, according to Dean of Re
search Charles kruger. The pro
posed 1999 budget, in contrast, "is
very good news," he said. "It shows
a very good trend in regards to re
search budgets."
The early figures are especially
promising for the School of Medi
cine. which boasts several depart
ments that are heavily endowed bv
the National Institutes of Health.
But Medical Center officials are
waiting for congressional consent
before they start spending any new

money.
"If growth in the NIH budget
occurs at the level anticipated, it
could have a wonderful effect."
said Dr. Ed Holmes, vice president
for medical affairs and dean of the
Medical School. "But it is impor
tant to remember that this budget
increase still needs to be ap
proved."
"That approval isn't likely to
come any time soon. Clinton and
the Republican-controlled Con
gress have a history of long fights
over the budget. This year, the
issue is further muddled because
much of the new spending is con
tingent on congressional approval
