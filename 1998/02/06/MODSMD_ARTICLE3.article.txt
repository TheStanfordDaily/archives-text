# Federal budget appears promising for Stanford
## 
### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
Increases in research spending
in the proposed 1999 federal hud
get mean good news for Stanford,
according to several I Jniversity of
ficials.
President Clinton's budget pro
posal. heralded as the first bal
anced budget in three decades
when it was unveiled Monday, pro
vides nearly $5 billion in new re
search funding. Of particular im
portance to Stanford are an in
crease of $S3B million in university
based research and an additional
$1.5 billion for the National Insti
tutes of Health.
"The budget this year looks

quite good." University Director
of Government Relations Larry
Horton said. "The President has
been very generous."
Federal research funding
growth has leveled off in recent
years, according to Dean of Re
search Charles kruger. The pro
posed 1999 budget, in contrast, "is
very good news," he said. "It shows
a very good trend in regards to re
search budgets."
The early figures are especially
promising for the School of Medi
cine. which boasts several depart
ments that are heavily endowed bv
the National Institutes of Health.
But Medical Center officials are
waiting for congressional consent
before they start spending any new

money.
"If growth in the NIH budget
occurs at the level anticipated, it
could have a wonderful effect."
said Dr. Ed Holmes, vice president
for medical affairs and dean of the
Medical School. "But it is impor
tant to remember that this budget
increase still needs to be ap
proved."
"That approval isn't likely to
come any time soon. Clinton and
the Republican-controlled Con
gress have a history of long fights
over the budget. This year, the
issue is further muddled because
much of the new spending is con
tingent on congressional approval
of Clinton's proposed tobacco set
tlement.
Unlike Medicare or social secu
rity, however, research is not a hot
point of partisan contention.
"Both parties have embraced
basic rese«. ch as a legitimate func
tion of gov rnment," Horton said.
Kruger made two trips to Wash
ington, D.C., this week and spoke
with several lawmakers about the
proposed increases. The legislators
were "optimistic" about the re
search components of the budget
passing Congress, he said.
Change in funding levels occurs
gradually, so if and when the fund
ing is approved. University re

searchers would still have a long
wait for the new money, Kruger
said.
"Most of our research funding
for 1999 is already in hand," he
said.
Implications of the budget
reached past research departments
and into the Financial Aids Office.
The president proposed to raise the
maximum Pell Grant from $3,(XX)
to $3,1 (X), spending an estimated
$249 million more on the awards to
low- and middle-income under
graduates. College work study pro
grams also saw a $70 million in
crease in the budget, expanding to a
million students nationwide.
Changes in student loan proce
dures will also have an impact on
Stanford financial aid. The budget
looks to reform loan programs by

providing more benefits to stu
dents, streamlining the govern
ment-guaranteed loan system and
improving loan management.
The Financial Aids Office is
keeping up with the proposals, ac
cording to Dean of Admission and
Financial Aid Robert Kinnally,
viewing them as "positive" overall.
"We're aware of all the
changes," he said. "We keep very
informed on anything that would
impact Stanford financial aid stu
dents."
Kinnally plans to reveal several
new plans for dealing with the
changes at the University Board of
Trustees meeting Monday.
"The whole loan enterprise is
under scrutiny right now," he said.
"We're always thinking about
that."
