## The 						day that Groundhog Day died 
### 
Elegy for the Ages

What does Groundhog Day
mean to you? Not much, 1 11 war
rant. Once that day was treasured.
Nowadays it is a mere gimmick —
another opportunity for greedy cor
porations to hawk their cheap
wares. I tell you, we've lost what
Groundhog Day truly represents.
It's not about the parades, deco
rations, celebrations or what have
you. Nosirree. It's about supersti
tious curiosity in animal divinity. In
today's topsy-turvy world, I think
we've lost sight of that.
I remember being a kid who got
so excited Groundhog Day's Eve.
And it wasn't just because I was so
eager to see what the Groundhog
Fairv left me — it was also because

tomorrow was the day we found out
whether winter would end soon or
late! I'd lie shaking in my sheets,
wondering and wondering: Would
the groundhog see his shadow? Or
would he not see his shadow? I
often began sweating with febrile
excitement.
Pa died when I was just a wee
crumpet in shorts. The year was
nineteen-aught-three. We were
poor enough as it was, and Pas
death threatened to tear us all
apart. A pack of wild dogs got him
on the front door and they threat
ened to tear us all apart, too. Those
were tough times. Croiky! The
snow was three or 15 feet deep, and
staring out the window, I waited for

the report. A lot rode on that
groundhog. If only he would not see
his shadow, then spring would be
here, and Ma wouldn't have to sell
me to the gypsies. How disappoint
ed those gypsies were that winter!
Ma wouldn't sell me for another
two years.
That's what it was all about.
Sacrifices made and avoided. Back
in the scrummy days of yore the
wise men who came to see the
Groundhog on that first Ground
hog Day. sacrificed many weeks of
their time, hardly resting, following
the star to where the Groundhog
lay. And when those wise men
heard the promise of the Ground
hog — that winter would be no

more because he had seen no shad
ow —they rejoiced. And those peo
ple on the first Groundhog Day,
how all of them rejoiced! Not
because corporations told them to,
but because they were happy.
Although many starved to death in
the weeks to come, as winter saw fit
to continue through May that year,
the February feast provided those
people with the gift of camaraderie
and consumption. And thats what
life is all about.
All that is lost, I say. Now the
Groundhog Day Parade comes
even before Christmas is over. The
huge conglomerates are attacking
us on all sides. They have made
Groundhog Day meaningless and

empty, when really it's no less
important than Easter or Arbor
Day.
And what's worse is all these
roustabouts, slugabeds and earth
muffins are making it seem more
trivial. For instance, these people
keep yammering on about Presi
dents' Day and Valentine's Day and
Black History Month. Like any of
that is as important as Groundhog
Day. Tish and piffle! If those dun
derheads wanted to celebrate those
things, let 'em. Just don't take away
my Groundhog Day.

Mr. Constantinople doesn 't feel the need to
write something wacky here. Why is this
space here, anyway ?
