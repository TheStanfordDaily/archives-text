# Where's Adolf?
## 
### 
Hidden in this picture of
Persian soldiers is an evil
German dictator. Can you
spot him? Hint: He's wear
ing a swastika.
Other things to look for:
• A careless Cuban dictator
has lost his head. Can you
see where it is?
• There's a man with a
spear. What color is it?
• The horse is quoting poet
ry. Can you recognize the
poem?
• There are no women in
this picture. Can you spot
the patriarchy?
