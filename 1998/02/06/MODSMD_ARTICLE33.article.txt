# Daily begins new volume
## 
### Lord Strawberry Tatum 
This week ushered in a new
volume at The Stanford Daily. The
old volume of one cubic centime
ter was replaced by a new volume
of R(XX) feet cubed.
The old volume made The
Daily the densest material in the
universe. Whereas this quality
made it a highly efficient paper
weight, some felt that it wasn't a
good trade-off for the cramped
quarters.
"The new volume certainly is
a lot more roomy," said Marjorie
Catalog. "It's difficult to type
when you're fingers are practically
the same substance as someone
else's ear."
The new editor in chief is
pleased with the reform, "Finally,
there's enough room to swing a
cat," she said, swinging a brown cat
above her head. "I hate cats."
