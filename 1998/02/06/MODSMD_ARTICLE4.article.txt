If precautions fail, Christofferson
said that "storm watch" crews will
be patrolling campus during heavy
rain throughout the week to identify
and quickly remedy problems such
as standing water and blocked
drains.
University President Gerhard
Casper told the senate that he has
confidence in Stanford's resilience.
"We will weather the next
storm," he said, drawing chuckles.
Full damage assessments from
Tuesday's storm will not be finished
