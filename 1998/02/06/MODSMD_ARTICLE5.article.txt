### Kelly Young Editorial staff 
As he enters a dark room with a nearly overpowering
musty smell, he thicks under the plastic tubing of temporary
ventilation systems. No one ever called his job glamorous.
Especially not this week.

After I uesday morning's flotxiing. Facilities Manager
Chris (hristofferson and his team have been working around
the clock to repair damage, and to attempt to ptevent more
from a second wave ol storms.
( hristofferson drives his white Facilities' Jeep around
campus to keep tabs on efforts and keeps the radio tuned to
the local weather station, preparing tor the worst. Forecasters
predicted an additional 4 to 5 inches of rain were to hit the
area last night.
"It's really an around-the-clock operation." he said. Yes
terday. facilities set up a 24-hour emergencv hotline lor build
inn managers to report any future damage.

Facilities and library staff are beginning to feel the fatigue.
"We're actually staggering shifts." ( 'hristofferson said. He
finally sent some of his ke\ personnel home to rest yesterday .
Christofferson is quite modest about his efforts He credit
ed the librarians for the attempt to rescue many of the 120.(XK)
water-damaged books
"I've never in my career seen a group of people who pitch
in st> willingly." he said.
(irecn I ibrary staff members have set up camp opposite
the circulation desk around the computers. One bov. whose
mother is part of the Green staff,
cuddled up in his sleeping bag while
she read him a bedtime story. Oth
ers took breaks with Snake Lights
and tools still in hand.
Deputy University Librarian
Karen Nagy said it may be possible
to reopen the upper floors of Green
soon, but only after the emergency
has past.
"They can't keep doing emer
gency management and expect to run
the operation," Nagy said. "In my
mind. Saturday would be fine if we

could do it. but if these weather re
ports are real, and we've got some
vulnerability issues... 1 don't know."
Restoration Management Com
pany. a Fremont-based business,
was working on restoring power to
Green even at 8 p.m. last night, two
nights after the flooding occurred.
" The safety of the collection is
paramount," Christofferson said.
" That means we have to adjust our
approach."
Crews are using power tools with
special vacuums and hanging plastic
sheets along the bookshelves to
avoid contaminating the collection
with dust.
In Braun Music Library, facilities

personnel and library staff had just
finished removing the carpet. Braun
was not the only building that needs
to be recarpeted â€” both Green and
the School of Education had severe
water damage.
To prepare for the storm, crews
finished building retaining walls
with sand bags around vulnerable
areas of Green and the School of
Education yesterday. Facilities staff
were also preparing to move a truck
full of extra sandbags to the area for
emergency purposes.
"Sometime during the course of
the night, we're going to find out
how effective this has all been,"
Christofferson said.
