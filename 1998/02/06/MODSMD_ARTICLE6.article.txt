# Students hope to restart SWOPSI
## 
### Jennifer Godwin Contributing writer 
If a small group of students get?
its way. the Stanford Workshop or
Political and Sixial Issues may re
turn to campus, encouraging ac
tivism and politics in Stanford's
academic environment.
SWOPSI was originally a part
of campus Jlife from 1969 to 1991.
An a planning meeting in
Tresidder I ? nion last night, seniors
Anat ("aspi and Darlene Damm. as
well as two other interested stu
dents. gathered to discuss their
plans for the new SWOPSI. They
said they hoped the group will
focus student and faculty attention
on recognizing, studying and
proposing solutions to problems at
Stanford and in the world outside.
C'aspi said she believes "Stan
ford has not really allowed us to
participate in the entire process of
choosing issues and choosing di
rection. A professor proscribes a
perspective. A lot of classes allow
discussion, but you're still not
choosing the material studied.''
Damm added. "Choosing
makes the difference between a
passive and an active education.
With a passive education, it's al
most like you're being processed
by the system."
According to C'aspi, several
professors are already interested.
"The professor will be a facilita
tor. as well as the students." she
said. "SV\ OPSI is meant to engage
professors who are willing and re
ceptive to learning from and en
gaging their students."
The group also hopes to en
courage graduate students to par
ticipate in undergraduate educa
tion.
During the original incarnation
of SWOPSI. professor-led semi
nars met on a weekly basis, but the
majority of the work was done by
individual student research, field
work and interviews.
"What you would do in the
classes is study a problem and then
propose a solutio," Damm said.
"For example, in 1971 students
wanted to try to solve the drug
problem on campus, so they start
ed a peer counseling program that
became The Bridge."
Caspi said she hopes to revive
the group as a way of "giving stu
dents the chance to follow their
own path." She said she has heard
of several attempts to restart the
group over the past year-and-a
half.
"There are various myths that
circulate about |SWOPSI|, espe
cially in the co-op scene. It's been a
recurrent theme in my past four
years here."
Dedicated to political and social
consciousness, SWOPSI originated
in the student activism of the l%Os.
"Students were questioning the
legitimacy of their education,"
Damm said. "There were so many
problems at that time: Vietnam,
earlier the Civil Rights movement,
the threat of nuclear war. SW( )PSI
was a way of academizing their ac
tivism and [their 1 need to change
the world."
The program was established by
Robert Jaffe and Joel Primack,
graduate students at Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center, and Joyce
Kobayashi. a member of the ASSIJ
Council of Presidents.
Stanford Taiko and the women's
self-defense programs were also re
sults of SWOPSI classes. Accord
ing the Stanford Taiko biography,
the group was "inspired by a
SWOPSI class taught bv former
San Jose Taiko member Susan
Havashi. [ Two students]. Ann Islii
maru and Valerie Mill, [then] ap
plied for an Undergraduate Re
search Opportunity grant and built
their first ()daiko, a large drum."
