If a small group of students get?
its way. the Stanford Workshop or
Political and Sixial Issues may re
turn to campus, encouraging ac

academic environment.
SWOPSI was originally a part
of campus Jlife from 1969 to 1991.

professors who are willing and re

individual student research, field
work and interviews.
"What you would do in the
classes is study a problem and then
propose a solutio," Damm said.
