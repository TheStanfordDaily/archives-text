■ Early treatment is most
effective

and blood; Men: urine and
blood
An Ounce of Prevention
Prevention is more effective
than treatment. And individuals
without symptoms can transmit
STD's, so:'
■ Abstaining from sexual
contact eliminates risk.
When sexually active:
■ Form a monogamous rela
tionship.
■ Get yourself and your part
ners) tested when appmpriate.
■ Alcohol and other drugs lower
inhibitions and impair judg
ment, which increases risk.
■ Use a new latex barrier (con
doms and dental dams) every
time until you are sure of no
risk.
■ Nonoxynol-9 preparations
reduce transmission.
■ Condoms may not protect
against STD's which are
transmitted by touching.
■ Talk openly to your partner
about protection. Your health
and well-being are worth it.
