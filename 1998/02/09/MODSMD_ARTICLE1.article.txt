While some Stanford students celebrated a day off
from classes last week due to heavy rain and Hooding,
many residents of East Palo Alto found their homes ru
ined by flood water.
Several groups of Stanford students responded to the
need for volunteers by spending an evening with East
Palo Alto community members, shoveling sand into
bags at the City Corporation Yard on Demeter Street.
The sandbags were used to block flood water from seep
ing into homes.
Junior Katie Noyes headed to East Palo Alto on
Tuesday after receiving several e-mails requesting help
to deal with the flooding. Noyes, who participated in an
Alternative Spring Break program in East Palo Alto last
year, called Manuel Herrera, who coordinates many
volunteer efforts in East Palo Alto, to ask how she could
help.
After hearing from Herrera, Noyes and her friends
went to the East Palo Alto City Hall.
" They asked us how we felt about sandbagging, and
we said, 'sure,' " Noyes said. "There was a huge line of
people to get sandbags. One lady had had surgery and
couldn't (fill her own bags]."
Sophomore Radha Natarajan spent two evenings in
East P;ilo Alto, shoveling sand and helping to prepare
the emergency shelter kitchen in anticipation of a large
dinner crowd. Like Noyes, Natarajan decided to help
after receiving e-mails calling for volunteers.
"They needed people, and I feel like Stanford
doesn't help as much as it should in East Palo Alto,"
Natarajan said. "There's a responsibility that comes
along with living in a privileged community."
"On Thursday, sandbagging was good because the
whole community was together," Natarajan added.
"Everybody was motivated, and that was evident in the
atmosphere."
Some volunteers said they were concerned about
being perceived by residents of East Palo Alto as out
siders seeking to "save" those in need.
Stanford students coming into another community
and trying to help creates a sensitive situation, Noyes
said. "[Although] it felt good to feel like you could help
people, it was a little nerve-wracking — you don't want
to be seen as an imposition."
The members of the East Palo Alto community
"know more what they need than we know what they
need," Natarajan said.
"[As a volunteer], you definitely stick out like a sore
thumb," Noyes said. "[However], we worked with city
men. and we got a positive response. By the end of the
day they were thanking us. It's important to talk to peo
ple you're working with."
Helping to shovel sand "made it very real —the jux
taposition of students playing in the rain [at Stanford]
and these residents of East Palo Alto shoveling sand,
their homes ruined." said sophomore Kathy Wiatt, who
added that she. too. played in the rain last week.
"It felt good doing what needed to be done." Wiatt
said. "At the same time, it made me aware of the fact
that I don't do enough."
She said she worked side by side with three young
children who had been making sandbags for six hours.
