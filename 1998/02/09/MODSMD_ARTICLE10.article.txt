FOR THE RECORD
An article in Friday's Daily inaccurately stated that
University President Gerhard Casper condemned the actions of
the Sixth Man Club at the UCLA men's basketball game. Casper
was actually referring to the club's actions at the basketball game
against the University of Arizona.
An article in Thursday's Daily stated that the coordina
tors of Black Liberation Month will be holding a poster contest.
Actually, the event's organizers have selected 20 prominent black
leaders and designed fliers about them. Through their e-mail list,
students will have to guess who the leaders are.
