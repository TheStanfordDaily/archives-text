Midshipman's testimony challenged
FORI WORIH, lexas (AP) — Unraveling Diane Zamora's youthful, innocent
image, prosecutors have called a parade of witnesses who said the former N;iv;il Acade
my midshipman told them she helped kill a girl who had a fling with her boyfriend.
But every account by Diane Zamora's friends was vastly different, potentially c;isi
ing doubt on them and on a damning confession she gave to police.
I hat is the card defense attorneys will try to play as they begin presenting their case
today in Diane Zamora's murder trial.
"We're going to show that the statement Diane made to police could not have been
accurate and was given under duress," lead defense attorney John Linebarger s;iid in
court last week. "She did not commit capital murder."
Adrianne Jones was killed in December 1995. By the following September, when
Zamora and boyfriend David Graham were charged, she was a freshman at the N;iv;il
Academy and he was in his first year at the Air Force Academy. Graham will be tried
this summer. Both could face the death penalty if convicted. Prosecutors have used
Zamora's confession and other evidence to show that she ordered the killing and
helped by hitting her rival over the head.
Marlboro sneaks ammonia into cigarettes
ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — They called it"the secret of Marlboro."
R.J. Reynolds was desperate in the mid-1970s to learn why its leading brand, Win
ston, was losing market share to Philip Morris' Marlboro. So were other tobacco com
panies that were losing out in a ruthlessly competitive business.
"We couldn't figure out what the success of Marlboro was," said David Bernick, an
attorney for Brown & Williamson. "We couldn't figure out why it was that Marlboro
was taking off in sales."
The reason, as it turned out, was ammonia, a chemical that boosted Marlboro's nico
tine "kick" and improved the taste at the same time, according to documents and tes
timony emerging from Minnesota's lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
Ammonia makes the smoke less acidic. That changes a portion of its nicotine into
"free nicotine," a form that is more readily absorbed in the lungs.
