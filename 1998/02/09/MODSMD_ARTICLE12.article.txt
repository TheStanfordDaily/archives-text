# Voters determine gays' inclusion in legislation

### 
AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — It took 20
years of trying before gay rights advocates won
passage of a law last spring adding sexual ori
entation to the list of protected categories in
Maine's Human Rights Aet.
Tomorrow, voters will decide whether to
uphold a "people's veto" of the new law — a
petition bearing more than SK,(NK) signatures
uppuiiui; the mcaiuu.'. .
An independent statewide poll last month
'found close to two-thirds support for the law in
Maine. Hut because the issue is the only one on
the ballot in a special midwinter election, a low
turnout could sway the outcome.
"People need to vote," savs state Rep.
Michael Ouint. a Democrat from Portland who
is gay. "We need to clearly send a message
once and for all and defeat this referendum."
After the petition drew enough signatures
to call the referendum, the gay rights law was
put on hold in September just one day before it
was to take effect.
The repeal campaign, led by an alliance of
the Christian Civic League of Maine and the

Christian Coalition of Maine, says the legisla
tion is unnecessary, bestows special rights on
an undeserving group, and would undermine
traditional societal values and morality.
"Discrimination is not necessarily a bad
thing, the concept of discrimination," civic
league director Michael Heath said during a
radio call-in show. "It's appropriate to discrim
uuoc iUUii)l5UjT< Migdc )I ng."
The 25-year-old Maine Human Rights Act
bars discrimination against various classifica
tions of people in employment, housing, public
accommodations and credit. Among its classifi
cations are race, color, sex, religion, national
origin and physical or mental disability.
"It does not extend special rights. It does not
require quotas," says Patricia Ryan, the direc
tor of the Maine Human Rights Commission
which administers the law.
Pen states have gay-rights statutes, includ
ing Maine's five neighbors in New England.
Maine's largest city. Portland, has had an
infrequently invoked gay-rights ordinance
since IW2.
