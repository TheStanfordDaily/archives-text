True campus dialogue
involves open-minded
approach to Reed

RALPH REED, former execu
tive director of the Christian
Coalition will speak at Stanford
tonight. However, some members of
the Stanford community are wondering
why we are spending ASSU Speaker's
Bureau funds to listen to a person who
condemns homosexuality as immoral.
But it is the ASSU's job to broaden
dialogue on contemporary issues by
allowing the expression of a variety of
views.
Reed and the Christian Coalition are
known nationwide for their staunch
right-wing viewpoints, their support for
the Republican party and their attacks
on such issues as abortion and homo
sexuality.
Students at Stanford possess a range
of political views. Thus it is important
that ASSU invite speakers who can
expose students to a broad spectrum of
beliefs. Nonetheless, we recognize that
some community members may object
to providing a forum for those, like
Reed, who have a history of promoting
intolerance.

We believe that while Reed's words
may draw criticism, his visit should not.
Stanford encourages its students to use
critical thinking skills to formulate their
own moral codes. People need to hear
the views of both those who uphold and
condemn their values. Our standards
and opinions are powerful only when
we understand and challenge the oppo
sition.
Many students will undoubtedly
applaud Reed for his efforts to bring
religious values into politics and for his
stand on family values. Others will sure
ly denounce him for his homophobia
and his attacks on abortion.
We applaud the ASSU for sponsor
ing such a provocative speaker and
encourage the Speaker's Bureau to be
more aggressive in bringing controver
sial figures to campus.
While the liberal and conservative
factions on campus e-mail invitations to
each other about the event — ensuring
that Reed will receive an audience of
broad political spectrum tonight — we
see the fruits of substantive political dis
course beginning even before Reed has
arrived.
Only when we have participated in a
dialogue involving opposing perspec
tives will be able to solidify our own
views.
