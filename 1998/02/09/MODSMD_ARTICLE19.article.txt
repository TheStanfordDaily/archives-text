## A
						flood of community support 
### 
LAST TUESDAY 1
received a 2:45 a.m.
phone call from
Geoffrey Cox. vice
provost for institutional
planning. Cox informed
me that the basement of
Green Librarv was flood-

ing and asked me to mobilize students to
save as many books as possible from water
damage. As dean of students and resident
fellow in the all-frosh Junipero house. I was
optimistic that students would rise to this
challenge.
After I had gotten off the phone, 1 real
ized it was 3:00 a.m. 1 knew many students
had midterms on Wednesday morning. 1 got
a little nervous.
As I walked down Junipero's first-floor
hallway, 1 noticed an open door. The room
belonged to Matt Blythe, Junipero's resi
dent computer coordinator and a member
of Sigma Epsilon fraternity. I informed him
of the situation at Green and asked him if
he would help. He responded with a
resounding "Yes!"
It then dawned on me that one of Matt's
fraternity brothers. Brad Rodrigues, was
president of the Interfraternity Council. I
called Brad and asked him if he would con
tact other fraternity and sorority presidents
to get their members to assist us at Green.
Brad agreed to do his best.
After recruting one more resident and
two more students from the computer clus
ter, I noticed 10 Junipero students gathered
on the first floor, ready to depart for Green.
That was when 1 realized that something
special was happening.

Back in the coiucc. I c.i ;v. ot:•*: Kl's to
recruit more students V':-e rw.v."< I cot

When I arrived at the Itbran I :\<r:
aback. People in the lobb\ were r<Kv.ric
books into boxes; others had formed
human chain heading do\sn the mam suir
well to the basement. Students were trans
porting books from the basement to the
lobby via this human chain.
I descended to the basement and imme
diately realized the gravity of the situation.
The entire floor was submerged in 8 inches
of brown water. The only light came from
flashlights and a few emergency generator
lights. About 1(X) people in the basement
were removing soaked books from bottom
shelves in hopes of having them restored.
All of these books were wet and extremely
heavy; many of the bookcovers were soggy,
ripped and falling apart at the seams.
University Librarian Mike Keller was
circulating thoughout the library doing his
best to organize the recovery operation. In
one area of the basement, the water had
risen to the third shelf, requiring students to
remove thousands of books from one single
area alone. In another room, students were
lifting heavy metal shelves loaded with
microfiche. The scene in the basement
seemed surreal — straight out of a Holly
wood disaster film!
Yet, out of this apparent chaos seemed
to rise a common resolve to band together
and make the best of a terrible situation. By
4 a.m.. 150 students, faculty and staff were
working furiously to save some of the Uni

versity's most precious possessions ;t
-books. Hie rescue team included e\er> ne

and good wiL
While last week's flood created great
hardship for man> peor.e a: Stanford and
in the Bay Area, our reaction to it symbol
ized the strength and spirit Of the Stanford
community. By coming together to help
save our books, we showed that we want
future Stanford students to have the same
educational resources as present-day stu
dents. Our teamwork represents the
strong dedication that students, faculty
and staff have to Stanford and to one
another.
Stanford University represents the best
that American higher education has to
offer: the brightest faculty and students,
unlimited educational resources and oppor
tunities, a beautiful campus, a location in
the dynamic and cosmopolitan San Francis
co Bay Area and, until recently, great
weather.
Last week's Cireen Library rescue serves
as a powerful reminder that the spirit and
strength of the Stanford community are also
important attributes that make Stanford a
wonderful place to live and learn.

Marc Wilis is dean of students and an Rlin
Junipero House in Wilbur.
