Open dialogue needed
before Sixth Man stifled
Taking away the Sixth Man's section is
absolutely the wrong thing to do.
Before the Sixth Man existed, the
Maples Pavilion home-court edge was non
existent. Students couldn't get excited as a
unit. Many other schools, such as Duke and
UC-Berkeley, have very organized, loud
student sections that make their home
courts almost impossible for visiting teams
to play well in. Now, as Stanford students
are just beginning to be able to shape the
game, it would be a shame to totally remove
our edge.
I am in Sixth Man, and I agree that some
of our cheers and taunts may be a little bit
offensive. If that is the case, can't we discuss
the issues rather than succumb to knee-jerk
reactions such as proposals to completely
eradicate us?
Any student has the opportunity to show
up early on that special Saturday morning
to join the Sixth Man club. Rewarding that
extra effort and encouraging those people
who want to make a commitment, on some
level, to coming to all of the home games
and making more noise to support the team
seems only natural to me.
If President Casper and the rest of the
administration find some of our chants dis
reputable, why don't we discuss it? I'm sure
that, together, we can find room for the

Sixth Man to be loud and supportive with
out tarnishing the University's name or
image. Please don't axe what has become
one of the most exciting and nationally cap
tivating traditions in college sports today.

Reseating would kill
home court advantage
University President Gerhard Casper is
on target when he voices concerns over
sportsmanship and college athletics. Never
theless. I am dismayed at Athletic Director
Ted Leland's decision to explore the option
of removing the preferred seating that the
Sixth Man Club currently enjoys.
Leland ought to know that Sixth Man,
despite the controversy surrounding the
club, adds a desperately needed aspect to
athletics on The Farm: unabashed, unrelen
tant and vociferous student support.
I recall the mob of red-shirted Cardinal
fans struggling to enter Maples Pavilion
before the UCLA and Arizona games ...
some 6(X>-strong on each occasion, includ
ing a hearty few who began lining up four
days prior to the game. Comparing that to
the usual condition of student support
(where a few students show up to games,
watch quietly and leave early). I think that

the decision of breaking up the Sixth Man
seating area ought to be a no-brainer.

Drug taunts aimed at
McCoy were justfied
As a member of Sixth Man for three
straight seasons, I will concede that Sixth
Man may occasionally cross the lines of
civility and decency. However, the taunting
of UCLA's Jelani McCoy was not uncalled
for. McCoy's drug suspension was public
knowledge; by engaging in illegal behavior,
he hurt his university and made a mockery
of college basketball. If drug use and other
"unsportsman-like" behavior are not causes
for critcism. then what is?
Stanford basketball is a budding pro
gram. We have a top 10 ranking, a good
shot at winning the Pacific 10 Conference
and a chance at recruiting some of the top
players in the nation. Sixth Man's rowdy
behavior has undeniably given our basket
ball program more media coverage. As a
result, our basketball team looks more
attractive to recruits who want media cover
age and appreciate strong fan support.
Moving Sixth Man will result in a
decrease in student attendance and cheer
ing at games. Seeing a bunch of raucous fans

standing courtside gets the players pumped
up. There is a reason our team had a 20-
game unbeaten streak in Maples Pavilion,
and it's not the passive alumni.
Politieal correctness has already gone
too far at Stanford. It is my hope that the
University will realize that Sixth Man bene
fits the students and the team with minimal
harm to others. Mr. Leland's office may
have made an error by approving the Notre
Dame script, but he should not try to recti
fy the mistake by punishing the enthusiastic
students in Sixth Man.

Don't crush spirit in
the name of civility
I have held season tickets in the student
section for men's basketball each of the past
11 seasons. Let me assure President Casper
and Ted Leland that the practice of taunting
opposing players did not start with the Sixth
Man Club. To suggest the club be disband
ed is absurd.
So is the suggestion that the Sixth Man
Club be moved in order to accommodate
other students. Every student has the
opportunity to be a part of the club and sit
closer to the action. The same individuals
would occupy the floor-level section if the
previous system — where students lined up

hours before the game to get the best seats
— were reinstituted.
President Casper has consistently
acknowledged his indifference toward ath
letics since assuming his position five years
ago. The fact remains that the athletic
department continues to be a source of
pride for the students, alumni and the uni
versity community. The Sixth Man Club
reflects the enthusiasm of the Stanford stu
dent body. The media and all of college bas
ketball has noticed the excitement of bas
ketball at Maples Pavilion and the role of
the Sixth Man Club in this excitement.
Students should certainly use some dis
cretion when taunting the opposition. Hut it
would be a sad day at Stanford if, in the
name of "civility." students could no longer
sit next to the basketball court and. when
necessary, call a Weenie a "Weenie."
