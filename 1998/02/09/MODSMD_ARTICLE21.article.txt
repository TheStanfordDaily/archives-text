## The 						personal price of focusing on success

AT TIMES THERE are experiences
that linger in your mind, cause you
to question and force you to learn.
I had one of those experiences when I
recently entered the inner sanctum of the
ASSU — the one Stanford institution in
which I've never even remotely had interest.
To the best of my knowledge, the ASSU
doled out money to groups, had boring meet
ings and littered the campus with junk during
election season. But there I was, working on
a problem set in the middle of it all.
A girl in the corner was laughing loudly
on the phone, legs propped up on a desk. A
class president proclaimed her dismay that a
company had "dinged" her for a second -
round interview, her first rejection
unheard of. Both then proceeded to discuss
interview schedules and favorite companies.
That was when I began to hate the ASSU.

Meanwhile, an ASSU official I'll call "Joe"
attempted to help me on my problem set.
"How do you know this so well, Joe?" He
seemed to have an above-average grasp of
the concepts — unusual given the sometimes
cryptic teaching of the professor and the rel
ative complexity of the class.
"Well," he said sheepishly, "I'm actually
retaking this elass."
Cool. I've been there, done that.
"Why, what did you get?"
"Urn, an A-minus."
That was when I really started to hate Joe.
He then proceeded to explain the impor
tance of grades for getting in to business
school and how he never really learned the
class material the first time around. Yeah,
right. He was grasping it pretty well if he
knew how to explain it to someone else.
An ASSU official, "Ben." then interject-

Ed that a 3.5 and good experiences would be
fine for business school.
"Think if you have a 3.9 plus everything
else," Joe said. "And I'm still thinking about
law school — you need good grades." This
was starting to hit tin) close to home. I had
sent off my law school applications a few
weeks earlier. I stared intently at the impos
sible problem set before me and began to
feel a bit hot.
Ben conceded the importance of good
grades, and the conversation died down.
"Yeah. g(x>d grades definitely don't hurt. A
3.9 is impressive." That was when I started to
hate myself. I didn't understand the problem
set question. I don't have any job offers or
interviews. I don't have a sexy position at the
ASSU. My grades are nowhere near a 3.9;
getting an A-minus in this class would make
me laugh in my sleep.

"Are you okay? You l<x)ked stressed,"
Joe asked.
The entire time that I was there, none of
the six ASSU people in the room performed
a task even remotely related to the ASSU.
Up until that moment I had thought that
Montoya had done a great job of picking kids
who were smart but still knew how to have a
good time. I thought he had weeded out
most of the anal ones, or at least restricted
them to premed departments. It's not that
the ASSU-types aren't nice or aren't willing
to help you. but they also tend to subscribe
fully to the edict of looking good on paper.
1 wrote this description of my ASSU
experience a week and a half ago. The light
hearted tone of the anecdote belies the
impact it had on my thoughts.
Recently, someone close to me passed
away. And it made me think a lot about

these words. Despite my assertion that I still
had my values in perspective, I had let my
experience at the ASSU change me.
Very subtly, my insecurities and determi
nation to "succeed" started to be defined by
those standards. I started to spend more time
studying and just a little less time with the
people I cared about. I made the choice to go
to the library instead of my family's Chinese
New Year dinner. I cut short another family
function to work on my first column. I decid
ed to study for a midterm instead of heading
home for my usual visit. Since then. I have
regretted each of those decisions.
Friends, family and work — somewhere
there is a balance between conventional suc
cess and truly living.
