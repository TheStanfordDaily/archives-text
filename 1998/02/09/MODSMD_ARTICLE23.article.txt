## Weenies march way to defeat in painful game against Card 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Everyone who was at Maples
Pavilion Friday night would
probably be quite happy if they
could erase the first 25 minutes
of the game between the sixth
ranked Stanford women's bas
ketball team and Bay Area-rival
California.
With 15 minutes left in the
eontest the score was 42-24. and
Stanford and Cal were on pace
for a Cardinal record — one for
lowest combined point total in a
Pacific 10 Conference game.
But from the 15-minute mark
on. both teams picked it up. Cal
more than doubled its point total

from the first 25 minutes, and
Stanford chipped in almost 40
more as the overpowering ('ardi-

nal walked away with the 79-51
win.
"I thought we did a much bet
ter job in the second half taking
care of the ball." said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We got some transition baskets
and got our inside game going. It
was a little bit of a Jekyll and
Hyde, first half-second half.
With Kristin [Folkl] out.

Olympia [Scott] and Heather
[Owen) both knew they had to
carry the load inside, and they
did very well."
But before all that, the scoring
was anything but prolific. The
halftime mark of 33-20 set new
season lows for the Card in
points scored and points allowed
by an opponent.
Stanford (13-5. 9-1 Pac-10)
jumped out to a 5-2 lead before
going on a three-minute scoring
drought. The Golden Bears (5-
15. 1-9) used that time to take an
8-5 lead, but that was as good as
it got for Cal.
The Card scored 14of the next
16 points and went on a 22-6 run
to take a 27-14 lead with 4:47 re

maining on two free throws from
Owen, a senior forward.
Despite shooting a dismal 3K
percent from the field and com
mitting nine turnovers, Stanford
took a 13-point lead into the
locker room. Cal, meanwhile,
made just seven field goals in the
period and was shooting barely
30 percent from the field.
"1 felt we were playing aggres
sive defensively," VanDerveer
said. "Sometimes when you play
aggressive defense, that gets
people rushing a little bit on of
fense. Hut the turnovers, to me, it
really is hard to watch some of
the decisions people are mak
ing."
When play resumed in the sec
ond half, Scott look over. Scott
led all scorers and rebounders at
the break with 12 points and seven
boards, while Owen added seven
of each.
But when the second half got
under way, Scott made the game
her own highlight film. Scott got
the feed from sophomore point
guard Milena Flores for a layup at
the 9:05 mark to cap a streak of 14
straight points for the senior cen
ter and give Stanford a 59-32 edge.
At that point the Cardinal had
a 27-point lead in the game, but
the second-half score read:
Olympia Scott 16. California 12.
Scott went on to score 20 of her
game high 32 points (one point off
her career high) in the second half
as Stanford began to cruise.
"I think [the guards) figured
out how to get the ball to us a little

better," Scott said. "They started
working the ball around, and we
were getting the best shot and get
ting good ball movement and that
helped a lot."
Owen was the only other Cardi
nal player in double figures with 13
points to go along with a career
high 11 boards for the double-dou
ble. The statistics were telling as
Flores had eight assists, compared
to Cal's team total of seven.
Cal shot just 39 percent from
the field; Stanford shot 46 percent
(56 in the second half). The Bears
were 0 for 5 from three-point land
and committed 23 turnovers,
while Stanford was 22 of 27 from
the charity stripe (51.5 percent)
and shot almost 40 percent from
behind the arc.
"For us it's IS Pac-10 games,
and a win against Cal is just as
good as a win against anybody
else," VanDerveer said. "It's a
'W' for us to stay in first place or
get a game up on somebody. We
really need to take advantage of
every game opportunity."
