## Weenies march way to defeat in painful game against Card 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Everyone who was at Maples
Pavilion Friday night would
probably be quite happy if they
could erase the first 25 minutes
of the game between the sixth
ranked Stanford women's bas
ketball team and Bay Area-rival
California.
With 15 minutes left in the
eontest the score was 42-24. and
Stanford and Cal were on pace
for a Cardinal record — one for
lowest combined point total in a
Pacific 10 Conference game.
But from the 15-minute mark
on. both teams picked it up. Cal
more than doubled its point total

from the first 25 minutes, and
Stanford chipped in almost 40

win.
"I thought we did a much bet
ter job in the second half taking
care of the ball." said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We got some transition baskets
and got our inside game going. It
was a little bit of a Jekyll and

With Kristin [Folkl] out.

Olympia [Scott] and Heather
[Owen) both knew they had to
carry the load inside, and they
did very well."
But before all that, the scoring
was anything but prolific. The
halftime mark of 33-20 set new
season lows for the Card in
points scored and points allowed
by an opponent.
Stanford (13-5. 9-1 Pac-10)
jumped out to a 5-2 lead before
going on a three-minute scoring
drought. The Golden Bears (5-
15. 1-9) used that time to take an
8-5 lead, but that was as good as
it got for Cal.
The Card scored 14of the next
16 points and went on a 22-6 run
to take a 27-14 lead with 4:47 re

maining on two free throws from
Owen, a senior forward.
Despite shooting a dismal 3K
percent from the field and com
mitting nine turnovers, Stanford
took a 13-point lead into the
locker room. Cal, meanwhile,
made just seven field goals in the
period and was shooting barely
30 percent from the field.
"1 felt we were playing aggres

said. "Sometimes when you play
aggressive defense, that gets
people rushing a little bit on of
fense. Hut the turnovers, to me, it
really is hard to watch some of
the decisions people are mak
