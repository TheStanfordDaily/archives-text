# For Bears, success is still years away
## Weenies aren't even close to contenders 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
At least it wasn't a 51-point
blowout.
Still, it was painfully apparent
from Friday night's 79-51 loss at
Maples Pavilion that California (5-
15, 1-9 Pacific lo Conference) is
eons away from building itself to
the expectation level that head
coach Marianne Stanley envisioned
when she took the Golden Bear
head coaching job two years ago.
It wasn't so much the 28-point
margin of defeat as it was the way
Cal just fell apart in the second half.
The Bears actually were giving the
sixth-ranked ('ardinal (13-5,9-1) a
run for its money, leading 8-5 early
and down by only 13 points at the
half.
All right, so the Bears weren't
exactly lighting it up from the floor
(a meager 7 for 23 from the field in
the first half), but the array of de
fenses presented by Cal forced six
steals and limited the Cardinal to
38-percent shooting.
"The thing about playing Cal is
that you honestly don't know what
to do to get ready for them," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "You never know what
they're going to do against you
they could come out with a
matchup, a box-and-one or a trap. I
think that's a credit to Marianne in
that she's very creative."
However, everything else was
extremely ominous. Complement
ing the bad shooting was the 15
first-hall turnovers toonly three as
sists. But it was bound to improve,
wasn't it?
Yeah, right.
The first 10 minutes of the sec
ond stanza netted as many field
goals as turnovers (four). In fact,
senior center Olympia Scott alone
outscored Cal 12-10 as Stanley
grew increasingly flabbergasted on
the sidelines.
There are still some encourag

ing signs amid the rubble of a sea
son the Bears are going through.
The freshman elass that was rated
14th best in the eountry last year
did play like freshmen, although
guard Kenya Corley did post 12
points on 4-of-5 shooting.
"She came down the first two
times down the court and had
wide-open shots and she wouldn't
take them — that's being a fresh
man." Stanley said. "So we talked
to her and she goes hack out there
and goes 4 for 5 and has 12 points.
She's an electrifying scorer who
can score in bunches."
Obviously, the turnaround
wasn't going to happen overnight
predecessor Clooch Foster
made sure of that, guiding the
Bears to a 10-44 conference mark
in her final three seasons. Howev
er. for Stanley, who is so used to
success (three national champi
onships and 13 postseason appear
ances in 18-plus seasons of coach
ing). it has to be distressing to
watch a team coached by her strug
gle mightily.
"Our biggest problems are not
defensive, they're offensive," Stan
ley said. "It's striking we had 12
missed shots inside of 15 feet. We
know they're makeable; the kids
are trying. We're just missing them.
It's like being in a batting slump
you don't stop swinging the bat he
cause you're striking out. You look
at your technique and you try to
keep your confidence, and you
keep swinging."
All part of the growing pains in
the rebuilding of a program. After
a game like this, how else can it be
labeled?
"We just talked about it." Stan
ley said. "I said. 'Look. I want you
to stay away from basketball for
two days. 1 his is the only weekend
we have to just rest, so just do not
touch a basketball. Ihe idea is to
not dwell on this and get away from
it so they can come back enthused
for Monday's practice."
