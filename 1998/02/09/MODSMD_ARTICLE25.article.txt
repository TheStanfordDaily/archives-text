### Gil Lopez Staff writer

swer for the extremely physical style
of play they encountered Saturday at
Gampel Pavilion.

■ Saturday: Connecticut 76. Stan
ford 56

No. 7 Connecticut (21-3) pressed,
trapped and pushed its way t< > a 76-56
romp over the No. 9 Cardinal
who suffered its third loss in the last
four games after beginning the sea
son 18-0. Stanford still maintained
second place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference by a half-game over its next
opponent. UCLA.
The Big East Conference-leading
Huskies forced IS Stanford
turnovers and held the Cardinal t<i
31-percent shcxiting — its lowest
mark of the season. The 56 points art
also the fewest points scored by the
team all year.
" That was an exquisite basketbal
game for us. 1 couldn't ask for mucl
more." Connecticut coach Jim Cal
houn said. "We normally use our de
fense to create our offense and that'
what happened. We knew the;
would be tired after coming acros
the country so instead of playing th<
game at 12 feet where they wantec
to. we played at feet."
The Huskies used an aggressivi
full-court trap, something the Cardi
nal had seen before, but it was Con

necticut's ability to pressure the Car
dinal once the ball had passed half
court that created problems.
After the Husky guards would
force the C ardinal backcourt to pass
the ball upcourt to the big men. Con
necticut's frontcourt would collapse
on the ball handler, forcing p<x)r de
cisions and numerous turnovers.
" People just weren't attacking
today." said junior point guard
Arthur Lee. who led the Cardinal
with 1 7 points and was the only Stan
ford player to score in double digits.
"We were talking about being ag
gressive all week long and nobody's
aggressive. We came out and played
like we just w anted the pressure to go
away, and we didn't do anything
about it."
The big men "weren't taking it to
the basket. ITiev would wait and try
to get it to the guards." Lee said. "It's
not just them, it was everybody. They
were pressing and we just tried to
jack up bad shots, and they just
weren't falling."
Connecticut finished with 12
steals, the most by any Cardinal op
ponent this year.
I he Huskies also did what few op
ponents have thought possible —
dominate the inside game.
The Cardinal held a 17-6 advan
tage on the offensive boards, but
could only translate that into nine
points
"We dropped a lot of balls." said
Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We weren't very strong at
the post in terms of making moves.
"A lot of the offensive rebounds
w ere just superfluous. We would end
up throwing them back outside, and
we would end up not getting anything
out of it."
The Cardinal frontcourt would
pull down a rebound only to have it
slapped away or to be forced to pass it
off to one of the perimeter players,
and that rarely led to any offense.
Juniors Peter Sauer and Kris
Weems, the starters on the wings,
combined for a miserable 2-for-15
performance.
The Cardinal only had 22 points in
the paint. By comparison, Connecti
cut finished with 42.
Much of the problem for the Car
dinal came from the Big East's more
aggressive style of play.
Stanford's big men were not ac
customed to playing such a physical

game, and it showed. However, the
officials were from the Pac-10.
"It was clear that the refs were let
ting a little bit go inside, and I don't
think we recognized that until it was
too late," said sophomore power for
ward Mark Madsen. "This is a very
physical league, and the refs essen
tially said, 'We're going to let you
play.' And they let us play. There
were forearms being thrown to the
chest. There were elbows in the eye."
The Huskies were led by forward
Richard Hamilton, who had a game
high 24 points on 10-of-15 shooting.
Junior center Tim Young pulled
down 12 rebounds for the Cardinal
but only had six points.
"Maybe we're a little overrated
right now." Young said. "We just
have a lot of things to work on. Most
of it is just pressure defense because
our half-court stuff is pretty good
when we get into it."
