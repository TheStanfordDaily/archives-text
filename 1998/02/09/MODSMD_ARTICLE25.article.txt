■ Saturday: Connecticut 76. Stan
ford 56

No. 7 Connecticut (21-3) pressed,
trapped and pushed its way t< > a 76-56
romp over the No. 9 Cardinal
who suffered its third loss in the last
four games after beginning the sea
son 18-0. Stanford still maintained
second place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference by a half-game over its next
opponent. UCLA.
The Big East Conference-leading
Huskies forced IS Stanford
turnovers and held the Cardinal t<i
31-percent shcxiting — its lowest
mark of the season. The 56 points art
also the fewest points scored by the
team all year.
" That was an exquisite basketbal
game for us. 1 couldn't ask for mucl
more." Connecticut coach Jim Cal
houn said. "We normally use our de
fense to create our offense and that'
what happened. We knew the;
would be tired after coming acros
the country so instead of playing th<
game at 12 feet where they wantec
to. we played at feet."
The Huskies used an aggressivi
full-court trap, something the Cardi
nal had seen before, but it was Con

necticut's ability to pressure the Car
dinal once the ball had passed half
court that created problems.
After the Husky guards would
force the C ardinal backcourt to pass
the ball upcourt to the big men. Con
necticut's frontcourt would collapse
on the ball handler, forcing p<x)r de
cisions and numerous turnovers.
" People just weren't attacking
today." said junior point guard
Arthur Lee. who led the Cardinal
with 1 7 points and was the only Stan
ford player to score in double digits.
"We were talking about being ag
gressive all week long and nobody's
aggressive. We came out and played
like we just w anted the pressure to go
away, and we didn't do anything
about it."
The big men "weren't taking it to
the basket. ITiev would wait and try
to get it to the guards." Lee said. "It's
not just them, it was everybody. They
were pressing and we just tried to
jack up bad shots, and they just
weren't falling."
Connecticut finished with 12
steals, the most by any Cardinal op
ponent this year.
I he Huskies also did what few op
ponents have thought possible —
dominate the inside game.
The Cardinal held a 17-6 advan
tage on the offensive boards, but
could only translate that into nine
points
"We dropped a lot of balls." said
Cardinal head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We weren't very strong at
the post in terms of making moves.
"A lot of the offensive rebounds
w ere just superfluous. We would end
