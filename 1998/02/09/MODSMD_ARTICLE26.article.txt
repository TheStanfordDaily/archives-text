Despite the loss, the Cardinal *as

third in those events. But Cal's
Evgenii Zherebchevskiv countered
by earning first-place finishes in all of

the events he competed in. In the
ones he didn't, teammates Alex
Chanksky or Josh Birkelbaw filled in
for him with firsts.
"("al is definitely the team to beat
this season." said Stanford head
coach Sadao Hamada. "The team is
loaded with great gymnasts, includ
ing four from foreign countries. Fhev
are probably the favorite to win the
championship again this year."
Friday's meet was the second
time the Cardinal has faced the
Bears and Gauchos this season. The
first was Jan. 31 at Burnham Pavil
ion. where Stanford fared better but
was still trumped by the Bears.
I CSB came in third.
Stanford's score in that meet,
nearly six points better than last
weekend's, reflects the team before
the loss of Miao. whose fractured
wnst will keep him out of action an
other three to four weeks.

will miss the rest of the season.
Even some of the team's mem
bers that can compete have to take it
slow due to injury. In last weekend's
loss at Cal, sophomore Craig Nesbitt,
coming back from a shoulder prob
lem, only competed in four of six
events.
Hamada said the injuries mean
the team is having a tough time.
"We are having to rely on our

younger, less experienced freshmen
and sohpomores," he said. "Our
team is suffering from the lack of
depth."
Don't write the team off yet,
Hamada warned.
"The guys are working hard," he
said. "We're going to see if we can
somehow sneak into the NCAA fi
nals."
The team's next meet is Feb. 21 at
Burnham Pavilion against Cal.
"Hopefully by then we'll have
enough guys to get six people in every
event," Hamada said.
