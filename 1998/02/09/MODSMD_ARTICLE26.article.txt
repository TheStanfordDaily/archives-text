pommel horse and a on the hori
zontal bar. both go*Kl enough for
third in those events. But Cal's
Evgenii Zherebchevskiv countered
by earning first-place finishes in all of

the events he competed in. In the

"("al is definitely the team to beat
this season." said Stanford head
coach Sadao Hamada. "The team is
loaded with great gymnasts, includ
ing four from foreign countries. Fhev
are probably the favorite to win the
championship again this year."

Bears and Gauchos this season. The
first was Jan. 31 at Burnham Pavil
ion. where Stanford fared better but
was still trumped by the Bears.

Stanford's score in that meet,
nearly six points better than last
weekend's, reflects the team before
the loss of Miao. whose fractured
