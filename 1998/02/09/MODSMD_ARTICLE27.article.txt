Just one week ago in a match at Pacific, the two teams
played a much closer match, an 11-15. 15-11,15-13
Stanford win.
Cardinal players attributed
some of the difference between the
two matches to home-court advan
tage, and UOP's top hitter, sopho
more outside hitter Vladimir An
dric, did not play.
The third game of last night's
match was just about as decisive as
it possibly could have been, but
Stanford was strong throughout.
"I'm most happy about winning
all three games convincingly,"
Nieves said.
In addition to superior team
play, several Cardinal players post
ed strong individual efforts. Senior
middle blocker Tad Hoffman hit a
match-high .S46with 11 kills and no
errors. Hoffman also led all players
in blocks, with eight assisted. Even
with these impressive stats. Hoff
man's serve-receive was strongest.
The passing skill that the Cardi
nal showcased helped keep the
Tigers off the scoreboard and gave
Stanford essential sideouts.
Also on the defensive side,
Whitehurst had five digs, while
Hoffman and junior outside hitter
Patrick Klein each added four.
On the offensive side of the
match, four Cardinal players
recorded kills in the double digits.
Sophomore outside hitter Andy
Witt posted a match-high 14 kills.
Klein and Whitehurst each added
13, while Hoffman added 11.
