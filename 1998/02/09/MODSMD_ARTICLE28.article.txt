within three as Joey Coughlan eked out a one-point de
cision over sophomore Zach Zimmcrer in the 126-
pound weight class but did not score again as Stanford
ran off 31 unanswered team points.
After sophomore Jason Talbott
collected a forfeit in the 134-pound
division, senior Beau Weiner scored
a major decision. Weiner nearly
pinned his opponent twice in a match
he dominated from the outset.
"If that kid didn't know what pain
was before that match, he sure does
now," said freshman teammate Jon
Penn.
In their final home matches, se
niors B.J. Sanchez, Doug Bardsley
and Jeff Grant all earned victories.
Though Sanchez and Bardsley are
technically redshirt juniors, they will
probably not wrestle next year.
Sanchez will likely attend law school,
while Bardsley will pursue a career in
engineering.
"Bardsley's being wined and
dined as an engineer," said Stanford
head coach Chris Horpel. "At Stan
ford. we have the unusual problem of
wrestlers graduating on time and not

using their redshirt year."
Grant's match proved the high
light of the evening, as the senior co
captain faced a two-point deficit late
in the third period against Fuller
ton's Jason Webster. With two sec
onds left in the match, he scored a
takedown, sending the match to
overtime. After a scoreless first over
time, Grant lost the coin toss, and
Webster chose bottom.
"It's almost a given that the man
on bottom will escape in the 30 sec
onds allotted," Penn said. "It's your
fifth period of wrestling, you're tired,
so it's assumed that whoever wins
the toss will choose bottom, put on
one last burst of strength and escape
for the win. It takes a lot of determi
nation to ride a guy out for the 30 sec
onds to win."
Grant did just that, smothering
the 15th-ranked Webster for the
double-overtime win.
"We wrestled extremely well and
upset some very good wrestlers,"
Horpel said. "It was a nice tribute to
our three seniors who wrestled in
their last home dual."

Knowing that Fullerton would
forfeit the 177-pound division. Hor
pel shifted senior Shane Cross to 177,
allowing senior co-captain Scott
Chapman to wrestle in the 190-
pound weight class. Chapman won.
as did usual junior 190-pounder Tim
Kendall, who wrestled in the heavy
weight division.
The team then traveled to San
Francisco State for the invitational
Saturday. Stanford placed eight
wrestlers and took second place in
the team standings.
"As I was hoping, we are a much
better tournament team than dual
meet team this year." Horpel said.
Zimmerer took third place, pin
ning two opponents and majoring
another. In the 134-pound weight
class, Talbott's sprained ankle forced
him to drop out. but freshman Stu
White went 3-1, finishing third.
"Stu wrestled as well as I've ever
seen him," Horpel said.
Weiner finished second in the
142-pound division, eventually los
ing the championship match to Scott
Tremblay of San Francisco State.

The strong performances of both se
nior B.J. Sanchez and Warren
McPherson (second and third, re
spectively) in the 150-pound division
clouds the issue of who will start in
the Pacific-10 Conference tourna
ment.
"Both lix)ked tough; we still don't
have a clear picture of who will end
up our starter for the Pac-lOs," Hor
pel said.
Senior co-captains Grant and
Chapman both tw)k second place.
Grant lost in the finals to Webster,
whom he had beaten in overtime the
night before. Chapman injured his
shoulder in the semifinals and lost in
the finals to his opponent from Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo.
"Placing in the top two in Califor
nia was nice," Horpel said. "We were
only a few points behind Cal State-
Bakersfield, who won the tourna
ment. Whether we win or lose our
last two dual meets this week, we are
peaking at the right time. We should
be able to do our best wrestling for
the Pac-10 and NCAA Champi
onships."
