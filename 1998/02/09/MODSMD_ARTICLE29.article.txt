nal, the swimmers took part in
some events they don't usually get
a chance to participate in. Mixing
it up a little added a bit of fun to
the meet for the Stanford team.
"We definitely enjoy swim
ming off events," said freshman
Misty Hyman. "It takes some ol
the pressure off when we don't
have to swim our best events."
This allowed the Longhorns to
record victories in six of the 14
events, hut when all was said and
done, the Stanford women had
won by a comfortable margin of
141-93.
The first event, the 200-yard
medley relay, was somewhat of an
indication of how the afternoon

would go. Although Texas
claimed victory in the event, the
Longhorns were followed closely
by three Stanford squads. All af
ternoon Texas was unable to take
advantage of the events it won be
cause several Stanford swimmers
were usually right behind the lead
ing Longhorn. The depth of the
Cardinal made it impossible for
the Longhorns to make up ground
even when they came away with
the win.
"It's nice to have so many
strong swimmers in each event,"
said sophomore Jessica Tucker-
Mohl.
As always, Hyman was an inte
gral part of the Cardinal's success.
She won both the 200 free (1
minute, 48.35 seconds) and the
500 free (4:48.16), while also
swimming legs on the 200 medley
relay and the 200 free relay, both
of which placed second.
Junior Chantal Rawn also
turned in several fine perfor
mances. She won the 100 free in
51.62 and was also impressive in
winning the 100 breaststroke
(1:08.36), an event she usually
doesn't swim. Rawn also swam on
the second-place 200 free relay.
The overall team performance

was just as impressive as these two
double winners . The remaining
victories in the meet all came from
different swimmers. Senior Evi-
Lynn Byer swam to victory in the
MX) back (57.68), followed by ju
nior Elin Austevoll. Austevoll
also touched first in the 200 breast
stroke in 2:16.09.
Freshman Siobhan Cropper
also made several fine contribu
tions to the team's score. She won
the 1(H) butterfly (56.66) and swam
on both relays. Junior Alison
Fealey also made her mark. She
won the 2(X) individual medley
(2:04.10), took second in the 2(x)
free (1:52.22) and swam the
breaststroke leg on the medley
relay.
"My times were definitely bet
ter than last weekend." Fealey
said. "The team environment as
the big meets draw nearer is really
helpful to all the swimmers."
The final Cardinal victory
came courtesy of senior Lindsay
Gassner. Although she usually
swims the shorter freestyle events,
Gassner turned in an impressive
time of 10:28.47 in the grueling
1.000 free. Coupled with her win
was a second-place finish in the
100 free (53.28).
