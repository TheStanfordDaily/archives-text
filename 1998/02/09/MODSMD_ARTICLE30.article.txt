The win was Stanford's second
and is one more step in the quest to
become a perennial national power.
"Overall, it was a positive experi
ence," said head coach Mark Cook.
"We focused on our game plan and
had a blast."
The Cardinal (2-2, 2-2 Pacific 10
Conference) made vast improve
ments on its team score from last
week's high of 192.85 against Ari
zona and lifted it to 194.3, a good
score at this point in the season.
The Cardinal was led by junior
co-captain Amy Murakami, who
placed fourth in the all-around with
38.875, and senior co-captain Keri
Monahan, who won the vault with
9.825.
The meet went the Cardinal's
way from the beginning. The team
opened on the bars — where it is

currently ranked fourth in the na
tion — and went 6 for 6 in hitting its
routines. Judging was tight, but it
didn't faze the ( ardinal. The squad
was led by Murakami with 9.77.5.
"The meet just started off right."

special importance for Cook, who
worked at IJ( LA for three years as
an assistant coach. Last year he led
many of the current Bruins. includ
ing sophomore Stella Umeh, who
won the all-around with 39.4. to a
national championship.
After the bars was the beam
traditionally the Cardinal's weakest
event. On Saturday, however, the
squad rocked the event with no
falls. Stanford's team score was
48.5. more than an entire point bet
ter than its former high score of
47.225. Sophomore second-team
All-American Larissa Fontaine led
Stanford with a season-high 9.K.
good enough for second place.
For Michigan, the second event
was a heart breaker In the three
minute warmup Katie Nellons rup
tured her Achilles tendon, a season
ending injury. The Wolverines were
clearly shaken as Nellons was led
off the floor.
Cook, however, believes the
Cardinal would have beaten Michi
gan, injury or no injury.
"We were still a better team, and
we had better execution," Cook
said.

The third event was the floor,
and Murakami again led the Cardi
nal with a score of 9.9. Sophomores
Tracey Kohl and Sarah Harding
both posted impressive scores of
9.X25 to help the Cardinal to a team
score of 4K.925. Kohl twisted her
ankle during warmup but competed
anyway and is reportedly fine. The
high score on the floor was surpris
ing since two gymnasts. Harding
and sophomore Kim Young, added
difficulty in their floor tumbling.
Both gymnasts did well with the
new routines and hit their passes.
Rounding off the meet for the
Card was the vault, where Mona

score on vault in the meet.
"We did really well not paying
attention to the other teams or the
judging." Murakami said, "but I
think our intensity may have
dropped a little for the vault."
A drop in intensity or not. the
effort was still good enough to
upset the ninth-ranked Wolverines
and come within one point of the
Bruins.
"It's good to know we gave
UCLA a scare." Murakami said.
"Also since it wasn't the meet of
our lives, we still have room to im
prove and have difficulty to add in
it's not like this was the best we
can be."
