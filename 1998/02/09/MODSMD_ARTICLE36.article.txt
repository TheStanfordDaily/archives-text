I'he top-ranked Stanford men's
swimming team beat No. 5 USC at
McDonald's Swim Stadium on Fri
day Ihe Cardinal had several sea
son best times despite the weather.
El Nino was in full effect this
weekend in Southern California.
Manhole covers were shot off as
the manholes became geysers in
the streets. Ihe rain and the cold
forced the swimmers to focus on
keeping warm and trying to stay
ready to swim. Many of the Stan
lord swimmers stayed in the diving
well to stay loose and warm.

MEN'S SWIMMING
■ Friday: Stanford 148.1 ISC 98
■ Saturday: Stanford ai UC-Santa
Barbara, canceled (rain).

"We went to their home pool
and did all right in adverse weather
conditions." junior Blake Holden
said. "Some guvs handled it very
well." Others turned shades of blue
and purple.
USC opened the meet with a vic
tory in the 400-yard medley relay. It
was the first time this year Stanford
lost the opening relay. In fact, Stan
lord had placed 1 -2 in most of their
meets this year. Hie Cardinal swam
several last legs trying to overcome

the two-second advantage USC's
Lenny Krazelburg gained in the
opening backstroke leg. Holden
had a lifetime-best relay leg in the
breaststroke to bring the Stanford
B team almost even with USC at
the halfway mark. Senior butterfly
er Sabir Muhammad put the Stan
ford A team in front going into the
freestyle leg, but USC's anchor leg
from Bela Zabados was just enough
to gel the Trojans the victory.
Stanford's distance swimmers
(D-men) brought the Cardinal
back in the next event as junior
Matt O'Mara won the 1,000
freestyle in 9 minutes, 7 seconds.
1 hey followed up with a strong
showing in the 200 freestyle. Fresh
man Adam Messner won the event
in a season-best time of 1:37. Junior
Dod Wales took second to capture
a lead that USC was unable to
overcome. Both Stanford swim
mers beat Zabados, a former
NCAA champion in this event.
Stanford's 50 freestylers were
impressive, as all four swimmers
finished under 21 seconds. Stan
ford's sprinters are slower in sea
son than some other teams because
they work out much harder. This is
the time of the season when the
workouts are becoming less strenu
ous and the sprinters begin to show
that they are among the best in the
country. Freshman Anthony
Robinson was the fastest high

school swimmer ever in the 50 free;
he is beginning to show that he will
be there in college as well.
Senior Tom Wilkens won the
2(X) individual medley in a season
best time of 1:48. Stanford took
four of the top five spots in this
event. This could be the Cardinal's
strongest group come March.
Freshman Steven Brown won
the 200 fly with his best time of the
season (1:47) as he handed team
mate junior Matt Pierce his first
dual-meet loss since the USC meet
last year. Junior Tate Blahnik
swam well in the 200 backstroke,
turning even with Krazelburg. who
was last year's NCAA champion.
Krazelburg was able to get the win
by pulling away on the last 50.
Stanford's D-men stepped up
again in the 500 freestyle, going 1-
2-3-4. All four of the Stanford
swimmers were under 5:30. Fresh
man Steven Brown won his second
event of the day in 5:27.
Wilkens won his second event of
the day and set a meet record in the
200 breaststroke (1:58). Holden
finished second in 2:01.8. In an in
tense race for third, freshman Rob
Canales out-touched USC's top
breaststroker and teammate Steve
Ronson.
"Tom. Brown and Adam were
the highlights of a good meet over
all," said senior captain Scott Clay
pool. "They did especially well, but
we focused and did well as a team."
Stanford's sprinters continued
to do well in the 400 freestyle relay,
finishing in 2:58.6. All four of them
were clocked at under 45 seconds
on their relay legs as the relay
broke the 3-minute barrier for the
fourth time in a dual meet this year.
Stanford brought back The Bell,
the trophy that goes to the winner
of the annual dual meet, by step
ping up and swimming well in ad
verse conditions.
"I enjoy winning every dual
meet," Claypool said. "This one
was extra special. Beating a good
team at their home pool was a nice
dress rehearsal for NCAAs."
