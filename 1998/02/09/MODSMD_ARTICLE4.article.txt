# Students, trustees to discuss tuition rates
## 
### Nathan Wantanabe Contributing writer 
The Board of Trustees' tuition committee
will meet today to set the tuition rate for next
year's incoming class.
The deliberations have historically been
closed to students — but this year, the ASSI "s
Alliance to Control Tuition will have an infor
mal discussion with the Board to address stu
dent concerns over rising tuition rates.
Formed last week as pi'rt of the Tuition
Control Bill — which awaits senatorial ap
proval tomorrow — the committee hopes to
"lay the groundwork for the future by estab
lishing a viable and reasonable proposal for
keeping tuition increases down." said commit
tee head sophomore Matt Spence.
Although the tuition increase rate has de
creased from 45 percent above the inflation
rate four to five years ago to approximately 2
percent more than inflation last year. Spence
feels that the rate can still be lowered.

"Fractions of a percentage do matter, for it
really translates into what someone can earn in
a quarter's worth of work." Spence said. "Even
with a small decrease, the savings will be
clear."
"Michigan State guaranteed that its tuition
will stay at the rate of inflation which shows
that it is possible." he added.
An additional concern of the committee is
the tuition's growing "squeeze on the middle
class" which concerns those students too well
to-do for financial aid yet unable to afford the
whole tuition cost.
Representing the committee, Spence will
meet informally with the Board while senior
Bill Shen. the Board's student representative
on the Academic Policy. Planning and Man
agement Committee, will outline the basic
premises of the committee.
Caution and preparedness appear to be the
main concerns of the committee, for at this state.
due to its recent contrivance, the
committee does not have any specif
ic proposals, only a set of ideas, with
which it hopes to "start a dialogue to
begin working," Spence said.
Though composed of a commit
tee head, two ASSU senators, and
a non-ASSU representative, the
task force is still in its formative

stages with the two ASSIJ sena
tors yet to join. Projection for a
working committee is within two
to three weeks.
"One may ask why we're doing
this if we don't have a formal pro
posal." Spence said. "However, the
whole purpose of this is to intro
duce the student opinion and to let
[the Board] see the student outcry
on tuition increases."
"You need to start early to make
real change," he said.
