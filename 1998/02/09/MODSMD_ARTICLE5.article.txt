## Key focus is development and success of institutions 
### Saba Bireda Contributing writer 
Several leaders in the field of Latin Ameri
can economic development tried to determine
the role institutions have played in Latin Amer
ican economic growth.
At Friday's Hoover Institution Symposium:
Institutional Change and Latin American Eco
nomic Growth: Empirical Studies in the New
Institutional Economics, several papers intrcv
duced arguments and empirical evidence about
the role of institutions in constraining or pro
moting economic growth.
The symposium was organized b\ Stanford
History Prof, and Hoover Institution Senior
Fellow Stephen Haber as a response to "grow

ing theoretical literature that advances the fol
lowing argument: that .ill things being equal. s<v
cieties that create institutions will outper
form economically other societies that do not
create institutions."
A wrap-up report was presented at the end
of the da\ at Stauffer Auditorium The dav's
participants presented eight-minute presenta
tions concluding the da\ and their individual
papers.
Among the participants were Kenneth
Sokoloff and Elisa Marsical from the Depart
ment of Economics at I '(.'LA. ho presented a
paper on " Institutions and the Persistence of
Inequality in Latin America: T he Cases of Suf-

Miier Lee Daily
frage and Schooling." Sokoloff and
Marsical proposed that "initial dif
ferences in early Latin American
societies made an impact on eco
nomic growth."
William Summerhill from the
Department of History at UCLA
and a returning U.S. Army Reserve
from Bosnia spoke on "The Politi
cal Economy of Railroads in Nine
teenth Century Brazil: A Social Sav
ings Analysis of Institutional
Change."
Summerhill studied the effects of
political stability in Brazil and found
that "stability is probably necessary
but insufficient condition for good
economic performance. What really
matters at a fundamental level is in
stitutional arrangements that pro
mote efficient economic outcome."

Senior fellow and Nobel Prize
winner Douglass North made clos
ing remarks and opened the floor
for quest ions. Some of the quest ions
asked dealt with the role of eco
nomic historians in today's world,
the definition of an institution and
the effect of the Information Age on
today's economics. All of the pre
senters participated in the question
and-answer period.
"We all came to this conference
with a common set of questions
dealing with the general themes of
institutions and their effect on eco
nomic performance." concluded
Alan Dye. an economics professor
at Barnard College. "Today I felt
that we covered the gambit of cen
tral issues facing the Latin Ameri
can economy. Because we had so
many different perspectives, we
were able to cover an entire range of
issues. All in all. it was a very stimu
lating conference."
