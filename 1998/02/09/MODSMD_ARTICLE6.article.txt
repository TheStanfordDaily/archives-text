# Earth sciences pioneer dies at 97
## Evan Just, professor since '59, emphasized practical teaching 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Applied Earth Sciences Prof.
Emeritus Evan Just, who helped
build Stanford's earth sciences pro
gram. died Jan. 22 of congestive
heart failure at age 97.
Just joined the Stanford faculty
in 1959 after an illustrious career in
the mining industry and focused
teaching in what was then the De
partment of Mineral Sciences on a
practical education for work in
mining and petroleum engineer
ing. Stanford recruited him to build
the department after a nationwide
search.
With his late colleague Charles
Park, Just "brought an outlook to
the classes and advising that was
very industry-oriented." Geology
Prof. John Harbaugh said. "That is

essentially gone now."
Just was popular among stu
dents in part because he prepared
them so well for their future ca
reers, said Warren Kourt. Class of
'70, who went on to found an inde
pendent gas and oil exploration
company.
"He was a real proponent of the
students having a broad back
ground," Kourt said, "so he encour
aged me to take classes in the busi
ness school, which I've been grate
ful for ever since."
Before retiring in 1966. Just set
up a more formalized arrangement
for broadening students' education.
In addition to having earth sciences
graduate students take classes at the
Graduate School of Business, he
helped Stanford create a curriculum
in mineral economics that com
bined science, engineering, eco

nomics and political science.
The mining industry — and what
was necessary to succeed in it —
was something Just knew well, hav
ing established himself as a leader
in petroleum and mining engineer
ing after earning degrees from
Northwestern University and the
LJniversity of Wisconsin in the
19205.
Just, who was born in 19()() in
Chicago, did work in geology for
several oil and mineral companies,
as well as searching for bauxite in
Russia and investigating emerald
deposits in Brazil. Before coming to
Stanford, he taught briefly at Lehigh
University and the New Mexico
School of Mines and edited the En
gineering and Mining Journal.
Harbaugh remembered visiting
the Justs in Oklahoma as a child
when his father also was working in
mining in the Midwest. En route to
Dallas in 1936, he spent a night with
Just, who would succeed Har
baugh's father the next year as man
ager of mining operators in the
Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma
zinc and lead mining district.

The two crossed paths again
when they both taught at Stanford
in the 19605, Harhaugh said.
At Stanford, Just was known as a
caring teacher and a "very pleasant
individual." said Geology Prof.
Emeritus Konrad Krauskopf.
Just's involvement with his stu
dents during and after their time at
Stanford made him special, added
Kourt. who now is a consulting pro
fessor in petroleum engineering and
geological and environmental sci

ences at Stanford.
"He was a great, caring kind of
professor who was always interest
ed in what we were doing," Kourt
said. "He made you feel like what
you had to say was important.
"He's of a breed of Stanford pro
fessors that just aren't here any
more."
