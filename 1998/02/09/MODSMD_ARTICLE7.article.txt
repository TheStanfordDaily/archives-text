Most Stanford students' exposure to
chess is probably limited to passing b\ the
old guys playing chess behind the Coffee
House, watching "Searching for Bobb>
Fischer," reading an article about how
Gerry Kasparov lost to some computer
and possibly playing an actual chess game
once in awhile. Chess, however, plays a
much greater role in the lives of some .V)
members of the ('ardinal Chess Club.
The chess club was started in IW by
founding president and senior lrvin I \an
Tyan came to Stanford looking for a chess
organization but was unable to find one.
Although he was only a freshman, he ttx>k
the initiative to found a new chess club.
Tyan stated that the chess club was
founded "first and foremost to promote
the game of chess, within and outside the


Alexandra HuOdteeton Daily
Stanford community."
The chess club has expanded pre
cipitously since Tyan's freshman
year. According to Tyan, much of his
sophomore year was spent "consoli
dating a group of dedicated and en
thusiastic officers which includes
Adrian Keatinge-Clay [current vice
president) and Zhiquan Ong [trea
surer]."
Tyan and the officer core expand
ed the scope of the club from a chess
forum and meeting place to an active,
competitive club.
"The three of us worked hard to
... broaden its horizons on many lev
els: tournament play, registration as
an official United States Chess Fed
eration club, tutorials at meetings and
a variety of opportunities," Tyan said.
This year, the club boasts a mem
bership of 30 actively competitive
players as well as students, communi
ty members and international stu
dents who attend meetings but have
never played chess.
According to Tyan, anyone walk
ing into a chess meeting will find "a
highly organized and efficiently run
chess club where serious chess cen
tered around academic and strategic
discussion occurs, and where the
laughter of eight-man bughouse or
the excitement of a blitz master ver
sus game master can be heard."
In addition to recruiting a strong
membership foundation, the chess

cluh has obtained 112 inancial hacking.
"As the cluh grew, we were able to
get more support from ASSIJ fund
ing. We could buy all the necessary
supplies," said Keatinge-Clay, a ju
nior. "Now, there is nothing we can't
do. We are even active over the Inter
net, playing in tournaments with
other colleges."
The members play in at least one
major tournament each quarter in
addition to several other local ones.
The largest tournament players have
attended is the Pan-American games,
where the club's varsity team has
faced daunting competition from
many schcx)ls, including the Universi
ty of Pennsylvania and Yale.
Both Tyan and Keatinge-Clay ex
pressed ambitious goals for their
club. This year marks the first time
they actively recruited students out of
high school. In addition to secondary
school recruiting, the club hopes to
further increase its membership and
tournament activity. A long-term
goal for the chess club is to host the
prestigious Pan-American Intercol
legiate Chess Championships.
The Cardinal Chess Club always
welcomes new members. Tyan noted
that "the strength of the club lies in
the wide diversity of its members,
who come from different social, eco
nomic and ethnic backgrounds and
whose talents and skill in chess are
just as varied."
Interested students can attend
their meetings which are held in the
mechanical engineering building
every Monday at 7:30 p.m.
