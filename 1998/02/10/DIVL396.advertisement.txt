"My Analyst friends at other banks
can't believe I work on so many live
deals and frequently take on Associate
responsibility. We definitely do things
a lot differently here."
Tom Sheehan/analyst
Telecom/Media BA, YALE, 1997
Prudential Securities is not stuffy,
staid or complacent. We're an aggres
sive, energetic investment bank on the
move and our people reflect this spirit.
We win business because we out
think and out hustle our competitors.
It's aij exhilarating challenge that
fosters an atmosphere of creativity
and personal initiative at every level
of the firm.
Ours is also a culture of service, not
privilege. We all work together to give
our clients the best service possible.
At Prudential Securities, we think
and act differently. And that's made all
the difference to our growing success.
