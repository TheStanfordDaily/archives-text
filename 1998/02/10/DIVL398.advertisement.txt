"Teamwork Isn t a cliche at this
investment bank, It's real. You have
to be ready to do whatever
it takes to win."
DONALD YOUNG/ANALYST,
Telecom/Media, AB, HARVARD, 1996
At Prudential Securities, our four
or five personal deal teams share a
camaraderie you don't often find at
other firms. There's no rigid hierarchy
or layers of bureaucracy. And everybody
pulls their weight.
As a team player, you'll be under the
guidance of some of the most experi
enced Managing Directors in the industry.
They'll help you sharpen your skills
and provide the in-depth knowledge you
need to advance your career.
We encourage our people to care
about one another and to help each other.
We also want everyone to have fun.
Because if you don't enjoy what you're
doing, you're not going to do it well.
