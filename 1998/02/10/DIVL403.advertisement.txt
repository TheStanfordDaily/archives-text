"Our training goes beyond the
fundamentals and, gives us the real-world
knowledge you'll need to handle just
about any assignment you're given."
ADAM SCOTCH/ANALYST,
M&A, BA, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, 1996
Prudential Securities' training
program for analysts is rigorous and
extensive. This allows our analysts to
assume more responsibility sooner
because they've been thoroughly trained
and have demonstrated to senior man
agement the maturity to accept such
responsibility.
'I~he people who usually do best
here are those who don't need an overly
structured environment, show personal
initiative and have a demonstrated
commitment to excellence.
If you think you have what it takes to
make your mark in investment banking.
Prudential Securities is the place to find
out how good you really are.
