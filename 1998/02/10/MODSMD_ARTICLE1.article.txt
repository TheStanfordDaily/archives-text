Board of Trustees members
shared their tips for a successful life
after Stanford with 1 (M) seniors last
night in Tresidder Union's Oak
Lounge.
As students interview for jobs,
they should look beyond salary
considerations, stressed the pan
elists.
"The most important thing to
look for is a mentor," said Robert
Bass, ('lass of '74. president of Key
stone Inc. and chair of the board.
In attaining a mentor, students
should realize that they are engag
ing in a two-way process and have to
deliver something of value to their
mentor.
"Pay attention to what you can

offer them," said U.S. Deputy As-
Mstant Attorney Cleneral Ivan
Fong, ( lass of '87. "You have to do
outstanding work there is no sub
stitute lot that."
Panelists ;ilso emphasized choos
ing a profession that makes one
happy.
"It's really important to do what
you want to do," advised Denise
O'Leary, Class of '!*■). a special lim
ited partner at Menlo Ventures,
"even if it is difficult to do when
everyone around you is interview
ing to be an investment banker or a
consultant."
O'Leary added that these two
professions dominated the recruit
ing market when she was at Stan
ford. indicating that little has

changed since her school days.
"Sometimes the most direct path
is not necessarily the best one,"
O'Leary pointed out, encouraging
students to explore their interests.
Although the panelists empha
sized the importance of choosing a
satisfying career, they also stressed
the need to strike a balance between
professional and family life.
"Have a clear set of priorities in
your life," Fong said. "Go on vaca
tion often — that is the time you
have to reflect."
Fong added that drafting a per
sonal mission statement, often with
the help of one's family, can help
keep a career in perspective.
Panelists warned students against
trying to achieve too many goals at
once.
"You can't do everything well,"
said Gap co-founder Doris Fisher,
Class of "53.
()t her panelists concurred, stress
ing that priorities change throughout
lite as people move from being single
to assuming responsibility for future
generations.
Stanford degrees are going to
help students a great deal as they
build their careers, the panelists
agreed.
"1 don't think one appreciates the
value of a Stanford education until
after one leaves," Fong said.

The diversity and excellence of
students and academic programs
provide a tool kit for solving life's
problems, Mass said.
"The Stanford name does open
doors," Fong added. "Relationships
you make now will benefit your ca
reer down the line."
The confidence that the trustees
expressed for the success of the grad
uating seniors was echoed in their
outlook on the immediate future of
the University.
"Stanford is on a roll — its reputa
tion is rising if that is still possible; its
resources are expanding," Bass said.
The school's main challenge is to
take advantage of this momentum
and to continue attracting the best
students and faculty.
Bass cited the introduction of
freshman seminars and graduate stu
dent fellowships as examples of Stan
ford's progress in this direction.
"We are very fortunate to have
[University President Gerhard]
Casper at the helm," Fisher added.
The trustees also noted the im
portance of addressing the issues of
historical increases in tuition, future
cuts in federal funding and increasing
class unity.
"We do need to do better with the
undergraduates," Bass said.
O'Leary said students can voice
their concerns to the board by invit
ing the local members to dinner at
their residences and by contacting
the student representatives to the
board's committees.
