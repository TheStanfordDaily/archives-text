# Snow slows Olympic Games
## 
### 
NAGANO, Japan (AP) — Another
day, another heavy snowfall at the
Nagano Olympics — this time forcing
postponement of the women's super-G.
Officials at the Happo'one course
postponed the race this morning (last
night EST) after several more inches of
snow fell overnight and continued a few
hours before race time. It was the third
straight day of delays for the world's best
skiers — though the men's combined
slalom was expected to go on.
Four medals were at stake today in the
Winter Olympics. The U.S. team, coming
off a best-ever 13 medals in Lillehammer,
is looking for its first medal in Japan —
and looks to have a good shot in speed
skating.
— SPEEDSKATING: American
Casey Fitzßandolph of Verona, Wis.,
stands in third place after the first leg of
the men's 500 meters competition.
Fit/Randolph set an Olympic record in
his spin around the M-Wave arena;
unfortunately, so did three others, and
Fit/Randolph trails two of them.
World record holder Hiroyasu
Shimizu of Japan is first and Kevin Over
land of Canada second heading into the
final run today.
— SKATING: When the pairs figure
skaters return to the ice tonight (this
morning EST) for the freestyle competi
tion, two-time Olympic medalist Artur
Dmitriev of Russia and his new partner,
Oksana Kazakova. will hold the lead. A
pair of American couples will vie for
medals —■ two-time U.S. champions
Kyoko Ina and Jason Dungjen, and Jenni
Meno and Todd Sand.
The first couple is in fourth place after
the short program, the latter in sixth. I he
freestyle program is worth two-thirds of
the final score.
In action late yesterday:
HOCKEY: The U.S. women's
team scored four goals over eight min
utes late in the second period on its way
to a 7-1 victory over Sweden. The out
manned Swedes managed just three shots
in the game — one each periinl — as the
Americans cruised to their second
straight win.
— LUGE: The Olympics could not
have started better for Wendel Suckow,
or ended more bitterly.
