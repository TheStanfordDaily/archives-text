Researchers find vaccine
WASHINGTON (AP) A vaccine against 1 coli. the deadK food poisoning bacteria
that forced the recall last year of millions of pounds of beef, has been tested successfull> on
a small group of volunteers, researchers said yesterda\
Scientists at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the
Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte. N.C., report th.it a preliminary stud\ using N7 vol
unteers showed that the vaccine causes an immune reaction that could protect against
infection by E. coli 0157.
"This is still very early in the research," said Pr Dwayne F. Alexander, director of the
institute on child health and human development, one ol the National Institutes of Health
"This is the first human stud\ of this proposed vaccine."
He said the important finding is that the vaccine produced a level of antibody in the vol
unteers that could kill H : . coli 0157 in the test tube.
"We don't know yet if it will kill the bacteria in the body." he said.
Alexander said the next step is tests to determine if the vaccine will prevent I coli 0157
infection in cattle, which are thought to be the most common source of the infection.
Results of the preliminary stud\ are published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.
E. coli 0157 is a deadly, new strain of bacteria that can contaminate beef, fruit juice and
other UxhJs, causing severe fixxl poisoning symptoms, including bkH>d\ diarrhea and dam
aged kidneys. People can also become infected b\ swimming 111 lakes or rivers contaminat
ed with the organism.
Cattlemen sue Oprah
AMARU TO. Texas (AP) — Oprah Winfrey's show on mad cow disease was a "bomb"
dropped on the cattle industry, a cattleman testified yesterday.
Although other TV shows aired segments on the disease before Winfrey did. it was she
who did the ranchers in. said Paul Engler. chief executive of Cactus Feeders Inc.. one of the
largest cattle feeders in the world.
"I thought the market would bounce back, but it was obvious that the impact of Win
frey's show was profound because cattle prices just kept going down," he said.
Engler and other cattlemen are suing Winfrey, her production company and vegetarian
activist Howard Lyman for more than $10.3 million over an April 16. 1 Wf». episode during
which the talk show host swore off hamburgers. Texas law protects agricultural products
from defamatory remarks.
