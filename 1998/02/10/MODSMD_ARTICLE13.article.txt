Sixth Man Club
raises deeper issue
of student conduct

ALHOUGH THE University
is rightfully concerned with
student behavior at athletic
events. Athletic Director Ted Leland's
proposal to consider moving the Sixth
Man Club from its seating on the floor
of Maples Pavilion is a Band-Aid. not
a solution.
Such a potentially radical move
indicates the Athletic Department's
willingness to place restrictions on one
of Stanford's most exciting traditions
without consulting students first.
More importantly, such an action
would avoid the heart of the issue —
the need for a campus-wide dialogue
about expectations for student behav
ior at public events.
In recent months, Stanford has
gained national press attention for its
students' unsportsman-like behavior
at athletic events ranging from the Big
Game to the men's basketball game
against the University of Arizona. Stu
dents on campus have also repeatedly
complained about excessively insensi
tive behavior at Flicks.
It appears that a trend of question
able student conduct has infiltrated
the campus.
We understand that Leland and
University President Gerhard Casper

are concerned about this and the
accompanying negative press that
reflects poorly on the institution.
However, it is also time to give
credit to Stanford students and open a
dialogue with them about expecta
tions for student conduct. Students
should not be punished by having
their seats moved: they should be
treated as adults and invited to join in
finding a creative solution.
It is time for Stanford to do what it
does best — form a committee to
examine the issue. Such a committee
should be charged with clarifying uni
versity expectations and discussing
student perceptions of acceptable
behavior at such events. Student lead
ers should take an active role in start
ing this process.
Giving students a voice in the pro
cess will increase the likelihood that
they will be receptive to modifying
their conduct. Moreover, the develop
ment of general conduct guidelines
through such a committee would pre
vent the need to address these issues
in a piecemeal, haphazard fashion.
Last week, an overwhelming num
ber of students helped rescue soaked
materials from Green Library and
Braun Music Library. Their efforts
demonstrated that students are capa
ble not only of behaving responsibly,
but also giving the best of themselves
to support the University.
If we are respected as adults, the
student body could do just as well at
public events.
