# Help to shape Res Ed

### 
Remember to fill out
residence evaluations
by midnight tomorrow

The annual residence
evaluation, available on the
Web until midnight Wednes
day, offers Stanford undergraduates
the opportunity to tell Residential
Education what they really think
about house or dorm life. Only 32 per
cent of students had completed the
survey as of yesterday. We encourage
all undergraduates to take 20 minutes
to voice their opinions to Res Ed.
Students often complain about the
almighty Res Ed entity. Some are crit
ical of staple programs like Crossing
the Line. Others are wondering how
their absentee RAs were ever hired
after having undergone a supposedly
rigorous selection process. Many are
angry that Res Ed is trying to create a
more homogenous Row. Others are
disturbed bv the fact that Res Ed has

considered becoming more involved
in the process of hiring Row staff
members.
Now is the time for students to
share their concerns and constructive
suggestions with Res Ed.
Everyone cares about his or her liv
ing situation. We all want to feel com
fortable, safe and happy with our fel
low residents and our staff. Feedback
is the only way for an alphabet soup of
RAs. RFs. RCCs, HA As, ETAs, PHEs
and other staff members to gauge
their performance.
It is their job to create dorms and
houses that people want to come
home to. It is in students' own inter
ests to let the staff know whether
their efforts are failing miserably or
succeeding.
Consider the time it takes to fill out
the survey as a constructive study
break. Help shape the future of resi
dential life on campus by firing up

But act quickly â€” the deadline for
responding is midnight tomorrow.
