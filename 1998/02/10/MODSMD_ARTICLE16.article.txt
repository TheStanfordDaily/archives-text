## Welcome to Lubbock, Tree-boy 
### 
IT WAS A sunny day, 1
thought as I pulled up
my pants. I did love
Monte Carlo, but I was
beginning to get the feel
ing that I'd been in the
same place for too long.
You see, I'm Tree

Stanford Tree — and even cooler than that.
I'm a secret agent Tree. I couldn't tell if it
was general stagnation that had me down or
the constricting fit of European condoms.
In either case I knew I had to bust out. and
the two Italian ladies on my arm wouldn't
be too happy about that.
What festive destination lay ahead?
None other than the meat-judging capitol of
the planet: Lubbock. Texas. This job takes
me all over, from the hive of scum and vil
lainy that is El Paso, Texas to the bustling
metropolis that is Missoula, Mont.
I was welcomed to Lubbock by the sight
of an armadillo scurrying after a rolling
tumble weed. The weed was being chased
by a guy shooting a gun into the air. They
have a law that allows for concealed
weapons there, but the Lubbockites seemed
more excited to show their weapons than to
conceal them. I was a little nervous consid
ering that shooting the dancing Tree-boy
probably wasn't completely illegal.
My usual entourage accompanied me:
40 members of the Band whom I like to call
the glowing ejectiles, a group of ladies who

turned down the Bond-girl gig to be the dol
lies and a large suitcase lull of drugs toted
by my men ()range and Red Julius.
I pulled a pingpong ball-sized crack rock
from my inner coat pocket and nonchalant
ly filed off a small handful. I began to remi
nisce as many I'rees do
I he whole scene reminded me of a time
in Paris in 1995. I had been fishing for a
bagel that was stuck in the toaster, an action
which prompted a swift and severe elcctri
cal shock that blinded me. I tailing blindly, I
proceeded to gash niv head against a low
hanging light fixture and to place m\ hand
in a pot of boiling water. I was laid out on
the floor spitting and convulsing
1 hat was what Lubbock reminded me 01.
This thought was shaken from my mind by
two Texans who shouted. "Welcome to the
hood, mutha fucka!" from a passing car.
But enough talk about the town. The
Stanford women's basketball team was
playing against Texas lech and I had to be
there. I had a showdown with one Red
Raider, Texas Tech's official mascot. A
shoot-out was imminent.
The game was exceptional. The ninth
ranked Stanford team slashed the fifth
ranked Texas Tech team. Texas lech's
national champion "Meat Judging Team"
came on the court during halftime. Kristin
Folkl had her hand stepped on and. as the
local paper said, had "stayed down with a
distinctly female hurt a broken linger

nail" (Hon Williams. Lubbock Avalanche
lournal). Texas I'ech was handed an
embarrassing loss and left the stadium with
a distinctly defeatist hurt a broken will.
All seemed fine and good, but there he
stood.
The Red Raider.
He looked like an overweight Yosemite
Sam and smelled like Texas cow country.
I he Red Raider was a little more than
milled at the loss. He waved a giant prop
si\-Nhooter in my direction.
I had forgotten to pick up my civilian
issue firearm upon entering the state, so I
retaliated in the only way I knew how I
dropped ti» the floor and started freakin' the
boy. hot and heavy like With one hand on
the ground and the other grabbing at his lit
tle red buttocks, my pelvis undulated in his
direction. I was proud to hear a collective
gasp emit from the crowd of Bible licit l ex
ans. I responded with a shout out: • Wel
come to the hood. Beeeyaatch!"
And thus another I ree adventure came
to a close. All there was left to do was spend
a night on the town. I am happy to say that
the Texas Tech cheerleaders. Vanessa
Nygaard and I had a great time at a local
dance club called The Cowpoke.
