Yell leaders respond
to Leland and Casper
We are writing in response to Friday's Daily
article regarding the future of the Sixth
Man Club. As yell leaders, we are con
cerned about the University's overly strict
discourse regarding the Sixth Man's roguish
behavior at recent basketball games. Dis
solving the largest and most accepting club
on campus would be an unfortunate end to
a elub whose sole existence is to infuse
Stanford with much-needed spirit.
The recent criticism that the Sixth Man
Club's cheers have exceeded the limits of
good taste are not without merit. But these
transgressions should not overshadow the
extremely positive influence the Sixth Man
Club has had on basketball games and on
Stanford spirit.
Stanford is a school with diverse inter
ests that may draw students away from ath
letic events. Over the past few years stu
dents have lost much of what makes athlet
ic events a pleasure to attend and support
50-yard line seats, free admission to
sporting events and the feeling that not
only were students a part of the game, hut
also that the game was being played to
bring pride to students and their school.
That the Sixth Man can draw several
hundred students together for a basketball
game and unite them in support of the team
is commendable. Let us not criticize them
for overstepping the bounds of good taste.
They are in the process of creating a tradi
tion and must discover their boundaries.

Athletic Director Ted Leland sa\s the
function of the Sixth Man "is to organize
the crowd to prevent obscene behavior."
This seems far from the more apparent end,
which is to organize the chaos of student
support and establish a home court advan
tage.
If Sixth Man is to continue, it may be
best for it to distance itself from the athlet
ic department. Only then would the depart
ment not feel that the Sixth Man Club is
misrepresenting it in ways unfavorable for
its corporate interests.
"The deterioration of civility began with
the Band's performance at the Notre Dame
game," says President Casper. Although
the Stanford Band has its own place in
human history, it seems more likely that the
deterioration of civility began when
humans starting competing for limited
goods, including basketball victories.
The yell leaders, as quasi-employees of
the Athletics Department, screen our
cheers carefully, but we're still learning how
hard this process iv Let's cut the Sixth Man
a little slack.
The team appreciates the Sixth Man
Club; the players know that the club helps
lorward their cause. Basketball broadcaster
Dick Vitale calls Maples Pavilion "the most
difficult place to play in college hoops
(baby)." let's not penalize the fans that
make it that way.

Think blood not flood
I just read Marc Wais' Feb. 9 column enti
tled "A flood of community support." It is
heartening to know that so many students,
staff and faculty rallied to save books from
the rising waters at Green Library last
week. I lie spirit and strength of this com
munity is wonderful.
While the word "flood" may not call to
mind "blood" for many people, the associa
tion comes naturally for me, since 1 work at
Stanford Blood Center and have the job of
reminding people of the importance of giv
ing their life-saving pints. Just as the Stan
lord community showed selflessness and
concern as they saved thousands of books,
this same community gi\es many pints of
life-saving blood each year to others — chil
dren and adults who depend on volunteer
blood donors.
We thank those people who give to oth
ers through blood donations each quarter.
While we've had too much llood lately, but
we've had too little blood.
Please give a pint as often as you can!
