# Showering with the boys
## Vanessa Bartsch Blame it on the rain: a declaration of love 
### 
THERE MIJS'I' BE something in the
water. Alter all, it has been raining
for days. Noah himself has long
since hightailed it south on 101.
Everyone is getting a little nutty. So I
am blaming any irrationality on the water.
And maybe a tad on the power outage,
lor which I sincerely extend my thanks to
lovely ol' PG&E electric. 1 am fairly cer
tain that the greater part of the Row's
easterly quadrant spent Monday night
either lamenting lost term papers and
missed meals or getting a little busy— if
you know what I mean. Snogging heaven.
Too much time alone with my thoughts,
in the rain, in the dark has started my mind
drifting down a dangerous path. Mental
vacancy has made room for reflection that
might have made the old me ready to
wretch.
I pride myself on the ability to shower
in two minutes, including washing my hair,
and to lire off a snot-rocket while running
without missing a beat. I'm fiercely inde
pendent — too busy for pointless calls
home.
Now. I've transformed from a tomboy
ish football fiend into an emotive freak.

Something made me go from nose-tackle
to puppy, rolling over and exposing mv
belly.
So, as a wise pop duo once said: "Blame
it on the rain." What else could make me
into such a fuzzy ball of girlie sentimental
ity?
Because, last week, I told my friend
Andy that I loved him.
I think it caught him a bit off guard.
Maybe it's because he isn't living in this
country and such things are strange to
read over e-mail. But I wrote it anyway
because it's true. Not in some sappy. I
want to marry him and/or bear his first
born manner, but in the way of kindred
spirits.
In three single-spaced cyber-pages, I
bared my vulnerable little soul. At 5 a.m.,
I took the time to list every single silly lit
tle thing that I appreciate about him.
Because I love knowing that somewhere
— even way the hell on the other side of
this huge cream-puff of a world — where a
new day is starting as I am going off to
bed, a person like him just exists and is
part of my life.
An interesting e-mail to get, I must

imagine. But it was not until I pressed that
"send" button that I realized how glad I
was that I had said those things. There arc
few people in my life who I value more
than sleep and food. They are those who
are willing to drive with me for three hours
to get ice cream when I need to get off
campus or those who answer the phone in
Chicago at 3 a.m. But the small handful of
people who are willing to listen to me sing
as we drive or pick up the phone long after
bedtime deserve to know it.
We spend so much time afraid to put
ourselves out there on the line. My friend
Sarah just made a pact with the guy she is
seeing that neither of them will fall in love,
because that would be too hard and some
one might end up getting hurt.
No matter what they feel under these
lull moons and cloudy winter nights, they
will not stumble. Their hugs will be noth
ing more than ritual. They will not open up
every part of themselves shamelessly and
freely.
They can talk into the wee hours of
wonderful things. Each can have sex to a
body filling an empty space in bed. but
they can never be in love. Because that is

against the rules, as if emotions are con
trolled by a simple on / off switch as some
might like.
Not that their permanently deadened
state is any better than my friend Laura's
situation. She is always "on." falling in
"love" every second. Her life is a constant
soap opera with this minute's 1 rat boy
floating in and out, shrouded in practiced
gestures and empty words.
We all know someone like Sarah or
Laura. But neither of them understands.
Valentine's Day, this satanic, money
grubbing. Hallmark-produced holiday is
charging at us. It's screaming smarmy
terms of endearment from every hilltop
and cheesy Deßcer's diamond commer
cial. Those that have a special someone
follow the B-grade script without ques
tioning the words they recite and those
that sleep alone in their futons eat Haa
gen-Daaz and get bitter.
The sad thing is that there is this beau
tiful place right in the middle, not between
"on" and "off." but way out on a ledge, far
from anything safe. There is a space for
those who understand themselves enough
to spot their soulmates and tell them that.

An old Ciarrison Keillor joke that I love
goes, "Once there was a man from Min
nesota who loved his wile so much he
almost told her." Not that m\ intention is
to pick on the state that s<> graciously gift
ed the world with Judy (iarland. Hob
Dylan. Prince and my parents, hut it cap
tures something so perfect.
Words like that are so hard to say
and even harder to mean Hut il \<>u mean
them, truly, deep down in a place that you
probably don't even w;mt to know you
have, then use them.
You can take your Valentine's Day and
eat pounds ot chocolate ind enjoy the
ones you choose to be with But .it the ent
of the day, I beseech \ou to stop in the
wake ol rainy -day nostalgia and pick uf
the phone, get on your bike or hop on tht
Cal Train. Find the ones that count ant
tell them You hit\e nothing to lose
