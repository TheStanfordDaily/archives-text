Diamond into a virtual lake, one of
the most highly anticipated series of
the 1998 season finally took place.
And after it was over. No. 1 Stan
ford had defeated l()th-ranked Cal

State-Fullerton 7-3. 5-2 in a double
header yesterday.
With the two wins, the Cardinal
swept the Fullerton series for the
first time since the 1991 season.
"It was a good series for us," said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess.
"It's nice to win. but it doesn't
mean much now," he added.
Marquess praised the pitching
performances of juniors Chad
Hutchinson and Jeff Austin.
Austin pitched the entire first
game, which was shortened to seven
innings. The righthander effectively
worked the mound, tallying seven
strikeouts while giving up only one
hit.
In the Cardinal's first turn at the
plate, Stanford sophomore Jody
Gerut hammered the ball over the
right field fence, giving the Cardinal

Sunday, look lo the mound at the
start of the second game yesterday.

strikeouts, tying a career mark, be

Hutchinson's easy burn through

the Fullerton lineup not only visibly
frustrated the Titans but also
sparked further debate about what
the two-sport standout might
achieve if he chose to focus only on
baseball.
Hutchinson and Titan freshman
Jon Smith dueled it out on the
mound, trailing strikes until the sev
enth when a series of errors gave the
Titans a 2-0 lead.

to center field, bringing home
Sehrager and C ierut.
