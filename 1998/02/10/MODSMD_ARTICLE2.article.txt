The letter from Casper indicated
his disappointment with Landers
for printing incorrect information
about diseiplinary actions taken
against the Stanford Band lor a
halftime show at a Notre Dame
football game last quarter.

The Band's
show, which sati
rized the Pope
an d the Iris h
Potato Famine,
enraged many
people at Notre
Dame and mem
bers of the com
munitv at large.

In his letter Casper wrote. "Con
trary to your correspondent's state
inent that 'school officials s.iid they
planned no sanctions.' in fact, the
Band was barred from the field for
the next three Stanford-Notre


Landers


Casper
Dame games."
In addition, Casper, Athletie
Director Ted Leland and the Band
all made formal apologies, which
the Rev. Edward Malloy, the pres
ident of Notre Dame, accepted.
What prompted Casper to write
to Landers even after apologies
had been made and accepted by
the respective parties who were in
volved?
"I can't speak for Casper," Asst.
Athletic Director Gary Migdol
said, "but the(first) letter written to
Ann Landers was inaccurate, and

what we all would have appreciated
is | lor Landers] to check the facts."
In making his decision, Casper
may also have considered his ac
quaintance with the ad\ice colum
nist, said University Communica
tions Director Terry Shepard.
"Gerhard actually knows her
from Chicago," Shepard said.
"Ann Landers' column has a huge
readership, and if people misun
derstood the facts, it was appropri
ate for him to correct the record."
When the incident initially oc
curred. Landers had written a
chastising invitation for any offi
cials from Stanford to respond to
her column, Shepard said.
Some students were glad that

Casper cleared up misconceptions.
"My main reaction was Why
are they still talking about it?' and
not 'Why did Casper write the let
ter?' " said sophomore Laurel
Whitnah.
"However, 1 think the truth
needs to be heard," she said, "be
cause a lot of people just heard that
the Stanford Band did a bad thing
and [did not] hear about the after
math."
Sophomore Ping Wang had a
mixed reaction. "It was pretty sur
prising that Casper wrote to [Lan
ders] because it seemed a little out
o! place, but at the same time it's
nice that Casper would do that for
us."
