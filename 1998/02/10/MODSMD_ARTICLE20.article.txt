Senior Ania Bleszysnki takes a hack in last November s Rolex Regionais. In the Rolex
Individual Championships over the weekend. Bleszysnki. paired with senior Julie
Scott, won the doubles championship 0-6. 6-4, 7-6 over a team from Duke.
the No. 11 player in the country.
I he ("ardinal senior bounced haek
from a first-set loss in a grueling tie
breaker to take the next two sets
for a 6-7. 6-4.6-3 triumph.
Scott defeated Marquette's
Elisa Penalvo with relative ease in
the quarterfinals. 6-1,6-3.
Seott and Bleszynski were per
haps even more impressive on
their way to defending their cham
pionship in last year's Rolex tour
nament. Ihe road to the title
match took them through Flori
da's top doubles squad of senior
Dawn Buth and junior Stephanie
Niekitas. two-time N( AA defend
ing champions in doubles.
I he Cardinal squad, ranked
seventh in the country, did not get
oil on the right foot against the
Gator team, dropping the first set
without winning a game. But the
Cardinal stormed back to take the
second and then outlasted Muth
and Niekitas, the draw's top seed,
in a third-set tie breaker for a berth
in the title match, 0-6.6-4. 7-6.
It did not get any easier for the
Cardinal in the final, unfortunate
ly. with Duke's top team of Vanes
sa Web and Karen Goldstein on
the opposite side of the court.
Once again. Scott and Bleszynski
lost the first set. But for the second
straight match, the Stanford se
niors fought back. After refusing
to be eliminated in a second-set tie
breaker, the Cardinal team won
another close set in the third and
took the title. 4-6.7-6. 7-5.
"We ran into a lot of tough
matches — some very good
teams." Scott said. "We had to
play three three-setters, but we got
better and much more confident as
we went along. Our first match of
the tournament was ;i little shaky,
but we settled in and picked it up
from there."
Perhaps the Cardinal felt a bit
slighted at the prospect that nei
ther Scott nor the team of Seott
and Bleszynski received a seed in
either the singles or doubles draw.
Ashley, the Cardinal sopho
more currently ranked No. 10 in
singles, strung together a number
of impressive wins as well on her
way to the consolation title. In the
championship, Ashley upset
Sandy Sureephong of Texas, the
No. 6 rated player in the nation. 6-
4. 3-6. 7-6. In the round preceding
that match, Ashley took care of
Buth. the Gators' top player, in
straight set fashion. 6-4.6-1.
Scott is one of three women to
win both titles in the tournament's
history and the first since 1991.
Scott is the second Stanford player
to register the double. I ann
Whitlinger pulled it off for Stan
ford in 1989.
