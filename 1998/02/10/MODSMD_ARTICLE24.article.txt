Winning an award hasn't
stopped Peter Hartigan from con
tinuing his quest for public service.
The business student, one of
seven 1997 winners of the Golden
Key National Scholarship, hopes to
inspire Stanford students to excel in
public service and academic excel
lence — the combination that
earned him membership in the
Golden Key Honor Society when
he was an undergraduate at Duke
University.
Just before entering Stanford's
Graduate School of Business last
fall, the honor society — founded at
Georgia State University in 1977 —
awarded Hartigan a $10,000 schol
arship to support his post-baccalau
reate or professional study at an ac
credited institution of higher learn
ing.
Only one student received the
first Golden Key scholar award in
1993. According to the Golden
Key's World Wide Web site, selec
tion criteria includes a strong un
dergraduate record including
"scholastic achievement, leader
ship and service," involvement in
the undergraduate's Golden Key
National Honor Society chapter
and a commitment to campus and
community service.
While Golden Key's funding of

service groups through member
ship lees helped, the society's em
phasis on public action made a big
ger difference, Hartigan said.
"Golden Key enabled us to be
social entrepreneurs," he said.
Hartigan was born and raised in
Chicago. He began his involvement
in Golden Key. a 500,000-member
nonprofit organization, during his
sophomore year at Duke. Based
upon his academic excellence, he
was asked to join the local chapter,
which at the time consisted of only a
few members.
During his first year, there were
10 active members. During his ju
nior year, Hartigan became presi
dent and the group grew to 150 ac
tive members.
Hartigan set up a management
team that created eight service
groups in an impoverished area of
Durham. N.C. He encouraged
members to contribute two hours
every week to public service. I larti
gan said one of his most memorable
projects involved working at a near
by children's hospital.
Hartigan's involvement didn't
stop at the local level.
During the summers, he traveled
to the annual international conven
tions held in Georgia and Florida,
which 1 iartigan described as a "fes
tival that links people on a regional,
national and international level."

Members of the society's 260 colle
giate chapters attended.
The summer following his junior
year, Hartigan was in Atlanta at his
second conference and decided to
run for the position of national stu
dent representative.
During that year, Hartigan be
came the national president and
worked on issues ranging from in
ternational expansion to education
al programs in American high
schools that promoted drug and
AIDS awareness.
Hartigan graduated from Duke
in 1993 with a bachelor's in psychol
ogy and philosophy. He spent the
next four years working as a ven
ture capitalist, first in Boston and
then in Silicon Valley.
Eventually, Hartigan hopes to
integrate business, international
business politics and philanthropic
work into his goal of becoming a
"professional board member." His
experience with the honor society
has shaped his plans.
"Golden Key put me in a posi
tion where I was able to express cre
ativity with leadership," he said. "It
gave me the opportunity to balance
what was important."
Once he finishes with the chaos
of midterms, Hartigan said he
hopes to regain that balance and
look into beginning a Stanford
chapter of Golden Key.
