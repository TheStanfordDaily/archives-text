# Paley discusses a writer's life
## 
### Kerry Shaw Staff writer 
Grace Haley, considered by
many to be one of the greatest
American short story writers,
spoke to a full house at Kresge Au
ditorium last night.
The author was the second
guest in this year's Lane Lecture
Series. Her reading was preceded
by introductions from poet Eavan
Uoland and Prof. Emeritus Nancy
Packer.
Packer, also a writer, described
Paley as an author who has the abil
ity to create stories with the "polit
ical expressed in the personal."
Packer compared Paley to
Faulkner and Hemingway â€” writ
ers whose styles are easily identifi
able.
"Every sentence is recognizable
as Grace Paley," Packer said. She
also took note of Paley's skill in
capturing the thoughts and emo
tions of women. Paley will "speak
to women eons from now." she
added.
Before Paley began, she joked
that it was a relief to finally read at

a venue with the lights on, referring
to her experience in darkened au
ditoriums.
"If you're telling people stories,
you should be able to see them."
Her shoulders barely reaching
the podium, the sprightly New
York-accented writer told anec
dotes about her life and read four
of her stories, which ranged in top
ics from the death of her mother to
segregation on public transit to a
woman's thoughts on growing old.
The stories she read reflected
her realistic and trademark
"quirky" reflections. One of her
stories began with the line: "I am
trying to curb my cultivated indi
vidualism."
In another, her dying mother
asks her, "If you come home at 4
a.m. when you're 17. what time will
come home when you're 20?"
Among the anecdotes she
shared with the audience was her
experience in the 1950s with a writ
ing teacher who asked her when
she was "going to get off her Jewish
dime."
"That's the only dime I have."
she responded.

She is known in the literary
world lor her ability to create be
lievable characters with strong po
litical beliefs and place them into
realistic relationships.
Betsy Mellins. an immunologist
at the Stanford Medical School,
was in attendance with her 11 -year
old son. "I wanted to expose my
son to her vision of relationships."
she said.
After reading her stories, Paley
answered questions about her ap
proach to writing and her thoughts
about the autobiographical and fic
tional influences in writing.
She said that she prefers to think
of fiction as "storytelling," a genre
that could include autobiography.
She said that she tries to teach her
students to be storytellers. She has
taught creative writing classes at
Syracuse. Columbia and Stanford.
English Professor Tobias Wolff
was also in attendance last night.
"It may be years before we see
another writer like her." Wolff
said. "It's a real treat to have Grace
come and read to us. She's one of
the greatest American short story
writers."
