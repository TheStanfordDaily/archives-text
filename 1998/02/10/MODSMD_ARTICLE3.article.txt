good long look at the face of the
religious right last night as Ralph
Reed, the former head of the
Christian Coalition, shared his vi

Reed was speaking to an audi

hall and was heavily composed of
people who had come to hear
views with which they disagreed.
He acknowledged the opinions
of the audience, noting that he
hoped for "interesting and en
livening debate about the future of
our country."
Received with polite applause,
Reed presented a vision of an
America that needs to change in
many ways to meet the demands of
the next century but in which "the
American idea and the American
ideal" never go out of date.

Ralph Reed, former executive director of the Christian Coalition, oelivers a speech Â»n
Memorial Auditorium last night. Reed is currently the president of Security Strategies,
a campaign and marketing company for conservative political candidates
heavily influenced by three changes.
The end of the Cold War, Reed
said, removed the "exigency" that
had allowed the expansion of gov
ernment to its present level.
Reed's second noted change was
the aging of the Baby Boom genera
tion, a generation he said had
brought the country the anti-war,
civil rights and free speech move
ments. as well as a record stock mar
ket. This generation is now turning
to traditional values and "a new pol
itics of the soul."
Finally, he noted the new "global
information-based economy of the
21st century." He said that this eco
nomic change would result in"the
rise of small business and the de
cline of big business."
He quoted rising numbers for
the percentage of Americans who
work in businesses employing
fewer than 50 people and said these
smaller businesses would focus

heavily on enterprise and demand
lower taxes and less restrictive reg
ulations.
"We've taken a nation of work
ers and turned it into a nation of en
trepreneurs," he said.
Among his proposed solutions
was to revise a lax code he said
"punishes marriage, punishes work,
punishes savings and punishes
child-bearing," replacing it with an
"easy-to-understand, single-rate
tax" that would not tax money
needed to raise children or create
jobs.
He also championed several spe
cific measures aimed at reforming
the public school system by reduc
ing federal bureaucracy and allow
ing people to establish tax-free ac
counts to pay for private, parochial
or home-based education from
kindergarten on.
After this hour-long speech.
Reed gave his answers to a series of
invariably polite but often combat
ive questioners.
Asked where the specifically
Christian values he endorsed lit into

an America increasing composed
of people from very different faiths
and backgrounds. Reed denied that
this implied a conflict.
He listed the virtues he endorsed
as personal responsibility, stable
family structures, hard work, hon
esty and charity.
"This is controversial?" he
asked, saying that he had worked in.
among others, the Muslim commu
nity in Atlanta and had found wide
enthusiasm for his views.
Pressed by another questioner,
he denied that he intended to or
would be able to enact an agenda so
specifically oriented toward his reli
gious and cultural views as to be un
acceptable to a majority of the
American people. He said that in his
role at the Christian Coalition, he
had disagreed with "reconstruction
ists" who had favored turning the
entire legal code of Moses into a
20th-century legislative agenda.
When a questioner told Reed, to
a spontaneous round of applause,
that he didn't see a place in Reed's
agenda for himself as an openly gay

man. Reed took issue with his
premise.
"I don't think your sexual prefer
ence is an issue I think your ide
ology is the issue," Reed said,
adding that it was incorrect to de
duce a political attitude either from
religion or sexual orientation and
that he knew of many Christians
w ho disagreed with his conservative
agenda and many homosexuals who
agreed with it.
Many of those who questioned
Reed appeared dissatisfied with his
answers, and the crowd's main dis
plays of spontaneity were for the
more combative of the questioners.
Hut his eloquent, never-at-a-loss
style did not go unnoticed.
"I'm pretty impressed with him,"
said one audience member after
ward. who admitted he was also im
pressed with the questioners and
the level of the debate. He called the
speech a "very positive event."
He smilingly declined to give his
name, however, noting that being
impressed with Reed would not be
considered a popular position.
