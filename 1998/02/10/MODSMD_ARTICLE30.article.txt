for a berth in the American Club
Hockey Association's national
tournament. Stanford desperately
needed to put together a solid se

play a pair of games at Washing

Once again, however, the in
consistency that has plagued the
Cardinal all season long led to a
series split, and may well have put
an end to Stanford's hopes for a
national tournament berth.
Following a convincing 5-2 win

ington State came into the week
end needing a sweep of the Cardi
nal to qualify for the season-end
ing Pac-8 Conference Tourna
ment. Stanford coach Rich Fahey
felt that the life and death nature
of this series gave the Cougars a
mental edge.
"Washington State came to
play this weekend." Fahey said.
"They knew they had to win to
stay in the playoff picture, and
their sense ol urgency was evident
on the ice. They were fired up
from the beginning of Friday's
game, and we were lucky to come
away with that win."

times, the two teams were dead
locked at three late in the high
scoring first period.
But the Cougars put the puck
in the net late in the stanza to take
a 4-3 advantage heading into the
locker room. Following another
Washington State goal in the final
minute of the second period,
Stanford found itself trailing 5-3
and in need of a small miracle to
get the win.
"From the beginning of the
third period, we tried to throw
everything at them." Fahey said.
"We just couldn't get the puck in
the net. no matter how hard we

worked."
By the end of the final period,
the Cardinal had run out of legs
and gave up a late goal, making
the final score 6-3.
There are many possible rea
sons for Stanford's letdown. The
Cardinal did not bring as many
players as usual on the road trip,
and as a result were hurt by a
shorter bench. Already drained
from a week of midterms, most
players were asked to pull double
shifts in order to make up for the
lack of manpower.
Regardless of all these poten
tial excuses, the loss further re
duced the probability that the
Cardinal will receive a bid in the
national tournament. Stanford
finished second in the Pac-8 be
hind the likely fourth seed in the
West Regional, USC (18-3. 15-3
Pac-8). The Cardinal split the sea
son series with the Trojans at two
games apiece.
Although there is disappoint
ment that Stanford does not ap
pear to be headed back to the na
tional tournament, there is cer
tainly a lot left to play for. First,
the Cardinal faces off against Bay
Area arch rival California on Fri
day in its final home game of the
season.
Second, with its second-place
conference finish. Stanford quali
fied for the Pac-8 Tournament,
which will be played Feb. 21 and
22.
In this season-ending confer
ence tournament, the Cardinal
will have a chance to make up for
a disappointing season dominated
by inconsistency and make a
statement to the Trojans and the
rest of the Pac-8.
"Hopefully we will meet IJSC
in the finals of the Pac-8 tourna
ment," Fahey said. "In all likeli
hood. they will be headed to the
national tournament, but we'd
like to prove that we are the bet
ter team. II nothing else, that
game would give us bragging
rights."
