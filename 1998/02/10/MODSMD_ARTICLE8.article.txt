## Aid arrives in Afghanistan 
### 
RUSTAQ, Afghanistan (AP) —
The first desperately needed aid
trickled in yesterday for earthquake
victims in Afghanistan's mountains
— on trucks where roads were pass
able, on donkeys where snow and
ice were too deep.
Survivors slowly walked out.
with stories of whole families lost.
Frozen bodies were strewn
across devastated towns and vil
lages, many still unburied after
Wednesday's 6.1-magnitude quake
crumbled hillside homes of mud
and brick or buried them under
landslides.
Rescue workers say as many as
5,000 died in the quake and a series
of ruinous aftershocks.
One girl wept as she tried to
recount how her entire family of
seven was crushed under the rubble
of their home in the northeastern
village of Khojah Khirat.
"It's so painful, so painful," 7-
year-old Bahrish whispered, her
eyes brimming with tears. "I don't
know if I have any relatives left."
She was among more than 100
people yesterday in the only clinic
in the hard-hit town of Rustaq,
reached by an Associated Press
reporter on one of the first aid
flights into the quake area.
The patients lay in darkness on
the building's dirt floor — the clin
ic's power had gone out.
Hundreds of villagers carried
heavy bundles and led goat herds
down muddy roads in the region,
seeking shelter or fleeing in fear of
more tremors.
A Pakistani air force cargo jet
and a Red Cross turbo-prop plane
landed in nearby Hajaghar yester
day, bringing medical and sanita
tion supplies, blankets and tents to
the thousands left homeless in tem
peratures below freezing.

Military trucks carrying the relief
supplies lumbered slowly toward
Rustaq, 25 miles away, where hun
dreds of quake refugees were seek
ing shelter.
"We don't know where the
(refugees) will stay, and we are try
ing to organize a camp so they don't
just spread around the town." said
Juan Martinez of the Red Cross.
Qari Amir Ailam. an official
with the military alliance that con
trols the region, said yesterday that
at least 4,(KK) people were killed in
the quake and subsequent after
shocks. Previous estimates have
ranged from 2.(KM) to S.(XX).
Twenty villages were destroyed
or damaged by the landslides, said
Allam, who met the cargo flight.
"The dead bodies now are
frozen," Allam said. "We must dig
them up and bury them properly."
Allam said the latest aftershock
rumbled through one or two vil
lages Sunday, killing more than 2(H)
people.
"We desperately need outside
help," he said, its Pakistani cadets
and Afghan forces unloaded more
than 2(X) blankets and 2(H) tents
from the cargo jet. which later
returned to Islamabad.
Aid groups have been scram
bling to reach the area, nestled at
the junction of the 1 lindu Kush and
Pamir mountains, since Friday,
when reports of the first quake
emerged.
A U.N. team was approaching
Rustaq on donkeys and horses after
a U.N. truck convoy proved unable
to make its way through snow-cov
ered mountain passes.
The team reached a village on
the outskirts of the affected area,
where it reported 320 people had
died and 4(M) were injured, local
officials told khnlili.
