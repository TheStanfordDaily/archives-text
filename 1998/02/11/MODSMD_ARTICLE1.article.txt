### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
ASSU Presi
dent Emily An
drus will deliver
the second annu
al State of the As
soeiation address
tonight, just in
time to fulfill one
of her constitu
tional require-

ments.
Andrus' speech tops the agenda
of the X:3() p.m. meeting of the
ASSU Senate in room ISH) of the
Law School. The meeting was
pushed back from the ASSIJ's nor
mal I uesday night slot to accommo
date Andrus, according to Senate
Chair Joe Freund.
"She couldn't make it Tuesday,"
Freund said, "so rather than have
someone else deliver it. or not deliv
er it at all, we decided to move it
hack."
Andrus said she had a "mandato
ry engagement" last night that

would have kept her from speaking.
"Joe and I debated an additional
meeting, but we decided this would
be best." she said. "We just wanted
to make sure we were in compliance
with the constitution."
The ASSU Constitution requires
the president to deliver a State of the
Association address between the
third and fifth week of winter quar
ter. with public notice of meeting
time posted two weeks before the
address.
"My philosophy is it's best to
keep with the constitution as much
as possible." Freund said.
ASSU Vice President Ben Deck
er said the meeting was postponed in
order to allow more senators to at
tend.
"There were a myriad of schedul
ing conflicts," he said. "The senate
has a lot of important things to d 0...
We felt a lot more people could
come [Wednesday night]."
Most senators won't have a prob
lem with the change. Freund said,
but at least two will not be able to at


Andrus
