# Andrus' speech to top ASSU meeting
## 
### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
ASSU Presi
dent Emily An
drus will deliver
the second annu
al State of the As
soeiation address
tonight, just in
time to fulfill one
of her constitu
tional require-

ments.
Andrus' speech tops the agenda
of the X:3() p.m. meeting of the
ASSU Senate in room ISH) of the
Law School. The meeting was
pushed back from the ASSIJ's nor
mal I uesday night slot to accommo
date Andrus, according to Senate
Chair Joe Freund.
"She couldn't make it Tuesday,"
Freund said, "so rather than have
someone else deliver it. or not deliv
er it at all, we decided to move it
hack."
Andrus said she had a "mandato
ry engagement" last night that

would have kept her from speaking.
"Joe and I debated an additional
meeting, but we decided this would
be best." she said. "We just wanted
to make sure we were in compliance
with the constitution."
The ASSU Constitution requires
the president to deliver a State of the
Association address between the
third and fifth week of winter quar
ter. with public notice of meeting
time posted two weeks before the
address.
"My philosophy is it's best to
keep with the constitution as much
as possible." Freund said.
ASSU Vice President Ben Deck
er said the meeting was postponed in
order to allow more senators to at
tend.
"There were a myriad of schedul
ing conflicts," he said. "The senate
has a lot of important things to d 0...
We felt a lot more people could
come [Wednesday night]."
Most senators won't have a prob
lem with the change. Freund said,
but at least two will not be able to at


Andrus
tend tonight because of the switch.
"It is going to be an inconvenience
for a couple people who can't
come," he said, "but it's the one op
tion we have. It minimizes the incon
venience."
The speech will evaluate the
ASSU's mid year goals and accom
plishments. Andrus said.
It will "really focus on the rest of
the year," she said. "We want to
make sure that the goals and the pro
jects that we have been working on"
get carried out to the finish.
Among the issues scheduled for
senate discussion following the
speech are votes on the confirma
tion of a new hearings officer, the es
tablishment of new umbrella groups
and a senate bill to create the ASSU
Alliance to Control Tuition.
Decker expects the senate to ap
prove senior Brian Lee as hearings

officer. He will join sophomore Elec
tions Commissioner Dan Perkl in
overseeing the spring ASSU elec
tion.
"I think this year we'll have one
of the best elections commissions
we've had in a while, as far as experi
ence is concerned," Decker said.
Groups that share common
members and organization goals can
apply to seek special fees under one
"umbrella group." such as the Asian
American Student Association, on
the spring ballot. The senate will
consider several new umbrella
groups tonight.
For special fee purposes, "it's es
sential for the groups that they get
umbrella group status," Freund said.
Senate Deputy Chair Matt
Spence proposed the alliance at the
senate's Jan. 27 meeting. The
group's purpose is to conduct re
search on tuition increases and pre
sent the findings to the Board of
Trustees, with the goal of keeping
tuition hikes lower.
