## High on nicotine 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — A major
American tobacco company is sell
ing cigarettes made with genetically
altered, high-nicotine tobacco
despite assurances to the govern
ment it had stopped the practice
lour years ago.
The genetically altered tobacco
packs twice the nicotine of natural
leaf. „
The secret use of the ingredient
was disclosed by Roger Black,
director of leaf blending for Brown
& Williamson Tobacco Corp., in a
Jan. 16 deposition for New York
state's class-action suit against the
major tobacco companies.
The deposition was conducted
in private, and the transcript was
ordered sealed by ;i state Supreme
C ourt judge. However, a letter
summarizing the testimony was
found by The Associated Press in a
public court file.
Yesterday afternoon. Brown &
Williamson issued a statement
acknowledging that genetically
altered, high-nicotine tobacco was
currrentlv being used "in small
amounts in certain brands, like
Raleigh. Richland. Prime and Sum
mit."
The use of the genetically
altered tobacco doesn't mean
Americans are smoking cigarettes

with higher nicotine levels.
Instead, Brown & Williamson
says it uses the ingredient to control
nicotine content. By blending nico
tine-enhanced leaf with weaker
tobaccos, it produces a variety of
brands with varying nicotine levels
to satisfy smokers' differing tastes.
Nevertheless, the disclosure
could prove a significant develop
ment instate lawsuits against
cigarette companies and in the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration's
drive to regulate the industry on
grounds that cigarettes deliver an
addictive drug. Critics will see il as
more evidence the company
manipulates dosages of nicotine,
the addictive chemical in tobacco,
in order to "hook" smokers.
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., told
of the Black deposition by the AP.
said the deposition was"the most
compelling case to date to force our
government to stop sitting on its
hands when there's proven evi
dence that a company is manipulat
ing cigarettes in a way that will poi
son youngsters."
In 1994, the FDA learned the
company had spent more than a
decade developing a nicotine-rich
plant. Code-named Y-l, the plant is
the product of state-of-the-art
breeding techniques
