# Satcher chosen
## Vacant surgeon general spot Tilled 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Dr.
David Satcher. who rose from an
impoverished childhood in rural
Alabama to head the Centers for
Disease Control, overcame con
servative objections to win confir
mation as surgeon general yester
day.
He fills a high-profile but polit
ically risky job that has been
vacant for more than three years
as President Clinton searched lor
someone who could speak with
authority on public health and also
win Senate approval.
"This is an American dream
come true," Satcher. 56. said in a
statement, "to go from a humble
farm in Anniston. Ala., to the
office of surgeon general, to have
the chance to serve the country I
love, and to earn the confidence of
so many leaders 1 honor and
respect."
Satcher was approved on a 63-
35 vote despite arguments by
some conservatives that his posi
tions on abortion and other issues
rendered him unfit. All the
Democrats voted for Satcher. but
Republicans were divided, with 1M

voting lor the nomination and 35
against.
President Clinton did not
directh acknowledge the criticism
hut called Satcher "a mainstream
physician who is an eloquent advo
cate for the health of all Ameri
cans."
"No one is better qualified than
Dr. Satcher to he America's doc
tor." Clinton said in a statement
after the vote. He said Satcher will
he "a leading voice" • n the effort
to pass comprehensive tobacco
legislation this year.
Satcher visited the Capitol
briefly yesterday morning, then
watched the Senate action from
the surgeon general's office at the
Department of Health and Human
Services, vacant since Dr Joycelvn
Elders resigned in late 19V4.
On Friday morning. Satcher
will be sworn in as both surgeon
general and assistant secretary ol
HHS for health.
The surgeon general's post
commands little inherent power,
but it serves as the nation's top
bully pulpit on public health
issues.
