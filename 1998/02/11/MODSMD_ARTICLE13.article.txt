# Naturalization fraud investigated

### 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Examiner Pete
Ahr suspected something was seriously amiss in the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's citizenship
testing program as long ago as 1992.
Ahr's job was to conduct interviews with applicants
for I I.S. citizenship after they had passed written tests in
American history, civics and English comprehension.
"Good morning," he would say to each applicant.
"Will you please remain standing and raise your right
hand?"
Many would stare blankly, hands at their sides, 112 Hh
ers would nod and take a seat.
Ahr's suspicions turned out to be justified. I eder*al
prosecutors say that private companies and individuals
under contract to administer the INS exams have been
charging immigrants up to $S(X) to supply them with
fraudulent passing scores.
Twenty people operating or working for these busi
nesses were charged in indictments unsealed last month
in Sacramento. Another person was charged in
Phoenix, and investigations are under way in several
other INS regions.
In addition, the INS on Monday announced a long
awaited tightening of security in the naturalization pro
cess. Written tests, now administered both at INS
offices and by companies at nearly I.(XH) sites nation

wide, will probably be administered by a single nation
al contractor, under closer INS supervision.
More than 13.(XK) people were tested by companies
accused of selling test certificates, but no one is certain
how many of those ultimately obtained citizenship
fraudulently.
It was in 1991 that the INS moved to make its citi
zenship testing program more accessible by allowing
companies to administer the written tests.
According to prosecutors, however, some of these
businesses sent recruiters to ethnic communities around
the"afyntry. seeking people willing to pay $125 to $S(M)
for a guaranteed passihg score. The exam costs jiWt $30
when administered by the INS.
Ahr, who worked in the INS Phoenix office, soon
realized that of the applicants who supposedly had
passed English-comprehension tests administered by
these companies, half "couldn't function in English."
One reason the scam wasn't exposed earlier was that
INS policy prevented examiners from challenging the
validity of the written tests unless presented with clear
evidence of fraud. Also. INS was dealing with an over
whelming backlog of citizenship applications.
"It took a heck of a lot more work to deny an appli
cation than to approve one." said former INS agent
John Lines, now an agent with the Inspector General.
