Career fair should
help liberal arts
majors find jobs

F.OR THE FIRST time, the
Career Planning and Place
ment Center will be sponsoring
a two day career and internship fair
targeting liberal arts majors. Tomor
row and Friday, students will have a
chance to learn about careers in the
humanities as well as explore oppor
tunities in human resources and pub
lic relations departmartments at
investment banking, consulting and
computer technology firms.
Day one is geared towards students
seeking jobs and internships in public
service. Day two will attract students
interested in business and communica
tions. Altogether, the fair will bring
together 150 companies.
We applaud the CPPC for recogniz
ing the needs of the other half of Stan
ford. In previous fairs, students desir
ing careers in publishing, media and
marketing rushed past tables brim
ming with free mugs, key chains and
mousepads inscribed with the names
of Silicon Valley firms and headed
towards the one table listed under
"communications." Often they were

disappointed by what they found.
These job-seekers were forced to
research career opportunities on their
own. without the privilege of going
from table to table to drop off
resumes.
At a time when students are
increasingly concerned about the mar
ketability of their degrees, it's reassur
ing to know that there are jobs avail
able for humanities majors. It's impor
tant that students, starting their fresh
man year, recognize the wide range of
career options available to them â€”
this lessens the pressure on students to
major in something "practical."
The liberal arts career and intern
ship fair also provides students with
the opportunity to meet the profes
sionals in their fields and learn more
about the industries. However, some
students seeking more creative ways to
use their liberal arts degrees may be
disappointed at the careers represent
ed.
Recognizing that it serves a diverse
student body, the CPPC has taken a
positive step forward in showcasing
opportunities for humanities students.
However, the next step is to encourage
these companies to recruit and inter
view on campus.
So to all the fuzzies out there, here's
your chance to work the tables and
drop off those resumes.
