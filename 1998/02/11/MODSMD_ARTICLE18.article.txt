# Campus Viewpoint: Anthony Lim
## Searching for 'it' on The Farm 
### 
I ENTERED Stanford
four years ago full of
excitement at the
intellectual journey that
awaited me. This unbri
dled enthusiasm lasted
through the first two
weeks of CIV lecture.
Then I began a precipi-

tous downward descent into the realm of 4
a.m. nights, 1 p.m. breakfasts and ASSU
Lecture Notes.
Since that time, I wish I could say that I
have made unimaginable strides in my aca
demic knowledge. I wish I could say that I
grasp the fundamental principles of physics
after a year of 9 a.m. classes, that I can
intelligently discuss the various theories of
Kant. Locke and Rousseau, that Econ 1
crystallized the importance of the nation's
budget deficit, that the 30 units of material I
slaved over in the Human Biology core has
not all somehow magically vaporized from
my mind... but alas, I cannot. Thus, as a
graduating senior reflecting on my Stanford
experience, the question that immediately
comes to mind is: What exactly did I learn
during my time here?
What I learned did not transpire within
the lecture hall — it cannot be "taught." Its
psychological impact is not understood by
attending Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbar

do's Psych 1 lectures. Its underlying biolog
ical and physiological mechanisms are
beyond even the expertise of Biology Prof.
Robert Sapolsky. Its chemical nature is
composed of elements which have yet to
appear on the periodic table. It is intangible,
indescribable, inconceivable and improba
ble — and yet it is more real than anything
I have come to know.
It's mustering up the nerve freshman
year to ask the same girl three separate
times to start "going out" with you, all three
attempts resulting either in rejection or
acceptance, followed by retraction two days
later. It's saying to hell with words, and wait
ing until the moment is just right to convene
a meeting of the lips ... only to be denied.
It's knowing that despite the multiple rejec
tions. there is something exceptional about
her that's preventing you from giving up and
moving on. It's being rewarded for your per
sistence a year later when Valentine's Day
finally brings the two of you together.
It's covering her face with artificial snow
on University Avenue during Christmas
time. It's doing the salsa. It's invading each
other's personal space without feeling
uncomfortable. It's being vulnerable and
risking everything. It's jumping into the
Claw and pulling her in after you. It's using
the same toothbrush. It's knowing that one
person understands you. It's catching a

glimpse of two deer kissing each other at
the zoo. It's rubbing noses. It's Rollerblad
ing through Stanford Shopping Mall at 4
a.m.
It's arguing passionately and making up
even more passionately. It's realizing that
she's smarter than you and loving that
about her. It's surviving nine straight
months of long distance (six of them sepa
rated by continents). It's offering her the
last bite of your favorite food. It's eagerly
awaiting the future that lies ahead.
It's understanding that Human Biology
Prof. Hermit Katchadourian's explanation
of consummate love — that true love is the
meeting of three distinct areas: intimacy,
passion and commitment — is not simply an
abstract theory, but an attainable reality.
For those of you who have already found
it, always remember to nurture it. cherish it
and never let go of it. For those who have
yet it) encounter it, it is the one thing that I
hope all of you discover during your Stan
ford or post-Stanford years. Simply put, it is
the unforgettable experience of searching
for love, falling in love and most important
of all, being in love.

Arroyo buddies who were there from the
