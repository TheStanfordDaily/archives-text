University should focus
on disaster prevention
The spin is on. In Monday's Daily
(Feb. 9) the dean of students praised stu
dents and staff for valiantly rescuing
threatened library books.
Certainly those people deserve
applause for their backbreaking efforts.
But this feel-good spin is designed to
omit the no-less-deserved blame for let
ting this debacle happen.
Higher-ups in management and con
struction oversight signed off on the
obviously inadequate barrier between
Green Library and the construction pro
ject next to it.
Furthermore, several other basements
— the Jonsson Library of Government
Documents, the Braun Music Library,
the Education School — were flooded
and damaged.
Were these areas reasonably protect
ed? Probably not. But if indeed they
WERE, doesn't all the destruction make
one wonder whether it was wise to put
those priceless basement collections at
the end of the Mayfield Avenue water
slide?
This expensive washout continues a
sad Stanford tradition of bungling disas
ter planning. The 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake revealed that Stanford had
amazingly, in quake-prone northern Cal
ifornia. skipped out on earthquake insur
ance!
That decision only cost Stanford more
than $ 1 (K) million and retarded construc
tion for about six years.
Students, tuition-paying parents and

donors should be questioning why Stan
ford's administrators have chosen to fix
disasters after they occur, rather than
show some foresight.

Lack of Events Office
weakens Medical School
By far the most public and regrettable
display of Stanford Medical School's
weaknesses happened last Saturday
when speaker after speaker spoke to a
nearly empty Fairchild Auditorium dur
ing an important conference titled
"Medical Education: Lessons for the
New Millennium."
The conference, organized by medical
students, was supported by an array of
prestigious sponsors ranging from the
Association of American Medical Col
leges (AAMC) to the Lucile Packard
and Palo Alto Medical foundations. Its
purpose, according to the organizers,
was to strive for perspectives on and
solutions for the issues facing medical
education.
The featured speakers included Dr.
Jordan J. Cohen, president of the
AAMC, and Dr. Philip R Lee. IK S;in
Francisco professor and former assistant
secretary of health.
One would have thought that the
importance of the topic, coming at a time
of large national debate about health
policy and troubling conflicts facing
medical education, would have guaran

teed lull attendance by deans, senior
administrators and faculty, not just a
handful of medical students and a couple
of emeriti.
That the conference failed to attract
faculty participation, however, could
mean that either the school is losing its
depth of talent interested in medical
education or that education is a low pri
ority. As a former staff member, I
decline to believe that either of these
propositions is true.
The most obvious explanation may be
that during the various cycles of budget
cuts, the medical school abolished its
Office of Public Events. That office saw
to it that school conferences were effi
ciently run and well-publicized.
And it made sure that the leadership
was not only kept informed about
school-sponsored events, but it also
played a visible and very strong support
ive role.
In most cases, it was simply a matter
for the dean's office to pull itself up and
kick some ass to get an apathetic facul
ty's attention focused on important pub
lic issues and events.
