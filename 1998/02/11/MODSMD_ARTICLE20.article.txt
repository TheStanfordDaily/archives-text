## Taking an inside look into Knight life 
### 
Roberta Oster

Last February i was in Dallas
chasing down a story. It was a blur
of ccll phone calls, tough interviews
with recalcitrant sources, nearly missed
planes and fast-looming deadlines — just
the kind of adrenaline-charged life that is
all a part of working for network televi
sion.
This February. I sit at my desk alone in
a quiet neighborhood in Palo Alto, with a
blank piece of paper and an assignment to
compose a 16-line iambic pentameter
poem lor English Lecturer Chris Wiman's
poetry class. An easy task? Think again,
because returning to school has been one
ol the hardest things I have done in a long
time.
As a producer for NBC News. "Date
line, I produce stories on social issues and
politics, as well as profiles and investigative
segments. My job is to listen and distill
intormation without imposing my opinion.
In the rush of the work world, where
everything was due yesterday and there is
little time to reflect, so much of what I do
involves telling other people's stories.

What motivates a great musician like
8.8. King? Did the high-tech entrepreneur
conspire to sell secrets to the Soviet bloc?
Why would someone take a solo boat trip
around the world? How would Proposition
IK7 affect immigrants and our educational
system?
Now. I find, the story is me. As one of
19 lucky journalists invited as Knight fel
lows to audit courses at Stanford for a year.
I am challenged to offer my opinion and to
imbue my work with my own inner vision.
1 he expectation of the fellowship is that
we pursue whatever course of study inter
ests us — that we indulge our intellect and
curiosity.
I've been Rollerblading to classes
(before the recent deluge) — auditing
courses on drawing, yoga, the short story,
education and public policy and constitu
tional law. What a joy to read for the plea
sure of reading, to learn how to shade a
vase and to analyze the development of the
First Amendment.
At a time when the public is questioning
media ethics, I feel fortunate to study with

a constitutional scholar like Law Prof.
Kathleen Sullivan. All my courses are
helping to redirect my thinking as a jour
nalist. And I am learning as much from the
poets and painters here as I an. Rom the
policy experts.
I am also seeing the world through the
eyes of an inspiring group of young people.
In my art class, students produce evocative
sell-portraits with personal and political
messages. I heir vision is changing my per
spective on art. In English Prof. Tobias
Wolffs fiction writing class last term, I
remember a student's story about a boy
whose father threw him out of a pickup
truck in the middle of a thunder storm.
Those characters still haunt me.
As Knight fellows we also attend week
ly seminars with scholars, business leaders,
politicians and scientists. Just a few weeks
ago. Harold Ickes reflected on the time he
served as deputy chief of staff in the Clin
ton White House. But as a reminder that
no matter where you find yourself, real life
can rear its ugly head — Ickes was called
back to Washington right after our seminar

to help with damage control on the latest
scandal. I count my blessings every day.
I may be a student now, hut I still can
not contain my journalistic instincts, and I
have a few questions about life at Stan
lord, 112 irst, where is the romance? When I
was in college, love was part of the cur
riculum. At Stanford I see a lot of golf,
tennis and computer science. Maybe it all
happens in on-line chat rooms or on
someone's Web page.
Second, where is the angst? Knight fel
low Ann Grimes ol the Washington Post
says students here "seem to fret much less
than I did at their age." With all these
demanding professors, students never
seem to break a sweat. I hey calmly sip
their decaf-skim cappuccinos and all-fruit
smoothies while somehow assimilating all
the information from phone-book sized
syllabi. When I asked a senior about this,
she responded, "We're all filled with anxi
ety, but we hide it."
When I was an undergraduate at
Georgetown I was very serious, and was so
busv scrambling for internships on Capitol

Hill and the "MacNeil / Lehrer Report,"
thai I had no time to write poetry or take
art classes. I was focused on networking for
future jobs and I missed the chance to he a
student and pursue the pure pleasure of
learning.
My advice? Hnjoy it. all of it right
now. As Knight fellow Alvin Bessent of
Newsday in New York says. " This experi
ence at Stanford is a rare and valuable life
lesson One thing I know for sure is. you
will likely never have a time again when
><>u can read with abandon, fall in and out
of love and be responsible only to yourself.
I here is little I can remember about all
the particulars of that story in Dallas,
except for the result lhat later flickered on
a television screen for 20 minutes then
was gone. V1\ poem, which I have taken to
calling nn iambic follv. is prohabh not that
good But it is mine created for no rea
son except to learn hov\ to do it. And that,
of course, has made all the difference.
