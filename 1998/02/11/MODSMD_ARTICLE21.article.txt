What arc shin
splints, how do you get
them, and what can you
do about them?

A Dear Reader,
The term "shin
splints" generally refers
to any sort of pain ail
ment of the lower leg. Although
experts differ when explaining
what the exact condition is, most
agree that it involves the two mus
cles swathing the shinbone that
run from the knee to the ankle.
These muscles point the foot up
and down and support the arch
and the front of the fcx)t so as to
prevent the foot from slapping
while walking or running. Injuries
that result in small tears of the
fibers in these muscles (i.e.,
overexertion, over-running, lifting
too many weights) can bring on
shin splints.
Shin splints may also be related
to an unusual condition known as
Compartment Syndrome. People
with Compartment Syndrome
have muscles which grow abnor
mally large. Stress fractures in the
shinbone and irritation to the
nerves in the shin are also associ
ated with shin splints.
Any unusual or repetitive stress
to the lower leg can result in shin
splints in both the novice and sea
soned athlete. Runners, cyclists,
skiers and aerobic dancers put
themselves at greatest risk due to
the nature of body movement and
localization of leg strain in their
respective sports. People who

have bowl-legged disorders, flat
feet, knock-knees, or poorly cush
ioned shoes will also suffer from
shin splints. Exercising on unyield
ing surlaces such as concrete is
also known to contribute to this
condition.
If you develop shin splints, doc
tors will usually recommend tradi
tional sports medicine therapy.
RICE (rest, ice, compression, ele
vation) is often an initial treat
ment. Crutches are often recom
mended to keep weight off of the
injured leg and aspirin or ibupro
fen regimens are suggested to
reduce inflammation and pain.
Keep off your feet to rest your
legs, apply ice in alternating inter
vals (e.g., 20 minutes on, 20 min
utes off), wrap your leg in an elas
tic sports bandage (e.g., ACE ban
dage works well) to compress the
tissues and prevent swelling and
keep your leg elevated to reduce
blood pressure in the inflamed tis
sues.
The way to prevent shin splints
is to cut down as much as possible
on the stresses that cause the con
dition to flare. Wear good sup
portive shoes, and check with a
podiatrist about inserts to com
pensate for postural disorders that
may contribute to injury. Stretch
ing exercises for the muscles in the
toes, heel, knee and lower leg can
help condition the muscles and
make them more resistant to
injury.
Exercising on resilient surfaces
such as wood or earth will also
help. If your condition worsens or
persists after three days of treat
ment, you may have muscle or ten
don damage and should consult
your doctor as soon as possible.
