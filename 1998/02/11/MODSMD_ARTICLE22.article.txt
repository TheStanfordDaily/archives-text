# Philip Zimbardo:
## From the South Bronx to Hollywood 
### Michael Hope Contributing writer 
In an era when scientific research often seems
only to extend existing theories, wrestle with
minutiae or inhabit a realm extremely divorced
from the everyday person, it is refreshing to hear
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo discuss the
trajectory of his career and research.
Zimbardo speaks with great energy and sin
cerity about how his research ideas have
emerged from his personal experiences and.
more often than not, from the classroom. When
you consider that his research projects range
from studies of madness and time perspective to
investigations of deindividuation and the under
pinnings of shyness, you come to realize that
both Zimbardo's life and teaching must be teem
ing with inspiration and intrigue.
Though Zimbardo remembers the South
Bronx neighborhood in which he grew up as a
"lovely ghetto," he also recalls that as a small,
sickly kid in this neighborhood, he was "beat up
everyday." However, instead of harboring
resentment, Zimbardo has since tried to under
stand the prevailing attitudes and pitfalls of this
environment. Ultimately, he has come to charac
terize his former neighborhood as intensely
"present-oriented."
To explain this phenomenon. Zimbardo uses
the example of his father, a poor Sicilian immi
grant who had incredible facility with his hands.
Without any formal training. Zimbardo's father
was able to learn the intricacies of electrical
wiring so that, in 1948. he was able to craft his
own 6-inch television. At the time, TVs were
extremely rare, allowing the Zimbardo family to
make a little money by charging the neighbors 50
cents to watch the World Series that year.
Yet, to Zimbardo's astonishment, his father
never fully marketed his skill, be it crafting TVs
from scratch or refurbishing pianos. To explain
this lack of ambition, Zimbardo speaks of a pre
occupation with the present brought on by the
immediate hardships of his neighborhood that
blinded his father to the potential of the future.
This notion that one's time perspective can pro
foundly affect how one functions in the world has
blossomed into one of Zimbardo's main research
interests. In his opinion, it can help explain why
certain communities have come to be viewed as
less motivated and ambitious than others.
If not for the encouragement of his teachers,
Zimbardo recalls, he might have followed the
path of the majority of kids in his neighborhood:
menial labor directly following high school.
Instead, he made his way through Brooklyn Col
lege, studying psychology and sociology/anthro
pology, and eventually to graduate school at
Yale.

As a professor at New York University in the
l l >6os. Zimbardo more than repaid his deht to
the teaching world, often taking on as man\ as 13
semester classes a year: five each semester and
three in the summer. This enthusiasm for teach
ing continued when he arrived at Stanford in
I%K, earning him the Walter J. Gores Award.
Stanford's highest teaching honor. He can also
boast, with some credibility, that he has taught
more students than any other professor at Stan
ford. !■*'•
One would think that this love of teaching
would become overwhelming, if not Wthausting.
but Zimbardo has found time not only to listen
to his students, but also to incorporate mam of
their ideas into his research. For example, in
l l >7(). amid the Vietnam riots. Zimbardo taught a
class called "Social Psychology in Action." which
allowed students to conduct and present
research of their own. One group, who was inter
ested in the effects of prison life, decided to sim

ulate an actual prison experience over the week
end in their dorm. During their presentation the
following week, Zimbardo was shocked b\ the
tension that the exercise produced.
Inspired b\ these students. Zimbardo created
the now infamous "Stanford Prison Experi
ment." It was to be a two-week study with the
goal of investigating the effects of the prison
environment and power dynamics of prison life
on college students. But Zimbardo put an end to
the experiment after six da\s What took place
might well be one of the most dramatic, disturb
ing studies ever conducted, revealing the degree
to which ordinary, well-adjusted people can be
so quickK transformed.
I he effects of Zimbardo's mock prison exper
iment were shocking. Those students assigned as
guards adopted abusive and sadistic behaviors,
making the "prisoners," their own peers, do
