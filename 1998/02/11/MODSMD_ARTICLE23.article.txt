## Plants produce biodegradable plastics 
### Vijay Rao 
Millions of pounds of plastic are
thrown away annually. And year
after year, plastics accumulate in
landfills as plastics take centuries
to break down and fully degrade.
In the meantime, plastic is con
stantly produced, used and cast
away.
Chris Somerville, director of
the Carnegie Institute of Washing
ton's Department of Plant Biology
at Stanford, has discovered a new
method to make biodegradable
plastics using specially engineered
plants.
Somerville has a found a

species of bacteria containing
genes that allow the bacteria to
synthesize plastics. Enzymes pro
duced by these same bacteria can
break down the plastic.
The bacterium, Alcaiigenes
eutrophus, contains three specific
genes within its DNA sequence
that allow it to produce plastic.
Through a three-step chemical
synthesis, the bacteria converts a
molecule called acetyl CoA into
the plastic polymer.
Using gene splicing, the genes
encoding information needed to
create plastic-producing machin
ery can be inserted into the DNA
of plants. These plants then pro

duce and sequester plastic tt> spe
cialized compartments within their
cells.
Following a series of chemical
extractions, plant cellular debris
can he separated from the plastic.
In bacteria, the process of
extracting the plastic is expensive.
Often, plastic synthesized in this
manner costs $4 per pound, versus
just 50 cents per pound for
petroleum-based plastic.
Fortunately, the use of plants in
the production of plastic is much
less expensive.
This biologically produced plas
tic is also biodegradable. Special
degrative enzymes synthesized by
A. i'utrophus can break down the
plastic polymers into their consti
tutive parts in a reversal of the
synthesis process.
Because these plastics are
biodegradable, bacteria can break
down the plastic instead of letting
them pile up in garbage dumps.
To produce the plastic in mass
quantities, these specially engi
neered plants could be commer
cially grown on a large scale on
agricultural land.
The impact of such cultivation
would be huge. Thebiodegradable
character of these plastics would
allow society to control waste
accumulation. Industrial scale
composting could be used to break
down the tons of plastic that are
disposed of every day.
Current plastics are petroleum
based, which means they are
dependent on the oil supply. With
this new type of plastic, not only
would plastic become independent
from both oil and oil prices, but
the oil conserved could be used in

other forms of energy consump
tion.
This discovery could have ;i
major impact in the agricultural
sector of the economy. Currently,
prices for stable food crops, such
as wheat or corn, are low. and
many small farmers are economi
cally devastated when prices
plunge or when bigger companies
compete directly with them in the
market.
With the advent of plastic-pro
ducing plants, farmers may opt to
grow them instead, viewing them
as cash crops much like cotton.
Since small-scale farmers, as well
as companies, have the option to
grow this commodity, plastic-pro
ducing plants could profoundly
affect the agricultural market.
One of the challenges to com
merciali/ing this technology is pre
venting animals from feeding on
the engineered plants and injesting
a potentially lethal dose of plastic.
Solutions to these and other prob
lems are currently being investi
gated.
This new process has the poten
tial to pla> a vital role in the future
of our society. Four years ago. the
Monsanto company bought the
lights to this biological break
through. and the company esti
mates that these plastic-producing
plants will be available to farmers
by the year 2(XW
All the possibilities for a clean
er environment as well as preser
vation of important resources
could be realized in six short years
And Somerville's discovery ctnild
transform all the existing problems
of today into distant memories of
tomorrow.
