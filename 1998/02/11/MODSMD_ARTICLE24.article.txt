Mammograms effective!) detect breast cancer

A Stanford radiologist suggests that despite new
technologies a\ailable lor breast cancer diagnosis, a
routine mammogram coupled with thorough physi
cal examinations is the best wa\ to detect malignant
growths.
New high-tech alternatives to mammography, such
as magnetic resonance imagery (\1RI) or sonogra-

phy. still do not provide the ease .ind effectiveness of mammograms
As Asst. Prof, ot Kadiolog) Robyn Birdwell said. " There's no sub
stitute for routine mammography right now.' Traditional mamniog
raph> uses \-ra\s to produce an image on film.
Birdwell added that "sonography is wonderful tor examining a
known and suspicious growth, but it isn t ver\ useful .is ;i routine
screening device. Likewise. MRI is a wonderful research tool vou
can see a lot ol detail in the breast but it's not a general screening
tool tor breast cancer. Not onl\ is it more expensive, but there is still
a great deal to learn about all ot the information the MRI provides to
the interpreting radiologist."
Current federal guidelines suggest that women should have annu
al mammography screenings beginning at age 4(> Birdwell concurred
"Healths women should start thinking about breast screening at age
40 Fhe\ should work closely with a personal ph\sician thc\ trust, who
can provide a careful breast exam and can help them decide when to
start mammography screenings and how often to repeat them."
Birdwell also noted that a recent Canadian provides evidence that
mammograms are more accurate when performed early in the men
strual cycle. "Although more studies are needed to prove the point,
women might justifiably feci more reassured if they schedule the test
during the first two weeks of their menstrual cycle." she said.
Though mammograms provide an invaluable Ux)l tor doctors to
accurately diagnose breast cancer, it is only part of the equation. "An
interpersonal relationship and communication with your doctor is still
crucial. Birdwell said. "Most women can tell il the breast exam they
are receiving is cursory or thorough, and choosing a doctor w ho will
perform this vital function carefully can make a lifesaving difference."
Breast cancer causes more deaths among women than any other
cancer except lung cancer It is the leading cause of cancer deaths
among American women aged 44) to 55.
