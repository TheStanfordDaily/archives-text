## Va & Rob examine rivalries 
### 
Since Vanessa just completed her last
game against California, a series in
which Va is 10-0 (she's a fifth-year),
we decided to focus this week's col
umn on the Stanford-Cal rivalry and
what can he done to improve it.
Kohin: Vanessa, have you enjoyed
the rivalry with Cal in your athletic
career?
Va: No. Robin. In fact, it hasn't lived

up to that rivalry status. It's no
North Carolina-Duke, Harvard-
Yale, Hatfield-McCoy.
Kohin: Hatfield-McCoy? I'm not
sure I see the connection.
Va: It's not Cal's fault, but as holders
of the prestigious Director's Cup.
it's hard for someone to equal our
athletic prowess.
Kobin: Good point. Last year's cup
was our third in a row, and we were

the first school to break the I.(KK)-
point mark (1,084.5) in the scoring.
But Cal was in the top 25, coming in
with 503.5 points. How do we level
the playing field?
Va: T m taking the high road today,
Robin. I'm calling for an end to the
rivalry. We need to help the less for
tunate, not hurt them. Why must we
hate? Why can't we love?
Kohin: But isn't that part of the

good-natured spirit of a rivalry?
Va: The point of the rivalry is to
push us to become better. We need
to be pushed; we need to make Cal
stronger. I mean, who was Rocky
without Apollo Creed? Or that
scary Russian guy?
Kobin: But Stanford won a record
six NCAA titles last year; Cal only
