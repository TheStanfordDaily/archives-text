## Va & Rob examine rivalries 
### 
Since Vanessa just completed her last
game against California, a series in
which Va is 10-0 (she's a fifth-year),
we decided to focus this week's col
umn on the Stanford-Cal rivalry and
what can he done to improve it.
Kohin: Vanessa, have you enjoyed
the rivalry with Cal in your athletic
career?
Va: No. Robin. In fact, it hasn't lived

up to that rivalry status. It's no
North Carolina-Duke, Harvard-
Yale, Hatfield-McCoy.
Kohin: Hatfield-McCoy? I'm not
sure I see the connection.
Va: It's not Cal's fault, but as holders
of the prestigious Director's Cup.
it's hard for someone to equal our
athletic prowess.
Kobin: Good point. Last year's cup
was our third in a row, and we were

the first school to break the I.(KK)-
point mark (1,084.5) in the scoring.
But Cal was in the top 25, coming in
with 503.5 points. How do we level
the playing field?
Va: T m taking the high road today,
Robin. I'm calling for an end to the
rivalry. We need to help the less for
tunate, not hurt them. Why must we
hate? Why can't we love?
Kohin: But isn't that part of the

good-natured spirit of a rivalry?
Va: The point of the rivalry is to
push us to become better. We need
to be pushed; we need to make Cal
stronger. I mean, who was Rocky
without Apollo Creed? Or that
scary Russian guy?
Kobin: But Stanford won a record
six NCAA titles last year; Cal only


Robin
Davidson
Vanessa
Nygaard
won one. Don't you think there's
only so much we can do as con
trollers of the free world?
Va: Yes. that's why I've come up
with some other possible solutions.
Kohin: Do tell.
V a: First, we could forget about Cal
altogether, which isn't that hard to
do. And split Stanford in half, based
on the ultimate equalizer â€” the al
phabet. I hen we could compete be
tween ourselves, and we could hold a
Stanford Olympics. Oh. that's the
regular Olympics. And I'm sure my
half of the alphabet will win. Cio N-
Z!
Kohin: But Vanessa, I'm a "D.".
We'll be split up. I'd have to find a
new person to write a column with.
Va: There's no one as wittv as me in
A*-M.
Kohin: Yeah, but I've got Kristin
Folkl, a.k.a. Man Hands.

Va: I'm still your mama, punk! See,
it's already heating up.
Kohin: 1 hat sounds logistically im
possible.
Va: Not only that, but people would
just keep changing their name to
Zinkowski to be on my team.
Kohin: Whatever. Baby Hands.
Va: You're asking for it. Yeah, yeah!
Kohin: Well that sounds like an in
teresting solution. What were some
of your other ideas?
Va: Well, my favorite solution tran
scends sports. We could take all the
negative energy that both of our in
stitutions place in this rivalry and
band together to fight an adversary
bigger than ourselves. No. not Nor
way.
Kohin: Then what?!
Va: World hunger. I'm serious. No
one will get mad at us for hating
world hunger. What university offi
cial could protest us saying. "Down
with world hunger. World hunger
sucks! World hunger scored low on
its SA T."

Robin: I don't know about the SAT,
but it sounds like an incredible idea.
You could win a Nobel Prize or
something.
Ya: Chalk up another one for N-Z,
you loser.
Robin: Well it the world hunger
thing doesn't work out, we can al
ways band together against the L.A.
schools. Do you have any other solu
tions?
Ya: No. but Ann Landers might. Did
you know she's an alternate on the
Olympic curling team?
Robin: That's not true.
Ya: Maybe not, but wouldn't that be
cool?
Robin: On that note, maybe we
should end. Do you have any last
words about the Cal rivalry?
Ya: Once a Weenie, always a Weenie.

Vanessa would like to share thai an
elephant's farts in one day produce
enough methane to propel a ear 20
miles.
