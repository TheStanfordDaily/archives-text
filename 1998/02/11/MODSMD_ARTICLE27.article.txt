# Casey Martin awaiting cart verdict
## 
### Ben Hur Senior staff writer 
Casey Martin has already proven
that he is a fearless competitor.
Today, a judge will rule whether he
can keep his professional golfing
dream alive.
Martin, a former Stanford golfer,
has sued the P(iA for what he and
his lawyers consider a violation of

the Americans with Disabilities
Act. The act "prohibits discrimina
tion on the basis of disability in em
ployment, programs and services
provided by state and local govern
ments, goods and services provided
by private companies, and in com
mercial facilities."
The P(iA has stated that despite
Martin's rare circulatory disorder in
his leg. he is not eligible to ride a cart

during rounds when all players are
required to walk the course.
In closing its case yesterday, the
PC iA called upon a top golf official,
who testified that Martin would
gain an advantage by riding a cart in
a game where little things mean a
lot.
P(iA Four commissioner l im
Finchem noted that, on average, the
top 100 players on the tour all play

within Iwo strokes of each other for
every IK holes. Yet top earner I iger
W(xkJs won $2 million last year, and
the 1 (K)th place finisher won only
$250,000.
"Often times, one stroke in the
course of a year can make a differ
ence." Finchem said. "If you pro
vide access to one player or some
subset of players, you are changing
the level of the playing field."
Golf legends Jack Nicklaus and
Arnold Palmer have spoken in favor
of the PC.A s position, citing the
need to maintain the purity of the
game.
The PC.A has also cited a slip
pery-slope argument, stating that if
Martin is allowed to ride a cart, the
door will he open for other players
with less serious problems to ride.
Martin's supporters claim that
Martin seeks no special edge, and
that he simply wants the opportuni
ty to play professional golf. His dis
order makes it extremely painful for
him to walk, and his doctors claim
that Martin's fragile riglv tibia could
snap at any moment, in which case
the leg might have to be amputated.
"Casey Martin has a window
here," his surgeon Don James said.
"The window gets smaller every
day."
Under cross-examination,
Finchem acknowledged that there
was no mention of walking in the
USGA Rules of Golf definition of
the game. Finchem also conceded
that professional golfers are allowed
to ride carts in so-called "Monday
qualifier" rounds, whereby they
qualify to play in a specific open
tournament.
The verdict rests in the hands of
magistrate Thomas Coffin who is ex
pected to rule today on the matter.

Coffin, has no background in golf.
Martin graduated from Stanford in
1995 after spending four year as a
member of Stanford's golf team.
During his time on The Farm, Martin
walked the course when he felt able,
but also was allowed to ride a cart
when necessary. There are no
NCAA restrictions similar to the one
put forth by the P( i A regarding carts.
Martin recently won the Lake
land Classic, a Nike Tour event in

which he and all of the other com
petitors were allowed to use a cart.
He also ranks highest in all
around Nike Tour performance sta
tistics. Martin has said that even if he
loses the case, he will attempt to
continue his golf career by trying to
walk PC. A courses.
