# Hoopsters need big confidence boost

### Ben Hur Senior staff writer 
Three weeks ago. the Stanford's men's basket
ball team believed it was one of the four or five
best teams in the land. Today, the squad doesn't
seem to think it deserves its No. 13 ranking.
"Maybe we're a little overrated right now," ju
nior center Tim Young said.
After starting the season IK-0 and exuding an
air of invincibility, the Card has suddenly started
to look very beatable. Saturday's loss to Con
necticut was Stanford's third in its last four games.
Stanford achieved its phenomenal start
through a combination of a disciplined offense, a
stilling defense and a belief that it should win
every game in which the team played.
The bottom line â€” Stanford played with con
fidence.
Things started to unravel in the second half of
Stanford's game against UCLA on Jan. 17. After
being shellacked and heckled into the locker
room at halftime, the Bruins gave Stanford a run
for its money, vaporizing an IK-point deficit be
fore eventually losing to the deeper ( ard.
Everybody celebrated the win at Maples, and
the Sixth Man Club went nuts all over national
television. The Stanford faithful dreamed of a
Final Four.
But a dent had emerged in the ('ardinal armor.
Actually, a few dents.
First, teams started to realize the difficulty
Stanford has with defending a quick opponent,
both on the perimeter and inside. The Card had
no answer for Bruin swingman Toby Bailey. Nor
could it seem to get to the ball as quickly as big
men J.R. Henderson and Jelani McCoy did.
Second, the absence of a "go-to" guy. some
thing that Stanford had not needed much up to
that point, became evident. Who was going to
step up when the Card went through a dry spell?
Third, the Card demonstrated that it does go
cold from the perimeter. What was Stanford to do
if it couldn't knock down the trey?
None of this mattered on that joyous day when
Stanford beat UCLA, but things have changed.
Since that win, Stanford has not put together a
complete game. After playing ptxirly during a
road trip to Washington, the Card lost its highly
touted match with Arizona. Same problem: lots
of quick guys for Arizona, not enough quick guys
for Stanford. Wildcat senior Michael Dickerson
scored at will, regardless of who the Cardinal put
on him.
Following that contest, the troops seemed de
jected. With aspirations of the Pac-10 crown
dimmed. Stanford played one of its worst games
of the season against Arizona State at home.
Again, lack of quickness and no go-to guy hurt
Stanford down the stretch.

Stanford then squeaked by Cal before the
blowout loss on Saturday to IJConn. in which the
Cardinal looked one step behind for most of the
contest. Not enough quicks, not enough shooting.
Two of Stanford's big guns, juniors Kris \\ eems
and Pete Sauer. went ;i combined 2-for-15.
That brings us to the present. Tomorrow, the
Card will once again do battle with UCLA, the

team that proved to the nation both how good
Stanford can be (first half) and how vulnerable
the Cardinal sometimes is (second half).
The lack of quickness, the shooting slump
these are legitimate concerns that the team must
address. Hut vou know what the real difference is
