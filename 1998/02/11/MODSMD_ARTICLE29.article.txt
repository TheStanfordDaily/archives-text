### Shannon Frank 
In a Hash of red. white and style,
the Stanford bowling team invaded
Las Vegas last weekend. At the
Brunswick Coca-Cola Open. Stan
ford brought a unique levity to the
traditionally tame sport. Compet
ing against many of the country's
best teams, the newlv-formed Car
dinal played some of its best bowl
ing to date.
At its second out-of-state tour
nament in history, Stanford
bowlers faced new. high-level com
petition.
"Vegas was a milestone for us.
We really had to step it up," said
sophomore Pete Tenney.
Fourteen members of the Stan
ford team attended the collegiate
tournament, hosted at the Orleans
Hotel.
In Stanford's first game of the
tournament, sophomore Ward
Bullard triumphed over Arizona,
narrowly edging out his opponent.
182-IKI. Despite such an impres
sive start, the Cardinal lost its next
39 games.
"Every other match we got ab

solutely slaughtered." Bullard said.
Bullard attributes these losses to
the high level of competition. Stan
ford was up against the likes of Sag
inaw Valley State, Nebraska and
College of New Jersey. "These are
bowling powerhouses," Bullard
said.
One of Stanford's stars in the
tournament was freshman Delia
Chiu, the team's only female mem
ber. She excelled in her first com
petition. exceeding last year's
record set by Stanford Tree Matt
Merrill.
"I almost broke the record for
lowest score. That was pretty excit
ing," Chiu said.
Another impressive perfor
mance was given by red-shirt fresh
man Matt Bunnell, who played a
strong match despite his loss.
Bunnell is "a crowd favorite,"
Bullard said.
The Cardinal encountered a mix
of responses to what Tenney char
acterized as its "unique spirit."
"Some people had a different
outlook on our performance-ori
ented ability," Tenney said.
Tournament official Don

McÃŸrain was apparently dissatis
fied with the Cardinal demeanor.
Such contested behavior includ
ed red-shirt freshman Paul Baran
donning Mardi (iras apparel, re
plete with sombrero, which result
ed in a citation for uniform viola
tion. Dressed in a three-piece suit.
Tennev encountered difficulty
when his pants fell down, causing a
reprimand from officials. He attrib
uted this unfortunate occurrence to
"first frame jitters."
Officials also looked with disfa
vor on Stanford's alteration of the
scoreboard to display team mem
bers' nicknames. These nicknames
included "Buttsizer," "Ciua
camole," "Ointment" and "Grand
master P."
Others had more positive im
pressions of the Card. San Jose
State coach Lindsey Wong appar
ently found Stanford to be pure
entertainment out on the lanes.
Chiu said that she felt no animosity
from other teams. Rather, most
teams appreciated the humor and
excitement Stanford brought to the
competition.
"It's a joke, and a lot of them got

it." Chiu said.
Noticeably absent from I as
Vegas was the Stanford Band,
which has attended past tourna
ments. It obviously left .1 strong im
pression. judging by the numerous
inquiries of other teams as to the
Band's whereabouts. Stanford es
pecially felt the loss of support pro
vided by the band.
Stanford's participation 111 the
two-day competition was cut short
when, after receiving numerous
threats from tournament officials,
the team decided to withdraw from
the Sunday Baker's matches
Members of other teams in
quired as to whether the Cardinal
was disqualified, but the Stanford
team assured them that this was
merely a rumor.
At the time of its withdrawal.
Stanford held a score of 4.N00. trail
ing first-place University of Indi
ana by 4.0(H) points, and rival I'm
versity of Oregon by S4*> points.
"We left Las Vegas a little dis
appointed with our bow ling, but we
knew that we had written another
chapter in the annuals ot Stanford
howling history," Milliard said.
