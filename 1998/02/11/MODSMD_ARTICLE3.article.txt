## 
### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
In an effort to revamp its image
as a haven for future management
consultants and investment
bankers, the Career Planning and
Placement Center is holding its first
annual liberal Arts and Career In
ternship Fair this week.
The fair, which will take place in
I residder Union from noon to 4
p.m. tomorrow and Friday, is de
signed to bring in employers wlu
are looking specifically for non
technical majors. The fair will be
split into two different categories,
with tomorrow's fair focusing on
public service employment oppor
tunities and Friday's highlighting
employers looking for students in
terested in business and communi
cation. The fair will have opportuni
ties for undergraduate and graduate
students and will include those hir
ing for permanent positions and
summer internships.
"One of the issues that we face
here at the CPPC ... is that there is

a perception that we're not doing
enough for liberal arts majors." said
CPPC I Mrector Bob Thirsk.
According to Thirsk, previous
student focus groups have made it
clear that the center specifically
needs to hold events for liberal arts
students, who often face more diffi
cult Hiring procedures than students
in technical fields.
I hirsk emphasized that the cen
ter has many resources and oppor
tunities or liberal arts students, in
cluding helping them to make con
tacts. present themselves to compa
nies and write effective cover let
ters.
I towever. hiring in these fields is
different than in technical fields.
Students must be more assertive
and proactive with ;hcir application
process, since non technical busi
nesses don't recruit as heavily as
technical ones Ihirsk said. This
week's lair was designed to help stu
dents realize the center's options for
them and to facilitate job searches.
Although the career fair for pub
lic service has been held for approx

imately 10 years, the business and
communications side to the fair is
new. It was scheduled this quarter
to give students a head start on
looking for jobs after graduation
and on opportunities for the sum
mer.
A broad spectrum of groups will
be in attendance. While some tech
nical companies will be present at
the fair, they will be looking lor lib
eral arts majors for their marketing
divisions.
Some of those companies and or
ganizations which will be in atten
dance during tomorrow's public
service fair will be Big Brothers and
Big Sisters, the ( ity of San Jose En
vironmental Services. Multicultural
Alliance, Americorps and the U.S.
Departments of Commerce, State
and Transportation.
Friday's event will feature com
panies such as Charles Schwab and
Co., Nike. Pacific Bell, Smith Bar
ney and Trilogy. In all. more than 85
organizations have been confirmed
for tomorrow and more than 50
companies for Friday.
