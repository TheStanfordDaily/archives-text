# Trustees expand financial aid
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
The Hoard of I rustees voted
yesterday to appropriate an addi
tional $3.8 million to two expan
sions ol the financial aid program.
Under the new system, students
who receive outside scholarships
will no longer have to sign any of
that money over to Stanford. In ad
dition. the amount of home equity
that can he factored into the finan
cial aid calculations will be capped.
Under the current system, stu
dents receive only the first $S(K) ol
any outside scholarships to use for
reducing their self-help needs. This
is the difference between tuition
and what the University provides in
scholarships. Students must pay this
remainder themselves, usually
through loans or jobs.
For any amount of money above
the lirst $500 in outside scholar
ships. half goes to self-help needs
and the other half corr<
reduces the Universitv-given finan
cial aid package. If the self-help por
tion is reduced by these outside
scholarships to $3,500. all further

outside scholarships go entirely to
the University.
"The policy, as it stood, served as
a disincentive for students to go
alter outside awards." said Physics
Prof. Douglas Osheroff. a former
committee member on the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid.
Starting next year, students can
use all of the money they obtain
from outside scholarships to cut
down their loans and jobs, without
impacting their Stanford-provided
financial aid levels.
"Now students can reduce the
self-help portion of their tuition
down to zero." said Cynthia Rife,
director of student awards in the Fi
nancial Aids ()ffice.
"I would tell any undergraduate
student out there to sit down and
look for these scholarships because
now you'll really benefit." said En
gineering Prof. Margaret Bran
deau. head of the committee.
I he trustees also voted to cap
the amount of home equity that can
be used to calculate a student's fi
nancial aid package. I'hc amount of
equity factored in will he limited to
three times the family income. Pre
viously, the amount of equity that
could he used in reckoning financial
aid was unlimited.
"Situations like this happen often
in California," said James Montoya,
vice provost for student affairs. "A
family might be making $30,(HX), but
because of rising real estate values,
their home value rises to $3(X),(XX)."
The need for a change in the eq
uity policy was brought to the atten
tion of the committee by parent re
sponses to a survey sent out this fall.
Survey responses indicated that,
while most families making under
$40,(XX)were happy with their finan
cial aid packages, those in slightly
higher income brackets were dissat
isfied.
"This policy will primarily impact
families with middle-class incomes,"
Rife said.
"This puts our expectations for fi
nancial aid more in line with what
parents feel they can pay," Montoya
added.
Currently, 70 percent of Stanford
undergraduates receive some form
of financial aid. including $-W mil
lion in need-based scholarships.
Funds for the new programs —
$2 million for the outside scholar
ship change and $1.8 million for the
home equity cap — will come partly
from the President's fund and partly
from the general University fund.
"This money will be used for fi
nancial aid for the foreseeable fu
ture," said Robert Bass, chair of the
Board of Trustees. "It will go into
the base budget."
Representatives from the Finan
cial Aids Office, Bechtel Interna
tional Center, the Bursars Office
and the Office of the Dean of Re
search and Graduate Policy also met
yesterday afternoon to discuss the
impact of the Asian financial crisis
on the ability of international Stan
ford students to fund their educa
tion.
