The Hoard of I rustees voted
yesterday to appropriate an addi
tional $3.8 million to two expan
sions ol the financial aid program.
Under the new system, students
who receive outside scholarships
will no longer have to sign any of
that money over to Stanford. In ad
dition. the amount of home equity
that can he factored into the finan
cial aid calculations will be capped.
Under the current system, stu
dents receive only the first $S(K) ol
any outside scholarships to use for
reducing their self-help needs. This
is the difference between tuition
and what the University provides in
scholarships. Students must pay this
remainder themselves, usually
through loans or jobs.
For any amount of money above
the lirst $500 in outside scholar
ships. half goes to self-help needs
and the other half corr<
reduces the Universitv-given finan
cial aid package. If the self-help por
tion is reduced by these outside
scholarships to $3,500. all further

outside scholarships go entirely to
the University.
"The policy, as it stood, served as
a disincentive for students to go
alter outside awards." said Physics
Prof. Douglas Osheroff. a former
committee member on the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid.
Starting next year, students can
use all of the money they obtain
from outside scholarships to cut
down their loans and jobs, without
impacting their Stanford-provided
financial aid levels.
"Now students can reduce the
self-help portion of their tuition
down to zero." said Cynthia Rife,
director of student awards in the Fi
nancial Aids ()ffice.
"I would tell any undergraduate
student out there to sit down and
look for these scholarships because
now you'll really benefit." said En
gineering Prof. Margaret Bran
deau. head of the committee.
I he trustees also voted to cap
the amount of home equity that can
be used to calculate a student's fi
