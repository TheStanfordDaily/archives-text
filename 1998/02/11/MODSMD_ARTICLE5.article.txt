The Board of Trustees approved yesterday the smallest percentage in
crease in tuition in three decades. Next year's bill will rise 3.5 percent,
which is below last year's average family income growth of 4 percent na
tionwide.
"We are obviously concerned about affordability [of Stanford] by fam
ilies," said Robert Bass, chair of the board.
As a result of the increase, the total price of tuition, room and board
next year will be $29,879. Undergraduate tuition will increase by 3.8 per
cent. or $810, to $22,110. Room and board fees will rise 2.8 percent, or
$212, to $7,769.
"Substantial reductions in administrative costs over the past six years
have allowed us to restrain fees, despite pressures on the University's
budget," Bass said.
Although the percentage increase in tuition, room and board is above
the 2 percent nationwide inflation rate, it is commensurate with the 4 per
cent local rate of inflation.
"We buy goods and services and hire people in this market, so we need
to be cognizant of trying to stay competitive in this regard." said Tim
Warner, vice provost for budget and auxiliaries management.
Bass emphasized that tuition only covers 60 percent of the cost of a
Stanford education. " The way Stanford educates is very expensive — we
have done that deliberately, Bass said, citing such new programs as fresh
man seminars.
Bass also referred to Stanford's
investment in the SUNet system to
keep e-mail free for students as an
example of the additional costs of
providing a Stanford education.
Stanford's tuition compares fa
vorably with its peers. According to
a Cambridge Associates study,
Stanford charges less than 13 of 18
highly selective universities belong
ing to the Consortium on Financing
Higher Education. The increase in
tuition rates for the graduate and
professional schools were similar to
those for undergraduate tuition.
