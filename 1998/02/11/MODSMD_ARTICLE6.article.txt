I he Faculty Senate gave the undergraduate inter
disciplinary Humanities Special Programs another five
years of lite. The senate made several suggestions for
the programs' improvement at its Thursday meeting,
including a special track for premedical students.
The interdisciplinary program currently allows stu
dents the unique opportunity to major in virtually anv
field and still write an honors thesis in the humanities.
The program has been a strong presence on campus

since its inception in 1447.
Some new twists for the program were proposed <i
the senate's meeting, including rethinking the name o
its major concentration and rewording section ir
Stanford Bulletin, according to Program C oordinatoi
Monica Moore.
Most students taking courses in the program spe
cialize in a concentration currently entitled Modern
Thought and Literature —often confused with the de
gree program of the same name. The senate suggested
that the name of the concentration
he re-evaluated, Moore said.
The proposed track for premed
ical students would allow students
to fulfill their requirements while
writing an honors thesis in a hu
manities area of choice.
The suggestion to create this
special track "came as a complete
surprise to us," Moore said. " The
Humanities Special Programs in
cluded a premedical track 10 or 15
years ago."
She pointed out that premedical
students can currently do an honors
thesis in the humanities while still
fulfilling their premedical require
ments, which do not constitute a
major.
English Prof. John Lindenberg
said a special track "would simply
be formalized." Lindenberg has ad
vised many of the program's stu
dents over the years, including

some premedical students.
"I've had several students
who've done well and went on to
medical school," he said.
These new suggestions will be
reviewed in three years, according
to Moore. The reapproval of de
gree granting authority was part of
a five-year review that every pro
gram must undergo.
The program currently has 25
seniors, but several underclass stu
dents have signed up this year.
Many students take the introducto
ry sequence and go on to write an
honors thesis, and at least hall of
these students are typically science
majors, according to Moore.
"We have wonderful students
and [this program] offers them in
tellectual freedom in an interdisci
plinary way... with intercourse be
tween different kinds of thought,"
said Drama Prof. Alice Rayner,
who has been the program chair for
just under year. "1 had a lot of con
fidence in our students and their
enthusiasm."
