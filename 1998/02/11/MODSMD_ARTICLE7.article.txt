### Brad Kane Contributing writer 
Phillip Evans is more than a chef
and manager at Lagunita dining
hall — he is a professional ice sculp
tor.
Residents who attended dinner
at Lagunita Court on Jan. 29 may
have seen one of Evans' latest
works, an ice-carved sculpture of a
Chinese dragon. The dragon is the
second sculpture that Evans has
made at Lagunita this year, but it is
only the latest in a career-long se
ries of intricate frozen creations.
Evans, a native of Menlo Park,
began his sculpting career 25 years
ago while taking classes at a San
Francisco culinary school. After
seeing a professional chef carve
sculptures out of ice. Evans thought
he might be able to do it and decid
ed to give sculpting a try.
"Maybe one out of 2(X) guys can
really get the hang of it." said
Evans, also an avid gardener. "1 \s.is
always really gifted with my hands."
Hours of practice led Evans to
develop impressive sculpting skills,
but he was unable to display his tal
ent until one Sundav brunch at thi
St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco.
"I was moving the sous-chefs ice
carving, and I broke it." Evans said.
"I had to go up to the gu\ and tell
him ... He said. 'You do it next
time.' Most guys wouldn't have
known what to say. but I was wait
ing for a break like that."
Evans began carving ice sculp
tures every Sunday and was s»x>n
well-known for his artistic abilities.
