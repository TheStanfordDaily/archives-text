## Lagunita chef moonlights as sculptor 
### Brad Kane Contributing writer 
Phillip Evans is more than a chef
and manager at Lagunita dining
hall — he is a professional ice sculp
tor.
Residents who attended dinner
at Lagunita Court on Jan. 29 may
have seen one of Evans' latest
works, an ice-carved sculpture of a
Chinese dragon. The dragon is the
second sculpture that Evans has
made at Lagunita this year, but it is
only the latest in a career-long se
ries of intricate frozen creations.
Evans, a native of Menlo Park,
began his sculpting career 25 years
ago while taking classes at a San
Francisco culinary school. After
seeing a professional chef carve
sculptures out of ice. Evans thought
he might be able to do it and decid
ed to give sculpting a try.
"Maybe one out of 2(X) guys can
really get the hang of it." said
Evans, also an avid gardener. "1 \s.is
always really gifted with my hands."
Hours of practice led Evans to
develop impressive sculpting skills,
but he was unable to display his tal
ent until one Sundav brunch at thi
St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco.
"I was moving the sous-chefs ice
carving, and I broke it." Evans said.
"I had to go up to the gu\ and tell
him ... He said. 'You do it next
time.' Most guys wouldn't have
known what to say. but I was wait
ing for a break like that."
Evans began carving ice sculp
tures every Sunday and was s»x>n
well-known for his artistic abilities.

Hotel chain. Evans worked in San
Francisco, Cincinnati and Boston,
developing his skills as a chef and
when the occasion called for it, carv
ing ice sculptures.
A standard ice sculpture, Evans
said, is carved from a single block of
ice, 5 feet by 22 inches bv 11 inches.
Evans has created over I.(HX) of
these one-block sculptures, but he is
far more proud of his elaborate
works.
The largest of these was a l X)-
block sculpture of an old steam train
that was displayed outside of the
Westin Hotel in Boston, complete
with dry ice to provide the illusion
of smoke rising from the smoke
stack.
"1 worked for about two weeks
on that one," Evans said. "The
smokestack was four blocks high ...
and 1 made the wheels entirely in

side the freezer."
Evans earved another notable
sculpture for a Republican Party
banquet in Cincinnati attended by
then President Ronald Reagan.
Apropos of the event, the sculpture
was a large elephant rearing up on its
hind legs.
But unlike most of Evans' sculp
tures, his most widely viewed works
didn't melt away at the end of the
night. They were captured on the big
screen in Bill Norton's "More
American Graffiti."
"I made four cherubs for a New
Year's Eve scene," Evans said. "It's
my claim to fame."
Evans has now refined his skill
such that he can produce a one
block ice sculpture in about an hour.
Wearing protective gloves, boots
and knee pads, Evans attacks the
fresh blocks of ice with the standard
tools of his trade — a set of chisels
and a chainsaw.
"You really have to feel good be
fore you start." Evans said. "It's re

ally a little athletic event."
Evans was eventually drawn
back to the area where he grew up,
leading him into his current job with
Stanford Dining Services.
"I wanted to come back to my
roots," he said. "I missed the weatii
er and I missed my garden."
Ice sculpting was not Evans' fore
most reason for coming to work at
Stanford. It was his love for cooking,
a love which he continues to explore
daily at the Lagunita dining hall.
"I always wanted to work [at
Stanford]," Evans said. "1 heard it
was a really stable environment. . I
almost wanted to keep [ice sculpt
ing] a secret."
The secret didn't last long. Since
coming to Stanford, Evans has de
signed sculptures for presidential
dinners, holiday banquets and spe
cial dinners at Lagunita Court. Last
week's two-block dragon sculpture
was a follow-up to the sleigh-and
reindeer that Evans created for the
Lagunita holiday dinner.
