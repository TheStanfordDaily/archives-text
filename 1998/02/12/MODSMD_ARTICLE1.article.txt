Outside Old Union Clubhouse yesterday afternoon, there were lots of
cookies and tea hut not much small talk. Stanford students and administra
tors had gathered to discuss community issues.
Speaking to an audience of nearly 4<) people, sophomore Kumar
Narayanan, the independent organizer for the event, encouraged more stu
dent and stall discussions. "What I'd really like to see on campus is a dia
logue. Narayanan said. "We'd like to ... see what [the administration]
wants to see happen and [students] want to see happen come closer togeth
er."
Many student group representatives came forward to speak out on the
issues concerning them most.
Matt Spence, ASSU deputy senate chair, spoke enthusiastically about
the upcoming ASSU dorm outreach dinners. Describing the program,
Spence said, "It's really an effort to bring administrators and the ASSU to
students, rather than forcing them to come to us."
According to Spence, the Alliance to Control Tuition is also a main item
on the ASSU agenda. The ASSU is creating an exploratory commission to
make the tuition-raising process more transparent and to recommend re
forms to make it better.
This initiative "doesn't look popular now, because everyone wants inv
mediate results," Spence said regretfully. "Hut to take action, we need to
start planning now."
Taking action was also a theme of senior Lisa Connor. She praised cur
rent efforts to make the campus more handicapped accessible, but she said
more needed to be done.
"We feel our next step, which we want you to help us with, is education."
Connor said.
Specifically, Connor pointed to increasing student awareness about dis
ability access. Cookies and Tea was originally scheduled to be in the Old
Union Clubhouse, a building that is not handicap accessible.
Jill Shenker, coordinator of Students for Environmental Action at Stan
ford and a member of the Coalition of Human Rights and the Coalition for
Labor, Dignity and Justice, highlighted the rights of workers.
