# Forum explores campus issues
## 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
Outside Old Union Clubhouse yesterday afternoon, there were lots of
cookies and tea hut not much small talk. Stanford students and administra
tors had gathered to discuss community issues.
Speaking to an audience of nearly 4<) people, sophomore Kumar
Narayanan, the independent organizer for the event, encouraged more stu
dent and stall discussions. "What I'd really like to see on campus is a dia
logue. Narayanan said. "We'd like to ... see what [the administration]
wants to see happen and [students] want to see happen come closer togeth
er."
Many student group representatives came forward to speak out on the
issues concerning them most.
Matt Spence, ASSU deputy senate chair, spoke enthusiastically about
the upcoming ASSU dorm outreach dinners. Describing the program,
Spence said, "It's really an effort to bring administrators and the ASSU to
students, rather than forcing them to come to us."
According to Spence, the Alliance to Control Tuition is also a main item
on the ASSU agenda. The ASSU is creating an exploratory commission to
make the tuition-raising process more transparent and to recommend re
forms to make it better.
This initiative "doesn't look popular now, because everyone wants inv
mediate results," Spence said regretfully. "Hut to take action, we need to
start planning now."
Taking action was also a theme of senior Lisa Connor. She praised cur
rent efforts to make the campus more handicapped accessible, but she said
more needed to be done.
"We feel our next step, which we want you to help us with, is education."
Connor said.
Specifically, Connor pointed to increasing student awareness about dis
ability access. Cookies and Tea was originally scheduled to be in the Old
Union Clubhouse, a building that is not handicap accessible.
Jill Shenker, coordinator of Students for Environmental Action at Stan
ford and a member of the Coalition of Human Rights and the Coalition for
Labor, Dignity and Justice, highlighted the rights of workers.

Jesse Adams, a graduate student and resident assistant in
Crothers Memorial, spoke about overcrowded graduate housing
at yesterday's Cookies and Tea.
"Stanford should support the ef
forts of the workers as opposed to
fighting against the labor unions,"
Shenker said.
Moreover, she spoke against Nike
sponsorship of Stanford teams and
Stanford investment inTexaco,
Freeport Macmoran and Unocal.
Shenker proposed the University
look more closely at an alternative
endowment fund proposal and hire
some socially responsible investment
brokers.
"While I appreciate the vast op
portunities available to me at Stan
ford, I'd rather not have them if
they're available through the ex
ploitation of others," Shenker said.
Haas Center employee Kelly
Naylor called for incorporating hon
ors theses into students' curriculum.
"We need to be thinking more holis
tically about integrating public ser
vice into the undergraduate experi
ence," Naylor said.
Aly Remtulla, a senior represent
ing the Committee to Tenure Karen
Sawislak, advocated changing the
tenure process.
"Stanford is often an unfriendly
climate for women and minority fac

ulty ... and is often unsupportive of
innovative scholarship," Remtulla
said. "We need to look at what kind
of emphasis the tenure process is pay
ing toward the needs of undergradu
ate students."
Jesse Adams, a graduate student
living in Crothers Memorial Hall,
added graduate students to those
represented at the event. He focused
on overcrowded housing.
"It's easy when you're not living in
the dorm to say, 'Oh, let's just try and
squish some more people in,' "
Adams said.
He proposed building housing
with open corridors and single rooms
that could be rented out to local resi
dents if necessary.
"My vision is that all the housing
will look like Rains and Lyman and
not get worse," Adams said.
Speaking for reforming the De
partment of African and Afro-
American Studies, senior Ryan
Michelle Bathe said she was frustrat
ed by lack of administrative attention
to student complaints.
"I'm not so concerned about the
lack of resources. We've learned to
deal with that," Bathe said. "What
I'm concerned about is the lack of
commitment the University has
given to the African American Stud
ies programs."

In particular, she called for adding
more black faculty members and en
couraged administrators to listen to
their complaints more seriously.
"Listen to us and don't shut us
down," Bathe said. "Trust me: we're
not angry black students yet."
Responding to complaints about
students not being heard. Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya stated he will be chairing a
task force looking at the quality of
service to students.
"I think it'll lead to some very im
portant discussions on how you wish
to be treated and how you perceive to
be treated by the University," Mon
toya said.
ASSU President Emily Andrus
emphasized students could also use
the ASSU to make their voices
heard.
"I want to encourage you to con
tinue to speak out, seek out the ad
visers ... and encourage you to come
to the ASSU meetings," Andrus said.
"We need to know what you need."
Lisa Liao. a senior and chair of the
ASSU Nominations Commission,
promoted students joining Universi
ty committees.
"I see this active student popula
tion, but I don't see applications from
you guys," Liao said. "Apply, apply,
apply for them."
