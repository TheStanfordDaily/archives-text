# Attorney General pushes for Babbitt investigation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AM)
Attorney General Janet Reno
asked for an independent prosecu
tor yesterday to investigate whether
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
misled Congress in connection with
an Indian casino controversy.
II a special court complies with
Reno's request, it would be the lirst
such prosecutor to be named in
connection with the wide-ranging
inquiries in Congress over cam
paign fund raising and political
influence during the 1996 election.
Republicans say contributions to
the Democrats may have played a
role in Babbitt's decision in 1995 to
reject a proposal from a group of
Wisconsin Indians for a casino.
Rival Indians who later contributed
money to the Democratic Partv
opposed the casino — as did the
local community.
But Reno made clear in her

request that the special prosecutor
should limit the investigation to
Babbitt's testimony on the casino
issue, and not delve into broader
campaign finance matters.
Kep. Dan Burton. Kind , chair
man of the House committee inves
tigating campaign finance abuses,
said he regretted that Reno
"focused her opinion so heavily on
the perjury charge" although "she
has left the door partially open to a
broader investigation of the decison
itself."
Babbitt said he was disappointed
with the decision.
"II it's true that only an indepen
dent counsel can resolve a matter
like this ... then I think the list of
hidden exists one has to pay for pub
lic service has just grown a little
longer." Babbitt said in a statement.
President Clinton expressed con
fidence that Babbitt would be

cleared.
"I have known Bruce Babbitt for
many years. He is a man of the
highest integrity and dedicated pub
lic servant. I am convinced that
when this matter is concluded he
will be vindicated." said Clinton. "I
look forward to his continuing ser
vice to the American people."
But Reno said in her request
that there were "reasonable
grounds" for further investigation
by an outside prosecutor on
whether Babbitt may have been
untruthful to a Senate committee
last October in connection with the
casino decision.
She said "there is specific and
credible evidence indicating that
Secretary Babbitt may have testi
fied falsely" as to what he said
about alleged White House influ
ence during a 1995 meeting with a
pro-casino lobbyist.
