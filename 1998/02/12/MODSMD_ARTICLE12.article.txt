## Editorial Revising financial aid 
### 
Trustees take action to
help more students meet
high costs of education

A STANFORD EDUCATION
is remarkable, but it is far from
cheap. Not surprisingly, we
strongly support reforms that will
make our years here more affordable.
On Tuesday, the Board of Trustees
voted to make two notable changes to
the University's financial aid program.
Its decisions will alter the way outside
scholarships and home equity affect
financial aid packages.
We support the board's substantial
steps toward helping everyone pay for
a Stanford education. Their revisions
will be particularly helpful for students
from middle-class families.
Currently, a student can only use the
first $500 of outside scholarships to
reduce his or her work-study obliga
tions and loans. Above this cap, half of
the scholarship amount is subtracted
from the student's Stanford-given
financial aid package. Once the work
study and loans — "self-help" needs —
drop to $3,500. all further outside
awards lower the University's support.
I*he new policy will allow students
to shrink or eliminate their self-help
obligations with less sacrifice.
Once this change is in place, Stan
ford students will finally be able to
reap the full benefits of outside schol
arships. We consequently view the
board's approach as a constructive
realignment of incentives.
After all. some students chose not

to apply for outside scholarships if they
perceived that such scholarships would
have few benefits for their financial
standing. Considering Stanford's abili
ty to attract high achievers, the Uni
versity's current approach essentially
discourages those who could earn out
side awards from competing for them.
Moreover, this disincentive with
respect to scholarships is largest for
those who actually receive financial
aid from the University. Consequently,
the board's action will improve the
present system in terms of equity as
well as efficiency.
The second praiseworthy change
revises the way home equity is consid
ered in financial aid calculations.
In the past, the entire amount of
home equity entered the calculation.
TTiis week's announcement was a
laudable recognition of the fact that
family incomes sometimes do not rise
in proportion with real estate values.
By deciding to cap home equity at
three times annual household income,
the board has chosen a wise middle
ground between ignoring home equity
entirely and assessing it at full value.
The two improvements in financial
aid — funded by an additional $3.8
million — should have a substantial
impact. Indeed, about 900 students
already receive outside scholarships,
and we expect this number to climb.
Roughly one-third of the current
financial aid recipients will benefit
from the change in home equity valua
tion.
Will this make Stanford a cheap
place to go to school? Hardly.
But we appreciate any help we can
get.
