Sexual assault not such
a clear-cut issue
Sexual assault is NEVER a simple
issue.
We are greatly disturbed by Monday's
Daily artiele regarding the recent alleged
sexual assault on campus. By stating that
the "incident ... never occurred," The
Daily establishes sexual assault as a sim
plistic, clear-cut issue with no gray area
between "rape" and "no incident."
We are also saddened and angered by
the conversations of other students who
interpret the event as a lie.
We ask our fellow students and Daily
writers to think about the issue before
jumping to conclusions and to recognize
the complexities involved.
Have you read the articles? Read them
again. There are NO FACTS. For privacy
reasons, the administration has decided
against disclosing the details of the case.
This means that neither we, nor you, nor
The Daily know what really happened.
And if none of us knows what happened,
we shouldn't assume that we can guess.
There are many possible scenarios. What
ever the truth is, we are sure that it is
more complicated than what the papers
report or what the police have disclosed.
Sexual assault covers a wide range of
situations, and the definition of rape is
rarely clear, even to the woman involved.
If you said "yes" at one point, is it rape?
If you didn't resist, is it rape? The
assailants are usually not strangers, but

ARE our acquaintances, friends, broth
ers and lovers.
Every woman must draw her own line
as to what is acceptable and what is a vio
lation. Unfortunately, that line often isn't
clear and does not always remain con
stant.
That line also does not always corre
spond to the legal definition of rape. The
woman in question is an intelligent stu
dent like the rest of us. Let's remember
that she had reasons for her actions and
her decisions, reasons to which we are not
privy and which we cannot judge.
Whatever the situation, SOME
THING occurred which affected this
woman. The most important thing now is
for the rest of us to honor her privacy,
respect her decisions and not trivialize
the trauma that this woman may be expe
riencing.
Finally, please remember that while
this case may have been legally resolved,
the larger problem of sexual assault at
Stanford remains unresolved. Please do
not interpret this one woman's situation
to mean that sexual assault and rape do
not occur or occur only rarely at Stan
ford. Sexual assault is a pervasive and
underreported problem on the Stanford
campus, and it will remain so until we all
consciously work to prevent rape in any
of its varied degrees.

Unjust labor practices
call for more responsible
investment by Stanford
This Friday, NIKE, Inc. joins other
corporations at the Liberal Arts and
Career Internship Fair.
The Ad Hoc Committee on Nike (stu
dents, faculty, staff, alums) will leaflet
the NIKE booth, encouraging Stanford
students to seek employment elsewhere.
Why?
NIKE makes roughly 40 percent of its
shoes in Indonesia.
It does so because the Suharto regime,
the military dictatorship responsible for
the genocide in East Timor, insures a
docile labor force and a good climate
(with requisite bribes to the Suharto
family) for profit making.twenty-two
years ago Indonesia — whose govern
ment was (and is) armed and supported
by the United States — invaded the small
island of East Timor.
Some 25(),(KM) East Timorese (roughly
a third of the island's population) have
died; Indonesia still occupies the island.
Moreover, the United States still sup
ports Indonesia.
Shift to the Stanford Athletics
Department, which recently negotiated a
contract with NIKE, Inc.. worth about $1
million a year in money and equipment.
In exchange, Stanford athletes advertise
the "swoosh" wherever they play.
NIKE's shameful labor practices in
the Third World have been well docu

mented, reason enough for Stanford to
terminate all dealings with the firm. Hut
NIKE's support of the Suharto regime,
and Stanford's complicity in it, is an out
rage.
Along with other campus groups, we
believe that Stanford should implement
an effective program of socially responsi
ble investment. President Casper claims
that to do so would constitute "the Uni
versity getting involved in politics."
That's nonsense, as if endorsing firms
like NIKE wasn't a political act — ask an
East Timorese who has lost her family,
or an Indonesian union leader dying in
jail or the students whose efforts to open
a dialogue have been crushed by the
Indonesian military.
.loin us at the job fair and tell the
NIKE recruiters what you think of their
"non-political" work on behalf of NIKE
profits, garnered by exploitation and
paid for in human lives. And join us in
persuading the University to invest
responsibly, or at least admit to the Stan
ford community what its values really
are.
