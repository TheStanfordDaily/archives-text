# Campus Viewpoint: Stewart Burns
## Rewriting the history of race 
### 
OVER 100 Stan
ford students
have embarked
on a journey that could
have powerful effects
that ripple into the 21st
century.
Ten multiracial dia-

logue groups are meeting in freshman,
four-class and upper-class residences
around campus. Participants are commit
ted to drawing on their own experiences
with race and racial issues during a quar
ter-long exploration of racial attitudes and
relations.
Led by trained facilitators, the dia
logue groups meet weekly for an hour in
a comfortable, safe setting. Some are
held in resident fellow living rooms with
the resident fellow participating. This
innovative venture in interracial commu
nication and bonding is the core of the
University-wide Stanford Dialogue on
Race — a combined effort of students,
staff and faculty.
Why are these interracial dialogues
important? What difference can they
make? What is the connection between
talking about race and actually changing
race relations?
Racism is a unique social problem
because it is fundamentally a function of
distortions of reality: misinformation.

myth, stereotype, exaggeration and simple
untruths.
Of course, racism is as much institu
tional as attitudinal, intertwined with
poverty and other social ills that must be
attacked in a concerted fashion. Hut
racism and the concept of "race" are hoth
social constructions, even if they are
embedded in the social fabric.
We need to unmask and confront the
nefarious fictions of race in order to make
headway toward their elimination. Only
such clear-eyed awareness can empower
us to combat institutional racism and to
break its alliance with class oppression
and other social injustices.
When Johnnetta Cole, former presi
dent of Spelman College, spoke here on
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday, she
urged students to become activists for
social justice.
What more meaningful way to prepare
for activism than to learn to tell the truth
about race and racism in safe settings
where students of different races and eth
nicities relate to each other as persons, not
as labels, stereotypes, or objects of fear;
where honesty and intimacy are grounded
in trust and respect?
Stanford students who engage in this
dialogue, like others who went to Missis
sippi in the l%()s to work for voting rights,
or who fought apartheid in South Africa

and homelessness in America, have an
opportunity to make history.
What will these students do with the
special knowledge that they gain? Will
they share what they have learned with
roommates and friends, parents and sib
lings? Will they start other dialogue
groups at Stanford, in their law, medical,
and graduate schools, in their workplaces
and neighborhoods? Will they apply this
knowledge as a critical element of the
leadership training that Stanford provides
them? Will they feel a responsibility to
assert enlightened moral leadership in
race relations as they become leaders in
government, education and the economy?
Will they use their knowledge of racism to
challenge it in every aspect of their lives?
As King showed a generation ago, we
cannot defeat racism unless we bring it to
light. As educated citizens, it is our job to
train our moral searchlights to detect
racial untruths and ignorance. As the new
century dawns and as our nation becomes
ever more racially diverse, our reckoning
with racism might enable lis to turn the
"color line" of the past century into an
expanding circle of trust and understand
ing goodwill.
