# Bordering on slander
## T.J. Babbitt Ailing Review sings 'Song of Myself 
### 
THERE'S SOMETHING pnthctic
about the current state of The Stan
ford Review. The already abysmal
paper just gets worse with every new issue.
Let me be clear about the cause of the
decline. It's certainly not the poor writing,
the frequent spelling errors or illegible
graphics. It's not even the occasionally
offensive editorial content. Those are time
less features of The Review, and they're
actually kind of endearing. 1 look for those
quirks first when I read a new issue — it's
like picking up The Daily and turning
straight to the crossword puzzle.
The right-wing Review has a much more
fatal problem than mere sloppiness and lack
of professionalism: it has run out of things to
say.
Maybe it's because Stanford has become
one of the most blandly conservative places
on this planet. A left-leaning humanities
department or two and the ethnic theme
dorms and cultural community centers
don't change this fact.
The Review makes a huge mistake by
limiting itself to Stanford issues. I his policy

made sense when The Review was created
in 1 1 >K7. when political correctness and mul
ticulturalism were nearing their high water
mark at Stanford, but now the paper strug
gles to find anything relevant to say. Usual
ly it fails and its columnists end up writing
about themselves and their personal obses
sions — and trying to find that elusive Stan
ford angle to tie it all together.
Let's take a quick tour of the Stanford
Review of 1995, starting with the worst the
paper has to offer — the columns of Alec
Rawls. Sometimes Rawls discusses the infe
riority of women and gays, but his ongoing
struggle against Stanford's communist infes
tation is his meta-narrative. Rawls misses
the minor fact that Stanford is basically a
private business organization.
I actually enjoy reading every new Rawls
effort because it's fun to play " Where's
Waldo?" with references to his father. Dad
may very well be "the dominant figure ...
among egalitarian liberals ... who asserts
the priority of liberty as his first principle of
justice." But any paper whose writers report
on the activities of their own family mem

bers has sunken to a new journalistic low.
Or maybe the low is when the only thing
you can write about is yourself.
Bruce Gibney's favorite topic, for exam
ple. is Bruee Gibney. His columns are all
Woody Allen-like variations on the theme
of himself and his own narcissism, strange
for a paper supposedly focused on conser
vative politics at Stanford.
From a paragraph of almost any (iibney
column, one learns that he doesn't like bor
ing people or mediocre, required classes.
But he does like money, sex. drinking and
acting arrogantly and disrespectfully
towards others.
At least (iibney is amusing. 'I he rest of
The Review writers have neither the enter
tainingly paranoid, hallucinogenic qualities
of Rawls's columns nor even the slightest
trace of Gibney's sense of humor. But they
do have an inexhaustible willingness to talk
about themselves.
Erie Jackson hopes that a discussion of
his thesis topic will entertain his readers.
And Matt Stone reports that "my friends do
sometimes say that I assume the worst in

people."
Review writers do occasionally score
points when they stop talking about them
selves and start concentrating on actual
issues.
They're right: ethnic theme dorms are a
school-sponsored form of segregation, and
it is depressing that the University props
them up while zealously attacking the fra
ternities. Most DR/GER classes are scan
dalously had. Hut these two points are not
enough to sustain a newspaper.
Things have gotten so bad at The Review
that I wish the right-wing alums who fund it
would step in with some quality control
measures. Then they could broaden the
paper's focus away from (iibney's drinking
habits.
But maybe the problem with The
Review is that the alumni who support it are
also obsessed with the minutiae of their own
Stanford experiences.
Former Review writers who graduate
into right-wing attack journalism have a
habit of returning to Stanford, as though
this university were some sort of archetype

for a nation caught in the throes of P( mul
ticulturalism. The founding editors of The
Review created a fuss on campus a couple
of years ago with "The Diversity Myth:
Multiculturalism' and the Politics of Intol
erance at Stanford." Hut they were writing
about a cultural moment which passed Stan
lord by nearly a decade ago. shortly after
they had graduated.
There's still hope for a future in which
the increasingly weak Review follows Sum
mit and Scene into obscurity. If The
Review's financiers are conservative true
believers, then they should put their faith in
free markets. All they have to do is with
draw their subsidies. Then The Review,
with no subscribers, no advertisers and a
vanishingly small number of readers, will
die a deserved death by the wonderfully
invisible hand of Adam Smith.

T.J Babbitt, a junior majoring in German
Studies, knows the difference between hbe,
and slander but hopes you don 't. He woulc
like to warn that anyone who has read thi.<
column aloud might get sued.
