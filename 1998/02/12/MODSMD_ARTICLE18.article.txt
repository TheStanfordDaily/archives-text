nal grapplers will have to continue
running on all cylinders in order to
come away with wins.
Cal Poly-SLO's strength lies in its
upper-weight classes, as five of its
wrestlers over 142 pounds have at
least 10 wins. This could cause a prob
lem for Stanford because top per
formers B.J. Sanchez, a junior, and
Scott ( hapman. a senior, will face C"al
Poly's second- and third-winningest
wrestlers, respectively. Stanford will
have to dominate in the lower
weights to keep it close.
"If we can pull an upset or two in
the upperweights and come through
in the lightweights, we can beat
them," said head coach Chris Horpel.
"It should be a real dogfight."
The match between Chapman
and Brian Bowles at 177 promises to
be a thriller, as Chapman has wres

tied exceptionally since his return
from an elbow injury early in the sea
son. Last Saturday, Bowles beat the
Stanford senior co-captain in the ti
nalsofthe All Cal Invitational.
"That match was cheese." said
freshman teammate kayvon Bina.
"If Chappy wasn't hurt, he would
have romped over that guy."
Having severely bruised his collar
bone in his semifinal victory. Chap
man was not at full strength in his
championship loss.
"If Chap feels healthy, it should be

an entirely different match this time
around." Horpel said.
Fresno State's strength is more
evenly distributed through the roster.
Stephen Ab;ts is ranked second in the
nation at 11K. and Dave Wheeler
took second place in the All ( al Invi
tational. Stanford sophomores Zach
Zimmerer and Tim Kendall will look
to avenge losses to the Bulldogs earli
er this year, and Sanchez will try to
take the lead in his 1-1 series with
Fresno State's Tim C 'ornish.
"If we wrestle well, we can beat

both teams. Horpel said. "Ihese
final duals sh( >uld provide gix k.l tough
competition."
L(K)ming on the horizon are the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships on Feb. 2X and March 1. The
top four finishers in each weight class
proceed to the NCAA tournament
three weeks later.
" I'm going to give even, one Sat ur
dav. Sunday and Monday off after
these duals. Then we'll hit it very hard
in preparation for the Pac-1(K." Hor
pel said.
