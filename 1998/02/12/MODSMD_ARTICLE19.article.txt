# Women to face Bruins
## Closest race in four years arrives at Maples tonight 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
For the first time in four years, the No. 6 Stanford
women's basketball team finds itself in the middle of a
tight conference race.
Entering tonight's 7:30 meeting with UCLA at
Maples Pavilion, Stanford is just one game up on the
Bruins and in need of a win to stay all by itself at the top
of the conference standings.
UCLA (14-6. 9-2 Pacific 10 Conference) is even
with the Cardinal in the win column, but defeats at
home by Arizona (Jan. 2) and Stanford (Jan. IS) place
the Bruins one loss back.

Meanwhile, the Cardinal (13-5,9-1) is on one of its
hottest streaks of the season. Stanford is currently on a
seven-game run and has won 10 of its last 11 contests.
A win would solidify the Card's position in the Pac-10,
but head coach Tara VanDerveer said she's more con
cerned with the bigger picture.
"We try to focus on the NCAAs," VanDerveer
said. "And just getting ready for the tournament."
One piece of good news VanDerveer wasn't ex
pecting is the return of junior forward Kristin Folkl to
tonight's lineup. Folkl. who missed last Friday's game
against California with two broken fingers, was listed
as possible for Saturday's game against I 'SC.
I lowever. doctors reviewed Folkl's status Tuesday
and cleared her for practice that day. So Folkl will be
back in uniform and likely will play unless she's in pain.
"We'll start out with our regular lineup, and she'll
come in when we need her," VanDerveer said. "And
it will all depend on how she feels, hut she's fine."
Even if Folkl doesn't play, her mere presence on

the bench and her team-leading IS.S points and 9.6 re
bounds make her a threat to the Bruins and could also
give the Card a morale boost.
"I think other people will pick up the slack, but I
think probably in the back of their mind it's confi
dence," VanDerveer said. "She's good. Even if she just
goes in and grabs some rebounds, she's better than
anyone else we could bring in."
Whether Folkl plays or not. Stanford will have to
come ready to plav if it hopes to handle the talented
IK LA squad. The Bruins have one of the better front
lines Stanford has faced, and the Card's 75-70 win at
Pauley Pavilion was its closest margin of victory all year.
"UCLA's a top-25 team." VanDerveer said.
"They're NCAA bound, and they've got a lot of
weapons. They play a lot of people, and they give you
a lot of different looks. I think its kind of a down year
for post players, but they have as much size and ability
as anyone."
Leading the way for the Bruin frontline is sophtv
more forward Maylana Martin. Martin is UCLA's
leading scorer and rebounder; her 19.3 points per
game are gotxl for second in the Pac-10. Martin led the
Bruins with 17 points and seven rebounds in the last
contest between these two teams.
Taking up some space in the lane with Martin is
sophomore Janae Hubbard. The 6-foot-4 center is
shooting a team-leading 55 percent from the field.
Against Stanford. Hubbard came out hot. scoring 10
points and grabbing two offensive rebounds in the first
five minutes.
