### Marcella Bernhard Senior staff writer 
Robert Walker, who co-founded
the Overseas Studies Program and
revamped undergraduate education
requirements in the late l l >s(>s. died
Feb. 3 of a heart attack. I le was 84.
Walker chaired the Political Sci
ence Department from 1958 to 1963.
was director of Overseas Studies
from to 1973 and also left his
mark on Stanford architecture and
faculty housing.
Walker, along with former Mod
ern Languages Prof. Fricdrich
Strothmann. began the overseas pro
gram in June 1958 with the inaugura
tion of the first campus outside of
Stuttgart. Germany. Sixty-three stu
dents — 33 men and 30 women

made up the first group at the Ger
man campus that fall.
When Walker stepped down
from his position as director of Over
seas Studies in l l )73. five other cam
puses in France.Spain, Italy, Aus
tria and Great Britain — had been
opened and over 50 percent of Stan
ford students studied abroad
"[Walker] genuinely cared about
students getting a broad perspective
i)n the world ... by being immersed
in it." said Carol Price, associate di
rector of ()verseas Studies.
Price was in the first group of
Stanford students to attend the Aus
trian program, founded in 1965.
"It created an additional, enrich
ing lens through which to understand
the world," Price said.
In addition, the program was

"very forward thinking" for the time
— housing at the overseas centers
was co-educational, with single-sex
floors. At the main campus, housing
remained strictly single-sex.
"Stanford owes a great debt to
Robert Walker." said current Over
seas Studies Director Russell
Berman. "Overseas Studies became
and remains a core piece of under
graduate education at Stanford."
Walker also played a large part in
drafting a revised undergraduate
curriculum in 1956. which was the
first major change in Stanford's re
quirements in 35 years. The General
Studies Program required that un
dergraduates take basic courses in a
wide range of subjects and a full year
of freshman English. However, the
program also allowed students

greater flexibili
ty in choosing
the classes taken
within their ma
jors and their
advisers.
At a confer
ence that year.
Walker ex
plained the

goals of the new program: "It should
challenge the best students. It should
provide intellectual excitement, and
it should capitalize early on the par
ticular interests which students de
velop."
Walker received his bachelors
and doctoral degrees in political sci
ence from the University of Chica


Walker
go. After completing his doctoral
thesis on urban planning, which
later became a widely-used text
book, Walker worked for the U.S.
Departments of Agriculture and
State. He was a professor at Kansas
State University before coming to
Stanford.
While serving on the University's
Committee on Land and Buildings
from to 1%4, Walker helped
develop Stanford Industrial Park
and three faculty housing develop
ments — Pine Hill I and II and
Frenchman's Hill. Walker also in
sisted that Stanford stick with its
characteristic peaked red-tile roofs
on all new buildings, rather than
adopting cheaper, flat roofs.
"He was engaged in half a dozen
activities at one time," according to
Kurt Steiner, a professor emeritus of
political science who served as asso

ciate chair of the department under
Walker.
Steiner remembered Walker as a
master administrator who promoted
Stanford's Political Science Depart
ment from relative obscurity to suc
cess.
"The department was relatively
small at the time, and not particular
ly well-known nationwide," Steiner
said. "[Walker] brought it up from a
low point."
Walker, Steiner said, ran meet
ings with skill. "He tried to bring ad
ministrative oversight to chaos ... It
didn't always go over so well."
Walker was also known for his in
fectious sense of humor and boom
ing laugh. Steiner remembered that
his wife, who is hard of hearing,
could walk into a party and immedi
ately know that Walker was there.
"You could always hear his voice
and his laughter," Steiner said.
A memorial service is planned at
Memorial Church at 3:30 p.m. on
Monday, March 16.
