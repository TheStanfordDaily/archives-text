Junior guard Kris Weems fights through traffic in the Cardinal s victory over California last week.
Weems and the No. 14 Cardinal need a victory over ninth-ranked UCLA to salvage a position as a con
ference contender.
part of the year. We've just got to
bear down and focus on the last
games in the Pac-10."
The No. 14 Cardinal (19-3, 8-2
Pacific 10 Conference) has the op
portunity to pull itself out if its re
cent tailspin and reclaim its spot as
a conference contender.
When ninth-ranked UCLA (18-
4, 8-3) visited Maples Pavilion on
Jan. 17, Stanford impressed the na
tion by holding off a furious sec
ond-half rally by the Bruins to go
on to the 93-80 victory.
But that victory was the last
bright spot before the Cardinal's
current slump.
Since then the team has gone 3-
3. The stretch began with an unin
spired 10-point win over Washing
ton State, followed by a squeaker
with Washington.
The Cardinal seemed to right it
self in its loss to Arizona. Though
the Wildcats won by 18, it was due
far more to their outstanding play,
not to any poor performance by the

Cardinal.
Then came the wake-up call.
An overtime loss to Arizona
State at Maples on Jan. 31 sudden
ly had the team looking all too
beatable.
The team bounced back with a
victory over California last
Wednesday but only after being
out-hustled and outplayed in the
first half.
And after the dismantling at the
hands of Connecticut, the nation is
questioning whether the Cardinal
18-0 start was truly the product of a
great team or a mere fluke.
So tonight's matchup with the
Bruins becomes the new biggest
game of the season in a long line of
such contests.
If the Cardinal loses, it all but
eliminates the team from any shot
at the conference title. A loss also
drops the team in the eyes of the
nation's poll voters and — more
important — the tournament seed
ing committee.
Since this disruption began, the
Cardinal seems to have lost its con
fident edge. Earlier this season,
head coach Mike Montgomery said

the team goes into each game be
lieving it can win. That probably
hasn't changed.
What has changed is just how
much people are willing to believe
that.
The squad has been timid in its
last six games, not at all reminiscent
of the team that creamed IJS(" by
37 points or stilled Oregon State's
offense, holding the Beavers to IK
percent shooting from the floor.
"Confidence is something that
you deal with throughout the sea
son and the more you put in, the
more positive reinforcement that
you get," Montgomery said.
"When you get beat up a little bit
like UConn did to us. obviously
what you've got to deal with is the
confidence.
"When the ball goes down you
look like you're great. When it
doesn't go down, you don't look so
good. A lot of times who you're
playing and where you're playing
and in what circumstances has a lot
to do with how you look."
Tonight's outcome could hinge
on which Cardinal team shows up.
Stanford needs to be the team

point halftime lead on the Bruins
almost a month ago. It can't afford
to be back on its heels, waiting t<>
react, as it has done all too often re
cently.
Montgomery canceled practice
on Monday in order to give the
players an opportunity to rest and.
hopefully, get back to their old
selves.
"It's been tough," Mont
gomery said. "We've been getting
