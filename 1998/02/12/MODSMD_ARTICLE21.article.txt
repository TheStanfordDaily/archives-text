Educa
tion Prof. Emeri
tus Robert
Politzer, a
renowned schol
ar in bilingual

and foreign language education,
died Jan. 26 after a long battle with
cancer.
Politzer, 76, taught at the School
of Education for 22 years, guiding
many of today's nationally known
experts in educating non-English
speaking immigrant students.
"He trained virtually an entire
generation of researchers who are all
very active todav around the countrv

and around the world," said Educa
tion Prof. Kenji Hakuta, who does
research in the same field.
Politzer's interest in finding the
best way to make non-native speak
ers proficient in English stemmed
from his own background as a
refugee, Hakuta said. Born to a Jew
ish family in Vienna, Politzer fled
Austria with his brother in 1938 after
the Nazis took power. Once safely
across the Atlantic, he returned to
Europe as an intelligence agent with
the U.S. Army.
"He came from an immigrant and
minority background and was very
committed to doing research to im
prove the situation for language-mi
nority students in the United
States," Hakuta said.
After the war, Politzer earned a

doctorate in linguistics at Columbia
University, which he supplemented
with a doctorate in social sciences
from New York's New School for
Social Research.
In 1963, he joined the Stanford
faculty, eventually sponsoring more
than 200 students working toward
doctorates in applied linguistics and
language education.
"He was very big-hearted,"
Hakuta said. "He took on a lot of
students who many faculty would
not because they were outside his
area of interest."
Politzer's area of interest itself
spanned a range much wider than
average, Hakuta said.
Students and colleagues will re
member Politzer for "his versatility
and breadth of scholarship," he

added. "He worked in a number of
areas â€” far broader than many
scholars."
Remembering Politzer's work is
particularly timely in light of an ini
tiative aiming to end bilingual edu
cation in schools on which Californi
ans will vote next fall, Hakuta noted.
Politzer was "very committed to
serious scholarship in an area other
wise overrun by political slogans,"
he said.
Politzer is survived by Frieda, his
wife of 51 years, as well as four sons
and three granddaughters. Contri
butions in his name may be made to
the School of Education Scholarship
Fund, Stanford, Calif. 94305.
A memorial service is scheduled
for Feb. 22 at 3 p.m. at the Center for
Educational Research at Stanford.
