# Golfer Casey Martin wins court ruling
## 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
A federal court in Eugene, Ore.,
has granted disabled golfer and Stan
ford alumnus Casey Martin the right
to use a golf cart on the professional
golfing tour.
Martin had asked for a cart to ac
commodate a rare circulatory disor
der in his right leg that makes it
painful and even dangerous for him
to walk. According to doctors, every
step he takes on the leg brings it one
step closer to fracture and amputa
tion.
Initially rebuffed by the PGA
Tour, Martin sued the organization
under the Americans with Disabili
ties Act. He is the first person to in
voke the law in order to compete in a
professional sport.
Martin felt the ruling was a sym
bolic victory for all those with dis

abilities.
"I realized if 1 win, it would open
the way," he told the Associated
Press. "That's something to feel
good about.
"I hope five to 10years from now,
if I'm still able to play golf, the PCI A
Tour will lean back and scratch their
heads and say, 'Why did we fight this
guy?'"
The PGA Tour contended that
granting Martin the right to ride the
course in a cart would give him an
undue advantage over other players
who had to expend the energy to
march 18 holes.
But U.S. Magistrate Thomas Cof
fin, after only three hours of deliber
ation, decided he wasn't convinced
that exempting Martin from walking
the course would alter the competi
tive level on the tour.
"The fatigue level from his condi
tion is easily greater than that of an

able-bodied person walking the
same course," Coffin said.
Many professional golfers dis
agreed.
Fred Couples, with a chronically
sore back, said it's "much easier to
play golf riding a cart.
"I don't understand how anyone
can say, in golf, you don't expend
any energy playing it," said Cou
ples, in Honolulu for this week
end's Hawaiian Open. " That's the
biggest farce in the world. That's
the only thing that irritates me
about this."
PGA Tour spokesman Bob
Combs said that the tour would ap
peal the ruling but would provide a
cart for Martin in the interim.
"Now we have an obligation to
provide Martin with a cart, and we
will," Combs said.
Martin plans to use a cart in
Austin, Texas, on March 3 in the

second leg of the Nike tour. Using a
cart ordered by a court injunction
last month, Martin won the tour's
event in Lakeland, Fla., amid a
throng of reporters and media rep
resentatives.
Throughout the court battle,
Martin was on the receiving end of
an outpour of support that included
encouragement from his former
Stanford golf coach, Wally Good
win, and presidential candidate Bob
Dole. He was also featured in Nike's
"I Can" ad campaign.
Looking back on his career in
golf, Martin broke down in front of
reporters.
" This has been a tough time," he
said. "It has also been a great experi
ence. There would have been no case
without the people praying for me."
