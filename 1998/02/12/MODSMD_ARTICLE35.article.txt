# interview
## Renaissance Man of Porn 
### Nkomo Morris Editorial Staff Mr. Porn 
What? You haven't heard of
"The Renaissance Man of Porn?"
That's fine — neither had I be
fore I went to the San Jose Film
Festival's kickoff press confer
ence, where I delightfully soaked
up the presence of actor Kevin
Spacey, "Midnight Cowboy" di
rector John Schlesinger and "48
Hours" director Walter Hill.
I was expecting to take off
soon after Kevin Spacey finished
his spiel, but instead I found my
self staring at the unsavory mug

of a man who could've been
anyone. His white T-shirt t

had what looked like a
naked woman on it, .

and his gray five
o'clock shadow re-

minded me of an
English teacher

I didn't like
in high *

school.

But if nothing else, 1
the man had presence and "
something to say. He was at

the press conference to help
promote "The Story of X," a
documentary about the histo-

J —
ry of porn cinema. I decided to
give it a go, and raced after him
with a pen poised to take his
number.
Strangely enough, he said he
wouldn't mind an interview,
handed me his card and waited
for the questions. But 1 wasn't
ready. I needed backup. So I
called him a few days later, armed
with company.
I turned to my friends: se
niors Nathan Emerson Jones and
Michael Glass agreed to help me
interview Mr. William Margold,
who has done everything in and
for the porn industry, including
acting in movies and testifying in
front of Congress.
Intermission: How did you get
started in the porn industry?
William Margold: I got started
doing what you're doing now. I
was a journalist, my degree is in
journalism from California State
University at Northridge. I've
been a syndicated film reviewer
since 1968, and I came into this
business to write about this busi
ness.
I: What is your role in the porn
industry?
WM: 1 have done every single
thing there is to do in this busi
ness.
I: Did you have any plans initial
ly to join the industry?
WM: My intention was to ex
plore every avenue, to go under

every sheet, to climb under every
bed in the business and expose it
as an entertainment medium. I
had no idea that 1 would be able
to get up, get in, get out, and get
off on cue. 1 had no idea that I
would be able to function in the
business at all. And when 1 dis
covered that I could add that to
the mix, it made me a much more
valuable reporter. So when peo
ple asked me, "How the hell do
you know what it's like?" 1 could
say, "I've been there."
I: When was your first film?
WM: August of 1972, but that
was more of an accident. My first
i C' I •

real film was in October
, 1972.
IT i i ri 112 11 r. c I

I: Why should Stanford
students care about you?
How are you affecting our
lives? Why is it important

that we know about you at
all?

WM: I represent

one letter
in the

most misunderstood and most
maligned letter in the alphabet,
due to guilt and misinformation.
That letter is X. We're a very
guilty country — a very frustrat
ed country in terms of sex. We
roll in the carrion of violence, but
we giggle when it comes to sexu
ality.
I: What do you consider pornog
raphy?
WM: Pornography, to me, is the
fact that the Detroit Lions have
never won the Super Bowl. What
1 do is adult entertainment. It's a
paradoxical society that we live
in, as Nicholson has said, that
gives you an R-rating if you hack
a breast off, but you get an X-rat
ing if you kiss one.
I: What's your prognosis for the
future of adult entertainment?
WM: This is a cyclical business.
The X-rated industry has gotten
out of control in that it's bored
with itself. Porn is turning into
some sort of strange Roman Col
iseum freak show. There's no one
left to sacrifice except themselves.
I think its beyond the industry to
try and expand now, because we
do not have the pioneers. We
don't have the people who came
into this business as cinematic
disobedftnf personas. They
didn't come in to do a four-letter
word, they came in to do the five
letter word: R-E-B-E-L.
I: What did you think about
"Boogie Nights?"

WM: I despised "Boogie
Nights." I despised it because it
was inaccurate and it was boring.
I can look at it as a film reviewer
first and as a person who lived it
second. That was not the life 1
led. At that time, we could go to
jail every single day. We were ab
solutely outlaws on movie
posters.
I: What do you think about porn
today in comparison to the porn
industry of old?
WM: Now we have Cro-Mag
num men and marshmallow
women. We pound out loads of
white bread at an enormous pace
with the life expectancy of
mayflies. Our actors come into
the industry and they all look the
same, they all die (lose populari
ty) within the same period of
time. That is abhorrent. My pri
mary purpose (aside from get
ting America off) is to entertain
America. As I have said before,
sex and horror are basically iden
tical. Until you saw the shark in
"Jaws," you would have been too
scared to take a bath. Once you
saw the shark, it wasn't scary any
more because you rationalized it.

And think of the most
' horrifying movie of all
time, "Rosemary's Baby."
You never know what

you're frightened of, but you are
terrified.
I: So how's that sort of cinematic
skill going to be reintroduced to
the industry?
WM: It's can't be. Do you know
what it takes to introduce real
sexual fantasies, real sexual won
derment and titillation? It takes
time. It takes money. The indus
try is not interested in spending
either. It simply wants to punch
out porn movies like cookie
dough monsters and have them
lumber into the world. And no
one complains because no one
admits to watching them. It's the
responsibility of the public to go
get these tapes, take out the tapes,
stuff a dead rat in the box and
send it back to the company with
a note that says, "This movie
stinks."
I: Tell us a little about "The Story
of X."
WM: Chuck Workman made
the movie. It should play very
well in classrooms. It's an excel
lent catalyst for a class I'd like to
teach called "The ABCs of X."
The adult entertainment indus
try is a 25-year-old sociological
phenomenon, born legitimately
for public consumption in 1972.
I am also interested in protecting
adult welfare, that is, the welfare
of the performer. That is why I
started Protecting Adult Welfare

(PAW). We provide peer counseling and a 24-
hour 800 help line, among other services.
I: What are your goals for the future?
WM: I am mostjvibrant doing what 1 am
doing right now. And even though I seem like
an egotistical asshole, it's better to be that
than a whole ass.
I: What did you think of "Showgirls?"
WM: "Showgirls" is repellent! 1 despise Las

Vegas, so anything that paints Las Vegas ugly
makes me happy. But Vegas has one of the
great vices of all time, and that's gambling. I'm
rather moralistic, which is a sort of paradox.
I've never done a single drug in my entire life.
The only drug I ever take is me, and if I can get
high on myself I go to sleep. I rarely drink. I'm
usually driven to drink by the depression that
comes from watching the Lions lose.

I: When you involved in
the industry, wbaT was your position, and
what papers did fchr?
WB: I wrote the iin&crground papers. A
paper called Spectrum West, another paper
called The Hollywood And another
paper called Swing. I fwdly went into my first
adult entertainment uidis&ry experience ex
pecting to fiKtf I had no idea that I would be
able to be oufcpntra. I had no idea what
being on camera was all about The pressures
are phenomenal. Ifs analogous to a baseball
game where itVbottom of the ninth, bases
loaded, and you can't foul off the

ball. It's Elway on the Drive. You can't miss a
pass.
I: What do you think about sex workers?
WB: Whorehouses are good things. But to
pick up a hooker off the street is to take your
life in your own hands.
I: Tell us about your family.
WB: 1 have three wonderful children. People
ask me if 1 will let my kids into the industry
when they are 18 years old, and 1 say that it's
their choice,

I: Why should Stanford
students care about you?
How are you affecting our
lives? Why is it important

that we know about you at
all?

WM: I represent

one letter
in the

most misunderstood and most
maligned letter in the alphabet,
due to guilt and misinformation.
That letter is X. We're a very
guilty country — a very frustrat
ed country in terms of sex. We
roll in the carrion of violence, but
we giggle when it comes to sexu
ality.
I: What do you consider pornog
raphy?
WM: Pornography, to me, is the
fact that the Detroit Lions have
never won the Super Bowl. What
1 do is adult entertainment. It's a
paradoxical society that we live
in, as Nicholson has said, that
gives you an R-rating if you hack
a breast off, but you get an X-rat
ing if you kiss one.
I: What's your prognosis for the
future of adult entertainment?
WM: This is a cyclical business.
The X-rated industry has gotten
out of control in that it's bored
with itself. Porn is turning into
some sort of strange Roman Col
iseum freak show. There's no one
left to sacrifice except themselves.
I think its beyond the industry to
try and expand now, because we
do not have the pioneers. We
don't have the people who came
into this business as cinematic
disobedftnf personas. They
didn't come in to do a four-letter
word, they came in to do the five
letter word: R-E-B-E-L.
I: What did you think about
"Boogie Nights?"

WM: I despised "Boogie
Nights." I despised it because it
was inaccurate and it was boring.
I can look at it as a film reviewer
first and as a person who lived it
second. That was not the life 1
led. At that time, we could go to
jail every single day. We were ab
solutely outlaws on movie
posters.
I: What do you think about porn
today in comparison to the porn
industry of old?
WM: Now we have Cro-Mag
num men and marshmallow
women. We pound out loads of
white bread at an enormous pace
with the life expectancy of
mayflies. Our actors come into
the industry and they all look the
same, they all die (lose populari
ty) within the same period of
time. That is abhorrent. My pri
mary purpose (aside from get
ting America off) is to entertain
America. As I have said before,
sex and horror are basically iden
tical. Until you saw the shark in
"Jaws," you would have been too
scared to take a bath. Once you
saw the shark, it wasn't scary any
more because you rationalized it.

And think of the most
' horrifying movie of all
time, "Rosemary's Baby."
You never know what

you're frightened of, but you are
terrified.
I: So how's that sort of cinematic
skill going to be reintroduced to
the industry?
WM: It's can't be. Do you know
what it takes to introduce real
sexual fantasies, real sexual won
derment and titillation? It takes
time. It takes money. The indus
try is not interested in spending
either. It simply wants to punch
out porn movies like cookie
dough monsters and have them
lumber into the world. And no
one complains because no one
admits to watching them. It's the
responsibility of the public to go
get these tapes, take out the tapes,
stuff a dead rat in the box and
send it back to the company with
a note that says, "This movie
stinks."
I: Tell us a little about "The Story
of X."
WM: Chuck Workman made
the movie. It should play very
well in classrooms. It's an excel
lent catalyst for a class I'd like to
teach called "The ABCs of X."
The adult entertainment indus
try is a 25-year-old sociological
phenomenon, born legitimately
for public consumption in 1972.
I am also interested in protecting
adult welfare, that is, the welfare
of the performer. That is why I
started Protecting Adult Welfare

(PAW). We provide peer counseling and a 24-
hour 800 help line, among other services.
I: What are your goals for the future?
WM: I am mostjvibrant doing what 1 am
doing right now. And even though I seem like
an egotistical asshole, it's better to be that
than a whole ass.
I: What did you think of "Showgirls?"
WM: "Showgirls" is repellent! 1 despise Las

Vegas, so anything that paints Las Vegas ugly
makes me happy. But Vegas has one of the
great vices of all time, and that's gambling. I'm
rather moralistic, which is a sort of paradox.
I've never done a single drug in my entire life.
The only drug I ever take is me, and if I can get
high on myself I go to sleep. I rarely drink. I'm
usually driven to drink by the depression that
comes from watching the Lions lose.

I: When you involved in
the industry, wbaT was your position, and
what papers did fchr?
WB: I wrote the iin&crground papers. A
paper called Spectrum West, another paper
called The Hollywood And another
paper called Swing. I fwdly went into my first
adult entertainment uidis&ry experience ex
pecting to fiKtf I had no idea that I would be
able to be oufcpntra. I had no idea what
being on camera was all about The pressures
are phenomenal. Ifs analogous to a baseball
game where itVbottom of the ninth, bases
loaded, and you can't foul off the

ball. It's Elway on the Drive. You can't miss a
pass.
I: What do you think about sex workers?
WB: Whorehouses are good things. But to
pick up a hooker off the street is to take your
life in your own hands.
I: Tell us about your family.
WB: 1 have three wonderful children. People
ask me if 1 will let my kids into the industry
when they are 18 years old, and 1 say that it's
their choice,

What? You haven't heard of
"The Renaissance Man of Porn?"
That's fine — neither had I be
fore I went to the San Jose Film
Festival's kickoff press confer
ence, where I delightfully soaked
up the presence of actor Kevin
Spacey, "Midnight Cowboy" di
rector John Schlesinger and "48
Hours" director Walter Hill.
I was expecting to take off
soon after Kevin Spacey finished
his spiel, but instead I found my
self staring at the unsavory mug

of a man who could've been
anyone. His white T-shirt t

had what looked like a
naked woman on it, .

and his gray five
o'clock shadow re-

minded me of an
English teacher

I didn't like
in high *

school.

But if nothing else, 1
the man had presence and "
something to say. He was at

the press conference to help
promote "The Story of X," a
documentary about the histo-

J —
ry of porn cinema. I decided to
give it a go, and raced after him
with a pen poised to take his
number.
Strangely enough, he said he
wouldn't mind an interview,
handed me his card and waited
for the questions. But 1 wasn't
ready. I needed backup. So I
called him a few days later, armed
with company.
I turned to my friends: se
niors Nathan Emerson Jones and
Michael Glass agreed to help me
interview Mr. William Margold,
who has done everything in and
for the porn industry, including
acting in movies and testifying in
front of Congress.
Intermission: How did you get
started in the porn industry?
William Margold: I got started
doing what you're doing now. I
was a journalist, my degree is in
journalism from California State
University at Northridge. I've
been a syndicated film reviewer
since 1968, and I came into this
business to write about this busi
ness.
I: What is your role in the porn
industry?
WM: 1 have done every single
thing there is to do in this busi
ness.
I: Did you have any plans initial
ly to join the industry?
WM: My intention was to ex
plore every avenue, to go under

every sheet, to climb under every
bed in the business and expose it
as an entertainment medium. I
had no idea that 1 would be able
to get up, get in, get out, and get
off on cue. 1 had no idea that I
would be able to function in the
business at all. And when 1 dis
covered that I could add that to
the mix, it made me a much more
valuable reporter. So when peo
ple asked me, "How the hell do
you know what it's like?" 1 could
say, "I've been there."
I: When was your first film?
WM: August of 1972, but that
was more of an accident. My first

real film was in October
