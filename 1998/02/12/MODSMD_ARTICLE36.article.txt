## Tom Edison's Quirkier Legacy The
						17th Annual Black Maria Film Festival Makes its Only West Coast Screening at Stanford 
### Zachary Roberts Senior staff writer 
Traveling festivals are an
expected part of modern cul
ture. From the circus to the
rock tour, from the monster
trucks to the computer expos,
they are the norm.
Except, curiously, for the
film industry. Many of the
major film festivals are named
for their geographic locations
— like the Cannes Film Festival
and the Telluride Film Festival.
And most others— like Robert
Redfords Sundance Film Festi
val — are given sexy names to
make them more attractive.
These stationary festivals
— which screen mostly non-

Hollywood full feature-length
films — draw international au
diences, whereas the small,
traveling film festivals usually
show several short films at each
stop. But the fans of the travel
ing festivals — like the Stanford
Film Society (SFS) — are as de
voted as the fans of their bigger
cousins.
The SFS — also responsible
for bringing another major
American traveling film festival
to campus every fall, Spike and
Mike's Sick and Twisted (a col
lection of animated shorts) —
hosts the 17th Annual Black
Maria Film and Video Festival
tonight at Memorial Auditori
um. The only West Coast ap
pearance for the festival will be

held in two two-hour screen
ings, one at 8 p.m. and one at 10
p.m.
This is also the third year in
a row that the SFS has brought
the Black Maria Festival to
campus. But unlike Spike and
Mike's, which repeats several
shorts every year, the Black
Maria is different with every
showing.
History
The Black Maria Film and
Video Festival is named for the
turn-of-the-century film stu
dio of Thomas Alva Edison. His
work with the young medium
of the motion picture included
building the Black Maria, "the
world's first purpose-built film
studio," according to festival
director John Columbus.
Built in West Orange, New
Jersey, the Black Maria was
named for the paddy wagons of
the epoch because of its physi
cal resemblance to those
trucks. Mounted on a circular
track and equipped with a
hinged roof, the building could
rotate to provide different an
gles and amounts of light into
the studios within.
The Black Maria was the
ancestor of the modern R&D
lab. According to the National
Park Service Web site
(www.nps.gov/edis/) inven
tions conceived at the Edison
National Historic Site (as the
Laboratory Unit and Glenmont
home are now called) included
"the motion picture camera,
vastly improved phonographs,
sound recordings, silent and
sound movies and the nickel
iron alkaline electric storage
battery."
The Festival
The festival — composed

of 50 pieces selected from al
most 900 entries — shows what
the audience wants to see from
its stash of films. Columbus
travels from screening to
screening with a trunk full of
tapes and gauges each venue to
determine the evening's show.
Born in New Jersey,
Columbus is the driving force
behind the festival. Visits as a
child to the Edison Historic Site
and its recreated Black Maria
studio (the original was de
stroyed in a fire) sparked his
imagination.
Columbus got his first
camera at 13, and from the start
— perhaps because of his per
sonal connection to the Edison
Site — he has always been more
interested in personal, alterna
tive and independent films
rather than full Hollywood fea
tures.
Begun in 1981, the festival
picks films that "promote and
exhibit alternative film and
video works representing a
wide variety of styles and gen
res which illuminate the
human condition, reveal imag
ination and visually poetic
form," Columbus said. Indeed,
the credo of the festival is to
show work that explores the
nature of the medium itself
and its potential.
For the first few years, the
festival allowed only films to be
entered. In 1984, tne develop
ment of video art was such that
Columbus began to allow it
into the festival as well.
The films — up to 105 min
utes in length — are divided
into "Jury's Choice," "Jury Ci
tation" and "Director's
Choice," which correspond to
first, second and third place.
The festival is a special
project of The Edison Media

Arts Consortium, which is
based at the Department of
Media Arts at Jersey City State
College in Jersey City, New Jer
sey. Seventy-five percent of the
budget for the festival comes
from grants, including the
NEA and the New Jersey State
Council on the Arts.
Judges for this year's festi
val include Sally Berger, a cura
tor in the film and video de
partment of the Museum of
Modern Art in Manhattan;
Thomas Guy, an independent
producer and director; Peter
Hutton, a filmmaker and facul
ty at Bard College; Cara
Liebenson, a senior program
associate at PBS; and Marian
Masone, a program director at
the Lincoln Center Film Soci
ety.
Go To The Show
Stanford is lucky to get the
Black Maria Film and Video
Festival to return for the third
straight year. Very few touring
art exhibits showcase the work
of contemporary artists, and
most museum exhibits are one
time collaborations that appear
in a given space once.
The festival is able to return
because it has built a strong fan
base and effectively engages its
audience.
Columbus understands
that some people have certain
artistic interests, and for that
reason the festival will have two
different showings tonight at
Memorial Auditorium. The
program at 8 p.m. will have
more narrative-type and less
experimental/documentary
films. The 10 p.m. program will
feature more of the experimen
tal and documentary films and
less narrative films.
