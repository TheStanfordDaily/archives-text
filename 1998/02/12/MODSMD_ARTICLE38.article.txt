## Dangerous Beauty 
### 
Poetry, dueling, and sex—it's all in a day's
work for Veronica Franco, the subject of the new
film "Dangerous Beauty." Based on a true story,
the film follows Veronica's life as the most cele
brated courtesan of 16th century Venice.
Veronica, played with bravado and sin
cerity by Catherine McCormack (the ill
fated wife in "Braveheart") is a blossoming
young woman in Venetian society when
handsome Marco Valieri (Rufus Sewell) re
turns home from traveling abroad. Veronica
— who hides forbidden books under her
skirts and secretly writes poetry — and

Marco, thrilled by the fact that her brains
compliment her beauty, fall in love.
Despite Veronica's brains, beauty and
pedigree family lineage, she and Marco are
warned that their marriage can never be —
Marco must marry for inheritance, posi
tion and duty. And as Veronica's mother
Faola reminds her, "Marriage is a contract,
not a perpetual tryst."
Still, Veronica may have Marco — just
not in matrimony. Paola suggests Veronica
do what she did in her youth — be a cour

tesan. Despite Veronica's shock, she is given a
choice for her future — living locked up in a
nunnery or having the chance to embrace
everything denied to the virtuous wives of
Venice. The latter is her ticket to education,
economic power and the chance to choose
with whom she goes to bed. The choice is
clear, and Veronica's training commences.
Veronica shines in the Venetian court;
while her beauty captures men's attention,
her wit and intelligence keep them returning.
But underneath her polished facade, her
heart still belongs to Marco. And just as
Veronica masters her trade, along comes the
Inquisition, the plague and a war to threaten
Marco's life as well as her own coveted posi
tion in society.

Fear not — "Pretty Woman" meets Mer
chant Ivory this isn't. Veronica isn't just a
whore with a heart of gold — she's a realist
who uses her position to make her way in a
society where women are illiterate property,
valued only for their uteruses and dowries.
Far from giving us a Cinderella story, the film
depicts a woman who plays by the rules of a
grossly unequal and patriarchal society —
and wins.
Directed by Marshall Herskovitz, best
known as producer of "thirtysomething ..."
"Dangerous Beauty" depicts a feminist who
has the confidence to achieve her desires with
courage instead of whining. In an age of cer
tain hypocrisy, Veronica pierces her audiences
with the knowledge of their faults and wrongs,

instead of simply pointing a
well-manicured finger to
blame them.

And through it all, she's stunning, as
is the rest of the film. From the costumes to
the production design, "Dangerous Beauty"
presents a Venice of sensuality, lavish wealth
and infectious beauty with a fine thread of
corruption running throughout. You can't
help but notice that Veronica's whalebone
wonders must be painful, that the lustrous
canals must smell and that the lascivious
lifestyle of the Venetian court can be destruc
tive, despite it's freedom. This beauty is seduc
tive, deceiving and most certainly dangerous.
