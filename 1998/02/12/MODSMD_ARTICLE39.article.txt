INTERMISSION: You've gone from
producing "thirtysomething.. ." to pro
ducing "My So-Called Life" and from
directing "Jack the Bear" to directing
"Dangerous Beauty." What drew you to
it?

MARSHALL HERSKOVITZ:

When I was an undergraduate, I studied
Old English, and my first screenplay was a script of Beowulf. All I've ever wanted to do is
big, epic period pieces. So "Dangerous Beauty" is far closer to the kind of movie 1 always
wanted to make rather than "thirtysomething ..." My partner (Edward Zwick) and I
have a deep interest in two areas of subject matter: one being the close examination of
human relationships, and the other being discussing about what an epic story is and why
it's important in our lives today to remember what epic stories are.
I: The film is about gender, inequality, sexual politics and being female amidst patriarchy.
That isn't really a new subject. So how do you feel being a 20th-century male going into
it?
MH: I half identify with Veronica, and I'm half in love with her. I think the issues of how
we free ourselves from the puritanical underpinnings of our society is something that
men and women face. A divorce of sexuality and sensuality from everyday life came in at
this time, and we still live under it today. This film takes a very definite point of view
about integrating sexuality into everyday life. It's still a big problem in our culture. There
are still these boxes that we put people in, and the film is daring to say, "Here's a woman
who's a prostitute, a poet, a lover, and an amazing human being for being all of those
'things."
I: How did you go about picking Catherine McCormack — did you say to yourself,
"There's my 16th century courtesan?"
MH: It was hard to find our Veronica. There are
very few stars of her age, and none of them were

going to play this part be
cause it was too dangerous.
I met with over 120 actress
es for the part. If you're
portraying a remarkable
person, you need a remark
able person to do the job.
You can fake being a lot of
things, but you can't fake
intelligence. You can't fake
beauty. You can't fake the
ability to be articulate. And
I needed somebody who
could do all of those things.
I: Was it as trying or as
lengthy to pick the others, like
Rufus Sewell?

MH: The part of Marco falls into a gray area in Hol
lywood where he's the male star of the movie but
he's not THE star of the movie, so you weren't going
to get a big star to play that part. Then it was a ques
tion of finding the best actor for the part. Also, we
felt that this was Ruhis' time. He's very well known
in England, hardly known in the United States, and
it was the first time he was willing to play a leading

man because he loves to play bad boys. If he could
play old men, heroin addicts and transvestites, he'd
be happy. He found it a real challenge just to be the

guy. We had fun
easing our way
into this.
I: Veronica's
journey into
being a prosti
tute is depicted
with a lot of wit
and humor. Is
that Hollywood
or is that histo
ry?
MH: That's his
tory. The movie's
not an advertise
ment for being a

prostitute, but I wanted an audience to confront
some of the positive aspects of this life. If you were a
regular girl who got married, you had the worst life
imaginable. Your husband didn't pay any attention to
you, you had no education. Courtesans were the ones
who were educated, who were artists. They could
own their own houses. They could have love in their
lives. At that time, what we call romantic love existed
only among courtesans and their clients. The irony of
the story is that in being a courtesan, this woman
found a level of freedom that many women today still
cannot find. And there's an inherent value in a moth
er teaching a daughter about sex. You don't see that
very often in our culture.
