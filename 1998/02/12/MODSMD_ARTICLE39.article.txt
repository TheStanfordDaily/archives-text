INTERMISSION: You've gone from
producing "thirtysomething.. ." to pro
ducing "My So-Called Life" and from
directing "Jack the Bear" to directing
"Dangerous Beauty." What drew you to
it?

MARSHALL HERSKOVITZ:

When I was an undergraduate, I studied
Old English, and my first screenplay was a script of Beowulf. All I've ever wanted to do is
big, epic period pieces. So "Dangerous Beauty" is far closer to the kind of movie 1 always
wanted to make rather than "thirtysomething ..." My partner (Edward Zwick) and I
have a deep interest in two areas of subject matter: one being the close examination of
human relationships, and the other being discussing about what an epic story is and why
it's important in our lives today to remember what epic stories are.
I: The film is about gender, inequality, sexual politics and being female amidst patriarchy.
That isn't really a new subject. So how do you feel being a 20th-century male going into
it?
MH: I half identify with Veronica, and I'm half in love with her. I think the issues of how
we free ourselves from the puritanical underpinnings of our society is something that
men and women face. A divorce of sexuality and sensuality from everyday life came in at
this time, and we still live under it today. This film takes a very definite point of view
about integrating sexuality into everyday life. It's still a big problem in our culture. There
are still these boxes that we put people in, and the film is daring to say, "Here's a woman
who's a prostitute, a poet, a lover, and an amazing human being for being all of those
'things."
I: How did you go about picking Catherine McCormack — did you say to yourself,
"There's my 16th century courtesan?"
