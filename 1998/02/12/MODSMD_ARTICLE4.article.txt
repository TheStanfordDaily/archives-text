# Andrus gives ASSU address
## 
### James Pritchard Contributing writer 
ASSU President Emily Andrus
called the current year "one of the
most successful years for the ASSU
in a long time" in her State of the
Association address last night.
She compared the year to previ
ous years at the ASSU, stating that
Stanford students wanted "an
ASSU that spent more time work
ing towards its goals and less time
bickering over politics."
"Students didn't elect us to
make big speeches," she said.
"Ihey wanted us to get things
done."
Last night's meeting was neces
sary to ensure the ASSU adhered
to their constitution. The ASSU
Constitution was amended in IW6
to require a State of the Associa
tion address between the third and
fifth week of the second quarter.
Monday marked the fifth week of
classes this quarter.
Andrus went on to cite specific
achievements of the ASSU so far
this year and enumerated goals for
the second half of the school year.
The speech emphasized a posi
tive relationship between the fi
nancial side of the ASSU and the
actual ASSU Senate. She felt this

year had run more smoothly, in
contrast to bickering between the
two sides in recent years. Andrus
reported a return of 12 percent on
the ASSU endowment of $3.3 mil
lion.
In addition, the ASSU mailed
information to 1 freshman this
summer in an attempt to educate
incoming students about the bene
fits they receive from the organiza
tion.
Another significant project this
year has been the course guide.
Andrus said. The guide will be
posted to the Stanford Virtual Di
rectory once the information has
been compiled and organized.
The ASSU has also reserved
funding for a disability access pro
ject that will obtain a golf cart in
tended for people in wheelchairs.
"We really have laid the
groundwork for an ASSU which
will make a concrete difference on
lives of students on campus." she
said in her appraisal of the ASSU's
actions so far this year.
She went on to discuss plans for
the rest of this quarter and spring
quarter.
Focus projects for the ASSU for
the remainder of the vear include
an assessment of graduate student
housing, a publication of a Draw
guide to aid students' understand
ing of the Draw, as well as an
ASSU news report which will be
distributed to dorms.
The ASSU will also look at de
veloping a task force on the status
of special fees for student groups.
Andrus commended the senate
for the planned dorm outreach
program, which will be held for the
first time next Tuesday. The dia
logue will bring students and 35
administrators together at six dif
ferent dorms to discuss University
issues. The ASSU hopes to change
how students raise concerns to the

student government.
Deputy Senate Chair Matt
Spence commented, "In the past,
the ASSU has expected students to
come up to them to bring up issues."
Senate bills were debated after
the conclusion of Andrus' speech,
including a bill to approve umbrel
la groups for the 19% special fee
elections.
The bill will enable the various
subgroups under larger organiza
tions, such as the Women's Coali
tion, to apply for special fees as a
unified group. The bill passed.
The senate also passed a bill for
the creation of the ASSU Alliance
to Control Tuition. The bill cited a
need to investigate the causes of
tuition increases, based on the fact
that tuition has been rising at lev
els above inflation.
