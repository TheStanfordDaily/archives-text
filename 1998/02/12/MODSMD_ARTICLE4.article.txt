### James Pritchard Contributing writer 
ASSU President Emily Andrus
called the current year "one of the
most successful years for the ASSU
in a long time" in her State of the
Association address last night.
She compared the year to previ
ous years at the ASSU, stating that
Stanford students wanted "an
ASSU that spent more time work
ing towards its goals and less time
bickering over politics."
"Students didn't elect us to
make big speeches," she said.
"Ihey wanted us to get things
done."
Last night's meeting was neces
sary to ensure the ASSU adhered
to their constitution. The ASSU
Constitution was amended in IW6
to require a State of the Associa
tion address between the third and
fifth week of the second quarter.
Monday marked the fifth week of
classes this quarter.
Andrus went on to cite specific
achievements of the ASSU so far
this year and enumerated goals for
the second half of the school year.
The speech emphasized a posi
tive relationship between the fi
nancial side of the ASSU and the
actual ASSU Senate. She felt this

year had run more smoothly, in
contrast to bickering between the
two sides in recent years. Andrus
reported a return of 12 percent on
the ASSU endowment of $3.3 mil
lion.
In addition, the ASSU mailed
information to 1 freshman this
summer in an attempt to educate
incoming students about the bene
fits they receive from the organiza
tion.
Another significant project this
year has been the course guide.
Andrus said. The guide will be
posted to the Stanford Virtual Di
rectory once the information has
been compiled and organized.
The ASSU has also reserved
funding for a disability access pro
ject that will obtain a golf cart in
tended for people in wheelchairs.
"We really have laid the
groundwork for an ASSU which
will make a concrete difference on
lives of students on campus." she
said in her appraisal of the ASSU's
actions so far this year.
She went on to discuss plans for
the rest of this quarter and spring
quarter.
Focus projects for the ASSU for
the remainder of the vear include
