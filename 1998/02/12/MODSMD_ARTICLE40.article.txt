Catherine McCormack
INTERMISSION: Why did you de
cide to take the role?
CATHERINE McCORMACK: I
decided to take the role because 1 was
unemployed. A lot of scripts I seemed
to be receiving before that were based
upon "Braveheart", so I got a lot of love
interest type roles, which I just made a
conscious effort to avoid doing, because
I thought I'd be completely type-cast. It
was a wonderful role for a woman, ob
viously.
I: How did you prepare for the role as a
courtesan?
CM: You go to Soho and pick the real
ly nice brothels. You don't really have
to prepare. To transport yourself into
the 16th century you have the sets, the
costumes, the makeup, so you're
halfway there. Then you have the script
with the dialogue, and the rest is your

character bringing you into it. Obviously, I haven't been through what this woman has,
but I was interested in the love story and the various issues of women at the time, so you
just go and do your bit. And then people either like it or hate it.
I: If you were living in 16th century Venice, and mom said to you, "You need to help
the family out and go out and do your part," what would you do?
CM: If I had the choice back then of being a wife or the other choices, I'd definitely be
a courtesan. Of course, our film really makes it romantic and glamorous, and that was
a conscious decision that Marshall took that he wasn't going to show a gritty slice of life.
If I had the choice, I'd take the freedom to go into libraries and mix with people and
have interesting conversations and debates. And have some sex.
I: How was working with the other cast members?
CM: Great — there were so many of them, which was fantastic. I had so many differ
ent scenes with different people, and that was a luxury because so many films have so
many people and one character doesn't get to meet all the others. Rufus was this sort of
sex-symbol god in England and he's becoming more so over here as well; he had a great
sense of humor. He was fun.
I: It's evident early on how much Veronica's enjoying her career, and there's a lot of wit
in those scenes. Would you ever consider doing comedy?
CM: I would love to do some comedy. I'm doing
a British film where I get to play some mad Scot
tish, eccentric woman — lots of things happen to
her by circumstance, and things around her kind
of go wrong, so it brings out the comedy of the
character. I'd love to play some quirky, eccentric,
weird person, because I'm weird and stupid.
I: What was your favorite scene?

CM: The courtroom scenc, because it was kind
of like theater. It had continuity to it, and we
just ran it from beginning to end the entire
time. It's a luxury to do that in film because
you're always doing moments out of sync and
there are just very brief moments and you don't
get continuity, but with that, there was a kind of
build up.
I: What was the hardest scene to do?
CM: The love scenes, just because it's always a
bit embarrassing to make out in front of three
men, even if they're all just doing their jobs.
And you can't laugh, and it's all that screaming
— you just don't know how to portray real sex
on screen. I don't know how to portray real sex
on screen. Maybe people don't want to see real
sex scenes because there's all of that fumbling
and awkwardness.
Marshall said if we wanted music in the
background, it'd be fine. Originally I thought
that'd be a great idea, but then I thought it'd be
some schmaltzy stuff, and it would have made it
even worse.
