# press conference
## Bring in the Mavericks 
### Rito Treviño Editorial staff 
A crowded boardroom at
the Crowne Plaza Hotel in
downtown San Jose, a select
group of directors, writers and
actors marching one by one to a
single podium, and an array of
reporters and photographers
from the Bay Area — they all
added to the electric atmosphere
at a press conference for the
Cinequest San Jose Film Festival.
Backers of the Cinequest
festival, which ran from Jan. 29
to Feb. 4, stressed that all of
their guests were "m?vericks" —
people who bring "inr. vation,
artistry and personal vision" to
the film industry.
They represented almost
every stage in the filmmaker food
chain, from masters like John
Schlesinger to newbie directors
struggling to win their first dis
tributor. Kevin Spacey and Barry
Sonnenfeld stood on hand to talk
about their latest movies. As each
took his turn at the podium, the
mood in the room transformed
from awestricken to skeptical to
ecstatic.
Often the members of the
press were just as entertaining as
the guests. Jan Wahl, known for
her "Talkin' Pictures ..." week
ly show on BayTV, was all smiles
in her latest blue hat. Howie
Nave of the Palo Alto Daily
News disregarded the critical
approach and asked the direc
tors about his favorite scenes.
Here are the people who
were the highlights of the after
noon:
John Schlesinger
Academy Award-winning director of
"Midnight Cowboy," "Marathon
Man" and "Far From the Madding
Crowd"
Schlesinger, an Englishman
whose directing credits date back
to the early '60s, was greeted like
a true veteran of film should be.
His "maverick" films were made
30 years ago, when their content
was considered shocking. His
"Midnight Cowboy" is the only
X-rated film to win the Oscar for
Best Picture.
He was questioned about
every aspect of filmmaking,
from filmstock preservation to

making music videos for Sir
Paul McCartney.
When asked about the state
of the movie business today,
Schlesinger pointed towards a
lack of character-driven films.
"1 think there are big block
busters that are brilliantly made,
with all the technical achieve
ment that you could wish for,"
he said. "If only they could
spend as much time and trouble
and money on the screenplay."
He praised "Good Will
Hunting" for having a "well
written script by a very young
pair of actors." He enjoyed the
fact that Matt Damon and Ben
Affleck took the college environ
ment and made it appeal to the
adult mind.
Walter Hill
Writer and director of "48
Hours," "Red Heat" and "Last
Man Standing"; producer of the
"Alien" movies
"I just got off the plane, and
they tell me you have some ques
tions," said Hill when he arrived at
the podium. Everyone laughed,
creating a comfortable setting in
which to talk about action flicks.
One brave reporter asked
him about "Trespass" and "Wild
Bill," two movies being shown at
Cinequest that didn't have the
commercial success of his other
films.
"Am 1 happy that they're
being shown? Certainly," Hill
said . "They're made to be seen,
and when they don't achieve
the widest possible audience,
there's always a degree of disap
pointment."
He was also asked whether
he would continue working
with "Tales From the Crypt," the
HBO program that he has
helped produce and direct. His
response was positive.
"It's a chance to do something
rather perverse. [On film] you rarely
get the chance to portray protago
nists who are nasty people doing
nasty things. Commercial cinema
kind of forces you to be with the
good guys."
Ron Shelton
Writer and director of "Bull
Durham," "White Men Cant
Jump," and"Tin Cup."
In the wake of "The Post
man," which floundered at the
box office, reporters were eager

to talk to the man who'd made
two successful Kevin Costner
films. A reporter told Shelton
that his direction brought out
the best in Costner's acting and
asked if they would collaborate
again.
"No plans," Shelton replied.
"That doesn't mean we won't;
there's just no plans." On bring
ing out the best in Costner, he
said, "Kevin's the most prepared
actor you can dream 0f... he
tries things he hasn't tried be
fore ... With [these two films] I
let his mean streak come
through."
Many people also ques
tioned him about the fact that
most of his movies have sports
as a theme.
"I don't even like sports that
much," he said, much to the
amusement of the press. "I don't
watch professional sports any
more ... My baseball movie was
in the minor leagues, and my
basketball movie was on the
playground, so I think the more
interesting drama is outside the
spotlight... What sports gives
us is a mythological background,
a stage, that we all understand."
Shelton said that his next
two pictures will not be sports
related, although he wants to do
a boxing movie down the road.
Barry Sonnenfeld
Director of "The Addams Fami
ly" and "Men in Black"; cine
matographer for "Miller's Cross
ing" and "Misery"
Sonnenfeld was at
Cinequest to receive a lifetime
achievement award for his mas
terful use of film and technolo
gy. He seemed very happy in his
newfound popularity.
"I love all the attention I
can get. I'm an only child of
Jewish parents, so just give me
as much ... as you can "
Sonnenfeld talked about his
next film, "The Wild Wild
West," which will star Will
Smith as Jim West and Kevin
Kline as Artemus Gordon.
"I'm a little nervous about
it, because I have this theory
that you never want two funny
people in your movie," he said.
"The reason 'Men in Black'
worked so well was because you
had Tommy Lee Jones, a straight
man, and Will Smith, the funny
guy, like Burns and Allen, or Ab

bott and Costello."
When asked about making
the transition from cinematog
rapher to director, Sonnenfeld
noted, "I discovered that direct
ing is answering questions, and
through the accumulation of
answered questions, you create
tone and style and a point of
view."
He also joked that he had taught
the Coen brothers everything
they know.
Kevin Spacey
Academy Award-winning star of
"The Usual Suspects," "Swim
ming With Sharks," "A Time to
Kill," and "LA. Confidential"
Spacey was the only guest
who needed no introduction —
the moment he walked into the
room, the 10 or so photogra
phers went to work. As he
spoke, he gestured more than
the others; this man knew how
to present himself in front of the
cameras.
One reporter asked him
whether he was disappointed
that "Midnight in the Garden of
Good and Evil," his latest film,
didn't receive as much attention
as "L.A. Confidential."
"No, I'm not," Spacey said,
"because 1 don't base my judge
ment about how I feel about
films on how they do, outside of
the experience ... My memory
of ("Midnight"] is intact — my
love of that city, my admiration
for the people who allowed us to
be down there.
"None of that can possibly
be touched."
The press also asked him
about his first experience as a
director. His first film, "Albino
Alligator," was released in 1996.
"If I learned anything, it's
that there's a lot of acting in di
recting," he said. "Every day
you're being called upon to ne
gotiate with a large group of
people, and not all of them are
actors ... You discover your ca
pacity for leadership...
"I liked it a lot. and I'm
going to do it again, probably in
a year, but I won't tell you what
[the film is]."
When Spacey left the room, so
did half of the reporters, despite
the fact that there were four
guests left in the lineup. Talk
about swimming with sharks.

it, because I have this theory
that you never want two funny
people in your movie," he said.
"The reason 'Men in Black'
worked so well was because you
had Tommy Lee Jones, a straight
man, and Will Smith, the funny
guy, like Burns and Allen, or Ab

bott and Costello."
When asked about making
the transition from cinematog
rapher to director, Sonnenfeld
noted, "I discovered that direct
ing is answering questions, and
through the accumulation of
answered questions, you create
tone and style and a point of
view."
He also joked that he had taught
the Coen brothers everything
they know.
Kevin Spacey
Academy Award-winning star of
"The Usual Suspects," "Swim
ming With Sharks," "A Time to
Kill," and "LA. Confidential"
Spacey was the only guest
who needed no introduction —
the moment he walked into the
room, the 10 or so photogra
phers went to work. As he
spoke, he gestured more than
the others; this man knew how
to present himself in front of the
cameras.
One reporter asked him
whether he was disappointed
that "Midnight in the Garden of
Good and Evil," his latest film,
didn't receive as much attention
as "L.A. Confidential."
"No, I'm not," Spacey said,
"because 1 don't base my judge
ment about how I feel about
films on how they do, outside of
the experience ... My memory
of ("Midnight"] is intact — my
love of that city, my admiration
for the people who allowed us to
be down there.
"None of that can possibly
be touched."
The press also asked him
about his first experience as a
director. His first film, "Albino
Alligator," was released in 1996.
"If I learned anything, it's
that there's a lot of acting in di
recting," he said. "Every day
you're being called upon to ne
gotiate with a large group of
people, and not all of them are
actors ... You discover your ca
pacity for leadership...
"I liked it a lot. and I'm
going to do it again, probably in
a year, but I won't tell you what
[the film is]."
When Spacey left the room, so
did half of the reporters, despite
the fact that there were four
guests left in the lineup. Talk
about swimming with sharks.

A crowded boardroom at
the Crowne Plaza Hotel in
downtown San Jose, a select
group of directors, writers and
actors marching one by one to a
single podium, and an array of
reporters and photographers
from the Bay Area — they all
added to the electric atmosphere
at a press conference for the
Cinequest San Jose Film Festival.
Backers of the Cinequest
festival, which ran from Jan. 29
to Feb. 4, stressed that all of
their guests were "m?vericks" —
people who bring "inr. vation,
artistry and personal vision" to
the film industry.
They represented almost
every stage in the filmmaker food
chain, from masters like John
Schlesinger to newbie directors
struggling to win their first dis
tributor. Kevin Spacey and Barry
Sonnenfeld stood on hand to talk
about their latest movies. As each
took his turn at the podium, the
mood in the room transformed
from awestricken to skeptical to
ecstatic.
Often the members of the
press were just as entertaining as
the guests. Jan Wahl, known for
her "Talkin' Pictures ..." week
ly show on BayTV, was all smiles
in her latest blue hat. Howie
Nave of the Palo Alto Daily
News disregarded the critical
approach and asked the direc
tors about his favorite scenes.
Here are the people who
were the highlights of the after
noon:
John Schlesinger
Academy Award-winning director of
"Midnight Cowboy," "Marathon
Man" and "Far From the Madding
Crowd"
Schlesinger, an Englishman
whose directing credits date back
to the early '60s, was greeted like
a true veteran of film should be.
His "maverick" films were made
30 years ago, when their content
was considered shocking. His
"Midnight Cowboy" is the only
X-rated film to win the Oscar for
Best Picture.
He was questioned about
every aspect of filmmaking,
from filmstock preservation to

making music videos for Sir
Paul McCartney.
When asked about the state
of the movie business today,
Schlesinger pointed towards a
lack of character-driven films.
"1 think there are big block
busters that are brilliantly made,
with all the technical achieve
ment that you could wish for,"
he said. "If only they could
spend as much time and trouble
and money on the screenplay."
He praised "Good Will
Hunting" for having a "well
written script by a very young
pair of actors." He enjoyed the
fact that Matt Damon and Ben
Affleck took the college environ
ment and made it appeal to the
adult mind.
Walter Hill
Writer and director of "48
Hours," "Red Heat" and "Last
Man Standing"; producer of the
"Alien" movies
"I just got off the plane, and
they tell me you have some ques
tions," said Hill when he arrived at
the podium. Everyone laughed,
creating a comfortable setting in
which to talk about action flicks.
One brave reporter asked
him about "Trespass" and "Wild
Bill," two movies being shown at
Cinequest that didn't have the
commercial success of his other
films.
"Am 1 happy that they're
being shown? Certainly," Hill
said . "They're made to be seen,
and when they don't achieve
the widest possible audience,
there's always a degree of disap
pointment."
He was also asked whether
he would continue working
with "Tales From the Crypt," the
HBO program that he has
helped produce and direct. His
response was positive.
"It's a chance to do something
rather perverse. [On film] you rarely
get the chance to portray protago
nists who are nasty people doing
nasty things. Commercial cinema
kind of forces you to be with the
good guys."
Ron Shelton
Writer and director of "Bull
Durham," "White Men Cant
Jump," and"Tin Cup."
In the wake of "The Post
man," which floundered at the
box office, reporters were eager

to talk to the man who'd made
two successful Kevin Costner
films. A reporter told Shelton
that his direction brought out
the best in Costner's acting and
asked if they would collaborate
again.
"No plans," Shelton replied.
"That doesn't mean we won't;
there's just no plans." On bring
ing out the best in Costner, he
said, "Kevin's the most prepared
actor you can dream 0f... he
tries things he hasn't tried be
fore ... With [these two films] I
let his mean streak come
through."
Many people also ques
tioned him about the fact that
most of his movies have sports
as a theme.
"I don't even like sports that
much," he said, much to the
amusement of the press. "I don't
watch professional sports any
more ... My baseball movie was
in the minor leagues, and my
basketball movie was on the
playground, so I think the more
interesting drama is outside the
spotlight... What sports gives
us is a mythological background,
a stage, that we all understand."
Shelton said that his next
two pictures will not be sports
related, although he wants to do
a boxing movie down the road.
Barry Sonnenfeld
Director of "The Addams Fami
ly" and "Men in Black"; cine
matographer for "Miller's Cross
ing" and "Misery"
Sonnenfeld was at
Cinequest to receive a lifetime
achievement award for his mas
terful use of film and technolo
gy. He seemed very happy in his
newfound popularity.
"I love all the attention I
can get. I'm an only child of
Jewish parents, so just give me
as much ... as you can "
Sonnenfeld talked about his
next film, "The Wild Wild
West," which will star Will
Smith as Jim West and Kevin
Kline as Artemus Gordon.
"I'm a little nervous about
it, because I have this theory
that you never want two funny
people in your movie," he said.
"The reason 'Men in Black'
worked so well was because you
had Tommy Lee Jones, a straight
man, and Will Smith, the funny
guy, like Burns and Allen, or Ab

bott and Costello."
When asked about making
the transition from cinematog
rapher to director, Sonnenfeld
noted, "I discovered that direct
ing is answering questions, and
through the accumulation of
answered questions, you create
tone and style and a point of
view."
He also joked that he had taught
the Coen brothers everything
they know.
Kevin Spacey
Academy Award-winning star of
"The Usual Suspects," "Swim
ming With Sharks," "A Time to
Kill," and "LA. Confidential"
Spacey was the only guest
