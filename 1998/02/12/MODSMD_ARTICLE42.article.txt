## What the World Needs Now ... Big Deal Recording Artists Perform the Songs of Burt Bacharach 
### 
The biggest problem for famous
songwriters is their inevitable lack of
fame. Good songwriters can define a
performer's winning style and incur
the adulation of millions of fans, but
they can't make themselves known.
In the end, writers like Burt
Bacharach get no more recognition
than a cheeseball cameo in swanky spy
movies like "Austin Powers."
Bacharach should be remem
bered for more than playing the piano
for Mike Myers and Elizabeth Hurley
as they cruise through the neon-lit
streets of Las Vegas or so the album
seems to say.
Bacharach has had his share of
heavy contributions. On this album,
new bands put yet another spin on hits
like "Raindrops Keep Falling on My
Head," "(There's) Always Something
There to Remind Me" and"I Say a Lit
tle Prayer."
Although a good portion of these

songs were popularized by "Psychic
Friend" Dionne Warwick, they main
tain musical integrity when placed
into the paradigm of contemporary
rock styles.
Shonen Knife's fast-paced,
picked-up version of "Raindrops" is a
far cry from the ambling B.J. Thomas
tune, but keeps the same happy-go
lucky feel.
Splitsville performs Til Never Fall
In Love Again" with strong but mock
ing tone. The band seems to taunt its
predecessor, Warwick, by chanting
"Video killed the radio star" at the
song's end.
None of these remakes are quite as
good as the original, of course, since
most translate Bacharach's distinct
melodies to a '90s rock style interpre
tation, but this album awakens a nos
talgic curiosity which couldn't hurt if
quenched.
