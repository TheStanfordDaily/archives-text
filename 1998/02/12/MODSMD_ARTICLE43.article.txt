# Ani DiFranco
## Little Plastic Castle 
### 
Unlike Ani DiFranco's 1996 studio release "Di
late," "Little Plastic Castle" is at itsbest when the
music moves away from DiFranco's definitive neo
folk-rock sound.
The strong tracks on "Little Plastic Castle" are
innovative and unexpected, using horn sections
and strong bass / drum combos, which is not a tack
that has always worked for Ani.
It's no secret that Ani's first few albums defined
her sound through their hammer-it-home repeti
tion — precise fast strumming on an acoustic gui
tar with a layer of sung, spoken and syncopated
emotionally-packed lyrics on top. But the last few
albums like "Dilate," "Not A Pretty Girl" and even
"Out Of Range" were crafted with slick production
that drew from a wider musical spectrum.
In that sense, "Little Plastic Castle" is no
change for Ani. The album starts with the emotion
al brain-food title track, which uses a soft acoustic
guitar intro to lead into happy rock with circus un
dertones created by a backing horn section. Star
tling as it is to hear the horns, there is a precedent
for them — "Out Of Range" used heavy orchestra
tion that included horns on some tracks.
The second track on the album, "Fuel," uses an
interesting style of semi-rapped lyrics that synco
pate with the bass and drum lines that move the
song. Ani's lyrics have never shied away from diffi
cult social subjects, and "Fuel," like all of the tracks
on "Little Plastic Castle," is no different: "They were
digging up a new foundation in Manhattan / and
they discovered a slave cemetery there / may their
souls rest easy now that lynching is frowned
upon / and we've moved on to the electric chair."
"Gravel" is the only track on this album that was
previously released — on the live 1997 album "Liv
ing In Clip." Unfortunately, the studio version lacks
the energy and power of the live version. It's a bland,
over produced ballad with fair lyrics and no kick.
"Two Little Girls" is what "Gravel" tries to be.
The lyrics of both songs are about relationships, but
"Two Little Girls" combines intense emotion with su
perb musicianship. It is stylistically dynamic, with

with slow sections building into fast resolutions. Ani's
signature guitar strumming kicks in at the right mo
ments, but leaves most of the track to rest on the sub
tle bassline of her long-time sidekick Sara Lee.
The rest of the album varies in quality from ex
cellent to mediocre. On the better end are tracks
like "Deep Dish," a pseudo-ska disco groove with
fast lyrical delivery and poppy horns; "Pixie," which
layers superb lyrics over a spacey background; and
"Glass House," which melds together disparate ele
ments like wah'd electric guitar and shimmering
bells. On the other end are "Loom," "Swan Dive"
and "Independence Day," which have the standard
Ani sound and don't do anything new or 'anchor*
the album in any way.
The album ends with "Pulse," a 14-minute long
sparse groove with softly spoken lyrics. Over twice as
long as the second longest song on the album, "Pulse"
makes explicit the sounds that have influenced Ani in
the last year — such as the critically acclaimed debut
album "Trailer Park" by Beth Orton. But Ani's track
is her own, with lyrics, horns, concertina and talking
drum wending in and out of the weave.
In the hubbub of acclamation for her articulate
social awareness, people have forgotten that Ani is, at
her core, a musician. "Little Plastic Castle" seems to
be her way of reminding everyone, through both
music and lyrics: "People talk / about my
image / like I come in two dimensions / like lipstick
is a sign of my declining mind / like what 1 happen to
be wearing / the day that someone takes a picture / is
my new statement for all of womankind."
There are flaws with this album. "Fuel," Two
Little Girls," "Swan Dive" and "Glass House" all end
with the same type of distorted noisy mess. The fan
tastic tribal drumming of her previous albums is
completely lacking. And the entire thing feels a lit
tle too over-produced.
Still, this is a mature, wonderful album. Ani is a
superb composer and musician, and she shines on
"Little Plastic Castle."
