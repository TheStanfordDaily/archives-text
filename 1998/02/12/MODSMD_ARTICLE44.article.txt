# Black Lab
## Your Body Above Me 
### 
Black Lab definitely has
some of the the strongest al
terna-mainstream sounds I've
heard since the airwaves have
been clogged by the likes of
Better Than Ezra, Candlebox
and Oasis. It looks as though

Black Lab could be the next Live.
I wouldn't be caught dead buying this music,
but that doesn't mean that the release has no re
deeming characteristics or that it won't appeal
strongly to different ears.
While the music will prove to be too pre
dictable for many contemporary rock listeners,
the album flows very smoothly, and that is a sell
ing point.

If you're looking for foul language, sex or vio
lence, you've found the wrong hand. The alhum
definitely has its' share of winners. "X-Ray" is
Black Lab at its best.
On "She look" the group tries to rock out but
falls fiat on its face, sounding a lot like the open
ing act for an arena-caliber group in a desperate,
futile attempt to draw the sluggish masses from
the beer garden.
The album art is a great bonus, though. On
the cover is an
excellent Lynd Ward drawing of a black-haired
man focusing on a steam filled pipe. Inside is
powerful black and white photography by Jeffery
Newbury.
