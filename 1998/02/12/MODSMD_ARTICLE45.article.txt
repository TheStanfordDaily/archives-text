## Behan Johnson 
### 
Behan Johnson is an amalgama
tion of two very talented performers
and of many diverse styles.
Deron Johnsons backup beats and
vocals complement Monica Behan's
golden voice in a singer / songwriter
combination that soothes like a sip of
simmering stew when it's cold outside
and you're by a fire.
This self-titled debut blends blues,
jazz, funk and c folk rock feel with pop
beats and urban underground
rhythms. At times it verges on pure
pop rock, at times acid jazz — creating
a sound that is anything but mundane.
Through songs like "World Keeps
Spinning" and "Faces," Beha Johnson's
thoughtful, honest lyrics propel the
album through an emotional charge of
distress and loneliness.
Touching on the political arena
with "Nothing," a tune sung from the
perspective of a Ku Klux Klan sympa
thizer, the group seems willing and able

to tackle any issue or style of music.
Behan Johnson crosses and
merges myriad boundaries and terri
tories on this album and has found a
formula that isn't formulaic. The
group is versatile, and it shows.
Jumping from the slow and sooth
ing "This Time" to the funk-guitar
backed "Freedom Harvest," to the so
liloquizing "Someone To Call My
Own," the group manages to vary its
musical base while keeping a sound
that is recognizably Behan Johnson.
This is a group that won't easily be
swept aside among the rush of emerg
ing artists.
With so many bands trying to
push their way to the forefront of the
music industry, a unique sound is key.
Drawing from a diverse mix of musical
styles, Behan Johnson achieves this
uniqueness, proving that "eclectic" can
still mean cohesive.
