# Fly
## Bomb Threat: Before She Blows 
### 
On the off-chance that there's still an audience for cock-rock infused
grunge, Fly has graced us with "Bomb Threat: Before She Blows." As Johnny,
the eloquent front man says, "whatever comes out of us playing.. .is Fly."
Well, then I guess that would be a touch of Soundgarden, a sprinkle of Stone
Temple Pilots, a pinch of Black Sabbath and a total lack of originality. Throw in
some occasional grunting, wailing choruses, and grating guitar solos and it all
adds up to 58 minutes of nonstop, action-packed, testosterone-drenched fun!
It's not that Fly can't play its instruments, or that it doesn't try a few in
teresting twists (an acoustic, underwater-sounding "Deadline Love"; a truly
cool drum and banjo collaboration on "Dastardly Bastard"), but almost
everything has been done before.
In addition, the producers must have been so impressed with Johnny's
voice that they decided to let the vocals echo on almost every song. Not that
I'm not Johnny's biggest fan (I mean, those grunts are great!), but it does get
annoying after a bit.
But hey, maybe they can make up for all of this with their lyrics! How about
"I'm impressed and inspired to vacate this place / I'll see your ass in space."
Maybe not. If you are really into '90s nouveau arena rock a la Soundgarden
and Alice in Chains, you might find this a satisfying listen. But if you're looking
for rock to be taken to a new level, I'd wait for the next Hanson CD.
