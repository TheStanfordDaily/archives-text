## Video Killed the Radio Star "The Wedding Singer" Brings Back a Slice of the '80s 
### 
From acid-wash to Billy Idol, the real star of "The
Wedding Singer" is neither Adam Sandler nor Drew
Barrymore, but the '80s — this is a nostalgia fiesta. And
considering the glut of '70s dramas emerging from
Hollywood recently, the '80s actually feel like a breath
of spangled, fresh air through the cineplex.
Sandler plays Robbie Hart, a wedding singer with
heart. An incurable romantic, all he wants is to be the
groom at his own Journey accompanied marital ex
travaganza. But after being left at the altar, he is
doomed to endure the pain of singing Culture Club
classics at someone else's reception.
He becomes involved in the impending nuptials
of Julia, a beyond-adorable waitress played by Barry
more. Predictably, he falls for her, but Sandler's alter
nately sweet and sarcastic humor keeps the plot from
turning to saccharine.
Sandler's hallmark inflections and expressions are
present, but the bodily-function humor is missing,
making "The Wedding Singer" his most intelligent
movie yet. It is also the first Sandler vehicle to feature a
more well-developed female character, although Bar
rymore doesn't get the royal '80s treatment that the rest
of the film gets. Blue eye shadow is just not enough, es
pecially compared with the moonwalker glove, Don
Johnson jackets, and crimped hair that other charac
ters get to enjoy.
Though the movie is at times cloying in its cute
ness, for the most part it relishes the inherent humor in
returning to the time of Molly Ringwald and pegged
pants. Sandler, who when feeling happy occasionally
almost lapses into baby talk, is at his best when ex
pressing anger and frustration, especially when endur
ing his perpetual heartbreak ("Take off my Van Halen
T-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up!").
Watching a more authentic film such as "Girls
Just Wanna Have Fun" allows for unintentional period

humor, but in"The Wedding Singer," conscious
humor is just as, if not more, funny. The benefit of
looking back also allows for "Back to the Future"-
esque comments on the decade to come ("You'll be to
gether forever, just like Woody and Mia"). There's
even a Delorean, sigh.
"The Wedding Singer" is in one sense the proto
typical romantic comedy, which if not for the talents of
Sandler would be one-note at best. However, by serv
ing as a mockable time capsule as well, the movie be

comes more dynamic than its plot would predict.
1980s nostalgia can only go so far, however, and if
this too becomes a trend a la disco flicks, the saturation
point for synthesizer music could quickly he reached.
After all, there's only so much breakdancing and
Duran Duran that anyone can take. "The Wedding
Singer" stops just in time to appreciate the crimping
and feel wistful about "Miami Vice."
