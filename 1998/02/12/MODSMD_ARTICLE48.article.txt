# Not Quite a Knockout...
## But "The Boxer" Still Packs a Punch 
### 
It's common knowledge that political
unrest, used as a backdrop against a torrid
love affair, makes for quality entertainment.
Filmmakers understand this little money
making secret, so they combine violence and
passion into a seemingly effortless concoc
tion, hoping that viewers will bite.

Unfortunately, the results are not always picture perfect, as is
the case with "The Boxer." Writer-director Jim Sheridan and co
screenwriter Terry George have used the old formula, attempting
to create something meaningful. It's a bit obvious that they've
tried too hard. However, the duo has to live up to their last project
— the Oscar-winning "My Left Foot."
"The Boxer" is set in crisis-stricken Ireland, where the under
ground dealings of the IRA and shady political counter-moves are

daily affairs. A bombing across the river, a gunshot on the street
and the occasional scream in the night rattle the nerves of locals
like Danny Flynn (Daniel Day-Lewis), but are then met with apa
thetic stares and mumbling. It's an endless hell-on-earth that
draws in civilians and politicians in a way that no real war can.
In the middle of all this is Flynn, who has just been released
from 14 years of imprisonment for his dealings with the IRA.
Once he is freed, he simply wants to return to two former passions
— boxing and a lass named Maggie (Emily Watson).
Flynn inevitably runs into a couple of problems. The Belfast
boxing ring where he used to train is now a defunct gym that has
a few IRA secrets of its own. Maggie is married to his best friend,
who is still in jail, and they've had a son.
It's a powerful tale, but a bit too intense and even confusing
at times. Bloody faces and violent killings pepper the film —

scenes that tend to push the viewer away, rather than draw him or
her in.
Political motives and actions are at times unclear and then arc
never referenced to again, making for some rather unsettling
thoughts — what happened and where? Who did what and why?
Go ahead and attribute it to American nonchalance, hut film goers
shouldn't be forced to reprimand themselves for a lack of political
know-how when trying to enjoy an evening at the movies.
Despite its shortcomings, "The Boxer" comes across as a
powerful film, primarily because of the stellar performances of its
two stars. Day-Lewis has done better, but his smoldering intensi
ty and overt conviction contrast nicely with Watson's subtle, yet
moving, array of emotions.
