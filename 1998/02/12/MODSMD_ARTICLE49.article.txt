## "Night Wind Women" Commanded Its Audiences 
### 
"Look at me."
One by one and then together, the voices and bodies of
five Native-American women implore, command, and chal
lenge the audience to look and see them for who they really
are. This is the final scene of "Night Wind Women." As the
scene draws to a close, the audience sits spellbound until peo
ple find themselves rising to their feet for a standing ovation.
"Night Wind Women" is a powerful play.
There is no romanticism, no glorification of any mystical,
spiritual beliefs, no "Indians" living in "harmony with the land."
Rather, this play is about the reality of being a Native-American
woman in today's society. The power of the play comes from the
tension and healing that result from aggressively breaking
stereotypes while simultaneously affirming identities.
From the moment they enter the stage, the actresses pro
ject a strength that draws from a sense of anger. Their bright
flashing eyes and strong resonant voices fill the stuffy little
theater as they declare their presence. These women are not
polite. They are telling it like it is.
"1 won't chant for you," sneers Sassa Kitka in a poem by
Chrystos entitled "I am not your Princess."

"I admit no spirituality to you. 1 will not sweat with you
I will not wear dancing clothes," she says, voice curling
in sarcasm as she pantomimes making "Indian" frybread.
"Please don't ever again tell me about your Cherokee great
grandmother If you ever again tell me how strong I am,
I'll lay down on the ground and moan so you'll see at last my
human weakness .... I have work to do, dishes to wash, a
house to clean. There is no magic."
But then there is a passionate piece by Janice Gould, en
titled "We Exist." Or Tanya Lukin's poem, "the ground
shook," in which the narrator realizes that she does not need
her brown-eyed lover to melt her and that she can make the
ground shake by herself, create her own energy.
Look at me, the poems all seem to say. See that 1 am
human, see that I have a history, see how deeply I feel. The
women speak unhesitatingly and move deliberately. Their
eyes pierce the audience. It is almost impossible to believe
that over half of them have never acted before because the at
mosphere is so charged and intense.
The audience is motionless, and when Wendy Greyeyes
takes the stage with "You See This Body," we forget to breathe.

"Do you see this body?" she asks, sultry and mocking. "I mean,
do you see this body?... Let me tell you about these beautiful
legs .... They have ... walked across the Trail of Tears, stood
firm at Wounded Knee, squatted to give birth to all humanity
.... Oh yes... these sure are some beautiful legs."
Throughout "Night Wind Women," all types of charac
ters and viewpoints are represented, from the sensual lesbian
sentiments in "O Honeysuckle Woman" to the thoughts of a
woman sitting at her kitchen table remembering a conversa
tion with her mother in "My Mother and 1 had a Discussion
One Day."
We see that being a Native-American woman does not
mean being Pocahontas. It means being a unique individ
ual, and "Night Wind Women" is an outstanding depiction
of the individuality and unity involved in being a Native-
American woman.
"Look at me. I am not a separate woman. 1 am a contin
uance of blue sky. 1 am the throat of the Sandia Mountains. A
night wind woman who burns with every breath she takes."
â€” Minna Sandmeyer
