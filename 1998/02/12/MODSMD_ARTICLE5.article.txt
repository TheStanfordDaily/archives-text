World-renowned astronomer
and astrophysicist Frank Drake de
livered a lecture entitled "The
Search for Intelligent Life in the
Universe" to a packed crowd of
scholars, professors and community
members at Terman Lecture Hall
last night.
The talk covered subjects rang
ing from ancient Greek astrological
philosophy to blueprints for futuris
tic radio telescopes.
"I believe there is intelligent life
in outer space, and we have the
means to reach it." Drake declared.
"Life is very opportunistic. It will ap
pear in many places."

"There are many pathways to in
telligence." Drake said. Looking
within our solar system itself, he
cited bacteria found in a Martian
meteorite and ecological conditions
conducive to life beneath the frozen
surface of one of Jupiter's moons,
Huropa.
"Europa is a very spectacular
place." Drake said. "In Huropa.
there is an ocean: and if there is an
ocean, there can be life."
Drake acknowledged that in the
circumstance that an alien transmis
sion was received, ihe initial signal
would be very faint and little would
be learned from it. Ile also men
tioned the possibility of the alien so
cietv self-destructing or focusing its
technology inward. In both cases, the
outward bound signal would be ter
minated.
Estimates based on astrological
statistics find the nearest possible
civilizations to be thousands of light
years away, making a voyage to
these worlds an ambitious undertak
ing.
The fastest rockets in existence
move at a speed of 10 miles per sec
ond, Drake explained, a rate at
which the rockets would reach po
tentially populated worlds millions
of years after their launch.
In order to speed up the trip, he
showed the audience a drawing of a
rocket that required matter and anti
matter fuel to blast gamma rays from
its thruster.
The rocket would carry roughly
1,000 tons of payload and 34,000 tons
of fuel — enough to power the entire

United States for 500,000 years.
Drake added that the gamma rays
from the blast would "incinerate"
one of the earth's hemispheres.
Radio telescopes, according to
Drake, are by far the most promising
means of researching extraterrestri
al life. Project Phoenix, a joint ven
ture funded by private donors, has
taken up the reins in the search.
Since 1993, the federal government
has provided no economic aid in the
search for extraterrestrial life.
Drake made speculations as to
how possible communication with
distant worlds could be optimized.
"If their televisions are like ours," he
contemplated, "we'd need an anten
na several kilometers high."
Such an antenna is estimated to
cost roughly $2(X) million.
"The finest place to build such a
radio telescope is on the moon," he
mused. The dark side of the moon is
the only area in the solar system
which receives none of the earth's
transmissions.
Drake downplayed all insight

into possible contact with intelligent
life through UFO sightings. "We
have found nothing in the UFO data
to guide us or ever encourage us in
our searches."
When asked how he dealt with
the frustration he and other re
searchers faced after years of receiv
ing no real transmissions, Drake
said, "The only thing that keeps you
going is the knowledge that if a dis
covery is made, it will legitimize
countless hours of work."
The scientists who study extrater
restrial life are "normal people, by
the way," he joked. "They're not
crazy."
"It was a really entertaining lec
ture," said sophomore Leland
Chung. "I already believed in ex
traterrestrial life, which is the reason
I wanted to come here and talk."
"I think the most interesting thing
for me was probably how he planned
to search for signs of other life by de
tecting radio signals," said Brett
Kawakami, a graduate student in
civil and environmental engineering.
