## Gumby Penis Where's pony pal Pokey?

Let's suppose you're impo
tent.
Oh dear.
You try therapy, and maybe it
turns out that the problem isn't in
your head. The doctor recom
mends papaverine injections (as
most doctors now do), but maybe
you're afraid of needles, or maybe
you don't like the idea of four-hour
erections.
It's a good deal for those long
weekends when your roommate's
away, but quickies are out, and
forget about sex in the morning if
you plan to have breakfast or lunch
in public.
And suppose you run out of
papaverine? You can't run out and
pick it up, and carting around a kit
of chemicals and syringes just isn't
you. You need something serious,
permanent and discreet. You need
an implant.
This is a big decision. Im
plants all contain parts which go in
the corpora cavernosa, the spaces
in the penis which fill with blood
in the normal course of getting an
erection. Once something gpes in
your corpora cavernosa, you're
stuck with it. Even if you get it re
moved, the scar tissue ends all
hope of natural erections.
But if you've gotten this far,
your hope of natural erections is
probably gone already. So what
sort of toy you want?
Remember Gumby?
Your cheapest options
($6,000 - $10,000, including
surgery) are "Semi-Rigid Rods."
These are either two bendable
rods, steel wires or interlocking
plastic joints covered in silicon,
and implanted in the corpora cav
ernosa. "To prepare for inter
course," says the promotional liter
ature "the man simply bends the
penis to a 'ready' angle."
Gumby penis.
It isn't d// bad when you think
about it. Yes, it's a bit ridiculous,
but any procedure that involves
mechanizing sex is going to make
you feel a little foolish, and there's
something to be said for simplicity.
Your penis is always erect.
You can bend it any which way you
like, up or curved or slantwise, but
the there's always a stiff wire in
there and you'll be walking around
for the rest of your life with a stick
between your legs. Let's try again.
Remember Reebok pump
shoes? On the "affordable" end of
the penis-pump scale, we have the
"Self-Contained Inflatable" im
plants ($lO,OOO - $12,000). These
consist of two fluid-filled cylin
ders, each with a pump and a re
lease valve.

"A squeeze of the head of the
penis," says the brochure, "forces a
fluid transfer to the forward cham
ber, causing rigidity." When you're
done having fun, "a certain bend
of the penis" causes the fluid to
flow back into the first chamber,
"thus ending the erection."
Now, perhaps I am being
alarmist here, but ... "a certain
bend in the penis?"
Oh, let's not throw the baby
out with the bathwater — the self
contained inflatable pump might
not be the solution, but that
doesn't mean all pumps are bad.
We haven't yet looked at the Cadil
lac of implants: the "Multi-Com
ponent Inflatable" pump.
Yes, there are several parts to
this thing. Inflatable cylinders go
into the corpora cavernosa just like
the self-oontained pump, but in
this case the cylinders connect to a
fluid reservoir that goes in the ab
domen and a pump that goes in
the scrotum.
A scrotum squeeze transfers
fluid from the reservoir into the
cylinder and another squeeze re
verses the process — like a ma
chine.
Sometimes, it breaks down.
This means more surgery on top of
the $12,000 -$15,000 initial proce
dure. It seems like this type of
pump might also be prone to acci
dental deflation. Explain that to
your lover.
So maybe implants aren't for
you. You don't have $6,000 -
$ 15,(XX) to drop on the surgery and
you don't have four to six weeks to
waste while you're healing. You've
tried therapy, and you're not inter
ested in injections, but if you're will
ing to sacrifice a measure of spon
taneity, there's still one more option
for you: the "Vacuum Erection De
vice."
The Vacuum Erection Device
is a plastic cylinder which fits
around the penis. "When negative
pressure is applied," says the
brochure, "the penis becomes
rigid."
Like getting a blowjob from a
Hoover.
There are a few great advan
tages to this device. It's much
cheaper than an implant, for one
thing, and it doesn't require
surgery. Granted, it's also a bit
cumbersome, and it results in a
cold penis and less rigidity than a
normal erection, which means
you might need a little lube to ease
penetration. But considering that
the major alternative involves
paying someone large sums of
money to slice up your genitalia,
perhaps you should consider giv
ing up toys and playing with the
household appliances instead.
