# Dorms experience Lake Tahoe
## 
### Clara Kim 
In search of respite from the drudgery of school
work, many groups on campus have embarked on ski
trips this quarter. Lake Tahoe is the destination of
choice, with most groups staying in the South Lake
Tahoe area.
This year, many people were caught in an unexpect
ed snowstorm during the Martin Luther King Jr week
end. but this did not stop anyone from having a ginxi
time.
Oren Ahix>bim. a senior economics major, went on
an ATO ski trip that weekend.
"There are a couple of good-looking girls in A IX)."
Ahoobim explained
On the second day of the A 1 Oski trip, a blizzard shut
down the roads and made it necessary for about 500
skiers to stay overnight in the Kirkwixxl ski lodge cafe
teria. The lodge provided some blankets — but there
weren't enough to go around.
"There were five ol us." Ahtx>bim said, "and we just
kinda bonded and chilled. We huddled to stay warm for
our dear lives. It was quite dramatic."
Casa Italiana had a group up at Tahoe at the same
time and caught the bli/zard as well. On the last day.the
group was snowed in with dwindling food supplies.
"All we had were two lasagnas and a big thing of
rum." said senior Jean Marc Corredor.
To obtain food,Corredor and a friend bundled them
selves in ski clothes, put on their kx>ts and backpacks
and hiked one-and-a-half miles through the snow to a
nearby grocery store.
"We were helping cars along the way that had gotten

stuck," Corredor said
According to ("orredor. even after the two gave their
assistance, nobody offered them a lift. Finally, they re
ceived .1 ride with some Stanford students from another
dorm.

For those who chose to avoid
the snow, other popular activi-

ties for groups nt Lake I amx:
included watching movies.

playing video games, soaking
in the hot tub and for some,
gambling. 112

Hoping to strike it
rich, Corredor and his
housemates went to sev
eral casinos in the South
Lake lahoe area in-

cluding Harrod's,
Caesar's and Har- |
vcy's. but nolxxly |
ended up w inning.

Others took ad

vantage of the abun- 1
dant snow and fresh

powder to go skiing or
snowboarding. Ahtx>bini
tried his luck down the

black diamond runs for ex- *
pert skiicrs although he had

only skied twice before.
"It's all about no fear," he said.

Freshman Winston Choi went on

two ski trips back-to-back — one
with Okada House and another with
the Undergraduate Chinese Ameri
can Association.
"Coming from Colorado, I figure

I wouldn't be able to ski as often as 1
would back home," Choi said.
"With that in mind, I just wanted to
make the best use of every opportu
nity I got."
