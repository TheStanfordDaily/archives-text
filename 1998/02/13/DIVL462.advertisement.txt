Our country needs more leaders who understand
the realities that exist in America s urban and rural areas,
and who are committed to changing them.
Teach For America alumni are a growing force of
advocates for educational excellence and equity. While
some alumni have decided to remain in the field of
education — where they are starting schools, training
to be principals and superintendents', assuming leader
ship roles on school faculties, and directly impacting
the lives of many students every day — others have
brought ,a valuable perspective to other sectors such as
law, business, journalism, medicine, and politics.
Alumni arc influencing education policy on Capitol
Hill and in local and state governments, reporting on
educational issues for the nation s leading newspapers,
starting non-profit organizations, and working to effect
change in schools through meaningful volunteer activities.
