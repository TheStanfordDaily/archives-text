To AK CK PK ML AP KS and
JY: For all those times I stole
careless glances in admiration,
for expecting you to offer a
response with certainty, for
asking you out by e-mail, for
demystifying your existence, for
ignoring the "yeehaw" as a sign
of affection, for chemistry that
constitutes a conflict of interest,
and for Jason, I must extend
my apologies.
Will you be my Valentine?
Beautiful Mary,
I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY
SOUL. FOR YOU HAVE
OPENED MY EYES TO
ALL OF LIFE'S INFINITE
POSSIBILITIES. THE SEED
THAT YOU PLANTED IS
JUST NOW SPROUTING.
I HOPE AND PRAY THAT
WE CAN REAP ITS
HARVEST TOGETHER.
WHATEVER THE FUTURE

ALWAYS BETHERE FOR
