## 
### Zachary Roberts Senior staff writer 
Five women, four of them former Stanford I Jniversitv
students. have been awarded $3<K).(KM) in <>ne (>f the largest
settlements ever resulting from allegations of housing dis
crimination towards Asian Americans.
U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken approved the set
tlement last week by signing a consent decree, which pre
vented the case from going to trial. In their suit, plaintiffs
Dianne Chen, Teri Chew. Kim Chiu, Lori Sakoda and
( arrie I zou charged property manager Janette I lybl and
her parents — property owners Jack and Beverlee Hybl
with housing discrimination. The Hybls have since sold
the house on Eighth Avenue in Menlo Park.
In addition to the monetary settlement, the Hybls have
agreed to take training in fair housinu laws and to refrain

from violating applicable lair housing laws The consent
form also denies liability on the part of the Hvbls.
The plaintiffs contended that while she tcx>k them on a
tour of the three-bedroom house. Janette Hybl comment
ed that she had "good, white American applicants" and
"we white people need to stick together." Hybl then
chased the plaintiffs from her property yelling. "(io back
to your country" and hit their car twice.
"Our intention in filing this lawsuit is to prevent this
from happening to anyone else," said ( hew. ('lass of '97.
After contacting Stanford Community Housing Ser
vices. the women were directed to the Midpeninsula ( iti
zens for Fair Housing, a Palo Alto-based advocacy orga
nization. According to Fair Housing Specialist Pam
Thomas, the group recommended that the women hire at-
torney Scott Chang.
In August of 19%, Chang filed a
lawsuit in federal court in Oakland
on the women's behalf. Chang had
also represented IW4 Stanford grad
uates Darren Allaway and Tracy
Pruitt in a IW4 housing discrimina
tion case.
In that case, Allaway and Pruitt,
who are black, responded to a news
paper advertisement for an apart
ment in a housing complex in East
Menlo Park but were falsely told the
apartment had already been rented.
They were then discouraged from
trying to rent it. The suit was settled
for a confidential monetary
amount.
In the Allaway-Pruitt suit, the
housing organization conducted tests
to determine if housing discrimina
tion was being practiced by sending
potential white and black renters to

the apartment. In the more recent sit
uation, the apartment was rented be
fore the organization could run a sim
ilar test.
Chang said that the women's suit
was helped by the presence of a col
laborative witness.
"There was a witness in the house
at the time of the incident who didn't
hear the actual exchange. But when
Janette Hybl went back into the
house, | Hybl) told her she was sorry
|the witness] had to hear what Hybl
had said, but that it was true that they
are ruining our country,'" Chang
said.
To that end. Chew and the other
plaintiffs also attempted get the Stan
ford Community Housing Office to
remove the Hybls from their list of
available housing. Chew felt that with
litigation pending against the Hybls,
the University was not being support
ive of the students involved in the
suit. The continued posting also po
tentially allowed other students to
wind up in a similar situation.

"The C 'ommunity Il<>using ()ffice
told us that their policy was that they
needed a written letter to assist the
claim, which we wrote," Chew said.
"Once removed from the list, the
Hvbls would become permanently
banned from being listed in the ( om
munity 1 lousing Office's listings."
Several months later. Chew re
ceived a letter from the office stating
that because of changes in Hybl's
management policies of the property.
Stanford would continue to list their
property in the office.
Chew then appealed to John
Bravman, former resident fellow at
Yost House. Bravman met with then-
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds, and the 1 lybls were
dropped from the listings.
The plaintiffs were upset that the
office never notified them that the
Hybl listing had been dropped. Al
most six months after the initial inci
dent. the plaintiffs learned through a
trial disclosure that the Hybl listing
had been dropped.
