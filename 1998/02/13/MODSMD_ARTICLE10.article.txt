## Russian and U.S. officials disagree about force against Iraq 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Russia's
defense minister accused the Unit
ed States yesterday of being
"uncompromising" in dealing with
Iraq and rushing to military strikes
before diplomatic avenues are
exhausted. Defense Secretary
William Cohen termed Russia's
"so-called compromises" unlikely
to end the standoff with Saddam
Hussein.
Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev. in an unusually strong
rebuke at the opening of talks dur
ing Cohen's first visit to Moscow,
also warned that a U.S. military
strike against Iraq would harm the
two countries' post-Cold War mili
tary cooperation.
Cohen calmly took notes during
Sergeyev's 10-minute lecture, as
several aides sat motionless with
stunned looks on their faces. Nor
mally at such appearances, both
sides exchange pleasantries for the
cameras.
"Does the uncompromising and
tough stand over the situation in
Iraq help to strengthen stability in
the world? Is America ready for all
the possible consequences?"
Sergeyev quizzed Cohen, speaking
through a translator.
"Force can conquer all. but its
victory is short-lived," the defense
minister added, noting that he was
quoting Abraham Lincoln on his
birthday.
"For a military man, it is the

O
worst thing to be late, but it's also
bad to hurry too much while
assessing the situation." said
Sergeyev. who said he had first put
on the military uniform at age 17.
Cohen, a former Maine senator
who has not served in the military,
asked to respond. He noted that
Sergeyev's comments had been
captured by the Russian and for
eign news media. Even so. Russian
security guards pushed reporters
from the room before Cohen could
finish speaking.
"One should make haste slowly
and that is precisely what Presi
dent Clinton has done for the past
several months in the face of Sad
dam Hussein's tactics of delay,
deception and trickery," Cohen
said, launehing into a vigorous
defense of the administration's
position.
He said the issue was not one ol
American rigidity, but Iraqi intran
sigence. Every country that he has
visited, including Russia, on his
weeklong swing through Europe
and the Persian Gulf has said U.N.
inspectors must be allowed into
presidential sites in Iraq, the secre
tary said.
Later, Cohen described the 2
1/2-hour session as "direct and
candid," which the defense secre
tary said "came as no surprise to
me."
"We continue to disagree on the
method of achieving a shared goal

- lull compliance with U.N. Securi
ty Council resolutions." he said
Sergeyev said: "We not only lis
tened to each other, we also heard
each other."
He said he expressed his opin
ion to Cohen on "methods of com
promises" to resolve the impasse,
which he said include increasing
the si/e ol the inspection team and
diversifying surveillance flights b\
adding aircraft from nations other
than the I ! nited States.
Airborne surveillance has been
handled so far by American 12
spy planes.

President Boris Yeltsin ad other
top Russian leaders have been
highly critical of the I .S. threat to
strike against Iraq, hut this was the
first time the Russians had made
such public comments face-to-face
with a senior American official.
The Clinton administration
acknowledges that international
support lor attacking Iraq has not
reached the level of the 1991 Per
sian (iull War Many in the
Republican controlled Congress,
meanwhile, are skeptical that limit
ed airstrikes can force Saddam into
compliance with I.N. resolutions.
