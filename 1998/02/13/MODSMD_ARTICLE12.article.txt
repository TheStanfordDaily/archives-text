VATICAN CITY (AP)
Cuba announced yesterday it was
releasing do/ens of prisoners in
response to Vatican appeals, giv
ing Pope John Paul II the first
major concrete success of his his
toric pilgrimage last month to the
communist island.
Those released include some
dissidents, whose plight was under
lined by the pope s dramatic plea
in Cuba to free "prisoners of con
science."
The release was first announced
by the Vatican, which said Cuba
called it "an act of clemency and
good will in memory" ol John
Paul's five-day \ isit to the island
last month.
It was confirmed in Havana by
the Cuban government, which said
dozens of prisoners were in the
process til being freed and more
than 2(H) soon would be.
The names of the prisoners
freed were not released, and it was
not immediately clear how many
were political prisoners.
Human rights groups say that
Cuba holds at least 500 political
prisoners.
During his trip to the ( aribbean
island, John Paul pushed lor
expanded freedom and tried to

pave the way for the Roman
Catholic Church to play a greater
role in Cuban society after nearly
four decades of communism.
The Vatican specifically pre
sented a list of several hundred
prisoners, including dissidents,
gathered from families and human
ritihts organizations.
Cuban Foreign Ministry
spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez
said I Ob of them "were already at
liberty. Several dozen more soon
will be put at liberty through a par
don. which is in the process of
being applied."
He said still others will be par
doned in line with a Vatican
appeal for clemency for other pris
oners not on Vatican lists.
Those were "justified from a
humanitarian view, for reasons of
age, health or other similar circum
stances" and included both com
mon criminal and political cases.
In ( 'üba. opposition leaders and
relatives of imprisoned dissidents
waited to learn who was being
freed.
"We are waiting very close
beside the telephone," said Cierar
do Sanchez, a member of the
Cuban Commission of Human
Rights and National Reconeilia

tion. which monitors and docu
ments political jailings in Cuba.
"Even a single case is good
news for us," Sanchez said by tele
phone from Havana.
In his public appeal in Cuba for
the release of "prisoners of con
science." John Paul asked that they
be allowed to remain on the island,
not expelled as in past cases.
"It would be a gesture which
honors the authority promoting
it."he said during a stop at a shrine
outside Havana.
The Vatican saw the releases as
a victory for John Paul.
"The pope's request for the
release of numerous prisoners is
accepted." said Vatican Radio.
Jorge Gomez, whose brother
Rene was imprisoned last summer,
greeted news of the releases with
joy.
"I have to suppose my brother
will be one of (those released)
because he is among the four most
prominent" political prisoners.
Gomez said, also by telephone
from Havana.
Rene Gomez was arrested with
three other leading dissidents for
criticizing a draft plan for the
Cuban Communist Party's fifth
Party Congress.
