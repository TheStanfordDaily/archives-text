Line-item veto unconstitutional
A federal judge threw out President ( linton's new
line-item veto authority yesterday, delivering a blow
to a power both Clinton and the Republican Congress
said was crucial for limiting wasteful spending. A deci
sive ruling by the Supreme Court seems likely in the
next few months.
U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan said the line
item veto, enacted in IWi and used for the first time
last year, unconstitutionally shifted power to the pres
ident from the Congress. The measure allows the
president to kill individual items in tax and spending
bills that otherwise become law. though he can be
reversed by two-thirds majorities of the House and
Senate.
Clinton, who called for line-item veto power dur
ing his IW2 presidential campaign, said the law has
worked well, saving taxpayers more than SI billion.
Snow boarder keeps gold medal
When the smoke cleared. Canada's Ross
Rebagliati had his gold medal back.
A day after losing the medal because lie tested pos
itive for marijuana, the snow boarder won it again yes
terday — not b\ beating his competitors, but b\ con
vincing an appeals panel that the rules don't cover pot.
The Court for Arbitration of Sport said that the
International Olympic Committee had no agreement
with the International Ski Federation on marijuana
use, and thus had no right to strip Rebagliati of his
medal.

"It's purely the legal issue. It's not our role to
examine the social issues at this stage." said Jean
Philippe Rochat. secretary general of the ( AS. "It's a
clear message that it the international sports bod>
wants such rules, it has to specify clearK that marijua
na is a forbidden substance."
Hie panel's decision was unanimous. Rcxrhat said.
It cannot be appealed. Rebagliati insisted that he
hadn't smoked pot since last April and that he must
have inhaled secondhand smoke during a going-awa\
party in Canada last month
