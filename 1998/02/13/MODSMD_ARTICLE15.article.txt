Celebrate Valentine's Day
with candy hearts and
scratch-and-sniff stickers

Tomorrow is the oft
lamented Valentine's Day — a
day about materialism. Sweet
hearts must treat significant others to
candy, gifts or dinner, and single peo
ple feel obligated to buy manufactured
cards for their friends or families.
Hi is year 1 found myself lamenting
the corporatization of Valentine's Day.
We've lost our innocence. Wasn't it
only yesterday that we passed out
valentines to all the other first graders?
But perhaps we never had any inno
cence. Yes. we gave valentines to all
the other kids. Everybody got a card
without discrimination on the basis of
gender, popularity or cootie count. But
we weren't blind to those differences. 1
saved the good valentines for my pals
and gave the bad ones to people who
were mean or annoying.
I used to sort the valentines into
classes and decide who deserves what.
"Rachel is my good friend, so she gets
the card that says"I like you' with little
bunnies on the front. But Steve is
vucky, so he gets 'Have a good day'
with a picture of a skunk.
I'm not the only guilty one. John
Keating, a boy in my first-grade class,
put scratch-and-sniff stickers on his
valentine envelopes. The boys got bub
ble gum and cherry and the girls got
stickers smelling like peanuts and air
freshener. Maybe the nasty smelling
scratch-and-sniff stickers are for the
John Keatings of this world, who have

to give something to the girls.
And what about the critical ques
tion of valentine selection? You go to
the drugstore with a parent and sali
vate over the cardboard displays of
valentines with pictures of superheroes
and commercial toys. As if the Trans
formers were the perfect messengers
for a holiday celebrating love.
My parents may have refused to buy
mass-produced valentines, but I didn't
escape the grasp of material culture. 1
was just jealous of the other kids who
gave out Strawberry Shortcake and
Care Bears valentines.
Where does this leave us poor
media children? Are we doomed by
buying into commercial culture? Are
we subliminally indoctrinated to spew
platitudes like "Be mine" and "You're
special"? Probably so, unless we were
raised on communes in Montana.
But I'm okay with that. After all,
there aren't many constants in life, and
at least the commercial Man has
always been watching over us. It's like
having a recurring nightmare.
Besides, we can all rebel. We can
give home-baked cookies instead of
Godiva chocolates. We can make
messy cards out of paper stolen from
our computer clusters' printers. Or we
can just say something honest instead
of having Hallmark do it for us.
Some might still want the candy, the
tlowers and the sappy cards. And that's
fine, as long as we know how to work
the system well enough to get what we
want. 1 may be a mass-produced media
child, but I can't help it if I still love
cherry-smelly stickers.
