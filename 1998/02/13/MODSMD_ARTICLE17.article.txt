## Ujamaa speaks openly on race 
### 
SOMETHING spe
cial happened in
Ujamaa last
Wednesday. Perhaps the
usual house meeting
would not seem exciting to
the average Stanford stu
dent. but this was not the
average house meeting.

For someone who has always lived in a
world dominated by the presence of race
and ethnicity, conversations about race
seem as common as bike accidents in White
Plaza. By the time I was IS. 1 had begun to
get bored with these so-called life-changing
"race dialogues."
I hev always seem the same — a group of
politically correct people would gather in a
room, denounce racism, proclaim to be
prejudice free and pledge allegiance to a
colorblind world. Then everyone would get
up and leave with a self-satisfied look on his
or her face.
The next morning I would wake up, sure
that my racially divided world would
become the American stir fry that we had
spoken 01. But somehow, things never
changed. For all the dialogues, conversa
tions and conlerences on race I had attend
ed. not one seemed to deliver the results I
had so earnestly hoped for.
I rue. I became a bit disillusioned with
this whole race matter. Maybe we just
weren't meant to get along. Maybe we were
all different for a reason. Perhaps Ciod had
colored lis different colors as a kind of
warning that we should stay away from each

other. I mean, judging by our actions, that's
what most of America seems to believe.
Even at Stanford, in this bastion of polit
ical correctness, I rarely see different races
make an attempt to unite. So can you blame
me for losing hope? Yes. You see, last
Wednesday night in Drake lounge, I saw
hope. It came to my house meeting as 50
Ujamaa residents gathered to talk about the
tension and division within our house. For
two hours, we conducted a true dialogue.
Not because we had to or because our resi
dent assistants made us. but because we
wanted to dissolve whatever tension histor
ically existed at Ujamaa.
Due to past racial tension. Ujamaa had
become a divided house — two communi
ties living under one roof. Many non-black
residents had developed a sense of alien
ation from the Ujamaa community. The
tension resulted in self-segregation in many
dorm activities, and all residents felt a lack
ol the unity essential to any community.
Alter all. "Ujamaa" does mean "unity."
That night. I saw Ujamaa residents do
something 1 had never seen before — talk
to each other. No. not talk about each
other, or talk above each other — we talked
honestly and frankly TO each other. We
discussed our problems and solutions with
each other — about the divisions among
groups in the house and how we could get
along better.
As I sat in the meeting, my mind wan
dered back to all the dialogues I had attend
ed in the past. There was always something
missing that made unitv an actual reality.

Hut that night in Ujamaa. I felt that every
thing was in place. As a group, we came up
with concrete solutions to help unify our
house. We agreed to the open-door policy,
planned hall events and made a conscious
effort to be more open.
Why? What was different about the Uja
maa residents from everyone else in this
world? rhen I realized: The people in IJja
maa really wanted to get along. They had a
vested interest in getting along with their
housemates regardless of culture, race or
class differences. Political correctness was
not involved here, just an honest will to
make our house a more unified place to
live.
As we left the meeting to watch South
Park (nothing like a little Mr. Hanky to
unify a house), I wondered why 50 college
students could have a true dialogue and the
rest of the world seemed unable to rise
above petty differences and political cor
rectness. I don't know the answer to that,
but I can assure you that if everyone else
could learn to be as honest and willing to
make changes as the residents of Ujamaa,
then our world could be a lot better.
So Stanford, I challenge you — have a
true dialogue with the members of your
community. Shed the politically correct jar
gon and find the will to make our Stanford
community a more unified one.
