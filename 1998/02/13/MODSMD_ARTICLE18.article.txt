Stanford should learn
from Cireek Row history
Ihe Daily's Jan. 15 edition carried a
front-page article entitled "Sororities on the
Row: Part II." It was well researched and
well written by one of your contributing
writers. It contained, however, statements
that misrepresented and misquoted my
views as an "old grad" (Class of '42) from
the days when sororities were housed on
campus.
Since I hold these views strongly and
would like them to count as campus debate
on this issue continues. I want to make
myself absolutely clear: sororities did then,
and do now. often choose members in
undemocratic ways inappropriate to Stan
ford University.
Are we to redress one form of discrimi
nation (gender inequity) by accepting
another as distasteful if not more so —
namely, discrimination based upon racial.
L'thnic and social factors?
And how about the issue of "fair hous
ng?" Should social clubs with discriminato
ry practices really be granted the impri
matur of University housing?
Why not have all Greek societies fulfill
heir fellowship needs not in campus resi
lences but in clubhouses provided for them

on campus, much like the eating clubs of the
old days? Did the task force seriously con
sider this option?
Finally, I definitely do not "applaud this
recent decision that will allow sororities to
once again occupy Row houses." The resur
rection of a (ireek Row at Stanford is
repugnant to me and I will deeply regret its
coming to pass.
I call upon the task force to rethink its
decision. Most of the great private universi
ties do not have Greek Rows. Stanford is
not, alter all. Southwest Winsocki Universi
ty-
Are role models such as Sen. Diane l ein
stcin and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to
be replaced by Betty Coed?
Is Sally Ride to morph into a Barbie doll
with a (ireek pin on her sweater? Surely
not.
In conclusion, I understand that Stanford
women are now a much larger and more
diverse group, most of whom do not care
about sororities.
I his is great. Yet if they ignore this issue
and wake up one morning to find a Greek
Row in their front yard, representing an
affront to much that they hold fine about
Stanford, they will live to see themselves
fighting the battle of the "4()s all over again.
Can we learn from history?

Conservatism still alive
and well on The Farm
It is rather sad when an eloquent writer
such as Mr. Babbitt loses his rational facul
ty. In his column on The Stanford Review,
(Feb. 12) his writing degenerates into
unfounded and ineffective personal accusa
tions and absurd babbling.
Mr. Babbitt's acidic criticism of the cur
rent state of The Stanford Review is illegiti
mate and inaccurate not only about the
paper and its staff writers but also in his
assessment of the current situation at Stan
ford.
Mr. Babbitt claims that The Review is
running out of things to say because "Stan
ford has become one ol the most blandly
conservative places on this planet." Mr.
Babbitt himself clearly realizes the fallacy of
that statement, as he follows it with the sen
tence, "A left-leaning humanities depart
ment or two and the ethnic theme dorms
and cultural community centers don't
change this fact."
I suppose the lack of active communist
organizations on campus qualifies this
school as being conservative.
Mr. Babbitt also wrongly implies in his
column that the sweeping trend ol political
correctness and multiculturalism is a thine

ot the past. On the contrary, if Mr. Babbitt
cares to look around the campus just a little
more carefully and with a little more ratio
nality, it is clear that the tide of PC" and mul
ticulturalism is higher than ever on this cam
pus.
For example, last year's cultural literary
test of the Stanford's upperclass students,
conducted by The Stanford Review, clearly
showed evidence of cultural illiteracy
among Stanford students when it came to
their knowledge of the Western civilization
hardly a sign of the retreating specter of
PC and multiculturalism. The great tradi
tions that had once shaped the identity of
Stanford students are long gone and show
no sign of coming back.
Now. even the tenure system is under the
attack ol political correctness and multicul
turalism. And let us not even mention the
ethnic centers, the Women's Center, theme
dorms, LtiBCC, and of course, the "left
leaning humanities department or two."
I am afraid that it was Mr. Babbitt's per
sonal dislike of certain members of The
Review staff that blinded his rational judg
ment and motivated him to write a column
of such poor caliber. True, not all Review
stall members are crowd-pleasers, nor do
they intend to be. What they are best at,
however, is directly delivering the rational,
"right" messages to the Stanford communi
ty. I he messages are rarely subtle; often the

right messages have the subtlety of a briek
on the forehead because they tend to break
the complacency.
However, while Mr. Babbitt is wrong
and misled about many things in his column
— including his abominably superficial
understanding of Adam Smith's "Invisible
Hand" — he is right about the fact that The
Review is destined to disappear.
Termination of The Review would mean
that there is indeed no more "right" mes
sage for us to deliver, which would mean the
end of the political correctness and of the
era of multiculturalism.
I he Review and its staff are convinced
that such a day will eventually come, and
only then will we be content and rest happi
ly. In a sense, therefore, The Review is
fighting a losing war — it is essentially fight
ing for its own death. But until then. The
Review and its staff will not rest easily; there
are still many battles to be fought.
