Till'. MAN kNP.I-.l Son theconcrete floor,his
wizened hands turned up to some deity hidden
in the sky. He is a shadowed man, a skeletal
man. His face looks old. hut starvation makes even
six-year-olds look ancient.
There are people praying in Baghdad, says ( NN.
They have been praying there every day. hut the ton
tent of this man's prayers might now be changing
made more desperate in light of the recent threats ol
war made by a unified Anglo-American front.
If the United States and Britain, demanding rclri
hution for the Iraqi government's refusal to permit
unencumbered chemical weapons inspections,
declare war they will be punishing the Iraqi people.
Russia has pushed lor a diplomatic compromise. I he
United States and Britain are willing ... provided
Iraq gives in to all of their demands.
"Whether there is a diplomatic solution or not is
entirely up to Saddam Hussein." said President Clin
ton. entrusting the fate of the praying people to the
hands of a leader who has used chemical weapons on
his own countrymen.

"It is dilticult lor us to see â€” and for me to see.
quite frankly how diplomacy, unless it is backed up
by at least the threat of force, is ever going to work
and succeed,'' added British Prime Minister lon\
Blair.
"We should bomb to dust the Iraqi weapons site*
we know about. There would be no need to inspect
them then." summarized USA Today reader R. Barry
Crook in a letter to the editor.
There are people praying in Baghdad today. With
the threat of bombing some lour days away, it might
seem that they'd pray for redemption. I he (iull War.
after all. showed them the cold hands, vacant eyes and
lifted souls of l20.(H)(tof their children and grandpar
ents. Saddam Hussein, author of the human rights
abuses that the American Desert Stormers protested
so violently, was not among those casualties. Instead,
he crowded his people into Ins palaces, protecting
himself with human shields.
In IWI the United States went to war with Iraq
purportedly because Saddam Hussein had decided to
annex part of Kuwait. That he also captured a large

share of the oil resources coveted by our philanthrop
ic country was the actual cause of our mission.
"I think the important thing is that you know that
I don't want this |war]. Nobody wants this " Clinton
said But the I S must "confront the new hazards of
chemical and biological weapons, and the outlaw
stales, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to
acquire them."
Clinton failed to mention that the United States,
through the I'Mts. exported these same chemical
weapons to terrorist Hussein (then our ally). "We ve
got to make sure (Hussein) complies one way or
another," Blair repeated Crook mused. "We should
keep bombing anything we think might Ik- a problem
until Saddam Lis U.S. inspectors back on site. If it
means a few innocent Iraqis die, well, better them
than us."
I here are people praying in Baghdad today we
see them on ABC. NBC and CBS. Hiey've been
praying for seven years when we haven't been watch
ing quite so closely. The casualties of the last Persian
(lull War are overshadowed by the specter of more

than 1.2 million Iraqi children estimated to have died
as a result of I J. N.
Medicines lor cancer treatment are unavailable
although cancers have increased five-fold since the
(iull War. More than 4.sM)children under the age ol
five are dying each month from hunger and disease
a siX' li >ld increase in the mortality rate for that age
group. Saddam Hussein, of course, is still well led.
Both the military and economic strategies used
against Iraq in the past have failed to check the
malevolence ol Saddam Hussein I lies have succeed
ed. of course, in constructing him as a virulent mega
lomaniacal enemy a few million innocent liaqis
were the only casualties.
There are people praying in Baghdad perhaps
because they know that war is not just televised news
accounts of bombs over Baghdad fourth of Julv
fireworks in mid-February. 1 hey prayed as they lived
and died through 4X days of bombing seven years ago.
and they have prayed through seven vears of hunger
and untreated illness.
Who is responsible for the rape of justice in Bauh

dad' Saddam Hussein, the I Inited Nations. Britain
the I nited Stales. %c. who arc not the victims of the
pillage, have played power politics with the lives of 1.2
million children
People are praying in Baghdad today, with a
resolve that somewhere (ItxJ. if not his pretenders,
will care to listen soon According to the Clinton-
Mlair method of preventing death and dying, the
means need not justify the ends
"It's their country their leader and their decision
I el them live with the consequences ol their decisions
and their leader s actions." Crook concluded. "Let's
get on with making the world safer "
(ienocide may still Ix- immoral, but CNN isn t
forcing us to see what it looks like l or a is certain
thai some expression other than hope will flicker
across an old man's face on I eh 17 as he realizes lhat
in the world in which he lives, either humanity is irrel
evant. or ( kkJ is dead.
