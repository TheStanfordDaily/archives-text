LOS ANGELES â€” Despite
blowing a 15-point second-half lead,
the No. 14 Stanford men's basketball
team (20-3, 9-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) outlasted No. 1 ) lIC I A 84-81 it
Pauley Pavilion, marking the first
time the Cardinal has swept its sea
son series since the 1989-90 season.
The win secures sole possession
of second place in the Pac-10 for
Stanford and also breaks the team's
trend of timid and passive play as of
late.
"To work the lead like we did and
get up and then have UCLA come

back so strong, I think it would have
been really tough on us not to have
won that game," said ( ardinal head
coach Mike Montgomery.
"For us to come out and get this
on the road in this stretch that we're
in right now just means a ton to these
kids and to us. A lot of people were
starting to question us and to come
out and beat UCLA at their place, it
was a great win. It doesn't happen a
lot for anybody."
The Cardinal exploded against
the Bruins (IK-5. K-4). After UCLA
jumped out to a 15-5 lead, the ( ardi
nal fought its way back for a 40-35
advantage.
