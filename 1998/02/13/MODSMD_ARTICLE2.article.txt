### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Despite
blowing a 15-point second-half lead,
the No. 14 Stanford men's basketball
team (20-3, 9-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) outlasted No. 1 ) lIC I A 84-81 it
Pauley Pavilion, marking the first
time the Cardinal has swept its sea
son series since the 1989-90 season.
The win secures sole possession
of second place in the Pac-10 for
Stanford and also breaks the team's
trend of timid and passive play as of
late.
"To work the lead like we did and
get up and then have UCLA come

back so strong, I think it would have
been really tough on us not to have
won that game," said ( ardinal head
coach Mike Montgomery.
"For us to come out and get this
on the road in this stretch that we're
in right now just means a ton to these
kids and to us. A lot of people were
starting to question us and to come
out and beat UCLA at their place, it
was a great win. It doesn't happen a
lot for anybody."
The Cardinal exploded against
the Bruins (IK-5. K-4). After UCLA
jumped out to a 15-5 lead, the ( ardi
nal fought its way back for a 40-35
advantage.

The biggest factor was the play of
wingmen Peter Sauer and Kris
Weems, who more than made
amends for their combined 2-15
shooting performance against Con
necticut last Saturday.
Sauer and Weems led the ( ardi
nal in scoring with 23 and 21 points,
respectively. They hit 18-of-30 from
the lield and 6-of-ll from three
point territory.
And both came up huge when the
team needed them to do so.
The two combined to score the
( 'ardinal's first 10 points of the game,
and it was Suaer's b-for-7 shooting
performance in the first hall that
helped the team regroup after the
Bruins' fast start. He scored four
points in Stanford's 8-0 run to go into
the break.
Weems came up even bigger in
the second half.
With the game tied at 75 and |ust
over two minutes left, he hit a three
pointer as the shot clock expired to
put the Cardinal back on top.
"Sweeping UCLA ... that's a
huge thing for us." Sauer said. "We
have four starters in the junior class
and we've never even won here [at
Pauley], so it's a he deal to sweep
UCLA.
"They way they were pressing,
they had a lot of momentum and
some guvs just had to step up and hit
shots. We went through a stretch
where we had some tough shots that
weren't going down, so we steeped
up and we made the shots v\e needed
to win."
"The win was a complete turn

around compared to most of the
team's recent performances. I hcv
hit 51 percent of their shots from the
field and 46 percent from behind the
arc. a marked improvement from
their 31-percent performance
against ( onnecticut.
Of course, they still needed a little
help.

With the loss, the Bruins are all
but out of contention for their
fourth-straight conference title, es
pecially with frontrunner Arizona
still undefeated in Pac-l()play.
All that Stanford needs now is
for the Wildcats to slip up against
another opponent and it's right
back in the hunt.
But for now. sweeping UCLA is
more than enough.
The Bruins did go down fight

ing. Trailing 70-55 with N:11 left to
play, they used a 15-0 run to erase
the Cardinal lead and put them
selves back into the game.
During that span, UCLA used
an overwhelming press to force
Stanford out of its rhythm. The
Bruins ended the night with 15
steals, the most by any Cardinal op
ponent this year.
UCLA was able to control the
inside game, with center JR Hen

derson scoring a game-high 26
points inside the paint. The Cardi
nal's starting big men. Madsen and
center Tim Young, were unable to
contain Henderson and didn't have
much more luck at the opposite end
of the floor.
But with the two having an off
night, freshman power forward Jar
ron Collins stepped up big.
Collins had 12 points and six re
bounds in 18 minutes, giving the

team a much-needed boost down
low. He also contributed at the
other end of the court with two
blocks and a steal.
Collins wasn't the only rookie
contributing. Freshman point Mike
McDonald took over for Lee when
the starter got his second foul mid
way through the first half and his
fourth foul early in the second. Mc-
Donald showed more control than
he usually had. putting up the kind

of performance that impressed
everyone against the Bruins on Jan.
17 at Maples. He had two points
and three rebounds while dishing
out a pair of assists.
Hut the game was eventually de
cided by the outside shooters.
While the Cardinal wingmen lit it
up. the Bruin guards faltered.
UCLA's starting backcourt of
Bailey and freshmen Baron Davis
and Earl Watson were a combined

1 l-of-29 from the field, and a pitiful
0-9 from dow ntow n
"1 think we made Toby take a lot
of jump shots and Kris Johnson
take a lot of jump shots and I think
that helped us." Weems said. The
win "means a lot to us. to me espe

Connecticut and in this game, to
