Last night's matchup between
the top two teams in the Pacific 10
Conference was everything a game
pitting No. 1 against No. 2 should he

And that's when the sixth
ranked Stanford women's basket
ball team (14-5, 10-1 Pac-10) turned
up its defense, set fire to its offense
and romped all over IJCLA (14-7.
9-3) for a 105-81 win at Maples
Pavilion.
I hat's when the crowd began
paying more attention to senior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard's three
point count and sophomore Milena
Flores' acrobatic drives than the
score. And it's also when things just
seemed to head south for the Bru
ins.
"We'd guard Vanessa," UCLA
coach Kathy Olivier said only half
jokingly when asked what she'd do
differently in the game. "We let her
get too many good looks at the bas
ket. They really exploited our de
fense tonight."

Nygaard abused the Bruin de
fense all night, setting up in the open
spots and draining her shots for a ca
reer-high 32 points. Nygaard also
notched a career milestone, tying
Jennifer Azzi as the sch(xil's record
holder for three-pointers made in a
career.
Nygaard's 6-of-10 shooting per
formance from behind the arc (11 of
17 from the field) was good enough
for 191 on her career. Nygaard also
holds the career record for three
point attempts.
"I think that's my life high," Ny
gaard said of her 32 points. "I was
getting shots and a lot of teams
we've played against haven't let me
get shots. I would credit our passing.
We're getting some open looks."
Not only was Stanford getting
the open looks, but for the most part
it was draining every one of them.
The Card shot 58 percent from the
field against a UCLA team that has
held Pac-10 opponents to just 40
percent all season.
"We get high-percentage shots,"
Nygaard said. "We get the ball in
side. I'm a three-point shooter, but I
don't think I take that many bad
threes. I don't think people take bad
shots. We pride ourselves on taking
good shots, and that's why we win
games."
Another reason for the Cardi
nal's success has been the improved
play of the backcourt. namely Flo
res. The Pac-lOassist leader showed
the Bruins that she can do a lot more
than pass, tying her career-high with
18 points on 6-of-8 shooting.

"Flores did some things she
didn't do to us the first time
around," Olivier said. "Stanford
picked it up (late in the game): Flo
res looked to attack more."
Flores made enough dazzling
plays to fill an entire highlight reel
with everything from the left-hand
ed scoop shot to hanging and twist
ing and double-clutching the ball in

the air before letting it sail smoothly
into the net.
Teams "can't just put somebody
on her. and that's the end of our
team." Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer said of Flores. "Early in
the season that's what people were
doing. They would just stick some
