Alter playing five of their first
seven matches at home, the Stanford
men's volleyball team play two away
games this weekend against difficult
road opponents.

(2-3.1-3). 7 p.m.
■ Sunday:Stanford at Cal State

The sixth-ranked ( ardinal (5-0.4-

tion) first travels to lOth-ranked UC-
Santa Barbara (2-3. 1-3) tonight be
fore moving on to play Cal State-
Northridge (2-4, 0-4) Sunday. Stan
ford is currently second in the
MPSF's Pacific Division, one-half

game behind fourth-ranked Hawaii.
Moth UCSB and CS-Northridge are
members of the MPSF's Mountain
Division, and consequently, will onlv
face off against Pacific Division op
ponents once this season. Hawaii has
already defeated both schools.
"We feel we need to beat both
schools this weekend." said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves, "So that
we can keep pace with 1 iawaii."
Stanford's matches have become
progressively more difficult as the
season has moved forward, and
tonight's match will definitely be a
challenge for the Cardinal. Although
UCSB has only defeated one MPSF
opponent. San Diego State, tonight's
match will be a challenge.

(.583) and third (.582). respectively,
nationally in hitting. Additionally.
Hoffman is ranked fifth nationally in
blocking (2.<K)). As a team. Stanford
is fifth in the nation in hitting (.356).
For the C iauchos. it will be essential
to stop the quick attack of Stanford's
middle bk>ckers.
UCSB's lineup will likely be a sur
prise for the Cardinal right up until
game time. The (iauchos' top hitter.

satility, UCSB can give their lineup
several different looks. Darner's hit
ting is good enough to place him
fourth in the nation (.494), just be
hind Hoffman and Whitehurst.
CS-Northridge has overcome
some great obstacles to even field a
team this year. Last year, men's vol
leyball. along with four other men's
sports, was cut from C'S-Northridge's

program. It was reinstated for this
year, but not before damage was
done. Junior setter Daniel Fisher
now starts for Pacific, because he
transferred while CS-Northridge's
program was in turmoil. Some other
players transferred, and the instabili
ty affected the school's recruiting.
CS-Northridge is a school that is
definitely better than their record.
They have been able to hand the
Cardinal losses in two of the past
three years.
The Matadors are led by their top

hitter, senior outside hitter and two
time Ail-American ('had Strickland.
Strickland is in the top ten on six ("S-
Northridge career charts, including
kills, total attempts, digs, bkx'k as
sists. aces, and total blocks. Addi
tionally. Nieves considers him "a
phenomenal athlete."
The rest of the Matador lineup is
somewhat of a mystery, as most of
the players have little previous expe
rience. Strickland is the premier
player and the Cardinal will have
their hands lull with him.
