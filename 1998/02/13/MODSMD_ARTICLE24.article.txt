On Saint Valentine's Day
Sunshine Happysticks
Love is like people; it's the vari
ety that makes it so special. Every
day I encounter a new form of love a
new way to connect myself to my
surroundings. Love has more flavors
than Snapple, and you can enjoy it
more ways than drugs.
For instance, when 1 say, "I love
carrots," I don't mean that in the
same way as, "I love my girlfriend,"
or, "I love my dog." The love I refer
to is a deep, sensuous and profound
ly erotic love. I really love carrots.
In me, desire and root vegetables
become one. The feel of a carrot
between my fingers makes my eyes
roll. Their color makes me sweat.
I can barely control myself in the
grocery store. I tremble before the
vegetable section. The sight of car
rot upon carrot is unbearable. Some
times I tentatively stroke one until
the guilt forces my hand behind my
back. Sometimes I lean over and
smell them, but only for a while.
Clearly these feelings 1 have for
carrots are very different from the
feelings I have for my wife. I love my
wife in the sense that she tastes deli
cious with tomato ketchup for
breakfast. Now clearly this is not the
same love I feel for carrots (Oh Car
rots! Carrots! God release me!). It is
a less passionate love and a more
practical one. But it is love all the
same, and it's few men who can say
they still love their wives after two
minutes in the microwave.
I love movies by Oliver Stone -
this is another kind of love. I love
them like the desert loves the sun. I
love them like the starving love
famine. I love them like cows love
steak. In other words, when 1 see an
Oliver Stone movie I either run away
as fast as 1 can or, if I'm tied to a
chair, I poke out my eyes with a
fork. The love I feel for Oliver Stone
movies is quite quite different from
my love for carrots or my wife. 1
despise him and 1 hate his movies. 1
love Oliver Stone in the sense that 1
want to kill him. 1 want to love him
over the head with a crowbar. No
amount of carrots can settle me after
one of his infernal movies.
My love for my dog is a platonic
one. It is a relationship based on
absolute trust and admiration, a
bond that transcends the physical, a
meeting of souls. My feelings for the
dog are perfectly respectable despite
what people say. Sure, maybe we get
a bit close when we're romping
around the park, and maybe 1 buy
her drinks in bars, and put my arm
around her. 1 love my dog for the
companionship she provides and
nothing more. That time in the car
never happened, and the other time
doesn't count because we were both
drunk.
T hen there's the love of God for
his creation. That love is uncondi
tional on the condition that you
obey his will and worship him. Oth
erwise, you go to hell.
Chairs, sunsets, remote controls,
my pelican, bathtubs, trains, George
I, George 11, not George 111, but def
initely George IV, left shoes, heart
surgery, these are things I love. I
don't love bicycles, however. When I
see bicycles I have to think carrots.
It's the only way I can stay in con
trol.
I love so much, I can barely list
what 1 love, let alone the ways.
I love you all. I wish there was a
way you could know how much. I
want to wrap my arms around the
whole world. Hut perhaps I'm not
making myself clear, Love is like the
end of 2001; it's incomprehensible,
even when you've read the book.
Perhaps that all that can be said
is that love is good with peas, grows
in the ground and rhymes with par
rot. Love is not something you can
demand but something you put in a
casserole.

A Human Skull Remembers
by A Human Skull
In many ways, my
acting career began the
day 1 met Sir Laurence
Olivier in London, 1949,
shortly after he had won
the Academy Award for
"Hamlet". A rakish young
bootblack, I delighted
Olivier with tall tales and
ribald songs every after
noon as I polished his
brogues. We dined togeth
er a number of times in
the colorful pubs of the
West End. 1 will never forget what he told me on one of
these occasions: "Human Skull," he said, in his inim
itable way, "acting has taken me all over the world.
But I will never forget where I came from. And nei
ther should you."
I never did. What's more, I had found my calling.
I landed my first role three months later, as Skull of
Yorick in the traveling production of "Hamlet." That
show took me all over Western Europe, and I stuck with
it for a record six years. I continued to act on stage
until 1966, when 1 decided it was time to head for Hol
lywood. Just a starry-eyed young human skull, I
stepped off the bus at Hollywood and Vine with only a
suitcase and a dream.
I'd read Arthur C. Clarke's novel, "2001: A Space
Odyssey," years earlier and was thrilled to hear Stanley
Kubrick was making a film adaptation. I had to win a
part in it. I called Kubrick day and night until he gave
me my first starring movie role, as Proto-Hominid
Skull One in the Dawn of Man sequence. How I loved
that role! The only downside was the fact that it took
four hours every morning for the makeup artists to
apply the elaborate foam rubber prostheses that trans
formed me from a human skull into a primitive apelike
skull. But it was worth it, and I will always be grateful
to Stan for giving me my big break.
I acted in a number of films in the early 70's,
including the classic film "The Godfather." I* had a
touching scene where I played baseball with Don Cor
leone. Unfortunately, my part was left on the cutting
room floor. But that's show business! My next major
appearance was in Francis Ford Copoola's masterpiece
"Apocalypse Now." That production was easily the most
challenging and arduous I have ever experienced, but
it was immensely rewarding. I actually played two
roles: Mounted on a Stake Skull Four and Top of the
Bone File Skull Two. And I played them to the hilt.
But success came with a heavy price. I started
shooting up on heroin, and quickly my reputation and
fortune were lost. I could no longer feed my wife and
children. They were reduced to just skin and bones,
especial ly the bones.
And now, no one really wants to hire an old human
skull. But I still get by, making appearances and doing
commercial endorsements; I recently appeared in an
ad for Fangula brand toys. Above all, I keep on living,
loving, and learning. I also do my own stunts.
Goodnight, my friends.
Goodnight.

In conversation with Steven Spielberg
After debunking the popular
notions that the Holocaust and
slavery were "a good time," leg
endary filmmaker Steven Spiel
berg has decided to tackle
another social evil: Evil.
Here is our exclusive Diversions
interview with the cinematic mas
ter.
Diversions: So, your new film s
about evil, huh?
Spielberg: Yes. Contrary to pop
ular belief, evil has a downside.
It's definitely not good. I think it is
the director s mission to show
the world as it really is, not as
society wants to believe it to be.
I mean, evil is some bad stuff,
and people need to know that.
D: Yes, you 've proven time and
again that you re not afraid to
take controversial or even
unpopular stands.
SS: But I like to think my work
changes the way people think
about issues. I used to walk
down the street and hear people
say, "The Holocaust was a pretty
nice thing to spice up the history
books. Its ruthless efficiency and
mindless destruction were A
okay." It's so easy to forget that
six million people died in it. Well,
as a person with a Jewish
sounding last name, I wanted to
reframe the Holocaust as being
something not good. I don't think
it's going too far to call it a bad
thing.
D: How does that differ from your
approach to the slave trade in
"Amistad"?
SS: Well, the idea came to me
when I was in a cafe and I heard
some snippets lift out of a con
versation: "The slave trade really
affirmed human decency. I can't
see why that scalawag Lincoln
abolished it. Must've been the
Marfan's Syndrome in the brain
pan." The ignorance was
astounding! First off, Lincoln
didn't end the slave trade, the
founding fathers did. And Mar
fan's syndrome doesn't affect the
brain, it makes the limbs all long.
I was about to make a film called
"Marfanistad" when it hit me like
a thunderbolt: thathe slave trade
hardly fell on the good side of the
cjood/not-so-good line. I hoped
Amistad" would hurl the same
lightning that struck me. Slave
trade: opposite of good
D: Where did you get the idea
that for tvilistad"?
SS: I was at a cross-burning by
the plantation, and someone
murmured: "Evil is really, really
good. Boy, I sure could go for a
tall glass of evil right now." As
conscientious objectors, we can't
allow this.
D: When you put it that way, it's
really obvious how pandemic the
problem of evil is.
SS: Few people recognize it. If I
had a dime for every time I heard
someone say that evil was quite
nice after some cookies, I'd
have, I don't know, 30 cents.
D:Evil's sort of a large topic. How
do you plan on covering all of it?
SS: Well, that's the point, really.
All my previous work has been
building up to this, this titanic
confrontation between me and
evil. I dislike evil a great deal,
you know.
D You haven't answered the
question.
SS: No, you're right, I haven't.
D So.
SS: [pause] So, the thing is,
evil's not any good at all.
D: How do you portray evil? How
do make evil immediate?
SS: We did a lot of filming in evil
settings. Much of the film was
shot on location in the Valley of
the Shadow of Death, while the
rest was done in a soundstaqe in
Hell.
D Wait, you were in hell, and
you used a sound stage?
SS: Well, hell didn't really have
the evil feel we were looking for,
so we had to go to a set, and
insert some computer animated
evil.
D: What do you want people to
take away from the film?
SS: I want people to see evil as
being not good, or ungood, or.. .
D: Evil?
SS: Yes, I want people to see
that evil is evil.
