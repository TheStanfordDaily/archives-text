Love is like people; it's the vari
ety that makes it so special. Every
day I encounter a new form of love a
new way to connect myself to my
surroundings. Love has more flavors
than Snapple, and you can enjoy it
more ways than drugs.
For instance, when 1 say, "I love
carrots," I don't mean that in the
same way as, "I love my girlfriend,"
or, "I love my dog." The love I refer
to is a deep, sensuous and profound
ly erotic love. I really love carrots.
In me, desire and root vegetables
become one. The feel of a carrot
between my fingers makes my eyes
roll. Their color makes me sweat.
I can barely control myself in the
grocery store. I tremble before the
vegetable section. The sight of car
rot upon carrot is unbearable. Some

times I tentatively stroke one until
the guilt forces my hand behind my
back. Sometimes I lean over and
smell them, but only for a while.
Clearly these feelings 1 have for
carrots are very different from the
feelings I have for my wife. I love my
wife in the sense that she tastes deli
cious with tomato ketchup for
breakfast. Now clearly this is not the
same love I feel for carrots (Oh Car
rots! Carrots! God release me!). It is
a less passionate love and a more
practical one. But it is love all the
same, and it's few men who can say
they still love their wives after two
minutes in the microwave.
I love movies by Oliver Stone -
this is another kind of love. I love
them like the desert loves the sun. I
love them like the starving love

famine. I love them like cows love
steak. In other words, when 1 see an
Oliver Stone movie I either run away
as fast as 1 can or, if I'm tied to a
chair, I poke out my eyes with a
fork. The love I feel for Oliver Stone
movies is quite quite different from
my love for carrots or my wife. 1
despise him and 1 hate his movies. 1
love Oliver Stone in the sense that 1
want to kill him. 1 want to love him
over the head with a crowbar. No
amount of carrots can settle me after
one of his infernal movies.
My love for my dog is a platonic
one. It is a relationship based on
absolute trust and admiration, a
bond that transcends the physical, a
meeting of souls. My feelings for the
dog are perfectly respectable despite
what people say. Sure, maybe we get

a bit close when we're romping
around the park, and maybe 1 buy
her drinks in bars, and put my arm
around her. 1 love my dog for the
companionship she provides and
nothing more. That time in the car
never happened, and the other time
doesn't count because we were both
drunk.
T hen there's the love of God for
his creation. That love is uncondi
tional on the condition that you
obey his will and worship him. Oth
erwise, you go to hell.
Chairs, sunsets, remote controls,
my pelican, bathtubs, trains, George
I, George 11, not George 111, but def
initely George IV, left shoes, heart
surgery, these are things I love. I
don't love bicycles, however. When I
see bicycles I have to think carrots.

It's the only way I can stay in con
trol.
I love so much, I can barely list
what 1 love, let alone the ways.
I love you all. I wish there was a
way you could know how much. I
want to wrap my arms around the
whole world. Hut perhaps I'm not
making myself clear, Love is like the
end of 2001; it's incomprehensible,
even when you've read the book.
Perhaps that all that can be said
is that love is good with peas, grows
in the ground and rhymes with par
rot. Love is not something you can
demand but something you put in a
casserole.
