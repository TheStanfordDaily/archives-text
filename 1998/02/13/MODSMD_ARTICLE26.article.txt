						Human Skull Remembers

### A Human Skull 
In many ways, my
acting career began the
day 1 met Sir Laurence
Olivier in London, 1949,
shortly after he had won
the Academy Award for
"Hamlet". A rakish young
bootblack, I delighted
Olivier with tall tales and
ribald songs every after
noon as I polished his
brogues. We dined togeth
er a number of times in

the colorful pubs of the
West End. 1 will never forget what he told me on one of
these occasions: "Human Skull," he said, in his inim
itable way, "acting has taken me all over the world.
But I will never forget where I came from. And nei
ther should you."
I never did. What's more, I had found my calling.
I landed my first role three months later, as Skull of
Yorick in the traveling production of "Hamlet." That
show took me all over Western Europe, and I stuck with
it for a record six years. I continued to act on stage
until 1966, when 1 decided it was time to head for Hol
lywood. Just a starry-eyed young human skull, I
stepped off the bus at Hollywood and Vine with only a
suitcase and a dream.
I'd read Arthur C. Clarke's novel, "2001: A Space
Odyssey," years earlier and was thrilled to hear Stanley
Kubrick was making a film adaptation. I had to win a
part in it. I called Kubrick day and night until he gave
me my first starring movie role, as Proto-Hominid
Skull One in the Dawn of Man sequence. How I loved
that role! The only downside was the fact that it took
four hours every morning for the makeup artists to
apply the elaborate foam rubber prostheses that trans
formed me from a human skull into a primitive apelike
skull. But it was worth it, and I will always be grateful
to Stan for giving me my big break.
I acted in a number of films in the early 70's,
including the classic film "The Godfather." I* had a
touching scene where I played baseball with Don Cor
leone. Unfortunately, my part was left on the cutting
room floor. But that's show business! My next major
appearance was in Francis Ford Copoola's masterpiece
"Apocalypse Now." That production was easily the most
challenging and arduous I have ever experienced, but
it was immensely rewarding. I actually played two
roles: Mounted on a Stake Skull Four and Top of the
Bone File Skull Two. And I played them to the hilt.
But success came with a heavy price. I started
shooting up on heroin, and quickly my reputation and
fortune were lost. I could no longer feed my wife and
children. They were reduced to just skin and bones,
especial ly the bones.
And now, no one really wants to hire an old human
skull. But I still get by, making appearances and doing
commercial endorsements; I recently appeared in an
ad for Fangula brand toys. Above all, I keep on living,
loving, and learning. I also do my own stunts.
Goodnight, my friends.
Goodnight.
