# In conversation with Steven Spielberg

After debunking the popular
notions that the Holocaust and
slavery were "a good time," leg
endary filmmaker Steven Spiel
berg has decided to tackle
another social evil: Evil.
Here is our exclusive Diversions
interview with the cinematic mas
ter.
Diversions: So, your new film s
about evil, huh?
Spielberg: Yes. Contrary to pop
ular belief, evil has a downside.
It's definitely not good. I think it is
the director s mission to show
the world as it really is, not as
society wants to believe it to be.
I mean, evil is some bad stuff,
and people need to know that.
D: Yes, you 've proven time and
again that you re not afraid to
take controversial or even
unpopular stands.
SS: But I like to think my work
changes the way people think
about issues. I used to walk
down the street and hear people
say, "The Holocaust was a pretty
nice thing to spice up the history
books. Its ruthless efficiency and
mindless destruction were A

okay." It's so easy to forget that
six million people died in it. Well,
as a person with a Jewish
sounding last name, I wanted to
reframe the Holocaust as being
something not good. I don't think
it's going too far to call it a bad
thing.
D: How does that differ from your
approach to the slave trade in
"Amistad"?
SS: Well, the idea came to me
when I was in a cafe and I heard
some snippets lift out of a con
versation: "The slave trade really
affirmed human decency. I can't
see why that scalawag Lincoln
abolished it. Must've been the
Marfan's Syndrome in the brain
pan." The ignorance was
astounding! First off, Lincoln
didn't end the slave trade, the
founding fathers did. And Mar
fan's syndrome doesn't affect the
brain, it makes the limbs all long.
I was about to make a film called
"Marfanistad" when it hit me like
a thunderbolt: thathe slave trade
hardly fell on the good side of the
cjood/not-so-good line. I hoped
Amistad" would hurl the same
lightning that struck me. Slave
trade: opposite of good

D: Where did you get the idea
that for tvilistad"?
SS: I was at a cross-burning by
the plantation, and someone
murmured: "Evil is really, really
good. Boy, I sure could go for a
tall glass of evil right now." As
conscientious objectors, we can't
allow this.
D: When you put it that way, it's
really obvious how pandemic the
problem of evil is.
SS: Few people recognize it. If I
had a dime for every time I heard
someone say that evil was quite
nice after some cookies, I'd
have, I don't know, 30 cents.
D:Evil's sort of a large topic. How
do you plan on covering all of it?
SS: Well, that's the point, really.
All my previous work has been
building up to this, this titanic
confrontation between me and
evil. I dislike evil a great deal,
you know.
D You haven't answered the
question.
SS: No, you're right, I haven't.

D So.
SS: [pause] So, the thing is,
evil's not any good at all.
D: How do you portray evil? How
do make evil immediate?
SS: We did a lot of filming in evil
settings. Much of the film was
shot on location in the Valley of
the Shadow of Death, while the
rest was done in a soundstaqe in
Hell.
D Wait, you were in hell, and
you used a sound stage?
SS: Well, hell didn't really have
the evil feel we were looking for,
so we had to go to a set, and
insert some computer animated
evil.
D: What do you want people to
take away from the film?
SS: I want people to see evil as
being not good, or ungood, or.. .
D: Evil?
SS: Yes, I want people to see
that evil is evil.
