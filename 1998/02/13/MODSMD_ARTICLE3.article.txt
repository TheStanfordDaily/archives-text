# Profs shed light on Clinton scandal
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
While President Clinton's ac
tions in office may have been inap
propriate or illegal, history shows
he's not likely to face impeachment,
professors said yesterday.
Speaking to about 30 people in
the History Corner lounge. History
Profs. Barton Bernstein and David
Kennedy analyzed the scandal that
has engulfed the White House in re
cent weeks, leading to questions of
whether Clinton will be pressured
out of office.
"Even if it's established that
much of what's charged happened in
the White House, this is not the end
of a presidency." Bernstein conclud
ed.
The History Department spon
sored the teach-in on "Presidential
Scandals and the Media." the second
in a series of such events planned for
the year "to try to illuminate the rich
ness that historical context can give
to current events," according to
Assoc. History Prof. Lou Roberts,
who served as the moderator.
Impeachment. Kennedy said, is a
near impossibility for a president, in
part because of its vague definition
in the Constitution. Offenses pun
ishable by impeachment according
to the Constitution include treason,
bribery or "other high crimes and
misdemeanors," he said.
Andrew Johnson is the only pres
ident to have been impeached al
though the House Judiciary Com
mittee began proceedings against
Richard Nixon, who resigned when
his fate became obvious. The im
peachment process is inherently po
litical as well as judicial, he added.

and Johnson and Nixon both faced
strong opposition.
However. Clinton's case doesn't
follow either model, Kennedy said.
Many of Clinton's alleged wrong
doings that independent counsel
Kenneth Starr is investigating were
committed before he was elected,
and the White House has invoked a
constitutional interpretation that a
sitting president cannot be indicted
foi a criminal act.
Recent allegations that Clinton
had an affair with White House in
tern Monica Lewinsky are not
grounds for criminal proceedings,
but charges that he lied and urged
others to lie under oath could be.
Kennedy noted.
The Watergate case, in which
Nixon covered up a Republican
break-in to the Democratic Party
headquarters during the 11>72l l >72 presi
dential election, was a more clear
cut crime, he said.
"Whatever may or may not have
transpired between Monica Lewin
sky and William Jefferson ( linton is
not a crime." Kennedy said. "It's not
a burglary."
Hut Bernstein argued that Wa
tergate was "a burglary in which
nothing was stolen." Nixon's crime
came in coverups and perjury â€” the
same accusations Clinton faces.
Media attention has made the
current scandal different from any
faced in the past. Bernstein added.
That jokes about Clinton are
freely being made on late-night talk
shows and that coverage is so exten
sive in the mainstream news media
reflects a "landslide change in the
culture," he said. "We've had a
transformation of what the media
can deal with."
