Their season is halfway over and

ranked Stanford women's gymnas
tics team.
The Card meets the unranked
University of Denver Pioneers and
the Air Force Falcons tonight at b
p.m. PST at the Denver University
Fieldhouse.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
â–  Tonight: No. 11 Stanford at Den
ver and Air Force, 6 p.m. PST.

Stanford (1-3,1-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference ) is coming off a big weekend
where it upset ninth-ranked Michi
gan at the UCLA Invitational. The
Cardinal fell to defending national
champion UCLA but gave the Bru
ins a scare nonetheless. However, it
will be hard to enter this weekend's
meet with the same intensity when
the competition is not as good.
"We're coming off of a big
meet," said Stanford head coach
Mark Cook. "The team is still cy
cling and peaking and we're going to
try to maintain a quality perfor
mance and make small improve
ments."
The improvements Cook is re

ferring to involve cleaning up the
gymnast's routines. The focus now is
on adding skills, sticking landings,
landing dismounts and holding
handstands. Cook is also still exper
imenting with other athletes in the
lineup in an effort to improve the
team score.
"Many small errors are not ob
servable to the regular person."
Cook said. "But we know we need
to tuneup the routines. After all. the
little things make a difference at the
highest level, especially when the
difference between places is a tenth
of a point."
This weekend the team will not
concentrate on Denver or the judg
ing but is instead looking ahead to
the bigger picture. Cook sees the
meet as a good time to test the
squad's fitness in the high altitude
and judge how they measure up to
teams outside the Pac-l().
"We're at an excellent position
right now," said senior co-captain
Keri Monahan. "Our ranking is
about the same as in the beginning
of the season, but we have nowhere
to go but up. After last weekend
everyone is pysched and is starting
to step it up in the gym."
The squad is looking stronger by
the week as injuries are calming
down and gymnasts that had presea
son ailments are back on the mats.

Junior standout Katie Fitzpatrick is
still recovering from ankle surgery,
but is making fast progress and is ex
pected back in the next couple of
weeks.
Tonight also marks the debut of
sophomore and former second
team Ail-American Larissa
Fontaine in the Ail-Around.
Fontaine has gradually been phased
back into the lineup after suffering a
broken thumb in the preseason.
Tonight she will compete in her fa
vorite event, the bars.
Cook looks to Fontaine to "bol
ster the strength" of the bar squad
and also to co-captains senior Keri
Monahan and junior Amy Muraka
mi for leadership. Murakami is cur
rently ranked 2 l >th in the nation on
the Ail-Around while Monahan is
ranked 48th.
The Pioneers only lost one senior
from last year's squad and are led by
junior Robyn King and sophomore
Jennifer White. White was an alter
nate for nationals last year as an in
dividual, and King has consistently
been above 9.7 on bars, beam and
floor. As a team, Denver scores
around 190 while Stanford is averag
ing 192.5.
Air Force, a relatively unknown
team, is led by Katrine Waterman
and lost already to Denver this sea
son 192.2(H) to 184.025.
