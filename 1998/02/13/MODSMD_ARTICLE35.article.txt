State are ranked in the top 1(X) colle
giate teams, ranked 70th and 44th, re
spectively. Neither of the teams, how
ever. has any players ranked in the
top KM) this year.
'Both teams are ranked in and
around the top 50," said Stanford
head coach Dick Gould. "San Diego
had a good match with UCLA, even
though they lost."
San Diego State played UCLA,
ranked second in team standings just
behind Stanford, earlier this year,
taking a 2-5 loss. However, against
Pacific 10 Conference team Arizona,
the Aztecs triumphed with a re

Irvine at Taube Tennis Family Stadi

Gould said the most important
thing for Stanford right now is that
weekend.
"I hope it doesn't rain. We need at
least one good day," Gould said. "We
desperately need matches before the
national team indoors."
Stanford is seeded first at the
USTA / ITA Men's National Indoor
Team Championships. Hosted by the

University of Kentucky at the
Louisville Tennis Club, the tourna
ment features 16 teams, including the
top 12 collegiate teams.
"We need to get back together as
a team," Gould said. "With all the
other events happening, like the
Sybase and the Rolex nationals, we
have to shift the focus back on the
team. It will be nice to be together as
a team again."
Ciould said that the team is still
playing well and that everyone is still
healthy. He said he is planning to
hold one player out of each match to
give some of the younger, less match
toughened players more experience
for the future.
"The relevance of these matches
is it) prepare for the national team in
doors," he said. "We need these
matches badly."
