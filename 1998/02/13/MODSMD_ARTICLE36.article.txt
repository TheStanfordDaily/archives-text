# Swimmers look to drown Cal
## 
### Mino Martinez Contributing writer 
On Valentine's Day, any fan of
the ninth-ranked California Gold
en Bears women's swimming team
(12-1) will most certainly go home
hroken-hearted after facing the
No. 1 Stanford women's swimming
team.
Cal will visit deGuerre pool at
noon tomorrow and try to change
its fortunes against the Cardinal. In
the team's past 24 meetings, the
Bears have won only twice. De
spite their lack of success against
Stanford, Cal does in fact have a
fine program.
" They have a very good lineup
of swimmers this year and it should
make the meet more competitive
than in past years," said junior
Chantal Rawn.
The Bears have very talented
swimmers and place highly at the
NCAA Championships every year.
However, when comparing the two
teams there is one resounding
theme: whatever the Bears do well,
the Cardinal does better.
Cal's team is composed of stars
from Canada, Australia, Sweden
and Thailand. Not too shabby, but

a glance at the Stanford roster
shows Olympians from Canada,
Norway, Trinidad, Brazil and the
United States.
The leaders of the Bears are ju
nior Marylyn Chiang and sopho
more co-captain Elli Overton. Chi
ang holds the Cal school record in
the 1(H) hack and the 2(H) individual
medley. She also is among the na
tions fastest in the 1(H) free, 2(H)
back and 1(H) fly.

WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford vs. No. 9
California at deCluerre pool, noon.

Overton holds the school record
in the -MX) individual medley and is
among the nations leaders in the 2(H)
free. 2(H) fly, 2(H) breast and 2(H) IM. It
is this formidable tandem of Chiang
and Overton that leads the Bears.
Their supporting cast is also im
pressive, but not deep. Freshman
Hanna Jaltner has the ninth-fastest
1(H) breast time in the nation and
sophomore Waen Minpraphal has
the seventh fastest time in the 2(H)
fly. Both also have good times in
several other events.
How will the Cardinal counter?

Let us count the ways. The best
place to start is with sophomore
Catherine Fox. The two-time gold
medalist is the defending national
champion in both the 1 (K) fly and
the 1(H) back. She is the Stanford
record holder in the 50 free, and in
the top 10 in the country in the 1(K)
free, 200 back and the 200 IM.
Next on the list is freshman
Misty Hyman. Ranked first in the
world in the KM) meter flv and sec
ond in the 200 meter fly, she has the
fastest collegiate times in both
events, as well as the 200 back.
Added to these accolades is the fact
that she is the world record holder
in the 50 meter fly (short course).
Another pair of big guns for the
Cardinal are junior Elin Austevoll
and senior Amy Oberhelman.
Austevoll ranks third in the coun
try in both the 100 and 2(H) breast
and should fair quite well against
Cal. Oberhelman, nationally
ranked in both the 500 free and
1,000 free, is expected to emerge
victorious.
On Saturday the entire Stanford
squad will make their presence felt.
The Ciolden Bears will perform
well, but in keeping with tradition,
the Cardinal will perform better.
