Yesterday afternoon. Ambas
sador ()lcii (irinevsky. former direc
tor of the Middle East Department
of the USSR Foreign Ministry,
spoke on topics ranging from Is
rael's foreign policy with Egypt to
his personal interactions with Iraqi
dictator Saddam Hussein.
(irinevsky. who is also a visiting
fellow in the Center for Internation
al Security and Arms Control at
Stanford, addressed a packed con
ference room in Building 40 with a
talk titled "Iraq and the Middle East
Crisis: Soviet and Russian Policies."
Cirinevsky began his address

reminiscing about the day he was ap
pointed as director of the Middle
East Department by the Russian
Foreign Ministry.
"Usually, other places such as
Europe are considered more presti
gious. but you can't turn down such
an offer." Cirinevsky said. He went
011 to joke that the first question he
asked his superior was. "Where is
the Middle East?"
The ambassador explained that
when he assumed his post in the
l l )7()s. Israeli officials felt that if
Egypt were to make peace with Is
rael. there would be no more war in
the Middle East I he goal of the So
viet Union at the time was to pre
vent Egypt and Israel from reaching

any sort of peaceful agreement.
According to (irinevsky. the dif
ference between the policies of the
old regime of the Soviet I nion and
the new regime of Russia is that
Russia is in favor of peaceful settle
ments
Another focus of the talk was the
public's view ol Saddam Hussein
and (irinevsky's own interactions
with the dictator. What most ini
pressed (irinevsky was people's
tremendous fear of Saddam.
"I walked into a ri>om and saw
that everyone had a fearful look on
his face. 1 turned around and saw
Hussein standing there." Grinevsk\
said. "I saw how those people were
afraid ol him."

Cirinevsk\ first met Saddam in
IWJ. when Mikhail Gorbachev sent
him on a mission to urge the Iraqi
leader to withdraw troops from
Kuwait. The first meeting lasted
only 4<) minutes and nothing was
coneluded between the two men.
Later, (irinevsky was called upon to
speak with Saddam privately from
11 p.m to 3 a.m.
'I had the impression that he's al
ways ealculating and that he is think
inti of when and where I'm going to
cheat him." (innevsk> said.
He noted a huge statue of Sad
dam shaking hands with ancient
Babylonian leader Ncbuchadnez
