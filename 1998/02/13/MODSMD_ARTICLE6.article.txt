Now that
the flood wa
ters have re
ceded. facili
ties ()pe rat ions
is struggling to
assess the ex
tensive cost of
repairs on cam-

pus.
Jean Makes, administrative asso
date in the Office of Risk Manage

menl. said there were "major dam
ages throughout the campus " In
surance claims adjusters from Stan
ford Property Program are still as
sessing the losses. I he total cost of
the storm won't be know for
months, ot possibly years, until all
of the repairs are complete.
Last Monday night. Stanford re
ceived 3.7 inches of rain, a virtually
unprecedented event in recent cam
pus history.
According to Director of Risk
Management Jeffrey Seilbach.
Stanford has a SI million de

ductihle. and all costs above that
will be covered b\ insurance. Stan
ford will fund uncovered repairs
with money from "self-insurance re
serves." which is derived from gen
eral funds.
Ihc Green, Meyer. Cubbcrley.
and Braun Library basements suf
fered the worst destruction. Seil
bach said.
Manager of facilities Operations
('hris C'hristofferson said. "I nqucs
tionably the greatest damage and
costs will be in Green library Fast,
where flooding actuallv soaked

120.000 volumes and shorted out
the building's main transformer."
University Librarian Michael
Keller said the lower level ot (ireen
ma\ be open bv \la> "I'ntil thai
time, (library staff] will page Kn>ks
as necessary."
Keller said only 4.000 of all the
b<w>ks removed from Green and
Meyer could be re-shelved. The
others have been frozen and will be
freeze-dried in an attempt to sal
vage as much as possible.
