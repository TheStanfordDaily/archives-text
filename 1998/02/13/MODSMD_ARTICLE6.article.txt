# Cost of flood damage hard to estimate
## 
### Alexis Tygenhof Contributing writer 
Now that
the flood wa
ters have re
ceded. facili
ties ()pe rat ions
is struggling to
assess the ex
tensive cost of
repairs on cam-

pus.
Jean Makes, administrative asso
date in the Office of Risk Manage

menl. said there were "major dam
ages throughout the campus " In
surance claims adjusters from Stan
ford Property Program are still as
sessing the losses. I he total cost of
the storm won't be know for
months, ot possibly years, until all
of the repairs are complete.
Last Monday night. Stanford re
ceived 3.7 inches of rain, a virtually
unprecedented event in recent cam
pus history.
According to Director of Risk
Management Jeffrey Seilbach.
Stanford has a SI million de

ductihle. and all costs above that
will be covered b\ insurance. Stan
ford will fund uncovered repairs
with money from "self-insurance re
serves." which is derived from gen
eral funds.
Ihc Green, Meyer. Cubbcrley.
and Braun Library basements suf
fered the worst destruction. Seil
bach said.
Manager of facilities Operations
('hris C'hristofferson said. "I nqucs
tionably the greatest damage and
costs will be in Green library Fast,
where flooding actuallv soaked

120.000 volumes and shorted out
the building's main transformer."
University Librarian Michael
Keller said the lower level ot (ireen
ma\ be open bv \la> "I'ntil thai
time, (library staff] will page Kn>ks
as necessary."
Keller said only 4.000 of all the
b<w>ks removed from Green and
Meyer could be re-shelved. The
others have been frozen and will be
freeze-dried in an attempt to sal
vage as much as possible.

Keller expected to be able to re
cover more than 50 percent of these
books, and he reassured students
that those that are "irretrievably
damaged will be reordered, even in
the cases of books long out of print
and from distant cultures," he said.
This is a process that will last sever
al years.
Rodger Whitney, associate di
rector of Housing and Dining Ser
vices, said "we were relatively for
tunate" regarding student resi
dences. Problems consisted of
"many pop-up. short-term, emer

gency fixes" that have all been re
paired. Damage included minor
leaks, a one-day power outage on
the Row and several flooded base
ment areas.
The only student areas that were
impacted were four student rooms
in the ("rothers and ('rothers
Memorial basements. The residents
of these rooms have been relocated
during the recarpeting and repaint
ing process, but they should be
moving back soon.
According to Whitney, the storm
overall had a "minimal impact on
students" and all residences are
"pretty operational at this time."
Whitney credits Stanford's abili
ty to weather the recent storms to

proactive measures begun in Octo
ber as a response to El Nino warn
ings. Staff cleaned storm drains and
gutters of debris, and during the
second storm, they scouted the
campus identifying problems be
fore they became critical.
With the experience of a major
storm behind them, the Stanford fa
cilities staff is even more prepared.
Housing staff created an emergency
rotating schedule that would go into
place as stx>n as necessary. In addi
tion. a 24-hour emergency hotline
(5-1NI2) has been set-up to handle
any facilities-related emergencies.
The ground is still saturated, and
in Whitney's view, "more rain will
likely cause more problems."
