Attention all Human Biology Majors!
The Program in Human Biology Presents...
The Bingham Fund for Student Innovation
in Human Biology
The Bingham Foundation has generously provided funds that will support innovative
student projects proposed by Human Biology majors intended to benefit undergraduate education. Possi
bilities include planning and implementing a new course; designing one or more field trips for an existing
course; starting a collaborative research project involving a group of students; organizing a lecture series of
outside speakers for Human Biology or for Adams I louse, the Human Biology theme house; establishing a
new internship in a government agency or community organization; or starting a new student publication.
Human Biology majors are encouraged to apply for these funds at any time during the year. Applications
will be reviewed at regular intervals. Proposals, letters of reference, or questions about possible projects
should be directed to Russell Fernald, the Director of the Program in Human Biology, in Building 80.
