MAKING MORE WAVES: New Writing by Asian American Women
Scheduled readers: Anu Advani, Hershim Bhana, Chitra Divakaruni, Susan Ito, Myung Mi Kim, Carolyn
Leilani-Lau, Jessica Oliver, and Celine Salazar Parrehas with an introduction by Elaine Kim
When Asian Women United of California gathered fiction and nonfiction by Asian American women of
many ethnicities in Making Waves (1989), the group had no idea its collection would be adopted by educa
tors, generating enough royalties to fund video documentaries and other projects as well as spadework for
this new collection From nearly a thousand submissions received in response to requests through Asian
American Studies programs and community groups and media, an editorial advisory board selected just
under four dozen pieces—prose and poetry, fiction and nonfiction, essays, memoirs, and reportage—filled,
as the editors' preface suggests, "with surprises that open spaces for speaking about the past in new
ways, as well as for dreaming of alternative practices in the present and future" A collection as diverse as
the communities whose voices it shares and celebrates Making More Waves is edited by Elaine Kim, Lilia
V. Villanueva. and Asian Women United of California
