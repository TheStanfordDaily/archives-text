PROCRAST I N A T I ON
rocrastinators are people
who put off what's in
their best interest to com
plete. If you replace high
priority tasks with low ones,
or otherwise "waste time" by
watching TV, playing on the
Net, talking on the phone, or
hanging out with friends, you're
among the more than SO'I of
students who pro-crastinate
during college.
Causes
People who put things oft may
have one or more ot these traits
They may:
■ Lack a realistic sense ot time;
they think there's more than
there really is
■ See the task as bigger than it is
■ Want someone else to be
responsible (there's no one
there to tell them to study,
pick up, finish a task, or get
their act together; it's com
pletely up to them)
■ Become paraly/ed in face ot
their own high standards
■ Procrastinate to hide tears of
anticipated failure or loss of
control
■ like the last-minute excite
ment ot not having quite
enough time and/or the
feeling ot excessive catteine
and not enough sleep
Effects
Although procrastination sivms
harmless and is often joked
about, putting things ott can
have serious consequences.
These may include:
■ Incompletes or tailed classes
■ Losing professors' trust
■ Missing opportunities; losing
jobs
ft
Procrastination is not a new
behavior at Stanford.
m Fines and other financial
difficulties
■ More entrenched psycho
logical or medical problems
■ More stress
■ Poor performance, resulting
in self-deprecation, doubt,
and frustration
What to Do
Observe yourself. Notice when
you procrastinate, and the tech
niques you use. Ask yourself
what you get out of putting
things off. Notice how much
better vou feel when you finish
a task The suggestions below
can help:
■ Pretend that you're not a
pnxrastinator (tor an hour or a
day)
■ Work on an assignment the
dav vou get it, even it only
tor a short time
Making a "To-Do" List
■ Identify key areas in your life
(e.g. "class-related," "personal
chores," "fun activities")
■ Write each area at the top of
a column on the same page,
so everything is visible at a
glance
■ Write what vou have to do
under each heading
■ Prioriti/e items in each
column
■ Assign times to entries
■ Fnjov crossing oft entries
when done
■ Update vour lists often
■ Organize all materials
before beginning a task
■ Break tasks into small
pieces; focus on one at a time
■ Experiment with lists, plan
ners, calendars, and dry-erase
boards
■ Figure out your prime times:
when you work best, do chores
best, like most to socialize
■ Put reminders of your prior
ities in books, on mirrors,
walls, refrigerators
■ Test your sense of time: write
down how long you think a
project will take, and time it
■ IV clever about using little bits
of time
■ Grab an impulse to work on a
project, and stay with it while
it lasts
