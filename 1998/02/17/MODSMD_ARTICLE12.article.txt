New migration theory proposed
PHILADFI PI lIA (AP) Ihe once neat and tidy picture of how
people liist migrated to the new world has been thrown into turmoil
bv discoveries that push back the time of the first arrivals by thousands
of years.
Discover ies of ancient skeletons, dwelling sites, language histories
and genetic evidence all suggest that Asians migrated across the
Bering Stiaits in successive waves over thousands of years and then
fanned out into North and South America.
(ione is the idea that Asians came across the Bering land bridge in
a major migration H).(HX) to 11,(HH) years ago and first settled at a site
near ( lovis. N.M.
"We know now theie were at least three or four different waves of
migration." Dennis Stanloid of the Smithsonian Institution said yes
terdav at a meeting of the American Association for the Advance
ment of Science. "Hut there really is not a consensus among the
researchers about how and when it happened.
" I he last two years have been an extremely exciting time of dis
covery in the study of the first Americans." he said.
A dwelling site in Monte Verde, in southern Chile, has been
accepted by most scientists as the earliest confirmed place of sustained
human habitation in the new world. It has been dated to 12.5(H) years
ago. Hv some estimates, it would have taken more than h.(KM) years for
people to have journeyed by stages fiom the Bering Straits to Monte
Verde.
That means the peopling ol America started as early as 20.1HX)
years ago. said Tom Dillchay. a University of Kentucky researcher
who Inst excavated Monte Verde. 1 le said there is some evidence that
people may have lived in ( hile as early as 33.0(H) years ago.
"I think there may have been a steady stream of people coming
across fiom Asia hom very early." Dillchay said.
