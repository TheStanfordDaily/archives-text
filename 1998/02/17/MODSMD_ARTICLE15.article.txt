Expand SI FN to reach
larger student and
consumer markets

PRESIDENT CASPER should
empower the Stanford Instruc
tional Television Network to be
the l ime-Warner of Stanford instruc
tional material. ITie network has the
potential to support all areas of the
University, allowing students and
external customers to benefit from
Stanford's intellectual capital.
Imagine the date is February, 2001.
Steve, a Science, Technology and Soci
ety major, has an important interview
with Macmillian Publishing at 9:30
a.m. But his first class starts at 9 in the
morning. How can he resolve the con
flict? Actually, he'll have no trouble
making his interview and covering his
class — since SITN has digitally
recorded the course for easy retrieval
via the Internet or a DVD player
located at Meyer Library.
Sound incredible? Since 1969. the
SITN has been developing the infras
tructure for televising engineering
courses both on and off campus. In the
past three years, it has also developed
Stanford Online — a project that pro
vides digitally recorded lectures on the
Internet using video technology devel
oped by Stanford alumni.
In a January issue of the Stanford
Report. I nversity President Gerhard
Casper spoke of placing greater focus
on using technology for the advance
ment of education. We suggest that
President Casper place a high priority

on this issue. Rather than limit SI TN
to focusing only on engineering cours
es offered through the Stanford Cen
ter for Professional Development,
SITN's role should be expanded so
that it distributes Stanford instruction
al materials through all forms of multi
media. We suggest the following steps:
1. Expand the infrastructure. Build
more video-enabled classrooms and
conversion facilities to offer digital
video that can be distributed through
other channels — Internet. VCR.
DVD, etc.
2. Expand the customer base. Consider
on-campus undergraduate gradu
ate students as a potential market.
3. Expand the product offering. Find
other courses beyond the engineering
curriculum that are marketable,
including courses that are heavily
attended bv on-campus students.
4. Expand the service offerings. In line
with Casper's belief in expediting the
educational process, develop more ser
vice offerings or packages that can be
used to expand Stanford's reach
beyond the engineering domain.
SITN has developed a very impor
tant service in the 27 years of its exis
tence. Hi is can be expanded to help
educate all Stanford students. Rather
than limiting Stanford's scope to the
physical classrooms and lecture halls
on campus, we urge the president to
build the infrastructure and offerings
that will make Stanford the leader in
using technology to update education
durinii the 21st century
