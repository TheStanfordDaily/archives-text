# David Ball
## Outrage and insight on page 4 
### 
I'VE NEVER consid
ered myself a Daily
columnist. Certainly I
don't speak with the same
conviction as previous
columnists, who seem to
have an opinion on just
about everything from

public service to
entrepreneurism and from tenure to varsity
athletics. I consider myself a moderate: suit
ably outraged at times, never indifferent
and usually but seldom overwhelmed
by a single cause or mission.
Rarely is this the case on the opinions
pages of The Daily. Rather, the newspaper
becomes a forum for an agenda, a projec
tion of the individual's personal beliefs on
the often unwilling population of readers. It
is a predictable, if humorous, drama:
David Ball's column (Feb. 17) — Grave
robbing is cool. Not only is grave robbing
cool, I think all Stanford students should
participate in grave robbing. Maybe it could
replace the Big Game bonfire. Move the
party to the mausoleum and watch the
sparks fly!
Letter to the editor (Feb. IS) — I am
offended and appalled by the insensitive
and cruel words you allowed to run in yes

terday's opinions column. Grave robbing is
a serious offense and should never be treat
ed in such an offhanded manner.
Mark Shafer
Sophomore, economics
Letter to the editor (Feb. l c >) — I believe
it is completely within our cherished First
Amendment rights to speak in support of
grave robbing. Minority voices must not be
sacrificed for mainstream values, at whatev
er cost. I find it typical of such right-wing
conservatives like Mark Shafer to attempt
to deny us our basic human rights.
Marcia Fletcher
Junior, physics
Letter to the editor (Feb. 20) — As chief
of police for the Stanford community, I
must explicitly state that the Stanford police
department does not condone and never
has condoned the practice of grave robbing.
Raoul INiemeyer
Stanford police captain
Letter to the editor (Feb. 21) — 1 believe
that previous responses to the divisive issue
of grave robbing have overlooked the
semantic and philosophic nuances of the
term "grave robbing... "
With any luck, the community outrage
lasts for a week, until I write my next explo
sive column on kiddie porn or drowning kit

tens. The pattern is a familiar one for Daily
readers: an article is followed by a series ol
impassioned responses that are rarely in
conversation with one another. Public
speakers often become proselyti/ers. fram
ing arguments in ways that leave little room
for intelligent discussion. What ensues is
not dialogue, but a form of verbal mastur
bation.
I realize my goals do not have the politi
cal charge that many former and present
columnists possess, 100 many columnists
seek to make their readers read rather than
think. My aim is not to lecture but to for
ward ideas. I'd prefer to think of this article
more as a meditation than an agenda. Intro
spection and apathy are easily confused for
one another in a public arena, yet shouting
never yields the same insights as a meaning
ful silence.
If this column falls somewhere between
self-righteousness and equivocation. I'll
consider my time well-spent. 1 will gladly
trade an intelligent conversation for a
week's worth of vitriolic "Letters to the
Editor."
Hopefully, you'll agree ... dammit.
