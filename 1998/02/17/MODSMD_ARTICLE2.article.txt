Wellstone, a Democrat from
Minnesota, was a professor of po
litical science at Carleton College
for 21 years before being elected in
1990. His speech is titled, "We ( an
Do Better: A Progressive Eco
nomic Agenda For Students."
Currently serving his second
term. Wellstone has a broad leg
islative agenda on issues ranging
from government reform and edu
cation to the environment and en
ergy. Stanford In Government.

Castafio, the Riddell Fund and the
Office of Residential Education
are bringing Wellstone to campus.
"1 want to focus on the con
creteness of the issues at a univer
sity level. On the other hand, the
fact of the matter is that politics in
Washington is the way our nation
makes a lot of critical decisions
that crucially affect the quality or
lack of quality for people." Well
stone said in a telephone interview
yesterday.
Despite the need to address
concerns most relevant to stu
dents, Wellstone does not intend
to speak solely about low-interest
loans and federal grants.
"I don't assume that [financial
issues] are the only issues students

are interested in,"he said, "just as
when I speak to a group of senior
[citizens], I don't only speak about
Medicare and Social Security."
He emphasized that student
participation in politics is para
mount in the process. "It's quite
one thing to say we don't really
like the sort of politics in Washing
ton. that it is not very connected to
our lives, but it is another thing to
opt out [of politics] completely.
"When students opt out. special
interests dominate," Wellstone
added.
"I also understand the sort of
discouragement, cynicism and not
wanting to have anything to do
with politics that students face, hut
when you opt out. you are saying
that the status quo is OK, which
it's not," he said.
In his speech, Wellstone also
wants to address issues including
economic justice, race, gender,
poverty and increasing social stratifi
cation.
Wellstone. the only challenger
to unseat an incumbent in the 1 WO
Senate elections, is known for the
grassroots campaign he ran to win
the senate post.

He advocates political involve
ment by everybody, not just col
lege students, in order to make
representative democracy work as
America heads into the next mil
lennium.
" This is a great opportunity to
get a discussion going at a neigh
borhood level about where we
want things to be," he said.
Wellstone is also keen on the
idea of bringing big politics from
the Beltway into the neighbor
hood and the home. He cited an
example from several years ago
when cuts were proposed in feder
al financial aid: "The petitions that
came in.the letters, the phone calls

and the meetings on campuses"
were what turned things around tin
this issue in Washington.
"I want to really try to give an
important lecture that will make a
difference to students. I want totrv
to connect with the students, and
maybe even inspire them," said
Wellstone, who will tr\ to allow
time for questions.
Before his speech. Wellstone
will eat with students in the Man
/anita Dining Commons at S:M)
p.m.
"1 look forward to a lot ol give
and-take and getting a feel for
what sort of things students are
doing now." he said.
