litical science at Carleton College
for 21 years before being elected in
1990. His speech is titled, "We ( an
Do Better: A Progressive Eco
nomic Agenda For Students."

from government reform and edu

stone said in a telephone interview
yesterday.

to speak solely about low-interest
loans and federal grants.

issues] are the only issues students

are interested in,"he said, "just as

Medicare and Social Security."
He emphasized that student
participation in politics is para
mount in the process. "It's quite
one thing to say we don't really
like the sort of politics in Washing
ton. that it is not very connected to
our lives, but it is another thing to
opt out [of politics] completely.
"When students opt out. special
interests dominate," Wellstone
added.
"I also understand the sort of
discouragement, cynicism and not
wanting to have anything to do
