Don V deaden discourse
In his column last Thursday. T. J. Bab
bitt contends that The Stanford Review is
racing into obscurity because "it has run
out of things to say." An ironic charge from
a columnist who doesn't seem to be teem
ing with new ideas; Review-bashing has
been going on long before Babbitt ever
graced The Daily's editorial pages.
In fact. I can see Babbitt's strategy â€”
bashing conservatives is a great way to build
a loyal fan base.
Lightheartedness aside. Review writers
consistently provide a variety of conserva
tive and libertarian analyses on issues
important to the Stanford community.
This campus needs more discourse; slan
dering the messenger accomplishes noth
ing. A university lacking a free and public
discourse is a sick institution. I encourage
all concerned students to offer competing
visions for Stanford's future instead of
engaging in time-tested Review-bashing.

Reed promotes tolerance
We at The Stanford Review were heart
ened by your editorial on Feb. 9. It was
good to see a daily paper on a largely liber
al college campus encouraging students to
attend a conservative event and hear about
political and cultural issues from a different
perspective.
However, we were dismayed by the edi
torial's assertion that Ralph Reed promotes

intolerance. To say that Ralph Reed and
the Christian Coalition actively promote
intolerance is preposterous.
Both Reed and the Christian Coalition
have condemned abortion clinic violence.
They have opposed physical and emotional
harrassment of gays and have openly criti
ci/ed individuals who stage protests at the
112 unerals of prominent gay activists.
Reed does not support the gay political
agenda which includes same-sex marriages
and gays in the military. However, reason
able and articulate people have disagree
ments about these issues. Even many gays
do not support the positions taken by gay
rights organizations. Opposition to the gay
political agenda does not constitute intoler
ance toward gays any more than opposing
the conservative agenda constitutes intoler
ance toward conservatives.
While we applaud your promoting the
event and increasing campus discourse
about these important political issues. The
Daily's ad hominem attack on Ralph Reed
was unjustified. If The Daily makes sweep
ing statements about Ralph Reed promot
ing intolerance without substantiating its
claim, how is The Daily "tolerant?"

Greek life is beneficial
I am writing to clarify misconceptions
about sororities and fraternities that were
expressed in Sylvia Berry Williams' Feb. 13
letter regarding sorority housing.
First of all. NO sorority or fraternity dis
criminates on the basis of racial or ethnic

factors. To do so would he contrary to the
policies of Stanford University, the bylaws
of our national organizations and our indi
vidual consciences. Greek groups pride
themselves on their diversity of member
ship and leadership.
In addition. Mrs. Williams mentioned
outstanding women such as Sen. Diane
Feinstein. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
and astronaut Sally Ride as examples of
non-Greek women who have excelled.
These women went to Stanford at a time
when sororities did not exist. But what
about individuals such as Sen. Barbara
Boxer, Justice Ruth Badcr Ginsburg, and
astronaut Neil Armstrong? All of these out
standing achievers were members of Greek
organizations. Seventy-six percent of the
current U.S. Senate and Congress were
affiliated with Greek organizations, along
with 40 of the past 47 Supreme Court jus
tices and all but three of the U. S.presidents
since 1K25.
It is no coincidence that Greeks have
excelled in politics, science, entertainment
and the arts. Greek organizations encour
age academic excellence, community ser
vice and the development of morals and
values.
