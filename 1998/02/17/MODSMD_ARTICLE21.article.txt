# From the fourth dimension
## Horizontal lessons: headaches and humility 
### 
Kerry Rodgers

I AM ONE with the floor. From this angle
of the room all 1 can see are legs crossing
and uncrossing and feet tapping as dis
embodied voices discuss 18th-century aes
thetic theory.
Eventually I dare to make a comment
from my position on the floor. The heads I
can see pivot in my direction: the rest laugh.
1 hope their awkward giggles refer to my
physical predicament and not to my incoher
ence caused by the opiates swimming in my
brain.
It has been a strange week.
I'll spare you the intricate medical details.
Basically it all began one day when 1 awak
ened feeling like I was in a zero-gravity car
nival fun house of mirrors. Driving my car
was like riding a nasty roller coaster. Riding
my bike was like being on quickly spinning
ferris wheel. Even walking was like swim
ming underwater.
My disorientation lessened when I lay in
bed and stared at the ceiling. But I was
unprepared to slow down my busy life with
out a struggle.
I started getting seriously concerned
when I began having difficulty remembering
recent conversations or well-memorized
phone numbers.
Three days, four doctors and 40-odd

phone consultations later the vertigo was
worsening, so they checked me into the hos
pital to sample my bodily lluids. take some
routine brain tests, and ol course, perform
the obligatory physical exam to rule out any
sinister possibilities.
Thankfully, after lengthy analysis the
cause of my discontent turned
out to be easily treatable with a

week of strong pharmaceuticals
and rest.
Hut as I began my recovery I
stumbled across a minor compli

cation: excruciating headaches as a
result of the spinal tap they gave me

in the emergency room.
I proceeded to skip five days of

class and became totally dependent on
friends for food, transportation ;ind inter
face with the outside world. My cognitive
function and balance were back full force,
but 1 still couldn't remain vertical for more
than 60 seconds without passing out in pain.
Exasperated, I finally decided to drag my
sorry ass to class. I became one with hori
zontal surfaces all over campus. I felt like a
fool.
Those with whom I interacted seemed
torn between two modes of response: cool
and quiet respectful distance or concerned.

questioning curiosity.
My social skills were suffering after a
week in isolation, and I was divided by a
decidedly less grace

ful dual impulse: to explain in minutiae the
reasons for my abnormal behavior or to tell
everyone to fuck off and stop looking at me

so strangely.
Hadn't they ever seen a person lie down
in public before?
Around the seventh day of this ordeal, it
occurred to me that maybe I had missed
something. Often, when life's teachers come
along we write them off too quickly as incon
veniences. Maybe I was so busy being frus
trated and anxious about my situation that 1

was not paying attention to the
lessons it offered.
I laving prejudged sickness as a
tragedy. I was too caught up in
cursing my pain to see anything
valuable in it.
When I began to look closer, I

started to see the hilarity of it all. Our
bodies' peculiar needs can be an infinite
source of amusement if we can take them
lightly.

On a deeper level. I realized how the
limitations of being sick can instruct

one in humility. When I am well. I
often forget to be humble, and my
mind begins thinking too much of
itself.

"I write big papers. I make big
paintings. I attend a big university. I am a big
person, and I can do whatever 1 want." it
says.

It is this fundamental attitude that pro
pels us to attempt to defy nature, to over
come universal law.
I think a similar arrogance compels peo
ple to build huge mansions on precarious
waterfronts. ITiinking that money and will
are stronger than storms, they erect their ele
gant trophies on land that is intended to
crumble.
Then the rain comes, and we are all
forced to face the tenuousness of our power.
We learn to give up our sacred indepen
dence in exchange for community. We learn
to use our bodies not just as houses for our
minds, but as canes to help each other walk
or human-powered conveyor belts to rescue
drowning lxx)ks.
In the face of catastrophe, we quickly get
in touch with our humanity. One can't be too
proud when one is nose-diving for the near
est place to lie down. One can't be too sophis
ticated when one's living room is full of mud.
Flckkls and headaches may sometimes be
angels in disguise, keeping us in place. They
teach us. bv brute force, to live in harmony.
