## 'Sit Down, Chris!' Maples fans target coach 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
On Valentine's Day. one would have been very hard
pressed to find any love inside Maples Pavilion.
USC head coach ( hris Gobrecht was back in town.
However, this time the situation was different. She
was not bringing in a hard-nosed Washington team that
used to give the C ardinal fits and made for one of the best
(and most fiery) rivalries in the Pacific 10 Conference.
This time she broughi a USC' program that is strug
gling with a 10-12 record and trying to rebuild to the form
of past glory.
But this didn't mean the Maples maniacs were going
to be any more forgiving. On the contrary, they had been
relishing this day since USC had announced May H that
Gobrecht was returning to her alma mater, meaning that
after a one-year reprieve at Florida State, she was going
to renew old rivalries.
This was a prospect she had cheerfully discussed the
Tuesday before the Women of Troy hit the Bay Area for
games against Cal and Stanford. But when the subject
turned to Maples Pavilion, the mood quickly changed.
"I've never look forward to coming up there," Gob
recht said. "Even when I had teams thai were lurther
along than [USC), it was never fun. People in Maples
don't do much for me. Stanford fans need to \u>rk on
some things."
And they did work on some things unfortunateK
for Gohrecht. they were 'Sit Down Chris!" T-shirts and
signs.
However, aside from a sarcastic standing ovation dur
ing introductions, the 5.001 in attendance were kept in
check as the Women of Tro\ staved close until 2 minutes.

Sophomore guard Christina Batastini defends USC's junior guard Kristin Clard in Saturday's blowout at Maples. Batastini and the rest of the Cardinal bench
was called upon early and often by coach Tara VanDerveer.
32 seconds remained in the first half,
when sixth-ranked Stanford (15-5,
11-1) went on a 9-0 run to pull ahead
46-34.
The fact that USC fell apart
early in the second half only gave
the fans more fodder to throw her
way. After a 5-second violation in
which she got particularly demon
strative with the refs. the 'Sit Down
Chris!' chant began in earnest, com
plemented nicely with the waving of
the signs behind her bench.
Meanwhile, the physical and de
liberate play that has been a trade
mark of Gobrecht-coached teams
was becoming less and less of a fac
tor as Stanford increased its lead to
as much as 30 points on its way to a
91-63 victory.
But Gobrecht must have at least
been happy to leave the animosity
on the court and. more importantly,
get a split on the road (IJSC beat Cal
Thursday night) as she continues to
build her program, right?
Well, not exactly.
"One thing that's on my mind,
and I'm just going to say it up front
and get it over with," Gobrecht said
tersely in the postgame press con
ference. "between what happened
to my team and what happened to
our men's team. I'm just going to say
this: How come this team with so
much class and this coaching staff
with so much class and this program
with so much class has fans with so
little class?
"I find it appalling, and I see no
place for it in this conference. It's
just getting a little old — the swear
ing. the personal comments, the car
rying on. I just think someone needs
to tell Stanford fans to stick it in
their ear."
Before she finished her venting,
(iobrecht had also lambasted the in
famous Sixth Man Club for its be
havior. calling it "rude, crude and
classless."
Oh yeah. Gobrecht finally got
back to the game.
"I think Stanford's playing about
as well as anyone in the country," a
flustered Gobrecht said.
USC is taking its lumps now. but
hopefully for Gobrecht's sake, she
will be able to bring teams into Stan
ford that will make the Maples ma
niacs nothing more than a sideshow
and not the annoying nuisance that
Gobrecht sees them as.
On Valentine's Day. one would have been very hard
pressed to find any love inside Maples Pavilion.
