## 'Sit Down, Chris!' Maples fans target coach 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
On Valentine's Day. one would have been very hard
pressed to find any love inside Maples Pavilion.
USC head coach ( hris Gobrecht was back in town.
However, this time the situation was different. She
was not bringing in a hard-nosed Washington team that
used to give the C ardinal fits and made for one of the best
(and most fiery) rivalries in the Pacific 10 Conference.
This time she broughi a USC' program that is strug
gling with a 10-12 record and trying to rebuild to the form
of past glory.
But this didn't mean the Maples maniacs were going
to be any more forgiving. On the contrary, they had been
relishing this day since USC had announced May H that
Gobrecht was returning to her alma mater, meaning that
after a one-year reprieve at Florida State, she was going
to renew old rivalries.
This was a prospect she had cheerfully discussed the
Tuesday before the Women of Troy hit the Bay Area for
games against Cal and Stanford. But when the subject
turned to Maples Pavilion, the mood quickly changed.
"I've never look forward to coming up there," Gob
recht said. "Even when I had teams thai were lurther
along than [USC), it was never fun. People in Maples
don't do much for me. Stanford fans need to \u>rk on
some things."
And they did work on some things unfortunateK
for Gohrecht. they were 'Sit Down Chris!" T-shirts and
signs.
However, aside from a sarcastic standing ovation dur
ing introductions, the 5.001 in attendance were kept in
check as the Women of Tro\ staved close until 2 minutes.
