ball team rolled to a 91-63 win over USC

ed her 3(X)th career win at Stanford.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
â–  Saturday:
Stanford 91, DSC 63

The Cardinal (15-5, 11-1 Pacific 10
Conference) got its usual big perfor
mances from senior guns Olympia Scott
and Vanessa Nvgaard, as the duo com
bined for 41 points and IX rebounds in
Stanford's 28-point drubbing of the
Women of Troy (10-12.5-K).

But what wasn't necessarily expected
was the big-time performance of Stan
ford's bench, which included players like
sophomore guard Yvonne Gbala/eh and
freshman forward Karesa Granderson.
Following Stanford's win over IJCLA
last Thursday, VanDerveer said she was
set on a seven-player rotation. However,
less than two minutes into Saturday's
game against I JSC. VanDerveer went to
her bench and called on a player not in
cluded in that seven (ibalazeh.
"We played a lot of different lineup
combinations," VanDerveer said. "Some
that we've probably never played or even
practiced with. But for us I thought a real
key was our picssure on the ball, and
Yvonne came in and did that for us."
In the first half alone, VanDerveer
used nine different players (mostly
guards), getting a combined 20 minutes
from the bench. At that point the C'ardi

nal had rebounded from a slow start that
saw it trail for most of the first 12 minutes.
With 8 minutes, 1 second remaining in
the first period senior forward Heather
Owen sank two free throws to give Stan
ford a 27-26 edge and spark a 21-8 run to
finish the half.
"I liked the pace of the game," Van-
Den eer said. "I thought it was helpful to
our team because we could get out and
run a little bit. and we got some good in
side scoring from Olympia."
The Card moved the ball exceptional
ly well on offense and got plenty of fast
break opportunities thanks in part to the
scrappy play of sophomore point guard
Milena Flores.
Mores followed her 18-point perfor
mance i)n Thursday with an equally im
pressive performance against the Women
of Troy. Four of Flores' career-high six
steals came in the first half, and her4-of-7

shooting performance was once again
filled with acrobatic drives.
"I think something just finally
clicked," Flores said of the weekend.
"The coaches are constantly telling me I
can take it.and 1 finally realized that I
could. It's not anything different in their
defense. My mentality, I guess, just
changed really quickly."
In the last two minutes of the half
alone, Flores was all over the place. Two
steals that sparked the transition game
and a driving layup at the bu/ver were
only topped by an offensive foul call that
ended what was possibly the play of the
game.
A missed free throw from USC s
Tiffany Washington got things started,
and Flores drove into the lane hard, draw
ing contact and flipping the shot over her

USC head coach Chris Gobrecht, an old favorite of
Maples Pavilion hecklers, was riled during this
weekend's game against Stanford. She called the
Sixth-Man club "rude, crude and classless."
