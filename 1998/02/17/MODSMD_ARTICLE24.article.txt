Junior centerfielder Kelly Yablonskl bunts In the first of Sunday s games against Cal-
State Northrldge. The Cardinal swept the No. 15 Matadors to open the season.
Blevins pitched a complete game
shutout, allowing just three hits and
one walk while striking out seven.
" The energy level was high in both
games." Schneider said. "What was
most impressive. I think, is the fact
that we came nut even stronger in the
second game when it would have
been easy for us to let down after the
great victory in the first game."
The second game was scoreless
until Crouch lit things up in the fourth
as she doubled home Schneider to
give the Card a 1-0 advantage. In the
fifth. Wiginton doubled to score se
nior outfielder Dawn Kobata. In the

bottom of the sixth, Stanford got two
insurance runs when Wiginton sin
gled home sophomore Liz Quimby
and freshman Ramona Schelburne.
Wiginton finished the game 2-4
with 3 RBIs and a double. Crouch
hurled a two-hit complete game
shutout, whiffing two while walking
none.
Crouch displayed impressive con
fidence as she attacked each hitter.
She mixed up her pitches well to keep
the Matadors off balance and guess
ing.
"Marcy's performance was phe
nomenal." Yablonski said. "Despite it
being her first game pitching this year,
she didn't pitch around anyone even
though the Matadors have impressive
hitters throughout their lineup."

The key to Stanford's success this
weekend was the solid play from
every member of the team. Though
Stanford benefited from excellent
pitching, clean defense was important
in preventing the Matadors from
crossing the plate.
"'lt was a great team effort,"
Yablonski said. "Everyone played
well on Sunday. Even our freshmen
were impressive, despite being ner
vous about playing their first college
game."
Stanford is now 2-0 while the
Matadors dropped to 4-3.
Although the Cardinal was not
voted into the lop 25 in preseason
polls, its handy whipping of a top
ranked team has given it a boost of
confidence.
