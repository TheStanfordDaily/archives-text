It's also the first time ever that
the team has swept its series with
the two L.A. schools and rival Cali
fornia.
"Since Art (Lee), Kris (Weems)
and I have been down here, we
haven't even won one game, much
less swept them, so we wanted to
come down here and play well."
said junior forward Peter Sauer.
"To get two wms is huge for us to
stay in the race for the Pac-10
championship.
" I he Ari/onas came in and beat
us. and we've still got those guvs so

that's next on the agenda as far as
what we've got to do in conference.
But now we've got four of six at
home, we've made the I A trip
and beat the I A teams, so now
we've got to finish off strong."
I ISC" gave the Cardinal a serious
run for its money but only for
one half.
A miserable 32-percent shtxM
ing performance by Stanford in the
lirst halt allowed the Trojans to re
main only two points behind at
halftime. but after that it was all
Cardinal.
I hings were just as bad under
the basket, where the Cardinal
grabbed only rebounds com
pared to the Trojans' IS.
After the intermission, the game
began to look more like the 37-
point blowout the Cardinal handed
the Trojans last month at Maples
Pavilion.
Stanford opened the second half
with a 28-10 run for a 61 -41 lead and
never bothered to li>ok back. IJSC
couldn't get the deficit any lower
than 17 points after that.
The team hit 46 percent of its
shots from the field after halftime
and was 7-of-ll from downtown.
The Cardinal also out-rebounded
I!SC 25-15 in the second half.
Power forward Mark Madscn
helped crash the boards. The
sophomore pulled down a team
high 12 boards, nine of which came
off the offensive glass. He also
added seven points.
Point guard Arthur Lee, who
had a career-high 26-point scoring
performance against the Trojans
last season at the Sports Arena, led
the Cardinal with a season-high 23
points.
Lee hit 5 of 8 shots from three
point territory. He also dished out
four assists without turning the ball
over once.
Junior center Tim Young
chipped in with another double
double. scoring 19 points while
nulling down 10 rebounds.

"I think part of it had to do with
coming off the win at UCLA,"
Young said of the team's cold start.
"We were playing not to lose in
stead of to win. We just didn't have
a lot of focus."
Of course, the slow pace of the
first half could also be attributed to
the quiet crowd of 2,014 that
showed up at the Sports Arena.
That, combined with the Cardinal's
emotional victory over UCLA last
Thursday, didn't exactly help in cre
ating a great atmosphere.
"The energy level was not so
good in the first half," said Cardinal
coach Mike Montgomery. "We
played a little softer than we wanted
to. and it affected us. We were kind
of taking the three-point shot,
which was the easy way out. and it
wasn't going down. It's always
tough to win in LA.
Now the Cardinal has finished
off its toughest stretch of the season
and can look forward to trying to
catch Arizona while playing four of

its remaining six regular-season
games at home.
The Wildcats have a two-game
lead on Stanford in the standings
for the Pac-10 championship, which
pretty much means that the Cardi
nal can't afford to lose any more
games if it wants even a share of the
conference crown.
Arizona used a late-surge to
avoid an upset against cross-state
rival Arizona State Saturday and
escape with a one-point win. and
with the season winding down
quickly, the Cardinal's disappoint
ing overtime loss to the Sun Devils
is looming even larger.
"We've won seven conference
road games. We've done a pretty
good job. Now we've got to head
back home." Montgomery said.
"We've got to recognize that we've
still got some work to do. We're still
m the hunt for [the Pae-10 title], Wc
played much better this weekend in
certain stretches than wc have for a
while."
