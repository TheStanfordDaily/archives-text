It's also the first time ever that
the team has swept its series with
the two L.A. schools and rival Cali
fornia.
"Since Art (Lee), Kris (Weems)
and I have been down here, we
haven't even won one game, much
less swept them, so we wanted to
come down here and play well."
said junior forward Peter Sauer.
"To get two wms is huge for us to
stay in the race for the Pac-10
championship.
" I he Ari/onas came in and beat
us. and we've still got those guvs so

that's next on the agenda as far as
what we've got to do in conference.
But now we've got four of six at
home, we've made the I A trip
and beat the I A teams, so now
we've got to finish off strong."
I ISC" gave the Cardinal a serious
run for its money but only for
one half.
A miserable 32-percent shtxM
ing performance by Stanford in the
lirst halt allowed the Trojans to re
main only two points behind at
halftime. but after that it was all
Cardinal.
I hings were just as bad under
the basket, where the Cardinal
grabbed only rebounds com
pared to the Trojans' IS.
After the intermission, the game
began to look more like the 37-
point blowout the Cardinal handed
the Trojans last month at Maples
Pavilion.
Stanford opened the second half
with a 28-10 run for a 61 -41 lead and
never bothered to li>ok back. IJSC
couldn't get the deficit any lower
than 17 points after that.
The team hit 46 percent of its
shots from the field after halftime
