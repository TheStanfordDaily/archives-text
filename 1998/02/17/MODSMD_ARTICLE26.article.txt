MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Friday: Stanford del. UC-Santa
Barbara 15-6. 15-6.15-11.
■ Sunday: Stanford del. Cal State-
Northridge 15-JS. 15-3,9-15, 15-9.

The sixth-ranked Cardinal (7-0.6-
0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) posted victories Friday against
No. 10 UC-Santa Barbara 15-6,15-6,
15-11 and Sunday against Cal State-
Northridge 15-8.15-3,9-15,15-9.
"We were surprised to dominate
the match." Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves said. "But we con
trolled them from start to finish."
The Cardinal served the Gauchos
into trouble early in the match, caus
ing Santa Barbara to bench its top hit
ter. Jeremy Darner, in the first game

because of passing woes. Stanford
recorded seven aces on the night,
four of which came from freshman
setter Josh Lukens.
Stanford served short, forcing the
Gauchos' front row to receive. Santa
Barbara had trouble handling the
serves, and the players were unable
to run their quick attack.
Like the Cardinal's match last
week against Pacific, senior middle
blocker Tad Hoffman was a major
factor defensively.
"Although Hoffman had a sub
par hitting match, he had an excep
tional passing match." Nieves said.
Three Stanford players posted
double-dig!! lola J&
outside hitter Andy Witt led the Car
dinal with 16. while junior outside hit
ter Patrick Klein added 13. Senior
middle blocker Keenan Whitehurst
posted a match high .562 hitting per
centage. adding 11 kills.
Sunday's match, although it had
the same outcome, was a different
story. Even though the match was
more difficult for the Cardinal, sever
al players posted new season highs.

"We started out slow," Nieves
said, "and didn't come out with the
same sense of urgency and focus as
the previous match."
Northridge (3-5, 1-5) did not play
well in games one and two but gave
the Cardinal trouble in games three
and four. Witt had a strong hitting
night, recording 32 kills and matching
his season high. Witt had previously
recorded this total against ()hio State
and Pacific and entered the match
ranked fifth nationally in kills.
Whitehurst, who entered this
weekend ranked third nationally in
hitting, chalked up a .4KI (15-2-27)
percentage with 15 kills in addition to
posting a season-high 11 block*.
Hoffman, ranked second nation
ally in hitting, returned to his normal
offensive form after a one game
slump. He added 15 kills to the Car
dinal total and hit .458.
Stanford served effectively until
the crucial fourth game. After falling
behind 10-4, the Matadors began to
come back. But with Stanford up 14-
9, senior swing hitter Devin Pool man
served an ace to finish the match.
