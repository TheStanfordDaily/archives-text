## 
### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
Students distributed provocative
fliers in protest of Nike on Friday at
the Liberal Arts Career and Intern
ship Fair. Yet a cordial conversation
was all that ensued between the pro
testers and Nike representatives.
Nike declined to make an official
statement on their complaints but
distributed informational pam
phlets explaining Nike's policy. The
demonstrators were protesting the
company's alleged mistreatment of
employees in Southeast Asia.
Assoc. Drama Prof. Rush Rehm.
who organized the do/en protesters,
accused Nike's public relations de
partment of glossing over the issues.

" They spend a lot of money looking
slick.*" Rehm said.
Rehm added that Nike can af
ford to pay Tiger Woods millions to
wear a Nike hat. yet the company
pays many workers a bare minimum
wage.
Three Stanford College Republi
cans were on-site in counterprotest
of the protesters.
"We decided to make signs and
launch a counterprotest in support
of Nike and what we believe are fair
and even generous practices." said
junior Ryan Parks, president of the
College Republicans.
Parks' group had signs that read
"Nike Saves Lives" and "Amnesty
International Starves Children."
"Surveys that sav workers are

disgruntled and unsatisfied have
been shown to be faulty, since they
did not take a scientific random
sampling of workers and asked lead
ing questions at the end of the work
day." Parks said.
"Nike provides over 5(X).(KI0 jobv
worldwide," he added. "When Nike
enters a nation to manufacture
products, the wages increase and
the poverty level decreases."
According to a Nov. 22 article in
The New York Times, over 450.(XKJ
Southeast Asian workers, many of
them teenage girls, are reportedly
paid $1.60 a day. In addition, ac
cording to an internal study recently
leaked by a disgruntled Nike em
ployee, the workers in a Ho Chi
Minh City factory are exposed to
dangerous levels of carcinogens.
Nike was ready for the accusa
tions with a pamphlet titled, "Nike
Now â€” Informed Consumer Up
date." According to this pamphlet,
"Nike was the lirst company to have
its Code of Conduct monitored by
an independent third party, the in
ternational accounting firm Ernst &
Young.
"When factories can't live up to
[Nike's] Code of Conduct, as in the
case with four Indonesian subcon
tractors. Nike terminates their con
tract," the pamphlet said.

"There is an enormous differ
ence between what is officially rep
resented and the facts." Rehm ar
gued. " This type of protest is going
on in many places across the nation,
even in colleges with larger athletics
departments than Stanford."
According to student protester
Jill Shenker. a junior, the group is
asking Stanford to terminate its con
tract with Nike or negotiate until the
company can guarantee a living
wage for its workers without forced
overtime, as well as provide a
healthy work environment, an end
to worker harassment and the right
for all its workers to join tree, inde
pendent unions.
None of the student protesters
has had direct contact with workers.
Hut Darlene Damm. a senior

who spoke to workers during an in
ternship with the World Bank in
Jakarta last summer, said. "Nike
jobs are better than no job at all A
lot of the people were appreciative.
However, the conditions eould defi
nitely be improved. I he world won t
be right until they are."
Damn) also pointed out that
workers aren't allowed to demon
strate in many of the countries in
Southeast Asia without government
permission.
Al Levin, assistant director of the
Career Planning and Placement
Center, said companies at the lair
were not screened.
"The career fair was open to an\
employers that wanted to attend."
Levin said. "We appreciate student
opinions on the issue."
