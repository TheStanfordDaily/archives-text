tered the weekend riding a two
match win streak, wrestling the best it
has all year. And although dual meets
against ( al Poly San I uis ()bispo and
Fresno State failed to yield wins, the
team continues to wrestle well on its
way to the Pacific 10 Conference and.
hopefully, the national champi
onships.
Thursday night 's meet at Cal Poly

began with sophomores Rudy Kui/
and Zach Zimmerer sweeping the
1 IK- and 126-pound divisions against
brothers Jaime and Alberto Garza,
respectively.
"We really wiped the (Wr with
the Gar/as." said Stanford assistant
coach Tod Surmon. "1 mean, when
you get beat that soundly, it hurts the
family."
After freshman Jason Talbott's
loss in the 134-pound weight class, ju
nior Beau Weiner extended his string
of dual-meet victories to four bv

eking out a lough 5-4 decision over
Jesse Reta. Unfortunately, Stanford
could not capitalize on its early 9-3
lead, losing the last six matches, two
by major decisions.

ford head coach Chris Horpel. "We
lust didn't have it on this night."
As expected. Cal Poly's heavier

weights came through, sweeping all
the divisions above 142. Chapman's

win and prevented him from
wrestling against Fresno State.

hut our technique was not as sharp as
we needed to he." Horpel said.

beating "Tim Cornish 7-2. Mcpherson

lost a grueling 4-3 match at 158 to
Matt Demers.

match," Horpel said. "Had stalling
been called the way it normally is, we
would have won."
Grant defeated Mike Mellor 10-3
in the 167-pound division, hut junior
Shane Cross could not come away
with a victory at 177. Wrestling in
place of Chapman, Cross made a
valiant effort against Markese Nel
son. eventually falling 6-3.

favor of Stanford. Facing a forfeit in
the heavyweight division, the Cardi

dual-meet schedule for the season.
All that is left for the Cardinal grap
plers is the Pac-IO Championships

and the NCAA tournament for those
who qualify.
"On paper Fresno was the better
team. They also had the homecourt
advantage. Hut we wrestled with a lot
of heart and effort and each athlete
left a piece of his soul on the mat,"
Horpel said.
"I felt that although we lost the
dual, it was one of our top perfor
mances of the year and was a good
springboard for the F'ac-10 and
NCAA Championships."
