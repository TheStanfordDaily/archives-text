The Stanford wrestling team en
tered the weekend riding a two
match win streak, wrestling the best it
has all year. And although dual meets
against ( al Poly San I uis ()bispo and
Fresno State failed to yield wins, the
team continues to wrestle well on its
way to the Pacific 10 Conference and.
hopefully, the national champi
onships.
Thursday night 's meet at Cal Poly

began with sophomores Rudy Kui/
and Zach Zimmerer sweeping the
1 IK- and 126-pound divisions against
brothers Jaime and Alberto Garza,
respectively.
"We really wiped the (Wr with
the Gar/as." said Stanford assistant
coach Tod Surmon. "1 mean, when
you get beat that soundly, it hurts the
family."
After freshman Jason Talbott's
loss in the 134-pound weight class, ju
nior Beau Weiner extended his string
of dual-meet victories to four bv

eking out a lough 5-4 decision over
Jesse Reta. Unfortunately, Stanford
could not capitalize on its early 9-3
lead, losing the last six matches, two
by major decisions.
