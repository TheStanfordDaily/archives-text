By no means its best meet, the
squad counted no falls and swept
the top four places in the all
around.
"We stayed focused and con
centrated the entire meet." said
head coach Mark Cook. "We're
still growing as a team."
The Cardinal opened up on the
bars and scored a 48. 175. almost
half a point below the team's aver
age. Sophomore l.arissa Fontaine
led the Cardinal and rocked her
bar routine with a score of 4.8. hit
ting all of her passes.
Friday's meet was Fontaine's
first time performing on the bars,
and she seems to have made the
transition smoothly. Sophomore
Kim Young also performed well
with a score of 4.775, her season
high
Next up was the beam, and the
Card was a little shaky, finishing
with a score of 47.625. However,
the team fought hard to stav on and

didn't have to count an\ falls.
Standing nut was former Canadian
OKmpian Jennifer Exaltacion. a
freshman. Exaltacion performed
on the beam for only the second
time this year and chalked up a
score of 9.7.
Cook said he believes Exalta
cion deserved a 9.9. calling her
beam routine "beautiful and gor
geous."
Stanford worked hard on the
floor. making minor mistakes but
finishing strong nonetheless. Ju
nior co-captain Amy Murakami
stole first in the floor with a season
high score of 9.9.
Cook said he was extremely
pleased with the squad's work on
the floor and doesn't think the
score reflects the performance.
The squad wrapped up the meet
with the vault, which was "solid."
according to Young.
While the Card was struggling
along. Denver refused to go softK
into the night Sophomore Jennifer
White won the vault with a score of
9.750 and stole third place on the
floor with a score of 9.825.
White's teammate, junior Dana
Mims, helped out with a second
place finish on vault (9.725) and a
first place finish on bars (9.825).
However, individual performances
weren't enough for the Pioneers,
who finally succumbed to the Car
dinal's depth.
Murakami led the Cardinal and
won the all-around with a season
high score of 39.075.
Murakami has excelled consis
tently in three out of the four
events, but over the weekend
everything came together and Mu
rakami hit all four of her routines.
