### Bill Bowen Contributing writer 
Top administrators, ASSU offi
cers and Stanford students will liter
ally draw closer together tonight.
The ASSU Senate has arranged
for some of the University's head of
ficials to visit Otero, Rinconada,
Gavilan, Kimball, Larkin and
Twain.
The dorm outreach was initially
introduced by ASSI J Senate Deputy
Chair Matt Spenee, a sophomore, in
order to increase student contact
with University officials. The sen
ate's freshman senators then orga
nized the event.
"We're hoping it's a chance for
students to get to know administra
tors and for administrators to get to
know students and to allow for an
exchange of ideas in a casual set
ting," explained freshman senator
Clara Chan.
In addition to University admin
istrators. the ASSIJ's top officers
will attend to hear student concerns.
"We plan to inform students
about the ASSU and what we're

doing to represent students," said
freshman senator Ben Liu. "We are
also interested in learning how we
can better serve students in the fu
ture."
Spence said the event marks a
change in tactics for the student gov
ernment. "So far, the ASSU has
been closed off from the student
body," he said. "Thisevent will bring
Stanford's decision makers, both ad
ministrators and elected ASSU offi
cers, to start talking about important
campus issues with students."
Undergraduate Advising Center
Director Lori White, Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education
Ramon Saldivar, Dean of Students
Marc Wais, Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs James Montoya and
University Registrar Roger Printup
will be among the 36 administrators
visiting various dormotories this
evening.
Student representatives will in
clude Spence, ASSU President
Emily Andrus and ASSU Vice Pres
ident Ben Decker.
Chan explained that the adminis
trators were "spread out over vary-

ing fields of interests to appeal to a
hroad range of students."
Freshman senator Jack Wang
commented, "Some of the faculty
members are more obscure than
others but are powerful and have an
interesting role in University af
fairs."
Administrators and ASSU offi
cers will visit dorms at 5:45 p.m. for a
reception and will move to the din
ing halls at 6 p.m.
ASSU officials said administra
tors have responded enthusiastically
to the idea.
"So far. the response to this pro
gram has been amazing." Spence
said. "This is the first time in 20years
that almost all top administrators
have been in the dorms at one time."
Spence hopes that this dorm out
reach will be part of a continuing ef
fort to personalize both the Univer
sity administration and student gov
ernment. The ASSU has planned
another dinner for Apr. 7, which is
scheduled to include Provost Con
doleezza Rice and other University
officials who weren't available
tonight.
