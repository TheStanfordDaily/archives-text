ing a road trip would mean it could finally play a series
without interference from rain.

■ Friday: Stanford 6, Texas 2
■ Sunday: Stanford 9, Texas I
Stanford 7, Texas 7

After a week of rainouts and rescheduling games at
Sunken Diamond, the Cardinal (9-0-1) traveled to sunny
Austin, Texas this weekend for a three game series with
the No. 24 Texas Longhorns — a series that was short
ened by rain.
"I thought when we went to Texas we would be get
ting away from the rain," said junior pitcher Brent
Hoard. "Instead, it kind of followed us."
With a rainout Saturday, the Cardinal attempted to
squeeze in a double header hours before its flight home
on Sunday. Since a collegiate baseball game becomes of
ficial after the completion of five innings, the first game
was shortened to seven innings while the second was
called after live. And still, Stanford left the Lone Star
state with its undefeated record intact.
Playing Friday in the only full-length game of the se
ries, the Cardinal trailed 2-1 and was one strike away
from its first loss in the ninth inning. Starting his first
game of the season after returning from injury, third
baseman Josh Hochgesang pounded a shot to center

field, driving in junior Jody Gerut to tie the game and
eventually send it into extra innings.
Local hero and Cardinal sophomore Craig Thomp
son, a native of Dallas, cracked a triple with the bases
loaded in the 11th to give Stanford the 6-2 victory.
"It was a tough place to play," said Hoard, who start
ed the game. "We played pretty well, but we can defi
nitely play better."
Sunday's first game probably marked the easiest
game of the series for the Cardinal, as another Texas na
tive helped lead Stanford to a 9-1 victory. Junior pitcher
Jeff Austin allowed only three hits and one earned run,
pitching six of the game's seven innings and landing the
win.
The final game of the series was called as the Long
horns were gaining momentum in terms of offense but
hurting in their pitching. Having gone through much of
its bullpen, Texas made a late offensive run in the fifth.
With Stanford leading 7-4, the Longhorns scored three
runs to tie the game in what would be the final inning.
"It would've been a lot more fun to see [the game] go
on," said Texas head coach Augie Garrido. "They clear
ly reacted to the close call on Friday night [in the first
game]. They came out with a level of intensity and a con
centrated effort that brought out the best in them."
Stanford now turns its attention to the Saint Mary's
Gaels, which it hosts today at 5 p.m. in a game that was
added late to the Cardinal schedule in the hopes of
making up for the rainout with Cal State-Fullerton last
week.
In his third year as head coach for the Gaels. Rod In
gram will try to increase the Gaels' winning percentage
against the Cardinal. St. Mary's has only won eight of the
45 games it has played with Stanford since 1971.
