# Testimony concludes in Pfefferbaum trial
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Lawyers will submit closing statements today in a
hearing regarding Psychiatry Prof. Adolf Pfefferbaum's
dismissal.
Testimony concluded Friday before a hearings offi
cer retained by the Academic Council's Advisory Board
to determine six disputed facts in the case. Upon re
viewing the testimony and closing statements — which
will be submitted in written form UC-San Francisco
Law Prof. Richard Marcus will report to the board,
which will then determine whether University President
Gerhard Casper has grounds to dismiss Pfefferbaum.
Pfefferbaum retired from a position at the Palo Alto
Veterans Affairs Hospital in 19%. an action that the
University considered to constitute retirement from his
Stanford professorship as well. Pfefferbaum and a Santa
Clara County judge disagreed, prompting Casper to
begin formal dismissal proceedings.
Testimony before Marcus — which focuses on Pfef
ferbaum's treatment at the VA hospital after he com
plained about then-VA Chief of Staff Richard Mazze's
behavior has stretched over three months. Richard

Popp. senior associate dean for academic affairs at the
School of Medicine, returned to the stand Friday for ad
ditional questions after his testimony was interrupted in
January due to confidentiality issues.
On Friday. Popp offered no further information
about letters of counseling sent to other Medical Seh(x)l
professors — information the University thought would
violate confidentiality — hut did testify about a review
of Pfefferbaum's outside consulting activities.
Requests for permission to do outside consulting are
not as formalized within the Medical School as within
the VA hospital. Popp said. While the University
doesn't regularly ask about the nature of consulting ac
tivities. "it is implicit that the people in the chain of com
mand are watching" to ensure the consulting doesn't vi
olate University policies, he said.
Popp added that he knew nothing about Pfeffer
baum's alleged problems in having consulting activities
approved until "it had already been resolved to what 1
undersUxxJ to be the satisfaction of all parties "
Psychiatry Prof. IraOhelc. deput\ chief of staff
for psvchiatrv at the VA hospital, was recalled as a wit-
ness Friday and testified that Pfef
ferbaum's consulting request sat on
his desk for several months while
Glick waited for further instruction
from Mazze and Stanford Psychia
try Department Chair Alan
Schatzberg.
Pfefferbaum has said he felt
Glick was singling him out in delay
ing approval of what he considered
a normal consulting request. Pfef
ferbaum acts as a consultant for the
California Youth Authority, a juve
nile prison system.
