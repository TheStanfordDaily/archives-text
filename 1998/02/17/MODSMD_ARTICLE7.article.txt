# Tales from the crypt

Every time you access your telnet ac
count, type in "pine" and start firing off
e-mails to your friends at home about
how you hate your roommate, you im
plicitly assume that the e-mail you are
sending is secure. This assumption, how
ever, is not true.
According to Martin Hellman. profes
sor emeritus of electrical engineering.
"Anything confidential Stanford stu
dents send over e-mail, unless properly
encrypted, is very vulnerable."
Although you may not realize it. en
cryption technology, a field which Hell
man revolutionized, is fundamental to
the convenience and security of ad
vanced technology.
Encryption is needed "for electronic
banking, e-mail and cellular phone con
versations." Hellman said. "The Internet
is extremely insecure in terms of just data
flowing over it. but it it's encrypted, then
it can be quite secure."
Hellman is considered to be a great pi
oneer in the field ot cryptology He said
his initial interest was inextricabK linked
to his childhiH>d in the Bronx in the
19505.
"In some sense, it goes back to when I
was a little kid ... and [my family] moved
from a predominantly Jewish neighbor
htHKl to a predominantly Irish-Catholic
neighborhiHKl I wanted a Christmas tree

and Christmas presents... but I couldn't be
like them. I was fundamentally different."
The disposition of the pariah stayed
with Hellman when he began his work in
cryptography.
"When I first started working with
cryptography in the early N7(h. my col
leagues almost uniformly told me that 1
was foolish to do that because the NSA
has a multibillion dollar budget, and
you'll never discover anything they don't
know."he said.
Rather than being scared by the warn
ings. they made cryptography interesting
to Hellman.
"In some ways." he reflected. "I should
thank the kids who beat me up... I would
have been scared to do it otherwise."
The beginnings of his interest in this
field blossomed immediately after he
completed his doctoral studies at Stan
ford. In I%<S. he was hired by IBM to
conduct research in New York While
there, he realized the company was
spending SI million a year researching
cryptography. It must be a worthwhile
field, he thought.
Hellman s groundbreaking work oc
curred when he was working together with
researchers Whitfield Diffey and Ralph
Merkle at Stanford. According to Hell
man. the mam contribution of this remark
able team was that it made cryptography
"a legitimate area for academic research."
The main technical contribution ere

ated by Hellman and his colleagues is the
Public Key Cryptography (PKC) system
"We can think of a normal crypto
graphic system as being a mathematiza
tion of a strong box." Hellman said "You
need to knou the key to encipher data
and to decipher data .. PKC is like a
mathematization of a different kind of
lock Instead of using the same combina
tion to lock and unlock. \*h\ not use dif
ferent combinations to lock and unlock?"
According to Hellman. the biggest
problem with a conventional crypto
graphic system was ke\ distribution. An
other problem was that organizations
such as the military used couriers to
transfer keys. Couriers, he said, are often
problematic because they are very ex
pensive and slow
"If you make your enciphering key
public and make the deciphering key se
cret. you get privacy without couriers."
Hellman said "Anyone who wants to
send you a message looks up your enci
phering key. scrambles the message with
that and sends it to you."
It is general accepted that the PKC sys
tem revolutionized and simplified en
cryption technology. Ihe benefit of this
system is that anyone could send a secure,
publicly-encrypted message and only the
receiver can privately decipher it. Con
versely. if you make your enciphering key
