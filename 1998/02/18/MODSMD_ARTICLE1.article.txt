# Boswell talks on Iraq, career
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
Both the international crisis in Iraq and the per
sonal crises of job-hunting drew a crowd of more than
40students to Eric Boswell'stalk last night in Florence
Moore Hall, where the assistant secretary of diplo
matic security spoke about his career as a Foreign Ser
vice officer.
Boswell addressed both problems, first discussing
the career path of a Foreign Service officer. In a job
that requires relocating to a new country every two to
three years. Boswell served in places such as Senegal,
Jordan and Canada.
He explained that there were four major types of
representational work in the Foreign Service: political
and economic, both of which involve gathering infor
mation about the particular country; consular, which
includes reviewing visa applications; and administra
tive. which is a support network for the other services.
Boswell said an applicant is tracked into a "cone" of
service at the entry exam.
Instead of directly creating U.S. policy on foreign
countries. Foreign Service officers "make policy in a
big way using discretion on little things." Boswell said.
I lie Secretary of State uses the information they gath
er to make I S. policy decisions. As officers them
selves. however, members of the foreign service "rep
resent the I nited States." Boswell said. "You don't
have the option of designing your own policy."
Inevitably, questions arose about the current ten
sion in Iraq. Boswell said he thinks the I Jnited States
is firm in its position.
" I here is a hammer poised in the Persian (iull ...
and it is expensive to keep that hardware there,"
Boswell said. "The hammer has to fall sometime."
Boswell added that it has been harder to build an
international coalition similar to the one in IWI be
cause Saddam I lussein is "less of a bad guy." 1 le men
tioned that Arab countries, sensitive to the suffering
of the Iraqi people, are less willing to put themselves
publicly behind the coalition.
As the same time, Boswell said the main terrorist
threat to the United States is no longer "concentrated
state terror," such as during the Iran-hoslagu af
fair. Special operations and security procedures have
improved since then, and the United States has more
experience in dealing with those kind of situations.
Instead, the I Inited States is vulnerable to"era/ies
in the I Jnited States our hard right, lunatic fringe."
Boswell said.
Boswell said that the most important qualities of a
Foreign Service officer include a sense of patriotism,
serviceand flexibility. Boswell said that while he had
not often felt his life was in danger, he believes that the
officers "live difficult lives." After 25 years, Boswell
has decided to leave the Foreign Serviceand take a job
with the Pan American I lealtli (Jreanization.
