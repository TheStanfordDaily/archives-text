the same day from a different egg. That boy was born in 1990.

Alcohol linked to breast cancer risk

daily had a 41 percent greater risk of developing brenst cancer than
women who did not drink, a new analysis that combined several studies
has found.
The study, which confirmed earlier findings, found that breast-cancer
risk increased proportionately with increases in alcohol intake. I ach
daily drink was associated with about a percent increase in risk of
breast cancer, the researchers reported in today's issue ol I he Journal ol
the American Medical Association.
The link existed whether the drink was beer, wine or hard liquor, said
