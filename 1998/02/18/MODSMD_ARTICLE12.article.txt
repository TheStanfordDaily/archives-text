CHICAGO (AP) — Doctors prescribed antidepres
sants and stimulants at soaring rates in the 10 years end
ing in IW4. spurred by the new generation of antide
pressants such as Prozac, researchers say.
" There has been an enormous increase in research
on mental disorders that has elaborated a much better
understanding of how they come about and how to
treat them more effectively," said Dr. Harold A. Pin
cus, lead author of a new study in Wednesday's issue ot
The Journal of the American Medical Association.
"Partlv as a byproduct, there's been a large increase
in the number of new medications available." he said by
telephone yesterday from Washington, where he is
deputy medical director of the American Psychiatric
Association.
Also, he said, the stigma of having a mental disorder
has waned and people are more willing to seek treat
ment.
The number of doctor visits in which patients
received prescriptions for mental problems rose from
32.7 million to 45.6 million over the decade, the
researchers said. That amounted to a 20 percent
increase in the share of total doctor visits resulting in
prescription of such drugs, called psychotropic drugs,
they said.
Visits in which depression was diagnosed almost
doubled over the 10 years, from about 11 million to
more than 20.4 million, the researchers said.
More growth occurred in the prescribing of antide

pressants than in any other category, from 30.4 percent
to 45.2 percent of all psychotropic drugs, the
researchers said. At the same time, tranquilizer pre
scribing fell from 51.7 peicent to 33 percent of ps\
chotropic drugs.
Undoubtedly, doctors have switched main patients
from tranquilizers, such as Valium, to new
sants such as Prozac because the new drugs work better
and more selectively without being habit-forming or
causing unpleasant side effects. Pincus said.
While stimulants account for onl\ a small proportion
of psychotropic drugs, the rate at which they were pre
scribed more than tripled in the study, from I 5 percent
to 5.1 percent of all psychotropic drugs given during
doctor visits.
'That is almost exclusively aimed toward treatment
of children and adolescents with attention deficit hyper
activity disorder," Pincus said.
I he study did not explore whether drugs were giu n
appropriately, and Pincus declined to speculate. In
recent years, health officials have encouraged more
recognition and drug treatment of depression, and cam
paigns have been waged to increase public and physi
cian awareness of its prevalence.
Dr. Patrick B. Harr. board chairman of the Ameri
can Academy of Family Physicians, said Prozac was
plagued by safety questions which were debunked
by the Food and Drug Administration in the earl\
IWOs and many patients refused to take it.
