Community should
find creative solutions
to solve crisis at Green

WHILF. WE COMMEND
the Green Library staff and
the Stanford community
lor their efforts in rescuing water
logged books from the Green Library
basement on Feb. 3, we believe that
the creativity and cooperative effort
that characterized the initial relief
effort should continue in the coming
weeks.
Extensive and accessible library col
lections have often been considered a
lallmark of great universities. Regret
abl\. the recent Hooding at Green has
urther compounded the issue of
iccess to both the library and its col
ection.
Half ot (ireen has been closed since
he 1 9N9 Loma Prieta Earthquake, and
t remains unclear when the lower
evel that was damaged earlier this
nonth will be accessible to the general
uiblie.
While we understand the unfore
;een circumstances, the bottom line is
hat the current situation in the Green
xisement limits the ability of students
md laculty to access important eduea
ional materials. Particularly hard hit
■>v the flooding are literature students
is volumes ot literary criticism, novels,
md plays are located in the Green
casement.
Currently, materials can be paged
rom Green s lower level and South
Mezzanine lor critical academic needs
>nly. At the moment, there is a mini

mum 22-hour turnaround time for
obtaining books, and there is no guar
antee that a paged book will be acces
sible.
While the efforts of librarians to
help students obtain materials from
the basement and from other libraries
i are highly commendable, it is time for
I the Stanford community to mobilize
once again to devise interim solutions.
There are a variety of tasks remain
ing in which students presumably
could be of assistance. In the haste to
remove books two weeks ago, identifi
cation numbers on the books were not
written down. Librarians are currently
trying to obtain identification numbers
for the salvaged books in order to
inform library users of an item's avail
ability. Extra student hands could like
ly facilitate the identification process.
Students could also help move
books to other areas on campus so that
they could be accessed with greater
ease. Space could be temporarily
reconfigured in other libraries, in par
ticular on the second floor of Meyer
Library, to accommodate some of the
books.
While we recognize that re-arrang
ing space and moving books takes time
and effort, the University libraries
have a responsibility to make the col
lection accessible to the community —
especially if access to the Green base
ment will be restricted well into spring
quarter.
As events two weeks ago showed,
the community is ready to assist the
libraries. As a first step, however, the
libraries must better communicate
their needs and the current state of the
recovery process to the University
community
