# Appreciating all-nighter points
## 
### 
WHEN SENIOR
year rolls
around you can
finally say. "Hey. screw
that! I'm not in the
mood." Perhaps the best
example of this is in apply
ing the "Course Load/All

Nighter
When shopping for classes that first week of
the quarter, you file into a ton of class
rooms. While the professors spew out the
usual first day gig, you are hypnotized by
the only thing that matters to you at the
moment ... the syllabus. You're totally
oblivious to the instructor's presence —
"the focus of the course ... blah blah blah ..
. anyone, anyone?" — and are already tab
ulating the total all-nighters for the quarter.
The all-nighter equation is based purely on
the number of tests, papers and program
ming assignments.
At the end of the week you sit with your
booty, that big pile of syllabi, and meticu
lously select your courses with the sole aim
of minimizing all-nighter points. Of course,
each student has his or her own scale, but
generally it works out to about 1 point for
every f> pages of writing and 2/3 point for
each midterm.
For some reason, the 5-pager rarely war
rants an all-nighter, but the 6-pager tends to
be the critical breaking point.
Other important factors to consider
include the thesis (automatic 10 points),
upper-level programming classes (2-7
points per program) and lab classes (3/4
point per lab). Keep in mind that if your

point total is over 20. you'll have to kiss
your sweetie goodbye.
The actual all-nighter:
Science has yet to figure out why, hut for
some reason, this inevitably turns out to be
the same night that your friends are also
pulling all-nighters (probably for no other
reason than to /-write andy-talk you until 4
a.m. before the real work gets done).
Some of you might think having your
own computer and avoiding the brimming
dorm cluster is an escape from such difficul
ties. but think again! It often just means dis
tractions galore (i.e.. "I keep putting off that
mix I've been wanting to make, but now
seems like a good time to start, because I
can even keep working while I make the
tape," or "I can't really be productive unless
I have a clean desk, vacuumed floor and
new answering machine message." Or
there's always the "I*ll have pizza delivered
right to my room so I can continue diligent
ly working and not waste time biking to
Late Nite, going down to the kitchen or
driving to Happy D's" justification.) Yeah,
right ... if you could really work so effi
ciently. would you really be pulling an all
nighter in the first place?
Sunrise:
This is the pinnacle moment of the all
nighter, and one of the greatest epiphanies
one can experience in life. The rhythm of
nature, the cycle of birth and decay and the
sound of the garbage truck delivering food
to the dining hall usher in a fresh new day.
I bet even the so-called "Curve-Destroy
ing Ruthless Cutthroat Hard-core Raging

All-Nighter Every Night Never-Leave-the-
Room Ultra-Competitive Premeds," I've
heard so much about take time to enjoy the
sunrise. The point is that an all-nighter is
not complete without respect for the sun
rise. This is not to say that an all-nighter is
incomplete if the morning is cloudy or
foggy, but the sunrise does add a special
touch of triumph ... veni. vedi. vici!
What constitutes an all-nighter?
A friend of mine proposes three types of
all-nighters: "SAN." "FAN" and "HAN."
The first is pretty straight forward — the
"Study All-Nighter" when preparing for a
paper, program or midterm. More enjoy
able is the "Fun All-Nighter" — i.e., talking
with Iriends into the wee hours, going to a
rave, etc. The last one requires no descrip
tion — the "Hormonal All-Nighter."
Taking this all-nighter hoopla to the next
step has definite possibilities. I can foresee
the day when there will be an "alt.all
nighters" newsgroup. It will have exclusive
late night chatrooms and an all-nighters
Web page with a counter proudly bragging
about how many people in universities
across the country are pulling an all-nighter
on the same night. Some guy from Mi l will
be the MVP — "This is my 14th all-nighter
in the last two weeks!" And someone from
Hall State will be registering for the first
time — "YES! I'm so proud of myself,
tonight's my first all-nighter" ... and some
grad student will be running the Web site.
