Avoid war with Iraq
I am very concerned about the situation
that is developing as a result of President
Clinton's position toward Iraq. The situa
tion is very different from Desert Storm
when another country was invaded.
There has been little, credible evidence
that significant quantities of chemical or
biological weapons exist in Iraq. Even if
these weapons of mass destruction existed,
there is no evidence that the Iraqis have
capable delivery systems to make these
weapons a significant threat.
Clinton is pursuing this foreign policy
position largely as a political matter. It can
not be effectively argued that this is an
action to advance United Nations sanctions.
If the United States conducts military
strikes under the auspices of the U.N., it
should do so as a result of an edict of the
Security Council.

At minimum Russia, France and China
will veto such military action. A majority of
member states are similarly opposed to
such action at this time. There is no IJ.N.
mandate.
Unlike the situation in Desert Storm,
Iraq presently poses no significant threat to
l).S. interests in the Middle East. Allies like
Saudi Arabia and Turkey oppose military
action. There is no more threat to Israel at
this time than at any other time in its histo
ry. In the absence of a I J.N. mandate or spe
cific significant threats to U.S. regional
interests, it can only be assumed that Clin
ton is pursuing this policy to increase public
approval after his image has been damaged
by the sex scandals.
The proposed war policy has flawed
objectives and would be ineffective. Mili
tary action limited to airstrikes would be
unlikely to eliminate weapons of mass
destruction or to topple Sadd;im Hussein.
This has been conceded in the Central Intel
ligence Agency's congressional testimony.
Airstrikes without ground support would
not meet the stated objectives.
It is unlikely that bombing will be "pin
prick' bombing as it was in Desert Storm.
This could significantly damage U.S. rela

tions and prestige. Dangerously, there is no
defined endpoint. This could prolong the
war and lead to escalation.
Possible consequences of airstrikes and
acts of war include: an Iraqi strike against
Israel, an Israeli response (possibly involv
ing limited tactical nuclear weapons) ;ind
Russian assistance to the Iraqis.
This last possibility is of particular con
cern. The Russian bear is not dead; it has
been wounded and is hibernating. Russia is
owed biihons by the Iraqis and has seen its
influence diminish in the world.
I he Russians are separated from Iraq by
only a short distance. Russia could "liber
ate" Iraq and make it a satellite as it did to
much of Eastern Europe after World War
11. This would result in Russian access to the
Persian (iulf. This would destabilize the
regional and global balance of power. U.S.
economic security might be significantly
threatened.
President Yelsin's warnings about the
onset of World War 111 (stated twice last
week) deserve attention. The Clinton
administration would be well served to
review the origins of world war before
threats and reckless military action are pur
sued for largely political reasons. Is Monica

Lewinsky a present day Gavrilo Princip?
As George Santayana said, "Those who
forget the lessons of history are doomed to
repeat them."
What is needed now is responsible lead
ership by the administration. Leadership is
not only the willingness and ability to take
action when action is indicated; it is also the
wisdom and discretion to exercise restraint
and engage in diplomacy.
The administration is presently in a cri
sis. There may come a time when action
against Hussein and Iraq may be appropri
ate. However, this is not that time. Histori
ans will judge Clinton's administration by
its willingness to pursue negotiations, its
resolve to restart stalled Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks and its discretion in baeking
away from this affair.
