# A 						HUSHED TOPIC BROUGHT TO LIGHT
## Setting personal boundaries 
### 
SEXUAL ASSAULT IS a topic many of us
would like to keep behind closed doors. We
want to do so because it hits too close to home,
because we are afraid of discussing it, or because we
are just more comfortable if we assume that it could
never happen to us.
When we do talk about it as a community, it is usu
ally in a mandatory dorm discussion or in response to
a specific incident brought to the public eye. Sexual
assault in this way becomes isolated — an exception
to the rule on an otherwise safe campus.
I his mentality is unrealistic and ignores the broad
significance of the issue. In the Stanford Rape
Education Project administered an anonymous sur
vey to over 2.(KH) Stanford students.
I he survey's purpose was to determine how many
of them had experienced unwanted sexual activity as
a result of the use of physical force, alcohol, drugs or
verbal pressure.
Thirty-seven percent of graduate women. 16 per
cent of graduate men, 2 l ) percent of undergraduate
women and 10 percent of undergraduate men report
ed that they had experienced at least one incident of
attempted rape or sexual coercion. For over half of
the women and a third of the men who responded to
the survey, the incident(s) they reported had occurred
at Stanford.
Almost all of them knew their assailant. Only 2
percent of these survivors reported their incidents to
the police and only 10 percent of the women and 27
percent of the men told anyone about what they had
experienced.
Although statistics can seem lar removed from
reality, these numbers point to a problem we need to
address. It is not enough just to react to the incidents
that we hear about.
We also need to support the survivors we may not
know. We need to change the campus culture that
makes it possible for so many students to experience
sexual assault in silence.
, , (.'.hanging JiKfic statistics, means changing our
stereotypes sexual assault and sexuality in
general. We are taught that rape is committed by an
armed stranger in a dark alley. As Esther Park and
Mary Kathrvn Harcombe stated in their letter to the
editor last Thursday, the reality of rape is that most
assaults are committed by someone the survivor
already knows — a friend, romantic partner or family
member.
It is important to validate all survivors of assaults.
In terms of campus awareness, however, we need to
look at the fact that most of the survivors surveyed by
the Rape Education Project knew their assailants.
The fact that a large percentage of them reported that
their assault occurred at Stanford also means that
they were probably raped or coerced by other Stan
lord students.
In my own activism against sexual assault, this fact
is one of the hardest things to deal with. I am coming
to terms with the tragic reality that I will know and
interact with a lot of survivors of sexual assault in my
lifetime. I have a Kit more trouble acknowledging that
I will also meet many of the people who have com
mitted these assaults.

This points to one of the crucial harriers prevent
ing us from dealing with sexual assault at Stanford To
do so would mean recognizing that sexual assault is
not just the problem of those who experience it. but
that it is a problem for our community. Preventing
sexual assault in our community would require re
evaluating the way we live our lives.
Some of this work lies in education — in publiciz
ing statistics and giving students the tools to avoid
risky situations through orientation programs and
self-defense classes.
Preventing rape also means questioning the con
ceptions of masculinity and femininity which preach
that women should be the passive recipients and men
the aggressors in consensual sexual interaction. We
need to question the homophobia and gender roles
that lead us to assume that all assault is committed by
men against women.
We need to learn how to support survivors and
how to use the resources available to us. We need to
learn how to talk about sexuality openly,
expressing our own wants and needs
to others in a healthv way.
