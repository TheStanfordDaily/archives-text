In dining halls accented with cardinal and white
tablecloths, students dined with University adminis
trators last night in Manzanita Dining Commons and
Wilbur. Stern and Florence Moore Halls.
The event, organized by the ASSU Senate,
brought administrators and ASSIJ senators to resi
dences to discuss student issues and answer questions.
"Students complain that it's hard to get to know
faculty, but sometimes it's as hard lor faculty to get to
know students." said Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldtvar, who ate with students in
Rinconada.
"I usually do this at least once a year," said Saidi
var. a former resident fellow. "1 miss being in the
dorms."
Kelly Denton-Borhaug, associate dean of religious
life, also praised the program.
"It's a great idea," she said. "Small groups get peo

pie talking."
ASSI Senate Deputy Chair Matt Spence ex
plained the ASSIJ's desire to promote student ad
ministration interaction.
"We wanted to help students figure out how deci
sions are made." Spence said. "We modeled the event
on Faculty Night â€” a casual conversation between
students and administrators."
Spence credited the ASSU freshman senators for
organizing the event.
"I thought it went very well, considering that this
the lirst time we've done this and considering that
those of us who organized it are freshmen." said fresh
man senator Jack Wang.
Student reaction was overwhelmingly positive.
"It was nice to find the administrators so ap
proachable." said Otero freshman Li/ Salas.

have a number of questions about tuition and schol
arships." said freshman Julie I /u.
