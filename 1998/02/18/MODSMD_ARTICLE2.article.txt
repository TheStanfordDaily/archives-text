### Dana Mulhauser Evan Nordby Contributing writers 
In dining halls accented with cardinal and white
tablecloths, students dined with University adminis
trators last night in Manzanita Dining Commons and
Wilbur. Stern and Florence Moore Halls.
The event, organized by the ASSU Senate,
brought administrators and ASSIJ senators to resi
dences to discuss student issues and answer questions.
"Students complain that it's hard to get to know
faculty, but sometimes it's as hard lor faculty to get to
know students." said Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldtvar, who ate with students in
Rinconada.
"I usually do this at least once a year," said Saidi
var. a former resident fellow. "1 miss being in the
dorms."
Kelly Denton-Borhaug, associate dean of religious
life, also praised the program.
"It's a great idea," she said. "Small groups get peo

pie talking."
ASSI Senate Deputy Chair Matt Spence ex
plained the ASSIJ's desire to promote student ad
ministration interaction.
"We wanted to help students figure out how deci
sions are made." Spence said. "We modeled the event
on Faculty Night — a casual conversation between
students and administrators."
Spence credited the ASSU freshman senators for
organizing the event.
"I thought it went very well, considering that this
the lirst time we've done this and considering that
those of us who organized it are freshmen." said fresh
man senator Jack Wang.
Student reaction was overwhelmingly positive.
"It was nice to find the administrators so ap
proachable." said Otero freshman Li/ Salas.
"I'm excited to have this opportunity because I
have a number of questions about tuition and schol
arships." said freshman Julie I /u.
At Stern. Vice Provost for Student Affairs James

Montova took questions from a lull table of residents
I-arkin freshman Sara Auld expressed concern
about the transition from a small high school into the
world ol Stanford.
"Its intimidating.. . . you have to he an over
achiever among overachievers to stand out." she said.
In response. Montova encouraged students to he
come involved in campus organizations and to get to
know their professors. He related a stor\ from his
freshman year at Stanford in the mid-19705, describ
ing his fust visit to the office of now Assoc Dean of
Chemistry Hans Christian Andersen I hough ner
vous. he w;is rewarded, he said.
Another freshman. Danny Jacobs, said he was in
terested in meeting faculty members but felt like he
needed specific reasons to \ isit their offices
"I can't just knock on his door and sa\. Hi. I'm a
freshman. Share your thoughts with me.'
Al another table I)i in <>t \iliiikmhik :irwf I m .n
cial Aids Robert kinnallv dis
cussed what he looks for in Stan
lord applicants. Cliff S/u. a Twain
junior, offered the case of his sis
ter, a high school junior.
"She has the standard 4.0, but
everyone does now. What do you
look for in the application?" he
asked.
"Doing something just to try to
stand out is not a good goal," Kin
nallv responded. "Be yourself."
"An application I read today
was from a student who was in
volved in two clubs until 12th
grade. Then, whoop, suddenly
seven clubs, a half-hour each," he
said, questioning this applicant's
true interests.
"Tell us directly or subtly that
you love to learn." Kinnallv said.
"Seventeen-year-olds don't save
nations."
In Wilbur, student questions
ranged from serious inquiries
about classes and majors to light
hearted queries about University
President Gerhard Casper's sense
of humor.
"(Casper's) really hilarious,"
answered Asst. to the President
Jacqueline Wender. "He's great —
one of the best bosses I've had."
Dean of Earth Sciences
Franklin Orr discussed the effects
of El Nino with a group of rain
drenched students.
"All this wet weather comes
from the convergence of two jet
streams." Orr explained.
Most questions, though, had
more to do with the administra
tors' job descriptions.
"1 got a lot of questions on what
it is 1 actually do." Wender said.
"All I can say in response is that
this is the most varied job I've had
in my life because I never know
what Ill be dealing with."
Assoc. Dean of Religious Life
Maurice Charles also fielded many
questions about his official duties.
"T he most frequent question I

got tonight — the most frequent
question I always get — is: 'What
exactly does a University chaplain
do?' " he said.
With those gathered around his
table, Saldivar discussed the im
portance of faculty / student inter
action.
"1 tell [students] that the most
important thing is to get to know
faculty through small classes,"
Saldivar said. "Take freshman
seminars and take advantage of the
opportunities that current upper
classmen didn't have as freshmen."
Finding an opportunity for stu
dents to interact with University
officials was a concern echoed hv
Charles.
"As an administrator, unless
you have the time to do some de
liberate dorm programming, or
unless you're part of the crisis
team, you don't get to interact with
students," he said.
" This was a wonderful opportu
nity to meet students in a relaxed
setting," Residence Dean Lisa
Webb agreed.
Many of the administrators
found themselves asking as many
questions as they answered.
"I've been giving more ques
tions than I've been getting, be
cause that's where the fun lies."
Wender said.
Some administrators took this
opportunity to ask for student
feedback on University life.
"As the residence dean. I'm cu
rious about what people think
about their dorms, how they like
their roommates," Webb said.
Some questions, however, were
less directly related to the officials'
jobs.
"I always wondered whether it
was actually true that no one dated
at Stanford." Charles said. "This
was my chance to find out."
In the end, though, perhaps the
part of the evening that left the
keenest impression was the food.
"Even after being an RF for a
year, the food sort of gets to me
every time I come into the dining
hall." Saldivar said.
