IT CAN happen to anyone, regardless of age, class,
race or gender. However, because the overwhelm
ing majority of rapes are committed by men and the
victim is typically a woman. I will refer to the rapist as
"he" and the survivor as "she."

Sexual assault is not a subject
that everyone feels comfort
able tulking about. We all

know that sexual
assaults happen.
We know the

statistics
► from "The
Real

World.
' One out ot
three women
will be assault-

ed m her lifetime
and one out of five or
six men will he assaulted.
Yet. for every rape that is

reported, somewhere between six

and 10 rapes go unreported. W In ' 1 here are
two main reasons win a sexual assault sur\i\or max not
report the incident: difficulty labeling the incident and
fear of other people s reactions. In c >5 percent ot the
rape cases on college campuses, the rapist knows the

victim. I hat makes it difficult for the survivor to recog
nize it as a sexual assault, much less do anything about
it Why would a survivor want to admit that someone
who she knows would hurt her so deeply'.' This is espe
cially true when the rapist is someone that she loves like
a partner, spouse, best friend or brother. How does the
survivor reconcile the tact that someone she loved and
trusted has abused her .'
A survivor may come up with many reasons to con
vince herselt that the incident was not sexual assault
She could tell herselt that she shouldn't have led him on
She might sa\ to herself that he didn't hear her or thai
she wasn't clear in her protests But even if she doc
admit it to herself, reporting the assault will hurt th«
assailant. When someone you love has done somethinj
wrong, it is difficult to report it. especially when vol
know that he will suiter greatly lor what he's done.
A friend ol mine was raped at Stanford. Rut sh«
never reported the assault to the authorities because sht
didn t want her rapist kicked out of school in his senioi
year.
It can also be verv difficult to define whether ar
action qualifies as sexual assault I here are manv gray
areas involved. However, even if the couple has had sex
previously, even earlier in the evening, an unconsensual
act ol intercourse is still rape. It is also sexual assault
when a man gets a woman drunk in order to have sex
with her. It is sexual assault when a woman is touched
against her will.
A survivor mav convince herself that it was not sex
ual assault because she didn't sav "no." or because she
was the one who initiated the kissing. The survivor ma\
think that il it wasn't rape, then it doesn't count. Yet in
all of these instances, it is a sexual assault.
Another reason that a survivor mav not report the
incident is tear of other's reactions. People like to
believe in a just world. Thev like to think that if a
woman was raped, it was because she probably brought
it on herself.
I his has disastrous implications tor the survivor.
People mav speculate about her behavior prior to the
assault. Did she let him into her room late .it night? \\ as
she flirting'.' Was she dressed provocatively.' In effect,
thev blame the survivor for the crime It is difficult to
lace the facts it vou or one of vour triends is assaulted,
lo reduce stress, we mav distance ourselves Ironi the
