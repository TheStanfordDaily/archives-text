How should I approach someone who 1
think may have an eating disorder?

A Dear Reader,
Approaching someone whom you suspect
to have an eating disorder is a delicate mat
ter. Previous experience in this field tells us
that those suffering from eating disorders are easily
made uncomfortable by the mention of certain
words, phrases, implications or accusations.
Being especially careful about the words you
choose and the tact with which you employ them
could mean the difference between someone open
ing up to you with his or her problem or completely
shutting you out.
Perhaps one of the best things that you can do is
consult a professional Registered Dietician or physi
cian about the person you suspect may have an eat
ing disorder. Explain to them the symptoms which
make you suspicious and try to answer all of the
diagnostic questions they may ask you about your
friend completely and truthfully.
Such a professional will also be able to help you
decide the best way for you to approach your friend
in the most gentle and unthreatening manner. In
general, here are a few guidelines:
— Avoid talking about food and weight; the disorder
may be symptomatic of deeper issues
— Assure them that they are not alone and that you
care about them
— Never try to force them to cat
— Refrain from assigning blame to anyone or any
thing
— Refrain from being accusatory
— Encourage them to seek help from a professional
therapist
