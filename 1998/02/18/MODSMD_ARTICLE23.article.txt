Radiation risky therapy for
endometrial cancer
A new study chaired by Prof, of Gynecology
and Obstetrics James Roberts raises doubts over
the effectiveness of a commonly used radiation
therapy technique for treating endometrial cancer.
Endometrial cancer, which afflicts about 36,000
women every year, is a cancer of the uterus lining
and causes about 6,(XX) deaths yearly. A common
treatment for the disease has been to give full
pelvic radiation therapy after surgery to prevent
recurrence.
This treatment, however, may have very limit
ed utility after accounting for the risks involved.
"From a purely statistical standpoint, full pelvic
radiation is better (than no radiation after the
surgery), but if you factor in the costs and the
alternative methods that are available, then it may
not be that helpful," Roberts said.
The study showed that women have a lower
recurrence rate when given full radiation treat
ment. However, that gain is small enough to be
offset by the numerous negative effects of the
treatment.
Full pelvic radiation therapy involves a large
dose of radiation delivered across the pelvic
region by an external beam. Possible side effects
of the five-week, 28-treatment program include
diarrhea, anemia, fatigue, bowel obstructions
requiring surgical bypass and in rare cases, death.
The study showed that after surgery, women
treated with radiation had only a 3 percent chance
of cancer recurrence within two years while those
without the treatment had a 13 percent chance of
cancer recurrence. These results suggest a signifi
cant correlation between radiation, treatment and
recurrence rates. However, 2 to 4 percent of those
who take the radiation treatment also develop
serious side effects.
An alternative to full pelvic radiation treatment
is vaginal radiation which administers smaller
doses of radiation in a more directed fashion.
Rather than a beam of radiation across the pelvic
region, a small dose of radiation is locally deliv
ered directly into the vagina.
The study recommends this procedure, which
rarely has any side effects, for women in an inter
mediate risk group. In addition, the procedure
requires a shorter treatment lime and is less
expensive than the full pelvic treatment which can
cost between $10,000 and $50,000.
