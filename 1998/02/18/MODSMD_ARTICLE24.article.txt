When El Nino finally roared into town two weeks
ago, fast action was needed to save thousands of
books in the flooded basements of the (ireen and
Meyer Libraries. Staff and student volunteers worked
feverishly into the morning to box the wet books and
remove them from the soggy basements.
Book bindings absorb water readily, quickly
swelling and buckling much like wet particle board.
According to Herman Betchart of Restoration Man
agement Company in Fremont, there is a narrow win
dow of one to two days within which to work before
the waterlogged books are permanently damaged.
Beyond that, an explosion of mold will quickly
destroy them.
To prevent mold and further swelling, the first pri
ority is to freeze all of the 7(),(M)() to 80.000 wet books
as quickly as possible. According to Catherine Tier
ney, assistant University librarian for technical ser
vices, the wet books were whisked off to a cold-stor
age facility in Union City and frozen within 36 hours.
Once frozen, attention could be focused on drying out
the library and trying to salvage the frozen books.
A vacuum freeze-drying process is most common
ly used to restore books, explained Walter Henry,
assistant conservator of University libraries at Stan
ford. The frozen books are usually placed on open
shelves in a vacuum chamber, which is then pumped
to a low vacuum.
They are kept frozen, but enough heat is applied to
force the frozen water to convert, or "sublime." into
water vapor without an intervening liquid phase. Vac
uum pumps remove the water vapor from the vacuum
chamber and maintain the vacuum.
Freeze-dried books emerge from the process com
pletely dry. but stay in the exact si/e and shape as
when they were frozen. If the books were swollen or
warped before they were
frozen, they will come out
of the freeze-dryer
swollen or
How-

ever. they can be rehumidified and individually
pressed back into shape.
According to Henry, the 54,000 books from Meyer
that were water damaged in a W7K flood were pro
cessed in this way with good results. But it took the
equivalent of eight full-time people a total of nine
months to complete the process.
Document reprocessors of Burlingame is one of
the companies bidding for the contract to restore the
damaged books from Green. They have developed
and patented a modified version of the freeze-drying
technique, called the Thermaline Process, which corn
bines the freeze-drying and pressing stages

higher pressure than that used by other free/e-dr\
operators and are heated to about 32 degrees Fahren
