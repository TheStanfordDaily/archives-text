## Stanford reaps royalties from inventions 
### Krishna Rangarajan 
With the expiration of the Cohen-Boyer patent
for recombinant DNA last December, Stanford's
patent and royalty system has drawn increased
attention. The royalties from the patent have been a
steady source of University revenue for more than a
decade. As a result of the latest expiration, the
Office of Technology Licensing — which is respon
sible for patenting and licensing University tech
nologies — will see its revenues fall steeply in 1998.
Founded in 1970 by Niels Reimer. the licensing
office's mission is to "promote the transfer of Stan
ford technology for society's use and benefit while
generating unrestricted income to support research
and education."
The office receives invention proposals from fac
ulty and then decides whether or not to patent
them. Net royalties are split three ways among the
University, the department and the inventor after
the office deducts its share.
Certainly, the major purpose of patenting inven
tions is to generate royalties. The licensing office, in
trying to marry commerce and research, often
chooses not to pursue a patent for a particular
invention because it lacks commercial potential.
However, sifting through even a small number ol
the hundreds of patents obtained through the office
reveals many fascinating inventions and discoveries
While none of them are as lucrative as the Cohen-
Boyer patent, all are testaments to the brilliance
and ingenuity of Stanford researchers.
The seeds of the Cohen-Boyer discovery were
sown at a conference in Waikiki. Hawaii where
Stanley Cohen of Stanford and Herbert Boyer of
UC-San Francisco both attended. Cohen had been
studying bacterial plasmids circular forms of
DNA which can self-replicate while Boyer was
involved with restriction en/ymes enzymes that
recogni/e and cleave a specific sequence of DNA

nucleotides.
The two researchers conjectured that by combin
ing their findings, it might he possible to insert a
DNA string into a bacterial plasnnd, insert the plas
mid into a living organism and thus have the organ
ism reproduce the foreign DNA.
After working together for only four months, the
pair had successfully cloned their first piece of
DNA. They published their results in November
1973. Patenting the technology was a controversial
eight-year process. Eventually, however, the tech
nology was disseminated into the biotech industry
making possible such products as human insulin,
which is used to treat diabetes, and tissue plasmino
gen activator, which i"> administered to heart attack
patients.
Another famous Stanford invention was "FM
synthesis." an algorithm invented in the earh 1970s
by John Chowning. now a professor til music and
director of the Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics. I'he algorithm pa\ed the wax
for a new type of electronic synthesizer. Earlier syn
thesizers used analog oscillators to produce sound
waves that then could be filtered to produce various
tones.
Chowning's algorithm modulates two "pure
tones" (or frequencies) together to produce new
tones. The technology was eventually licensed to
Yamaha who used it to produce, among other prod
ucts, the DX-7, the world's first fully digital musical
synthesizer. The patent eventually raised more than
$20 million for the University.

however, illustrates that not all patents, no matter
how impressive, will be lucrative. In 1975, Sherby
attempted and succeeded in making a "superplastic
steel." a material that can be twisted into complex
shapes and patterns when hot. but stays extremely
strong and durable when cooled to n>om tempera
ture. "We imagined a mini-revolution in the steel

"[The licensing office] is extremely sensitive to

Even more importantly. "I don't have to deal with
any of the business aspects."
