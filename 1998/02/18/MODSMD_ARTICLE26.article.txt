### Allison Otto Staff writer 
From the outset. St. Mary's must have seen ii as an impossible mission.
Beat the undefeated top-ranked Stanford baseball squad (KM) 1) at
Sunken Diamond. Beat the squad that swept the Gaels last season by scores of
18-6 and KM), the squad that leads the series 37-8 and is do mi,v "
renowned pitching arsenal.
And it proved to be impossible, as the Cardinal topped • H.-
Gaels 11-5 last night to maintain a perfect record . The nighi
belonged to the Stanford offense, which combined for 11
runs and 12 hits.
Sophomore first baseman John Gall tallied the ("ardi
nal's solo homer for the evening, while junior centerfielder
Jodv Gerut and sophomore rightfielder Nick Day combined for three steals.
But the victory illustrated that even the Cardinal bullpen is susceptible to
faults as the younger aces ironed out kinks in their pitching performances.
Stanford worked the depth of its arsenal as five pitchers took to the mound
before veteran reliever Tony C ogan, a junior, stepped in toclose out the game.
"From a pitcher's perspective. 1 thought we showed that potentially we
have great depth in our bullpen, but it's very much unproven," sophomore
pitcher Geoff Linville said. "We walked a lot of people, more than should ever
be walked. I think we struggled, throwing strikes just because the pitchers
that were out there were inexperienced and uncomfortable on the mound."
For the record, there were 21 walks during the 3 hour. 46 minute con
test. 14 of those belonging to the Cardinal.
The Gaels struggled, too. as the bottom of their lineup — com"'
of sophomore outfielder Tom Nichols, sophomore infielder
Tommy ("alien and senior infielder Dan Graff — walked or
struck out in 12 appearances at bat.
Despite the problems, the Cardinal showed moments of great
ness.
