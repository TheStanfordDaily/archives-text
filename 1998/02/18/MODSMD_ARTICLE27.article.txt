Although the Cardinal will not participate in
the season-ending national tournament, it has
been invited to the four-team Pacific 8 C ontorenee
Tournament. Following a string of three consecu
tive indecisive series splits. Stanford wanted to

gain momentum tor the postseason.

that — but not without some difficult)
After establishing a 5-0 lead in Friday's series
opener, Stanford lost focus and control of the
game. Despite a comeback h\ the Golden Bears,
the Cardinal held on for a 7-4 victory
"Friday's game was sloppily
played," said senior defenseman
Paul Heneman. "We weren't real
happv with the way we let Cal back
into the game. We were inconsistent
and should've done much better."
From the outset, it appeared that
Saturday's contest would be no dif
ferent. Altera rough first period,the
score was tied 1-1.
"We went into the locker room
upset with ourselves," said senior
team captain Evan Asano. "We
knew we were a much better team
than Cal— we had dominated them
all season long. We just needed toget
our act together in the last two peri
ods."
And they did just that.
Behind the spectacular play of
Asano, who tallied four goals and an
assist, the Cardinal pounced on the
Bears and waltzed to an 8-2 win.
The contest was a turning point
for Stanford and, in particular,
Asano. The senior forward was side
lined for six weeks in the fall with a
broken hand.
"Sitting on the sidelines and
watching my team was one of the
most frustrating things I have ever
had to do," Asano said. "1 wanted to
get on the ice and help the team out
in close games, and not being able to
do that was extremely difficult."
Asano was cleared to return to
the ice at the beginning of winter
quarter. I lowever. he was unable to

return to top form right away.
"I was disappointed with my per
formance in the winter," Asano said.
"After the time off, I was a little out
of sync and was not all that effec
tive."
I le clearly broke out of the slump
this weekend against the Golden
Bears.
"It felt really good to contribute
again and play at the level I know I
am capable of. 1 was happy for my
self but, more important for the
team, that we were able to get it back
together and have a solid perfor
mance."
Stanford picked a perfect time to
find the winning formula, with the
Pac-8 tournament fast approaching.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will face
UCLA in the first round. Although
the Bruins are in its conference,
Stanford has not played them yet this
season due to scheduling conflicts.
"They are a well-coached team,"
Heneman said. "We feel that we are
more talented than UCLA and hope
that our skill players can step up and
lead us to victory."
Assuming a victory, Stanford will
play the winner of the Oregon-USC
game in the finals. And since the
Trojans received the national tour
nament berth instead of the Card,
Stanford has something to prove in
the conference tournament.
"Ideally, we would love to play
USC' in the finals of the Pac-8 tour
nament." Asano said. "We feel that
we are a better team than they are
and want to prove to everyone that
we deserved to eo to nationals."
