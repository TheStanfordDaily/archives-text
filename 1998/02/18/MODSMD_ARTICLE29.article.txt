### 
In of the violent tone
Vanessa has developed, we decided
to take a safer route thus week
Vanessa seems to be irritated with
most of my questums. so we \ e de
cided to turn our >n onto
an innocent bystander none
other than our vers own All-Amer

Va to loosen the ropes ' I promise

are getting cramped.
\ a: W hat's up. dawg '
Folkl: Chillin . m\ Baby Hands
friend
Kohin: Ok. now that we've ex
changed pleasantries, let's delve
into the secrets of what makes
Folkl such a world-class athlete
\a: Yes. question No 1 Spandex
what's the deal?
Folkl: I've found through count
less trial and error that strict com
pression around the quad and
hamstring enhances my fast-twitch
muscle fibers, allowing me to out
jump m\ competitors.
Kohin: Really' ITus must be the
best-kept secret in sports
\ a: Cut the crap. Folkic You )ust
like to show off your bum
Robin: Well, why don't we take
this in another direction?
\ a: I ine Kristin, what do vou find
the biggest difference is between
basketball and volleyball?
Folkl: I lie biggest difference is

that in basketball you can take
over the game because \ou have
unlimited touch on the ball
Kohin: So \ou like being the ball
hog. huh?
hilkl: W ell. that's not exactly what
I meant. 1 feel 1 can.
\a: C)nee again, cut the crap ITie
thing you like about basketball is
\ou get to hit people! Why do \ou
think I pla\ ?
holkl: W eil. \ev it's true. Basket
ball d<K's possess a certain \ lolence
that di>es not exist in volleyball.
Hut 1 pride myself in transcending
this barbaric disnla\ and makinti

the sport beautiful not onl\ tor
the fans but lor all mankind.
\a: Give me a minute I think
I 'm going to puke
Kohin: OK. but sta\ away from the
keyboard. And tr\ to be nice toour
guest We don't suppress dissent
ing opinions here: We formulate
unfounded ones
holkl: I've had enough of \out
shenanigans. 1 )on't make me pum
mel you ou don't want the wrath
of the Man Hands
Kohin: Before this completely de
teriorates. let's ask another ques
tion \ a. can I trust you with this.'
\a: ()t course. Robin lam always
a lady Kristin, if you eould partic
ipate in one Winter Olympic
event, what event would it be?
holkl: 1 would want to he a figure
skater because I could wear an
even more revealing outfit than I
do in volleyball
\a: Are you sure \ou wouldn't
prefer luge or speed skating? You
could wear full-body spandex.
Kohin: Besides, you're a little big


Robin

Kristin
Folkl
Vanessa
Nygaard
for figure skating.
Va: Yeah, who'd be your partner
Andre the Giant?
Robin: Isn't he dead?
Va: Yeah, right, and so is Tupac.
Folkl: Can you guys stop picking or
me? I think I'm going to cry.
Robin: Va. didn't we determine tha
figure skating isn't a sport?
Va: Shut up. I'm picking on Folkl.
Folkl: I ve had just about enough o
this. Can I go?
Robin: OK. one last question.

Va: Kristin, in the tradition of Bar
bara Walters. I would like to ask you.
if you were a fruit, what fruit would
you be and why?
Folkl: What the hell kind of question
is that? I thought you were profes
sionals here. I'm gone.
Robin: Well that was your first mis
take. We prefer to think of ourselves
as visionary contemporaries.
Va: You'd better get back here and
answer the question, or we'll release
the hounds.
Folkl: OK. Ill answer, but only if you
promise to let me go. I would be a
coconut because they're mysterious.
Va: What does that mean?

Robin: Vanessa, it's not our place to
judge. Besides, do you really want to
know?
Folkl: I've had enough. Can I speak
to your editor?
Robin: No. but 1 guess that's a good
place to end. Kristin. I'd like to thank
you for being our guest and wish you
luck on the rest of the season.
Folkl: Yeah right. You'll be hearing
from my lawyers.
Va: Thanks for nothing. I hope I'm
guarding you tomorrow in practice.
