# Miranda headlocks the competition
## 
### Evan Meagher Contributing writer 
"So .. I still have a few frames
left," the photographer began. "Do
you want to. you know, do a few
glamour shots or anything?"
I cringed. I had just wrapped up
.in interview with Patricia Miranda
one dealing with, among other
things, how the only woman on the
Stanford wrestling team won the
respect of teammates and coaches
by toughing it out. And now the
photographer was suggesting a
glamour shot.
I started to mumble something,
trying to apologize, but she grace
fully interrupted.
"I'h. I think that would kind of
undermine everything I'm about."
Then she put me in a headlock.
Miranda began wrestling in
eighth grade as part of a gym class.
Most girls, it seems, opted for the
dance or fitness program, while the
boys wrestled and played football.

"1 tried [wrestling], and 1 liked
it." Miranda said. "I was always a
tomboy — 1 felt much more com
fortable playing b-ball with the
guys."
Miranda continued to wrestle in
high school in Saratoga, taking fifth
in the nationals her junior year and
third her senior year. She wrestles
freestyle, which is different from
the collegiate style of wrestling in
that it involves more throws and re
wards wrestlers for exposing their
opponent's back. Takedowns are
valued less than in collegiate
wrestling, while spectacular or risky
throws are valued higher.
"1 pay a lot of attention to tech
nique," Miranda said. "It probably
comes from wrestling guys, whom I
can't just overwhelm physically. 1
rely on confidence, technique and
outsmarting my opponent.
"It's very important that in the
space of six minutes. 1 analyze my
opponent's strengths and weak
nesses and then figure out how to

exploit them. I hat s how I wrestle."
I King that strategy in the 123.5-
pound weight elass. Miranda took
second place at the Aggie Open
and the Sunkisi International Tour
nament earlier this year. Both times
she lost in the championship match
to Stephanie Murata. the No. I
ranked woman in the world in her
weight class. Because ol strong per
formances like these, Miranda be
lieves she has a shot at making the
women's ()lympic team.
"In 2(KM),0r."?(X)4... I'll be there.
1 will be there." she said.
Miranda is similarly confident of
her ability to wrestle for the Stan
lord team. She would probably
compete in the 125-pound division
recently created by the NCAA
rules committee's new guidelines.
"I think I can do it." she said.
Miranda left Sunday for Sweden
and a two-week tour of Europe.
The U.S. women's national team
coaches selected her as one of three
wrestlers per weight class to train

and tour overseas. She'll be back
for the Pacific 10 Conference
( hampionships on Feb. 2N. But in
the meantime, she will concentrate
on training to springboard to the
next level.
"1 need the international experi
ence," Miranda said. "It'll be good
for me."
With all the success she has en
joyed in her brief time at Stanford,
it's easy to forget the hurdles she
faced as the first woman ever to try
out for and make the Cardinal
wrestling team. In a male-dominat
ed sport based entirely on physical
combat, it is no small task to over
come the traditional barriers of sex.
Aside from the sheer physical
challenge, though, Miranda also
had to face the possibility that the
team might reject her.
"Above all. I'd really like to just
thank the team," Miranda said. "I
was prepared for tension, but the
guys and the situation have been a
dream come true."
Indeed, Miranda joined the
team without incident and has been
roundly accepted.
"She is very coachable and is a
joy to work with." said Stanford
head coach Chris Horpel.
1 let teammates agree.
"I never had a girl on the team
when I was in high school, so I
didn't know how to deal with it,"
said freshman teammate Kayvon
Bina. "But then in the first week,
we were wrestling, and she threw
me a head butt. And that's when I
knew: She's for real."
What has really earned her
teammates' respect has been Mi
randa's unconditional willingness
to endure all the standard training
the team goes through.
"She's always there," said
sophomore Tim Kendall. "Our
wrestling room is crazy and ram
bunctious. kind of a no-holds
barred thing. But she's right there.
She's one of the members of the
team."
"You know she's legitimate be
cause she is doing the training right
there with you," Bina added.
