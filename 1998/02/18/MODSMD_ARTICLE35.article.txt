I he CiAP represents a clothing
store, a cultural icon and .1 Stanford
success story. I he (iAP's success is
well-known and is proven by the
amount of CiAP apparel found in
the closet of an\ random Stanford
student.
Hie chain has been so successful,
111 fact, that us empire includes over
2.0(H) (iAP stores. as well as the Ba
nana Republic and Old Na\> cloth
ing stores that ha\e .ill become a fix
ture in American culture.
I he CIAP storv owes its origins
to ;i Stanford alumna. Doris Fish
cr. who went on to become co
founder with her husband as well
as director of the CiAP. I oda\. she
is 011 the Stanford Hoard of
Trustees.
Last week. Fisher talked to se
niors .it a board's question-and-an
swer panel.
"A lot of alumni aren't in
volved. and that's disappointing."
she said.
In 1 l )53, Fisher was one of two
females w ho graduated from Stan
lord with an economics major. She
said she is pleased to see that the
situation for females at Stanford is
different today. Shortly after grad
uating. she married and went 011 to
have three boys.
"I'm a big homebody and was
lucky." Fisher explained. "M\ kids
went away to school, which 1 be
lieve cemented our relationship.
Today, we live within seven blocks
of each other."
Fisher and her husband started
CiAP in San Francisco in 1 %9
mainly because of their inability to
find Levi's jeans that fit at depart
ment stores. They then started a
franchise of these jeans and initial
ly sold music records as well. How -
ever. two months later, the records
were pulled from the store due to
shoplifting.
The sale of the Levi's clothing
carried them to moderate success,
but it wasn't until six years ago that

the CiAP started selling CiAP
brand clothing exclusively.
She attributes some of her suc
cess to the fact that she loves what
she does.
"You won't be happy if you
don't do w hat you w ant to do." she
said. "l njo\ your life, and don't
take anything too seriously."
She has learned from observa
tion that there is 110 alternative to
following your own ambition. Fish
er said that she's seen too many
people imitating their fathers and
grandfathers. I hey eventually go
back to school and follow through
with w hat thev initially wanted.
Although successful. Fisher is
not the stereotypical corporate
monster. Fisher feels that she's es
sentially the same person despite
the immense success she has experi
enced. 1 IcaviK involved in the fight
against cancer. Fisher has been a
huge contributor to cancer research,
as a number of her close relatives
have been victims ot this disease.
"People feel that i! it is out of
sight, it is out of mind," she said.
"And I don't agree with that."
The (iAP last year was the first
major clothing corporation to take
steps to improve its labor condi
tions in alleged sweatshops in El
Salvador.
"C )thcr corporations should fol
low suit and do the same." she said.
The CiAP, though immensely
popular, is not loved by all. It is
often criticized by a number of stu
dents. even those who shop there.
" The (iAP too often is shopped
by people in order to look like oth
ers. but this isn't the CiAP's fault."
said freshman Matt Oglander.
Others are fanatic about CiAP
clothing.
Adrienne Watt, a junior, says
"[The CiAP] has classic clothing,
which isn't for everyone, but it
works for me."
To these remarks, Fisher com
mented. "It's a great compliment
seeing someone wearing my cloth
ing."
