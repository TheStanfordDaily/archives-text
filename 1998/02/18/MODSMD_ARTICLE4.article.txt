speare Festival give a performance for Donner residents last night.
The pair performed modern interpretations of "Taming of the
Shrew" and"The Comedy of Errors" as well as a traditional version
of "Richard III."
by Shakespeare — in three the
aters. They also present classics,
new plays and on occasion, com
mission plays.
"The wonderful thing about
this as an actress is it's wonderful
to get out there without a set and
props and just have the words,"
McMahon said. She has partic
ipated in the program for 13 years
and enjoys bringing the language
to life for younger audiences.
The program sends out nine
pairs of actors to schools all over
the West Coast.
The groups typically perform
in high schools, but they also per
form for elementary schools and
colleges. They run the largest out
reach theater program in the
country.
The actors inserted modern
language into several of the scenes
to make the Shakespearean dia
logue more accessible. Freshman
Donner resident Tula Oruni will
be attending the festival with
Paulson later in the month and
said she is excited about seeing the
shows performed in full.
"I think that the production
was good, but it didn't need to be
catered to a younger audiences,"
Orum said. "I think that kids
would get it."
