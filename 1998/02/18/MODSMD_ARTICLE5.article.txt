## Businesses must be kinder to environment 
### Dan Arnold Contributing writer 
A balance must be struck be
tween the interests ot business and
the environment, said Paul
Maw ken. the founder ot the garden
retail and catalogue company
Smith & Haw ken
Maw ken spoke to an audience ol
3(H) at the (iraduatc School ol Hum
ness yesterday
"L\ery living system on earth is
in decline" while even indicator
tor business is on the rise, he said.
Furthermore. Maw ken observed
that "the rate at which |the decline
ot living systems] is accelerating
correlates roughly to the rate at
which we are materializing."
Despite the apparent cause
and-effcct relationship between in
dustry and environmental decline
Maw ken claimed that a prosperous
business and .1 healths environ
ment can coexist
"In my opinion, we are in the
middle ol an enormous transition.'
he said, which will lead to "a new
industrial age."
Me said that as society discovers
that natural resources not replace
able. new industry will be forced to
make better use of them

In the next N> to 70 years, he
said, the productivity ol natural re
sources could increase b\ up to 1 (M»
times.
Recycling and manufacturing
more efficient products can in
crease the number ol jobs in indus
trx as well as protect the environ
ment. Mawken said. Ihis would be
accomplished by shitting the em
phasis in the workplace from pri
man production, which uses large
amounts of energv but few work
ers. to secondary manufacturing,
which necessitates tar more work
eis but much less energv
Me said the shift toenvironmcn
tally sound business practices
would need lo be accompanied by a
reinterpretation of capitalism Ihe
new "natural capitalism" would
have to recogni/e the "free" natur
al resources such as air and
water that business consumes.
()ne of the first ways to put nat
ural capital hack on the balance
sheet of capitalism would be to stop
subsidizing the destruction of nat
ural resources through corporate
welfare, Mawken said
Me added that modern business
people must "completely re-imag-
ine and redesign" the world to
preserve and restore living sys
tems.
Hawken was the ninth person
to speak as the von Gugelberg
Memorial Lecturer on the Envi
ronment. an annual lecture estab
lished in memory ofConradin von
Gugelberg.
