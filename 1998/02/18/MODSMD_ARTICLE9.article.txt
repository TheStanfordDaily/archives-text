## 20-year-old cadet receives life sentence 
### 
FOR I WORTH, Texas (AP)
A jury convicted former Naval
Academy midshipman Diane
Zamora yesterday of killing a 16-
year-old romantic rival, rejecting her
defense that an abusive boyfriend
manipulated her into a confession.
The jury deliberated for six hours
Monday, then needed only minutes
yesterday morning to convict Zamo
ra, 20, of the Dec. 4. 1995, slaying of
Adrianne Jones. Jurors rejected less
er charges of kidnapping, assault and
false imprisonment.
Showing no emotion as the ver
dict was read, Zamora automatically
received a life sentence because
prosecutors were not seeking the
death penalty. She will be eligible for
parole after 40 years.
During the two-week trial,
Zamora tearfully told the jury that
she confessed to helping her
boyfriend kill his one-time lover
under duress. She said she had mere
ly memorized and repeated the
same statement given by then-fiance
David Graham, a former Air Force
Academy cadet.
The couple were high school
seniors at the time of the killing.
Both graduated with honors and

earned prestigious spots in military
academies the next year, she at the
Naval Academy, he at the Air Force
Academy. They were arrested in
September 1996 after Zamora's
academy roommates reported she
had admitted to a killing.
Jones' relatives addressed the
court after the verdict. Many in the
courtroom dabbed their eyes as they
spoke, but Zamora remained stone
faced.
"We all loved and enjoyed Adri
anne very much," said the girl's
father, Mill Jones, speaking slowly
while fighting his emotions. "We all
looked forward to a life with her
We will never know what heights
she would have (risen) to because of
this animal act. And we shall have to
wonder the rest of our lives."
Zamora admitted to the slaying
shortly after being arrested in
September 1996. Graham also was
taken into custody and faces trial
later this year.
In separate police interviews,
(iraham and Zamora gave similar
stories about driving Jones to a
remote lake, saying Zamora hit the
girl with a barbell and Graham shot
her as she tried to flee.


Diane Zamora holds hands with one of her defense attorneys, Jen
nifer Morris, as Judge Joe Drago reads the guilty verdict at the Tar
rant County Justice Center yesterday. Diane Zamora was convict
ed and sentenced to life in prison for the 1995 kidnap-slaying of
Adrianne Jones. Zamora received an automatic life sentence for
the crime.
