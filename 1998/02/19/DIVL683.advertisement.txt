Stanford Forum on the U.S.-Iraq Crisis
Thursday, Feb« 19 4:15-5:30 pm
History Room 205
As military action looms, what do you think about the U.S.-Iraq crisis?
• That Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and deserves what he gets?
• That the U.S. supports U.N. resolutions and is acting on principle?
• That the U.S. uses U.N. resolutions to safeguard its own interests?
1 million Iraqi civilians have died during the Oulf War and its
aftermath, and 5,500 children die every month as a result of the
sanctions against Iraq. Military action is deadly serious. Do we
want it? If you want to think about these issues, ask questions or
speak your mind, please Join us.
