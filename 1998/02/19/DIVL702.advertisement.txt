When Asian Women United of California gathered fiction and nonfiction by
Asian American women of many ethnicities in Making Waves (1989), the
group had no idea its collection would be adopted by educators, generating
enough royalties to fund video documentaries and other projects as well as
spadework for this new collection. From nearly a thousand submissions
received in response to requests through Asian American Studies programs
and community groups and media, an editorial advisory board selected just
under four dozen pieces—prose and poetry, fiction and nonfiction, essays,
memoirs, and reportage —filled, as the editors' preface suggests, "with sur
prises that open spaces for speaking about the past in new ways, as well as
for dreaming of alternative practices in the present and future." Making More
Waves is a collection as diverse as the communities whose voices It shares
and celebrates.
