### Robert Chiles Staff writer 
U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone delivered a speech last night
at Kresge Auditorium calling for increased dialogue be
tween citizens and grassroots activism.
"I love speaking at the University," said Wellstone, a
Democrat from Minnesota. The speech, titled "We Can
Do Better," was warmly received by a crowd of students,
faculty and community members from around the Bay
Area.
Wellstone, who was a professor for 21 years before be
coming a senator, came to Stanford with the goal of en
gaging students with political issues. "Your interest in pub
lic affairs is what captures my imagination." Wellstone de
clared.
According to Wellstone, politics in Washington "di
rectly affect people's lives." He argued that when people
do not become involved in government, the groundwork
is laid for special interests to play an increased role in pol
icy making.
Wellstone also took time to discuss how his own politi
cal beliefs had been formed and how lie overcame 7-to-l
odds to win his seat in I WO.
The son of a Russian Jewish immigrant, Wellstone said
he was raised on books and ideas. He also became in
volved in the civil rights movement. "I saw ordinary peo
ple make history."
Wellstone believed he earned his seat in the Senate
with honesty and a stick-to-the-issues campaign. "Really,
very few people thought we would win. We had a tremen
dous grassroots effort.
"We treated people with respect," Wellstone said of his
campaign. Instead of mud-slinging, he said he gave a lot of
•'talking head ads."
'j "I called all the students that I had given A's to." Well
stone jested, pleading with them. "Now it's your turn to
help me."
Wellstone said that Walter Mondale approached him

after his victory and commented. "The students won it for
you."
During his term, Wellstone has traveled across the na
tion gathering the thoughts and opinions of Americans
from East Los Angeles, Calif, to Delta, Miss.
"One of the things I learned is that politics has very lit
tle to do with our idea of left, right and center." he said.
"All of us focus on making decent lives."

Wellstone championed the public school system in Bal
timore, arguing that despite poor facilities, the schools had
small class si/es and "didn't give up on a single child." The
proper spark. Wellstone claimed, "can take a child from
any background to Stanford or Berkeley."
Among Wellstone's list of top issues — human rights.

as the root of the problem.

In regards to getting legislation

gued, "You've got to have a con

other hand, "if you organize without
the policy, you have activity without
direction."
"Politics is what we create by
what we do, what we hope for and
what we dare to imagine," Well
