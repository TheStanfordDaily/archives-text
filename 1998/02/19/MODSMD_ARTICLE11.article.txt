# Town hall meeting turns ugly
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
administration expected a lively,
but civil, discussion of its Iraq poli
cy at a town hall meeting yesterday
on the campus of Ohio State Uni
versity. What it got was tough
questions, even from supporters,
while boisterous demonstrators
jeered and howled antiwar slogans.
It all underscored an American
publie divided over military strikes
against Iraq — and showed Presi
dent Clinton has his work cut out
for him.
The noisy 90-minute meeting
also may have demonstrated that
methods and sites that worked for
him on domestic policies aren't
necessarily good forums for try ing
to build support for military action.
The televised session made offi
cials back in Washington groan pri
vately and wonder how such a site
could have been selected.
Critics suggested that if the idea
was to show U.S. determination to
Saddam Hussein — known to
wateh CNN — the ploy backfired.
The three U.S. officials who
participated tried to put the best
face on the commotion, calling it a
product of democracy. "Part of
what we fight for as a country is the
freedom to argue." said National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
The chaotic meeting came as
opinion polls showed a public
sharply divided on the idea of mili
tary strikes against Iraq.
From the beginning, yesterday's
session was contentious. Antiwar
protesters resisted most attempts
to quiet them down. Several times.
Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright had to stop speaking
while CNN co-hosts Judv
Woodruff and Bernard Shaw alter

nately scolded did pleaded with
the audienee. Panelists Berger and
Secretary of Defense William
Cohen also were buffeted.
One questioner demanded.
What gives the United States "the
moral right" to attack Iraq?
Another asked how the admin
istration could respond so strongh
to Iraq when the United States
itself sells arms to political allies
with deplorable human rights
records.

Ihe loudest, most disruptive
protests came from relatively lev*
hecklers, but there uas also
applause throughout the audience
for those posing pointed questions
or making anti-bombing state
ments.
At the same time, there was
even louder applause at times in
support of the administration.
In Columbus. James I'. Kuhin.
the State Department spokesman,
said. "Any time you go to a large

group lo discuss an issue like war I
and peace \ou tull\ expect loud
voices."
"The protesters are nois\. but
the conversation is good." said
White House spokesman Mike
\lc('urr\ back in Washington 1
think the people want answers to
questions and these are ver\ giK*J
questions."
Hut Clinton's critics portrayed
the session as a public relations
nightmare.
