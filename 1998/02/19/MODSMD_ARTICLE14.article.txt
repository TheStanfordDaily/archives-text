Black Liberation Month lets
students recognize roles as
citizens in a diverse society

ONE OF THE great things
about Stanford is that it pro
vides students with the oppor
tunity to learn from uncomfortable sit
uations.
By uncomfortable, we don't mean
situations of personal danger. Being
uncomfortable means placing oneself
in a position which provokes an hon
est. gripping look into the way one
thinks.
Black Liberation Month provides
an excellent opportunity for individual
land collective introspection. Some
jpeopJe avoid cultural events because
they don't realize that these events are
meant for everyone â€” not just for
those who are of a particular race, eth
nicity or culture.
We believe that these events can
help those who may not have had the
time, opportunity or inclination to
think about what race, ethnicity and
culture means in an increasingly
diverse society. Sometimes we need to
step outside our familiar worlds and
challenge our perspectives and mis
conceptions.
If we want to get an education at
Stanford, we need to take social issues
as seriously as we take our academics.
Our future roles in the world will be
defined by more than our jobs, just as

our roles as students include more
than our majors and our classes. Being
a citizen and a student requires recog
nizing one's role as an individual with
in a larger, diverse community. By
appreciating our differences, we will
recognize the similarities that bind us
together as a Stanford community and
as a world.
Black Liberation Month is a great
way to begin learning from programs
sponsored by a variety of groups. For
example, last night, Ujamaa House
held a Social Issues Forum in its
lounge. Other events include plays,
lectures, parties, music and dance per
formances.
Cultural learning is not a one
month process, but a lifelong one. On
campus, a multitude of campus organi
zations host events throughout the
year.
The Stanford American Indian
Organization, Asian American Stu
dent Association, Persian Students
Association, El Centro Chicano and
Black Community Services Center are
just some examples of organizations
striving to provide enriching opportu
nities for everyone.
"With legacies as our guide, we cre
ate our path to the future" is the theme
of this year's Black Liberation Month.
If we are concerned about the future
of our world, it is important to delve
into the history of all cultures. In the
process of inquiry, we begin to discov
er more about Stanford and ourselves.
