## Language lessons from locals 
### 
During spring
quarter last year I
used to listen to
Joni Mitchell's "Califor
nia" in anticipation of a
summer of Euro-tripping.
I had an entire month
between a volunteer job in
Brighton. England and fall

quarter at the Stanford-in-Oxford program.
Mv excitement was mixed with nervousness;
I was going to be traveling alone for part of
that period.
The first challenge on my itinerary was
Ireland, but traveling alone there was easy.
The hostels felt like co-ops. They were full
of young people, including Americans who
knew people I knew at Stanford.
Then I got to France.
The moment I stepped off the Metro in
Paris, I was overwhelmed with dirt, graffiti,
pollution, sweltering heat and hundreds of
tourists. The hostel reservation I'd faxed
from Dublin hadn't gone through. After
having decided not to spend the night in a
train station, I ended up in a hotel, where I
took grim pleasure in running a bath, steal
ing the soap and using all the towels.
I resolved to get out of Paris as soon as
possible.
Within 12 hours I was on my way to
Amboise, a town in the heart of France's
Loire Valley. It was a world away from the
place I'd just left. The town was centered

around a castle that makes the one in Dis
neyland look commonplace.
The only other tourist at the hostel was
an Irishman who thought he was speaking
French when he was actually speaking
Spanish. 1 wasn't much better off; I'd taken
five years of Freneh before college, but
after three years of disuse I was back to,
"Je parle un peu."
As I was waiting for the hostel to open,
I met an elderly man walking his dog by the
river bank. Monsieur Pioffet looked like a
gnome with his grizzled hair and workers'
overalls. His voice was raspy from years of
chain-smoking Gauloises. He invited me
back to his house to visit his wife and have
a drink. We swapped addresses and 1 took
a picture of them smiling in front of a win
dow-box of red geraniums.
Monsieur Pioffet's last words of advice
to me were, "Not everyone is as nice as we
are. Be careful, especially with young
men."
"Of course," 1 responded airily, proud
of having been able to conduct a conversa
tion in my limited French. At last. I
thought, 1 was finally getting to know the
locals.
The next day, 1 was walking over a
bridge in Tours when a young man on a
bike stopped and asked me the time. A stu
dent at the University of Tours (or so he
said), he seemed pretty friendly. Buoyed by
my positive experience with the Pioffets, I

accepted his invitation to sit down on the
bank of tlie Loire River for the purpose of
"discuter." The situation seemed safe to
me. It was broad daylight, and there were
other people around. Yet while I attempt
ed to converse with my new acquaintance.
1 began to feel like something was wrong.
Before long. I figured out that "dis
cuter" was actually a prelude to something
else, and I discovered that the most useful
word that I could remember in French was
"Arrete!" Although what 1 really wanted
to say was "Get your hands off me. you
lucking asshole!" 1 had always had trouble
with constructing imperative sentences.
What had gone wrong? I wasn't naife;
I'd read "Let's Go" from cover to cove*. I
had heard stories about sexual harassment
of female tourists in places like Italy. Yet I
couldn't believe that I was considered fair
game just because 1 was a young female
tourist traveling alone.
A couple of months later I had a partic
ularly satisfying dream in which I stabbed a
stalker with my Swiss Army knife.
Coming home to California in no way
lessens the importance of trusting one's
instincts. Knowing when to trust someone
is as important at home or at Stanford as it
is in a foreign country.
