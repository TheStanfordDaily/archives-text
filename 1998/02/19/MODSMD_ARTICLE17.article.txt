Administrators foot the
bill for tuition savings
Administrators should walk off the
job en masse after reading The Daily's
insulting headline, "Tuition raised slight
ly"
We are reminded that this "slight"
increase is actually lower than the aver
age family income growth of 4 percent
nationwide. We are told the reason the
University can pass on such a "slight"
tuition increase is because of savings in
administrative costs.
Yes, we people who work in adminis
trative capacities know just how much
the University is saving on administra
tive costs.
We have been given raises over the
last four years that are not "slightly
below" but well below the average rate
of family income growth in our area dur
ing that period.
The School of Engineering has con
trived an even greater insult by pitting
administrators against each other so as
to reward some with even less than the
Stanford-controlled amount.
I was told by my department adminis
trative manager that my annual 2.K per
cent raise was "a very good raise."
I beg to differ with this view and
would point out that if a raise in tuition
of 3.5 percent can be characterized as
"slight," then an annual salary adjust
ment of 2.K percent is something signifi
cantly less than slight!

Amnesty refutes claim
that it starves children
The Stanford chapter of Amnesty
International would like to respond to
the report in the article "Students
Protest Nike" (Feb. 17) that the Stanford
College Republicans believe that
"Amnesty International starves chil
dren."
Since we were not involved in the
Nike protest and could not respond to
this claim, we thought that the Stanford
community might want more informa
tion.
Here are the facts: Amnesty works to
free prisoners of conscience, that is, peo
ple detained anywhere for their beliefs,
color, ethnic origin, language or religion
and who have not used or advocated vio
lence. Amnesty is a Nobel Prize-winning
international human rights organization
with over 1,1 00.000 individual members,
subscribers and supporters in over 160
countries and territories.
Amnesty is impartial and acts regard
less of the ideology of the government or
the beliefs of the victims.
Amnesty does not advocate or oppose
a boycott of Nike or any other corpora
tion. We do believe that as members of
society, corporations must adhere to the
United Nations' Universal Declaration
of Human Rights which outlines the
rights of workers in Articles 23-25.
These rights include the right to form
unions, to have limited working hours
and to earn an adequate living. To our
knowledge, observance of these rights
has never led to the starvation of chil

dren.
We are disturbed that the Stanford
College Republicans feel they must
resort to making ridiculous statements
and name-calling in order to put forth
their own opinions.

Speaking out in letters
I write in response to David Ball's col
umn in your Tuesday issue. Contrary to
his statements. I believe that the"Let
ters To the Editor" section of this paper
provides a valuable forum for discus
sions on many worthwhile topics.
Unlike Ball, many members of this
community do feel that they possess
"campus viewpoints," and for those of us
without weekly opinions columns, these
diverse views can be voiced to 13,5(H)
readers only through letters such as this.
Mr. Ball needs to look past some of
the petty disagreements which sneak
into this forum and re-evaluate its
importance. Oh, and by the way, I for
one am pro-grave robbing.
