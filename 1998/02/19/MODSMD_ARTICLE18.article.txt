# Bordering on slander
## Jane Camarillo, hear my plaintive plea! 
### 
T. J. Babbitt

SUDDENLY AND spontaneously, a
group ot students in my house has
organized a campaign to "Save
ZAP!" They are passing around petitions,
going door-to-door, talking with former res
idents and alumni and trying their best to
create a wave of support for Zeta Alpha h
a modest but homey little house located
smack in the middle of nowhere.
T-shirts and armbands are almost
assuredly on the way, just as soon as the
rights can be negotiated and the lawyers
have had their say.
If you're wondering why ZAP is threat
ened. you haven't been paying attention to
one of the most sweeping changes to hit
Stanford housing in years.
At the beginning of March. Director of
Residential Education Jane Camarillo will
decide which Row houses are worth saving
and which will disappear next year. Ihe
vacated houses will be taken over by soror
ities.
I can't speak for the residents of other
houses, but most Zappers are understand
ably eager to save their home from death by
girl power. But does the petition drive have
a chance?

I asked around and someone from the
Row office told me that student efforts
would "probably have no influence" on the
final decision. The honesty is refreshing, but
it means that Camarillo will make her deci
sion based on mysterious criteria. Addition
ally. the reasons behind the decision may
never become public. Kind of like the
tenure process ...
I 'm not actually complaining, and I don't
envy Camarillo and her role in this decision.
No matter what she does, she is going to
make a significant number of students very
unhappy. No Row house will simply disap
pear without provoking sadness among its
residents â€” even if those residents are gen
erally sympathetic to the heart-wrenching
plight of homeless sorority coeds.
Some houses, of course, would give up
the fight for survival more gently. After all.
who knows or cares anything about
Durand, Grove or 557?
But even those wimpy little houses prob
ably have their die-hard loyalists. That's
why sororities would best be housed in
dorms, which have no constituency at all.
Most former residents of Stern and Flo Mo
wouldn't uive a damn it those buildings

were condemned and dynamited. Tragical
ly, Camarillo isn't even considering it.
The only thing we know, then, is that
someone on the Row has got to go. In the
current information vacuum, rumors have
been traveling at incredible speeds. At one
time people "in the know" were sure new
sororities would be housed in Cowell C "lus
ter. which tends to draw lower than houses
on Mayfield.
Hut then rumor mongers decided that
Cowell houses wouldn't be picked because
sororities would not be capable of filling
them to capacity. This spawned the counter
rumor that the University wanted to keep
sororities scrambling to keep their houses
filled in order to imperil their survival from
the start, as part of an anti-Greek conspira
cy in the Dean of Students Office. Of
course, no such conspiracy exists, and I cat
egorically deny being a part ol it.
The only conspiracy I want to involve
myself in right now is saving ZAP from
being overrun by girl cooties, if it is indeed
in danger. Maybe it's not. Hut just in case. I
think we need to find a way to get Ms.
Camarillo here to see just how special we
are. I'm sure Zappers would be happy to

entertain her for days on end, like a pro fro
who just won't leave. And I'm sure she
would go away convinced that we are a vital
part i)l the Res Ed program.
ZAP. you see. fosters an intellectual
atmosphere so dense and exciting you could
cut it with a knife. It's a Res I d dream come
true. I admit that we haven't gone to see a
single opera together. Hut most ol the house
/ones out on three solid hours of "Must See
TV." and much of our large and vibrant gay
and lesbian community manages to amuse
itself with "Melrose Place." We talk about
the challenging issues raised by these pro
grams during commercial break I swear!
We haven't organized a single lecture
series about rain forest deforestation or
oppression in Mvanmar. Hut our cook puts
on an amazing magic show.
It's true that inconsiderate people keep
breaking our disposal with forks, and that
some people just won't wash their pots. Hut
when intruders try to steal our ice cream
sandwiches and Saltines. we Zappers band
together in unity to defend our kitchen with
broom handles.
I'll even grant you that our staff is com
pletely dysfunctional and by now is proba

hlv in need of extensive therapy. But, in
spite of it all, the house functions remark
ably smoothly. Our petty staff quarrels are
just one more topic for gossip at dinner.
Admittedly, house meetings at ZAP are
few and far between. But we have other
forms of communication. The walls are so
thin that it's easy to hear every word of a
heated argument from another hallway on
another floor. The ventilator system broad
casts the details of our sex lives throughout
the house. Our bathrooms are filled with
more newsletters per capita than any other
house on this planet.
Sure, no one has crossed any lines in our
dorm lounge, and we're too cool for dorky
community-building exercises. But here at
ZAP. it's easy to find a running partner or
someone with whom to split a pizza.
Ms. ("amarillo. do you hear my plaintive
cry? ZAP is a house worth holding on to. If
you want to see for yourself, come on over
and we'll be hannv to show vou around.
