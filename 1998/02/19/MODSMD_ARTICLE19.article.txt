## Men seek Maples magic 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
They're two teams with two com
pletely different goals.
The No. 10 Stanford men's bas
ketball team (21-3. 10-2 Pacific 10
Conference), all hut assured of a
spot in the NCAA tournament, is
looking to cap oil its season strongly
as it plays four ol its last six games at
home.
Along the way, the Cardinal is
hoping that conference leader Ari
zona will slip up. giving Stanford a
chance to catch the Wildcats in the
race for the Pac-10 crown.
Washington has a slightly differ
ent agenda.
The Huskies (15-7, 8-5) find
themselves on the bubble for a tour
nament bid. and a win tonight over
the Cardinal in Maples Pavilion
would help to convince the tourna
ment selection committee that they
belong in the Big Dance.
Last week's sweep of the Los An
geles schools gave the Cardinal
some much-needed confidence and
revived a team that has been passive
during recent games.
Fans and media were beginning
to doubt Stanford after it dropped
three of four games, including an
overtime loss to Arizona State and a

20 point drubbing at the hands of
( onnecticut.
Hut after taking out UCLA and
USC on the road, the Cardinal has
again convinced everyone that it is a
team to be reckoned with come
tournament time.

"Right now it feels good," said ju
nior point guard Arthur Lee. "We
haven't won in L A. in a long while,
especially a sweep. We just ended a
very tough road trip, so after ending
it with two good victories, morale is
high. We know we have six key
games left that we have to finish
strongly in. We just have to have no
letdown and keep playing strong
and well, and we'll be fine for the
tournament.
"We felt that going down to L.A..
the championship teams would have
to win in those situations. So we an
swered questions in that respect in
terms of winning key games on the
road at crucial times."
Montgomery's squad also gets to
look forward to returning home

after playing its last four games on
the road, hut the aura surrounding
Maples isn't what it used to he.
After mounting an impressive
20-game home winning streak, the
Cardinal lost hack-to-back games to
the Arizona schools at Maples. With
the recent series of road games, the
team hasn't had a chance to end its
homecourt slide.
"We've talked about under
standing that the last time we came
home after some road wins we got
beat at home." Montgomery said.
"Being at home doesn't guarantee
anything. You've still got to play the
games. We're just trying to view this
last part of the season as kind of a
one at a time, set yourself up as best
you can for a possible champi
onship."
But now the team seems back to
its old form.
When Ari/.ona came into Maples
three weeks ago. Stanford had just
come off of a road sweep of the
Washington schools. However, both
wins were by a Cardinal team that
was making poor decisions and
wasn't attacking its opponents with
the same intensity it had through its
first 16 games.
UCLA marked a turnaround.
