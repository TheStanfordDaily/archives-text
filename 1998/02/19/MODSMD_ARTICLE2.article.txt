Paul Griffiths, music writer at the New York Times, criticized
the lack of enthusiasm for 20th-century classical music today. He
remarked scathingly that calling institutions such as Carnegie I lall
and the New York Philharmonic "museums" insults the innova
tive spirit of most art museums.
However, at Stanford, there have been strong efforts to recruit
new musicians and to expose students and members ot the com
munity to contemporary music.
Many members of the Music Department feel that new music
has been received well at Stanford, in spite of its occasional lack of
tonality, which makes it difficult to listen to.
"New music concerts such as those put on by Alea 11. a con
temporary music group, are very well attended," said Kotoka
Suzuki, who composes modem music.
Suzuki, a doctoral candidate in composition, is currently com
posing a piece using computer music technology using traditional
Japanese melodies. Stanford appealed to Suzuki because of its
renowned computer music program and advances in new music
made by composers and performers such as Music Prof. Jonathan
Harvey.
Students involved in the department have mixed feelings to
ward contemporary classical music.
Senior Ciabe Trop, a cellist, believes that new music is im
portant because it provides an aesthetic challenge to conven
tionalism.
Trop points to the piece by composer John Cage titled "Four
and-a-Half Minutes of Silence" as an example of controversial in
novation. This piece consists of a performer sitting in silence lor

four-and-a-half minutes. The audience and its noises are the per
formance. This performance launched controversy about the pur
pose of music.
"New music shows the audience the misery of their own lives."
Trop said."( omposers such as John C 'age or Samuel IJarbei don't
allow you to just accept the norm."
Senior Corey Yeh, a pianist, feels betrayed by the discordance
of new music.
"New music often lacks a sense of melody and overall phras
ing," Yeh said. "I was trained as a classical pianist and listening to
new music disturbs me."
One of the pioneers of new music at Stanford is Lecturer
Thomas Schult/, a pianist. He encourages his students to play new
music to expose them to a new venue of expression. Schult/
achieved notoriety in Europe for performing contemporary clas
sical music and performs at Stanford regularly.
Last night, he performed karlheinz Stockhausen's piece.
"Mantra," with Joan Nagano in Campbell Auditorium. Harvey
and Keith Chapin, a doctoral student in musieology. also per
formed at the concert.
Chapin said he believes that new music takes time and effort to
appreciate.
"Shakespeare, for instance, is harder to read than comic books,
but what you get out of it may give you a very different kind of ex
perience," he said.
According to Chapin. the idea of creating original music
began in the late 18th century. Since then, music has advanced
at a faster pace with innovations such as 12-tone music, which

uses all 12 tones of a scale in math
ematical combinations. The com

binations are used to create
melodies and harmonies.
"New music really represents
the continuity of musical tradi
tion." Chapin said. "I don't think it
is insightful to draw a distinction."
