robin format with the team posting
the best record taking the champi
onship.
Coming off a solid victory over
the No. 15 Cal-State Northridge
Matadors this past weekend, the
Card looks to continue its solid play
against three ranked opponents in
the tournament.
Last year Stanford took home a
second place finish in the tourna
ment with a 5-2 record. The Card
defeated No. 22 Hawaii, 7-2. and
No. 13 Cal State Northridge. 3-2. but
lost to No. 5 Michigan, 6-1. and No.
14 Long Beach State, 3-1.
Stanford meets two ranked op
ponents on the first day of the tour
nament, No. 14 Long Beach State
and No. 17 UCLA, who is on proba

tion this season. The other ranked
team. No. 4 Michigan, meets the
Card on Sunday morning.
Long Beach State will be a tough
opponent, as it brings back the ma
jority of last year's squad. Last year.
Stanford played Long Beach three
times, posting a 1-1-1 record.
UCLA (5-0) will also be a tough
match for the ( ard. despite redshirt
ing three players on probation. The
Bruins have solid pitching and qual
ity hitting, but their defense has
been exceptional this season. In a
doubleheader against Loyola Mary
mount earlier this season, UCLA
had no errors despite a rain-soaked
field.
As the favorite going into the
tourney. Michigan will present the
greatest challenge for Stanford. Last
season, the Wolverines won a
school record 56 games and Michi
gan returns 12 players and seven
starters from last year's team.
Michigan has a solid defense and its
pitching staff boasts Ail-American
Sara Griffen, who was 15-2 last sea
son with a .97 ERA.
The Wolverines hitters are im
pressive throughout the lineup, with
three returning players hitting over


Freshman Jenni Shledler lakes a cut against Cal State Northridge
last Sunday. The Cardinal swept that doubleheader and hopes to
continue Its success in Its tournament this weekend.
