# Cagers off to Seattle for battle
## Flores catches fire 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
Lesson learned — sort of.
towards the end of last season. Milena Flores was
learning a great deal as Jamila Wideman's heir apparent.
ITie future kx>ked very bright as she was going to step right
into Wideman's role this season and lead a Cardinal team
ranked fourth in the preseason poll to glory
Then Wisconsin and Purdue happened — two dis
heartening and turnover-plagued season-opening losses.
"1 think in the beginning of the year what I'd learned
from the seniors (last year) hadn't quite set in." Flores said,
laughing. "Now it has — things like learning to be more
poised out there and running a halfcourt offense, as well as
just being a natural floor leader with nobod\ worrying it
I'm all right."
Fhe sophomore point guard of the fifth-ranked Stan
ford women's basketball team has had to endure the whis
pers and criticisms of her so-called inexperience all season
long despite having played ver> capabh as Wideman 's suc
cessor.
But that has not stopped Flores from turning into a
point guard possessed, as was apparent in her breakout
performances this past weekend against UCLA and I S(\
Now as the team heads into the stretch run of the season
(starting with tonight's road battle in Washington), the
whispers have been silenced and the talk of Final Four has
once again become serious.
"Maybe I CLA and I S( was our cocoon and we get
this butterfly out of it." said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer of Flores' play "It's kind of like all season
long the thing that as a coach, you're lookingat this person
saying, 'I know you can do this.' And they maybe either
aren't ready to or don't know that they can. but once they
figure it out. then they re doing it.
"I saw that happen with Jennifer [ A/vi] too. in that you
can do this ' Then all of the sudden. 'Oh yeah. I am do it
and 1 like it.' It is fun to see people have something click

Milena Flores takes the ball upcourt earlier this season. With her phenomenal play
of late, she looks to lead the Card to victory tonight against Washington.
