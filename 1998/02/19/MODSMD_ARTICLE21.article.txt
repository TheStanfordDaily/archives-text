# Cagers off to Seattle for battle
## Flores catches fire 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
Lesson learned — sort of.
towards the end of last season. Milena Flores was
learning a great deal as Jamila Wideman's heir apparent.
ITie future kx>ked very bright as she was going to step right
into Wideman's role this season and lead a Cardinal team
ranked fourth in the preseason poll to glory
Then Wisconsin and Purdue happened — two dis
heartening and turnover-plagued season-opening losses.
"1 think in the beginning of the year what I'd learned
from the seniors (last year) hadn't quite set in." Flores said,
laughing. "Now it has — things like learning to be more
poised out there and running a halfcourt offense, as well as
just being a natural floor leader with nobod\ worrying it
I'm all right."
Fhe sophomore point guard of the fifth-ranked Stan
ford women's basketball team has had to endure the whis
pers and criticisms of her so-called inexperience all season
long despite having played ver> capabh as Wideman 's suc
cessor.
But that has not stopped Flores from turning into a
point guard possessed, as was apparent in her breakout
performances this past weekend against UCLA and I S(\
Now as the team heads into the stretch run of the season
(starting with tonight's road battle in Washington), the
whispers have been silenced and the talk of Final Four has
once again become serious.
"Maybe I CLA and I S( was our cocoon and we get
this butterfly out of it." said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer of Flores' play "It's kind of like all season
long the thing that as a coach, you're lookingat this person
saying, 'I know you can do this.' And they maybe either
aren't ready to or don't know that they can. but once they
figure it out. then they re doing it.
"I saw that happen with Jennifer [ A/vi] too. in that you
can do this ' Then all of the sudden. 'Oh yeah. I am do it
and 1 like it.' It is fun to see people have something click

Milena Flores takes the ball upcourt earlier this season. With her phenomenal play
of late, she looks to lead the Card to victory tonight against Washington.
and then it becomes a part of their
game."
Based on last week's perfor
mance, the something that has
clicked has been an intensity that has
increased tenfold — getting into the
face of an opponent, driving to the
basket with fervor, using those quick
wrists to throw the long out let pass on
the fast break. All told, it has helped
ignite the Cardinal offense to an av
erage of KM points in the last five
games.
"She's our little fireball." said se
nior forward Vanessa Nygaard. Flo
res "has been able to really separate
herself from the pack these past few
games. Hut we've expected that of
her all year long."
Indeed, like any new starter, there
were going to be bumps during a long
season. Hut heading into last week
end. she had been averaging more
i\ian 10 points per contest and dishing
out 6.6 assists, which was tops in the
Pacific 10 Conference. However,
there was still that nagging feeling
that she hadn't fully embraced her
role as a floor leader.
"I'm not sure if it had to do with
me being a sophomore," Flores said
of growing into her role. "I was prob
ably more hesitant because of the en
tirely new role that I had, which with
more playing time 1 became more
comfortable."
Many teammates have also point-

Ed out her perfectionist tendencies as
something that has driven her all sea
son long. This is something Flores is
quick to acknowledge.
"I guess I would agree that I am a
perfectionist," Flores said. "I don't
like to make mistakes. I can be criti
cal of my own play many times over.
Lately, I've learned to let mistakes go
a lot easier than 1 have in the past. I
play with a lot of emotion and inten
sity, and in the same way. I have high
expectations for my teammates."
So with the two virtuosi) perfor
mances firmly planted in Flores' psy
che, the questions have switched
from "when will Flores break out?"
to "how far?" — as in "how far can
this team go in the NCAA tourna
ment?"
"It's been great that people have
stopped talking about that." Flores
said with a relieved smile. "We've
worked hard to silence that criticism.
I think we can definitely get to the
Final Four and get to the champi
onship game."
But ever the perfectionist, she still
feels like there's still a ways to go.
"I think there are so many things I
feel I need to work on — more ball
handling, being able to handle pres
sure. vary my moves and making bet
ter decisions," Flores said. "Also. I
still need to control my emotions —
be more stoic. There are times when
it could hurt, like when our team is in
trouble. I can't let that bother me; I
have to be the person that's calming
people down and turning it around."
Lesson learned — period.
