## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Heading into tonight's 7 p.m.
game against No. 21 Washington
(16-6, 7-6 Pacific ID Conference)
in Seattle, the Stanford women's
basketball team finds itself back in
the nation's top five lor the Inst
time since the preseason poll.
I he fifth ranked Cardinal (15-
5.11-1) has been firing on all cylin
ders of late, and even I SC head
coach Chris Ciobrecht had to
admit that Stanford is "playing
about as well as anyone in the
country rijilit now" in the wake ot
her squad's Ml M loss to the ( ard
Saturday.
"I feci like I've been on a

bungee jump, going all the wa\
down and then coming back up."
said Stanford head coach 1 ara
VanDerveer. "I think it's a real
credit to this team. It's eas\ to be a
dark horse and creep up. Maybe it
was that people were kxiking at
what we could do bv ranking us
that high in the beginning and not

w hat we were doing."
Whatever the reason, no one
can argue Stanford's prowess in

recent weeks. I he Card is riding a
nine game win streak and hasonh
dropped one game m its last 14 In
its last seven games. Stanford has
outseored opponents hi 7-442 (an
ss 63 average). stepping up its de
fense while running the offense at
full throttle.
" I here's a eouple of things at
work." VanDerveer said of the
prolific scoring. "We're shinning
an incredible percentage. I think
\ne are moving the ball better; I
think our passing has improved a
lot We're starting to run the floor
better, and again. I'm not satisfied
and I don't think anyone is satis
tied with how we're playing."
Maybe she's not satisfied, but
Van I X:r veer has to at least be

pleased with some of the key per
formances she's received from the
younger players. At the top of that
iist is sophomore point guard
Milena Flores.
Flores had a coming-out party
against the L A. schi>ols, scoring a
total of M points in both games
and dominating the contest with
her open-court passes and pene
tration in the halfcourt game. And
she did it against two of the Pac
10's toughest guards. Erica
Gomez (I'CLA) and Kristin
Clark (USD.
"I think the thing Milena fig
ured out is that she's quick and
fast." VanDerveer said. "And
playing against probably as good of
guards as there are in the confer
ence, taking it at them ought to tell
her she can take it against any
body."
But while Flores seems to have
bolted down the point guard posi
tion, the shooting guard spot is
something that VanDerveer sees
as being handled "by committee."
VanDerveer subbed four different
guards in the first half of the USC
game, and said she'll continue to go
with whatever the situation calls
for.
"What I'm really trying to get is
the best out of all the different peo
ple, all the different strengths that
different people have, but also ask
ing each of those people to add to
their repertoire," VanDerveer
said. "We've been working on our
backcourt all year and maybe the
good news is that people won't
know who we're going to play. Hut

sometimes it keeps me up."
Meanwhile, the frontline con
tinues to be one of the nation's
best. Seniors Olympia Scott.
Vanessa Nvgaard and Heather
Owen are playing their best ball of
the year, and junior forward
Kristin Folkl should be back in the
mix tonight as the Card meets one
of the toughest forwards in the
Pac-10 in Washington's Amber
Hall.
Hall leads the conference in re
bounding (11.3 per game) and
chips in 16. 1 ) points per contest for
the Huskies. Hut even for Hall's
contributions, Washington has had
a schizophrenic season, losing to
teams like Arizona State.
"We've never been the most
popular people up there in Seat
tle." VanDerveer said. "It's a
tough place to play. Their team is
very capable of having great games
— we know that because they beat
Vanderbilt they beat North Caroli
na State. Hut they have been up
and down. We just don't want them
up against us."
