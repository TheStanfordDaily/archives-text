# Nagano thrill for Sami Jo Small
## 
### Bobby Blunt Contributing writer 
While most Stanford students rev
eled in the freedom of the Presidents'
Day holiday by taking a trip to Tahoe,
or to Los Angeles, or even by just re
laxing here on The Farm, at least one
Stanford student will have quite a bit
of schoolwork to make up when she
returns.
Stanford senior Sami Jo Small has
not only spent the long weekend, but
most of the month of February, in
Nagano, Japan as part of the Canadian
women's ice hockey Olympic team.
Leaving Stanford at the beginning
dI the month to join the Olympic ice
hockey team in Nagano, Small has
been making the most of her time
away from The Farm. When not di
rectly involved in the team's activities,
she has enjoyed spending time with
some of the Olympic greats to be
found in Nagano, particularly some of
the ice hockey players and many other
Canadian stars.
"She rides the stationary bike every
morning with Steve Yzerman, has
played cards with Eric Lindros and has
had long chats with Theoren Fleury
and Janet Gretzky." said Small's
brother, Luke.
Small is Canada's third goaltender
for the Olympic tournament. The ros
ter. though, is only allowed to have
two goalies.
The need for another goaltender, in
the event of an injury, necessitated
that Small be brought along as well
something that Small was all to
pleased to do for her team, country,
and herself. Thus, Small's official role
is that of support staff.
Women's ice hockey has made a
wonderful debut as an Olympic medal
sport in Nagano. The final of the

women's tournament was held early
Tuesday morning, Stanford time, as
the United States and Canada battled
in the gold medal game. The United
States ended up beating Canada 3-1
for the gold.
Small started skating when she was
only about two years old, and by the
time she was live, had already started
playing hockey. She consistently par
ticipated in the club leagues, eventual
ly becoming the first female to partic
ipate on the Manitoba junior team (21
and under team) before coming to
Stanford. At school Small enjoys her
role as the starting goalie on the Stan
ford ice hockey club team.
Small has not limited herself to only

participating in hockey at Stanford.
Small also throws the javelin for the
track team. Through this, she has al
ready experienced the pressure and
excitement of international competi
tion.
While still in high school in ( anada.
Small earned a bronze medal in the
javelin as a member of the Pan-Amer
ican junior team.
Her interest in sports began at a
young age. Small was first intrigued by
the hockey equipment of her older
brother and she would try his equip
ment on to see what it was like when
he was not around.

Small'S father says that he remem
bers well the time spent standing in the
snow hanks at the edge of the ice
watching Sarni Jo play hockey.
"And now, it just brought goose
bumps to me to see her in the
Olympics," said Small's father. Rod.
"Hockey is her sport, and although she
enjoys track, 1 think it's fair to say
[hockey is] her first love."
The opportunity to make the trip to
Nagano lor the Olympics had to be
earned. Small had to stop out fall quar
ter in order to participate in the team
tryouts in Canada. Those who have
spoken to her say she is having the
time of her life.
"As you can imagine, she is totally
psyched," said Luke.
The only thing that would have
been better for Small was if she had
played while in Nagano.
But don't count this as the only
Olympics for her. There is no doubt
that women's hockey will only contin
ue to grow and there may be a great
chance that Small will make trips to fu
ture Olympics.
Stanford students and affiliates can
be doubly proud of what has taken
place in Nagano. Not only was a new
medal sport introduced and became a
fabulous success, but Stanford was
represented by Sami Jo Small. What
ever the affiliation, Stanford can cheer
for both the United States and Cana
da.
Small did not forget her roots here
on The Farm while in Nagano. Not
only did international viewers catch a
glimpse of Small during the opening
ceremony's parade of nations, but in
the precoverage of the opening cere
monies. an interview with one of
Canada's skiers found Small in the
background holding up a sign that
read: "HI, STANFORD."
