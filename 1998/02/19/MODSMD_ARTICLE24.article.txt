strong team like ÜBC is that they
will take advantage of all the mis
takes of their opposition.

so well your problems." said coach
Entile Bruneau. "They will exploit
any of our mistakes and we will have
to recover from them and adjust."
"This will he a high-level game,"

said head coach Stanford Frahck
Boivert, "and we haven't played
such a game in a long time."

one for Stanford. By playing strong,
physical competition, the team will
know exactly where it stands as it en
ters into the height of the season.

competition than Stanford has faced
even in the playoffs or in the nation
al tournament in past years.

collegiate side that will be truly com
petitive." Boivert said. "And I hope
that we will indeed be ready for a
fight."
The keys to the game will be in
the defense and in trying to keep up
the physical intensity for the entire
game. lIBC won last year's game bv
a significant margin. In last year s
match, though, the Cardinal scored
three tnes. showing that the offense
is capable.

down ÜBC and cannot be soft or
tentative. This w ill be especialh cru

win the ball back, therefore being
able to play verv quicklv into offense
while the opposition is disorganized.
"Rapid transition from defense
to offense is where we shine and
we'll need to make use of that
against ÜBC," said Bruneau. "We
need to quickly move the ball for
ward into the group game or plav
with the outside backs."
ÜBC will be a strong team and
provide for the first time in several
weeks a chance for the Cardinal to
be tested on its overall game synthe
