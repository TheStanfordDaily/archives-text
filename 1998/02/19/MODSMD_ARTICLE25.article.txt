# El Nino falls victim to Card
## 
### Gabby Duno Contributing writer 
For a while, it looked like El Nino
was going to be the victor in Stan
ford's last two rugby games.
After much debate over where, or
if. the game should he played, the
Cardinal traveled to Davis for an
early morning, mud-infested rugby
; game last Saturday.
Playing in pouring rain and a
! Hooded field. Stanford overcame the
weather conditions and defeated the
; Aggies 10-5. Junior Steve Preonas
scored a try in the game while senior
Ail-American kicker Dave Warter
added a conversion and penalty kick
to seal Stanford's victory.
Before Saturday's matchup, the
Cardinal showed that it has a strong
offense, scoring easily in all of its pre
vious games, but it was yet to play
well on defense.
Fhe victory over the Aggies
proved to be an important stepping
stone for the team. In a game where
the conditions made it almost impos
sible to handle the ball, the Cardinal
showed overall improvement
playing aggressively on offense, and
more importantly, tackling well on
defense.
I he tough game against UC-
Davis was just the first of a challeng

ing series that the ( ardinal must en
dure over the next couple of weeks.

â–  Saturday's result: Stanford 14.
I Jniversity of Victoria 34

Yesterday, the Cardinal put on
the line their perfect 8-0 record
against the North American rugby
champions, the University of Victo
ria.
Labeled "the best team in ( "ana
da." the University of Victoria is
known for its combination of
strength and mobility. Before the
game. Stanford coach Franck
Boivert was confident in his players'
speed, but was concerned with the
lack ol strength. I'he Canadian team
handed Stanford a 34-14 defeat on
Maloney Field.
"We played decently hut not to
the best of our abilities." said senior
captain I rung Ngo. "We could have
given them a bigger challenge."
"We all let down a little." added
sophomore Erie Ciroff. "We know
we can play better. We need to get
the intensity back if we are going to
have a successful season."
Ihe Cardinal's next challenge
comes Saturday against the I 'niversi
tv of British Columbia, ranked sec

ond in ("anada behind the I University
of Victoria. I IBC, though not as
sin>ngas their ( anadian counterpart,
is a team with excellent fundamentals
and skills, according to Boivert.
Though the games against the
( anadians are not considered league
games, they are undoubtedly great
learning experiences for the Card.
"The Canadians are older and
more mature, but this is a tremen
dous chance for our boys." Boivert
said. "We play them every year, but
have never won. [This] Saturday, we
are going for an upset."
Stanford took it's first defeat of
the season with the loss to the Uni
versity ol Victoria. However, still
holding an impressive 8-1 record, the
( ard, with its win over Davis, has of
ficially placed No. 2 in the nation, be
hind top-ranked Cal.
With the No. 2 ranking, the goals
for the season have become clearer
as the season progresses. The Card is
ready to fight for the coveted No. 1
spot. I he games against the Canadi
ans and BYI l later in the season are
extremely valuable for Stanford to
prepare for the matchup against Cal.
Still. Boivert is concerned with
Stanford's lack of strength in high
pressure situations, and is hoping that
this will continue to improve along
with the defense.
