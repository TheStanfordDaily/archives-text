NCAA champion for the past three
years. UCLA, currently defending
its indoor title for the second time,
won the tournament in both 1996
and 1997. The champion of this
tournament is guaranteed a spot in
the NCAA championship tourna
ment at the end of the year.
"It's a very important tourna
ment for us." said head coach Dick
Gould. "It's the last time to get a
free ride to the NCAAs. but it's still
a long way to determine who goes
straight to the tournament."
Stanford is scheduled to compete
against Boise State today in the first
round of competition. Sophomore
Mike Bryan, moving up to No. 2 in
the Rolex collegiate poll, is continu
ing to have some problems with ten
donitis in his wrist. Gould said he
was not sure whether or not Mike
Bryan would be able to compete.
"I still don't know if Mike is
going to play," Gould said earlier
this week. "He will finally be playing
No. 1 if he does play."
If everyone is healthy for the
tournament, Mike Bryan would
plav first singles with brother Bob
Bryan playing at the No. 2 spot. Se
nior captain Paul (Goldstein will play
at the third spot, and junior Ryan
Wolters will compete for Stanford
at No. 4 singles. Freshman Alex
