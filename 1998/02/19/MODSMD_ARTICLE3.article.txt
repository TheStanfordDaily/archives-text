# Fewer fee refunds requested
## 
### Nathan Watanabe contributing writer 
In spite of the large increase in undergraduate
ASSIJ fees this year, figures show that the number
of undergraduates requesting refunds has re
mained almost the same while the number of grad
uates requesting refunds h;is substantially dropped.
The ASSI' will refund undergraduate and grad
uate students $9,371.21 and $16,725.33, respective
ly in special-fee money for winter quarter with par
ticularly low refund rates for community service
and cultural organizations.
A total of 1.124 students — K67 graduates and
257 undergraduates requested fee refunds, a de
cline from last year's winter quarter total of 1.369
students In both years, the graduates make up the
bulk of the requests, hut graduate students account
for almost all of the decrease in the number of stu
dents requesting refunds this year.
Using the application process under the Com
mon Sense Fee Reform effort implemented in
19%, 24 of the 33 student groups that receive fees
only requested mone> from undergraduates in re
sponse to the traditionally higher refund rates tor
graduate students, said ASSI Financial Manager
Don Coleman.
The remaining nine groups requested funds
from both populations No group requested sup-
port only from graduate students.
Last year, the first in which
groups had the current option to
apply only to one population, 12 out
of 22 groups received money only
from undergraduates.
"Graduate [students] refund at a
greater rate and vote less often when
it comes to the allocation of these
funds," Coleman said.
Every one of those 33 groups was
granted at least part ol its special fee
in the spring general election, so the
ASSU fee itself has risen (particular
ly for undergraduates) from $29.(W to

$50. The graduate fee remained rela
tively constant from $20.67 to $22.
"I Jnlike last year, nobody got cut
out when it came time to vote for dis
tributing the ASSIJ fee." Coleman
said. "Also, since certain fees are un
dergraduate-only. the undergradu
ates have to compensate in order to
support all the organizations."
Of this year's 24 groups funded
solely by undergraduates, live com
munity service and one ethnic um
brella organization make up the six
organizations with the lowest refund
rates — Spoon Hunger Relief Net
work, Stanford Homeless Action
Coalition. Alternative Spring Break,
Project Motivation, Stanford Com
munity Carnival and the Asian

American Student Association. All
ol these groups had fewer than PX)
students request refunds.
"I'm very pleased about it," said
A ASA chair Bianca ling, a junior.
"It shows that the Stanford student
body really appreciates everything
that AASA and other Asian-Ameri
can student organizations contribute
to the entire Stanford community "
Of the above groups. Spoon re
ceived the lowest refund rate with
125 returns.
"I'm glad that Spoon is well sup
ported by the Stanford student
body," said Spoon Financial Manag
er Robert A. Lope/, a freshman.
"While Spoon volunteers play a
hugely important role in getting the

University's unused food out to
those in need, it is the student body
as a whole that keeps the operations
going."
Conversely, the two undergradu
ate-only funded groups with the
highest refund rates were the Stan
ford Solar Car Project and Masque,
an art and literature magazine serv
ing primarily the gay community.
For the nine groups funded by
both graduate students and under
graduates, the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau received the lowest refund rate
with 622 students receiving a reim
bursement while club sports, whose
special fee is the largest given to any
group, received the highest rate with
1,028 students.
