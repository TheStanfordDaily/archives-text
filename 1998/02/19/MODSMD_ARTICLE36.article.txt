## love is in the food eleven provides a romantic atmosphere 
### Alicia McCann Contributing writer 
Driving down
Uth street in San
Francisco, it is impos
sible not to worry
about one's safety. And
yet, amidst the graffiti
covered buildings and
seedy bars is a charm
ing little restaurant
called Eleven. From
the outside, it seems
very out of place in its
neighborhood, but
this in fact makes it
much more inviting.
Upon entering,
my date and I were
reminded instantly
that the date was Feb.
14. The restaurant had

gone to every possible length to create an
atmosphere appropriate for the day of
love. In preparation for Valentine's Day,
each of the small tables was adorned with
dainty red heart-shaped doilies and white
candles. This gave the whole dimly-lit
restaurant a romantic and desperately sul
try ambiance.
In an attempt to maximize space, the
restaurant is designed on two levels.
Several tables on the first level run along
side an extensive wooden bar, but they are
still quite charming. These seats are perfect
for drinking in the mood of the restaurant
or for watching the chefs as they prepare
the food in full view.
However, if you are searching for a
more intimate experience, it is highly
advisable to ask to be seated upstairs.
Almost all of the tables are made for two,
with some of them looking down on the
tables below.
Lining the back wall are cozy and
secluded maroon leather booths, which
are ideal for forgetting that there are other
people in the restaurant.
No matter where one might choose to
sit, the experience is inevitably going to be
romantic. Eleven definitely earns five stars in
the area of "dateability."
If conversation should begin to lag dur
ing the evening, you can always discuss
Eleven's decor. The interior is developed to
coincide with the creative cuisine, and the
balance is pleasing both to the eye and the
taste buds.
One of the dominant architectural
trends in the restaurant is the presence of
black wrought-iron. Massive chandeliers
hang dramatically from the ceiling. A
wrought-iron fence traipses up the staircase
and creates the balcony for the second level.
There are even massive wrought-iron
gates mounted upon the wall, as if one could
open the wall and enter another world. The
walls add to this effect in their own peculiar
ity.
At first glance, it seems as if the design
ers never finished painting the walls.
However, this is done purposefully to create
a rustic effect. Images such as grapes, ivy
leaves, fish and pottery are imprinted on the

wall so as to look like fossilized images.
Massive golden, three-dimensional stars are
suspended from the ceiling; a dangerous
decorating move but a successful one. In one
corner, there is a large white sculpture of
something ethereal jutting oat ceremonious
ly from the wall. It is as if one is standing in
a courtyard in ancient Greece; one wouldn't
be surprised if the waiters wore togas.
However, the waiters were in fact
clothed in semiformal attire, and the service
was as pleasing as their appearance.
Although the restaurant was quite busy due
to the Valentine's celebration, we were given
every consideration and served promptly
and competently.
A special Valentine's Day dinner had
been planned by the chefs, and we were pre
sented with this menu upon reaching our
table nestled in a corner on the second level.
The four-course meal was designed in the
spirit of experimentation.
Upon reading the choice of appetizers,
it became startlingly obvious that the restau
rant was truly gourmet. I ordered a dish
made of crispy fried oysters, ginger creme

fraiche, cucumber relish
and tobiko caviar. It was
quite succulent, with
the cucumber being the
dominant flavor. Eating
it was almost like

destroying a work of art, because it was so
cleverly and daintily laid on the plate.
The salad was a mix of baby greens,
blood orange and basil vinaigrette dressing,
shaved parmesan and raisins. There must
have been a shortage on the dressing,
because my salad was fairly devoid of flavor.
Not unlike munching on grass, it was diffi
cult to finish the large amount on the plate.
The entree redeemed the salad. A gen
erous portion of tender beef filet was placed
atop truffled mashed potatoes and adorned
with porcini butter, arugula salad and a
sauce that invigorated my taste buds.
The meat was juicy and the potatoes
were delicately seasoned. The flavor was rich
and sweet, but with a country home cooking
feel that was truly superb.
My date chose to order the crabmeat
lasagne, which was served with handmade

Eleven definitely earns
five stars in the area of
'dateability.'

chive pasta, tarragon ricotta and fresh
spinach. Definitely a must for seafood

lovers, the fla
vor was slightly
overwhelming
but still fabu
lous and highly
recommended.
Th e
fourth course
of our meal was
a small piece of
chocolate cake
floating in a
pool of passion
fruit anglaise
and referred to

simply as "Chocolate Decadence." In the
same family as fudge, this dark chocolate
can only be described as the richest and
most concentrated piece of pure and
sweet bitterness ever to cross my lips.
Although it was a chocolate masterpiece,
consuming the entire piece would proba
bly have proven lethal. The sauce comple
mented the dessert, adding a creamy tex
ture and fruity taste that harmonized
with the chocolate itself. It was absolutely
exquisite.
Music was playing in the background
throughout the first part of the meal.
Unfortunately, since we were right
beneath the barn-like wooden rafters
housing the speakers, the volume was at

times overwhelming.
Also, the selection of
music was often inappro
priate. In a fancy
gourmet restaurant
where the recommended
attire is anything except
casual, songs like "High
Hopes" were filling the
room. Although I do have
"high apple pie in the sky
hopes" about life, the
music was better suited
for Disneyland rather
than a romantic
Valentine's dinner.
However, it turns
out that this music was
played to fill the time
before seven o'clock, when
the band Vernon Bush trio

began its performance. One of the most
attractive parts of this restaurant is that the
band plays on an elevated stage in a corner
opposite the second level of seating. This
allows for the music to waft down to the tables
below and to drift across to nearby tables.
The band itself was fantastic and well
chosen for the evening and the ambiance.
Consisting of a singer, piano player, bass
player and drummer, Vernon Bush Trio has a
sophisticated rhythm & blues style.
The sultry and soulful voice of the
singer is enough to inspire even the most
hesitant romantic.
Eleven prides itself on its musical pre
sentations. Live music is featured six nights a
week, ranging in genre from jazz and swing
to hits of the '80s and '90s. Eleven promises
a satisfying, aesthetically pleasing and
intriguing dining experience.

every consideration and served promptly
and competently.
A special Valentine's Day dinner had
been planned by the chefs, and we were pre
sented with this menu upon reaching our
table nestled in a corner on the second level.
The four-course meal was designed in the
spirit of experimentation.
Upon reading the choice of appetizers,
it became startlingly obvious that the restau
rant was truly gourmet. I ordered a dish
made of crispy fried oysters, ginger creme

fraiche, cucumber relish
and tobiko caviar. It was
quite succulent, with
the cucumber being the
dominant flavor. Eating
it was almost like

destroying a work of art, because it was so
cleverly and daintily laid on the plate.
The salad was a mix of baby greens,
blood orange and basil vinaigrette dressing,
shaved parmesan and raisins. There must
have been a shortage on the dressing,
because my salad was fairly devoid of flavor.
Not unlike munching on grass, it was diffi
cult to finish the large amount on the plate.
The entree redeemed the salad. A gen
erous portion of tender beef filet was placed
atop truffled mashed potatoes and adorned
with porcini butter, arugula salad and a
sauce that invigorated my taste buds.
The meat was juicy and the potatoes
were delicately seasoned. The flavor was rich
and sweet, but with a country home cooking
feel that was truly superb.
My date chose to order the crabmeat
lasagne, which was served with handmade

Eleven definitely earns

chive pasta, tarragon ricotta and fresh
spinach. Definitely a must for seafood

lovers, the fla
vor was slightly
overwhelming
but still fabu
lous and highly
recommended.
Th e
fourth course
of our meal was
a small piece of
chocolate cake
floating in a
pool of passion
fruit anglaise
and referred to

simply as "Chocolate Decadence." In the
same family as fudge, this dark chocolate
can only be described as the richest and
most concentrated piece of pure and
sweet bitterness ever to cross my lips.
Although it was a chocolate masterpiece,
consuming the entire piece would proba
bly have proven lethal. The sauce comple
mented the dessert, adding a creamy tex
ture and fruity taste that harmonized
with the chocolate itself. It was absolutely
exquisite.
Music was playing in the background
throughout the first part of the meal.
Unfortunately, since we were right
beneath the barn-like wooden rafters
housing the speakers, the volume was at

times overwhelming.
Also, the selection of
music was often inappro
priate. In a fancy
gourmet restaurant
where the recommended
attire is anything except
casual, songs like "High
Hopes" were filling the
room. Although I do have
"high apple pie in the sky
hopes" about life, the
music was better suited
for Disneyland rather
than a romantic
Valentine's dinner.
However, it turns
out that this music was
played to fill the time
before seven o'clock, when
the band Vernon Bush trio

began its performance. One of the most
attractive parts of this restaurant is that the
band plays on an elevated stage in a corner
opposite the second level of seating. This
allows for the music to waft down to the tables
below and to drift across to nearby tables.
The band itself was fantastic and well
chosen for the evening and the ambiance.
Consisting of a singer, piano player, bass
player and drummer, Vernon Bush Trio has a
sophisticated rhythm & blues style.
The sultry and soulful voice of the
singer is enough to inspire even the most
hesitant romantic.
Eleven prides itself on its musical pre
sentations. Live music is featured six nights a
week, ranging in genre from jazz and swing
to hits of the '80s and '90s. Eleven promises
a satisfying, aesthetically pleasing and
intriguing dining experience.
