## why andronico's sucks local supermarkets 
### Nkomo Morris 
Andronico's
500 Shopping Center
Palo Alto, (650) 327-5505
Two women dressed in black sit at a white
table eating gourmet sandwiches. They try not to
make a mess on their Nordstrom's bags, which sit
on a table. One woman stretches her thin lips into
a made-up smile and uses her teeth and wide
mouth to make her point clear to her companion.
I can't hear her; she's too far away. The other
woman smiles and takes a bite of her sandwich.
No doubt they are talking about a Gautier
handkerchief. I smile at them and they scowl at
me. I resist the urge to wink and shimmy for them
as I walked inside. I had just entered a supermar
ket.
Andronico's, the Stanford Shopping
Center's latest attempt to make money, has a
parking lot filled to the brim with Mercedes,
Turbo Audis and BMWs. The white floors, ceil
ings and people made me blink, but aside from
the faint smell of the olive bar (and no wonder,
there are 21 different kinds of olives there) and
Kenny G tinkling over the loudspeaker, I didn't
sense the place at all.
Not surprising. A place like this shouldn't
exist. Even Palo Alto's ritziness has a limit. After
all, there's a Ross there. There are some normal
people in Palo Alto. There aren't any good people

absolutely

in Andronico's. Even the baggers look angry at
you for coming.
There was salad bar, an antipasti bar and a
wine chiller. The sign above the chiller said, "Chill
your favorite white wine here." "White wine" was
in italics. A Pepsi floated in the blue water.
"1 think it's a wonderful place," said Craig,
an employee of a baker called Semifreddi's who
was giving out free samples. But he'd only been
standing in one part of the store and giving out
food. 1 got to walk around the place. "People are
pleasant here," Craig continued. "Seems like a
mixture of customers comes here: older couples,
younger couples, everybody."
Or maybe a mixture of people who just like
free bread. Who knows? All 1 can say is that there
is a large selection of bottled water, some in glass
containers and over 89 different kinds of bottled
beer. Ostrich steaks at the deli cost $14.99 per
pound, and "fresh frying rabbit," fresh quail,
breast of duckling and "cleaned squid tubes" all
cost $4.99 per pound.
Far away from the 89 good beers and not
too far from the imitation crab, there's a small
Wicked Ale display. "Here, poor person, have some
fake crab to go with your cheap beer, and get out
of our store," the displays seemed to say.
"Excuse me," I said to a 30-something man
who paused in front of the hummus section. He
turned around, saw my notebook and looked
ready to spit. "Never mind," I said,"l was going to
ask you a question, but never mind."
I asked an employee who was walking by me as
fast as he could for an annual report. "Call (510) 524-
2630. Someone will connect you to someone who can
help you," he said, and continued rushing.
"Shopping the way it should be?" My ass.

Draeger's
1010 University Drive,
Menlo Park (650) 688-0686
Draeger's in Menlo Park is a lot like
Andronico's, but pleasant. It's clean. Instead of
white everywhere, there's black. Lots of BMWs
and Lexuses in the parking lot. Lots of children
who smile.
Draeger's has some great samples. The man
who was giving out samples of cracker toppings
was very kind. He smiled and talked a lot through
a very thick accent. It didn't matter that I couldn't
understand him. He was genuinely a good person,
and so was everyone else in the two-tier grocery
store.
I asked for an annual report and was told
that the office only gave them out during business
hours. I smiled and took an olive from their bar,
even though I wasn't supposed to. It was quite
good. I promptly left the store.

Whole Foods Market
774 Emerson Street,
Palo Alto (650) 326-8676
Outside of Whole Foods, a tall beautiful
blond woman wearing clingy black spandex pet
ted her dog and stared fixedly at the black man
sitting on a crate holding a Styrofoam cup that
said "sss HELP $$$." A little kid waved to me as 1
ambled towards the door.
Just outside the door, 1 could already feel
where I was. The place smelled like good food,
and employees rushed back and forth sporting
dreadlocks, dyed hair, smiles and friendly faces.
Skinny vegetarians hurried towards the left side of
the store, probably because they saw the salad
bars and couldn't contain themselves.
The people dressed differently here than they
did at Andronico's. Wool sweaters, T-shirts and
sneakers abounded. Very few all-black-wearing
Nordstrom's shoppers. These people bought quality
secondhand clothing at quality secondhand stores.
The floors here were off-white, and someone called
out prices and names over the loudspeaker. It wasn't
sanitized the way Andronico's was, but it was clean.
This was a place where one bought food. I felt my
shoulders drop as I exhaled and entered the store.
Everyone else looked relaxed, probably
because of the massage parlor in the front of the
store. It costs SI for every minute of massage with

a 15-minute minimum.
There were 200 different kinds of beer here,
and nine different types of olives at the olive bar,
which 1 didn't smell. They were in the back of the
store by the cheeses. There was a sign over them:
"Please ... no fingers! If you need to taste an olive,
please use the spoons to get the sample into your
hand. And please use the trash cans for the pits."
Toothpicks kill trees, and trash cans are somehow
offensive to the clientele, 1 guess. At Andronico's,
there was no such sign. Either olive etiquette is a
type of innate knowledge at Andronico's or they
won't deign to tell you.
"Hi," said one particularly chipper red
haired man. His name tag said, "Brett." "Can 1 help
you?" I told him no, but he persisted. "Are you
doing a report or something? Can 1 answer any
questions for you?" I smiled. This was my kind of
reception.
Behind him, I could see the types of dog food
they sell. 1 didn't recognize any of them: Mr.
Barky's, Granpaws and Natural Life Pet Products.
They didn't call it dog food here; it was dog food
formula.
"I think it's a lot more relaxed [than
Andronico's] here," Brett said. "A lot more laid
back. We have different quality standards. We
don't carry anything with artificial colors, flavors,
or preservatives."
That explained the dog food.
Brett was young, he had a goatee, his teeth
were straight, and he looked happy to be doing
his job. I would be, too.
Brett offered me the annual report and had
the assistant store manager talk to me for a bit.
The assistant store manager told me to pick out
something I wanted to try. I hesitated. "Don't be
shy," he said. "I mean it. It's on the store."
Will I go back to Whole Foods? Yes. Will I
say "Hi" to Brett? Yes. Is Andronico's an embar
rassing sore on the face of Palo Alto and the world
in general? Guess.
