1943: In the midst of the
Nazi occupation of Zagreb, Croatia, 22-year-old playwright Radovan Ivsic
wrote a fairy-tale tragedy about the rise of a totalitarian regime
under the control of a megalomaniac.

The spectacular, shocking and often unsettling result of Ivsic's efforts, "King
Gordogan," has been translated into numerous languages and performed
throughout Europe. First performed in the United States last year in New
York City, it will make its West Coast premiere this weekend in Stanford
University's Little Theater in Memorial Hall. The playwright is flying in from Paris
for the occasion.
The vibrant production boasts simple characters, a nonstop urgency of
motion and unpredictable plot twists.
"King Gordogan" is strikingly visually rich due in part to the masks many
of the characters wear. Actor Awetu Simesso, who works at Hoover Institute,
described the play as "strange to begin with, and the masks just make it take off."
The masks were designed and handcrafted by director Evan Winet, a grad
uate student in the Stanford Drama Department, and by Balinese artist Ida Bagus
Alit. Constructed of wood and leather, they meld European surrealism and
Indonesian mythic themes.
Complemented by elaborate costumes and abstract scenery, the masks sever
the play from reality. They help transport the actors and the audience into a mag
ical world where a stable boy becomes king, a prince falls in love with an impris
oned princess and a valiant knight loses his memory.
Drawing on his background in the Italian dramatic form of commedia del
l'arte, Winet has masked all of the grotesque and comic characters but has left bare
the faces of the lovers and the fool.
Learning to act in a mask has been a challenge for the actors, who, Winet
said, are accustomed to acting from within and expressing emotion through sub
tle facial gestures.
According to freshman actor Stanislav Yudenko, when you put on a mask,
"all of a sudden you lose your facial expression. You can only show mood and feel
ings with your body." The actor must use exaggerated physical movement and
vocal intonation, thereby heightening both the comic and horrific aspects of the
play.
In the tradition of commedia dell'arte, Winet has also provided audience
seating onstage. The actors address many of their lines directly to the audience.
Although the play maintains the imaginary fourth wall between audience and
actors, Winet assured that "the audience is going to be confronted."
"King Gordogan" is about a stable boy, Gordogan, who seizes power and
tyrranizes his kingdom. The play follows his treatment of friends and enemies and
the reactions of his subjects. It also explores the extent of terror, abuse and carnage
that a bloodthirsty man can cause when bestowed with unbridled power.
For Winet, the verbal construction of the play is its most captivating aspect.
"The language," he explained, "has been both a joy and a challenge to work with."
Many events in the play occur simultaneously, necessitating complex blocking.
"Language constructs reality," Winet said. In "King Gordogan," language is
just as thematically important as it is aesthetically pleasing. Because words are one

of the foundations of King Gordogan's political regime, changes in name symbolize
a change in status.
Although set in a fictional world peopled by overtly simple characters, the
play is bound very tightly to the real world by universal themes. The story
describes the social unrest that allows a Hitler-figure to gain power. In Winet's
view, "The rise of evil isn't an act of a single individual against an oppressed peo
ple. It occurs in a world already constantly falling apart. The tyrant uses cleverness
to exploit a pre-existent hierarchy."
The play also supports an underlying theme of love and explores the possi
bility that love can conquer terror.
The finale is the most controversial part of the play. Although Yudenko was
originally frustrated by the lack of a conventional conclusion, he now likes it. "It's
very original," he said. "It keeps your attention and stays fresh in your memory
because you think about it."
