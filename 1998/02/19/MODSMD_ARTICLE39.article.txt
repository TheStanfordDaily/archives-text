"The first memory 1 have is of needing to take a shit at
my mother's funeral."
And with an opening line slightly reminiscent of a
famous Camus novel that begins "So I killed a few people
...," Gary Ruderman and David Summers' black comedy
about a serial killer who has one week left to live begins.

Archie Nunn (played by Summers) has
been condemned to die but he has been
granted his last wish through a special
loophole in the legal system: to perform
before an audience. "So I killed a few peo
ple ..." is his final performance, and it
ranges from frank and comic to ... well,
dare I say, psychotic?
Nunn's take on pop culture is often
right on and hilarious. His jokes seem to
connect with both the younger and older
members of the audience. Unable to use
his victim's names ("Killing them's one
thing, but violating their privacy — no!"),
he relies instead on the monikers of
famous sitcom stars.
Archie tells about the affinity that lone
ly women and performance artists seem
to have for him, and he reveals the secrets
of Disneyland: "All of the characters in
costume are really crack addicts." Later, he

brags about his engineer father's failed attempt to reduce
the "redundancy of 'It's a Small World.' "
"So I killed a few people ..." admirably attempts to
incorporate a serious element into Nunn's otherwise
comedic rant. In fact, much of the humor plays on the
dichotomy between Nunn's entertaining perspective and
the utter seriousness of his imminent execution.
This polarity adds dimension to Nunn's character, and
his oscillating moods make him a much more believable
killer. But this added quality comes at a cost: at times the
play falls victim to an uneven pace, which makes Nunn's
more sober reflections appear to be mere downtime before
his next sarcastic or insightful comment. This is even more
troublesome given the length of the actual play, which
clocks in at the time span of an episode of "ER."
In addition, the play faces a problematic issue that one
imagines anyone writing a "one-man-serial-killer-come
dy" would have to face: how to explain the life of a serious
criminal without resorting to the usual (though often
true) cliches of causation. Nunn tackles this issue head on
in the first few minutes by lying and then retracting the
statement that he is the son of an alcoholic mother and
abusive father and that he was gang-raped by Eagle Scouts
at 15.
Eventually the play must honestly grapple with Nunn's

'Killing
them's one
thing, but
violating
their
privacy —
no!'

psychosis and what led him to his prolific career. Here is,
perhaps, the main flaw of "So I killed a few people..." Let
me assemble the not-so-subtle clues: Nunn's constant ref
erences to TV stars and slogans, his mention of his former
career (advertising copywriter), his cornucopia of pop
culture references and his final admission of guilt in

killing his mother after she destroyed their
television. The audience is constantly
pushed to believe that the influence of tele
vision, combined with a whopping dose of
psychosis, rotted Nunn's brain, nourished
his insanity and finally pushed him to create

his own sitcoms of death.
Granted, it may have been
hard to avoid using any cliches
or stereotypes when writing a
play about a serial killer.
Many of Nunn's funniest
moments come not from his
allusions to television but
from his ironic commentary
on the hypocrisy of the justice
system and his own experience
in prison. For example, since
the guards are afraid he might
pull what Nunn terms a
"MacGyver," they will not

allow him to have a ruler. Instead, Nunn
resorts to measuring the space of his cell in
"archicocks" (the length of his erect penis).
Despite the fact that it has to resort to
cliches,"So 1 Killed a few people ..." is over
all an enjoyable, and to say the least, differ
ent experience. The TV cliche which could
have been a major distraction is instead a
minor annoyance, for Summers' excellent
portrayal of Nunn is believable, engaging
and helps make "So I killed a few people ..."
appear to be an innovative take on the
rather trite idea of the corruptive influence
of television. Summers' flickering eyes and
directed comments towards and about the
audience are realistic as well as disturbing,
which made me wish 1 wasn't sitting in the
second row of the tiny Cable Car Theater.
And just a note on the Cable Car Theater,
where "So I killed a few people ..." plays for
the next six weeks. Apparently a few audience
members were so moved by Summers' char
acter that they felt the need to respond and
connect with this affable killer. One man even
attempted to argue with Nunn in the middle

of the play. Hip San Francisco theater people ... go figure
