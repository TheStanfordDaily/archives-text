Julia Dinsmore shared her thoughts on
poverty and her experiences as a poor single
mother in a public service dialogue at Lan
tana last night Over 30 people attended the
event.
Dinsmore who will spend this week per
forming her music and speaking on topics re
lating to stx'ial justice began the dialogue,
titled. "Artistic Expression as Action: Songs.
Poems and Social Justice." with acoustic gui
tar tunes.
Dinsmore described her li\int> conditions

in Minneapolis, where, she said, the soil in her
neighborhood is lead-laced, and her son suf
lered copper poisoning. However, her songs
speak not only of suffering hut also of faith.
Dinsmore wrote "Oh. Little One" when
she was pregnant with her first son. "Oh. little
one inside of me. what kind of world are you
going to see?" she sang. "Will you learn to
have faith in the powers unseen?"
Reading aloud from one of her many
poems. Dinsmore said. "A rose is the song of
life It tells of the pain, the sacrifice, the love
that gi\es us life."
Political action and artistic expression are
powerfully bound. Dinsmore sug
gested. emphasizing the political
content of her art.
"Art is a powerful way to move
society forward." she said.
In her discussion of the politics of
poverty, Dinsmore criticized current
measures in welfare reform as "dis
gusting," and she further challenged
Stanford students to speak up for the
least advantaged members of society.
"Stop this barbarism," Dinsmore
said. "Any culture that doesn't take
care of its mothers and children
doesn't survive."
"I'm sick to death of what people
are doing to "welfare mothers.' "
Dinsmore said. In this country,
"mothering has the status of a

hobby."
In addition to discussing current
politics. Dinsmore addressed class
issues and criticized the overly acad
emic study of the poor as "misguided
energy" that could be used to actual
ly change conditions, she said.
"[Academics] are always study
ing us." she said. "Why don't we
have suburban studies or classes on
owning-class culture? We [living in
poverty] want to be part of the con
versation. Can I have a hand in my
own liberation?"
The "public service mentality."
she said, is reminiscent of the "let's
go-save-the-savages mentality."
Dinsmore told a story about a local
church in Minneapolis that worked
with her and others to develop hous
ing plans but also decided to help the
poor children of her neighborhood
by giving them dance lessons.

"These kids don't even have
shoes," Dinsmore said, calling into
question the benefits of such "ser
vice."
Dinsmore's series of talks and
performances this week, titled "My
Name is Not 'Those People,'" is
named for the poem she wrote after
overhearing the following statement
about poor people: "Those people
don't need homes â€” we give them
turkeys at Christmas."
Ironically, her poem was pub
lished in the very same newsletter
edited by the man who made the
statement. Reflecting on the circum
stances surrounding her first pub
lished work, Dinsmore quipped,
"God has a sense of humor."
Dinsmore's poems have not only
made their way into American polit
ical life but into the halls of Congress
as well. Her work has been read on

the Senate floor by U.S. Sen. Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota.
The dialogue and Dinsmore's
other talks and performances are
part of the yearlong Challenges and
Dilemmas of Public Service Dia
logue Series sponsored by the Haas
Center for Public Service.
Senior Kelly Naylor. who is one
of the students coordinating the dia
logue series, said she and others
wanted to bring Dinsmore to Stan
ford after reading her poems.
"A lot of us had read [Dins
more's] poetry and were inspired by
her. She taught us through her
work," Naylor said.
Dinsmore will speak at the
Women's Center today at noon.
Other events include a lunch tomor
row at the Haas Center and a perfor
mance later at 4 p.m. at the Book
store.
