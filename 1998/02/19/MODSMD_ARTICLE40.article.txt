El Nino flooding like-named folks with angry calls
Tired of the rain? Don't blame Al Nino.
The retired Navy man is getting a bit tired of phone calls from people complaining about the weather.
Most of the time he's able to joke, said Alfonso Nino, who pronounces his last name NEE-no. The name of the weather
phenomenon drenching California is pronounced El NEE-nyo.
"It's always something like, 'Why are you doing this?'And I say, 'Well, I really didn't have nothing else to do. I thought
maybe it would be kind of fun,'" he told the San Jose Mercury News.
But it was no longer funny when one caller woke him up recently at 2 a.m. with an obscene tirade about the weather.
"Usually it doesn't bother me, but that one was really disturbing. She was really mad," said Nino, who lives in the southern
San Luis Obispo County town of Nipomo.
Nino isn't the only person called by jokesters, drunks and the ill-tempered who bother looking them up in the phone book.
One, a real El Nino, even takes part in the fun. Eliseo Nino, a retired physical-education teacher in San Gabriel, has a vani
ty license plate reading "L Nino" for 28 years.
"Everybody makes a comment about it every time I go someplace," he said of his name.
They'd also like to know when he plans to end the series of storms bringing unusually heavy rains that have caused flood
ing and mudslides.
"I don't know. I think I'm going to have it come around on Friday," Eliseo Nino said. "Or maybe the weekend."
