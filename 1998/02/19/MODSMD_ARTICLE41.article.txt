## Welcome to Illyria Danielle Steele meets Shakespeare 
### Hannah Blair 
With writers like Alison Lurie around,
it's hard to believe anyone reads
Danielle Steele.
That's not to say that Lurie's latest effort,
"Real People" (Owl Books, $12.00) is super
market check stand fare. But it does have all the
pieces in place. The protagonist is a sympathet
ic woman, middle-aged but still sexy. The set
ting, an artists' colony in upstate New York, is
picturesque but highly unlikely. The bother
some details of real life rarely intrude. The sex
scenes border on soft-core porn at points
(though Lurie wisely forgoes ridiculous nick
names for body parts). The story is peopled
with types, rather than characters: the catty gay
painter, the egotistical and vulgar pop sculptor,
the sensitive lady writer and the regal and
proper matriarch.
But Lurie manages to give her story
weight, wit and entertainment value without
making it seem like "literature." Dostoevsky it
certainly isn't, but as Joyce Carol Oates says on
the jacket, it might very well be a modern ver
sion of Jane Austen. Certainly Austen's subtle
wit infuses the book. Without being obtrusive
or malicious, Lurie pokes gentle, genteel fun at
all of her characters.
The narrator is Janet Belle Smith, a "sen
sitive lady writer" much like Austen herself.
Smith is married to an insurance agent who
loves his job. They have two well-behaved chil
dren, a beautiful house in Westford, New York
and a plethora of friendly neighbors. Janet's
husband sees their life together as domestic
bliss, if not perfection; Janet finds it artistically
stifling. She's surrounded with enough material
for 100,000 stories but can write none of them
— what if her friends and neighbors read her

work and recognize themselves? Her subject
matter shrinks with each passing day, until all
her stories are about placid domesticity and she
can hardly write at all.
So Janet does the only thing she can: she
leaves Westford despite the protests of her hus
band and children. She goes to spend three
weeks at an artists' colony named Illyria.
Lurie's Illyria is just as enchanted as
Shakespeare's. Here all Janet's mundane needs
are attended to — her room is tidied for her,
her meals are served and her bed is made. All
she has to do is write.
But life in Lurie's Illyria proves to be just
as convoluted as "Twelfth Night," and even more
distracting than life in Westford. The rest of the
artists in residence embroil themselves in one
knotty scandal after another, and Janet is quick
ly drawn in. The book itself is the journal of her
stay, full of pointed observations about those
people around her. The characters may be types,
but Lurie endows them with enough interesting
human qualities to make them seem more like
real people than animated cardboard cutouts.
And that's the crucial difference between
Lurie and the rest of the writers on the rack in
the supermarket — intelligence. Sure, there are
other differences too — Lurie wins Pulitzers,
for one thing, and her covers haven't a hint of
swirling gold letters, heaving bosoms or
embossed pictures of Fabio.
"Real People" is just as diverting as any
thing Harlequin puts out, and it's smarter, too
— it lets the reader laugh. It entertains and
even titillates a little, but it doesn't condescend.
It doesn't leave the reader feeling stupid, and it
doesn't leave a bad taste in the mouth.
Danielle Steele, eat your heart out.
