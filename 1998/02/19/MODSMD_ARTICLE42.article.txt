did not commit!"

Hang around the sidelines of a Stanford foot
ball game long enough and you'll hear these
chants (and others) shouted from the ranks of
sports-crazed students spurred to a frenzy by the
antics of the Stanford Band, the Tree and the
newly-formed yell squad.
Observe almost any Stanford athletic event,
ranging from field hockey to football to basket
ball to water polo, and you're likely to see some
spirited student cheering wildly for his friend, his
classmate, his team.
You may watch the lively dances of the dollies,
you may tremble at the gyrations of the Tree, you
may join a cheer led by the pink-shirted yell
squad, but the sidelines of Stanford athletics are
empty of any organized, independent cheerlead
ing squad.

A short history of Stanford cheerleading
In such a big-name athletic program, the
lack of such a staple of college life is surpris
ing. Where are the cheerleaders?
This year marked the death of the most
recent incarnation of the Stanford cheer
leading squad. The program, which didn't
last very long, was the only significant
attempt since the 1960s to form a spirit group
independent of the Band. After discussion with
the cheerleaders and the Band, the Athletic
Department decided to end funding for the
cheerleaders last spring. The decision left many

students questioning exactly what the role of
cheerleading has been at Stanford and what it
should be.
The Stanford cheerleading tradition is hardly
well-defined. Before the most recent program
ended, Stanford history could hardly boast of
any group that fit the stereotype of traditional
cheerleaders. Even in the heady first few decades
of school spirit, Stanford's way of doing things
was a little different.
The first organized attempts to rally student
support at Stanford athletic events are lost to
antiquity. Until the 19505, gymnastic-style cheer
leading throughout the country was a secondary
concern of the spirit groups that had led student
bodies in chants, card stunts and fight songs for
decades. Even when the now-stereotypical female
cheerleading squad became widespread in other
schools, the idea never caught on at The Farm.
Most of the student athletic spirit in the last
40 years came from the rallying Band and their
"pom-pon girls" (before they were called pom -
poms), the predecessors to today's dollies. With
such entertainers already in uniform and in the
bleachers, the push for a regimented cheerlead
ing group seemed counterproductive.

Even in the heady first few decades of
school spirit, Stanford's way of doing
things was a little different.

The recent experiment in organizing a cheer
leading squad was unique in Stanford history.
The cheerleading program was an ambitious
effort. It was largely autonomous, reported

directly to the Athletic Department and catered
to a student body which had rarely shown signif
icant interest in its existence. The program was
an attempt to establish a new tradition that
could, eventually, compare with similar large
scale groups around the country and in the Pac-10.
With such an open niche, why did the experi
ment fail? After only a few years, why replace the
cheerleading tradition with an older, long-dor
mant one like the yell squad?
Bob Carruesco, an assistant athletic director,
says that Stanford sidelines often have a different
feel to them than those of a school with a more
traditional cheerleading program. "When you
come out and play a game against a Kentucky or
someone ... and they've got these cheer squads
tumbling out of the gym — it's hard to compete
against [that amount of spirit]."
Finding an alternative
The Athletic Department spoke last spring ith
members of the Band and the cheerleading
squad about how to enhance the atmosphere at
home events. Student response to the cheerlead
ing program had always been mixed. Typical
criticisms included the lack of coordination

between the Band and the cheer
leaders and the lack of interaction
between the cheerleaders and the
student crowd.
Given the lackluster student
reaction and the tension created by
dividing the crowd's attention
between the cheerleaders and the

Band, the Athletic Department decided to go in a
different direction.
The Athletic Department researched different
ways of drawing attention to the cheerleaders
when the Band was playing. The choices then

boiled down to only a few: "We could stay where we
are; we could try and coordinate with the Band; or we
could go yell, like Cal," said Carruesco.
The last option interested the Athletic Department
for historical reasons; the yell squad had been a part of
Stanford athletics earlier this century. The Band also
expressed significant interest in bringing back the old
tradition and offered to coordinate a yell group.
The yell squad tradition
Yell leaders have been present at nearly every foot
ball game since the University's establishment in 1891.
The custom of having enterprising students organize
the "rooting section" is well-worn in Stanford athletic
history.
The first Stanford yell is generally credited to J.R.
Whittemore, who in 1892 led the meeting that selected
cardinal as the school color and created the school's
first yell. That prototype chant was simple but effective:
"Rah, rah, rah! Rah, rah, rah! Rah! Rah! Stanford!" As
current yell leader Andy Bradley observed, "When you
can get a lot of people excited about just saying 'rah,'
you've got something special."
That meeting spurred nearly a century of organized
yell activities and began a tradition of respect for the

position of the yell
leader. Under the guid
ance of the yell squad,
chants rapidly became
more complex and
structured. Classes
began developing their
own yells, starting with
the Class of 1894,
which led the crowd
pleasing "Ha, ha, ha!
Wah, whoo, wah!
Ninety-four! Ninety
four! Rah, rah, rah!"
The class yell tra
dition continued for
another 25 years, with
some classes being
slightly more creative
than others. Compare,
for example, the Class
of 1896, who spelled
out their class year in
Roman numerals —
"Rah, rah, ruh! Rah,
rah, rix! M - D three

C! X - C six!" — with the somewhat less innovative
Class of 1910 - "Nineteen-ten! Nineteen-ten! Stanford!
Stanford! Nineteen-ten!"
By 1924, the yell leader position had grown impor
tant enough for the University to create a yell leading
course, which satisfied the physical education require
ment, and included such lectures as "Bleacher
Psychology" and "Development of Stage Presence."
Responsibility for the organization of the students
increasingly fell into the hands of Rally Com, a student
committee that regulated the traditions and uses of the
ever more complicated and structured yells and songs.

"When you can get a lot of
people excited about just
saying 'rah,' you've got
something special."

Through the 1930s and 19405, Rally Com carefully set
the regulations for the yells, organized the rooting sec
tions and led the students in the chants.
Until 1946, the Axe Cheer was forbidden at any

game but Big Game. Full-time spotters were employed
during football games to call cues when players were
substituted in, an event for which a whole set of chants
and yells were developed. The idea of the tightly orga
nized yell squad was best realized in this era, and the
yell leaders assumed their highest status on campus.
By the 19505, though, RallyCom's power had
decayed, and with its crumbling came a massive
decrease in the unity of student spirit efforts. By the
mid-19605, despite the increasing zaniness of the Band,
organized efforts to focus student spirit had largely fall
en off. A Daily letter to the editor on Nov. 18, 1966, put
it bluntly: "The rah-rah spirit, the huge rallies, the
blindly enthusiastic cheering section — all are disap
pearing." The yell squad had, without any central orga
nization, largely disappeared, and the yell leader's pres
ence was no longer felt at the Stanford sidelines. By the
beginning of the 19705, the yell leader position was offi
cially eliminated for nearly a decade.
Stanford's last yell squad prior to the current one
began in 1977. Despite an ASSU resolution that
Stanford "needed yell leaders as much as it needed more
nerds," the yell squad returned to the field to revitalize
sagging student spirit. Clark Sterling, one of those new
yell leaders, said the new squad aimed to "surprise the
crowd by being just as unique as the Band and the dol
lies." The program lasted a few years, but could never
compete with the other facets of the Band and received
lukewarm student response.
Without the continuous tradition that the Band
had behind it, the program quietly disappeared over the
next 10 years. Until the recent cheerleading experiment,
only the Band and the dollies remained.
Dancing doilies
The dollies have always walked a fine line between
cheerleading and dancing, between organizing and per
forming. The five women - there's never been a male
dollie - have been considered adjuncts to the Band
since its inception. They do all their own choreography,
coordinate their own interactions with the music of the
Band and play a large part in selecting their successors.
Most students bring considerable dance or performance
experience to tryouts. Some come from more non tra
ditional backgrounds. Dollie applicants have been fig
ure skaters, varsity athletes or just interested rookie
dancers.
Since the 19605, the dollies have been very clear
about their roles; they're dancers, not cheerleaders.
They lead no yells and they take no part in crowd

chants. They dance. Hilda Hutchinson, a dollie in 1975,
said that at one basketball game, "the cameramen kept
asking us for a cheer. But we don't do that. We just get
down and boogie."
More recently, the model for the dollies has been
athletic: "In the way some people play basketball or vol
leyball, [dancing] is our sport," said Julie Cuevas, a
1995-96 dollie.
No other independent cheerleading squad could
have the precise coordination that the dollies have with
the Band. They learn 28 dances - many of them to
decades-old traditional songs - and choreograph them
to the Band's music. By being part of the Band, the dol
lies avoid one of the most critical problems the cheer
leading squad faced: they don't have to compete with
the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band
for attention.

A spirited future
The Band's interest in coordinating the new yell pro
gram is understandable. As the Athletic Department
sees it, the yell squad is beneficial to everyone con
cerned. "I think it's been a good move," Carruesco says.
"The whole thing has a lot more flow to it." Andy
Bradley — one of this year's yell leaders and the Band's
half-time announcer — points to timing as the critical
element in crowd management. "The Band," he says, "is
the only organized way for students to get into the
game," and any efforts to support the Band should be
precisely coordinated.
Bradley says that he's pleased with the direction of
school spirit at Stanford and particularly with the
response to the yell squad. The program had its trial
run at the San Jose State football game Sept. 6, when
Chris Bonzon (former Tree) assembled a "severely
hung-over" Bradley with a handful of other students to

help lead the lack
adaisical crowd.
Bonzon had been heav
ily involved in talks
with the Athletic
Department concern
ing the creation of the
new yell squad the pre
vious spring, and he
had been placed in the
position of creating
and leading the provi
sional group.
The first run went
well enough for
Bonzon to assemble an
initial team of six yell
leaders, which quickly
grew to 10 after try
outs. The yell leaders
are present at football,
men's and women's
basketball, and
women's volleyball
games, and their pres
ence has quickly grown
familiar to Stanford
sports fans.
Student response to
the yell squad seems
positive. The return of
the Axe Cheer and the
Stanford Spell-Out at

Big Game were powerful motivators of crowd energy.
Other quirkier chants have ranged from new creations
to traditional mantras like "That's alright, that's okay,
you'll all work for us someday." Most students enjoy the
yell leaders' attitude.
Freshman Pat Linehan says, "They're crazy, zany.
They've got a sense of humor." Freshman Durant
Gipson is blunt: "They're great." The quirkiness, though,
is a little much for some students. Won Kim said, "The
idea's good, in theory, but in practice, they can get really
annoying. They say some really stupid things."
Bradley concedes that the squad is "still trying to
find [its) niche." Most students seem to agree the yell
squad is more representative of the Stanford athletic
spirit than the traditional cheerleading squad. "At such
a rich school like this, it's our little form of rebellion,
like the Band," says Kendall Benson.
The future of the yell squad seems assured. The
Athletic Department supports the squad and proposes
to continue the program in the future. They have no
plans to bring back a cheerleading program. "If some
one was to come back, a gymnastics coach, with a
bunch of students with experience who said, hey, we
want to do cheerleading, then we might consider it,"
Carruesco said. "We didn't feel we had all the resources
necessary to manage a group with tumbling and all the
athletic routines." The yell squad is just more financially
viable.
The yell leaders also seem optimistic about their
future. Tryouts for new members of the squad will be
held in April, and both the squad and the Athletic
Department have ideas for its development. Carruesco
suggests the Athletic Department might look into pro
fessional training for the squad — "some professional
help with cues and that sort of thing" — as a future
plan. Bradley is somewhat more ambitious. Ultimately,
he says, they'd like to redefine the student section at
athletic events, particularly at football and basketball
games. Groups like the Sixth Man, Bradley says, should
"become more involved, as opposed to the traditional
student section." Ideally, the athletic events should re
emphasize their focus on the student spectators and the
interaction between the game and the crowd.
As time goes on, the yell squad may return to its
place as one of the treasured traditions in Stanford ath
letics. "We want to amplify the flavor" of Stanford spir
it, Bradley says. We may never again hear such classic
songs as "California, Here We Come," or "Sons Of
Stanford Red," ringing from the crowds. Stanford spec
tators, though, can be sure that the sidelines are going
to see a lot more veiling.
