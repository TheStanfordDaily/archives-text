## Rah Rah Rah! Rah Rah Rah! why doesn t Stanford have leaders?

"Kill! Maim! Dismember!"
"Punish them! Punish them! For crimes they
did not commit!"
"Repeated physical blows is all they'll under
stand!"
Hang around the sidelines of a Stanford foot
ball game long enough and you'll hear these
chants (and others) shouted from the ranks of
sports-crazed students spurred to a frenzy by the
antics of the Stanford Band, the Tree and the
newly-formed yell squad.
Observe almost any Stanford athletic event,
ranging from field hockey to football to basket
ball to water polo, and you're likely to see some
spirited student cheering wildly for his friend, his
classmate, his team.
You may watch the lively dances of the dollies,
you may tremble at the gyrations of the Tree, you
may join a cheer led by the pink-shirted yell
squad, but the sidelines of Stanford athletics are
empty of any organized, independent cheerlead
ing squad.

A short history of Stanford cheerleading
In such a big-name athletic program, the
lack of such a staple of college life is surpris
ing. Where are the cheerleaders?
This year marked the death of the most
recent incarnation of the Stanford cheer
leading squad. The program, which didn't
last very long, was the only significant
attempt since the 1960s to form a spirit group
independent of the Band. After discussion with
the cheerleaders and the Band, the Athletic
Department decided to end funding for the
cheerleaders last spring. The decision left many

students questioning exactly what the role of
cheerleading has been at Stanford and what it
should be.
The Stanford cheerleading tradition is hardly
well-defined. Before the most recent program
ended, Stanford history could hardly boast of
any group that fit the stereotype of traditional
cheerleaders. Even in the heady first few decades
of school spirit, Stanford's way of doing things
was a little different.
The first organized attempts to rally student
support at Stanford athletic events are lost to
antiquity. Until the 19505, gymnastic-style cheer
leading throughout the country was a secondary
concern of the spirit groups that had led student
bodies in chants, card stunts and fight songs for
decades. Even when the now-stereotypical female
cheerleading squad became widespread in other
schools, the idea never caught on at The Farm.
Most of the student athletic spirit in the last
40 years came from the rallying Band and their
"pom-pon girls" (before they were called pom -
poms), the predecessors to today's dollies. With
such entertainers already in uniform and in the
bleachers, the push for a regimented cheerlead
ing group seemed counterproductive.

Even in the heady first few decades of
school spirit, Stanford's way of doing
things was a little different.

The recent experiment in organizing a cheer
leading squad was unique in Stanford history.
The cheerleading program was an ambitious
effort. It was largely autonomous, reported

directly to the Athletic Department and catered
to a student body which had rarely shown signif
icant interest in its existence. The program was
an attempt to establish a new tradition that
could, eventually, compare with similar large
scale groups around the country and in the Pac-10.
With such an open niche, why did the experi
ment fail? After only a few years, why replace the
cheerleading tradition with an older, long-dor
mant one like the yell squad?
Bob Carruesco, an assistant athletic director,
says that Stanford sidelines often have a different
feel to them than those of a school with a more
traditional cheerleading program. "When you
come out and play a game against a Kentucky or
someone ... and they've got these cheer squads
tumbling out of the gym — it's hard to compete
against [that amount of spirit]."
Finding an alternative
The Athletic Department spoke last spring ith
members of the Band and the cheerleading
squad about how to enhance the atmosphere at
home events. Student response to the cheerlead
ing program had always been mixed. Typical
criticisms included the lack of coordination

between the Band and the cheer
leaders and the lack of interaction
between the cheerleaders and the
student crowd.
Given the lackluster student
reaction and the tension created by
dividing the crowd's attention
between the cheerleaders and the

Band, the Athletic Department decided to go in a
different direction.
The Athletic Department researched different
ways of drawing attention to the cheerleaders
when the Band was playing. The choices then
