It's catchy, the boys can sing
and Gladhands seem so
sweet and earnest that I real
ly wanted to like them. But
somewhere between the whole
some harmonizing on the open
ing track and the ode to the
Gore daughters, I had to give up.
At its best, the band has an
appealing Weezer-esque style,
but more often it gets bogged
down by boring guitar solos,
"bah bah bahs" and overpro
duction.
Every good song seems to be
immediately countered by a
horrible one, as though the pro
ducers couldn't quite decide
how they wanted these boys to
sound. The bubble gum and
cotton-candy catchiness of "La
Di Da" leaves you with a big
smile on your face, but it's
quickly destroyed by the
painful "Smallsville." This song's
lighthearted take on

alienation could have been
interesting, but instead finds
itself hurt (or, more
appropriately, mortally
wounded) by its vocals, which
are scarily reminiscent of 1980s
big-hair rock.
However, Gladhands do
incorporate a variety of instru
ments into its songs — an
impressive feat for a band of
only two people. And in the end,
the band does serve up catchy,
(if somewhat predictable) pop
that could easily serve as great
background music to the slow
motion hallway and beach
scenes of Dawson's Creek or
Beverly Hills 90210. Despite its
faults, I still found myself hum
ming the title track and wishing
I had nicer things to say.
