# THE 						GADJITS
## 
### 
If I ever meet the person who created Hellcat
records, I'm going to give him a big fat kiss.
First they sign lots of cool ska bands. Then
they put out a great ska / oi compilation that
costs five bucks. And now? They bring Kansas
City's ska-oriented band the Gadjits to my dorm
room by releasing "At Ease."
The four people who make up the Gadjits
have an average age of just under 17, yet they
put many older and more established bands to
shame.
With a clean, bopping sound and a vocalist
who actually can sing, the Gadjits explore '50s
rock, swing and a bit of rocksteady by putting
them all to the ska.
Opening "At Ease" with "Bullet in the
Mattress," the Gadjits set the pace for the rest of
the album.
The song delivers a highly sing-along-able
chorus, an engaging story of a woman who
shoots her husband for having an affair and
some simple but effective instrumentals.
"Sh'Bop" follows with a bass and keyboard
line that sounds suspiciously like that "Feeling
Hot Hot Hot" song, but it is easy to forgive the
Gadjits for this faux pas when they manage to
deliver a happening ska song that could have
been included in the soundtrack to "Grease" if
only the Gadjits were 20 years older.
The middle of the album is not as strong as
the two opening songs, but it nonetheless is an
enjoyable listen. "Seat 6" slows down the pace

with a lounge/rocksteady combination that is
nothing special. "Tell Yourself" is also a
mediocre offering, carrying the Gadjits' token
simplicity to an extreme and sounding like early
Reel Big Fish in the process.
But there are definitely gems to be found in
the remainder of the album — in fact there are
quite a few of them.
"Traffic Tickets" regains the infectious energy
of the first two tracks, yielding a clever, dance
able song while "Party Girl" shows promise as a
Gadjits anthem with its fun lyrics and use of
call-and-response.
"Need Yo' Luv" gives a good picture of what
would happen if Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee
Lewis formed a ska band, combining '50s rock
rhythms with some nice keyboard work and the
ska upbeat
"At Ease" proves to be a solid release for the
Gadjits. It is consistent, smooth and lively. The
four-person band works well together, synthe
sizing guitar, bass, drums, keys and vocals into
music with the help of an additional key
boardist and a sax player.
Though "At Ease" is neither musically com
plex stylistically original, the Gadjits make it a
success by doing what they know how to do best
— playing strong, tight tunes that prove that the
Midwest can hold its own when it comes to ska.
