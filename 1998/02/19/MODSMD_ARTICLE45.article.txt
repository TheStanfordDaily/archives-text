# BIG WRECK
## 
### 
Big Wreck couldn't have picked a better name. Although
there is the slight possibility that it's a tongue-in-cheek joke.
But I won't bet on it.
You'd think the world had reached it maximum capacity
for Soundgarden rip-off bands already. But Big Wreck has
managed to find its niche by adding another sound into the
mix, a sound that differs with every track. 1 will explain.
For example, on the opening song "The Oaf," the famous
melody of "Baba O'Rielly" by The Who drives the song.
On "That Song," (ooh, creative title), Big Wreck uses the
distinct guitar style of Guns 'N Roses' Slash.
"Look What I Found" combines of the Dog project. Even

bands like U2 get thrown into the mix. "Blown Wide Open"
combines — you guessed it, Soundgarden — with the soft
lyrical ballad style of "Joshua Tree" era U2. This is actually
one of the better tracks.
It's not that Big Wreck is really bad. They're just bad, and
completely unoriginal. Why listen to them when you could
listen to Soundgarden, The Who, Guns 'N Roses, Pearl Jam
or U2?
There's a big market for Adult Contemporary these days.
Witness the success of bands like Hootie and the Blowfish
and the Dave Matthews Band. Both of them stink, but have
platinum albums.

Anything can happen in this day and age.
A friend of mine was in Europe six months ago, when the
Spice Girls were starting to hit. She bought a CD single to
play for us, to show how bad the scene is over there. Imagine
her surprise when she returned to the good ol' USA and
found the Spice Girls on the cover of magazines everywhere.
Which is not to say that Big Wreck is the Spice Girls. But
they'd be a hell of a lot better if they were.
