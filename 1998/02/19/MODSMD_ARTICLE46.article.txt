# FUNKDOOBIEST

Heavy drum breaks, thumping bass lines, old school
scratching, synthesizergenerated melodies and an eclec
tic mix of samples. Bust out the BBQ. Funkdoobiest's
newest album
"The Troubleshooters" starts summer four months
early. Funkdoobiest put out a great debut album,

"Which Doobie U B," although it was,
musically and lyrically, a clear Cypress Hill
clone. And no wonder, since the members
of Funkdoobiest's Tomahawk Funk were
high school chums with Cypress Hill's Sen
Dog.

But where "Which Doobie U B" faltered. "The
Troubleshooters" comes on strong. The band is socially
aware, and in"The Troubleshooters" it uses its music
to deliver a message, as on the tunc "Five Deadly
Indians."
The lyrics of "The Troubleshooters" recall the genius
of the old school and its modern legacy. The Sugar Hill
Gang, Run DMC, Ice-T, Ice Cube and Public Enemy
wrote the same type of intelligent fast-delivery raps
about important social issues. This isn't mindless
Snoop Dogg or idiotic Warren G.
Funkdoobiest could take that route if it wanted to.
The group paid its dues, growing up in South and East
Los Angeles. But the band knows that it has a gift, and
it is making the most of it.
The crew loses points for its self-indulgent produc
tion, most evident on radio-friendly pop tracks like
"The Anthem." "It's Funkdoobiest / and players of
life / it's Funkdoobiest / it's Funkdoobiest," the chorus
drones repetitively. We know, that's why we bought the

album.
But the rhymes are good and the beats are strong,
especially on the songs where explicit lyrics take the
track out of mainstream radio play.
And most impressive, the lyrics are intelligent, the
above example being a rare exception. For example, on
the song "Crazy Puerto Rican," Funkdoobiest brings in
references from American folk hero Fete Seeger to
ancient Greek mythology.
The music of "The Troubleshooters" also reveals how
Funkdoobiest has matured since "Which Doobie U B"
was put out. Bassy grooves like "Sunshine" and "Act On
It" permeate the album, sometimes with Ice-T / Cypress
samples, but often just standing on their own.
Brief one-minute interludes punctuate the album,
ranging from the ridiculous ("Doobie Show") to the
exceptional ("Tribal Flutes"). Some of them, like "First
Million"and "Tribal Flutes," deserve to be full-length
tracks.
The album closes with an all Spanish-language ver
sion of "Papi Chulo," the first radio single. It's a smart
nod to the Latin influenced on the album, and it
promises that Funkdoobiest will continue to grow
stronger.
