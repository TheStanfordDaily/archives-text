# CHEEKY MONKEY
## 
### 
The name "Cheeky Monkey" strongly suggests that this
band holds a down-to-earth approach to its music. A bud
ding playfulness complements clever lyrics and a humble
tone on its self-titled debut, while social commentaries
sneak their way in through the cracks.

On its self-titled debut, the group keeps the instrumen
tal stripped down and the melodies catchy. In a mislead
ingly simple Beatlesesque way. One listen and you can tell
that these guys are out to make serious music while having
loads of fun.
The album sports a host of unique tunes, that seem to

draw from varied styles. Shades of Dick Dale's wild guitaring
surfer tunes peek through on "Chasin' Each Other Around
the Room," while hints of the legendary guitar chords of Led
Zeppelin's Jimmy Page show up in "Let it Flow."
Cheeky Monkey tries its hand at anything from sex-dri-

ven fantasies to lonely ballads and just downright silly
songs. But then again, what do you expect when you put a
Brooklynite and a Scotsman together? Maybe not this, but
that's what you get.
Still perhaps the most signature aspect of Cheeky
Monkey is the randomly styled lyrics, which are not quite

strange enough to puzzle, and not typical enough for one
to keep a straight face. Some of the lyrics even make a
statement, like on "Big Dumb Boy":
"Spends his days buying and selling stocks / But he'd
rather be playing with blocks / 'Cause he's just another big

dumb boy." And on "Monkey Man," the Monkey touts, "And
if you'll be my missing link / I'll be your monkey man."
1 don't know if I'd want Cheeky Monkey as my monkey
man, but the band is definitely worth a try, and they might
just have you longing for bananas.
