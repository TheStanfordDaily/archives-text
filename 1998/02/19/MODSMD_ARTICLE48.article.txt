## the 						next sci-fi classic? "Sphere" is a must-see 
### 
When he receives $35,000 to write a
protocol recommendation for extraterres
trial contact, psychologist Norman
Goodman (Dustin Hoffman) doesn't take
it seriously. Using Isaac Asimov novels as
his primary research tool, Goodman cer
tainly doesn't anticipate that the U.S.
Office of Space and Science Applications
(OSSA) will be using it as a Bible for its
biggest mission of the century.
Summoned to the middle of the
Pacific Ocean, Goodman is joined by
three esteemed acquaintances. Two of
them, mathematician Harry Adams
(Samuel L. Jackson) and astrophysicist
Ted Fielding (Liev Schrieber), are
renowned in their fields, each with a doc
torate received prior to his 20th birthday.
Biochemist Beth Halperin (Sharon Stone)
is an ex-lover of Goodman's with a pre
carious mental state. Together, the group
delves hundreds of yards below the
water's surface in search of what OSSA
believes is a 300-year-old spacecraft. They
soon learn that it is not from the past.
Inside the spacecraft, the group dis
covers a giant brightly colored sphere sus
pended in midair. Soon their lives are
placed on the line, and the sphere's power
is violently unleashed. This violence is
manifested in the form of their deepest
fears.
Directed by Barry Levinson,
"Sphere" is a gripping, fast-paced blend of

suspense, drama and science fiction.
Unlike other recent movies whose plots
have been grounded in Michael
Crichton's tomes ("Jurassic Park," "The
Lost World," "Congo"), "Sphere" adheres
almost completely to the story line and
even makes a few improvements on it.
The small cast lends itself well to in
depth character development. Hoffman's
performance is especially noteworthy —
easily his strongest since "Rainman." His
down-to-earth style and impeccable sense
of timing are showcased flawlessly in his
role as Goodman. The role also demon
strates Hoffman's breadth as an actor.
Hoffman's character in "Sphere" is a stark
contrast to the last role he played — that
of Stanley Motss, the eccentric producer
in the recently-released "Wag the Dog."
Though the special effects are not
groundbreaking, they are definitely above
average. Whether depicting a swarm of ill
intentioned jellyfish or an underwater
detonation, the special effects are well
planned and realistic, not oversensation
alized in the Terminator-esque manner
that tends to detract from the plot.
Overall, "Sphere" is a solid must-see
with a sole weakness — a semi-cheesy
finale in the last five minutes of the
movie. Buy your popcorn ahead of time
— once it starts, you won't leave your seat.
