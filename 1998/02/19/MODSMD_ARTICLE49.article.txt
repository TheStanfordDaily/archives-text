# not-so-easy streets
## "Hurricane Streets" shows us some tough teens 
### 
Set in the Lower East Side of New
York City, "Hurricane Streets" is a stark and
unsettling portrayal of America's youth.
The ideas behind the film may not be the
most original to date — "Kids" and "Boyz
'N' the Hood" are just two examples of
urban shock dramas.
However, the fresh acting from up
and-coming star Brendan Sexton 111
("Welcome to the Dollhouse") and the dri
ving soundtrack help give this film a mild
recommendation.
Sexton 111 stars as Marcus, a kid living
on his own after his mom is sent to prison
and his dad is killed.
He harbors ideals reminiscent of sub
urban middle-class children. He has strong
loyalties to his family and friends, a desire
to earn and save money and aspirations to
better his life.
However, Marcus' attempts to escape
are not as easy as completing a college
application or going to the local cin
emaplex. The way he acquires "crisp let
tuce" is through shoplifting goods and
reselling them to schoolchildren. His
friends work together to further this lucra
tive business, and the gang even hangs out
at an underground clubhouse after looting
the latest street vendor.
Marcus faces a difficult decision after
he has saved enough money to go to New

Mexico, his dream home. His mother (Edie
Falco) has not been completely honest
about the length of her prison sentence, so
Marcus' plan to leave New York with his
mom has hit a major bump in the road.
In addition to this dilemma, Marcus
meets Melena (Isidra Vega), a girl with a
very overprotective and possibly abusive
father.
The film resonates with so much
verisimilitude that I found myself pulling
for Marcus and Melena to escape the
drudgery that they continually face.
I have never been to New York City,
but director Morgan J. Freeman (no rela
tion to the veteran actor) has transplanted a
colorful and interesting lifestyle onto the
big screen with great success.
In fact, the Sundance Film Festival
rewarded his effort in "Hurricane Streets"
with three awards, including the Audience
Award for Dramas.
While "Hurricane Streets" is not a
tour-de-force analyzation of urban youth
and broken families, it does manage to
transport one's attention away from the
protected campus environment and
towards a devastatingly vivacious account
of one person's attempts to escape the
streets of New York City.
