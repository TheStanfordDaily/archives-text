Lawyers for Psychiatry Prof. Adolf Pfef
ferbaum and the University had their final
chance yesterday to argue their case to an in
dependent hearings officer retained by the
University Advisory Board to help it deter
mine whether Stanford has grounds to dis
miss Pfefferbaum.

an action that the University considered to
constitute retirement from his Stanford pro
fessorship .is well. Pfefferbaum and a Santa
Clara Counts judge disagreed, prompting
University President tierhard Casper to
begin formal dismissal proceedings against
Pfefferbaum. who would be onlv the second
tenured professor ever dismissed bv Stan
ford.
As part of the proceedings. Pfefferbaum
was allowed a public hearing before the
board It then assigned Pfefferbaum the bur
den of "producing some evidence support

ing his position on each of the questions" in
a letter sent to lawyers lor both sides last
July.
However, the board noted. "It he meets
that burden, the president shall then have
the burden ol eonvincing the hearing officer
bv highlv persuasive evidence that the facts
are as a the president contends them to be.
In a preview of his closing statements,
Gould told Marcus Fridav that Pfefferbaum
had not proven discrimination. The Adviso
ry Board, he argued, requires more than "a
scintilla" of evidence. He declined to pro
vide further information to The Daily.
McOoskev offered Marcus a detailed ex
amination ol d*Kumentation and testimony
to support his side. In his brief, he argued
that no other Stanford faculty working part
time at the VA hospital faced similar cuts in
research stall or space despite a tightening
budget at the hospital.
Furthermore. McCloskev said, there is no
persuasive evidence that the VA hospital's
refusal to allow IMefferbaum to continue his
work there on "without compensation" sta
tus after his retirement reflected normal pro
cedures
McCloskev argued that the hospital also
was at fault in delaying for six months Pfef
ferbaum's request to do outside consulting
services, a delay that his lawyer said cost Pf-
efferbaum $1(),(XX).
Further testimony focused on
whether a letter of counseling and a
proficiency report directed at Pfef
ferbaum were disseminated beyond
normal channels.
McCloskey said Psychiatry Prof.
Ira Glick, acting deputy chief of
staff for psychiatry at the VA hospi

tal and Pfefferbaum's successor in
the position, improperly received
the proficiency report. The letter of
counseling, according to Mc-
Closkey, was part of a personnel
record and was improperly circulat
ed by then-VA Hospital Chief of
Staff Richard Mazze, against whom
Pfefferbaum and Psychiatry Prof.
Brant Wenegrat had filed a griev
ance in 19%.
Marcus is expected to submit his
rulings within a month.
