## Women are just like animals An interview with editor Deena Metzger 
### Nkomo Morris Editorial staff 
I don't know what I expected. I just knew that
I'd be interviewing Deena Metzger, one of the editors
of "Intimate Nature: The Bond Between Women and
Animals" (Fawcett Columbine, $27.00) and that we
would be talking about her book. Perhaps I would
learn a little about what it's like to edit a book filled
with big literary names like Joy Harjo, Leslie Silko,
Barbara Kingsolver and Alice Walker.
1 found myself talking to an older woman clad
in black and silver with a kind smile, a strong voice
that could have been from New York (every time you
read the word "all," substitute "awl") and an inner
warmth that managed to flood her face despite the
fact that her green glasses were twice the size of her
head. She had a soothing voice and bright eyes. Each
time she made a new point, she patted the air in front
of her almost lovingly.
Intermission: What made you think you could
compare women to animals?
Deena Metzger: Brenda Perterson, Linda Hogan
and myself have been connected with animals for
most of our lives. One of the things we came to
understand — because of our real personal experi
ences and because of the work we do — is that ani
mals have extraordinary and diverse intelligences.
Native peoples from all over the world including
Africa and the Americas have known this and have
understood the relationship between our lives and
those of animals.
Native Americans in particular have carried
that knowledge into this century. Western culture has
denied this and has been afraid of the animal world.
As we began to talk about this, we decided to bring
together a book about women's relationships with
animals. We had no idea what would happen. We dis
covered that this book represented many different
women's points of view and many different animals'
relationships and experiences.
I: How do you feel about how scientists study animals?
DM: Male-dominated conventional science has been
studying animals as objects. Take elephants, for
instance. Male scientists tend to study things like the
"rogue elephant" [an uncommon sort of elephant that
attacks animals) who is independent and isolated.
They study a lot about competition and aggression.
Women scientists have studied how elephants
are raised in the dynamic of herds. They have also
studied processes such as ongoing nurturing and the
passing on of knowledge.
I: What do you mean "passing on of knowledge?" Can
you give me an example of how a male scientist and a
female scientist would look at animals differently?
DM: When an elephant is born, the matriarch takes
the newborn and leads her or him through the land
showing the newborn where the territory ends, where
the water holes are and what the migration pattern is.
The matriarch is the one who keeps the herd togeth
er, protects the herd and passes on knowledge. If you
study only males, as male scientists tend to do, you're
never going to discover this.
I: How do we know that the matriarch actually has
that kind of influence over young elephants and the
herd in general?
DM: When you do an elephant killing, you go in with

helicopters and shoot the matriarchs first. Sometimes
you just take the young elephants and move them
somewhere else. But the effect is the same: you destroy
their sociability. Then we put those young bull ele
phants in places where there aren't enough elephants.
Some say that it doesn't matter, since being alone is in
the elephant's nature. But they aren't just by them
selves, they're by themselves before they hav? been
socialized. So they go crazy. That's how we get "rogue
elephants." Look at society and you'U see that the ani
mals are suffering the same jeopardy that we are suf
fering and for the same reasons.

Animals, just like humans, are uniaue and distinct.
They have diverse intelligences ana some of them
have spiritual powers. They have the will and ability
to say can we create an alliance, can we save the plan
et together, can we take care of each other?"
I: Why should we read this book?
DM: Let me tell you a story: I went with Brenda
Peterson to the Seattle Zoo where there's an aquarium
with three Beluga whales. She went to visit a friend of
hers — one of the whales — who had just had a whale
pup who had died. What happens with whales is that
if the baby dies, the mother keeps the baby on her
body in the ocean until it disintegrates. That is her
mourning period. She's really with the fact that this
baby has died, and she doesn't deny this. As the baby
disintegrates, the mother comes across [learns to
accept the fact that her child has died].
What the zookeepers did, for health or research
reasons, was to take away her dead baby and gave her
a rubber ducky. They assumed that this very intelli
gent creature wouldn't know the difference. So she
was in a state of deep depression and wouldn't come
towards us. The other two whales were swinging
around me, and because I know that whales commu
nicate through sound, 1 began humming. 1 put my
lips against the glass and hummed. Brenda began
humming with me.
After a while the whales started turning in
smaller and smaller circles and it was as if the sound
was a hand that was going out and touching them.
This went on for about 20 minutes. And then sudden
ly, 1 felt something in my body. I didn't know what it
was. So 1 looked over at Brenda because she has been
with sick patients for her entire life.
"They're echo-locating," she said to me. "They
use sonar. They have scanned you and they now know
your physical state of health, your emotional state of
health and your spiritual state of health. They know
everything about you." I was delighted to be known.
But then I felt something else, something I'd never
felt before and couldn't imagine. Brenda looked at me
and said, "They're imprinting themselves on you." I
asked her what that meant. She said, "We don't know,
but we'll find out."
I: Did you ever find out what "imprinting" was?
DM: Two weeks later, 1 read about some experi
ments, which involved broadcasting a signal of 185
decibels from the Monterey Marine Sanctuary (which
is an atrocity), across to Hawaii every 20 minutes for
10 years. This was to test global warming.
After 10 years, by measuring the speed of the
signal, scientists would know whether the oceans
were warming. These signals were extremely danger
ous to whales and other deep-diving animals, partic
ularly those who use sound to communicate. The sig
nals disrupted sound patterns, which means for those
creatures an inability to mate, to find food or do
other basic things for life.
I became very involved with studying and being
an activist. Then 1 realized one day, that when I'd first
heard about all of this, I'd felt a deep pain. It occurred
to me that the whales had imprinted themselves, and
I was feeling their jeopardy.
This book comes out as the Navy begins testing
a low-frequency active sonar program. They are going
to beam very high signals five miles off the coast of
Hawaii. That's about 1,000 times more than what
you'd hear if you stood next to a jet engine. They're
doing it this month and next month, deliberately
through the calving season of the humpback whale.
They're using the whales as targets. If they can find
whales, they can find submarines. That's a horrible
relationship. That's an unhappy symbiosis.
I am hoping this book will push people to
speak out against such injustices against animals.
They have intelligences that we didn't understand,
but that is what makes them even more valuable.

that knowledge into this century. Western culture has
denied this and has been afraid of the animal world.
As we began to talk about this, we decided to bring
together a book about women's relationships with
animals. We had no idea what would happen. We dis
covered that this book represented many different
women's points of view and many different animals'
relationships and experiences.
I: How do you feel about how scientists study animals?
DM: Male-dominated conventional science has been
studying animals as objects. Take elephants, for
instance. Male scientists tend to study things like the
"rogue elephant" [an uncommon sort of elephant that
attacks animals) who is independent and isolated.
They study a lot about competition and aggression.
Women scientists have studied how elephants
are raised in the dynamic of herds. They have also
studied processes such as ongoing nurturing and the
passing on of knowledge.
I: What do you mean "passing on of knowledge?" Can
you give me an example of how a male scientist and a
female scientist would look at animals differently?
DM: When an elephant is born, the matriarch takes
the newborn and leads her or him through the land
showing the newborn where the territory ends, where
the water holes are and what the migration pattern is.
The matriarch is the one who keeps the herd togeth
er, protects the herd and passes on knowledge. If you
study only males, as male scientists tend to do, you're
never going to discover this.
I: How do we know that the matriarch actually has
that kind of influence over young elephants and the
herd in general?
DM: When you do an elephant killing, you go in with

helicopters and shoot the matriarchs first. Sometimes
you just take the young elephants and move them
somewhere else. But the effect is the same: you destroy
their sociability. Then we put those young bull ele
phants in places where there aren't enough elephants.
Some say that it doesn't matter, since being alone is in
the elephant's nature. But they aren't just by them
selves, they're by themselves before they hav? been
socialized. So they go crazy. That's how we get "rogue
elephants." Look at society and you'U see that the ani
mals are suffering the same jeopardy that we are suf
fering and for the same reasons.

Animals, just like humans, are uniaue and distinct.
They have diverse intelligences ana some of them
have spiritual powers. They have the will and ability
to say can we create an alliance, can we save the plan
et together, can we take care of each other?"
I: Why should we read this book?
DM: Let me tell you a story: I went with Brenda
Peterson to the Seattle Zoo where there's an aquarium
with three Beluga whales. She went to visit a friend of
hers — one of the whales — who had just had a whale
pup who had died. What happens with whales is that
if the baby dies, the mother keeps the baby on her
body in the ocean until it disintegrates. That is her
mourning period. She's really with the fact that this
baby has died, and she doesn't deny this. As the baby
disintegrates, the mother comes across [learns to
accept the fact that her child has died].
What the zookeepers did, for health or research
reasons, was to take away her dead baby and gave her
a rubber ducky. They assumed that this very intelli
gent creature wouldn't know the difference. So she
was in a state of deep depression and wouldn't come
towards us. The other two whales were swinging
around me, and because I know that whales commu
nicate through sound, 1 began humming. 1 put my
lips against the glass and hummed. Brenda began
humming with me.
After a while the whales started turning in
smaller and smaller circles and it was as if the sound
was a hand that was going out and touching them.
This went on for about 20 minutes. And then sudden
ly, 1 felt something in my body. I didn't know what it
was. So 1 looked over at Brenda because she has been
with sick patients for her entire life.
"They're echo-locating," she said to me. "They
use sonar. They have scanned you and they now know
your physical state of health, your emotional state of
health and your spiritual state of health. They know
everything about you." I was delighted to be known.
But then I felt something else, something I'd never
felt before and couldn't imagine. Brenda looked at me
and said, "They're imprinting themselves on you." I
asked her what that meant. She said, "We don't know,
but we'll find out."
I: Did you ever find out what "imprinting" was?
DM: Two weeks later, 1 read about some experi
ments, which involved broadcasting a signal of 185
decibels from the Monterey Marine Sanctuary (which
is an atrocity), across to Hawaii every 20 minutes for
10 years. This was to test global warming.
After 10 years, by measuring the speed of the
signal, scientists would know whether the oceans
were warming. These signals were extremely danger
ous to whales and other deep-diving animals, partic
ularly those who use sound to communicate. The sig
nals disrupted sound patterns, which means for those
creatures an inability to mate, to find food or do
other basic things for life.
I became very involved with studying and being
an activist. Then 1 realized one day, that when I'd first
heard about all of this, I'd felt a deep pain. It occurred
to me that the whales had imprinted themselves, and
I was feeling their jeopardy.
This book comes out as the Navy begins testing
a low-frequency active sonar program. They are going
to beam very high signals five miles off the coast of
Hawaii. That's about 1,000 times more than what
you'd hear if you stood next to a jet engine. They're
doing it this month and next month, deliberately
through the calving season of the humpback whale.
They're using the whales as targets. If they can find
whales, they can find submarines. That's a horrible
relationship. That's an unhappy symbiosis.
I am hoping this book will push people to
speak out against such injustices against animals.
They have intelligences that we didn't understand,
but that is what makes them even more valuable.
