So, you want to get a piercing. But not your run-of-the-mill, do
it-with-a-gun-in-a-cheap-jewelry-store-at the-mall kind. You want to
digress from the mundane. You want discretion but raciness. You
want an intriguing secret, unknown save by a privileged few, tucked
away with a lascivious grin. A personal piercing.
In terms of pain — of course it will hurt. Someone's going to
pierce your flesh. However, everyone's pain threshold is different, so
your pain and mine won't be the same (besides, one person's piin is
another's pleasure ...) V 112 ; .<
First: health. It may be dul, but read on anyway. You cin't get a
piercing and then expect to continue life as usual, or immediately take
advantage of new benefits. It's a long-term commitment A piercing is
like a really intimate pet, so take loving care of it.
Carefully clean it daily with antibacterial soap (liquid Dial is
good); avoid contact with germs and bacteria; no hot tubs Or swiiji
ming in chlorinated water, because they teem with germs and harsh
chlorine that will only irritate your piercing.
Above all, in terms of sexual contact, be constantly aware that you
have an open wound: an invitation for everything infectious (i.e„
HIV). So, be especially protective! w
Where to go? From sheer preference and the delicate nature of *
intimate piercings, stay away from anyone advertising from the back
of some dank tattoo parlor. The idea is for your experience to be as
comfortable as possible. If the place seems dirty or sketchy, leave.
In terms of your genitalia and sharp needles, cleanliness is huge.;:'*,.;
Wouldn't you agree?
Two excellent local piercers are The Gauntlet and Body
Manipulations. Both are clean and very qualified. I endorse the lattef
because they are chill and unpretentious. If you're going to be climb
ing into the stirrups for anyone, you should be able to have a com- j
fortable rapport. They'll be getting pretty up close and personal.
Now the explicit stuff. But let's start mild: the nipple pierce.
Some opt for the nipple for aesthetic reasons, while others do if
for sensitivity. But nipples are tough healers. They can take six
months for just initial healing, and often when you get stressed, your
piercing responds by getting inflamed, tender and weepy (sob, sob).
Fear not! This too will pass. Just be extra careful: clean with your
soap, don't get knocked or bumped, and try to curb stress.
Mainly, be gentle with your nips.
Ladies first. The most pressing question: is there really a piercing
that makes walking down the street take on whole new meaning? Yes,
there is. But it's not an actual clitoris piercing. Clitoris piercings are
very rare, intensely painful and have potential for nerve damage and
loss of sensitivity (how tragic!). This piercing actually involves the

hood of the clitoris, the clitoris' protective covering. The jewelry, either
ring or barbell, rests on or around the clitoris, but goes through the hood.
112 Thefe are two kinds of hood piercings — horizontal and vertical. The
horizontal goes through the top of the hood, resting flat, whereas the verti
cal goes through the hood from the underside, bringing the jewelry into
direct contact with the clitoris. The latter is the one causing intensified
sensation.
No more just sitting through painfully dull lectures!
Labia piercings are also an option and are essentially decorative. There
can be any number of them, in whatever size or shape of jewelry.
/ Men have more options, but most aren't too common anymore. Many
male genital piercings originated in rituals from Indonesia, North Africa
and Polynesia. They're difficult to describe without visual aides, so use
your imagination.
An ampallang is a piercing through the head of the penis, perpendicu
lar to the shaft. This one's done primarily to enhance the sexual pleasure of
the woman during sex (now that is sacrifice!). The apadravya, close cousin
to the ampallang, pierces the head vertically. A dydoe pierces the corona
(the lip-edge of the head), and is often done in matching pairs, one on
each side. The frenum runs along the underside of the penis, from the very
sensitive spot under the head all the way down to the base. Pierced hori
zontally, it can sustain quite a few piercings. The rare guiche (pronounced
"geesh") pierces the skin at the back of the scrotum, which is stimulated
when the jewelry gently bounces when walking or ... whatever.
The Prince Albert, considered to be the most sensual of male pierc
ings, i« really difficult to describe. Legend has it that the piercing was intro
duced by fashion revolutionary Beau Brummell to secure the penis against
the leg. This reduces any "unsightly" bulge in tight pants. Yeah, I can see
that trend coming back into practice.
To get pierced, you'll have to disrobe, and someone's got to get down
there and poke around (pun very much intended). It's not too different
from going to the gynecologist.
I'm not a man and don't have a penis, so I really can't tell you guys
much. 1 can tell you that it's interesting to see someone with a long needle
face-to-poontang.
My advice: relax, take some deep breaths and know that in a few
strangely electrifying moments, it will be all over.
