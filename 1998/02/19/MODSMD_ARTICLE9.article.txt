## Clinton adviser faces grand jury 
### 
WASHINGTON (AT)
Long-time Clinton confidant Bruce
Lindsey testified before a grand
jury in the Monica Lewinsky inves
tigation yesterday amid indications
the adviser may have urged a key
potential witness last summer to
contact President Clinton's private
lawyer.
Lindsey, who has been with
Clinton since the early days of ( 'lin
ton's political career in Arkansas,
spoke at least twice last summer
with former White House staffer
Linda Tripp, according to individu
als familiar with Tripp's account of
the matter. It was Tripp who
brought the allegations of a presi
dential affair and cover-up to light
after secretly taping her conversa
tions with Lewinsky.
In one conversation, these indi
viduals said. Lindsey tried to per
suade 'Tripp to go see Robert Ben
nett, the lawyer Clinton hired to
represent him in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case. These indi
viduals, discussing the case only on
grounds of anonymity, said Tripp's
lawyer advised her not to do so and
she didn't.
The information surfaced as
Lindsey appeared before the feder
al grand jury lor questioning. The
White House adviser's testimony
was interrupted for about 45 min
utes as he and his attorney. Deputy
White House counsel Cheryl Mills,
appeared before U.S. District
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson.
The nature of the conference was
not immediately known.
One White House official said

earlier that Lindsey had not
refused, through midday Tuesday,
to answer any questions on account
of jeopardizing executive privilege.
It could not he immediately
learned whether his appearance
before the judge presiding over the
grand jury investigation involved
that issue.
"I'm not going to talk about my
testimony," Lindsey told reporters
as he left the courthouse after a
more than 5-hour visit. He indicat
ed he would return today.
In the conversations the individ
uals said Lindsey had with Tripp,
Clinton's adviser was speaking
about an episode in which a woman
named Kathleen Willey confided to
Tripp that Clinton kissed and fon
dled her in the Oval Office. This
happened well before Tripp turned
over the audio tapes that prompted
the Lewinsky investigation.
Tripp contacted Lindsey after
learning that Newsweek magazine
was planning a story about the
alleged encounter between Willey
and C linton, the individuals said.
Tripp has said she saw Willey
emerge from the Oval Office, her
lipstick smeared and clothing
askew. Tripp has said Willey was
"happy and joyful" about the
encounter with Clinton.
During the first conversation
with Tripp. Lindsey questioned
whether there was possibly an
alternative explanation in which
the encounter could be interpreted
innocently, said the individuals.
Tripp said she was certain of what
she had seen and heard.
