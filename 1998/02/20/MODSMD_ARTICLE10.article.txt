# Men charged for having anthrax
## 
### 
LAS VEGAS (AP) â€” Two
men were charged yesterday with
possessing the deadly germ
anthrax for use as a weapon. The
FBI said one bragged in Las Vegas
he had enough to "wipe out the
city" and last year laid out a plan to
unleash bubonic plague on New
York City subways.
The men were Arrested in sub
urban Henderson late Wednesday
as they were allegedly trying to
arrange a lab test of the substance.
Their beige Mercedes, sealed in
plastic, was hauled off to a military
base for tests to confirm whether
the material carried inside was the
germ warfare agent.
An informant said one of the
men told him he had "military
grade anthrax" in flight bags in the
trunk of the Mercedes, according
to an FBI affidavit. The informant
said he saw eight to 10 bags
marked "biological" in the trunk.
Larry Wayne Harris, 46, of Lan
caster. Ohio, and William Leavitt,
47, of Las Vegas and Logandale,
Nev., appeared before a federal
magistrate yesterday afternoon,
handcuffed to each other and
shackled at the ankles.
They were charged under a fed
eral law that prohibits the produc
tion and possession of any biologi
cal agent for use as a weapon.
Harris told the magistrate he
could not afford an attorney.
Leavitt told the court he did not
understand the charges against
him.
A detention hearing for the pair
was continued until Monday while
the government ran tests to deter
mine whether the anthrax was mil
itary grade or simply an anthrax
vaccine.
The FBI said the pair were try
ing to arrange to buy the infor
mant's testing equipment for $2
million up front and another $1X

million later.
Bobby Siller, special agent in
charge of the Las Vegas FBI office,
told a news conference before the
affidavit was released there was no
indication the men had any target.
Siller repeatedly reassured resi
dents of the Las Vegas area that
there was no contamination and no
danger.
Anthrax is an infectious disease
that usually afflicts only animals,
especially cattle and sheep. But
anthrax spores can be produced in
a dry form suitable for weapons
and can be fatal to humans even in
microscopic amounts.
Anthrax can also be used in
germ warfare; many of the tnxips
who fought in the Persian Gull War
were inoculated for the bacteria.
Harris, identified by the FBI as
a member of the Aryan Nations,
was previously given probation
after pleading guilty to illegally
obtaining bubonic plague bacteria
through the mail in 1995. He is also
author of a self-published book
called "Bacteriological Warfare: A
Major Threat to North America."
Leavitt. who has no criminal
record, owns a microbiology lab in
rural Logandale, about 60 miles
north of L.as Vegas, and another in
Frankfurt. Germany, according to
the affidavit prepared by FBI Spe
cial Agent John H. Hawken.
In background information in
the affidavit, the FBI said that last
summer Harris described plans for
the New York attack.
"Harris told a group of plans to
place a 'globe' of bubonic plague
toxins in a New York subway sta
tion. where it would be broken by
a passing subway train, causing
hundreds of thousands of deaths.
Harris stated that the Iraqis would
be blamed for that event."
The affidavit added: "Harris had
stated that the New York subwav

attack would ruin the economy and
take the military by surprise."
The affidavit said a confidential
informant called the FBI Wednes
day to say he was a research scien
tist and had been contacted by Har
ris and Leavitt. who asked him to
use some of his equipment to test
vials of the bacterium Bacillus
anthracis. which causes anthrax.
Over the next 12 hours, the
informant kept in touch with the
FBI and at least one phone call
was tapped. The document out
lined a meeting of Harris and
Leavitt with another man at the
Gold Coast Hotel.
The man. who was neither iden
tified nor charged, was later

tracked down by the FBI and relat
ed their conversation.
"Harris had shown him what
appeared to be a vial, which was
wrapped in cardboard and stated
that it contained anthrax." the affi
davit said. "Harris held the vial in
his hand and further stated that
there was enough there to 'wipe
out the city.* "
In Washington. DC.. Attorney
General Janet Reno briefed Presi
dent Clinton by telephone on what
the government knows about the
case and what was being done.
Last year. Harris pleaded guilty
to a count of fraud after illegally
obtaining bubonic plague bacteria
through the mail from a laboratory.
