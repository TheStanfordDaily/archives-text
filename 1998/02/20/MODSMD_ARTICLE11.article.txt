North Korea wants peace
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — In a remarkable
peace overture. North Korea appealed directly to
South Korean politicians yesterday, asking them to
work toward reconciliation on the divided Korean
peninsula.
The appeal was made in 70 letters to South Korean
leaders — including the president-elect — delivered
through the border village of Panmunjom.
The action was a marked policy shift for isolated
North Korea, which declared Wednesday it was ready
to talk with South Korea's newly elected government
in the interest of ending decades of confrontation.
North Korean policymaker. Kim Yong Sun. said
the letters "make clear that we are willing to have dia
logue and negotiation with anyone in South Korea."

"Ask, tell"
WASHINGTON (AP) — Four years after the
Clinton administration introduced its "don't ask. don't
tell" policy for homosexuals in the military, harass
ment of gays is again on the rise in the armed services,
says a group that advocates gay rights.
In its annual report, the group said service mem
bers reported 563 "command violations" to the poli
cy last year, including instances where service mem
bers said they were asked about their sexual orienta
tion or harassed in direct violation of the administra
tion's policy, which sets limits on such investigations.
The number was up from 443 reported in 19%.
"Commanders asked, commanders pursued, com
manders harrassed," said C. Dixon Osburn of the Ser
vicemembers Legal Defense Network.

Bacteria faces new foe
GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) — Doctors may
six)n have a long-needed new weapon against the grim
ing threat of drug-resistant germs: Government ad\ isers
recommended approval yesterday of Svnercid. the first
alternative in 30 years to the antibiotic of last resort.
The recommendation comes at a critical time, just
months after doctors discovered that strains of the
highly common staph germ are developing resistance
to that "silver bullet" antibiotic, vancomycin.
The French-developed Synereid is a new type of
antibiotic that appears to work by dealing bacteria a
one-two punch.
In clinical trials. Svnerced had a significant effect,
noted Dr. George Talbot of Manufacturer Rhone-
Pouleric Rover.

Seconds, anyone?
BOSTON (AP) — Scientists believe they have
found the brain's hunger hormone, the stuff that trig
gers the urge to say, "Another helping of mashed pota
toes. please. And lots of gravy!"
The discovery is likely to start a stampede of
research intended to find medicines that can rein in
this substance and help people say no to fixxl.
The researchers were led by Dr. Masashi Yanagi
sawa of Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the I "ni
versity of I exas Southwestern Medical Center. Their
findings are in today's issue of the journal Cell.
The scientists called their discovery "orexin," a play
on "orexis." the Greek word for hunger. "We believe
that orexin is one of the important pathways in the reg
ulation of hunger." said Yanagisawa.
