WASHINGTON (AP) — On
the eve of a high-stakes U.N. diplo
matic mission to Baghdad. Presi
dent Clinton ordered his national
security team to postpone overseas
travel yesterday while he considers
a possible military strike.
Clinton said he had made no
decision on setting a deadline for
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
bow to United Nations demands for
access to suspected weapons sites.
"I feel that time is on our side." he
told reporters.
The U.S. military buildup in the
Persian Gulf continued apace. The
lead contingent of a 3,(XX)-strong
Army unit from Fort Stewart. Ga..
arrived in Kuwait to take up defen
sive positions and demonstrate I J.S.
resolve.
Clinton said Vice President Al
Gore would put off his trip to South
Africa, and Pentagon officials said
Defense Secretary William Cohen
would delay a planned journey to
South Africa and South America
that was to have begun next Tues
day.
"In coming days I want my full
national security team on hand to
take part in our deliberations and
decisions on this vitally important
issue." Clinton said.
With U.N. Secretarv-Gencral

Kofi Annan headed to Baghdad for
talks with Saddam. Clinton said he
had spoken with French President
Jacques Chirac and thev agreed that
Annan's mission was a "critical
opportunity to achieve the outcome
that all of us would prefer a
peaceful and principled end to this
crisis."
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan declared yesterday he was
"reasonably optimistic" about his
chances of ending the weapons
inspection standoff without force.
His aims for weekend talks with
Saddam Hussein were straightfor
ward: "to explain the situation very
clearly — and get him to under
stand that it is in his best interest
and in the interest of the Iraqi peo
ple to agree to implement Security
Council resolutions."
The United States wished him
success, but made clear it reserved
the right to reject any deal he makes
— and to attack to force Saddam to
open all suspected weapons sites to
U.N. inspectors
"We hope the secretary gener
als mission will succeed, but let me
be clear: If diplomacy fails, we must
be and we are prepared to act." the
president said
After speaking by telephone
with Chirac. Clinton said the U.N.

Security Council was unanimous in
believing Iraq must give I N
weapons inspectors "full, tree and
unfettered access to all suspected
sites anywhere in Iraq."
"The choice is Saddam Hus
sein's." the president said.
A day after his top national secu
rity aides encountered outbursts of
anger at a public meeting on the
Iraqi crisis in Columbus. Ohio. Clin
ton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright kept on the
public offensive.
"1 believe strongly that most
Americans support our policy, that
they support our resolve," Clinton
said, speaking with reporters at the
White House.
Clinton satd Saddam should not
be emboldened by the 'elevised
images of dissent at a town meeting
Wednesday in Ohio. "Not if he
understands the first thing about
America,"the president said.
Albright traveled to Tennessee
State University in Nashville yes
terday. where she told a more sub
dued college audience the United
States would strive to limit civilian
casualties if it decides to bomb
Iraq.
"There will be some, (but) we
have selected our targets very care
fullv," Albright said.

Albright denounced Saddam as
a tyrant who has used chemical
weapons against Iraqi Kurds as well
as Iranian soldiers "He's a repeat
offender," Albright said
But. she added, the task of con
taining the Iraqi leader will not last
forever.
"Ultimately, biology will work
and he will disappear." she said.
The Clinton administration
maintains that most countries sup
port its approach to the Iraq prob
lem. but in Washington yesterday
the Turkish ambassador s.ud his
country — a longtime NATO ally
that shares a border with Iraq
sees the American policy as Wx> nar
row and risky.
"To single out Saddam would be
an injustice for the overall security
and stability of the region," the
ambassador, Nuzhet kandemir,
told reporters.
The Turkish ambassador said his
country accepts Clinton's characteri
zation of Saddam as a threat to the
region. But. he said, the United
States should deal with Iraq as part
of h larger problem in the region.
"By character, he is a man who
wants to dominate." Kandemir said.
"There are many other dictators
around who are just thinking the
same way."
