free Viennese Ball

AS A PUBLIC service
announcement to students,
faculty, alumni, band mem
bers and staff who will be attending
the Viennese Ball tomorrow night, we
would like to offer a few helpful sug
gestions. Eleven hundred people will
be competing for dance-floor space at
the Hyatt Rickeys, so we gathered
some recommendations from veteran
dancers on how best to navigate this
year's Ball.
• HAVE FUN! Even if you don't
know how to Viennese waltz like the
opening committee or swing like the
dance instructors, enjoy the music and
do your best. No one else is looking at
you — except your date. So smile and
have a ball.
• One sure way to collide with another
couple is to ignore the crowd and focus
purely on your own four feet. If you
need to work on your steps, get off the
floor and find a safe place to practice.
There are usually spots in the hall for
people to practice, out of the way of
the surging throng.
• Another way to get tangled up is to
stop in the middle of the dance floor to
recapture your step. Don't be a rock in
the rapids.
If you need to stop, follow the
stream of people and move to the out
side of the dance floor. If you need to
recapture the count, keep dancing with
a simple step and work with your part
ner to regain vour footing. The other

dancers will appreciate it.
• Be practical about your shoes. Don't
wear spiked heels — they are powerful
weapons of mass destruction. Not only
will they likely maim your partner and
other hapless victims, but they will also
render you unable to dance or walk
after an hour. Check your shoes
beforehand. Make sure they don't
slide off when you stand on your tip
toes. And we suggest a set of flats for
after midnight. The coat check person
will be happy to hold them for you.
• Take SMALL steps! Keep in mind
that when doing the swing, and the
waltz, the faster the music is the small
er your steps should be. Know your
limitations — polkas can be fun, but
also the most dangerous of all dances.
Big steps are hard to control and will
likely cause you to crash into others.
• When the crowd is heavy, don't show
off — that's what the contests are for.
Keep your partner close but maintain
your frame, take small steps and stick
to the basics. Your partner will appre
ciate it.
The magic of the Viennese Ball is
becoming one with the spirit of the
music. Rather than being a leaf tossed
about in a wild current of people, be
one with the crowd and be respectful
of other dancers. Even the most expe
rienced dancers will collide with other
people — apologize and accept apolo
gies gracefully. No one means to hurt
you. Viennese Ball is what you make it
— a night full of memories or an
evening spent at Cowell Student
Health Center getting fitted for
crutches.
