THE conclusion of
the 18th Winter
Olympic Games is
upon us, and I cannot con
tain my lack of excite
ment. As Americans, we
simply do not have much
;it stake. These are not the
winter games we grew up

playing. Although skiing, hockey and even
ice skating play important roles in our
sports, culture, the Winter Olympics leave a
void. Where is the sledding, the snowball
fighftng" Wlfknow-bunny hot tub endurance
tests, the ski ball?
The frustrating thing is that there are
sports far less legitimate than some which
are already firmly in place in the Winter
Games. Here's one: two-man luge. Let me
repeat: two-man luge.
1 think we can all agree that the position
ing in this sport is a little silly. Why stop with
two men laying 011 top of each other hurling
down an ice tube at high speeds? Give me
three, four, five men at a time — I want
orgy luge.
Until it becomes "hip" to round up the
guys and head down to the luge track. 1 just
don't see how much American excitement
can be generated for this event. Despite
this, we dominated the doubles. Palo Alto's
own Brian Martin brought home the bronze
last week. Brian, sincere congratulations,
but doubles luge still seems silly to me.
The biathlon is another example of an
arcane Olympic event. Cross-country skiing
and shooting — what a natural combina
tion. How can we succeed in this if we can't
handle an NBA team called the Bullets?

Now. replace skiing with low-rider driving,
and the Americans might have a chance. I
mean, at least give us Nordic Track or
paintball wars or something.
Finally there's curling, the Olympic
event for Nordic janitors. You've seen this,
or maybe you are lucky and haven't. Teams
slide giant hockey pucks with handles
(called stones) into a shuffleboard-si/ed
area of ice. Simultaneously two men rapidly
sweep brooms in front of the stone to regu
late its speed as it enters the scoring area.
The commentators always spout off on how
legitimate the sport is. "Look at the dexter
ity it takes to move the brooms that fast."
"This sport is very popular in Canada."
Thanks, but I'll watch Plinko instead. Also,
Canada should never be grounds for justify
ing anything.
Where do we fit in? Figure skating usu
ally goes well for the Americans, but the
whole arbitrary nature of the sport bothers
me. 1 swear that one judge from France has
cost us five medals.
And as a man. I can only get so excited
about triple sow cow camel toe loops and
tight unitards. Where are the flips? Appar
ently Hips do not score any points. I blame
the judge from France for this.
A tip for men — do not watch this event
with women 110 matter how many nookie
points it may score you. They become
expert analysts and consequently become
about the most annoying beings on the
planet.
Why can't they keep their opinions to
themselves like when we let them watch
football with us? Let me have the pleasure
of discovering on my own that Elvis Stojko

is having a bad hair day or that Brian Boi
tano just slipped on one of his sequins.
I Jnless I ask, leave me in my lounge chair of
ignorance and let me keep holding out for
the flips.
A good, exciting event that I think
Americans relate to is ski-jumping. But
again, it has that arbitrary factor added in
on the landing. I think the bigger the wipe
out. the bigger the points. II the Olympics
are about sell sacrifice and perseverance,
then the triple-head-bounce-groin-pull
accidentallv-impale-three-spectators-with-
your-ski landing should beat out the tele
mark any day.
1 guess all we want is action and drama
or at least a sport we can practice in our
neighborhood. Send down two bobsleds at
a time, put more trees in the ski runs, any
thing. The bottom line: bring back Tonya
Harding.
Despite all of the nay-saying, this year's
games did have its highlights. We did not
have to watch Dan Jansen fall down again.
They added snowboarding, drugs and all.
And our women's hockey team was stellar,
although it is hard to get excited about
hockey sans checking.
Finally in skiing, Picabo Street cement
ed her heroine status by bringing home the
gold. I always enjoy cheering her on. Yeah
Picabo. II nothing else. I do it for her name
and that cool song by Siouxee and the Ban
shees. You can't get more American than
Siouxee and the Banshees.
