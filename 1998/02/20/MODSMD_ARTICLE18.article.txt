Sexual assault is not a
major campus issue
Tuesday's Daily coverage of the prob
lem of sexual assault leaves me perplexed.
On a campus where most students don't
date and hence scarcely have an active sex
ual life, how is it |>ossible that "sexual
assault ... is a salient issue for the entire
community?"
But what about the real hushed topic. "It
can happen to anyone, regardless of age.
class, race or gender." Can it also happen
regardless of physique? Don't we have eyes
to see who's "date-fitting" and who's not?
In other words, those who have the natural
right to choose his / her mate because of his
/her physical attractiveness and those who
remain the toy of whimsical Lady-Luck?
Since sexual assault is a risk germane pri
marily to this minority of privileged, sexual
ly active students, then it may be rather dis
turbing to receive a public baptism in the
deep waters of "awareness." and to be
trumpeted with warnings about the extent
of the "problem."
Why should the problem of sexual coer
cion confronting a minority of students be
"everyone's" problem and the majority's
problem of sexual inertia be "no one's?" I
wish there were as much sensitivity for the
silent majority as there is for vocal minori
ties. The implicit moral flagellation of the

former is not the answer to the hitter's
problems.
Laudable as it is to be charitable to the
victim of an unjust act, one should not feel
entitled to create unrealistic impressions
and psychologically burden the majority of
students.
Please continue to support individually
those who have had such a traumatic expe
rience; please continue to inform incoming
students about the thin line between what is
acceptable behavior and what is not. But,
for (iod's sake, don't be so cruel to those of
us who are deprived from even the possibil
ity of sexually assaulting anybody.
I respect the experiences of victims, but I
am not prepared to accept collective
responsibility for the acts and attitudes
committed and perpetrated by individuals.

557 won't go silently
I'm writing in response to T.J. Babbitt's
Feb. column. Yes. black armbands will
be distributed come March I.the day those
dying Row houses find out if they have
become one of the chosen few. I fear the
worst for both ZAP and 557 Mayfield.
Sure, my house is often referred to as
"The Old Beta House." and sure the resi
dents jokingly refer to it as the "Soon-to-be

Theta House." hut we'll he damned if we
aren't going to put up a fight.
Bahhitt needs to he wary of sueh com
ments as, "Some houses, of course, would
give up the fight for survival more gently.
After all. who knows or cares anything
ahout Durand. Grove or 557?"
I can name 41 people who care ahout
557, starting with myself. What is it that you
say — my house has no identity, no person
ality, no spunk? Hell, it's just a number.
Mavhc Hahhitt should hring his pseudo-
Cireek faux-row ZAP-loving little self over
to 557 and check it out. I promise the girls
in this "wimpy little house" have no
"cooties," and that it is an amazing place.
Hut let us not have Row houses fighting
against other Row houses; that will get us
nowhere. The Row knows that someone
will not he around next year. Let me remind
Jane Camarillo that these houses have a
long-standing community associated with
them. I fear that if 557 is chosen, the resi
dents' investment in the house will falter.
