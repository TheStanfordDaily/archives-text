# Only human
## Jocelyn Wiener Censor,; burn the rules of the game of life 
### 
GROWING UP with three younger
brothers makes an older sister out
of even the best of us. I remember
distinctly the afternoon my dad stopped
calling me "chicken" (affectionate, 1 swear)
and instituted a new nickname "8.1.8.5."
(Built-in Baby Sitter). I approached my
new role with a great deal of gravity, for it
was my responsibility to prepare these boys
for life as I knew it.
Hie eldest of my three brothers, Jon. has
always had a well-defined sense of right and
wrong. When I was eight and he was six, we
were Monopoly enthusiasts. One afternoon,
with absolute disrespect for his sense of
impropriety, I landed on Free Parking. In
my wise older sister capacity, I calmly
explained the rules of the game to Jon.
Then I scooped up all of the taxes that a few
mislortunate rounds of "Chance?" had
required him to throw into the Free Parking
pot. I lo watched, deaf to my ministry. There
was a clarity of purpose burning in his eyes
as he hurled that Monopoly board across
the room. Absolute, sincere, total certainty.
Twelve years later. Jon contends that

Monopoly has been phased out of his ideo
logical system. "Joe," he says, "do you real
ly think my friends and I are stuck in ele
mentary school?"
I smile knowingly. "Perhaps." I know it is
possible that board game injustice no longer
feeds the flames of his passionate existence.
But I think that is due to lack of tune rather
than lack of interest.
I won't go into his refusal at the age of iii
to learn to drive a car because cars are
harmful to the environment. (You can't
hike everywhere, I say). That he took off his
shirt in a school assembly while making a
speech about his disapproval of the science
curriculum is fascinating, though perhaps
tangential. (You did not need to do that. I
say). But the results of his latest struggle
have proven newsworthy, so 1 thought they
might bear mention here.
This latest scandal began quite pleasant
ly. Senior year, after all, is designed for the
rechanneling of intellectual energies. Once
"The Simpsons" is over, there are a number
of hours that the creative, time-efficient per
son must fill before Beavis and Butthead

come on.
Last week, two of Jon's friends decided
to use these hours to play a practical joke on
rival Mountain View High Sch(x>l. They
undertook the mighty task of rearranging
the letters of the marquee in front of the
school to read: MV SPAR FANS BLOW
GOA TS! "A nice touch," thought my jour
nalistic brother. Remarkable aesthetics/'
As opinions editor, he agreed to run a pic
ture of the feat on the front page of the Los
Altos High School newspaper.'
The evening before the paper was to
come out, the principal called him into the
office. "Jon," he explained gently, "you can
not run this picture. I have had enough of
your shit." Either the photo must be cut or
the entire newspaper would lose funding.
When Jon finally came home, he related
the incident to me over the phone. He
decried the condescension. He condemned
the illegality. He resolved to fight the
monopolistic injustice. In my official dual
capacity as older sister and voice of reason.
I told him the truth.
"Good luck fighting it," I said, "but I just

want you to know that high school censor
ship happens all the time. I his does not
compete with the drama of a Monica
Lewinsky coverup. Best wishes, but don't
get your hopes up tew) high. And please
don't be disappointed if no one listens.
Deal to rri) ministry, Jon called a lawyer.
He fliefred the school with Xeroxed copies of
the censured photo and the complete text ol
the California Student I ree Ex F session Law.
And he sent out letters to all of the major
area newspapers. I smiled ironically, proud
of lus idealistic, albeit naive conception of the
world as a place where people actually cared.
Thirty hours later, my brother had his picture
and his story pasted across the front pages ol
the Palo Alto Daily and the Peninsula sec
tion of the San Jose Mercury News.
His high school principal was not thrilled
when reporters came by asking about 112 irst
Amendment issues. Jon. on the other hand,
was pretty pleased. In a world where youth
are constructed as troublemakers and
semideveloped humans, getting a high
school principal to take your passions seri
ouslv is no easy task.

Waking your older sister out of her obli
gatory cynicism is even harder. I know too
much about the structure of power, the cor
porateness o! media, the disenfranchise
ment ot youth. So some days, I can't help
but \iew my brother's lack of cynicism as
naivete.
So what il he still believes that democra
cy. the ( (institution and the local papers can
all be implements of justice? What if he
does assert his freedom of expression in a
world where \outh are partial citizens? And
what il he does throw the Monopoly board
across the room when his older sister law
fully steals his tax dollars?
Jon's problem is not that he has not
learned the rules of the game; it's that some
day I might succeed in teaching them to
him. Perhaps we ought to burn the instruc
tions.
