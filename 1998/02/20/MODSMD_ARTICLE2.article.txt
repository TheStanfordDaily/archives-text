# Income rates rising from investments
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
Stanford University holdings and
investments are making money at
rates even faster than those of the
booming stock market, Stanford
Management Co. CEO Laurance
Hoagland told the Faculty Senate
yesterday.
"The actual returns gotten by our
managers have been substantially
and consistently better than the
benchmarks we've compared our
selves to." Hoagland said.
The merged endowment pool, for
example, has increased more than
tenfold, from $300 million to $4.5 bil
lion. in the last 20 years.
" The growth of the pool comes
from new gilts and high market re
turns." Hoagland said.
The management company,
which directs the Universitv's $6.2

billion dollar asset pool, invests a
high proportion of its funds in non
traditional sources, including in
ternational investments and nation
wide real estate holdings.
"Diversification is one of the few
free lunches in investing," 1 loagland
said. "By investing internationally,
we're not as dependent on the U.S.
stock market, and by keeping most of
our real estate away from the Bay
Area, we minimize earthquake
risks."
"We currently have only 39 per
cent [of the merged endowment
pool| invested in domestic equity,"
Hoagland said. "A few years ago.
that number would have been MX)
percent."
Another 23 percent of the pool is
invested in international equity. IS
percent is in alternative investments
and l(i percent is in real estate.
This diversification helps to offset
one of Hoagland's main worries: the
volatility of the stock market.
"Markets tend to fluctuate, and al
though we haven't seen it lately. I'm
sure it will happen," he said.
The management company was
founded in 1991 in order to profes
sionalize the management of Stan
ford's investments. Previously, the

I Jniversity relied on members of the
Board of Trustees to oversee its in
vestment strategy. With the forma
tion of the management company.
Stanford employed full-time, profes
sional investment managers to super
vise its assets.
Hoagland admits that Stanford
has a long way to go before it can
match the assets of Harvard.
"1 see a university like a business,
and the leader in any business has
huge advantages and a lot of momen
tum. and it's hard to approach that
level." he said. "On the investment

side, we have a long way to catch up.
Harvard's endowment is about 2.5
times ours."
Another concern raised by the
senate was that, while at some Ivy
League universities the endowment
makes up 20 or 30 percent of the an
nual university budget, it only com
prises 14 percent at Stanford.
"We're making some progress
there." Hoagland notes. "A couple of
years ago it was 12 percent. Now it's
14 percent, but we're still behind the
competition."

Provost Condoleezza Rice an
nounced the makeup of the nominat
ing committee to fill the position of
the dean of the school of arts and sci
ences. That position will become va
cant next fall when current dean John
Shoven steps down after a four-year
term.
The committee, which is chaired
by Rice and Economics Prof. John
Taylor, includes nine other profes
sors from the School of Humanities
and Sciences, one professor from the
Medical School, a graduate student
and an undergraduate student.
