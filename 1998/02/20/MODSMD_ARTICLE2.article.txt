## 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
Stanford University holdings and
investments are making money at
rates even faster than those of the
booming stock market, Stanford
Management Co. CEO Laurance
Hoagland told the Faculty Senate
yesterday.
"The actual returns gotten by our
managers have been substantially
and consistently better than the
benchmarks we've compared our
selves to." Hoagland said.
The merged endowment pool, for
example, has increased more than
tenfold, from $300 million to $4.5 bil
lion. in the last 20 years.
" The growth of the pool comes
from new gilts and high market re
turns." Hoagland said.
The management company,
which directs the Universitv's $6.2

billion dollar asset pool, invests a
high proportion of its funds in non
traditional sources, including in
ternational investments and nation
wide real estate holdings.
"Diversification is one of the few
free lunches in investing," 1 loagland
said. "By investing internationally,
we're not as dependent on the U.S.
stock market, and by keeping most of
our real estate away from the Bay
Area, we minimize earthquake
risks."
"We currently have only 39 per
cent [of the merged endowment
pool| invested in domestic equity,"
Hoagland said. "A few years ago.
that number would have been MX)
percent."
Another 23 percent of the pool is
invested in international equity. IS
percent is in alternative investments
