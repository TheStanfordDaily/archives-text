Beneath the large white letters of
the Hollywood sign and nestled be
tween the rolling hills of Westwood.
it seems to be the site for the making
of a major motion picture. Two rivals
meet once again, journeying to a
rainy and smog-filled setting to even
the score with each other.
Stanford's No. 1 baseball team
(10-0-1) opens up what could be its
toughest conference season in 15
years by facing the No. 14 UCLA
Bruins (7-4. 2-0) in a three-game se
ries this weekend at Jackie Robinson
Stadium.
'The league is probably the best it
h;is been in 15 or 20 years, from top to
bottom," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "If you have a bad
weekend, you could lose the confer
ence. There are four or five teams
that could conceivably win it. It's re

ally wide open."
With Stanford leading the pack in
Baseball America's new poll, the
Cardinal is followed by USCat No. 3,
Arizona in the seventh spot. ASIJ at
No. <8. and I K 'LA ranked 14th.
UCLA, however, seems to be on
the upswing. Winning their last six
games, the Bruins are led by the
heavy hitting of junior center fielder
Erik Valent. Valent has homered in
four consecutive games, one shy of
the school's record, heading into
tonight's game.
"They're a real solid team." Mar
quess said. "They are probably one of
the better hitting teams in the confer
ence."
The Cardinal hasn't been hitting
too shabbily either, outscoring its op
ponents 99-46 thus far. Junior Jody
Gerut is batting .425 with four home
runs and 16 RBI and sophomore
Nick Day is hitting .406.
To subdue the hard-hitting Bru
ins. however, will require experi
enced pitching, something the C ardi
nal hardly lacks. Stanford's weekend
rotation of Jeff Austin. Brent Hoard
and Chad Hutchinson will have to
guard a shallow homerun fence.
"Their ballpark is small," Mar
quess added.
"They want to have a chance to
win the league too. They play very
well at home."
With a 2.00 ERA. Austin leads
the Cardinal pitching staff with his 3-
0 record. Hoard and Hutchinson

have pitched fewer innings, but both
are undefeated as well.
This month's rainy weather, al
though a nuisance, is not limited to
the Cardinal. With Southern ( alitor
nia getting its fair share of I I Nino,
both teams have had to struggle to gel
in their practices as well as their
games.
"It's frustrating." Marquess said.

"You would like to have more prac
tice time. Considering the amount of
practice time, though. I think we are
alright."
With forecasts ol rain in l.t* An
geles this weekend. Stanford may
have to play a doublehcader to make
up lor a lost day. as it did with both
Texas and ( 'a I State Fullerton.
"A doublehcader is always diffi
cult. but vou have to do what you
have to do to i»et the games in. Mar
quess said All in all. we have been
very fortunate |to get the games in]
