always fun to beat California.
The 15th-ranked Stanford
women's gymnastics team looks to
trample the unranked Bears tonight
at 7:30 p.m. at Burnham Pavilion.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Tonight: No. 15 Stanford (5-3, 1-3
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. California
(5-7,0-6) at Burnham Pavilion. 7:30
p.m.

Stanford (5-3. 1-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) is looking for its sixth win.
despite the fact that head coach Mark
Cook will be resting some of the
stiuad's best gymnasts, playing with

the lineup and adding difficulty into
the routines.
Cal (5-7,0-6 Pac-10) is headed by
a new coach this year — former
IJC I A gymnast I rina Tinlv — and is
in the process of rebuilding a lagging
program. Berkeley averages only
187.395 for its team score but has a
few quality individual gymnasts.
Their individual talent, however, is
no match for Stanford's depth.
The Bears are unfortunately with
out freshman star Pari Olver who is
out for the season after tearing her
anterior cruciate ligament in practice
last Thursday. Olver was Cal's lead
ing all-arounder and scored a season
high of 38.450 against Arizona. Step
ping up for Cal in ()lver's place will be
sophomore Leila Khany. senior
Christine Nishimoto and junior Jen
nifer Bialosky.

"We're excited that this is a home
meet." Cook said. "We're playing for
our school and for our fans. We're
not concentrating on Cal."
I"he rest will he much needed hy
gymnasts like junior co-captain Amy
Murakami, senior co-captain Keri
Monahan and freshman Jenny Wil
son. who have all been competing in

at least three events at each of the
Cardinal's eight meets. All three
gymnasts, especially Murakami (who
is currently ranked 15th in the nation
in the all-around), have been key the
entire seas* >n and will be leaders if the
Cardinal advances to postseason

play.
Cook says the Cal meet comes at
a good time in the season. Next week
marks the beginning of the Cardi
nal's intense training as the team pre
pares for the second hall' of the sea
son. It will have important meets like
11 111-ranked Oregon State next Fri
day and then the Pac-10 Champi
onship meet on March 21.
"We've paced ourselves well."
Cook said. "We're trying different
ways of training for the events which
have proved beneficial, and we're
going to start pushing training much
harder after this meet."
Regardless of the Weenies,
tonight will be a fun meet and will
test the Cardinal's depth. Fans will
get to see a crazy Stanford lineup full
of switches, substitutions and dele
tions.
Senior Amy Neil will go out in
style in her final meet against Cal, as

she will compete in the all-around for
the first time in her collegiate career.
Sophomore Sarah Harding, who
didn't compete last week, will return
to the lineup in both bars and floor,
while Monahan, who is nursing a
hurt shoulder, will only compete on
floor and vault.
Fans will also be surprised to see
junior Katie Fitzpatrick competing
for the first time since last year's na
tionals. Fitzpatrick, who was out for
the first part of the season recovering
from an ankle surgery, will compete
on the uneven parallel bars.
"It's been a long season for me so
far, and 1 m still getting into the swing
of things," Fitzpatrick said. "I'm ex
cited to finally be able to contribute
to the team."
Sophomore Kim Young will be
performing a more difficult bar dis
mount and sophomore Larissa
Fontaine will be performing a
"yurchenko." which is a round-off
entry on vault. The entry has a start
value of 10.0. the Cardinal'sonly 10.0
start value on vault so far this year.
Even when it's not a challenge, it's
always fun to beat California.
