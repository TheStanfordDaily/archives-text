WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Tonight: No. 15 Stanford (5-3, 1-3
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. California
(5-7,0-6) at Burnham Pavilion. 7:30
p.m.

Stanford (5-3. 1-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) is looking for its sixth win.
despite the fact that head coach Mark
Cook will be resting some of the
stiuad's best gymnasts, playing with

the lineup and adding difficulty into
the routines.
Cal (5-7,0-6 Pac-10) is headed by
a new coach this year — former
IJC I A gymnast I rina Tinlv — and is
in the process of rebuilding a lagging
program. Berkeley averages only
187.395 for its team score but has a
few quality individual gymnasts.
Their individual talent, however, is
no match for Stanford's depth.
The Bears are unfortunately with
out freshman star Pari Olver who is
out for the season after tearing her
anterior cruciate ligament in practice
last Thursday. Olver was Cal's lead
ing all-arounder and scored a season
high of 38.450 against Arizona. Step
ping up for Cal in ()lver's place will be
sophomore Leila Khany. senior
Christine Nishimoto and junior Jen
nifer Bialosky.

"We're excited that this is a home
meet." Cook said. "We're playing for
our school and for our fans. We're
not concentrating on Cal."
I"he rest will he much needed hy
gymnasts like junior co-captain Amy
Murakami, senior co-captain Keri
Monahan and freshman Jenny Wil
son. who have all been competing in

at least three events at each of the
Cardinal's eight meets. All three
gymnasts, especially Murakami (who
is currently ranked 15th in the nation
in the all-around), have been key the
entire seas* >n and will be leaders if the
Cardinal advances to postseason
