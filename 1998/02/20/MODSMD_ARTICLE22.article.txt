SEATTLE - The last time the
Stanford women's basketball team
faced Washington, junior forward
Kristin Folkl pounded the Huskies
for a career-high 36 points en route to
a 90-70 win.
For No. 21 Washington, last
night's game must have felt like a re
curring nightmare.
Just when the Huskies (16-7, 7-7
Pacific 10 Conference) had managed
to overcome an 11-point halftime

;uiil cut it to 51-50 with 10 minutes 12
seconds remaining, Folkl and the rest
of the fifth-ranked Card (16-5, 12-1)
put down the hammer with an IK-3
run.

"I think Kristin is phenomenal,"
said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "She has incredible in
stincts for the game, not just shooting
and touch, but also her passing and
court awareness. She's someone who
makes everyone around her better."
Folkl scored 10 of her game-high
26 points in the final X:O2 as the C ard
pulled out a 71-59 win in front of
4,4 l )l at Hec Edmundson Pavilion.
That was when Washington's dou
ble-teaming strategy fell apart and
Stanford's post game found its
groove, giving Stanford its 10th con

secutive win.
Stanford got tilings going in the
first half with the accurate shooting
that's made it the nation's leader in
field goal percentage. The Card was
shmning over 6() percent midway
through the first half and pulled out
to a 16-point advantage, 34-18. on a
16-foot jumper from Folkl.
The 6-foot-2 forward couldn't
miss in the first half, going five of six
from the field (four of six from the
line). Folkl just shot over people en
routeto 14first-half points I'welveot
those came in the last 4 44 as Folkl
scored Stanford last \2 points of the
