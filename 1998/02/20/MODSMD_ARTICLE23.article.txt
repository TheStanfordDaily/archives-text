### Ben Hur Senior staff writer 
The Washington Huskies don't like Kris
Weems.
Weems lit up the Huskies for 32 points en route
to a 93-70 Cardinal victory last night at Maples
Pavilion.
The junior guard shot an incredible 13-for-18 in
cluding four three-pointers, causing a headache for
Washington head coach Bob Bender.

"Kris Weems was absolutely tremendous." Ben
der said. "He's a great shooter, with a scorer's men
tality: he can do it in a number of ways. He was just
impossible for us to guard."
It was Weems who drove the stake in Washing
ton's heart when the two teams met in Seattle on
Jan. 24. With the Cardinal trailing by one with time
running out. Weems nailed a trey to steal the win.
This time, Weems' tortured the Huskies
throughout the game. After scoring only once in
the first eight minutes, Weems went on a rampage,
scoring 16 points to close out the half.
"Kris was obviously feeling it," Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery said. "He gets like this; it's not
something we haven't seen before. There are times

when that ball looks like a million
bueks."
Weems' three-point basket with
II minutes, 51 seconds left in the
first half broke a 15-15 tie and under
the guidance of his hot hand, the
Card shot its way to an 11-point lead
at the break.
Hut Weems wasn't finished. He
continued his sizzling evening with
an 18-foot jumper early in the sec
ond half. Then came the fadeaway
off a curl, followed by a jumper in
junior I)onald Watts' face — the list
goes on and on.
"After a while you just start feel
ing it." Weems said. "You just get
that confidence going and shooting
the ball well. Then the guys start
looking for you."
And it's not like Weems could
take a breather on defense. Weems
drew the assignment of guarding
Watts, who scored 21 points for the
Huskies in their last meeting with
the Card.
Watts is "a great player, he gave
us some trouble up there |in Wash
ington)," Weems said. "You have to

keep a guy from his strong points,
and 1 think I did that."
This time around. Watts had
trouble finding the bottom of the
net. Besides his six fast-break
points. Watts shot just 2-for-10 and
had a largely frustrating evening.
Weems and the rest of the Stan
ford starters did receive an offen
sive boost from the Cardinal bench,
which outseored the Washington
reserves by 22 points. Freshman
Mike McDonald scored nine points
in 13 minutes of play, breaking
down the defense with some nifty
drives to the basket.
But anyway you look at it.it was
Weems' night. He seemed to find
the hoop despite Washington's best
efforts to stop him. Everyone in
Maples knew who Stanford wanted
to get the ball to. Remarkably, it
didn't matter.
When asked about how he found
so many openings. Weems gave
credit where credit was due.
"(iood screens by the bigguvs —
that was the main thing." Weems
said. "Art and the other point
guards were looking for me, and the
coaches were calling more plays for
me. I he shots just came easier and
easier."
