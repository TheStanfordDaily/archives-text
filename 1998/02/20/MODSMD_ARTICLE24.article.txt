The last time the men's basket
ball team met Washington, Kris
Weems hit the game-winning three
pointer at the buzzer to give Stan
ford the 74-72 win in Seattle.
Last nightat Maples. Weems was
once again the hero, but he wasn't
about to let this game become a
nail-biter.

The junior off-guard scored 32
points, two short of his career-high,
to lead the No. 10 Cardinal (22-3.
11-2 Pacific 10 Conference) past
Washington 93-70 last night at
Maples Pavilion.
Weems was 13-of-lK from the
field and 4-of-6 from behind the
three-point line in his most prolific
scoring performance since he lit up
Oregon for 34 points on Jan. 5.
Weems played 33 minutes, but

shot only once early on and scored
30 points in his last 25 minutes on
the floor.
Weems also did the job at the
other end of the court. He held
Donald Watts, the Huskies' sec
ond-leading scorer with 17.8 points
per game, to just 14 points, six of
which came off of open-court
breaks. Watts only hit 5-of-13 from
the floor.
"Good screens from the big guys

were the main thing," Weems said.
"I think I was more patient and not
running to my screens too early.
And when [defenders] did get there
on time and made me put it on the
flixir I did a g(x>d job of changing it
up and getting to the paint.
"I just felt I had a good stroke. 1
was using my legs which 1 hadn't
been doing as well maybe before
