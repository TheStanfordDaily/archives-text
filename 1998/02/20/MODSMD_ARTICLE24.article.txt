### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
The last time the men's basket
ball team met Washington, Kris
Weems hit the game-winning three
pointer at the buzzer to give Stan
ford the 74-72 win in Seattle.
Last nightat Maples. Weems was
once again the hero, but he wasn't
about to let this game become a
nail-biter.

The junior off-guard scored 32
points, two short of his career-high,
to lead the No. 10 Cardinal (22-3.
11-2 Pacific 10 Conference) past
Washington 93-70 last night at
Maples Pavilion.
Weems was 13-of-lK from the
field and 4-of-6 from behind the
three-point line in his most prolific
scoring performance since he lit up
Oregon for 34 points on Jan. 5.
Weems played 33 minutes, but

shot only once early on and scored
30 points in his last 25 minutes on
the floor.
Weems also did the job at the
other end of the court. He held
Donald Watts, the Huskies' sec
ond-leading scorer with 17.8 points
per game, to just 14 points, six of
which came off of open-court
breaks. Watts only hit 5-of-13 from
the floor.
"Good screens from the big guys

were the main thing," Weems said.
"I think I was more patient and not
running to my screens too early.
And when [defenders] did get there
on time and made me put it on the
flixir I did a g(x>d job of changing it
up and getting to the paint.
"I just felt I had a good stroke. 1
was using my legs which 1 hadn't
been doing as well maybe before
the LA. trip. I think ! was a little fa
tigued from playing a lot of minutes
and I wasn't concentrating on heinga
fundamentally sound, good shoot
er."
The win snaps the C ardinal hrief
two-game home losing streak and
adds more momentum to a team try
ing to put together a strong run be
fore the NCAA tournament.
" The two things we feel like we
have todo is rebound the ball and de
fend" Montgomery said. "I thought
we did tonight and then we kind of
ran our Kris Weems offense. We
>vere having trouble getting the ball
o some people, hut when he's
â– tutting the ball on the floor and get

ting in the lane and jumping up and
shooting it that means he's feeling
pretty good."
The Huskies (15-8, H-6) started
the game aggressively, the same way
they played when they hosted the
Cardinal on Jan. 24.
They converted their first four
steals of the game into eight points
and took a 21-20 lead with X minutes,
42 seconds remaining.
That was the only lead they would
get all night.
The Cardinal went on an 11-2 run
with point guard Mike McDonald
scoring four points as he ran the floor
smoothly.
The freshman reserve finished
the night with a career-high nine
points and added two assists and a
steal without turning the ball over.
Alony with Weems. the bench

play ended up making the difference
in the game. Stanford's bench
outscored Washington's 36-13. The
Cardinal reserves also outrebound
ed the Huskies'. 23-K.
Sophomore power forward Mark
Madsen continued his return to old
form, pulling down a game-high 11
boards. The Cardinal ended up out
rebounding the Huskies by 16.
Madsen "had a stretch rebound
ing-wise where I though! he domi
nated.'' Montgomery said. "There
was about a five-six minute stretch
where everything that went up. he
got. That's what we need from Mark.
We've just got to get that offense
where he gets more comfortable
making some moves and I think that
will come. When he starts reacting to
the ball like that and getting his two
big hands on it. generally its his."

Seven-foot center Todd MacCul
loch led the Huskies with 14 points
and eight assists. Guard Deon Luton
chipped in 1 7 points, but only hit 5-of
15 from the field.
Hie loss is a serious setback for a
Washington team that was already
on the bubble for the N( AA tourna
ment.
"It puts everything back in per
spective for what we still have to ac
complish." said Washington coach
Mob Bender. "As I told the team,
there are no guarantees of anything.
We have to win more basketball
games before this thing ends.
"We've got to quit looking at
where we're at in the standings re
gardless of'what happens tonight [in
conference play] because there's no
guarantee of how niiiny teams [make
it to the tournament)."
