## Injury is a tough pill to swallow 
### Bill Hanson 
In anticipation of Saturday's
competition with California and
UC-Santa Barbara, the men's gym
nastics team finds itself in a bind.

MEW'S GYMNASTICS
■ Saturday: Stanford vs. California
and UC-Santa Barbara at Burnham
Pavilion, 7 p.m.

Coach Sadao Hamada and the
gymnasts have long been aware
that this year was a transition year,
but that struggle is now compound
ed by the absence of several key
gymnasts due to injury. In fact, in
juries are so prevalent among the
gymnasts that active team mem
bers find themselves having to
compete in their worst events.
National champions four years

ago, the men's gymnastics program
has been faltering of late. Though
still a strong and well-respected
program, the team has been nei
ther as consistent nor as deep over
the past two years. Moreover,
three Ail-Americans graduated
last year, leaving a disproportion
ate amount of responsibility on in
coming freshmen's shoulders.
Of the three co-captains, juniors
Jeremy Herman and Scott Finkel
stein and senior Clarence Miao,
Finkelstein is out all season with an
injury and Miao's broken arm is
keeping him off the mat for the
time being. In addition,sophomore
Craig Nesbitt is plagued by shoul
der problems and freshman Re
shad Garan is sitting out the season
with an injury.
"We've been dealing with in
juries, and we're a really small
team." \liao said. "Our primary
goal is to stay healthy."
The team is optimistic about the
future yet remains realistic about
this season.
"With these top guys out. we're
probably going to have to set our
goals back, like getting to the finals
of the NCAAs.'said freshman Jason
Hilt/, a standout on the high bar.
"It's a strange year for us." Her
man said. "We're usually in the run
ning."
Seniors Ciabe Edelman and
David Ludlow have been crucial so
far this season, but a group of fo
cused freshmen — Biltz, Rico An
drade and Bobby Osterhoff — have
been training hard in an attempt to
fill the hole left by the injuries.
"Usually the first year you don't
rely on them too much, because
they're inexperienced." said Stan
ford assistant coach Kyle Asano.
"But they've really had to step for
ward. and I think that's going to
benefit them over the next years."
Talented sophomore Jason Kat
sampes is also stepping forward and
coming into his own when the team
needs him most.
"Katsampes consistently hits his
routines." Asano said. "He's a guy I
can rely on."
The unusually small size of the
team makes the performance of
each gymnast crucial, but Asano in
sists that there are upsides to having
a small team.

"Some people say having a small
team is a bad thing because you
don't have as many people to fill the
spots, but 1 believe the smaller the
group is the tighter they're going to
be." Asano said. "It forces them to
improve. They're on each other all
the time."
At the core of the team, howev
er. remains Hamada. the team's
longtime coach.
"Sadao's an amazing coach,"
Herman said. "He pushes us a lot
further than we think we're capable
of being pushed. I le tells us we can
win national championships. We're
like, 'maybe, maybe not.' Then we
go there and win. We start out slow;
his philosophy is to peak towards
the end of the season."
A national championship, of
course, seems unlikely this year.
After dominating Cal for several
years, the Bears have finally
emerged as "the team to beat.
They're the reigning champs." Biltz
said. "We go against them almost
every week, so we always know
where we stand with the best."
So far this season, the Stanford
men have stood quite a distance
from the best, posting scores far
below those boasted by Cal. Al
though it is unlikely they will
threaten Cal's reign this year, the
gymnasts are not fretting just yet.
"They did a lot of international
recruiting this year." Miao said.
"There are 14 people on their
team, including four ()lympic-level
foreign recruits from Eastern Eu
rope and Israel. But next year we
have a lot of the top recruits com
ing here."
