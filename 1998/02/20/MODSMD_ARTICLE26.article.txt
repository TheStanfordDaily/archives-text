■ Saturday: Stanford vs. No. 13 Fovola Mara
mount (2-3.2-3) at Maples Pavilion. 3 p.ni

Tonight's match will be the toughest the
Cardinal has played this year. Pepperdine's
sole loss this season came in a five-game
match to No. 1 UCLA. Since that loss. Pep
perdine has posted two victories over third
ranked BYU.
"They are the hottest and prohahlv the
best team in the country right now." Stanford
head coach Ruben Nievessaid.
In addition to being one of the best team 1 -
in the country, the Waves* top hitler, junior
outside hitter George Roumain. is a plavei
thai Nieves considers to be out ol the best in
the country.
Roumain has carried a heavy-hitting load
for the Waves tnis season, with 210 kills in just
27 games. This total ranks Roumain firs! na
tionally in kill average, with 7.78 per game. I le
also ranks ninth in hitting percentage, with
.461.
Stanford will also have to contend without
of the best blockers in the country, senior mid
dle blocker Rick Tune. Tune played the In si
three years of his eligibility at Hawaii IK is
currently a graduate student at Pepperdine. A
new NCAA regulation allows him to compete

for them with his remaining eligibility, rune
was a late addition to tin Waves and a pleas
ant surprise that rounded out the team's line
up
While the Waves are a good team in most
aspects of the game, the C ardinal hopes to ex
pose a possible weakness in the area of serve
receive Stanford has been able to put several
teams in trouble this season with its serves and
hopes to do the same tonight. Pepperdine will
look to Ireshman outside hitter Scott Wong, a
steady playei who has helped the team stabi
lize its passing in the past.
Tomorrow's matchup with Loyola Mary
mount will be |iist as difficult for Stanford.! he
( ardinal is still in a battle with Hawaii lor first
place in the Pacific I )ivision of the MPSF. The
Rainbows defeated I .Ml J two weeks ago. and
the Cardinal needs a victory to keep it's half
game advantage over Hawaii in the standings.
"I'm every bit as worried about Saturday's
match." Nieves commented. "No matter what
the outcome. Friday 's match will be emotion
al and draining to some extent."
Although LMU does not look very good
on paper, they are still an exceptional team.
Their only losses have been to UCLA. Pep
perdine <inu Hawaii, three of the top four
teams in the country.
I MU is. height-wise, a small team, but is an
experiencec' team that controls the ball well
and plays good defense Tomorrow's match
will depend on the stiength of Stanford's at
tack and 1 Ml J's abilits to defend against the
('ardinal s strong hitting and serving.
Senior middle blockers I ad Hoffman and
kccnan Whitehursi who are currently
ranked fourth (.503) and second (.557). re
spectively in the nation in hitting percentage
will be <i strong factoi in that attack, as will
sophomore outside hitter Andy Witt
I his weekend will be an excellent oppoi
tuiiitv for ( ardinal fans to see some great vol
leyball matches as Stanford attempts toestab
lish themselves as one of the teams to beat this
yeai Tonight's match marks the first time in
more than;i year that the ('ardinal has been a
sign if ican t unde rdt)g.
