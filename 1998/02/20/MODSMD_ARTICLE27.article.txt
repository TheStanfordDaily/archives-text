# 'No tomorrow'
## Pac-8 tournament hockey's last hope 
### Will Flemming Contributing writer 
For the Stanford ice hockey team,
which has struggled through ;i disap
pointing season full of inconsistency
and disappointment, there is no to
morrow. In this weekend's single
elimination Pacific X Conference
Tournament in Eugene, Ore., the
Cardinal has two options: win 01
come home.

ICE HOCKEY
â–  Saturday: Stanford ( Pa
cific 8 Conference) vs. UCI A (12-5
7-5) in Eugene. Ore.

Judging from its record in must
win games so far this season, it
doesn't kx)k good for the ( ardinal
When a series sweep at I JSC
would have locked up a berth at the
American Club Hockey Associa
tion's national tournament, the Car
dinal dropped the second game and
handed the Trojans a berth in nation
als and the Pac-8 title.
And when it desperately needed a
strong showing against Washington
State in the final series before the
draw for the national tournament
was finalized, they fell short once
again and split the series with the
Cougars.
And even though tin Cardinal
seemed to have put all the pieces to
gether last weekend in its two-game
sweep of arch rival California, doubts
about its ability to pull through in the
big game still linger
But starting with the opening
faceoff in Stanford's first round game

against UCLA on Saturday, it is a
whole new season.
The Pac-N tournament is a chance
for the Cardinal to forget about all
the injuries and near misses. A
chance to prove to the rest of the
West that its 12- l > regular season
record and second-place conference
finish are not at all indicative of the
quality of its team.
But most importantly, it is a
chance at revenge.
The Cardinal would love nothing
more than to face I ISC in the finals
and have a shot at redemption a
shot to prove to the Trojans that it is
the superior team, which deserved
the final bid to nationals.
"Obviously. USC won the Pae-8
and had a better overall record than
we did." said senior defenseman Paul
1 leneman. "But we did split the sea
son series, and we outplayed them in
every game. We had a much more
difficult schedule than I ISC. which is
reflected in our record. We would
just love one last shot to finally prove
that we are the better team."
In order to get such a chance, the
Card must first defeat UCI A (12-5.
7-5 Pac-8). a team who they have not
faced yet this season, and therefore,
know little about
"We haven't had a chance to see
them play yet." said senior captain
Evan Asa no "Obviously, since they
finished third in the Pac-8. they have
had some degree of success. We |iist
hope that we can take advantage of
our speed and skill level, and good
things will happen
USC plays Oregon in the other
semifinal game on Saturday
