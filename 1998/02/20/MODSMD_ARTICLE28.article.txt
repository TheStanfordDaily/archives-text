"We have an effective system of
playing." said freshman Hilary
Gallogly. "We need to make sure
we control the game instead of re
acting to how they play."
Since the first tournament of
the year, the team has been work
ing on adding to its strong defense
and improving its offense.
"We've added a few more things
into our defense to respond to at
tack " said Stanford head coach
John Tanner. "And we're working
on more consistency in the offense
and a more patient attack."
Tanner described Davis as a
team with great depth. The\ have
no real standouts, but they do have
10 solid players for the Cardinal to
contend with
"Davis has a balanced offensive
attack with many different players
doing the scoring." Tanner said
However. Stanford also has an
extremely strong bench, which is
one of its prime assets.

"We have a deep team.'' said
sophomore Ellen Estes. "That
gives us an advantage over the
other. We have 10 to 12 starters off
the bench."
Another one of Stanford's
strengths is its physical endurance.
Cirueling swim workouts and
morning weight training have
given the team the speed and sta
mina necessary to rise above its
competition. The San Diego tour
nament proved that the Cardinal
squad is one of the most physically
prepared teams in the league
"We out-swam the other teams
in most instances." Estes said.
"Our swim workouts have really
improved our speed "
The Card has also learned to
react to the strategies of its oppo
nents and has been emphasizing
ways to deal with the different at
tacks the team expects to meet
with over the course of the season.
Stanford's offense is centered
around the strength of its powerful
hole players, which include Estes.
