### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
Yesterday afternoon. Stanford
protesters geared up to hold anti
war demonstrations on Parents'
Weekend.
More than 70 students and facul
ty members stayed after the "U.S.-
Iraq C risis" forum held in the Histo
ry Building to plan for distributing
flyers, putting up posters and staging
demonstrations.
"Being so far away from Wash
ington in an oasis at Stanford, its ex
tremely important to become as en
gaged as we can and to voice our op
position to the decisions that are
being made in our name." said Shira
Robinson, a Middle F.ast history
master's student who helped plan
the event.
Organizers are planning to
protest Feb. 27 at University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's "Conversa
tion with Parents" and on the next
day at a parents' reception.
The demonstrators hope to gain
national attention by having Presi
dent Clinton at Stanford.

"[Stanford is | ideal because ( lin
ton is coming and also because it has
a reputation for being a real estab
lishment think tank." said Georgia
la Riva, an activist for the Interna
tional Action Center who spoke at
the forum.
Protesters expressed no remorse
for using Parents' Weekend to their
advantage. "President Clinton is
definitely a public figure and. Par
ents' Weekend or not. he's still Pres
ident ( linton." said Amira Salaam,
a junior and vice president of the
Organization of Arab American
Students in Stanford.
However, the activists were
quick to state they would not in
volve freshman Chelsea Clinton in
their demonstrations.
"We should make sure that
Chelsea is screened out of the it."
saul Drama and Classics Prof. Rush
Rehm.
"Absolutely." seconded la Riva.
"It's the hypocrisy of the warmon
gers" that are being protested, she
said.
