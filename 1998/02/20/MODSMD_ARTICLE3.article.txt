# Crisis in Iraq
## Students plan to protest U.S. policy 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
Yesterday afternoon. Stanford
protesters geared up to hold anti
war demonstrations on Parents'
Weekend.
More than 70 students and facul
ty members stayed after the "U.S.-
Iraq C risis" forum held in the Histo
ry Building to plan for distributing
flyers, putting up posters and staging
demonstrations.
"Being so far away from Wash
ington in an oasis at Stanford, its ex
tremely important to become as en
gaged as we can and to voice our op
position to the decisions that are
being made in our name." said Shira
Robinson, a Middle F.ast history
master's student who helped plan
the event.
Organizers are planning to
protest Feb. 27 at University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's "Conversa
tion with Parents" and on the next
day at a parents' reception.
The demonstrators hope to gain
national attention by having Presi
dent Clinton at Stanford.

"[Stanford is | ideal because ( lin
ton is coming and also because it has
a reputation for being a real estab
lishment think tank." said Georgia
la Riva, an activist for the Interna
tional Action Center who spoke at
the forum.
Protesters expressed no remorse
for using Parents' Weekend to their
advantage. "President Clinton is
definitely a public figure and. Par
ents' Weekend or not. he's still Pres
ident ( linton." said Amira Salaam,
a junior and vice president of the
Organization of Arab American
Students in Stanford.
However, the activists were
quick to state they would not in
volve freshman Chelsea Clinton in
their demonstrations.
"We should make sure that
Chelsea is screened out of the it."
saul Drama and Classics Prof. Rush
Rehm.
"Absolutely." seconded la Riva.
"It's the hypocrisy of the warmon
gers" that are being protested, she
said.
The forum, arranged by several
Middle East students. Rehm and
I listorv Prof. Joel Beinin, was an ef
fort to highlight tactics of the "war
mongers" and to encourage active
opposition against them.
"People are being starved of in
formation." said la Riva. "We're
being totally blocked out."
Protesters hope the forum and
demonstrations will encourage more
students to get politically involved.
The meeting turnout was a sur
prisingly good sign for the speakers.
Audience members filled all the
seats and the aisles — doubling the
81-person capacity designated for
the room.
"1 was extremely impressed by
the number of people who came out
to listen to the speakers and got in
volved." Robinson said.
An eclectic group of people at
tended: hair color ranged from
brown to green to white and cloth
ing varied from T-shirts to button
down dress shirts.
Activists called for sustaining
this political activism. "I'd encour
age students to get involved in all
political issues because the political

system in the United States is cor
rupt," Beinin said.
The activists held that prevent
ing war with Iraq was essential — an
issue that should not be taken light
ly bv students. All of the speakers at
the forum voiced concern for the
Iraqi civilian population.
"I urge students to use all their
time — even if it means skipping a
class or two — to put a notice on
every bulletin board because the
U.S. government is so hell bent on
unleashing a massive bombing
war." la Riva said. "Innocent peo
ple will die."
The United Nations embargo on
Iraq also was a key issue.
"The embargo against Iraq
now that's a weapon of mass de
struction," Beinin said.
The forum concluded its presen
tation with the 25-minute video
"Genocide by Sanctions." which fo
cused on the nutritional and med
ical effects of the UN embargo on
Iraqi civilians.
"We hope to raise people's
awareness about U.S. foreign policy
in the Middle East and contribute
to the voices of opposition to this
impending attack." Robinson said.
"I think we should take our cues
from the students at Ohio State and
realize that our voices do count."
