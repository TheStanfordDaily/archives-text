## Two birds in the hand Buck "Knuckles" Thompson Living life is as easy as A, B, C 
### 
In the 16th century, William
Shakespeare — the famous poet
from London, England — wrote
the immortal words, "The luce is a
fresh fish. The salt fish is an old
coat." Those words are as true now
as they were then. Now, more than
ever, we need to become aware of
ourselves as units of being. The
world seems cold and unwelcom
ing, and there is a serious danger
that we die having never realized
our dreams.
Well, we're here to stop that.
I'm telling you that it's time to put
the "me" into "mentally capable."
Otherwise, the only thing you're
going to get out of "life" is "if."
At the Nothing Compares 2 U
Clinic (NC2UC), we believe in
showing vou "the real vou" in the

mirror we call "living in the total."
"Living in the total" means you
have to accept yourself for who
you are. Or, as we like to put it,
you have to "Self your help"
before you "Help yourself."
Do you agonize over the mean
ing of your existence? Do you
wonder if we'll ever know the
meaning of truth? Do you ask if
there is a God? The clinic has the
answers to all these questions and
more very short and very easy-to
understand answers. You might
like to say that we put the "U" into
"truth."
The thing we want you to stop
doing is lying to yourself. Remem
ber that denial is a river in Egypt,
and it slowly flows uphill into the
wait-and-sea.

James Joyce, the famous
painter, once said, "Mead of our
fathers for the Obermensch. Ditto.
Five number ones." And he was
right; sometimes you have to
remember that without "us" there
can be no "trust." Relationships
are founded on trust. Marriage
ends with "age" and that's how it
should end. A real marriage does
not end in divorce. If it did, it
would be spelled "a real marridi
vorce."
Without trust, your relation
ship is just going to be a relation
boat. If this is the case then,
believe me, the best it's ever going
to be is a relation-dinghy floating
down denial. You need to jump off
the relation-boat and "swim to
sure." T.S. Eliot, the great general.

understood this when he wrote,
"Twit twit twit. Jug jug jug jug jug
jug. So rudely forc'd. Tereu."
If you're "able to be stable"
then you'll be "Wed till your
dead." That is what Euripides,
Ginger Rogers' dancing partner,
meant when he said, "My hair is
holy. My curls belong to God."
Passion is fun, but remember that
it is a two-way-pointing gun that
can point both ways. Variety is the
spice of life, but don't let your
emotions get away with you. If
music is the food of love, then that
food might need the spice of vari
ety. But life-music with too much
variety-spice makes love a tough
act to swallow.
The thing you must avoid in
life is seeking answers that are iust

too complicated or demanding.
Those sorts of answers are just
there to distract you from being
you. Religions and philosophers
are just cheap fixes who demand
too much and bamboozle you with
hollow words, so they can confuse
you. Trust the clinic and stick to
stuff you understand; remember,
there is no "think" in happiness.
"And the less I seek the truth, the
closer I am to fine," wrote the
Indigo Girls. How right they were.
We don't want any long-term com
mitment or a higher level of under
standing. We just want to put the
"our" into "your money."

Mr. Thompson has held many occupations
in his life including football coach, drifter,
shingles salesman and italics writer.
