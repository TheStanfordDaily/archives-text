Q: Where do rainbows come from?
The government created rainbows back
in 1936 as part of FDR's New Deal.
The Rainbow Institution Act provided
many jobs to out of work laborers and
provided new housing for homeless lep
rechauns. With the Communist threat
rising in the late 19405, the United
States government moved its vast stores
of gold to these rainbows to safeguard
them..
Q: What are leprechauns?
Leprechauns, along with electrons, pro
tons and neutrons, are the building
blocks of the atom. They hoard their
pots of gold in neutrinos. They face a lot
of prejudice from neutrons, who do not
consider leprechauns "pure matter."
Q: What's "pure matter?"
The actual constitution of pure matter
has often been debated. Hitler thought
that pure matter consisted only of Aryan
blood, but he was wrong. But he did like
Wagner, and Wagner is a fine composer.
Have you heard "Ride of the
Valkyries?"
Q: Let me rephrase my question:
what \ pure matter?
Bom ba da bum bum, bom ba da bum
bum! Man, that scene in "Apocalypse
Now" just rocked! Mistah Kurtz, he
dead.
Q: How did they do the special effects
in "Titanic?"
Bom ba da BUM-BUM, bom ba da
BUM-BIJM, bom ba da BUUUUMM
MM!
Q: Is time travel possible?
[Applause) Thank you ladies and gen
tlemen. That was Wagner's "Ride of the
Valkyries." For my next trick, I will sing
the theme from "M*A*S*H" while gar
gling this sulfuric acid ajid wrestling
this man-eating Burmese shark.
