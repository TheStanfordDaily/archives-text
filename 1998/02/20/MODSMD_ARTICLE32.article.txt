Catalogue of Diseases (cant \l)
CABIN FEVER, cabinus fexerii is a common dis
ease among those trapped for long periods of time
in confined wooden structures, especially by snow.
The denigrating effects on the mind are well-docu
mented. Symptoms include restlessness, hyper
grafia, delusions and ax-murdering your family.
Another manifestation shows the related symptoms
of shivers, cannibalism and starving to death.
Favored treatment includes a shot of good whiskey.
BANJO-ON-THE-KNEE. Susannus noncrii
generally affects lovelorn males of the antebel
lum South. It is believed that the constant search
and concern for the obsessed patient's beloved
causes the humors of the body to boil and then
cool beneath the patella, forming a distinct
"banjo" shape. The knee usually returns to nor
mal size with a warm bath of whiskey or upon a
visit to Miss Caroline's house of ill repute.
TWO LEFT FEET. This condition seems to
arise from excessive horse wrangling. A second
left foot grows from the mid-shin area, making
all perambulation circular and directionless. It
can be treated by shooting the horse. Not to be
confused with the birth defect Foot Foot, where
an strange footlike growth grows on the foot.

CLOWN NOSE. Clownius nasii is a rare infection
of the nostrils and nasal cartilage that cause the
nose to swell up like a large, red honking ball. Its
effects include a fondness for cream pies and
seltzer water, a tendency to wear large clothes and
an increased propensity for crying on the inside. It
can be treated with a shot of birdpellet.

BULL'S EYE. Oculo
hornii was made
famous by Wild Dan
"Gonad" Go. He
awoke to discover two
horns growing out of
his pupilium. No cure
has been found, but
the pain from humilia
tion can be eased with
whiskey ointment in
the ear.
COMMUNISM. In
moments of dire need,
victims succumb to the
temptation to act as a
community, resulting
in an un-American
desire to share property
rather than compete for

it. The best known
cures are blacklist and
nuclear proliferation.
LYNCHING. An ill
ness common in the
West and South, it
tends to affect outlaws
and black people.
Symptoms include a
broken neck, dangling
in the air, and death.
High-risk behavior
includes being differ
ent, being just in an
unjust society, and
crossing the sheriff. No
cure exists for this ill
ness, but an inocula
tion of American val
ues can prevent it.
LUNG CANCER.

This is nothing to do with being a frontiersman.
There has been absolutely no scientific link
established yet.
