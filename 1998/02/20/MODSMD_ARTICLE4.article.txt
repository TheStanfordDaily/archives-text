## 
### Zachary Roberts Senior staff writer 
A telephoned bomb threat
closed the Stanford Bookstore for
almost two hours yesterday morn
ing while police and Bookstore
staff conducted a search of the
premises. No bomb was found.
The building was evacuated be
tween 10:45 a.m. and 1 p.m. during
the search. There was no count on
how many people were in the
Bookstore at the time of the evacu
ation, but Bookstore Director of

Operations Ken Shark estimated
that about KM) people were forced
to leave.
"It was ;i join! call between the
Bookstore and the police that the
building was safe." Shark said. "It's
impossible to guarantee anything
with a store this si/e. We did what
was prudent and felt that we had
taken the necessar\ steps to ensure
everyone's safety."
Repercussions Irom the incident
lasted into the afternoon.
"I went in to pick up m> photos
at 2:15 p.m.." said sophomore

Colby McCiavin. a history major.
" I he\ told me they were disorga
nized because of the bomb scare
and that I 'd have to conic back in 45
minutes."
At approximately 10:15 a.m.,
Stanford Police received a phone
call on their general line stating that
there was a bomb planted in the
Bookstore. Ihe call was so briel
that the police receptionist could
not identify whether the caller was
male or female.
The telephone threat did not
specify the type of bomb.
After consulting with officers
Nick Bruno and Tim Hanrahan.
the decision was made to clear the
Bookstore at 10:45 a.m. Shark
praised the evacuation process,
which he s;iid went smoothly.
"We sounded the fire alarm to
help evacuate the building." Shark
said. "It's loud, and strobes go off.
and it got people's attention.
Everything went well. It was a fast
and orderly evacuation."
The police were helped in their
search for a bomb by a Bookstore
security agent. A police dog named
Leon was also brought in to help

the search.
"It's standard procedure to
have store personnel assist the
search in a case like this." said
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington. "It's a combined effort,
since the police don't know the de
tails of the site nearly as well."
Many people evacuated from
the Bookstore took shelter from
the rain in the arched walkways of
Old Union. Several students were
reportedly yelled at by Bookstore
personnel for walking too close to
the store while it was closed.
"At this point we have no idea
about a possible motive for the
call." Herrington said. "We have
no speculation."
Police are asking anyone with
information about the incident to
call (650) 723-9633.
