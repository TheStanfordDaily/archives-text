# Viennese Ball
## 
### Allison Hays Editorial staff 
When couples dance the polka
in the moonlight and ball gowns fly
off the racks at Nieman's, you know
the Viennese Ball is at hand. For
some, this dance represents the
crux of social events, the place to
see and be seen. Others may quiet
ly mock the ostentation while
silently cursing their failure to take
part in it.
()ne thing is certain â€” ballroom
dancing has steadily gained popu
larity at Stanford in the last five

years.
"When I arrived as freshman. I
could easily get into Social Dance
I." said senior Doug Fisher. "This
year. I watch as literal!) do/ens of
students get turned away due to
overcrowding."
To balance the high demand for
lessons and the notorious shortage
of ball tickets, dancing lessons have
been provided off campus by in
structor Richard Powers, and this
year's ball is being held at Hyatt
Rickeys instead ot Roble Gym.
"1 think it is great that the ball is
being held off campus because

everyone has the opportunity to at
tend." Fisher said.
It is estimated that over I.(XH)
people will attend the ball this year,
almost 50 percent more than at
tended last winter.
The Viennese Ball opening
committee, consisting ol lh well
trained couples, will begin the tes
tivities with a rendition of the Vien
nese wait/. The performance is
choreographed h\ senior Katrinka
Jackson who has been a ballet
dancer for over 10 years
Jackson said she wishes to
achieve, through dance choreogra

phy. a seemingly effortless perfor
mance' that is embellished b\ a se
ries of complex dance patterns.
"1 relied on m\ ballet lor the mu
sicality ot the movements, while
dance team routines influenced my
use of different fUx>r patterns and
formations." Jackson said "T his
year. I basically jazzed up the basic
waltz circle to enhance the overall
visual experience. A lot of the steps
are basic, but the complexity ot pat
terns creates the sense of difficul
ty."
