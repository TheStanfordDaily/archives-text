# Viennese Ball
## 
### Allison Hays Editorial staff 
When couples dance the polka
in the moonlight and ball gowns fly
off the racks at Nieman's, you know
the Viennese Ball is at hand. For
some, this dance represents the
crux of social events, the place to
see and be seen. Others may quiet
ly mock the ostentation while
silently cursing their failure to take
part in it.
()ne thing is certain — ballroom
dancing has steadily gained popu
larity at Stanford in the last five

years.
"When I arrived as freshman. I
could easily get into Social Dance
I." said senior Doug Fisher. "This
year. I watch as literal!) do/ens of
students get turned away due to
overcrowding."
To balance the high demand for
lessons and the notorious shortage
of ball tickets, dancing lessons have
been provided off campus by in
structor Richard Powers, and this
year's ball is being held at Hyatt
Rickeys instead ot Roble Gym.
"1 think it is great that the ball is
being held off campus because

everyone has the opportunity to at
tend." Fisher said.
It is estimated that over I.(XH)
people will attend the ball this year,
almost 50 percent more than at
tended last winter.
The Viennese Ball opening
committee, consisting ol lh well
trained couples, will begin the tes
tivities with a rendition of the Vien
nese wait/. The performance is
choreographed h\ senior Katrinka
Jackson who has been a ballet
dancer for over 10 years
Jackson said she wishes to
achieve, through dance choreogra

phy. a seemingly effortless perfor
mance' that is embellished b\ a se
ries of complex dance patterns.
"1 relied on m\ ballet lor the mu
sicality ot the movements, while
dance team routines influenced my
use of different fUx>r patterns and
formations." Jackson said "T his
year. I basically jazzed up the basic
waltz circle to enhance the overall
visual experience. A lot of the steps
are basic, but the complexity ot pat
terns creates the sense of difficul
ty."

One of the major differences this
year is the revival of nightly activi
ties leading up to the ball. The series
of events is titled "Austria Week"
and provides students with Euro
pean feasts of sausages and hot alco
holic beverages. According to senior
Phoebe Ho. chairman of the Vien
nese Ball steering committee, the
festivities are modeled after a lost
tradition at Stanford that exposed
students to Austrian culture.
I'he attention and intrigue sur

rounding the Viennese Ball has
pointed to a larger trend of the bur
geoning popularity of ballroom
dance among young people.
"Most of the popularity of dance
on campus at least is due to the efforts
of Richard Powers," Fisher said. "11c
has exposed the campus to the art of
dancing and introduced such exquis
ite programs as Jammix."
Others feel that the treatment of
dance in the media and the sensual
contact that it involves has promot
ed its vitality for students.
"I think ballroom dance's popu
larity definitely has to do with the

way it has been portrayed in popular
media. But it also has a lot to do with
the fads of dancing," Jackson ex
plained. "Social dancing once again
invites the dancer to interact more
with his or her partner."
Movies are capable of inciting
such trends among young people.
Films like "Scent of a Woman"
made people flock to the tango
while "Swingers" has popularized
swing nightclubs. Ho. on the other
hand, feels that art imitates nature.
"The more recent movies just
portrayed the growing trend in soci
ety." Ho said. "There's always been

a special spirit of romance and inti
macy mixed with the flair of ball
room dancing."
Some students take significant
others, while others ask people
whom they are taking dance lessons
with.
"I have been asked to go and
turned ladies down. I have also been
rejected," said Fisher, who has at
tended the ball several times. "I
weigh a lot of factors into choosing
who I go with. It's important that she
knows how to dance and that she's
tolerable to spend an entire evening
with."
