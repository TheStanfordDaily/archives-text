## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
A panel of experts broadly
agreed on the causes ol the recent
Asian financial crisis but disagreed
on solutions at a symposium yester
day sponsored by the Hixner Insti
tution.
Most members of the panel
began their speeches by stressing

that the economic growth ol I .tst
and Southeast Asia \v;is ,i tremen
dous achievement but that the cur
rent crisis was .list) very real.
Mam of the panelists presented
a basically positive outlook lor the
affected economies, with the possi
ble exception ol Indonesia. As Se
nior Hoover Fellow Henry Row en
put it, "on the whole, the l ast Asian
model of development is linking

glHK.l
I he problems the panel saw were
principally government favoritism
in industrial policy and serious for
eign currency and debt problems
While there yyas a general con
sensus that political reform was nec
essary. dispute emerged over the
role of the International Monetary
Fund in solving the problem and the
need for so-called "currency

boards" in repairing countries' mon
etar\ policies
C Â»oveminent policies of favoring
certain financial institutions and
manufacturers came under fire
from panelists, mans of whom
spoke of a "moral hazard" in such
policies.
"Companies invest under the as-
sumption that if they gel into trou
ble. they would be helped out by the
government," said Gary Becker, a
Nobel Prize-winning economist and
senior 1 loover fellow.
Chung-ln Moon, a political sci
ence professor from Yonsei Univer
sity in Seoul, gave the example of
Samsung, a Korean company.
Samsung started making cars
based on signals from the govern
ment. This decision was clearly not
economically justified. Moon said.
This structure of favored rela
tionships also had crippling effects

on the financial institutions of coun
tries such as Indonesia. I his added
to the large problem of currencies
and debt in the region.
A symptom of the crisis is that
countries with massive debts in cur
rencies find those debts much higher
in real terms because their own cur
rencies are now worth far less
against the U.S. dollar.
"Suddenly ii $ 11).tHK) per capita
income became $S.tXX)," said Duck-
Soo Lee. a financial consultant for
the World Bank.
Stephen Parker, the chief econo
mist at the Asia Foundation in San
Francisco, s;iid such debt levels had
left the entire Indonesian economy
bankrupt.

Becker and several other pan
elists saw the cause as being the
Asian governments' policy ol fixed
exchange rates pegged to the U.S.
dollar without sufficient monetary
reserves to maintain those rates in
the event of a crisis such as the cur
rent one.
Meeker personally saw a solution
in nongovernmental currency
boards, which would take control of
many aspects of fiscal policy. This
would "make it much more difficult
for government to subsidize compa
nies through the banking system."
he said.
Parker disagreed, saying that in
countries such as Indonesia, the po
litical system is not sufficiently de

veloped for such a board to have
credibility. Becker countered that
he saw currency boards as contribut
ing to political reform rather than, as
Parker appeared to be saying, rely
ing on it.
In addition. Becker extended his
idea of "moral hazard" to the IMF
and its bailouts. In this he disagreed
with many panelists, particularly
Lee, who clearly favored the IMF
plan for his home country of South
Korea.
The panel also featured an as
sessment of Japan's inactivity in the
crisis from I listorv Prof. Peter Duus
and a development economist's per
spective from Business Prof. Emeri
tus Gerald Meier.
