## Trade deficit up 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
U.S. trade deficit climbed to
$113.7 billion in 1997, a nine-year
high, as the imbalances with both
Japan and China widened substan
tially.
In a worrisome sign of things to
come, the December imbalance
jumped a sharp 24 percent to $10.8
billion, the worst showing in four
months, as the fallout from the
Asian crisis began to be felt in the
trade numbers.
Economists predicted the situa
tion will worsen substantially in
coming months, with the most pes
simistic forecasting that America's
trade deficit in 1998 could rise by
$50 billion or more, costing as
many as 1.1 million high-paying
manufacturing jobs.
Such a development would rep
resent a real challenge for Presi
dent C linton, who is already under
attack from labor unions lor pur
suing trade policies they contend
have subjected American workers
to unfair competition from abroad.
I he administration sought to
emphasize the positive in noting
that U.S. exports climbed 10 per
cent last year and export growth
has accounted for fully one-third
of overall economic growth in the
past five years, helping to drive
the nation's unemployment rate
to the lowest levels in a quarter
century.
"The administration anticipates
solid overall performance of the
U.S. economy and continued job
creation in 1998 in spite of the like
ly deterioration of the trade pic
ture," said Janet Yellen. chairman
of the president's Council of Eco
nomic Advisers.
But the administration did step
up its assault on Japan, arguing
that the Japanese must do more
to boost domestic demand, both
as a way of reversing America's
growing trade deficit with Japan
and serving as an engine of
growth for its troubled Asian

neighbors.
Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin told reporters that this issue
would be on the agenda when he
meets tomorrow in London with
his counterparts from other major
economies.
"If Japan were on a strong eco
nomic track led by domestic
demand-led growth, it would be a
larger market for Asian goods, a
source of greater bank credit and a
wellspring of confidence for the
region." he said.
For all of last year, U.S. exports
of goods and services climbed 9.9
percent to a record $932.3 billion.
Hut imports set a record as well,
rising 9 percent to $1.05 trillion.
The overall deficit was up 2.4
percent from the 1996 imbalance
of $111 billion and was the worst
showing since the $115.9 billion
deficit in 1988.
America's deficit in products
climbed to an all-time high of
$198.9 billion. But this gap was off
set slightly by an increase in Amer
ica's surplus in services — such
things as airline fares, consulting
fees and royalty payments
which rose to a record $85.2 bil
lion.
The big rise in the December
trade deficit was led by a sharp
widening of the deficit with Pacif
ic Rim countries, which totaled
$10.6 billion in goods in Decem
ber. America's deficit with South
Korea, one of the country's hard
est hit by the currency crisis,
increased eightfold in December.
Economists are looking for con
tinued widening deficits with trou
bled Asian economies because of
the sharp devaluations of their cur
rencies, which will make U.S.
exports more expensive and Asian
products cheaper in the U.S. mar
ket.
Economist Larry Chimerine
said he looked for the U.S. deficit
in goods to widen by as much as
$50 billion this vear.
