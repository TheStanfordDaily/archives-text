## U.N. and Iraqi leaders reach an agreement 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — I J.N. chief
Koli Annan and Iraqi leader Saddam Hus
sein settled the last major obstacle yester
day to opening presidential palaces to
U.N. arms inspectors, the main condition
for avoiding a U.S. attack, Annan's
spokesman said.
I he agreement came during a three
hour meeting between Annan and Sad
dam at the Republican Palace, one of eight
presidential sites that Iraq had declared
off-limits to IJ.N. weapons inspectors, said
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
"We've reached an agreement," Eck
hard said. "We have a text."
One Iraqi official, who also insisted his
named not be used, was asked whether
there was a deal. He replied, "Yes."
Eckhard said "we expect the text will
be acceptable to all 15 members of the
Security Council," including the United
States, which has said it would refuse an
agreement that it believes undermines the
inspectors' authority.
White House spokesman Mike McCur
ry said preliminary accounts had been
received from Baghdad, but he refused to
assess them. "We've got a lot of serious

questions. It's a very serious matter at a
serious time, and we want to get some
questions answered." he said.
Annan and Iraq's deputy prime minis
ter. Tariq A/i/. met late yesterday to agree
on the precise wording of an agreement
the secretary-general will take back to the
Security Council.
Annan was scheduled to return to New
York today and brief the Security Council
tomorrow afternoon.
The crisis over weapons inspections has
brought the Persian Gulf to the brink of
war.
The United States has sent a naval
armada and 25.(KK) troops to the region to
mount air strikes unless Iraq agrees to
open all sites, including eight presidential
palaces, to the U.N. weapons inspectors.
Pro-Iraq protests have erupted across
the Arab world — Jordan had to send out
tanks in one desert city to contain them
and sent Israelis scurrying for gas masks
and diplomats there preparing to leave.
Israel also decided yesterday to distribute
antibiotics to protect against a biological
attack, despite Annan's news.
Britain, America's strongest backer for

a military strike. reacted cautiously.
" I he expectation is that Kofi Annan
will make an announcement in the morn
ing whether a deal has been brokered." a
spokesman lor Prime Minister l ony Blair
said yesterday on customary anonymity.
"Even then, he will report back to the
Security ( ouncil the details of that."
Annan briefed Blair by telephone on
his discussions with Saddam, the
spokesman said without elaborating.
Annan met with the Iraqi leader after
talks with Aziz since Friday failed to
resolve the last major obstacle Iraq's
demand for a time limit on inspections of
presidential compounds.
Eckhard said that time limits were not
part of the agreement, but that details of the
deal would first be presented to the council.
I he United States and other council
members had rejected any deadline.
The U.N. inspectors are trying to deter
mine if Iraq has complied with U.N.
orders, issued at the end of the IWI Per
sian (iull War. to destroy all long-range
missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
That condition must be met before IJ.N.
economic sanctions can be lifted.
