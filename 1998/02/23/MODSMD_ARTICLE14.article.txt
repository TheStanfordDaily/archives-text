Museum Endowment Fund
will enhance exposure to
nontraditional art forms

IN THE UPCOMING months,
Stanford students, faculty, staff
and alumni will have the opportu
nity to collaborate in establishing a
resource which will permanently
affirm this community's dedication to
the arts.
A $25 million Museum Endow
ment Campaign will be launched later
this year in anticipation of the Jan
uary 1999 reopening of the Stanford
Art Museum. The museum, soon to
be renamed the Cantor Center for the
Visual Arts, has been closed since the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
The cornerstone of the campaign is
Phyllis Wattis' generous and well
designed $3 million contribution.
Wattis' donation will endow a cura
torship in the arts of Africa, Oceania
and the Americas. The gift also pro
vides badly needed funding for edu
cational resources, exhibitions and
further acquisitions. Wattis' contribu
tion coincides with a gift made by col
lectors Ruth and Marc Franklin of 23
pieces to the museum.
The creation of an endowment of a
permanent curatorship in the art of
Africa, Oceania, and the Americas
should finally give the museum the
resources necessary to focus campus
attention on ethnic, nontraditional art
forms. In addition to improving our
appreciation for art in itself, such gifts
will help us to broaden our under
standing of various cultures and move
people beyond Eurocentric concep

tions of art.
Additionally, the endowment will
be an opportunity for the University
community to disprove the idea that
Stanford has a tenuous commitment
to the arts. II Stanford is to cultivate
the arts and humanities with as much
care as it has cultivated its science and
engineering disciplines, then the Uni
versity must do more than encourage
the development of such programs.
The development of a fund whose
objective is to improve the museum is
precisely the type of effort necessary
to draw and mobilize funding from
arts-minded donors.
Such a commitment to the arts at
Stanford is not a luxury, but a neces
sity. In a campus and world increas
ingly guided by technology, art will
preserve, suggest and remind us of
what it means to be human.
The Wattis and Franklin gifts to the
museum demonstrate that there is
financial support available for pro
grams in the arts. But such support
will not come easily. Hie University
must make a concerted effort to
search for and nurture such aid.
Thomas Seligman, the museum's
director, will continue to play an
important role in advancing such
efforts.
The challenge posed is formidable.
It is a challenge that transcends dol
lars raised, but one which will mea
sure the depth of Stanford's commit
ment to a well-rounded education
and to the future of the humanities. It
is only through such effort that we can
turn one of our school's questionable
weaknesses into an invaluable
strength.
