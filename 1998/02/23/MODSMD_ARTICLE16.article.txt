## End injustice â€” dehouse Greeks 
### 
LET'S SAY THAT
I want to start a
club on campus
a social group for my mate
friends. I explain in my
application to the Univer
sity that members would
pay an annual fee of
$1,000 and would be

selected through informal interviews. 1 pro
pose that we live together in a Row house.
My request would be rejected by the
administration because it is sexist, excludes
people from certain socioeconomic classes
and takes up precious housing on the Row.
Those are legitimate reasons for rejec
tion. So why does the administration make
exceptions for fraternities, which follow the
guidelines in my proposal?
Greeks make rules for membership and
conduct that would not be allowed in other
student groups. Stanford has a long Greek
history, and I don't believe that fraternities
and sororities should be abolished. Hut
Greek groups should not have preferential
access to Stanford funding or support. That
is why I am proposing an end to all Greek
housing.
Stanford claims to fight discrimination
in all its forms. Why should any student
group be given a house, especially since,
with the exception of Sigma Chi, these
houses are owned bv the University? No

other student group would ever be able to
obtain a house under such terms.
Some point to theme houses as being
similar to fraternities. However. diere are
several key differences. To live in a theme
dorm, students must go through the Draw.
But once a student joins a fraternity, he is
guaranteed housing for his entire under
graduate career.
Also, anyone can live in a theme dorm,
regardless of race, class, gender or sexuality.
This cannot be said for housed Greeks,
since their membership does not represent
Stanford's diverse undergraduate popula
tion along racial or class lines. Theme
dorms also have extensive programming
and language or cultural requirements. Fra
ternities, on the other hand, have keg par
tics.
There is also a disparity within the
Greek community. At present there are
many unhoused fraternities, and no housed
sororities. Does this fit with Stanford's
commitment to Title IX and gender equi
ty? Furthermore, none of the Jewish. Asian
or black Greek organizations are housed.
The solution is not to open up more Row
houses for sororities or ethnic fraternities.
All students should go through the Draw
process to obtain on-campus housing.
While I don't agree with everything that
Greek groups represent, I respect their
right to exist and meet on campus. As pri

marily social organizations, fraternities and
sororities add zing to campus social life.
They are even involved in public service.
However, it is unfair thai fraternities have
secured prime housing on a crowded cam
pus, especially given their dwindling mem
bership. alcohol-related incidents, property
defamation and reputations for misogyny
and homophobia.
Last week Kalee Magnani wrote a letter
to The Daily extolling the virtues of Greek
organizations. She claimed that since the
majority of U.S. Presidents and Supreme
Court justices were Greek, fraternities and
sororities must be commendable institu
tions. This argument disregards the fact
that the majority of government leaders are
WASP males. Greek organizations allow
such people to maintain their power
through networks among the elite.
How have fraternities been able to hold
onto their houses despite tarnished reputa
tions? The answers are money and influ
ence. Many alumni pressure the adminis
tration to continue the Greek system.
The injustice of fraternity access to hous
ing is part of the legacy of inequality that I
hope Stanford is trying to end. Eliminating
Greek housing is the only just solution.
