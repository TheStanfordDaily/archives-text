Extending our apologies
On Feb. 21.Theta Xi held its annual Arabian Nights
party. During the preceding week we spread invitations
and fliers across the campus to publicize the event.
On Feb. 20. we were contacted by members of the
Islamic Society of Stanford University, a student group.
At a meeting that night between several fraternity
members ;md representatives from the ISSU, the ISStI
indicated that our fliers were offensive in their depic
tions of the Ayatollah Khomeini, minarets and in the
use of a play on words involving the term "Shi'ite."
ISStJ also indicated that they found the party's theme
offensive.
The Taxi apologizes to ISSU and to anyone offend
ed by our fliers.
The Arabian Nights theme is based on a 14th-centu
ry fairy tale, not on any modern-day stereotypes. Our
fliers were meant in good humor, not as an implication
of anything about Arab or Islamic peoples.
Arabian Nights, an open all-campus party put on for
the enjoyment of the Stanford community, has been a
tradition for over 50 years. We trust that the student
body realizes that Arabian Nights is in no way a repre
sentation of Islamic or Arab peoples. We thank the
ISSU lor bringing this matter to our attention, and we
extend our apologies to those who were offended.

Sexual assault is a big issue
In his Feb. 20 letter. I lias C'hrissochoidis asserts that
sexual assault only happens to a "privileged" minority.
While it may only occur to a minority of students, I find
it appalling to deem this group privileged. Sexual
assault is one of the most traumatic experiences that
anyone can undergo. It can be physically devastating,
possibly causing pregnancy or infection with a sexually
transmitted disease. Moreover, the psychological
effects can be catastrophic.
Mr. C 'hrissochoidis also declares that physique deter
mines who is sexually assaulted. I might remind Mr.
C'hrissochoidis that sexual assault has nothing to do
with physical or sexual attractiveness: it is about power.
It truly can happen to anyone regardless of race, class,
gender, age or physical attractiveness. Furthermore, it
does not just happen to those who are sexually active, as
Mr. C hrissochoidis claims.
After discussing whom he believes sexual assault
affects, Mr. C'hrissochoidis argues against efforts at sex
ual assault awareness. He says that such efforts "create
unrealistic impressions" and "psychologically burden
the majority of students." However, those who try to
increase awareness try to give very accurate impres
sions about the number of people who are assaulted.
They do not try to "psychologically burden" others.
Rather, they try to prevent the overwhelming psycho
logical burden that one experiences when he or she is
sexually assaulted.

In our efforts to increase awareness, we should not
just inform "incoming students about the thin line
between what is acceptable behavior and what is not."
We should inform everyone and often. The more we
discuss the issue the more likely we will decrease the
number of people crossing the thin line.
Finally, no one is asking anyone to "accept collective
responsibility for the acts and attitudes committed and
perpetrated by individuals." 1 only ask that you be
aware that sexual assault does happen, on this campus
and elsewhere. My hope is that this awareness will
make you more careful in situations in which you or
someone else may be crossing a line. Maybe then sexu
al assault will affect a much smaller minority.

Ignorance promotes rape
The fact that "most students don't date," as Mr,
Chrissochoidis says, doesn't preclude the possibility of
sexual assault or rape. Moreover. Stanford's supposed
antisocial nature by no means serves to lessen the threat
of unwanted sexual advances.
Perhaps the abnormally low dating frequency at
Stanford contributes to off-kilter perspectives regarding
sexual assault. Physically attractive people are not the
only victims. Rape is also composed of power relations
that focus on the mechanics of vulnerability.
You are trulv confused if you believe that you belong

to some sort of under-sexed, under privileged and over
wrought "majority." If you had read Ms. Hammond's
article in Wednesday's Daily with the least hit of critical
attention, you would have realized that campus assaults
seem rare because so many of them go unreported. The
resulting official reports are only a fraction of the actu
al volume of sexual violations. Hie only "unrealistic
impressions" are those left by women and men who
retain their anonymity 111 the face of a silence that this
insular community promotes.
It is easier to pretend that there is nothing wrong or
to refuse to believe that a problem exists. I commend
last weeks' contributors for providing statistics and
information on date rape and sexual assault. No one
asked you to take responsibility wholly upon yourself,
but your ignorance and lack of compassion is hardly
constructive. You say that you "respect the experiences
of the victims." but I find this hard to believe as you
assert that their situations are and were fictitious. Per
haps your luck in love has more to do with your emo
tional capabilities rather than your external attributes.
