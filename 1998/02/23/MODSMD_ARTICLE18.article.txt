Thank goodness for e-mail
the medium of communication for a
new generation. This revolutionary
technology has sent interpersonal interac
tions into a safer and more cushioned realm.
It has eliminated the need for verbal com
munication. first there was voice mail, allow
ing people to wimp out of confrontations bv
planning phone calls when they were sure
the other party was out.
"Sorry I missed you. but I wanted to let
you know that I'll no longer be able to
accompany you to the Viennese Ball. Hope
the dress is returnable." But the invention of
e-mail has taken avoiding speaking to some
one one step further.
Countless telephone conversations, awk
ward silences and uncomfortable moments
have been done away with through the won
ders of modern technology. It is perfect for
the busy, the impatient, the short-tempered,
the shy. the conflict averse, the Mr. Short-
Term Memory and the anally efficient.
No longer is there a need to suffer
through painful conversations in which yet

another person is talking about his problems,
.lust ask the person to send an e-mail.
Mankind need never speak again.
Meet a cute guy/girl at a party? "What's
your e-mail address?" has replaced "What's
yo' seven. I mean live, digits?" Stalking has
jumped into the modern age with Wluris.
Plug into Whois and find out the major, num
ber, dorm and last login time of your poten
tial love. Whip out a quick e-mail for a casu
al "Was really nice meeting you ... Wanna
go to Flicks?" message and wait for a reply.
No need for embarrassing chit-chat or
uncomfortable pauses. lake the time neces
sary to ponder, delete and rewrite that "casu
al" message.
Receiving a date e-mail is just as conve
nient. An interested recipient can scream,
jump around and swoon without worrying
about scaring away the potential suitor. Dis
seminating the good news takes the spread
ing of gossip to a new level — it reduces five
excited phone calls to a mere "forward" and
the name of the appropriate mailing list.
Three hours saved. Consultation on the per

feet not-too-desperate, vel still appropriately
llirty reply becomes a bree/e as well.
Or perhaps the thought of spending time
with this person ranks up there with waiting
in the Bursar's Office line the day before
classes start — casually drop in the word
"boyfriend." "gay" or "therapist" and sit
back and relax.. I);iting at Stanford never
seemed so easy.
And how about when the relationship
hurdle has been crossed'.' When engaged in a
relationship, ultra-busy significant others can
tell each other they care with a cute little
"thinking of you :)" messages. Instead of a
potentially king and sappy phone call, substi
tute a 30-second "quickie" from a library
search terminal at Green. Emotional entan
glements can be so unproductive.
Then there are the situations in which
conflict aversion and a long-standing prob
lem unite for a festering "You've been
neglecting me /1 hate it when you chew with
your mouth open / I'm in love with my CIV
I A" e-mail explosion. Rather than a messy
emotional exchange, the couple/friends can

simply y-talk and avoid the embarrassing
memories of acting as if they cared.
Scheduling conflicts no longer impede
interpersonal relationships. Cione is waiting
to speak to a person during business hours,
office hours or catching him or her at home.
Voice mail sent at 2 a.m. is a bit bizarre, but
an e-mail is entirely appropriate.
As with most Stanford students, being
exceedingly busy tends to go hand in hand
with occasionally forgetting things. No prob
lem. A good memory is a thing of the past
with the wonders of electronic mail. Infor
mation can be stored for eons in boxes and
retrieved w hen reminiscing, searching for the
definition of "opportunity cost" or figuring
out when that date was scheduled for.
Although not legally binding, promises
can be documented and classroom assign
ments can be confirmed. E-mail also pro
vides the perfect medium for conducting
interviews. Instead of learning shorthand, e
mail replies can easily be cut and pasted for
simple, mistake-free quoting.
Yes. e-mail will soon be the preferred

means of communication of every man
woman and child in the world.
