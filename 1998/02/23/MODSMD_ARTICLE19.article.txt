■ Saturday: Stanford 182, California 83

Four deGuerre Pool records fell in the 55-
degree temperature and constant rain. Senior
captain Tom Wilkens broke his own pool
records in the 200-yard breaststroke (1:58.2)
and 400-yard individual medley (3:48.99) and
added a 2(X) IM victory to sweep his events. Se
nior Sabir Muhammad broke American
record-holder Pablo Morales' pool record in
the 1(H) butterfly (47.97). and junior Dod Wales
was also under the old mark with a 48.08. Junior
Tate Blahnik broke American record-holder
Brian Retterer's pool record in the 2(X) back
stroke (1:44.0).
Last year's first- and third-place teams in the
NCAA. Auburn and Georgia, respectively,
also swam this weekend in the Southeastern
Conference Championship. While the SEC
sent a message last year with an amazingly fast
conference meet, the message this year was dif
ferent. Stanford's dual-meet times Saturday
were far more impressive than the SEC results.
"I! we swim at this level at NCAAs. we will
control the meet," said assistant coach Ted
Knapp.
Stanford swam well in each event.

Stanford easily won the 200 medley relay to
open the meet. The Cardinal's time was a sea
son best and one of the top three times turned
in this year. This is impressive because Stanford
is one of few teams not to have shaved yet this
year. Stanford's Band C relays battled Cal's A
in a very close race for second. Stanford B out
touched the others but was disqualified.

year's runner-up to Wilkens at Nt'A As).
1,650 freestyle: Jeremy Kane (S) 15:19.06,
Matt O'Mara (S) 15:23.11. Stanford only put up
two swimmers in this event. Cal's top finisher

Messner, a freshman, took the lead with a 46-

MEN'S SWIMMING
■ Saturday: Stanford 182, California 83

Four deGuerre Pool records fell in the 55-
degree temperature and constant rain. Senior
captain Tom Wilkens broke his own pool
records in the 200-yard breaststroke (1:58.2)
and 400-yard individual medley (3:48.99) and
added a 2(X) IM victory to sweep his events. Se
nior Sabir Muhammad broke American
record-holder Pablo Morales' pool record in
the 1(H) butterfly (47.97). and junior Dod Wales
was also under the old mark with a 48.08. Junior
Tate Blahnik broke American record-holder

stroke (1:44.0).
Last year's first- and third-place teams in the
NCAA. Auburn and Georgia, respectively,
also swam this weekend in the Southeastern
Conference Championship. While the SEC
sent a message last year with an amazingly fast
conference meet, the message this year was dif
ferent. Stanford's dual-meet times Saturday
were far more impressive than the SEC results.
"I! we swim at this level at NCAAs. we will
control the meet," said assistant coach Ted
Knapp.
Stanford swam well in each event.

2(K> medley relay: Stanford A 1:28.75, (al A
1:30.25. Stanford C 1:30.84, Stanford B DO
Stanford easily won the 200 medley relay to
open the meet. The Cardinal's time was a sea
son best and one of the top three times turned
in this year. This is impressive because Stanford
is one of few teams not to have shaved yet this
year. Stanford's Band C relays battled Cal's A
in a very close race for second. Stanford B out
touched the others but was disqualified.

year's runner-up to Wilkens at Nt'A As).
1,650 freestyle: Jeremy Kane (S) 15:19.06,
Matt O'Mara (S) 15:23.11. Stanford only put up
two swimmers in this event. Cal's top finisher
was almost a minute behind. Kane's time
should qualify for NCAAs.

Messner, a freshman, took the lead with a 46-
second mark for the first I(K). but Wales came
on strong at the end to get the victory. Sopho
mores Counts and Neebe had season bests, and
Neebe's swim was an unshaved best.

48.63, Dan Schultz (S) 4<5.71. Justin Ewers (S)
4K.78. Stanford took the top four spots in a very
exciting race. Four swimmers under 49 seconds
is an amazing accomplishment. If they swim
this wav at NCAAs, all four could final.
