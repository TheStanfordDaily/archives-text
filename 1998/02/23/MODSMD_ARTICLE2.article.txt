# Pub board role focus of debate
## 
### James Pritchard Contributing writer 
A hill intended to rectify a clerical error in the re
cently revised ASSII Bylaws rekindled an old debate in
the last ASSU Senate meeting.
The hill called for a reinstatement of a paragraph in
the hylaws that allows the Publications Board to stop
the on-campus distribution of non-University affiliated
publications such as the "Guide to the Good Life."
The paragraph, omitted when the bylaws were
changed earlier this year, states that nonboard members
must seek board approval before distributing their pub
lications on campus if the Stanford or ASSU name is
used or if the publication "contains advertising solicited
on the basis of its campus distribution "
The board is a division of the ASSU that allocates
funds to various publications such as the Stanford Di
rectory and the Chaparral.
The board's general policy is to match the funding
that the individual publications receive from outside
sources, current board director Andrew Taylor said.
The bill narrowly passed at the end of the Feb. 10
meeting, with ASSU Vice President Ben Decker casting
the deciding vote.
Decker said debate over the bill was misplaced. The
bylaw omission "was a clerical oversight," he said. "If
[the paragraph] is going to be removed, there should be
a vote to remove it."
The senate debate centered around off-campus pub
lications, such as the "Guide to the Good Life," which
are in direct competition with campus publications. The
guide uses the Stanford name without the board's ap
proval.
When the issue was raised earlier this year, the Stan
ford Directory was one of the primary advocates for tak
ing action against the guide, junior Santos Marroquin
said. Marroquin, an ASSI J senator, is one of the authors
of last week's bill.
Stanford publications such as the Directory are in
competition with outside-sponsored publications for
advertising dollars.
" 'GtxxJ Life' uses a lot of deception as a supposed
Stanford publication." Marroquin said. "Not true. Stan
ford University docs not see a dime."
