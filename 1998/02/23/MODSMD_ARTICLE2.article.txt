# Pub board role focus of debate
## 
### James Pritchard Contributing writer 
A hill intended to rectify a clerical error in the re
cently revised ASSII Bylaws rekindled an old debate in
the last ASSU Senate meeting.
The hill called for a reinstatement of a paragraph in
the hylaws that allows the Publications Board to stop
the on-campus distribution of non-University affiliated
publications such as the "Guide to the Good Life."
The paragraph, omitted when the bylaws were
changed earlier this year, states that nonboard members
must seek board approval before distributing their pub
lications on campus if the Stanford or ASSU name is
used or if the publication "contains advertising solicited
on the basis of its campus distribution "
The board is a division of the ASSU that allocates
funds to various publications such as the Stanford Di
rectory and the Chaparral.
The board's general policy is to match the funding
that the individual publications receive from outside
sources, current board director Andrew Taylor said.
The bill narrowly passed at the end of the Feb. 10
meeting, with ASSU Vice President Ben Decker casting
the deciding vote.
Decker said debate over the bill was misplaced. The
bylaw omission "was a clerical oversight," he said. "If
[the paragraph] is going to be removed, there should be
a vote to remove it."
The senate debate centered around off-campus pub
lications, such as the "Guide to the Good Life," which
are in direct competition with campus publications. The
guide uses the Stanford name without the board's ap
proval.
When the issue was raised earlier this year, the Stan
ford Directory was one of the primary advocates for tak
ing action against the guide, junior Santos Marroquin
said. Marroquin, an ASSI J senator, is one of the authors
of last week's bill.
Stanford publications such as the Directory are in
competition with outside-sponsored publications for
advertising dollars.
" 'GtxxJ Life' uses a lot of deception as a supposed
Stanford publication." Marroquin said. "Not true. Stan
ford University docs not see a dime."
Peter Massik, Class of '92. who publishes the guide
from an office in San Francisco, sees
the bylaw as an attempt by the Di
rectory to steal advertising revenue.
"I guess this is just a continuing
example of the corrupting influence
of the Directory on Stanford," he
said. "The 'Good Life' is a nice thing
to happen to Stanford students ...
because nobody pays for it. We
make a little money doing it, but it's
a win-win situation."
Directory Projects Manager
Matt Garlinghouse, a senior, said
his publication is not out to get the

guide. "We harbor no ill will toward
them," he said.
Another problem with the bill
expressed in debate was the en
forcement of the actual board
bylaw. The bylaw states that an or
ganization needs board approval in
order to distribute on campus, but
currently no action is being taken to
stop off-campus publications.
"I think this [provision] has
never been enforced," Taylor said.
The board bylaw complements a
University law that is also not en
forced, Marroquin said. He also
questioned the board's ability to en
force the law.
"According to the letter of the

law, [the board] would have the
power," Marroquin said. "Accord
ing to the spirit in which the bill was
passed, they would not."
Marroquin hopes the bonrd will
rewrite the provision before the end
of this year to clarify its meaning
and intent.
Although the debate on the bill to
replace the omitted paragraph did
point out sensitive issues, Taylor em
phasized that the bill was only in
tended to correct the printed bylaws.
"Everyone I've talked to seemed
to think it was a clerical error." Tay
lor said.
In order to become a member of
the board, a publication must first

be approved by the Office of Stu
dent Activities. Then, the board's
director appoints the publication to
the board. The ASSIJ or the board
can overturn this decision upon re
view.
However, Stanford publications
are not required to be board mem
bers, Taylor said.
The board itself is working to
build up its resources. A separate
bill was passed last week to allocate
funds for $2.(XX) worth of computer
equipment.
Taylor said, "[The board) is in a
sorry state of affairs. I have been
working to change it to improve the
quality of life."
