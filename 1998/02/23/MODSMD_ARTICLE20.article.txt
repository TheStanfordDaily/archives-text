■ Saturday: Stanford 72. Washing
ton State 56

The No. 10 Cardinal (23-3,12-2
Pacific 10 Conference) had an
easy and unemotional night as it
took care of Washington State be
fore a sellout crowd Saturday at
Maples Pavilion.
The Cougars (9-17, 2-13)
stayed within 10 points of the

Cardinal for most of the second
half but never really made it a
game as Stanford cruised to a 72-

Sophomore guard Ryan
Mendez led the Cardinal with 15
points, giving his team a lift it
seemed to need desperately.
Mendez scored all of his points on
his 5-for-7 shooting performance
from behind the three-point line.
He also played a career-high 2b
minutes.
"Sometimes you come in for a
few minutes, you're not really
ready to take the shot. You've just
got to get in the flow of the game,
and 1 think that's what I did well
tonight." Mendez said. "I never
reallv forced that many shots, and

I just got it off the offense and . ..
off open looks.
"I think it's important for our
bench players to plav well each
and every night. We have to give
them a lift."
The Cardinal led by as much as
IS in the first half and went into
halftime with a 36-26 lead. How
ever. it couldn't close the door on
the Cougars in the second half.
Stanford shot only 29 percent
in the period, but Washington
State's 27-percent performance
from the field kept it from making
any serious run at a victory.
"We seemed to lack emotion
from the get-go," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "I have to
take some of the responsibility. I

sensed the same thing. I wasn't
ready to play either.
"But we pot a great lift off the
bench. [Mendez] came in and
that's where this pays off because
those kids are hungry."
Montgomery used his bench
generously throughout the game,
as sophomore power forward
Mark Madsen was the only starter
with more than 30 minutes.
One glaring spot in Mont
gomery's game plan was the use of
junior point guard Arthur Lee for
the entire second half. Freshman
reserve Mike McDonald had
played well in place of Lee during
the first period, racking up five as
sists in only 11 minutes.
"I was trying to get Art going a
little bit," Montgomery said. "I
sure could have [played McDon
ald] — probably made a mistake
there. Arl was doing a little bit bet
ter job in the second half so 1 left
him in. I probably should have
gone back with Mike. Mike did a
real good job."
Madsen also provided a bright
spot on a slow night. With junior
center Tim Young getting manhan
dled by his defenders and ignored
by the referees, the power forward
stepped up.
Madsen had his most tenacious
performance at both ends of the
court since coming back from a
foot injury three weeks ago. He
garnered 13 points and seven re
bounds while holding Cougar for
ward Carlos Daniel to eight points
and eight boards.
The last time the Cardinal met
the Cougars, Madsen was still side
lined. and Daniel burned the Car
dinal for 26 points and a career

high 16 rebounds.
"1 think it was one of my more
aggressive offensive performances
since the injury," Madsen said. "I
missed some shots, but at least 1
was aggressive.
"It's not the foot, it's not condi
tioning. It's just me getting mental
ly tougher."
The Cardinal can now gear up
for its trip to Arizona, where it will
face the only two conference oppo
nents that it has lost to this year.
With only four games left, the
Cardinal is poised to earn a No. 2
seed in the tournament, most likely
in the East Region.
But Montgomery isn't letting
his team forget that it is still in the
hunt for the Pac-10 title.
With two weeks left in the sea
son, Stanford is two games behind
Arizona and will meet the No. 3
Wildcats Saturday. If the Cardinal
can stay undefeated lor the rest of
the year and Arizona slips up
against another opponent, the
two teams will share the champi
onship.
And more importantly, the Car
dinal will make a claim to be the
No. 1 team in the West Region.
