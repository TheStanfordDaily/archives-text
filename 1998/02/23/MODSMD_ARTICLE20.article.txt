â–  Saturday: Stanford 72. Washing
ton State 56

The No. 10 Cardinal (23-3,12-2
Pacific 10 Conference) had an
easy and unemotional night as it
took care of Washington State be
fore a sellout crowd Saturday at
Maples Pavilion.
The Cougars (9-17, 2-13)
stayed within 10 points of the

Cardinal for most of the second
half but never really made it a
game as Stanford cruised to a 72-

Sophomore guard Ryan
Mendez led the Cardinal with 15
points, giving his team a lift it
seemed to need desperately.
Mendez scored all of his points on
his 5-for-7 shooting performance
from behind the three-point line.
He also played a career-high 2b
minutes.
"Sometimes you come in for a
few minutes, you're not really
ready to take the shot. You've just

and 1 think that's what I did well
tonight." Mendez said. "I never
reallv forced that many shots, and

I just got it off the offense and . ..
off open looks.
"I think it's important for our
bench players to plav well each

them a lift."
The Cardinal led by as much as
IS in the first half and went into
halftime with a 36-26 lead. How

the Cougars in the second half.
Stanford shot only 29 percent
in the period, but Washington
State's 27-percent performance
from the field kept it from making
any serious run at a victory.
"We seemed to lack emotion
from the get-go," said head coach
Mike Montgomery. "I have to
take some of the responsibility. I

sensed the same thing. I wasn't
ready to play either.
"But we pot a great lift off the
bench. [Mendez] came in and
that's where this pays off because
those kids are hungry."
Montgomery used his bench
generously throughout the game,
as sophomore power forward
Mark Madsen was the only starter
with more than 30 minutes.
One glaring spot in Mont
gomery's game plan was the use of
junior point guard Arthur Lee for
the entire second half. Freshman
reserve Mike McDonald had
played well in place of Lee during
the first period, racking up five as
