Ryan Mendez knew he was hot.
()nly a few minutes after coming off the bench Sat
urday. Mendez had shot the hall four times and al
ready had 12 points. Stanford led by 16 points, and
Mendez knew he could ice the game with two minutes
to go in the first half.
He got the screen. He got the pass. The crowd
stood up and began to cheer. Then the unexpected
happened.
Mendez missed.
The play was one of the sophomore guard's few
mistakes as he led all scorers with 15 points, helping
Stanford to a 72-56 home victory over Washington
State.
"A lot of it is just getting into the rhythm of the
game." Mendez said afterward.
Fans seemed more surprised by Mendez's miss
than by Washington State forward Kojo Mensah-
Bonsu's mooning of the Sixth Man Club, because
Mendez was everywhere.
When all was said and done, Mendez was the lone
highlight of the game, in which Stanford scored more
than a third of its points from the stripe.
"It wasn't a pretty sight, but we got the 'W.' " he
said.
Mendez' three-pointer in the second half provided
three of just 15 points the ( ardinal would score while
the clock was running. Without the free-throw line
and Mendez. the Cardinal scored only 32 points for
the game.
"Ryan can shoot it." said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "You have to guard Ryan He's not
afraid and d<K*s not lose his confidence it he misses.

In addition to his scoring, Mendez
had five defensive rebounds and two
steals, matching team highs in his best
all-around conference game.
The boards and steals did not fully
reflect his performance, however.

During his career-high 26 minutes of
playing time, Mendez was diving
everywhere for rebounds and almost
added a couple more steals.
From the shadow of the Cardinal's
performance, Mendez knew it was
important for the bench to stand out.
"It's important for our bench play
ers to play well each and every time,"
he said.

Montgomery admitted after game
that he and the Cardinal players
weren't 1 (K) percent ready to play and
lacked the emotion it showed against
previous opponents, hut he credited
Mendez with getting the Cardinal
blood circulating.
Besides Mendez. no other Cardi
nal player scored more than six points
from the field.
