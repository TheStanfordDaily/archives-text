PULLMAN. Wash — Twenty
minutes before game time Saturda\
afternoon, the casual observer
could glance quickly around Friel
Court and easily count the number
of fans present to watch the Wash
ington State women's basketball
team (11-13,5-10 Pacific 10Confer
ence ) take on fifth-ranked Stanford
(17-5. 13-1).

That should have been the first
omen for the Cougars, who have
never beaten Stanford.
By the time attendance was
counted, a season-high (a fair
percentage of which were cheering
for Stanford) had made their wa\ to

the arena on senior day. But that
wasn't nearly enough support for
the outmatched Cougars, who fell to
Stanford
In fact, it probabh felt more like
home for Stanford locals Heather
Owen and Regan Freuen than the
four Cougar seniors. Owen, a senior
center from Moscow. Idaho, abused
the Cougars inside for a game-high
17 points to go with seven rebounds.
And Freuen. a junior guard from
Spokane. Wash., was deadly from
behind the arc. scorching the
Cougars for nine first-half points
and adding three more on her only
attempt in the second.
"I thought this was a really nice
homecoming tor Kith Regan and
Heather," said coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "They've both been very
integral parts of our team's success."
Realit) didn't set in for Washing
ton State immediatelv. In fact the
Cougars even staked a 6-3 lead three
minutes into the game on a jumper
from senior center Yvonne Kunze,
hut that's when the bleeding began.
The Washington State press,
which was somewhat effective over
the first few minutes, became a tool
for Stanford's transition game. With
13 minutes, 57 seconds to go in the
half, sophomore point guard Milena
Flores weaved through the defense
and hit senior forward Vanessa Nv
gaard for an open three.
A Washington State turnover
and another Cardinal basket later,
Flores was guiding the transition
again, this time she pulled up from
about 10 feet out for an easy jumper
to cap a 14-0 Stanford run that

j<> nrjili iiii AiuH uJ / i
stretched the scort;,^.l,7-6.
"If there was a surprise it was Flo
res' threes," said veteran Washing
ton State head coach Harold
Rhodes. "Those were big. and they
came at a time when they were
putting a run together."
When Flores found Freuen for
Stanford's sixth three-pointer of
the half at the 7:54 mark, Rhodes
called his third timeout and merci
fully (for the Cougars) called off
the press.
"They were doubling in on our
post players and leaving me pretty
open on the three-point shot so I
tried to get it going," Freuen said. "I
hit a few in the first half so they had
to extend the defense out a little hit."
But Stanford continued to pour
in the baskets. When the teams
headed into the locker rooms at the
half, the Card was up 57-36, and

ji l ' moc jA,i <noi !«;•'•" <
Stanford'?, two £fi?ffers, for
wards Olympia Scott and Kristin
Folkl had a combined four points.
"We've had this happen all year
where maybe someone doesn't play
very well and someone else steps
up." VanDerveer said. " I'm really
happv that Heather stepped up for
us in this game, not just because she
was playing at home, but that's what
we need her to do."
Stanford's 57 points in the first
half represented its most prolific
scoring performance of the year, and
its eight three-pointers tied the
school record for treys in a half.
From there on the Card cruised.
Stanford placed four in double
figures, with Owen's 17 leading the
way. Flores added 15 to go along
with eight assists and just one
turnover, and Nygaard and Freuen
scored 13 and 12 points, respectively.
