The Cardinal (13-0-1, 3-0 Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division)
scored 54 runs in the three games at
Jackie Robinson Stadium, the nu>st
ever bv Stanford in a conference se
ries and more than enough to em
barrass the defending Midwest Re
gional champion Bruins (7-7,2-3).
"We got some timely hitting."
said head coach Mark Marquess.
The Bruins are "going to be a
solid ttam I am glad that we
played them now. this early."

Stanford's 13-9 victory last night
was the closest in the three-game se
ries. with the two teams locked in a
f>-t tie from the third inning until the
seventh.
"They weren't going to give up
They never do." said senior short
stop Ja\ Pecci. who went 5 for 5 on
the day. hatting in three runs. "It
must have been very frustrating for
them. They are definitely a threat,
so to sweep them is a big deal."
Freshman piteher Justin Wayne
(2-0) came in to relieve junior
starter Brent Hoard in the third in
ning and ended up with the win.
Wayne was able to quiet the Bruins,
allowing five hits in five innings
With Bruin freshman and Palo
Alto High alumnus Jon Brandt (1 -2)
on the mound, the Bruins shut down
Stanford's scoring machine for sev
eral innings With the seventh in
ning. however, came the return of
the Cardinal's offense.
Freshman designated hitter Joe
Borehard. 3 for 5 on the dav. hit a
two-run tie-breaking double, and
there was no looking back.
On Saturday the offense was
even more powerful. Junior Chad
Hutchinson (3-0) gave up two
earned runs in the afternoon game
and still felt he did not pitch as well
as he could have. His offense, how
ever. turned it on to support him in
the Cardinal's 23-4 victory. You'd
think it was Hutchinson's birthday.
Actually, it was.
With the pitcher's family on
hand, the Cardinal's scored the most
runs in a game since a I WS meeting
with Nevada, had eight of its nine
starters get a hit. batted through the
round in three different innings, and
crushed the Bruins. All these
seemed reasons for the newly turned
21-year-old to go out and celebrate
in Southern California. Marquess,
however, had a different idea.
"He can have a milkshake and go

to bed early," Marquess said.
Actually, Hutchinson didn't
seem to have a problem with that.
"I'll wait until I have my own time."
he said. "It's fun to get a win on my
birthday. Our offense is rolling right
now. [which] is kind of nice. It was a
great team effort."
Hutchinson wasn't the only Car
dinal shining in front of his family,
l.ong Beach native Edmund Muth
certainly did more than his share to
contribute to the offensive effort.
The sophomore left fielder was the
first Cardinal to hit for the cycle
since Steve Solomon against Califor
nia in IW2. Muth. who went 4 for 6 at
the plate, had 4 RBIs and a two-run
homer.
"I just felt better at the plate,"
Muth said. "We had worked on a
couple of things. I had much better
balance at the plate. That's a crucial
thing."
Muth. along with the rest of the
Cardinal crew, seemed to be teach
ing the Bruins just what a powerful
offense looks like. Junior center

fielder Jodv Gerut cracked his team
leading sixth home run of the season,
and sophomore first baseman John
Gall went 4 for 5 with three RBls.
"It got out of hand." said Mar
quess. whose Cardinal outscored the
Bruins 15-0 in the final five innings.
UCLA is "very talented, (but) they
are very young."
Friday's game saw Stanford stroll
to an IH-ft victory behind the pitch
ing of junior Jeff Austin (4-0). who
went eight innings and allowed one
earned run. striking out 11.
Like Hutchinson. Austin was
supported by a powerful offense.
With Stanford scoring in seven of the
game's nine innings, the Cardinal
was led by Gall, who went 4 for 5
with lour RBls.
Trailing 5-4 after four innings.
Stanford had a powerful comeback
in the filth inning. With both Gerut
and Peeci cracking home runs in the
inning, and Austin shutting out the
Bruins in the next four innings, the
Cardinal outscored UCLA 14-1 the
rest of the wav.
