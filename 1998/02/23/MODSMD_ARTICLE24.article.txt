## 
### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
Discussing issues such as the rights
of farm workers, human rights viola
tions in Burma and the struggles of in
digenous people, 50 students gath
ered this weekend at Stanford to par
ticipate in the annual statewide envi
ronmental justice conference.
Sponsored by Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford, the
conference took place on Saturday
and Sunday and included students
from seven California schools.
Speakers were brought in from all
parts of the state and the campus to
discuss environmental justice with
the group.
The goal of the conference, ac
cording to SEAS member and orga
nizer Jill Shenker, was threefold —
education on various environmental
justice issues, networking between
students of various colleges and

building grassroots organizational
skills for effective action.
The environmental justice move
ment focuses on the inequality of en
vironmental protection for poor and
minority groups in the nation. The
movement, as explained by author
Robert Bullard, is one which de
mands attention for minority and im
poverished communities.
"Whether by conscious design or
institutional neglect, communities of
color in urban ghettos, in rural
'poverty pockets,' or on economical
ly impoverished Native American
reservations face some of the worst
environmental devastation in the na
tion," Bullard said in an article titled
"Anatomy of Environmental Racism
and the Environmental Justice
Movement."
"It has thus been an uphill battle
convincing white judges, juries, gov
ernment officials and policymakers
that racism exists in environmental

protection, enforcement and policy
formulation,"
Included as guest speakers were
representatives from the IJjima Secu
rity Council of East Palo Alto, Unit
ed Farm Workers, the Nuxalk Nation
Government and organizers from the
Santa Clara Center for Occupational
Safety and Health. All presented is
sues of environmental justice and ad
dressed how California students
could help to create effective change.
'Whenever any student group de
cides that a stx'ial issue is urgent
enough to organize around, it's our
responsibility to work with them be
cause environmental justice issues
are so crucial," said Keisha Evans of
the security council.
Evans works to educate the com
munity on environmental issues and
create protection from hazards. At
present, a hazardous waste recycling
plant lies within East Palo Alto, and
two cement factories are scheduled to

he constructed in the eitv. Ujima's ef
forts have prevented one of the plants
from being built — the other case is
still within the legal system.
"I hope the conference brings
about higher awareness of environ
mental justice and all the different
facets of the movement," said Mike
tialotti, a senior at the University of
Redlands.
Balotti and another student, Ron
Manley, teach a class on environmen
tal justice at university. They traveled
from Southern California to attend
the conference in order to "establish
the necessary network# tgid to

"I learned a lot of new things
today; it's been empowering," said
UC-Santa Barbara freshman Lind
sey Jacobs. "It's also nice to meet
people of similar interest. Hopefully
the conference will establish a con
nection between area schools."
