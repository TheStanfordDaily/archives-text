## L.A. volunteers bring youth to campus 
### Joann Liao Contributing writer 
The graduation rate at Gregorio
Estrada's East Los Angeles high
school is under 20 percent. Most of
the students never leave Los Ange
les. but Estrada has plans to change
that.
Pooling financial resources with
two of his friends, he founded the
College Expedition Program. The
program exposes high school stu
dents to three Bay Area universi
ties — Stanford, UC-Berkeley and
UC-Davis.
"Back in high school, a group of
us always talked about how we
shouldn't let success shadow where
we came from," said Estrada, Class
of '%. "That's where we got the
idea."
The purpose of the week-long
program is to give students from
Woodrow Wilson High School in
East Los Angeles a firsthand look
at college life and encourage them
to see it as a viable option.

Interested students complete an
application similar to an actual col
lege application.
Estrada, Jose Luis Espinoza and
William Sanchez, all sophomores
at Stanford, UC-Berkeley and UC-
Davis, respectively, wanted to
make the experience as realistic as
possible.
"The program has many goals,"
Espinoza said.
"Apart from promoting higher
education among inner city high
school students, the program will
hopefully show its participants that
there is a lot more for them to ex
perience by attending a university
in another town."
Estrada and his friends chose
the Bay Area to provide a different
perspective for the students.
"We wanted to get students out
of L A. It's so easy to be trapped
there," Estrada said.
"We want them to see possibili
ties that they might never have con
sidered. It's typical that people will
grow up there and never leave."

The Los Angeles that Estrada
speaks of is a long way from Bever
ly Hills.
His high school, he said, was
overwhelmingly Chicano / Latino
and poor.
"Most are direct descendants of
immigrants," Estrada explained.
"It's a very first-generation type
of setting where the parents are
working minimum wage jobs to get
by. The majority live in poverty."
According to Estrada, many of
the immigrant parents do not un
derstand the American education
system or its concept of higher
learning.
Others, however, like his own
parents, strongly believe that their
children improve their situation
only through education.
"My parents drove me toward
going beyond high school because
they wanted something better for
me.
"When they came to this coun
try, they realized that you need ed
ucation to get somewhere." Estra

da said.
"My dad — the farthest he got
was fourth grade. The farthest my
mom went was sixth grade.
"Many parents came from coun
tries where they never completed
high school."
Estrada, Espinoza and Sanchez
believe that more people from
their high school could and should
go to college.
They believe it so strongly that
they currently fund the entire pro
gram by their own means, having
saved money over the last two
years.
"The biggest difficulty is financ
ing the project. My friends and I
have been saving money and mini
mizing our personal expenses in
order to finance the program," Es
pinoza said.
Unfortunately, their meager
funds only enable them to bring up
two students this first year.
In the future, they hope to find
other sources of funding in order to
expand the program.
