halfcourt and drove to the cage to challenge and
beat Davis goalie Molly Morris one on one. After

the restart and shot another ball past Morris.
The unstoppable Estes, nicknamed The El
lenator by her teammates, also scored on a shot
out of the hole in the fourth quarter, despite the
fact that Davis was dropping on the two-meter
position throughout the game.
"I didn't get the ball much because they were

running a drop.'' Estes said. "Hut we defeated the
drop weil. We were able to figure out how to out
play it."
The Stanford defense, led by junior goalie-
Heather C'rary, held Davis to one goal in each of
the first three quarters and managed to shut them
out in the last quarter.
