# Card out-tumbled
## Men not discouraged by loss 
### Bill Hanson 
Saturday night's men's gymnas
tics meet featured too many bois
terous Bear fans and too few ( ardi
nal supporters. It wouldn't be sur
prising if the Stanford men were a
little disheartened by the lmbal
anced audience, considering Cali
fornia fans had to trek all the way
over to Burnham Pavilion.

MEN S GYMNASTICS
â–  Saturday: ('alifornia 226.65, Stan
ford 212.35

"It's a little discouraging that
they have more fans than we do."
said junior co-captain Jeremy Her
man. struggling with an injury.
Not only were the Cal fans loud,
the Berkeley team members were
vocally supportive of each other,
cheering wildly as the Bears won
the meet 226.65-212.35. The Cardi
nal. however, tried to ignore the
Bear antics.
"We try and have as much spirit
as we can. but it's hard when we
only have six guys." said freshman
Jason Bill/. "Compared to Berke
ley. there's so many guys; they're
bound to have more unity. We sup
port each other as much as v\e can.
We're just not loud."
The size of Cal's team gives the
defending national
other advantages as well. Six gvm
nasts may compete in each event
and the top four scores count. A*
Stanford now only features sever
active gymnasts, there is little roon
for error. Almost every gymnas
has to tackle every event. Berke
ley's large squad allows for indi\ id
ual gymnasts to specialize in specif
ic events. In addition. Cal is alway
guaranteed six gymnasts for eacl
event, thus insuring the top foui
scores will be solid.
Although Cal dominated the
Stanford men with consistent, pre

cise routines, the Card showed
signs of life, exploring new tricks
and turning in the occasional top
notch performance.
"We looked better (than in the
last meet]. We were cleaner, but
still (had] too many falls," said
sophomore Craig Nesbitt. who is
battling back from a back injury.
"Mentally, the team is in much bet
ter shape. We stayed positive."
While Stanford trailed the Bears
by more than 14 points, the Cardi
nal's score of 212.35 fails to reflect
the improvement made by the gym
nasts over the past few weeks.
"This was a huge improvement
over two weeks ago." Herman said.
Head coach Sadao Hamada was
impressed by the notable improve
ment of freshmen Blitz and Rico
Andrade. He added that sopho
mores Nesbitt and Jason katsam
pes turned in excellent all-around
performances. Nesbitt's 9.5 on the
high bar. coupled with katsampes'
9.6 and 9.55 on the parallel bars and
high bar. respectively, were high
lights of the evening.
"Team unity and team spirit is
high." Nesbitt said. "This year
we've got the mental, but right
now. because of the injuries, we're
just a little bit down physically."
The gymnasts feel they are on
track toward a solid, if not spectac
ular. season.
"We peak toward the end of the
season, so each meet, as long as we
gradually get a little bit better
we're fine." Herman said.
Hamada shared the gymnasts
opinions.
"We're not |ust gonna work
we're gonna work hard." Hamad;
said. "Hopefully, we can qualih
for the NCAAs. But if we can't,
know it's going to be all good foi
the next few years or so. We're im
proving so much. I'm going to con
centrate on making it to the
NCAAs this year."
