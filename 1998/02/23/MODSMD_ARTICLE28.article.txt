WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Friday:Stanford 193.45,California 190.675

Harding nailed her bar routine and received a score
of 9.825, a career high. She then hit even pass on her
floor routine, including one that was added this week in
practice, while keeping the audience captive with her
dramatic routine. The performance w as good enough to
garner a 9.925. also a career high. The crowd disagreed,
and shouts of "10, 10, 10" resonated through Burnham
Pavilion.
i am so happy right now." said a beaming Harding
after the meet. "I [had] never broken 9.8. and tonight 1
did it on two events. I'm just blown awax and excited for
the future."
The rest of the team struggled throughout the entire

meet, never quite getting into a groove.
"It was definiteh not our best meet." said junior co
captain Amy Murakami. "But we're going to have
meets like this every so often. It was still great to see
other gymnasts out there doing events the\ normally
don't compete in."
They started out on the vault and had a mediocre
showing, finishing with a team score of 48.475.
However, senior co-captain keri Monahan and
sophomore Lanssa Fontaine shone. Monahan had
two almost perfect vaults and scored a 9.825. Fontaine
hit her "Yurchcnko." a round off entr\ on vault, for
the first time this year. Fontaine's vault grabbed the at
tention of the distracted crowd and a score of 9.9.
The team mark was still higher than the Cardinal's
season average, which shows how much the Cardinal has
been improving and how much potential the squad has
Next up for the Cardinal were the uneven parallel
bars, and things picked up for the time being. Besides
Harding's performance, senior Arm Neil hit her routine
and scored a 9.8. and Fontaine (9.9) nailed her routine,
dazzling the crowd with her landing.
Junior Katie Fitzpatnek, a former national competi
tor. performed a great routine, scoring a 9.3 after stum
bling in her dismount. Fitzpatnek |ust came back from
having ankle surgery, and her strong bar routine in her
first competition since Ma\ bodes well for the future.

Senior Keri Monahan helped the women's gymnastics team put away Cal this weekend 193.45-190.675.
Monahan had a solid floor routine, where her "Yurchenko" vault earned a 9.9.
After the bars event, the Cardinal
led 97.2-95.3.
Things started to fall apart for the
Cardinal at the start of the beam
competition, but the resilient Cardi
nal refused to be beaten. Sopho
more Kim Young, freshman Jenny
Wilson and Fontaine all fell, mean
ing the Cardinal would have to
count two falls. Freshman Jennifer
Exaltacion cleaned up the Cardi
nal's act and finished the event on a
strong note as she hit her routine
and stuck her landing for a 9.8.
The Cardinal finished the meet
with some of its best floor perfor
mances of the season as the last
three floor performers all scored
9.925. Perhaps inspired by Harding's
moving performance. Monahan had
a smooth routine while Murakami

wrapped up the meet in her usual
fine form with an almost flawless
routine. All three gymnasts broke
their season highs on the floor. With
the last three gymnasts all scoring
better than 9.9, the Cardinal had
once again successfully cooked the
Weenies.
While Stanford was resting some
of its best athletes, Cal's Leila
Khoury and Jenni Rang stole the
first two places on the all-around
with scores of 38.4 and 38.0, respec
tively.
But the rest of the Bears couldn't
keep up with the Card's less-than
perfect performance. They strug
gled the entire meet and looked a lit
tle shell-shocked in front of the pro
fessional Stanford gymnasts and
raucous Stanford cheering section.
Stanford swept the top three places
in each event except the bars, where
Cal's Helene Kenny took second
with a 9.85.
