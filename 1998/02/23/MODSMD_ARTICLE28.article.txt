floor routine, including one that was added this week in
practice, while keeping the audience captive with her
dramatic routine. The performance w as good enough to
garner a 9.925. also a career high. The crowd disagreed,
and shouts of "10, 10, 10" resonated through Burnham
Pavilion.
i am so happy right now." said a beaming Harding
after the meet. "I [had] never broken 9.8. and tonight 1
did it on two events. I'm just blown awax and excited for
the future."
The rest of the team struggled throughout the entire

meet, never quite getting into a groove.
"It was definiteh not our best meet." said junior co
captain Amy Murakami. "But we're going to have
meets like this every so often. It was still great to see
other gymnasts out there doing events the\ normally
don't compete in."
They started out on the vault and had a mediocre
showing, finishing with a team score of 48.475.
However, senior co-captain keri Monahan and
sophomore Lanssa Fontaine shone. Monahan had
two almost perfect vaults and scored a 9.825. Fontaine
hit her "Yurchcnko." a round off entr\ on vault, for
the first time this year. Fontaine's vault grabbed the at
tention of the distracted crowd and a score of 9.9.
The team mark was still higher than the Cardinal's
season average, which shows how much the Cardinal has
been improving and how much potential the squad has
Next up for the Cardinal were the uneven parallel
bars, and things picked up for the time being. Besides
Harding's performance, senior Arm Neil hit her routine
and scored a 9.8. and Fontaine (9.9) nailed her routine,
dazzling the crowd with her landing.
Junior Katie Fitzpatnek, a former national competi
tor. performed a great routine, scoring a 9.3 after stum
bling in her dismount. Fitzpatnek |ust came back from
having ankle surgery, and her strong bar routine in her
first competition since Ma\ bodes well for the future.
