# Prop 227 draws academic fire
## 'English for the Children' opponents claim methods unrealistic 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
A teaching method used in Cali
fornia for limited-English students
that is widely supported by educa
tors and academics will be chal
lenged in June by Proposition 227.
the "English for the Children" bal
lot initiative.
Currently, there are 1.4 million
limited-English students in Califor
nia.
State education guidelines call
for the use of transitional bilingual
education programs that teach con
tent-based subjects such as math
and social studies in the student's
native language while developing
the student's proficiency in English.
Once the student's English profi
ciency is at grade level, the student is
moved back to a mainstream class
room, without being behind in con
tent-based subject areas.
Proposition 227 proposes drastic
changes to this method, requiring
the use of a one-year intensive Eng
lish curriculum that makes little use
of a student's native language.
According to Ron IJnz, the Stan
ford alum and Silicon Valley busi
nessman who drafted the initiative,
bilingual education has not worked
because it waits too long before in
troducing reading and writing in
English.
As Unz sees it. English should be
taught right away, as young children
are quick learners and can acquire
language skills within short periods
of time.

The text of the
proposition
"English for
the Children"
requires the
placement of
limited-English
students in
"sheltered
English immer-

sion" classrooms for no longer than
one year, after which they will be
placed in mainstream classrooms.
This method of teaching makes
no use of a student's native language
for explaining concepts or mean
ings.
Instead, drawings and sign lan
guage are often used while the level
of English spoken in the classroom
is tailored to the proficiency level of
the students.
In some cases, teachers may have
bilingual aides who can communi
cate with students in their native lan
guages.
The initiative allows for the
placement of students of different
ages in the same classroom if they
have the same English proficiency
level.
Parents may request waivers to
place their children in a bilingual ed
ucation program, according to the
initiative, but only if their children
are already proficient in English, are
at least 10 years old. or have special
needs.
Special needs can only be deter
mined after a student has spent at
least 30 days in a sheltered English
classroom.
In schools where 20 or more par

ents request such waivers, the
schools must provide a bilingual ed
ucation classroom for these stu
dents.
If a quorum does not exist, then
the school must allow students with
waivers to transfer to another school
where a bilingual program does
exist.
Proposition 227 also gives par
ents the legal standing to sue school
board members, teachers or admin
istrators who do not comply with
any of its provisions.
