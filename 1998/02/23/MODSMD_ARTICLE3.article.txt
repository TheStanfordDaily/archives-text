# Prop 227 draws academic fire
## 'English for the Children' opponents claim methods unrealistic 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
A teaching method used in Cali
fornia for limited-English students
that is widely supported by educa
tors and academics will be chal
lenged in June by Proposition 227.
the "English for the Children" bal
lot initiative.
Currently, there are 1.4 million
limited-English students in Califor
nia.
State education guidelines call
for the use of transitional bilingual
education programs that teach con
tent-based subjects such as math
and social studies in the student's
native language while developing
the student's proficiency in English.
Once the student's English profi
ciency is at grade level, the student is
moved back to a mainstream class
room, without being behind in con
tent-based subject areas.
Proposition 227 proposes drastic
changes to this method, requiring
the use of a one-year intensive Eng
lish curriculum that makes little use
of a student's native language.
According to Ron IJnz, the Stan
ford alum and Silicon Valley busi
nessman who drafted the initiative,
bilingual education has not worked
because it waits too long before in
troducing reading and writing in
English.
As Unz sees it. English should be
taught right away, as young children
are quick learners and can acquire
language skills within short periods
of time.

The text of the
proposition
"English for
the Children"
requires the
placement of
limited-English
students in
"sheltered
English immer-

sion" classrooms for no longer than
one year, after which they will be
placed in mainstream classrooms.
This method of teaching makes
no use of a student's native language
for explaining concepts or mean
ings.
Instead, drawings and sign lan
guage are often used while the level
of English spoken in the classroom
is tailored to the proficiency level of
the students.
In some cases, teachers may have
bilingual aides who can communi
cate with students in their native lan
guages.
The initiative allows for the
placement of students of different
ages in the same classroom if they
have the same English proficiency
level.
Parents may request waivers to
place their children in a bilingual ed
ucation program, according to the
initiative, but only if their children
are already proficient in English, are
at least 10 years old. or have special
needs.
Special needs can only be deter
mined after a student has spent at
least 30 days in a sheltered English
classroom.
In schools where 20 or more par

ents request such waivers, the
schools must provide a bilingual ed
ucation classroom for these stu
dents.
If a quorum does not exist, then
the school must allow students with
waivers to transfer to another school
where a bilingual program does
exist.
Proposition 227 also gives par
ents the legal standing to sue school
board members, teachers or admin
istrators who do not comply with
any of its provisions.

The debate on
the proposal
A main
point of con
tention for op
ponents of
Proposition 227
is its provision
for only one

year of English language instruc
tion.
"Ron Unz has no research that


Unz

indicates that kids can learn fluent
English in one short year." said Kelly
Hayes-Raitt, the director of the "No
on Unz" campaign. "All research in
dicates that it takes kids at least two
years to learn enough academic Eng
lish to be successful."
" This one-year business is very
unusual. As far as I know, it's not
based on any research or pedagogi
cal methods," said visiting Linguis
tics Prof. Shahrzad Mahootian.
"[Unz| seems to have pulled this
number out of the air."
Unz insists, however, that young
children are able to quickly learn
English if they are taught at a level
they can understand. "You just teach
them English," he said.
"If you are just beginning school,
preschool or kindergarten, it's pretty
easy to grasp English." said a local
preschool teacher who asked to re
main anonymous.
Unz's detractors argue that chil
dren must be taught academic Eng
lish so as to ensure future success, not
simply conversational skills.
Unz responded. "Advanced aca
demic English takes a lot longer to
learn. If kids are in kindergarten,
teach them kindergarten English, so
they're even with all the other chil
dren.
"When you're talking about 6-

year-olds, they don't know advanced
English either. If at the end of
kindergarten, they all know kinder
garten English, 1 don't see why that's
a had thing."
Opponents also feel that Unz is
unjustly attacking bilingual educa
tion programs as the reason for pix>r
academic achievement statewide.
As Education Prof. Kenji Hakuta
explained, about SI) percent of limit
ed-English students are from fami
lies below the poverty line.
He also said that there is about
one standard deviation between the
average scores on standardized
exams of poor students and middle
class students nationwide.

Ron Unz has no research
that indicates that kids can
learn fluent English in one
short year.'
— Kelly Hayes-Raitt, director
of the "No on Unz" campaign

According to IJnz, the effects of
bilingual education have been shown
to make up for only about a quarter
of this difference. Children of immi
grant, middle-class families generally
do reasonably well in school, he said.
Even though research evidence
has shown bilingual education pro
grams to be better than its alterna

tives, Hakuta said, "If the question is:
will bilingual education as currently
implemented make up for language
as well as socioeconomic barriers,
the answer is no."
Based on state figures showing
that 5 percent of limited-English stu
dents are moved back to mainstream
English classrooms every year, Unz
has interpreted a 95 percent failure
rate for bilingual education.
"But of all the limited-English
kids in California, only 30 percent are
currently in bilingual programs," said
second grade bilingual education
teacher Chris Neale, Stanford Class
of '97. "He hasn't shown causation."
"1 look at that and say, '95 percent
of students didn't learn enough Eng
lish in one year to be academically
fluent,' which just proves that the ini
tiative isn't going to work," Hayes-
Raitt said of the same statistic.
The "English for the Children"
campaign has focused on the prob
lems with bilingual education, but
"the initiative should be judged on
the merits of what it proposes and
not the merits of bilingual educa
tion," Hakuta warned.
"It may fly because people are
suspicious of bilingual education, not
because they like [the initiative],"
Hakuta said. "It's a heck of a way to
run educational policy."
Though bilingual education pro
grams that have not been well imple
mented do exist, Proposition 227
"will outlaw the best programs along

with the ones that aren't working,"
Neale said.

If at the end of kindergarten, they all know kindergarten
English, I don't see why that's a bad thing.'
— Ron Unz, Proposition 227 drafter

Those opposed to the proposi
tionalso disagree with the unilateral
imposition of one teaching method
on all California public schools.
"This will create a one-size-fits
all, state-mandated program for all
limited-English children in Califor
nia," Hayes-Raitt said.
"Right now, control is local,"
Neale said, "so a school district that
feels its students are fine in immer
sion programs can have those pro
grams. But in other school districts, it
may be more necessary to have a
stronger bilingual program, and
there's local control."
Unz pointed out that his initiative
allows for parents to request waivers
which would provide for exceptions
to the initiative's provisions.
Neale disagreed, citing the nar
row circumstances under which
waivers can be requested. "He can
say it's parental choice, but it's an
iota of parental choice with all the
obstacles."
The initiative has been criticized
for allowing the placement of stu
dents of different ages in the same

classroom if they have the same level
of English proficiency.

But "it's not like the kids are run
ning around doing all kinds of crazy
things," the preschool teacher said.
"All ages should be able to mingle to
gether without an accident, with su
pervision."
Hayes-Raitt disagreed with the
provision allowing for lawsuits
against teachers and administrators,
which might prevent them from using
a student's native language when
necessary for fear of being sued.
Opponents have questioned
Unz's lack of background in educa
tion, wondering if he is the most qual
ified person to be dictating educa
tional policy for the state.
Ericka Keil, a bilingual education
teacher at Robert Sanders Elemen
tary School in San Jose, said. "I don't
tell him how to run his software com
pany. I'm a teacher and 1 know
what's best for kids."
Unz admitted his lack of a back
ground in education. "That's perfect
ly true," he said. "But I do have com
mon sense, and with the claims of
academic theorists, I think they're a
bunch of lunatics."

cal methods," said visiting Linguis
tics Prof. Shahrzad Mahootian.
"[Unz| seems to have pulled this
number out of the air."
Unz insists, however, that young
children are able to quickly learn
English if they are taught at a level
they can understand. "You just teach
them English," he said.
"If you are just beginning school,
preschool or kindergarten, it's pretty
easy to grasp English." said a local
preschool teacher who asked to re
main anonymous.
Unz's detractors argue that chil
dren must be taught academic Eng
lish so as to ensure future success, not
simply conversational skills.
Unz responded. "Advanced aca
demic English takes a lot longer to
learn. If kids are in kindergarten,
teach them kindergarten English, so
they're even with all the other chil
dren.
"When you're talking about 6-

year-olds, they don't know advanced
English either. If at the end of
kindergarten, they all know kinder
garten English, 1 don't see why that's
a had thing."
Opponents also feel that Unz is
unjustly attacking bilingual educa
tion programs as the reason for pix>r
academic achievement statewide.
As Education Prof. Kenji Hakuta
explained, about SI) percent of limit
ed-English students are from fami
lies below the poverty line.
He also said that there is about
one standard deviation between the
average scores on standardized
exams of poor students and middle
class students nationwide.

Ron Unz has no research
that indicates that kids can
learn fluent English in one
short year.'
— Kelly Hayes-Raitt, director
of the "No on Unz" campaign

According to IJnz, the effects of
bilingual education have been shown
to make up for only about a quarter
of this difference. Children of immi
grant, middle-class families generally
do reasonably well in school, he said.
Even though research evidence
has shown bilingual education pro
grams to be better than its alterna

tives, Hakuta said, "If the question is:
will bilingual education as currently
implemented make up for language
as well as socioeconomic barriers,
the answer is no."
Based on state figures showing
that 5 percent of limited-English stu
dents are moved back to mainstream
English classrooms every year, Unz
has interpreted a 95 percent failure
rate for bilingual education.
"But of all the limited-English
kids in California, only 30 percent are
currently in bilingual programs," said
second grade bilingual education
teacher Chris Neale, Stanford Class
of '97. "He hasn't shown causation."
"1 look at that and say, '95 percent
of students didn't learn enough Eng
lish in one year to be academically
fluent,' which just proves that the ini
tiative isn't going to work," Hayes-
Raitt said of the same statistic.
The "English for the Children"
campaign has focused on the prob
lems with bilingual education, but
"the initiative should be judged on
the merits of what it proposes and
not the merits of bilingual educa
tion," Hakuta warned.
"It may fly because people are
suspicious of bilingual education, not
because they like [the initiative],"
Hakuta said. "It's a heck of a way to
run educational policy."
Though bilingual education pro
grams that have not been well imple
mented do exist, Proposition 227
"will outlaw the best programs along

with the ones that aren't working,"
Neale said.

If at the end of kindergarten, they all know kindergarten
English, I don't see why that's a bad thing.'
— Ron Unz, Proposition 227 drafter

Those opposed to the proposi
tionalso disagree with the unilateral
imposition of one teaching method
on all California public schools.
"This will create a one-size-fits
all, state-mandated program for all
limited-English children in Califor
nia," Hayes-Raitt said.
"Right now, control is local,"
Neale said, "so a school district that
feels its students are fine in immer
sion programs can have those pro
grams. But in other school districts, it
may be more necessary to have a
stronger bilingual program, and
there's local control."
Unz pointed out that his initiative
allows for parents to request waivers
which would provide for exceptions
to the initiative's provisions.
Neale disagreed, citing the nar
row circumstances under which
waivers can be requested. "He can
say it's parental choice, but it's an
iota of parental choice with all the
obstacles."
The initiative has been criticized
for allowing the placement of stu
dents of different ages in the same

classroom if they have the same level
of English proficiency.

But "it's not like the kids are run
ning around doing all kinds of crazy
things," the preschool teacher said.
"All ages should be able to mingle to
gether without an accident, with su
pervision."
Hayes-Raitt disagreed with the
provision allowing for lawsuits
against teachers and administrators,
which might prevent them from using
a student's native language when
necessary for fear of being sued.
Opponents have questioned
Unz's lack of background in educa
tion, wondering if he is the most qual
ified person to be dictating educa
tional policy for the state.
Ericka Keil, a bilingual education
teacher at Robert Sanders Elemen
tary School in San Jose, said. "I don't
tell him how to run his software com
pany. I'm a teacher and 1 know
what's best for kids."
Unz admitted his lack of a back
ground in education. "That's perfect
ly true," he said. "But I do have com
mon sense, and with the claims of
academic theorists, I think they're a
bunch of lunatics."
A teaching method used in Cali
fornia for limited-English students
that is widely supported by educa
tors and academics will be chal
lenged in June by Proposition 227.
the "English for the Children" bal
lot initiative.
Currently, there are 1.4 million
limited-English students in Califor
nia.
State education guidelines call
for the use of transitional bilingual
education programs that teach con
tent-based subjects such as math
and social studies in the student's
native language while developing
the student's proficiency in English.
Once the student's English profi
ciency is at grade level, the student is
moved back to a mainstream class
room, without being behind in con
tent-based subject areas.
Proposition 227 proposes drastic
changes to this method, requiring
the use of a one-year intensive Eng
lish curriculum that makes little use
of a student's native language.
According to Ron IJnz, the Stan
ford alum and Silicon Valley busi
nessman who drafted the initiative,
bilingual education has not worked
because it waits too long before in
troducing reading and writing in
English.
As Unz sees it. English should be
taught right away, as young children
are quick learners and can acquire
language skills within short periods
of time.

The text of the
proposition
"English for
the Children"
requires the
placement of
limited-English
students in
"sheltered
English immer-

sion" classrooms for no longer than
one year, after which they will be
placed in mainstream classrooms.
This method of teaching makes
no use of a student's native language
for explaining concepts or mean
ings.
Instead, drawings and sign lan
guage are often used while the level
of English spoken in the classroom
is tailored to the proficiency level of
the students.
In some cases, teachers may have
bilingual aides who can communi
cate with students in their native lan
guages.
The initiative allows for the
placement of students of different
ages in the same classroom if they
have the same English proficiency
level.
Parents may request waivers to
place their children in a bilingual ed
ucation program, according to the
initiative, but only if their children
are already proficient in English, are
at least 10 years old. or have special
needs.
Special needs can only be deter
mined after a student has spent at
least 30 days in a sheltered English
classroom.
In schools where 20 or more par

ents request such waivers, the
schools must provide a bilingual ed
ucation classroom for these stu
dents.
If a quorum does not exist, then
the school must allow students with
waivers to transfer to another school
where a bilingual program does
exist.
Proposition 227 also gives par
ents the legal standing to sue school
board members, teachers or admin
istrators who do not comply with
any of its provisions.

The debate on
the proposal
A main
point of con
tention for op
ponents of
Proposition 227
is its provision
for only one

year of English language instruc
tion.
"Ron Unz has no research that

Hayes-Raitt, the director of the "No

dicates that it takes kids at least two

lish to be successful."
