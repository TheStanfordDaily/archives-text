■ Friday: Pepperdine d. Stanford
15-11,15-17,15-9,15-4
■ Siiturday: Loyola Marymount d.
Stanford 14-16, 16-14, 15-11, 9-15,
15-10

3.4-3), losing 14-16,16-14, 15-11,9-
15,15-10.
In each match, the Cardinal
dropped close games that most like
ly would have made for a different
outcome. Had Stanford won the
first game of Friday's match and the
second game of Saturday's match,
the Cardinal would likely have
made it through the weekend with
its unblemished record intact.
Although the loss to second
ranked Pepperdine was a disap
pointment. the Cardinal entered the
match as an underdog. While the
Waves left Maples Pavilion with a
victory, Stanford did prove that it
can hold its own with the best teams
in the country. The match was by no
means one-sided, as a Stanford win
in the first game would have com
pletely changed the match.
Sophomore outside hitter Andy
Witt, who is currently fifth in the
country in kill average, led all hit
ters with 26 kills, while senior mid
dle blocker Keenan Whitehurst
added 17. Sophomore outside hit
ter Josh Palacios had the highest
kill percentage for all hitters with a
.7X6 and added four aces lor the
Cardinal.
Pepperdine's offensive attack
was well-rounded. Four of the
Waves' starters posted double-digit
figures in kills, with the fifth hitter
just helow with nine.
Pepperdine finished the night
hitting .516.

Stanford's choice of attack was to
serve aggressively, a strategy which
was successful in the first two games.
Stanford's success with serving fell
off somewhat in the second half of
the match. As a result of these ag
gressive serves, the Cardinal posted
its highest number of service errors
this season, 39.
"We scored a high percentage of
points off strong serves, and we
chose not to back off," said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves.
After a long, strenuous match
Friday, the Cardinal was forced to
play another difficult match just IK
hours later. Loyola Marvmount en
tered Maples Pavilion on a two
game winning streak, with defeats
of USC and Pacific.
The second game of Saturday's
match was the essential one for
Stanford. An incredible dig from se
nior defensive specialist Tyler Neal
gave the Cardinal a 12-11 lead, but
the Cardinal could not hold on,
eventually losing the game 16-14.
Witt had another strong hitting
match, posting a new career high in
kills with 51, more than twice the
number of the next Cardinal hitter.
Whitehurst, who is second national
ly in hitting percentage, added 24
kills for Stanford and hit .618 with 24
kills. Senior middle blocker Tad
Hoffman, who is fourth nationally
in the same category, posted 19 kills
for the Cardinal and hit .485.
Some of the loss can be attrib
uted to the Cardinal's difficulty in
stopping the Lions' hitters.
While all five of Stanford's start
ing hitters posted double digits, four
of the LMU's starting five had more
than 20.
Additionally, the Lions are a
team that works hard and hustles, as
demonstrated by an LMIJ dig in the
fifth game that hit the floor on Stan
ford's side of the net and left the
Cardinal looking.
While the Lions are ranked
lower than the Cardinal, Stanford
by no means expected an easy
match.
