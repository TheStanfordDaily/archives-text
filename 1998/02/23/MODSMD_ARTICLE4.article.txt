# Unz zeal for reform stems from studies of existing programs

### Ann Kim Staff writer 
As Ron Unz tells it.the
whole thing started in 19% after
he read an article in The Los
Angeles Times.
According to this article, im
migrant Chicano / Latino par
ents in Los Angeles had started
a public boycott of their local el
ementary school because it was
refusing to let their children
learn English.
The parents said that under
the bilingual education program
used by the school, their chil
dren were not introduced to
reading and writing in English
until the fourth or fifth grade.
"That seemed really pecu
liar," said Ltaz, a Silicon Valley

businessman. Stanford alum
and theoretical physicist by
training.
This set off a chain of events
leading to Proposition 227, the
"English for the Children" bal
lot initiative authored by Unz.
which proposes to dramatically
curtail native-language instruc
tion for limited-English students
in the state of California.
After reading the article,
Unz met with some of the
protesting parents and local im
migrant rights activists in Los
Angeles "to find out what was
going on."
He wanted to find out direct
ly from the parents whether the
article he had read was correct.
