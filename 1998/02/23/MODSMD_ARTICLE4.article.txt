# Unz zeal for reform stems from studies of existing programs
## 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
As Ron Unz tells it.the
whole thing started in 19% after
he read an article in The Los
Angeles Times.
According to this article, im
migrant Chicano / Latino par
ents in Los Angeles had started
a public boycott of their local el
ementary school because it was
refusing to let their children
learn English.
The parents said that under
the bilingual education program
used by the school, their chil
dren were not introduced to
reading and writing in English
until the fourth or fifth grade.
"That seemed really pecu
liar," said Ltaz, a Silicon Valley

businessman. Stanford alum
and theoretical physicist by
training.
This set off a chain of events
leading to Proposition 227, the
"English for the Children" bal
lot initiative authored by Unz.
which proposes to dramatically
curtail native-language instruc
tion for limited-English students
in the state of California.
After reading the article,
Unz met with some of the
protesting parents and local im
migrant rights activists in Los
Angeles "to find out what was
going on."
He wanted to find out direct
ly from the parents whether the
article he had read was correct.
or whether it was simply a media
exaggeration.
"When I met with them, they in
dicated that everything in the arti
cle was true," he said.
Unz then went on to examine
statewide statistics on education.
He found that a quarter of Califor
nia public school students, or 1.4
million, have been found to possess
limited English proficiency.
He also found that the state's re
designation rate, or the rate at
which limited-English students are
moved back to mainstream class
rooms. is about 5 percent per year.
"When 1 found the statistics,
they were unbelievable — much
worse than I had imagined." IJnz
said. "I'd been totally unaware of
how bad it was in California."
Unz explained that the next
thing he did was arrange meetings
with prominent academics and ac
tivists who supported bilingual edu
cation. He wanted to make sure he
wasn't missing anything.
He met with leaders from the
Mexican American Legal Defense
and Education Eund and MEChA,
a Chicano / Latino student group.
"What amazed me was that
none of these people really defend
ed bilingual education." Unz said.
According to Unz. these sup
porters said that bilingual educa

tion works in theory but has just not
been well implemented. Based on
his training in theoretical physics,
Unz said, he could only think, "If a
theory says something works but
then all of the experiments fail, you
give up" and discard the theory.
"Bilingual education has been
around for 25 years. If you haven't
been able to make it work in all that
time, what makes you think it'll
change?" Unz asked.
As Unz saw it, change didn't
seem to be coming. The Chacon-
Moscone Bilingual-Bicultural Edu
cation Act of 1976, the California
statute providing for bilingual edu
cation. expired in 1987.
Since then, the California legis
lature has been unable to pass any
provision for the education of limit
ed-English students.
"It was clear that the only way to
change the policy was through the
initiative process," Unz said. "If the
legislature was deadlocked for 11
years, I wasn't going to hold my
breath for them."
So Unz drafted his own initia
tive. submitting it to various educa
tors for input and finally filed it with
the California secretary of state
after about 15 drafts.
As for his own experience with
foreign languages. Unz took four
years of French in high school, "but
I didn't get much out of it,"he said.
"Which goes to show that French
for one hour a day doesn't work
verv well."
