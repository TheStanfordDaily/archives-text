# Grad schools hold on to high ranking
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Senior staff writer 
In this year's U.S. News and
World Report graduate school
rankings, the Schools of Business.
Education. Engineering. Medicine
and Law all kept their top-10 spots,
with only small shifts upward or
downward..
Because U.S. News began
rounding off its ranking numbers
this year. Stanford experienced a
slight movement up the chart and
ties with other schools. I he Law
school. No. 3 last year, is now tied
with Harvard University's for the
No. 2 spot. The Business School, .i
long-time No. 1 in the rankings, is
also now sharing the position with
Harvard.
I he School of Engineering kept
its traditional second-place spot

under MIT. while the Medical
Sehtxil moved up one position and
is now tied in ninth place with the
University of Michigan-Ann
Arbor.
The School of Education experi
enced a slight drop in the rankings,
moving from the No. 2 to No 4 slot
II the graduate school rankings
for this year provide little excite
ment. however, the growing oppo
sition to the rankings in academia
does.
I ast spring. University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper called for the
magazine to end its college rank
ings Instead ol gning information
to I S. News. Casper encouraged
colleges and universities to create a
centralized World Wide Web data
base of college statistics.

Now. the opposition to the rank
ings has moved to the graduate
level. In a report released last
Wednesday, the Association of
American Law Schools challenged
the accuracy of U.S. News' ranking
methodology.
The report found that of the 12
factors used by U.S. News to evalu
ate law schools, only two — student
selectivity and academic reputation
— have a significant effect on a
school's ranking. The median
LSAT scores of the entering class
was found to account for 90 percent
of the differences in ranking.
In a statement * U.S. News de
fended its rankings methodology.
The release said the rankings were
not meant to be the primary source
of information for applicants but to
provide "an independent assess
ment. an efficient way to compare
schools, and a means for gathering
judgments that experts have made
about each law school."
Bob Morse, a spokesman for
U.S. News, said the rankings are
"one tool — they are not meant to
be absolute."
"We are not doing this to please
members of academia. but to pro
vide prospective students with in
formation." Morse added.
In anticipation of the release of
this year's rankings, deans of lb4
law schools endorsed a letter titled
"Law School rankings may be haz

ardous to your health." which was
sent to 93,000 law school applicants.
The deans of eight of the top 10-
ranked law schools from last year
signed the letter, including Stanford
Law School Dean Paul Brest.
" These rankings leave many im
portant variables out of account, ar
bitrarily weight others and are gen
erally unreliable as a guide to those
qualities of different schools that a
candidate should consider when ap
plying to law school," the letter
said.
Brest said he objects to U.S.
News' use of precise numerical data
to evaluate subjective factors.
"One fundamental problem is
that [the rankings] imply far more
precision than any ranking process
can proviae, Bresfsaid.
According to him, the difference
between the No. 1 ranked law
school and the No. 10 school may
actually be minimal. U.S. News,
however, encourages preoccupa
tion with rankings by presenting its
numerical data as absolute, he said.
"It short-circuits what should be
a thoughtful process," Eirest said.
He said he would prefer a rank
ing system set up like a "restaurant
guide," which evaluates relative
strengths and weaknesses of each
school.
That said. Brest showed no dis
tress at Stanford's high ranking. He
quoted former University President
Donald Kennedy's opinion of the
rankings: "It's just a beauty contest,
but it's still always nice to finish in
the top."
