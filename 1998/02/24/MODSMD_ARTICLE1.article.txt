# Linguist Rickford to chair Afro-Am
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
A nationwide search for a new director of
the Program in African and Afro-American
Studies has ended close to home with the ap
pointment of Stanford Linguistics Prof. John
Rickford.
The position had been vacant since 19%,
when Assoc. English Prof. Horace Porter's
term ended. Rickford's appointment is effec
tive Sept. 1.
Rickford had previously served as chair of
the program's steering committee and was on
the search committee that first brought Porter
to Stanford.
As director, Rickford will also become the
Martin Luther King Jr. Centennial Professor,
an endowed chair that was recently perma
nently linked with the directorship of the pro
gram.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education

Ramon Saldivar called Rickford "the ideal
choice" for the position.
He said Rickford has shown, both as a
teacher and as the resident fellow of Kimball
Hall, "the depth of his commitment to under
graduate education."
He also said that Rickford's research in lin
guistics is "some of the most exciting and inno
vative work being done in that field in the
country."
Rickford's most publicized work recently
has been his research in the linguistic charac
teristics of African American Vernacular Eng
lish. often called F.bonics. and its usefulness as
a teaching tool.
He said he was drawn to that subject by his
work in pidgins and Creoles, languages that de
velop because of social and historical circum
stances such as slavery or colonialism. Rick
ford is president of the Society for Pidgin and
Creole Linguistics.
Morris Graves, who has served
as acting director of the program
during the search period, noted
Rickford's background in linguis
tics and his long experience of the
Stanford community, as well as his
"high energy level" and "people
skills."
At first, Rickford said, he de
clined the administrative post. How
ever. he explained, he went running
shortly after turning the post down,
and when he returned home he
found himself writing a list of 16

things he thought would revitalize
the program.
"As 1 wrote them up, I said, 'I
must be more interested in this than
1 let on to myself," he explained.
According to Rickford, the pro
gram, which now has 11 undergrad
uate majors, has "a lot of room for
growth."
He specifically mentioned en
couraging more students to take the
program's core course and bringing
more faculty into teaching that
course, as well as working with the
Schools of Law and Medicine to de
velop courses geared to black stu
dents with pre-professional inter
ests.
In addition to other schools with

in Stanford, he said he hopes to de
velop programs and links with other
prominent centers of study in
African-American culture.
Rickford said he also hopes to re
vitalize the program's role as "the in
tellectual center of issues that affect
the black community" and as a
forum for black faculty to meet.
In many of these initiatives, Rick
ford noted, he is reviving or continu
ing practices of his notable predeces
sors, mentioning, along with Porter
and Graves, St. Clair Drake, Sylvia
Winer, James Gibbs and Kennell
Jackson.
"I really have a sense of people
who have done a fine job going be
fore me," he said.
