# Linguist Rickford to chair Afro-Am
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
A nationwide search for a new director of
the Program in African and Afro-American
Studies has ended close to home with the ap
pointment of Stanford Linguistics Prof. John
Rickford.
The position had been vacant since 19%,
when Assoc. English Prof. Horace Porter's
term ended. Rickford's appointment is effec
tive Sept. 1.
Rickford had previously served as chair of
the program's steering committee and was on
the search committee that first brought Porter
to Stanford.
As director, Rickford will also become the
Martin Luther King Jr. Centennial Professor,
an endowed chair that was recently perma
nently linked with the directorship of the pro
gram.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education

Ramon Saldivar called Rickford "the ideal
choice" for the position.
He said Rickford has shown, both as a
teacher and as the resident fellow of Kimball
Hall, "the depth of his commitment to under
graduate education."
He also said that Rickford's research in lin
guistics is "some of the most exciting and inno
vative work being done in that field in the
country."
Rickford's most publicized work recently
has been his research in the linguistic charac
teristics of African American Vernacular Eng
lish. often called F.bonics. and its usefulness as
a teaching tool.
He said he was drawn to that subject by his
work in pidgins and Creoles, languages that de
velop because of social and historical circum
stances such as slavery or colonialism. Rick
ford is president of the Society for Pidgin and
