## Strong American presence to remain in Kuwait 
### 
WASHINGTON (Al') President Clinton gave
cautious approval yesterday to a I N. agreement with
Saddam Hussein lor monitoring suspect weapons sites
in Iraq, stepping hack from the immediate threat ot a
U.S. military attack. C linton said he would keep a
potent force in the Persian (iull
I he president said that il Iraq reneged on a commit
ment to make possible chemical and biological
weapons sites subject to inspection, the consequences
would be "very very serious."
"What really matters ... is not what Iraq sa\s but
what it does." the president said in the White House
()val ()ffice.
Although Clinton did not mention I N. economic
sanctions that have wreaked havoc on the Iraqi econo
my. it was learned the agreement holds out the promise
they would be eased or lifted i! Iraq complied totalis
with I J.N. inspections.
Another gesture to Iraq in the accord, which I V
Secretary General Koli Annan reached Sundav in
Baghdad with Saddam, was that the inspectors would
be supplemented with a diplomatic contingent. Iraq has
contended that American inspectors .ire spies.
I he diplomats would accompany inspectors to pres
idential complexes, which Saddam has \igorousl\
declared were his private preserve.
" I here are details in the agreement that have to be
fleshed out." ( linton said. Some may become clear
after Annan returns today to New York.
Then. Clinton said, "we need to test the agreement
and verify that the commitments which are made in
writing are kept in fact."
White House spokesman Mike McCurrv said noth

ing Annan reported about the deal "would indicate that
the I iiited Nations has anything but unlettered capac
ity to continue its work "
Iraq's deputy prime minister. I ariq A/i/.. who signed
the accord with Annan, said in Baghdad. "It was diplo
mats wise, balanced I nited Nations, world diplo
mats that enabled us to reach this agreement."
But Annan, in comments more in line with the
American view. said the deal was worked out with
"diplomacy backed bv firmness and force."
With obvious relief. Clinton said. "All Americans
should have a positive reaction to the fact that we have
a commitment Id open all these sites."
II Iraq fails to abide b\ the agreement, he said he
was confident a forceful I S action would have
widespread support around the world.
I believe if it does not keep its word this time,
everyone would understand." he said, alluding to the
reservations Russia. France and several other nations
had registered about bombing the sites during the cri
sis.
Before making the statement, C linton conferred
with other world leaders as his foreign policy advisers
fly specked the document signed b\ Annan and Saddam
to avert a I S military strike.
Senate Republican leader 1 rent L.ott of Mississippi
said after reviewing the agreement with Clinton that it
provided unrestricted access for I N. inspectors to all
sites. He called it a positive step.
Still, mindful of the shak\ support Clinton had for
attacking Iraq even before Annan's trip. Lott said the
president might have been in a box" â€” stuck with an
agreement he had to accept.
