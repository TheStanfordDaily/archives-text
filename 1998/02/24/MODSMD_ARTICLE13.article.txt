Lack of information casts
doubt on progress in finding
speaker for Commencement

AS WINTER QUARTER
draws to a close, a most
noticeable absence presides
overthe campus: a missing Commen
cent speaker.
Every year, the senior class presi
dents have the estimable responsibil
ity of selecting a member of the Stan
ford family — past, present or future
— to speak at the June Commence
ment ceremony.
This task is not one to be taken
lightly and calls upon the senior class
presidents to work in tandem with
the President and Provost's Office in
selecting and guaranteeing a speaker
for the event. Last year's senior class
presidents were able to select
Supreme Court Justice Stephen
Breyer in mid-November.
The previous year, Mae Jemison,
the first black woman to go into
space, was chosen by mid-January.
Last week, calls to the President's
Office in regard to this issue received
the reply of "Not yet," and "Don't
know when we'll be able to tell you."
Calls to the senior class presidents
didn't elicit much more information.
Nobody told us anything other than

"No comment."
What, if anything, is going on?
The senior class presidents are
supposed to select a speaker based
on the input of the graduating
seniors.
Last quarter, they sent out an e
mail soliciting suggestions for speak
ers. Since then, no further communi
cation related to this topic has
occurred. Seniors have, however,
received plenty of e-mails, but most
are concerned with the details of
upcoming senior pub nights.
Granted, the criteria for selecting a
Commencement speaker are more
stringent at Stanford than at other
schools.
We wonder if the current delay is
the result of the difficulty in finding
someone who meets the require
ments set forth by the President's
Office?
Perhaps the cause of the delay lies
not with the senior class presidents,
but at a higher level of the process.
Is there something wrong with the
options that they have suggested to
the President's Office?
Are prospective speakers turning
down invitations?
At the very least, students deserve
to know what progress, if any, has
occurred. After all, the truth is never
as bad as the conjectures of one's
imagination.
