Exceptions for Greeks
perpetuate elitism
Aly Remtulla brough up an important
question yesterday, "Why does the adminis
tration make exceptions for fraternities?"
There are two reasons that the University
allows the Greek system to exist despite the
costs that it incurs. The first has to do with
history, and the second is money.
Until very recently, Stanford was an
institution by and for the elite. It has served
as a finishing school for generations of the
socially distinguished in the West. The exis
tence of Greek organizations dates from the
beginning of Stanford University. Leland
Stanford Sr. was himself a Mason, so it is
understandable that he would have an affin
ity for fraternal organizations.
George Crothers was another Mason
who "played a great and vitally important
role in the history of the University" by
using his judicial influence to save Stanford.
Crothers, of Crothers Memorial Hall fame,
was a Sigma Nu in the Class of 1895.
There is evidence to suggest that Sigma
Nu. along with other Greek organizations,
has continued to have many of its graduates
become influential Masons (see, for exam
ple. the publication "One Hundred Years of
Freemasonry in California").
This and similar evidence going back to
the foundation of the University would
seem to confirm Remtulla's opinion that
"Greek organizations allow such people to
maintain their power through networks

among the social elite."
The second reason that Greek housing
remains is money. Both fraternal organiza
tions and massive amounts of money lay at
the foundation of Stanford's history. Today
it is still true that the University is eager to
attract donors not only for obvious financial
reasons, hut also so that it can improve its
U.S. News and World Report standing by
scoring higher in the alumni-giving catego
ry. Greek alumni as a group give at substan
tially higher rates and often express their
support for the Greek system. As a result,
the Greek system remains.
For this reason, no amount of campus
dialogue will ameliorate the situation. In
response, current and future alumni must
voice their concern to the administration
and they must pledge not to give a single
cent to the University if there is a single new
Greek house on the Row next year. As a
prospective alumnus, I make that pledge.
Greek organizations should not be abol
ished, just de-housed. If we are to build a
democratic society, we must have healthy
voluntary institutions. Hut none of these
institutions should receive preferential
treatment.
Stanford has come a long way from its
elite, privileged beginnings. Hopefully as an
institution it can continue to grow, and not
find itself "fighting the battle of the '4()s all
over again," as Sylvia Williams. '42. wrote in
her Feb. 13 letter to the editor.
Progress — not regress.

Housed fra tern i ties
benefit all students
After reading Aly Remtulla's column,
one is left with a single, overbearing ques
tion. Is Aly Remtulla the devil?
Remtulla appears to present an effective
argument for dehousing all on-campus
Greek organizations. However, once the
nail polish fumes clear and the "Tenure
Gupta" chants abate, certain glaring flaws
leave his argument as untenable as Frater
nal Affairs Adviser Heather Dunn in a bat
tle of the wits.
First, Remtulla uses a hypothetical
explanation of how "a social group for (his]
male friends" would be rejected for Univer
sity housing.
There is a decisive difference between
his social group and fraternities: Remtulla
and his friend watching television does
nothing for the students at large; however, a
deejay, 10 kegs of beer and an open location
provide a service for about 500 to 1.000 stu
dents every weekend.
Second. Remtulla objects to the "para
doxical" claim that Stanford "fight[s| dis
crimination in all its forms," but houses fra
ternities. This is ludicrous.
Stanford should and does discriminate
against the genetically stupid. This is ratio
nal discrimination; Stanford couldn't exist
as it does with a class of stupid people. Like
wise, an important segment of our school's
social life couldn't exist without a housed

Greek community.
Next, Remtulla goes into some bizarre
effort to smoke screen everyone from real
izing that theme houses are equivalent to
fraternity houses. In a word, wrong. Sure,
fraternities do have guaranteed housing for
their members, but, in a de facto sense, so
do theme houses.
It's SO difficult to draw under 3,(KX),
which is good (unfortunate?) enough to get
you in Casa Zapata, Ujaama, Okada, etc.
(Note: Muwekma is a notable exception
here, but one that can easily be justified by
the benefits of an on-campus casino).
And I debate the point that people of a
certain race (not proportionally, but there's
no reason why it couldn't be), class (frater
nity fees are FAR less than the overpriced
meal plans in any University dorm), gender
(I have many friends whose girlfriends are
so close to being an official part of the fra
ternity that they even spend the night occa
sionally), and sexuality (there's even one
known affectionately as the "gay frat" — a
term I DO NOT endorse) are precluded
from enjoying the benefits of a housed fra
ternity.
I do agree with Remtulla's next point:
keg parties arc just as valuable as theme
dorm programming and cultural events.
Hell, judging by attendance, keg parties
may be more important. Imagine a universi
ty with no campus-wide parties. Fraternities
are the only groups capable of throwing
such culturally diverse, university inclusive
events. We would all be reduced to looking
forward to Z<x>t Suit Week. Ballet Folklori
co performances, Branner parties and Stan

ford Taiko.
Don't get me wrong — these all have
their place, but so do parties. And I thought
El Nino brought a dark cloud over the Uni
versity
Remtulla implies one last point — that
fraternity members are homophobic, misog
ynistic, racist, rich, elitist pigs. An interest
ing characterization that makes me question
how often he leaves his room. Hut I'll con
cede the point.
If true, housing fraternities actually
serves another valuable purpose: purging
dorms of incorrigible, "drunk" fools who
would disrupt any attempt at dorm unity by
segregating the halls and oppressing all out
group members.
In conclusion, there is probably one pos
itive event that could result from de-housing
the Greeks: Heather Dunn would lose her
job.
But would that really generate enough
social utility to outweigh a significant loss to
students whose lives are enriched by parties
every weekend? The answer's as transpar
ent as an Eskimo's melted igloo: no way.
