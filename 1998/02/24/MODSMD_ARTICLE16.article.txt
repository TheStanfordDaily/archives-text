## Wrinkled toes, wrinkled prose 
### 
EL NINO HAS
been on the minds
of people at Stan
ford, in the basements of
University buildings and
has deviously soaked into
bicycle seats. It has also
provided one of the more

dramatic moments of the
year: the flooding of several campus
libraries and the inestimable loss of textual
resources. ?
The call came art>und three in the morn
ing. The books were in grave danger. Clad
in Windbreakers and sheathed in Gore-
Tex, the few. the proud and the sleep
deprived stumbled toward Green Library
under a foreboding sky. It would have been
the perfect hoax, a final project for Psychol
ogy Prof. Philip Zimbardo's "Psychology of
Mind Control" class, bigger than Moon at
Noon. Fraternity brothers were probably
impersonating Dean of Students Marc
Wais' voice, sending a tlock of do-gooder
resident assistants and their even more
gullible freshmen towards a flood that
didn't exist — revenging the assault on the
Greek system.
The fraternity brothers were actually in
the basement of Cubberley. bailing out edu
cation records by flashlight. A few hundred
more students assembled to move the over
1(M),(X)() water-damaged books to higher
ground. The scene had a surreal quality —
piles of books stacked on any available
space above water level, their reflections in

the water distorted by the wakes of laden
book carts.
Our ivory towers are seldom the play
ground of superheroes, besides the occa
sional Big Game goal post defender. Yet
Green provided some quiet heroes. Stan
ford students and library staff worked
through the night, reshelving, passing and
boxing, in what turned out to be one of the
most inspiring displays of community effort
I've witnessed on this campus.
The novelty of the situation, however,
soon gave way to the tedium of the massive
and unglamorous task ahead. Yet, by nine
o'clock the libraries were turning away vol
unteers, unable to find work for the over
whelming number of students.
Undoubtedly, the University will contin
ue to assess the damages incurred that
night. Estimates already reach into the mil
lions. Whether any of those books rescued
from the tide will ultimately survive remains
to be seen. What then, can we learn from
this little life lesson?
1) Librarians rarely encounter crisis situ
ations. Put another way, the "thrill factor" is
not a huge pull for those nice, pigmenta
tionally-challenged folks behind the refer
ence desk. Cataloging and search and res
cue' are two completely different opera
tions and normally should not be mixed.
2) Green Library's basement with 6 inch
es of water at the bottom is not nearly as
exciting as the movie "Titanic." The oppor
tunities to belly crawl across the floor of the
Jonsson Library of Government Docu

ments or carry rare manuscripts above our
heads in raging chest-deep water never pre
sented themselves. Perhaps the greatest sus
tained injury was a bad case of wrinkled
toes. And alas, Kate Winslet was not to be
found in the south stacks ...
3) The value of books is relative to different
people. Responses varied from "My
babies!!!" to "Why isn't all of this online?"
Many book-bailers had trouble gauging the
relative worth of the 193} national ceui>ui in
44 volumes or Russian futurist poetry 4nms
lated into Hebrew. Meanwhile, graduate
students from the Lyman Graduate Resi
dences to Escondido Village studying
Russo-Israeli literary relations are silently
weeping.
4) Restoration science is not an exact art.
This whole "freeze-drving" method sounds
remarkably similar to the same processes
used to make astronaut ice cream and
instant coffee. "We've replaced this univer
sity's textbooks with Folger's Instant
Freeze-Dricd texts ... let's see if Stanford
students notice the difference."
5) Hell hath no fury like El Nifto
scorned. His mean older sister La Nina is
expected to be here in a year.
Maybe I'll move to Boston where the
weather is reasonable.

David Ball, a senior majoring in English,
believes the administration should take
advantage of the inclement weather and
develop a Stanford water theme park.
