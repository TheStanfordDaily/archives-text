# Showering with the boys
## Vanessa Bartsch Searching for that special gift at Big Al's 
### 
THIS FRIDAY MY friend Ann turns
21, and I am trying my damnedest to
make sure this is a day she will
remember until she turns 64. Twenty-one is
the last birthday she'll probably ever look
forward to.
When you're little, all birthdays are
great. You've got your three basie "I's":
party, presents and power. For a day you
are king of the fourth grade.
But then you get older. After you hit the
teens the blurring begins. At 16 you can
drive. At IS you are legal... to vote, that is.
Hut after you turn 21 and turn over your
fake ID, what's left?
You get to look forward to being booted
off your parents' health insurance policy
and getting tossed from Stanford security
into job-hunting hell.
Twenty-one is the last chance to cele
brate a birthday in true revelry. Friends
flock like the Wise Men. toting gifts of Ciold
schlager, Jagermeister and Mirth just for the
chance to see you at your finest moment.
In the spirit of Ann's special day, 1 went
in search of a one-of-a-kind present for my
one-of-a-kind friend. I had already bought a
Hallmark card embossed with words of

affection and respect. But I needed a pre
sent that would make a lasting impression.
I quickly weeded out alcohol as too
familiar and easy to obtain at any
respectable frat house. She flatly refused a
stripper and 1 couldn't find a male harem
for hire in the Yellow Pages. That left but
one sin-inducing option: smut.
So. this weekend. I used the lull in
midterms and papers to head to the C'itv in
search of that perfect don't-show-mom pre
sent. And this pursuit of porn brought me to
Big Al's.
At 2 p.m.. I grabbed my fearless friend
Tom and trucked on over to see what Al
had to offer Ann.
Big Al must be a really classy guy. His
shady, dimly-lit store is tucked neatly in the
midst of a row of strip clubs and "massage"
parlors.
We entered and were greeted by a scant
ily-clad girl barely old enough to walk the
halls of Paly High. She asked if she could
help me in any way. I took one look at her
and said I doubted it.
Unassisted. I began perusing the shelves.
The first room reminded me of a chemistry
test I had taken in high school. My teacher

spread 30 or 40 random pieces of lah equip
ment on a table and asked us to name each
piece and describe its function.
However, instead of crucibles and
pipettes. Al chose leather and studs. The
first thing I picked up had a ring, chains and
a couple clips. I could not for the life of me
figure out what the thing did even though I
spent a good 10 minutes trying.
Tom couldn't figure it out either.
That sort of bummed me out. There we
were, a bright young Stanford student and
an alumnus who holds multiple degrees
from the same esteemed University. Our
professors had supposedly armed us with
tools to take on the world. Yet neither of us
could make heads or tails of this thing.
I even asked a random guy standing near
me if he knew what it was and he just
looked blankly at me. So I moved on. I fig
ured that if I couldn't even fathom a single
thing that this metal-clipped, large-ringed
slingshot-from-hell did. then it was probably
not the best present for Ann.
I looked around for other, less brain
straining options. There was Jason the
Infiate-a-Date. A handsome guy. judging by
the picture on the box. Life-sized. Durable.

Satisfaction guaranteed. Hut Ann's single is
far too small to house another life-sized
body.
So I looked for something smaller. That
led me to a wall holding more mechanical
devices than the electronics department at
Sears. Battery operated, water-proof,
remote-controlled, indestructible instru
ments of wonder. For him. her. or them.
Tom and I spent some time playing
around with the darn things, trying to figure
out the ins and outs, oris and ofl's and ups
and downs. But I decided that such things
are rather hard to explain in a desk drawer.
As I was playing with a rubber toy. I acci
dentally let a large bouncing phallus loose.
It rebounded off a man standing across the
store in a dark corner, thumbing through
Hustler. The poor guy couldn't have been
older than Tom and he looked so sad.
For a minute my heart went out to him I
could picture him longing for the compan
ionship and support of a woman, waiting
shyly for Ms. Right to come and rescue him
from this fortress of filth.
I 'ntil I realized he was staring straight at
my chest. Then I gave him a "you wish"
look, tossed mv hair and muttered some

thing under my breath.
Then I om yelled. "Hey. Vanessa!" from
across the store. About 30 middle-aged men
ranging from shady to scary looked up from
their smut-zines right at me
It turns out that I share my first name
with a large-busted and fairly famous adult
movie star. Oh. the honor.
But even after perusing the videos. I
could not find that certain something that fit
the bill. Al's toys all required batteries,
inflation or lubrication.
And so in the end I left with nothing hut
a couple of stray impure thoughts and a
huge distaste for Big Al.
So to Ann: I'm sorry but you'll have to
try to enjoy your last big day without a life
sized Inflate-a-Date named Jason or a copy
of the Kamasutra But I tried.
Instead, you are getting a cake. And I
hope you enjoy the card.
