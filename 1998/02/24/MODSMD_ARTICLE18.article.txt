### Zachary Roberts Senior staff writer 
A permanent curatorship in the art of Africa, Ocea
nia and the Americas has been endowed at the Stanford
Art Museum with the gift of $3 million by Bay Area phil
anthropist Phyllis Wattis.
The gift will also enable the museum to become a sig
nificant resource in the field, according to Thomas Selig
man. the John and Jill Freidenrich Director of the muse
um. which will soon be renamed the Cantor Center for
the Visual Arts.
" This will allow us to develop a program and depart
ment with a full-time curator," Seligman said. "Very few
university art museums have curatorships in this field,
and we will be a regional resource.
"Most important is that this is an endowment, which
means the position will be established in perpetuity,
which is very difficult to do."
The endowment will help form the nucleus of the mu
seum's $25 million endowment drive for the museum's
planned re-opening in 1999.

Although endowment offers will be accepted at any
time, the Museum Endowment Campaign will officially
launch later this year.
The gift will be split roughly in half, with one-half
going to endow the curatorship and the other half going
toward programs, acquisitions, conservation and educa
tion. Seligman predicted that the endowment would
allow for one exhibition every other year, one or two ac
quisitions every other year, and conservation of existing
pieces as needed.
Ruth Franklin has been the museum's curator for the
art of Africa, Oceania and the Americas on a volunteer
basis since 1989.
"One of the most important aspects of the endow
ment will be the stability that it provides," Franklin said.
"This will allow other parts of the University to coordi
nate programs with the museum. For example, if an
African art exhibit is going to come to the museum, de
partments can coordinate course offerings with that ex
hibit's time here." When the museum re-opens, it will in
clude permanent galleries of art from Africa, Oceania
and the Americas.
