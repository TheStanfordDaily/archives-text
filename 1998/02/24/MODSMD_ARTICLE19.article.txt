The Stanford Journal of International Relations,
which Editor in Chief Hugh Handeyside calls "the first
of its kind at Stanford," will begin publication on the
World Wide Web late next quarter.
The journal is targeted at undergraduates and consti
tutes "an effort to provide a discussion forum and a ve
hicle for intelligent debate" on international relations,
said Handeyside, a junior majoring in international rela
tions.
"Stanford really needs something like the Journal,"
he continued, calling the international relations curricu
lum here abstract and unfocused. "You need to focus to
succeed. The Journal is a forum through which this focus
can be found."
But, as Handeyside and managing editor John Red
ing, a senior, are quick to stress, the publication is not ex
clusively a journal for international relations majors.
"The Journal is not a departmental journal," said Red
ing, an international relations major.
Instead, it will publish material "from many different
disciplines," so long as the material contains a global
focus.
Reding cited "science, the environment, economics,
anthropology and history" as potential topics for sub
missions to the first issue, which has "Globalization at
the Millennium" as its theme.
The Journal, which Handeyside and Reding hope to
have online in late spring quarter and in print by fall
quarterrwill be published on a quarterly basis and wiH
concentrate on a predetermined theme each quarter.
While the journal will accept submissions from all fac
ulty and students, Handeyside and Reding hope to
maintain an undergraduate focus within the publication.
The bulk of the first issue will likely be funded by the Hu
manities and Sciences Department and will have addi
tional funding coming from other sources, Handeyside

said.
Handeyside, Reding and 15 others founded the jour
nal while Handeyside and Reding were studying at
Moscow last quarter. After noticing that Stanford lacks
an international relations journal, a feature common at
other major universities, Handeyside returned to cam
pus and launched a formal effort to begin the publica
tion.
He styled the journal after similar publications at
Brown and Harvard Universities.
The result was greeted with much enthusiasm by stu
dents, according to Handeyside. "The student commu
nity was very supportive," he said. "We have more stu
dents involved at this point than we can give responsibil
ities to."
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Judith Goldstein, a
co-chair of the Program in International Relations,
agreed.
Students "were very committed," said Goldstein,
who is also a member of the advisory board. "I went to
one meeting where the room was just full of students."
While Handeyside and Reding foresee a bright fu
ture for the journal, they must first overcome the pitfalls
which led to the failure of the Stanford Journal of In
ternational Affairs, a recent unsuccessful attempt at es
tablishing an international relations journal at Stanford.
To this end, both have encouraged a "consistent
cycle of involvement at all class levels," Handeyside
said. "This way, the underclassmen get the involve
ment they need to run the journal in-the future," the
tack of which he said was a cause ol ftfPprevious jour
nal's failure.
With the future of the journal assured, Handeyside
and Reding have grand visions for the publication.
"Hopefully, 20 years from now. 1 can sit down in some
cafe and ask for the Stanford Journal of International
Relations," Handeyside said.
"And hopefully, it'll be there."
