Two men were arrested and one man is still
hospitalized after a Saturday night brawl near
a Phi Delta Theta party.
Palo Alto police arrested Robert Dawson,
19, of San Jose and Ranee Hays. 20. of Palo
Alto, on charges of assault with intent to inflict
great bodily injury. This is considered a felony,
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Apparently. Dawson, Hays, two other men
and a woman had an unfriendly encounter
with another group of people outside the Phi
Delt party. Niemeyer said. Trying to avoid a
fight, Dawson's and Hays' group entered their
car to leave the scene, he said.
The second group followed them out to the
car. One man allegedly proceeded to punch
the driver in the face and neck. Niemeyer said.
At this point, Dawson and Hays allegedly got
out of the car and attacked their pursuers, a
Mountain View man and a man from Goleta,
Calif.
The people involved in the altercation were

not at the Phi Delt party and had nothing to do
with the fraternity, said Phi Delt member
Crosby Grant.
"We still don't know who they were or what
they were doing in the parking lot. Our party
was an invite-only party," Grant said.
One man sustained serious head injuries
and was left unconscious, while the other suf
fered a bruised cheek, Niemeyer said. "The
victims appear to be the instigators."
Dawson and Hays then drove away before
the police arrived. Later that night, the Palo
Alto police spotted the men's car at the corner
of Fabian Street and Charleston Road in Palo
Alto and arrested Dawson and Hays. The two
other men and the woman were released,
Niemever said. Ntyierrt the participants in the
incident was a Stanford student.
Senior Dan Broderick. the Phi Delt presi
dent, emphasized that the fight did not take
place inside the fraternity house and that pre
cautions had been taken to avoid violence.
"We had a security company here checking
IDs. giving out wrist bands and checking for in
vitations." he said.
