"It was a great weekend for
Sehneider," said senior pitcher Jes
sica Schulinan. "Schneider gives us
consistently impressive perfor

mances, so her winning the MVP
award didn't surprise any of us."
On the first day of action, the
Card disposed of two ranked
teams. No. 14 Long Beach State
and No. 17 LICLA.
Against the 49ers, Acosta got
things started in the third inning, as
she singled home Wiginton. In the
top of the seventh, junior pitcher
Marcy Crouch provided a two-run
single. Crouch went the distance
for the Cardinal, allowing five hits
while striking out seven.
Stanford fell behind early 5-0
against the Bruins in the next
game, but came back in the fifth in
ning with five runs on a two-out

rally that included six consecutive
hits and three doubles. UCLA re
gained the lead in the sixth, but
Schneider led off the bottom half of
the inning with a home run, dis
playing the power that has earned
her the nickname "slugger."
The game went into extra in
nings, and Stanford and UCLA
traded runs in the eighth inning.
The Card held the Bruins scoreless
in the top of the ninth, and Acosta
singled home Crouch from second
base in the bottom of the ninth to
give Stanford the victory.

have her best stuff this game, she
displayed tremendous focus and
maturity in battling back from the
early deficit," said Stanford coach
John Rittman.
Stanford continued its solid play
in day two, taking two out of three
games. The Card racked up 12 hits
and Blevins and Schulman held the
Broncos to only three hits as Stan
ford steamrolled Santa Clara 7-0.
Against Eastern Michigan in the
next game, the Card again had
Blevins and Schulman on the
mound. The two combined for a
complete-game shutout. Acosta led
the Cardinal offensively, going 4-
for-4 with a double and an RBI.
"Acosta was on fire against East
ern Michigan." Schulman said. "So
much so that it became contagious."
The Card suffered its first loss of
the season against Louisiana State.
4-1. The game remained scoreless
until the fifth when the Tigers
loaded the bases and brought their
best hitter to the plate, shortstop
Tara Asbill. Crouch worked Asbill
to a full count, but gave the slugger
something to hit on the 3-2 pitch.
Asbill lined to center, clearing
the bases and giving the Tigers a 3-0
lead. Stanford and Louisiana State
exchanged runs in the final two in
nings, giving the Tigers a 4-1 victory.
Crouch (2-1) pitched a complete
game, allowing seven hits while
walking none and whiffing three.
