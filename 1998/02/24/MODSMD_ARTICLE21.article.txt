### Will Flemming Contributing writer 
Going into the Pacific 8 Confer
ence Tournament, the Stanford ice
hockey team wanted nothing more
than a shot at revenge on the USC
Trojans, the regular season champi
ons.

The Trojans had edged out the
Cardinal for the conference crown
and a berth in the American Club
Hockey Association's national tour
nament. In order to set up the
grudge match, all Stanford needed
was a victory over UCLA in the first
round.
And that is just what it got.
After a slow first period in which
the Bruins took a 1-0 lead, the C ard
bounced back and took control of
the game. Early in the second peri
od. sophomore Ben D'Ewart netted
the puck and knotted the game at
one.
Prom that point on, senior cap
tain Evan Asano Ux>k over. Asano
scored two third-period goals and
made sure that Stanford would have
one last shot at USC the following
night.

Unfortunately for the Cardinal, it
ran into red-hot USC goaltender
Wylie Diercks. Time and again.
Diercks made like a brick wall and
stopped golden scoring opportuni
ties.
With the Trojans ahead a goal in
the first period, Stanford defense
man Mike Sloan, a junior, created a
two-on-one opportunity deep in the
USC zone with teammate Asano.
Sloan launched a point-blank wrist
shot that was smothered by Diercks.
"That was a phenomenal play,"
said Stanford coach Rich Fahey.
"That play was indicative of the kind
of game he had — he was on fire,
and wc just couldn't get a bounce."
His outstanding plav was the dif
ference in the championship game
and earned him the tournament's
Most Valuable Flayer Award.
"No matter what we tried, we
couldn't get around him." Fahey
said. "He had a phenomenal night
and deserved the MVP trophy."
For Stanford, the loss was a
somewhat appropriate ending to a
season plagued by inconsistency and
disappointment. For the first time in
four years. Stanford did not win the
Pac-8 regular season title and was
not invited to the season-ending na
tional tournament.
The season was particularly frus
trating for the departing members
of the Stanford team: law student
Brad Helms and seniors Mintak
Joo. Rri ( Yum and Asano.
"It was disappointing to not play
as well as last season, considering
that we had basically the same
amount of talent." Asano said. "But
playing hockey these past three
years has been an extremely re
warding experience. It has been a
great opportunity to play the game I
love at Stanford."
Despite the departure of these
key players. Fahey believes that his
first season as the Stanford coach
was a solid beginning and that the
future of Cardinal hockey is bright.
"It was a learning experience for
the guvs on the team and for my
self." Fahey said. "I have a lot of
ideas 011 how to improve this team
for next season. We had a lot of guys
who worked extremely hard every
time they touched the ice this year,
and that is something you can't
teach."
Many members of the team, in
cluding junior defenseman Paul
Heneman, are already looking for
ward to next season and feel that the
Card has an excellent chance to re
turn the Pac-K trophy to Palo Alto.
"A large core of the team is re
turning next season," Heneman
said. "We have a great shot to win
the Pac-8 title again and to head
back to nationals."
