WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Sunday: No. 5 Stanford 5, No. 3
Duke 3
The defending national champi
on backed up its coach by taking
the title last weekend in Madison.
Wise, after defeating No. 3 Duke 5-
3 in the title match.
"I thought we were underrat
ed," Brennan said. "1 think the No.
5 ranking was something to point
at. and I tried to motivate the team
with that. 1 don't know if it worked,
but it motivated me. We did win
the national championship last

year.
The Cardinal undoubtedly will
be higher than fifth when the new
rankings come out. On its way to
meeting the Blue Devils, the third
seeded Cardinal also downed
Georgia, seeded No. 2 in the draw
and ranked No. 5 along with Stan
ford.
The Cardinal (10-0) extended
its winning streak to 30 dual match
es. dating back to last season. Stan
ford's last loss came a year ago in
the final match of this tournament.
In the championship match,
sophomore Anne Kremer posted a
huge victory over Duke's Vanessa
Webb in the No. 1 singles position.
Kremer earned a straight-set victo
ry over Webb, the No. 7 singles
player in the nation.
"Anne probably played her best
match of the season." Brennan
said.
Senior co-cantain Julie Scot!
dropped the first set to Blue Devil
Kristin Sanderson, but bounded
back strong to notch another Stan
ford win, 3-6, 7-5. 6-0.
Sophomore Teryn Ashley
stayed unbeaten in her Stanford
dual match career, having little
trouble with Karen Goldstein. Ash
ley. tied with Webb in the No. 7 sin
gles spot, rolled to a 6-3. 6-0 tri
umph.
The Cardinal held a decisive
lead heading into doubles by taking
a fourth singles match, thanks to
sophomore Jennifer Heiser. In the
No. 6 position, Heiser defeated
Brooke Seibel in straight sets, 6-2.
6-4.
The Blue Devils got two singles
points at the No. 4 and No. 5 posi
tions. Senior Ania Bleszynski. bat
tling illness, put forth a valiant ef
fort hut could not pull out the win.
Duke's Megan Miller defeated
Bleszynski, 6-4. 1-6. 7-5.
"Ania was sick as a doe," Bren

nan said. "She was really a heroine
for sucking it up and doing her best.
She got a win against Georgia and
almost got one against Duke."
In the No. 5 match, Kathy Sell
earned a Duke win by beating Stan
ford freshman Sarah Pestieau. 7-5,
6-0.
But fortunately for the Cardinal,
Pestieau rebounded in doubles and
clinched the title along with Heiser
in the No. 3 doubles match.
With a 9-7 victory over Sell and
Seibel, the two rookies put the
match out of Duke's reach.
"They really came through very
well." Brennan said. "Jenn was un
defeated for the weekend. Sarah
lost her singles match against Duke,
but she redeemed herself in dou
bles. That is key."
Duke obtained a third point in
the No. 1 doubles match in which
Webb and Goldstein, the No. 3
team in the country, edged No. 14
Ashley and Kremer, 9-7. The No. 2
doubles match was suspended after
the Cardinal clinched.
AgaiiYst the Bulldogs on Satur
day, Georgia's Marissa Caitlin, the

second-ranked singles player in the
country, got a win over Kremer in
the top match. But Stanford took
the rest of the singles matches in
straight sets to move to the final.
In the opening rounds, it was
business as usual for Stanford as the
Cardinal took care of No. 20
Arkansas, 7-1, and No. 12 Ten
nessee, 6-1.
"We were in good shape by the
time we got to Duke," Brennan
said. "We had three matches be
hind us, and we were playing well."
According to Brennan, the tour
nament championship will definite
ly have long-term benefits for the
Cardinal.
"I think it was a good experience
because we learned a lot," Brennan
said. "We are a young team, and we
have some of our veterans playing
in spots that are new to them. There
is a lot of uncharted territory out
there."
The title will have an effect on
NCAA seedings when the Cardinal
begins its quest to defend last sea-
S6n's NCAA championship.
" This is going to help a lot" for

seedings, Brennan said. "We will
not play Duke again, and we will
not play Georgia again. So as long
as we don't totally screw up, we
should stay ahead of them."
Brennan was quick to point out
that the tournament field was not
totally complete. The top-ranked
Gators, whom the Cardinal defeat
ed in last season's NCAA final,
were absent from the draw. Florida
was the last team to beat the Cardi
nal. No. 4 Texas also did not partic
ipate.
"Florida was not there, and
Texas wasn't there," Brennan said.
"We have to keep that in mind. 1
don't think based on this that we
can move ahead of Florida. But No.
1 or No. 2 is fine."
Stanford returns to the regular
dual-match schedule Wednesday
with a home match against St.
Mary's.
The Ciaels are unranked, even in
West Regional rankings. The Car
