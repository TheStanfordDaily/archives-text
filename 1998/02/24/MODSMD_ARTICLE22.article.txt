Duke 3
The defending national champi
on backed up its coach by taking
the title last weekend in Madison.
Wise, after defeating No. 3 Duke 5-
3 in the title match.
"I thought we were underrat
ed," Brennan said. "1 think the No.
5 ranking was something to point
at. and I tried to motivate the team
with that. 1 don't know if it worked,
but it motivated me. We did win
the national championship last

year.
The Cardinal undoubtedly will
be higher than fifth when the new
rankings come out. On its way to
meeting the Blue Devils, the third
seeded Cardinal also downed
Georgia, seeded No. 2 in the draw
and ranked No. 5 along with Stan
ford.
The Cardinal (10-0) extended
its winning streak to 30 dual match
es. dating back to last season. Stan
ford's last loss came a year ago in
the final match of this tournament.
In the championship match,
sophomore Anne Kremer posted a
huge victory over Duke's Vanessa
Webb in the No. 1 singles position.
Kremer earned a straight-set victo
ry over Webb, the No. 7 singles
player in the nation.
"Anne probably played her best
match of the season." Brennan
said.
