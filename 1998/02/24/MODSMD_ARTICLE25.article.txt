five different Bronco pitchers and scored in five of
its eight at-bats.
Since then, the Cardinal pitching arsenal has

today's game against the Broncos should offer an

different Cardinal pitchers.
"It's another good chance to look at some dif
ferent arms and to get ready for Arizona State."
Marquess said. Stanford meets the Sun Devils in
Tempe, Ariz., this weekend.
Yet with the recent bombardment of Cardinal
runs, the Stanford pitching squad might have an
easy afternoon on the mound.
Stanford tallied 23 runs Saturday against the
Bruins, its highest total since April 10, 1995, at
Nevada.
Sophomore outfielder Edmund Muth became
the first Cardinal to hit for the cycle since Steve
