### Gabby Duno Contributing writer

managed to beat out the rain.

MEN'S RUGBY
■ Friday: British Columbia 1 Stan
ford 7
The game, originally scheduled
for Saturday, was played a day early
because of predictions of heavy rain.
Having arrived early to Stanford,
the Canadian team happily agreed
to play a day earlier to secure better
conditions.
Before the game against British
Columbia. Stanford had been hand
ed its first loss of the season to the
top-rated Canadian team, the Uni
versity of Victoria. Disappointed
with its performance in the previous
game, the Cardinal was looking to
bounce back with a win. Things,
however, were not that easy.
Never having beaten either of the
Canadian teams before — coupled
with the fact that British Columbia
was ranked No. 2 in Canada behind
Victoria — clearly made the Card
the underdog.
"We are hoping for an upset,"
Stanford coach Franck Boivert said

before the game.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
British Columbia proved too over
powering. winning the game 19-7.
Sophomore Michael Ceballos
scored the only try of the game for
the Cardinal, while senior kicker
Dave Waiter contributed with a
conversion.
The Cardinal finished the game
with a disappointing performance
after British Columbia capitalized
on Stanford's penalties. The Cana
dian team had only one try during
the game but scored four penalty
kicks in the win.
Boivert thought the penalties
were due to a referee who seemed
"whistle happv." Regardless, Stan
ford had trouble kicking, punting
and holding its line outs.
"It is frustrating to lose a game by
penalties only," Boivert said. "The
players fought hard all along, played
good and courageous defense but
made errors that are to be blamed
011 their inexperience."
The players themselves felt the
frustration of losing for the second
straight time.
"We played a solid game offen
sively and defensively," said sopho
more Eric Groff. "but a couple of
mistakes at critical times made the
difference."
With the loss, the Cardinal falls to
8-2 011 the season. Stanford's next
game comes Thursday against
Brigham Young at Maloney Field.
