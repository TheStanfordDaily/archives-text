# Bilingual ed ideas vary
## Educators say current form works if teachers qualified

Proposition 227, a June ballot
initiative that proposes to end cur
rent bilingual education programs
in California, has come under fire
from bilingual educators and acad
emics.
Ron Unz, the Silicon Valley
businessman, Stanford alumnus
and theoretical physicist by train
ing. drafted the initiative and main
tains that bilingual education waits
too long to introduce literacy skills
to the detriment of limited-English
students.
The theory of bilingual educa
tion is based on research showing
that children with literacy skills in
one language can easily transfer
those skills to a second language.
"It's easier to develop those
skills in your native language," said
visiting Linguistics Prof. Shahrzad
Mahootian. "II a child has to learn
a language orally and learn reading
and writing at the same time, it's
going to be a much slower learning
process.
"You don't want to just bring a
child into the classroom and bom
bard them with English."
Bilingual education also seeks
to ensure that children do not fall
behind grade level in content -
based subjects, which are taught in
their native language as oral profi
ciency in English is developed.
"That's key because you want
the kids to be learning the key con
cepts in math and reading," said
second-grade bilingual education
teacher Chris Neale. Class of '97.
"You don't want them to be behind
grade level."
At the same time, "you really
work on exposing them to oral lan
guage. letting them hear it and par
ticipate in it."he said.
Starting in kindergarten with
bilingual education programs, stu

dents are exposed to between M
minutes and one hour of oral Eng
lish per day. That number then in
creases with every grade level.
"Kids that age are sponges
That's your peak language-learn

ing time." Neale
said. "And the
teachers give it
to them."
In about
third or fourth
grade, when the
students are
fully literate in

their native lan
guage. the literacy skills arc trans
ferred to English, a language thai
they have become orally proficienl
with by this time.
"If you become literate in youi
primary language, you will have th*.
skills that you need." Neale said
"You understand how a languagt
works â€” w hat goes into a sentence
These skills are transferable."
"Transitional bilingual educa
tion is a means to an end of Englis 1
proficiency and academic achieve
ment." said Education Prof. Ken
Hakuta.
"A true bilingual education pn
gram focuses on English languag
development and on English learr
ing." said Maria Cano-Rothwel
principal of Green Oaks Academ
in East Palo Alto "That is the nun
ber one focus."
Another key component o
bilingual education is the mainte
nance of a child's self esteem
Cano-Roth well said.
"You re probably not going t(
be outspoken. You're not going t<
raise your hand or jump into dis
cussions." Mahootian said abou
children who do not feel comfort
able in a classroom due to language
difference.
"Even in monolingual class
