# Bilingual ed ideas vary
## Educators say current form works if teachers qualified 
### Ann kim Staff writer 
Proposition 227, a June ballot
initiative that proposes to end cur
rent bilingual education programs
in California, has come under fire
from bilingual educators and acad
emics.
Ron Unz, the Silicon Valley
businessman, Stanford alumnus
and theoretical physicist by train
ing. drafted the initiative and main
tains that bilingual education waits
too long to introduce literacy skills
to the detriment of limited-English
students.
The theory of bilingual educa
tion is based on research showing
that children with literacy skills in
one language can easily transfer
those skills to a second language.
"It's easier to develop those
skills in your native language," said
visiting Linguistics Prof. Shahrzad
Mahootian. "II a child has to learn
a language orally and learn reading
and writing at the same time, it's
going to be a much slower learning
process.
"You don't want to just bring a
child into the classroom and bom
bard them with English."
Bilingual education also seeks
to ensure that children do not fall
behind grade level in content -
based subjects, which are taught in
their native language as oral profi
ciency in English is developed.
"That's key because you want
the kids to be learning the key con
cepts in math and reading," said
second-grade bilingual education
teacher Chris Neale. Class of '97.
"You don't want them to be behind
grade level."
At the same time, "you really
work on exposing them to oral lan
guage. letting them hear it and par
ticipate in it."he said.
Starting in kindergarten with
bilingual education programs, stu

dents are exposed to between M
minutes and one hour of oral Eng
lish per day. That number then in
creases with every grade level.
"Kids that age are sponges
That's your peak language-learn

ing time." Neale
said. "And the
teachers give it
to them."
In about
third or fourth
grade, when the
students are
fully literate in

their native lan
guage. the literacy skills arc trans
ferred to English, a language thai
they have become orally proficienl
with by this time.
"If you become literate in youi
primary language, you will have th*.
skills that you need." Neale said
"You understand how a languagt
works â€” w hat goes into a sentence
These skills are transferable."
"Transitional bilingual educa
tion is a means to an end of Englis 1
proficiency and academic achieve
ment." said Education Prof. Ken
Hakuta.
"A true bilingual education pn
gram focuses on English languag
development and on English learr
ing." said Maria Cano-Rothwel
principal of Green Oaks Academ
in East Palo Alto "That is the nun
ber one focus."
Another key component o
bilingual education is the mainte
nance of a child's self esteem
Cano-Roth well said.
"You re probably not going t(
be outspoken. You're not going t<
raise your hand or jump into dis
cussions." Mahootian said abou
children who do not feel comfort
able in a classroom due to language
difference.
"Even in monolingual class


rooms, those kids without strong
communication skills are not called
on by the teacher and not considered
as smart by the other children," she
said.
Neale said that he always works
to make sure his students feel com
fortable learning English. "I don't
want any anxiety which interferes
with the learning process," he said.
"Kids like to be right and do
things well," he said. "And when
they have trouble, it makes them
somewhat ashamed."
The amount of time it takes for a
child to become proficient in acade
mic English under bilingual educa
tion varies widely. Educators and re
searchers have cited anywhere from
two to eight years.

Mahootian emphasized that the
amount of time is different for dif
ferent students. "There are a lot of
variables at work: personal, emo
tional as well as academic learning
style differences."
Though bilingual education oppo
nents have disagreed with the
amount of time such programs allot
for learning English, Neale pointed
out that "it doesn't mean a student is
sitting in a completely Spanish
speaking environment for ten years."
Even after many years, students
may not "grasp the subtleties," he
said, such as the difference between
"good" and "well."
A difficulty that bilingual educa
tion faces when implemented is find
ing enough teachers who have been
properly trained in the teaching
methods.
"A bilingual education program
must have a credentialed bilingual

teacher," Cano-Rothwell said. "You
can't have a successful program
without the teachers."
"I think the language of instruc
tion does matter," Hakuta said, "but
part of why it matters is getting
teachers who understand the kids'
situations better."
"The usefulness of bilingual edu
cation has to do with the kinds of
teachers it uses."
But in a state where credentialed
teachers of any subject are difficult
to come by, bilingual education can
not always be implemented accord
ing to theory.
Opponents of Proposition 227
argue that Unz has focused on the
wrong aspect of the problem.
"How do we fix bilingual educa
tion in California?" asked Kelly
Hayes-Raitt, director of the "No on
llnz" campaign. "More teachers,
more accountability, more commu

nity involvement.
"And what does Ron Unz say
about that? Let's sue the teachers,
let's ignore accountability and let's
destroy community involvement."
Unz, however, sees the problem of
teacher shortages as further evidence
that bilingual education must go.
"Bilingual education is so impos
sible to implement, it's so impossible
to find the teachers, that they only
implement it for 30 percent of limit
ed-English students," he said.
A local preschool bilingual edu
cation teacher, who asked to remain
anonymous, also disagreed with the
separation of limited-English stu
dents from other students under
bilingual education programs.
"It alienates you if you stay in a
group instead of mixing, and stay in
your own culture," she said.
"We live in America for heaven's
sake. English is the language."
