### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
While a violin, piano and cello
trio played Mendelssohn. Kimball
residents gathered last night with
Nobel laureates for a reception and
dinner. Five Nobel Prize winners
were in attendance.
Organized by junior Matthew
Fei. head academic adviser for Kim
ball. the reception and dinner was in
tended to introduce undergraduate
students to some of the most re
spected members of the Stanford
faculty. Economics Profs. Kenneth

Arrow and William Sharpe. Chem
istry Prof. Henry Taube and Physics
Profs. Richard Taylor and Arthur
Schawlow talked to students about
both their fields and their lives.
"I was hoping that it would be a
good chance for exciting people to
talk to groups of interested stu
dents." Fei said. "It's a good chance
for undergraduates to meet the bril
liant minds on campus."
Fei, along with Kimball Resident
Fellow John Riekford. commented
that last night's gathering continued
the Kimball tradition established
several years ago to bring Nobel lau

reates into the dormitory. Earlier in
the year. Kimball brought in this
year s physics prize-winner, Steven
Chu. to talk to a large group of stu
dents.
"It's a fabulous opportunity for
the students because when you talk
about achievements of the mind, the
Nobel Prize is considered the pinna
cle of excellence." Riekford com
mented.
The conversation over dinner
was relaxed, as groups of undergrad
uates chatted with the laureates
about subjects both inside and out
side their fields of expertise.

Several of the professors joked
about how they had won the prize
Schawlow. who received the Nobel
Prize in physics for his work with
laser spectroscopy. joked. "You wet
one of those prize sweepstakes in the
mail. . . . "You ma\ have won a
Nobel Prize!' "
Taylor told a stor\ about his earls
academic experiences in high school
and college commenting that
"What's important is to be luck\. not
smart.
ou have to be in the neht place
at the right time," he said.
Taylor received the prize as a new
member of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center for the discovery of
quarks.
When asked the impact that win
ning the prize had on his life and
work. Arrow commented, "It
doesn 't affect 95 percent of your life.
When vou're engaged in scholarlv

argument there is no difference. No
body would say that it's not nice to
win — they would be ridiculous if
they did."
Most students ate with professors
outside of their own areas of inter
ests. Matt Craven, a Kimball fresh
man sitting with Arrow said, "I
thought that he would be interested
in talking about his field, but we
talked about the situation in Iraq
and many other things."
Students seemed to come away
from the evening with a positive im
pression of the professors and the

down-to-earth conversation that
went on during the evening.
Fei commented that next year
Kimball may invite a smaller group
of prize winners so that each could
give a brief presentation on his work.
Aaron Greenfield, a freshman
and prospective major in the sci
ences, sat with Taube who won the
prize for his work on the mecha
nisms of electron transfer reactions.
"It was a good experience,"
Greenfield said. "Never again in my
life will I be able to sit down to din
ner with five Nobel laureates."
