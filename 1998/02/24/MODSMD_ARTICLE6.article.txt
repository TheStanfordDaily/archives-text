Dishes in the hallway. Trash on ihe floor. Crowded computer clusters
Lively lounges. Visitors to the University can now see the other side of
Stanford's famous academic world â€” its dormitories.
Yesterday marked the inauguration ot weekly dorm tours, which will
lead prospective freshmen and their families through Florence Mix>re
Hall. 553 Mayfield and Toy on Hall.
According to Rave Leigh Marion, manager of visitor information, the
new tour was organized in response to many inquiries hy curious prospec
tive freshmen about campus housing. While most other colleges include
one dorm stop in their general tour. Stanford's does not even go near a
dormitory.
Adding one visit onto an already packed tour, however, w as not an op
tion for Marion. " That is not the ideal way to showcase Stanford housing
because it is so diverse." she said

To capture this diversity, Marion worked \Mth Housing and Dininji
Services to creatc a tour that showcased the many different aspects of res
idential life.
As one tour guide, junior Paul Bodnar explained. Flo Mo is new. Toyon
is old and 553 is a Row house.
The tours also allow visitors to see a more personal side of Stanford life.
According to tour guide Tristan Sorah-Reyes. a senior, participants in the
general tour very seldom talk to students other than their guide.
Yesterday, however, prospective freshman Ryan James of Vancouver.
Wash., and his parents spoke to students in their dorm riH>ms. computer
cluster and lounge areas.
Additionally. Sorah-Reyes explained aspects of student life in a much
more hands-on approach than the general tour allows. Walking through
Flo Mo's cafeteria. 553's kitchen and Toyon s eating clubs, she expound
Ed on campus food.
Moving down the halls of Flo
Mo, she explained residential edu
cation and the importance of RAs.
In Toyon, she specified on dorm
society, the white boards on the
walls and room cleanliness. Out
side the dorms, she discussed the
proliferation of bicycles.
Flo Mo, 553 and Toyon each
gave Sorah-Reyes information, but
she decided for herself what she
wanted to discuss and highlight.
l our organizers hoped that vis
itors would feel a connection to
residential life. Yesterday's tour
had the desired effect even for stu
dents like James who list Stanford
as their top choice. He said, "It
makes me want to go here even

more."
The tour is the innovative work
of Marion, who proposed the idea
to Housing and Dining Services.
The presence of visitors inside dor
mitories created a concern for stu
dent privacy.
However, no individual dorm
rooms are on the tour, and tour
guides stay in public areas unless
they obtain permission from room
inhabitants.
The dorm tour is the only win
ter-quarter tour designed specifi
cally for prospective freshmen.
Because it is processing applica
tions, the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions does not offer in
formation sessions or general tours
specifically for freshmen.
Visitor Services also has added a
cart tour to its programs. For $5,
visitors can tour the campus on a
golf cart.
