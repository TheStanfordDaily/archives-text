Megan's I.aw upheld
WASHINGTON (A I*) I lie Supreme Coin I
rejected a double-jeopardy challenge yesterday to
Megan's Law, the New Jersey measure that requires
authorities to tell communities the whereabouts of
convicted sex offenders.
I he court also turned away a similar attack on the
Megan's Law enacted by New York's Legislature a
year later.
Although the actions did not directly affect similar
laws adopted in 35 other states, they were welcomed
as a major victory for proponents of such measures.
The court, acting without comment in two sepa
rate cases, turned awav arguments by sex offenders
in New Jersey and New York that the respective
laws' notification provisions violate their I ifth
Amendment's protection against being punished
twice for the same crime. I hey argued that the noli
fication and the public reaction it generates amount
to punishment.
"The lawsuit we fought so hard to win is over."
exulted New Jersey Attorney General Peter
Verniero. " I he main challenge to Megan's Law is
now concluded."
Community notifications began in New Jersey
lasi month.
But the issue is not finally decided.
Michael Buncher. a si;itc public defender. s;iid the
next federal challenge to Megan's Law will contend
that community notification violates personal priva
cy rights.
"We are claiming that the kind of information
that is disseminated ... is ... constitutionally pro
tected, and it should not be disseminated." he s;iid.
Hie Neyv Jersey layv. enacted in 1995. was named

for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old girl who was raped
and murdered in IW4 by a twice-convicted sex
offender who lived across the street from her home.
Jesse Timmendequas has been sentenced to death
for the crime.
