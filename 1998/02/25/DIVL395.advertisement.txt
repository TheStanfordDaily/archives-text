AT DARTMOUTH
The Tuck Business Bridge Program
June 22 —July 17, 1998

Are you a Stanford senior starting on a business career after graduation?
Are you a junior contemplating such a track? Or perhaps you're not
sure....
After a successful inaugural year, the Amos Tuck School of Business
Administration at Dartmouth College will open its campus for the second
time of a select group of juniors and seniors from top liberal arts colleges
for a four-week residential summer program designed and taught by
Tuck MBS faculty and our corporate partners.
The program will introduce Stanford students to the excitement of a
management career and help them develop the practical, marketable,
analytical business skills to start on the path to a first-class business
career. Applications are now available.
The Tuck School at Dartmouth cordially invites you to attend our
information session:
Date: Wednesday, February 25, 1998
Time: 12:00 Noon — 1:00pm
Place: Sweet Hall — Room 403
