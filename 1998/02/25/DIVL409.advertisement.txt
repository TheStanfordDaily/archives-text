Because a job description should
describe a job you actually want to do.
At Homestead Technologies, a division of KartoffelSoft, you write
your own job description. We understand that you'll do a better
job if you're doing what you choose to do. So if we hire you, your
job description is pretty much that.
Figure out exactly how you'll be most productive, then do it. We
want you to come here and love your job. Because creating
good software is like creating anything else. The more you put
into it, the better it turns out. Join the Homestead team now.
Of course your first job will be unforgettable. At Homestead,
it'll be for the right reasons.
Homestead Technologies has openings
in a variety of fields, including:
* Development * Marketing
