# Row residents contend with potential turnover to Greeks
## 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
From petitions to no response at all, house residents have shown mixed

reactions to possibly being replaced by Greeks

next year.
Both ZAP and Muwekma-Tah-

Ruk residents have circulated

petitions to keep from los

ing their houses.
"You

wouldn't

want

to get kicked out of your home," explained Nvsa Lane, a senior who helped
with the Muwekma petition.
The petition, posted in all cooperative houses for two days, garnered ap
proximately 250 signatures. ( o-op residents — with a 70 percent signature
rate — accounted for IS9 of the signers.
Members of the newly formed Interco-op Council posted the petition
and encouraged signing. "Since we were a unified body of students, we de

cided we could help them." said council member Bez Walton, a sopho
more.

Despite all the community action, however, Muwekma
petitioners were surprisingly silent when it came to talk

ing to the press. Many residents refused to com
ment.

"They wanted to keep the matter fair
ly amenable with the administration
who they're still negotiating with."
Lane explained.
As of now, Muwekma rep
resentatives are meeting with admin
istration over a Muwekma housing
proposal. Vince Fuentez. a leader of
the group, said the Muwekma com
munity would release a prepared
statement to the press next week.
Jane Camarillo, director of
residential education, was not avail
able for comment.
ZAP residents are hoping to
get the same amount of attention
Muwekma has garnered.
Their residents' initiative to
keep the house non-Greek was
signed hv 50 of ZAP's 54 residents.
Of the nonsigners. three were Greek.
()n the other hand, at least three sign
ers were Greek.
"If [fraternities or sororities]
get thrown into Cowell. they'll com
pletely dissolve the social structure,"
said junior Geoffrey Gaisford. "It's a
really loose group."
According to Gaisford.
ZAP residents submitted their peti
tion to three administrators last
Tuesday and asked for a meeting. No
administrator has yet responded to
their request.
"I think students are p r etty
clueless about the whole prixress."
said senior Blake Harris, a resident
