# Row residents contend with potential turnover to Greeks
## 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
From petitions to no response at all, house residents have shown mixed

reactions to possibly being replaced by Greeks

next year.
Both ZAP and Muwekma-Tah-

Ruk residents have circulated

petitions to keep from los

ing their houses.
"You

wouldn't

want

to get kicked out of your home," explained Nvsa Lane, a senior who helped
with the Muwekma petition.
The petition, posted in all cooperative houses for two days, garnered ap
proximately 250 signatures. ( o-op residents — with a 70 percent signature
rate — accounted for IS9 of the signers.
Members of the newly formed Interco-op Council posted the petition
and encouraged signing. "Since we were a unified body of students, we de

cided we could help them." said council member Bez Walton, a sopho
more.

Despite all the community action, however, Muwekma
petitioners were surprisingly silent when it came to talk

ing to the press. Many residents refused to com
ment.

"They wanted to keep the matter fair
ly amenable with the administration
who they're still negotiating with."
Lane explained.
As of now, Muwekma rep
resentatives are meeting with admin
istration over a Muwekma housing
proposal. Vince Fuentez. a leader of
the group, said the Muwekma com
munity would release a prepared
statement to the press next week.
Jane Camarillo, director of
residential education, was not avail
able for comment.
ZAP residents are hoping to
get the same amount of attention
Muwekma has garnered.
Their residents' initiative to
keep the house non-Greek was
signed hv 50 of ZAP's 54 residents.
Of the nonsigners. three were Greek.
()n the other hand, at least three sign
ers were Greek.
"If [fraternities or sororities]
get thrown into Cowell. they'll com
pletely dissolve the social structure,"
said junior Geoffrey Gaisford. "It's a
really loose group."
According to Gaisford.
ZAP residents submitted their peti
tion to three administrators last
Tuesday and asked for a meeting. No
administrator has yet responded to
their request.
"I think students are p r etty
clueless about the whole prixress."
said senior Blake Harris, a resident

Residents of Muwekma-Tah-Ruk recently began a petition to save their house from being re-allocat
ed to a Greek organization.
assistant.
His house, 557 Mayfield. has not
filed a petition.
"It's only been three years since
the Betas were here, so we didn't
have much time to get a name and es
tablish ourself." Harris said. "We're
just a number."
However, he was quick to add he
was not happy about his house po
tentially changing over to Greek
hands.
"It's prime real estate and I wish
the IJ n iversity would real i/e t hat and
let more non-Greek students live in
premier housing." Harris said.
Durand resident assistant Meghvi

Meheta. a coterminal student, ex
pressed more apathy.
"It's going to be someone's home
next year. tix>." he said.
Durand also has not taken any di
rect action to oppose turning Greek
next year.
"There are lots more things more
important in the world than what
houses are going Greek." Meheta
said.
"There are people on the other
side of the world that are getting gas
masks out."
However. Harris felt that houses
turning Greek was an important
issue for campus.
"Overall, sororities being housed
is a good thing," he said. "One of the
Row houses knows that it's just going
to die."

"Dying" is not an option greeted
well by many.
"Overall, there's been this dis
eouragement of being in more spe
cialized communities, and this is an
other example of that," Lane said.
(iaistord feared Greek replace
ments might not promote University
ideals well, citing possible homopho
bia and ethnic disparity.
However, he held Greeks were
important to the Stanford social
scene.
"1 don't think any more houses
should go Greek, but I'm not against
sororities being housed." Gaisford
said.
"(More Greeks] will definitely
change the dynamic of the Row,"
Harris said. "It'll really be an inter
esting process to watch."
