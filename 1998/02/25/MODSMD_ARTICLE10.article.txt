UNITED NATIONS (AP)
Secretary-General koti Annan
briefed the Security Council yes
terday on his weapons inspection
agreement with Iraq, emerging
with "a general sense of approval"
although some details remain to be
worked out.
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richard
son agreed, saving: "We believe
clarifications in some of the lan
guage."
The council did not immediate
ly make a decision on the accord
struck by Annan in a visit to Bagh
dad — an agreement he called "a
victory for the United Nations."
"I am pleased to tell you that I
had a general sense of approval
from the membership as to the
agreement that I signed in Bagh
dad." Annan said.
"Obviously, there are details
that have to be worked out."
Richardson said it could take a
few days to get the clarifications
the United States is looking for.
Some concerns he cited were that

the U.N. Special Commission,
which oversees inspections, main
tain a pre-eminent role and that a
clause in the accord acknowledg
ing respect for Iraqi sovereignty
not be used as an excuse to avoid
its obligations.
British Ambassador John West
on said his government also was
seeking some clarifications, but
woyld not elaborate

I he I Jnited States, distrustful of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
said it wants to ensure that there
are no loopholes in the deal that
Saddam may use to his advantage.
Annan, however, said this
agreement is different from others
"We have to remember that in
the years that the U.N. has been
present in Baghdad, mam agree
ments have been signed, but
this one was negotiated with the
president himself. And the leadet
ship has got the message that he
wants cooperation, he wants it
done."

The secretary-general had been
upbeat this morning going into the
closed Security Council meeting.
Legally, the accord does not
require Security Council approval,
but politically it would be difficult
to proceed without it.
"I think we have a good agree
ment, an agreement that I will
defend anywhere, and I'm sure the
jpiember states wquld atyept it.'.'

"There were millions of people
around the world rooting for
peace." Annan told the whistling

"That is why I sa\ you should
never underestimate the power of
prayer."
Annan thanked President Clin

peacekeepers — I N. peacekeep
ers in the sense that we taught our
peacekeepers that the best way to
use force is to show it in order not
to have to use it."
