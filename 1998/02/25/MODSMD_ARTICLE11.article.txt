## Editorial Ruckus on the Row 
### 
Inform students about
housing decisions to
prevent misinformation
PANIC OVER THE possibili
ty of losing coveted houses to
sororities and fraternities has
incited a ruckus on the Row.
Concerned students who don't
want to see their beloved self-ops go
the way sorority houses did in the
1940s are circulating petitions in an
effort to save them.
However, much of the uproar is
based on the lack of substantive
intormalionrj'rrrrjj'jij-r jut-ibb I
Residential Educationl
- chosen not to clarify the selec
tion process, the rumor mill is alive
and well.
Students have been reduced to
pure speculation in trying to predict
which Row houses are the next to
go.
The dearth of information can
produce unfavorable consequences
and misconceptions.
For example, the petition circu
lated on behalf of Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk. the Native American theme
house, contained several erroneous
facts.
Sorority houses are. in fact,
required to have disability access.
All of this misinformation and
panic is exacerbated by the fact that

students have no access to the actu
al criteria that will be used when
Res Ed makes its decision.
Students can only surmise that
the administration hasn't shared its
selection criteria because they may
be of questionable character.
Until the community is able to
be more informed about the pro
cess. Row residents will under
standably be clamoring to garner
as much support as possible in
preparation for March 2, the date
the housing decisions will be
announced.
Res Ed will only find itself in a
tighter corner the longer it waits out
the situation in silence.
i f As student mobilization and peti
tions mount, Jane Camarillo's office
will only find it harder to de-house
students without causing great out
cries of unfairness. A more trans
parent process will facilitate the
planned re-housing of fraternities
and sororities on the Row.
Anything less will only add to stu
dent housing grievances.
In light of all the controversial
housing changes proposed in recent
University history, the administra
tion has much to lose if it ignores
the students' pleas for more insight
into a process which directly affects
them.
To avoid further contagion of
false information and rumors, we
urge Res Ed to speak out and clari
fv the situation now.
