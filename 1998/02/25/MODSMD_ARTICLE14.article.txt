## Western economic solutions 
### 
Lately, the
financial crises of
several Asian
countries have received a
ton of press. Investors
have panicked,
economists have debated,
and experts have analyzed
lhe current situation.

Although encompassing a plethora of view
points, reports nearly all concur that phe
nomenal growth of industry and develop
ment preceded and contributed to the crisis.
However, one factor many analy
ses is that it takes more than**irtdustry" and
to become an international
power.
Let's compare this to a classic example
from our own beloved Bay Area. About
150 years ago. in the wake of the Gold
Rush, an industrial center was established
in northern California. Its contribution to
industry in the area was so outstanding that
to this day it is known with pride as "South
San Francisco: THE INDUSTRIAL
CITY."
Over time, a city grew to the north that
not only had industry hut also professional
baseball and football teams. The city also
had a plurality of ethnic neighborhoods and
a reputation for tolerance of alternative
lifestyles. After long discussion, there was
still no consensus on what to name this
resilient city. Then one day, someone sug
gested naming the city based on its geo
graphic position, "Why don't we just call
this city to the north ... San Francisco!"
And lo and behold, San Francisco

became a fully developed, culturally vibrant
international city. And few people outside
the Bay Area have ever heard of its prede
cessor, South San Francisco. Phis simple
example demonstrates once again that the
ory does not always hold against the facts,
as in the case of gravity versus. " The Mys
tery Spot" in Santa Cruz.
Thus, the key to revitalizing damaged
economies on the Pacific Rim cannot be
accomplished by industry alone. The solu
tion is to adopt I he Great American Model
of Development®, a model based on the
idea of Gratuitous Consumption Holidays
(GCH®). These are events designed for.the
sole pur pose of fostering local and national
industries. You all know exactly what I'm
talking about. Just turn on the radio to hear
some of the newest GCH — "Come cele
brate National Sports Utility Vehicle
Month ... National Wine Cooler Week ...
National Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese
Day," etc.
Over time some of these holidays
became celebrated religiously throughout
the country following the Great American
Model of Development ... after all. what
flower company could survive without
Valentine's Day? What would costume
manufacturers do without Halloween?
Would anyone buy plastic turkeys without
Thanksgiving? These holidays have such a
mammoth impact on the U.S. economy that
even GDP growth figures are statistically
evened out to calculate for the enormity of
purchases during the Christmas holiday sea
son.
Screw comparative advantage! Forget

monetary policy! Ditch the World Bank!
Simply having a variety of GCH®can foster
even the most obscure industries. Just imag
ine the possibilities for transplanting this
brilliant strategy for GDP growth to revive
an economy in crisis. Economies around the
world would rebound instantly with the
introduction of Gratuitous Consumption
Holidays (i.e.. National Strip Mining
Month. National Pocky Sticks Week. etc.).
All this targeting of specific industry doesn't
even mention the BONUS economic
growth of sectors complementing consump
tion holidays (i.e., the greeting card indus
try. the parcel delivery industry, etc.)
Of course, the penultimate success story
is in blending consumption with sports.
Question: What team always wins the
Super Bowl?
Answer Corporate America! Got noth
ing better to do with a million bucks? How
about a 30-second television slot in the sec
ond quarter? Who won't be watching? Who
doesn't bet on Bud Bowl? Who even watch
es anything other than the commercials?
All of this leads us to the conclusion that
Asian economic ministers interested in long
-term growth in real GDP should forget
about foolish short-term plans like IMF
bailouts and currency devaluation. Instead,
they should start to seriously consider a
GCH strategy in unison with large corpo
rate-sponsored sports festivals.
