Greek housing meets
Res Ed's goals
In response to Aly Remtulla's Feb. 23
column, I would like to extol the benefits of
the Greek system over residential educa
tion. Res Ed attempts to foster a sense of
community, academia, service and an
enriching social atmosphere in campus resi
dences. Occasionally this is accomplished.
However, many times it is not due to the
plain and simple fact that the residents did
not choose to live with one another.
As a resident of a house of 35 people, I
have observed the sad truth that our house
is completely divided hy Draw groups. It is
hard to feel a sense of community when
there are six subgroups within it.
The Greek system, however, is a true
community of sisters and brothers. In terms
of academics, the fact that sorority sisters
have on average a higher grade point aver
age than other students on campus should
speak for itself. Service is an integral part of
each and every sorority and fraternity on
campus, together raising thousands of dol
lars for causes such as children's cancer
research, battered women and literacy pro
grams.
How often have you seen the residents
of C'asa Italiana devote their entire week
end to work at a carwash to raise money for
such a cause? And whether Mr. Remtulla

would like to acknowledge it or not, the
Greek system provides the primary social
outlet for the entire campus.
The solution is not to de-house all
(ireeks, but rather to recognize how benefi
cial they are to our University. The Greek
system successfully meets the goals Res Ed
tries so hard to attain.
I li/alu-th (iinha
./unior, psychology
Greek life entails col
lective responsibility
Dan Geyser's thoroughly repugnant let
ter. ostensibly supporting the Greek system,
clearly reflects the fact that he is not a mem
ber of a (ireek chapter and has no idea what
the actual benefits of fraternities and soror
ities are. While Aly Remtulla's Monday col
umn and Marc Bell's letter yesterday, offer
extremely inaccurate portrayals of the
Greek community at Stanford, at least they
deserve a response.
When deciding where to live, students
should have the opportunity to choose
among as many housing options as possible.
While not for everyone, housed Greek
chapters provide many Stanford students
with a remarkable college experience.
As long as there continues to be a strong
demand for Greek housing, fraternity and
sorority houses deserve to be among the

housing options students have.
Although Remtulla argues that the cost
of fraternity membership results in discrim
ination based on socioeconomic class, in
reality, housed fraternities are often cheap
er than other types of University housing.
The Greek community that exists at
Stanford today is not the Greek system that
exists at many other college campuses, nor
is it the Cireek system that existed at Stan
ford 40 years ago.
Stanford has become much more open
and accepting over the years, and its frater
nities and sororities have evolved with it.
While Greek chapters, like other Stanford
organizations, have room for improvement,
they are strong and growing stronger.
Because we are able to select our own
members, we are held to a high standard of
collective responsibility. As those chapters
that have recently lost their housing will
attest, chapters are fully accountable for the
safety of their members and guests.
Housed chapters are also regularly eval
uated by residential education to ensure
that they achieve the goals of Res Fd just
like other Stanford residences. "Extensive
programming" is very much a part of
housed Greek chapters.
For 15 years, a "grandfather clause" has
been in effect at Stanford allowing only a
handful of specific fraternities to occupy
University housing. Now based on the rec
ommendations of the Greek Task Force
Report, all Greek organizations, including
sororities and ethnically-based chapters.

have the opportunity to apply for housing.
Not only does this promote greater
diversity and equity in the Greek system,
but it makes the system more competitive,
ensuring that only very strong chapters
occupy University housing.
Of the 27 Greek organizations on cam
pus, only six are currently housed. This
number will likely increase slightly in the
near future.
However, the University is committed to
making Greek housing one of many hous
ing options, not the only option. As Rem
tulla suggests, some Row houses (though
not theme houses or co-ops) may be given
to Greek chapters.
Row houses make sense for some frater
nities and sororities in the same way that
Row houses make sense for co-ops and
theme houses. However, the University is
committed to providing a diverse and bal
anced array of housing options.
Remtulla is correct in asserting that
"many alumni pressure the administration
to continue the Greek system." The fact
that so many Greek alumni care deeply that
fraternities and sororities remain an option
for students speaks strongly to the positive
experiences they had.
Nonetheless, Greek chapters continue to
exist at Stanford not because of the influ
ence of alumni, but because of the benefits
they provide to their members and to the
Stanford community. Greek chapters host a
wide variety of large-scale charity events,
such as Theta Breakers, Sigma Phi

Epsilon's Casino Night and Chi Omega's
Pink and Black Evening. These events raise
thousands of dollars for community organi
zations.
The Interfraternity and Intersorority
Councils regularly sponsor programs that
address issues relevant to all students,
including last night's panel discussion with
Drew Barrymore.
And, as Remtulla points out, Greek
chapters at Stanford hold social events that
are usually free and open to the entire stu
dent body.
Friendship, not "keg parties," is the
essence of being Greek. Housed fraternities
offer the unique experience at Stanford of
being able to live with a large group of close
friends for more than one year. These
friends create one of the most supportive
living environments available at Stanford. It
is little surprise that alumni who have had
the opportunity to live in housed chapters
are committed to supporting Stanford and
the Greek system.
