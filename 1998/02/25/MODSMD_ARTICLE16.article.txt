# Walking away from a dream
## 
### 
Chances are that you or one of your friends is involved in community service
in East Palo Alto. Stanford students do everything from teaching dance to
organizing environmental cleanups in the community. But to what extent do
these activities benefit East Palo Alto residents? Community members, students and
organizers are concerned that students don't understand the implications of service.
They may construct projects that sound worthwhile, but fail to meet community
needs. It service relationships are to succeed, students should examine their values and
motivations while undertaking service projects.

/ 112 I give all I possess to the
I poor and surrender my body
JL to the flames, but have not
love, I gain nothing." (1 Corinthians
13:3).
It's hard to say goodbye to a dream.
But I did it. 1 walked away from a
year's worth of sweat, tears and hope.

At the beginning of this school year, I decided to quit
a community service organization that I had started. I
walked away from my dream.
Last year, I had a grand vision of getting engineer
ing students excited about community service. A
vision of computer science majors surfing the Web
with kids in East Palo Alto. A vision of mechanical
engineers rediscovering the joy of LEGOs and Lin
coln Logs. A vision of electrical engineers walking
hand-in-hand with Dario, Julio, Edgar, Maria,
Guadalupe and a thousand other sweet, precious chil
dren.
Thus, Scientists & Engineers for Public Outreach
(SEPO) was born.
From the initial threads of a dream came phone
calls, e-mails, fliers and paperwork. We held our first
organizational meeting. We made our first trip to
Plugged-In, a nonprofit computing center in East Palo
Alto. We started going there twice a week.
We brought five jumping carloads of children to
Stanford for a scavenger hunt. We secured ASSU
Community Service Board funding. We began plan
ning a project to bring laptop computers and tutoring
into area schools. We became affiliated with the Haas
Center for Public Service. My vision took shape
before my eyes.
But I walked away.
Shortly bctbre school began this year. 1 deiHdfcd to
flfep down as president of SEPO. 1 On' some 1 level, it
didn't make sense. We were touching the lives of some
beautiful children. After the craziness of our first year,
we were just beginning to hit our stride. We had
potential. And I had invested so much of myself in it.
Or had I? Digging deeper, 1 caught a glimpse of
something dark within. I came face-to-face with my

own motives, my own pride. What was it that I real
ly wanted?

I discovered something very frightening
more than anything else I desired glory, power
and prestige.
I coveted awards, praise and greatness in
the eyes of others. 1 thought often about the
James W. Lyons Award for Service. I want
ed to see myself in The Daily, in Wired mag
azine, in Newsweek. SEPO was a means to
that end.
But there was something even more sub
tle at work. Somehow, I believed that service
and leadership were things that 1 owned,
things that I possessed. I believed that I was
the answer to someone else's need. That I
possessed something others lacked. That I
had the power to give knowledge, hope, joy,
life, technology and meaning to someone
else's life.
I found within me a form of pride that
said. "1 give to those in want. I'm making the
world a better place. This makes me a better

person, right?" My pride asserted authority over those
who didn't engage in service, those who didn't serve as
well I did and those precious children whom I claimed
to serve.
1 had no love. Looking inside, 1 saw only pride, self
ishness and pain. So I said "goodbye" to my dream.
When Jesus' disciples desired greatness. He gath
ered them around and told them that those who
changed and became like little children would be the
greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
I have been praying. For love. For humility. For
true service. And though I've tasted bits and pieces of
it while tutoring a boy named Randy and meeting with
my small group, I've got a long way to go. I expect to
be on my knees for a lifetime.
Asking, hoping, trying and waiting to live a life that
admits, "Yeah, I'm just a child, like everyone else. I,
too, am hungry for love, belonging, meaning, warmth
and joy in a world unable to provide them. I'm no bet
ter than anyone else. I'll share what precious little I've
been given. It's all I can do. I hope that's okay."
