# What are you doing in East Palo Alto?
## Collaborating for success 
### 
/ "W T HY" IS THE most important question
%/%/ you can ask yourself when considering
T T working in East Palo Alto or any com
munity.
What is driving me to do this work, and for whose
benefit am I doing it? Am I trying to benefit myself,
the community, or both? What do 1 expect the bene
fits to be?
As a native of East Palo Alto who has spent many
years as a community activist, I have witnessed inter
actions between East Palo Alto and Stanford.
East Palo Alto residents comprise a significant
portion of the nonacademic work force on campus.
Many students live in the East Palo Alto commu
nity. And Stanford-initiated projects have been
implemented in East Palo Alto.
Yet, Stanford-initiated projects do not always
take East Palo Alto's needs and goals into consider
ation. People that work for these programs some
times see their work as "humanitarian aid."
In those cases, the relationship between East Palo
Alto and Stanford has been unilateral and uncooper
ative, but also interdependent.
In this respect, the relationship between the two
communities mirrors society as a whole. Lack of sub
stantive communication leads to the reinforcement
of old stereotypes.
This worsens marginalization and expands the
ever-widening gap between the rich and poor. The
resulting relationships are tenuous, superficial and
noncollaborative.
Like many East Palo Alto and East Menlo Park
residents, 1 work on the Stanford campus.
The program I work for.the Committee on Black
Performing Arts, would probably not exist had it not
been for the struggle for quality education that took
place in East Palo Alto during the 1960s and '70s.

The Mothers for Equal Education (MEE)
the Nairobi Day Schools and Nairobi Col
lege led this fight on a local level.

Their efforts were consid
ered a

model for action and development on a national
level.
These and similar efforts affected the Stanford
campus directly and led to the hiring of more black
faculty.
This increased the enrollment of black students
and inspired them to develop programs such as
African and Afro-American Studies and the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts. East Palo Alto
does impact Stanford.
Anyone from campus entering the community
should be aware that collaboration is integral to suc
cessful communication between the two communi
ties.
The East Palo Alto Project (EPAP). launched by
a joint effort between East Palo Alto and University
citizens, was created in 1992 to improve communica
tion between the two communities. EPAP's goal was
to promote understanding of the cultural, political
and social development of East Palo Alto.
It examined how East Palo Alto's development
was affected by the growth and aspirations of Stan
ford. Palo Alto and other Vlidpeninsula communi
ties.
Through interviews with East Palo Alto residents.
EPAP created an historical archive, two one-act
plays and a video documentary. The documentary.
"Dreams of a City: Creating East Palo Alto," recon
structed the city's history from the stories of its resi
dents.
The vision for EPAP really took hold through the
East Palo Alto community. The project addressed
issues like youth, intergenerational communication,
multinational diversity, marginalization. external
and internal imaging, education and the future of
East Palo Alto.
Through collaboration, a remarkable picture of a
community emerged â€” a picture of its people, its
faith and its struggles.
East Palo Alto's history began before the current
millennium and will continue into the next. Its strug
gle for self-definition and self-determination is one in
which residents of East Palo Alto can take pride
East Palo Alto's struggle holds lessons for everyone.
The EPAP partnership is not without problems,
and the story that emerged cannot be universal.
However, this community university collaboration
is one ot the many new bonds between our two com
munities.
Both Stanford and East Palo Alto have vast
resources that can spur growth, understanding, learn
ing. positive action and commitment.
Many ell-meaning people and institutions try to
lend assistance in East Palo Alto. But attempts based
on false assumptions fail to provide lasting resources
on which to build, because they do not rely on col
laboration
That is \vh\ your reasons for working in East Palo
Alto are so important. The better you understand
your reasons, the more effective you will be.
1 hope you make the right decision for the right
reasons.
