# Good service meets community needs, not student goals
## 
### 
WHEN I arrived
at Stanford as a
freshman, I had
never heard of East Palo
Alto. Through fellow stu
dents, I learned that Stan
ford students did a lot of
community service work
in East Palo Alto, and I

concluded there must be vast, unmet needs
in the city. I thought. "Kids must need men
tors! Schools must need tutors! Parents
must need educational opportunities!"
I had assigned my schema of an "under
privileged community" to East Palo Alto.
As a well-intentioned, socially conscious
,ambitious student, I asked. "What can I do
to help?"
()ver the course of my four years of com
munity service at Stanford, my attitude has
changed dramatically. I've learned that
while it is wonderful to feel motivated to
help others and "do good." we need to stop
and think for a moment before getting
involved. We should ask ourselves the fol
lowing questions: "What do I really know
about this community? Who asked ME to
step in? And why do 1 want to get

involved?"
I've realized that before deciding HOW
to get involved, before gathering a bunch of
students for a one-time service activity,
before creating a student service organiza
tion, even before volunteering with an exist
ing service organization, every student
should provide thoughtful, informed
answers to those three questions.
Know what you know. Know what you
don't know. Know who you are. Respect and
embrace the opportunity to grow and to con
tribute.
Meeting community needs and not push
ing individual agendas should be our goal.
ITie community is the reason we volunteer
for service experiences. Every service pro
ject and group ought to grow out of an artic
ulated community desire and not an
assigned need. Ideally, "service" divs not
mean applying our solutions to fix a prob
lem. but rather recognizing and strengthen
ing community assets.
Student involvement in the community is
a two-way relationship. Students can and do
contribute enormously, but also need to
respect the experience, wisdom and teach
ing of community members We need to be

humble and flexible. If we can sacrifice a
piece of our own agendas, we can see our
work as part of a bigger whole — a larger
piece of work being directed and owned by
the community itself.
At a recent event in East Palo Alto. I
heard one community member articulate
the service dilemma using a simple analogy.
Let's say your house needs to be painted
and you don't have the time or the money to
get the job done. A group of well inten
tioned Stanford students kmxks on your
door and tells you that they will happily
paint your house for you
The idea sounds wonderful, but as the
students begin, you see that the> are paint
ing your house purple with big yellow polka
dots. In the end. you still need to repaint the
house. This wastes your time and energy.
Furthermore, you are frustrated with the
miscommunication and lack ot mutual
understanding that occurred.
We may not be painting houses purple
and yellow. Hut we are out in communities
which may not be our own. often prescrib
ing remedies for other people's problems
Before we enter communities, we need to
stop, think, ask questions and do our home

work. There are amazing resources avail
able on campus — housed in the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service and at the various
community centers — that can help us
understand local communities.
Many people at Stanford have worked
and lived in these communities for years and
have established relationships with commu
nity members. We must be willing to admit
that our ideas may not be the best ideas.
Through reap rival service, everyone bene
fits. and learning and growth can take place
Taking time to understand the eommuni
ties we enter enhances the service we do and
the experiences we have. As ama/ing as our
Stanford education is. we can learn a great
deal outside the classroom if we open our
minds Education can be as much a barner
to enlightenment as it is a path to greater
knowledge.
1 don't want to come across as being neg
ative. Nor do I want to discourage you from
doing service or imply that all service is bad
service. Far from it!
Fhere arc many students and student
groups who have created and fostered
strong links with various communities. Stu
dent groups spend time reflecting on the ser

vice the\ do and engage in programming
which helps them better understand the
communities the\ enter.
New student group leaders take over
before the end of the vear and are able to
meet their community partners and learn
under the guidance of former leaders Stu
dents do recognize unmet, articulated, com
munit\ needs and create groups and pro
jects which build upon community
strengths
I came to Stanford with a desire to "do
community sen ice." 1 leave with an under
standing that it isn't that simple. I have grap
pled with the questions I've posed to you.
and at times it seems as though they only
lead to more complex questions.
My challenge to you is not to save the
world or even to join every group at the
Haas Center Rather, ask yourself why you
want to. The search for the answer to this
question can take you on an unexpected,
fulfilling and eye-opening journey.
I wish vou luck!
