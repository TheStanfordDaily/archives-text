eDear Health Forum: Are males afflicted by
eating disorders as much as females are?
— Anon.
a Dear Reader,
That is a very good question. The latest lit
/ 1 erature tells us that the numbers are not
equal (i.e., a higher percentage of those suf
fering from eating disorders are females), but there
are several recorded cases each year of men suffer
ing from disorders such as bulimia and anorexia.
British researchers Crisp and Burns reported the
mean age of anorexia onset in males to be anywhere
from 17 to 24 years of age. Crisp reported that the
condition was present for an average of 3.5 years and
that most patients were mildly obese (127.3 percent
of ideal body mass) prior to the onset of illness. The
minimal weight dropped to 67.3 percent of ideal
body mass during the acute phase of illness.
Yates, et al. did research comparing male
marathon runners to anorectics and found many
similar sociocultural and personality characteristics.
Runners were found to possess an abnormal preoc
cupation with food, aiming to achieve a goal of 4 per
cent body fat / % percent lean body mass (fat free
mass).
Many lost greater than 25 percent of their original
weight and showed a "relentless pursuit of thinness
or a disturbance of body image," according to
Binder. Male anorectic characteristics include per
fectionism, obsession and antisocial tendencies.
ANNOUNCEMENT: On Wednesday. February
25, Vivian Crisman, Registered Dietitian, will be
hosting an Eating Disorder Symposium complete
with guest speakers and counselors. Upon conclu
sion of the symposium, attendees will have an oppor
tunity to speak with counselors, both publicly and
privately. For more information, please contact
Crisman, at the Cowell Student Health Center at
