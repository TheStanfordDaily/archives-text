# Tenuring criticized
## New report says Stanford still hires too few women 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
A group of Stanford faculty
members calling themselves the
Women's Coalition for Gender Eq
uity yesterday released a report
sharply criticizing Stanford for its
record in hiring and tenuring
women faculty.
The report — a preliminary ver
sion that will he released in final
form in March — calls on the Uni
versity to pursue more actively its
efforts to increase the percentage of
tenured faculty who are female. In
1993. the last time a comprehensive
report on trends in faculty was pro
duced. only 13.3 percent of tenured
faculty were women, placing Stan
ford far behind most comparable
schools.
Drawing from tenure trends at
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences and the School of Medicine,
the report charges the University
with hiring women for jobs that are
not tenure-line and with failing to
tenure those women whose posi
tions make them eligible.
"It appears." the report says,
"that Stanford may have a long his
tory of engaging in reluctant recruit
ment, systematic ghettoization and
minimal advancement of women."
Provost Condoleezza Rice criti
cized the report: "I don't think a re
port like this advances (the group's]
case."
Calling the document "error-rid
den," Rice said it stands in contrast
to the 1993 report by the Provost's
Committee on the Recruitment and
Retention of Women Faculty.
That report was "very senous."
said Rice, who served on the com

mittee before becoming provost
herself. "A report like this one
doesn't add to the discussion It's
more of a polemic."
Using a mix of anecdotes, statis
tics and graphs, the new report of
fers evidence for the group's view
that "the University has made little

forward
progress on the
issue of hiring
and may in fact
be moving back
ward on issues of
retention."
In terms
of hiring, "de
spite a stated

commitment to faculty gender di
versity that stretches hack for over
20 years, more than twice as many
men as women have been hired to
the faculty" during those two
decades, the report says. At the
Medical School, the percentage of
women facult\ has remained at 20
since 1990.
Most departments at Stanford
"have a percentage of women on
their faculty that lags behind both
the national average and the per
centage of women in the Ph.D.
ptx)l." the report says.
The lack of women hired is com
pounded by the rarity of tenunng
females, according to the report,
which is especially critical of Dean
of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven. saying his record has
slowed progress being made in the
arena before he became dean in
IW3.
"Under Dean Shoven. the
tenure rate for men surpasses that


Shoven
ol women tor ihe first time in over
15 years, despite the fact lhal
women are so poorly represented
on the tenured faculty." the report
said.
But Shoven and Rice said the
statistics used to make that claim
are questionable. Although he has
approved <o percent of men up tor
tenure and only 50 percent of
women, so few tenure cases come
up altogether that the picture could
easily have looked different. Rice
argued.
"II you were to switch one case
(from male to female), you could
go to almost 5(1-5(1." she said,
adding that attacks on Shoven are
"unfair and misleading."
Looked at in terms of pure num
bers. Shoven has denied tenure to
eight men and eight women during
the past lour years, approving 15 of
23 men up for the promotion and
eight of 16 women.
"In a fair process, you would ex
pecl to see some period of the lime
when women fare better than men
and some time when men fare bet
ter than women." Shoven ex
plained.
The process of evening the
ranks is inherently a long one. Rice
added.
"'Progress comes slowly and
we're working very hard at it," she
said. The Stanford faculty has re
mained at about 1.400 members for
several years, and because only a
lew professors retire each year,
percentages will change much
more slowly than total numbers.
Rice said.
Retirements can be used to
argue the other side as well. Assoc.
History Prof. la>u Roberts said at a
lunchtiine meeting on the report
yesterday.
The inclusion of retirement in
regular reports of gains and losses in
the professoriate "skews the data
unfairly because there's a dispro
portionate number of male faculty
retiring." Roberts said, making it
look like the percentage of women
faculty is increasing at a greater rate.
The group also criticized the
lack of action on the 1993 provost's
committee report in terms of annu
al updates, public release of infor
mation and monitoring of progress.
However, the group failed to
take advantage of some informa
tion that had been released. Rice
said. Its claim that Stanford won't
discuss faculty compensation is
false, she said, noting that her re
port last spring to the Faculty Sen
ate included salary data.
An informal survey by the
Women's Faculty Caucus in 19%
showed that women "continue to
fall disproportionately into the low
est quartile of salaries." according
to the report. But Rice said women
on average are earning more than
93 percent ot what men earn — a
figure brought down significantly
by the fact that women are "late
comers" to traditionally male-dom
inated fields such as engineering.
In the end. Rice and Shoven em
phasized. they have the same goals
as the coalition.
