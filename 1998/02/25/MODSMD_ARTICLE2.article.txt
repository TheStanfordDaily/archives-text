# Tenuring criticized
## New report says Stanford still hires too few women 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
A group of Stanford faculty
members calling themselves the
Women's Coalition for Gender Eq
uity yesterday released a report
sharply criticizing Stanford for its
record in hiring and tenuring
women faculty.
The report — a preliminary ver
sion that will he released in final
form in March — calls on the Uni
versity to pursue more actively its
efforts to increase the percentage of
tenured faculty who are female. In
1993. the last time a comprehensive
report on trends in faculty was pro
duced. only 13.3 percent of tenured
faculty were women, placing Stan
ford far behind most comparable
schools.
Drawing from tenure trends at
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences and the School of Medicine,
the report charges the University
with hiring women for jobs that are
not tenure-line and with failing to
tenure those women whose posi
tions make them eligible.
"It appears." the report says,
"that Stanford may have a long his
tory of engaging in reluctant recruit
ment, systematic ghettoization and
minimal advancement of women."
Provost Condoleezza Rice criti
cized the report: "I don't think a re
port like this advances (the group's]
case."
Calling the document "error-rid
den," Rice said it stands in contrast
to the 1993 report by the Provost's
Committee on the Recruitment and
Retention of Women Faculty.
That report was "very senous."
said Rice, who served on the com

mittee before becoming provost
herself. "A report like this one
doesn't add to the discussion It's
more of a polemic."
Using a mix of anecdotes, statis
tics and graphs, the new report of
fers evidence for the group's view
that "the University has made little

forward
progress on the
issue of hiring
and may in fact
be moving back
ward on issues of
retention."
In terms
of hiring, "de
spite a stated

commitment to faculty gender di
versity that stretches hack for over
20 years, more than twice as many
men as women have been hired to
the faculty" during those two
decades, the report says. At the
Medical School, the percentage of
women facult\ has remained at 20
since 1990.
Most departments at Stanford
"have a percentage of women on
their faculty that lags behind both
the national average and the per
centage of women in the Ph.D.
ptx)l." the report says.
The lack of women hired is com
pounded by the rarity of tenunng
females, according to the report,
which is especially critical of Dean
of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven. saying his record has
slowed progress being made in the
arena before he became dean in
IW3.
"Under Dean Shoven. the
tenure rate for men surpasses that
