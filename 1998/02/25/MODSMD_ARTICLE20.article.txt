Scientists discover how some
embryos cope with toxins
Stanford researchers lead by Biology Prof.
David Epel have discovered the mechanism by
which innkeeper worm embryos protect them
selves against environmental toxins.
The worm lives in coastal mud flats, estuarine
areas which receive substantial natural and man
made toxins from runoff. The embryos of this
worm are consequently subject to high levels of
potentially lethal chemical toxins.
Whereas adults can sequester or metabolize
such toxins to neutralize their potential for harm,
embryos lack such a mechanism.
"Adult organisms often defend against toxins
by taking the substance into their cells and trans
forming it," Epel said. "The embryo has not devel
oped the adult's mechanisms for coping. It is
adapted to a particular niche and to a particular
task — rapid cell division and development."
Though the embryo uses special mechanisms to
protect against toxins, little research has been per
formed on its toxin-protection strategies.
"We know surprisingly little at the cellular and
molecular level about how embryos cope with
their environments. Yet the embryo is the most
fragile stage in the life cycle, and its survival is crit
ical for sustaining the life of a species," Epel said.
His research at the Hopkins Marine Station or
inspired him to investigate embryonic defense
mechanisms. "Working at Hopkins, seeing the
embryos of marine organisms in their natural envi
ronment — I was intrigued by how they defend
themselves," Epel said.
The research he and his colleagues performed
showed that a protein embedded in cellular mem
branes ejects toxins from the cell. This protein is
called the MDR transporter pump. MDR stands
for "multi-drug resistance."
Epel and others have found MDR transporter
pumps in a variety of organisms, including adult
innkeeper worms and bacteria. Unfortunately, the
MDR transporter pumps have also been implicat
ed in creating antibiotic resistance in bacteria and
in hindering the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs.
The innkeeper worm embryos, however, do
not use MDR transporter proteins without a cost.
The pump uses a large amount of the developing
worms' energy and may delay its ultimate devel
opment into an adult.
