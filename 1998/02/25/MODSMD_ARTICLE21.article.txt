# Baruch Blumberg:
## Globe-trotting with a Nobel Prize Winner 
### Michael Hope Contributing writer 
Perhaps the greatest achievement of Visiting Human
Biology Prof. Baruch Blumberg's career is not that he
developed the Hepatitis B vaccine, for which he was
awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1976, but that
he managed to combine such groundbreaking research
with another of his passions: world travel.
Blumberg has been to all corners of the globe col
lecting blood specimens to study variations in human
susceptibility to disease. To gather the greatest diversi
ty of samples, he has been everywhere from Finland to
Nigeria, and from Thailand to Surinam.
As his strategies of data collection are reminiscent of
Darwin's travels, it is not surprising to learn that as a
child growing up in New York City, Blumberg was fas
cinated by travel narratives and accounts of early explo
rations. He was inspired by the likes of Charles Darwin,
Alfred Wallace and Joseph Conrad.
Blumberg had his first real taste of exploration when
he joined the Navy in 1943. He was commissioned as a
deck officer and served on landing ships. By the time
World War II came to a close had been promoted to
captain on one of these ships.
During this stint with the Navy, Blumberg found
time to finish up at Union College, where he earned a
degree in physics. He then attended Columbia Univer
sity where he entered The College of Physicians and
Surgeons, after a brief stay in the Mathematics Depart
ment. The belief that he would never be an "original"
mathematical thinker, coupled with his father's enthusi
asm for medicine, was largely responsible for this
change of heart.
Between his third and fourth years of medical
school, Blumberg had the opportunity to travel again.
He spent several months in Moengo, a remote mining
town in northern Surinam.
The site was accessible only by river. There he pro
vided a number of basic medical services to a heteroge
neous population of laborers.
In Moengo, Blumberg was struck by the enormous
variation in the responses of these laborers to the many
infectious agents in the environment.
His first published research paper was about the
diversity of responses to infection with the organism
that causes elephantiasis, a condition he became famil

iar with through his work in this region.
It was in Moengo, Blumberg recalls, that he first
became interested in the idea that susceptibility to dis
ease is profoundly affected by inherited factors. In 1957.
after earning a doctorate in biochemistry at Oxford
University, he again set out on the road to investigate
this notion.
Blumberg's travels took him to West Africa, where
he collected blood specimens from several indigenous
populations and studied the inherited differences of cer
tain important proteins.
Working for the National Institutes of Health, and
later the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia
where he remains today, Blumberg continued this type
of data collection on subsequent research trips. His
research yielded important findings about the inherited
variation of proteins and. ultimately, the discovery of
the Hepatitis B virus.
Before Blumberg's work with Hepatitis B. the virus
was invisible to medical detection. Consequently, blood
banks could not screen for it, and many people were
infected during blood transfusions and surgical proce

dures.
Blumberg was able to not only find the antibody for
the virus, which made its detection possible, but also to
develop an effective vaccination strategy. He began by
introducing signature molecules from the surface of the
Hepatitis B virus into healthy people. Blumberg found
that their immune systems developed a resistance to
Hepatitis B while not actually having to combat the
virus itself.
Surprisingly, the media did not immediately cele
brate Blumberg's landmark discovery. Blumberg thinks
this is because Hepatitis B is not viewed as an immedi
ate and fatal threat.
Unlike AIDS, Hepatitis B is not associated with
rapid death.
A majority of those with acute Hepatitis B show flu
and fever symptoms and yellow jaundice (skin discol
oration ). but usually recover in a matter of weeks. And
even though chronic carriers have drastically reduced
life spans, the connection between Hepatitis Band
death is not well-known to the public.
Blumberg's work may have taken a while to gain
acknowledgment, but acknowledged it was. In 1976 he
and a band of family and friends set off for Stockholm
for a week of partying at the expense of the Nobel
Foundation.
Since winning the Nobel Prize for Medicine, Blum
berg has made efforts to have his vaccine used globally.
There has been a dramatic reduction of people infected
with Hepatitis B worldwide. As a result of this endeav
or. in Taiwan, levels have dropped from 15 percent to 1
percent and in Alaska, where the virus was once partic
ularly common, it has all but disappeared.
Blumberg has also spent a good deal of time investi
gating the link between Hepatitis Band liver cancer. He
speaks of the Hepatitis B vaccine as a potent anti-cancer
measure. The occurrence of liver cancer in the vaccinat
ed group is a third of that of the untreated population
These days. Blumberg still manages to travel a lot.
He has been Master (or President) of Balliol College in
Oxford, England since 1989 or here to Stanford where
he is teaching a Human Biology class this quarter.
Although Blumberg is teaching his class on scientific
discovery in biology and medicine — his guest speakers
include friends Arthur Kornberg and Paul Berg —
Blumberg seems just as well-suited to teach a course on
world geography.
