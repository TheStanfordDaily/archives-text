# Chu proves polymers possess individuality

Molecules which are created equal may in fact
behave differently, according to experiments conducted
by Stanford researchers under the leadership of Nobel
Laureate Prof, of Physics and Applied Physics Steven
Chu. They have discovered that identical polymer
molecules will unfold in different ways when subject to
identical environmental conditions that promote
unfolding.
Polymers are linear macromolecules formed by
stringing together a set of basic subunits, much as rail
road cars are hitched together to form a train. Some
polymers fold about themselves to adopt specific and
complex three-dimensional shapes. Plastics, synthetic
fibers, proteins, carbohydrates and deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) are all polymer molecules.
The research group placed floating strands of DNA
into a microscopic flow cell and observed how they
unraveled when exposed to small currents. The results
were surprising â€” though the DNA polymers shared
the exact same sequence and were placed in identical
flow conditions, some remained coiled while others
uncoiled to different degrees and at various rates.
"Molecular individualism is a new surprise. We dis
covered it because we have developed the ability to

visualize and manipulate single molecules," Chu said.
"This ability is allowing us to address a number of long
standing questions in polymer science."
Previously, scientists studied polymer molecules in
the billions instead of individually analyzing them. Chu
compares this bulk approach to trying to infer the char
acteristics of animals in a zoo only by using information
about averages.
"If someone did a series of experiments that only
measured the average size, weight and number of legs
of the animals, he would get a distorted picture. For
example, he might find that the average number of legs
on the animals is 2.7 and then look for a theory of ani
mal development that could explain his finding. Only
by looking at individual animals can you get a true
sense of the diversity of species," Chu said.
Individual polymer molecules are typically too small
to visualize, but by fluorescently labeling viral DNA
polymers, Chu was able to observe the molecule under
an optical microscope. The results were surprising.
Some polymers remained coiled in diverse forma
tions long after traditional theory predicted that the>
should have fully unraveled. The data suggested that
the results of bulk studies using large quantities of poly
mer molecules have been previously misinterpreted.
"We have shown that very different behavior can be
seen with identical molecules in the same environ

ment." Chu said. "The unraveling is due to tiny differ
ences resulting from thermal fluctuations in the starting
conditions." The data suggests that "molecular individ
ualism" is a product of small differences in initial con
ditions.
However, molecular individualism is different from
chaos theory. Chu emphasized. The theory describes
the nonlinear amplification of small variations in initial
conditions to produce large and unpredictable differ
ences. With molecular individualism, the equations
describing the motion of the polymers need not be lin
ear.
Understanding how polymer molecules deform in
fields is important to many commercial processes
including injection molding, which uses polymers
forced to flow through a nozzle. But. these applications
aside. Chu could not resist a metaphysical reverie of his
findings.
"We put identical DNA ... in the same environment
and Nay 'Go!' Our subjects begin to look different, and
some of the individuals get to where they are going
much faster than others. [Before this] we did not con
sider how important tiny random influences would be."
Chu said "Perhaps such accidental influences plav an
important role in how our lives evolve as well. If you
could clone Einstein 1(X) times, would you get 90
Einsteins? Would vou get one?"
