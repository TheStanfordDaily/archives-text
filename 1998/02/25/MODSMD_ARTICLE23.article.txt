# Eating disorders
## University provides programs to help 
### Lydia Cheng 
This week is National Eating Disor
ders Awareness Week, and over WX)
American high schools and colleges will
organize informational events about eat
ing disorders. Stanford will participate
by holding an education and self-assess
ment program in Toyon Hall from 7 p.m.
to 8:30 p.m. today.
"The Stanford campus is very reflec
tive of the national college scene," said
Vivian H. Crisman. a nutritionist with
Cowell Student Health Center. As a
nutritionist, Crisman assists students
with issues including weight loss and veg
etarianism. "About 1 to 2 percent of col
lege women have anorexia and 2 to 3
percent have bulimia. A much larger
percentage, about 20 percent, suffer
from disordered eating.'"
Crisman identifies general dissatisfac
tion with body image, a disordered rela
tionship with food and excessive exercise

as symptoms of "disordered eating."
Anorexia is self-starvation and it typ
ically results in significant weight loss,
disruption of the menstrual cycle, dry
skin, thinning of the bones and brittle
hair and nails. Bulimia is characterized
by periods of uncontrollable binges fol
lowed by purging either through vomit
ing. laxatives, diuretics or compulsive
exercise for hours.
No tracking mechanism exists at
Stanford to monitor eating disorder
trends at Stanford. Though Cowell con
ducts an annual student health survey, it
does not address eating disorders. Dur
ing her time at Stanford, however,
Crisman has not noticed any changes in
the incidence of eating disorders at Stan
ford.
Crisman sees unique factors at Stan
ford that contribute to the existence of
eating disorders on campus
"In general, I would say eating disor
ders could be connected to people with

incredible competitive drive or perfec
tionist tendencies." Crisman said. That
drive can fuel an eating disorder. "How
ever, it's hard to say if Stanford attracts
people like that or if the environment
fosters it. It's probably a combination."
Students with symptoms of an eating
disorder are sometimes identified when
they come to Cowell for other medical
needs. Students seeking help with eating
disorders can go to Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS), which is
affiliated with Cowell. Crisman also sug
gests seeking support through the Body
Image Food and Self-Esteem student
group. She reminds students the\ can go
to her. as a nutritionist, for help as well.
"If you are anorexic or bulimic,
you're probably an expert calorie
counter, but have a lot of misperceptions
about food." Cnsman said.
Crisman emphasizes that healthy
change must be driven by the individual.
Senior Kvm Reed, a former varsity ath

lete and recovered anorexic, agrees that
the individual must first personally rec
ognize the problem.
"For me. as an athlete, it wasn't until
1 couldn't physically function as an ath
lete that 1 was willing to seek help.'"
Keed said. "If you have an eating disor
der. you're not going to overcome it
unless you recognize that it is a problem.
That is the crucial first step in the recov
ery process." Reed eventually sought
help outside of Stanford
"Personally, I found off-campus
resources more comfortable because
they provide more privacy." Reed said
"It can be embarrassing to find that all
your hard work, i.e rigorous exercise
and strict dieting, has really been to your
detriment instead of your development "
Reed sees the overwhelming presence
of athletics at Stanford as contributing to
the development of eating disorders
The high physical standards im
posed on many athletes tends to
spill over into the general commu
nity. She also believes the Stanford
community has a more extreme de
finition of an eating disorder.
"The general perception here is
a very skinny, very sick person,"
Reed said. "Someone could be un
derweight. restrict their diet, exer
cise excessively, but not be recog
nized as having an eating disorder;
whereas on other campuses, it
would be a red flag."
Reed recommends that Stan

ford offer anonymous sell-assess
ment programs and support ser
vices. She describes an eating dis
order as an all-consuming illness
that results in withdrawal from po
tential sources of help.
Reed cautions against placing
misguided confidence in the intelli
gence of Stanford students. They
are not "too smart" to develop a
harmful eating disorder. The ongo
ing existence of eating disorders on
campus is partly due to this mis
conception, combined with ex
treme body image ideals at Stan
ford.
"It's not a question of intelli
gence," Reed said. "It's about
being pushed to the limit."
