## 
### James Pritchard Contributing writer 
On this spring s ballot, say good
bye to the climbing wall and hello to
the Undergraduate Weenie Roast
— this year's special tee requests are
in.
A bill to place the special-tee re
quests on the ballot for the spring
general election was passed last
night at the ASSI Senate meeting.
The ASSU provides funding for
each student group that is approved
by a majoriU of voters in the annual
election.
As long as the necessary petition
and other documentation is submit
ted by the proper deadline, each
group listed in last night's bill will be
on the election ballot.
This year's election will be held
April 15-16.
The total fee request for under
graduate organizations went down

-3.1 percent from last year, from
$433,542 to $420,058.
Fee requests went up for groups
applying to both the undergraduate
and the graduate student bodies.
These fee requests rose 2.7 percent
from $443,706 to $455,526.
Organizations have the choice of
applying for funding from just the
undergraduate student body, just
the graduate student body or both.
No groups applied to be funded by
just graduate students.
Two new groups appeared on the
special-fee list, while four from last
vear's group were missing. New are
the Undergraduate Weenie Roast
and the Thinker. Gone are Project
Motivation, the Stanford Gospel
Choir. Stanford Homeless Action
Committee and the climbing wall.
The money approved last year
lor the climbing wall has yet to be
used.
This money will sit in an ASSIJ

reserve account until the climbing
wall organization requests it.
To apply for a special fee, a group
must lirst propose a budget to the
ASSIJ Appropriations Committee.
This application was due Feb. 13.
I he committee then reviews the
groups' applications and works with
each group individually, adjusting
the proposed budget if necessary,
ASSIJ Vice President Ben Decker
said.
ASSIJ Senator Santos Marro
quin, one of the members of the
committee, said that each group got
its budget approved.
"Some [budget requests] were
slightly changed, but they were
changes that both sides agreed on,"
Marroquin said.
Fee requests ranged from $3,890
for the Thinker to $140,970 for club
sports.
Last year, all special fees but one
were passed. An organization desir

ing ASSU money has two options.
Groups with large budgets apply for
a special fee on the ballot while
smaller groups can apply for a gen
eral fee directly from the ASSU.
The Program and Community
Service Boards disburse money to
roughly SO smaller organizations,
such as some ethnic groups and a
cappella groups. Decker said.
"We try to steer groups whose
budgets are less than $5,000 to the
boards," ASSU Senator Mike
Colon, another member of the com
mittee. said.
A second bill concerning special
fee reform was tabled last night and
will most likely be debated next
week.
This bill would shift the special
fee request process to ASSU juris
diction from the traditional student
vote. Student approval on this
spring's ballot would be required for
the bill to become law.
