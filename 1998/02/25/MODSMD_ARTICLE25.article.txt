best thing in the game. (This game] is a chance
to give some of the other guys a chance to
play."

game for the Cardinal, allowing no hits
through the first two innings.
Santa Clara's Peter Rice started the game

on the mound, but lasted only one complete
inning.
The pace was set early in the game by the
powerful Cardinal when Gall drove in the
first run with a single to right field. With
sophomore first baseman John Gall on first
and junior center fielder Jody Gerut on third,
the two pulled off a double steal to finish the
first inning up 2-0.
A single down the left field line by junior
second baseman Tony Schrager brought right
fielder Joe Borchard home to increase the
Card's lead to three in the following inning.

"They [Santa Clara] did a good job pitch

There was a slight attempt made
by Santa Clara to stay in the game in

the bottom of the seventh inning.

Bronco left fielder Todd Hughes, a
sophomore, fired the ball back at
the mound. Young attempted to
kick the ball over to Gall at first
base, as it shot toward his legs. The
run scored, however, as Young
could not boot the baseball far

enough. The Cardinal continued
with its offensive attack in the fol
lowing two innings, scoring three
more runs.
"You make mistakes and they
will take advantage of them," said
Mike Cummins, in his rookie year
as Santa Clara's head coach.
"That's the mark of a great team."

The Cardinal travels to play the
No. 6 Arizona State Sun Devils this
weekend for a three game series.
Junior Jeff Austin (4-0) is expected
to open up the series on the mound
on Friday night, with juniors Chad
Hutchinson (3-0) and Brent Hoard
