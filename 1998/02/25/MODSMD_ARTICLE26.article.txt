# Rob & Va reverse roles
## 
### 
This week, Vanessa and I would like to
discuss an area of athletics not often chroni
cled — the life of the sportswriter. As a
sportswriter, I hesitate to turn over my sa
cred (pull and papyrus to my surly yet sultry
co-columnist, Va. Hut I realize, I must. May
the force he with us.

Va: Yes, finally I have the power.
Robin: You're going to seriously abuse this
power, I can already tell.
Va: You've got me all wrong. Robin. I've
always wanted to be a hard-hitting journal
ist. Plus, doesn't my name appear first this
week?
Robin: On second thought, maybe we
should change the topic.
Va: Shut up. it's go time. If you mess with
the bull now, you get the horns.
Robin: OK. first question.
Va: Robin, what's it do for your personal
self-image to always be the storyteller and
not the story?

Robin: Well. Vanessa, I never thought of it
that way until now.
Va: Well nanny-boo to you too — how do
you think of it?
Robin: I just like to bring the story to the
people. Capturing the true drama of sports
for the masses brings fulfillment to my life.
And don't call me nannv-boo.

Va: Don't you get paid, too?
Kohin: Yes, hut not enough for a burrito
and a Coke.
Va: Mmmm. burritos.
Kohin: Focus here. I was just going to say
that the real reward of my work is the qual
ity time I get to spend with you.
Va: Yeah right, and you're the wind be
neath my wings. Next question: When did
you know you'd reached the beginning of
the end, oh. I mean, when did you know you
wanted to be a sportswriter? And tell the
truth. I want to set a new precedent for this
