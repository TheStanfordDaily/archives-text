# Rob & Va reverse roles
## 
### 
This week, Vanessa and I would like to
discuss an area of athletics not often chroni
cled — the life of the sportswriter. As a
sportswriter, I hesitate to turn over my sa
cred (pull and papyrus to my surly yet sultry
co-columnist, Va. Hut I realize, I must. May
the force he with us.

Va: Yes, finally I have the power.
Robin: You're going to seriously abuse this
power, I can already tell.
Va: You've got me all wrong. Robin. I've
always wanted to be a hard-hitting journal
ist. Plus, doesn't my name appear first this
week?
Robin: On second thought, maybe we
should change the topic.
Va: Shut up. it's go time. If you mess with
the bull now, you get the horns.
Robin: OK. first question.
Va: Robin, what's it do for your personal
self-image to always be the storyteller and
not the story?

Robin: Well. Vanessa, I never thought of it
that way until now.
Va: Well nanny-boo to you too — how do
you think of it?
Robin: I just like to bring the story to the
people. Capturing the true drama of sports
for the masses brings fulfillment to my life.
And don't call me nannv-boo.

Va: Don't you get paid, too?
Kohin: Yes, hut not enough for a burrito
and a Coke.
Va: Mmmm. burritos.
Kohin: Focus here. I was just going to say
that the real reward of my work is the qual
ity time I get to spend with you.
Va: Yeah right, and you're the wind be
neath my wings. Next question: When did
you know you'd reached the beginning of
the end, oh. I mean, when did you know you
wanted to be a sportswriter? And tell the
truth. I want to set a new precedent for this

column.
Kohin: It was an overcast clay in
May, a day like any other. I was
strolling past the 1M fields on the
way to the library when out of the
blue, a lawn dart struck me in the
ear. As I stumbled to my feet and
the captain of the lawn dart team
carefully extracted his best dart
from my ear, I knew my calling. 1
would bring the drama of lawn
darts to the readers. And then 1 de
cided maybe I'd write about other
less-enthralling sports too.
Ya: I have nothing to say to that.
Kohin: Well you have to say some
thing, you're the interviewer.
Va: OK. 1 think you're story is bull.
My freshman roommate was on the
lawn dart team, and they don't
have a captain. Their leader is
called the Titan of Toss.
Robin: Alright, you caught me. 1
was just trying to be funny. I'm

used to asking the questions.
Va: It's OK if you're not funny.
You have lots of other good quali
ties, like, you spell really well.
Kohin: Yeah, and I'm good at pin
ball too.
Va: Oh, nanny-boo, let's move on. I
know when 1 get nervous I try vari
ous techniques to get over those
nerves. When you're interviewing a
well-known sports figure, like Kate
Starbird lor example, do you get
nervous? And if so, do you imagine
yourself in your underwear?
Kohin: How would that help me?
Wait a second, are you imagining
yourself in your underwear right
now?
Va: Yes, but that's not strange. I do
it all the time.
Kohin: Alright, to answer your
question, if I think I 'm going to get
nervous I just try to be extremely
prepared.
Va: Well that's not interesting at
all. Maybe you should start making
things up again.
Kohin: You told me I couldn't do

that. 1 don't want to get the horns.
Va: Good call. In my experience, re
porters have asked me and my team
mates lots of dumb questions that
you can't answer. What's the dumb
est question you've ever asked?
Kobin: I'm beginning to think it
was when I asked you to do this col
umn.
Va: Fair enough. Hut could you
give our readers a couple more ex
amples?
Kobin: Well, my mom once told me
there's no such thing as a stupid
question, but I have heard some
doozies in my day. I once heard a
sportswriter ask a player what it
felt like to break the Stanford
record for three pointers in a ca
reer. Like anyone really cared.
Va: Hey, wait a second. They asked
me that question.
Kobin: Oh, my bad. Well it's also
really pathetic when they don't
know or understand the vocabu
lary of the sport. For example, ask
ing Kristin Folkl how many kills
she had after a basketball game.

Va: Well the dumbest question I
ever heard, surprisingly enough,
came from you. I couldn't believe
you didn't know where the bath
rooms were in Maples.
Kobin: Look, 1 really had to go.
Va: Well, then it's kind of excus
able; my mom always told me it's
bad to hold it.
Kobin: Do you have any more
questions?
Va: What is a question really? A
need to know? A hidden desire? A
thirst for knowledge? ...
Kobin: On that note I'm ending the
column. Next week, to Vanessa's
chagrin, I will be back in charge,
asking the questions.
Va: That's what you think, nanny
boo.

Vanessa and Robin would like to

Vanessa cry in public while she and
her fellow seniors are honored in
their last home game. Bye-bye,
