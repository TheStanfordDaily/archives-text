## 
### Jennifer Splansky Editorial staff 
With much of the Stanford campus con
fused with all the water El Nino has produced,
the Stanford synchronized swimming team
has become at home in the water. In fact, its
victory last weekend at the Wheaton College
Invitational, in Norton, Mass. proved just
how comfortable the women are in the water.
Stanford won the competition, beating Ohio
State. Pennsylvania, Wheaton and Kueka
College.

The 10-woman Cardinal team trumped
reigning national champions Ohio State for
the first time ever. The exciting meet saw the
Cardinal triumph 100-%. only two weeks
after demolishing both Minnesota and ( ar-
Icton College at the University of Minnesota
Invitational. Though the schools from Min
nesota provided the Card with little competi
tion, upsetting 13-time delending national
champion OSl' h;»s been the season highlight
for the syncroni/.ed swimmers.
" I his was an excellent performance by the
Stanford Team." said head coach Vickey

Weir. "It helps us get one step closer to our
goal of winning the NCAA Championships."
At last year's NCAA's, Stanford lost to Ohio
State by just two points.
Despite losing Bridget I inn. Lesley Rid
derzold and Maia Young to graduation, the
team remains optimistic about taking the title
this year.
"This is something that we've hungered
for and something that we've been dreaming
about for the last five years," said junior
Catherine Chen.
Chen points to the depth of the team as
one of their strengths — five of the 10 team
members are National Team Members or
All-Americans.
Across the board, the women of Stanford
produced phenomenal routines. Senior for
mer-Olympian Heather Pease and junior
National Team member Vanessa Shaw led
the Cardinal throughout the tournament.
Together in the duet event. Pease and Shaw s
outstanding routines won first place over
OSU. while juniors Emi Kanayama and
Chen took fourth. Freshman Shannon Mon
tague joined Pease and Shaw in the trio
event, and the threesome again beat OSU.
The other entry for the Card saw Chen.
Kanayama and sophomore Julie Enos take a
close third.
In the solo event. Pease again showed her
incredible athleticism and artistry,
swimming her way to a first place fin
ish with a moving routine to music
from "Schindler's L.ist," leaving
many fans in the stadium teary-eyed
and awestruck.
Finishing first in these three
events was enough for the women to
capture first place, even though the
eight-woman team had yet to com
pete. Inspired by the tunes of Elvis
Presley, the team performed their
difficult routine well and took a close
second to the Buckeyes. The eight
woman team consisted of Chen.
Enior, senior Megan Fix, Kanaya
ma, Montague, Shaw, freshman
Kristi Wright and freshman Laura
Y u lid.
In the figures events of the tour
nament. the swimmers competed at
both the Senior and Junior levels. It
was once again Pease who stole the
show, finishing first in the Seniors.
Yund took home first place in the Ju
nior figures, repeating her winning
performance in routine.
This weekend's performance so
lidified the high expectations for the
year. The combination of Weir's ex
perience. spanning 20 years at Stan
lord. and the expertise of new assis
tant coach Nathalie Bartleson made
the prospects good for a victorious
Cardinal team. Bartleson, a 19%
Olympic gold medalist, "brings a lot
of energy to the team and fresh per
spective on practices and our
strengths and weaknesses," Chen
said.
The team thinks that is has what it
takes to bring down the thirteen
year reign of Ohio State and capture
the NCAA championship for Stan
ford. The NCAA championships
will he held over spring break at the
University of Minnesota.
I he Card, the team will compete
against Cal this Sunday at Hayward

ovated. Ihe Cardinal's only home
