## 
### Jessica Lan Contributing writer 
Stanford's men's tennis team extended
its dual match record to 11 -0 on the season
yesterday against 65th-ranked I 'tah. Top
ranked Stanford's performance this sea
son has been impressive; the team has not

lost a dual match since April of last sea
son.
Coming off a six-day road trip capped
off bv a championship at the National
Team Indoors in Kentucky. Stanford
geared up for the competition against the
I'tes with onl\ one da\ of rest. Utah's
record has been less than stellar, having

lost to both No. 61 Arizona and No. 43
Arizona State on the road.
However, playing without two of their
top players in singles — sophomores Bob
and Mike Bryan — the team eould have
very easily had troubles, said head coach
Dick Gould.
"It's a really eas\ time to let down, es
pecially coming off such a big high." he
said.
Gould decided to hold both Bryans,
out of the singles lineup to give freshmen
Scotty Scott and All Ansari more match
experience. Mike Br\an has recently had
some trouble with tendonitis in his wrist.
"I'm trying to get Scotty and Ah in as
many matches as possible just in case
someone gets injured and they have to
step in to take their place," Gould said
"And also, it was a natural match for Mike
to sit out of. It's one less stress on his
wrist."
