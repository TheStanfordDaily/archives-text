### Evan Nordby Contributing writer 
Actress Drew Barrymore. a panel of cam
pus health educators and the inventor of the fe
male condom tackled the subject of sexual
health in a presentat >n.it I Auditorium
last night.
Barrymore came to campus as national
spokeswoman for the Female Health Founda
tion, a nonprofit educational organization
founded by Mary Ann Leeper, the inventor of
the female condom. The discussion was spon
sored by the Intersorority and Interfraternity
Councils.
"It's tremendously important that we com
municate and educate," Barrymore said in an
interview before the panel discussion. "We
need a general acceptance that in this day and
age. we must use condoms. It's a fact, like The
sky is blue.'"
The discussion began with brief opening
thoughts from each panel member. Carole
Pertofsky, director of Health Promotion Ser
vices for Cowell Student Health Service, dis
pelled the myth that Stanford is a land of invol
untary celibacy.
Seventy-two percent of Stanford students
have been sexually active within the past vcat.
she said, citing a 2-year-old surv. \
"You've been busy," she inlormed the ovei
capacity crowd, which roared its approval.
But, she said, only 32 percent of Stanford
students not in a monogamous relationship
regularly use protection. Also, 50 percent
would lie about their sexual history to have sex
— a figure that was roughly equal for men and
women. ITiese numbers are comparable to
other residential universities, she said.

Patrick Dominguez. a peer health educator
and representative of Ye Olde Safer Sex
Shoppe, cut straight to the myth that sex must
be spontaneous.
"People should communicate and plan" to
facilitate safer sex. he said.
"What better thing to know than you're
going tit get a blow job after bio lab?" he said.
Karen Wang, of Volunteers Increasing the
Visibility of AIDS, stressed awareness of sexu
ally transmitted diseases.
"We aren't invincible." she said. "We need
to learn about ways to change our behavior and
educate ourselves."
Panelist Leeper described her goals in in
venting the female condom.
"We wanted to empower women to take
care of themselves and create a comfortable
barrier method." she said.
After their remarks, the panel opened up for
a question-and-answer session. Questions
ranged from the viability of Saran Wrap as a
birth control device, (not recommended), to
wondering if the outer portion of the female
condom could cause better clitoral stimulation
during penile-vaginal intercourse (yes, there is
a 15 to 20 percent higher rate of female or
gasm).

One woman asked if putting the
burden for birth control back on the
woman via the female condom was a
good idea, given the resistance of
many men to be responsible. Leeper
agreed that males need to be respon
sible but asserted that the female
condom empowers women and pre
sents them with more options.
"Isn't taking care of yourself the
best thing to do?" she rhetorically
asked.

Growing up in Hollywood
opened Barrymore up to issues of
sexual health at an early age, even in
the conservative climate of the
1980s. she said.
"I wish it was as easy to talk about
then as it is today." she said. "My

AIDS when I was four, and died
when I was six, so I was aware early
— no misconceptions."
