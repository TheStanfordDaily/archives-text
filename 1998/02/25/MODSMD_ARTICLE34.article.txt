# Women faculty discuss tenuring
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
About 50 women gathered in
Serra House yesterday to formulate
a plan to change what they see as
problematic trends in the hiring and
tenuring of women faculty at Stan
ford.
The Institute for Research on
Women and Gender and the Palo
Alto chapter of the American Asso
ciation of University Women spon
sored the noon meeting in conjunc
tion with the release of a report that
criticized Stanford's recruitment
and retention record.
Provost Condoleezza Rice and
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven have in turn criticized
the report, saying that while they
agree with its goals, it doesn't re
sponsibly add to the debate.
In addition to reviewing the con
tents of the report, the group dis
cussed what to do next with the in
formation. which tracks changes in
luring and promotion at the School
of Humanities and Sciences and the
School of Medicine.
The report, written by the
Women's Coalition for Gender Eq
uity at Stanford University, grew out
of meetings by about 10 women who
were "becoming increasingly trou
bled by the lack of efforts to recruit
and retain women at Stanford." ac
cording to June Flora, a senior re
search scientist at the University's
Center for Research in Disease Pre
vention.
While Stanford has always been a
leader in having a balanced student
body, it remains behind in leveling
the field for faculty. Flora said. In
departments studied by the group,
"there is at least a twofold difference
in the diversity of the students and
the diversity of the staff."' she point
ed out.
There has been improvement
since a 1993 Provost's Office report
showed that Stanford lagged behind
many comparable schools in the
percentage of its tenured faculty
who were female. Flora said, but
"those small numbers do not really
reduce our fears."
The fears compound already
pressured situations that make it
more difficult for women faculty to
earn tenure. Law Prof. Deborah

Rhode said. Alter 20 years of ob
serving the trends, she said, "we are
still stuek in some very similar
places."
The sticking points result from
"broader patterns of denial that are
out there in general." namely the be
lief that Stanford doesn't have a
problem with gender equity among
faculty. Rhode said.
"There'sa [mistaken) perception
that if women were of equal quality,
we'd see them at equal numbers,"
she said, drawing murmurs of ap
proval from the crowd.
Studies looking at bias in the
largely subjective evaluation and
promotion policies have shown that
a man would be hired over a woman
with equal qualifications. Rhode
said, a bias that extends to students
its well as administrators.
"We all see this in student evalu
ations," she said. "If a male academ
ic is murky, it's because he's really
smart If a female is fuzzy, it's be
cause she's disorganized."
In combating such views, partici
pants discussed such tactics as hold
ing public meetings for students and
the Faculty Senate, filing a class-ac
tion lawsuit and discouraging alum
ni from donating to Stanford until its
record is improved.
The last proposal would follow
the model of a group of Harvard
alumnae also protesting the rate of
tenure of women faculty at their
alma mater, said History Prof. Es
telle Freedman. who went through
the grievance process when her
tenure was denied in the early 19X()s.
"Although this university aspires
to be the Harvard of the West." said
Freedman, also chair of the Pro
gram in Feminist Studies, "I for one
would like to strive for a much high
er standard."
In the meantime, the problems
for women have come at an "enor
mous cost" to Stanford, she empha
sized.
As the atmosphere has worsened
during the past few years, Freedman
said, she has seen "much weakened
morale on campus among some of
the best and brightest and most in
novative faculty.
"It means we will lose some of
our best teachers and scholars, who
will make a difference in future gen
erations."
