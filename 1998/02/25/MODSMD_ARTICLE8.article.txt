## Worst El Ni√±o storm of season kills seven 
### 
SANTA MARIA. Calif. (AP)
Two highway patrol officers on
their way to help a disabled
motorist were killed yesterday
when their car was pitched into a
gushing river swollen by a savage El
Nino storm that killed five others
and caused mudslides and torna
does.
The two-day storm, the worst
from El Nino this winter, blew out
of the water-logged state just hours
after the officers and at least three
other drivers were sucked into the
muddy river.
Two men were rescued by heli
copter, but divers searched for
other victims in the Cuyama River
near Santa Maria, about 2(H) miles
north of Los Angeles after part of
Highway 166 gave way.
The patrol car carrying Califor
nia Highway Patrol Officers Rick
Stovall and Britt Irvine was upside
down, buried under silt, mud and
debris. Crews with cranes attempt
ed to lift it from the river, which
washed out 1(K) yards of the rural
highway.

Stovall, 39, and Irvine, 4<), were
working the graveyard shift and
answering a disabled motorist call.
The last radio contact with them
was at 2:45 a.m., Lt. Paul Matthies
said at a news conference.
"They were out doing what they
are supposed to do. They were out
helping the public," Matthies said.
Matthies said a chaplain was
helping officers through the griev
ing process.
"The Highway Patrol is a fami
ly," he said. "We're going to be
going through a rough time. It hits
very hard."
The two men rescued by heli
copter were being treated for
hypothermia at a hospital. One was
in good condition and another was
undergoing surgery to repair a scalp
injury.
Elsewhere in California, two col
lege students were killed when a
tree fell on cars in the Los Angeles
suburb of Claremont; a man died in
a mudslide in Orange County; one
person died in a pilcup on a fog
shrouded and flooded highwav in

the San Joaquin Valley; and one
was dead and four missing in a car
that washed away in Tijuana, Mexi
co.
In Northern California, waves
chewed into a cliff beneath eight
precariously perched homes in
Pacifica south of San Francisco, and
residents remained barred from 500
homes around Clear Lake north of
Santa Rosa as the lake was at its
highest level since 1909.
In the Sierra Nevada, El Nino
dumped up to 2 feet of snow, trig
gering one road-closing avalanche
south of Reno.
A wall of mud plowed down
Laguna Beach Canyon Road in
Orange County about 12:30 a.m.,
tossing about residents as they
scrambled from their homes, said
police Sgt. Bob Rahaeuser.
"I was just rocking and rolling,
and just desperately crawling my
way to the top of wherever I was."
Ann Quilter said. "Every second,
you're trying to keep your hands in
front of your face to create an air
pocket so that you can breathe."
