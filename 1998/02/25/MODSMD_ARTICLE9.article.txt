NEW ORLEANS (AP)
Despite threats of a police crack
down, bared bosoms and barely
there costumes flourished yester
day in the French Quarter on
Mardi Gras.
The currency of the day was
strings of cheap plastic beads,
which men dispensed by the hand
ful in exchange for flashes of
breasts.
With the weather a sunny 70
degrees, police said the crowds
could top 1 million, which would
be a Fat Tuesday record. Police
said spectators were 15 rows deep
in spots, and b().(KK) to 7().()<K) peo
ple gathered along eight blocks of
Bourbon Street alone.
Parades ran several hours late
because a float on Zulu — the tra
ditional black spoof that rolls first
— broke down. That delayed the
parade of Rex, king of Carnival,
and the many parades that fol
lowed.
Civic leaders had complained
that New Orleans' Mardi Gras
was getting a reputation else
where around the country as an
orgy in the streets. And police

spokesman Lt. Marlon Defillo
said the department would take a
harder line against lewd behavior
this year. But there was little sign
of any crackdown that in the
French Quarter.
"I stop it if I see it. but so far I
haven't really seen any," said a
policeman standing beneath ;i bal
cony where women drew cheers
for raising their shirts. "This group

isn't complaining."
Crowds of men with cameras
surrounded Dorothy McGee, a
26-year-old secretary from
Boston, as she repeatedly raised
her cut-off T-shirt while her hus
band. Doug, looked on.
"This is really fun," she said,
heavily laden with beads. "1
wouldn't do it at home, but what
the heck."
