# Grads get tax advice
## Students, administrators organize seminars 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
As part of the continuing
effort to increase graduate
student events on campus,
three tax seminars were
held yesterday to help stu
dents file taxes.
The seminars were put

tbgether in a joint effort by the Graduate Stu
dent Council, the Graduate Student Program
ming Board and the Dean of Students' Office.
Three separate seminars were held: one at
noon in Building 380, one at 4 p.m. in the Old
Union Clubhouse, and one at 7 p.m. in Rains
Houses.
More than f>(H) students attended the semi
nars, which were given by Certified Public Ac
countants from the Hood and Strong account
ing firm based in San Francisco and Menlo
Park.
The idea for the seminars came from gradu
ate student Robert Rudnitsky. It was intended
to address the legislative changes put into effect
this year that changed student income incorpo
ration on tax forms.

To tailor the seminar to the students, the
board send out e-mails asking for potential
questions related to tax issues. According to
English doctoral student Meta Jones, one of the
people responsible for putting together the
event, more than 200 graduate students re
sponded with specific questions.
In addition to answering these questions, the
seminar also gave basic information on how to
file tax forms.
According to Dean of Students Marc Wais.
this seminar is one of three types of programs
put together by the council.
The first type is large social events, such as
the spring mixer that attracted over 8(H) gradu
ate students and the fall jazz festival that at
tracted over 1,2(X). The second type is educa
tional programs such as this one. The third type
of program includes smaller-scale activities that
aim to connect the students with one another.
According to Wais. these programs are part
of the continuing effort on the part of the Uni
versity to improve graduate student involve
ment.
"As Dean of Students. 1 believe that we can


Wais
do a lot more to provide resources
and activities for graduate students
on this campus," Wais said.
These programs are aimed at
providing opportunities for gradu
ate students to meet and interact
with one another and to foster a
stronger connection between stu
dents and the University.
"We have a very rich and vibrant
graduate student body here, and we
want them to be aware of the pro
grams that are available to them and

for them to embrace the school
more," Wais said.
All of the programs provided by
the council and the board are initiat
ed by graduate students.
According to Jones, the groups
are actively seeking student involve
ment in programming activities, es
pecially from graduate students with
families.
Also involved in putting together
programming for graduate students
are the graduate student residences.
According to Wais, the "graduate
student residences have been full
partners in doing social program
ming for the students."
