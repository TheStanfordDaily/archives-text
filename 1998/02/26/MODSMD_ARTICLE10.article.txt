## U.S. and Britain write resolution to back U.N.

UNITED NATIONS (AP)
Despite some reservations, the
United States and Britain crafted a
resolution yesterday to back the
U.N. deal to open suspected
weapons sites in Iraq — with the
consequences of Iraqi violation
clearly spelled out.
v\ny explicit threat of force,
however, was unlikely to he sup
potted by the other three perma
nent Security Council members,
Russia, France and China, which
hafl resisted a threatened British-
Arperican military strike before the
agreement was reached.
That means the wording will be
crucial, as it was with the deal U.N.
Sewetary-General Kofi Annan bro
kered with Baghdad.
ilfl am confident that there will be
a draft resolution" British Ambas
sador John Weston said, without
elaborating. He hoped to have it
bv today.
."The U.S. ambassador to the
U.N., Bill Richardson, said Ameri
■
can' diplomats were working with
Britain on the proposal.
defended the Annan agree
ment yesterday against criticism
from Senate Majority Leader Trent
Loft. R Miss.
ijrle called it a sellout to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
"'We believe this is a good agree

ment," Richardson said, reiterating
that it needed to be tested. "We see
the British initiative as a good way
to enforce the agreement."
The U.N. chief negotiated the
deal over the weekend with Sad
dam. It would open eight presiden
tial sites that Baghdad had declared
off-limits to U.N. inspectors, pro
vided the inspectors were accompa
nied by a team of diplomats chosen
by Annan.
The inspectors must certify that
Iraq has destroyed its weapons of
mass destruction before U.N. sanc
tions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
The United States ruled out any
swift easing of the sanctions. Such a
move is "a long way off," State
Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said yesterday.
While giving their general
approval of the accord, Britain and
the United States wanted to spell
out that the inspectors from the
U.N. Special Commission, or
UNSCOM, would remain in charge
of the visits. They also asked Annan
for further information about how
the diplomatic visits would be car
ried out and who would be on the
team.
Annan was meeting with chief
U.N. inspector Richard Butler and
Annan's legal counsel, Hans Corell,

who helped draft the agreement, to
work out some procedural details
for the new U.N. teams.
The U.N. chief was expected to
name a head of the diplomatic team
in "a matter of days," IJ.N.
spokesman Fred Eekhard said.
Formal Security Council
approval of Annan's accord, in the
form of a resolution or otherwise,
isn't required legally. But a resolu
tion would give the agreement
political clout, and — if the United
States and Britain are successful
would codify any response if Sad
dam reneged.
A resolution should uphold the
idea that a violation could prompt
air strikes by U.S. and allied forces,
Richardson said.
"We want to find a way to certi
fy that if Iraq violates the agree
ment, there are going to be very
serious consequences, and it's the
president's diplomacy, backed by
force, that has made this agreement
possible," he said on CBS-TV's
"Good Morning America."
Russia's U.N. Ambassador,
Sergey Lavrov. said any such threat
was ill-conceived.
The language, Lavrov said,
"must be aimed at making this hap
pen. not making any threat which at
this particular stage is not appropri
ate."
