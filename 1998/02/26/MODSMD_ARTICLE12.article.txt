# Clinton visits Florida to offer condolences
## 
### 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. (Al>)
Quoting from the Bible and
stroking the hand of a shaken sur
vivor, President Clinton mourned
lives lost to Florida tornadoes and
pledged federal help in rebuilding
••'brick by brick, home by home."
• , The president also voiced inter
est yesterday in an early warning
.system that could use existing U.S.
to forecast tornadoes.
! "Americans are praying for you

and pulling for you, and whatever it
is within our power to do to help
you return to normal lives, we will
do," Clinton told survivors and res
cue workers.
A $3 million Labor Department
grant for temporarily unemployed
Floridians marked the first of mil
lions of dollars in federal aid to the
state in response to the twisters that
cut through central Florida.
The tornadoes hit Monday

killing at least 39 people with winds
of up to 210 mph.
Clinton, whose helicopter cir
cled low three times over the Win
ter Garden area outside Orlando,
held his chin in his left hand as he
viewed the aftermath: an upended
ranch-style house, its lower half dis
solved into a wreck of shards
shoved into the ground; an Ameri
can flag fixed to a stubby pole in the
lawn outside a flattened home.

He said his own home state,
Arkansas, is too familiar with tor
nadoes' random, deadly power.
"No matter how many of these I
have seen over the last 20 years. I
don't think anybod\ can fail to be
moved and awestruck by ... the
lives and the treasures that can be
taken away in a matter of just ;i few
seconds,"Clinton said at the
destroyed Ponderosa Park Camp
around.
