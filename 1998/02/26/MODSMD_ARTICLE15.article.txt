After two years of work, PC
users have access to kinder,
simpler printing system

PC USERS, REJOICE! Stanford
has taken a long-overdue step
forward in the struggle for PC
equality on campus.
No longer will you have to bother
with messy UNIX commands and
postscript files to print your term
papers from your rooms. A new proce
dure will allow you to print from your
PC terminal in two simple steps.
The new procedure recognizes that
Stanford does not live alone in a Mac
intosh Utopia.
While the majority of students do
own Macs, PCs dominate in most sec
tors of the real world. At Stanford. 40
percent of students who own a com
puter own Macs and 42 percent own
PCs.
The PC tide is rising.with this year's
freshman class. Among this group, 28
percent own Macs and 56 percent have
PCs. Macs are losing ground even here
at Stanford, one of Apple Computer,
Inc.'s last bastions of support.
That's why it's more important than
ever to integrate PCs into campus sys
tems.
If students don't learn to work with
their PCs now. when will thev?

Employers expect students to leave
college with strong computer skills.
After all, we are supposed to be the
Internet generation.
Adults think we're up on technolo
gy. ITiey expect us to use phrases like
"snail mail" and they think we feel at
home in "cyberspace." What does it
say about our university if half our stu
dents can't easily print from their com
puters? Apple llE's could do that 10
years ago.
PC users may have wondered why
they've gotten the cold shoulder while
their Mac-using dormmates could hap
pily click "Print" from their rooms and
casually swing by the cluster to
retrieve their documents on the way to
class.
Xhe answer is twofold. It's not that
Residential Computing has been
deliberately shafting PC users. But
with only four central staffers. Res
Comp relies on students to develop its
systems. And PC programs like Win
dows place restrictions on systems that
run on them.
True, the new system is not as easy
as printing from a Mac. PC users must
download and install LPR (line print
er) software to print from their rooms.
They must then select their documents
from a Web page using their leland
usernames and passwords.
But the process is far simpler than it
used to be. And Res Comp is promis
ing to continue improvements.
