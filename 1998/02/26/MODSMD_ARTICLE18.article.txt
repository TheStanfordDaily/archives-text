## The
						evolution of indifference 
### 
I FIRST encountered
homeless people dur
ing a family vacation
in Mexico City. Walking
through a plaza, I stared as
though I were at a zoo.
There were homeless peo
ple everywhere.

Mothers with kids
my age were huddled in the shadows of
buildings. In front of the steps, a man
dressed in a colorful native costume was
dancing to the beat of a tape-recorded
drum. His bowl was lull of coins. People
gave him money "because they wanted to.
An elderly woman moveSS*through the
crowd, pushing a cup underneath people's
arms until they dropped in a coin. I disap
proved of this. People gave to her out of
guilt.
1 was seven then. Hut my reaction to
homeless people has changed over the
years. What used to be a curiosity has
become a familiar part of my environment.
And with that familiarity comes indiffer
ence.
I am from Orange County in Southern
California, where the chance of seeing
someone asking for money in front of the
supermarket is about as great as seeing a
Democrat.
When I first came to Stanford. Palo Alto
reminded me of my hometown. University
Avenue was inhabited by people lounging
in upper middle-class comfort, sipping lattes

and pretending their bagels were from New
York.
The only difference was the occasional
homeless person on the sidewalk.
My first instinct was to give them the
money they asked for. What are a few coins,
anyway? But then I thought, Oh, it's proba
bly going to go towards booze or drugs. I'd
be hurting more than helping. What was that
old proverb? dive a man a fish and he eats
for a day; teach a man to fish and he eats for
a lifetime. Or something like that. Anyway,
there's nothing I can do about it.
And by that time. I'd already passed the
person by.
Soon 1 didn't even bother thinking of
excuses anymore. 1 just hurried by. trying
not to glance sideways, mumbling "sorry"
as 1 passed.
I tried to behave like other people who
gave a coin or two but wouldn't look at any
one's face. And then I stopped doing even
that.
A panhandler approached me in the
Quad, asking for train fare. I said that I had
no change. He looked at me directly and
said, "Do you have any bills?"
1 hadn't actually said that I didn't have
any money.
Unwillingly, I handed him a dollar while
thinking. Don't think I'm a pushover. I'm
not doing this because I'm weak, because I
can't say no to you. I was resentful because
I'd been caught in a lie.
1 felt ever more resentful a couple of

months later when I saw the same man on
campus asking two tourists for money.
Palo Alto's situation isn't unusual.
Oxford, England, didn't look familiar to me
just because of the swank shops in a presti
gious university setting. There, too, the
haves existed side-by-side with the have
nots, and the discrepancy was perhaps even
more striking.
Homeless people virtually lived beneath
students' windows. You encountered them
on the streets opposite the Radcliffe Cam
era and on the way to the Bodleian Library.
The only djjference between, the .homeless
in Oxford and the ones I'd seen oh I Jniver
sitv Avenue was that they called you love."'
And my reaction to them was the same. It
was just easier for me to convince myself it
was a problem that I didn't have to deal
with. Alter all, I was in another country.
The frightening thing is that I've learned
to live with it so well. It disturbs me that I
can now walk past the homeless without
that nervous, apologetic quickening to my
step. It disturbs me that I've stopped saying
"sorry" when I walk by.
As a child. I had been shocked to see
people on the streets asking for money. But
now I see them all the time. It's become far
too easy to ignore them.
