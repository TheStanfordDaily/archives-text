Greeks aren't all alike
The most recent slew of Daily columns
and community responses have largely
ignored an important distinction which we
wish to emphasize.
As Greek leaders, we are strong propo
nents of a cohesive, cooperative Greek
community. We also feel it necessary to
draw a few important distinctions between
fraternities and sororities on this campus.
Understandably, a great deal of recent
criticism of housed Greeks is placed in a
context in which fraternities are the only
housed group. However, to base skepticism
about sorority housing based on the experi
ence of housed fraternities grossly oversim
plifies an extremely complex issue.
In his Feb. 23 column. Aly Remtulla sup
ported his assault on all housed Greeks with
the allegation that fraternities have "dwin
dling membership, alcohol-related inci
dents. property defamation and reputations
for misogyny and homophobia."
We question the logic and fairness of
making blanket assumptions about the
value of sororities as housed groups based
on close-minded stereotypes of fraternities.
Sororities have not occupied houses on
this campus for over 50 years, and today's
sorority organizations bear little resem
blance to our predecessors or to existing
fraternities.
We have different Rush processes, high
er membership totals within individual
chapters and different national rules. As
females, sorority women hold different per

spectives than our male counterparts.
Like most other Stanford students,
Greek and non-Greek, sorority women are
enthusiastic, intelligent, ambitious and com
passionate.
We recognize that many members of the
Stanford community will not embrace an
increase in the number of Greek houses or
the monumental shift toward gender equal
ity that the new housing system represents.
However, dialogue in the public forum
should be informed and constructive. Blan
ket assumptions, uninformed rhetoric and
outdated stereotypes are neither informa
tive nor constructive in the dialogue. We
recognize that Greek groups embody differ
ent goals, characteristics and values. We ask
that you do as well.

Disrespect hurts debate
Dan Cieyser begins his response to Aly
Remtulla's column with "a single overbear
ing question." "Is Aly Rcmtulla the devil?"
While I respect Geyser's right to state his
opinion, he should do so in the same intelli
gent and articulate manner as Rcmtulla. He
might begin his discussion by asking. "Are
Remtulla's assertions accurate?" or "Are
there aspects of Greek life which Rcmtulla
overlooks?" I would anticipate, if not a sin
cere attempt to understand an opposing

viewpoint, at least a recognition of another
student's right to hold that opinion.
Instead. Geyser's letter is thoughtless
and belligerent. Besides the blatant shock
value of his initial question. Geyser uses his
opening phrase to begin a personal attack
which refers to nail polish fumes and tenure
for Gupta chants.
Derogatory references to another stu
dent's sexual orientation or activism on
behalf of a minority group have no place in
a thoughtful critique. But such off-handed
and offensive remarks have an important
place in Geyser's letter. Indeed, I would
describe his entire letter as a discursive list
of insults.
In a few short paragraphs. Geyser picks
several bones: Heather Dunn, he claims,
cannot compete with his own insurmount
able wit. People who do not attend Stanford
are also not as smart as he is.
Rather than examining Remtulla's
observations about the way in which race,
class, educational opportunities and frater
nal organizations perpetuate the elite,
Geyser postulates a theory of "genetic stu
pidity."
Geyser also informs us that those who
stay home and watch television are not as
much fun as people who attend Greek par
ties. Neither are members of Ballet Folk
lorico de Stanford or Stanford Taiko.
The derogatory tone of Geyser's letter
devalues the individuals and the campus
organizations that he mentions. The only
ones spared are his beloved Greek organi
zations and the women who "are so close to
being an official part of the fraternity that
they even spend the night."

Geyser's offensive letter only substanti
ates accusations that homophobia, racial
insensitivity, sexism and elitism are alive
and well in some pockets of the Greek com
munity. His comments demonstrate the
arrogance and exclusiveness of such organi
zations far more vividly than either Remtul
la's Feb. 23 column or the thoughtful
response written by Mark Bell. In that
capacity, perhaps. Geyser has provided a
service in furthering the debate about the
role of fraternities at this university.
I hope that future contributions to this
discussion will contain more than self
aggrandizing remarks and cheap humor at
others' expense.

Limit specialty housing
There have been many concerns, and
rightfully so, about the impending housing
system changes. Most have focused on the
question of whether Greek organizations
should be housed.
The issue at hand for the majority of the
student body is much less pointed than that.
At the core of the debate is the possibility of
reducing the number of Row houses avail
able in the Draw.
Currently the Row contains the most
sought-after housing as evidenced by Draw
results. The Row also has a number of spe
cialty houses, including theme houses and
fraternity houses. Whether these houses
should exist is not the issue; what concerns

me is the number of houses that will even
tually be devoted to organizations which
represent a minority of the student body.
There should be a cap on the number of
Row houses taken out of the Draw and
devoted to specialty organizations. The
majority of students, who choose not to join
specific organizations, should not be denied
the opportunity to live in housing that many
students obviously want.
Some may argue that at many universi
ties cooperative and self-operated style
housing is not available to the majority of
students. However, at such universities
there are more affordable and convenient
off-campus options than there are here.
Stanford's on-campus housing is unique
because it offers undergraduates many
options.
The Row house experience is an espe
cially rewarding and enriching option. Stu
dents should not miss out on the Row expe
rience because they have choosen not to
participate in specialty housing.
The only way to keep University housing
equal and fair is to ensure that a majority of
the Row is available to most of the students
who participate in the Draw.

who participate in the Draw.
