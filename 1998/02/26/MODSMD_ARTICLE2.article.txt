# LGBCC director issue still a contentious one
## Budget issues clash with community priorities 
### Shelley Ingram Contributing writer 
The issue of funding for the Lesbian,
(iay and Bisexual Community Center re
mains contentious, as University budget
constraints encounter a gay community
dealing with a lack of resources and.in
some quarters, a feeling of inequity.
In December. Vice Provost for Student
Affairs James Montoya announced that
the center would for the first time in its his
tory have a paid director. However, the
position will only be half-time, not the full
time position center members had hoped
for.
The full-time director proposal pre
pared by the center outlines that Stanford
spends $3,(XX) annually on gay program
ming. while Duke University spends four
times as much, at $12.(XX). Cornell Univer
sity spends $55,(XX).
The planned half-time directorship at
Stanford does surpass other schools, such

as Dartmouth and Bucknell Universities,
which fund less than a half-time employee
for gay and lesbian issues. But it is behind
other schools such as Cornell, which has
two full-time staff members and Universi
ty of Michigan, which has the funding
equivalent of four full-time employees.
A part-time director leaves the
LGBCC and the Women's Center as the
only two ethnic and community centers at
Stanford without full-time employees.
The other centers have at least two full
time employees, such as El Centro Chi
cano. or one full and two half-time posi
tions. such as the American Indian Stu
dent Center.
Montoya acknowledged that the
LGBCC and Women's Center were the
lowest funded, but said. "While I can justi
fy a need for the LGBCC to have a full
time director. I am balancing these impor
tant needs across the full range of needs
for student services, ranging from financial
aid to adaptive technology for our dis

abled community to housing for graduate
students."
The decision for a part-time position
has left many gays and lesbians feeling
alienated from Stanford.
Stephanie Dittmer, Class of '97. who
helped draft the center's full-time director
proposal, said that students feel beaten
after working with the University for 10
years.
"I feel they've won â€” they've broken
us. It is a horrible feeling."
With the hundreds of gay. lesbian and
bisexual students paying Stanford tuition,
many students feel the $35,500 to $45,500
annual salary needed for a full-time direc
tor is easily justified.
"Is it appropriate to spend thousands of
dollars on a party with beer and burritos.
and then attempt to justify a part-time ap
pointment by lack of funds?" asked Ben
jamin Lawrance. a history doctoral stu-
