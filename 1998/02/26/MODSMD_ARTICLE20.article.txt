## Privacy and Puritanism: sex in America 
### 
T.J. Babbitt

I WANT TO tell you a story about sex in
America. It is a story about witch hunts,
smear campaigns and endless investiga
tions. Money wasted on lawyers and prose
cutors. Careers destroyed for no good rea
son. All to enforce a harsh moral code no
one believes in anymore.
You might think I stole my story from
The New York Times. OK, so maybe I did.
Hut don't worry, this isn't about Mill Clin
ton's sex life. It's not about whether the pres
ident is above the law.
It's about a policy he helped create. T he
media calls it "Don't ask. don't tell, don't
pursue." Hut it hasn't worked out that way.
Now more than ever, members of the mili
tary are harassed, investigated and fired
because of their sex lives.
I wonder if Clinton sympathizes with
these poor men and women. I wonder it he
regrets the injustices his policy has created.
He should, because he is suffering their
fate right now. He can't talk to anyone
except for I Hilary and his lawyers without
the fear that his conversation partner will he
subpoenaed. 1 le can hardly take a bathroom

break without raising eyebrows.
He's in the shoes of tens of thousands of
homosexual service members. They too must
eradicate any trace of their personal life from
their conversations. They too carry a heavy
burden — the fear that their personal lives
will become public and their careers will be
destroyed. It is bizarre and unjust.
Now that he's experiencing record popu
larity. it's time for President ('linton to revis
it one of the most immoral compromises of
his presidency. He could come out swinging
for sexual privacy, and no one would think
that he was just being weaselly about his per
sonal life.
IHTuiiii}! gray areas
Minding your own business is a venerable
American tradition, especially when sex is
involved. But recently there has been some
debate on campus about when to cover our
eyes and when to call the police.
In their columns about sexual assault last
week, Marian Hammond and Kimberly Sol
heim argued that our reluctance to judge oth
ers' sexual behavior is responsible for a high

rate of sexual assault.
Solheim proposes that "a survivor may
convince herself that it was not sexual assault
because she didn't say no.'" Solheim*s hypo
thetical survivor is right: II she didn't say no
and she wasn't physically threatened, she
wasn't assaulted.
Hammond argues that "the definition of
rape must be expanded to include incidents
which are committed under the influence ol
alcohol or as a result of verbal coercion." II
alcohol is present or you try to talk someone
into having sex with you, you are suddenly in
a "gray area" that Hammond thinks might
qualify as assault.
The basic message of both columns is that
college students don't know enough sexual
etiquette to handle their own private affairs.
It's true that many of us are still learning. Hut
it is insulting to tell women that they have
been bullied or coerced or even raped if they
consent to sex after some equivocation. It is
insulting to tell women that they are no
longer able to give their consent if they've
been drinking.
Trving to talk someone into having sex is

a time-honored tradition. Selling yourself is
ail-American. It may not always work, but
trying for what you want — without resorting
to intimidation, harassment or violence is
not a bad way to live. If you sell yourself well
enough, you might even become president
one day.
(low much pri>ac>?
Ah. yes. back to the president and his ...
problems. Perhaps Hillary Clinton is right,
and the only people who matter in a mar
riage are the people involved. We can only
hope that number is not too large.
That America has recently expanded its
level of sexual tolerance is just fine. It is also
beside the point.
We have cause for worry if covering up a
mysterious relationship has become a prima
ry goal of the Clinton administration.
The president is not just accused of having
sex. He is accused of lying under oath and
encouraging others to do the same. It is not
illegal to lie on television, but he also stands
accused of that. At any rate, he has made
some puzzling statements that don't square

with the tacts.
How did America get into this upsetting
position? It's not the press' fault; it's Clin
ton's. We would be better off it he had con
sistently advocated the right to sexual pri\.i
cy.
We would be better off il he had settled
the Paula Jones lawsuit instead of having his
lawyers portray her as a slut. We would be
better off if he had declined to comment pub
licly on his own sex life, rather than issuing
strangely worded half-denials.
The damage comes not from Clinton's
sexual behavior but from the growing sense
that he is unable to tell the truth even
when he is legally obliged to do so.
If Clinton isn't bending the truth or the
law. all he has to do is tell us the whole story
Hut he hasn't. Last month, he said that the
American people deserved a lull account ot
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
We are still waiting.
