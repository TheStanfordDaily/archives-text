## Sun Devils next for Card Women's basketball team tries not to look past Sun Devils 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
With senior night and a rematch against No.
7 Arizona looming on Saturday, tonight's 7:30
contest against Arizona State at Maples Pavilion
could easily take a back seat for the fifth-ranked
Stanford women's basketball team.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Tonight: No. 5 Stanford (17-5, 13-1 Pacific 10
Conference) vs. Arizona State (10-3, 6-8) at
Maples Pavilion, 7:30 p.m. RADIO: KZSIJ (90.1
FM), KPB A (1220 AM)

But head coach Tara VanDerveer thinks the
Sun Devils (10-13, 6-8 Pacific 10 Conference)
provide just the kind of game the Cardinal (17-
5,13-1) needs at this point in the season.
"Arizona State makes us play against what
we need to play against," VanDerveer said.

"Thinking about where we want to go and what
kind of things have been disruptive to us. it's
been quickness on the perimeter. They have
that, and they play smart. They make you do the
right thing."
In the last meeting between these two teams,
the Sun Devils managed to keep the game at a
painfully slow pace. Despite the strategy, Stan
ford posted HI points in the 27-point Cardinal
win. But VanDerveer still feels Arizona State is
a team to be dealt with.
"It's not like roadkill or something." Van-
Derveer said. "They will come out and battle.
We had to work hard against them, but honest
ly, I think we're playing a lot better [now]. If we
come out and do well, it shows that we're able to
handle their pressure better. We've got to take
care of the ball. They'll force us to do that, or it
will be embarrassing."
But no matter how seriously VanDerveer
and her squad are taking the unranked Sun Dev
ils, the game can't possibly stand up to the ex

citement ol Saturday's 1 p.m. contest.
The Wildcats (IK-5, 11-3) were the last team
to heat Stanford, a 91-90 buzzer-beating prayer
that was answered for the Arizona win on Jan.
12.
That loss snapped the Cardinal's 48-game
conference win streak, and now the Wildcats sit
two places behind Stanford in the national polls
and two games back in the conference standings.
And to add to the afternoon's excitement, it's
senior night.

most successful classes in colle
giate basketball.
"The accomplishments of this
senior class are outstanding by
anyone else's measuring stick ex
cept Stanford's," VanDerveer
said, "because our own standards
are so high in terms of wanting a
national championship. And
maybe that's really good in that
people are really hungry for it and
are working really hard.
"Sometimes when things have
been really hard this year, I just
[haven't given up] the idea of win
ning a national championship for
our seniors."
But before Stanford can think
about the national championship,
it will have to finish out the season
and make its way through the re
gional playoffs.
And the way things are shaping
up on the national scene, that's not
so far out of the Card's reach. At
this point. Stanford is a lock for a
two seed in the tournament and
could potentially grab the No. 1
seed in the West Regional.
"It doesn't matter." Van-
Derveer said of the seedings. "I
think this is a better No. 2 team.
This is an underdog team: we pla\
better that way.
"It diK'sn't matter to me. but 1
hope we stay in Oakland just be
cause of the travel. And we'd get
great lan support."
1 he first and second rounds ot
the tournament will likely gi\e the
seniors two more games at Maples
after this weekend, but first they'll
probably be looking to leave their
mark in their last regular-season
homestand.
"When you have those players,
let's go for it," VanDerveer said of
the seniors.
"Even though we struggled
early and even though it's been
rocky a little bit. we can finish real
ly strong.
"It would be really exciting to
win with them."
