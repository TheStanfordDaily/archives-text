Family Tennis Stadium.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
â–  Yesterday's result: No. 5 Stanford
6, St. Mary's 0

The Gaels were clearly over
matched. as the Cardinal (11 -0) ran
away with all six singles matches in
straight sets. Stanford lost only 10
games in 12 sets.
"St. Mary's is a local school, and
the coach is a good friend of mine,"
Stanford head coach Frank Bren
nan said. "So we take these match
es to help them build their pro
gram."
The blowout victory, the Cardi
nal's 3()th consecutive win. served
as a good warm up for one of its
toughest matches of this season, a
dual match at No. 7 California this
Saturday that opens Pac-1() South
play.
"The timing of all this is good
for us." Brennan said. "Now we

have two full days to get ready for
Cal. 11 we had a Friday match
against them, I would be a little
tense."
In seven different sets yester
day, Stanford singles players did
not drop a match to their St. Mary's
counterparts.
In fact, two Cardinal competi
tors blanked their opponents in
both sets. Senior Julie Scott, mov
ing up a spot with sophomore
Anne Kremer taking the day off,
steamrolled St. Mary's Therese
Smythe in the No. 1 match 6-0,6-0.
Junior reserve Marissa Maclen
nan played a flawless match in the
No. 5 spot, blanking Erin Ran
dolph. 6-0, 6-0.
Sophomores Teryn Ashley and
Jennifer Heiser were nearly as
good. Ashley hau no trouble at all
with Gael Mili Shah in the No. 2
position, winning 6-0, 6-1. Heiser
posted the same score in her No. 4
match with Karen Holland.
Freshman Sarah Pestieau got
the ball rolling with a 6-3 win in the
first set at the No. 3 match. The
Cardinal freshman then joined the
fun by cruising in the second set to
earn a 6-3, 6-0 victory against Bar
bie Briggs.
In the No. h sput, senior Heidi
Stalla earned a singles victory by
defeating Dana McMahon 6-0,7-5.
A couple of matches were com
pleted outdoors before a brief rain
forced the rest of the action to the
indoor court.
"It was a good thing that the
match went indoors," Brennan
said. "It gave us a chance to get a
look at everyone individually."
The Golden Bears are not likely
to be such a Cakewalk.
"I'm looking forward to a very
tough, very competitive match on
Saturday," Brennan said.
"First of all, they are a good
team and second, they match up
pretty well with us. They want to
beat us badlv, and we want to beat

them badly. It's going to be a war."
Cal is riding some considerable
momentum heading into the Pac
-10 clash. The Bears performed well
at the National Women's Indoor
Team Championships last week
end. reaching the semifinals before
losing a tight match to No. 3 Duke.
And with No. 2 UCLA dropping
two matches in the very same tour
nament and suffering significant in
juries. the Bears are perhaps the
most serious threat to dethroning
Stanford as the conference
champs.
"Their ranking is going to go
up," Brennan said.
"Their only loss is to Duke, and
their last doubles team eked out
the win. I would put ( al well ahead
of UCLA in the conference right
now."
Leading the Bears' singles line
up is junior Amanda Augustus,

who is ranked No. 22 in the coun
try. Sophomores Esther Knox and
Claire Curran are not far behind in
the rankings, at No. 2 V J and No. 33.
respectively.
In doubles. No. 1S Augustus and
Amy Jensen form the topCal team,
while Knox and C urran combine to
form the No. 21 team in the eoun
try.
Stanford has plenty of its own
momentum with its 12 month win
ning streak and a championship
last weekend at the Team Indoors.
The Cardinal s No. 5 ranking is on
the climb as well after it beat Duke
in the title round.
But regardless of records and
rankings, any matchup between
Stanford and Cal is big.
"We always have some trouble
up there." Hrennan said. "We just
have to get focused and get ready
early."
