Young University.

MEN'S RUGBY
â–  TodayrStanford vs. Brigham
Young University at Maloney Field,
4 p.m.

BYU, unbeaten during its fall
season, may be one of the best teams
in the country and consequently one
of the better teams Stanford will
play this season. Although the
Cougars arc considered a top team,
they do not compete at nationals be
cause they don't play on Sundays.
They also have too many players on
their roster who have exceeded their
eligibility.
Regardless, BYI I is a strong and
physical team that will challenge a
( ardinal plagued by poor judgment

Although it is not a league game, the
match against the Cougars is an im
portant stepping stone for the Cardi
nal to erase and improve upon the
mistakes that have troubled the
team lately.
"We need to put together a solid
performance and cut out the mis
takes," said sophomore prop Eric
Ciroff. "II we do this, we have a
chance at beating one of the best
teams in the nation."
Stanford coach Franck Boivert
emphasized the need for the Cardi
nal to improve kicking and punting,
win the line outs and diminish the
amount of penalties. More impor
tant. a win over BYU could set the
winning precedent that this Cardi
nal team would like to continue for
the rest of the season.
"We definitely need to improve
where we failed in the last games."
Boivert said. "Then we will be con
sidered a top team in the country
But without this our achievements
will be limited."
The game begins at 4 p.m. at Mal
oney Field.
