# Another chance at Arizona State
## Sun Devils face a refocused Stanford 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
A victory over the Cardinal
would also help move the Sun Dev
ils off the NCAA bubble and into a
more solid position for a berth in
the championship tournament, a
spot no one believed they would be
in.
After Arizona State finished in
the basement of the conference last
year, interim coach Don Newman
inherited onl> seven players on
scholarships and seemed doomed to
wind up with another last-place
team.
That fact — along with a point
shaving scandal dug out of the
school's past — made Newman's job
the least enviable one in the confer
ence.
Hut the Sun Devils have pulled
together for one a remarkable turn
around. In addition to their victory
over the Cardinal, they knocked off
No. 17 Cincinnati, took No. 4
Kansas to overtime before losing
and fell one point sh\ of beating
rival Arizona.
They *ve proven the\ can keep up
with the nation's best teams, and a
win tonight will almost lock the invi
tation to the Big Dance.
But this time Arizona State uill
have to deal with someone thc\
barely know this year— Mark Mad
sen.
Last month, the sophomore
power forward played a limited 10
minutes against the Sun Devils in his
first game back from a stress frac
ture in his foot.
Since then his intensity has been
increasing and he's been getting
back into his old style of play. Mad
sen isn't hitting shots as accurately
as he had been at the beginning of
the season, but his growing presence
at the second post will help free up
Young down low.
"1 don't think he's back to that
level vet. and he may not get there
this year." head coach Mike Mont
gomery said of Madsen. "But he's
going to play hard
"We've seen glimpses of board
work that we had seen earlier on this
season, but maybe the timing offen
sively is not quite where we'd like to
have it. But without a doubt he'll
help because he's big and strong and
he'll play really hard."

Some might worry that the men's
basketball team will look past
tonight's game in anticipation of its
matchup with No. 2 Arizona on Sat
urday.
