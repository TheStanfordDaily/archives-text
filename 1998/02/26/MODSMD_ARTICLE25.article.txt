### Bobby Blunt Contributing writer 
Despite losing 24 14. the Stanford women's
rugby team played a strong game last week
against fierce competition from the I ni\crsit\ of
British Columbia.
I he opportunity to plav the lhunderbirds is
one of the highlights ot the season. Many of the
league teams that Stanford plays .ire new and do
not provide the type of competition the Cardinal
(5-2. 4-0 Northern California Women's Rughv

I caguc) needs to prepare for the playoffs

WOMEN'S RUGBY
■ 112 riday \ result: Stanford 14. 1 University of British
Columbia 24

"We were able to compete physically with
ÜBC," said head coach Franck Boivcrt. "Tacti
cally. we lost w;i\ too many balls in the nicks, hut
other than that, we had a strong performance that
we can be excited about."

"We were right there." junior flanker Judy
Mahtaban added. "We just needed to play a bit
more together, smarter rugby and just a step
quicker — like in the rucks."
Several players were strong, which contributed
to Stanford's performance. Senior scrumhalf
Beth Ripley kept Stanford on the attack by play
ing assertively and clearing many partially
trapped balls in the rucks.
Boivert also said he was particularly impressed
with the play of captain and senior
fullback Su/ie Hoffmann, who had
several nice plays including a 25-
meter run through several defend
ers for a try.
"I was excited for the team," said
Hoffmann, "especially the way we
pulled together in the second half."
The game was physical from the
very start, as the Thunderbirds out
sized the Stanford team. British Co
lumbia scored several early tries to
put Stanford down 14-0 at the half.
Before the second half ended, Stan
ford narrowed the gap.
The team showed a lot of courage
in what has been its toughest colle
giate game this year. The British Co
lumbia game acts as a progress re
port for Stanford, as the season is
now well under way.
The Cardinal will get another
chance to hone its skills before the
playoffs when the team travels to
British Columbia during spring
break to play both the Thunderbirds
and the University of Victoria.
"We are looking forward to hav
ing the chance to play in Canada.
Those games will come right before
we begin the playoffs and will be the
perfect final preparation before the
national tournament," said junior
winger Stephanie Riegg.
Although looking forward to the
British Columbia trip, Stanford has
not forgotten about the remainder
of the league season. Saturday. Stan
lord will play the Bay Area She-
Hawks club team. The Cardinal
plays club teams to fill out its sched
ule.

Although club teams often have
more experienced players, the
games are very helpful. They not
only provide a means of completing
the schedule but provide much bet
ter competition than some of the
young collegiate teams.
Stanford will not get much of a
break this week, as it will play a
rescheduled rain game against UC-
Davis Monday evening and then
rival UC-Santa Cruz Tuesday.
Monday's game will give the
Cardinal the chance to test the
newly formed Aggie team. Tues
day, the Banana Slugs will host the
Cardinal in what has become one
of the established rivalries of
Northern California women's
rugby. Both Stanford and Santa
Cruz have had organized teams for
many years now.
Stanford will have a chance to
season some of its new players in
these league games. The Davis and
Santa Cruz teams are not playing to
the same level as Stanford this year.
While on tour in California, the
British Columbia team also played
Santa Cruz, defeating the Banana]
Slugs by 90 points.
But this opportunity to start ]
younger players will prove very!
valuable to the Cardinal when sea-!
soned reserve players become a pre
cious commodity in the playoffs and
national tournament.
" The next week has a lot of'
games, which will be great," said
Mahtaban. " That will give us a '
chance to quickly implement the
corrections to our game — correc
tions that we were able to make
based on our performance against
ÜBC.
"It will be a ruebv week."
