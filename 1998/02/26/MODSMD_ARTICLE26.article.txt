MEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Saturday: Stanford (1-4, 1-4 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) vs. Michigan (2-4) at
Ford Center, 7 p.m.

The Wolverines (2-4. 1-2 Big Ten Confer
ence ) have become powerful foes only recent
ly. having shown dramatic improvement over
the past two years. Going into last year, the
Michigan team had nowhere to move but up.
After a winless season, the team named Kurt
Golder the new head coach and let him begin
the rebuilding process.
The team notched seven wins in 1997, im
pressive considering it managed only three in
1995 and 1996 combined. The Wolverines
were the most improved in the NCAA, bring
ing up their overall score by a whopping 14
points over the course of the season.
"I fully expect to keep improving at that
rate again this year." Golder said.
Of the Michigan squad, senior Ail-Ameri
can Tim McGraw and sophomore all
arounder Jose "LaLo" Haro will be the
Wolverines to watch at this Saturday's meet.
Unlike Michigan, the Cardinal (1-4, 1-4
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) has seen
the top before but is slumping a bit now. The
Stanford men. national champions in 1992,
1993 and 1995, are looking toward a resurrec
tion of past glories but know that with a young
and injury-ridden team, their journey is likely
to be an arduous one.
Senior co-captain Clarence Miao is not ex
pected to return from an arm injury until mid-
March. and his absence leaves the team with
out one of its strongest and most consistent
performers.
But the gymnasts remain optimistic.
"Gymnastics is not like basketball," said
head coach Sadao Hamada. "These competi

lions don't matter for the N( AAs. It's only
the regionals that matter."
Fortunately, Hamada feels the team can
pull itself together and work out some kinks in
its routines in time for regionals in about a
month. One of the primary goals of Saturday's
competition is to begin that process.
"Last week (against California] we missed
so many routines," Hamada said. "This week
we've been practicing a lot of routines so we
can hit more. I'm hoping to see a couple more
routines apiece."
While the season is well underway, Hama
da's teams are known for peaking late. Only
recently have the gymnasts begun exploring
more challenging combinations and new
tricks.

This week we've been practicing a
lot of routines. I'm hoping to see a
couple more routines apiece.'
— Coach Sadao Hamada

The team's inexperience with such rou
tines was evident as it fell to Cal last weekend.
This week, however, the gymnasts have
trained intensely in an effort to smooth out the
rough spots.
"We all have the same goals," said junior
co-captain Jeremy Herman. "It's time to per
fect our routines."
For the Cardinal squad, freshman Rico
Andrade looks to repeat his strong perfor
mance last weekend, while sophomore Jason
Katsampes plans to continue his fine all
around form. Herman hopes to regain the
form that made him an All-American on the
pommel horse in 19%.
"Only two of our five guys hit their high
bar routines" last week, Hamada said. "That's
not enough. At least three, maybe four, rou
tines need to be hit in each event this week
end."
If the Cardinal achieves this goal and posts
a victory over the feisty Wolverines, they
should feel much more confident about their
chances in the upcoming regionals.
