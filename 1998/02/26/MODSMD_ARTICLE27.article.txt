# Heather Owen breaks on through
## Owen raps about school, life and her rollercoaster career 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
For Heather ()wen, Stanford was
a long time coming.
Not only because it was a place
she was dead set on going ever since
she attended its basketball summer
camps, but also because she had in
teracted with all her incoming class
mates at national high school tour
naments prior to arriving on the
Farm.
"I thought we had great potential
as a class," Owen said. "I knew
everyone that I came in with. I
played with Regan (Freuen) on
AAI) for I don't know how many
years. Then Chandra (Benton)
joined that team my senior year. I
played against Naomi (Muli
tauaopele's) AAU team constantly
in scrimmages and tournaments.
Olympia (Scott) and I were room
mates at the Kodak Ail-American
game, and Kristin (Folkl) was also
there. So we had interacted a lot be
fore we got here, so that was cool."
Three conference titles and Final
Four appearances later, senior for
ward Owen and her classmates
stand on the verge of their final
homestand, ready to wrap up one of
Stanford's greatest four-year runs in
the program's history.
But the road has been a slightly
different one for the Moscow,
Idaho, native. After three years of
Hashes of brilliance and nagging in
juries, Owen has finally started to
come into her own, starting all 22
games this season and successfully
filling the void that fellow forward
Mulitauaopele left due to injury.

"The No. 1 thing (for Owen) is
being healthy," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "She's
gone through stress fractures, bro
ken fingers, mono, all kinds of dii
ferent things that have not allowed
her to play to her potential.
"More than anything, she's also
being more aggressive. This year,
she does everything quicker. She's
using her strength and her jumping
ability — she's got great hops. She's
really improved a lot."
Owen first started playing bas
ketball in the fourth grade, although
by high school, volleyball and track
were also in the mix. But it was bas
ketball that reaped the most re
wards, as Owen was named state
Player of the Year her junior and se
nior years in high school. With these
and other major honors, colleges
were definitely knocking on Owen's
door, but Stanford had long been the
top choice.
"The whole Stanford label was
pinned on me at a really early age."
Owen said jokingly. "I was just sick
of hearing of hearing. 'Oh,
Heather's going to go to Stanford."
So I was thinking, 'What if I went
someplace else? What if I signed at
Idaho or something?' Not like I was
ever going to do it.
"I've wanted to come to Stanford
for a long time," Owen said, turning
serious once again. "I went to sum
mer camp here — loved it and loved
the people on the team."
Contributing right away. Owen
was able to put up decent numbers
her first season, shooting 50 percent
from the floor and reaching double
figures in scoring six times. But then

she had minor knee surgery prior to
her sophomore year and suffered a
broken pinkie last season. Making it
all the more frustrating was the fact
that the latter injury came two weeks
after scoring a career-high 24 points
at Washington.
" This year has been a really good
year for me," Owen said. "I've had
an opportunity to play more due to
the fact that I haven't been injured
and didn't have to be so sporadic in
my practice time. [ The injuries] were
just so random, like my pinkie fin
ger."

More than anything,
she's also being more
aggressive. She's
really improved a lot.'
— Coach Tara VanDerveer

Indeed, this season has definitely
been the breakthrough year for the
senior. Flaying regularly for the first
time in her career, she has averaged
more than 10 points a game while
crashing the boards to the tune of
nearly six rebounds per contest. Last
weekend, she made her homecom
ing a successful one, pouring in a
team-high 17 points against Wash
ington State in nearby Pullman,
Wash.
"She's really developed into one
of the those post players who can
shoot from the outside; she proved
that last weekend." said senior for
ward Vanessa Nvgaard. "She's be
come a leader on our team.

"She's always a calming factor,"
Nygaard continued. "Everyone
lcx)ks at her and says, 'Oh, every
thing's going to be OK.' So I appre
ciate that, and it's almost always an
assist every time you pass into her, so
1 like that, too."
Despite the marked improve
ment in her own play, Owen still
found it tough to cope with the
team's slow start.
"You know, you're really excited
about your senior year and for the
past three years, we've won games,"
Owen said. "Then all of a sudden,
Hmm, we're not winning anymore.
What's going on?' It was a new ex
perience; we didn't know how to
deal with it.and I think we learned a
lot about ourselves and just saw how
much we had to work and how much
we had to put in to get to where we
are today."
But through it all. Owen has ac
knowledged that her Stanford ca
reer has been well worth it. not only
because of the success she has expe
rienced but also because she was
part of a special class that has helped
her to grow as a player.
"The class has been almost like a
two-edged sword." VanDerveer
said. "It's positive in that she's had
people to play against and really
push her every day.
"But it's also created a lot of com
petition and maybe she hasn't got
ten some of the minutes, but I think
her choice in coming to Stanford w as
that she wanted to be part of a great
program. It's fun to see her hard
work pay off this year, but I think
she's just scratching the surface of
how good she can be."
