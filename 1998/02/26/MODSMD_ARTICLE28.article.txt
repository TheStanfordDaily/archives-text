WRESTLING
■ Saturday-Sunday: Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships in Fullerton, Calif.

ifiers: sophomore Zach Zimmerer, junior Beau
Weiner and senior co-captain Scott Chapman.
Chapman went 3-2 in the NCAAs last year, tak

' i
ing ninth and earning honorable mention All-
American status.
"All three have a good shot at qualifying
again," said Stanford head coach Chris Horpel.
"Chapman's bruised collarbone was very slow
in healing, but he seems to be doing OK now,"
Horpel said. "He should be well enough to quali
fy for the NCAAs."
Weiner will face tough competition in the 142-
pound division but hopes to qualify for the na
tionals by placing in the top four or by selection as
a wild-card entrant. Wrestlers must finish fifth or
sixth to qualify for wild-card selection.
Also anchoring the Cardinal lineup is sopho
more Warren Mcpherson, who beat junior B.J.
Sanchez in a wrestle-off for the start at 150 pounds.
"Warren looked very tough." Horpel said.
"Two of Warren's three losses came at 158
pounds, a weight he wrestled to help the team in

o
our final two duals."
Senior co-captain Jeff Grant seems to have re
covered fully from his midseason knee injury and
should be a factor at Fullerton. "Grant finished
the regular season strong and has a good shot at
qualifying for nationals," Horpel noted.
A new wrinkle for Stanford will be junior
Shane Cross's hid in the heavyweight division. A
natural 167-pounder, Cross "could upset some big
guys, but he will have to adjust his style to handle
their size." Horpel said.
"Although our strongest weight this year may
be 150 pounds, this weight happens to be very
tough in the Pac-10 tournament," he added. "If
Warren can win the close ones, he can qualify here.
"In all. our team really has come together and
I expect Ui to :>ujpn:»e *onie people at It
we have a good tournament, we should qualify be
tween three and six to the NCAAs."
