WOMEN'S SWIMMING
■ Today-Saturday: Pacific lOC (in
ference Championships in Long
Beach, Calif.

The Cardinal (9-0. 5-0 Pacific
10 Conference) completed the
first step by finishing the dual
meet portion of the season unde
feated. offering awesome displays
of its collective potential. Today,
when the Stanford squad com
petes in the Pac-10 champi
onships in Long Beach. Calif., the
team will try to duplicate its per
formance from last year.
That time, the Cardinal beat
the second place team by 36K
points en route to its ninth
straight title. With many of the
swimmers returning from last
year plus an amazing class of
freshmen, the results could easily
be as lopsided.
Stanford's depth, which helped
the team in dual meets, will prove
even more valuable at the cham
pionships. In each individual
event and relay, the Cardinal
should have multiple swimmers
place very high.
The Stanford squad runs very
deep in the sprint freestyle events.
In the 50 free, seniors Lindsay
Gassner and Becky Bicknell. |u
nior Emily Smith, sophomore Jes
sica Amey and freshman Siobhan
Cropper are all capable of making
finals. The 100 free will feature
many of the same swimmers in
Cropper, (iassner and Smith.
However, all the swimmers in
both these events will likely be
ptavmj? second fiddle to sopho
more Catherine Fox. Last year.
Fox set new meet records in both
events.
In (he longer freestyle events,
junior Amy Oberhelman leads
the Cardinal. She should place
highly in the 200. 500 and 1.650
free races. Freshman Lauren
Thies and sophomore Jessica
Tucker-Mohl should also make
their presence felt in these same
events.
The backstroke events should
feature Stanford's two star swim
mers. Fox was last year's champi
on in the KM) back, while fresh
man sensation Mist\ Hyman has
the second fastest time in the na
tion in the 2(H) back. The Cardinal
will likely rack up victories in
both events. Also looking to
make finals will be juniors Chan
tal Rawn and Su/anne Toledo
and senior Evi-Lynn Byer.
While Hyman is capable of
winning many events at this meet,
her domination will be most evi
dent in the 100 and 2(H) butterfly.
She currently has the fastest times
in the nation in both events and is
also among the fastest in the
world.
Amey. last year's runner-up.
and Rose will look to touch just
behind Hyman in the KM). In the
200 it will be Byer and senior

Michelle Collins who are looking
to make finals.
The breaststroke events are
the only ones in which Stanford
lacks depth, but luckily the team
will have junior Elin Austevoll
among the top hmshers in both
the I(H)and the 200. Junior Alison
Fealey should also be a finalist in
the 2<)o.
Both individual medley dis
tances will be stacked with Stan
ford swimmers. The 2(H) individ
ual medley will feature Rose
Rawn. Fealey and Austevoll. All
four are likely to final, a prime
display of Stanford's depth. In the
400. Thies and Fealey will both
challenge for the title. Byer also
has a shot at making finals.
In the relay events, the Cardi
nal should pull awav from the
other teams in the meet. Last year
the swimmers won four out of the
live relays, and there is no reason
they cannot match or better that
performance now.
The diving team should also be
on top in the Pac-10 competition.
Junior Carissa Zenorini and
freshman Kim Powers should be
in title contention in both the 1-
meter and 3-meter events.
As the favorite entering the
meet, the Cardinal knows that
solid performances will bring
home another title. Then the
team can move on to nationals
where a chance at redemption
awaits, a chance to prove that
once again the Cardinal is the pre
mier team in the country.
But for now the focus is on
these Pac-10 Championships and
making sure everyone knows the
team is the best in the conference
