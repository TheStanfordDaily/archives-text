## 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
Better late than never, especially
when ii comes to finding out you
won a Marshall Scholarship.
Aaron Padilla. who graduated in
1997. was tin an eight-month world
tour with friends and \v;is convinced
he hadn't received the scholarship.
He was in Dakar. Senegal when his
mother shocked him with news of
the scholarship via telephone.
"My mom hit me with the news,
and 1 was dumbfounded," Padilla
said. "It has very, very slowly sunk
in."
While most Marshall award win
ners were informed several months
ago, Padilla, who is still in Africa,
was only informed last week.
"I was completely surprised. I
never once considered that I could
still win after so much time," Padil
la said. "I know no details yet. since
I'm so hard to reach here in Africa.
I onlv assume that someone very

belatedly declined the Marshall,
and 1 was the next alternate in line.
It is really a dream for me."
The third Stanford student to re
ceive the Marshall award in 1998,
Padilla had to endure an extremely
competitive selection process be
fore gaining the prestigious scholar
ship. which finances recipients'
studies at British universities for
two years.
Having graduated with a bache
lor's degree in international rela
tions. Padilla intends to pursue a
master's in environment and devel
opment at Cambridge University in
the fall. Specifically, he will focus on
how developing nations attempt to
reconcile economic ambition with
enviromental concerns.
The Marshall award is the ideal
crown for Padilla's dynamic Stan
ford career. A member of I'lii Beta
Kappa, Padilla has become accus
tomed to awards, having received a
Chappell-Lougee Scholarship in
1995 and a Truman Scholarship in

19%.
At Stanford, Padilla served on
the Unifying Board of the Haas
Center for Public Service. He also
explored his musical interests, play
ing trombone in concert and march
ing hands. In addition, he was a co
coordinator for Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford.
"He's an absolutely outstanding
scholar." said Padilla's undergradu
ate adviser, Rosamond Navlor. se
nior research scholar and director
of studies at the Institute for In
ternational Studies.
"His honors thesis about issues
concerning greenhouse gases was
one of the top in the class last year.
He was really a very diligent and
hard-working student who also en
joyed all of the things that Stanford
had to offer in terms of the ex
tracurricular activities," she added.
Padilla ventured off campus as
well, conducting independent re
search in Costa Rica and Chile,
and interning for the U.S. State

Department and the Stockholm
Environment Institute in 1996.
Padilla's idea of fun includes run
ning marathons in New York,
Boston and Las Vegas and scaling
mountains in Colorado and
Venezuela.
"He seemed to take on chal
lenges and adventures that are asso
ciated with his work here at Stan
ford," Navlor said. "He seems to be
able to see the big picture and trans
late what he can do in the classroom
to what is feasible to do in the real
world. He really applies his acade
mic work to the field."
"He's really a spectacular stu
dent." said William Durham, chair
of the Anthropology Department
and Bing Professor in Human Biol
ogy. who recommended Padilla for
the award. "He's one of those stu
dents that we'll be reading about in
the papers one day. He has a broad
ranging and restless intellect. It's
perfect for him to get an interna
tional perspective."
