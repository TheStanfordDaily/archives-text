## 'Body Buildings' Adds Life to Architecture Literally 
### Sonya Schneider 
Where else but the San
Francisco Museum Of Modern
Art can you grunt while at
tempting to open the giant
mouth of a free-form lung en
titled "Body in Motion" or test
the balance of a massive draw
bridge with your own body
weight?
"Bodybuildings: Toward a
Hybrid Order of Architecture,"
is the latest architectural
display at the SFMOMA. It is
one of a three-part exhibi
tion, "Fabrications," that
has concurrent exhibits at
the Wexner Center for
the Arts in Columbus,
and NYMOMA.
"Bodybuildings" is de
signed to bring architecture to
the forefront. It successfully
fuses the materiality of build
ings with the actions and ex
periences of human beings.
The models in
"Fabrications" are not repro
ductions of pre-existing
buildings. They are not like
anything you've seen or even
dreamed of. Instead, these gi
ant, three-dimensional struc
tures border between man's
creation and man's worst
nightmare.
"Bodybuildings" is par- 1
tially inspired by Antonio
Botta, the architect who de
signed the SFMOMA. A San
Francisco-based team of con

temporary architects — in
cluding Hodgett's and Fund
Design Associates and Rob
Wellington Quigley — took
structural aspects of Botta's
design as the basis for the
works on display. Thus,
"Bodybuildings" is a metaphor
for the museum itself.
The exhibit, on the fifth
floor of the museum, is coordi
nated into one spatial room
with a ceiling you forget exists
and walls that have been taken
over by the "Bodybuildings"
display. The smell of newly fin

iteration is the making of our physical environment'

ished paint is subtle but intoxi
cating, and sunshine from a gi
ant skylight greets you and the
other viewers. The room has an

echo that makes it feel alive.
The first thing I noticed was
the chanting of noises that
filled the space. They came
from creaking wood structures
and people laughing out of a
combination of embarrass
ment and excitement.
A little girl tugged on her
mother's arm, saying, "You're
not supposed to touch that,
Mommy!"
"Yes you are, sweetie,"
replied the woman, pressing
her entire body weight onto the
serrated mouthpiece of "The
Body in Motion." The wind

that escaped from the open
ing blew back the pair's
brown hair. "See, we make it
breathe."
I had to try it."The Body
in Motion," which seeks to
I explore the internal air cur
| rents that regulate the con-
I trolled environment of the
| gallery, looks more like the
I monster you envision in your
closet than an air condi
tioner. But that's the point. It
is the combination of the hu
man lung and the building's
respiratory system. It is a
complicated, animated air
conditioning system that
challenges convention.
Along the west wall is
"Somatic," a giant white fab
rication that resembles an un
finished igloo. The ordinary
building system has been re
arranged, blurring the tradi-

tional boundaries between the
skin, the structure and the arti
facts that these constructions
usually contain. The raw build
ing materials line the wall and
exploit the process of construc
tion. You aren't sure whether to
stare or ignore the whole pre
sentation. Is it finished? Is it
art? Is it architecture?
"Somatic" stretches across
the entire wall before finally
jutting out with a life-sized
passageway. I watched as a man
approached the opening and
cautiously leaned his head into
the space. The uneven drywaU,

the giant shingles - all of it
takes on a tactile, impressive
presence.
"Repose," a whole wall
shrouded in layers of asym
metrical charcoal felt, explores
the dichotomy between re
straint and relaxation. While
part of it shoots out and up, the
horizontal layers have been
folded into passive, soft and
inviting lines. After an exhaust
ing journey through the rest of
the museum, this invites a pri
vate moment of reflection.
Against the back wall
stretches my favorite piece, en
titled "Equipoise." This design
which combines a drawbridge
and a seesaw. It requires the
viewer to test out its function
by walking onto it. Once you
get over the initial intimidation
of walking out onto an actual
art piece, you are taken over by

sensation. With one more step,
your weight forces the ramp to
shift, and the vertical surfaces
move into an erect position.
The noise seems unbearable at
first, but after a while it just be
comes part of the exhibit, part
of the experience.
As 1 was leaving the mu
seum, I could still smell the
fresh paint; I think it had
rubbed off on my clothes.
"Bodybuildings" turned out to
be highly creative and engaging
- a real hands-on experience.
The theory of buildings and
bodies working in unison
seemed to be farthest from any
type of "fabrication."
We live in a modern place
where we all too often take the
power and beauty of the sur
rounding buildings for granted.
This exhibit challenges the idea
that man's creations are con
crete structures lacking any
complex qualities. It empha
sizes the organic nature of the
city and the way in which man
and form work together to pro
duce the energy of our contem
porary environment.
