# Verdict on 'The Street Lawyer:'
## Grisham's latest isn't quite Grisham's greatest 
### Katie Young Contributing writer 
After having slaved
away at Washington D.C.'s
most prestigious law firm
for half his adult life, an
titrust lawyer Michael
Brock is on a fast track to
the good life. Three years
away from becoming a
partner at Drake & Sweeney
— which would mean less
working hours and an an
nual salary close to a mil
lion dollars — it seems as if
nothing could go wrong for
Brock. That is, until the day
he takes the wrong eleva
tor.
Ascending to his
cushy sixth-floor office,
Brock notices an unkempt
stranger eyeing him. The
man follows Brock off of
the elevator, pulls out a gun
and announces his plan to
take the floor hostage.

Demanding to be called "Mister," the man keeps
police at bay for several hours, during which
Brock's life flashes repeatedly before his eyes.
Mister proceeds to grill his hostages about their
income, taxes and donations to charity. They an
swer trembling, and Mister is aghast to learn that
none of them have given even a dollar to the
homeless over the past year. As the sixth-floor sit
uation becomes increasingly tense, Brock tries to
convince Mister to set down the gun. lust then, a
police sniper fires through a nearby window,
killing Mister and spattering blood and brain
fluid all over the terrified Brock.
Over the next few days, Brock's recollection
of the hostage situation and Mister's death causes
him to re-evaluate his own life. Where he once saw
a booming career and a promising future, he now
finds a mundane job and a crumbling marriage.
Taking some time off from work, Brock begins to
pry seriously into Mister's motives. He soon real
izes that his law firm was not merely a random tar
get and that Mister was more of a victim than an
aggressor. Launching a full-fledged investigation,
he leaves the plush corridors of Drake & Sweeney
permanently and accepts a low-paying position as
an attorney for the homeless.
Meanwhile, Brock's wife Claire, a doctor, is
less than thrilled with his new way of life. Neither

of them are willing to try to glue together the re
maining pieces of their marriage, so they agree on
a divorce. Three days later, Brock is lonely, broke
and trying to dodge Drake & Sweeney, who dis
cover that Brock has "borrowed" a file from them
in order to prove their wrongdoing against
Mister. Meanwhile, his new job brings him face
to-face with clients whose predicaments he never
could have fathomed a month earlier. It's all in the
life of a street lawyer.
"The Street Lawyer," ($27.95, Doubleday)
John Grisham's latest tome, is solid, interesting
and well-written. But although it makes for good
bedtime reading, it differs little from most of
Grisham's other books. The big law firm is the
bad guy and the main character is the underdog
fighting against the bad guy. The underdog has
access to information a lot of people are trying to
get their hands on and is in a great deal of danger.
For those who aren't regular Grisham readers,
this is also the plot of "The Pelican Brief," "The
Client," "The Firm" and"The Rainmaker."
To Grisham's credit, however, his writing
seems to be getting better and better. Far from the
haphazardly-constructed characters sprinkled

throughout his first nov
els, those in"The Street
Lawyer" are well-devel
oped. Especially note
worthy are Mordecai
Green, the outspoken
poverty attorney who
Brock looks to for help
and advice in his new
profession, and Claire,
whom Grisham paints in
neither a particularly
positive nor negative
light. Even Grisham's mi
nor characters are life
like enough to keep read
ers intrigued. Ironically,
Brock seems to be the
only character on whom
Grisham spends an inad
equate amount of time,
failing to thoroughly ex
plain Brock's initial justi
fication for leaving Drake
& Sweeney to investigate
Mister.
Overall, Grisham's
latest is not a must-read.

Most readers — especially those who found
themselves impatient with Grisham's second
most recent novel, "The Partner" — would be
well-advised to wait for a used paperback. But for
die-hard Grisham fans with a few hours to spare,
"The Street Lawyer" is worth picking up.
