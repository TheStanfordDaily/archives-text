# Buzz Light-year's double axle?
## Intermission goes to this year's Ice Capades 
### Elizabeth Khuri-Yakub 
I was in San Jose Arena,
just a few feet from the
ice. A strange mist frothed
over the freshly Zambonied
ice. One would normally pre
pare for the blood, gore and
certain foaming at the mouth
common at San lose Sharks
games. You would expect to
hear the roar of the crowd,
first distant than gradually
swelling in volume, chanting,
"Mayhem, mayhem!"
Imagine my distress
when the crowd's pitch esca
lated by an octave, and I
discovered thousands of
pre-preteens screaming,
"Yippee-hurrah-do da yay! w I
looked around, but there
weren't burly men clamoring
for a view of the goal post.
Instead, 1 saw thousands of
kids waving luminous, glow
ing green "He-Man, Master of
the Universe" daggers. The
two spectators past puberty
and below age 35 — anyone
older was a parent — were my
friend and me. The curtains
parted, and we entered a zone
of fuzzy pink things.
I was at "Disney on Ice
— Toy Story," a pasture
ground for former competitive
skaters. The Ice Capades pre
sent figures and themes from

popular movies and cartoons
on ice. This provides a forum
for free expression as well as a
job for all those almost-but
not-quite-Tara Lipiniskis.
For those of you who
are not familiar with the plot
of "Toy Story," it goes like this:
Andy, the main character, has
a favorite toy named Woody.
On his birthday, Andy receives
a new toy, Buzz Lightyear
(magnificently cloaked in
what appears to be a Speedo
and white tights). Woody's
high position is threatened,
and he devises all sorts of ven
omous plots to do away with
him. One thing leads to an
other, allowing for numerous
adventures with objects such
as a claw, toys minus heads
and green army men.
The primary villain is a
bully next door who blows up
toys. Of all the props in the
show, my favorite was the
bully's tablecloth with "Mega
Dork" written all over it.
The story has a nice tidy
ending followed by the coda
"You've Got a Friend in Me."
This morphs into a little
dance show routine complete
with the green army men fill
ing in for the Rockettes.
Sarcasm lost, I actually
had a pretty good time. I
haven't laughed that much in
a while. The atmosphere is
starkly different from
Stanford during El Nifio —
think Disneyland on July 4. It
was a great way to spend a
Wednesday night — an
evening with Rocky Gibraltar,
Mr. Potatohead, Slinky Dog
and Bo Peep. The costumes
were quite elaborate and
Woody was rakishly hand
some. It is hard to not enjoy
oneself when you are sur
rounded by thousands of
ridiculously happy 8-year
olds yelling, "Oh no, Woody
don't do that!" and "Mommy,
I want, 1 want."
The skating was gener
ally well-done. Even when
they crashed, there was no
need tor snobby remarks. It is
really not important whether
or not Slinky Dog lands his
triple axle. On the other
hand, Andy was particularly
inspiring with his joyous exu
berance and his free and easy
movements punctuated by
athletic jumps.
If you want to have an
original day and get away
from the Stanford scene, you
can't go wTong with the Ice
Capades. Even if you don't
like ice skating, children,
furry animals, interesting
popcorn vendors or syrupy
sweet endings, go. The air at
the San lose Arena could be
mistaken for nitrous oxide.
