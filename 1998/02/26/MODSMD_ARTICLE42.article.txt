# Review and Interview
## Dark City science-fiction meets the detective story 
### 
Intermission apologizes for pretending that
the reader of this review is a thirty-something
British male sex symbol.
It's a very bleak night when you (Rufus Sewell)
wake up in your bathtub. The viciously tattooed
body of a prostitute lies sprawled in the next
room, dead.
She's Dark City's latest victim. Your latest vic
tim?
"It ain't me, babe," you might be thinking. Tell
that to the cops who are beating down the door.
"It ain't me you're looking for." But you give them
the slip and soon you're out on the mean streets of
... New York? Chicago? Gotham City? Whatever
the answer, the city is dark and grimy, in a yellow
ish-green sort of way. Besides, why should you
worry about where you are? You can't even re
member who you are.
Pretty soon, Inspector Bumstead (looking
splendidly like William Hurt) is on your case. He's
a hardhearted kind of guy who won't take "I've
lost my memory!" as an alibi. He also knows his
trench from his coat.

Unfortunately, your main ally seems to be a mad
professor (hilariously impersonating Kiefer
Sutherland). His chief method of reassurance is to
point a syringe at you and tell you, "It's all going to be
all right!" in a deeply unprofessional accent.
Sounds like you're in trouble, then? Wrong. Soon
enough the shiny-headed bald aliens come for you.
Now you're in trouble.
At this point we must leave you to ponder your
own sanity. It's time to return to our own reality, and
to question /'What on earth is this film about?"
In many ways, "Dark City" is about a look
smoky nightclubs with husky-voiced chanteuses (gor
geously resembling Jennifer Connelly), urban Barons
von Frankenstein and choirs of chattering eggshell
aliens lurking in the infrastructure and doing their
best Richard O'Brien impressions. What more could
one want?
Lurking behind these exotic mysteries, there's a
pretty decent story with a few good surprises. For a
movie with so many expensive special effects, that's a
little unusual.
As flesh to these bones, "Dark City" can boast a cast
full of intriguing possibilities.
A recipe for success? I'm not so sure. The character s
don't really mesh — each one seems to have a separate
orbit. More crucially, too much of the important dia
logue sounds raw, or even obvious.
For all that, it's an interesting movie. It may not be
" The Terminator" or "Blade Runner," but if you like
the previews, you should check it out.
