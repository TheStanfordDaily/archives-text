# Director Alex Proyas
## 
### Vin de Silva Contributing writer 
Australian filmmaker Alex Proyas has
had a diverse career as a director. In
1994, he directed the cult classic "The
Crow." His latest film is "Dark City."
Intermission spoke to him about his
life and ambitions.
Intermisson: You entered film
school at the age of 17. Was it always
your ambition to be a director?
Alex Proyas: I always wanted to make
movies. 1 think I got my first Super-8
camera when I was 10 years old.
I: And after film school you moved
into directing music videos?
AP: I set up a company with a couple
of other film school graduates. We
had a lot of friends who were in
bands, and we figured that we could
actually earn a living through all this.
We weren't exactiy right. Eventually it
did allow me come to Los Angeles
and find an agent and make headway
into the film business.
I: Then you worked in advertising
for a while.
AP: I still make the odd commercial.
I'm very privileged in that respect,
because I don't have to jump into a
movie just to earn a living. I can go
slow and steady with the movies and

make sure that each one actually
means something to me.
I: Are there similarities between mu
sic videos and advertising?
AP: They have a certain similarity in
terms of how punchy the images
have to be, and how they have to
grab you instantly. I haven't made a
music video for many many years
because I got a little bored with the
format. Commercials I still enjoy,
because they are more like little
movies. They have actors and dia
logue, and all that stuff you get to do
on the real thing. Also, I do a lot of
comedy in the commercials, and I
enjoy that style. I guess it's hard to
tell that from my movies.

I: "The Crow" was based
on a comic book. Do you
think there is potential for
many more films of that
genre?
AP: I'm personally a little
tired of comic books being
translated into films. After
"The Crow" came out, I
was offered anything that
had a guy in weird make
up, a long black coat or a
strange costume. A lot of
them are really variations
on the same theme. There's
probably a lot of comics
out there which are differ
ent and would be interest
ing to translate into
movies, but I'd like to
move on to something else.
I: Can you tell us about
the genesis of "Dark City?"

AP: I started working on it in about
1990, so it's been with me for quite a
while. "The Crow" came along in
midstream. When I first started it, it
was a story about a detective [the
William Hurt character] who is a
man of great logic, working on a case
that is anything but logical. Things
just do not add up. He starts becom
ing a little crazed as a result. Later
the plot started shifting to the Rufus
Sewell character. The whole look
evolved over a long period. I always
wanted to make a hard-boiled detec
tive movie. I wanted to make a film
about guys in trench coats and hats.
I: Was it inspired by the 1940s
Humphrey Bogart films?

AP: Exactly. I wanted to contrast that
with the science-fiction genre, which
is such a different kind of thing. I
thought that that conflict would ere
ate something interesting visually.
I: Was it your idea to have a race of
aliens (the Strangers) who all look
like Richard O'Brien?
AP: 1 actually dreamt these guys up.
1 had these recurring nightmares as a
kid that starred the Strangers.
Richard was very excited about it,
because it was basically a serious
role. He always tends to do wacky
characters. It was then a matter of
casting other actors who were com
patible with his style. 1 would have
long talks about why they should act
in certain ways, but at the end of the
day I'd go, "lust be like Richard!"
I: 1 understand that you're making a
new version of "Quatermass and the
Pit." The original BBC television se
ries was shot in the 1950s on a tiny
budget in tiny studios. Would you
have enjoyed the challenge of work
ing under those circumstances?
AP: My first feature cost $100,000 to
make, so I feel that I've had that ex
perience without working 50 years
ago. [Now] my ideas tend to revolve
around visuals that are expensive or
technically complex to achieve.
When you don't have a budget, you
come up with other ways of doing
things. I think that has a certain
quaintness and appeal for an audi
ence. However, when you do a big
movie these days, the audience ex
pects a certain level of technology,
and I'm having to deliver that as
much as anyone.
