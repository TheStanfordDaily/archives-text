# Twilight
## a
						crowd pleaser, but not the right crowd 
### 
"Twilight," a new film by Academy-Award
winning director Robert Benton, deals with an
interesting topic. While the film is being pro

moted as a dramatic story about corruption and
scandal in Hollywood, the movie is really about
three people who must overcome problems asso
ciated with growing older.
If the entire movie was more like its prologue,
it would have been a definite crowd-pleaser for
college audiences. The sexy, comical prologue

takes place in Mexico.
There, a teenager named
Mel Ames (Reese
Witherspoon), daughter
of Hollywood actors Jack
and Catherine Ames
(Gene Hackman and
Susan Sarandon), has
eloped with her older
boyfriend (Liev
Schreiber) to enjoy the
pleasures of life. When
private investigator
Harry Ross (Paul
Newman) finds her and
tries to return her to her
parents, he accidentally
gets shot in the leg by
Mel.
After that, the movie
shifts to the present.
Harry has retired and is
in the permanent service
of Jack and Catherine.

When he agrees to deliver a mysterious package
for lack, he discovers what appears to be the mur
der of an innocent man. An ex-cop, Harry hasn't

lost his desire to investigate, and he thinks the
killing might be connected to his employer. His
only clue is the fact that Catherine's ex-husband
disappeared under suspicious circumstances
right before she married Jack. From that point,
the movie slowly progresses to uncover some
muddled clues. By the end, the obvious has been
exposed.
The members of the cast fit their roles per
fectly. Sarandon, Hackman and Newman are all
aging actors adept at portraying their characters'
struggles. Only Newman seems to have fun with
his role as a divorced, ex-alcoholic and former
private investigator. Newman charmingly por
trays his character's revival after having been
thrown in the middle of a murder mystery. The
humor he inserts into his character is the best
part of the film. Sarandon and Hackman are
fairly uninspired, but then again, their characters
basically do nothing more interesting than vege
tate.
"Twilight" may sound appealing from the way
it is being marketed, but it is not the type of film
many young people will enjoy. Unlike most of to
day's movies, "Twilight" progresses very slowly,
without any very memorable scenes. The dia
logue is contemplative and filled with long mo
ments of silence while Catherine is playing the pi
ano for Harry.
While this film likely has value for older peo
ple, I am not in a position to appreciate that fact.
As a writer for a college newspaper, I can't recom
mend this film.
