# Director Robert Benton

### Frederick Vallaeys Contributing writer 
Five-time Academy Award
nominee Robert Benton is
probably best known for his
Oscar-winning direction of
"Kramer vs. Kramer" and his
work on films like "Nobody's
Fool," "Superman," "Bonnie and
Clyde" and "Places in the Heart."
Intermission met with the 65-
year-old Benton to talk about his
new film, "Twilight."
Intermission: Mr. Benton, how
do you feel audiences will re
spond to the fairly slow pace of
your new film?
Robert Benton: That's the same
question that I've been wonder
ing about all day, so let me re
spond to that with a question. Do

you feel that this film will have any resonance with a college crowd?
I: Honestly, I feel that most college people are so used to fast-paced films that
they will not really be able to appreciate this film.
RB: Thanks for being so honest. This film is about affection and growing
older, and it is really not so much about the mystery. 1 wouldn't have made
this type of film when 1 was 20 or 30 years old, but now it reflects all the

things that I have learned. Stylistically, this film
is a lot like the films of the '40s and '50s.
I: So what response are you getting from older
critics?
RB: They don't seem to feel this was a slow film
because it tries to answer some of the questions
that they themselves may have. The film tries to
figure out how relationships change as we grow
older. For instance, when Jack Ames (Gene
Hackman) finds out that Harry (Paul Newman)
has slept with his wife Catherine (Susan
Sarandon), Jack is furious at Harry. However,
underneath all that anger there is still a deep af
fection between the two men. In the film,
Harry's an ex-cop, ex-father and ex-drunk who
is working for a dying actor and his devoted
wife. While Harry's prior failures are not ex
plained in the film, we do see him start at the
bottom and come back to life again.
I: So the marketing department is just trying to
sell this film to a younger audience by making
it sound like the film is about sex and scandal
in Hollywood?
RB: Well, it wouldn't be the first time a film has
been misrepresented in order to make a big de
but at the box office. As a director, I have to de
cide for myself if 1 want to be a big money
maker or the maker of interesting films. Most

films made today will be shown all over the world, making it almost a ne
cessity to dumb down the dialogue and put in a lot of action in order to
make the film appeal to people in as many nations as possible. That is not
my own goal, however. 1 try to make films that answer questions that people
may have. Once I'm done with a film, I will try to find closure by doing in
terviews and talking about my work. But after that I'll never watch the film
again. I never saw "Kramer vs. Kramer" again after it was all done.
