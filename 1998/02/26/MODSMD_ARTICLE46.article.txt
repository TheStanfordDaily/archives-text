## What does the word 'nerd' mean aft a place like Stanford? 
### Robin Moroney Staff writer 
"Have you ever answered a
rhetorical question?"
"Nerd" is a useless word. It
describes nothing and nobody.
It's a word that is more useful
than meaningful. We've all
laughed at "The Far Side" regu
lar with glasses, buck teeth and
a pocket protector. But we've
also all said, "What do you
mean I'm a nerd? Knowing
every line to 'Star Wars' isn't
nerdy. Knowing all the lines to
'Star Trek, however, now that's
different."
At Stanford the term "nerd"
is even more directionless. If
you don't wear glasses at
Stanford that doesn't mean
you're not a nerd. It just means
you're a nerd who doesn't wear
glasses.

"Is your weight less than
your IQ?"
Certainly the term "nerd"
cannot be taken out of context.
It only has meaning when
lifestyles are judged as well as
lived. Excessive time devoted to
one activity is not enough to be
nerdy, it's doing too much of the
wrong thing that counts.
If you spend all hours of the
day on the Playstation you're a
"Nintendo freak," but if you
drink every day you're not
known as "a beer dork."
Moreover, you rarely hear of
"sex geeks."
Sam Edwards, a counselor at
the Shyness Clinic, says that the
nerd "is an adopted or an as
signed identity that supposedly
embodies a combination of
characteristics. Among the
characteristics are superior in
telligence, shyness, social awk
wardness, a higher level of com

fort with objects such as com
puters and problem sets than
with people, and strong tenden
cies to spend hours working on
projects or on school work to
the exclusion of socializing with
peers.
"In short, 'a nerd' is a cul
turally specific stereotype based
on having an abundance of
those types of attributes."
"Have you ever pro
grammed a computer for fun?"

If you spend all hours of the
day on the Playstation you're

drink every day you're not
known as "a beer dork."

Computers have taken over
the world, bringing nerds with
them. The fabric of the '90s was

written in computer code by
nerds in the '80s. Bill Gates and
the brains behind the World
Wide Web and the rest of the
Internet are all nerdy and now
all-powerful. "The nerd has
really changed with the times
and is ready to embrace the next
millennium," said Justin
Corvino, a mathematics mas
ter's student and recent MIT
graduate. As the French maga
zine "L'Express" put it recently,
"Le Geek; C'est Chic!"
Reading about nerds on the
Internet is like reading a for
eign classic in the original lan
guage. Search for the word
"nerd," and you'll find some of
the most elaborate, amusing
and baffling sites the Web has
to offer.
One site, "Riot Nrrrd," defi
antly states the status of the
nerd today: "In the old days,
when our predecessors were
overthrowing your puny com

munications industry, you
could have called us [ useless |.
Now we control more than just
your computers; we control the
Net! We control the world! Now
we are the law! Now we will cap
ture the Neanderthal frat-boy
jock-heads, we will mess up
their travel agents' computers so
that they SHIP THEM ALL TO
CAMBODIA"
At Stanford, computer sci
ence is one of the most popular
majors. "Techie" subjects seem
ever more popular and ever
more prestigious. Unlike most
campuses the nerd lifestyle isn't
marginalized — it's the norm.
Edwards identifies perfec
tionism as a possible nerd trait,
one that is emphasized in
Stanford's harshly competitive
environment. "Socializing with
peers often makes them feel
very anxious, restless and exces
sively worried that (s)he my be
missing some vital detail that


graphic by Gautam Deshpande
could guarantee success,"
Edwards said.
"The student is typically
risk- averse, and his/her spend
ing time away from the studies
is generally seen as taking a
chance that may lead to failing
academically."
At the same time, Stanford is
not an institution that rewards
sociability: "In some ways, the
nerd persona in the learning in
stitution represents a facet of
the ideal or model student, one
whose priority is learning and
excelling in the intellectual area.
The student is rewarded by the
academic culture for his or her
achievements; the student is not
penalized by the academic cul
ture for having 'poor social
skills' or for having few if any
close friends, or for being shy." If
you were a nerd in high school,
Stanford has no interest in
changing that fact.
"Back in high school I was
the biggest nerd, the king nerd,"
said junior Kevin Greenman.
"But here I'm just another nerd
with plaid pants and a graphing
calculator. It's hard to get used
to when you're surrounded by
all those incredible nerds. There
are three All-American nerds in
my advanced freshman physics
class. How am I supposed to
compete with that?"
Nobody went to Stanford
for the wild parties on Tuesday
nights. If being a nerd means
being proficient academically,
then pointing to a nerd on the
Stanford campus is as easy as
sitting on the floor.
"Have you ever asked a
question in lecture? Ever an
swered one?"
Nerds have always had jocks
to beat them up. The '80s movie
"Revenge of the Nerds" pretty
much made this experience a
defining part of being a "nerd."
The nerds in that movie were
incredibly heterogeneous. The
only thing they had in common
was being non-athletic and be
ing excluded from the Greek
system.
There might be jocks at
Stanford, but they're too busy
training to make fun of nerds.
And if they did nobody would
pay much attention.
At Stanford, Greek letters
aren't the Midas touch they
were in "Revenge of the Nerds."
Fraternity parties are essentially
a chance for freshmen to get
their hands on cat's-piss beer.
Upperclassmen have learned
their lessons and go elsewhere.
Only sorority girls care who gets
into a sorority; everybody else
listens in bemused horror to the
stories of sorority pledges hav
ing the excess fat of their bodies
circled as they stand naked in
front of their sisters. It's not dif

ficult to be a nerd and a Greek
on this campus.
"I think most fraternity guys
at Stanford compartementalize
their lives," says junior Theta
Delt, Dave Travers. "They study
a ton just like your average nerd,
and then they go out on Friday
night thinking they are cool and
do keg stands and womanize
just like a good University of
Texas frat boy. I remember a
Taxi who was rushing me say
ing, 'Taxi is cool man, we smoke
out, like, every night and still ,
get pretty good grades."
At Stanford Greek letters
aren't enough to absolve you
of the charge of being a nerd.
"Do you not use a condom
because you can't work out
how to fit it over the testicles?"
Indeed, if you want to look
at the Midas touch that trans
forms high school nerds on this
campus, look no further than
the Stanford Band. It's difficult
to know what would happen if
you took a cross-section of
nerds from high school, stuffed
them full of liquor and told
them they could do whatever
they wanted. However, the Band
is a pretty good guess.
"I'd say not everybody, but a
lot of the people in the Band
were nerds at high school," says
junior Mike Wilson. "The sug
gestions for half time shows are
always very nerdy. Last year
someone suggested doing a frac
tal. Everyone in the room was
laughing hard, but we all realized

that this wasn't the sort of joke
that normal people would get.
The people who were in bands in
high school are in a minority
here. Most of us are just enjoying
the social life. Whatever our
pasts, I don't think we're nerds
anymore. Sure, there are a lot of
physics and CS majors, but the
same is true of Stanford as a
whole." The playful anarchy of
the Band is far more entertaining
than 90 percent of the fraternity
pranks on campus.

At Stanford, Greek letters aren't
enough to absolve you of the
charge of being a nerd.

Whereas in "Revenge of the
Nerds" one is dealing with ab
solutes — you're either a nerd
or you're not — one deals with
shades of nerdiness at Stanford.
The usual definitions of "nerd"
do not apply in a world
where everyone knows the dif
ference between Aristotle and
Augustine, or where you can ac
tually sound cool when you say,
"Have you ever played chess
stoned?"
The jocks may not control
the definition, but we still have
our stereotypes. We might study
more than most, but at least
we're not that person at the
front of Chemistry 31 raising
his/her hand every five minutes
and asking what's going to be
on the midterm.

"Have you ever inhaled helium?"
A structured liberal educa
tion sounds painful and
Structured Liberal Education
sounds like a programming lan
guage. No one had any idea
what we were getting ourselves
into when we picked our Area 1
requirement. In fact, I'd say the
choice was pretty arbitrary for
many of us. Those who chose
SLE were either unlucky, lucky,
or deserved it.
SLE's structure alienates it
from the rest of campus.
Hating Area 1 requirements
was a source of unity for most
freshmen, but for SLE people
the source of unity comes from
defending the program's acad
emic requirements. Most people
who have gone through SLE
have nothing but good things to
say about it, but the same can be
said of the Moonies.
"SLE nerds people," says ju
nior Andrew Bradley, a SLE sur
vivor. "There are nerds every
where at Stanford. SLE doesn't
have any corner on the market.
But SLE actively nerds people.
Sophomore year was really just
one big de-nerding process."
Another contributor, according
to Bradley, is the SLE myth "that
SLEs possess such innate bril
liance that any other Stanford
freshman is merely a flashlight
to their blinding luminescence."
SLE people seem to be engaging
in social imperialistic hari-kari,
actively engaging in the oppor

tunity to not socialize with
those outside SLE.
All the same, it's hard to say
to what extent, and for what
reasons SLE is any less cool than
Branner. "I valued SLE because
it didn't pretend not to be
nerdy," said senior Beverly
Foulks. "There was no preten
sion of coolness claimed by sev
eral other freshman dormito
ries." The difference might be
that Branner alumni don't think
that "Branner Rocks!" anymore.
"Do you sit in the front two
thirds of the lecture hall?"
Graduate students are also
viewed with suspicion by un
dergraduates. For Halloween a
friend of mine wore a bike hel
met, a white shirt tucked into
jeans with a neat crease, one of
those winking lights in his top
pocket, and, of course, glasses.
Nobody had any trouble work
ing out who he was.
Much of "Filed Higher and
Deeper," The Stanford Daily
comic strip, is almost entirely
founded on jokes about the be
nign geekiness of graduate stu
dents. "Maybe grad students
are more disposed to working
on a Friday night instead of go
ing to a fraternity bash and do
ing keg spins.
"Part of this, as 1 will attest,
is that those who would be dis
posed to such activity have had
enough hangovers in their lives
(this is more growing up
Ithan nerdliness)," Corvino ex
plained. "Undergrads, when
making judgments, need to dis
tinguish between nerdly traits
and pseudo-grownup traits."
It's easy to forget that
graduate students study more
simply because they have more
to study. "There is often more
pressure to get work done (quals,
thesis). Those who are not nerds
at least recognize their behavior
as being nerdy, and wish it didn't
have to be this way."
All the same, not being a
graduate student is still an op
tion in this country, thanks to
democracy.
"Do you known to more
than six digits? More than 10?"
Locating nerds at Stanford is
like trying to find a needle in
a stack of more needles.
Everybody at Stanford has at
least a glimmer of nerd in them.
Stanford has a great social
scene, but it rarely exists at the
expense of academics.

"Have you ever answered a
rhetorical question?"
"Nerd" is a useless word. It

nights. If being a nerd means
being proficient academically,
then pointing to a nerd on the
Stanford campus is as easy as
sitting on the floor.
"Have you ever asked a
question in lecture? Ever an
swered one?"
Nerds have always had jocks
to beat them up. The '80s movie
"Revenge of the Nerds" pretty
much made this experience a
defining part of being a "nerd."
The nerds in that movie were
incredibly heterogeneous. The
only thing they had in common
was being non-athletic and be
ing excluded from the Greek
system.
There might be jocks at
Stanford, but they're too busy
training to make fun of nerds.
And if they did nobody would
pay much attention.
At Stanford, Greek letters
aren't the Midas touch they
were in "Revenge of the Nerds."
Fraternity parties are essentially
a chance for freshmen to get
their hands on cat's-piss beer.
Upperclassmen have learned
their lessons and go elsewhere.
Only sorority girls care who gets
into a sorority; everybody else
listens in bemused horror to the
stories of sorority pledges hav
ing the excess fat of their bodies
circled as they stand naked in
front of their sisters. It's not dif

ficult to be a nerd and a Greek
on this campus.
"I think most fraternity guys
at Stanford compartementalize
their lives," says junior Theta
Delt, Dave Travers. "They study
a ton just like your average nerd,
and then they go out on Friday
night thinking they are cool and
do keg stands and womanize
just like a good University of
Texas frat boy. I remember a
Taxi who was rushing me say
ing, 'Taxi is cool man, we smoke
out, like, every night and still ,
get pretty good grades."
At Stanford Greek letters
aren't enough to absolve you
of the charge of being a nerd.
"Do you not use a condom
because you can't work out
how to fit it over the testicles?"
Indeed, if you want to look
at the Midas touch that trans
forms high school nerds on this
campus, look no further than
the Stanford Band. It's difficult
to know what would happen if
you took a cross-section of
nerds from high school, stuffed
them full of liquor and told
them they could do whatever
they wanted. However, the Band
is a pretty good guess.
"I'd say not everybody, but a
lot of the people in the Band
were nerds at high school," says
junior Mike Wilson. "The sug
gestions for half time shows are
always very nerdy. Last year
someone suggested doing a frac
tal. Everyone in the room was
laughing hard, but we all realized

that this wasn't the sort of joke
that normal people would get.
The people who were in bands in
high school are in a minority
here. Most of us are just enjoying
the social life. Whatever our
pasts, I don't think we're nerds
anymore. Sure, there are a lot of
physics and CS majors, but the
same is true of Stanford as a
whole." The playful anarchy of
the Band is far more entertaining
than 90 percent of the fraternity
pranks on campus.

At Stanford, Greek letters aren't
enough to absolve you of the
charge of being a nerd.

Whereas in "Revenge of the
Nerds" one is dealing with ab
solutes — you're either a nerd
or you're not — one deals with
shades of nerdiness at Stanford.
The usual definitions of "nerd"
do not apply in a world
where everyone knows the dif
ference between Aristotle and
Augustine, or where you can ac
tually sound cool when you say,
"Have you ever played chess
stoned?"
The jocks may not control
the definition, but we still have
our stereotypes. We might study
more than most, but at least
we're not that person at the
front of Chemistry 31 raising
his/her hand every five minutes
and asking what's going to be
on the midterm.

"Have you ever inhaled helium?"
A structured liberal educa
tion sounds painful and
Structured Liberal Education
sounds like a programming lan
guage. No one had any idea
what we were getting ourselves
into when we picked our Area 1
requirement. In fact, I'd say the
choice was pretty arbitrary for
many of us. Those who chose
SLE were either unlucky, lucky,
or deserved it.
SLE's structure alienates it
from the rest of campus.
Hating Area 1 requirements
was a source of unity for most
freshmen, but for SLE people
the source of unity comes from
defending the program's acad
emic requirements. Most people
who have gone through SLE
have nothing but good things to
say about it, but the same can be
said of the Moonies.
"SLE nerds people," says ju
nior Andrew Bradley, a SLE sur
vivor. "There are nerds every
where at Stanford. SLE doesn't
have any corner on the market.
But SLE actively nerds people.
Sophomore year was really just
one big de-nerding process."
Another contributor, according
to Bradley, is the SLE myth "that
SLEs possess such innate bril
liance that any other Stanford
freshman is merely a flashlight
to their blinding luminescence."
SLE people seem to be engaging
in social imperialistic hari-kari,
actively engaging in the oppor

tunity to not socialize with
those outside SLE.
All the same, it's hard to say
to what extent, and for what
reasons SLE is any less cool than
Branner. "I valued SLE because
it didn't pretend not to be
nerdy," said senior Beverly
Foulks. "There was no preten
sion of coolness claimed by sev
eral other freshman dormito
ries." The difference might be
that Branner alumni don't think
that "Branner Rocks!" anymore.
"Do you sit in the front two
thirds of the lecture hall?"
Graduate students are also
viewed with suspicion by un
dergraduates. For Halloween a
friend of mine wore a bike hel
met, a white shirt tucked into
jeans with a neat crease, one of
those winking lights in his top
pocket, and, of course, glasses.
Nobody had any trouble work
ing out who he was.
Much of "Filed Higher and
Deeper," The Stanford Daily
comic strip, is almost entirely
founded on jokes about the be
nign geekiness of graduate stu
dents. "Maybe grad students
are more disposed to working
on a Friday night instead of go
ing to a fraternity bash and do
ing keg spins.
"Part of this, as 1 will attest,
is that those who would be dis
posed to such activity have had
enough hangovers in their lives
(this is more growing up
Ithan nerdliness)," Corvino ex
plained. "Undergrads, when
making judgments, need to dis
tinguish between nerdly traits
and pseudo-grownup traits."
It's easy to forget that
graduate students study more
simply because they have more
to study. "There is often more
pressure to get work done (quals,
thesis). Those who are not nerds
at least recognize their behavior
as being nerdy, and wish it didn't
have to be this way."
All the same, not being a
graduate student is still an op
tion in this country, thanks to
democracy.
"Do you known to more
than six digits? More than 10?"
Locating nerds at Stanford is
like trying to find a needle in
a stack of more needles.
Everybody at Stanford has at
least a glimmer of nerd in them.
Stanford has a great social
scene, but it rarely exists at the
expense of academics.

"Have you ever answered a
rhetorical question?"
"Nerd" is a useless word. It
describes nothing and nobody.
It's a word that is more useful
than meaningful. We've all
laughed at "The Far Side" regu
lar with glasses, buck teeth and
a pocket protector. But we've
also all said, "What do you
mean I'm a nerd? Knowing
every line to 'Star Wars' isn't
nerdy. Knowing all the lines to
'Star Trek, however, now that's
different."
At Stanford the term "nerd"
is even more directionless. If
you don't wear glasses at
Stanford that doesn't mean
you're not a nerd. It just means
you're a nerd who doesn't wear
glasses.

"Is your weight less than
your IQ?"
Certainly the term "nerd"
cannot be taken out of context.
It only has meaning when
lifestyles are judged as well as
lived. Excessive time devoted to
one activity is not enough to be
nerdy, it's doing too much of the
wrong thing that counts.
If you spend all hours of the
day on the Playstation you're a
"Nintendo freak," but if you
drink every day you're not
known as "a beer dork."
Moreover, you rarely hear of
"sex geeks."
Sam Edwards, a counselor at
the Shyness Clinic, says that the
nerd "is an adopted or an as
signed identity that supposedly
embodies a combination of
characteristics. Among the
characteristics are superior in
telligence, shyness, social awk
wardness, a higher level of com

fort with objects such as com
puters and problem sets than
with people, and strong tenden
cies to spend hours working on
projects or on school work to
the exclusion of socializing with
peers.
"In short, 'a nerd' is a cul
turally specific stereotype based
on having an abundance of
those types of attributes."
"Have you ever pro
grammed a computer for fun?"

If you spend all hours of the
day on the Playstation you're
a "Nintendo freak," but if you
drink every day you're not
known as "a beer dork."

Computers have taken over
the world, bringing nerds with
them. The fabric of the '90s was

written in computer code by
nerds in the '80s. Bill Gates and
the brains behind the World
Wide Web and the rest of the
Internet are all nerdy and now
all-powerful. "The nerd has
really changed with the times
and is ready to embrace the next
millennium," said Justin
Corvino, a mathematics mas
ter's student and recent MIT
graduate. As the French maga
zine "L'Express" put it recently,
"Le Geek; C'est Chic!"
Reading about nerds on the
Internet is like reading a for
eign classic in the original lan
guage. Search for the word
"nerd," and you'll find some of
the most elaborate, amusing
and baffling sites the Web has
to offer.
One site, "Riot Nrrrd," defi
antly states the status of the
nerd today: "In the old days,
when our predecessors were
overthrowing your puny com

munications industry, you
could have called us [ useless |.
Now we control more than just
your computers; we control the
Net! We control the world! Now
we are the law! Now we will cap
ture the Neanderthal frat-boy
jock-heads, we will mess up
their travel agents' computers so
that they SHIP THEM ALL TO
CAMBODIA"
At Stanford, computer sci
ence is one of the most popular
majors. "Techie" subjects seem
ever more popular and ever
more prestigious. Unlike most
campuses the nerd lifestyle isn't
marginalized — it's the norm.
Edwards identifies perfec
tionism as a possible nerd trait,
one that is emphasized in
Stanford's harshly competitive
environment. "Socializing with
peers often makes them feel
very anxious, restless and exces
sively worried that (s)he my be
missing some vital detail that


graphic by Gautam Deshpande
could guarantee success,"
Edwards said.
"The student is typically
risk- averse, and his/her spend
ing time away from the studies
is generally seen as taking a
chance that may lead to failing
academically."
At the same time, Stanford is
not an institution that rewards
sociability: "In some ways, the
nerd persona in the learning in
stitution represents a facet of
the ideal or model student, one
whose priority is learning and
excelling in the intellectual area.
The student is rewarded by the
academic culture for his or her
achievements; the student is not
penalized by the academic cul
ture for having 'poor social
skills' or for having few if any
close friends, or for being shy." If
you were a nerd in high school,
Stanford has no interest in
changing that fact.
"Back in high school I was
the biggest nerd, the king nerd,"
said junior Kevin Greenman.
"But here I'm just another nerd
with plaid pants and a graphing
calculator. It's hard to get used
to when you're surrounded by
all those incredible nerds. There
are three All-American nerds in
my advanced freshman physics
class. How am I supposed to
compete with that?"

those outside SLE.
All the same, it's hard to say
to what extent, and for what
reasons SLE is any less cool than
Branner. "I valued SLE because
it didn't pretend not to be
nerdy," said senior Beverly
Foulks. "There was no preten
sion of coolness claimed by sev
eral other freshman dormito
ries." The difference might be
that Branner alumni don't think
that "Branner Rocks!" anymore.
"Do you sit in the front two
thirds of the lecture hall?"
Graduate students are also
viewed with suspicion by un
dergraduates. For Halloween a
friend of mine wore a bike hel
met, a white shirt tucked into
jeans with a neat crease, one of
those winking lights in his top
pocket, and, of course, glasses.
Nobody had any trouble work
ing out who he was.
Much of "Filed Higher and
Deeper," The Stanford Daily
comic strip, is almost entirely
founded on jokes about the be
nign geekiness of graduate stu
dents. "Maybe grad students
are more disposed to working
on a Friday night instead of go
ing to a fraternity bash and do
ing keg spins.
"Part of this, as 1 will attest,
is that those who would be dis
posed to such activity have had
enough hangovers in their lives
(this is more growing up
Ithan nerdliness)," Corvino ex
plained. "Undergrads, when
making judgments, need to dis
tinguish between nerdly traits
and pseudo-grownup traits."
It's easy to forget that
graduate students study more
simply because they have more
to study. "There is often more
pressure to get work done (quals,
thesis). Those who are not nerds
at least recognize their behavior
as being nerdy, and wish it didn't
have to be this way."
All the same, not being a
graduate student is still an op
tion in this country, thanks to
democracy.
"Do you known to more
than six digits? More than 10?"
Locating nerds at Stanford is
like trying to find a needle in
a stack of more needles.
Everybody at Stanford has at
least a glimmer of nerd in them.
Stanford has a great social
scene, but it rarely exists at the
expense of academics.
