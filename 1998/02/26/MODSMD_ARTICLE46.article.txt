## What does the word 'nerd' mean aft a place like Stanford? 
### Robin Moroney Staff writer 
"Have you ever answered a
rhetorical question?"
"Nerd" is a useless word. It
describes nothing and nobody.
It's a word that is more useful
than meaningful. We've all
laughed at "The Far Side" regu
lar with glasses, buck teeth and
a pocket protector. But we've
also all said, "What do you
mean I'm a nerd? Knowing
every line to 'Star Wars' isn't
nerdy. Knowing all the lines to
'Star Trek, however, now that's
different."
At Stanford the term "nerd"
is even more directionless. If
you don't wear glasses at
Stanford that doesn't mean
you're not a nerd. It just means
you're a nerd who doesn't wear
glasses.

"Is your weight less than
your IQ?"
Certainly the term "nerd"
cannot be taken out of context.
It only has meaning when
lifestyles are judged as well as
lived. Excessive time devoted to
one activity is not enough to be
nerdy, it's doing too much of the
wrong thing that counts.
If you spend all hours of the
day on the Playstation you're a
"Nintendo freak," but if you
drink every day you're not
known as "a beer dork."
Moreover, you rarely hear of
"sex geeks."
Sam Edwards, a counselor at
the Shyness Clinic, says that the
nerd "is an adopted or an as
signed identity that supposedly
embodies a combination of
characteristics. Among the
characteristics are superior in
telligence, shyness, social awk
wardness, a higher level of com

fort with objects such as com
puters and problem sets than
with people, and strong tenden
cies to spend hours working on
projects or on school work to
the exclusion of socializing with
peers.
"In short, 'a nerd' is a cul
turally specific stereotype based
on having an abundance of
those types of attributes."
"Have you ever pro
grammed a computer for fun?"

If you spend all hours of the
day on the Playstation you're
a "Nintendo freak," but if you
drink every day you're not
known as "a beer dork."

Computers have taken over
the world, bringing nerds with
them. The fabric of the '90s was

written in computer code by
nerds in the '80s. Bill Gates and
the brains behind the World
Wide Web and the rest of the
Internet are all nerdy and now
all-powerful. "The nerd has
really changed with the times
and is ready to embrace the next
millennium," said Justin
Corvino, a mathematics mas
ter's student and recent MIT
graduate. As the French maga
zine "L'Express" put it recently,
"Le Geek; C'est Chic!"
Reading about nerds on the
Internet is like reading a for
eign classic in the original lan
guage. Search for the word
"nerd," and you'll find some of
the most elaborate, amusing
and baffling sites the Web has
to offer.
One site, "Riot Nrrrd," defi
antly states the status of the
nerd today: "In the old days,
when our predecessors were
overthrowing your puny com

munications industry, you
could have called us [ useless |.
Now we control more than just
your computers; we control the
Net! We control the world! Now
we are the law! Now we will cap
ture the Neanderthal frat-boy
jock-heads, we will mess up
their travel agents' computers so
that they SHIP THEM ALL TO
CAMBODIA"
At Stanford, computer sci
ence is one of the most popular
majors. "Techie" subjects seem
ever more popular and ever
more prestigious. Unlike most
campuses the nerd lifestyle isn't
marginalized â€” it's the norm.
Edwards identifies perfec
tionism as a possible nerd trait,
one that is emphasized in
Stanford's harshly competitive
environment. "Socializing with
peers often makes them feel
very anxious, restless and exces
sively worried that (s)he my be
