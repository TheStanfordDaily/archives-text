The Wedding Singer
Soundtrack purports to
be the "ultimate '80s com
pilation." To proclaim that a sin
gle 58- minute CD has captured
the best of an entire decade's
worth of music is a bold and
seemingly unrealistic statement.
However, out of all the '80s com
pilations in the marketplace that
I've heard, this album comes
closest to living up to this claim.
The soundtrack kicks off with
a re-recorded version of The
Buggies' "Video Killed the Radio
Star" tastefully executed by the
Presidents of The United States

of America. Holding true to the
group's alt-pop signature, this
electronic-less version of this '80s
hit is an upbeat and playful three
minutes mixed in with samples
from the original song.
What follows is a delightful
smorgasbord of original '80s
classics. From the enchanting
vocals of David Bowie's "China
Girl" to the soulful words of The
Police's "Every Little Thing She
Does Is Magic," to the
Thompson Twins' romantic bal
lad, "Hold Me Now," this compi
lation represents nearly the en
tire gamut of '80s top hits. The

album also packs a powerful
rock-pop punch with the unre
lenting electronic beats of New
Orders "Blue Monday" and the
euphonious roller coaster ride of
Billy Idol's "White Wedding."
"Somebody Kill Me," a new
song created for the movie and
performed by Adam Sandler, is
not only a spoof on the Cure's
depressing, gothic lyrics but a

worthless song. Sandler's inartic
ulate crooning, interspersed with
high-pitched shrills is pure poi
son to the ears. As for the lyrics,
they're not even close to being
funny.
Aside from the album's futile
attempts to create original music
for the movie, the album is a
solid collection of '80s hits.
Granted, many of the premier

'80s singers / groups such as
Madonna, Men At Work, Duran
Duran and Wham! have been left
out of the compilation.
Nevertheless, when compared to
other albums, "The Wedding
Singer" soundtrack comes very
close to satisfying your '80s mu
sic needs.
