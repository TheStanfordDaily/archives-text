# Tommy Castro
## Can't Keep A Good Man Down 
### 
Call me
old-fashioned,
but Tommy
Castro's take on the

blues is more like Gerber's mashed peas baby
food than the spicy wasabi peas they serve at
Zao's noodle house.
The local media has been celebrating
Tommy Castro like he's the next Albert King.
Which makes sense, since everyone likes to see
local talent do well.
The sad truth is, Castro can only cover
Albert King tunes. His version of King's "Can't
You See What You're Doing To Me" isn't even
one of the best tunes on Castro's new album.
From the get-go, solid shuffles and boogie
blues get watered down in Castro's blues /
R&B fusion. The album opens with the title
track, an utterly bland, driving blues whose
only redeeming feature is Randy McDonald's
thunderous bass line.
Tommy seems to think that technical vir
tuosity means repetitive one-note riffs. On top
of the bland R&B sounds of songs like "You
Knew The Job Was Dangerous," "You Gotta
Do What You Gotta Do," "I Want To Show
You" and "You Only Go Around Once,"
Castro's uninventive leads sink an already
badly leaking ship.

"Suitcase Full of Blues" echoes the smart
playing of Robben Ford who is just one gener
ation older than Castro. But Castro's boring
lyrics have none of Ford's intelligence.
The second half of the album is noticeably
better than the first. "My Time After Awhile" is
a slow, classic blues piece that Castro manages
not to mess up. It's rough on the edges, and his
soaring lead actually improves the tune.
Two other standout tunes are "Nobody
Loves Me Like My Baby," a fast boogie ripping
with Chuck Berry riffs, and "Hycodan," a
heavy, sexy instrumental blues.
Part of the problem lies in the band's lack
of a rhythm guitar. One of the best tracks on
the album, "High On The Hog," is a funky
groove in which Castro sticks to playing
rhythm guitar and takes a brief, interesting
solo.
This album is entirely too over-produced.
For some reason, Castro seems to be proud of
working with producer Jim Gaines, who also
produced "Sports," that flash-in-the-pan hit
for Huey Lewis and the News. To his credit,
Gaines has also worked with Otis Redding and
Stevie Ray Vaughan. So maybe it's Castro's
hand in the mix that makes it so wishy-washy.
It's tough to be a white man playing blues. Eric
Clapton figured it out. Tommy Castro has not.
