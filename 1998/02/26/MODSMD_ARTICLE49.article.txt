# Pure: Feverish
## 
### 
Trying to describe
this band is nearly im
possible. Maybe they're
like Blues Explosion, or
Pavement or Bush?
Feverish is so hard to
pinpoint mainly be-

cause each song sounds different from the next.
There are, however, some common
features. Pure has a talent for incorporating
interesting sound oddities with boring mu
sic. "New Wave Cowboy" and "My Surfboard
and my Dog" feature everything from
awestruck crowds to gongs to distorted child
voices. Too bad Pure decides to play its in
struments, too.
"Sunshine and Happy Hour" is a
catchy little romp, with just a touch of surf
guitar and lots of Pavement-esque touches.
"Pay Your Way" is a quiet song that blends

tropical birds and pretty guitar strumming so
well that the difference between the two is
blurry. The addition of a piano midway
through the song picks up the tempo and
adds an old-time saloon feel.
This same increase in tempo is bor
ing, boring, boring on "Four Cups of Joe,"
where quiet guitar strumming explodes into
loud noise. Pure's poor use of feedback is ter
ribly reminiscent of that nauseating band
Hush. But you've got to give Pure credit. Even
when it's sounding this bad, Pure never re
sorts to droning meaningless words over and
over (like, say "glycerine"). Rather, the quirk
iness of Pure leads it to sound more akin to a
drunken Bush, playing in a bar after it's taken
guitar lessons and knows more than three
chords.
