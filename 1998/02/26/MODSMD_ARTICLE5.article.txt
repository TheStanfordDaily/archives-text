# Four years of friendship
## Longtime roommates share time but leave space 
### Allison Hays Editorial staff 
In an age of high divorce rates and famil
ial dysfunction, few freshman roommates
voluntarily choose to stay together after
their initial assignment.
Some pairs, however, have opted to re
main roommates for up to all four years at
Stanford.
Although most attribute their decisions
to remain loyal to each other to sharing sim
ilar habits or leisure activities, some feel
that the extensive time not spent together is
key for a solid relationship.
Seniors Dana Silverstein and Michelle
Collins have lived together as freshmen in
Kimball Hall, co-roomed in Mirrielecs lor
two years and currently live together off
campus.
"We each have our own separate activi
ties — Michelle is a swimmer, anil I'm a

businesswoman," Silverstein said.
"We actually don't spend a lot of time to
gether and therefore never get sick of each
other."
According to Silverstein, they both have
meticulous cleaning habits and enjoy the
same leisure activities.
Both also have had concurrent relation
ships with men and have no difficulties
sharing their space.
"We have never had any major conflicts
We're essentially nonconfrontational peo
ple." Silverstein s;nd.
Seniors Erin kasso\ and Emily Andrus
have also met with wild success as room
mates.
The two were freshman roommates in
I bvon, roomed together for two more years
in dorms and now live next di>or to each
other in Castarto.
According to Kassoy, the two
have virtually nothing in common
and have separate activities and
friends.
They also differ in their level of
neatness although they both want
to he tidy people in theory.

As freshmen, they lived with a
third roommate, Kamron Hack.
"We always marveled at how
well we were placed together,"
Kassoy said. "The three of us sup
ported each other so much our
freshman year.
"We didn't do any of the same
activities, and we never would have
met. had we not been roommates."
Both pairs of roommates are

confident they will remain in touch
after graduation.
Kassoy commented, "Emily and
I are going in completely different
career directions, but we'll stay in
touch forever. I'm sure we'll be at
each other's weddings."
Silverstein and Collins will both
live and work in San Francisco next
year and also try to keep in close
contact.
