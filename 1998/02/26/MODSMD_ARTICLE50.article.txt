# The
						Donnas
## 
### 
The musical universe of The
Donnas is made up of two
monoliths: "that which they
want" and "that which they
don't want." Along with
making lower primates irri
table, these sets of lyrics ex
ude their eerie powers over
The Donnas throughout
"American Teenage Rock
'N' Roll Machine."
After one listen, you will
understand that the band
does not care about going
to school, having friends,
eating vegetables, books,
what you wanna do or you.
They care for rock 'n' roll,
radios and all the usual
cheap thrills associated
with intoxication and has
sle-free sexual relations.
The band also possesses
a predilection for three
chord blitzkriegs and "Hey-

Ho-Let s-Go" vocal stylings.
Welcome to punk rock
mystery No. 33. Ready to
skip to the end for Sherlock
Holmes' conclusion? The
Donnas are pretty much
The Ramones.
Yes, they are women,
and they are so much more
attractive than the impossi
ble Ramone brothers. They
hail from our own rice
filled burrito Palo Alto in
stead of gray bum-dung
New York. They are still
pretty much The Ramones,
though, right down to the
sharing of the same name
(all four are named Donna).
Being a lot like The
Ramones is a lot different
from being a lot like some
other band. The Ramones
are the expression of a rock
'n' roll archetype. There
have always been Ramones.
In prehistoric times, cave
men Ramones joyrode

mastodons and banged out
rock 'n' roll concerns on
rocks and bones. In the fu
ture, the 65X-T65 line of
Ramones will express the
human side of their cyborg
psyches with the aid of a
Fibrulaxor 65XT8. It's all the
same... 12 3 4.
That said, let us assess
The Donnas' contribution.
The meanest songs here are
"Rock V Roll Machine"
and "Checkin' It Out." The
rest are decent Ramone
penances-nothing mind
blowing unless you are a fe
male, bratty vocals fetishist.
It's tough being rock
hard delinquents when you
are Paly High graduates,
but those Donnas surely do
try. Like all teenagers, they
can only get meaner and
better with the suffering
that inevitably comes with
getting older. Rock 'n' roll!
