## You Can't Stop Florida Rain... 'Palmetto' twists itself to death 
### 
It is hard to pull off a concept like
the one presented in "Palmetto." I
remember being enraptured by
"The Usual Suspects," where the plot
had to be carefully analyzed and ob
served in order to maximize the en
joyment of the wild ending. I also re
call the suspenseless thrillers
"Sphere" and "Primal Fear," both
which tried to surprise the audience
with plot twists and instead managed
to deflate all tension or interest.
Although "Palmetto" has a good idea
and some solid actors, the Film never
manages to rise above the various
plot devices seemingly thrown in by
director Volker Schlondorff.
A charmingly aloof Woody
Harrelson headlines the film as Harry
Barber, a hard-luck loser who can't
seem to escape the misfortunes of
Palmetto, Fla. He never learns from
his mistakes because he makes the
same ones over and over again.
Harry has been given an uncondi
tional release from his prison cell,
which is plagued by palmetto bugs
and unmitigated filth. We really don't
have a clear explanation for his re
lease. The reason is later revealed as
one of the "plot twists."
We see him try to walk away from
his troubles, but — sure enough, in
the name of plot convention — he re
turns to the arms of his loyal girl
friend, Nina (Gina Gershon,
"Bound"). Nina and Harry have a re
liable trust between them, and despite
the disapproval of Nina's sister, they
could have had a happy life together.
No more than 20 minutes into the
film, Harry meets Rhea (Elisabeth
Shue), a mischievous woman looking
for someone to do her dirty work.

Now the average person would be a
bit disturbed by a luscious, wealthy
woman walking around the depressed
streets of Palmetto, but not Harry. He
has been looking for a job, and when
she waves 50 grand and some breasts
in front of his nose, he follows it like
a faithful lemming.
Harry's job is to type a ransom
note and make some threatening
phone calls to the Malroux house
hold, where Rhea resides. Odette
Malroux (Chloe Sevigny), Rhea's co
conspirator, agrees to be "kidnapped"
in order to get her father's money,
and she similarly helps convince
Harry with an excessive amount of
skin and flirting glances. What a sul
try, corrupt family.
Predictably enough, "Palmetto"
ensures that Harry does not get the
money exactly as planned. In fact, a
lot of mayhem ensues. The maniacal
events which follow are the driving
forces of the movie, so I can't exactly
reveal anything after this point.
I found the unveiling of the
"truth"in the subsequent scenes un
convincing. Like the dark comedy
classic "Fargo,' the early minutes of
"Palmetto" began with the same mas
tery of regional humor, genuinely
original plot developments and
building pressure between scenes.
However, I grew antsy by the lime the
last bit of evidence was unmasked,
and 1 was disappointed. What could
have been ...
