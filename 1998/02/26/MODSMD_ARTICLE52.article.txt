# Senses and Sensibility
## Marlon Wayans' newest film is a college romp 
### 
If you like watching "The Wayans
Brothers," on the WB channel, then
chances are you will love "Senseless."
Marlon Wayans' comic antics have been
transplanted onto the big screen. As a
poor but intelligent student at Stratford
University (sound familiar?), Darryl
Witherspoon (Wayans) works just about
everywhere on campus. He's the prover
bial squirrel trying to get a nut in order to
support his mother and four siblings in
addition to paying his own tuition.
Witherspoon's financial problems will
be solved if he can land the position of ju
nior analyst for a firm named Smythe-
Bates. The only snag is that his entire
graduating economics class is going for
the same position. The competition for
the job is open to all, but of the five
selected finalists, the winner will have to
be a"Smythe-Bates
man": he must

have high academics, be a varsity athlete
and be a member of the Kappa Zeta fra
ternity.
Witherspoon's got the grades but he's
no athlete (he's a water boy for his school's
hockey team), and he doesn't belong to a
fraternity. His competition is Scott Butler
(David Spade), a preppy boy who's got it
all. Butler's dad owns the second wealthi
est bank in Manhattan, and Butler is the
captain of a varsity team and the head of
Kappa Zeta's social committee.
The fun comes from watching these
two lock horns as Witherspoon tries to
"cram" for the competition by becoming
a varsity athlete and a Kappa pledge
overnight. He does so with the help of
his wonder drug, a neon green potion
that looks like liquefied Silly Putty.
Witherspoon gets this liquid when he
becomes desperate for rent money and
signs up for a psychology experiment
that pays him $3,000.
The liquid is designed to heighten his
senses, but there are a few side effects. He
experiences acute rectal itching, stomach
cramps and nausea that are much worse
than any case you or I have known. When
he attempts to take an exam, the sensory
overload from pencil scratches, sneezing
and someone's bad breath does him in.
To make things worse, he can only use
four of his "super-senses" at a time. Since
he has no control over which four he will
be able to use at a given time, it makes for
a pretty humorous situation when he's
unable to call on the one he most needs.
"Senseless" won't have you doubling
over with laughter every five

seconds, but the situations

are rather humorous.

Wayans' clowning is at
its best and his funky
facial expressions are
down pat. However,
there are a few things
that seem out of
place in this farce.
Why is Smythe-
Bates only hiring
one Stratford stu
dent if the school is
so well-known and
the students so
smart? And why is it
that Witherspoon's
girlfriend Janice
(Tamara Taylor) just
happens to be the
daughter of tl»e
Smythe-Bates repre
sentative?
Given its title, I
guess you can't ex
pect this movie to
make too much
sense.
