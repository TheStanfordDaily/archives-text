## Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde 
### Richard Benjamin Contributing writer 
Lord Alfred Douglas, Oscar Wilde's lover,
once dubbed homosexuality the "love
that dare not speak its name." Recently,
some cultural critics have disagreed, stating
that "homosexuality" is the love that won't
shut up.
Such critics referto the recent surge in
films and plays that address homosexuality.
"Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar
Wilde," a new play about Oscar Wilde, bon-vi
vant and British wit, isn't just another chatty
rumination on homosexuality.
To the contrary, "Gross Indecency" is a
tantalizing legal drama that exposes the ge
nius and vulnerability of Wilde, who is con
sidered to have been one of the greatest writ
ers of the English language.
Wilde's understated charisma, his elitist
ideas about art, his defiant views of life and his
dry sense of humor supply the provocative
substance that sustains this absorbing two
hour drama.
The play opens on April 3, 1895, at the
Old Bailey Central Criminal Court in
London. Wilde files a legal suit against the
Marquess of Queensberry for publicly slan
dering him as a "posing sodomite." In defam
ing Wilde as a sodomite, the Marquess bitterly
sought to end Wilde's romantic relationship
with Lord Alfred Douglas, the Marquess's son.
After Wilde's suit against the Marquess, the
British Crown prosecutes Wilde in two other
trials for the crime of sodomy, or "gross inde
cency," with other males. These three trials in
volve not only Wilde and his accusers, but an
interesting parade of characters including
George Bernard Shaw, Frank Harris, Queen
Victoria, some of London's most derelict male
prostitutes and Wilde's fetching young lover.
"Gross Indecency" comes to San
Francisco after a triumphant 1997 off-

Broadway run. The playwright, Moises
Kaufman, read "The Wit and Humor of Oscar
Wilde," which inspired him to dramatize
Wilde's remarkable dilemmas. "The Wit and
Humor of Oscar Wilde" is a collection of the
artist's epigrams and witticisms satirizing
Victorian mores.
More importantly, this collection
alerted the playwright to Mr. Wilde's legal
troubles. "In these pages," he has confided, "I
found a fascinating event: an artist being
asked to justify his art in a court of law!"
In "Gross Indecency," Wilde's life unrav
els as he stands witness to defend his sexual
behavior. He must also defend a vision of art
and of life which offend Victorian sensibili
ties. The prosecution of Wilde is intellectually
intense. As we can expect, Wilde's defense of
art is uncompromising and grand.
The script is based on an artful melange
of courtroom transcripts, excerpts of Wilde's
literature and testimonies from his contempo
raries, friends and foes. This historical narra
tive, in its drive, suspense and grandeur, sur
passes the quality of what many fictional
playwrights dream up. "Gross Indecency" is a
hyper-literary affair, obsessed with written
words — namely legal transcripts, memoirs,
poetry, novels, letters, epigrams, news ac
counts, etc. It's amazing how much the play
relies on historical documents and literary
sources yet still keeps the story coherent, taut
and engrossing.
Most of the production's theatrical suc
cess results from its group of character actors
who truly constitute an ensemble. Tom Nelis,
the leading actor, delivers a memorable per
formance communicates the artist's contra
dictory personae as an elitist and a rebel. How

does Mr. Nelis perform sexual
dissidence? By avoiding the ob
vious cliches, playing Wilde
with a serene and measured de
meanor that manages both sub
tely and insight.
Joey Collins, an actor
with national credits, offers a
very credible and sympathetic
interpretation of Douglas. In
the opening court scene,
Collins's body language alone
hints at the suggestive and
tempestuous romantic affair
with the writer that would last
for years.
With his facial and verbal
tics, his brutishness and his per
fected Irish accent, Michael
Santo plays a tortured and im
posing Marquess of
Queensberry with wonderful
effect. Six superb narrators —
who also play judges, prosti
tutes, journalist, and narrators
— bridge the historical "facts"
of the trials with vignettes of
Wilde's life.
The set, designed by
Sarah Lambert, is minimal for
the purpose of versatility. The
lighting design also appears to
be economic and simple. At any
rate, with the production's high
caliber of acting, the surround
ings do not require emphasis.
This is a play about words,
ideas, and personae rather than
events.
The play reflects Wilde's
many complex characteristics,
most notably his intellect, aes
thete and contrarian charm.
Tony Kushner, "Angels in
America" playwright, has noted
that, "Charm, which Evelyn
Waugh famously identified as
the dry-rot infecting the
English soul, was transformed
by Wilde into something vivid
almost too vivid [and] subver
sive. His charm had less to with
good manners and a pleasant
demeanor than with an elusive
but fundamental valence, a
force profoundly influencing
the structure of things." And
people. A sardonic, lively, pro
duction, "Gross Indecency" ig
nores platitudes and melo
drama and seduces us to think
about the importance of
Wilde's ideas and the valence of
his charm.
