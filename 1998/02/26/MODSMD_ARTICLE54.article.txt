# 'King Gordogan' Review
## 
### 
Performed in the intimate
Little Theater in front of a full
house that overflowed onto the
stage, "King Gordogan" capti
vated its audience from its light
hearted opening to its bleak
conclusion. All the while, it sur
prised them with an engaging
and often discomforting blend
of comedy, tragedy, fantasy and
horror.
Adorned in costumes
ranging from a drape of motley
rags to a glittering suit of chain
mail, the actors and actresses
tumbled, sang, laughed, cried
and delivered eloquent mono
logues while endowing their ar
chetypal characters with larger
than-life vibrancy.
The fairy tale characters
included a wood nymph, an im
prisoned princess and an herbal
magician, but they addressed
themes like power, violence,
love, truth, death and happi
ness.
Abhi Katyal's portrayal of
the fool, a Shakespearean-like
man who presented wisdom
cloaked in nonsensical riddles,
was particularly captivating.
Katyal's character held elabo
rate conversations with himself
that required him to instanta
neously change voices, loca
tions, intonation and expres
sion.
All of the actors and ac
tresses delivered fabulous per
formances. They maintained an
urgency of motion despite the
ever-present motif of waiting as
they relied on the appearance of
the knight-as-savior to rescue
them all from the abuses of
King Gordogan.
Because audience mem
bers sat on all sides of the ac
tors, a few of the lines directed
at one portion of the audience
were difficult to understand by
the rest of the audience.
Despite this, yet under the
superb directing of Drama
graduate student Evan Winet,
the play as a whole held to
gether seamlessly. Character
and plot developments were
complex but easy to follow.
The costumes, set, light
ing and sound all combined to
create vague impressions of lo
cations and people. The audi
ence members used the play's
lines and their own imagina
tions to endow the fantasy
world with detail, depth and

history. For example, a metal
skeleton draped in a white cloth
with holes for windows repre
sented the White Tower and
King Gordogan's oversized regal
garb, ornamented with horse
brushes and rope, suggested his
previous occupation as stable
boy.
Preserving the play's sur
realistic environment, set de
signer William Hddelman, asso
ciate professor in the Drama
Department, combined cloth
covered scaffolding, a splatter
painted floor, and a canopy
composed of rope, tattered
burlap and strings of lights to
create what he referred to as a
"found-object forest."
Lighting that shifted from
sharp to soft and from warm to
scattered and eerie enhanced
both the play's mysticism and
tangibility. Sound effects in
eluding music, recorded voices
and slapstick bleeps and tinkles
manipulated the atmosphere.
The atmosphere varied from
comic to violent to melan
cholic, hitting all emotions in
between.
Playwright Radovan Ivsic
flew to Stanford from his home
in Paris to see the West Coast
premiere of his play, which he
wrote more than half a century
ago in Nazi-occupied Croatia.
He attended all four per
formances. Following the
Friday night performance, he
participated in a question-and
answer session.
Satisfied with Stanford's
rendition, he said to the actors,
"I'm very glad with all of you.
You're so enthusiastic." He said
that the play is not just a de
nouncement of Hitler's regime
in particular because "Hitler is
not the only evil in the world...
I would like to be seen as
against every totalitarian
regime, even those that will
come in the future."
He admits that he wrote
the play while feeling very pes
simistic about the world, but he
encouraged audience members
to interpret his message for
themselves.
"Now the significance de
pends only on you," he said.
"Although my own view of the
world is very dark, you have to
decide."
