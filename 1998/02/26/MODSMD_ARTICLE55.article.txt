## G is for... 
### Mae West Coltrane 
In 1950, physician Ernst
Grafenberg "discovered" the fe
male vaginal orgasm. He as
cribed it to stimulation of a spot
inside the vagina and promptly
named the spot after himself.
Since then, the
Grafenberg spot theory has be
come kind of like a religion:
there's some who believe in it,
there's some who don't and nei
ther side can imagine why the
other can't see the Truth.
First, the believers. The holy
tome of the pro G-spot sect is
called "The G-Spot," and was
published in 1980 by a trio of
sex researchers. This is the
gospel according to Drs.
Laddas, Whipple and Perry:
There is a spot inside the
vagina, a little ways up the front
wall, that is extremely sensitive
to deep pressure. When prop
erly stimulated, the spot fills
with blood, and an orgasm or
two quickly results. Proper
stimulation can include pene
tration with fingers or toys or
even regular intercourse.
Multiple orgasms through
regular intercourse? Hallelujah,
I'm a believer!
That's not all. At the mo
ment of orgasm, in some cases,
a tablespoon or so of colorless
fluid shoots out of the urethra.
It's not urine, it's ejaculate!
Chemically, it's almost identical
to male prostatic fluid!
This phenomenon might be
news to you even if you're fe
male. After all, conventional
wisdom according to Masters
and lohnson is that "the clitoris
is the only source of orgasm in
the female." You can't feel the G
spot unless it's stimulated. It's
hard to reach your own G-spot
if you're lying on your back
And most women don't often
experience vaginal orgasms, let
alone ejaculate.
This, sisters, has got to
change. I'm not saying every
woman needs to start ejaculat
ing. 1 m not promising you'll
find your G-spot and have mul
tiple vaginal orgasms happily
ever after. But it's worth some
exploration. Getting familiar
with your body can only do you
good.
First, find a comfortable po
sition. Ciravity naturally pulls
your innards downward and
away from questing fingers if
you're on your back, so try sit
ting, squatting or lying on your
stomach. Put a finger or two in
your vagina and feel around the

front wall. It's all going to feel
pretty much the same at first,
but try stroking it a little, maybe
pushing a bit. At some point,
you might just hit a spot that
makes you feel all funny if you
press on it. Most women report
an urgent need to pee when the
spot is pressed, but after a few
seconds this usually turns into
something else entirely. Eureka!
Now, just because you found
the spot doesn't mean you're
going to start ejaculating, or
even have vaginal orgasms. Try
squeezing your fingers with
your vagina — those are your
pubococcygeous (PC) muscles
you're using. This little bundle
of muscles controls the stream
when you pee, among other
things. You won't ejaculate un
less your PC muscles are strong.
You can exercise them by prac
ticing clenching and holding for
as long as you can.
But the strength of your PC
muscles isn't the only issue here.
No matter how strong your PCs
are, they won't work right if
your G-spot isn't getting stimu
lated in the first place. That
doesn't happen in most sexual
positions. The missionary posi
tion doesn't usually work—
you'll have better luck if you're
on top, or trying it doggie style.
Put gravity and natural cur
vature to work for you!
Your best bet is not with in
tercourse. Toys can be shaped
more conveniently (a slight
bend at the business end of
whatever you're using will
work), and fingers can be quite
effective if they're deft and sen
sitive, with well-trimmed fin
gernails...
Dr. Ruth Westheimer herself
is one of the G-spot nonbeliev
ers. She doesn't call the whole
thing a hoax, but she notes that
"not one gynecologist has been
able to give me the least indica
tion that such a spot exists." To
this comment, the believers re
ply that the spot is only de
tectable when a woman is
aroused, which doesn't gener
ally happen during a gyneco
logical exam and vou've got a
cold speculum stuck in your
vagina.
Dr. Ruth's main problem
with G-spot theory is the possi
ble "negative impact" on
women who can't find their G
spot. Performance anxiety? Or
resentment of women who do
have vaginal orgasms? It's just
like any other aspect of sex —
one part physiognomy and nine
parts personal preference.
Some women like to have
their nipples played with, some
like to chain up their lovers and
smear them with chocolate
mousse. But that doesn't mean
all women do.
I happen to be a G-spot be
liever, but if fingers or toys or a
penis in your vagina doesn't get
you off, that's none of my busi
ness or anyone else's.
As Dr. Ruth says, "If the G
spot does exist and if it is giving
women extra pleasure, that is a
great thing."
