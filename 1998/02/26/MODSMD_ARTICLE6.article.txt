Having a PC on campus doesn't
faze Peter Kasson. the computer
manager of American Studies
house. At least not until it's term
paper time.
"Printing's the main inconve
nience," Kasson said.
That may no longer be the case
for much of campus. Last week,
Tom Fountain and Mark Wang,
both computer science majors on
staff at Residential Computing, ini
plemented a new system that will
enable PC users to print to cluster
laser printers.
Until recently, PC users, who
make up 40 percent of campus
computer owners, couldn't print
from their rooms to dorm cluster
printers.
PC users could either save their
files as text and upload them to the
UNIX computers or trek to Sweet
Hall. A third and more expensive
option was to come to campus with
a personal printer. "Most people
assumed that thev couldn't print
[to a cluster computer]," said Jen
Chang, a resident computer coor
dinator at Mirrielees.
Res Comp has been fully aware
of the trials of PC-friendly stu
dents. "We've wanted to do [print

ing] on the Mac for about twt
years." said Jamey Frank. Re?
Comp's assistant director of pro
gram operations and support, "bui
we've never had the students or
staff who could do it."
Access to the new system re
quires the installation of software
available at the Res Comp World
Wide Web page. at
http://rescomp.stanford.edu. After
installing the software, users can
load Netscape or another Web
browser to authenticate the print
job and charge their print job to the
Stanford Card Plan.
In layman's terms, "you have to
put some software on your com
puter and use a network browser to
print." Frank said. The software
works with Windows V5 and Win
dows NT
Res Comp is already working on
a new version of the printing soft
ware. "We're going to have a com
pletely different version based on
PC Leland." Frank explained. PC
Leland is the PC equivalent of
MacLeland. the software used to
log in to cluster computers. Fhe
software is scheduled for testing
during the summer, and Res Comp
expects to make it available next

fall.
Junior Shannon Pierce, a
Cedro PC user, was surprised by
the news but said that she has
never had to deal with printing is
sues on campus.
"I have my own printer, and
I've always had my own printer,"
she said. Pierce added that she
might use the new software if her
computer were networked, which
it is not.
Kasson. who also owns his own
printer, indicated that the new
printing software was part of a
positive trend. He felt that Res
Comp's support of PC users is in
creasing as the number of PC stu
dents on campus grows. "I think
Res Comp's being pretty good
about it,"he said.
