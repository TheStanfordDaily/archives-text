# Mardi Gras
## 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
The theme is drunken festivity
and the motto is anything goes for
the wild week-long parade of beads,
floats and decadence at the New Or
leans celebration of Mardi Gras.
Who would have thought that a
traditional ("atholic holiday could be
so much fun?
"It's a chance for people from all
over the country to come together
and party," said sophomore Katie
Noyes. Noyes witnessed I he mud
ness firsthand last week.
The bacchanalian event, which
took place this past Tuesday, en
courages merrymaking in order to

satiate the desires of the flesh before
a season of abstinence during Lent.
It's called Mardi Gras, or "Fat Tues
day," and it attracts a large Stanford
contingency each year.
The name comes from an ancient
custom of parading a fat ox through
the streets on Shrove Tuesday, the
day before Ash Wednesday and the
beginning of Lent.
Hut it has come to mean more to
New Orleans tourists — Stanford
students among them — than just a
religious commemoration.
f-oi one week of the year, the
town teems with zealous tourists
stumbling through a token economy
of necklaces and drinks. The name
of the game is beads, a commodity

more valuable than gold.
"You walk down the street and
all you're thinking is 'Beads!
Beads!'" said senior Tom ( louse,
who went to the event two years ago.
"You really end up wanting them so
badly. It's beautiful because it's so
artificial and made up."
"Lots of guys will come up to you
and say. 'What will you do for these
beads?' or 'What can I do for those
beads?' without any inhibitions,"
Noyes said.
And what will the beads get you
in the midst of hoards of people,
daiquiris in their hands, necklaces
and confetti flying through the air?
"You can trade the beads for ei
ther a kiss." or vou can get flashed.

according to ("louse, who told of pa
rades where people threw beads
from floats into the crowds.
These kinds of rules invite an ex
cess of uninhibited requests for kiss
es or other kinds of sexual favors.
"It's always your decision," re
marked senior Shaine Mullcr. who
went this year with a group of 14.
"But some people are a little out of
line."
"The norm there is girls pulling
their shirts up and exposing them
selves for $2 beads. Of course, it's
liberating for them — they want to
do it." Mullcr said. She added that
"vou have to know vour limits."

It is possible to walk down Bour
bon Street at any time of day and see
women on men's shoulders, yelling
and Hashing their breasts, according
to senior Steve Murphy.
"It's the kind of thing that's great
to experience once." said senior
Mackenzie I arson, who used to be a
student at I'ulanc I 'niversity in New
Orleans. "Everyone just sort of
leaves their morals at home."
From daytime parades to drive
through daiquiri bars on Bourbon
Street, the place is wild. It is some
what reminiscent of a giant fraterni
ty party, according to Mullet".
"It's all really a da/e while you're

there." douse said of his five-day
trip two years ago, when he slept in
his car with three friends and "show
ered" in the bathroom of a Denny's
restaurant. "When you wake up, you
just feel great even if you've slept for
an hour because you know you're at
Mardi Ciras. There's such amazing
energy the w hole week."
"I remember watching this guy
start doing a strip show right on
Bourbon Street above the C at's
Meow [bar)," Larson said.
"He started with his belt buckle
and then kept disrobing with this se
ductive dance — and all of a sudden
he started shaking his pelvis out of
control."
Mullersaw the same kind of spec
tacle last year.
"1 saw a businesswoman come

out on a balcony wearing slacks and
throwing beads — we didn't expect
her to fully pull off her slacks" for the
whole street to see. she said.
The scene is not as much fun for
the few Christian missionaries who
protest with "Repent Sinners" ban
ners. according to Noyes. But for the
majority of the tourists, who range
from children to college students to
40-year-olds, the week is an adven
ture and certainly a party.
Everyone took home beads as
mementos of the craziness. Murphy
even came home with a pack of
beads that Jerry Springer threw off a
float.
The behavior may be borderline,
the concept a little shady. But all
Stanford contingents would agree
that the Mardi Ciras is a must-see.
