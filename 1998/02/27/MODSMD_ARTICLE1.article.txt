# Mardi Gras
##

The theme is drunken festivity
and the motto is anything goes for
the wild week-long parade of beads,
floats and decadence at the New Or
leans celebration of Mardi Gras.
Who would have thought that a
traditional ("atholic holiday could be
so much fun?
"It's a chance for people from all
over the country to come together
and party," said sophomore Katie
Noyes. Noyes witnessed I he mud
ness firsthand last week.
The bacchanalian event, which
took place this past Tuesday, en
courages merrymaking in order to

satiate the desires of the flesh before
a season of abstinence during Lent.
It's called Mardi Gras, or "Fat Tues
day," and it attracts a large Stanford
contingency each year.
The name comes from an ancient
custom of parading a fat ox through
the streets on Shrove Tuesday, the
day before Ash Wednesday and the
beginning of Lent.
Hut it has come to mean more to
New Orleans tourists — Stanford
students among them — than just a
religious commemoration.
f-oi one week of the year, the
town teems with zealous tourists
stumbling through a token economy
of necklaces and drinks. The name
of the game is beads, a commodity

more valuable than gold.
"You walk down the street and
all you're thinking is 'Beads!
Beads!'" said senior Tom ( louse,
who went to the event two years ago.
"You really end up wanting them so
badly. It's beautiful because it's so
artificial and made up."
"Lots of guys will come up to you
and say. 'What will you do for these
beads?' or 'What can I do for those
beads?' without any inhibitions,"
Noyes said.
And what will the beads get you
in the midst of hoards of people,
daiquiris in their hands, necklaces
and confetti flying through the air?
"You can trade the beads for ei
ther a kiss." or vou can get flashed.

according to ("louse, who told of pa
rades where people threw beads
from floats into the crowds.
These kinds of rules invite an ex
cess of uninhibited requests for kiss
es or other kinds of sexual favors.
"It's always your decision," re
marked senior Shaine Mullcr. who
went this year with a group of 14.
"But some people are a little out of
line."
"The norm there is girls pulling
their shirts up and exposing them
selves for $2 beads. Of course, it's
liberating for them — they want to
do it." Mullcr said. She added that
"vou have to know vour limits."
