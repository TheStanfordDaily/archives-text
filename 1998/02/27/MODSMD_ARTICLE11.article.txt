WASHINGTON (AP) Legis
lation to overhaul campaign finance
rules fell to a Republican filibuster
in the Senate on yesterday, leaving
the issue doomed for the foresee
able future despite the abuses
uncovered since the lWf> election.
A final effort to punch through
CiOP delaying tactics failed. 51-4.X.
nine votes shy of the 60 needed.
Moments later Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott ushered the
measure off the floor.
Even as he did so. supporters of
the hill said time and the scent of
scandal — were on their side.
"There will be more indictments,
and there will be people going to
jail. And there is probabh some
scandal going on now as we speak,
because the system has become so
badlv corrupted." said Sen. John
McCain. R Ariz.

President Clinton said. ' Just ;is
the need for change has not gone
away, campaign finance reform \mII
not go awav
Opponents, who contend the
legislation would violate the free
speech guarantee of the Constitu
tion. said they'd he reads
" The First Amendment doesn't
allow us the latitude to categorize
certain kinds of speech as offensive
and other kinds of speech as laud
able." said Sen Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky.
The centerpiece of the hill,
which was drafted b\ McCain and
Sen. Russ Feingold. D-VNis.. \*;is a
ban on unregulated "soft money"
that flows by the millions to nation
al political parties from corpora
tions. labor unions and individuals.
In hopes of building additional
support, supporters sealed a com-

promise during the week with
Maine s (i()P Sen ()l\mpia Snowe
to curtail the use of union dues in
campaign spending and to rein in
attack ads that outside groups air in
the final weeks of a campaign.
That change gave Democrats
and GOP supporters of the mea
sure enough votes to overcome
even stricter eurbs on unions than
Lott and other Repubheans had
sought.
A test vote for the stricter pro
posal. which would require unions
to obtain written consent from indi
vidual members before spending
dues on political activity, drew onl\

we now have a majorit> of the Sen- •
ate in favor of campaign finance •
