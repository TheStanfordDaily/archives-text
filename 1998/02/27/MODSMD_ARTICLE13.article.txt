Report reveals unity
and demoralization
among female faculty

The report released
Tuesday by the Women's
Coalition for Gender Equity
has raised the issue of the hiring and
retention of female faculty to a new
level of significance.
The report marks both the achieve
ment of a united University-wide
effort to tackle this issue and demon
strates an alarming perception that
Stanford is increasingly inhospitable
to female academics.
The report confirms that the per
centage of tenured female professors
at Stanford falls well below both the
national average as well as the per
centage of women earning doctorates
in a variety of fields. As disconcerting
as this is. these facts are nothing new.
However, the true significance of
this report is that Stanford's female
faculty appears more united than ever
in its attempt to raise consciousness
about gender inequities.
The report, which compiles recruit
ment. hiring and tenure data from the
School of Humanities and Sciences
and the School of Medicine, marks
the birth of a broad-based, campus
wide coalition to study the issue.
While data from Stanford's other
schools was not included, support for
the coalition has been demonstrated
by female professors University-wide,
ineludinu Law Prof. Deborah Rhode.

This is a marked departure from
previous critiques of women's tenure
status, which were handled on a
school-by-school or case-by-case
basis.
Yet. even more upsetting is the per
ception among female faculty that it is
becoming increasingly difficult to
have a fulfilling career at Stanford.
Female assistant professors in
many fields lack role models in their
departments, thereby diminishing the
potential for networking and other
forms of professional support. Many
of them also feel isolated within their
disciplines and grapple with the fact
that their research interests may not
coincide with the prevailing research
in their departments. This sense of
isolation is demoralizing and discour
ages competent female academics
from pursuing tenure at Stanford. It
also leads female students to recon
sider careers in academia.
Whether or not the administration
regards this report as a piece of credi
ble research analysis, it ought to be
concerned about the circumstances
that produced it. Only a well-devel
oped and immediate plan to address
gender inequity in tenuring faculty
will help to reverse the current trend
of demoralization. Immediate mea
sures are required to recognize and
nurture capable tenure track women
so they can believe there is a future
for them here at Stanford.
If Stanford's commitment to diver
sity is to be consistent across all phas
es of campus life, policies on tenure
must be revisited.
