Religious traditions call
out life's imperfections
What in our lives at Stanford is in need of
healing, transformation and change? ()ne of
the gifts of religious traditions is the way in
v\ hich they offer human beings the opportu
nity to honestly acknowledge the things in
our lives that aren't whole. Jews on Yom
Kippur. Muslims during Ramadan and
Christians on Ash Wednesday engage in
prayers and rituals that speak to the ongo
ing human need to speak honestly about
our wounds and our faults and to find ways
to begin our lives afresh.
This Wednesday at noon. Memorial
Church was full of people who came to have
ashes placed on their foreheads with the
words. "Remember that you are dust, and
to dust you shall return."
Various representatives from Stanford
faculty, staff and students read one-sen
tence statements about the things that need
continued healing and transformation in
our lives.
These things included a lack of full
iicceptance of pet>ple v\ ho come from differ
ent backgrounds, the ongoing denigration
>112 women's potential and leadership in reli
gious and academic lite, the intense pres
iure in our lives which prevents free think
ng and creative endeavors, the failure of
eligious groups to promote peace. <• jr col

lusion with the forces of power and money
and the failure to adequately hear the con
cerns of those in need.
Frequently at Stanford the rallying cry is
"excellence in everything." The tears 1 saw
in many people's eyes who came to receive
ashes on Wednesday led me to believe that
all our achievements notwithstanding, we
equally need those opportunities to
acknowledge the less-than-excellent aspects
of our lives.

Unz proposition will
hurt bilingual education
I would like to commend The Daily on
its efforts to present balanced coverage of
Proposition 227. formerly known as the Unz
initiative. As a second grade bilingual teach
er in Los Angeles. I have students and fam
ilies who would be directly affected by this
prop< >sition.
So I can attest that, although Ron Unz
presents an argument against bilingual edu
cation which seems to follow from the
"facts" he cites, his attacks on bilingual edu
cation are entirely unfounded.
I Jnz claims that parents everywhere arc
forced against their will into having their
children placed in bilingual programs. He

cites the parent boycott of 9th Street Ele
mentary School in Los Angeles as evidence
for this claim. What he fails to recognize is
that the parents involved in the boycott
reflect only a small minority of the parents
at that school, most of whom are satisfied
with bilingual education.
A recent La Opinion (a Los Angeles
newspaper) poll indicated that the vast
majority of Latino parents with children in
school support bilingual education.
And. contrary to Unz's claims, parents
everywhere already have a choice. By law.
they can choose between a bilingual or an
all-dav English program for their children
all they have to do is sign a form. And
schools inform them of that choice — mine
certainly does.
If we pass Proposition 227. we will elimi
nate parental choice. Parents would have to
find 19 other students at the same grade
level to constitute a bilingual class, or they
would lose that option entirely. That
doesn't sound like "parental choice" to me.
The detrimental effects of Proposition
227 on parental choice would be com
pounded by the loss of local district control
over educational programs. Currently, dis
tricts choose which program fits their partic
ular group of students best.
Under Proposition 227. all of the cur
rently successful bilingual programs would
be eliminated. They would be replaced by a
single, "one size fits all." state-mandated

education program.
Teachers would also be deeply affected
by Proposition 227. Under the terms of the
proposition, teachers could be held person
ally liable for not following its exact dic
tates.
Certainly, teacher accountability for stu
dent success is crucial. Hut even police offi
cers do not face being sued personally. So
why should such a Draconian proposition
be imposed upon teachers, particularly
when it could destroy the possibility of good
parent-teacher relationships by making
teachers fearful of being sued by their stu
dents' parents?
There is no educational research that
supports the proposition created by Unz.
w ho admits never to have personally visited
a bilingual classroom. Unz. claims it's "com
mon sense" that one year of immersion in
English should be enough. Hut no experts
on child language acquisition support this
position.
In fact, even the strongly anti-bilingual
education Little Hoover Commission
Report (1993) notes that "some experts
believe that
English can be academically comprehen
sible for children in as little as two years,
while others believe that six or more years
of assistance is necessary" (p. 3b). That's
two years as a hart minimum.
The best argument against Unz. though,
is that bilingual education programs, when

set up correctly, work. There are lots of very
successful programs across California in
which students are acquiring English litera
cy more rapidly than children in all-day
English programs. The main rationale is
that students who achieve literacy in their
first language will transfer those literacy
skills to English. Furthermore, there is evi
dence that students who attain high levels of
literacy in both languages outperform their
monolingual peers on some cognitive tasks.
There are some bilingual programs that
need improvement. Hut that's no reason to
take Un/'s wrecking ball approach of elimi
nating the entire system.
We need to preserve programs in which
students are successful and improve the oth
ers with more teachers, more accountability
and more community participation.
Bilingual education needs improvement,
but lln/'s Proposition 227 won't be con
structive — it will only hurt children, par
ents and teachers.
