## Navigating the South Mezzanine 
### 
THE SIGN dis
creetly hangs from
the ceiling in the
basement of Green
Library. I am surrounded
on each side by narrow
handicap inaccessible
bookshelves with lights
turned on and off in a

strangely familiar pattern. I must press on.
Past the study bar, past the mysterious
masturbation cubicles with locked doors
and glass-topped walls, past more book
shelves, I approach the entrance. Deep
inside the depths of knowledge, I pass
through the portal and enter my destina
tion: South Mezzanine.
Clonking down the metal stairs, I pro
ceed. weaving in and out of thin metal sup
port rods. Thick fencing which protects
Stanford's prized government documents is
now on my right. Desperate signs written in
a shaky hand read, "How do 1 get to the
other side?"
"No one gets to the other side," 1 shout.
A man in plain clothes behind a desk
notices my unruly behavior, flips his news
paper (obviously a prop) and carefully picks
up a stapler (obviously the signal for Del
con 2).
Before the plain-clothed man was able to
set the vicious security protocols into
motion. I stole a few glances at the precious
government documents. I made out the fol
lowing words on several manila file contain
ers: "Cure for AIDS." " TWA Flight 800
bombing patterns" and "Hob Saget."
I kick aside discarded study cubicle parts
and remind mvself that this is onlv an inter

mediate hallway to the real secrets of the
Stanford campus and the universe. A Hood
of florescent light guides me to the top of
more metal stairs, and as soon as I reach the
metal floor, the "X-Files" theme by D.J.
Dado starts to play. 1 have arrived at the
innermost sanctum of Stanford's South
Mezzanine.
Nowhere is more isolated. Nowhere is
more peaceful. Nowhere is more exhilarat
ing. Enchanting paradise for some, mole
fantasy camp for others. This is the play
ground for genius, I tell myself. I stroll
around visiting my usual stops. I pull off a
bound collection of Scientific Americans
from 1861 and run my fingers over the
pages feeling the impressions of the old
printing presses. I attempt to build some
desks from old study cubicle parts. 1 study
the asbestos tubes a foot above my head
and read their warnings.
An attempt to summon the elevator in
the far corner fails. This is good; technology
should not reach and spoil this nirvana. I
was enraged when they placed computers
and a copy machine in the South Mezza
nine. My discomfort was relieved when I
saw that patrons were only using the com
puters to bookmark nudie pages on the
Internet.
A mockery was made of those evil
machines. Bytes of knowledge erased for
bytes of carnal passions; nothing could
make me prouder. Don't you see we have
all the knowledge we need down here in the
precious volumes of the South Mezzanine?
The only directory we need is our souls
effortlessly guiding us from one book to the
next.

A secret known only to the regulars —
the enlightened society, as we like to call
ourselves — was that Theodore Kac/ynski,
Dr. Unabomber, used to study down here.
While teaching at UC-Berkeley, he used to
drive down on the weekends and study in
the confines of the South Mezzanine. Some
times he would sleep in the narrow dark
corridors of books and dream of simpler
times and mail bombs. His hatred for tech
nology blossomed and grew as he in
the asbestos fumes. The insertion of cawcls
in place of the standard wooden desks is
what drove him over the edge. That is how
delicate the balance is down here. Oh. how
fragile the fiber between a genius and a
madman.
After making the rounds, 1 decided to
exit my lair. Back through the metal corri
dor, I return from my intellectual health
spa. Yet, one more barrier remains; the per
vasive Green L.ibrary backpack check.
Honestly, 1 feel as if I am disrobing every
time I have to expose the inner contents of
my backpack. What are they looking for?
What have they seen? Where are my
Miranda rights?
If this is the price to be paid for a visit to
the holy ground. 1 will pay it a thousand
times. This visit was just a checkup, a
reminder, a recentering. This is part of my
typical routine anytime I have 10 minutes
between classes.

puter science, spends every day in a much
more disturbing place than the South Mez
zanine: the Sterling Quadrangle.
