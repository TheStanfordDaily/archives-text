## Jocelyn Wiener Deciphering the world's economic crises 
### 
I HAVE ALWAYS liked to believe that
economics is a cut-and-dry phe
nomenon. As I learned in Economies I.
capitalism is the reality.
The first time the specter of international
finance loomed dangerously near the core ol
my womblike existence was at the beginning
of this year. One afternoon, I ventured into
the Economics Department to make ;i dr
matic revelation. "I," I announced, "iiiii
interested in a major in economics."
"Okay," nodded a woman. She described
a tentative schedule for the rest of my time
at Stanford. I looked at it. It looked like
there would be a lot of economics classes
involved. I swallowed and continued to look
at it, but none of them went away.
Apparently encouraged by my enthusi
asm, she proceeded to lay out a tentative
schedule for the rest of my time on Earth.
"Right after you graduate, you can get an
internship working with the World Bank or
the IMF. Then you can get a job with the
World Bank or the IMF." I waited a minute
to make sure she didn't add any juicy ideo
logical winners like "... and feed hungry

children" or "... and foster community
empowe nent" to the description of my
prospt ive career. She didn't.
' ,Ed on my extensive knowledge of the
W d Bank. I knew working there was not
attractive option. This I knew because I
ad perceptively located the noun "Bank"
lacked onto the end of the term. Likewise,
working for the IMF was definitely not a
possibility. This I determined on principle
how could I stoop to work for the IMF if I
didn't know what IMF stood for?
Until Korea, the Philippines, Thailand
and Indonesia had the discourtesy to let
their economies wobble, I was quite com
fortable with my limited knowledge ol
America's — I mean the world's — major
financial institutions. Then, one fated
Wednesday. 1 picked up a copy of The New
York limes. There was no stopping my
frantic spiral toward worldliness.
Try as I might, I could not help but notice
that Mobil Corp. had taken out a full page
ad entitled. "The IMF: Does it Matter?"
This caused me a great deal of consterna
tion. 1 was happy assuming that the Interna

tional Monetary Fund did matter a nec
essary, nonvested organization representing
the hest interests of the world. Now Mobil, a
lavorite multinational. w:is supporting it
"Let's look at reality. Why does Asm
matter?" the Mobil ad asked, I he answei
was that '"Asian nations are our eusiomers,
our eompctitors. We buy clothing, electron
ic gadgets, teddy bears ;md vehicles that are
made or assembled in Asia." Ihts was an
interesting Contention. If I wore an
economist, perhaps I might have Iclt more
comfortable with it As it was. 1 could not
help wondering what, aside trom their sup
ply power, might lead us to believe that
Asian nations matter?
I he Mobil ;\d continued lo educate me.
'"()ne nation alone —even one as strong as
the United States — cannot stabilize entire
regions of the world. Only a multilateral
institution like the IMF has the ability to
press sovereign nations for tfie kind ot
reforms needed."
If 1 had been an intern with the IMF, I
might have been better able to understand
why the United States cannot stabilize

regions ol the world when it is so capable of
destabilizing them. I he Mobil ad forgot to
mention that I S loans helped foster the
current crisis I S banks funded nsk\
investments in"the tigei economies ol
Asia." Now that the "Asian contagion
threatens their investments, the IMI v\ill
baiJ them out.

didn t know what IMI stood for I had
