## Arizona up next after men win 86-73 at Sun Devils 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
I'EMPE, Ariz. — It was a little bit of revenge.
The men's basketball team remembered the stunning
overtime loss handed to them by Arizona State on Jan. 31.
That loss put the Cardinal two games behind confer
ence leader Arizona, a lead that the Wildcats have not re
linquished.
The No. K ( 'ardinal (24-3, 13-2 Pacific 10 Conference)
repaid the favor last night with a 86-73 victory at the Uni
versity Activity Center.
The Stanford victory was anchored by aggressive play
on the inside, with Mark Madsen having his best game
since returning from his foot injury.

The sophomore power forward scored 17 points on K
of-15 shooting and pulled down 13 boards to give junior
center Tim Young a little breathing room at the opposite
post.

"Coach |Mike] Montgomery's been stressing that as
post players we have to be aggressive, we have to take the

ball to the hole." Madsen said. "I le really emphasized the
importance ol improving our post play. I onight we were
able to make some strides, and we just have to continue
that."
Young took lull advantage of the situation, scoring 19
points and grabbing 14 boards for his tilth double-double
of the year.
"I felt like we did a good job inside," Montgomery said.
"1 kind of felt like the way they plav defense they were
kind of daring you to go there, and we felt we had to go in
side and create and get something done. So we did estab
lish inside presence, and that made a huge difference."
With Sun Devil coach Don Newman deciding not to
have his big men front Madsen and Young, the tandem
was able to get the ball down low and finish some plays.

"We didn't have Mark as much last time," Mont
gomery said. "We worked with Tim and Madsen on try
ing to score the hall low based on the way [the Sun Dev
ils] played in the post I felt that at least we got some by
products of Madsen tonight. Then we continued to em
phasize some stuff like. You've got to get lower in the
post catching the ball: you've got to get by them instead of
going straight up."
()f course, the two didn't have to do it alone.
Junior point guard Arthur Lee dumped in a team-high
21 points, including a three-pointer with 1 minute, 37 see
onds left to give the ( ardinal a 79-65 and put the Sun Dev
ils away for good.
