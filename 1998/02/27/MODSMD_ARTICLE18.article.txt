### Gil Lopez Staff writer

That loss put the Cardinal two games behind confer
ence leader Arizona, a lead that the Wildcats have not re
linquished.
The No. K ( 'ardinal (24-3, 13-2 Pacific 10 Conference)
repaid the favor last night with a 86-73 victory at the Uni

on the inside, with Mark Madsen having his best game

center Tim Young a little breathing room at the opposite

Arizona (25-3,15-0), 10 a.m. PS I . TV:CBS (SI V (!han

"Coach |Mike] Montgomery's been stressing that as
post players we have to be aggressive, we have to take the

ball to the hole." Madsen said. "I le really emphasized the
importance ol improving our post play. I onight we were
able to make some strides, and we just have to continue
that."
Young took lull advantage of the situation, scoring 19
points and grabbing 14 boards for his tilth double-double
of the year.
"I felt like we did a good job inside," Montgomery said.
"1 kind of felt like the way they plav defense they were
kind of daring you to go there, and we felt we had to go in
side and create and get something done. So we did estab
lish inside presence, and that made a huge difference."
With Sun Devil coach Don Newman deciding not to
have his big men front Madsen and Young, the tandem
was able to get the ball down low and finish some plays.

"We didn't have Mark as much last time," Mont
gomery said. "We worked with Tim and Madsen on try
ing to score the hall low based on the way [the Sun Dev
ils] played in the post I felt that at least we got some by
products of Madsen tonight. Then we continued to em
phasize some stuff like. You've got to get lower in the
post catching the ball: you've got to get by them instead of
going straight up."
()f course, the two didn't have to do it alone.
Junior point guard Arthur Lee dumped in a team-high
21 points, including a three-pointer with 1 minute, 37 see
onds left to give the ( ardinal a 79-65 and put the Sun Dev
ils away for good.
Lee's counterpart, junior Kris
Weems. did a remarkably good job
distributing the ball, gathering a ca
reer-high nine assists.
The Sun Devils (17-11, 7-8)
didn't make it easy on the Cardinal.
Stanford held an 18-point lead in the
first half before Arizona State came
back with a 20-3 run. Onlv Lee's
three-pointer at the buzzer gave the
Cardinal a more comfortable 42-38
cushion heading into the locker
room.
I he Cardinal then controlled the
tempo of the game throughout the
second half. After outrunning the
Cardinal for the last eight minutes of
the first period, Arizona State
couldn't get back into its offense.
Sun Devil forwards Mike Batiste
and Hobby Lazor did combine for
24 points and 21 rebounds but didn't
have the consistent guard play that
the Cardinal had behind it.
Eddie House, Ahlon Lewis and
Jeremy Veal, Arizona State's start
ing backcourt. shot a combined 12 of
36 from the field. Veal, the confer
ence's leading scorer, had a game
high 24 points but made only seven
shots on 21 attempts.
("he loss is a setback for Arizona
State's NCAA tournament aspira

tions and pushes the team even fur
ther on the bubble.
"We don't like getting beat any
where. especially not at home," said
junior forward Peter Sauer, who fin
ished with 11 points and nine re
bounds. "So we had a chance to
come back and beat these guys on
their home floor. We knew we had
to play hard, and we had to play well.
It's a tough weekend out here.
These arc two really good teams, so
it's gmxJ to get one out of the way
and see what we can do on Saturday.
"You could tell that they were
going for the win. They had a fire in
their eyes. They have the firepower
to get back into it. This is a different
team under new leadership.
Now the Cardinal can look to to
morrow's rematch with the Wild
cats. a game for which it needs no
motivation to prepare.
No. 2 Arizona (25-3, 15-0)
snapped Stanford's 18-game win
ning streak — then the nation's
longest run — back on Jan. 29 and is
now looking to become the first
team to go undefeated in the league
since the conference expanded to 10
teams. Meanwhile. Stanford is try
ing to run the table on the road in the
Pac-lOfor the first time.
This time the Wildcats have the
18-game winning streak, and Mont
gomery's squad would love nothing
more than a little revenge.

24 points and 21 rebounds but didn't
have the consistent guard play that
the Cardinal had behind it.
Eddie House, Ahlon Lewis and
Jeremy Veal, Arizona State's start
ing backcourt. shot a combined 12 of
36 from the field. Veal, the confer
ence's leading scorer, had a game
high 24 points but made only seven
shots on 21 attempts.
("he loss is a setback for Arizona
State's NCAA tournament aspira

tions and pushes the team even fur
ther on the bubble.
"We don't like getting beat any
where. especially not at home," said
junior forward Peter Sauer, who fin
ished with 11 points and nine re
bounds. "So we had a chance to
come back and beat these guys on
their home floor. We knew we had
to play hard, and we had to play well.
It's a tough weekend out here.
These arc two really good teams, so
it's gmxJ to get one out of the way
and see what we can do on Saturday.
"You could tell that they were
going for the win. They had a fire in
their eyes. They have the firepower
to get back into it. This is a different
team under new leadership.
Now the Cardinal can look to to
morrow's rematch with the Wild
cats. a game for which it needs no
motivation to prepare.
No. 2 Arizona (25-3, 15-0)
snapped Stanford's 18-game win
ning streak — then the nation's
longest run — back on Jan. 29 and is
now looking to become the first
team to go undefeated in the league
since the conference expanded to 10
teams. Meanwhile. Stanford is try
ing to run the table on the road in the
Pac-lOfor the first time.
This time the Wildcats have the
18-game winning streak, and Mont
gomery's squad would love nothing
more than a little revenge.

I'EMPE, Ariz. — It was a little bit of revenge.
The men's basketball team remembered the stunning
overtime loss handed to them by Arizona State on Jan. 31.
That loss put the Cardinal two games behind confer
ence leader Arizona, a lead that the Wildcats have not re
linquished.
The No. K ( 'ardinal (24-3, 13-2 Pacific 10 Conference)
repaid the favor last night with a 86-73 victory at the Uni
versity Activity Center.
The Stanford victory was anchored by aggressive play
on the inside, with Mark Madsen having his best game
since returning from his foot injury.

The sophomore power forward scored 17 points on K
of-15 shooting and pulled down 13 boards to give junior
center Tim Young a little breathing room at the opposite
post.
MEN'S BASKETBALL"
■ Last night: Stanford K6, Arizona State 73
■ Tomorrow: No. 8 Stanford (24 5,13-2 Pac 10) at No 1
Arizona (25-3,15-0), 10 a.m. PS I . TV:CBS (SI V (!han
nel 25). RADIO: KZSIJ (90.1 FM), KTCT (1050 AM).
"Coach |Mike] Montgomery's been stressing that as
post players we have to be aggressive, we have to take the

ball to the hole." Madsen said. "I le really emphasized the
importance ol improving our post play. I onight we were
able to make some strides, and we just have to continue
that."
Young took lull advantage of the situation, scoring 19
points and grabbing 14 boards for his tilth double-double
of the year.
"I felt like we did a good job inside," Montgomery said.
"1 kind of felt like the way they plav defense they were
kind of daring you to go there, and we felt we had to go in
side and create and get something done. So we did estab
lish inside presence, and that made a huge difference."
With Sun Devil coach Don Newman deciding not to
have his big men front Madsen and Young, the tandem
was able to get the ball down low and finish some plays.

"We didn't have Mark as much last time," Mont
gomery said. "We worked with Tim and Madsen on try
ing to score the hall low based on the way [the Sun Dev
ils] played in the post I felt that at least we got some by
products of Madsen tonight. Then we continued to em
phasize some stuff like. You've got to get lower in the
post catching the ball: you've got to get by them instead of
going straight up."
()f course, the two didn't have to do it alone.
Junior point guard Arthur Lee dumped in a team-high
21 points, including a three-pointer with 1 minute, 37 see
onds left to give the ( ardinal a 79-65 and put the Sun Dev
ils away for good.
Lee's counterpart, junior Kris
Weems. did a remarkably good job
distributing the ball, gathering a ca
reer-high nine assists.
The Sun Devils (17-11, 7-8)
didn't make it easy on the Cardinal.
Stanford held an 18-point lead in the
first half before Arizona State came
back with a 20-3 run. Onlv Lee's
three-pointer at the buzzer gave the
Cardinal a more comfortable 42-38
cushion heading into the locker
room.
I he Cardinal then controlled the
tempo of the game throughout the
second half. After outrunning the
Cardinal for the last eight minutes of
the first period, Arizona State
couldn't get back into its offense.
Sun Devil forwards Mike Batiste
and Hobby Lazor did combine for
24 points and 21 rebounds but didn't
have the consistent guard play that
the Cardinal had behind it.
Eddie House, Ahlon Lewis and
Jeremy Veal, Arizona State's start
