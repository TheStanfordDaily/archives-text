# Athletics to revamp fall classes
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
Crowded yoga classes and already-filled
golf courses will soon be a thing of the past.
Noticing the increasing demand for indi
vidual sports and conditioning classes, the
Athletics Department is moving to intro
duce more of these kind of classes, including
more aerobics, golf and yoga.
Senior Assoc. Athletic Director Cheryl
Levick said the department wants to ail
dress the changing needs of students in the
physical education curriculum. "We need to
examine what is in demand and what is not,"
Levick said. "Over the past five years, the
trend has been toward more individual and
stress relief activities."
Levick stressed that there has only been
a slight drop in demand for team sport class
es, and she attributed the trend to students'
desires to have "scheduled time blocks of

activity" where they can spend time on indi
vidual conditioning.
Nina Kim, a senior who is currently tak
ing aerobics, said she originally began the
class to help her get in shape. She said that
the classes she enrolled in have been at max
imum capacity, and if they were to get any
larger, the si/e would be unmanageable.
Over the past few quarters, students
have signed up in overwhelming numbers
for both yoga and golf, creating a situation
where "hundreds of students are turned
away," according to L-evick.
Asst. Athletic Director Shirley School is
in charge of collecting data on student needs
and organizing the classes, the bulk of which
will begin fall quarter. Schoof said that the
process of planning for the classes is only
just beginning, and that while she is "excited
about it. they haven't made any decisions
yet."
Schoof said that the department is look

ing for ways to actually add more time slots
for classes. She suggested two-hour golf
classes on Fi days along with the twicc-a
week. one-hour classes that are already
being offered. Currently, the Athletics De
partment docs not offer classes on Fridays,
and School said that utilizing this day would
ease the burden on other classes.
Several physical education classes, espe
cially golf classes, have had to turn to a spe
cial sign-up system in order to accomodate
more students. The current system rotates
through the alphabet of student last names,
giving students with last names early in the
alphabet sign-up priority during fall quarter,
then middle-alphabet last names priority in
winter, etc.
This preference system has created
scheduling problems for many students, and
the sign-up system will also be evaluated
while the department is revamping its cur
riculum.
