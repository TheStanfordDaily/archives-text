# Cagers win despite sloppy play
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Somebody must have set the
alarm clock of the Stanford
women's basketball team for four
minutes into the second half.
That's when, trailing 46-45. the
fifth-ranked Cardinal (IK-5. 14-1

Pacific 10 Conference) shook oft
the cobwebs to embark on a 19-0
run that made yesterday's game
the runaway it was expected to be
and secured a 90-71 win over Ari
zona State (10-14. 6-9) at Maples
Pavilion.
"I think it was our defense." se
nior forward ()lympia Scott said of

the run. "We created the offense
off our defense. We get the inten
sity going, and it gets us motivated
all the way around."
Scott played a big part in the
run. scoring seven of her 15 points
in the stretch that spanned exact!)
five minutes. In that time, the Sun
Devils managed to cough the ball

up four times thanks mostly to the
increased intensity of Stanford's
defense.
"1 think Stanford cranked it
up," said Arizona State head
coach Charli I urner Thorne.
"1 hey came at us and played bet
ter defense. That's a key time.
That's when 1 have to start subbing,
and we drop off when we sub. Stan
ford doesn't."
A big reason for that is that Stan
ford's No. 1 sub is senior forward
Kristin Folkl. Folkl. who was award
ed the Honda Broderiek award for
most outstanding volleyball player
and is a Naismith Player of the Year
finalist for basketball along with
Scott, came off the bench to lead
Stanford with 16 points and a game
high eight rebounds.
Folkl was 3 of 3 from the field
and b of 8 from the line in the sec
ond half after a four-point first half.
Bui all told, the Cardinal's first-half
performance wasn't all that bad.
Stanford shot a phenomenal 68 per
cent from the field, but at 57.7 per
cent the Sun Devils were doing all
they could to keep up.
Senior guard Rameeka Lowe
and junior forward Kisha White
paced Arizona State with 10 points
each in the half, and the Sun Devils
were only down 43-38 heading into
the locker room.
"Sometimes what I've seen us do
with certain teams is just come out
and see what they're doing," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-

Derveer. "Instead of coming out
and being the aggressor, instead of
coming out and saying, 'We're
ready to go,' there seems to be a
wait and see attitude. And we don't
have that luxury. We need to capi
talize; we need people to finish."
Stanford didn't pick it up much
more to start the second half, and
an 8-2 Sun Devil run to start the half
gave Arizona State the one-point
lead. After being held scoreless in
the first half, sophomore center
Rachel Holt took the pass from se
nior forward Stephanie Freeman
for the easy lavup to give the Sun
Devils the lead.
That was about the last highlight
for Arizona State. After the Card's
demoralizing run.the lead just kept
growing. Two free throws from se
nior center Heather Owen gave
Stanford a 28-point lead (its largest
of the game) with 4:22 to play.
"That's the difference between a
top-five team and a team that's
building." Turner Thorne said.
"We don't quite have that mentali
ty yet of 'OK. let's crank it up; let's
win the game.' "
While Stanford was cranking it
up. the Sun Devils' shooting fell by
the wayside. Stanford's defense
held Arizona State to just 27.3 per
cent in the second half, while the
Card's 56.5 percent was good
enough to pace its percentage for

the game to a season-high 62.5.
"1 thought we had a much better
effort in the second half," Van-
Derveer said. "It's to Arizona
State's credit that they came out
with a good game plan. 1 thought in
the first half they controlled the
tempo of the game."
Arizona State's Freeman led all
scorers with IS, while Stanford
shared the wealth in the scoring col
umn. The Card placed five players
in double figures with Folkl's 16 fol
lowed by 15 from Scott. Sophomore
guard Milena Flores added 14, se
nior forward Vanessa Nygaard 13
and sophomore guard Melody Pe
terson 11.
Up next for Stanford is a re
match against No. 7 Arizona, 67-57
winners over California last night.
The Wildcats were the last team to
defeat the Card, ending Stanford's
48-game Pac-10 win streak with a
91-90 victory in the McKale Center.
A win Saturday at 1 p.m. against
Arizona would clinch a tie for Stan
ford's ninth conference crown and
send the seniors away victorious in
their last regular-season home
game at Maples.
"Definitely it's a big game," Flo
res said. "But every next game is
our biggest game. We could clinch a
tie for (the) Pac-10 (title), so that
makes it important for us, and re
venge is always sweet."
