"()ur future realK depended on
the maturation of our guards." said
Stanford head coach lara Yan-

post rotation, and I think both of
those happened "
While the win over the

Sun Devils (10-14.6-9) was discon

court provided some salvageable
things in a game considered a
warm up act to Senior Day. Flores
finished with 14 points and six as
sists while Peterson added 11 points
to go with her three assists.
Stanford turned the ball over
three times in its first four offensive
possessions before junior guard
Regan Freuen helped ignite the of

Cardinal shot a sizzling b8 percent

strong first half, although turnovers
were still a concern
"We've got a shot" at a national
title. VanDerveer said. "But the
one thing that is really holding
back is our turnovers."

the season when those passes would
end up in the fourth row and result in
an earful from VanDerveer. They
were also taking charge with some
aggressive slashing drives that
helped put the game out of reach.
"We've gotten outstanding play
from Milena — she is really stepping
up as a point guard," VanDerveer
said. "Quite honestly, she's one of
the premier point guards in the coun
try.
"The question mark lately has
been at the two-guard spot. Tonight,
I was happy with how Melody came
in and did a nice job for us. We actu
ally went to a three-guard lineup for
a little bit, which is not something I'm
very fond of."
The guard play has been without
a doubt the biggest improvement as
the team went from a 2-4, close-to
falling-out-of-the-rankings outfit to a
squad that has rattled off 16 wins in
the last 17 contests. The parallels be
tween 1992 and this year are starting
to become eerily similar, although
the national championship squad
started out 10-0.
"That team had a lot of the same
question marks that this team has,"
VanDerveer said. "We had fresh
man posts coming in behind Val
(Whiting] and we had junior guard
Molly Goodenbour, who improved a
lot and gained a lot of confidence.
She and Milena remind me a lot of
each other in that they're great tran
sition guards and excellent scorers."
While everyone knows how 1992
ended, it still remains to be seen if
history will repeat itself.
