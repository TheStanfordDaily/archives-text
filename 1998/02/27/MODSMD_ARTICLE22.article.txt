coach Mark Marquess.

Picked to finish a close second behind Stan
ford in the IWB Pac-10 coaches' preseason
poll, the Sun Devils enter tonight's opener
with an impressive record, formidable stats
and an effeeti\e squad.
l he sheer might of junior Andrew Rein
brink anchors the Sun Devil infield from third
base, lhe foot-3 infielder leads Arizona
State with sixdoublcs. two triplcsand 24 RBls,
and he has batted safely in 11 of the last 12
games.
Sun Devil sophomore Willie Bloomquist.
termed "the hit man." has started the season
on a tear. I he infielder outfielder is batting
44f> and leads the talented squad in hits (25).
runs scored (W). stolen bases (S) and walks
(17).
l he true Sun Devil power, however, resides
with its pitching squad, especially the one-two
punch of junior lefties R\an Mills and Phil I

Lowery. Mills and Lowery have combined for
mx wins and a 2.21 ERA.
Mills pitched 17 consecutive scoreless in
nines for the Sun Devils before allowing a run,
and he sports an incredible 1.83 IR A through
five starts I owerv is hot on Mills' heels with a
2.57 ERA
Marquess expects the Sun Devils' celebrat
ed pitching duo will present a challenge for the
hard-hitting Cardinal.
"We've been playing ver\ well offensively."
Marquess said "Now whether we can continue
to swing well against two quality pitchers like
Mills and Lowery" remains to be seen.
Stanford exploded offensively last weekend
against No. 14 UCLA, including Cardinal
sophomore left fielder Edmund Muth s Satur
day outing, in which he hit for the cycle.
The Cardinal has now scored 10 or more
runs in seven of its 14 games.
The Cardinal's pitching squad has wasted
no time racking up its own honors this season.
Hailed as possessing one of the country's best
rotations. Stanford was the only team in the
nation to open the season with all three start-
ing pitchers on preseason Ail-
American teams.
Junior ace hurler Jeff Austin
(4-0) opens for the Cardinal
tonight.
The right-hander holds a life
time 15-6 record and an impres
sive 3.61 ERA. Last Friday
against the Bruins. Austin al
lowed just one earned run and
eight hits over eight innings.
Two-sport standout Chad
Hutchinson is scheduled to open

for the Cardinal on Saturday.
The junior right-hander ap
pears to be fulfilling his preseason
desire to perform up to his much
hyped potential. Hutchinson tal
lied a rain-shortened, five-inning
no-hitter in a 4-0 victory at Fresno
State on Feb. 1 He threw 63
pitches, including 34 strikes, and
allowed only one ball out of the
infield. The no-hitter against the
Bulldogswas the eighth in Stan
ford's history.
Junior lefty Brent Hoard (1-0)
will likely get the nod Sunday
against an undetermined Sun
Devil starter.
