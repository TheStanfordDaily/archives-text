The Stanford men's and women's track and field
teams have arrived at the finish line of their indoor sea
son and are looking to come home as victors. Their
final indoor meet, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa

throughout the weekend.
The Stanford teams sent their finest members in an
effort to repeat, if not surpass, last year's success. The
women's team hopes to once again claim first place,
which would be the culmination of a spectacular sea
son.
