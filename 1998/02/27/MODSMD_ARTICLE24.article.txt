### Molly Brizgys Contributing writer 
It's crunch time and the Stanford
women's gymnastics team is more
than ready.
The Cardinal (6-3. 2-3 Pacific 10
Conference) meets the Oregon
State Beavers (7-2, 3-2) tonight at 7
p.m. in Gill Coliseum — the first of
its final three big meets on the road
to the NCAAs, which begin April
18.
The competition promises to be
an exciting one as Stanford is ranked
15th in the nation while Oregon
State is ranked 11th.
"Right now. we're the strongest
we've been all season," said head
coach Mark Cook. "We're 90 per

cent there health-wise — now we're
making minor changes to squeeze all
we can out of the program."

gon State (7-2,3-2), 7 p.m.
Cook and assistant coach Rene
Lyst had the opportunity to watch
the Beavers compete last week at
UCLA. Both were confident that
Stanford was the better team, al
though both Oregon State and Stan
ford have almost identical team
score averages of around 193 points.
Oregon State is currently
strongest on bars and beam while

Stanford shines on bars and floor.
Cook thinks the meet will come
down to who can hit their beam rou
tines. Last week the Card had prob
lems on beam as four gymnasts fell.
An intense week of conditioning and
spirit building will hopefully allevi
ate the problems.
The Beavers feature four return
ing Ail-Americans and are led by
sophomore Megan Murphy, junior
Deanne Droegumeller (a two-time
All-American) and junior Amy
Slack.
"They have three really competi
tive kids," Cook said." But our depth
is much stronger."
However, the Beavers cannot be

taken lightly, and Cook has com
posed his toughest lineup to date.
After this week, the lineup will
probably stay the same so the team
can build rhythm, camaraderie and
confidence within the event sub
groups that will carry over to next
month when the team goes to Pac
l()s.
"Things are starting to pick up
again, and we're coming together as
a team more and more," said junior
co-captain Amy Murakami. "At the
big meets you realize how much you
rely on each other."
Murakami will head the all
around after taking a brief rest from
vault and bars last week when Stan
ford beat California. Second-team
All-American Larissa Fontaine will
also compete in all events and is ex
pected to lead the Cardinal in vault
and bars.
Last week, Fontaine scored a
on both vault and bars, winning
both events, and hopefully will ris
to the occasion again this wee v.
Fontaine will again use a round >ft
entry vault, the "Yurchenko,"

adding variety and confidence to the
vault team. She is the only Stanford
gymnast to use the Yurchenko.
"This is crunch time, and we
need to start nailing things down,"
Fontaine said. "It's close to the end
of the season, and intensity and pur
pose really sets in. We are all up to
the challenge."
Senior co-captain Keri Monahan
will not compete in the all-around
this week because she is nursing a
hurt shoulder. Cook thinks the bars
group is deep enough that the loss of
Monahan won't pose too big a prob
lem.
Instead. Monahan will focus on
her vault, which Cook said has been
"phenomenal." and her floor rou
tine. Monahan may even perform
her full-out tumbling pass on floor
tonight.
Freshman Jennifer Exaltacion
will perform on the bars and beam
again and sophomore Sarah Hard
ing. coming off two huge finishes
last week, will perform on the bars
and floor.
"The team is really maturing."
Cook said. "They are making sacri
fices for the team concept — a con
cept and ideology that will take us to
nationals."
