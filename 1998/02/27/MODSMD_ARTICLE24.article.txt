It's crunch time and the Stanford
women's gymnastics team is more
than ready.
The Cardinal (6-3. 2-3 Pacific 10
Conference) meets the Oregon
State Beavers (7-2, 3-2) tonight at 7
p.m. in Gill Coliseum — the first of
its final three big meets on the road
to the NCAAs, which begin April
18.
The competition promises to be
an exciting one as Stanford is ranked
15th in the nation while Oregon
State is ranked 11th.
"Right now. we're the strongest
we've been all season," said head
coach Mark Cook. "We're 90 per

cent there health-wise — now we're

we can out of the program."

Oregon State is currently
strongest on bars and beam while

Stanford shines on bars and floor.
Cook thinks the meet will come
down to who can hit their beam rou
tines. Last week the Card had prob

An intense week of conditioning and
spirit building will hopefully allevi
ate the problems.
The Beavers feature four return
ing Ail-Americans and are led by
sophomore Megan Murphy, junior
Deanne Droegumeller (a two-time
All-American) and junior Amy
Slack.
"They have three really competi
tive kids," Cook said." But our depth
is much stronger."
