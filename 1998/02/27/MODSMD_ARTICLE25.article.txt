### John Sullivan Staff writer 
After heating three ranked
teams in its first seven games, Stan
ford Softball earned its first top-25
ranking ever Wednesday. Ihe
NFCA/USA Today coaches poll
put the Card in the No. 17 spot.
"I'm excited for our players,"
said coach John Rittman. "They
have worked extremely hard, and
it's nice to get some recognition.
However, while we're pleased,
we're definitely not satisfied."
Stanford (6-1) travels to Fuller
ton to compete in the Cal State-
Fullerton Showcase Tournament
beginning today. The three-day
round-robin tourney attracts teams
from around the country.
The Card will meet the No. 13
Long Beach State 49ers today. East
ern Michigan and Virginia tomor
row. and the 49ers (7-3) and host 11
taos Sundays
"We expect that teams will come
out harder against us now that we're
ranked," said junior outfielder Kelly
Yablonski. " Though rankings don't
mean too much overall, teams will
nonetheless be gunning for us."
Last weekend, the Card relied on
solid pitching and quality defense to
finish third in the Campbell / Cartier
Softball Classic. Stanford will have
to continue its strong pitching and
clean defense to continue its success.
Junior shortstop Michele Schnei
der put on a hitting clinic in San

Diego last weekend, going 10 for 18
at the plate with a .889 slugging per
centage. The slugger leads the team
in hits with 13. doubles with four,
home runs with one and batting av
erage with .591.

"Our offense will always score
some runs." Rittman said. "Thus, if
our defense doesn't make mistakes,
we have the ability to bounce back
quite well."
The Card begins the tourney
squaring off against what should be
its toughest opponent in Long
Beach State. Last weekend. Stan
ford defeated the 49ers 3-1 in a game
in which Stanford held on to a one
run lead until the final inning.
The 49ers will look to avenge
their loss against the Card, who sur
prised them last weekend. However,
it seems unlikeh that Long Beach
will overlook the No. 17 Card this
time.
"Long Beach is very aggressive at
the plate." Rittman said. "They

don't beat themselves: their pitchers
and defense keep them in every
game so that the offense can take
care of business."
The Card will put junior Marcy
Crouch on the mound to do battle
against the 49ers' impressive lineup.
Last weekend. Crouch dominated
the 49ers. striking out seven w hilc al
lowing onl\ five hits.
The ke\ to C rouch's success last
weekend was her ability to keep the
44ers off balance at the plate b\
changing speeds frequently and
switching up her pitches effectively.
Louisiana State handed the Care
its first loss of the season last week
end. Mental mistakes and miscom
munication enabled LSI' to scort
eas\ runs The Card also failed U
capitalize on scoring
earh in the game.
"The LSI game has enabled us
to learn a lot." Crouch said. "We
know thai we cannot strand runners
on hast cj«rl\ it we want to win We
had several opportunities to put the
game away early, but were unable
to."
Against UCLA and LSI . the
Card demonstrated its ability to bat
tle back from earh deficits. The Bru
ins got up 5-oon the Card, but Stan
ford battled back for a 7-6 victory.
Against LSI . the comeback was im
pressive but not as heroic.
Stanford's resilience has been
one of its best assets this season. It
will be put to the test once again this
weekend.
