WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ Tomorrow-Sunday: No. 3 Stanford (5-1) at UC-
Santa Barbara tournament.
Nine out of the top 10 teams will be at the tour
nament beginning tomorrow at IJC'-Santa Bar
bara, including the No. 1 and No. 2 teams, UCLA
and California, respectively, ;is well as the No. 4
Gauchos. Stanford (5-1) is currently ranked third
in the nation.
"I was very pleased with our depth on Sunday,"
said Stanford head coach John Tanner. "We had 14
people who played a fair amount in the game
against Davis. Davis got tired and we were able to
put the game away with two goals in the fourth
quarter."
That depth will be a huge asset to Stanford this
weekend. The fact that the team has so many
strong players helps it run a tight defense through
out the game.
"Everyone was really solid on defense," Tanner
said.
Sophomore Heather Crary agreed,
"When we were running the drop defense and
communicating, it worked really well." Crary said.
As Stanford's defense has been successful so
far, the team has been concentrating on its offen
sive strategy this week in preparation for the Santa
Barbara tournament.
"We've worked a lot on our counterattack,"
Tanner said. "But it's still early in the season, so
we're also still doing a lot of skill work."
Sophomore Ellen Estes pointed out Stanford's
strengths on offense.
"One of the key aspects of our offense is move
ment." Estes said. "We're working on driving
through and trying to get our passes through."

Stanford's offense looked g<x>d last Sunday.
The Cardinal racked up 14 points in the game
against the Davis B team, nine points in the game
against Davis A and IK points against IJC-Santa
( ru/. The defense allowed no more than four goals
in each game. If Stanford can keep up its scoring
streak with a strong offense and effective counter-

attack, the team should be able to give IJCLA and
(. al a run for their money.
I"he Card opens the tournament with a game
against ( laremont (ollege tomorrow at 10:20 a.m.
If Stanford wins, it plays in the quarterfinals at 3
p.m. The semifinal and championship games are
both Sunday.
