## That Guy I'm That Guy 
### 
Hi there. It's nice to meet you.
Allow me to introduce myself. I'm
that guy. What guy, you ask? Well, I'm
that guy who does the terrible things
to money, for one thing.
When people point at your money
and say, "Money is so dirty! Do you
know where that's been?" 1 make
money dirty. You don't want to know
the kinds of things I do to money. I'm
that guy.
I'm that guy with all the college
stickers on my car's rear window. I
didn't attend any of those colleges. I
just like the stickers.
I'm that guy who says, "Funny, I
didn't know they HAD food in
Ethiopia!" every time I walk past an
Ethiopian restaurant.
I'm that guy. That guy who rips

Absolut ads out of magazines and puts
them up on the walls. You know why?
Because they look cool, and I like to
drink alcohol. I'm that guy. Also, I'm
that guy with the "Pulp Fiction"
poster on his wall.
I'm that guy who thought that
"Lane Bike" and "Ahead Stop" were
easier to read than "Stop Ahead" and
"Bike Lane." When you get into the
elevator, I say, "What floor?" and
press the buttons for you.
I'm that guy who touches art and
gets too close to the elk at Yellow
stone. When the roads close because
someone ran over a cow, that was me.
And that was my cow.
I'm that guy. That guy who still
laughs at the jokes from the movie
trailer when I actually go see the

movie, even though I've seen the trail
er 40 times. I mean, that shit is funny!
Then, in the silence after everyone
finishes laughing, I contentedly sigh,
"Aaaaahhhh."
I'm that guy who stuck his arm out
of the school bus window and got it
ripped off when he was a kid. Now I
only have one arm, but it doesn't
make me any less that guy. 1 don't
have a prosthetic arm; I have a metal
hook. I'm that guy.
I'm that guy. It's not easy being
that guy. I know the name of every
person who works behind the counter
of every convenience store. 1 say,
"Hey Bob, the usual!" and feel big.
When there's a flood, I'm the one who
uses something unusual and eye
catching for a raft.

I'm that guy: on the news, there's
a road accident, 30 people dead. The
reporter calls it the worst tragedy to
strike America's roads in the past 10
years. Someone peers over his shoul
der, waves at the camera, then walks
on. I'm that guy. Hey, I'm on the TV!
Boy, I can't wait to get home and
watch myself.
I'm that guy. The only jokes I
know arc quotes from "Monty Python
and the Holy Grail." The more I quote
that movie, the funnier 1 am.
I'm that guy who plays "Closer to
Fine" on my acoustic guitar in my
room, but with my door partially
open. Oh, you can hear that all the
way down the hall? Sorry. No, that's
cool. I'll close it.
I'm that guy. That guy with the

dreamcatcher.
I'm that guy walking straight
towards you. When you move to the
side, I move to the same side, then you
move to the other side, and so do I,
and I make "uh, uh" noises. I love
being that guy.
I'm that guy who leaves one plaid
suitcase on the airport luggage
carousel early in the morning and
picks it up late at night. Sometimes it's
in a plastic bin for no reason. Well, no
reason you'd understand.
I'm that guy.

I'm that guy. / write things in this space
that makes the writer of the previous prose
look funny and hip. I say things like, "That
guy is a sophomore ami believes in free
love because he doesn t think you should
have to pay for it. " I'm that guy.
