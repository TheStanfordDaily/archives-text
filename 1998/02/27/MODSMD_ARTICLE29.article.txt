# Nobody gives a damn

Yesterday, something pretty
important happened. As usual,
though, no one gave a damn.
All of us here were sitting and
drinking Boont beer when it hap
pened. 1 was ordering pizza for the
staff when the news came in. It
seemed pretty interesting, but you
know, whatever.

I think it had something to do
with the president.
Maybe he killed a guy or
something. I don't know.
But then someone, I think it
was Antonio, said something really
funny. This made milk shoot out of
Portia's nose. And we all laughed
until milk shot out of our congested
noses.
God damn it, Antonio's a
funny guy!
