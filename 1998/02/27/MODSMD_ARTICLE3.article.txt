## 2,900 to attend weekend events 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
A record 2.parents will arrive
for Parents' Weekend today and to
morrow. hut none of them will need
a Secret Service escort.
Parents' Weekend will have to go
on without the Clintons, who had
originally planned to he on campus
this weekend to visit their daughter
Chelsea, a freshman. Instead, they
will be skiing in Utah.
" This makes things a lot easier on
us," said Chief of Police Marv Her
rington. "A lot fewer people will
have to work, and we don't have to
worry about motorcades and things
like that."
Despite President Clinton's ab
sence. a protest against U.S. policy
in Iraq will still be staged before
University President Gerharc
Casper's 3 p.m. meeting with par
ents at Maples Pavilion. The demon
stration. which had originally beer
planned around the arrival of Clin

ton and the national news media,
will voice support for the U.N. set
tlement with Iraq and oppose U.S.
sanctions against Iraq and U.S. mili
tary presence in the Persian Gulf.
"I think and hope that the group
that's protesting realizes that this is a
special weekend for the parents,"
Hernngtonsaid "[Thepolice] won't
interfere as long as people don't try
to block the lecture."
A thousand more parents are ex
pected to arrive this year, said Cyn
thia Gori. a University communica
tions associate.
Herrington's biggest worry is the
coordination and transportation of
so many people.
"Our main concern is just to be
sure that people get w here they need
to go without clogging up the cam
pus," Hernngton said
"The protesters will add another
interesting element to the mix." he
added.
In addition to Casper's address,
parents may attend lectures, recep
tions and classes given by 21 Sum
lord faculty and staff members.
"For me, the classes are the high
light of Parents' Weekend, because
you have two opportunities to see

what your children are learning,"
said Stanford Parents' Club Presi
dent Carol knowlcs.
Classes range from a lecture on
national security by Institute for In
ternational Studies Prof, and former
Secretary of Defense William Perry
to a college football tutorial by Stan
lord head football coach Tyrone
Willingham.
There will also be the usual

round of backward-walking tour
guides showing off various parts of
campus to parents. Tour subjects in
clude the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center. Memorial Church and a
sampling of Stanford's sculptures.
Because of the high number of
parents scheduled to attend, classes
and panels will not be open it) stu
dents. except for any who registered
previously.
