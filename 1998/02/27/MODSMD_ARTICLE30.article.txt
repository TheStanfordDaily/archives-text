## Some films are best left unseen 
### 
The futuristic "Class of 1999"
(1989) is undoubtedly the most
important film since "Class of
1984" (1982). Like "Citizen
Kane," the film garnered little
attention on its initial release
but now seems poised to be redis
covered as a masterpiece of the
late '80s.
In a world gone mad, where
gangs run schools and there is
no law, Kennedy High School
decides to employ cyborg teach
ers. Surprisingly, things go
wrong when the robots start
killing their students.

It turns out that the teachers
are, in fact, reprogrammed battle droids. The masterful
script barely gives you time to recover from this shock
before revealing that the PE teacher has a rocket
launcher underneath his hand, and the chemistry teach
er (excellently portrayed by Pam Grier) has a flame
thrower attachment. The history teacher rips off his arm
to reveal a three-pronged grappling hook, which he sen
sibly uses to crush people's heads. It is left to the students,
armed only with futuristic grenades and automatic rifles,
to battle against the droids' superweapons.
Director and writer Mark L. Lester exposes the inher
ent violence of the schooling system. Consider the fol
lowing exchange between the principal, Dr. Miles Long
ford (Malcolm McDowell), and the sinister albino owner
of Megatech Robotics, Dr. Forrest (Stanley Keach):
Principal: "I see, you mean you programmed these
droids to wage war against my students?"
Forrest: "But isn't that what all teachers do?"
Principal: "That's not teaching. That's just a choice:
learn or die."


Out of 100 percent of Ken
neth Starr's face, "Class of
/ W9" gets a resounding 75
percent.
