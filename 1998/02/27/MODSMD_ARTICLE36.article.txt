# Volleyball hopes for rebound
## 
### Michacla Crouch Contributing writer 
Following two tough losses last weekend, the defend
ing national champion Stanford men's volleyball team
goes on the road this weekend in an effort to stay in the
hunt for first place in their division.
The seventh-ranked Cardinal (7-2,6-2 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) will play at fifth-ranked Long
Beach State (9-3,3-3 MPSF) tonight before a Saturday
night matchup at USC (4-9,2-8 MPSF).
While Stanford currently stands in second place in
the Pacific Division of the MPSF, victories this weekend
would keep the Cardinal in line to regain first place over
fourth-ranked Hawaii. While the top three teams in the
Pacific Division will all advance to the MPSF playoffs,
that No. 1 spot holds some distinct advantages.

MEN'S VOLLEYBALL

■ Tonight: No. 7 Stanford (7-2, 6-2 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) at No. 5 Long Beach State (9-3,3-3),
7:30 p.m.
■ Tomorrow: Stanford at USC (4-9,2-8), 7 p.m.

"II we finish first, we will get to play at home," said
Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves, "and will likely
avoid the big three — UCLA. Pepperdine and BYU —
in the first round."
Tonight's match will be Long Beach State's first in a
week. The 4 l )ers are coming off a two-game series that
they split with the Rainbows. In the second match of that
series, a Long Beach State victory, five 49er players post
ed double digits in the kill category. Freshman outside
hitter Jim Polster led all hitters with 27.
Polster is just one example of the 49ers' young talent
at the outside hitter position. With the influx of new tal
ent to the lineup, some veteran members of the Long
Beach State roster, although very talented players, no
longer see playing time.
"They are probably the deepest team at outside hit
ter in our league," Nieves said. "They have four or five
players beyond their starting three outside hitters who
are very good."
This depth allows the 49ers to change their lineup fre
quently. so Stanford will not be completely sure who
they will see on the court until game time.
Although the 49ers will likely start several young
players, the Cardinal will have to contend with one no
table veteran, middle blocker Gaby Amar. The All-
American Amar ranks in the top 10 nationally in both
blocking and service ace averages.
While IJSC is not a team likely to make the MPSF
playoffs, the match is still an important one for the Car
dinal. Last year, the Trojans pulled off an upset victory
when Stanford traveled to North Gym. Both Hawaii and
Long Beach State, Stanford's main contenders for the
coveted Pacific Division top spot, have already defeated
the Trojans this season, and Stanford cannot afford to
fall behind.
USC is another MPSF team wrought with young tal
ent. as eight of the 15 players on the Trojan roster as well
as three of the six starters are freshmen.
"USC has struggled primarily because they are
young," Nieves said.
The Trojans have also been forced to contend with a
void at the outside hitter position due to a transfer of one
of the best players in the country. Fortunately for the
Cardinal, USC's loss was a Stanford gain. Gabe Gardner
transferred from USC and is spending this season as a
Cardinal redshirt.
While last weekend was a detrimental one for Stan

ford's record, several Cardinal players made moves up
the national rankings. Senior middle blocker Keenan
Whitehurst is now the nation's leader in hitting percent
age, with .580, while sophomore outside hitter Andy
Witt now ranks in the second position in kill average,
with 7.3. Witt's move came following a phenomenal 51-
kill performance in last Saturday's match against Loyola
Marymount. Freshman setter Josh Lukens also tops the
national standings. Lukens leads the assists category, av
eraging 18.8 assists per game.
After last weekend's disappointments. Stanford
hopes to have stronger matches this weekend in the key
area of point scoring. While the Cardinal is strong in the
areas of serving, blocking and digging, Stanford had
trouble last weekend converting those strengths into
points.
"Our players have been determined to work at that
this week in practice," Nieves said, "and we hope to see
results this weekend."
