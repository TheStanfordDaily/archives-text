# Tree campaign issue resolved
## No tipi in White Plaza 
### Ann kim Staff writer 
A candidate hoping to become
the next Tree mascot will no
longer use symbols of the Native
American community, including a
tipi, in his campaign. He vmII hold a
press conference at noon in White
Plaza to formally announce his de
cision.
Students gathered in the Native
American Cultural Center at 7
p.m. yesterday to listen to each
other's views on freshman Neal
Ormond's plan to set up a tipi in
White Plaza as part of his Tree
campaign.
Ormond had planned to "live as
the Indian" so that he could be
come the Tree, just as Stanford's
mascot was once the Indian and is
now the Tree. After the discussion,
however, he agreed to change that
aspect of his campaign.

About 30 people participated ir
the discussion, including Ormond
Dean of Students Marc Wais and
leaders of a number of ethnic com
munities.
"We want to allow people in the
community to voice why this may
be problematic." said senior An
gela Parker, co-chair of the Stan
ford American Indian Organiza
tion.
It was agreed that those who
objected to his plan would assist
him in brainstorming new ideas tor
his campaign.
"I think the night definitely
started off tense." Parker said
"But [Ormond's] maturity and
willingness to listen to us shows a
lot about him
"I'm happ\ that he decided
this." Parker said.
At the start of the discussion
many participants expressed disap
proval of Ormond's campaign
strategy, stating that it would be
personally offensive and painful to
see an important aspect of Native
American heritage and culture
trivialized.
The atmosphere of the room
was emotional and tense, but al
ways remained positive, with all
participants actively listening to
one another and responding to
each other's concerns.
Ormond's original campaign
mission statement was, "Just as our
mascot was once the Indian and is
now the Tree, so too shall I, for five
days and five nights, live as the In
dian that I may become the Tree."
Stanford's mascot was changed
from the Indian to the Tree in
1971.
Ormond explained that he had
put much thought and work into his
campaign, and that he had hoped to
link the past and the present by
tying in Stanford's history.
He said that in addition to the
usual Tree candidate antics, he had
hoped to add an "intellectual as
pect" to his campaign.
"I'm paralleling the history of
the Stanford mascot with my cam
paign," he said.
He emphasized that his plans
were not an attempt to "revive,
proliferate or promote" the past
use of the Indian as Stanford's mas
cot.
"By bringing up that past, by

bringing up the negative things that
this community has had to deal
with, you are bringing back the
shame and pain," said Ahtza
Chavez. "It was part of the past and
that's why it's in the past."
"What do you know about the
tipi?" asked freshman Moroni Be
nally. "The home is a sacred place."
Benally said that placing a tipi in
White Plaza would be "a mockery
of my culture."
Ormond acknowledged that he
was aware of the offensive nature
of his use of a tipi. but explained
that it was very late in the campaign
for him to be making changes.
"If I had known earlier, I
would've changed the plans," he
said.
Parker challenged Ormond, say
ing. "You've heard that people are
offended, and that it's a mockery,
yet you're maintaining your course
of action." She asked him to legit
imize this.
"Regardless of your intentions,
what you're doing is hurtful," Park
er said.
Freshman Patrick Lewis-Jose
said, "It becoming Tree is impor
tant to you. using this approach is
detrimental to you."
"Is my humanity so arbitrary to
you? Is that something you can play
with?" asked junior Dwayne Mar
tine.
Wais warned Ormond to seri
ously consider the implications of
his actions for all of the Stanford
community.
Wais pointed out that Ormond
had not yet set up his tipi.
" This is really an opportunity: a

lot of people don't have the chance
to right a wrong," he said.
" This community is giving you
an opportunity to take corrective
action."
Ormond asked if there was any
way he could make reference to
Native Americans in his campaign
without it being offensive.
"I think any reference at all
would be offensive," said sopho
more Elly Matsumura.
"There's no way to generalize
without offending people," said
freshman Cutcha Baldy, who ex
plained that not all Native Ameri
can tribes, such as her own. live in
tipis.
Benally also noted that the T
shirts Ormond had made for his
campaign featured two images of
the old Stanford Indian mascot,
and he was disturbed when he saw
somebody wearing one of the
shirts.
Ormond, after listening to the
discussion, said that two issues
were important for him: letting the
Tree voters know what had hap
pened with his campaign and his
last-minute change, and receiving
the support of those present at the
meeting in making a change.
The meeting participants ex
pressed a general agreement that
they would work with Ormond dur
ing the night to change his cam
paign, as well as notify the Tree
voters of what occurred last night.
After hearing this, Ormond
agreed not to use his tipi or make
any reference to the old Stanford
mascot.
The room broke into applause.
