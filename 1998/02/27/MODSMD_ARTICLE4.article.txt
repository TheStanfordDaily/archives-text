## No tipi in White Plaza 
### Ann kim Staff writer 
A candidate hoping to become
the next Tree mascot will no
longer use symbols of the Native
American community, including a
tipi, in his campaign. He vmII hold a
press conference at noon in White
Plaza to formally announce his de
cision.
Students gathered in the Native
American Cultural Center at 7
p.m. yesterday to listen to each
other's views on freshman Neal
Ormond's plan to set up a tipi in
White Plaza as part of his Tree
campaign.
Ormond had planned to "live as
the Indian" so that he could be
come the Tree, just as Stanford's
mascot was once the Indian and is
now the Tree. After the discussion,
however, he agreed to change that
aspect of his campaign.

About 30 people participated ir
the discussion, including Ormond
Dean of Students Marc Wais and
leaders of a number of ethnic com
munities.
"We want to allow people in the
community to voice why this may
be problematic." said senior An
gela Parker, co-chair of the Stan
ford American Indian Organiza
tion.
It was agreed that those who
objected to his plan would assist
him in brainstorming new ideas tor
his campaign.
"I think the night definitely
started off tense." Parker said
"But [Ormond's] maturity and
willingness to listen to us shows a
lot about him
"I'm happ\ that he decided
this." Parker said.
