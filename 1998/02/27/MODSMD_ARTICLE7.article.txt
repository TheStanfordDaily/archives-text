## Winfrey wins over Texas cattlemen Jury rejects lawsuit 
### 
AMARILLO, Texas (AP)
Oprah Winfrey made ground
meat of Big Beef in the heart of
Texas cattle country yesterday.
"Free speech not only lives. It
rocks!" Winfrey proclaimed out
side the courthouse to cheering
townspeople, many sipping cham
pagne, after a jury rejected an $11
million lawsuit brought against her
by a group of Texas cattlemen.
The cattlemen blamed a col
lapse in cattle prices on a 19%
"Oprah Winfrey Show" that they
said falsely warned American beef
could spread mad-cow disease to
people.
Winfrey hailed the verdict as a
victory for the First Amendment,
and a triumph for blacks. "I come
from a people who struggled and
died to use their voice in this coun
try and I refuse to be muzzled,"
she said.
The cattlemen's lawyer said the
jurors clearly were swayed by
Winfrey's star power.
Winfrey's arrival here was the
biggest thing to happen to Amaril
lo in years. People waited in long
lines to hear her testify, and fought
for tickets to tapings of her show,
which was moved from Chicago to
Amarillo during the trial. By the
end of the five-week trial, buttons,
banners, caps and T-shirts pro
claiming "Amarillo Loves Oprah"
were everywhere.
"You'd have to be blind to say
(jurors) weren't influenced by one
of the 25 most influential Ameri
cans," said cattlemen's attorney
Joe Coyne, referring to a 1996
Time magazine article. He said the
cattlemen will appeal.
Juror Pat Ciowdv said delibera
tions turned on the First Amend
ment. "We felt that a lot of riuhts

have eroded in this country. Our
freedom of speech may be the
only one we have left to regain
what we've lost," he said.
The verdict came in red meat
country, where 25 percent of the
nation's grain-fed cattle is pro
duced. where the city's biggest pri
vate employer is a slaughterhouse,
and where the "World Famous"

Big Texan Steak Raneh offers a
72-ounce steak free to anyone who
can wolf it down in an hour. Even
the courthouse had a mural of cat
tle above the elevators.
"I was scared to come here at
first." Winfrey sakl. "I saw where
there were bumper stickers that
said, 'The only mad cow in Texas
is Oprah.' That hurt my feelings."
