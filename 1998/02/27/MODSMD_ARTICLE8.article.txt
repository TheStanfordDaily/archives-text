Britain and the United States
pressed other permanent members
of the Security Council yesterday to
back a resolution that packs a blunt
warning to Iraq: Break a promise to
open sensitive sights to arms inspec
tion and face the "severest conse
quences."
China. France and Russia are
wary of words that could lead to a
military strike against Iraq, and it
wasn't clear they could be persuad
ed to accept the tough language.
While diplomats struggled to
agree on the wording, U.N. Secrc
tary-General Kofi Annan defended
the accord he elicited last weekend
from Saddam Hussein in Baghdad.
Republicans in Congress have criti
cized it. with Sen. Jesse Helms say
ing Annan "gave away the store."
Chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler rejected speculation
that his authority would be under
mined by the deal, which calls for
diplomats to accompany inspectors
on their visits.
Butler said his IJ.N. Special
Commission, or UNSCOM. would
still be in charge of the inspections
and the scientific analysis.
"What's different? We'll have
some diplomatic observers with us

to make sure that both sides â€” not
just IJNSCOM hut Iraq, too -
behave in an appropriate manner in
these special sites," Butler said. "I
think that's tine."
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richard
son said he was pleased Butler's
team would remain in charge, a key
demand of the United States. But
ler will continue to report through
the secretary-general to the Securi
ty Council.
The diplomats will accompany
U.N. inspectors into the eight presi
dential palaces at the heart of the
latest crisis. Iraq had refused to
allow inspectors into the sites,
claiming that would violate Iraq's
sovereignty.
The inspectors must certify Iraq
has eliminated all its weapons ot
mass destruction before the Securi
ty Council will lift tough economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq invad
ed Kuwait, sparking the IWI Per
sian (iulf War.
Any Iraqi failure to piovide
weapons experts "immediate
unconditional and unrestricted
access to the sites they wish to
inspect would, according to the
draft Security Council resolution,
"have the severest consequences
for Iraq."
