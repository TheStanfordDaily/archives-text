If a major disaster strikes your home, we promise to be
there for you. But now, we need your help, before a real
disaster leaves someone helpless.
The real disaster would be if the Red Cross could not
be there to help.
This year, the Red Cross faces a financial crisis in
the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund. We helped so many
families in the last two years. We must look to you for
financial support —now. Please help.
