Pollen from grasses, weeds, and

mine, cut down the allergic
reaction, dry up a runny nose,
and stop itching. Some tips:
■ If you can predict vour expo
sure, take them ahead of time
■ May have side effects (e.g., drv
mouth, drowsiness, reduced
a >gni ti ve performa nee)
■ Read ingredients on labels
(single ingredient ones are
usually best), or ask phar
macists what they suggest
■ Try many to find what works
for you
■ Nasalcrom nasal spray may
be a good alternative
Decongestants
These constrict the blood ves
sels and cut down on secretions.
Here's some tips:
■ Avoid nasal spray decon
gestants
■ Oral decongestants (e.g.,
Sudafed) may keep you
awake or make you drowsy
■ If you have problems with
high blood pressure or
rapid heart rate, consult an
M.D. before taking
Talk to a Doctor
■ If your allergies do not
respond to antihistamines
■ If the over-the-counter anti
histamines work, but they
cause drowsiness
Note: Prescription drugs may
not cause drowsiness, but they
are much more expensive
Medical Emergencies
If you have a severe allergic
reaction - hives or wheezing,
difficulty breathing, tightening
throat, swelling in lips, tongue,
or face (e.g., after an insect sting,
a certain drug, or food) go to
