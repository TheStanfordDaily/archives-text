STANFORD PRESIDENTIAL LECTURES AND SYMPOSIA IN THE HUMANITIES AND ARTS
Inaugural lecture and book signing with CHRISTO & JEANNE-CLAUDE
To be held at Annenberg Auditorium, Cummlngs Art Building.
Stanford University presents the Presidential Lectures and Symposia in the Humanities and Arts. The inaugural lecture will feature
environmental artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude, with a book signing to follow sponsored by Stanford Bookstore. They will dis
cuss their two works in progress. The Gates, Pro|ect for Central Park, New York City and Over the River, Project for the
Arkansas River, Colorado. On Tuesday, March 3,1998 at 10:00 AM a panel discussion will be held in the Newhall Room (L109)
in the Littlefield Building. The artistic team of Christo and Jeanne-Claude have produced some of the 20th century's most unique
works of art. Their innovative utilization of fabrics in pieces such as the Running Fence and most recently The Wrapped
Reichstag defy traditional approaches to materials and means of artistic production. Requiring collaborative efforts on a scale
without precedent in contemporary art, their projects engage not only the artists themselves, but also their production teams, the
workers who construct the final realizations, legislative bodies and planning agencies, and perhaps most importantly, the public.
The lecture is free and open to the public.
