# Iraq protestors rally in front of parents
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
In front of a stream of quizzical
and often disapproving parents,
about SO students and professors
protested U.S. policy in Iraq. The
demonstration came before Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper's speech was delivered to
parents Friday at Maples Pavilion.
The rally, organized by the
Stanford Coalition Against War in
Iraq, protested U.N. sanctions
against Iraq and U.S. military pres
ence in the Persian Gulf. They also
hoped to encourage the United
States to continue its support of
the U.N.-Iraq compromise worked
out the week before.
"The U.S. government has
done an incredible job of vilifying,
demonizing and dehumanizing the
Iraqi people," said electrical engi
neering doctoral student Nabeel
Ibrahim, president of the Organi
zation of Arab American Students
in Stanford.
"A demonstration like this
shows that this issue hasn't gone
away, and isn't going to go away,"
said Assoc. Drama and Classics
Prof. Kush Rehm.
The group carried signs in both
English and Arabic with slogans
such as "sanctions = starvation"
and "Hey Bill, sanctions kill."
They also chanted rallying cries in
cluding, "Bill, Bill, while you ski,
sanctions mean fatality."
Clinton had originally planned
to attend Parents' Weekend but
instead went skiing in Utah.
Parental response to the protest
was mainly disapproving. Stu
dents. who were handing out flyers
to parents walking into Casper's
talk, were often brushed aside or
reprimanded.
One parent, when asked if he
would like a flier, responded,
"Would you like some anthrax?"
When another parent was
asked if he would like some educa
tional material, he told the protest

ers that they "were the ones who
needed the education."
Some parents did take fliers
and a few appeared to be interest
ed. Most, however, simply looked
warily at the protesters as they
walked into Maples.
University officials took the
same tactic and did not bother the
demonstrators.
"I got a phone call from [Assis
tant to the President] Jacqueline
Wender, who obviously wasn't
thrilled about us doing this."
Rehm said.
"The administration was wor
ried about what we were going to
do until they found out that Clin
ton wasn't coming."
After Clinton canceled his trip
to Stanford, the protesters re
ceived no further interference
from the administration.
"The protesters seem to be

doing their thing without bother
ing anyone else, so that's fine."
said Director of University Com
munications Terry Shepard.
Casper did not mention the
demonstration in his speech.
The demonstration was orga
nized solely by the coalition and
did not have the official participa
tion of any student organizations
or groups.
"Everything has been ad hoc,"
said History Prof. Joel Beinin.
"The idea for a demonstration
came spontaneously after the
forum we held a few weeks ago."
Because of the unstructured as
pect of the protest, the organizers
hadn't been sure how many to ex
pect.
"We have no way to know, but
I'd think we'd have easilv over 100

people," Rehm said before the
rally. The actual turnout was slight
ly lower at about SO people.
Those who attended the rally,
though not displeased with the at
tendance, attributed the compara
tively low turnout to the Clintons'
absence.
"Everything has changed since
we first started doing this." Beinin
added. "Had Clinton come, it
would have been much different."
The demonstrators came from
all corners of the Stanford commu
nity.
"I've never seen such a diverse
group of students come together for
a cause." Ibrahim said. "There were
Muslims. Jews. Christians, fresh
men. seniors, English majors and
engineering majors."
Many of those who did come to

the demonstration arrived at the
decision to protest after some initial
indecision and hesitation.
"1 wasn't sure where I stood at
first because it's true that I think
Saddam Hussein is a dangerous
man, for his people most of all,"
said graduate student Shari Motro,
one of the demonstrators. "But 1
know that the bombing of Iraqi
civilians is not going to convince
1 lussein to change his regime in any
way."
"I was reading The New York
Times, and 1 started getting upset
with [Senate Majority Leader
Trent] Lott for bashing Clinton for
going along with the U.N.." said an
other protester, sociology master's
student Noah Uhrig.
'They've turned this into a par
tisan issue, and I'm upset with
that."
Stanford students and alumni
also attended a protest in San Fran
cisco's Dolores Park on Saturday.
