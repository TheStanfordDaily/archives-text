WASHINGTON (AP)- Mem
bers of Congress from both parties
agreed yesterday the I N-broke red
agreement on weapons inspections
is unlikely to work and the only real
solution to the festering problem
with Iraq is to drive Saddam Hus
sein from power.
Several lawmakers said on the
news programs yesterday that the
Iraqi president should be tried as an
international war criminal to show
the United States is right to bring
about his downfall.
"It is our goal to remove him
from power because it's patently
obvious to all observers that as long
as he's there, we're faced with this
enormous challenge." Sen. John
McCain. R-Ariz., said on NBC's
"Meet the Press."
Inspection regimes are unlikely
to work as long as Saddam is in
power, said Sen. Hob Kerrey. D-
Neb., on the same program. "We've
got to change the objective in Iraq
and say that we're going to try to
replace this dictatorship with a
democracy."
Sandy Merger. President Clin
ton's national security adviser,
agreed yesterday in a Washington
Post opinion piece that the United
States should support Iraqi opposi
tion groups. But he cautioned that
past efforts to overthrow a govern
ment by proxy, at the Bay of Pigs in
1%1 or Hungary in 1956. failed.
"Before we embrace lofty goals."
Berger wrote, "we must be sure this
time that we are prepared for the
ride."

I he deal worked out between
U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan and Saddam on opening up
Iraq's presidential sites to weapons
inspectors to avert what appeared
to be imminent I .S. military action
has been met in Washington with
general suspicion and. particularly
among Republicans, derision.
Critics contend Saddam will
never live up to his word, he has no
intention of revealing his chemical
and biological weapons programs

and the deal, by adding diplomats
to the inspectors going into the dis
puted presidential sites, makes it
easier for Saddam to move weapons
before inspectors arrive.
"It will add delay, and delay is
the worst enemy of an inspector."
former U.N. weapons inspector
David Kav. an American, told
NBC . "Unless you surprise the
Iraqis, you have no hope of finding
anything: they literally move things
out the back door."
