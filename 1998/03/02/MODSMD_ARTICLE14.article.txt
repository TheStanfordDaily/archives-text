## Notebook Breaking the RA mold 
### 
Don't let misconceptions
stop you from attending
Wednesday's info session

WHEN I receiv ed the offer to
become a Branner resident
assistant last May. I was
confused.
The determination with which I
entered the selection process some
how eroded at the finish line. I v.as no
longer sure that I v. as the "RA type."
EspecialK the "Branner RA type."
Almost a year later. I can admit that
my concerns v.cre misguided. Not that
lam au RA uiuiinaL; (far from it. to
be sure;: but I've learned that the crux
of the matter is that there is no single
ideal personality for an RA.
I reminisce about this conclusion
now because the information session
for those wishing to become RAs next
year is on Wednesday night. I hope
students don't stay home because they
think the\ are not suited for the job.
Of course, such advice is not easy to
follow. It was certainly difficult for me.
My freshman year was spent in
Larkin, another all-freshman haven.
Always on the yelling side of the
"Branner sucks' cheer. I did my share
of ignorant stereotyping. At best. I
thought of Branner RAs as relentless
ly loud instigators of perpetual may
hem.
I"his lifestyle did not conform to
what was in retrospect, my ridiculous
self-image. After all. I have always
imagined myself akin to that character
of a popular musical "who prefers to
spend the evening in the silence of his
room, who likes an atmosphere as
restful as an undiscovered tomb."

Still. I strongly wished to work in an
dorm with many freshmen. And my
exposure to Branner caused me to
revise — and eventually shed — my
silly stereotypes.
Now. my earlier doubts about com
ing to Branner seem trivial. I can't
even imagine what junior year uould
be like without 173 freshmen to share
it with.
The truth is that there is no proto
type for an RA. not even a Branner
RA. The job involves too many skills
— teamwork, empathy, time manage
ment. energy, forethought, and so
much more — for any single person to
be fully qualified. Or. for that matter,
completely unqualified.
Another important observation is
that 1 am not the same person today as
I uas last spring. I didn't change to fit
Branner. but Branner helped me to
change. For the better.
Certainly. Branner did not turn out
to be as quiet as "an undiscovered
tomb." ITiank God.
Imposing some predetermined
viev, of an ideal RA on one's own per
sonalis is an exercise in futility. Resi
dents are too smart and observant to
let anybody get away with insincerity.
Instead, the key is awareness of
oneself combined with an open mind.
I hope students will come to
Wednesday's presentation under
standing that RAs are not required to
be people of a particular sort. They are
simply people.
I can hardly think of a more
demanding job.
