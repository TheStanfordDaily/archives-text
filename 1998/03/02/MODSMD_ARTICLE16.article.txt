## Searching for a few good men 
### 
I SPENT A romantic
Valentine's Day in
Berkeley with Regina.
She bought me a heart
shaped balloon and we
walked hand in hand, gig
gling. For dinner, we went
to a Thai restaurant that
had been recommended

by friends. We took off our shoes, settled
into low chairs and at each other,
enveloped in soft light and the warm smell
of food and incense.
Enjoying a tender moment, we began
talking about men - one of our favorite top
ics.
Despite appearances, we were both sin
gle people of color searching for Mr. Right.
Regina. a black woman, had recently ended
a serious relationship with a white man.
Though they didn't break up over the issue
of race, her boyfriend had told her that he
didn't know much about black culture, and
that if she wanted him to learn, she would
have to explain everything to him.
After that. Regina decided to date black
men. She was tired of explaining black
slang, jokes, music, intellectuals, writers and
hair. She felt isolated in a graduate school
where, because she voiced her opinion, she
was labeled the "angry black woman."
She's not opposed to interracial dating,
but she felt her life would be easier if she
didn't have to explain everything about her
self.
Kegina told me that people in her venan

co-op were surprised that she listened to rap
and R&B The> treated her differently
when her hair was in braids than when it
was tied in a bun.
While 1 understand Regina's perspev
tne. I wonder if her attitude is too narrow
Shouldn't we accept intermarriage, since it
allows people to experience other cultures,
neighborhoods and social circles?
Maybe interracial marriage promotes
social change b\ bringing different people
together.
On the other hand, why should Regina
have to mam "out" to change society?
Why should her relationship be a political
act?
As a gay Asian man. 1 understand the
importance of having a partner with a simi
lar language, history and identity.
But is this exclusivity racist? Is it based
on the idea that some cultures are more
\aiid and important than others?
Regina argues that people from the same
minority groups not only share similar cul
tures. but also experiences of racialization.
Asians are stereotyped as submissive and
nerdy. blacks as welfare queens and drug
dealers, and Native Americans as mystical
and ancient.
Minority experiences in this country are
marked by racism and isolation: factors
which profoundly shape individual identi
ties. Regina is looking for a man who. like
her. has grown up black in America.
She d<x*s not believe that someone with
out the actual experience, no matter how

sympathetic can never full\ understand her
Regina is one of man\ women of color
looking for a good man of color. In aca
demic circles, they are in scarce supply.
Over dinner. Regina specifically com
plained about the lack of politically active
men.
She said they were gay. dating white
women or taken. A similar pattern exists in
the gay community The most desirable
men of color date white men.
Do Â»e have a right to expect these men
to date within their communities? Some
may argue that Regina is justified looking
for a black man. and that for historical rea
sons. her exclusivity is also justified.
Racial exclusivity may be a form of
reverse discrimination by people of color
who choose not to assimilate into white
America.
Or it may be justified because of the gen
eral imbalance of power in this country and
the need to strengthen minority communi
ties.
In today's hostile racial environment,
some argue that all our social interactions
are political. But is this really how we
choose our partners?
Our romantic decisions aren't always
rational. We would be fcx>lish to forget the
importance of passion, luck and hormones.
