Unz has no credibility
As a doctoral candidate in theoretical
physics fluent in both Spanish and f-.nglish. I
want to offer comments on the Feb. 23 arti
cle. "Prop 227 draws academic fire."
Occasionally, I am embarrassed to see a
colleagues, like Mr I n/. act as though a doc
torate in physics gives one the power to solve
any problem in the world. Many fail to real
ize that problems in other disciplines, can be
much harder to solve than those in physics or
mathematics.
Mr I n/ may be acting in good faith, but
he has no background in education, and I
suspect that his "common sense" is not
enough to solve long-standing problems that
many educators have tried to address
Mr I n/ wants to solve a very difficult
problem the question ol how to incorpo
rate children vsho speak a foreign language
into standard I S schools.
He wants to do so by giving Ihem a one
year crash course in English, instead of
througi. a longer transitional program
including instruction in the child s own lan
uuagc. I his "solution." which ignores the

advice of educational experts, shows Mr
I n/ s naive approach to a complex problem.
Most seriously. Proposition 227 will
destroy the benefits that students whose first
language is not English receive from the cur
rent system: It is a fact that some students are
successfully transferred into standard cur
riculum classrooms.
That is. some bilingual programs do work.
And these programs have taken many years
to develop Where is Mr. Unz's common
sense in wanting to do away with these suc
cesses?
Milingual education in its own right has its
advantages Many experts agree that by rein
forcing the language spoken in the child's
home as an intellectual and authoritative lan
guage. bilingual education increases self-con
fidence and shows the child that his or her
differences do not cause problems for society
they enrich it. Unz's monolingual
approach eliminates these benefits.
In summary. I think that such complex
problems as the issue of education in a mul
ticultural environment will not be solved by a
sudden strike of genius from an amateur.

Continue Iraq protests
This letter aims at encouraging those who
oppose U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf to
continue to voice their outrage over a policy
that enforces collective punishment on the
Iraqi people through the U.N. sanctions
The fundamental problems which created
the crisis continue to exist. I he I Jnited States
still maintains an enormous military pres
ence in the Gulf. The sanctions continue to
result in the starvation of the nation, and our
policy of containment ensures that Iraq will
never he allowed to rise out of the devasta
tion created by the Gull War.
In order to maintain our interests, the
United States has run rampant over the obli
gations of international law and over our
obligation to respect the rights of nil citi/ens
to full development. Clearly, our policy in
the region is not aimed at ensuring demo
cratic regimes. Our closest allies. F.gvpt and
Saudi Arabia, both operate as totalitarian
states. Nor are we truly interested in solving
the fundamental problems of the Arab-
Israeli conflict: see our silence in light of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's decision to possibly increase

settlements in the occupied territories by
50.(KX). Nor can U.S. policy be a concern for
arms proliferation: we have poured billions
into the region in order to create a very prof
itable arms race.
Ultimately, the crisis in the Gulf was
brought about because Saddam Hussein
threatened American hegemony. We have
declared the unilateral right to impose any
set of conditions on any people in the region.
We have the right to bring military force to
play on any issue. We have the right to create
massive loss of civilian life and propertv in
order to ensure continuous control over the
flow of oil and to ensure that no rival threat
ens the Israeli presence in the Middle last.
()ur interest is clear : "Might makes right;
give me what I want, regardless of what peo
ple in the Middle Last may feel." And our
interest is both short-sighted and immoral.
You may have noticed that I have used
the words us" and "we." I Jltimatcly. Amer
ican interest will be defined by the American
people you and me. It cannot be in our
interest to kill thousands in order to preserve
oil; nor simply because a third world nation
has dared to disagree with us.
()ver the past weeks, students throughout

the nation have cried out an alternative
vision with force, passion and clarity. We
wish to create an alternative conception of
"interest based on American ideals of
respect for human life and human autonomy.
I his version of the American interest
requires that we remove our military pres
ence from the Gulf: that we rely on the
international community in making deci
sions: that ue lift the sanctions on the Iraqi
people, and th.it we recogni/e and respect
the borders of other nations.
We must be willing to reject our imperial
ist past and reali/e that might does not, in
fact, equal right Ihis version of American
interest is one that is just as tenable in the
long term, and it is one that we cannot stop
agitating for not yet.
