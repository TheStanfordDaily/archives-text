## Experiencing freedom in the Castro

IMAdINE WALKING into a crowded
dance club — men lurking at every cor
ner, couples getting cozy on the dance
floor, people a little toasty at the pool
tables. You walk around, check out the
scene, talk to your friends. Maybe you
dance a hit or buy yourself a drink. Just a
typical night out on the town.
And yet, something's a hit different. No
one looks you up and down when you ente
There are no leering smiles. No insulting
glances. No one stares at your rear end as
you walk by.
It's called The Cafe, located at 16th and
Castro Streets in San Francisco. My gay
friend Wade has taken me to this night spot
on several occasions. It's wonderful — pool
table, balcony, open deck, two bars and a
dance floor. Sure, the bathroom is unisex,
but there is a stall next to the urinals for
"privacy." There's also no cover charge.
Hut by far the best aspect of The Cafe is
the absolute freedom a woman gets from
being there. Since about l >() percent of the
patrons are homosexual males, the discom

fort of being the object of sexual scrutiny
disappear- I he times that I have gone. I
haven't 1 en self-conscious about my phys
ical a* earance. I have no fear of standing
aloi in the room and looking around; I
doi try to avoid catching the eye of males
i 1 .lie room. It's as it 1 don't exist. Absolute
.nonymity priceless.
All women should spend time in the ('as
tro. It's a liberating experience. < )nly in the
Castro can women experience the relief of a
complete absence of self-consciousness.
Men can taste just a little sample of the
objectification that women face on a daily
basis.
Men can deal with the "Hey. baby"
remarks. I hey can have their asses grabbed
by a tipsy man. I hey can feel self-conscious
about their posture, their clothes and their
dancing. I hey can fend off advances on the
dance floor, and they can think of a clever
reason not to give out their phone number.
I hey get to face the luring glances and the
lecherous smiles.
I've been grabbed in bars as have manv

females I know. While an argument can be
made for not frequenting such establish
ments, I've been grabbed on city streets as
well — by drunk bar hoppers and drunk
transients. And the fear that is felt goes
much deeper than a concern !<>r lost materi
al possessions.
A person's sexuality is one of the most
fragile aspects of his or her identity. I o have
that aspect jeopardized is the deepest threat
a person can face. And vet. on a day-to-day
basis, these fears are ignored and steeled
against by women who don't even realize
they are doing it.
My instinctive defenses take over when I
am in a primarily male environment. I was
never quite aware of this until I experienced
a situation in which being defensive was
entirely unnecessary. Without thinking. I
brace myself when passing a group of leer
ing men on the street or ;it the mall. I hat
instinctive defensiveness is why I cringe
when walking into a testosterone-filled
room.
I didn't feel instinctively defensive in The

C "ate. fiven t lie one time at I he Cafe when
a woman approached me. I found the expe
rience non-threatening. She promptly left
when I told her that I was with a friend.
Actually. I was kind of flattered.
Flattered just as I am when approached
by a man who is not leering, lecherous or
slimy. Part of the reason that women get
dressed up to go out is to attract attention,
this is true, hut it is the nature of the atten
tion that is fundamental. It is the difference
between. "You look nice." and "Hey sexy
mama, wanna come home with me'. r
The second half of the equation is the lun
of meeting new people, having a good time
and dancing. Which doesn't mean that you
are looking to get picked up.
Men do not understand what it feels like
to be constantly on edge in certain situa
tions. to feel constantly threatened.
Harassment is a real problem and one
that, sadly, most women have become
desensitized to due to inculcation. Some are
not even aware that their reactions have
become innate: they instinctively brace

themselves when they receive looks and
hear comments. It's a reality that women
have to deal with, one that cuts across race,
class or socioeconomic background.
Sometimes things that you aren't even
aware ol can profoundly affect your outlook
on life. It is only when faced with an unfa
miliar environment, without this sense of
threat, that one reah/es how wrong it is that
;i woman should be made to feel that way.
Everyone should have his or her percep
tions turned upside down once in a while.
So. il the iix >od strikes, take a jaunt down
to the ( astro. Stop by Ihe Cafe. Have a
( osmopolitan. look around, lake a spin on
the dance floor. Hey. its tree. And at the
ver\ least, you just miuht learn a new pick
up line.
At the most, you might learn to not pick
up at all.
