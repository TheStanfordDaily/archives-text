Stanford's new Hinduism Discussion Group
brought I iindu spiritual leader Maharaja Madhva
to campus Friday as its inaugural speaker.
I lie group started fall quarter to help foster ex
ploration and deeper understanding of Hindu
texts, said Mitul Vakharia, a master's student in
sociology and the group's co-founder. Members
meet each week to discuss informally and openly
passages from the Bhagavad-Gita and other Vedic
literature.
Vakharia stressed that no former knowledge in
I linduisni or philosophy is required for the discus
sions.
I le also noted the mixed bag of participants
they range from practitioners of the religion to
those simply interested in Vedic teachings.
I linduisni. Vakharia explained, is a "very open
religion that causes people to question the self, life
and motivations. It is unique in that it is flexible be
cause you believe what you want, since many paths
reach the same goal. The texts have a lot of spiri
tual knowledge embodied within them but can be
quite difficult to read on one's own."
I le and senior I Jmang Mehta formed the group
to ease such challenges and to promote the explo
ration of India's spiritual heritage in Hindu texts.
Vakharia said.

As its first major event, the group sponsored
Madhva's visit, which attracted a diverse group of
about 20 people to the Asian American Activities
Center.
Listeners included sophomore Laura Lee and
Debbie Young, a non-Stanford student from Eng
land majoring in religious studies, who was on
campus visiting a friend. Moth had seen the fliers
around campus.
The talk by Madhva — an annyasis, or re
nounced disciple, of the International Society of
Krishna Consciousness — focused on "The Bha
gavad-C iita: Practical Mysticism for Daily Life."
According to the international society, Vedic
scriptures are believed to be "the Lord's divine
breath simultaneously transmitting all the knowl
edge humankind requires to meet the material
needs and revive the dormant God-consciousness
of each person."
Although the Krishna consciousness move
ment derives many of its teachings from Hin
duism. it is not an established religion, according to
the society's Web site.
The site called the society's teachings "nonsec
tarian and nondenominational, for they are not
limited to any particular historical religion, incul
cating the essential and universal principle of all
religion."
Janaki-Rama Dasa, a young monk learning

from Madhva, explained on Friday that the goal of
the I fare Krishnas is to propagate spiritual knowl
edge tt) the society at large by disseminating texts
at college campuses like Stanford.
Opening with a hhajana, or Hindu spiritual
hymn. Madhva and other devotees chanted
mantras calling on (iod.
"Krishna is the name of one incarnation of
Vishnu (a Hindu god)," Mehta said. "The word
Krishna comes from the Hindi word ukarslum,
meaning attraction. (iod is the one to whom all are
attracted.
"I fare represents the feminine side of Krishna.
Krishna is always depicted as male, but the true na
ture is all-encompassing. The 1 fare reminds us that
C iod is neither male nor female."
Madhva wore peach-colored garb and had the
traditional shaved head, which symbolizes renun
ciation, detachment from regular society and
cleanliness. With paint on his nose marking the
body as a temple, he discussed how a person
"could live in the world and not be affected by it."
He went on to explain that yoga is a means by
which people can abandon attachment to the
world to purification and disentanglement.
