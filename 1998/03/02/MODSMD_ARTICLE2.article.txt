# Former SLAC employee sues
## Claims whistle blowing caused firing 
### Ann kim Staff writer 
A former employee of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center filed a
lawsuit against the center earlier this month, claiming that he unfairly lost
his position. He is expecting a grievance arbitrator's decision within a week.
David E. Gordon filed the civil suit in San Mateo County, stating that he
lost his job as a safety officer at SLAC because he "challenged manage
ment's efforts to circumvent safety regulations."
P. A. Moore, a spokeswoman for SLAC, declined to comment on the law
suit.
"Lawsuits are sensitive issues, and because of that it's inappropriate for
me to make a comment of one sort or the other," Moore said. "We wouldn't
want to do anything to jeopardize either side."
Gordon's lawyer David Martin said that his client is awaiting a decision
from an arbitration hearing that took place last month as part of the SLAC
grievance procedure.
Since a decision is pending. Martin said he would be unable to comment
on his client's case.
Gordon was hired as a safety officer by SLAC in 1983 to oversee safety
during the construction of a new particle accelerator.
The lawsuit alleges that in 1990, an associate director at SLAC told Gor
don that his duty was "to keep federal regulators off the backs of the scien
tists," and threatened to terminate Gordon's position.
Gordon's lawsuit also claims that the safety concerns he raised at SLAC
were not taken seriously.
According to the lawsuit. Gordon wrote a lengthy memo in May 19%. out
lining safety issues at SLAC. A few months later his position was eliminated.
SLAC personnel director Lee Lyon told the San Jose Mercury News that
Gordon's layoff was one of 39 made early last year. SLAC has recently dealt
with substantial cuts in federal funding.
The lawsuit states that the alleged treatment of Gordon by SLAC vio
lates a California law that protects whistle-blowers.
SLAC is home to physicists who do research on subatomic particles by
making them collide. It is funded entirely by the U.S. Department of Energy
