# Law students, profs hold trivia contest for EPA
## 
### Maggie Lange 
On Friday, law students and their
professors faced off in Kresge Audi
torium to participate in the second
annual "Battle of the Brains."
Played to a full auditorium, this triv
ia contest benefited the East Palo
Alto Community Law Project.
Previous benefits involved out
door sports contests between stu
dents and faculty, but since last year,
the Law School has put on a Jeop
ardy-style trivia bowl.
As Law School Dean Paul Brest
said in his introduction to the event.
"What better place for a trivia eon
test than a law school?"
Student hosts Rukaiyah Adams
and Junichi Semitsu introduced the
game and its rules, explaining it as

"just like Jeopardy, only we ask
questions and you answer answers."
Despite this stipulation, some
players couldn't help responding in
the traditional "what is" format. The
first round consisted of a play-off be
tween the top three student teams.
The second round pitted two teams
of professors and staff against each
other. In the grand finale, the pro
lessors battled (lie students for the
championship trophy.
Categories were idiosyncratic
and ranged from Shakespearean
fools to rap music to cheese. Profes
sors and students alike excelled in
areas such as "losing presidential
candidates." but were more at sea
when it came to illegal drugs. And al
though the professors showed an ad
mirable familiarity with jazz, they

completely failed to identify the
AlanisMorissettesong"!land in my
Pocket," much to the amusement of
the audience.
The teams making it to the final
round were "The Big Jankowskis,"
consisting of students David
Jankowski. Aii Lefkovits, Tom
Halpern and Liz Smedley, and
"Actus Reus." consisting of Profs.
Hank Greely, Marc Franklin,
Miguel Mendez and Communica
tions Director Connie Hellyer.
After a very close match, the profes
sors won in the Final Jeopardy
round and received their trophy.
"We are very gratified by student
and faculty support for [the law pro
ject]." Nelson said of the event.
Members of the Law School
founded the East Palo Alto Com

inanity Law Project in 1984 as a non
profit organization to provide free
legal services to low-income citizens
of East Palo Alto.
According to Acting Director
Teresa Nelson, the project provides
community members with legal ex
pertise in the areas of housing, com
munity economic development, do
mestic violence and education. Most
law students obtain their clinical
training while working in programs
run out of the project.
Many law firms in the area make
generous donations to the project
every year, and the Law School
hosts a benefit to thank them. This
year, the project received gifts from
13 different sponsors. In all, the do
nations totaled $ 15.4(H). twice the
amount the project raised last year.
