### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer

combination.
Just ask the Arizona Wildcats.

at Arizona and soundly defeated the No.
7 Wildcats 108-90 before 6,424 at Maples

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
■ Saturday: No. 5 Stanford 108, No. 7 Ari
zona 90

And like a good fairy tale, the seniors
led the way. Folkl had game-highs of 31

points and 15 rebounds, while Scott
added 17 points of her own. All told, the
four seniors combined for 73 points and
13 assists — a career-high 10 from Ny
gaard.
"That has to be a record." Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer jokingly
said. "I'll have you playing point guard
by next week."
The victory clinches a tie for the Pacif
ic 10 Conference title, but by virtue of its

sweep of UCLA. Stanford (19-5. 15-1
Pac-10) has earned a berth in the N( A A
tournament.
"They're much more balanced (than
past Stanford teams), and they're playing
with a purpose." said Arizona head
coach Joan Bonvicini. "Winning solves a
lot of problems, and it mosth gives them
confidence. I think Mores is doing a real-
ly good job, and Peterson came off
the bench and did a nice job. When
the team starts rolling, 1 think it
boosts everyone's confidence."
Despite the margin of victory, it
wasn't easy — or pretty. The whis
tle-happy officiating crew called 57
fouls, while Arizona (19-6, 12-4)
turned the ball over 20 times. Stan
ford tied a season-high with 24 as
sists — to go along with its 24
turnovers.
But unlike last year's Senior
Night, when Washington quickly
found itself in a 30-6 hole, Arizona
refused to be diffused by the elec
tricity of the afternoon. After 13
minutes, the Wildcats were very
much in the game after senior for
ward Adia Barnes' layup made it 28-
22.
"1 think it's really hard to start a
game when your emotions are so
down thinking about [the seniors]
leaving," VanDerveer said. "Their
athleticism gave us trouble in turn
ing the ball over."
Then the Stanford seniors assert
ed themselves. Owen nailed a short
baseline jumper and made a layup
on consecutive possessions. Follow
ing a Folkl bucket and a trey by ju
nior guard Regan Freuen, Owen
came back with another short
jumper from the left corner to bol
ster Stanford's lead to 40-27 with
3:14 to go in the half, a margin the
Cardinal would hold heading into
halftime.
The fact that Arizona only
trailed 46-33 was a small miracle.
The Wildcats made only nine shots
for a dubious 31-percent shooting
percentage from the floor. They
added 13 turnovers to go with only
five assists, while they were getting
out-rebounded 22-14. In fact, Folkl
had more defensive rebounds
(nine) than the entire Wildcat squad
(eight).
Apparently, Folkl was only
warming up, and that would eventu
ally spell doom for Arizona.

But first, the vaunted open-court
game of sophomore guards Milena
Flores and Melody Peterson was put
on display early in the second half.
Successive Arizona turnovers led to
a driving layup by Flores and a pin
point full-court pass to Scott for an
other easy two. The lead became 66-
41 on five straight points by Folkl
with a little more than 13 minutes to
go-
The Wildcats were falling apart
as they were unable to muster an an
swer for Stanford's frontline (how
many teams can?). By the end of the
game, the trio of Scott, Owen and
Folkl put up 59 points and 27 re
bounds while the Arizona front
court of Barnes, senior forward
Mikko Giordano and senior center
Marte Alexander had 37 points and
only 14 boards.
"We were in a difficult position
because we are very undersized in
most positions," Barnes said. "What
we were trying to do early was trying
to double down, but the opposite
post was cutting to the basket mak
ing easy layups, so we didn't have
good rotation. We made better ad
justments pushing them out in the
second half, but when someone's
hot like Kristin, it's hard to stop
her."
With the game no longer in seri
ous doubt, it was only a matter of
when Stanford would hit the 100-
point barrier and how long until the
seniors would exit the game to a
thundering standing ovation. Flores
executed the former with a running
13-foot jumper, while the seniors
left the game with a minute to go.
For one final time in the regular
season, the Stanford contingent
voiced its appreciation of a group
that brought them three Final Fours
and 59 victories without a loss at
Maples Pavilion.
"This is an excellent win for us,"
VanDerveer said. "1 can't say we
saw our concentration keyed for 40
minutes. We had spurts of absolute
brilliance and then some other
spurts of I don't know if 1 could de
scribe. But again, [the seniors] have
a lot to be proud of."
