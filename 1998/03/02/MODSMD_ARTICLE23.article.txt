# Awesome class says goodbyes
## Seniors belong in the record books

Emotional.
That's how the live seniors of
the Stanford women's basketball
team described the last regular
season home game of its Stanford
careers after Saturday's 108-90 win
over Arizona.
And the Maples Pavilion crowd
of 6.424 was on hand prior to the
game to express their sentiments
for seniors Vanessa Nygaard,
Olympia Scott. Heather Owen,
Kristin Folkl and Naomi Muli
tauaopele — a class that's been
nothing short of spectacular over
the last four years.
In that time, the fifth-ranked
Cardinal(l9-5,15-1 Pacific lOCon
ference) has been to three Final
Fours, won four Pac-10 titles (Sat
urday's win over the No. 7 Wildcats
clinched at least a tie for this year's
crown), amassed a 112-13 overall
record (68-2 Pac-10) and never lost

a game at Maples Pavilion.
"It started to hit me Thursday,"
Scott said. "Everybody always says
time flies, but it really does. I can
remember my recruiting trip. And
it makes me feel good to know that
I made the right decision in coming
here. Our whole class was unique
because everybody decided to
come and be a part of something
big instead of wanting to be a big
fish in a small pond."
The only question mark head
ing into the evening was whether or
not Folkl and Mulitauaopele, both
of whom are graduating in June but
have another year of eligibility,
would be honored with their class
mates. Folkl had started the run
ning joke that Senior Night would
be an indication of her future plans,
but after the game, she and Muli
tauaopele both expressed their de
sire to keep all their options open
at this point.

Senior forward Vanessa Nygaard added to the pounding Stanford s seniors gave Ari
zona with a career-high 10 assists.
"We'll have nice floral arrange
ments in our dorm." Folkl said when
asked what it meant that she and
Mulitauaopele were honored as se
niors.
For the moment, that was the end
of talk about next year, and the five
seniors sitting across the table at the
press conference got a chance to re
flect on their Stanford careers while
head coach I'ara Van Derveer stood
behind them.
It was very emotional," Owen
said of the pregame festivities. "It's
kind of exciting at the same time. Its
nice having our parents down and
our siblings. For me it was a time to
reflect on all the great things we've
done together and how close we've
become over the years."
I hat seemed to be the common
sentiment among the five seniors,
four of whom scored in double fig
ures against the Wildcats. The only
exception was Mulitauaopele, who
because of injury, did not play but
provided an emotional lift by being
in uniform for the first time all year.
"I'm glad it still fits." Muli

tauaopele said jokingly. "It was a
very emotional experience for me to
actually put it on again. It didn't
quite hit during the ceremony. I wish
I eould've played this year, but I've
tried to be there as much as 1 could
on the sidelines or at practice. I'm
going to miss the girls; I wish I had
had the chance to plav with them."
While Mulitauaopele cheered
from the sidelines, her classmates
put on an exhibition in the post. The
undersized Wildcats were no match
for Stanford's front line. At halftime,
Folkl already had a double double
with 14 points and 10 boards, while
Owen contributed nine points and
Nygaard added five assists.
"1 hope Folkl leaves." said Ari
zona head coach Joan Bonvicini.
"She's a great player. I 'd like to give
her flowers too. Folkl's a great play
er. and so is Olympia."
When the second half started, the
seniors picked up right where they
left off. Scott got out on the break for
several of her 13 second-half points
and finished the game with 17.
Nygaard matched her assist pro
duction from the first 20 minutes for
a career-high 10 on the game — a
stat she was quick to point out to
VanDerveer after the game — and

also contributed 14 points. Owen
only took two shots in the second
and finished with 11 points.
Meanwhile, Folkl continued to
dominate. A 10-of-15 shooting per
formance (11 of 12 from the free
throw line) was good for a game
high 31 points, and Folkl's 15 re
hounds tied her career-high.
When Owen checked in at the 2
minute, 17 second mark Stanford
had the game in hand, leading Ari
zona W-76. Hut Maples was craving
one last look at all four of its seniors.
VanDerveer obliged.
Sophomore point guard Milena
Flores shared the floor with Ny
gaard, Scott, Owen and Folkl. and
wouldn't you know it, the only non
senior on the floor got the 13-foot
jumper to place the Card over the
century mark with 1:49 remaining.
Fifty seconds later the seniors
headed to the sidelines amid a warm
standing ovation, putting a fitting
close on their careers at Maples — at
least until the postseason.
"It's a real bittersweet day for us
with officially the end of our season
here in Maples for our seniors,"
VanDerveer said. "They're a great
class, not just a class of great players,
but great people."
