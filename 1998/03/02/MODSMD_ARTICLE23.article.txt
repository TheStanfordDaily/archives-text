# Awesome class says goodbyes
## Seniors belong in the record books 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Emotional.
That's how the live seniors of
the Stanford women's basketball
team described the last regular
season home game of its Stanford
careers after Saturday's 108-90 win
over Arizona.
And the Maples Pavilion crowd
of 6.424 was on hand prior to the
game to express their sentiments
for seniors Vanessa Nygaard,
Olympia Scott. Heather Owen,
Kristin Folkl and Naomi Muli
tauaopele â€” a class that's been
nothing short of spectacular over
the last four years.
In that time, the fifth-ranked
Cardinal(l9-5,15-1 Pacific lOCon
ference) has been to three Final
Fours, won four Pac-10 titles (Sat
urday's win over the No. 7 Wildcats
clinched at least a tie for this year's
crown), amassed a 112-13 overall
record (68-2 Pac-10) and never lost

a game at Maples Pavilion.
"It started to hit me Thursday,"
Scott said. "Everybody always says
time flies, but it really does. I can
remember my recruiting trip. And
it makes me feel good to know that
I made the right decision in coming
here. Our whole class was unique
because everybody decided to
come and be a part of something
big instead of wanting to be a big
fish in a small pond."
The only question mark head
ing into the evening was whether or
not Folkl and Mulitauaopele, both
of whom are graduating in June but
have another year of eligibility,
would be honored with their class
mates. Folkl had started the run
ning joke that Senior Night would
be an indication of her future plans,
but after the game, she and Muli
tauaopele both expressed their de
sire to keep all their options open
at this point.
