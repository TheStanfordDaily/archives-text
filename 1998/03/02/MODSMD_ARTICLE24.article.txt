Saturday's match against No. 37 Cal
(6-1. 2-1) w;is one of the toughest teams
Stanford has played so far this season,
but the Card's Pacific 10 Conference ri
\als barely made a dent. Out of all the
singles matches, only one set was taken
awa\ from Stanford.
Head coach Dick Gould had
been worried that Cal might be a
threat to Stanford's perfect record.
"They're a tough team." Gould
said. "We lost to a lot of their indi
viduals in other tournaments. Their
team is very even — Bobby Mahal
is clearly the best player, but after
that, it evens out."
Goldstein played well against
Mahal. Goldstein never faltered, de

feating a frustrated Mahal 6-2,6-1.
At second singles, junior Ryan
Wolters took on Minh Le of the
Bears.
"Ryan started a little slow, a lit
tle sluggish, but then pulled himself
together and came out with the
win."
Wolters finished in two sets, de
feating Le 6-4.6-1.
Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan
played third and fourth singles, re
spectively. Fifth-ranked Bob Bryan
had an easy time with Adrian
Barnes, beating him 6-3. 6-2. Sec-

ond-ranked Mike Bryan was the
first to give Stanford a singles win.
dropping onl\ two games to Cal's
David Sutton f>-2.6-0.
"Bob and Mike had routine
wins." (iould said. "Thev both
played \er\ well."
Sophomore Geoff Abrams has
"played very well in the past couple
of weeks." (iould said.
Abrams had very little trouble
with kian Raiszadeh. taking him
down in two sets 6-4. f>-3.
The lone freshman in the entire
match, Kim struggled against Cal's
Nathan Jackmon, a top-l(X) player.
Kim dropped the first set against
Jackmon 6-1 but then fought back
to take both the second and third
sets 6-3, 7-5. The match was close
all the way to the end, when a very
frustrated Jackmon finally lost his
serve to give Kim the win.
"1 think I started out slow, then
started to pick it up in the second
set. and he let down a bit," Kim
said. "And then the third set was
just a battle. But 1 was happv over
all with the way 1 finished."
Gould was very pleased with
Kim's performance, saying that
"Alex continues to be a really good
competitor."
In doubles, Goldstein and
Wolters played at the No. 1 spot,
taking on Mahal and Jackmon. who
Gould calls "a very good doubles
team." Goldstein and Wolters
played well and defeated the Cal
team 8-6.
The Bryans played in the second
doubles spot and beat the team of
Chris Santoso and Sutton in a
washout 8-1.
Abrams and Hoeveler helped
clean up against Cal with an 8-6 win
over Le and Erik Dmytuk 8-6.
Gould was very happv with the
way the team played against Cal.
"They're a very good and expe
rienced team. Barnes is the only
new player," he said. "If we hadn't
been ready for them we would have
struggled against them, but we
were definitely ready.
"It was a pretty devastating
performance. These guys continue
to really impress me, so I'll take
it."
Although Gould was pleased
with Stanford's win against Cal, he
said there is still a lot of room for
improvement on the team.
"If people think we're good
now," Gould said, "just wait until
May."
