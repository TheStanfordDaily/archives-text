With the win. Stanford (13-0
overall, 1-0 Pac-10 Southern Divi
sion) extended its dual-match win
ning streak to 32 and earned its
fourth victory against top-10 oppo
nents this season.
"It was quite a match," said Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan. "I
had a feeling it was going to be a war
over there. We always have that
kind of match over in Berkeley, but
it worked out well. We were happy
to get out of there, though."
Stanford sophomore Jennifer

Heiser gave the Cardinal what
proved to be an essential 4-2 lead
heading into doubles play by defeat
ing Cal's Francesca La'O in the No.
6 singles match. Heiser rebounded
from losing the first set and even
fought off three California match
points before pulling out the victory.
"Jen was the one who saved our
bacon." Brennan said. "She was the
heroine. Denying one match point is
tough enough, but she did it three
times."
Sophomores Anne Kremer and
Teryn Ashley then clinched the
dual-match win in the No. 1 doubles
match by handing Amanda Augus
tus and Amy Jensen their first lossof
the season 8-6.
After the Cardinal opened up a
7-4 lead in the match, the Cal squad
pulled the match to 7-6 with Ashley
serving for the match. The Stanford
sophomore held, keeping the Cardi

3 and No. 4 singles position. Senior
co-captain Julie Scott, the lif th
ranked singles player in the nation,
continued to play well for the unde
feated Cardinal, scoring a 6-3, 6-0
victory over sophomore Esther
Knox in the No. 2 singles match.
In the No. 3 match. No. 7 Ashley
remained unbeaten in her dual
match career by rolling over Cal's
Stephanie I ibhits in straight sets 6-
1.6-1. After an unblemished fresh
man season competing mostly at
the No. 6 spot, Ashley is now 35-0 in
dual matches at Stanford.
Senior Ania Bles/ynski also won
a pivotal singles match for the Car
dinal. After battling illness for the
past three dual matches, Bles/ynski
looked good against sophomore
Amy Jensen in the No. 4 match,
winning 6-3,6-2.
Junior Amanda Augustus, the
No. 22 singles player in the nation,
put Cal (9-2,0-1) on the board with
a big win over Stanford's Kremer in
the top singles matches. Augustus
pulled off the upset over Kremer 7-
5.6-3.
"Anne did not have one of her
better matches," Brennan said. "In
fact, it was probably one of her
worst. She just didn't have it that
day."
Cal's Anita Kurimay gave the
Bears their second win in singles
play by defeating freshman Sarah
Pestieau 7-5.6-1.
Heiser's win proved crucial for
the Cardinal. Needing only one
doubles victory to secure the win,
California threatened to sweep all
three doubles matches. With Ash
ley and Kremer battling it out with
Augustus and Jensen, Knox and
Kurimay scored a huge win in de
feating Scott and Bles/ynski, the
top-ranked doubles team, K-6.
Meanwhile, in the No. 3 doubles
match, La'O and Jenny Lee were
leading Heiser and Pestieau 5-1
when Kremer and Ashley pulled
out the No. 1 match and closed it out
for the Cardinal.
"It is always crazy when we play
there," Brennan said. " The girls you
think are going to win lose, and the
ones you think will lose win. You
have Julie and Ania playing so well
and they lost. And 1 was worried
about the No. I doubles team be
cause they had lost three in a row.
but they were the ones who did it for
us."
