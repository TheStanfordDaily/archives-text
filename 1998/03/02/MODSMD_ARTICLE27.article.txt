MEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Saturday: Michigan 227.55. Stan
ford 220.95

Last weekend the Cardinal was
overwhelmed hy Cal, and the gym
nasts produced disastrous scores in
an unimpressive performance at the

UCLA Invitational on Thursday. ()n
Thursday, questionable judging and
several spills by the gymnasts com
bined for a season-low score of 209.
"The judging was a little harsh,
and we lix>ked really sloppy," said se
nior Gabe Edelman.
Saturday night, however, featured
a dramatic improvement.
"Eleven points improvement over
l"hursday — a huge improvement in
a sport where every tenth counts,"
said freshman Rico Andradc.
Both the Cardinal and the
Wolverines were in top form Satur
day night at Hurnham Pavilion.
Drawing from a large and supportive
team, the Michigan gymnasts dis
played why they have been dubbed

rising stars as of late. Led by flashy
sophomore La Lo Haro and coach
Kurt Golder, the Wolverines pro
duced clean routine after clean rou
tine, occasionally with a bit of artistic
flair. Winless two seasons ago, the
Wolverines are now a force to be
reckoned with.
"I'm impressed by what they did
tonight." F.delman said. "1 think that
it gives us something to work toward
when we see teams that are a step
above us. which we haven't been used
to in the past years."
Aside from a few startling crashes
from the high bar. the Cardinal was
impressive as well.
"People were hitting a lot of rou
tines," said sophomore Jason Kat

sampes. "There was much more con
sistency."
Katsampcs. in fact, was a standout
Saturday night. Competing in every
event, he consistently posted scores
well above 9.00. capped hy a strong
pommel horse routine which earned
him a 9.75. Head coach Sadao Hama
d.i was very effusive when discussing
katsampcs Saturday night.
'He's the most talented gymnast
I've ever coached." Hamada said.
"He comes up with really strong and
difficult skills within weeks — things
that take mint people years to learn.
He's definitely an Olympic hopeful
for the vear 2000."
