at the McKale Center as the No. 2
Wildcats ran up a 90-58 rout.
They then sat silently in the lock
er room as Lute Olson's team cut
down the nets, celebrating its first
league title in four years and the first
for any current Wildcat player.
" This is the first group of seniors
we've had in a while that hadn't won
a (conference) championship their
first three years," Olson said. "They
really wanted it."
The Wildcats (26-3,16-0) proved
just how badly they wanted it with
their stilling defense and a high
tempo offense to sweep their season
series with the Cardinal.
They held the Cardinal to 20
points in the first half, a season low
for Stanford, but the Cardinal
trailed by only 11 at the intermis
sion.
Stanford came out to score the
first five points of the second period
to cut the deficit to six, but a three
pointer by Arizona's senior forward
Michael Dickerson stopped the
Cardinal rally and began the Wild
cat rout.
In a shooting performance remi
niscent of their 93-75 victory over
the Cardinal on Jan. 31 in Maples
Pavilion, the Wildcats hit 58 percent
of their shots from the floor.
After going scoreless in the first
half. Dickerson led the way with 15
points on 6-of-9 shooting in the sec
ond. Arizona's 59 second-half
points were the most given up in
one period by the Oirdhial all sea
son.
The Wildcats also kept up the
pressure at the other end of the
court. While Arizona seemingly
scored at will, the Cardinal was kept
out of rhythm on its set half-court of

fense and the Wildcats pulled away
big.
"We just got outplayed every
way possible," said Cardinal coach
Mike Montgomery. "Once the
tempo was set. it was really tough for
us to stay in the game.
"We were allowing them to get
out on the break in transition. They
just flat whipped us. The two pre
mier teams we've played with quick
ness have given us tremendous
problems. Maybe we can't play at
this level yet. I don't know."
Arizona senior guard Miles
Simon gave the home crowd one last
sterling performance, grabbing
game-highs with 20 points and eight
assists.
Senior Bennett Davison also

gave the audience a terrific farewell
show on the defensive end. earning
game-highs with nine steals and
three blocks.
Sophomore Mark Madsen led
Stanford with a team-high 10 points
and seven rebounds, a severe drop
off for a squad that has all five
starters averaging double digits in
scoring.
The Cardinal was never able to
use its size advantage effectively.
Arizona's big men constantly front
ed the Cardinal post players down
low. and the Wildcats' quickness
prevented the Stanford guards from
trying to pass over the top.
The end result was Arizona
outscoring Stanford in the paint 36-
24.

"We didn't capitalize on the op
portunities we had," said Cardinal
center Tim Young "They know
what it's like to be in clutch, high
pressure situations.
"We still have a lot to play for.
We'll come back on Thursday"
against Oregon.
But the major difference in the
game was Arizona's athleticism.
The Cardinal constantly found itself
outnumbered as the Wildcats broke
down the court for easy layups.

The Wildcats were just as fast on
defense, using their overwhelming
overplays for 18 steals and 20 forced
turnovers.
