In a separate application process. 11 other Greek
organizations have applied for housing. Under this new

The fraternity lost its house in 1995 due to dwindling
membership. The officers at the time voluntarily gave
up the house because 12 of the 17 then-active fraterni
ty brothers were graduating that year.
To meet residency requirements, the fraternity will
need to fill 47 of the 51 spots in the house KAs now
have 35 active members, three of whom are graduating,
according to sophomore Bob Baird. current K A presi
dent.
"We're delighted that the Kappa Alphas have met
the criteria ... and enhanced their prospect for long
term success and viability," Wais said. His office sent a
letter to fraternity members on Friday recognizing that
the fraternity had met explicit criteria agreed upon in a
letter written by the fraternity members upon losing
their house. The decision was made after consultation
with alumni, the national organization and current ac
tive members.
Most of the current members are sophomores, ac
cording to chapter Vice President Matt Crystal, who is
also a sophomore. Last spring, the fraternity sent out a
letter to all freshman men in a bid to receive enough
pledges to get their house back

Baird said, "but there were 35 guys from Donner.

opportunity to live with a bunch of friends."
