## Sophomore Thomas to host SCBN talk show 
### Anh Bui 
It's 7 p.m. and an eager audience
quiets down just for a moment be
fore the host presents himself, en
thusiastically addressing the crowd,
"Welcome to The Andre Show!"
This is how sophomore Andre
Thomas envisions the start of a new
S( UN talk show titled "The Andre
Show." The program, hosted by
Thomas, will premiere April 2.
"I'm scared," Thomas admitted.
"I've never done anything like this
before in my life. 1 don't know if I'm
doing anything right, or even if I'm
thinking about it in the right way."
Despite these apprehensions,
Thomas is sure about what he wants
as the end result.
"If I am able to get a couple of
people to say that they were able to
take something and challenge them

to look inside themselves, then I'll
be happy," Thomas said.
Every two weeks, "The Andre
Show" will have a panel discussing
issues concerning Stanford students
and young adults. The first show will
focus on dating at Stanford.
"Who's to say that there is no dat
ing at Stanford." Thomas said. "Ob
viously, there's a lot of random sex,
and sex plus insecure people do not
mix.
"If you are confident (enough) to
approach someone to be intimate
with them, why can you not ask them
out to dinner?"
Thomas is planning to invite a
range of Stanford students to talk
about how to meet people and how
to be more socially relaxed.
"Andre is a very engaging charac
ter," said junior kerstin Johnson, as
sistant producer of the program.

"He is going to be what makes the
show, and he is so niueh lun!"
According to Thomas, however,
he was not always so outgoing.
"1 used to be shy to the point
where I was afraid of people,"
Thomas said. "I used to always walk
around with my head hanging down.
But when I got to high school. 1 real
ized that there was no use in being
intimidated by people. I will always
be myself and say what 1 think and
feel what I want to feel."
The shows will feature not only
Stanford students but also outside
experts. Travel agents from Ameri
can Express will come to talk about
vacation planning, and Thomas will
question a Cowell psychologist
about self-esteem. All programs will
be broadcasted live on SCBN.
"A lot of this is going to be in-the
moment, very spontaneous conver

sation," Thomas said. " The less
scripted (the show is) the better. I'm
looking for reactions here. I want the
audience to react, I want viewers to
react, and I certainly want the guests
to react."
People involved with the pro
gram are optimistic about its success.
"I'm looking forward to see how
he pulls it off," said sophomore
Kahea Rivera, financial officer for
the show. "I still feel amazed at what
Andre has done. 1 admire him for his
determination and will to follow his
dreams."
"Basically, listen to what I say
and take from it as you see fit."
Thomas said. "If you see something
that could help you in an area of your
life that's lacking, then you change.
If you don't see anything, hell, just
tune in to laugh because it's going to
be funny."
