■ Saturday: USC defeated Stanford 11-15. 15-13. 10-15.
15-4. 15-11

In Friday's match, Stanford battled with Long Beach
State (9-4. 3-4 MPSF) for a win in the first game and
seemed poised to take an easy match from the 49ers. With
the second game tied at 4-4. 49er Ail-American Gaby
Amar. a jump server, went to the service line and served
seven straight points to give Long Beach State an 11 -4 lead
and a quick game-two victory for the 49ers.
As a response to passing woes, Stanford changed its
serve-receive formation in the third game. The Cardinal
put up more of a fight in the game but was still unable to
pull out a win.
Stanford finally adjusted to the changes in the fourth
game and won easily. Under the fifth game's rally scoring,
the Cardinal got ahead early and maintained its lead to
win the match.
Following last weekend's 51-kill performance against
Loyola Marvmount, sophomore outside hitter A\nd> Witt
posted a match-high 3K kills.
"Because our passing was poor, our quick attack was
shut down." said Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves.
"Witt carried a big load and had another really strong hit
ting match."
Witt also led all players with a match-high 13 digs, while
freshman setter Josh Lukens added nine.
Because of poor passing and the resulting shutdown of
the Cardinal's quick attack, senior middle blockers Tad

Hoffman and Keenan Whitehurst posted kill totals well
below their season averages. Fach added nine kills for
Stanford.
"We would like to set our middles much more," Nieves
said.
While Whitehurst. the nation's leader in hitting per
centage. only had nine kills, he posted a match-high .533
and also led all blockers with 11.
In Saturday's loss, the ( ardinal played the final three
games ol the match without Witt, the nation's No. 2 play
er in kill average. Following his 3K-kill performance Fri
day when he carried a large portion of the Cardinal's hit
ting load with 60 swings, Witt felt he would be unable to
play a complete match against I SC .
Prior to a Jan. 23 match with UC -San Diego, Witt
pulled a shoulder muscle, and the heavy hitting loads he
has recently carried made him unable to complete Satur
day's match.
For the I JSC match, Stanford started senior swing hit
ter Devin Poolman in place of junior outside hitter Patrick
Klein. Poolman had effectively replaced Klein in Friday's
match. The Cardinal intended to replace Witt vMth Klein
when Witt felt he could no longer play in the match.
C iame one was again a battle for Stanford, as was game
two. The Cardinal mounted two comebacks before losing
that match. These two long games took their toll on Witt,
who then left the match.
The C 'ardinal pulled out a victory in game three but fell
behind KM in game lour. Stanford took this opportunity
to change things and placed freshman setter Brad CGriffith
and junior outside hitter ( hns (iriffith into the C ardinal
lineup. Phis change did not have its desired effect and
Stanford dropped that game.
Game five, like game two. was another example of a
failed Stanford comeback. Junior middle blocker Jeremy
Bart entered the C ardinal lineup and served Stanford to a
9-9 tie. Following this comeback, the Cardinal could not
sideout and eventually lost the game.
While six C 'ardinal players p< »sted double-digit totals in
the kill category, only one of those players. Witt, hit above
.400. The C ardinal's outside hitters in the final three
games of the match all hit belov. 2(H).
"We had one of our poorest hitting nights overall o
this season." Nieves said.
While any loss is disappointing for the team. Saturday''
was disappointing for another reason.
"Saturday "s match confirmed what we feared." Nieve
said. "Without Witt, we become an average team."
