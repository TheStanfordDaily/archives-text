# Internet blues
## Networking glitches cause weekend of woes 
### Arthur Hu Editorial staff 
Several unrelated computer problems
caused users headaches across campus this
weekend: the failure of the Wilbur subnet and
the problems with Residential Computing and
Leland servers.
The Wilbur subnet, or subdivision of the In
ternet, went down on Friday night at around H
p.m., according to Alex Campbell, the Otero
resident computer coordinator.
"1 was showing someone something in the
cluster, and suddenly all the cluster computers
weren't working correctly." he said. "I went in
and checked [the Internet connection] in my
room, and it wasn't working either."
Campbell said he then called the appropriate

people, and by 11 p.m. the subnet was back up
and normal Internet use could resume.
During the outage, nobody on the Wilbur
subnet was able to use an Internet connection.
In addition. Res Comp servers were having
trouble this weekend as well, according to
Eddie Dinel. the RCC in Adams House.
The Res Comp Key Server, which checks out
electronic keys to every user who wants to use a
certain keyed program, such as Microsoft
Word, went down on Saturday. Dinel said.
As a result, users in dorm clusters were un
able to use any such keyed programs for the du
ration that the Key Server was not functioning.
The print spooler at Res Comp also went
down, so that users in dorm clusters were not
able to print. In addition, students were not able
to use keyed programs.

Dinel said. "We found somebody with keys
to the Res Comp building, and once we man
aged to get inside, it did not take very long to fix
the problems
"Basically, it was a matter of going into the
building and rebooting all the machines that
were down." he added, though the print spooler
and the Res Comp server itself required some
more time before they functioned correctly.
Tom Fountain, a Kimball RC(\ said. "I only
had a couple of complaints, as most of the resi
dents were more than happy to go to Tresidder
or Meyer."
"Actually, the most startling thing was that
so few people mentioned [the network out
age]." C ampbell said.
