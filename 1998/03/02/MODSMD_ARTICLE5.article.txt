### Bimal Shah Senior staff writer 
Artists Christo and Jeanne-
Claude will kick off the new Stan
ford Presidential Lectures and Sym
posia in the Humanities and Arts
today with a lecture at 5 p.m. in An
nenberg Auditorium.
The Christos. as husband and
wife, will discuss two of their on
going projects â€” "The Gates." a
project for New York City's Central
Park, and "Over the River." a pro
ject for the Arkansas River in Col
orado.
The evening will begin with a

slide show, followed by a question
and-answer session and a book sign
ing.
The Bookstore currently has the
Christos' materials on sale.
From 10 to 11:30 a.m. tomorrow,
the Christos will continue the ques
tion-and-answer session from the
evening before. This discussion will
only be open to students who at
tended the lecture although both the
lecture and the subsequent session
are free.
"We enjoy lecturing very much
to students." the Chnstos said, not
ing that they speak all over the
world. The Christos want their audi

ence to learn about their philosophy
and are willing to answer questions
about their art and their lives.
The Christos are the first of 20
distinguished humanists who will
visit Stanford during the next two
and-a-half years University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper has also set
aside Si 2 million to fund four ne*
professorships in the arts and hu
manities.
The new programs are meant to
transform the humanities into a
"more visible and dynamic partici
pant in shaping, enriching and chal
lenging the intellectual agenda
across the University," Casper said

in his State of the University address
in October.
The guests for the series were
chosen through a multi-step process
that included input from the Univer
sity community.
The Christos arc best known for
uhat they describe as large-scale en
vironmental works, which they
often \*rap or drape fabric over.
The artists have wrapped a
stretch of coastline in Sydney,
stretched an orange "Valley Cur
tain" across a canyon in Rifle. Colo.,
erected a 24-mile "Running Fence"
