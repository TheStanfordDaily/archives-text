Somebody
HAD TO
SAY IT.
Now
Vincent
Bugliosi
DOES.
The Paula Jones case has sparked a
crisis in the White House. And it's
the direct fallout, claims Vincent
Bugl iosi, of the Supreme Court's
flawed decision to allow the Jones
trial to proceed during Clinton's
presidency. In NO ISLAND OF
SANITY, the author of Outrage:
The Five Reasons Why O.J.
Simpson Got Away with Murder
puts forth a searing examination
of how the ruling came about—
and how it is emblematic of the
general legal insanity that's sweep
ing our country.
