# Major housing changes announced
## Changes to Draw process, all-frosh dorms in works 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
Starting this fall, Faisan, Cedro and Soto
will become all-freshman dorms, Toyon Hall
will become an all-sophomore dorm and
Kimball Hall will become an upperclass
dorm, the Residential Programs Implemen
tation Group announced yesterday.
These changes address two issues raised
by this fall's report from the Task Force on
Residential Programs and Student Housing
for Undergraduates: the request for more all
freshman housing and the advising needs of
sophomores.
"These changes focus on the real impor
tance on getting students started out in the
first two years and getting them connected in
an exciting and challenging way to the intel
lectual and social aspects of the I Iniversity."
said Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Ramon Saldfvar.
The implementation group, chaired by
Saldfvar and Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya, also made changes to the
Draw. Under the new system, students will
find out their Draw numbers before they rank
their housing preferences.
From April 15 to 22, Draw groups must
register as a group with Housing Assignment
Services. After April 22. lottery numbers will
be announced, and Draw groups will then

have until May 10 to turn in their preference
sheets. The date of release for final Draw re
sults will still be May 24.
In another change, Draw groups may
change their preferences up until the May 10
deadline.
The all-freshman housing comes in re
sponse to increased freshman demand. This
year. 1,168 incoming freshmen requested all
freshman dorms, and only or 68 percent,
could be accommodated. The new system has
1.017 slots in all-freshman dorms.
The number of freshmen in the remaining

four-class dorms will also increase.
"Our target is to get at least 32 freshmen in
each house," said Student Affairs Officer
Elise Maar, the project manager. "Some
dorms previously were in the mid-2< K. and we
thought that wasn't high enough."
This year, each of the four-class houses in
Florence Moore and Lagunita Court, with the
exception of Ujamaa, had between 20 and 30
freshmen.
