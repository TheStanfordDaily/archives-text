# Major housing changes announced
## Changes to Draw process, all-frosh dorms in works 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
Starting this fall, Faisan, Cedro and Soto
will become all-freshman dorms, Toyon Hall
will become an all-sophomore dorm and
Kimball Hall will become an upperclass
dorm, the Residential Programs Implemen
tation Group announced yesterday.
These changes address two issues raised
by this fall's report from the Task Force on
Residential Programs and Student Housing
for Undergraduates: the request for more all
freshman housing and the advising needs of
sophomores.
"These changes focus on the real impor
tance on getting students started out in the
first two years and getting them connected in
an exciting and challenging way to the intel
lectual and social aspects of the I Iniversity."
said Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Ramon Saldfvar.
The implementation group, chaired by
Saldfvar and Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya, also made changes to the
Draw. Under the new system, students will
find out their Draw numbers before they rank
their housing preferences.
From April 15 to 22, Draw groups must
register as a group with Housing Assignment
Services. After April 22. lottery numbers will
be announced, and Draw groups will then

have until May 10 to turn in their preference
sheets. The date of release for final Draw re
sults will still be May 24.
In another change, Draw groups may
change their preferences up until the May 10
deadline.
The all-freshman housing comes in re
sponse to increased freshman demand. This
year. 1,168 incoming freshmen requested all
freshman dorms, and only or 68 percent,
could be accommodated. The new system has
1.017 slots in all-freshman dorms.
The number of freshmen in the remaining

four-class dorms will also increase.
"Our target is to get at least 32 freshmen in
each house," said Student Affairs Officer
Elise Maar, the project manager. "Some
dorms previously were in the mid-2< K. and we
thought that wasn't high enough."
This year, each of the four-class houses in
Florence Moore and Lagunita Court, with the
exception of Ujamaa, had between 20 and 30
freshmen.
In order to fill the three newly converted


Maggie Weidner â€” Daily
all-freshman dorms, freshmen will no
longer live in Kimball or Toyon.
Many of Kimball's residents, in
cluding the resident fellow. Linguis
tics Prof. John Rickford. were less
than enthusiastic about this decision.
"A number of us in the dorm ex
pressed sentiments for keeping Kim
ball as a four-class dorm." Rickford
said. "We conveyed those feelings to
[Residential Education Director

Jane] Camarillo and Montoya, who
came to talk to us."
Rickford added that he enjoys the
energy freshmen add to a dorm.
"I like the exchange of informa
tion and camaraderie in both direc
tions." he said. "Freshmen create a
greater dorm-wide excitement and
interest in programming."
RFs in the new all-freshman
dorms were excited about the restruc
turing.
"We're looking forward to having
another all-frosh dorm," said East Flo
Mo RF Anne Rovaltv. "We've al

ways enjoyed the energy of Alondra,
another all-frosh house here."
The idea of creating an all-sopho
more dorm, while not part of the orig
inal task force report, is the change
the implementation group seems
happiest about.
"The sophomore focus housing
has captured my imagination, he
cause it gives us an opportunity to
better meet the advising needs of
sophomores as well as create a social
setting for them," Montoya said.
The plan for programming in
Toyon will largely be based on expe

rience with programming for Sopho
more College, a three-week resi
dence-based summer program for in
coming sophomores.
Some changes proposed by the
task force were postponed due to
technical difficulties, including the
enlargement of the number of prefer
ences students can mark on their
Draw sheet and the creation of a
"premier year" that guaranteed stu
dents a Draw number of 1.2(X) or
higher. Other changes possible for
the 1999-2000 year include a fresh
man-sophomore housing cluster.
