Politicians debate conservation
WASHINGTON (AP) — Forest Service Chief Mike
Dombeck, saying conservation is not a special interest but "a
national priority/' outlined an aggressive agenda yesterday to
preserve forests and their watersheds.
1 le acknowledged that the agency's efforts to slow logging in
the national forests have sparked criticism on Capitol Hill.
"Ours are not easy jobs." Dombeck said in a speech to 3(H)
Forest Service staff. "We often find ourselves caught in the midst
of social changes, shifting priorities and political crosscurrents."
His boss. Assistant Agriculture Secretary James Lyons, said
GOP lawmakers tried "to scare the hell out of our employees"
last week by threatening steep cuts in the agency's budget.
Western Republicans are upset at the steady decline in feder
al timber harvests under the Clinton administration's logging
policies. Dombeck and Lyons are scheduled to testify today
before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee,
chaired by Sen. Frank Murkowski. R-Alaska.
Last week. Minkowski and others wrote to Dombeck asking
him to figure out how much money the agency could save if the
forest Service virtually shut down commercial logging, recre
ation and other programs in the national forests.
Gates defends Microsoft
WAS! lINGTON (AP) A day before his company's busi
ness practices were expected to be attacked at a Senate hearing.
Mill dates came to Washington yesterday to engage in a little
diplomacy Microsoft-style.
Sitting casually on a senator's desk in the glare of TV lights.
Gates calmly explained that lie's fighting to protect his compa
ny's right to innovate.
Microsoft has "a huge number of competitors, and yet we've
been able to stay in front of them by keeping our prices very
10w... and constantly improving our products," Gates told

reporters at a briefing in the office of Sen. Slade Gorton. R-
Wash.. who was not present.
The Senate Judiciary Committee holds a second hearing
today into anticompetitive issues and technology, which focus on
the Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft Corp. and its latest legal
troubles with state and federal antitrust investigators.
Meanwhile, attorneys general of 27 states filed a friend-of
the-eourt brief supporting the Justice lawsuit. The brief express
es the fear that Microsoft "could prevent competing and poten
tially competing products from getting a fair market test."
Microsoft also ajuioujiced it modified agreements s<> Internet
service providers that have deals with the company also will be
allowed to promote Web browsers made by competitors.
Cause of dyslexia discovered
WAS! 11 N( i I ()N (AP) Imaging techniques that detect the
brain's inner workings show for the first time that a part critical
to reading has an impaired function in people with dyslexia.
"This provides evidence that dyslexia is a real biological enti
ty." said Dr. Sally F. Shaywitz, a Yale University School of
Medicine researcher.
She described the problem as "a glitch in the circuitry for
reading" that makes it more difficult for dyslexics to link printed
letters and words instinctively with the language sounds the let
ters and words represent.
Such linkage, said Shaywitz. is essential for learning to read
and is accomplished routinely in people with a normal connec
tion between parts of the brain that control language and vision.
Shaywitz is lead author in a study to be published today in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
To identify the brain circuitry problem. Shaywitz and her
colleagues used a technique called functional magnetic reso
nance imaging. I his technology allows researchers to observe
which parts of a subject's brain are active when a specific func
tion is performed.
