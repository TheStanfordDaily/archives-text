The Security ( ouncil reached ten
tative agreement yesterday on a
resolution warning Iraq of "sever
est consequences" if it violates an
arms inspection deal.
But agreement came only after
several members insisted on guar
antees that it would not give auto
matic approval for a military
attack if Iraq breaks the accord.
The council scheduled a vote
for yesterday evening after diplo
matic sources, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity, said China
became the last of the 15 members
to agree to the oft-revised text.
" This is a very clear, strong res
olution that we are very pleased
with that will now go into force,"
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson
said before the vote.
Since last week, the British and
Japanese, who sponsored the reso
lution. have circulated several ver
sions in an attempt to satisfy all
council members. The original
draft warned Iraq of "severest
consequences" if it violated the
accord.
That was softened Friday to
"very serious consequences," but
in an apparent attempt to placate
Washington, the "severest conse

quences phrase was reinserted
into the text yesterday.
But the difficulties encountered
in reaching a consensus cast doubt
on the Clinton administration's
claims that if Iraq violated the deal
there would be strong internation
al support for military action.
During lengthy meetings
throughout the day, envoys from
such countries as Brazil, Costa
Rica and Portugal, which normal
ly support the U.S. stand against
Iraq, made clear they opposed any
resolution that would give Wash
ington a blank check for an attack
if Iraq doesn't honor the accord.
"It is very clear that only the
Security Council has the authority
to approve an armed military
action," said Costa Rican Ambas
sador Fernando Berrocal Soto.
The United States has main
tained that it has sufficient author
ity to use force under several reso
lutions enacted since IV9I. But
France. Russia, China and others
dispute that interpretation.
In Baghdad yesterday. Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
told CNN the proposed resolution
is an attempt by the United States
and Britain to lay the foundation
for an attack.
