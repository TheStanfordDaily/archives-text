Recognize those who've
significantly shaped your
Stanford experience

AS DEAD WEEK approach
es, thoughts turn to final
papers, exams and chapters
of theses that must be completed
before spring break. But this year,
before your finals are finished and
your bags are packed, take a minute to
think about a Stanford instructor, staff
member or teaching assistant who has
made an impact on your life. Then
nominate him or her for the Gores,
Dinkelspiel or C'uthbertson award.
A short four months from now,
Commencement will occur. At the cer
emony. some members of the Stanford
community will receive awards. You
will more than likely wonder what the
awards mean and why the winners are
chosen.
The nominations do not come only
from the highest echelons of the
administration and the faculty. Stu
dents, too, have the chance to make
nominations. Unfortunately, too many
students ignore this power and leave
the decisions to someone else.
The opportunity to thank someone
who has affected your life does not
come often. What better way to recog
nize someone who deserves it than to
write a personal letter of recommen
dation for an award?
The Walter B. Gores Awards are
given for "excellence in undergraduate
and graduate teaching." The awards
may go to any member of the teaching
staff, from the loftiest tenured profes
sor to the junior teaching assistants.

The awards are usually given to a
senior faculty member, a junior faculty
member and a teaching assistant.
Another award sponsored by the
ASSU president honors both students
and faculty. The Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel
Awards recognize "distinctive and
exceptional contributions to under
graduate education." These awards
may be given for exceptional efforts in
curriculum design, program develop
ment, advising excellence, residential
education, committee leadership or
extracurricular education. They are
usually given to two graduating
seniors, a faculty or staff member who
has been here for 10 years or more and
to one who has served for less than 10
years.
The Kenneth Cuthbertson Award
recognizes "exceptional contributions
of all types to Stanford University,"
including administrative, professional
or educational contributions. This
award focuses on unusually distin
guished and continuous service,
uncommon inventiveness or excep
tional creativity in making the Univer
sity a better place.
Aside from these awards, depart
ments often have ones of their own.
Take advantage of your power to
thank someone who has made an
impact on your life here at Stanford. A
small letter of thanks will let the indi
vidual know he or she mattered in
your life. A copy sent to the right com
mittee will tell them who deserves
recognition.
We often complain that the Univer
sity ignores undergraduates. Take this
opportunity to recognize the kind of
teaching and attention that you expect
at Stanford.
