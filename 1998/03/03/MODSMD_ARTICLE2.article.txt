### Bill Bowen Contributing writer 
ITie candidates for ASSIJ presi
dent are kicking off their campaigns
with new ideas and a similar vision.
Candidates Matt Crystal, Lisa Liao.
Mike Martinez, Maren Norton and
Matt Spence all expressed a desire
to bring the ASSIJ closer to stu
dents.
Crystal, a sophomore running
with sophomore Jonathan Lot/., em
phasized increasing student involve
ment outside Stanford as well as on
campus.
"We see Stanford as a place with
highly individually motivated peo
ple, hut as far as reaching out to the
community, there isn't much of a
united effort," he said. "We plan to
have community service events that
bring together diverse groups in a
unified community effort."
In addition to increasing commu
nity involvement on campus. Crystal
advocated increasing campus com
mitment to the arts, improving care

at Cowell Student Health Center,
fully computerizing financial aid
and using Frost Am
phitheater for more campus events.
Liao, a sophomore running with
sophomore Loren Demeroutis, also
advocated the ASSU putting forth
more efforts to improve student life.
"I want to run because as a Stan
ford student, 1 have a vested interest
in student issues," said Liao, the cur
rent Nominations Commission
chair. "Being around the ASSU. I
see several ways in which student
life can become better around cam
pus."
Liao also expressed the need for
the ASSU to be accountable to stu
dents. "A lot of important student
issues are being missed." she said. "I
would like to work to restructure the
senate so senators are accountable
to specific constituencies."
In addition to these ideas. Liao
advocated working more closely
with University committees, creat
ing an organization to monitor stu
dent opinion on key issues and in
creasing graduate student involve
ment in the ASSIJ.
Norton, a sophomore running
with junior Santos Marroquin,
called ASSU service to students a
central part of her campaign.
"I have a strong commitment to
Stanford students and the power
they have in their own education
and the educational process." Nor
ton said.
"1 want the ASSIJ to be an in
strument for students to take con
trol of their education. It needs to be
a place w here students feel comfort
able bringing up concerns and know
these concerns will be fought for."
In addition to advocating ASSU
reform. Norton called for institu
tionalizing funding for various stu
dent groups, working to make
Tresidder Union a central gathering
place for the campus and reforming
graduate housing.
Norton added that ASSU offi
cers should be responsible to the
students it represents.
"The ASS IJ needs to be forced to
be accountable to students," she
said. "I would advocate presidential
office hours so students have a defi
nite time when the ASSU president
will be available."
Spence, a sophomore running
with junior Bianca Ling, shared con
cern that the ASSU doesn't fulfill its
obligations to students.
"Each year, everyone has a grand
plan and a vision of what they want
to do. But what students care about

is not ASSU reform or rhetoric."
Spence said. "They want to see
some tangible evidence of what the
ASSU has done for them."
Spence also mentioned plans to
bring ASSU government closer to
Stanford students.
"What I would like to do with
Bianca is create a new style of stu
dent government," he said. "I want
to see the ASSI' do something that
makes a real and immediate impact
on student lite."
In addition, Spence called for im
provement of Tresidder, expansion
tif the course guide and improved
funding and facilities for student
groups.
"Both of us want to make sure
that the ASSU will now become a
real presence in student lives," he
added.
Martinez and his running mate,
junior Matt Louie, also addressed
bridging the gap between students
and their elected representatives.
They hope to do this by increasing
the visibility of the ASSU and its ser
vices to students.
"Secondly, we believe current is
sues can be better addressed if the
student body sincerely feels the very
meaning of the 'Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University' is ex
actly that — an advocate for all stu
dent concerns," Martinez said.
Martinez also hoped to "make
the ASSU an active participant in
the building and strengthening of
the Stanford community. We will
achieve this by making a concerted
effort in bringing various student
leaders together ... to give the stu
dent body a chance to take an active
part and impact the decisions made
In the ASSI I."
