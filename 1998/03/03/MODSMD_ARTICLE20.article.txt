## Crossing over the great divide 
### 
THERE'S the
love for Lib
▼ ▼ eral Arts
majors?" So asked the
Trilogy corporation in
advertisements before the
Career Planning and
Placement Center's Liber
al Arts Career Fair. In an

editorial entitled "New hope for fuzzies,"
The Daily editorial board applauded the
CPPC for recognizing the needs of the
other half of the Stanford community, thus
rescuing humanities and social science
majors from lives of poverty.
What is telling about these remarks is
not only the assumed disjunction between a
liberal education and "real-world" employ
ment, but the exclusion of engineers and
scientists from the classification of liberal
arts majors.
Yet Stanford defines itself as a liberal
arts institution. This implies all of its gradu
ates are liberal arts majors trained in a vari
ety of disciplines — veritable Renaissance
men and women.
We all know this is not the case. Rather,
the techie / fuzzie distinction determines
how we think about ourselves and our intel
lectual capabilities.
Affiliation with either category has
become the only way for us to comprehend
our places within the University. Students

in different disciplines represent the "other
half" — operating in separate spheres,
rarely venturing out of their own majors,
unintelligible to one another.
This division is becoming increasingly
obvious. There is the physical separation of
the campus into two halves, a humanities
quad and the soon-to-be-completed science
and engineering quad. And this physical
division is being heightened by the grouping
of distribution requirements to minimize
one's exposure to "the other side."
This phenomenon is creating a chasm so
wide it disrupts communication between
individual students. We live on a campus
where the reality of a liberal education is an
annoyance rather than an ideal. Our notion
of a well-rounded student is an engineer
with a soul or rarer yet. a humanities major
with a job.
Although the University is increasingly
segregated, the issues which confront us in
contemporary stx'iety are not confined to
specific academic areas.
Hence the lament of the techies, who
have to take chemistry, physics or math
ematics (and the occasional class in women
Arabic writers) to master their fields of
study and receive their diplomas.
Humanities types must come to terms
with the reality of intertextuality: the inex
tricable connections between books and
systems of thought. The student of litera

ture must simultaneously be an anthropolo
gist, translator and philosopher. Indeed,
intelligence in isolation is not intelligence at
all.
These issues deserve attention when the
resources for students who pursue interdis
ciplinary degrees are in jeopardy. The now
forgotten concerns over the former Food
Research Institute and the Science, Tech
nology and Society major bring into ques
tion the University's commitment to those
working to bridge the gap between science
and the humanities.
The moment we perceive these two
fields as being separate is the moment when
we begin to discredit one in order to privi
lege the other.
Kudos to those who examine questions
which fall outside of neatly developed sys
tems of academic study. These broad issues
will inform our ability to function in the
world beyond Stanford's sandstone arches.
It is a discourse which takes place in an
increasingly interdisciplinary world — a dis
course this University must continue to
uphold. At that point, techie and fuzzie
cease to be terms of exclusion and become
instigators of intellectual discourse.

When I find myself in limes of trouble,
Mother Mary calls to me, speaking words
of wisdom: CIIRiS FOR TREE.
