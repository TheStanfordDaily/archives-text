Rhetoric kills dialogue
Christie Larson's outraged response (Feb.
26) to Dan Geyser's Feb. 24 letter regarding
fraternity housing is a brilliant example of
naivete. One would think that as an English
major, Larson would understand the concept
of rhetoric. Clearly she doesn't, because oth
erwise she could hardly claim that Geyser
should have expressed his ideas "in the same
intelligent and articulate manner as Remtul
la."
Leaving the intelligence of the two men
aside, there is no formal difference between
the way Remtulla and Geyser articulate their
views. Remtulla does so using the hard-core
politically correct discourse, while Geyser
uses typical rightist language. Being intoler
ant to opposing views, yet preaching toler
ance. the politically correct ideologists like
Remtulla at least sound convincingly toler
ant. Hence the use of such euphemisms as
"the need for 'examining the way in which
race, class and educational opportunities ...
perpetuate the elite.'"
What it really means is "let's mainly rely
on phantom arguments in promoting our
benefits at the expense of the majority."
When sexual orientation and minority status

serve as the preferred arguments in defend
ing one's own agenda, the antagonist is
obliged to attack or denigrate these notions
in his counterargument.
If you listen with an open mind to the gen
erally ridiculous demands of people like
Remtulla. how can you possibly think that
these people sound any less arrogant than
Geyser and his fraternity buddies? Do not
get me wrong: I am not trying to say that
Geyser's claims are any less objectionable
than those of Remtulla. The groups these
people represent are both so enmeshed in
the rhetoric of their ideologies that any intel
ligent, productive discussion between them is
unfortunately impossible.
To those like Larson who cannot see this
striking similarity between Remtulla's and
Geyser's discourses: Why don't you take one
of the few Stanford courses that manage to
preserve a truly critical spirit? Something
alternative, like a class in the g<xxl old
French department. It might be an excellent
beginning for building a point of view not
manipulated by the hard-core politically cor
rect d<x:trines so prevalent on this campus.

Victory for sororities
For the first time in more than 50 years,
Stanford sororities will be housed on cam
pus. Sorority women are thrilled not only
with this expanded housing option but also
with the potential of heightened Greek
involvement in the Stanford community.
The campaign for the reinstitution of
campus sorority housing has been an ongo
ing effort for more than five years.
We would like to take this opportunity to
thank the University administrators and
staff, members of the Greek Housing Com
mittee and Greek Task Force, and the Greek
and non-Greek students who rallied behind
this cause.
This shift represents a monumental victo
ry for all women and champions of gender
equity and equal opportunity.
We recognize the fact that many students
and alumni who are or have been residents
of ATO and Alpha Sigma may feel a great
sense of loss with this change. However, we
are optimistic that sorority houses will prove
to be welcoming environments and positive
influences for the Stanford community.

Greeks do service, too
In the recent column and letters address
ing the value of fraternities and fraternity life,
one important aspect has been missed.
The weekend before last, two extraordi
narily fun and helpful community service
events took place and received very little
coverage.
I find it very disheartening that the Delta
Tau Delta Casino Night and Kappa Alpha's
Mud Volleyball took a back seat to the front
page story about a"brawl" at a Phi Delt
party.
Both service events raised thousands of
dollars for charity and both were overl(X)ked
by The Daily. Once again. The Daily chose
to cover the more sensational story at the
expense of all fraternities.
Recently, our fraternity went to the
Hurlinganie Retirement Home accompanied
by the Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kiippa
Alphii Theta sororities. We spent an enjoy

able evening dancing and talking with elder
ly people. However, there was no camera
man, and no story was sought.
Perhaps the editors of The Daily would
argue that we should have presented it as a
viable story enough in advance to have
enabled the story to be covered. However,
we've learned from past experience that the
chances for coverage of a fraternity commu
nity service event are slim to none.
For further evidence, one need lm>k no
further than the mediocre coverage of our
Annual Bart J. McCormick C harity Golf
Tournament last year. I hope The Daily will
begin to cover fraternity life as an unbiased
observer, rather than as the local Stanford
tabloid.
