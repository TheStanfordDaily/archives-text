# From the fourth dimension
## Of parking spaces and personal property 
### 
Kerry Rodgers

THERE IS NO shortage of parking in
my neighborhood. I live just off
campus in College Terrace. In my
strip of six identical little houses, we all have
one parking spot on the street and spaces
for two cars in back. There's always over
flow room on the other side of the street.
Since there are no more than two cars per
house, we shouldn't ever have parking trou
ble unless someone throws a party.
Yet, strangely, the parking situation has
become a major source of conflict around
here. Hostile notes have been flying as resi
dents stake out public street parking as their
own. Nobody is satisfied with anything less
than the one prime spot closest to his or her
front door.
The slightest misarrangement instigates
unfriendly scowls and unrest. Visiting guests
and overnight boyfriends have caused a
ruckus usually reserved for such annoy
ances as basement grunge bands and howl
ing pets.
The situation hit its zenith of absurdity a
few weeks ago when I had inadvertently

parked my car in front of the house next
door. After a few days, I found out that my
neighbors had called the cops to enforce an
inane Palo Alto law. Apparently, cars left
sitting in one place for more than 72 hours
are considered abandoned. Thanks to my
neighbors. I got fined $55 for parking 7 feet
too far to the right.
So much for neighborly love.
1 haven't made a fuss yet. My housemate
and I have adopted a policy of "let's all just
try to get along," though we've taken to vile
name-calling behind closed doors, cursing
those people who have nothing better to do
than create community misery.
In my efforts to better understand this
breed of parking space territorialism, I
turned to my old CIV notes for wisdom.
The notion that one has a right to use a
piece of land (i.e., a parking space) is based
on ideas of property rights. Private property
has been quite a hot topic among the "great
thinkers" of our culture. John Locke
believed in the legitimacy of personal prop
erty. For Locke, property included a per

son's body and the fruits of his or her labor.
A century and a half later, Friedrich
Engels proposed that in their natural state,
humans were communal. While people
have always had personal possessions,
Engels argued that private property was an
inherently exploitative construct.
My personal favorite treatise on proper
ty comes not from CIV but from the
bumper stickers on hippies' cars. Attributed
to an ancient Native American proverb, it
states that "We do not inherit the earth
from our ancestors, we borrow it from our
children." Simply put, the land belongs to
no one.
A few years ago. I read in the newspaper
that a museum was selling acreage on the
moon. I've also heard of organizations that
sell the names of faint stars.
We believe in property so fiercely that
we pretend to be able to own the cosmos.
Not only do we have this preposterous
faith in ownership, we also believe we have
rights to use places we don't own.
Such is the basis of my parking predica-

ment and of the recent Row house contro
versy. (iroups argue for their rights to use
these facilities based on notions of legitima
cy.
It's the "we've been living here so we
should be able to keep living here" mental
ity versus the "these houses were originally
built for us" stance.
Territorialism rears its ugly head in more
weighty issues than Greek housing. We see
it in international politics again and again,
since the very concept of a nation rests on
the right to inhabit and rule over land. As
this right gets brutally claimed and
reclaimed throughout history, wounds of
territorialism fester into incurable cankers
and unstoppable wars.
Once again, in the international area it's
the "we've been living here so we should be
able to keep living here" mentality versus
the "this land was originally ours" stance.
This mentality contributes to the daily
tragedies we witness on the news between
the Bosnians and the Serbs, the Israelis and
the Palestinians, and the Pakistanis and the

Indians.
I've given up trying to decide who has
the right to these highly contested lands. If
we can't own the land, then we are obligat
ed to share it.
This somewhat esoteric view contradicts
my deeply embedded sense of justice. When
I was a child I protested my parents' assault
on the gophers who were eating our lawn. I
argued that it was unfair to kill the gophers
because "they were here first."
Now I believe that who was there first
does not matter. It's wrong to kill no matter
what, but neither we nor the gophers had
any right to the land.
The best we can do is try to lure the
rodents away, share space in Row houses
and nations and hope for good parking
spaces.
Life is better when we don't claim what
we don't reallv own.

neighbors find enlightenment.
