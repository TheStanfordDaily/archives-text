State Friday in Corvallis.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Friday: No. 15 Stanford 193.5,
No. 16 Oregon State 194.5

A few individual performances
stuck out, but in the end. No. 15
Stanford (6-4, 2-4 Pacific 10 Con
ference) could not pull off a win.
The No. 11 Beavers (8-2, 4-2) are
4-0 at home, and (iill Coliseum is
notorious for being a tough place
to compete. With more than 5,000
rowdy fans on hand, it lived up to
its reputation for the Cardinal.
Highlighting a sporadic night
were second-place finishes on
vault by freshman Jenny Wilson
and senior co-captain Keri Mona
han (both with scores of 9.75) and
freshman Jennifer Exaltacion's
9.825 finish on beam, which was
good enough for second place.
"This meet was similar to Den
ver in that it wasn't our best meet,
but we pulled together and made
the best of it," said sophomore
Kim Young. "All the mistakes we
made are fixable. and now we can

go work on them in the gym and
get back on top of our game."
The team opened on bars, usu
ally one of its strongest events.
However, the team didn't click
Friday and finished with a team
score of 48.55, a good tenth of a
point below its average. Although
the team didn't have to count a
fall, the routines were not up to
par as four gymnasts received
scores below 9.675. Sophomore
Larissa Fontaine was the lone
gymnast who hit her set well,
grabbing a 9.825, which was good
enough for a third-place finish.
After hitting her bar routine,
Fontaine couldn't repeat on her
"Yurchenko" vault entry. On her
vault, Fontaine didn't push off
and missed the block on the horse,
missing the pre-flight. She didn't
get enough height or rotation to
get around and sat down. The
vault received an 8.9. which hurt
the team score of 48.1.
"I shouldn't have missed the
vault," Fontaine said. "Since I
missed it, it lowered the start
value and really hurt our team
score. It will never happen again."
Despite Fontaine's fall, the
rest of the team fared well on the
vault, and it turned out to be the
lone event the Card won.
