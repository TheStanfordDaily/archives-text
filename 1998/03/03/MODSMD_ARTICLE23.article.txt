## Gymnasts fall short in Oregon Beavers thrive off of hostile crowd 
### Molly Brizgys Contributing writer 
Alter a lukewarm effort, the
Stanford women's gymnastics
team fell 194.5-193.5 to Oregon
State Friday in Corvallis.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Friday: No. 15 Stanford 193.5,
No. 16 Oregon State 194.5

A few individual performances
stuck out, but in the end. No. 15
Stanford (6-4, 2-4 Pacific 10 Con
ference) could not pull off a win.
The No. 11 Beavers (8-2, 4-2) are
4-0 at home, and (iill Coliseum is
notorious for being a tough place
to compete. With more than 5,000
rowdy fans on hand, it lived up to
its reputation for the Cardinal.
Highlighting a sporadic night
were second-place finishes on
vault by freshman Jenny Wilson
and senior co-captain Keri Mona
han (both with scores of 9.75) and
freshman Jennifer Exaltacion's
9.825 finish on beam, which was
good enough for second place.
"This meet was similar to Den
ver in that it wasn't our best meet,
but we pulled together and made
the best of it," said sophomore
Kim Young. "All the mistakes we
made are fixable. and now we can

go work on them in the gym and
get back on top of our game."
The team opened on bars, usu
ally one of its strongest events.
However, the team didn't click
Friday and finished with a team
score of 48.55, a good tenth of a
point below its average. Although
the team didn't have to count a
fall, the routines were not up to
par as four gymnasts received
scores below 9.675. Sophomore
Larissa Fontaine was the lone
gymnast who hit her set well,
grabbing a 9.825, which was good
enough for a third-place finish.
After hitting her bar routine,
Fontaine couldn't repeat on her
"Yurchenko" vault entry. On her
vault, Fontaine didn't push off
and missed the block on the horse,
missing the pre-flight. She didn't
get enough height or rotation to
get around and sat down. The
vault received an 8.9. which hurt
the team score of 48.1.
"I shouldn't have missed the
vault," Fontaine said. "Since I
missed it, it lowered the start
value and really hurt our team
score. It will never happen again."
Despite Fontaine's fall, the
rest of the team fared well on the
vault, and it turned out to be the
lone event the Card won.

against California. The team came close, but lost this weeked to
Oregon State, 194.5-193.5.
After two events, the Cardinal
trailed 97.075-%.65.
The Cardinal got itself back on
track during the floor exercise.
Sophomore Sarah Harding, com
ing off a huge floor finish last
week against California, grabbed
second place with a 9.85. Junior
co-captain Amy Murakami and
senior co-captain Keri Monahan
were both right behind Harding
with 9.8 finishes.
Going into the third event, the
beam, the Card was down 145.85-
144.725.

'Once everything comes together on the same day, we'll
be unbeatable.'
— co-captain Amy Murakami, junior

"Finishing on beam is already
really stressful, and the Oregon
State crowd was really loud,"
Young said. "We made a couple
of mistakes, but we hung in there
and really pulled together as a
team."
Unfortunately, the valiant ef
fort by Stanford wasn't good
enough to beat the Beavers.
Exaltacion, Canada's defend
ing beam champion, hit her beam
set and scored a 9.825, and Mu
rakami scored a 9.775. However,
minor mistakes along the way

caught up to the Cardinal and the
Beavers clinched the win with a
strong floor exercise score of
49.025.
Oregon State junior Megan
Murphy won the all-around, fol
lowed by teammate Deanne
Droegemueller. Murakami led
the Cardinal and scored a 38.8.
"They looked good, but we can
compete with them," Fontaine
said. "It just wasn't quite there
today and we definitely don't
want this to happen again."
An individual team's record
means little in the world of gym
nastics. However, both Oregon
State and Stanford are in the hunt
for second place in the region.

The rankings have very little to do
with postseason competition ex
cept for determining the order the
teams will compete on the sepa
rate events at NCAA Regionals.
Head coach Mark Cook wanted
his team to place second so it
would start on bars, the order the
team prefers, although Cook says
his team is prepared to start on
any event.
"We're still putting everything
together," Murakami said. "Once
everything comes together on the
same day, we'll be unbeatable."
