"We certainly didn't play our best ball
this past weekend," said Stanford coach
John Rittman. "Though Long Beach played
well, we had five errors in both games. We
made mistakes against a team that punishes
you if you make mistakes."
In the first game of the tourney against
Long Beach (11-4), the Card jumped out to
a 3-0 lead in the top of the first inning but
didn't score the rest of the game. The 49ers
managed two runs in the bottom of the first
without ever hitting the ball out of the in
field.
"Against Long Beach, we sat on the runs
we scored early in the game," said junior
pitcher Marcy Crouch. "We didn't hit the
ball in the clutch situations and made some
errors in the field, which gave them some

runs.
"However, after losing 4-3 to Long Beach
when we knew we didn't play our best, we
displayed our ability to regroup as we came
out against Fullerton and scored six in the
first inning."
The Card collected only four hits against
the 49ers, its lowest total of the season.
Crouch had half of the hits for the Card and
was responsible for all of the runs, going 2 for
3 with three RBIs on a three-run homer in
the first.
Against San Diego State, Stanford was
led by the hitting of junior Michele Acosta,
who went 2 for 3 with two runs and four
RBIs. Junior Becky Blevins allowed only
one run on four hits while striking out four to
improve her record to4-oon the season. The
Card capitalized on four Aztec errors, scor
ing eight runs on only five hits, which caused
only four of the eight runs to be earned.
In the next day of action. Stanford met an
Eastern Michigan squad that would have
been better served had it shown up to play
ball. The Card embarrassed Eastern Michi
gan 13-0. Stanford had a total of 14 hits, with
five Stanford players recording multiple hits.
Blevins and senior Jessica Schulman
combined forces on the mound for the four
hit shutout. Blevins allowed two hits while
whiffing three, and Schulman gave up two
hits and struck out one.
Stanford squared off next against the Vir
ginia Cavaliers. The Cavs got things started
quickly in the first with a run-scoring single.
The Card responded in the bottom half of
the inning when junior Michelle Schneider
scored on a single by Crouch to tie the game
at one apiece.

Junior Marcy Crouch, a starting pitcher for the
Cardinal, also shined on the offensive side of the
plate this weekend, going 2 for 3 with three RBIs
on a three-run homer in the team's first game
against Long Beach State.
The game remained a 1-1 tie until
the Card scored in the bottom of the
eighth inning to get the victory.
Crouch went the distance for the
Card, allowing five hits and striking
out four.
In its second meeting with Long

Beach, the scoring started early, as
Long Beach got two runs home in the
top of the first and Stanford scored
three in the bottom of the inning.
The Card could not manage to
score again in the game, hut Long
Beach was able to score two more
in the top of the fifth to seal the vic
tory.
Stanford committed two errors in
the game, giving Long Beach the

two important unearned runs that
sealed the win. Crouch pitched four
innings for the Card, giving up six
hits and four runs, and Blevins
pitched three scoreless innings in
which she allowed only two hits.
"At this level, not every game is
going to be perfect." Rittman said.
"As a team, we are learning what it
takes to win when we don't have our
best stuff."
