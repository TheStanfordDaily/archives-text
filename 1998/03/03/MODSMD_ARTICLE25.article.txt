that we have."

Shaw, a junior, and freshman Shan
non Montague for first place. Then

Due to a minor neck injury, ju
nior Catherine Chen did not com

around to compensate for her ab

Stanford's home meet this Satur
day.
Stanford's synchro team is un
defeated so far this season, with
nine wins.
Last weekend's meet at Cal was
another stepping stone toward na
tionals.
"We're probably the strongest
we've ever been," Enos said.
After having defeated its
stiflest competition, Ohio State, at
the Wheaton College Invitational
in Norton, Mass., on Feb. 21, the
team is confident and hoping to

end the season with a bang. With
only one meet remaining in the
regular season, the synchro team is
gearing up for the NCAA champi
onships in Minneapolis over spring
break.
Last year at nationals, the Stan
ford team fell to Ohio State for sec
ond place by only two points.
The synchro team has been
stepping up training as nationals
draw closer, and is hopeful that this
will be its year to win the champi
onship for the first time.
If Stanford's team wins nation
als this year, it will end Ohio State's
13 years of domination over the
sport at the collegiate level.
"People are working really
hard, and it shows," Weir said.
