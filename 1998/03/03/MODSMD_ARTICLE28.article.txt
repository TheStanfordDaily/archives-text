WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ Saturday-Sunday:
No. 3 Stanford finished third at the
Cal State-Fullerton Showcase
Tournament

Stanford (8-2) put Claremont
away 21-1 in the first game of the
tournament. The team then went on

terfinals. Stanford then lost to Cal in
the semifinals 6-5. but the ( ard came
back to beat the host (iauchos 12-5
for third place.
In the championship game, sec
ond-ranked Cal defeated No. 1
UCLA 8-7 in overtime^
"I was pleased with our progress
and our play on defense," said Stan
lord head coach John Tanner. "Giv
ing up only two goals all day on Sat
urday was really good. But on Sun-
Jay morning. I thought we were ten
ative against Cal."
Stanford was down 6-3 going into

the fourth quarter but battled back
to close the gap to 6-5.
"The game wasn't close," Tanner
said. "We played well in the last few
minutes, but we didn't deserve to
win."
Problems came in working
around Cal's strategy.
"Against Cal we had a hard time
running our offense." said assistant
coach Susan Ortwein. "And we
didn't capitalize on our opportuni
ties."
Stanford had been focusing on
new defensive strategies prior to the
tournament.
"We have a new plan of attack
defensively," said junior Lindsay
Welsh. "We attack the teams in
stages. Much of our defense is tar
geted not just at their offense, but at
throwing them off guard."
Stanford's tight defense helped
the team shut down C'al's powerful
hole set. Alisa von Hartitzsch, which
forced Cal to use outside shooters.
"We were able to shut down their
hole ses. which was Cal's biggest
threat in the past," said sophomore
Elissa Keszler. "But we didn't adjust
to prevent the outside shooters from
scoring."
Junior goalie Heather Crary
played strong defense throughout
the weekend. According to Ortwein,
Cal's goals all came from verv legiti

mate shots, and Crarv came up with
some big saves for the Card.
Stanford's offense did well
throughout the weekend, with
sophomore Ellen Estes leading the
team with 15 goals in four games,
Sophomore Suze Gardner scored
seven for the Cardinal, and the rest
of the goals were distributed fairly
evenly among the other players.

This weekend clearly showed the difference between the
top three teams and the rest of the league.'
— Lindsay Welsh, junior

"The goals were pretty dispersed
among the team members," said Or
twein. "Ellen was able to score so
many because we were able to set
her up for isolations, which allowed
her to draw kick-outs. We played re
ally good team polo, and we played
within our system in the games
against Claremont, Davis and Santa
Barbara."
The weak Cardinal!
offense was a lack of movement.
"We need to focus more on
movement that puts pressure on the
defense and creates open opportuni
ties." Welsh said.
Despite the loss to Cal, Stanford
was able to come back and beat
Santa Barbara.

"The highlight of the weekend
was coming back and playing strong
in the third-place game," Tanner
said. "It's difficult when you have
everything to lose and the other
team has nothing to lose, especially
when [Santa Barbara has] the home
school advantage."
Welsh agreed with Tanner: "We
asserted ourselves and dominated

over Santa Barbara. This weekend
clearly showed the difference be
tween the top three teams and the
rest of the league," she said.
Stanford begins its official MPSF
league play with a game against Cal
Friday at 4 p.m. at deGuerre pool.
Stanford's only two losses this sea
son have been to Cal, and each was
by one goal. After Cal's defeat of
UCLA this weekend. Friday's game
will be important in determining
which team takes the top seed.
"Sunday's game was a good les
son," Keszler said.
"Only good can come from our
two losses to Cal. Now we're going
to step it up, and I'm confident in our
abilitv to beat them."
