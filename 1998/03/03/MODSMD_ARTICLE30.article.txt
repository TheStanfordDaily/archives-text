■ Tonight:
Stanford vs. Saint Mary's at Sunken
Diamond, 5 p.m.

The Cardinal (16-1-1, 5-1 Pacific
10 Conference) challenges the Saint
Mary's Gaels at 5 p.m.
The last time these two squads
faced off — Feb. 9 at Stanford — it
was a walk in the ballpark, literally.
More than 20 walks were issued dur
ing the 3-hour, 46-minute contest,
with 14 of those belonging to the
Cardinal. Both squads worked the
depth of their bullpens as five Stan
ford pitchers took to the mound be
fore veteran reliever Tony Cogan, a
junior, stepped in to close the game.
The Cardinal emerged with a deci
sive 11-5 victory.
According to Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess, the score did

not reflect the closeness of the game.
"The first five or six innings were
fairly close," Marquess said. "I'm ex
pecting a fairly tough game against
them. We're not overconfident. We
thought they played well against us,
even though we broke it open late in
the game."
The numbers on tonight's score
board should be quite a bit closer.
Some aspects of the game will re
main the same, however, as Mar
quess plans to give the nod to sever
al Cardinal pitchers. Expect to see
performances from freshman
righthander Austin Coose, fresh
man lefty Brad Drew and sopho
more Geoff Linville. In the last
matchup, Linville stepped in during
the third.
After experiencing some trouble
with his fastball, the righthander set
tled in and shut down an early 2-0
Gaels lead with an effective slider.
With the bases loaded and no outs
on the scoreboard, the righthander
delivered a solid trio of strikes to
eliminate the Gaels' most potent
scoring drive of the evening.
"We're looking forward to [the
game] because it gives us an oppor
tunity to use some pitchers we didn't
use this weekend," Marquess said.
