On Saturday. Stanford students Angela Kim
and Steve Macias joined Democrats from all
over the state in Oakland lor a Democratic ac
tivist training session.
Renowned political strategist Bob Mulhol
land gave the participants valuable information
on how to get their message across to people as
well as tips for fundraising. said Macias. a junior
and director of programming for the Stanford
Democrats.
According to Stanford Democrats Chair
Rafael Nendel-Flores, a junior. Mulholland is
the James Carville of California. Carville was
the director of Clinton's presidential campaign

in 1992.
"His methods of getting publicity are inter
esting," Nendel-Flores said.
"He claims that you don't need a crowd to get
the message across.
A few people displaying a sign with an inter
esting question are sufficient to divert public at
tention away from the speaker."
The program was aimed at the Democrats in
the state in preparation for the upcoming 1998
elections.
"The Democratic National Committee ex
pects a 35 percent voter turnout." Macias said.
"There is an approximate drop of 10 percent be
cause the elections are not presidential."
"We just have to accept the voter rate and
work with it. California State Legislation is cur

rently (largely) Democratic. If we can get one of
the three Democratic candidates elected in the
midterm elections in November, the state will be
fully Democratic for the lirst time in a long
while," he added.
Mulholland suggested writing letters to the
editors of local newspapers and stressed the im
portance of a centralized campaign. "Central
ized campaigns save the groups money and are
useful for sharing ideas," he said.
The Stanford Democrats will be holding
house parties and inviting members of the com
munity as well as interesting speakers for fund
raising.
"Recruiting members and finding out what
type of people and organizations can help us in
our campaigns are important," Maeias said.
