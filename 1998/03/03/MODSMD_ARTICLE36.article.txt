Roughly 15 Stanford students
attempted to learn the fundamen
tals and intricacies of Celtic folk
dancing last night at Bechtel In
ternational Center.
Some students looked ready to
perform next to Michael Flatley in
the renowned dance troupe River
dance; others would have been
more comfortable with Will Ferrell
in a "Spartan Power" sketch on
Saturday Night Live.
These adventurous students
were brought together by Art for
Peace, a Stanford organization
founded in the summer of 1996 by
Eser Ayanoglu, a lecturer in the
Literature, Cultures and Lan
guages Division.
Ayanoglu said that he formed
Art for Peace "to create a friend
ship among different cultures" â€”
specifically targeting cultures with
heated relations, such as the Palcs

tinians and Israelis, the Irish and
English or the Greek and Turkish.
Art for Peace's programming
currently consists of dance and
music activities from myriad cul
tures. According to Ayanoglu, the
organization has conducted activi
ties in Near Eastern dance, Latin
American and South American
dance and now Celtic dance..
Ayanoglu said he hopes these pro
grams will help students realize the
fundamental similarities between
superficially disparate cultures and
races.
Ayanoglu's motive for founding
Art for Peace is inextricably linked
to his childhood.
"My father was born in a village
in Turkey very close to the Greek
island of Lesbos," he explained.
"From a close distance, this island
was beautiful.... 1 was supposed to
hate this island and its people, but I
did not. It shaped my anti-national
ist ideas."

The students in the Celtic dance
class expressed diverse reasons re
garding their attendance.
Christine Mullowney, a fresh
man. commented, "One of the rea
sons for being at Stanford is to
learn as much as you can about
your own culture and different cul
tures."
Mi Lee, also a freshman, said
she attended the session because
she was "intrigued" by the idea of
Celtic dance.
She planned to research Celtic
dance and music in Ireland over the
summer.
A less academic attendee, Jef
frey Yung, Class of '92, said he at
tended the program "to meet
chicks."
But regardless of their motiva
tion, all of the students expressed
enthusiasm for the ideals of Art for
Peace.
Ayanoglu invited all students to
the events, which are held in the in

ternational center on Mondays at
7:30 p.m.
Ayanoglu has been pleased with
the growth of Art for Peace, and he
said hopes to expand its scope fur
ther over the next five years.
The program is currently form
ing a human right committee to in
form larger human rights groups,
such as Amnesty International,
about the plight of persecuted
artists throughout the world. He
also hopes that Art for Peace can
host a human rights film festival in
conjunction with the Stanford Film
Society.
"There is a saying," Ayanoglu
said. "If you are very close, you
have a lot of things to share and a
lot of things to fight about.
"Take the example of the for
mer Yugoslavia or Rwanda. Thou
sands of people, women and chil
dren are being killed. Why is this
happening? What have they died
for?"
