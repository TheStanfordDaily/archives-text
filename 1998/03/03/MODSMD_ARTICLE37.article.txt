Stanford tied for 24th in the
"Superbowl of Programming" last
weekend in Atlanta.
The world finals of the 22nd an
nual Association for Computing
Machinery International Program
ming Contest brought together 162
of the brightest college students to
compete for the ACM title and the
$9,000 scholarship, according to
contest spokesperson Tracy Lieb
nian.
Among the 54 groups compet
ing in the IBM-sponsored event
were last year's champions Harvey
Mudd College, as well as UC-
Berkeley, MIT and 26 internation
al teams.
Junior Hubie Chen, doctoral
student Greg Humphreys and se
nior Chad Whipkey represented

Stanford. Alter winning first place
at the Pacific Northwest Regional
Competition last year, the team
began to prepare for the event.
In Atlanta, the pressure was
acute. Humphreys said.
Each team of three students was
given one computer and five hours
to solve eight complex program
ming questions.
Not even the eventual winners,
who came from The Charles Uni
versity at Prague, succeeded in fig
uring out all eight. They were only
able to finish with six problems in
912 minutes. Stanford finished
three.
"The competition was intense,"
said Humphreys, co-founder of the
JAVA development company.
"We had to solve very small prob
lems very quickly."
However, Humphreys added

that working as a team was even
more challenging.
"Part of the difficulty was trying
to operate on one computer," he
said. "You spent part of your time
convincing the other member to
stop what they were doing and
showing them an alternative
method."
Not all of the weekend was de
voted to computer programming.
Team members took time explor
ing the CNN headquarters and
cruised the city streets in a rented
convertible.
One night was even spent at the
Malibu Speed Zone, where IBM
provided them with an entertain
ment card worth $75. Humphreys
said. The Stanford team walked
away with a lava lamp and vivid
memories of the arcade.
"It's fun and full of cama

raderie," he said. This year was his
second year competing at the fi
nals.
But there's also another side to
the contest — the activities are part
of a larger framework.
IBM brings the top program
mers from around the world to one
site, and they don't miss the oppor
tunity to take advantage of this
elite pool of students.
"Open job recruiting is not un
usual." Humphreys remarked.
"There's a lot of free stuff for a rea
son."
Established in 1970, the ACM
International Collegiate Program
ming Contest is the oldest and
largest programming competition
for the world's universities and col
leges. Liebman said.
Next year the finals will be held
in Holland.
