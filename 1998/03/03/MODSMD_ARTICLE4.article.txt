added junior Sara Petersen. I ri-
Delt president.
"It's an important step for
sororities and women in general
on campus, and we hope for
support from the Stanford com
munity as we evaluate our situa
tion," she said.
Senior Jen McGrath. presi
dent of ("hi Omega, had mixed
feelings.
"Clearly we're disappointed ...
hut there are strong advantages to
remaining unhoused," McGrath
said. "This has been an inequity for
a long time — on the whole, it's a
positive thing."
McGrath also discounted any
animosity between sororities as a
result of the housing decision.
"There has been a lot of commu
nication ... chapters supporting
each other," she said, characterizing
the housing process as "strengthen
ing" for all organizations involved.
Although Kappa Kappa
Gamma did not receive housing,
chapter president Mikele Bunce ex
pressed some worries about the as
signed housing.
"It's a victory for all sororities,
|but| I'm concerned about the size
of the houses," said Bunce, a junior.
She explained that sororities are
limited by national and University

regulations to 70 members hut will
be required by the terms of their
housing agreement with the I'ni
versity to completely I ill the house
in order to keep it. AI () houses 55
students, and Alpha Sig houses 50.
In that light, taking into account
around a dozen members studying
overseas in any one quarter and de
activations, "It's going to be really
hard for them," she said.
"We wanted housing to be op
tional," Bunce said. "This way,
members will have to live in the
house all three yew's."
Bunce further noted that ('owe 11
Cluster residences, which house at
between 50 and 60 residents, are sig
nificantly larger than the size of
house requested by any sorority.
In their applications, sororities
applied lor houses with between 30
and 50 residents, said coterminal
student Amie Rooney, a member of
the original Greek Housing f'ask
force. This range encompasses the
capacity of most Row houses.
Camarillo was not available for
further comment.
