# Alpha Sig and ATO residents speak out
## 
### Zachary Roberts Senior staff writer 
In a two-hour meeting punctuated b\ shouting,
crying, laughter, group hugs and standing ovations,
members of the Off ice of Residential Fducation met
last night with students in Alpha Sigma to discuss
that house s selection as the future home of the
Kappa Alpha Iheta sorority.
More than 70 upset people, including current and
alumni residents of Alpha Sig and other students,
condemned the selection process as unjust. Atten
dees were especially furious with what was perceived
as a lack of student input into the entire process
"1 think that tonight speaks volumes for this
house and its history." said junior
Matt Pierce.
Focusing on why Alpha Sig had
been selected, students angrily at
tacked what one student called "a
systematic process of homogeniza
tion by the University."
Students were also consistently
dissatisfied with the explanations
offered by Ann Porteus, associate
director of Res Ed and director of
Row housing. By the end of the
meeting, disaffected students pro
claimed that the dialogue was
pointless.
"We aren't convinced by the
truth of your explanations," one
student commented.
Porteus explained the selection
process early in the meeting.
"A committee of four adminis
trators and three students received
11 applications from sororities and
fraternities.
"This committee read the appli
cations and then made recommen
dations to Jane Camarillo regard
ing which groups should receive
housing. Jane and 1 then made
those decisions."
Senior Taryn Upchurch. a mem

ber of the committee and the
Storey House resident assistant,
stressed that the committee was not
responsible for choosing which
houses were to be offered to soror
ities.
Camarillo, the Res Ed director,
later took responsibility for that de
cision.
"1 made this decision based on
Ann's suggestions," she said.
Other factors in the selection
process included previous deci
sions to not take any current co
ops, fraternity or theme houses;
being in compliance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act;
and ensuring that the size of the
house was commensurate with the
group it would house.
Porteus admitted that she did
not know how many houses on
campus fit those criteria.
Porteus said petitions circulated
by ZAP and Muwekma-Tah-Ruk
had no effect in the consideration
of those houses.
Several students brought up the
issue of Alpha Sig's chef, Helge
Ternsten, who has cooked there for
19 years.
Viewed by many as a member of
the house, he would lose a signifi
cant portion of his pay if forced to
start over with a new house.

Another question raised repeat
edly was why the houses selected
were considerably larger than
those requested in the applications.
In her explanation, Porteus said
that the size of houses in the appli
cations reflected only the juniors
and seniors in each group and that
having larger houses would be part
of Res Ed's attempt to help build a
housed Greek community.
Student reaction on this point
was mixed.
One of the main points that Por
teus said contributed to Alpha Sig's
selection was a lack of feedback
and interaction with her office.
"Alpha Sig has an interesting
history and a checkered past. We
don't see much interaction with
Res Ed. and we've tried to work
with the staff of Alpha Sig to little
effect."
House Manager Jason Mendel
son. a junior, promptly presented
Porteus with a list of programs
Alpha Sig has run this year and
plans to run this spring.
Porteus was careful not to indict
current Alpha Sig RA Mike
Haslam, a senior, but simultane
ously cited her commitment to 36
houses as the reason that she was
not responsible lor the lack of com
munication with Alpha Sig.

When asked why no discussions
had been held with prospective
houses before the decision was
made, Porteus said she didn't want
to create a public dialogue about
the matter in The Daily.
She also commented that reac
tion to such a meeting would prob
ably be the same in every house on
campus, to which the students pre
sent responded with a chorus of
cries and laughter.
Students pointed out that if
there were differences in the atten
dance and spirit at those meetings,
that would have helped Res Ed
make a more informed decision
about which houses would have
been the best ones to offer to soror
ities.
Students also told Porteus that
Alpha Sig now consistently fills up
near the top of the Draw, compared
with several years ago when it was
the bottom house in the housing
lottery,
A student then cited the fact that
17 students had run for future
house positions â€” a sign of the
house's community.
Students blasted Res Ed as
teaching students that activism
doesn't work. Threats were also
frequently made to withhold dona
tions after graduation.
