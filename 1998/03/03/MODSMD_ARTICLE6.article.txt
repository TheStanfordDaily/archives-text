### Jim Tankersley Editorial Staff 
His ruddy face peering out from behind
thick glasses, the author of " The Illustrated
Man." "Fahrenheit 451" and"The Martian
Chronicles" jumped, laughed, shouted and
waved his message home to nearly I.(XH) peo
ple last night in Memorial Auditoriu.:
Do what you love, he told the audience,
follow your dreams and never, ever throw out
your Buck Rogers comics.
Science fiction author Ray Bradbury, who
was writi > stories about the future before
most of hi* audience's parents were born,
urged students to emulate his life in a co
mmute speech sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau.
"We all must learn to be our own critic,"
he said, "to love things that we love and not
what other people love."
Bradbury loosely structured the speech
around his journey from a boy fas
ciliated with the future and dinosaurs to an

accomplished author, screenwriter and artist.
Guiding that journey, he said, have been the
childhood influences he has never relin
quished: The Old Testament, Shakespeare,
mythology, newspaper comics on space trav
el and Walt Disney's "Fantasia."
"My whole history." he said, "was a histo
ry of collecting metaphors."
The defining point in his life. Bradbury
said, came when he was years old. Ridiculed
by other children at school for his love ol
Buck Rogers comics, he went home one da>
to tear up his entire collection. A few days
later, he found himself in tears and made a
life-changing decision.
"I said. 'Go back and collect Buck Rogers,
and make yourself whole.' I went back and
did that, and I never listened to another god
damned fool again."
In the nearly 70 years since that da\ Brad
bury has made his name by creating from his
imagination. He has penned more than 30

He wrote "Fahrenheit 451" in
nine days in a UCLA library base
ment. He agreed to take up the
screenplay for John Huston's film
version of "Moby Dick" before lie
had finished reading Herman
Melville's novel. He still writes every
day and published a new collection
of short stories, "Driving Blind," last
year.
As a teenager, Bradbury and a
friend made a pact "to grow old but
never grow up." he said. "I stayed
crazy."
When he wasn't talking about
writing, Bradbury encouraged his
audience to look past what others
think of them and enjoy life.

"Your function," he said, "is to be
a reporter to all the miracles, and
your function is to celebrate them
before you leave."
Bradbury spoke as a man less
concerned with the exact details of
science than with the joy of knowl
edge.
And while he is captivated with
astronomy and space travel, lie said
the greatest pursuit is of oneself.
He is neither an optimist nor a
pessimist but instead "an optimal
behaviorist. I behave to the top of
my lungs every day of my life," he
said.
At age 7K. the man of metaphors
acknowledges that he has become a
metaphor himself. I le welcomes the
films, symphonies and art that are
inspired by his work.
And he pledges to continue
cranking out the ideas that flow
faster than he can write them down.
"People are always saying. Why
do you write science fiction?'" he
said. "I say there's nothing else to
write."
