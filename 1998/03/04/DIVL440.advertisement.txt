The discovery of Europoid mummies in the
Tarim Basin has given a new impetus to the search
for Tocharian origins. The Europoid mummies
discovered over the past century are widely
regarded to have been the prehistoric ancestors of
later Indo-European-speaking peoples. Generally,
they have been seen to be ancestral either to some
form of Iranian language, in particular Saka, or to
the Tocharians. From an ethnic perspective, the
Tocharians are among the least known of Indo-
European groups and the discovery of Europoid
mummies in the vicinity of later Tocharian texts
has greatly raised hopes that a solution to the
problem of Tocharian origins might be found.
The present lecture will review briefly the
evidence for both the mummies and their
possible origins in light of current theories
concerning the origins of the Indo-Europeans in
general and the Tocharians in particular.
