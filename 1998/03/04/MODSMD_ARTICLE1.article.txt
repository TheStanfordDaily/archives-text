# Honors program may be expanded
## 
### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
An investigation by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies could
mean changes for the University's
honors programs.
The committee, which consists of
12 faculty / staff members and three
students, is conducting a review of
departmental honors programs to
determine their effectiveness.
"We're trying to make an assess
ment of how things are doing," said
Economics Prof. John Taylor, the
committee chair. "We're trying to see
how we could improve the program."
I*he investigation is still very pre
liminary, Taylor said, but the com
mittee is already entertaining several
possible changes to better serve stu
dents' needs.
One plan would create a Universi

ty-wide honors program. Another
would allocate more funds for juniors
conducting research. A third would
increase honors publicity.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldfvar, an ex-of
ficio member of the committee, said
he is pleased with the committee's
work but cautioned against creating a
central program.
"My opinion is that the depart
ments are the best place for the hon
ors programs," he said. Department
faculty "know best what's right for
their students."
Requirements for a bachelor's de
gree "with honors" vary by depart
ment. Political science honors candi
dates, for example, are required to
write a research paper supervised by
a faculty member; physics candidates
must both write a research paper and
present a final seminar that is open to
the public.
The student-faculty relationship is
one of the most important parts of
every honors program, Taylor said.
"One of the things that [honors]
can offer students is the ability to
work closely with scholars doing re
search." he said.
Another committee member.
Psychology Prof. Russ Fernald, is
lobbying the committee to find ways
to extend that opportunity for inter
action beyond honors programs.

"There should be a way for se
niors in their majors to have a cap
stone experience" to tie together four
years of learning, he said. "My sense
is that those who do honors get this. I
think other seniors need something
like that."
Fernald pointed to the senior sem
inars in the Human Biology Program,
which he directs, as an example of
non-honors students working to cul
minate their studies in one class.
Saldi'var stressed publicity for the
existing programs. He envisions a
"general clearinghouse of informa
tion" about honors, he said.
All three praised the timing and
nature of the investigation.
"This administration has done a

lot to improve opportunities for
freshmen and sophomores"
through seminars and programs like
sophomore college, Fernald said.
"We should turn our attention to
making things that good for seniors,
too."
" The committee has been very
careful and done very good work."
Saldi'var said. "I'm very happy with
it."
Though the committee has yet to
make any decisions, Taylor expects a
report by spring quarter. Whatever it
proposes, Taylor said, he will be
pleased.
"This is an important thing to be
doing," he said, "regardless of
whether changes are made."
