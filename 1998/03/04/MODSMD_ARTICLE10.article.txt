## Jordan gives testimony 
### 
Washington (AH) com
pelled to tell his story to a grand
jury. Vernon Jordan spent a full day
yesterday answering proseeuters'
questions about his efforts to help
Monica Lewinsky and predicted
afterwards his "enduring friend
ship" with President Clinton will
survive.
The first of the three major fig
ures in the investigation to give tes
timony. the Washington super
lawyer said he had answered all the
questions posed to him behind
closed doors but was told to return
tomorrow.
Jordan, a longtime friend, confi
dant and golfing companion of the
president, declined to say what he
told Kenneth W. Starr's investiga
tors about the relationship between
Clinton and Lewinsky.
"I answered all of their questions
truthfully and completely, to the
best of my ability," said Jordan,
whose efforts to find Lewinsky a job
and a lawyer in late December and
early January landed him in the
middle of the controversy.
His lawyer. William Hundley,
told a reporter that Jordan had
been taken through a "slow, step bv
step" interrogation. Hut he did not
elaborate.
Jordan, however, did seek to
minimize speculation that the pro
tracted investigation had "cast
doubt on my friendship with Presi
dent Clinton."
"Let me reassure you that ours
is an enduring friendship, an
enduring friendship based on
mutual respect, trust and admira
tion," he said.
"That was true yesterday. I hat is
true today. That will be true tomor
row."
Starr has been moving toward

summoning Lewinsky before the
grand jury but has made no effort
yet to question the president.
Jordan's grand jury appearance
had all the trappings of a major
Washington media event. He
arrived with a police escort to face a
throng of cameras and reporters,
with whom he would later joke at
lunchtime.
"Maybe if you all behave," Jor
dan quipped in the courthouse cafe
teria when reporters asked if he
would give a statement at day's end.
His statement was carried live on
CNN.
At the White House, aides anx
iously awaited the completion of his
appearance.
Presidential spokesman Mike
McCurry told reporters he thought
that Jordan, Clinton's close person
al friend and unofficial adviser,
would "absolutely" give testimony
helpful to the president.
Meanwhile, individuals familiar
with the case said two other figures
-White I louse aide Bruce Lindsey
and Clinton's personal secretary
Betty Currie â€” would probably
return for more testimony before
the grand jury as early as tomorrow.
And Francis Carter, the lawyer
whom Jordan arranged to represent
Lewinsky, is mounting a court chal
lenge to a subpeona from Starr
seeking his documents. A hearing
was scheduled today.
"We're moving to quash the sub
poena because it attempts to pierce
the attorney-client privilege," said
( harles ()gletree. C arter's attorney.
Carter helped Lewinsky craft the
affidavit in which she denies having
a sexual relationship with Clinton
which contradicts her comments
to friend Linda Tripp in secretly
tape-recorded conversations.

Starr's investigation also pro
ceeded in Arkansas, where a sepa
rate grand jury was supposed to
hear testimony from two former
troopers turned private investiga
tors. But both Tommy Goodwin
and Bill Mullenax apparently con
vinced prosecutors they did not
need to testify because they were
not part of any effort to smear Starr.
Clinton has been under siege for
six weeks, since allegations surfaced
that he had an affair with Ix-winsky
and then tried to cover it up by
encouraging her to lie under oath
about it in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
Both Clinton and Lewinsky have
denied having a sexual relationship.
The young woman started at the
White House as an intern in 1995
but was transferred about a year
and a half later to the Pentagon.
The day after the controversy
erupted Jan. 21, Jordan pledged to
talk "directly, completely and truth
fully" about his role.
He hadn't been heard from pub
licly since.
His contacts with Lewinsky
included four face-to-face meetings,
a ride in a chauffer-driven car and
about 10 phone calls.
Jordan has said that his assis
tance in finding Lewinsky a job
began had nothing to do with her
subpoena in the Jones case and that
he helped her find a lawyer after she
had assured him she did not have a
sexual relationship with Clinton.
Sources familiar with his account
add that Jordan had also received
assurances from Clinton that there
was no sexual relationship.
Prosecutors are trying to deter
mine whether Jordan's assistance
may have been part of a broader
effort to encourage Lewinsky's
silence in the Jones case.
