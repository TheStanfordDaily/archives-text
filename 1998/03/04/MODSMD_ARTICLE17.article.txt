## Editorial Big mistake, Res Ed 
### 
Student voice should
have been heard prior to
Cowell Cluster decisions

AS MONDAY NIC.HT's
meeting at Alpha Sig demon
strated, students are out
raged by the failure of Director of Res
idential Education Jane Camarillo and
Associate Director of Residential
Education Ann Porteus to take stu
dent input into account in the decision
to convert Alpha Sig and ATO into
sorority housing.
And students should be outraged.
The secrecy involved in the process,
the disregard for student opinion and
the assumptions underlying Residen
tial Education's approach all suggest
that Res Ed. the organization that is
charged with facilitating dialogue and
building community in residences,
doesn't really care about what students
think.
As Camarillo and Porteus' explana
tions at the Alpha Sig meeting
revealed. Res Ed went into this pro
cess believing that it would be unable
to please students no matter which
houses Res Ed selected.
However, we find this hard to
believe. Some smaller houses, better
suited in terms of size to housing
sororities, may not have the number of
loyal followers that a residence like
Alpha Sig does.
Even more disturbing was the
silence which characterized the deci
sion-making process. While we recog

nize that logistically it would have
been impossible for Res Ed to hold
meetings with all of the Cowell Cluster
and Row houses, it would not have
been impossible for Camarillo and
Porteus to at least issue an open invita
tion to house staff members to go to
their offices to voice concerns.
Moreover, fear of student backlash
is simply not a sufficient reason for not
soliciting student input. And as this
process showed, the greater Res Ed's
silence, the more vicious the rumors
and the hysteria that ensued.
Finally, this decision demonstrates
that Res Ed defines the success of
community building in rather narrow
terms. Although Alpha Sig may not
demonstrate outwardly that the house
is meeting Res Ed's goals — in terms
of close communication with the Res
Ed office — that does not mean that
Alpha Sig lacks a sense of community.
After all. the purpose of Res Ed is
to develop nonthreatening, open com
munities where students can feel at
home. If students can achieve this
through alternative means, Res Ed
should not be stopping them. This
method of arbitrary decision-making
undermines the fostering of a welcom
ing environment.
The bottom line: this blatant disre
gard for student input in the ATO and
Alpha Sig decisions sets an alarming
precedent for the exclusion of student
voice in future housing decisions. This
latest move only fans the flames of dis
course. which charge that the Universi
ty is acting with the larger intent of
homogenizing housing options across
campus.
