IDEALISM. Recent
studies have indicated
that today's college
students have lost much of
the idealism that charac
terized past decades: the
1960s idealism of LSD. the
1970s idealism of WKRP
and the 1980s idealism of

Young M(\ However, Stanford students
have replaced these obsolete anachronisms
with a more user-friendly. Beat-Box resis
tant. post-Cold War version of idealism ...
Next Quarter Idealism (NQI).
What is NQI? Well, it's that feeling you
get when you look to the West and your
spirit is crying for leaving. It's also that point
in the quarter where classes don't matter.
Tests don't matter. Grades don't matter.
There's only one thing that matters ... next
quarter's time schedule.
Next Quarter's time schedule (NQTS)*/
not to be confused with NKOTB*/
represents the pot at the end of the rainbow,
full of gold and fulfilled dreams. It enables
us to remedy the ills of the past and present
and provides a chance to do what no stu
dent has ever done before. It is choice. It is
power. It is freedom. It's everywhere you
want to be.
NQ TS allows us to fantasize about how
wonderful next quarter will be. It gives birth
to NQI along with dreams of social promi

nence, unfettered scholastic production and
everything else which comprises success.
Every dorm hall echoes with the calls of
NQI: "Next quarter 1 really, will be able to
do 24 units! (even though the last four quar
ters 1 had to drop from my initial 20 down to
12. eight of which are P/NC.)"
"Next quarter I'll read the supplemen
tary texts in addition to everything assigned,
instead of just cramming before the final!"
"Next quarter I'll attend three athletics
classes!"
NQI does not, however, crop up only in
the middle of Dead Week. It is actually just
a subset of a disease which afflicts all Stan
ford students — a disease called Future Ide
alism (FI).
FI manifests itself in many forms. For
example, Summer Idealism — "Next year
I'll respond to all my e-mail on time!" or
Winter Break Idealism — "I'm going to get
ahead in my seminar for next quarter!" or
even Weekend Idealism — "I'll just have
one more beer before I leave this fraternity
party to go home and finish my paper!"
And don't forget the nearly fatal On-Cam
pus Recruiting Idealism — "Maybe I'll get
pre-selected!"
In case some of you are wondering if FI
is merely a Stanford phenomenon, think
again. FI exists in all arenas of life — eco
nomics has its Permanently Increasing GDP
Idealism (PKi). politics has its Pre-Foreign

Trade Negotiations Idealism (DEBT), and
information science has its Hopefully We
Don't Have a Year 20U0 Problem Idealism
(LAWSUIT*-
Although we persist in clinging to our
cyclical world of illusion, reality has con
structed a series of obstacles to prevent us
from achieving our dreams. Like slimy ver
min, these hindrances nibble away at every
last crumb of our idealism pie.
So what are these impediments, you ask?
Well, in addition to the usual paucity of
time, money and sweetquota in our lives,
there are pesky little things like that damn
"Good Times Virus." The whole world
knows it is not a virus, but it takes all your
time anyway because you've got to delete a
hundred messages telling you it's a hoax,
which in itself is the true virus!
Furthermore, your dorm e-mail list con
tains freaks with excessive free time who
enjoy quoting random passages from a Ger
man dictionary. Moreover, no matter how
many hours you spend meticulously master
minding your Web page, it's still not 100
percent swill-free. But the ultimate demise
of the quarter, broomball, reduces you to a
small woodland creature fighting against
the forces of evolution on the battleground
of the unforgiving forest floor.
