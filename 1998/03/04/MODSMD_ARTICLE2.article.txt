# Athletics Dept. begins self-study
## NCAA certification under way 
### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
To comply with the NCAA's
new process of certification, the
Athletics Department has begun a
self-study to look closely at all as

The NCAA began insisting on
certification in the early 1990s in
order to ensure that schools main

which looks at the financial picture
of the athletic program; equity,
which examines both gender and
racial equity; and compliance with
NCAA rules and regulations.
The process, which is currently in
its beginning stages, will last until
winter of next year. Edmonds, who
has stayed on at Stanford after retir

Provost for Student Affairs to chair
the study, said that she is planning
to begin with extensive data collec

and qualitative information." She
said she plans to interview all partic

coaches, athletes, faculty, staff and
students.
