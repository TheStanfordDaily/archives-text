# Athletics Dept. begins self-study
## NCAA certification under way 
### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
To comply with the NCAA's
new process of certification, the
Athletics Department has begun a
self-study to look closely at all as
pects of the athletic program.
The NCAA began insisting on
certification in the early 1990s in
order to ensure that schools main
tain athletic programs of high quali
ty in a variety of areas. Stanford is in
the last group of universities nation
wide that is entering the process for
the first time. Universities will be re
quired to go through the new certi
fication process every 10 years.
Both Special Assistant to the
Provost Mary Edmonds, who is
chairing the study's steering com
mittee, and Senior Assoc. Athletic
Director Cheryl Levick said it is un
likely that Stanford will be denied
certification.
Levick described the certifica
tion process as an opportunity for
the University to "take a compre
hensive look at all areas of the ath
letic program and how we can im

prove them."
The four areas the study will ex
amine are academic integrity, which
is how well athletes are integrated in
the academic arena; fiscal integrity,
which looks at the financial picture
of the athletic program; equity,
which examines both gender and
racial equity; and compliance with
NCAA rules and regulations.
The process, which is currently in
its beginning stages, will last until
winter of next year. Edmonds, who
has stayed on at Stanford after retir
ing from her position as Vice
Provost for Student Affairs to chair
the study, said that she is planning
to begin with extensive data collec
tion. gathering both "quantitative
and qualitative information." She
said she plans to interview all partic
ipants in the athletic program:
coaches, athletes, faculty, staff and
students.
While the numerical data from
the Registrar's Office will give them
some facts, Edmonds said. "We
need to get at the feelings and per
ceptions of athletics."
She also plans to put out a ques
tionnaire to which the entire Stan
ford community can respond, and
to hold several focus groups to ad
dress more specific issues.
"All opinions are important to
us," Edmonds said.
Edmonds said that the data col
lection will take up most of the
spring. Then during the summer,
the steering committee will com
pile the information for the report
to the NCAA.
Next November, an outside
team from the NCAA — com
posed of senior athletic officials
and administrators from other
schools — will visit Stanford. The

group will check to make sure the
self-study report is accurate and to
help the Athletics Department
focus on its goals for improvement
over the next five years.
Levick said that she wants to he
sure the Athletics Department is
doing its best in providing academ
ic support for the student athletes
in the program. "We need to be
sure there are resources for them,
especially when they travel," Lev
ick said. She mentioned that access
to computers is an important way
the department can assist the stu
dent athletes.
Edmonds said that she felt the
certification process was off to a
good start.
"We are getting a lot of support
from the top administration," she
said. "Our athletics are par excel
lence, but everyone can do bet
ter."
