Alpha Sig housing
decision made unfairly
The purpose of this letter is not to dis
pute the housing of sororities nor the pro
cess by which the decision to house soror
ities was made, for it appears that every
effort was made to ensure a democratic
and fair resolution to the situation.
Rather, it regards the specific decision
to house Kappa Alpha Theta in Alpha
Sig. and the process by which that deci
sion was made.
Regarding the process by which partic
ular houses were to be chosen: 1) There
were no meetings or dialogues held
between Residential Education officials
and house officers.
2) Houses were never notified that
they were under consideration.
3) There was no task force to examine
which houses would he most appropriate,
nor were houses allowed to present cases
for themselves.
4) Kappa Alpha Theta's wishes regard
ing the desired size of the house were not
honored in the decision.
In such an important decision regard
ing the student population and its housing
options, there should have been some

effort made to gain and accept student
input.
I agree with the statement that every
house would oppose a decision.
However, beyond mere inconvenience,
a house may have very serious and sub
stantial claims concerning the community
it fosters and the traditions it has. These
considerations must inform at least part
of their decision.
The protest of Alpha Sig residents goes
way beyond the small inconvenience for
people who would "like" to live there
next year. Alpha Sig. as an entity and as a
tradition, is worth preserving.
Its history and annual traditions stand
as a monument to the fight against the
sexual inequality from which the Stanford
Greek community suffers.
Alpha Sig began as a member of the
Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity.ln the 19705,
the members collectively decided to allow
women to live in the fraternity house.
In an extreme move, they elected a
woman president of the chapter and sent
her to represent the chapter at the nation
al conference.
Faced with the ultimatum to either
remove women from the chapter or for
feit their charter, they chose to forfeit the
charter, and thus formed Alpha Sig.
The manv traditions which remain in

place today at Alpha Sig are firmly rooted
in this spirit of equality and autonomy.
Housing sororities definitely helps in
establishing equality among sexes. Hous
ing a sorority in Alpha Sig. however, ulti
mately detracts from this goal.
Moreover, the answer to the question
"Does it matter to Alpha Sig that they are
losing that particular house?" is unques
tionably YES.
First of all. Alpha Sig. as a community,
does not have the luxury of being pari of
a national organization which ensures its
survival.
Second, and more importantly, such a
move would displace the most senior cook
on campus. Helge, a virtual Stanford leg
end who is loved by residents past and
present (as well as non-residents).
Helge has dedicated 19 years of his life
to Alpha Sig. With Res Ed's decision to
house the Thetas in Alpha Sig. Helge's
19-year tenure as cook is effectively ter
minated.
After being notified of the decision
only six and a half hours earlier, over 9()
people showed up in support of Alpha Sig
at a meeting with Res Ed officials.
Current residents, former residents
and even alumni have voiced their unani
mous disapproval of Res Ed's decision,
and expressed their outrage at the process

by which such an important decision was
made.
These numbers alone attest to the
strength and importance of the Alpha Sig
community.
I urge the committee which made this
decision, or administrators who have the
power to intervene, to reconsider this
decision to place Kappa Alpha Theta in
Alpha Sig's house.
Doing so would give serious considera
tion to the voices of the students who are
actually involved in the conflict.

Residential Education
is a fair-weather friend
Jane Camarillo, shame on you. Co
authoring a letter with the Intersorority
Council implies commitment to their
goals.
Yet pitting the Kappa Alpha Thetas
against Alpha Sig. a well-established cam
pus social center, can hardly advance
sorority viability at Stanford.
Furthermore, experience shows that a
Greek group will have trouble filling 50-

plus rooms consistently

In three or four years the Thetas and
the Delta Delta Delta will lose Alpha Sig
and ATO.
Far from being angry at sororities, the
Cowell Cluster feels compassion for them
as fellow pawns in the Residential Educa
tion grudge match.
I urge Stanford Greeks to heed indica
tors of fair-weather friendship (20 years
ago. Res Ed could hardly wait to remove
Greeks from Alpha Sig) and prepare for
the time when support for the Greek com
munity no longer serves Res Ed's crack
down on student freedoms.
