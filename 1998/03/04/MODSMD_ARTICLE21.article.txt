## Goodbye to Nagano's Olympic 'heroes' 
### 
Tomoeh Murakami

WHO WAS YOUR star of the
1998 Winter Olympic Games?
Czech hockey goalie Dominik
Hasek? German skier Hermann Maier? Or
longtime favorite Bjorn Daehlie, the Nor
wegian star who now holds a world record
having won 12 Olympic medals?
Perhaps the stars to be remembered are
Americans Pieabo Street, Tara Lipinski or
Chris Witty, who all found unexpected gold
in Nagano. For some, the members of the
Jamaican bobsled team — who have now
officially retired three Olympics after their
debut in Calgary — may be the lasting
heroes of the Games.
From the perspective of an intern cover
ing the Games, many of the shining stars
and moments were spotted off the ice, out
of the arena, at the rink side, on Nagano's
vibrant streets, in and out of the athletes'
and media villages and in the tall mountains
of the Japanese Alps.
The 2,(MM) athletes were not the only
heroes. I found heroes among the wide cir
cle of Olympic participants — the thou

sands of Nagano volunteers, the 1,300,(XX)
spectators and the hordes of camera crews
plowing through the snow at odd hours to
send coverage to millions of fans.
The unendingly generous and ever help
ful citizens of the cozy, rural host town were
the true troopers of the Games. Well before
and throughout the 16 days of the ()lympics,
they worked behind the scenes, paid high
taxes (each citizen will have paid about
$S,(MM) in the next few years) and made sure
all their guests — ranging from a medal
winning athlete from halfway around the
globe to a domestic spectator from the next
town — were happy and welcomed.
Early in the Games, an American news
paper writer recalled an encounter with sev
eral dozen local children. "It was incredible.
I'd never seen anything like it, and I'll never
forget it,"he breathlessly told me.
The writer, who stands close to 7 feet tall
and is therefore often mistaken as an ath
lete, was on his daily run along Nagano's
beautiful main street. When the children
just getting out of school and eager to start

another day of their own Olympic adven
tures — saw him running, they waddled
alter him excitedly.
At every venue, there were numerous
local children with their teachers and par
ents, cheering not only for both the
Japanese athletes and the other Olympians.
One time, a group of us were in a
Japanese restaurant for a celebration din
ner. Having gotten off work late, it was
nearing midnight by the time we were all
seated and settled. Although most of us had
lost all sense of time working around the
clock. I could tell that the small town eatery
had planned to close soon. However, the
owners, a middle-aged couple, kept smiling
and bringing us everything we ordered and
more, until it was close to dawn.
"When is it that we'll ever get to host a
time like this again? You all are working so
hard. Of course we will carry out our share
and do what we can too," the owners told us
when we gratefully thanked them. "We've
been too busy keeping long hours to actual
ly go out and watch an event. We enjoy

watching all the athletes right here. Thank
you for all the emotional coverage," they
added, endlessly waving us good bye out
side in the cold air.
As one television videotape assistant put
it, " I he best part about this Winter
Olympics is how nice the people treated us
— the way they all went out of their way to
help."
Also deserving medals were the efforts
foreigners made to mingle and live by
Japanese ways. However, some ot the
attempts provided everyone with a good
laugh. While a studio host mistakenly went
all over town greeting Nagano locals with a
cheerful wave and a loud "moshi-moshi,"
(the Japanese word for hello only to be used
when answering the phone), many success
ful interchanges occurred.
1 was rewarded with another golden
memory when a lively American reporter
started shouting the Japanese words she'd
mastered to a crowd gathered at the ski
jumping venue. For every word she uttered,
thev would shout back at her — first shvlv

and nervously — over and over again until a
five-ring harmony was created.
Never had I seen so many people —»
from athletic greats to political leaders and
Hollywood stars — gathered together as
one in such a friendly small place. Neve*
again will I witness from a photo chopper s«j
much liveliness, talent and strength collect
ed from every region of the world.
Never again will I do something as
unlikely as taking a heated sleigh race down
an icy corridor with the moon lighting up
our laces and illuminating the distant snow-,
capped mountains Never again will I bo
dancing at a traditional Japanese karaoke
bar with dance partners who suddenly pull
out glittery medals from their back
to shou off to an elbow-to-elbow interna-;
tional crowd. — at least not until Sydney
2(KX). I ntil then, sayonara. Olympic stars of
Naeano.
