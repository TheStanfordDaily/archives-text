eDear Health Forum,
What exactly are varicose veins?
- TCP, Staff
A Dear Reader,
Varicose veins are the blue, bulging
veins that you sometimes see running
down someone's leg in spiderweb-like
fashion. The varicosity is caused by venous insuffi
ciency, the improper functioning of the venous sys
tem.
Veins run throughout our bodies, and their
basic function is to carry blood back to the heart
and lungs. Because veins are assigned the job of
carrying blood back from all of the body's distal
regions, they are equipped with valves to prevent
back flow.
Properly functioning venous valves are vital to
proper circulation. Damage to these valves can
cause several types of problems, including varicose
veins.
We have veins that run up and down the entire
length of our lower extremity. Part of this venous
system runs deep in the legs, along the inside, and
the other component of this system runs closer to
the skin.
If a person suffers from venous valvular prob
lems. the veins will experience a backflow of
blood.When blood returns from the lower extrem
ities to the heart and lungs via the venous system,
blood flows from the superficial veins (those that
run closer to the skin) to the internal veins (those
that run deeper in the leg) and then up to the torso.
If the internal veins are experiencing valve
problems, some blood will continuously "leak"
backwards from each valve. Blood flow slows
enough to cause blood to pool back into the super
ficial veins near the surface of the skin.
When the veins near the skin's surface are full
with venous blood, they will begin to bulge and
cause the classic condition known as varicose
veins.
Venous insufficiency can result in lower leg
swelling, and in some cases, can be painful. Some
times surgery is used to correct severe vascular
problems, but varicose veins are commonly treated
with compression stockings.
Compression stockings are nylon-like hose that
are tight enough to create a pressure gradient in
the lower extremity. The pressure gradient helps
facilitate blood flow in the surrounding vascula
ture. Compression stockings come in many colors
and sizes.
They are most commonly used by people in pro
fessions which require spending many hours on
their feet: physicians, police officers and
paramedics, among others.
eDear Health Forum,
If my grandfather died of a heart attack
at a young age, should 1 be concerned
about my health?
â€” Tim, Junior
A Dear Tim,
Although studies show that heart dis
ease runs in families, its never too early to
develop good habits when it comes to
your health.
The fact that your grandfather died at a young
age could indicate that those in your family may
need to watch their health parameters more close
ly-
But in no way, shape or form does this suggest
that you will die of the same cause. lake a look at
what your grandfather's lifestyle was like. What
did he do for a living? What were his eating habits?
What about his exercise habits?
Questions like these will help you form a better
picture in your head about what was actually going
on. Maybe some of these things eventually con
tributed to his heart attack.
So, if you find out that he ate steak and eggs for
breakfast, hamburgers for lunch and pork chops
for dinner seven days a week, and then smoked
three packs of cigarettes per day, it is probably safe
to say that his habits didn't help his condition.
I would suggest inquiring with older family
members about their health status to try to see if
there arc any trends in your family's health prob
lems. If you're really that concerned, you can
always consult with your physician and ask him
how to approach your own health management.
I am certain that your physician will be able to
provide you with some good insight and will prob
ably set vour mind at ease.
