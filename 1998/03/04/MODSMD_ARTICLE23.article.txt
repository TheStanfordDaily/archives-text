# Scientists look to revitalize the Dish

Nestled high in the foothills, the Stanford Radio
Telescope, affectionately known as the Dish, is a phan
tom presence on The Farm — it is recognized and
known but rarely understood.
The elegant parabolic structure dating from the
1960s is 150 feet in diameter and weighs KK).(KK)
pounds. Once a milestone in radio telescopy, the Dish
had fallen into disuse, a milestone only to joggers and
hikers.
The origins of the Dish lie in the Defense Depart
ment's Cold War readiness program. The Pentagon
wanted a device that could be used for detecting enemy
planes during a potential air attack. A group of Stan
ford scientists sold them on the idea of a large radio
telescope. The telescope was to be built on Stanford
property and was to be used for both research and
wartime plane detection.
The original proposal, dated August 1958. states, "It
is proposed that the transmitter and other equipment
be housed in a one-story building which would be
designed and positioned so as to be relatively incon
spicuous."
The proposal continued. "The large parabolic
antenna, however, cannot be hidden. It is a more pleas
ing structure than some of the radio antennas that have
been used in the past. It is expected that this large, geo
metrical structure, used for important scientific
research, would become widely known as a Stanford
University landmark."
The Defense Department leased 10 acres of the
University foothills, and commissioned the Stanford
Research Institute to construct it. Since then, the insti
tute has maintained the Dish, and collaborated with
the University in various research programs.
Of course, the feared Soviet attack never took place,
so the Dish took on its other intended purpose: iono
sphere research. The ionosphere is the outermost layer
of the Earth's atmosphere. It derives its name from the
presence of many charged particles called ions.
Led by Electrical Engineering Prof. Von Eshelmen
and Prof. Allen Peterson. Stanford researchers investi
gated numerous aspects of the ionosphere. Some of the

more significant findings were important for their
implications on global communication.
Research topics included how meteor tails affect
ions in the atmosphere and how solar wind currents
sweep past the Earth to cause the aurora horealis. the
northern lights display.
Besides ionospheric research, the Dish was also
used from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s to support
NASA's Mariner and Pioneer satellites.
For example, a beam shot from the Dish to a
Mariner probe orbiting Venus would be altered by
passing through Venus' atmosphere. Monitoring such a
distortion helped to provide a map of Venus' atmo
sphere.
However, after NASA switched to higher frequen
cies than the Dish could observe, it became unusable
for world-class science. Additionally, increasing radio
interference from cellular phones and other electronic
devices in Silicon Vallev contributed to radio noise, fur-

ther impairing the Dish's hearing.
After the mid-1970s the Dish lay basically dormant,
an elegant monument and occasionally a late-night jun
gle gym. In fact, until 1989 — when Ivan Linscott, a
senior research associate at Stanford, and Mike

Cousins of SRI started its revitali/ation —the Dish
was using a 30-year-old punch-tape computer, a tool

less powerful than a modern hand calculator.
Besides a new PC. the Dish needed several
other improvements — new motors to make it
turn more precisely, new electronic parts to fix >

worn-out ones and a repaired tripod.
In 1994, the 83-foot tripod at the center of
the Dish broke free from its cable moorings
and tumbled onto the hillside, taking
months to repair.

Most important to revitalizing the
Dish, however, was the development
of a signal processing algorithm
(using a mathematical technique

called wavelet transformations)
which separates man-made

radio noise from natural
radio signals.
The renovation has

been successful. In IW6 the Dish returned triumphant
ly to usefulness, testing NASA's Relay Radio System
for the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. The tests,
performed from Nov. 24-26 and managed by Linscott
and Cousins, discovered a software bug in the commu
nication between the spacecraft's orbiter and lander
components.
The problem was fixed in two hours — a process
that could have taken weeks it the Dish had not been
used. Eventually. Linscott hopes to use the Dish to
teach undergraduate lah courses in radio astronomy,
creating an unparalleled opportunity for Stanford stu
dents and researchers.
"I don't knovs of a place where students can go and
put their hands on a piece of equipment like this." Lin
scott said. In a lew years, perhaps, the Dish vvill cease
being a vague artifact of technological advancement to
become a living, breathing part of the I niversity's sci
ence program.
