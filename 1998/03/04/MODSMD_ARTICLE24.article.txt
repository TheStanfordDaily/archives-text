# Infectious mononucleosis
## Demystifying the kissing disease 
### lan Mitchell 
"I'm sick from kissing too much."
This is a sentence that many Stanford students
would love to utter. But for some students, it's more
than just a case of chapped lips an a sore jaw — it's a
serious illness that can curtail their activities for
weeks or even months.
Infectious mononucleosis, more commonly called
mono, glandular fever or kissing disease, appears
most frequently among young adults in high school or
college.
However, it may occur at any age.
In 95 percent of cases after childhood, mono is
caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), whose most
popular transmission method — in more than one
sense — is through the exchange of saliva.
Once inside the body, EBV infects the lympho
cytes. or white blood cells, which are part of our
body's immune system. The virus transforms one par
ticular type of lymphocyte, the B cell, into its reac
tive. or malignant, form.
It is these reactive cells, and not the virus, which
trigger a response from our immune system.
Mononucleosis antibodies, which affix themselves to
the transformed B cells, proliferate. They allow
another type of white blood cell, the T cell, to hunt
down and destroy the malignant B cells.
While our immune system wages cellular war in
our circulatory system, our bodies may start to feel a
little worn down. Symptoms typically include fever,
sore throat, headache, fatigue, stiffness and loss ot
appetite.
The lymph nodes, where both T and B cells are
created, may swell, especially in the neck and
armpits.
EBV is a member of the herpes virus family that
includes the viruses causing chicken pox. shingles,
cold sores and genital herpes.
Once infected, a person never completely clears
these viruses from their systems. EBV may remain
dormant in immune system cells for the rest of a per
son's life.
You may have had mono and not even known it
l ike chicken pox. mono is rarely serious when con
tracted during childhood. It may not even be diag
nosed as mono.
Studies have shown that perhaps 50 percent of col
lege freshmen have mononucleosis antibodies, fhis
indicates previous infection during childhtMnl
And onlv about a third of infected adults will

develop classic mono.
Though soreness and exhaustion are common
complaints among students as exams approach, mono
is unlikely to he the cause.
"Mont) is a pretty striking illness." said Dr. John
Dorman. a physician at C'owell Student Health Ser
vices. "generally speaking, people with mono are
very sick and feel really terrible." C'owell. which
serves a population at risk for mono infections, sees
only about KM) cases a year.
Moreover, catching mono is unlikely to ruin a
quarter's work, despite anecdotes you may have
heard from friends.
The effects become most severe three to live da\s
after the first symptoms appear.
They then gradually wane over the next seven to
10 days. Fatigue and swollen glands almost always
disappear within two to four weeks.
Like most viruses only symptomatic treatment is
available for F.BV — take Tylenol for the fever, drink
lots of fluids, and get lots of rest.
And remember that mono need not sentence one
to a hermit's life. Studies have shown that mono is
not highly contagious, and that roommates of infect
ed people are no more likely to get the disease than
anyone else.
EBV incubates for 10 to 50 days before symptoms
develop and is most contagious toward the end of
that period before the infected person knows of
the illness.
It is far too late for quarantining the individual by
the time mono can be confirmed. And quarantine
would be unnecessary in any case, since casual con
tact will not spread the virus
Common-sense precautions to avoid transmission
include not sharing eating utensils or cups. Fhe doc
tor may not mention it. but tonsil hocke\ is probably
a poor idea too.
The greatest risk to the patient's health is from the
less visible effects o! mono. In many cases the spleen
and liver, which form part of the circulatory system's
filters, become enlarged.
An enlarged spleen may drop below the protective
shield of the ribs, where it is in danger of being rup
tured by a physical blow .
For this reason, people with mono are advised to
avoid contact sports or rigorous exercise for a month
or more, following infection.
Inflammation of the liver can lead to jaundice and
may require hospitalization.
To avoid stressing the liver unnecessarilv. alcohol

should be avoided for some time after the illness has
passed.
After one to two months, most students have tulh
recovered from mono.
There are no documented cases of reinfection b\
EBV among people with healths immune s\ stems,
and relapses are \er\ rare.
The mono virus's self-limiting nature and relative
l\ death rate has left it relativel> poorh studied
Yet. studies are underwav at the Stanford Medical
Center on some of the more esoteric mechanisms of
the disease.
In some populations, mono is known to lead to
certain true cancers. 1-or example. EBV is associated
with Burkitt's lymphoma in Africa, and cancers of the
nose and throat in China and among the Inuit people.
However, researchers believe that the connection
is due to environmental rather than genetic reasons,
so students at Stanford are unlikcb to be at risk for
such complications
