and six wrestlers to the NCAA
tournament," Horpel said prior to
the conference tournament.
His prediction was right on the
money.
In a tournament filled with sur
prises and unexpected results, three
Stanford wrestlers earned NCAA

berths.
Sophomore Zach Zimmerer fin
ished second in the 126-pound
weight class to earn a spot in his sec
ond consecutive NCAA tourna
ment. Zimmerer is the only repeat
qualifier from the l c >%-97 season,
when he joined senior co-captain
Scott Chapman and junior Bo
Weiner at NCAAs.
The highlight of this season's
Pac-10 tournament for Zimmerer
was his 13-4 thrashing of the first
seed, Arizona State's Sean Ford. At
the time. Ford was the 7th-ranked
wrestler in the country.
"The Pac-10 tournament went
really well for me," Zimmerer said

one in the conference that 1 am one
of the best in my weight class."
