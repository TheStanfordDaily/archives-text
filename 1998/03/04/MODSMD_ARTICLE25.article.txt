### Will Flemming Contributing writer 
Heading into last weekend's Pa
cific 10 tournament in Fullerton,
Calif., Stanford wrestling coach
Chris Horpel predicted that if his
team performed well, it would
place several wrestlers in the
NCAA tournament.

WRESTLING
â–  Friday-Sunday: Zach Zimmerer,
Rudy Ruiz and Jeff Grant qualify

"If we have a good tournament,
we should qualify between three
and six wrestlers to the NCAA
tournament," Horpel said prior to
the conference tournament.
His prediction was right on the
money.
In a tournament filled with sur
prises and unexpected results, three
Stanford wrestlers earned NCAA

berths.
Sophomore Zach Zimmerer fin
ished second in the 126-pound
weight class to earn a spot in his sec
ond consecutive NCAA tourna
ment. Zimmerer is the only repeat
qualifier from the l c >%-97 season,
when he joined senior co-captain
Scott Chapman and junior Bo
Weiner at NCAAs.
The highlight of this season's
Pac-10 tournament for Zimmerer
was his 13-4 thrashing of the first
seed, Arizona State's Sean Ford. At
the time. Ford was the 7th-ranked
wrestler in the country.
"The Pac-10 tournament went
really well for me," Zimmerer said
Tuesday. "I went in unseeded, and
it felt really good to prove to every
one in the conference that 1 am one
of the best in my weight class."
On this particular weekend,
however, Jason Buse of Oregon
State proved to he the very hest in
the 126-pound class, defeating Zim
merer in the finals.
However, since the top four
wrestlers in each weight class quali
fy for the NCAA tournament, Zim
merer's second-place finish was a
first-class ticket to the season-end
ing championship.
Sophomore Rudy Ruiz will he
joining Zimmerer in the NCAA
tournament brackets, after taking

fourth in the 118-pound weight
class. Alter losing to the first seed in
the semifinals, Ruiz was thrown
into the consolation bracket where
he won a match before losing to
Oregon State's Ben Richards in the
third-place match.
Rounding out the Cardinal qual
ifiers, senior co-captain Jeff Grant
took second place at 167-pounds.
Also unseeded, Grant shocked the
rest of the conference, upsetting the
two and three seeds on the road to
the finals. Grant's Cinderella run
came to an end at the hands of Ari
zona State's Casev Strand in the fi

nals.
The inability of Weiner and
Chapman to return to NCAAs was
cause for some relative disappoint
ment. However, the success of its
three qualifiers was a sign that Stan
ford has a well-rounded team with
many contributors.
"Overall, the tournament went
very well for us," said redshirt
freshman Jason Talbot. "We had
some individuals really step up. and
1 think the team really came togeth -
er around them. Overall, we
peaked at the right time."
Indeed, the Cardinal could not

have picked a better time to shine.
As three of its wrestlers head into
lh> NCAA tournament. Stanford
has a chance to discover an even
higher peak.
' We did what we wanted as a
team at the Pac-10 tournament,"
Zimmerer said. "Now that we have
some guys in NCAAs. we have a
great chance to send a message
across the country.
The NCAA tournament will
give three of us a chance to do
something special, not only for our
selves, hut for the Stanford pro
gram."
