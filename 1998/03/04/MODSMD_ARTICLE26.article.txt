■ Friday: Stanford 18, UC-Santa
Cruz 4
■ Sunday: Stanford 20, UOP 1

With an 18-4 rout over UC-Santa
Cruz on Friday and a 20-1 victory
over the University of Pacific on
Sunday, the Card showed its fans
that it is readv to rumble.

"We came out strong for our first
game," said senior Dara Kaplan.
"For the first time as a team togeth
er, we did well."
This season. Stanford is led by
new coaches. Last year's assistant.
Heidi Connor, was promoted to the
head coaching position, and she is
joined by new assistant Amy Fine.
Fine played at the University of
North Carolina, a traditional Divi
sion I Jhe coaching
changes came after n difficult 19%-
97 season in which many of the
team's veterans quit in protest.
Team members were displeased
with head coach Kay Copperth
wait's coaching style; after Cop
perthwait's replacement this season,
several senior players have returned
to the team.
" I he new eoaehing staff is really
focusing on getting us in shape for
the season." said junior co-captain
Carey Jones. " That will be impor
tant w hen we face teams back East."
I he East Coast teams that Jones
is referring to are strong NCAA Di
vision 1 opponents such as St.
Joseph's. Virginia Tech. and Van
derbilt. Due to its location on the
West Coast. Stanford does not face
very tough regular season competi
tion from local teams. Thus, the
Card must find challenge on these
important road trips. Many of Stan
lord's local opponents, are run at the
club level.
Last weekend's opponents, the
UC-Santa Cru/ and the University
of Pacific, were greatly over
matched by the Card.
The Banana Slugs received a
drubbing at the hands of several
members of Stanford's team.
"We were a faster team with
cleaner skills." Kaplan said. "Most
of the fastbreaks ended by a goal by
one of our lower attackers."
Kaplan contributed four goals
and six assists, while sophomore

Hedy Horn scored five goals of her
own. Sophomores Dana Katter and
Christina Gilyutin combined for an
impressive 10 ground ball pickups.
Sunday's game against the Tigers
began in a tougher battle for the
Card, as the team did not play up to
its expected potential in the first
half. Though the final score is im
pressive on paper. Kaplan reiterat
ed Stanford's lack of intensity.
"11 we play like that against the
East Coast teams, we will get
killed." Kaplan said. "However [the
problems] are easily remedied."
Against UOP it was again Ka
plan and Born leading the way, each
with four goals. Kaplan added three
assists and Born one. while Jones
and senior co-captain Alexis Pa
trizio added three goals a piece.
Sophomore Page Travelstead
helped the Card's effort with five
ground ball pickups.
Since this weekend, the team has
been looking to up its play in antici
pation of a game against the Univer
sity of Notre Dame next weekend.
"In practice we are working on
our intensity to prepare for Notre
Dame." Jones said.
Stanford's next home game is
against Chico State this Sunday at
Maloney Field.
