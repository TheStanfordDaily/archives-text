# Stanford sluggers stun St. Mary's

I! they had been playing whiffle
ball, it might have been another
story.
The Stanford baseball team (17-
1-1) crushed a struggling St. Mary's
(3-5) team 13-2, adding to a turbu
lent season for the Gaels.
St. Mary's has had nothing but
road trips and bad luck this season,
and an end doesn't seem to be in
sight. Traveling to play No. 1 Stan
ford. which is off to its best start
ever, might not have been the best
thing for St. Mary's at this point.
The Cardinal destroyed the Gaels
at Sunken Diamond in St. Mary's
eighth consecutive road game.
Being forced to hold practice in a
gym and not being able to practice
or play on a home field can serve as
a slight disadvantage to a team, and

St. Mary's is beginning to learn that.
"Our field doesn't drain very
well," said Gaels' designated hitter
Olin Cohan. "We have access to our
gym. though. We can throw, take
ground balls and play whiffle ball,
but that's about it. I think we can
take just about anyone in the nation
in whiffle ball right now."

Whiffle ball is one thing, but in a
gym there are no home run fences.
Thus, there was no way for the
Gaels to be prepared for what lay
ahead of them last night.
The Cardinal, already up by five
runs after just two innings of play,
crushed three consecutive homers
in the third and had a season high
inning of eight hits. Up 12-1 by the

end ol the third inning, Stanford
kept the celebratory music going.
"It's tough, when you come out
and play the No. 1 team in the na
tion," added ( ohan. who was 0-1 on
the day."I think [we're at] a big dis
advantage."
The game was initially scheduled
to be played at St. Mary's Guisto
Field in Moraga. But. it was relocat
ed last week due to the Gaels'
flooded field.
Whether he is playing at home or
on the road. Stanford junior second
baseman Tonv Schrager's play
seems to be constant. After crack
ing three home runs in this past
weekend's series at Arizona State.
Schrager smacked his seventh of
the season yesterday, initiating the
third inning rally. Solo homers pro
vided by leftfielder Edmund Muth.
centerfielder Jodv Gerut and third
baseman Josh Hochiiesann helped

Stanford score six runs in the in
ning.
"Everybody hit the ball well
today. [The third inning) kind of .
gave us a spark," Schrager said. j
"Stringing home runs together like
that gives the guys a lift. There was
a little excitement in the dugout."
The dugout wasn't exactly the
place of excitement for the Gaels,
however, who could only put to
gether four hits to rival the Cardi
nal's IK m the game. The bullpen
was the busy spot for St. Mary's.
Using six pitchers, each lasting any
where from 0.1 to two innings, the
Ciaels couldn't settle down.
Stanford, on the other hand,
couldn't have asked for a better
pitching performance. Earning his
second win of the season. Cardinal
sophomore Geoff Linville allowed
only two hits and one earned run in
three innings, and freshman Austin
Coose gave up no hits or runs in his
three innings of relief.
"1 thought we pitched very
well." said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "We obviously
swung the bats well, but 1 was real
pleased with the pitching and the
defense."
The Cardinal started the game
off strong, rebounding from its 4-2
loss at Arizona State on Sunday by
scoring two runs in the first inning
and four in the second. Sophomore
catcher Damien Alvarado. who
normally backs up junior John
Salter, started the game to give
Salter a day off, and went 3-for-4 at
the plate with three RBIs.
Stanford has its first home con
ference game this Friday, when the
No. 6 Arizona Wildcats come to
Sunken Diamond for a three-game
series. The Wildcats (22-2 overall.
4-2 Pac-10 Conference Southern
Division) have already hit 44 home
runs on the season and have a team
batting average of .388.
"1 thought before the season
started that they'd be one of the top
teams." Marquess said. "They have
a lot of experience [and] are going
to be one of the contenders for the
conference."
Stanford leads the Six-Pac with
its 5-1 conference record.
