# The
						season in review â€” pre-madness

### Ben Hur Senior staff writer 
Yes. Stanford got trounced by
Arizona. Twice.
But as the college hoops season
comes to a close, let's reflect on what
has been one of the best years ever
for Stanford men's basketball.
Despite two losses to the high
powered Wildcats, the Card still
stands at 24-4. second in the Pacific
l() Conference and ranked No. 11 in
the nation.
Few expected the Cardinal to be
doing this well. On the eve of the
season opener. Stanford faced sev
eral unanswered questions.
Could Arthur L.ee fill in at the
point for Brevin?
How good are those Collins
twins anyway?
Will Tim Young emerge as a pre
mier center?
Who is the go-to guy tin this
team?
With only two games left in the
regular season, it's fair to offer an
evaluation and provide some an
swers to these questions.
Stanford opened up the regular
season by destroying San Diego. 87-
57. as sophomore forward Mark
Madsen pounded inside for 18
points.
From there the Card sacrificed
valuable class time to travel to
Hawaii, enjoying the scenic islands
along with the Hawaii Hik> basket
ball squad, coasting to a win
Stanford ended its Hawaiian excur
sion by walking over Valparaiso and
Butler, two teams that made it to the
NCAA tournament last year.
At this point, a few things
emerged. First of all. Madsen had
developed into a force to be reck

oned with. He was leading the team
in rebounding, scoring and shooting
percentage.
Secondly, the Card demonstrat
ed the quality of its bench. Sopho
more subs Ryan Mendez. David
Mosley and Mark Seaton provided a
particularly potent punch off the
pine.
The rest of the preseason solidi
fied Stanford's reputation ;is a top
20 team, as well as building confi
dence within the squad. An impres
sive win over Georgia and a narrow
victory over ranked Rlnxle Island in
the Cable Car Classic showed the
nation that Stanford women's hoops
is not the only game in town.
The Pac-10opener Uxik the Card
to Corvallis to face Oregon State
Stanford suffocated the Beavers
and forced them to shtxit a miser
able 18 percent from the floor. Ju
nior Peter Sauer demonstrated that
he has made a smooth transition
from the power forward |x>smon
last season to the small forward po
sition this year bv pouring in 14
points and 12 rebounds.
That set up the big weekend
when I'CLAcame to the B.iv Area
Hie Sixth Man Club provided an
emotional spark lor Stanford, along
with some heckling for a few Bruin
players. UCLA center Jelani
McCoy found himself Uxiking at
large posters of himself with a huge
computer generated King coming
out of his mouth In any case, the
Cardinal prevailed, and the Sixth
Man Hub found itself in a little hot
water.
After a shaky weekend in Wash
ington. where Stanford needed a
bu//er beating three-from junior
