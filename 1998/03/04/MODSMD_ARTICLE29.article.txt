J'his week \ anessa and I (leaded to tackle just a small
peak in the mountains of e-mail and fan letters we've re
ceived concerning our column They come from around
the globe, and h e've narrowed them down to these top 10
letters.

Rohin: Can you believe we've received such an out
pouring from our faithful following?
\a: \o rhe> must he really bored.
Rohin: Well, let s get started. Letter No. 1 comes from
Eureka. Calif. Seven-year-old Brittney writes:
Your column sucks I know I can do better How can I
get a column of my own'.'
Vanessa. I'll let you answer this one.
\a: W ell. Brittnex. Robin's actually a professional jour
nalist. I. on ihe other hand, get to do lots of fun things
lust because 1 play basketball. The world's really
messed up that way. Welcome to reality, kid.
Rohin: Let's tr\ to be a little more sensitive to the feel
ings of our young readers Moving on. the next letter is
from \\ avne in Beijing He writes:
Hob and \'a. love the column You guys are witty and
cute Just wondering, do you guvs have any precolumn
writing rituals that you like to do?
Va: Thanks for your letter. W ayne. We don't have any
rituals we like to do; we have ones we have to do or our
column will suck as bad as this one.
Rohin: That's right. Wayne. For example, just before I
write, and I'm the typist. I have to eat a processed meat
sandwich on white bread while Va sings some selection
by Rod Stewart.
Va: Shut up. Robin. Don't give away all our secrets.
Rohin: Sorry. Va. Let's read the next letter. It's from
Olaf in Bogota. Colombia He wants to know:
Dear Rob and Va.
I, too, love the World's Strongest Man You should try

Olympics. I was jusi curious, do
you til whys write the column in the
same place? I realize you both trav
el for basketball games â€” do you
ever have to write it away from
home?
Va: I his kind of goes along with
the last question. We do have a se
cret column-writing spot.
Robin: Do you think you're Bat
man? Stop making things up. We
don't have a secret column-writing
cave!
Va: Yeah, but wouldn't that be
cool. We could wear tights too!
Robin: That's why 1 ask the ques
tions. I have nothing to say to that
response except stay away from
the caffeine. Here's letter No. 4
from Becky in Mirrielees. She
wants to know:
Robin, Are you okay? Does Vanes
sa realty hit you? I noticed some
bruising last week as you passed me
in White Plaza. Can I do anything
to help? Admitting you're a bat
tered co-columnist is the first step to
recovery. Contact me, and we'll get
you some help. A restraining order
might be called for in this situation.
Va: Hey. who's picking the letters
here? That must be a joke, ha ha.
Kohin: Just a minute. I want to re
spond to this. I think we have a
problem here.
Va: Shut up. I said we're moving
on. Becky can't help you here or
anywhere. Our next letter comes
from Geno in Allentown, Georgia:
Y'all are funny. You should be on
/ V Has any of them Hollywood
fellers offered von parts in them pic
ture shows?
Kohin: Wait a second. I'm from Al
lentown. There's no person named
Geno there, only a couple of pigs.

What kind of crank letter is this?
Va: Now Robin, you always tell me
to be nice. Answer the question.
Robin: Alright, there was that
drowning cameo we were offered
for "Titanic," but the water was
just too damn cold.
Va: Yeah, and they wouldn't let me
wear my water wings. Bastards!
Our next question comes all the
way from Menlo Park. Tara wants
to know:
Where do you crazy kids come up
with your topics each week?
Robin: Well. Tara, it starts with
weeks of research, including de
mographic studies of our audience
to find out what our readers want
to know.
Va: Rob. I thought we weren't re
vealing all of our secrets. Next
thing you know, there will be 10
rip-off RobVa columns. It'll be just
like a bunch of Aaron Spelling
shows.
Robin: Sorry. Va. Again. 1 wasn't
thinking. Let's go to our final ques
tion. It's from Chandra in
Saskatchewan, Canada:
You seem to know a lot about many
topics. I 've been experimenting with
different things, and I was wonder
ing, what's the best color for hair?
Va: It's like a fortune cookie, my
friend Chandra. The answer is in
the question itself. The best hair is
no hair.
Robin: That's horrible advice. I
hope we're not liable. We'd better
end here. Besides, we overestimat
ed our fan base. We only received
seven letters.
Va: Once again, bve bye. Doobie.

Robin and Vanessa would like to in
