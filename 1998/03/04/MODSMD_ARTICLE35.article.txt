Stanford and Harvard Universities are inextricably
linked in many people's minds â€” so much so that Stan
ford has often been duped "The Harvard of the West."
Undergraduates at Stanford can be divided into
three groups: those who didn't get into Harvard Univer
sity. those who did not apply and those who got in but
chose not to go. In a randomly sampled group of 48 Stan-

ford students who applied to Har
vard. 67 percent were not accepted.
Despite the initial lamenta
tion of having been rejected, senior
Wade DeGottardi was convinced
that Harvard was not the place for
him.
"Harvard breeds bright, but
often emotionally unsound individu-

als." DeGottardi said. "Their rigid, social
structure undermines the basic tenets of higher educa
tion a malaise that will affect them greatly down the
road."
Senior David Chon is one of the few who chose to
deny the East Coast university and enroll here.
I larvard was "definitely not California. 1 spent my
v\ hole life here," C'hon said. "Some of my reasons for not
going were the culture shock, the people, the weather
and the tightly packed, urbane setting."
Chon did not make his final decision after attending
Stanford Admit Weekend, as many freshmen do, but
after visiting Harvard.
" The students there were insane and very intense,"
Chon said.
"They liked to hangout at libraries and. to a great ex
tent. were very antisocial."
Chon felt some pressure from his father, who is a
Harvard alumnus. However, he is pleased and confident
with his decision.
" I love Stanford and have absolutely no regrets about
rejecting Harvard." he said.

Weekend.
"I felt so much enthusiasm, and
I felt welcome here," she said.
Jacobs also found that Stan
ford excelled in science and the
professors were highly accessible
for undergraduates. She also felt
no pressure from her parents to

Alice Jacobs, an art history and biology major who
graduated from Stanford last year, was in a similar situ
ation.
Her pivotal decision occurred when she visited the
Harvard campus and interacted with several students.
"I asked students how they liked Harvard and they
said, 'It was great, I'll get a really good job,' but when I
asked them if they were happy, none could look me in
the face and give me a straight answer," Jacobs said.
Jacobs was enchanted by Stanford from her experi-

defect to the East Coast. The admission process, she
says, is arbitrary at best.
"It's random who gets in when you examine the top
few universities. People who attend Harvard, Yale or
Stanford are all bright, and it all comes down to luck in
the end," Jacobs said.
Other students comprise the majority who would
have gone to Harvard in a moment's notice, had they
been admitted. Senior Lydia Choi was placed on the
waiting list and gave up hope in June. More devastating
to her was the fact that her younger sibling got into Har
vard three years later.
"My freshman year, I would wake up nights and won
der if things would have been different there," Choi said.
"Whenever I think about my sister, I say to myself, 'It
should have been me.' "
Choi graduated at the top of her class in her public
high school in New Jersey and "lost" to another student
who allegedly lied on his application.
"When I heard that he had made himself president of
several prestigious clubs and got in that way, I cried,"
Choi said.
