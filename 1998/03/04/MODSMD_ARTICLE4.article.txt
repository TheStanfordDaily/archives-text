# President Casper faces angry crowd
## Alpha Sig residents decry housing loss at meeting 
### Nathan Watanabe Contributing writer 
In an open meeting with the stu
dent body at yesterday's ASSIJ
Senate meeting, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper ran into an
emotional debate concerning the
future of the Alpha Sigma house.
Now allocated to the Kappa
Alpha Theta sorority, the house
produced over 20students intent on
making their disagreement known
to the president.
"We feel that decision made by
(Residential Education Director)
Jane Camarillo and (Director of
Row Housing) Ann Porteus was
done by themselves without any
student involvement," said former
Alpha Sig resident and current Sen
ator Santos Marroquin, a junior.
"We're here to start a discourse and
to express our disappointment."
"The fact that they eliminated
Alpha Sig without student con
tention is disgusting." he continued.
Accompanied by Vice Provost
for Student Affairs James Montoya,
Dean of Students Marc Wais and
Camarillo, Casper acted as a mod
erator in the discussion, relying
largely on his fellow administrators
to field questions regarding the
University's point of view.
"Everyone would like to have an
ideal win-win situation, but there is
no ideal solution for something like
this," Casper said. "There's always

going to be a winner and a loser."
Accused of neglecting student
faculty dialogue, Camarillo con
tended there was in fact an interac
tion between residents and herself.
"There was input with the stu
dents," Camarillo said. "I talked to
Ann Porteus and she told me the
status and standings of the houses
based on what she was told from
their RAs."
Additionally, Camarillo stressed
the tight circumstances in which she
was forced to make her decision due
to the fact that "co-ops were not
part of the selection, which conse
quently narrowed down the choic
es."
Conversely, Marroquin said.
"Alpha Sig's position is that Res Ed
did not make a decision that would
make the students happy. Isn't Res
Ed (supposed] to make sure that
people enjoy their time at Stan
ford?"
A questionable factor in the dis
cussion was the notion that an in
nate bias existed on the part of Res
Ed that marked Alpha Sig because
of its "checkered past." Marroquin
said.
Although Camarillo's decision is
considered by some to be final, the
issue will be discussed by the two
sides in an "open-minded" meeting
Thursday at 11 p.m. in Montoya's
office.

University President Gerhard Casper fields questions from students
at last night's ASSU meeting. Nanci Howe, the director of the Office
of Student Activities, sits listening in the background.
"What we mean by an open
mind is to come in willing to listen
to both points of view," Montoya
said. "I'm making myself available
to hear what the members of the
house have to say, since there are
very strong feelings about this
issue."
Marroquin said the meeting
with Montoya has implications be
yond saving Alpha Sig.
"I would like to see some way to
save Alpha Sig. but if not, I would
like to see some student involve
ment in future decision-making
policies such as this."
Citing a gap between the ad
ministration and the students, sen
ator Matt Spence, a sophomore,
admitted the ASSU was partly re
sponsible for the current situation,
as "an effort for the two parties to
meet prior to the decision in a
forum such as this wasn't seriously
initiated."
Apart from the controversy re
garding the Alpha Sig housing,
Casper took advantage of the
forum to discuss a new proposition

to create a UC-Berkeley / Stanford
task force whose intentions would
serve to dispel the animosity be
tween the two universities in order
to create a more "civil rivalry," ac
cording to Casper.
Moreover, he sought student
opinion concerning Stanford's po
sition on student privacy.
Also at the meeting, the Dis
abled Students at Stanford ex
pressed their reluctance in the con
version of Kimball Hall into an
upper-class dorm due to the dorm's
position as the most handicap-ac
cessible residence on campus.
"It was one of the most impor
tant issues that we looked at. Al
though we made Kimball an upper
class dorm, we made sure that there
were enough accessible dorms for
the handicapped students," Mon
toya said.
(iraduate students additionally
posed concerns for the long-term
solution to the shortage of housing
on campus.
"A long-term solution for grad
uates is just building more grad
houses," Casper said. "However,
right now we house a low percent
age of grads, and there's no way we
can house the whole MX) percent."
