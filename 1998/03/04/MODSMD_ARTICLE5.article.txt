## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Overturning rulings of its Elec
tions Commission, the ASSU Sen
ate placed tour people — who had
not completed the required paper
work — on the spring election bal
lot last night. Among the four, three
were current senators.
In order to be eligible to run for
next year's senate, students were
required to submit a declaration of
intent and a petition of signatures
by 5 p.m. last Friday. The senate,
however, is allowed to place any
student on the ballot by a majority
vote.
Last night's measure, which was
sponsored by Vice President Ben

Decker and Senate Chair Joe Fre
und, allowed graduate Senator
Mike Colon and sophomore Sena
tors Rita Leung and Matt Pohlson
to run for re-election. It also placed
sophomore Michael Karns on the
ballot.
Leung failed to file the required
number of signatures, and Karns
did not turn in a declaration.
The senate unanimously ap
proved both, citing the fact that
both had filed the paperwork im
mediately upon being informed
that it was missing.
Colon and Pohlson. however,
had not turned in any documenta
tion before the meeting, causing
Senator Aly Remtulla to raise an
"ethical dilemma."

Should the senate, he asked,
waive election rules for its members
without opening the opportunit> to
other candidates who were denied
ballot placement by the Elections
Commission?
Freund responded. "It is the can
didate's responsibility to ask the
senate for a waiver and not our role
to seek out everyone who didn't fill
out the forms."
Other senators extolled the con
tributions Colon and Pohlson had
made to the senate.
The senate has so few returning
members, junior Senator Santos
Marroquin said, that it should do
everything it can to give experi
enced people the chance to run
again

"1 think it is our dut\ to do what
is best for the students. '* Freund
said. "It is not us that is putting
these people in the senate. V\e are
giving them the opportunity to
run "
Graduate Senator ke\in Har
rington. however, pointed out that
Colon would become only the fifth
graduate student on the ballot to till
one of 15 seats.
"It you put (graduate students]
on the ballot, you are de facto elect
ing them." he said.
The bill placing Colon and
Pohlson on the ballot passed to 3,
with Pohlson abstaining Colon \sas
not at last night's meeting Ihe leg
islation can still be vetoed b\ \SSI'
President Fmilv Andrus.
