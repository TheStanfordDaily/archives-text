### Marcella Bernhard Senior staff writer 
As administrators scramble to prevent
this year's housing crunch from repeating it
self, sacrifices are being made. The most re
cent changes, which have raised protests
from resident fellows and residential staff, is
the exclusion of fifth-year students from res
idential staff positions.
Starting this spring, students who have
used their four years of guaranteed housing
will no longer be able to apply for positions
as resident assistants or residential computer
coordinators.
Exceptions will be made for a limited
number of RAs in Row houses and the
Suites.
I'his year, fifth-year students were not ,il
lowed to fill Row house stall positions as
house managers, kitchen managers or finan
cial managers.
According to administrators in Residen
tial Education and Housing and Dining Ser
vices. the policy change is necessary to main
tain Stanford's commitment to four vears ol

guaranteed undergraduate housing
1 his year. 45 students without guaranteed
years were given spaces in undergraduate
housine because the\ held house staff posi
tions (>t this number. 22 are currently RAs
"1 know that these changes are not what
most resident fellows would have preferred
and for that I am sorry." Director of Resi
dential F.ducation Jane Camarillo said in a
memo released vesterda\ "1 do hope that we
have more choices in the future, hut the cur
rent housing demand is quite severe."
In a meeting last week with Vice Provost
tor Student Aftairs James Montova. Rf s
were almost unanimously opposed to the
new policy. Although the\ recogni/e the is
sues of housing space. RFs objected to the
loss of this group from the pool of applicants.
"Selecting a strong staff is one of the most
important things we do Anything that nar
rows the pixil of applicants .. is a loss." said
Jane Benson, an RF in V\ est Lagunita
"Sometimes the best applicants are fifth
vear students, w ho have an added year of ex-
perience and maturity. 1 am really
saddened that these people will be
excluded," she added.
Engineering and Economic Sys
tems Prof. Ross Shachter. an RF in
Serra house, shared Benson's opin

ion.
"There is a trade-off being made
— benefits to the housing system
versus overcrowding," Shachter
said. "There is no good choice."
"If space were available, all RFs
would like the chance to have fifth
year students," he added.
Jody Woods, an RAin Eucalyp
to and coterminal student in In

temational Policy Studies, ex
pressed her disappointment that fu
ture students will not be able to
have similar experiences as fifth
year RAs.
"Fifth-years bring more wisdom
and more appreciation for the job
itself. I think (Res Ed] is going to
see a lot fewer applicants and less
choice of applicants. This is a horri-
