# Survey causes a stir
## Project at Taiko concert raises objections 
### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
Members of the Stanford Taiko perfor
mance last Saturday became unwitting sub
jects of a study on Taiko and cultural stereo
types.
The prototype survey distributed at the be
ginning of the show aimed to study the effects
of a Taiko concert on perceptions of Asian
Americans.
" The results we obtained were very inter
esting; the live performance was a very unique
opportunity for my research project," said ju
nior Joan t'hiao. the member of Taiko respon
sible for conducting the study.
But the ideal subject group turned sour
when a group of students felt offended by the
survey, which was a prototype and had yet to
secure an authority's approval. "They felt that
the |survev] was particularly unnecessary,
since the questions seemed to perpetuate cul
tural stereotypes," Chiao explained.
"What are the first four words that come to
mind when you think of Asian Americans?"
was the question that caused the most contro
versy.
"I don't want the group to suffer any mis
understandings or the project to be affected by
any rumors. The survey is part of a separate

study and does not reflect group policy,"
Chiao added. " The study is my own idea."
Shoji Kameda, the group's artistic director,
said, "The survey was never meant to be a part
of the program. This wasn't made clear in the
first place. We got some negative responses."
"We hadn't exactly looked over the survey
before the concert. It was too hectic," Kameda
added.
According to the concert's program, the
reason Taiko came to the United States in the
first place was to diversify the stereotypes of
Asian Americans after World War 11. ' This
study, coming decades later, aims to see if
Taiko was successful in its mission." Chiao
said.
She acknowledged that she should have in
cluded a few lines explaining the purpose of
the survey or announced it before the perfor
mance.
Taiko has issued a statement thanking "all
those who attended our recent concert and
were kind enough to fill out the distributed
surveys.
"These pilot surveys were part of a research
project being conducted by one of our mem
bers. Joan Chiao, and will he used to help di
rect work on her project. As part of an inde-
pendent research project, they do
not reflect the views or philosophies
of Stanford Taiko.
The purpose of the survey was
not made clear when they were dis
tributed and we would like to apol
oui/e for anv confusion which this

has caused."
Stanford I'aiko welcomes non-
Asian members, but the majority is
Asian, largely due to the fact that
Asians are more likely to have prior
experience in the art.
Undergraduate Research Op
portunities is funding the study
within the C'happell-Lougee Schol
arship Program, and it will continue
into the summer.
