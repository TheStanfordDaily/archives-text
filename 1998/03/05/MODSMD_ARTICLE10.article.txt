## Two killed in Ireland 
### 
POYNTZPASS, Northern Ire
land (AP) — Against the odds,
Protestants and Catholics in this
oasis from Northern Ireland's trou
bles had learned to bury their dif
ferences long ago.
Now, in a loss almost inconceiv
able to the people of Poyntzpass,
they must bury two of their sons.
Damien Trainor, a 25-year-old
Catholic, and Philip Allen, a 34-
vear-old Protestant, died together
as best friends Tuesday night when
sectarian gunmen burst into a vil
lage pub, ordered patrons to lie on
the floor and started firing.
"All Damien lived for was his
cars and a few drinks with his best
mate Philip," said his aunt. Ita
Collins. "Damien wouldn't go any
where without Philip. That was the
way they were."
The bloodletting — all too com
mon in more polarized parts of the
country — stained a rare acre of
innocence in Northern Ireland.
"These two men. through their
friendship, showed that back
ground. history and religion need
not stop the two communities from

living in harmony," British Prime
Minister Tony lilair said yesterday.
"(These) two friends across the
community divide in a sense sym
bolized the future in Northern Ire
land. And those gunmen, in the evil
atrocity they committed, they sym
bolized the past."
Nestled at the foot of the Moun
tains of Mourne, Poyntzpass and its
300 residents indeed represent a
vision of the future being sought in
Northern Ireland's peace talks.
Protestants and Catholics here
say they mix freely and respect each
others' differences, largely
untouched by three decades of vio
lence over whose rights should pre
vail — those of the north's pro-
British Protestant majority or those
of its Catholic minority.
The residents of Poyntzpass also
mingled in the village's three
Catholic-owned pubs, a point evi
dently lost on the killers, who police
say were gunning for Catholics.
No group claimed responsibility
for the shootings in the Railway
Bar, which left another three peo
ple wounded.
