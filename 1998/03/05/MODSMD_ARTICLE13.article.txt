# Getting tough
## Senate tightens drunk driving standards 
### 
WASHING lON (AP) The
Senate strongly endorsed tough
national standards for determining
drunken driving yesterday, over
coming opposition from lawmak
ers who complained that Washing
ton was meddling with slate deci
sions.
"I hope that the happy hour is
over for drunk drivers." said Sen.
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., one of
the chief sponsors of the measure.
He predicted that the tougher stan
dard could save more than 500
lives a year.
Sen. Mike DeWine. R-Ohio, the
other chief sponsor, added: "This
problem is much more than a state
problem; it's a national tragedy."
Anti-drunken driving groups
estimate that in 1996. more than
17.0(H) of the 40.000 deaths on the
nation's highways resulted from
alcohol-related accidents.
Hv a 62-32 margin, the Senate
urged states to set a .08 percent
blood-alcohol content as the
threshold for drunken driving.
Currently. 15 states have that stan
dard while 35 states use a more
lenient .10 percent.
States that do not accept the
tougher standard would lose 5 per
cent of their federal highway
money in fiscal 2002. and 10 per
cent after that.
Support for the new standard
crossed party lines, with 26 Repub
licans — including stalwart conser
vatives such as Sens. Jesse Helms
and Lauch Faircloth of North Car
olina — joining 36 Democrats.
President Clinton, who had
pressed for passage, thanked the

Senate for acting and urged the
House to follow suit. "It will save
hundreds of lives each year." he
said at the White House.
The drunken driving measure
was presented as an amendment to
a $173 billion, six-year highway
funding bill. Coming up was anoth
er highly contentious amendment
that would seek to end a program
giving 10 percent of construction
contracts to women and minorities.
"The first battle for a national
uniform .OH law has been won."
said Judith Lee Stone, president of
Advocates for Highway and Auto
Safety. "We now take our fight to
the halls of the House of Repre
sentatives."
In the House, which has yet to
take up the transportation funding
bill. Rep Nita Lowey, D-N.Y.. said
she will introduce a similar amend
ment.
The national standard was gen
erally opposed by the alcohol and
restaurant industries, which con
tended that .OS percent was too
low In the Senate, the main oppo
sition was from lawmakers who
argued that states should have the
right to set their own standards and
be guided toward tougher stan
dards through encouragement
rather than punishment
"T his is a heavy stick This is a
dagger that says you have to do it.""
said Senate Republican Whip Don
Nickles of Oklahoma. "We are
trampling on states rights and
encouraging this idea that if there
is a problem there's a federal solu
tion and we won't give you your
monev hack "
