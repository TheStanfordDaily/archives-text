Designating Toyon an all
sophomore dorm will
improve second-year life

WE COMMEND THE deci
sion of the Residential Pro
grams Implementation
Group to convert Toyon Hall from a
four-class dorm to an all-sophomore
one. Iliis step promises to improve the
quality of the sophomore year experi
ence.
Last fall, the Task Force on Resi
dential Programs and Student Hous
ing recommended that the University
do more to meet the needs of sopho
mores as they prepare to choose their
majors.
Making Toyon an all-sophomore
dorm is a step in the right direction, as
it will allow programming to focus on
the specific needs of sophomores.
Issues that can be addressed with more
depth include the selection of majors
and planning for overseas study. Addi
tionally, the dorm can operate as a
resource for Sophomore College and
seminar programs.
The choice of Toyon as the site for
the new all-sophomore dorm was also
strategic. There are currently only 37
juniors and seniors and 55 freshmen
living in Toyon out of a total of 213 stu
dents.
The fact that Toyon has traditional
ly had a large number of sophomores

should minimize the impact that an all
sophomore dorm has on the composi
tion of other campus housing.
This would not necessarily exacer
bate the polarization of students on
campus. But it certainly doesn't make
it any better.
An all-sophomore dormitory will
aid sophomore transfer students in
their transition to Stanford. Moreover,
it will provide the opportunity for
freshmen who lived in four-class dor
mitories to live exclusively with their
classmates for a year.
The campus-wide social implica
tions of this change will unfold in the
coming year.
And the effects of transforming
Toyon will depend largely on the pro
files of the students who opt to live
there.
If Toyon perpetuates the coddling
of the freshman year, this would defeat
the stated purpose of Res Ed. Upper
class houses could also be affected if
Toyon takes gung-ho sophomores
away from them, where they often
form the backbone of house govern
ments.
But as long as we guard against
these factors, an all-sophomore Toyon
is worth trying.
The benefits gained by 213 sopho
mores whose needs will be better met
by the new housing configuration can
outweigh the potentially disadvanta
geous effects that an all-sophomore
residence would have on the rest of the
housing system.
