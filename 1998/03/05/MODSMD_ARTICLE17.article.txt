## United by misunderstanding

Most people
think co-ops and
Greek houses
are opposing worlds. But
aside from the fact that
many people still think Chi
Theta Chi is a fraternity,
co-opers and Greeks have

a lot in common. After all,
stereotypes about both lifestyles abound.
You know wllit they say. are
elitist; cp.-opS #rc dirty. Fraternities are
homophobic; co-ops are dirty. Fraternities
are misogynistic; most co-ops really are
dirty.
I never thought co-ops and Greeks could
be mentioned in the same breath until a
housemate of mine sophomore year
brought it up. He said co-ops were like fra
ternities because both are homogenous.
What does it mean to be homogenous?
Each of the seven co-ops on campus has a
different reputation. Columbae is the ultra
hippie co-op. Enchanted Broccoli Forest is
the drug co-op, Kairos is the faux-op. If co
opers seem homogenous, that only reflects
the University population.
The more 1 think about it, the more it
makes sense. Sure, people who draw into co
ops tend to share similar attitudes towards
the environment, multinational corpora
tions or stealing silverware from Dining Ser
vices. Co-opers are all the same because
they think they're different from everyone

else on campus. They're united in their con
cept of being different.
But that's not where the similarities end.
Greeks have a WASP image. Co-ops
(with the exception of Hammarskjold
House, half of whose residents are interna
tional students) are connected to the Amer
ican middle-class, Caucasian progressive
movement.
Greeks pride themselves on the history
and tradition of their organizations. Synergy
was founded by SWOPSI, an organization
started in 1969 that provided classes on eco
logical. political and social issues.
In recent years, many fraternities have
lost or been on the brink of losing their
houses. After the 1989 Loma Prieta Earth
quake, Synergy successfully petitioned to
move into the Phi Kappa Psi house (no one
knows what happened to the Phi Psis). The
conversion of self-ops into University-run
houses raises the possibility that co-ops
might meet the same fate.
Greeks are involved in public service,
and often cite this as their contribution to
the Stanford community. Co-opers often
petition for ethnic theme houses and rally
behind professors who have been denied
tenure. These are reasons why they benefit
the student body.
For me, the difference between the
Greek system and co-ops at Stanford is
clear. 1 would never join a sorority, and I
would never choose to live anywhere on

campus except in a co-op.
I was the only one in my freshman quad
in Ruble who didn't join a sorority. I thought
the Greek system was about exclusiveness
It was about joining that club in sixth grade
that was closed to anyone without braces or
a name ending in"i."
While I respect the fact that some people
want to join that club, 1 don't understand
why they stay.
1 have never seen anyone worn about
what to wear to an Interco-op Council meet
ing. I have never seen anyone reduced to
tears because a co-op rejected them.
Co-ops aren't just about cooking and
cleaning for yourself. They're about taking
responsibility for the way you want to live
your life and finding other people who care
about the same things you do.
My former roommates and 1 were look
ing for the same thing after our first year ti
Stanford: a community whose values \u
could embrace, a community that \u
belonged to. We simply chose differen
communities.
I propose this to the next housed frater
nity or sorority on campus: Become a co-op
Then you'll really be messing with stereo
types.

Wendy Lee, a senior majoring in moderi
thought and literature, knows that you want
ed to read yet another column that mention
the Greek system.
