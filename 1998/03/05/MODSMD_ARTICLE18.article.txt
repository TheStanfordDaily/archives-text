Stop ignoring students
At Tuesday's ASSU Senate meeting
attended by University President Gerhard
Casper, Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya and Director of Residential
Education Jane Camarillo, the issue of stu
dent participation in University decision
making processes arose again.
As a current, dedicated member of Alpha
Sigma, I am concerned with the decision to
end our community of almost 20 years.
The decision to pick our house for Greek
conversion involved no direct student input.
This much was admitted by Camarillo at a
meeting with Alpha Sig and at the ASSU
meeting. Res Ed and the Row office did not
feel the need to hear the concerns or sugges
tions of students in making a decision that
affected current house members as well as
hundreds of Alpha Sig alumni.
Furthermore, this decision has ended the
career of the most significant member of the
Alpha Sig institution, our cook Helge Tern
sten. Helge offers more to our community
than the Row office or Res Ed can appreci
ate. He will not be able to c<x>k on campus
for the same wage he earns here after 19
years and most likely will not want to work
outside our unique community.
The larger issue is differing ideologies.
The University feels that while student par
ticipation is sometimes poorly organized, it is
present, and any gaps are the students
responsibility.
I believe, however, that the I Iniversitv is

at fault in the issue of student representation.
As a paying student. I expect more than the
ASSU to represent me. 1 expect the Univer
sity to seek out and discover my opinion on
issues that bear directly on me.
In the case of Alpha Sig. the ASSU was
not in a position to convey our concerns to
Res Ed. as Res Ed made the decision inter
nally without seeking student advice. As a
member of the University community, the
Res Ed community and the Alpha Sig com
munity. I consider this ptx>r form. It led to a
poor choice.
Students are concerned with the level of
respect they are given as informed partici
pants in decision-making. I don't trust Res
Ed's choice because they didn't trust us
enough to speak with us first.
Specific commitments to students
through institutionalized levels of student
participation and open referendums are
needed as a show of g<xxl faith on the part of
the University. If this had been the case in
the Alpha Sig decision, the choice would not
have been made as it was.
Alpha Sig is one of the strongest and
longest-lived communities on campus. Uni
versity-initiated student participation would
have brought this fact to light before the
choice was made.
I wish to get our unique and irreplaceable
house back. But I also wish that in other
cases, when students feel powerless to affect
change, that they can avoid the terrible loss
and alienation that we feel now that the Uni
versity has gone over our heads and taken

away our home.
We won't go quietly, and it will behoove
the University to listen in order to avoid fur
ther conflict with its own students. I urge you
to support Alpha Sig as a symbol of a cam
pus-wide epidemic of underrepresentation.

ATO also has Res Ed
community of its own
The Residential Education mission state
ment stresses four points: intellectual stimu
lation. academic progress and success, plural
istic community and leadership.
Until Monday. I felt that ATO had a tight
community that would make Res Ed proud.
We are balanced in terms of race, religion,
gender and interests.
We speak openly and often and are gen
uinely interested in one another's points of
view. We have held and attended panels on
subjects such as studying abroad, research
possibilities. URO programs, honors work
and internships.
We make all decisions collectively. We
relax, study and play together. And best of
all, everything I have listed above has hap
pened naturally. As the resident assistant. I
have responded only to the interests of the
residents of this house.
I believe that ATO comes as close as any
residence to embodying the goals of Res. Ed.

I am proud of the theme houses at Stan
ford, and I think that co-ops are important to
our community. I also support housed Greek
organizations; I have worked for two years to
see Kappa Alpha Theta back in University
housing. But Res Ed cannot arbitrarily name
these types of houses "programs" as a dis
tinct category from self-ops and dorms.
No one is in any position to decide that a
theme house or Greek chapter is doing more
for Stanford than a self-op. ATO is the only
house on campus where I, and several others
have chosen to live for more than one year.
A TO is truly the only "right" house for a
number of people, and could have continued
in the future to be the right house for others.
Here, each person chooses his or her own
program.
Some people belong to unhoused Greek
chapters, some do community service, some
have to work to stay here, others are on
sports teams. We don't need someone telling
us how to learn at home; we are old enough
to keep ourselves busy.
The problem is not that ATO may be
replaced by Delta Delta Delta next year; if
fraternities are housed then so must sorori
ties be. The problem is that Res Ed is an
enormous entity, making decisions that
affect all undergraduates, and no one knows
how, when or why it is doing what it does.
I would like to know to whom and how
Res Ed is held accountable. I got the call on
Monday, 'Your house has been offered to a
sorority." Die next day 1 found out from llie
Daily that there was a deadline Friday on the

group's decision. Later, I heard that an
extension was asked for and granted. I am
the RA, but the Res Ed officers were all Uh>
busy engineering housing to bother to call
me and tell me officially what was going on.
Itie Res Ed officers go to their own
homes after work. We're the ones living in
the programs they're playing with. 1 was
asked personally on Monday what makes
ATO so special, since Res Ed had been try
ing to find out for years and found nothing.
Basically I was supposed to justify the
existence of this community, on the spot, in a
concise, eloquent answer, that wouldn't
make any difference at all. This was probably
the most disrespectful, ignorant and ridieu
lous question anyone's asked me in my
three-and-a-half years here.
I've never been less than proud of Stan
ford. Now I am disgusted. I'd like to ask that
the students, trustees and administration to
take a look at the aims and actions of the Res
Ed program with the same impersonal scruti
ny that it used when considering my home to
house a sorority.

Here, each person chooses his or her own
program.
Some people belong to unhoused Greek
chapters, some do community service, some
have to work to stay here, others are on
sports teams. We don't need someone telling
us how to learn at home; we are old enough
to keep ourselves busy.
The problem is not that ATO may be
replaced by Delta Delta Delta next year; if
fraternities are housed then so must sorori
ties be. The problem is that Res Ed is an
enormous entity, making decisions that
affect all undergraduates, and no one knows
how, when or why it is doing what it does.
I would like to know to whom and how
Res Ed is held accountable. I got the call on
Monday, 'Your house has been offered to a
sorority." Die next day 1 found out from llie
Daily that there was a deadline Friday on the

group's decision. Later, I heard that an
extension was asked for and granted. I am
the RA, but the Res Ed officers were all Uh>
busy engineering housing to bother to call
me and tell me officially what was going on.
Itie Res Ed officers go to their own
homes after work. We're the ones living in
the programs they're playing with. 1 was
asked personally on Monday what makes
ATO so special, since Res Ed had been try
ing to find out for years and found nothing.
Basically I was supposed to justify the
existence of this community, on the spot, in a
concise, eloquent answer, that wouldn't
make any difference at all. This was probably
the most disrespectful, ignorant and ridieu
lous question anyone's asked me in my
three-and-a-half years here.
I've never been less than proud of Stan
ford. Now I am disgusted. I'd like to ask that
the students, trustees and administration to
take a look at the aims and actions of the Res
Ed program with the same impersonal scruti
ny that it used when considering my home to
house a sorority.
