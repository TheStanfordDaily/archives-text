# Bordering on slander
## Fight back against the Res Ed rampage 
### 
U. Babbitt^

THIS IS WAR. Strong metaphor?
Yes, hut we have strong enemies,
and they bared their teeth on Mon
day night.
I hey told a packed crowd at Alpha Sig
that students don't matter. They told us
that Residential Education would give
them no voice in the way student housing
works. I hey said Res Ed "programming
goals" are more important than student
needs.
In effect, they told students to take a
hike. Res Ed will do what it wants, and to
hell with us.
It's an interesting tactic for an office
that is supposed to foster student commu
nity. Not even the Los Angeles Police
Department has been more hostile to the
people it is supposed to serve.
Meet Jane Camarillo, director of resi
dential education, and Ann Porteus, direc
tor of Row housing. They must hate us.
That's the only explanation for their
behavior at the Alpha Sig meeting.
At the meeting. Porteus told an aston
ished crowd that Res Ed had eliminated
Alpha Sig because its staff didn't pay
enough attention to Res Ed. Maybe they
didn't write enough friendly e-mails to the

Row office. Maybe they didn't vote about
serving table grapes. Maybe they forgot
Porteus' birthday. Who knows?
Never mind that students don't care
about these things. Res Ed does, and Res
Ed is watching.
Porteus gave an embarrassing speech
that made her, and her office, sound like a
bratty child craving attention. And it sure
sounds like she was behind the impolitic
decision to go after Alpha Sig.
Camarillo was officially responsible for
the decision, but apparently she didn't
take her task very seriously. She casually
revealed to me as late as Feb. 20. "I
haven't really thought about specific
assignments yet."
If that's true, who was thinking for her?
Dean of Students Marc Wais and Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James Mon
toya were also in on the plan. But no one
would say how much blame they shared.
"I made this decision based on Ann's
suggestions," Camarillo said at the meet
ing.
Where on earth did they come from?
Judging from Porteus' peevishness, and
my previous experiences with her, I specu
late they might have come from her desire

to settle scores.
Porteus loves to lord her power over us
20-somethings. In trying to lay down the
law that she daily re-invents, she has alien
ated many Row staff members. At a
recent meeting about an unrelated matter,
I'orteus spent 15 minutes attacking me for
opinions I had expressed in The Daily.
Alpha Sig residents wonder if she has a
personal vendetta against the house. She
made repeated references to the house's
"checkered past," but wouldn't elaborate.
In the last few years. Alpha Sig has been a
model citizen with a strong community.
That nearly KM) people made it to a meet
ing on short notice shows that Siggers love
their house.
Siggers think they've been targeted by
a university bent on destroying yet anoth
er house with a reputation for partying
heartily; a university that under Dean of
Students Marc Wais has cracked down on
the idea that students can be trusted to
have fun responsibly. Or trusted at all.
If Porteus set out to make one thing
clear at the meeting, it was this: protecting
student interests is not part of the Res Ed
mission. She took pains to emphasize that
Res Ed ignored student efforts to save

their houses. She thinks Res Ed can stomp
on students with impunity.
Hogwash.
At some point, we campus dwellers will
unite to protect our interests. I'm glad
ZAP did. and I wish Alpha Sig had done
so sooner.
Hut you can hardly blame it for being
lulled into complacency by Res Ed sneak
iness.
Is it too late for Alpha Sig to save its
house?
Absolutely not. If C'amarillo rushed
into a poor decision based on the unreli
able advice of a subordinate intent on set
tling scores, she has ample reason to
reverse herself. And if she doesn't, Siggers
should take their case higher and higher
until they get justice.
(living Alpha Sig to the Kappa Alpha
Thetas is ludicrous. The Thetas want a
smaller house that no one would miss, not
a house at the edge of campus where
women might feel unsafe. Res Ed tried to
pit the Thetas' interest in being housed
against the Alpha Sig lobby. It is a divide
and-conquer strategy that reeks of cyni
cism.
Porteus and others strove to silence stu

dents, but we must be heard. We need to
tell Res Ed they exist for our sake, not the
other way around. We need to tell them
students deserve a say in their own houses.
It's time to speak truth to power.
You can reach Camarillo at 5-28(X).
Porteus is available at 3-0778. If you think
e-mail is safer, try janecteleland and apor
teusCa leland. You could also try Wais at 3-
2733 or Montoya at 3-1808.
People serious about saving Alpha Sig
for future generations need to hit the Uni
versity where it hurts: the pocketbook.
Sign a pledge that you will not donate
money to the University as long as Alpha
Sig is something else.
University President Gerhard C asper
will probably complain that students are
trying to hold the University hostage, but
maybe he'll realize Res Ed has tried to do
the same to us.
His personal attention could fix the
problem in a jiffy, so go ahead and send
him an e-mail or two at
HK (iXCfaforsythe. You could also leave
a message with his receptionist at 3-2481.
