## Men want no surprises Basketball looks for easy, predictable wins at Maples 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
March Madness is kicking into
high gear around the nation, but the
Stanford men's basketball team has
to tie up a few loose ends before it
heads into the Big Dance.
The No. 11 Cardinal (24-4, 13-3
Pacific 10 Conference) must host
Oregon tonight and Oregon State
Saturday in Maples Pavilion before
it can turn its focus to the NCAA
Tournament.

Stanford, all hut assured of a
spot in the tournament, simply
needs to finish the season in strong
fashion in order to secure its posi
tion as at least a No. 3 seed in its re
gional.
The task at hand might not seem
too difficult — the Cardinal beat

both these schools on the road by at
least 20 points in January — but the
team wants to win forcefully and
build up confidence and momen
tum heading into tournament play.
Of course, Oregon isn't the same
team it was at the beginning of con
ference play. The Ducks have won
six of their last eight games, with
with increasing defensive intensity.
Oregon (13-12,8-8) has given up
an average of 64.5 points in its last
eight matches and is the Pac-10
leader in scoring defense at 69.5
points per conference game.
The team has gotten a huge lift
from forward Flo Hartenstein, who
hasn't done much at the offensive
end of the court but has been able
to create a defensive presence in
the middle.
"Oregon is really playing good
basketball," said Cardinal head
coach Mike Montgomery. "We
don't expect an easy time by any
stretch of imagination.
"They're reasonably athletic.
[Head coach Ernie Kent's] got
them playing really hard on de
fense. [Hartenstein] has helped
them inside with their physical

play."
The only problem for the Ducks
is that on average, they are scoring
only 68.1 points per league game.
The Ducks' top scorer, guard
Terik Brown, ranks 19th in Pac-10
play with 13.3 points per game. The
Cardinal's top scorer in conference,
junior point guard Arthur Lee,
ranks only 16th, but Stanford has
two other players in the top 20. Ju
nior guard Kris Weems and junior
center Tim Young are 17th and
20th, respectively, and junior for
ward Peter Sauer is also averaging
double digits in point production.
Despite the lack of scoring. Ore
gon still finds itself with nothing to
lose as it enters this week's games.
The Ducks are favored in neither
game and haven't even been men
tioned as a bubble team.
Kent has already surprised
everybody by keeping his team in
the top half of the conference stand
ing, and the worst outcome for Ore
gon is an 8-10 conference record
and sixth-place in the Pac-10.
The Cardinal, however, is play

ing with a lot at stake.
A slip-up against either of
these schools would almost cer
tainly drop the team from a No. 3
seed, a position the Cardinal has
fought too hard for to relinquish
now.
Stanford must also build some
momentum heading into the tour
nament. The 32-point drubbing it
suffered at the hands of Arizona
last Saturday is not the type of
game the Cardinal wants lingering
as it enters tournament play.
"Our objective this week is to
get back on track," Montgomery
said. "We need to get some confi
dence back. We want to finish up
what promises to be a great season
by playing well at home.
"Anytime you get beat like
that, there's a residual that you
have to deal with. The reality of it
is that we don't need to do any

thing different."
Sauer doesn't feel the team was
too shaken by Arizona. He believes
the Cardinal will do some damage
in the tournament.
"We feel pretty confident,"
Sauer said. "We just want to get
back on the winning side of things.
"I think we're a hard team to
play. We play solid half-court bas
ketball. There's not a lot of room
for error when you play us."
When the Cardinal went to Eu
gene on Jan. 5. Weems lit the Ducks
for a career-high 34 points on 13-of
18 shooting. Weems also pulled
down six rebounds en route to the
89-67 victory.
Sauer and reserve guard David
Moseley. a sophomore, both
helped the Cardinal cause with 13
points each; Sauer also grabbed
seven rebounds.
With the Cardinal hitting 55 per
cent from the floor, the Ducks and
their slow offense had no way to
keep up with the scoring down
pour.
