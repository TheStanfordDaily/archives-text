ming competition begins today.

■ Today-Saturday: Pacific 10 Conference
Championships in Long Beach. Calif.

The team is rolling after a strong dual-meet
season. The divers swept Cal at their last dual
meet, and freshman Lucas Brower has been
diving extremely well after missing much of
the early season due to injury. Sophomore
Mark Michelin has also added to the Cardi
nal's depth.
If its performance against Cal two weeks
ago is any indication, the Cardinal will speed
away from the competition this weekend.
Stanford enters the championship part of the
season ranked first nationally and is consid
ered a favorite to take home the NCAA title.
The other favorites for this year's title.

Texas and Auburn, have already swum their
conference meets. Stanford knows what it has
to do at this meet to make sure it has the inside
track on the NCAA crown.
"I'm really excited to go out there and
show how well we've been training and how
fast we've been swimming," "tfrtid freshman
distance specialist Jeremy Kane. "This is the
first chance for us to swim tapered. A lot of
guys are shaving, and it's our chance to show
how fast we'll be at NCAAs."
Most of the team will be shaven and ta
pered for this meet in order to qualify for the
NCAA Championships, and the odds are
good that the team will repeat as Pac-10
champs. Six swimmers already have qualified
for NCAAs and will not shave until later this
month.
Senior co-captain Tom Wilkens and fresh
man Steven Brown swam at the world cham
pionships earlier this year and already have
their cuts. They will be joined in the hairy
ranks by Kane, juniors Matt Pierce and l ate
Blahnik and senior Sabir Muhammad.
Among Stanford's defending Pac-10
champions are Muhammad (KM) butterfly)
and Wilkens (200 IM). Because both Wilkens
and Muhammad are unshaven, they will face
stiff competition from their teammates.
