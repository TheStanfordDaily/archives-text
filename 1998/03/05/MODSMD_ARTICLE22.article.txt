# Ducks dying to beat Card
## Victory over Card would be a huge feather in Oregon's cap 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Games don't get much bigger for
the Oregon Ducks than tonight's
contest against the fifth-ranked
Stanford women's basketball team.
At 16-8(12-4 Pacific 10 Confer
ence), the Ducks will likely go to
the tournament even if they don't
beat the Cardinal (19-5, 15-1).
However, nothing would do more
for Oregon's tournament seeding
than a win over Stanford.
In addition. Oregon head coach
Jody Kunge and her squad seem to
gauge their success by how well
they perform against Stanford. Un
fortunately for the Ducks, a win
over the Cardinal has remained elu
sive for more than 10years.
"We like the fact that we have
the target on our back," said Stan
lord head coach l ara VanDerveer.
"It's good for us to have everyone
come out and give us their best shot.
We've proven by clinching an
NCAA berth that we've improved
a lot, but we don't want to let up."
Stanford last faccd the Ducks on

Jan. 4, a 97-72 Cardinal win in the
second Pac-10 game of the season.
In that contest Stanford completely
dominated Oregon in the paint,
with senior forward Olvmpia Scott
abusing the Ducks for 25 points and
a career-high lb rebounds.

And if Stanford was too much
inside then, you can bet things
won t be easier for the Ducks in this
contest. Last time, Oregon was
without sophomore center Jenny
Mowe. who had suffered a season
ending injury. Since then, they also
have lost freshman Hrianne Mehar
ry, who led the Ducks with 18 points
in the first meeting.
"Different teams we plav point
to different things" to focus on.
VanDerveer said. "If you're play
ing Washington State, you've got to
be able to handle the press. If
you're playing against UCLA.

you've got to rebound. Our chal
lenge as a team is don't let the game
be more important to anyone else
than to us."
One might expect that a clinched
berth to the tournament and one
last road trip against two unranked
teams would be as g<xxl a time as
any to relax. Hut senior forward
Vanessa Nygaard is fairly certain
that won't happen.
"Those are the last two Pac-10
games," Nygaard said following last
Saturday's win over Arizona. "I'm
going to make that promise right
now — we're going to be ready to
plav. 1 remember last year we had
all those injuries going into [the
Oregon game]. We barely snuck
out of there last year, and I think
they'll be ready to play."
l.ast season, Stanford squeaked
out of Eugene with a win. But
that was an injury-riddled squad
that as Nygaard said had just placed
a "please help" phone call to now
senior forward Kristin Folkl
No such calls have been needed
