other teams but against Stanford fencers themselves,
all competing for the two spots available within their
weapon category." said junior co-captain Tim
Chang.

the season, the Cardinal has been thriving thanks to
new recruits.

year so far." said co-captain Josh Staufter. "Each of
the new fencers has adjusted superbly to collegiate
fencing."
