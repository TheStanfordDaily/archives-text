"This is the one of the strongest
teams we've ever had together,"
head coach Vickey Weir said.
Saturday's competition will begin
withsolos, duets and trios.
One highlight of the small routine
competition will be Pease's solo to
the music of "Schindler's List."
Pease was a member of the first
place 19% U.S. Olympic team be

fore she joined the Stanford team
last year. In addition to her solo,
Pease also swims as part of a duet
and trio.
Pease's contribution to the team
has been formidable. "She helps us a
lot. Just watching her swim ...
makes you want to work harder," ju
nior Emi Kanayama said.
The small routine competition
will be followed by the team compe
tition. The team routine, made up of
eight swimmers, is considered the
primary routine event.
Stanford's team routine features
two "lifts," in which Kanayama and
later Enos are boosted out of the
water by the other swimmers, as well
as a double "throw," in which
Kanayama and Enos are tossed up

into the air simultaneously.
The routine also contains pass
through patterns, a "peel-off line
and long no-hreathing sections.
Swimmers are not permitted to
touch the bottom of the pool for the
duration of the routine.
All routines are evaluated by a
panel of judges based on technical
merit and artistic impression, similar
to figure skating.
The Stanford synchro team looks
forward to performing its routines in
its home pool. The team hopes its
audience will provide enthusiastic
support.
"Synchro by nature is a perfor
mance sport," Chen explained. "It's
just so much more exciting to be in
front of a home crowd."
