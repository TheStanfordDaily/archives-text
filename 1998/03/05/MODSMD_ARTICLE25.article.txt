■ Today: No. 17 Stanford (9-3) vs.
Sacramento State, 1 p.m. at the Stan
ford Softball Complex

Last season, the Card took
care of the Hornets 3-2 in the
Campbell / Cartier Classic hut
split a doubleheader at Sacra
mento later in the season. Sacra
mento snatched the first game 1-
0, and Stanford took the second
6-5.
Last weekend, the Card took
second place at the Cal State-
Fullerton Showcase. Stanford
won four games in the tourney hut
lost to No. 13 Long Beach State
twice.
"Last weekend against Long
Beach was definitely a little frus
trating because we made mistakes
we shouldn't have," Schulman
said.
Against Long Beach. Stanford
allowed runs early and left run
ners on base.
It will be important for the
Card to score first against the
Hornets, as Stanford is 8-1 on the
season if it scores first but only 2-
2 if it doesn't.
The Card pitching staff will
have to deal with a solid Hornets
lineup. Stanford's defense will be
put to the test today against a
tearfTth'at Frequently hits the ball

on the ground.
"Sacramento is well-coached
and has a solid program every
year," Stanford coach John
Rittman said. "They are a good
defensive team with solid pitch
ing. Though their record might
not indicate such, they will put us
to the test today."
The Hornets, in turn, will have
to deal with a Stanford team that
has been hitting the ball particu
larly well recently.
The Card is led by junior
Michele Aeosta, who is batting
.457 with 13 RBI and two home
runs; junior Michelle Schneider,
who is batting .439 with 11 runs
and six RBI; and junior Marcy
Crouch, who is batting .349 with
12 RBI.
Schneider's efforts earned her
tournament MVP honors at the
Campbell / Cartier Classic; last
week, she was the first Stanford
player in history to be named Pa
cific 10 Conference Player of the
Week.
On the mound for the Card, ju
nior Becky Blevins has been a
perfect 6-0 with a 1.02 ERA. She
has struck out 28 while walking
only seven and has given up 29
hits in 41 innings for the Card.
Crouch has pitched consider
ably better than what her 3-3
record suggests; she has won
against then-No. 14 Long Beach
State and No. 15 Cal State-North
ridge. She is also giving up an av
erage of less than one hit per in
ning pitched.
The Hornets will have to con
tend with either Blevins or
Crouch on the mound. It will be
up to the Stanford defense to
make sure that the Hornets are
not handed any easy runs early in
the game.
"The key is for our defense to
play solidly," Schulman said. "We
are going to put some hits togeth
er and score. What we can't do is
forget how to hit in clutch situa
tions or leave too many runners
on base."
