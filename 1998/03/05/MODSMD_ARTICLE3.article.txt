## 
### Jason Kngleman Contributing writer 
A group of around 70 people
crowded into a room at the Henry
I loover Memorial Building to hear a
talk titled "Ushering out Commu
nism: A View from the Other Side"
given by the last socialist prime min
ister of Poland, Miec/yslaw
Kakowski yesterday afternoon.
Rakowski devoted a significant
portion of his speech to outlining
Poland's modern history.
After 1956. Poland was a commu
nist nation that the Soviet Union

kept a close eye on. In the early
19K(k. leaders of the Soviet Union
decided that the "time was right for
military intervention in Poland."
According to Kakowski. the Poles
were "very eager to defend their
freedom." and great bloodshed
would have occurred. At the last
minute, he said, the I 'nited States in
tervened and convinced the Soviets
not to attack.
He said that for a brief time, there
was a coexistence between commu
nists and the liberals of the Solidari
ty movement. At the end of I9KI.
though, all unions were banned.

Meanwhile. Rakowski was promot
ed to deputy prime minister.
Unfortunately, a terrible econo
my and a potential war with the So
viet Union caused martial law to be
implemented in Poland. At the same
time, there was "increasing radical
ism within Solidarity." Rakowski
said.
The Catholic Church and West
ern countries ambitiously supported
Solidarity. In fact. Pope John Paul II
visited Poland, his native country,
twice during the l l >NOs.
Still, the Polish leaders stuck to
the communist dogma even with the

increasing Solidarity power.
In the spring of 1985, with
Mikhail Gorbachev now in control
of the Soviet Union. Polish leaders
had no idea that he was someone
who would, according to Rakowski.
"change the policy of his predeces
sors."
I o the surprise of Polish officials.
Gorbachev implemented a policy of
noninterference with internal Polish
affairs In NN7. at a conference tilled
with members of the Polish leader
ship. R.ikowski presented a paper in
which he said the economic gap be
tween capitalist and communist
countries was growing. 1 le conclud
ed that communism would "con
demn itself to slow withering il in
novations (did] not appear."
Meanwhile, the Polish people
"advocated change in Poland."
In September 1988, Rakowski
became the new prime minister. 1 le
agreed to work with the opposition
and offered four ministry posts to
opposition party members, but
they refused. He also started to
open the door for a market econo
my. I le admits now though, that the
"reforms ... came too late."
In 1989, after a relatively free
election, a new Polish parliament
was voted into office. The results of
the election meant overwhelming
defeat for the communist party.
Looking back, Rakowski still
thinks that socialism just needed to
be changed and not abolished. "I
think every system can be re
formed."
Overall, audience members
seemed impressed with Rakowski.
He seems like a "man with a lot of
integrity," said Laurie Koloski, a lec
turer in the History Department.
Lucja Kwasniak. a graduate stu
dent in Slavic Languages and Liter
ature whose father was arrested and
jailed for political reasons during
martial law. had a slightly different
sentiment. She felt "uneasy to come
hear and see the person partially re
sponsible."
