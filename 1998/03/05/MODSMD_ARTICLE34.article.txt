## worldly Women The 						Global Divas bring international harmony to Stanford 
### Karin West Contributing writer 
The stage is black and bare, save for three sets of
straight-backed chairs, speakers and microphones
arranged before a simple black wooden platform. But a
warm, red light begins to glow on a white backdrop and
silhouettes a striking woman from Zimbabwe and two fel
low musicians.
It is soon clear that even the stage's vast emptiness
can barely contain the captivating, pulsing world rhythms
that are given voice by this woman and her equally pow
erful co-performers from Peru and the American
Southwest.
Global Divas brings together three extraordinary
women from diverse cultural settings in a singular musical
spirit. The Afro-Peruvian songs of Susana Baca meld with
the soaring lyrics of Stella Chiweshe, a groundbreaking
player of the mbira (Zimbabwe's thumb piano.) The trio is
rounded out by Mexican-American singer and songwriter
Tish Hinojosa, whose lyrics about life in a Texas border
town add another line to the global harmony.
Baca, who grew up in a country that denied its
African heritage, has worked to blend the remnants of
Peru's African past with the country's current musical tra
ditions. The daughter of a dancer and a musician, Baca's
musical success defied the ideas held in the 1960s that it
was not respectable for women to perform onstage. The
world recognition now given to Afro-Peruvian music is
due in large part to her dedicated work and cultural re
search.
Stella Chiweshe shattered long-standing cultural
barriers in order to play one of the most sacred instru
ments in Southern Africa, the Shona people's mbira dza
vadzimu. The metal-pronged hand piano is used in tradi
tional ceremonies to call on ancestral spirits. As the Shona
are a patriarchal society, the hand piano is played by men.
After years of struggle, Chiweshe earned the right to
play the mbira and has gone on to record, perform and
play at traditional ceremonies. Her work has opened up a
beautiful African musical culture not only to women of
her country, but to people around the world.
Hinojosa was the youngest of 13 children born to
Mexican immigrant parents in San Antonio, Texas.
Hinojosa's songs are inspired by the cultural jumble of South
Texas, where European descendants and American Indians
_ mixed with Mexican immigrants. She

grew up listening to Mexican radio sta
tions in her family's home and sings in
both English and Spanish. The Tejano in
fluence in her music is augmented by
folk, rock and country styles that blend to
create a unique musical voice and spirit.
Each woman performs a set of
her own music during the show and is
backed by a group of musicians from
her country — who are, incidentally,
all men. The intricate rhythms and
melodies wind through the audience,
causing feet to tap, hands to clap and
shoulders to swing. The groups com
bine for an energetic finale which
showcases the genre of each songstress.
The Global Divas and company
will be performing at Stanford this
Saturday. In a celebration of Women's
History Month, Baca, Chiweshe and
Hinojosa will all participate in an after
noon panel discussion at the Stanford
Women's Center entitled "Women's
Issues in International Music." Each
artist will bring her instrument for a
brief demonstration, and a reception
will wrap up this unique event at the
Fire Truck House.
