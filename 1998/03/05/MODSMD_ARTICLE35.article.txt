# You say kumidaiko
## I say taiko 
### Alexis Tygenhof Contributing writer 
Since its founding in 1992, Stanford Taiko
has produced an annual, full-length performance
of Japanese kumidaiko, an ensemble drumming art
form developed in the 19505. Last Sunday's two
hour production in Dinkelspiel Auditorium was
unique in that for the first time, it was composed
entirely of original Stanford Taiko pieces, seven of
which had never been performed before.
"Falling Rain," by junior Shoji Kameda,
opened the performance. The sound began with
the gentle patter of rain but quickly progressed to a
rumbling, crashing thunderstorm. Although the
dynamics of the various songs alternated from soft
and caressing to furiously violent, the drummers
maintained this storm level of energy throughout
the entire show.
"It was pretty intense," said Stanford parent
Sam Lee. A struggle between the strength of the
drums and the sense of control emanating from the
drummers characterized every piece.
In fact, the performers' impassive faces were
masks of concentration that contrasted sharply
with their unbelievable physical vigor.
Bay Area resident Nick Hughes said the na
tive Japanese Taiko performers he'd seen in
Berkeley "had a little more tie to the spiritual side.
Nevertheless, Stanford Taiko was very energetic."
The performance's strength and power came
from the drummers' purity of rhythm and move
ment. The performers were symmetrically arranged
under unobtrusive lighting. Their bodies, moving in
unison, created clean angles and parallel lines as
they beat the drums, producing a stark visual and
aural beauty. Each drumbeat — confident and de
liberate — resonated through the auditorium.
The drummers endowed the drums with in
dividual personalities as their rhythms wove to
gether in each work. The instruments interacted in
many ways, enhancing, harmonizing and convers
ing with each other to create an entire acoustic
community.
One of the most stunning compositions,
"Before I Sleep," by Josephine Sun and David
Ishimaru, tracked the rhythms of human life.
Beginning with a single heartbeat in the dark, the
piece grew in complexity as the lights came up, sig
nifying human struggles. A lone flute represented
the learning process. Ultimately, the piece reverted
to an unaccompanied heartbeat before fading into
silence.
The final composition, "Zeecha!," by Kameda,
celebrated life, art and creativity. It closed the per
formance with a unified drum stroke that reverber
ated through the auditorium. In response to the en
thusiasm, Taiko performed an encore piece in which
the drummers shed their austerity with lively smiles,
energetic movement and improvisation. For the
first time, the performers revealed their personali
ties and their joy of drumming.
A breathtaking compilation of austere
rhythm and form, Taiko's 1998 concert,
"Impressions," transformed the world by drum
beats and movement, bringing the audience roar
ing to its feet.
