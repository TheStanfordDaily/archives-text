# Anne Rice makes more sense
## Neville's 'The Magic Circle' isn't magical enough to buy 
### Ryan Chuang 
Katheri/ie Neville's third novel,
"The Magic Circle," is a unique
experience. From the title, I ex
pected a fantasy tale with sorcerers and
knights. Instead, the book's magic lies in
the mysticism of legends and religion.
"The Magic Circle" straddles the
line between reality and the unbeliev
able and incorporates random histori
cal, mythological facts and traditions
into perplexing puzzles.
The plot centers around the ad
ventures of Ariel Behn, a young woman
with an extremely complicated family
history. When she hears of her cousin
Sam's death, Behn's life suddenly be
comes a chaotic mess.
A set of secret documents be
queathed to Behn suddenly turn into a hot
commodity that everybody wants to pos
sess. Behn takes flight from her quiet life to
learn more about the documents and the
truths hidden in her convoluted ancestry.
All of Neville's characters (includ
ing a swimming cat named Jason) are ex
traordinary. Sam is not only Behn's
cousin but also her stepbrother.
Additionally, he is a secret agent for the
United States and an expert in codes.
Behn's half-sister, the blonde
bombshell Bambi, is a professional cellist
and an expert markswoman. This is one
unusual family, and figuring out Behn's
family tree is definitely a confusing exer
cise.
Though most of the book occurs
in the late 1980s, the plot itself separates
into several substories that occur in a
myriad of different times and places. For
instance, the opening scene starts in
Italy in the 1870s with a search for an
cient manuscripts hidden in the Sibyl's
Cave in Cumae. Next the story takes an
abrupt jump even further into the past,

to biblical times. There Neville breathes
life into the some of the most famous
figures of that era: Jesus Christ, Lazarus,
Mary Magdalene, Pontius Pilate and
Joseph of Arimathea.
Many other familiar historical and
religious leaders (Adolph Hitler,
Alexander the Great, Herod, and the
Julio-Claudian Roman Emperors Nero,
Caligula and Tiberius) and their sup
porting casts make several appearances.
The plot is confusing. Sometimes
it seems as if Neville tries to tie very thin,
unrelated thread together. At one point,
there is a discussion about salt that
eventually leads to King Solomon and
the Song of Songs. Another time, Behn,
in attempting to break a coded message,
uses her knowledge of encryption the
ory and the Bible to decipher the time
and place for a secret meeting in Sun
Valley, Idaho.
This plethora of diverse topics has
something to intrigue everyone, but un
less you are fairly knowledgeable about
everything from Nazi history to Greek
myths, it's easy to get lost.
Most of the characters are just weird
caricatures of people that rely on overused
stereotypes, and I never really cared much
about them one way or another.
In the end, "The Magic Circle"
comes across as a mystery thriller with a
heavy dose of interpretive historical fic
tion reminiscent of an Anne Rice book.
Neville's novel is an interesting read if
you have lots of extra time to figure
everything out, but it's not enthralling
enough to finish in one sitting.
Those who are very patient and
like to figure out puzzles might really en
joy this book. But Michael Crichton and
John Grisham readers may want to look
elsewhere.
