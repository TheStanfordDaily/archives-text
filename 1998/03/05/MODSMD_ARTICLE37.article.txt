# Palo Alto's psychic fair
## events / books 
### Amina Gautier Contributing writer 
Say you lost your
keys. Your mind knows
where those car keys are,
but you've just forgotten
it for the moment. If you
quiet down your con
scious mind, your intu
ition will remember their
location.
Sacred Produc
tions' 13th Annual
Winter Psychic & Healing
Arts Fair this weekend in
Palo Alto will help you
get in touch with your
more intuitive side.
Sacred Productions
has been putting on this
event since 1986. All are
welcome, especially those
wishing to expand their
subconscious and in
stinctive capacities and
those needing help or ad
vice for problems in their
lives.

A professional staff well versed in
paranormal techniques such as Tarot,
palmistry, clairvoyance, psychometry
(gaining psychic impressions from ob
jects), channeling and astrology will be
available for assistance. Each psychic
reading will last for about 20 minutes.
The fair covers more than psy
chic readings, however. Are you green
with envy, red with anger or feeling sad
and blue? We all radiate energy on var
ious levels. An "aura camera" can take a
Polaroid picture of the energy repre
sented by the colors around you in a
visible light and give you a reading of
your aura.
Feeling tired and sore? Try reiki
or ancient Japanese touch healing.
Reiki is an energy channeling tech
nique that generates healing energy
throughout your body with very little
to no touching involved.
A healer moves the energy
through your body more freely and
teaches you how to do it, too. This tech
nique is also good for back or neck
pain, sore muscles and migraine
headaches.
In addition to reiki, healers will
also demonstrate neck and shoulder
massages and reflexology (massaging
foot pressure points). There will also be
free lectures on topics such as develop
ing your own psychic skills, as well as a
wide selection of new age music, books
and implements.
According to Andy Davis, a pro

duction associate for Sacred
Productions, "In modern culture, we
emphasize the rational side of our
awareness too much and neglect our
intuition."
Davis says we only use 10 per
cent of our brain capacity at most.
Through intuition, we can gain access
to the other 90 percent and gather in
formation about a variety of topics in
the world, including past lives, future
outcomes and possible roads to success
in careers and relationships. Davis says
the psychic fair will be a "very playful,
healing and inspiring event"
Sacred Productions does many
psychic fairs throughout Northern
California from as far north as Chico to
as far south as Santa Cruz.
They also have a Mind, Spirit
and Body Expo every January in
Concord, Calif.
