## A 						Touch of the South a 						Mardi Gras experience at the Blue Chalk Cafe 
### Frederick Vallaeys Contributing writer 
Tuesday, Feb. 24 was Mardi
Gras, and some restau
rants organized special
theme dinners around the event.
That evening, Intermission was
invited to sample the food at the
Blue Chalk Cafe on Ramona
Street in downtown Palo Alto.
Although I've lived around this
area for almost five years, I hadn't
realized this restaurant existed. It is
in a perfect spot: two blocks off
University Avenue and next to City
Hall, where there is ample parking.
When I got there, it was clear
that a party was going on. People
sporting colorful, feathered
masks and shiny strings of beads
were enjoying themselves in the
Cafe's courtyard.

Upon entering that courtyard,
it really felt as if I was leaving Palo
Alto and entering New Orleans.
The restaurant was designed by a
Palo Alto architect in 1927 and
had the decor of a reaionably well
maintained historic building.
Unlike most theme restaurants,
the decor felt authentic.
At the building's entrance
there is a wide open space lead
ing up to a large stairway.
Upstairs, there is a bar that covers
the back of the building.
Downstairs there are pool tables,
some dartboards and a smaller
bar. Seating consists of stools at
bar tables, benches and wooden
chairs. While none are super
comfortable, they all help to
make the restaurant's Southern
theme come alive.
To complement the decor, the
cuisine is mostly Southern. On

regular nights they serve pretty
much any type of meat, prepared
in one or two ways. The prices for
entries range between $10 for
pasta and $16 for pork. During
lunch, there are also two types of
sandwiches available.
For Fat Tuesday, the Blue Chalk
Cafe organized an all-you-can-eat
buffet which included crawfish,
shrimp, oysters, roast suckling, corn
on the cob, peach cobbler and a va
riety of other Southern foods.
Because this was a buffet event, we
could sit wherever we pleased.
Initially, 1 sat downstairs in a place
with a view of the pool tables and
sampled the crawfish. While it was
n't all that good, it was still fun to use
my fingers to find all the juicy bits.
Almost as soon as I sat down, I was
approached by a waiter selling com
memorative T-shirts. They make one
every year as a collector's item.
Luckily, the beads and masks

that hung throughout the building
were free for the taking. Masks were
hung over lamps, chairs and even
over some of the restaurant's
Southern relief artwork. The quan
tity of beads was almost unbeliev
able; I literally could not move two
steps without running into another
pile of them.
After finishing my crawfish,
I explored the rest of the restau
rant. The buffet was set up on both
floors and in all corners, making it
necessary to move around. The
oysters and shrimp were located in
a corner of the restaurant that has
its own bar. Both the shrimp and
the oysters (raw and Rockefeller
style) were plentiful.
Unfortunately, they may have
had to sacrifice some quality in or
der to provide all this quantity.
While the peel-and-eat shrimp were
delicious, the oysters had little flavor,
probably because they had already
been open for most of the day.
I decided to continue my meal
upstairs. Upstairs near the front of
the building, there is one sizable
table with benches. That part of the
restaurant also houses a shuffle
board and two televisions showing
ESPN. The combination of a tradi-

tional Southern restau
rant with a sports bar
was sort of strange but
very appealing. Unlike
most restaurants, where
it seems that the waiter is
trying to get you out of
there as quickly as possi
ble, the Blue Chalk Cafe
offered the possibility to
eat and enjoy the atmos
phere at my own pace.
The best seats in the
restaurant are probably
those upstairs along ei
ther of the two walk
ways connecting the
front and rear of the

building. These tables seem to
have the most space and privacy.
If you like fireplaces, you would
probably enjoy sitting down
stairs, where they have two large
ones that are always lit.
The service was prompt and
very courteous, even though this
was a buffet event. Dirty plates
were constantly being taken away
while new food was continuously
brought in.
While I loved the restaurant'!,
atmosphere, I must admit that I
had somewhat mixed feelings
about the food. Then again, 1
used to love Fresh Choice's buf
fets, but after coming to Stanford
and eating buffet food on a daily
basis, I got tired of eating mass
produced food.
Having been to the Blue Chalk
Cafe only during their special Fat
Tuesday event, I am in no posi
tion to make a judgment about
their cuisine the remaining 364
days of the year. However, if their
regular menu items are as authen
tic as the Southern atmosphere at
the party, 1 would recommend
checking out this restaurant. It is
very close to campus and seems to
be a great place to go with some
friends to shoot some pool, play
shuffleboard or just watch a bas
ketball game while enjoying rea
sonably-priced food.
