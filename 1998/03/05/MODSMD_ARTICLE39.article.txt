# He's not Steve McQueen, but he is...

### Vin de Silva Contributing writer 
We all have our miscon
ceptions about mod
ern art. For me it was
a simple case of mistaken iden
tity. Could this be the late
Steve McQueen, Hollywood's
quintessential antihero; the
most magnificent of the
"Magnificent Seven,"thepoker
playing "Cincinnati Kid," and
star of "The Blob?"
No.
The San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art's latest exhibition,
"Steve McQueen: 4 Projected
Image Installations," features the
work of British artist Steve
McQueen (no relation to the ac
tor), one of a handful of people
worldwide working in the
"Projected Image" medium.
A projected image display
usually takes the form of a short
film or video clips mounted for
exhibition. The film may be nar
rative or purely visual. Projected
image artists are fascinated by
the mechanisms and language of
the visual media, and this fasci
nation shows up in his work.
Rob Riley, SFMOMA's curator
of media arts, compares the work
of projected image artists to 19th
century photo-play arcades,
which appeared while moving
image technology was still in its
infancy. Exotic machines such as
zoetropes and praxinoscopes
gave a tantalizing taste of the fu
ture and drew crowds.
Riley has been working with
McQueen for two years to pre
sent his work.

Each exhibit lives inside a
darkened room with wails
cloaked in black. A cinema
screen takes up one entire side of
the room, drawing the viewer in
with its size and immediacy. As
Riley pointed out, "The proxim
ity of the viewer is important in

Steve's work."

The projected im
age experience is

more like view
ing a gallery

than watching
a movie. The
viewer is free

to walk in
and out of
the displays.
The films

are displayed
in a continu
ous video loop.

They still have
beginning, middle

U'
and end, but there is
also a sense of cycle.

McQueen tends to work in
monochrome, and all of his
films are silent.
McQueen himself turned out
to be a refreshingly bashful char
acter, despite the fluorescent
pink jacket he wears. "What's all
this clapping?" he asked, when
Riley introduced him. Like a
true artist, he has no introduc
tory remarks about his work.
"Just go in and see for yourself."
The four pieces that make
up the exhibit date from
1993 to 1997.
The two earlier works, "Bear"
and "Five Easy Pieces," are out
standing. They are part of a tril
ogy, but the middle installment

("Stage") is not shown here.
In "Bear" (1993), two
wrestlers circle each other. It's
erotic, suspenseful and ab
solutely extraordinary. It looks
like an award-winning film,
even if it happens not to be.
"Five Easy Pieces" (1995) is a
montage of tangentially related
scenes. A female tightrope
walker balances on a rope, rock
ing hypnotically backwards and
forwards. Looking down, we see
five gyrating men girdled by
hula-hoops, almost (but not

quite) bringing us a shimmering
representation of the Olympic
rings. One by one, they lose their
momentum and stop, disgusted.
A low shot of another man in
boxer shorts seems more threat
ening. Is it the attitude of his
stance that disturbs us? Or is it
his half-seen face? Maybe it's his
ominous lack of purpose that
chills. Whatever it is, the image
disappears quickly; but the sense
of menace remains. Later we are
rewarded for our fear when the
man returns to punish us.

Both films contain the glim
merings of storytelling and cues
to respond to. I can recommend
them strongly to anyone with an
interest in cinema. On the other
hand, the two more recent
works, "Just Above my Head"
and "Catch," leave me groping to
find any real merit in them.
The danger signs are very
clear. Both works are
unashamedly minimal. People
have become rich and famous
by painting a canvas blue, call
ing it "Blue" and selling it as art.
Sometimes it's a little more

clever than that. A picture of a
pipe saying, "This is not a

pipe" in French at
least has an air of

philosophy
about it,

though I pre
fer to call it
whimsy.

It seems
that
McQueen is
buying into

this tradition.
I generally de-

112 fer to the co
horts of educated
critics who know

how to appreciate this
sort of thing. People tell me

that there are colored rectangles
and "colored rectangles." The real
art is in getting the shades and
hues just so; arranging the differ
ent components in just the right
proportions and other such sub
tleties.
And yes, abstract can be
wonderful.
On the other hand, words of
ten seem spurious when trying
to understand these things. What
makes a particular piece of ab
straction good? How do you
write about a 10-minute film
seemingly based on one-and-a
half good ideas?
McQueen's "Just Above My
Head" (1996) is mostly blank,

gray sky with a little head bob
bing up and down at the bot
tom of the screen, as if it had
all been filmed through a cam
era held in the subject's right
hand. In fact it was filmed
through a camera held in the
subject's right hand.
It does have an endearing
quality, especially when a tree
suddenly appears.
"Catch" (1997) is colorful as
well as wily, but again 1 found
it hard to get very far under its
skin. It seems to be just clever
enough to be a launch pad for
longish critical essays built out
of five-syllable words. Maybe
that's the trick.
It actually made me feel
motion sick, but you may not
have that problem.
Is there an audience for this
kind of work? McQueen, who
is now based in Amsterdam,
says that this San Francisco
outing is just a one-time show
â€” there is no world tour in
sight. Rather gloomily, he ad
mits that things are "pretty
down all over the place" for his
kind of work.
I think that's a shame in view
of the obvious talent shown in
his earlier works. I only hope
that McQueen isn't shooting
himself in the foot by his choice
of artistic minimalism.
