## 
### lan Mak 
There were mixed reactions on cam
pus to the changes announced Monday by
the Residential Programs Implementa
tion Group, with many different views of
what the changes might mean for the
character of the affected dormitories.
Starting this fall. Faisan, C'edro and
Soto will become all-freshman dormito
ries, Toyon Hall an all-sophomore resi
dence and Kimball I tall an upperclass res
idence.
Commenting on the conversion of
Faisan as a new all-freshman dorm in Flo
rence Moore Hall, Faisan sophomore
Rosina Lozano said that having another
all-freshman dorm in east Flo Mo. in ad
dition to Alondra. would make the place
livelier.
Hut she feared that the upperclassmen
in Cardenal, the remaining four-class
dorm in east Flo Mo. might feel isolated.
This opinion was echoed by senior
Richard Bae, who said. "I'm afraid that
[they] might feel outnumbered on the east
side because two of the three houses there

will be all-frosh."
However, he added. "The new influx
of frosh into the east side might make in
teraction between east and west Flo Mo
stronger since frosh are eager to meet one
another and engage in various activities
together."
With Soto and Cedro also becoming
all-freshman dormitories next fall, many
people agreed that the increasing demand
to be in all-freshman dormitories could
now be met.
"Many people wanted to get into all
frosh dorms but didn't get a chance to.
Now more of them can experience the all
frosh bonding." said sophomore Philip
Shilane.
While people were generally looking
forward to the influx of energy into the
new all-freshman dormitories, residents
at Toyon felt that a lot of energy was going
to be taken away.
Seniors Tom ('louse. Mike Ockhurt/
and Reuven Levitt all felt disappointed
that the interface between freshmen and
upperclassmen in such a large dorm of
213 would be lost.

According to freshman Siu Taur Fang.
"We have a great mix of people in our
dorm this year, but I don't see that hap
pening in an all-sophomore dorm."
Junior David Saperstein also ex
pressed great concern about how the
change would affect the Toyon Eating
Clubs.
He said the eating clubs have always
been an integral part of Toyon and Stan
ford in general, but it seems that only
sophomores will soon have access to
them.
Toyon residents were also dissatisfied
that students' opinions were not really
sought out. "They should listen to the stu
dents' wants. No one came to ask us."
Ockhurt/ said
Toyon's resident fellow. Assoc. Me
chanical Engineering Prof. Rolf Paste
agreed that the freshman energy
going to be missed but added that the
change would create '"bonding among a
class."
"Tovon would be a place u here people
who want lo have a class spirit can
have a class spirit." Faste added.
He mentioned that another up
shot would be that more attention
could be given to the special advis
ing needs of the sophomores.
No concrete programs have been
laid out yet. but sophomores draw
ing into Toyon next year should ex
pect to receive good academic ad
vice, ranging from help in choosing
their majors to gettinglhc kind of tu

toring they need.
There were also mixed senti
ments about the impending loss of
freshmen in Kimball. The house's
RF, Linguistics Prof. John Rickford,
said he would regret the loss of the
dormitory-wide excitement created
by the freshmen.
Many residents agreed with
Rickford. and there was also con
sensus that Manzanita Park would
become quieter than ever, almost
like Governor's Corner.
Others, like freshman Melvvn
Lim. were supportive and said they
preferred this kind of serene setting.
