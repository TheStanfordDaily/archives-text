# THE
						1998 BATTLE OF THE BANDS
## 
### Brad Kane Contributing writer 
It's near the end of winter
quarter, which means it's time
for Stanford's independent mu
sic scene to converge on Toyon
Hall for Phi Kappa Psi's eighth
annual Battle of the Bands.
The Battle of the Bands pits
Stanford's best rock groups
against one another in an all-or
nothing competition for the ti
tle of best band on campus.
Always an arena for glorious
victories and crushing defeats,
this year's event should prove to
be a memorable musical war.
In the past, this tete-a-tete of
live music and undaunted instru
mental aggression has included
bands of all shapes, sizes and gen
res, from ska and punk to good
old rock 'n' roll. It's the one event
of the year in which Stanford
bands are not merely background
entertainment but are the pri
mary focus of the evening.
"It's not a typical fraternity
party," said senior Anthony
Palreiro, the Phi Psi publicity
manager for the event. "Our goal
for Battle of the Bands is to pro
vide a showcase for various cam
pus bands to come and play for a
large audience."
The Battle of the Bands is
one of several annual events held
by the Phi Psis, a2l -member un
housed fraternity. It is almost
certainly their most well-known
event and arguably their most
enjoyable. They will be joined at
the event by their co-hosts, the
Chi Omega sorority.
"The Battle of the Bands
brings Stanford talent together
and exposes them to the rest of
the University," said senior Nick
Bourke, Phi Psi president. "We
try to get the best bands that
Stanford has to offer, and we try
to expose students to a wider
range of musical genres than
they're used to."
"The Battle of the Bands is
one of the reasons I decided to be
social chair," said junior Dan
Ginsberg, who is responsible for
running the event. "It's always
been a really fun event to hold,
even when the fraternity had only
eight people in it."
For many Stanford students,
the Battle of the Bands is the
year's best opportunity to see
what campus bands are made of.
"There will be alcohol, but peo
ple don't go there just to drink,"
Bourke said. "They go to dance
and to listen to the bands."

A glimpse at battles past
The Battle of the Bands be
gan in 1991 as a publicity event
for the Phi Psis. The fraternity
wanted to organize an event
that would showcase campus
bands before a larger audience
than that at a Coffee House
show or at a fraternity party.
The Battle of the Bands quickly
became one of the most popu
lar events of the year and has
been held annually ever since.
A four-year graduation cycle
means that many past Battles are
all but forgotten, but the most re
cent years' showdowns are still
fresh in many people's memories.
Last year's winner, bad-boy
ska band Lifskada, emerged vic
torious after having been de
feated the previous year by cam
pus favorite Odd Job. During
the 1996 Battle, Lifskada was
known as Ska'd For Life; the
members changed the name af
ter recording their first album.
Other 1996 runners-up in
cluded cover band Aunt Beru,
Jelly Roll and Jacob's Purge.
Among the bands that
Lifskada defeated last year
were pop band Too Much Neon
(one of this year's six con
tenders), FELLOW, Labrosse
King and Honeydew (from
which two of this year's bands
have taken members).
"I don't really remember the
first Battle of the Bands that we
played in," Lifskada trombonist
Brad Laybourne said, "because
the horn section and 1 were un
der such heavy sedation. But
last year was a real thrill."
Winning the Battle of the
Bands was an overdue triumph
for Lifskada, which broke up
shortly thereafter. But despite
the tragedies that have befallen
the band since then — includ
ing one member being charged
with attempted manslaughter
and another killed in a drunk
driving accident — victory has
ensured Lifskada a spot in
Stanford musical history along
side Odd Job and the five previ
ous winners. This year, another
band will step into Stanford
fame.
A fight to the death
The Battle of the Bands is
not quite yet the ultimate music
showdown. In the past, bands
have complained that the
acoustics in Toyon make it diffi
cult to put on a good show.
"It's a very well-organized
event," Laybourne said, "but
Toyon is horrible acoustically."

Similar concerns have been
voiced by other past com
petitors.
The Phi Psis are aware of
the situation, but are doing
the best they can for the time
being. "We've been hoping to
eventually move to some
where bigger, like Frost
Amphitheater," Palreiro said.
On the brighter side, the
judging method used at the
Battle of the Bands has a rep
utation for being at least
somewhat fair. Bands are

judged by a panel of judges se
lected from various music-re
lated areas of campus. This
year's panel will be composed of
three judges — one from
Stanford's Music Department,
one from KZSU and one from
Intermission.
According to Ginsberg, the
judges are selected to represent
diverse points of view within the
Stanford music scene. By ensur
ing that the judges are musically
proficient, bands can be judged
on their musical merit and not
just on the amount of hype
they've received.
"Because the Phi Psis choose
their judges from the Music
Department and from KZSU,"
Laybourne said, "the winner has
always been the band that most
deserved to win. Two years ago,
Odd Job deserved to win, and
they did. Last year, we really
were the best band out there,
and so we won."
In choosing this year's winner,
the judges will have to rate each
band on four different criteria:
• Musicianship — the ability to
play an interesting tune and not
simply repeat the same chord
over and over again.
• Showmanship — how well the
band interacts with the audi
ence they're playing for.
• Variation — the uniqueness
from one song to the next.
• Balance — meaning that no
one instrument should be over
powering the rest.

Judges assign each band a
point value from 3 to 8 in each
of the various categories, and
the cumulative scores deter
mine the winner.
Although not every band
plays to win, there are definitely
incentives to coming out on top.
In addition to the mere glory of
winning the Battle of the Bands,
this year's victor will receive a
number of prizes from the
event's various local sponsors.
Prizes also traditionally go to the
first and second runners-up.
In past years, winning bands
have received gift certificates to
Tower Records, Pizz'a Chicago,
Groovesmith and various audio
/ video stores, as well as chances
to play live on KZSU.
The Battle continues...
This year's Battle of the
Bands will be a six-way show
down between a diverse group
of Stanford-affiliated bands:
• Too Much Neon — one of last
year's runners-up.
• Graham Crackers Everywhere
— a funk and folk band com
posed of three guitars and a
bass.
• Eating Like Truck Drivers — a
punk-indie-hybrid trio.
• The Reagle Beagle — a pop
band with a lyrical twist.
• The Low Down Blues Revue
— a spin-off of Ware Wendell
and His Hep Blues Quartet, an
other popular campus
band.
• The Limits — a "jam rock 'n'

roll band" and
last-minute ad
dition to the Battle.
Each band will play a 35-
minute set. The winner will be
announced by the judges at the
end of the night.
With blues, punk and
acoustic funk all on the sched
ule, Saturday's Battle promises
to be lively, entertaining and
enjoyable for musicians and
fans alike.
So may the best band win
— and let the Battle begin.

THE LOW DOWN
BLUES REVUE
Ware Wendell: Vocals,
Harmonica, "A bit of slide
guitar"
RJ Bunnell: Guitar
Jon Weil: Drums
The Low Down Blues
Revue is actually "Ware

Wendell and His Hep Blues
Quartet" in trio formation.
(Jacob Eisenstein, the bassist,
will be MIA at the Battle.)
Playing everything from '50s
era Chicago blues to R&B and
soul, this band has earned a
name for itself at campus gigs
over the course of the past year.
"We've been extremely
pleased with the enthusiastic re
sponse that we've received from
the campus," said Wendell, the
lead singer. We're glad to be able
to lay this timeless music out in
front of the people, as such mu
sic is the root of much modern
American music."
This is the first year that either
variation of the bhies band will be
playing at the Battle of the Bands.
Hoping to create an " M-school,
back porch" sound at is year's
Battle, the Low Down Blues
Revue promises to be one of the
night's more intimate sets.
"We're not necessarily set
upon winning the Battle,"
Wendell said. "We just want
people to have a good time,
shake their hips and learn a lit
tle something about blues mu
sic in the process."
EATING LIKE TRUCK
DRIVERS
Erin Thompson: Bass Guitar
Susan Helfter: Guitar
Steve Enstad: Drums
The newest band to play at

this year's Battle, indie
punk trio Eating Like
Truck Drivers in its pre
sent form is only 3 1/2
weeks old. That's not to say
that the band doesn't have
any experience — in fact,
its music has already been
heard at venues across the
country.
Eating Like Truck
Drivers, in its pre-Enstad
formation, went on a na
tional tour in September
to raise money for charity.
Dubbed the "Keep on

Graham Crackers
Everywhere, a multi-voiced
strings-only band mixes har
monious music and a dose of
good humor. Known for play
ing small shows and encourag
ing audience participation,
Graham Crackers Everywhere
has recently taken on a bassist
and is highly anticipating
Saturday's performance.
"We're about as psyched
about the Battle of the Bands as
we were to find out who shot
Mr. Burns," said Matt Linden.
Describing themselves as "a
kind of acoustic combination of
funk, groovy folk rock and
beer,"the band's philosophy on
life is on a par with their music.
"We try not to take life too seri
ously," Linden said.
Fitting well with their par
ticular style of music and inter
action is the attitude the band
takes toward the audiences they
play for. "We think that there's a
guitar player in every one of
you," Linden said. "Anyone is
welcome to come up on stage
with us."
THE REAGLE BEAGLE
Siddharth Kakodkar: Guitar,
Lead Vocals, Mother Brain
Krishna Yeshwant: Bass-Bandit
Naveen Pai: Drum God
Kelvin Wu: Keyboard Ninja
Eric Li: Background Vocals
"We play pop music with
extremely politically incorrect
lyrical content," said Siddharth
Kakodkar, the lead singer and
guitarist of The Reagle Beagle.
"Once people realize that our
lyrics and subject matter don t
really mean anything, only then
will people be able to enjoy our
music."
Despite being composed
primarily of members from the
Midwest, the Reagle Beagle has
become a runaway hit on the
Indian subcontinent. With
three albums already produced
and a no. 1 hit on Bombay radio
stations, The Reagle Beagle is a
band that knows what it likes to
do and likes to do it well.
According to Kakodkar, "It's
all about having a good time
and having the right to express
whatever uncouth feelings we
may have."
Two new additions to the
band, drummer Naveen Pai and
keyboardist Kelvin Wu, may
help take the Reagle Beagk to

Truckin' Tour," bassist Erin
Thompson and guitarist Susan
Helfter started in Maine and
finished in Texas, playing shows
in Boston and Washington D.C.
along the way.
Steve Enstad, the newest ad
dition, played in last year's run
ner-up band Honeydew. He will
be competing this year against
ex-comrade John Cha, who is
now in Too Much Neon.
Now that Thompson,
Helfter and Enstad have come
together, they're unstoppable. "I
haven't slept since the band got
together," said Thompson, who
is pumped for this year's Battle.
"We've got an amazing energy
in our band that's out of control
... and we love playing."
A cross between hard core
punk and modern indie rock,
Eating Like Truck Drivers may
prove to be one of this year s
most cranked-up perfor
mances. "Super-psyched" to hit
the stage on Saturday night,
Thompson has no doubt that
her band will put on an amaz
ing show. "We're gonna win,"
she said.
GRAHAM CRACKERS
EVERYWHERE
Zach Roberts: Guitar, Vocals
Elliott Stein: Bass Guitar
Matt Linden: Guitar, Vocals
Seth Weisburst: Guitar, Vocals

the top on Saturday. "Naveen is
one of the best drummers I've
ever seen,'' Kakodkar said.
"Krishna is flawless in his
bass fundamentals," Kakodkar
continued. "Eric sort ot hangs
out with the crowd and lets
them sing into his mic, and that
leaves me as the scapegoat for
our lyrics ''
The Reagle Beagle has high
hopes for Saturday's competi
tion. "The Battle of the Bands
gives the underdog bands like
us a chance to beat down the
more accepted and overhyped
bands in pure musical combat,
Kakodkar said. "We are ready to J
do battle."
TOO MUCH NEON
Kim Coffey: Lead Vocals
Wendy Marinaccio: Drums
Danny Morrow: Guitar
John Cha: Bass Guitar
Despite the recent addition
of bassist John Cha, pop rock
group Too Much Neon is one of
oldest bands playing this year's
battle — and the only repeat
performer. Last year they
ranked third in what was essen
tially their first campus perfor
mance, but this year they have
experience and confidence on
their side.
"Last year we were strug
gling to play for 35 minutes,"
said guitarist Danny Morrow,
"whereas now we're used to 1
1/2 to 2-hour sets. We have to
pick and choose what our best
songs are."
With Morrow's British-in
fluenced guitar playing, the
funked-out drumming of
Wendy Marinaccio and the
unique lyrical style ot Kim
Coffey, Too Much Neon pre
sents pop music with thought
behind it.
In an added twist to this
year's Battle of the Bands,
bassist Cha will be pitted
against fellow ex-Honeydewer
Steve Enstad, who is playing
drums this year for Eating Like
Truck Drivers.
As for their second perfor
mance at the Battle of the
Bands, Too Much Neon is sim
ply looking forward to the
chance to play for a large audi
ence. "We played last year and it
was a good experience, and I
feel like we've learned a lot since
' then," Morrow said. "But now
' we're just playing because we
i like to play."
