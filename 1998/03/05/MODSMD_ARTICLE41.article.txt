## Apartment Life Ivy 
### 
Although you may have
never paid any atten
tion to Ivy, you proba
bly know its songs. The
group has had a song in a
Volkswagen commercial;
MTV loves to use its sadder,
more introspective songs for
background music on "The
Real World"; and its bassist
wrote the theme song for
"That Thing You Do!" the
sparsely attended Tom Hanks
movie of the same name.
Plus, Ivy's new album
features one track with Luna's
Dean Wareham and another
with James Iha from the
Smashing Pumpkins. All of
this positions Ivy somewhere
between obscurity and your
dad humming one of the
group's songs in the shower.
But enough about the

band's unrequited fame.
What exactly does this over /
underexposed band sound
like? Well, think a sweeter,
less clever Luna with a
French female singer.
"Apartment Life" con
tinues the successful formula
Ivy has developed over its
past two albums: smooth vo
cals and delicate guitars over
the twists of bells, horns and
synthesizers. Few songs are
amazing, but even fewer are
bad, with most of the songs
falling somewhere in be
tween. The album makes nice
background music to play
while you do something artsy
on a rainy day.
"The Best Thing" and
"I've Got a Feeling" are typi
cal Ivy fare with catchy cho
ruses and reflective (though

not too deep) lyrics. "This is
the Day" sounds a lot like
The Beautiful South (minus
the cheesy lyrics), and the
wahwah guitars of "You
Don't Know Anything" are a
refreshing addition amidst all
of the other clean-cut songs
on this album.
At its best, Ivy will have
you singing along, pondering
your failed relationships in
endearing, rhyming couplets.
And luckily, at its worst, Ivy
isn't bad just forgettable. It
makes you temporarily lose
sight of the music and turn
your attention elsewhere. But
for a band whose mainstream
exposure has been all about
background, perhaps this is
no compliment after all.
