# Arnold. David Arnold...who?
## Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold 
### 
Picture all the James Bond movies you've ever seen. Fast forward to the scene
where Mr. Bond enters the bad guy's cocktail party in full tuxedo. Rewind
to right before 007 walks in, and replace the bad guy's party with an un
derground rave.
Have your voice-over man say, "We've secretly replaced Mr. Bond's arch
enemy's upscale black tie party with an underground rave. Let's see what hap
pens." Then run the scene and you've got The David Arnold James Bond Project.
Arnold has taken the themes from 10 Bond flicks plus the original James

Bond theme and transformed
them as no remake has done
before. Using hyped-up
rhythms and effects, he has
made each song more dra
matic, more rhythmic and in
some ways more Bond-like.
Although covers of
songs that drastically alter the
original can sometimes be
disastrous (Remember Cake's
downtrodden version of "I
Will Survive?"), Arnold man
ages to make the conversion
with style. Adding synthesized
sound effects, exotic instru
mental and a host of featured
guests to the original lyrics
and blaring horns, Arnold
brings the music of Bond to a
new and largely appropriate
musical element.
In terms of melodies
and vocals, the songs stick
fairly well to their predeces
sors. Indeed, most also get an
added kick from Arnold's cre
ative insights.

With a tune whose title has inspired jewelers everywhere, Arnold starts the
album with "Diamonds Are Forever," in which a soft, spooky organ intro quickly
turns to strong, menacing horns. At times the song wafts mysteriously through the
air, but at other times it sounds like more of a techno-lounge singer's solo than a
Bond theme.
By contrast, "ThunderbalT sports the same swanky horns and orchestral stabs
that have become the secret agent's signature music style. With Martin Fry's teasing
vocals, this tune best imitates its original.
On the other hand, LTJ Bukem's version of "The James Bond Theme" com
pletely misses the tone and style of the original. The only part of Bukem's version

remotely like the original is the catchy initial horn blare immediately recogniz
able as Bond. As a well-mixed tune with cool sound effects and a jazz-club feel,
Bukem's song is fine to listen to, but it's definitely disappointing as a James Bond
theme.
It's almost as if Bukem wrote the song separate from this project, and threw
in the starting horn notes to get it on the album.
Still, most of the other songs on the album work well. Aimee Mann's strong
vocals are unfazed by the mix of a capella and strong rhythms on "Nobody Does

it Better," a song whose tempo
alternates between floating on a
misty river and strutting the
streets on a Saturday night.
Meanwhile the
Propellerheads are all disco in
"On Her Majesty's Secret
Service," driving the song with a
repetitive but moving bass line
and quick, funky guitar strum
ming. 1 can't remember if the
original tune had lyrics or not,
but the Propellerheads do fine
without them, keeping to the
original melody while adding
their own funk-based solos.
Natacha Atlas, an artist
who is used to mixing musical
styles from her experience with
techno-enhanced world music,
sings sweetly on "From Russia
with Love." This tune makes
you sway along with Atlas' drift
ing vocals and just the right
amount of back-up beats.
Despite all the creative in
terpretations on the album,
there's still one major problem

with it: no "Goldfinger." It's possible that Arnold considered rearranging that song
but didn't think he could do it justice, but it's more likely that he either forgot about
it or didn't think it important to include. But no collection of Bond theme songs
could possibly be complete without "the man with the Midas touch." The omission
is completely unforgivable. How could you possibly leave that one out?
No one knows how many sequels there will be to this longest-running movie
series or how successful each will be. But one thing's for sure: where there's a Bond
flick, there's a Bond song. And that makes it all good.
