# Victoria Williams: 'Musings Of a Creekdipper'
## 
### 
The most coherent thing about Victoria
Williams' "Musings of a Creekdipper" is
her voice. It's a captivating cross between
Neil Young and Tori Amos. It also has a whiny,
childish quality that becomes extraordinarily
grating over the course of the album.
Williams is deeply influenced by the freak
ish construction of Frank Zappa's songs. But
whereas Zappa's brilliant innovations meandered
among pop, rock and classical, "Musings of a
Creekdipper" sticks mainly to the folk side of
things.
"Musings of a Creekdipper" is not as likely
to influence future musicians to the extent that
Zappa did. Most of what's here has been done
before in one way or another, although Williams
does bring her own ideas to the table.
The album starts with "Periwinkle Sky," a
platonic version of many of the album's songs
with an orchestral mix of piano, strings and
horns that barely follow a musical timetable.
"Rainmaker" has more coherent move
ment and organization of melodies. It also has
the sparse piano and strings that permeate this
album, and the effect is softly gorgeous.
"Kashmir's Corn" is driven by spacey
banjo plunking. Williams' voice here

is as mature as it gets — i.e., not very.
The album peaks early with "Train Song,"
a slinky, sexy funk. "It ain't no use / there ain't
no caboose," she laments.
Unfortunately, the album goes into a long,
lethargic slide. "Last Word," "Nature Boy," "Tree
Song," "Let It Be So," "Allergic Boy" and
"Grandpa In the Cornpatch" are all variations
on a none-too-captivating theme. Low drum
rumblings, floating woodwinds, sudden horn
entrances, tinkling bells and brief classic rock
samples form somewhat straightforward
melodies that support Williams' dynamic vo
cals.
Two songs close out the album well.
"Humming Bird" is an excellent upbeat folk
tune with banjo and harmonica riffs, and
"Blackbirds Rise" is a slow, beautiful groove.
"Musings of a Creekdipper" is tough to get
a grip on. It doesn't have any sort of stabilizing
musical quality, and the experimental aspect of it
doesn't reveal anything greater than itself. I give
Williams props for trying, but it just isn't one for
the ages.
