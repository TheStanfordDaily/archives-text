# Freakwater: 'Springtime'
## 
### 
In "Springtime," Freakwater
proves that classic country
sounds can still emanate from the
earth, and that popular evildoers like
Alan "Crazy About a Ford Truck"
Jackson and Garth Brooks have not
yet completely destroyed mankind's
relationship with The Country God
in the Sky.
Congratulate the creator for
Louisville's Freakwater before light
ning riddles your village. If you live in
Branson, evacuate at once. The black
crack opening in the heavens has al
ready swallowed Kenny Rogers and
Lee Greenwood, and they want you
too, new country listener. They want
you, too.
Freakwater's songs explore
tragedies of the high Appalachia
through personal lyrics about dead
lovers, liquor, dead children and
soured relationships. With themes
like these, a televised Central Park gig
with rock'n'roll hobbit Billy Joel is
nearly impossible.
Their prime directive is to forge
a contemporary link to the dark re
gions that legendary hillbilly blues
men inhabit. Hank Williams did not
drink himself to death in his parked
Cadillac for line dancing.
Dark numbers like "Picture in

My Mind," with lines like "Whiskey /
is not evil / when it's sitting / on the
shelf ...A Shotgun / never shot no
one / when it's hanging / on the wall,"
similarly tackle the big issues.
The band's sound also harkens
back to a day before Barbara Mandrell
sold bowel-clearing prunes on televi
sion. Vocalists Catherine Irwin and
Janet Beveridge Bean harmonize in
clear dewy tones reminiscent of the
Carter Family.
Plain, congenial bluegrass
strings accompany the vocals in pro
gressions that Bill Monroe and the
Blue Grass Boys would easily recog
nize if they were within earshot of the
new CD and still alive. This is sincere
bluegrass country, and the only thing
dating Freakwater is its name.
If Freakwater was"The
Dewridge Mountain Sisters," it could
be on the bill of a 1940s bluegrass fes
tival.
I would advise you to acquire
"Springtime" for your collection, but
I am not familiar with your financial
situation. It is more important to eat
than to listen to music.
