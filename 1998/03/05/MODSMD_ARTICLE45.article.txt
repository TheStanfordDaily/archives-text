## Ah, the joys of youth... 
### 
In the tradition of
movies based on
British novels comes
an elegant adaptation of
Virginia Woolf's "Mrs.
Dalloway." The movie is a
period piece complete
with the lush backdrop
of England's countryside
and costume of upper
class British society.
Set in 1923, "Mrs.
Dalloway" follows the life
and thoughts of Clarissa
(Academy Award-winner
Vanessa Redgrave) as she
plans for a dinner party
and reflects on the
choices she made in her
youth. Now a 50-year-old
woman, Clarissa remi
nisces about a summer 30
years earlier when she
chose to marry stable

politician Richard Dalloway
(John Standing) rather
than the passionate and
adventurous Peter Walsh
(Michael Kitchen).
Switching back and
forth between the country
side of Clarissa's youth and
the townhouse she cur
rendy inhabits, the movie

contrasts the innocent
beauty of youth and the
lost ideals of experience.
The young Clarissa
(Natascha McElhone) is an
alluring young woman
who dances between the
hearts of two men, toying
coyly with them as she tries
to decide who to marry.

We see all of
Clarissa's beauty as she
smiles innocently at her
suitors, kisses her best
friend and laughs lightly
with a gentle tilt of her
head. We envy her, un
derstand her and relate to
her. She is youthful and
represents the choices

that we as college stu
dents will have to make.
As my roommate
and I watched the movie,
we were swollen with bit
tersweet feelings. We re
alized that we are as
young and innocent as
Clarissa was, but that one
day all of this will go
away. We live our youth
forgetting its joy and
watch the years go by un
til we are like Mrs.
Dalloway, reflecting on
our lost ideals.
The older Clarissa
manifests her feelings at
the end of the movie in a
soliloquy. She seems to
accept the life that has
been handed to her: the
stable and confining role
of a housewife in the
early 20th century. But at

the same time, she is sad
that the years have gone
by without fulfilling the
dreams of her youth.
"Mrs. Dalloway"
touches on all the ques
tions and reflections of
lost youth, but it pales in
comparison to the cine
matography of "The
Wings of the Dove" or the
acting of "Sense and
Sensibility." The beauty of
"Mrs. Dalloway" is in its
ability to touch a chord
deep within — one that
urgently wants to sustain
the vitality of life while ac
cepting its transience.
As Clarissa wishes
at the end of the movie, "I
want to tell each moment
to stay, stay, stay."
Only in memories
Clarissa, only in memories.
