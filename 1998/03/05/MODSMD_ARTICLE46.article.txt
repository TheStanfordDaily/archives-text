# Kissing David Schwimmer is like kissing a fool...but Jason Lee shines in this romantic comedy
## 
### 
If David Schwimmer's whiny
schtick as Ross on "Friends"
hasn't already driven away
any interested party, his ludi
crously aggravating turn as Max
Abbitt in "Kissing a Fool" is cer
tain to alienate the rest of
America. Flowever, all is not lost
for the Film as whole, which is
redeemed (as much as it can be)
by the humorous and endearing
performance of Jason Lee.
Known previously for
playing two identical foul

mouthed, Sega-obsessed char
acters in two very different
Kevin Smith movies
("Mallrats" and "Chasing
Amy"), Lee shows more depth
in "Kissing." He plays the role
of Jay, a super-sensitive writer
nursing a broken heart.
Schwimmer gets his big chance
to say all the nasty lines and at
tempt to be macho (he really
likes sports and really hates
French novelists) as Jay's best
friend and antithesis.

Jay fixes Max up with his
cute and perky editor Sam (Mili
Avatal), and Max and Sam be
come engaged. This puts an end
to Max's philandering ways. Yet
Max becomes unsure of Sam's
fidelity, and naturally he insists
that Jay put her to the test by
trying to seduce her,
Schwimmer is the major
failing of the film, as he only
becomes more grating and
sniveling as the movie pro
gresses. The audience is ex
pected to believe that a multi
tude of beautiful women would
demand to sleep with a greasy
haired version of Ross endlessly
intoning the ultra-cool catch
phrase, "What up?"
Lee's muddled Jay, luck
ily, gives "Kissing a Fool" a
sweet and sympathetic charac
ter to care about. Of course, the
sly and biting comedian that
gave "Mallrats" its hilarity
emerges enough to keep the
growing emotion Jay feels for

Sam from descending into
saccharine. The scenes with
Lee have a tongue-in-cheek
aspect (he listens to Air
Supply when depressed) that
provide laughs as an antidote
to a plodding plot and the
mad-at-the-world sportscaster
Max.
The resolution of the tri
angle is slightly disappointing,
focusing more on wordless
montages of strolls along Lake
Michigan rather than any
meaningful interactions be
tween the characters.
Nevertheless — without giving
too much away of a fairly pre
dictable plot — Max is able to
learn the value of reading and
appreciate European culture
(two things that are very im
portant for redemption and
growing as a person) and Jason
Lee is able to rise above a one
dimensional movie while still
maintaining his dignity.
Furthermore, "Kissing a
Fool" proves that any movie
that features Air Supply can't
be all bad, even if it puts David
Schwimmer anywhere near a
bottle of whipped cream. What
up with that?

Maybe the movie would be better with a menage-a-trois.
