# Crashed and Burned
## 'Burn Hollywood Burn' is worse than an Alan Smithee film 
### 
loe Eszterhas has made a ca
reer out of being bitter.
"Basic Instinct" and
Showgirls," two of his more
notorious films, seemed to be
the direct result of Eszterhas's
misogynist streak. Critics attribute
this to his alleged lack of success
with women earlier in life.
Now, Eszterhas has turned
his bitterness toward an institu
tion whose scorn for him is
more than alleged: Hollywood.
The result is "An Alan Smithee
Film: Burn Hollywood Burn."
This is quite possibly the single
most boring movie to have ever

been released. It's 86 minutes
long, but it feels at least twice as
long as "Titanic."
Exacerbating the unre
lenting is the sheer nausea that
comes from watching a bunch
of smug, self-conscious actors
who seem to think they deserve
a medal for biting the movie
making hand that feeds them.
The premise of "Burn
Hollywood Burn" is as follows: In
La-La Land, when a director cre
ates a film too heinous to associ
ate his name with, he is allowed
by the Hollywood powers-that-be
to take the alias "Alan Smithee."

Thus there are a bunch of horrid
films out there attributed to the
fictitious Alan Smithee.
Our hero, however, is a di
rector whose name is actually
Alan Smithee (Gee, that's quite a
high-concept premise). So when
he directs what he considers to
be the worst movie ever made,
he has no other choice but to
take the film hostage and turn
Hollywood on its ear. Does hi
larity ensue? Um, no. The only
thing that ensues is self-con
scious acting, atrociously obvi
ous script-writing and ridicu
lous stereotyping. For a brief
moment, I thought that maybe
these jokes would only be funny
to Hollywood insiders, but then
I realized they wouldn't be
funny to anyone.
Is it ironic that the direc
tor's credit for the lame and pre
tentious "Burn Hollywood Burn"
is given to "Alan Smithee?" I
highly doubt it. If 1 had directed
"Burn Hollywood Burn," there is
NO WAY I would have let my
name be associated with it.
