# Tribal Antics
## Krippendorf's Tribe' is primitive but fun 
### 
I wondered why nobody
could remember the name
of the film "Krippendorf's
Tribe" after seeing it. I figured
the reason probably had to do
with the fact that this is not a
very memorable film. However,
I did enjoy its outrageous situa
tional comedy.
The story is simple: James
Krippendorf (Richard Dreyfuss),
an anthropology professor, has
managed to squander a $100,000
research grant to find the last
unknown tribe of New Guinea.
To avoid revealing his embezzle
ment, he must convince his boss
that he actually succeeded. So he
invents a tribe that happens to
look a lot like his own family.
Considering that he is single
with three rebellious kids,
Krippendorf's tribe is quite
interesting.
When Krippendorf's new
colleague, Veronica Micelli
(lenna Elfman) starts meddling
in the professor's affairs, the

tribe becomes a national phe
nomenon. To satisfy the public's
curiosity, Krippendorf is forced
to produce fake videos about
the tribe's customs.
His first film is about "a
rare circumcision ritual" while
his next film features the tribe's
sex life. I thought this was all
pretty funny, but one parent
with young children obviously
didn't agree when he left the
theater with his kids.
Another big part of the
film is the tribal leader's arrival in
America. While seeing this char
acter misbehaving on talk shows
and frightening little old ladies is
quite enjoyable, it is clearly not
ground breaking material.
The script is typical of

many Disney films. The charac
ters are all stereotypes placed in
unrealistic situations. Dreyfuss,
in the role of the professor who
gets himself caught deeper and
deeper in his own lies, is the
only character I could sympa
thize with. Elfman, on the other
hand, was unrelenting in her
ability to be annoying. In the
end the kids saved the situation,
just the way things are supposed
to be in Disney movies.
I've seen many better
movies. But in the end, the up
beat soundtrack, the no-non
sense humor and the feel-good
ending all made this an hour
and a half well spent during a
dreary day.

Richard Dreyfuss went from "Mr. Holland's Opus" to this?
