# 27-word fiction
## Editor's Picks 
### 
Hello* and welcome to yet another install
ment of the 27-word fiction contest. This week
we have even more risk-takers than before, in
cluding someone who likes to write about lacta
tion, someone fond of dead languages, and some
one s AIDS commentary.
The next issue will come out during Dead

Week on Wednesday, March 11 instead of March
12. Please be sure to get your entries in early.
There were a few of you who we did not publish
this week due to the usual reason: wrong word
count. We don't want 27 words or less. We want
27 words, period. Don't make me get my switch.
