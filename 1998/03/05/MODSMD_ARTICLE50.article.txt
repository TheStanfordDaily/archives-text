Flavored condoms. Lickable
lube. Edible panties. You'd never
spend your hard-earned cash on
such things, but still, you're cu
rious. You know how condoms
work and how regular lubricant
feels, but that's not the issue.
Functionality may be impor
tant, but what you really want to
know is, how do they taste?
Taste is obviously a very
subjective quality, so I would
never dream of using this col
umn as a forum for uneducated
opinion. In order to assure a
broad spectrum of preferences,
I rounded up an ace team of
food testers to sample an as
sortment of flavored products:
health-minded housemate Bio
Dude, intrepid roommate
Venus Flytrap, former hallmate
Cookie and semi-reluctant
neighbor Dr. Johnny Fever. We
tried a carefully selected array
of lotions and potions obtained
at sex shops around the city,
paying careful attention to
color, flavor and scent ...
Warming lotions
These are meant for mas
sages, but they won't harm la
tex like most massage oils and
lotions will. And they actually
do generate heat, at least for
some people — a little heat if
you rub on it, and a little more
if you blow or breathe on it.
We tried Midnite Fire
brand's passion fruit flavor
($6.50). The Bio Dude ap
proved of its ingredients
(which include methylparaben
and B vitamins), though he had
trouble detecting the warming
effect. All of us liked the taste
and the sweet smell. The one
downside is the candy-scented
residue it leaves all over every
thing — your skin, your lips,
your sheets ...
Lubes
I have to admit that I've
never met a lube I liked. Sure,
they can be useful, but every
variety I've ever encountered
has had an unmistakably
chemical smell and taste.
We sampled the most pop
ular flavored lube, I-D brand's
pina colada splash flavor
($6.50). I really liked the smell
— sort of like that coconut
scented suntan oil. The Bio
Dude, Cookie, Dr. Johnny and I
all tasted a nauseating combi
nation of pina colada and med
ical chemicals. Venus liked it so
much, she wanted to use it as a
cocktail mixer.
Latex
We sampled three different
kinds — a banana flavored
Trustex lubricated condom (40
cents); a Kiss of Mint flavored
LifeStyles unlubed condom (40

cents); and a strawberry flavored
Lixx latex dental dam ($1.50).
The Trustex condom did
not meet with much approval.
The banana flavor hardly even
attempted to cover up the dis
tinctive lube taste and the smell
was equally offensive.
The Lixx dam wasn't much
better, as the strawberry flavor
was barely present. Though at
least after the flavoring wore
off, it just tasted like latex and
not lube.
The LifeStyles condom is
the unquestionable latex win
ner. The mint flavor is strong,
and since there's no lube, mint
is all you taste. Mmm ...
Edible underwear
Up till now we've been deal
ing with some fairly serious
products. The flavorings and
brand names might be a bit
silly, but everything has been at
least somewhat useful. Not so
with edible panties.
We tried banana-flavored
Edible Undies ($7.99). The
photo on the front of the box
features a shapely posterior
wearing sexy, satiny red panties.
One would naturally assume
that the panties inside bear at
least a small resemblance to the
panties on the cover, but one
would be wrong. Open the box,
and out falls a very small, very
thin plastic bag containing
what Dr. Johnny called "a fruit
roll-up loincloth."
It's a flat, plastic-like gar
ment, made mostly of cellulose
and saccharine, which you tie
around your waist with plastic
like strings. Just taking it out of
the package dyed my fingers a
radioactive yellow that didn't
fade for two days.
I couldn't bring myself to
try it on. A dye that tenacious
has to be something pretty
powerful, and I'm not about to
let a chemical like that go any
where near my tender parts.
Even a dedicated researcher
such as myself has her limits.
I cut them up into bite-size
pieces, and we all had a taste.
"Kinda plasticky," Cookie said.
No one could taste the banana
flavor at all. I had to brush my
teeth to rid my mouth of the
gluey residue. I can't imagine
anyone having more than one
lick, let alone eating an entire
pair. And let's try not to imag
ine the way they must stick to
skin and hair...
Based on these results, the
panel regretfully doesn't care
for the products tested except
for the Midnite Fire lotion and
the Kiss of Mint condom. If
you've got an oral fixation to
satisfy, you might do better to
look around in your kitchen.
Chocolate is always fun, as is
cream, or ice or fruit — why,
the possibilities are endless ...
