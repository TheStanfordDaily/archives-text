# Interco-op Council gets back in action
## Focus: advocating housing alternatives 
### Erica Platt 
Since it was reactivated two
months ago. the Interco-op Council
has found itself working hard to con
vince administrators and students of
the value of alternative forms of
housing.
Students living in co-ops formed
the council to voice their concerns
about recent housing changes .Â»nd
other issues. According to senior
Barbie Wong, the resident assistant
in Synergy, council members "arc
not against the University, but we
want to maintain a comfortable envi
ronment where students can address
common issues. l"his type of dialogue
is fostered in the co-op community."
One area of activitv for the coun

cil concerns the recently announced
plans to house the Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority in what is now Alpha
Sigma.
Circulating petitions to save
Alpha Sig. their mission is clear: to
make the statement that the students
need a voice in the way the Office of
Residential Education handles resi
dent concerns.
While Wong acknowledges that
"the I niversity has a legal obligation
to provide equal housing opportuni
ties to fraternities and sororities, it is
unfortunate that well-established
groups are being torn apart."
l"hc Interco-op Council is not new
to campus. Ten to 15 years ago. an
other council organized co-op out
reach meetings to introduce addi
tional living options to students un
familiar with co-ops.
The council was revived this
year, according to Columbae RA
Samar Mehta, because "co-op resi
dents feel strongly about a number
of housing issues on campus. The re
cent (Muwekma l'ah Ruk] petition,
which was designed to ensure that
residents of Muwekma kept their
home, had a 70-percent signature
rate from co-op residents."
Residents of self-ops such as
ZAI' voiced similar concerns. Ju
nior (ieoffrey (Jaislord. who lives in
ZAP. noted that there has been talk
of the possible formation of an
Inter-C owell Council aimed at facil
itating communication between
Cowcll Cluster residents and Res
F.d. (iaisford added that such com
munication has in the past, "been
virtually nonexistent and character
ized by animosity."
"In the past, the University has
threatened co-ops." Wong added.
" Today, we want tocreate an aware
ness among administrators and the
student body that there are housing
options outside of traditional dorms.
People should know that co-ops are
a great alternative."
Council members hope that such
understanding will come next quar
ter during the planned Co-op
Awareness Week, which will ex
plain co-op living arrangements in
freshman dorms.
