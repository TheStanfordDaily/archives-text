1998 Rebele Journalism Internships
Work at a weekly newspaper in California and earn a reporter's salary! Students
can write and report the news, or work in advertising, circulation, or production.
Internships generally last about 12 weeks.
Here are some comments from past interns:
Intern for the Pacifica Tribune
" The editor let me try a little of everything, including news, features, sports, and even
a personal column. The staff at the Tribune made me feel welcome immediately, and
I learned a lot about community journalism "
Intern for the Mountain View Voice
'It definitely cemented my drive to want to be a journalist. I got a taste of every aspect of
the newspaper, from writing, to advertising to layout."
Intern for the Sonoma Index-Tribune
"I 've dime features, covered two fatal car crashes, and interviewed local officials on a wide
range of subjects. There 's nothing like the experience of working at a community-oriented
weekly newspaper, and I love it...l've been hired as a reporter"
For more information, contact Stephanie Craft, internship Coordinator at 725-2239.
Deadline: April 13
