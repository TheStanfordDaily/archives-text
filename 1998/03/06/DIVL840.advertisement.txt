HAD TO
SAY IT.

Bugliosi
DOES.
The I'aula Jones case has sparked a
crisis in the White House. Ami it's
the direct fallout, claims Vincent
Bugliosi, of the Supreme Courts
flawed decision to allow the Jones
trial to proceed during Clintons
presidency. In NO ISLAND Of'
SANITY, the author of Outrage:
The Five Reasons Why O.J.
Simpson Got Away with Murder
puts forth a searing examination
of how the ruling came aboutâ€”
and how it is emblematic of the
general legal insanity that's sweep
ing our country.
