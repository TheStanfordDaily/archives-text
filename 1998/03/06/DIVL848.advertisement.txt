NCAA CERTIFICATION OF STANFORD ATHLETICS
Stanford University and the Stanford University Athletic Department are currently
undergoing a year-long self-study in accordance with the NCAA Athletics
Certification Program. The process is organized into four areas of concern: Equity,
Fiscal Integrity, Commitment to Rules Compliance and Academic Integrity.
It is important to the process that all interested persons have the opportunity to have
their opinions heard. Stanford students, faculty, staff and alumni have many and
varied opinions about Stanford athletics. The Steering Committee for the NCAA
Athletics Certification Program invites your responses to the following questions.
Your responses are important to us so please return no later than March 13, 1998.
You may either use a separate sheet of paper for your responses and send via I.D.
Mail to Jon Clough, NCAA Certification, MC 2061 or e-mail jcloughi@leland.
