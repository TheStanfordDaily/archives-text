"Preface to Dorian Gray"
The artist is the creator of beautiful things.
To reveal art and conceal the artist is art's aim.
The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.
The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of biography.
Those who can find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.
Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope.
They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty.
There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book.
Books are well written, or badly written. That is a 11...
The moral life of man forms part of the subject matter of the artist,
but the morality of art consist in the perfect use of an imperfect medium.
No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be proved.
No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy is an unpardonable mannerism of style.
No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything.
Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art...
Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.
Ail art is at once surface and symbol.
Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.
Those who read the symbols do so at their peril. It is the spectator and not life, that art really mirrors.
Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new ... complex, and vital.
When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not
admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.
All art is quite useless.
