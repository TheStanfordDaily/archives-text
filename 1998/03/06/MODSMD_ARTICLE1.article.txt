Tonight at S p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, the Stanford South
Asian students organization, San
skriti, will hold the fifth annual
Bhangra By the Bay dance competi
tion.
Bhangra is a traditional form of
dance originating from the Punjabi
people in northern India. It is a
dance traditionally performed by
men after the harvest season. The
different types of movement corre
spond to agricultural movements,
allowing the dancers to express
themselves in a show of strength and
agility.
Bhangra's popularity has taken
off in the past five to seven years to
become one of the more popular
forms of dance around the world.
The dance itself has evolved to in
clude women. The music for the
dance has also changed to incorpo
rate more modern beats such as hip
hop.
Partly in response to the increas
ing popularity of Bhangra, Sanskriti
organized the first Bhangra by the
Bay competition five years ago. The
goal of the event, according to Amar
Arora, a junior and a member of the
Stanford Bhangra team, was "to cre
ate an event that would unite the dif

friendly cultural competition."

Since its inauguration, "Bhangra
By the Bay has become one of the
most successful and popular social
events in the Bay Area, attracting a
wide range of people from all as
pects of the community," said Neiha
Arora, a sophomore member.
This year, a total of seven teams
from across Northern California will
participate in the Bhangra competi
tion. Those teams participating in
clude Stanford, UC-Berkeley, IJC -
avis, San Jose State and several
teams from local Bhangra dance
schools. The Stanford team consists
of 10 members â€” five men and five
women.
According to junior Hemanth
Parasuram, the competition will be
judged by a panel of five dance ex
perts representing different styles of
dance. Each team will have eight
minutes to perform their program
and will be judged on spirit, chore
ography. dance ability and overall
performance. The top three teams
will receive prizes of $S(K). $3(K) and
$200. along with trophies. In the
past. Stanford has always placed in
the top three.
This year's dance is being touted
as the "Bhangra Big Game" by
Stanford team members because

Berkeley, will also be participating
after a one-year absence from the
