BAGHDAD. Iraq (AP) A 5()-member
team of U.N. weapons inspectors returned to
Iraq yesterday, led by an American whose
presence helped touch off the (iulf crisis a
standoff they hope to verify is over.
Scott Ritter and his team arrived from
Bahrain at the Habaniva military airport out
side Baghdad and were driven to the United
Nations headquarters in a van and a bus.
Kilter's team will "carry out inspections,
including surprise inspections, to some of the
sensitive sites." the official Iraqi News Agencv
said.
Sensitive sites are ministries and security
facilities, which can be inspected only under
special procedures in effect since June 1 Wf>
Hitter's team had been prevented from
entering some suspected weapons sites in Jan
uary after Iraq alleged he was an American
spy and that his team had a disproportionate
ly high number of Americans.
Ritter left Iraq on Jan. Ih. and chief inspec
tor Richard Butler recently ordered him back,
said Allen Dacey, the inspectors' spokesman
in Baghdad.
In an unusual move, the government told
television crews and photographers they can
not go into the U N. headquarters to cover

Kilter's arrival. One ministry official said Kil
ler "is not an important event."
His return follows the U.N.-Iraq accord of
Feb. 23 under which Iraq agreed to give
inspectors full access to eight presidential
palaces that Baghdad previously declared off
limits.
Hie accord was worked out by U.N. chief
koli Annan, who appointed a retired Indian
diplomat yesterday as Ins special representa
tive to Iraq. Prakash Shah. 58. vi former Indian
ambassador to the United Nations, is part of
an effort by Annan to expand contacts with
the Iraqi leadership.
Palace inspections are not expected to start
until the United Nations and the Iraqis agree
on new rules for them. I hose rules, the subject
ol intense discussions yesterday between U.N
and Iraqi officials in New York, have not yet
been finali/cd But diplomatic sources said a
draft was delivered to Iraqi officials on
Wednesday.
Kilter's team is only one of several that arc
deployed in Iraq The other groups have
worked daily, including through the crisis over
the presidential sites
It is not known when Ritter and his team
will start their work.
