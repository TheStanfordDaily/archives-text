# Moon discovery could support lunar bases and human colonies
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Enough water is frozen in the
loose soil of the moon to support a lunar base and perhaps to
one day build a human colony there. NASA scientists said yes
terday.
"We are certain there is water there," said Alan Binder, a
lead scientist for the Lunar Prospector spacecraft, which made
the discovery. "We think we are seeing between 10 million and
1 (K) million tons of water."
Although the water is frozen and mixed with shaded soil
deep in scattered craters near the north and south lunar poles.
Hinder said that it would be easy to convert to liquid water that
could be used to make rocket propellant and breathing oxygen.
Preliminary estimates indicate that the moon holds enough
water, in widely separated deposits, to fill a lake 2 miles square
and 35 feet deep. Binder said.
The discovery of water, he said, means that it would be easi
er to establish a base where people could live for extended peri
ods and to use extraterrestrial resources — moon water con
verted to rocket fuel — to explore deeper into the solar system.
"For the first time, we may be able to go to another space
body and fuel up." said Binder.
The Lunar Prospector, a $f>s million robot craft, was
launched in January and has spent the last seven weeks orbiting
the moon and taking readings of the moon's surface with radar
and other instruments.
Water was discovered by an instrument that measures the
speed at which neutrons, a type of subatomic particle, bounce
off materials on and near the lunar surface. The neutrons come
from natural cosmic rays that constantly bathe the moon and are
slowed when they strike atoms of hydrogen, the chemical that
combines with oxvgen to make water.

Slowing of the neutrons leaves a "water signature" in the
neutron-measuring instrument.
William Feldman. an Energ\ Department scientist who ana
lyzed the neutron data, said conclusions about water are based
on a month's worth of data and shoulj be called "preluninujv"
But he said it is quite clear there are dense deposits ol h\dro
gen atoms at the lunar poles. From this, he be!f?ves "the evi
dence of water ice is quite strong."
"There are a bunch of craters filled up with water ice." said
Feldman. " This is a significant resource that will allow a modest
amount of colonization" for man\ years.
Scientists will get a better idea of how much water is on the
mixHi and where it is deposited as the Lunar Prospector contin
ues its orbital exploration. The spacecraft will collect data for at
least another year. Toward the end of its mission, it will be low
ered from its current b<)-mile orbit to about six miles, giving sci
entists a close-up of possible water deposits
But scientists won't be able to confirm that the hydrogen
atoms detected by the spacecraft are actually locked in water,
and not in some exotic ice or rock deposit, until a sample of the
material is scooped up and analyzed.
"The presence of water is a logical conclusion, but it is a leap
of faith." Binder said. "We will have to sample it before we real
ly know for sure."
Feldman said "water is the most stable form of hydrogen"
and the most likely form to be on the moon
The agency has no immediate plans to make .1 moon landing,
but Lewis Peach, a NASA executive, said the agency has long
range plans to land on both the moon and Mars Ihe agency
wants to learn how to exploit extraterrestrial resources, such as
the moon's water, to make the exploration cheaper and faster.
