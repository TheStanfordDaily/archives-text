Limiting fifth-year RA
applicants is a poor solu
tion for housing crunch

THE DECISION TO prohibit
fifth-year students from
becoming resident assistants
is a poor solution for the campus
wide housing crunch.
Currently, only 22 spaces are occu
pied by fifth-year RAs The wealth of
experience they have to offer, greatly
outweighs the few spaces they occupy
in undergraduate dorms.
Despite unanimous opposition
from the resident fellows, the new
policy requires that new as well as
returning RA applicants for under
graduate dorms have at least one
year of guaranteed undergraduate
housing left.
Although exceptions may be con
sidered for RAs in the Suites and on
the Row. the policy means that fifth
year students would not have any res
idential contact with freshmen.
Fifth-year students, completing
their undergraduate studies or work
ing on coterminal degrees, are valu
able assets to residential staffs.
Thev typically have had more
experience with Residential Educa
tion. and they add academic diversity,
maturity and historical perspective to
house staffs. Furthermore, they are
often the most knowledgeable about
integrating upperclassman issues into

dorm programming.
Res Ed should not narrow the RA
applicant pool in the interest of open
ing up a few dorm rooms.
The University has a responsibility
to hire qualified students who want
to give back to the Stanford commu
nity through Res Ed. Although fifth
years are still eligible to apply as RAs
in graduate residences, the experi
ence in graduate housing is complete
ly different.
The bottom line is that qualified
students should not be denied the
opportunity to be an RA simply
based on the number of years they've
lived in University housing.
The current system of RA selec
tion allows students to focus on aca
demic research in their senior year
and residential life during their fifth
year, and vice versa. Students
deserve that choice.
Because students did not antici
pate this policy change, current
seniors who had planned to apply for
RA positions have found their hopes
of being RAs next year abruptly
dashed.
Already, fifth-year students are
prohibited from filling Row house
staff positions as house, kitchen and
financial managers.
Making fifth-year students ineligi
ble to be RAs is a shortsighted, band
aid solution to the current housing
problem; a solution that will nega
tivelv affect residential life.
