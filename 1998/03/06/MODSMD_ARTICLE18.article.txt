# An informed Draw
## 
### 
Knowing Draw numbers
reduces the guesswork in
selecting residences

EVERY SPRING, the Draw
strikes fear into the hearts of
Stanford students. While the
Residential Programs Implementation
Group's decision to give students Draw
numbers before they make their prefer
ence lists won't take all the pain out of
the spring housing lottery, it will ease
much of the guesswork involved in the
old system.
Knowing one's Draw number is
helpful because even within the pre
ferred and unpreferred categories,
there is a range in the quality and style
of housing. ITiere's a significant gap
between a Row house and a Wilbur
dorm, and both draw preferred. Hap
less freshmen and hopeful upperclass
men often end up disappointed because
they set their sights unreasonably high.
Instead of generating an impossible
"wish list'' and sending it off to the
housing gods, students can now formu
late their lists on a more informed basis,

Allowing students to change their
lists until the May 10 deadline will also
take some fear out of the process.
Groups will have almost three weeks to
revise their decisions.
However, knowing the Draw num
ber in advance is not a panacea for all
Draw woes. The popularity of houses
changes from year to year making it dif
ficult to predict how high a house will
draw.
We hope that improvements contin
ue as the Draw process is revised. We
urge Housing and Dining Services to
continue to explore the possibility of
letting students pick their houses in
tiers of 6(H). so students with larger
numbers can see which houses are
taken before submitting their lists.
The combination of knowing both
one's Draw number and which houses
have been filled would enable students
to make truly well-informed housing
decisions.
Draw is stressful. However, the deci
sion to notify students of their Draw
numbers in advance is a positive step
towards having students make
informed housing choices.
