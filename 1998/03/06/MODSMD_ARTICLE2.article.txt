## Entrepreneurs introduce new universal address 
### Jim Tankersley Editorial staff 
Two Palo Alto entrepreneurs in
troduced a new type of Internet
"universal address" system yester
day at the Stanford Bookstore.
Alex Blok and Paul Krensky
made the Farm their first stop for
promoting "QCOMMAND."
whieh they tout as "a permanent
electronic address that is n< >' ied I< >
a specific domain or technoU ■ •>
Users of the service purchase a
"Q," a number that remains forever
unchanged, and enter whatever
contact information they wish to
display, such as phone numbers, ad
dresses, World Wide Web links and
resumes. Owners can restrict access
to any of that information by pass
word.
People who wish to contact a
OC'OMMAND user can visit the
company's home page
(http://www.qcommand.com) and
then enter the user's Q number.
The idea, Blok and Krensky said,
is that as users move, their informa
tion stays in an easy-to-aecess. single
location.
"It's very easy to say to your
grandmother, 'just punch in this
number,' " Blok said.
Blok and Krensky claim the i s i
vice is "not technology depi ndent"
and is able to adapt to new commu
nication forms as they appear. They
also pledge to keep QCOMMAND
"advertising and spam-free."
"We are a numeric system tied to
a numeric database." Blok said.
