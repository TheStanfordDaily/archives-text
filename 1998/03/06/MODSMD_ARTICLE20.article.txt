## Res Ed kills a campus tradition 
### 
Anywhere but
Alpha Sig. Any
one but Helge.
Jane Camarillo, director
of Residential Education,
and Ann Porteus, director
of Row housing, met with
over 70 Alpha Sig resi
dents and supporters on

Monday night to answer questions about
the decision to hand Alpha Sig over to a
sorority. Gathering residents' input and
fielding their questions after a decision has
already been made to take away their house
is very commendable and thoughtful.
"We had a difficult decision to make,"
said Porteus, addressing the now homeless
Alpha Sig residents. Res Ed had a difficult
decision to make, and they completely blew
it by allowing absolutely zero student voice
in the final decision.
They will tell you that students were on a
committee that recommended the criteria
to be used to select the houses for sororities.
Thank you. Res Ed, for letting us sit in
on another worthless committee that won't
have any influence on your New World
Order. We'll go back, attend our dorm pro
grams, fill out our resident surveys and
never bother you again so you can complete
whatever is on your agenda.
Meanwhile, decades of house tradition
and a cook who has served for over 18 years
have gone down the tubes. No real reasons
were given as to why Alpha Sig, the self-op
with undisputedly the most character on
campus, was chosen to be put on the chop

ping block.
Both Kappa Alpha Theta and Delta
Delta Delta asked for houses much smaller
than the 50-plus person Cowell Cluster
houses. When asked why Alpha Sig was
chosen instead of one of the other Cowell
Cluster houses, the only answer Res Ed
could give was that Alpha Sig has had a
"checkered" past. If the real reason for
putting the Thetas in a house that is too big
for them was to kick out Alpha Sig, just say
so. Res Ed.
1 wish everyone at Stanford could have
been at the meeting to see what Alpha Sig
has to offer this campus. I have never wit
nessed a truer display of students banding
together at Stanford, nor a phonier display
by Res Ed. Thetas were at the meeting
pleading to keep Alpha Sig housed. ZAP
house officers expressed disbelief that
Alpha Sig was even under consideration.
Tears flowed as reality set in that our
beloved cook Helge would no longer have a
place to work.
Camarillo and Porteus cheapened the
moment greatly by suggesting that this dis
play of emotion would have happened at
any house, and that was why this decision
was so hard. That was the biggest lie of the
entire evening. Despite giving some time
and effort to answering Alpha Sig's ques
tions, their lack of sympathy was complete
ly inconsiderate.
People who live in Alpha Sig love Alpha
Sig. They do not feel they fit in anywhere
else on campus more perfectly. Seventeen
people ran for five house offices this year.

just for the chance to receive a guaranteed
ticket back. This love is the only reason a
house as rundown as Alpha Sig could ever
draw preferred.
Do people in Whitman feel this way?
How about 557 Mayfield? Only 12 people
showed up for ATO's meeting to ask ques
tions about why they were losing their
house.
All of Alpha Sig's residents made it clear
that they supported sorority housing. Hut
why did Res Ed decide to put a sorority in a
house with such character and desire to
remain a house when there are so many
apathetic alternatives around campus? The
sororities worked incredibly hard and pre
pared mountains of paperwork to get hous
ing. not to mention waiting for 50 years.
Where was Alpha Sig's chance to prepare
paperwork and defend why it should
remain a house?
These questions will never be answered
because Res Ed is too slippery to deal with.
Their "good intentions" are ruining the
social atmosphere of this campus. Res Ed.
you've baffled me by taking away a beloved
home and giving it to a group that can't
physically fill the house.
Goodbye, Exotic Erotic (one of Rolling
Stone's top 10 college parties). Goodbye,
Helge. Thanks for the memories.

Casey Ketterling, a junior majoring in com
puter science, was to be Alpha Sig's next
social manager. Alpha Sig needs your sup
port as it tries to convince the University to
find the Thetas another house.
