Res Ed did its best
I'm a corporate tool / mouthpiece for the
bourgeoisie. I will spend the rest of my life
sending the innocent to jail, defending cor
porate America from wrongful death suits
and preventing Susan Lucci from getting a
Daytime Emmy Award. Excuse me while I
eat this kitten — raw. I am an errand boy
sent by grocery clerks. What prepared me
for all this? Residential Education. In fact, I
was a resident assistant for not one, but
TWO years in Hurbank. If it were up to me,
everyone at Stanford would be a multicul
tural. politically correct, non-Greek (the
term is so Eurocentric), meal-planned, line
crossing drone.
So Stanford has a new plan for housing.
To me, some of it is intriguing (an all-sopho
more Toyon), some of it sensible (housing
sororities) and some of it will increase class
balkanization (expanding upperclass and all
freshman housing). Director of Residential
Education Jane Camarillo and Director of
Row Housing Ann Porteus made hard deci
sions. They made no comments in order to
protect the plan until it was announced.
Then they tried to be as frank as possible
with the students afterwards. To me. these
were sensible steps. Would you rather have
them lie to you?
"Oh ... Alpha Sigma's fate was deter
mined by radiation fluctuations in the Van
Allen belt," or perhaps. "It doesn't matter

who gets the house, since the Coase Theo
rem dictates that as long as property rights
are allocated " What could Camarillo or
Porteus have said to appease you? Nothing.
Ideally, Stanford would simply continue
building housing for every type of person in
every type of situation. I believe firmly that
my former residents' proposal for a Scottish
theme dorm has merit, given Sean Con
nery's continuing strength at the box office
and the role haggis has to play in American
comedy routines. There's all that space
around the Dish — why not build enclaves of
extraterritoriality where Res Ed can't reach?
Yet, the status quo was no longer gixxl
enough.
I would like to see those complaining pro
vide feasible solutions to the myriad of prob
lems and interests Res Ed faced in making
their decision. Let's see a student plan that is
"Pareto optimal" (all parties are better off,
and no party is worse off). Maybe we could
oppress the groups that are less likely to
complain. House the sororities in the Suites.
As for Res Ed-type programming, mak
ing token efforts to promote intellectualism
or cultural awareness is not that difficult. It
didn't have to be Crossing the Line, Let's
Share Intimate Secrets or Secret City with
Commander Mark. You could have taken
Alpha Sig to see Pink Flamingoes.
Res Ed is not an octopus, with its tenta
cles trying to squeeze the life out of each stu
dent and get the wheat harvest into port. It is
an administrative organization that tries to
get people to think about the real world,

interpersonal interaction and build a sense
of community.
Sure, it makes us uncomfortable to be
with others who are not like us, and do not
study like us. party like us. etc. But a funny
thing happened in the real world while we
were being thin-skinned and self-involved —
other people were going through the same
conflicts over community, belonging and
exclusion.
Some people settle these conflicts with
war, some with genocide, some with animos
ity, some with self-segregation, some with
ridicule, some with fear, some with stereo
typing and some with acceptance. So Res Ed
wants you to open your eyes to some of that
in a manner that is sometimes intrusive. Per
haps you would like to live in a comfort zone
all your life. Good luck.
As a truncheon for the student-stomping
Kes Ed machine, I might add that if Porteus
had really wanted to silence students, you
would have been taken to the Island in a
black helicopter where you would undoubt
edly be Number Six.
