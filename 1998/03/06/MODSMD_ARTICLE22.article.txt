## Jocelyn Wiener Long live conspiracy theories and daffodils 
### 
Every winter quarter,
around the time oi Parents' Week
end, life starts to feel underwhelm
ing, academies become irrelevant, and ide
alism turns futile. Oddly enough, it is at this
time that the campus awakens in blooms ol
daffodils. Over the past few years, I have
reconciled the two phenomena by speculat
ing on their correlation with the massive
influx of parents and alumni. Even Noa»
Chomsky would be wowed by the extent ol
my conspiracy theories.
Locked in my room with overdue library
books, I occasionally feel the need to inject
tangible intrigue into my frustrated exis
tence. Sometimes I try developing a crush
on the stranger down the hall who never
speaks; he must have sparks of righteous
passion drowning in the pools of his deep,
dark eyes. Sometimes I eat ice cream.
This year, however, such measures were
rendered unnecessary. A week before Par
ents' Weekend my mother brought me a
miniature daffodil plant.
My mother loves plants, as do I. The
essential difference between the two of us is
that her love stems from a positive working
relationship. She loves plants and she suc
cessfully manages to keep them alive.
My budding relationships, on the other

hand, tend to have a sadistic twist. In the
most rccei I incident, I loved my daffodil
I water it daily, offered it advice and
sough* s counsel. I introduced it to the daf
fod outside and debriefed it on the Stan
foi daffodil conspiracy. "Don't worry," I
t jit, "I won't let you be transplanted to
npress weekend guests." I think I scared it
to death.
Succumbing to the urgent call of botani
cal parenthood. I became the 9S9th visitor
to the Web site of the I Inited States Center
for Daffodil Information I needed support
in keeping the poor thing alive.
Rather than advice, I found a cheerful
one-line statement: "Daffodils are probably
the easiest and most dependable of all flow
ers and ideal for a beginner in gardening." I
took offense at this, but kept reading out of
morbid curiosity. "Under good growing
conditions." the USCDI continued, "daf
fodil bulbs should outlast any of us." Given
the condition of my plant, that would mean
I would not survive to see Dead Week.
Frantically, 1 called home.
So on Sunday morning, not long after she
had offered me the flourishing gift, my mom
came back, trekking the four miles from our
Los Altos home to represent the Wieners at
Parents' Weekend. An hour before she

arrived, I had |ust buried the last golden
blossom. My mom did not seem to be per
turbed by my botanical debacle. I don't
think she even saw it. since my daffodil was
accidentally buried under a pile of discard
ed rough drafts and bleach-stained
sweatshirts. "Come on. let's go on a walk."
she said. "We can get ice cream."
We set out. and I perceived an eerie nor
malcy as we chatted about the uncensored

truths in our lives. "We are going to go to
Yellowstone for the weekend with Dad's
tennis buddies." she said."()h." I said, "chai
is a trendy, new hot spiced drink." "Oh."

she replied, "those are beautilul daffodils."
I halted: this was no longer a G-rated con
versation. I would have to tell her.
I looked calmly to where she was point
ing. "Those daffodils have only been there
for a week." I informed her. trying to dis
guise the derision in my voice. She looked at
me.
"1 hey timed the planting that well?" She
sounded surprised.
"No. mom," I explained with patient
irreverence. "They just put them there for
Parents' Weekend. They do it every year,
hut no one ever complains about it."
"Really?" she said dubiously. "You
mean they just transplant them right before
we arrive?" 1 shrugged my shoulders sadly.
My mother looked at me again. "Well,
that's pissy." she summarized. Indeed. And
so. after all these years. I finally resolved to
inform the Stanford campus of my conspir
acy theory. I would make a brilliant
metaphor between the use of daffodils in
fooling parents and alumni and the depic
tion of the freshman advising system as
functional. 1 would casually point out that
the Latin name for daffodil — narcissus -
is also a tragic character who falls in love
with himself. It would be a quiet call to
arms.

First, however. I decided to cover my
bases. I called University Events and Ser
vices. assuming that the daffodil people
would be allied with whomever had
planned Parents' Weekend
"Uh. don't you want to talk to Facili
ties?" they asked I called Facilities.
"Hi I paused dramatically. "I have a
few questions about daffodils.'" Ihe man
who answered acted like my quer\ was nor
mal.
"Well." I said, "when did \ou plant the
daffodils?" I waited, knowing lull well the
stumbling, defensive response he would be
forced to offer
"Ten years ago.' he said. "Isn't it beauti
ful at this time of year when they bloom?
I was taken aback My conspiracy theory
had been uprooted. My visions of an expose
were withering away. I looked to my daf
fodil for advice. It vsas struggling for breath
Outside, its 10-year-old brothers were nour
ishing in El Nino-less sunshine. I went to the
kitchen, brought up a bowl of ice cream and
tried to tell the story anyhow
