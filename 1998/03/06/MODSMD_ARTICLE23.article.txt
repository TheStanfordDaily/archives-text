Res Ed must rethink
Alpha Sig decision
As Stanford alumni and former Alpha
Sigma residents, we are writing to
express our dismay over the recent deci
sion made by the Office of Residential
Education to turn the house over to the
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. Although
we understand the University's decision
to house a sorority on campus, the
administration failed to consider student
and alumni input in the decision-making
process.
Together, we represent at least four
generations of Alpha Sig residents and
believe that the result of this decision
will be the destruction of an important
part of our Stanford experience. Alpha
Sig is a unique community that fills a
vital niche at Stanford. We know that
there are many close-knit residences at
Stanford, but rarely will you find a house
like Alpha Sig in which the sense of com
munity spans over generations of resi
dents.
Generations of Siggers return each
year to welcome new residents into the

Alpha Sig community, thanks to the
house's trad ions and to Helgc Tornsten,
Alpha Sig's veteran cook.
Director of Residential Education Jane
Camarillo and Director of Row Housing
Ann Porteus claim that Alpha Sig's fail
ure to abide by the tenets of Res Ed was
one of the reasons the house was chosen.
Yet. we cannot think of a better example
of a strung, close community than Alpha
Sig.
This community has flourished with
limited involvement from Res Ed. Its
roots lie in the shared experiences and
traditions. The role of Res Ed has been
minimized at Alpha Sig. and we have
thrived.
The University should be committed to
providing its students with a diverse set
of living environments. Eliminating any
and all -houHus that do not meet Res Ed's
ideals counters this commitment.
The University should not impose on
students its institutionalized values and
ideals about how informal education in
residences should occur.
Instead, the University should foster
an environment in which students strive
to learn and mature.
We further object to the fact that

Camarillo made the decision alone.
based on Porteus' recommendations.
Input from residents of the houses under
consideration and from members of the
selected sororities was neither solicited
nor considered.
As a result, residents and alumni of
Alpha Sig first received notice that the
house was under consideration for con
version after the final decision had
already been made.
Converting Alpha Sig into a sorority
house is a lose-lose situation. Five years
ago. the Beta Theta Pi fraternity was
rehoused, and two years later, they lost
their house again when they failed to
recruit enough members to fill it. Given
that the maximum si/e of a sorority
chapter is 70 .members, it is probable that
the Thetas will have trouble filling a 50-
person house. The Thetas are aware oli
this, and that is why they asked for a
smaller house.
The administration has placed them in
quite a bind. If they accept the offer of
Alpha Sig. they must maintain a large
number of housed members or risk los
ing the house. If they reject the offer on
the grounds that they may not be able to
fill it in the future, it will probably be

several years before they are again
offered housing. It has been 50 years
since sororities last had on-campus hous
ing. and there are other fraternities and
sororities still awaiting approval to movt
back. If the Thetas reject the current
offer, they will probably find themselves
at the bottom of this list. The only win
ner then, it seems, is the Office of Resi
dential Education.
The "checkered past" to which C'amai
illo and Porteus alluded dates back to
when many of us were residents of the
house. We believe that many of the prol
lems that Res Ed became involved in
stemmed from the incompatibility of
individuals who happened to end up in
the house and not from the inherent
nature of the house or the community.
Current and future members of the
Alpha Sig community should not be helc
liable or accountable for past actions of
those individuals.
Res Ed further condemns the lack of
communication between the Alpha Sig
residential staff and their office.
Since the resident assistants are select
ed. trained and appointed by Res Ed. wc
think that it is ludicrous for these admin
istrators to blame this breakdown of

communication solel) on their
appointees.
Is it then the Alpha Sig community and
its "Exotic Erotic" that the administra
tion is attempting to get rid of'.' We feel
that this must he so. because Res I d has
failed to provide us with ;i satisfactory
explanation otherwise.
As alumni ol this I niversitx, we
deeply regret that the administration that
should he working Willi the students, it
not FOR the students, would take it
upon itself to decide what is best for stu
dents without asking what the\ want
At the very least, we are asking that
decisions that affect students' lives so
directly he made with their input We
cannot, with a clear conscience, support
an administration that allows two admin
istrators to make such a devastating deci
sion without an\ student input \S c must
not condone such blatant disrespect for
student opinion.
We hope that the administration will
take steps to reconsider its decision and
to solicit student input actively for a just
decision-making process.
