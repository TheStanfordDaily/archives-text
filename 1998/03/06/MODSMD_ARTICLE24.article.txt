EUGENE, Ore. — With con
ference tournaments filling the
television airways across the na
tion this week, last night's contest
between Oregon (16-9, 12-5 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) and the fifth
ranked Stanford women's basket
ball team (20-5,16-1) had all the in
gredients of a tournament game.

(1220 AM)

There were crazy calls from the
refs, a never-say-die attitude from
the underdog Ducks, a game that
went down to the wire, and a final
minute that was more like a
Wrestlemania contest that spilled
over into the third row of the face
painted fans than a basketball
game.
Stanford was able to pull out the
exhausting 79-71 win. a victory that
clinched the Cardinal's ninth Pac
-10 title in 10 years.
Even before the game started
(and the tip was delayed for sever
al minutes by a malfunctioning
scoreboard) the 6.44K fans on hand
at McArthur Court — the third
largest crowd to ever see a
women's basketball game at Ore

gun — gave the game what Oregon
junior forward Natasha O'Brien
called a "magical atmosphere."
Two minutes into the game the
Duck fans were even louder. Se
nior forward Olympia Scott picked
up her second foul with 18 minutes,
15 seconds to go and had to take a
seat for the rest of the half with the
game tied 2-2.
But after a back-and-forth
game over the first six minutes,
Stanford went on a tear, scoring 15
unanswered points to take a 16-
point lead 23-7 on some near-per
fect shooting. At one point in the
half, the Cardinal's 9-of-12 perfor
mance was good for 75 percent
from the field compared to Ore
gon's 18.8 percent.
Sophomore guard Christina
Batastini was a spark in the run,
contributing a three-pointer just a
minute after she checked in and
added a driving layin with the foul
a few possessions later. Batastini
got all of her seven first-half points
in the run as the Cardinal pulled
ahead.
"We got a nice lead in the be
ginning. but we weren't able to
hang onto it." said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer.
"It was a very physical game and
I thought our young guards dis
played a lot of poise with the big
crowd."
Stanford had seemingly si
lenced the crowd and cruised out
to a commanding lead.
But that's when the Ducks an
swered with a 15-2 run, fueled
mostly by the Oregon defense,
which was swarming into the pass
ing lanes the entire game, forcing
26 turnovers and recording 14
steals in the game.
"We wanted our guards to pres
sure their passes from the wings,
and force their high posts to catch
the hall far away from the basket,"
said Oregon head coach Jody

Runge.
"We did a great job defensively,
but we were very stale on offense.
But I was very pleased with our
post defense."
The only person keeping things
going for the Card was senior cen
ter Heather Owen. Owen stepped
up in Scott's absence and posted 10
points while grabbing six boards in
the first half.
Scott only played two minutes in
the first half, and her replacement,
senior forward Kristin Folkl, had
an uncharacteristically poor shoot

ing performance in the half (3-of -
7) for six points.
In fact, the entire team went
cold after its scorching start, and
Stanford only made four of its last
15 shots in the half.
"I got into a good flow and just
tried to watch the fouls," Owen
said. " The way Olympia got hers. I
think I got away with a few. Hut it's
tough, she's a very integral part of
our team.
"It was very physical (inside].
I hey were helping from the weak
side post. I think the calls were in
consistent. You'd get killed, and
they wouldn't call it. Then there'd
he touch fouls. It was hard to tell
what was going to happen."
Stanford began the second half
with an K-0 run that again extended
the lead to double figures 41 -28.
But the Ducks just wouldn't go
away.
Oregon scored nine unan
swered points just before Scott
landed her fourth foul on a crazy
call.
Scott pulled the defensive re
bound and was quickly greeted by
junior forward Sonja Curtis.
Curtis somehow managed to
take the ball away from Scott and
draw the shooting foul in about
half a second, and two successful
free throws cut the lead to two.

But the Cardinal was able to get
the lead back to double figures,
mostly on the shooting of senior
forward Vanessa Nvgaard.
Stanford was able to bring Nv
gaard to the top of the key in the
halfcourt offense and even found
her spotting up behind the arc on
the break as a 17-point perfor
mance in the half was the nail in the
coffin for the Ducks.
Nvgaard finished with a team
high 21 points, while O'Brien led
all scorers with 23. Stanford was
impressive once again from the
field, finishing the game with a 54.9
percent clip.
Oregon was able to cut the score
to seven in the final minute, mostly
because the Card was unwisely
hacking the Ducks on their shots,
but Stanford would hang on for the
win.
Surprisingly, five of the eight
personal fouls over the last 1:30 be
longed to Stanford rather than
Oregon.
