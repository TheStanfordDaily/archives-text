EUGENE, Ore. — With con

There were crazy calls from the
refs, a never-say-die attitude from
the underdog Ducks, a game that
went down to the wire, and a final
minute that was more like a
Wrestlemania contest that spilled
over into the third row of the face
painted fans than a basketball
game.
Stanford was able to pull out the
exhausting 79-71 win. a victory that
clinched the Cardinal's ninth Pac
-10 title in 10 years.
Even before the game started
(and the tip was delayed for sever

scoreboard) the 6.44K fans on hand
at McArthur Court — the third
largest crowd to ever see a

gon's 18.8 percent.
Sophomore guard Christina
Batastini was a spark in the run,
contributing a three-pointer just a
minute after she checked in and
added a driving layin with the foul
a few possessions later. Batastini
got all of her seven first-half points
in the run as the Cardinal pulled
ahead.
"We got a nice lead in the be
ginning. but we weren't able to
hang onto it." said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer.
"It was a very physical game and
I thought our young guards dis
played a lot of poise with the big
crowd."
Stanford had seemingly si
lenced the crowd and cruised out
to a commanding lead.
But that's when the Ducks an
