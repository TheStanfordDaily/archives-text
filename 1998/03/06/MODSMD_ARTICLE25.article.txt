Although the Wildcats are cur
rently ranked No. 8 in the nation,
the similarities between the Cardi
nal (17-1-1, 5-1 Pacific-10 Confer

ence Southern Division) and the
Wildcats (22-2,4-2) are striking.
Like the Cardinal, Arizona has
come out of the gates batting at an
almost unprecedented pace
through the first six weeks of play.
The Wildcats' 296 runs (12.33 per
game) is the most an Arizona team
has scored through 24 games since
19.57.
In addition, Arizona has already
surpassed last season's home run
total of 42. The Wildcats posted
double-figure hit totals in each of
their first 10 games and scored
eight or more runs in each of their
first 15 contests.
Similarly, the Cardinal is quick
ly rewriting Stanford's offensive
record book as it bombards its op
ponents at the plate. The squad has
racked up 195 runs (10.8 per game)
on 221 hits in its first 18contests, in
cluding its 54-run, 52-hit perfor
mance at UCLA on Feb. 20-22.
