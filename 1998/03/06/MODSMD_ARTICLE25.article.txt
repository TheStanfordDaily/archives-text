### Allison Otto Staff writer 
If the weather doesn't fall victim
to the whims of El Nino. No. 1
Stanford could be in for some seri
ous competition this weekend in
the form of Arizona.

BASEBALL
■ Tonight: No. 1 Stanford (16-1-1,5-
1 Pacific 10 Conference) vs. No. 8
Arizona (22-2, 4-2) at Sunken Dia
mond, 7 p.m. RADIO: KZSU (90.1
FM).
■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford vs. No. 8
Arizona at Sunken Diamond, 1 p.m.
RADIO: KZSU (90.1 FM).
■ Sunday: No. 1 Stanford vs. No. 8
Arizona at Sunken Diamond, 1 p.m.
RADIO: KZSU (90.1 FM).

Although the Wildcats are cur
rently ranked No. 8 in the nation,
the similarities between the Cardi
nal (17-1-1, 5-1 Pacific-10 Confer

ence Southern Division) and the
Wildcats (22-2,4-2) are striking.
Like the Cardinal, Arizona has
come out of the gates batting at an
almost unprecedented pace
through the first six weeks of play.
The Wildcats' 296 runs (12.33 per
game) is the most an Arizona team
has scored through 24 games since
19.57.
In addition, Arizona has already
surpassed last season's home run
total of 42. The Wildcats posted
double-figure hit totals in each of
their first 10 games and scored
eight or more runs in each of their
first 15 contests.
Similarly, the Cardinal is quick
ly rewriting Stanford's offensive
record book as it bombards its op
ponents at the plate. The squad has
racked up 195 runs (10.8 per game)
on 221 hits in its first 18contests, in
cluding its 54-run, 52-hit perfor
mance at UCLA on Feb. 20-22.
In addition, all nine of Stan
ford's starters are hitting over .300.
Freshman outfielder Joe Borchard.
who only took to the baseball field
a scant two weeks before the home
opener after concluding the foot
ball season, leads the way with an
impressive .407.
These numbers are not lost on
Arizona associate head coach Bill
Kinneberg.
" This is a heck of a challenge to
play the No. 1 team in the country,"
Kinneberg said. "We've played
well at times, average at times and
poorly at times ... As the old say
ing goes, you're only as good as
your last game, so we're focusing
on the Cardinal."
And that focus will likely be tar
geted on the Cardinal's unyielding
starting pitching armory.
Cardinal Friday starter Jeff
Austin has been dominant in his

two Six-Pac appearances. The ju
nior righthander allowed just three
hits and an unearned run over eight
innings in the Cardinal's 15-2 win at
Arizona State last Friday to im
prove to 2-0 with an 0.56 ERA in
conference play.
Tomorrow, Cardinal two-sport
star Chad Hutchinson takes to the
mound. The junior righthander im
proved to 4-0 against the Sun Dev
ils last Saturday.
After struggling last Sunday
against the Sun Devils, junior lefty
Bent Hoard is a questionable
starter on Sunday.
"Pitching-wise, I don't think
there's anybody in the country as
good as Austin and Hutchinson."
Kinneberg said.
Cardinal junior second baseman
Tony Schrager agreed.
"First of all, [Kinnenberg is]
probably right," Schrager said. "I
mean, our starting pitching has
been great all year, as well as the
bullpen. I think offensively we've
been swinging the bat really well,

but you never know with their
pitching. Hopefully we'll put some
runs up."
Like the Cardinal, the Wildcats
retain a trio of starting pitchers
from last year: juniors Darrell
Hussman. James Johnson and Rob
Shabansky.
Shabansky, however, will be
sidelined Saturday due to a sore left
elbow. He will be replaced by
sophomore lefty Tony Milo, usual
ly a midweek starter and long re
liever.
"We know it's going to be a real
tough, hard-fought game, probably
a great pitching series," Schrager
said. "Offensively, they're obvious
ly explosive, and I think we've
shown that we can swing the bats as
well, so I think there's definitely a
potential for some offensive games.
But obviously we both have three
starting pitchers returning from last
year, so 1 think there are a lot of
similarities on our teams. I think it's
just two real evenly matched
teams."
