The No. 11 (Cardinal (25-4.14-3
Pacific 10 Conference) shot the
lights out en route to a 95-68
blowout of the Ducks in Maples
Pavilion, bringing the team one
game closer to its inevitable trip
into the NCAA Tournament.
"This was a game that con
cerned me because I think ()regon
is playing very well lately." Mont
gomery said. "Having the ball go
down restores a little confidence. I
think this helps. Oregon is a good
team playing well toward the end
of the year. It has to help."
Stanford's tight defense led to a
fast-paced offense and a season
high 68-percent shooting perfor

mance from the field. Sophomore
guard David Moseley led the wav
with a game-high 19 points on 5
of 112) shooting, including a perfect
3-for-3 delivery from downtown.

in the half. Cardinal point guard
Arthur Lee took over.
Lee had his own seven-point
run with a three, an ]X-foot
jumper and a driving lav up to give
his team a seven-point lead. Ihe
Cardinal then made eight of then
next 10 shots, including a nine
point contribution from Moselev.
to take a 48-31 lead into the lock
er room.
Ihe win 'just shows that we
have a lot of character and that
we're not going to let the shellack
ing that Arizona gave us get us
down." Moseley said. "We
learned that we're capable of
doing that to anyone.
"It gives us a lot of confidence,
?nd it gives the (tournament] se
lection committee a lot of confi
dence that we're worthy of being
up there with the top teams in the
country."
Stanford shot 74 percent from
the floor in the first half, another
season record. I he team also hit 4-
of-5 from downtown, keeping the
Ducks at a safe distance despite
Oregon's 48-percent shooting in
the period.

Slam! Sophomore Mark Madsen goes up for a dunk last night at
Maples. The Card crushed the Oregon Ducks while stepping up its
play in time for March Madness.
stepped in and kept the rally going
with their most solid play of the
season.
Reserve swingman Ryan
Mendez finished with 13 points
while hitting all live of his shots and
pulling down four rebounds.
Freshman point guard Mike
McDonald played 11 minutes in re
lief of Lee and dished out four as
sists while picking off two steals.
Guard Terik Brown led the
Ducks with points and five as
sists. Jamar Curry also contributed
14 points, but the Ducks lacked the
inside game to make up for the
Cardinal's accuracy.
Oregon head coach Ernie Kent
tried to exploit forward A.D.
Smith's speed advantage over
sophomore Mark Madsen. but did
so with only limited success. Smith
finished with 15 points, but hit only
6-of-14.
"We knew coming in that we
were going to have to play an A
plus game." Kent said. "It's a cred
it to them to come and bounce back
after the loss to Arizona. We obvi
ously don't have the weapons they
have.
"They're just such a dominant
team when they get on a roll like
that. I don't think we did a good job
of playing smart."

The Ducks will travel to Cal and
try to break even in conference
play, hoping that they can get an in
vitation to the National Invitation
Tournament in the process.
The victory helped erase the lin
gering memories of the Cardinal's
dispiriting 32-point loss to Arizona
last Saturday, and boosted the con
fidence level of a team headed into
tournament play next week.
"This is good for the team, espe
cially after that horrible loss last
week," said Lee, who finished with
16 points, five rebounds and four
assists. "It's good for morale.
Everybody contributed; it was a
good team defensive effort."
The only thing left for the Car
dinal before the Big Dance is a
matchup with last-place Oregon
State tomorrow night in Maples.
Seniors Kamba Tshionyi, a re
serve point guard, and power for
ward Pete Van Elswyk will be hon
ored in a ceremony before the
game.
Tshionyi has seen limited min
utes because of Lee's extensive
play and Montgomery's tendency
to give the extra time to McDon
ald. the team's primary backup.
Van Elswyk stepped up big for
the team this season, entering the
starting lineup while Madsen was
out with a stress fracturc in his right
foot. In his 10 starts. Van Elswyk
averaged 6.1 points and 5.2 re
bounds in 19.2 minutes.
