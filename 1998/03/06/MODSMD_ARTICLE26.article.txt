lights out en route to a 95-68
blowout of the Ducks in Maples
Pavilion, bringing the team one
game closer to its inevitable trip
into the NCAA Tournament.
"This was a game that con
cerned me because I think ()regon
is playing very well lately." Mont
gomery said. "Having the ball go
down restores a little confidence. I
think this helps. Oregon is a good
team playing well toward the end
of the year. It has to help."
Stanford's tight defense led to a
fast-paced offense and a season
high 68-percent shooting perfor

mance from the field. Sophomore
guard David Moseley led the wav

his team a seven-point lead. Ihe
Cardinal then made eight of then
next 10 shots, including a nine
point contribution from Moselev.
to take a 48-31 lead into the lock

Ihe win 'just shows that we
have a lot of character and that
we're not going to let the shellack
ing that Arizona gave us get us
down." Moseley said. "We
learned that we're capable of
doing that to anyone.
"It gives us a lot of confidence,
?nd it gives the (tournament] se
lection committee a lot of confi
dence that we're worthy of being
up there with the top teams in the
country."
Stanford shot 74 percent from
the floor in the first half, another
season record. I he team also hit 4-

Ducks at a safe distance despite
Oregon's 48-percent shooting in
