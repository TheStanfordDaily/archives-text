# Catching the game with Gerhard

Last night I learned a lesson or
two in sportsmanship.
Actually, it was a lesson I knew
I had coming ever since I opened
my mouth on Feb. 23.
University President (ierhard
Casper had come to speak at The
Daily for an off-the-record convet
sation. and I worked up the nerve
to ask him about what he saw for
the future of the Sixth Man Club.
Then, without really knowing it.
I asked: "And if I give you a I shirt
and a ticket to an upcoming bas
ketball game, will you sit in with
the Sixth Man Club?"
I'm not going to say what his re
sponse was (it was off the record),
but let's just say that I had one of
the more memorable evenings in
my almost four years here hanging
with Casper last night as the men's
basketball team defeated C )regon
95-67.
This time though. I pretty much
kept my mouth closed and didn't

L|iii/ him on the club or the housing
changes or University gossip or
anything.
But even without talking about
the benefits and shortcomings of
the Sixth Man Club, I learned
about that sportsmanship thing
that's been talked about since the
football game against Notre
Dame.
Whenever Stanford scored,
everyone was high-fiving like we
had all grown up together. Ihe
cheering didn't stop. When Alex
Cielbard scored his first basket of
the season late in the second half,
long after the game was in the re
frigerator, no one was cheering
louder than Casper.
Then there was the moment
when some guy sitting behind us
let out a string of not-really-print
able words directed at some ()re
gon player. 1 didn't catch the whole
thing, but Casper did He turned
back, smiled and rolled his eyes.
I tried to put myself in Casper's
