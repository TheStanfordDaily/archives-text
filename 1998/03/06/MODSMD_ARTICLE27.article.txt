# Catching the game with Gerhard
## 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Last night I learned a lesson or
two in sportsmanship.
Actually, it was a lesson I knew
I had coming ever since I opened
my mouth on Feb. 23.
University President (ierhard
Casper had come to speak at The
Daily for an off-the-record convet
sation. and I worked up the nerve
to ask him about what he saw for
the future of the Sixth Man Club.
Then, without really knowing it.
I asked: "And if I give you a I shirt
and a ticket to an upcoming bas
ketball game, will you sit in with
the Sixth Man Club?"
I'm not going to say what his re
sponse was (it was off the record),
but let's just say that I had one of
the more memorable evenings in
my almost four years here hanging
with Casper last night as the men's
basketball team defeated C )regon
95-67.
This time though. I pretty much
kept my mouth closed and didn't

L|iii/ him on the club or the housing
changes or University gossip or
anything.
But even without talking about
the benefits and shortcomings of
the Sixth Man Club, I learned
about that sportsmanship thing
that's been talked about since the
football game against Notre
Dame.
Whenever Stanford scored,
everyone was high-fiving like we
had all grown up together. Ihe
cheering didn't stop. When Alex
Cielbard scored his first basket of
the season late in the second half,
long after the game was in the re
frigerator, no one was cheering
louder than Casper.
Then there was the moment
when some guy sitting behind us
let out a string of not-really-print
able words directed at some ()re
gon player. 1 didn't catch the whole
thing, but Casper did He turned
back, smiled and rolled his eyes.
I tried to put myself in Casper's

shoes. Had I been president and got
ten this offer given the vicissitudes
of the Sixth Man Club's year, I cer
tainly would not have come.
T hat's one of an infinite number
of reasons why I'm not the presi
dent.
Whenever the never-been-tried
before opportunity comes about to
show his support to the students and
set an example for the words he
preaches with his own actions,
Casper seizes it. And everyone is
better off from it.
Game highlight: It was midway
through the first half, and Stanford's
lead was then slim. Sophomore
Mark Madsen was at the free-throw
line. Casper noticed that all four of
our respective hands were out
stretched with our fingers moving
back and forth in a that-thing-that
we-do-when-St an ford -players

shoot-free-throws manner.
"Why do we do this?" he asked.
I was speechless.
While there may be no logical
reason, this was one of the many
Sixth Man Club traditions that
Casper learned last night. By the
end of the game, he was leading the
" Let's-Go-Stanford!" cheers.
Neither the "You-You-You-
You-You" cheer, directed at Ore
gon players who had just commit
ted fouls, nor the "high school ref"
one ever caught on for obvious rea
sons.
Casper received a warm recep
tion from the club, which instantly
realized that his name met the re
quired four syllables necessary for a
Sixth Man cheer. Even the Stanford
players on the bench took notice.
Regardless of what anyone
thinks about the Sixth Man Club —
past, present and future — everyone
was better off after last night's game.
I learned a lesson in graciousness
which I hope I'll never forget.
