"Both Amy and Keri have really
added maturity to the squad in their ac
tions and words.' said head coach Mark
Cook. "They are both great athletes and
an inspiration to their teammates."
Tonight. Monahan will perform on
the vault, beam and floor, foregoing
competion on bars after tearing a carti
lage in her shoulder. Monahan. although
frustrated she can't compete in the all
around, has used the opportunity to
focus on her other events and will per
form her full-out tumbling pass on floor

for the first time tonight.
Monahan has had quite a career at
Stanford but refuses to say farewell at
this point in the season.
"I'm not sa\ ing my goodbyes yet." she
said. "We still have two more meets and
then the postseason, and I'm hoping to
be All American."
Winning tonight will be a step in the
right direction

All-Americans, including All-American
junior Angie Leonard and three time
All-American senior Traci Sommcr. who

Junior Katie Fltepatrick competes on the bara In last month'a victory againat Cal. This
weekend, she will compete on both the bara and the beam for the firat time thla season
it feels to win.
Rest assured, the Card is going
to do everything in their power to
stop them.
Head coach Mark Cook has put
together his toughest lineup and
said he is looking for the team to
step it up and pick up the intensity,
especially after a hard week of
training.
"The season is not over and we
are still focused 011 Pac-lOs and re
gional," Cook said. "Each meet is
a dress rehearsal for the bigger
meets."
The team will have to do with
out freshman standout Jennifer
Exaltacion. Exaltacion, Canada's
defending beam champion,
grabbed second place last week on
the beam with a career-high score
9.525 and has consistently rocked
her bar routine. She won't com
pete tonight after nursing a sore
neck she suffered in practice.

Junior Amy Murakami and
sophomore Larissa Fontaine will
perform in the all-around, and
freshman Jenny Wilson will come
back into the floor lineup. Wilson
has added difficulty on her floor
routine, which she will perform for
the first time tonight.
Junior Katie Fitzpatrick has
looked strong in practice all week
and will compete on the bars and
beam for the first time all season
after being out for most of it recov
ering from ankle surgery.
Sophomores Sarah Harding
and Tracey Kohl are expected to
also pick it up on floor. Two weeks
ago against California, Harding
posted two career highs for both
bars and floor. A repeat effort
would help bolster the Card's team
score, which is going to have to be
around 195 if they're going to upset
Utah.
"It's going to be a tough meet,"
Cook said. "I'm hoping that Utah
brings out the best in us and serves
as a catalyst for us to step it up and
do what we're capable of doing."
