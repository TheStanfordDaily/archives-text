WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ Today: No. 3 Stanford vs. No. 2
Cal at deGuerre pool, 4 p.m.
■ Sunday: No. 5 Stanford vs. Pacific
at deGuerre pool, noon.

After No. 2 Cal's win over top
ranked UCLA at the Santa Barbara
tournament last weekend, the top
position in the league will be heavily
contested. Stanford, currently
ranked third in the nation, has a
good chance of jumping ahead if the
team can defeat the Bears today.
Stanford faced Cal twice during
the preseason and lost by a single
goal each time. In Santa Barbara,
Stanford was able to execute a
strong defense against Cal's tradi
tional offense which generally cen
ters around it's powerful 2-meter
man, Alisa von Hartitzsch. But the
Card was unable to stop Cal's out
side shooters from capitalizing on
their opportunities.
"Cal is strong," said junior Lind
sav Welsh. "They have lots of dif

ferent offensive weapons. We're
going to focus on looking at films
and seeing how to fine-tune the de
fense."
The main problem for the Cardi
nal in its games against Cal has been
its attack.
"We didn't have enough move
ment." said sophomore Elissa Kes
zler.
Stanford assistant coach Susan
Ortwein, in describing the practice
strategy for the week leading up to
today's game, said. "We're going to
be working on communicating and
moving a lot more. We need drive
through the hole more to open up
more opportunities."
The Card can expect strong of
fensive play from 6-foot sophomore
hole-set Ellen Estes. who racked up
15 goals last weekend in Santa Bar
bara. The defense will be led by ju
nior goalie Heather Crarv, who has
been coming up with big saves for
the team since the beginning of the
preseason.
"I'm exeited about Friday's
game," Keszler said. "The fact that
it's a home game gives us the advan
tage."
Stanford also faces Pacific this
Sunday at noon. Head coach John
Tanner was the head of the water
polo program at UOP before com
ing to Stanford to head up the
women's team this year. Ortwein
also came to Stanford from UOP
this vear.
