Stanford students care about
their sports. Hut they love, admire
and lust after their dancing Tree.
Wednesday night, sophomore
Chris Matthew Henderson 111 was
christened as Stanford's newest
green god.
During this past week, known as
"Tree Week," various candidates
performed, according to Hender
son. "random, crazy" stunts in order
to he chosen as next year's Tree.
Henderson's antics left this year's
Tree, sophomore Matt Merrill and
former Tree Chris Bonzon, a senior,
in awe. In order to prove his bravery
and prepare for Big Game. Hender
son greased up and wrestled a pig in
White Plaza. It was a close battle, but
with three seconds remaining, Hen
derson was declared the winner.
Proving his intellectual side, Hen
derson took a survey outside of the
Human Biology class. Human Sexu
ality, about what people considered
to be pornography. Apparently,
pornography is a Tree tradition. Ac
cording to Merrill. "Porno courses
through the Trees' veins."
Finally, Henderson arrived to his
Tree interview carried on a chair,
making a vinegar volcano in the
process.
'it was like the Aeneid." Bonzon
said.
()ther I lenderson stunts included
painting himself green and posing
next to "The Thinker," hanging a
120-foot sign from Hoover Tower
and selling "( hr is for Tree" T-shirts
to fellow Kimball Hall residents. "I
couldn't imagine a better way to
spend my time." he said. "I go nuts as
often as I get a chance."

The Stanford Band arrived at
Henderson's room Wednesday
night to inform him of the good
news. It was "unreal," Henderson
said. Unfortunately, in the ensuing
party, Henderson worries that he
might have "burned someone with
my cigar,"
Henderson expects that his home
town of Fort Wayne, Ind. — famous
for having the first night baseball
game — will be in awe. Henderson
said that becoming Tree will be bin

news in Fort Wayne.
Of course, the sex appeal that
goes along with being Free is anoth
er reason to want the job.
"What could be more sex\ than ;i
giant green phallic symbol . that
talks?" Merrill asked.
In response to the recent violence
that has followed the Free at such
events as Big Game, Henderson re
marked. "When people try to kick
my ass, I'm gonna kick theirs.''
Merrill said he feels "nsvehed to

watch someone else" take over his
job. "All the candidates are always
good. Just to make it through the
week, you have to be a little out ol
your gourd."
Right now Merrill has mostly
"faded memories" ol his time as
Tree. "(Either the memories were]
so traumatic that 1 blocked them out.
or 11 *;is| so drunk I can't remember
them." he said.
