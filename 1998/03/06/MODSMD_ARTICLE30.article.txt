WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Today: No. 5 Stanford vs. No. 23 Arizona at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium, 1:30 p.m.
■ Tomorrow: No. 5 Stanford vs. No. 8 Arizona
State at Taube Family Tennis Stadium, noon.

The defending champion Cardinal (13-0 over
all. 1-0 Pacific 10 Conference South Division) is
coming off a thrilling 5-4 road victory in its Pac-10
opener last weekend against No. 7 California.
Meanwhile, the Sun Devils and the Wildcats are
coming to town after a thriller of their own in the
desert, a 5-4 upset victory over ASU at the end of
February.
"I think Cal is a bit better than Arizona and
ASU, but not much," Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan said. "The women's Pac-10 is always bru
tal. Nobody in the conference is bad."
The Wildcats, who have been ranked in the top
five for the last few years, are down a bit this sea
son. Arizona has lacked the depth that for the last
couple of seasons made them arguably the second
strongest team in the conference behind Stanford.
The Wildcats are led by former Pac-10 Player of
the Year Vicky Maes. Consistently ranked in the
top 10 in singles for the past two seasons, Maes is
down at No. 44 currently due to a slow start thus far.

Maes "is very good," Brennan said. "She is a
very dangerous player and has been for years."
Behind Maes in the No. 2 singles spot is senior
Betsy Miringhoff, who at No. 58 is putting together
a strong season for Arizona. But near the bottom
of the lineup, the Wildcats' inexperience becomes
evident. Arizona starts three freshman in the last
three singles spots.
The Wildcats do not have a doubles team
ranked in the top 50.
"Arizona has been a top five team the last cou
ple of seasons," Brennan said. "But they just have
not had that kind of year so far. They will be about
as good as ASU though."

The Sun Devils lofty ranking is a result of an
upset over then-No. 2 UCLA in an early Pac-10
dual match. Senior Reka Cseresnyes, an annual
All-Pac-10 team selection, leads the way for ASI)
in singles. Ranked No. 38 in the nation, Cseresnyes
has traditionally played tough against Stanford in
the top singles position, where she will face Cardi
nal sophomore Anne Kremer.
Other ranked singles players for the Sun
Devils include No. 70 Karin Palme and No. 82
Celena McCoury, both of whom are freshmen.
In doubles, ASI) boasts the No. 12 doubles team

" They are pretty solid." Bren
nan said. "Both matches will be a
nice test for us. a nice step forward
and a nice way to finish up this
quarter. We are playing pretty well
right now. We have proven our
mettle. And this team picks each

other up when someone isn't play
ing well, and that is the sign of a
good team."
