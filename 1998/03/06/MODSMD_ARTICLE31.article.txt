[| Following two relatively disappointing weekends, the
Stanford men's volleyball team looks to get back on track
by winning two conference matches this weekend.
The seventh-ranked Cardinal (8-3, 7-3 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) travels to San Diego this week
end for two matches. Tonight's match will be against UC-

San Diego(l-11,0-10 MPSF), while the Cardinal will face
San Diego State (2-9. 2-8 MPSF) tomorrow afternoon.
Stanford victories over both schools back in January gave
the Cardinal its first two MPSF victories of this season.

MEN S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 8 Stanford (8-3. 7-3 MPSF) at UC-San
Diego (1-11,0-10), 7 p.m.
■ Tomorrow: No. 8 Stanford at San Diego State (2-9,2-8),
3 p.m.

Although the Cardinal's last two weekends have been
discouraging on the scoreboard, the team has not played
poorly. Stanford has at least one player in each of six na
tional statistics categories. Senior middle blockers
Keenan Whitehurst and Tad Hoffman are third and fifth,
respectively, in hitting percentage, as well as 13th and
11th, respectively in blocking average.
While UCSD and SDSIJ are both having difficult sea
sons and will not likely be a part of the MPSF postseason
tournament, the Cardinal has been a victim to some sur
prise teams already this season. Both Loyola Marymount
and USC were able to pull off upset victories over the
Cardinal in Saturday matches, each after Stanford played
Friday night.
UCSD will rally behind senior outside hitter Ryan
Woods. Woods currently averages just over four kills per
game, but in the Tritons' match with the Cardinal Jan. 23.
Stanford held Woods below that number, with just over
three per game, and a hitting percentage of just .OK7.
While the Tritons are not expected to upset the Car
dinal this weekend they will have a strong desire to
avenge two losses last season to the defending national
champions as well as this season's previous Cardinal vic
tory. They would also hope to pick up their first MPSF
victory of the season.
Tomorrow's match is one the Cardinal looks to wrap
up in better fashion than their Jan. 24 victory over SDSU

— a five-game match. While the
Aztecs do not have a strong record,
they are coming off an impressive
three-game upset over fifth-ranked
Long Beach State.
Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves sees the SDSU victory over
the 49ers as a positive one for Stan
ford.
The victory "is a good reminder
that they are capable and dangerous
and that we need to be at our best to
beat them," Nieves said.
This season, the Aztecs returned
five starters from last year's squad.
Although that squad finished in a tie
for last place in the Pacific Division
of the MPSF, it was considered a
dangerous team because of early up
sets of USC and. like this season.
Long Beach State.
Several of SDSU's returning

starters will make a major impact
on the court for the A/tecs. Senior
outside hitter Matt Hyden, brother
ul Atlanta Olympian John, posted
a team-high 22 kills in this season's
previous Cardinal-Aztec matchup.
Junior middle blocker Tom
Hunter was a close second for
SDSU with IS kills while hitting
.467. Stanford will look to shut
down these two players, as they
have been carrying a heavy hitting
load for SDSU.
Additionally, redshirt senior set
ter Dustin Cremascoli has been a
starter since his freshman year and
will also be a force on the court for
the A/tecs.
While SDSU is not a likely victor
in tomorrow's match, the Cardinal
has dropped Saturday matches for
the last two weeks.
"We need to be on guard,"
Nieves commented, "even though
we're playing the weakest teams in
the league."
