# Struggling Card seeks momentum
## 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
It is now crunch time for the Stan
ford men's gymnastics team. Grant
ed, injury and the inexperience of
young talent has delayed the team's
progress so far this season, hut if the
team fails to pull its routines together
this month, the season may he over.
While the Cardinal is known for
peaking late, the fast-approaching
MPSF Championships (March 27-
28) and looming NCAA Regionals

(April 4) have the gymnasts a hit anx
ious.

MEN S GYMNASTICS
■ This weekend: Stanford competes
in the UCSB Invitational.
Having placed first in only one
meet this season, the transition yeai
has taken its toll on the Cardinal. The
departure of three graduating Ail-
Americans left a void in the team
and though freshmen Jason Hilt/

Rico Andrade and Hobby Osterhoff
have made a strong effort to com
pensate for the loss, the transition has
been rough.
"We freshman have been matur
ing," Andrade said. "We've been
able to compete more like we do in
practice. Competition routines are
now just like any other."
The Cardinal has three crucial
meets in March before the MPSF
C'hampionships — the UCSB Invita
tional this weekend. Cal and Univer
sity of Massachusetts at Berkeley on
March 13, and Army. Cal and Mass
achusetts at Stanford on March 20.
"We're just remaining calm, com
ing in.and doing what we have to
do." said senior co-captain Jeremy
Herman. "We're not worrying that
it's the end of the season."
The pressure is on to perform
well, however. The team's chances of
reaching the NCAA championships
are now in jeopardy.
"Only three teams from the West
Coast qualify for the NCAA champi
onships." said Stanford head coach
Sadao Hamada. "We're probably in
fifth or sixth or seventh place right
now on the West Coast."
After last weekend's promising
showing against Michigan, this week
has been one of exhaustive, intense
training.
"Practices have been excellent,"
Herman said. "Everyone's been real
ly motivated. Saturday's meet
[against Michigan] was the best this
year."
The long practices, which now in
clude a morning session, have tested
the gymnasts' endurance. Despite
being tired, however, the gvmnasts

hope their focused training will pay
off
"It's been a little rough [this
weekj." Herman said. "We started
working out in the mornings, so
we're a little tired. But it's been a pro
ductive week."
As several of these meets feature
top-ranked archrival Cal, the Cardi
nal will gain a clear understanding of
where it stands with the best.
Because the Cardinal features a
small squad with only seven gym
nasts. almost every routine has to be
top-notch in order for the team to be
competitive at the regional and na
tional levels. Six gymnasts compete in
each event, and the top four scores
count.
Teams with large squads are able
to pick and ch<x>se gymnasts for each
event, allowing individual gymnasts
to specialize. The Cardinal, on the
other hand, doesn't enjoy that luxu
ry. The size of the Stanford squad en
tails that each gymnast must be well
rounded and capable of pmting ex
cellent scores in every event.
"This month is going to be a test of
our endurance," Biltz said. "But
we're improving at a very high rate
right now." 1
Hamada is not supremely confi
dent that his team will be able to con
sistently hit the perfectly executed
routines necessary to qualify for the
NC'A As. This season has been one of
his most challenging ever, but he still
has his eye on qualification.
"We're getting back on sched
ule." he said. "We're doing every
thing possible to qualify for the
NCAA championships. 1 think we
can make it."

ford's showing was the best of the season.
