Dearest Leo,
I dreamed of you last night, as I do
every night. Usually 1 dream that I'm
Rose from "Titanic," and you are, of
course, Jack (from "Titanic"). God, I
love that movie! It was so romantic,
hCnv you died and all! Anyway, in my
"dream, we dance with all the poor
people, but I don't mind them being
poor because you taught me that
money doesn't matter — love does.
Then we kiss, and then we run
through the engine room (only in my
dreams the propellers are made of
FLAMINGOES! Is that crazy or
what?).
And boy, is my fiance mad! He's
rich, but his heart is as cold as ice. He
thinks money matters —not love! He
chases us all over, but he can't catch us

because we hide in a car. And then
you save my life and then die in the
cold cold water. Water which is not
only as cold as ice, but is also as blue as
your eyes.
I love your blue eyes. ITiey are as
blue as the sky, and your hair is as
golden as the sun. Which I guess
makes sense, since your hair is above
your eyes, and the sun is technically
above the sky, even though it looks
like its right in it.
That would be like your hair in
your eyes. 1 love when your hair falls
in your eyes, like in all those pictures.
I want to brush it back out of your face
and kiss your smooth forehead.
1 guess your forehead must be the
stratosphere, being in between the
blue sky and the golden sun and all.

Then your nose must be a majestic
mountain range. Maybe like the
Himalayas, and maybe there's a tiny
little Sherpa in there, and the Dalai
Lama is kind of over on the side, like a
freckle or something. Isn't it awful that
Tibet is imprisoned? 1 wish it was free.
I wish there was peace.
Why does there have to be war?
And then the bottom part of your face
is the sea, and your lips are like a little
boat floating on the calm surface of
that sea (your face).
I wrote you a poem. Here it is:
Lips like a soft, red boat
Eyes like the bluest sky
Ocean of tears on which I float
No Leonardo is nigh.
Arrgh, Leonardo, I love you!

Really, I truly do
Do not doubt my devotion to you
Oh, your eyes are blue.
Did you notice how if you put togeth
er the first letter of every line, it adds
up to your name?
I think you're a really good actor. 1
can't believe you didn't get nominated
for an Academy Award!
It makes me so mad! Me and my
best friend Amber think you're the
best actor, because you're so smart
and talented. I love you because of
that, and because you're so cute, and
because you seem really sweet, too.
Amber says she loves you because
you're sexually nonthreatening. She's
such a dork!
I wonder what you're doing right
now. I'm looking at a picture of you as

I write this. I wish
whenever I was
looking at a pic
ture of you, you
were looking at a
picture of me.
God, that's so
stupid! But here's
a picture of me,

just in case you read this.
Oh jeez, I'm so ugly. But I think
you'd love me no matter what I
looked like, because you have a beau
tiful soul, and you'd see we're meant
to be together.
I love you.
I'd be so embarrassed if anyone
ever saw this.

Katie O'Hanrahan wants to be a poet. A
bitter lesson in life is looming.
