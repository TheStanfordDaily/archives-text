Genius upon genius breeds
genius. H.G. Wells, Marlon Brando,
Val Kilmer and David Thewlis
unite to produce perhaps the finest
film of Western cinema: "The
Island of Dr. Moreau." But the real
stars of this film are the manimals
— you see, they are part "man" and
part "animal." Stan Winston's

Creature Workshop, made
famous from its work in "Mon
ster Squad" (another modern
American classic), hits another
horror home run in making
the implausibly terrifying
manimals all too real.
Edward Douglas (David
Thewlis) is lost at sea and his
two companions kill each
other over a bottle of water.
They were on a peace mission.
You see, that is very ironical.

Douglas notes that theywere
more like animals than men. This
ordinary statement, when taken in
the context of the whole movie,
takes on huge significance. On the
island, these manimals are like us,
because sometimes we act like ani
mals and not men, although we
Usually do not look like animals, we
leok like men, unless we are
Women, but sometimes we become
savage like animals or some people
whose names I don't care to men
tion, but I think they know who
they are.
' Douglas is rescued by the bril
liant but insane Montgomery (Val
Kilmer) who takes him to meet the
but insane Dr. Moreau
fMarlon Brando). Douglas soon
meets the manimals and he runs
away in fear. His only saviors are
the good manimals. One of them is
Sassimon, a monkey-man who
wields a baseball bat. Sassimon is
won over by the fact that Douglas
has five fingers. Quite sensibly, Sas
simon smashes many things with
his baseball bat and incoherently
screams his own name before tak
ing Douglas to safety.
Safety comes from The Sayer
of the Law (Ron Perlman). He tells

the manimals to not "jabber," to
not "slurp dnnk from the stream,"
to not "walk on all fours, and to not
"have sex any which way." Thing is,
later in the film Hyena-Swine turns
this whole system upside down by
saying that, in fact, the manimals
should "eat the flesh and fish,"
"slurp drink from the stream" and

"walk on all fours," which is pretty
much the opposite of what the
Sayer of the Law says.
Before that, though, Douglas
meets Dr. Moreau and his mammal
servants. One of them, because he
is a dog-man, pants when he says
his name. Another one (pictured
above) is just tiny and weird look
ing. The most touching scene of the
movie is when that little freaky guy
and Dr. Moreau play the piano,
because the wee weirdo has his own
tiny piano that he plays in synch
with Dr. Moreau. You can see that
the two really love each other.
I don't want to give away too
many surprises. You simply won't
believe what happens when you cre
ate a dangerous new breed of genet
ic misfits with superhuman
strength and large teeth.
The film's bleak epilogue
drives home a dangerous new mes
sage. Douglas says that sometimes
he is reminded of the island by how
humans act. Suddenly we realize
that we are like the manimals!
They are pari man, and that part of
them is noble in reason. Unlike us,
they are also animals, so they get to
look like half animals, like the tiny
ratimals, and the warthogimal and
the sexy catimal.
