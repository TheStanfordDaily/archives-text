## Ralph Reed dartboard! Letters 
### 
Dear Diversions,
Yet again the liberal media
rears its ugly head and finds it fit
to stereotype and misrepresent
those of a conservative political
orientation.
In a recent article, you
found it funny to portray Ralph
Reed's head as a dartboard.
Ralph Reed s head is nothing
like a dartboard, as the facts
easily bear out.
At a recent Conservative
Coalition conference, he even
made the following statement
on the subject: "It is against
God and the Constitution for a
man's face to be like a dart
board. And, with God's help,
my face can continue to look
nothing like a dartboard into

the next millenium."
When is this liberal campus
going to let in the winds of con
servatism that blow freely over
the rest of the nation? Every
day we conservatives come
under attack from people who
are supposedly against stereo
typing. I am fed up with being
described as paranoid, racist
and homophobic by a cabalistic
media run by gay Jews.
Well, that was the weekly
Stanford Review letter. There'll
be another one next week. It's
tough worshipping Ronald Rea
gan on a campus where most
people are intelligent.
Yours,
Theodore Roosevelt


Instructions: Pin to Ralph Reed's face. Throw darts.
