# Navy Seals

Free-falling thousands of feet into the sea,
equipped with full scuba gear, greeted by chilling
waters — not exactly how most students would
spend their breaks. U.S. Navy SEALS, however, not
only embrace such opportunities but also regularly
tackle more challenging situations.
For junior Dave Magnuson and sophomore Steve
Grossman, both of whom are currently training to
enter the Navy SEAL program, such feats represent
an adventurous escape from the banality of every
day life.
"You have to have a fire burning inside you," said

Magnuson. who is currently a

Navy ROTC member.

"It takes a ecrtain

type of deter
mined and moti-

vated person to

want to be ;t SEAL."

The acronym

"SEAL" stands for Sea,

Air. and Land — the ele
ments that the trainees
must conquer. The first

SEAL
tea m s
were
commis-

sioned in
1%2 to partic-

ipate in untradi-

tional warfare, counter-

guerilla warfare and reconnais
sance work in maritime environments. Be
cause of their success in Vietnam, the numbers and
capabilities of SEALS have increased tremendously
The process of becoming a SEAL occurs in stages
and is available only to males under the age of 2N.
First, candidates must fill out an application and take
a physical fitness test. If selected, they train the sum
mer of their junior year for one month in Coronado,
Calif. If they pass this, they train again after gradua
tion for eight months.
"There are several gates they make you go
through to weed out the weak." Magnuson said.
The competition to become a SEAL as a Naval
officer is intense. Over 1(K) apply, but about one
third make it to the first round of training and and
only 12 proceed to the final round.
"A lot of people are initially attracted to the fame,
glory and mystique of being a SEAI . but not all can
make it." Magnuson said
What distinguishes this special warfare division
from the rest of the NAVY Special Operations
forces are their skills as combat divers. 1 he eight
month training program is an intense, physically de
manding priKcss. The first four weeks of physical
conditioning, which includes sprinting for long dis
tances in combat bt>ots. culminates in an intensive
phase called "Hell Week." 1 his self-evident title is
the primary reason that the training program has a
mere 40 percent overall success rate.

The completion of this week, ac
cording to the SEAL Web site,
proves "that the human body can
do 10 times the amount of work the
average man thinks possible."
Training is continuous and
physically grueling as trainees are
permitted a maximum of four
hours of sleep for the entire week.
Participants learn "drown-proof
ing" in which their hands and feet

are bound, and they are tossed into
the ocean for up to 10 hours at a
time.
Other times, they must endure
severe physical stress; they may be
exposed to hypothermia and
forced to run through obstacle
courses amid crossfire and explo
sions.
Magnuson became interested in
becoming a Navy SEAL in high
school and has been training ever
since.
"I met some enlisted Navy
SHALS at my gym in San Diego,

and they seemed like impressive
and driven people. They had fasci
nating stories about their experi
ences, and I became interested at
once," Magnuson said.
Magnuson and Grossman typi
cally run 60 miles a week. Magnu
son, who weighs 160 pounds, can be
spotted at the Tresidder Fitness
Center every day.
He is now able to bench press
over 250 pounds. In mid-February,
the two took a two-day trip in
which they ran to Santa Cruz and
back — over 100 miles.

Magnuson enjoys the strain of
hard exercise and welcomes the
challenge that SF.AL training will
present him.
"I value being physically active
and think that the experience will
be highly rewarding," Magnuson
said.
According to the trainees, some
view the SEALs as renegades who
like to cause a lot of trouble.
However. Magnuson said, "they
are extremely disciplined, and
they're not just out to kill for the
hell of it."
