# Navy Seals

Free-falling thousands of feet into the sea,
equipped with full scuba gear, greeted by chilling
waters — not exactly how most students would
spend their breaks. U.S. Navy SEALS, however, not
only embrace such opportunities but also regularly
tackle more challenging situations.
For junior Dave Magnuson and sophomore Steve
Grossman, both of whom are currently training to
enter the Navy SEAL program, such feats represent
an adventurous escape from the banality of every
day life.
"You have to have a fire burning inside you," said

Magnuson. who is currently a

Navy ROTC member.

"It takes a ecrtain

type of deter
mined and moti-

vated person to

want to be ;t SEAL."

The acronym

"SEAL" stands for Sea,

Air. and Land — the ele
ments that the trainees
must conquer. The first

SEAL
tea m s
were
commis-

sioned in
1%2 to partic-

ipate in untradi-

tional warfare, counter-

guerilla warfare and reconnais
sance work in maritime environments. Be
cause of their success in Vietnam, the numbers and
capabilities of SEALS have increased tremendously
The process of becoming a SEAL occurs in stages
and is available only to males under the age of 2N.
First, candidates must fill out an application and take
a physical fitness test. If selected, they train the sum
mer of their junior year for one month in Coronado,
Calif. If they pass this, they train again after gradua
tion for eight months.
"There are several gates they make you go
through to weed out the weak." Magnuson said.
The competition to become a SEAL as a Naval
officer is intense. Over 1(K) apply, but about one
third make it to the first round of training and and
only 12 proceed to the final round.
"A lot of people are initially attracted to the fame,
glory and mystique of being a SEAI . but not all can
make it." Magnuson said
What distinguishes this special warfare division
from the rest of the NAVY Special Operations
forces are their skills as combat divers. 1 he eight
month training program is an intense, physically de
manding priKcss. The first four weeks of physical
conditioning, which includes sprinting for long dis
tances in combat bt>ots. culminates in an intensive
phase called "Hell Week." 1 his self-evident title is
the primary reason that the training program has a
mere 40 percent overall success rate.
