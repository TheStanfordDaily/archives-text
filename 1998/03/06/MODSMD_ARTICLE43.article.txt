## 
### John Sullivan Staff writer 
Alter a ruin delay and amid peri
odic drizzle. No. 17 Stanford softball
(11-4) split games with the Cal State-
Sacramento Hornets (4-8) at Stan
ford Softball complex.
"We're pretty disappointed about

the loss," said junior Marcy Crouch.
"These were important games be
cause Sacramento is in our region,
and beating them would have given
us an edge when it comes time for re
gionals."
The Card came out Hat against
the Hornets in the first game. Nei
ther team was able to get things start-

Ed, as the game remained scoreless
through six innings. In the seventh,
the Hornets first baseman Jury hit a
run-scoring single to put Sacramento
ahead 1-0.
In the bottom of the seventh.
Stanford finally put its rally caps on.
Freshman Jenny Schiedler started
things off for the Card with a single
up the middle. Sophomore Lauren
Gellman bunted to advance
Schiedler.
When the throw went past the
Hornets first baseman. Schideler
tried to get to third but was thrown
out. In the mix-up, Schideler at
tempted to make it to second, but
was also tagged out. The rally caps
were on. but poor base running deci
sions put a quick end to what looked
like a promising rally.
"We really should have scored
some more runs in the first game,"
Schneider said. "There is no rea
son that pitcher should have kept
us to one hit and no runs for six in
nings."
Junior Becky Blevins (7-1) was on
the mound for the Card. She pitched
a solid game despite earning her first
loss of the season, striking out four
while allowing only five hits in seven
innings.
"We didn't come into the first
game with the intensity level we
should have." said junior Michelle
Schneider. "We weren't sure if we
were going to play due to the weath
er. which partially explains why we
came out flat in the first game. How
ever, in the second game we really
turned it on."
The Hornets got on the score
board quickly in the second game
with a run-scoring single by their
third baseman in the top of the first
inning. Stanford responded in the

bottom of the inning.
Freshman Romona Schelburne
started it off with a walk. Sophomore
Kelly Wiginton advanced the runner
with a well-placed bunt. Crouch fol
lowed with a single up the middle,

■ Yesterday: Sacramento State I,
Stanford 0. No. 17 Stanford 5, Sacra
mento State 1.

Junior Michele Acosta continued
the Cardinal rally by singling to ad
vance Crouch to third. Schideler
then smacked a two-RBI double to
put Stanford ahead. 3-1. The Card
would score two more runs in the
third inning courtesy of the clutch
hitting of Gellman and junior Kelly
Yablonski.
Blevins was again on the mound
for the Card, as Crouch was sidelined
with a sore shoulder. And again she
put in an impressive performance,
striking out five while allowing only
four hits and one walk. Senior Jessi
ca Schulman came into the game in
the seventh inning to finish things out
for the Card.
"Becky did really well in both
games," Schneider said. "Even
though we lost the first game, she was
able to keep them off balance and
guessing the whole time."
Though the field was rain-soaked.
Stanford made three errors in the
field which didn't further its cause.
Last weekend against Long Beach,
the Card made several uncharacter
istic mental errors in the field. This
weekend against Toledo and Cali
fornia, Stanford looks to put an end
to this trend.
