As I write my last note as Arcade editor, major
Asian markets have surged as Tokyo traders
continued to bet on a government reversal on
economic reform, and Hong Kong investors
eyed the possibility of an interest rate cut. Japan's 225-share
Nikkei average climbed 329.97 points or 2.00 percent to
close at 16,831.67, its highest for the day. The Hang Seng
Index surged 255.91 points, or 2.28 percent, to close at a
day high of 11,480.69.
Across the globe, leading European shares were scaling
new peaks at the end of a bullish week. London, Paris and

Frankfurt were all decisively higher in morning trading, boosted partly by a
firmer close on Wall Street but also by fresh merger speculation. On the London
stock exchange, the blue chip FTSE 100 index advanced as newspaper reports
that Glaxo may make a hostile bid for ex-merger-partner SmithKline Beecham
boosted sentiment. Shares were up 40.50 points at 5,805.30 in early trade.
Contrary to what there is around, this is not exciting enough for me.
On the cyber-frontier, President Clinton endorsed a moratorium on new
sales taxes on the Internet and its electronic commerce, arguing the Internet is
just emerging as an economic powerhouse, and the government should not sti
fle its growth with taxes for now. It, after all, is the most promising new eco
nomic opportunity in decades. More than you can handle?
fake a minute, shelve it, walk over to the cover story by Alberto Tovar and
give yourself a close shave. Give him a look over, and I'm sure his story will sing
out. Come back unsatisfied — I'm sure The Daily will offer a full refund, satis
faction guaranteed.
Celebrate out loud with Prof. John Felstiner as he walks about the gardens
of an old friend, colleague, soul. Denise Levertov? Denise Levertov.
What do we need poetry for with a surging Hang Seng Index? How much
free verse can be compiled and interlaced, hypertexted into 4.1? Where is the
gene for that?
Chuck knows what he is doing. He is in complete control. Are you?

Put away your spoonfuls of entrepre
neurial-driven, bleeding-heart market
forces.
If you haven't noticed —
this is Arcade.
