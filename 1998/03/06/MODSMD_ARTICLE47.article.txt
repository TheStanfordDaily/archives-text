## Training Students for the Era of Managed Care 
### Dr. Donald Barr 
At the beginning of the 20th century, medical knowledge — the
information on which medical practice was based — was rudi
mentary and fairly circumscribed, but was about to undergo
profound change. A shift to a scientific basis of medical education fol
lowing the Flexner report and the general acceptance of the germ theo
ry of disease revolutionized how we look at medical practice and the
skills required for medical practitioners. Bacteriology, once a scientific
discipline distinct and separate from medicine, became subsumed under

the broad umbrella of medical knowl
edge and became part of the basic
knowledge required of every medical
practitioner. A few years later, the
same process was to occur with the
inclusion of radiology within medical
knowledge. As the new science of X
rays became broadly accepted, it
became necessary for medical practi
tioners to include a basic understand
ing of radiology in their knowledge
base. The same was to occur for phar
macology, genetics and other areas of
scientific advance.
At the end of the 20th century,
medical knowledge has grown to
encompass areas that practitioners

from 1900 would never have imagined. Medical knowledge in the 21st
century will continue to grow well beyond what we now understand it
to be. I want to suggest that one of the next areas that will eventually be
encompassed by medical knowledge is health policy.
Today we expect every physician to have a basic understanding of
bacteriology, radiology, pharmacology and genetics. Regardless of their

specialty, physicians need to understand fundamental facts and concepts
from a wide range of knowledge. One hundred years from now, I expect
all physicians to have an understanding of basic facts and concepts from
health policy.
What is health policy? You won't find much agreement in the liter
ature or within the profession on this question, so I will give you my
understanding. Health policy is the discipline that encompasses the
organization, financing and delivery of health care. I predict that every

physician will need to have a basic
understanding of the organization,
financing and delivery of health care
in order to function effectively in the
21st century. While no one can accu
rately predict what form health care
delivery will take by the end of the
21 st century, we do have a good idea
of what it will look like at the begin
ning of the century. In the United
States, the early part of the 21st cen
tury will be the "Era of Managed
Care."
Not everyone in health care will
agree about the importance of health
policy as a core part of medical
knowledge. I would like, though, to

offer some thoughts from one person who does share this view. Dr. Ira
Nash works with the cardiology training program at Massachusetts
General Hospital, one of the principal teaching hospitals of Harvard
Universitys School of Medicine. It is his job to interview medical resi
dents who want to train at Harvard as cardiologists. In this role, he
interacts with some of the very best young doctors medicine has to offer.
In an article published in 1995 in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, JAMA,
he described his experiences with these appli
cants.
"All professed a deep commitment to the
pursuit of academic careers and had come to
interview for a handful of fellowship positions
in cardiology. To move the interviews beyond a
monotonous recitation of qualifications and
career plans, we asked many of the residents
for their thoughts about the health care sys
tem. We were shocked when we barely got a
response."
The very best young physicians American
medicine had to offer were clueless about some
of the fundamental health policy questions of
our time. They were unable to express a cogent
opinion about Medicare, managed care, capi
tation, and other issues that ought to be with
in the knowledge base possessed by a modern
physician. Nash went on to suggest, "If, as is
now the case, we find the time in medical

school and residency training to teach things
that most physicians will never need to know,
we should find the teachers and the time to
teach what nearly every physician will need to
know to help address the health care needs of
this nation."
To emphasize the importance of health
policy, I will give an example of how a working
knowledge of organizations and how they
function is important. Many large medical
groups are developing significant problems in
patient access and patient satisfaction that
coincide with their move from a largely fee
for-service system to a system based on capi
tated managed care. At the same time, these
groups are experiencing problems in physician
satisfaction.
The impression of organization man
agers within these groups often is that the
problems in patient access and satisfaction are
because the physicians are not working effi
ciently. These managers apply pressure on the
physicians to see more patients more quickly
while maintaining the quality of their care.

The physicians feel that access and satisfaction
problems are often due to forces outside their
control. The more you try to make them work
harder, the more dissatisfied they become.
It is a basic lesson of organizations theory
that, especially in a service industry such as
health care, organizational structure and orga
nizational environment have profound effects
on the quality of the service process, and that
problems in customer satisfaction are as often
as not tied to organizational weaknesses rather
than poor effort on the part of service employ
ees. It is crucial that both practicing physicians
and physician managers within managed care
systems understand the ways in which organi
zational structure and environment can impact
the quality of the care process.
Another issue in health policy is the deliv
ery of care — that is, what type of system
should our communities and our country have
for the delivery of care? For several years, there
has been an ongoing national debate about
health care delivery. What should we do to
address the problems of the uninsured? How
can Medicare be maintained in the face of an
aging baby boom generation? Should we be
concerned about the injection of the corporate
for-profit ethic into our health care system,
whereby between 10 and 20 cents out of every
health care dollar will often go to shareholders
and top management rather than for patient
care? Is this whole managed competition thing
a good idea? Can we maintain quality of care
in the face of increasing downward pressure on
costs?
I don't pretend to have the answer to these
and the many other questions swirling around
the issue of health care reform. What I can say
with fair confidence is that neither I nor any
other physician will have an effective voice in
the reform process if we don't first understand
the structure and complexities of our current
health care system. It would be a mistake if
physicians weren't actively involved in the
deliberation process heading towards reform.
Every physician must understand this and
must take steps to acquire the knowledge of
health policy that will allow her or him to
function as effectively in the health policy
arena as in the emergency room, the office, or
the intensive care unit.
Thus, in order to train students for the
"Era of Managed Care," we must train them in
bacteriology, radiology and health policy, all as
integral parts of the medical knowledge that
lies at the base of medical practice. This does
n't necessarily mean that we have to cram class
es in health policy into the already-crowded
medical school curriculum. Perhaps health
policy is best suited to the premedical curricu

lum, along with biology and chemistry. It cer
tainly has been my experience at Stanford that
undergraduate pre-med students have a more
intense interest in health policy than do many
of the medical students I have worked with —
not because of any deficiency on the part of
the medical students, but because medical stu
dents often face overwhelming time demands
in trying to absorb pathology, biochemistry
and the intricacies of the physician-patient
encounter.
The optimum situation may be for under
graduate schools and medical schools to coop
erate and collaborate to develop a curriculum
that meets the needs of premedical and med
ical students alike. Thus they can be prepared
for the "Era of Managed Care' with a compre
hensive understanding of the importance of
the organization, financing and delivery of
health care.
Already upwards of 200 undergraduates at
Stanford take my introductory course, "Health

Care in America," each year. These students go
on to study health care reform issues, to work
in governmental policy agencies in
Washington, D.C. and to work with local
delivery organizations in underserved commu
nities. These students come away from these
experiences well-prepared for the questions
often posed by admissions committee mem
bers from medical school. ("So, which do you
think is better, fee-for-service or capitation?")
They are well-prepared to speak knowledge
ably with their patients and their colleagues
about substantive issues of health care reform.
They have confirmed that, analogous to biolo
gy and organic chemistry, health policy is
becoming one of the fundamental building
blocks of knowledge that future physicians
must acquire.
