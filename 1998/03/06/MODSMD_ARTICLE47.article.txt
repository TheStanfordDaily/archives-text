## Training Students for the Era of Managed Care 
### Dr. Donald Barr 
At the beginning of the 20th century, medical knowledge — the
information on which medical practice was based — was rudi
mentary and fairly circumscribed, but was about to undergo
profound change. A shift to a scientific basis of medical education fol
lowing the Flexner report and the general acceptance of the germ theo
ry of disease revolutionized how we look at medical practice and the
skills required for medical practitioners. Bacteriology, once a scientific
discipline distinct and separate from medicine, became subsumed under

the broad umbrella of medical knowl
edge and became part of the basic
knowledge required of every medical
practitioner. A few years later, the
same process was to occur with the
inclusion of radiology within medical
knowledge. As the new science of X
rays became broadly accepted, it
became necessary for medical practi
tioners to include a basic understand
ing of radiology in their knowledge
base. The same was to occur for phar
macology, genetics and other areas of
scientific advance.
At the end of the 20th century,
medical knowledge has grown to
encompass areas that practitioners

from 1900 would never have imagined. Medical knowledge in the 21st
century will continue to grow well beyond what we now understand it
to be. I want to suggest that one of the next areas that will eventually be
encompassed by medical knowledge is health policy.
Today we expect every physician to have a basic understanding of
bacteriology, radiology, pharmacology and genetics. Regardless of their

specialty, physicians need to understand fundamental facts and concepts
from a wide range of knowledge. One hundred years from now, I expect
all physicians to have an understanding of basic facts and concepts from
health policy.
What is health policy? You won't find much agreement in the liter
ature or within the profession on this question, so I will give you my
understanding. Health policy is the discipline that encompasses the
organization, financing and delivery of health care. I predict that every

physician will need to have a basic
understanding of the organization,
financing and delivery of health care
in order to function effectively in the
21st century. While no one can accu
rately predict what form health care
delivery will take by the end of the
21 st century, we do have a good idea
of what it will look like at the begin
ning of the century. In the United
States, the early part of the 21st cen
tury will be the "Era of Managed
Care."
Not everyone in health care will
agree about the importance of health
policy as a core part of medical
knowledge. I would like, though, to

offer some thoughts from one person who does share this view. Dr. Ira
Nash works with the cardiology training program at Massachusetts
General Hospital, one of the principal teaching hospitals of Harvard
Universitys School of Medicine. It is his job to interview medical resi
dents who want to train at Harvard as cardiologists. In this role, he
interacts with some of the very best young doctors medicine has to offer.
