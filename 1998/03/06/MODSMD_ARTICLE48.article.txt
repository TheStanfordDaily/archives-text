1 recall these lines spoken quietly with a subtle
urgent rhythm and caring enunciation. I hen the
poems core image, that of being sealed inside an
anemone, closes this way:
the petals creak and
begin to* rise.
I bey rise and recur/
to a bud's form
and cLunp shut.
I wait in the dark.
But this image was offset by the speaker, a bright
visaged woman in a blue-yellow-and-red pomegranate
flowered dress, and by the illuminating force of her
poem.
I first encountered Denise l.evertov, reading " I he
Pulse" from her "life at War section of Ihe Sorrow
Dance, in Stanford's old Geology Corner in 1966.
(Shed come with her husband Mitch Goodman to take
part in the Voice Project, created by Albert Guerard.)
Having been tutored in the Anglo-European tradition
consummated by W.B. Yeats and T.S. Kliot, I never
imagined that anyone — much less a woman in a
gaudy dress — could fill the role of poet without those
two dignified initials. Yel there she was, utterly authen
tic, articulating what it felt like to live in the United
States during the Vietnam Wars early years. (And who
then could see them as "early"?) As ever with Denise,
her eye offset the clamping dark with "the glitter / of all
that shines out of itself.
Right away it felt necessary to begin teaching her poetry, and I've
been doing that ever since as she brought forth book after book every
two or three years. Once, introducing her, I simply spoke the titles
chronologically like a found poem, a trail of sentience: The Double
Image, Here and Now, Overland to the Islands, With Eyes at the Back of
Our Heads, The Jacob's Ladder, O Taste and See, The Sorrow Dance,
Relearning the Alphabet, To Stay Alive, Footprints, The Poet in the World,
The Freeing of the Dust, Life in the Forest, Light Up the Cave, Candles in
Babylon, Oblique Prayers, Breathing the Water, A Door in the Hive,
Evening Train, Sands of the Well (Why is it, I wonder, that all but one of
these 20 titles balances a pair of stresses?) Also in 1995, a culling of dis
tinct memories Denise called Tesserae, fragments of a mosaic, are now
pieces of a life now complete.
If I try to say what animates Denise Levertov's poetry, what makes
for its motive spirit, I keep coming back to the physical verse itself and
her cadenced voicing. Take, for instance, "The Jacob's Ladder," title
poem from a 1961 collection. The figure is drawn from the Hebrew
Bible, where Jacob dreams of a ladder reaching to heaven with angels on
it. And when I once brought Denise into an undergraduate class, she
said her stone stairway came from an old Mexican village church.
The stairway is not
a thing of gleaming strands
a radiant evanescence
for angels' feet that only glance in their tread, and need not
touch the stone.
It is of stone.
A rosy stone that takes
a glowing tone of softness
only because behind it the sky is a
doubtful, a doubting night gray.
A stairway of sharp
angles, solidly built.
One sees that the angels must spring
down from one step to the next, giving
a little lift of the wings:
and a man climbing
must scrape his knees, and bring
the grip of his hands into play. The cut stone
consoles his groping feet. Wings brush past him.
The poem ascends.
This poem, though not strictly rhymed or metrical, constitutes
something quite different from free verse — or call it free because deeply
ordered by a form of its own. What Denise called "organic form," stem
ming I think from S.T. Coleridge and R.W. Emerson by way of G.M.
Hopkins and Charles Olson, demands a "fine attention" to "rhythmic
and sonic form." A poem is the "exploratory" process of articulating an
experience whereby "form is never more than a revelation of content."
We know we're exploring new terrain — "crying out" on it, as
R.P. Blackmur used to say — when that opening line breaks on "not,"
freeing us from preordained conceptions. And we know we're in the
shaping hands of someone for whom rhythm and sound (thanks to bal
let and music at an early age) matter no less than sense, when the stair
way emerges aurally: "It is of stone. / A rosy stone that takes / a glowing
tone of softness." A Keatsian music—this is, after all, a poet's poem —
gives way to something like Hopkins in the startlingly lilted line breaks

of stanza three:
One sees that the angels must spring
down from one step to the next, giving a little
lift of the wings.
Then down-to-earth language — "a man climbing / must scrape his
knees" — discerns a traditional act of spiritual petition in the making of
a poem. And again the rhythmic form of sound reveals the content of a
human truth:"The cut stone / consoles his groping feet." A palpable
movement of words embodies one of spirit. Franz Kafka put it, in his
notebook: "Writing as a form of prayer."
What should you bring to the reading of a poem?
Attentiveness, Denise liked to say: not a reaching for preformed
ideas but a fullness of "sensuous apprehension" — apprehension, I d
guess, in all the senses of that word. She often cited Muriel Rukeyser's
response to the question of what you should bring to a poem: "ALL of
yourself."
"ALL of yourself." Denise Levertov made the political personal in a
host of poems like "The Pulse." Increasingly during the 1960s and
1970s and thereafter too, what with Vietnam and Central America and
nuclear buildup and wastage of the natural world, her witness both
in person and in poems — became indispensable for people of all sorts
all over this country.
What I honor, what I cherish about this "poet in the world (as she
aptly named her first essay collection) is the way resistance, anger, exhor
tation come fused (as they must be) with one persons intimate contour,
texture, tempo — which is at once to say, with a poem's essential organ
ic form.
As far back as 1959 Denise had said: "Insofar as poetry has a social
function, it is to awaken sleepers by other means than shock." Here
from 1981 is "Candles in Babylon," where a child's nursery rhyme joins
a Christian cantata to impel the private / public poet's desperate voice:
Through the midnight streets of Babylon
between the steel towers of their arsenals,
between the torture castles with no windows,
we race by barefoot, holding tight
our candles, trying to shield
the shivering flames, crying
'Sleepers Awake!'
hoping
the rhymes promise was true,
that we may return from this place of terror
home to a calm dawn and
The work we had just begun.
I'm sure that Denise subscribed, in her modest stubborn way, to her
mentor William Carlos Williams's claim: "It is difficult / to get the news
from poems / yet men die miserably every day / for lack / of what is
found there." What I've come to value along with her political "Sleepers
Awake!" is Denise Levertov's vivifying touch for the natural world. A
concordance to her work, if ever such a thing were made, would abound
with the simple names of things, from apricot and bramble to yarrow
and zinnia and back again 100 times over. Especially she regarded the
fragile elements of our environment. And just as in Denises socially ori
ented writing, her poetry on Earth's threatened beauties is animated by
her sense of the sacredness in all things — a sacredness one would have
thought inviolable. Behind many passages of hers stand Hopkins's
"Binsey Poplars":
O if we but knew what we do
When we delve or hew—
Hack and rack the growing green!
"O Taste and See," she titled an early book,
and that psalmic cry turned more and more
urgent as the century's hewing and hacking
wore on.
"In California," a poem from her years at
Stanford, starts with morning light
emblazoning
summits of palm and pine,
the dew
lingering,
scripture of scintillas.
Soon the roar
of mowers
cropping the already short
grass of lawns,
men with long-nozzled
cylinders of pesticide
poking at weeds,
at moss in cracks of cement.
Originally Denise gave this poem an epi
graph from Chronicles 36:21 about the land of
Israel during the Babylonian exile: "All the days
that it lay desolate it kept Sabbath . . ."
Certainly her sense of the sacred arose in part
from Judaic roots. (Her father was a Russian
Jew, her mother a Welsh Christian.) But doubt
less I myself am over-inclined to trace those
roots. In my library at home, I take the liberty
of placing Denises books in the shelves reserved
for Jewish authors, alongside Else Lasker-
Schiiler and Emma Lazarus. In my office,
though, she's in a bookcase of American poets,
where she'd wish to be.
Sometimes Denises fiercely single-minded
political sympathies led us to differ on the
Arab-Israeli conflict. Yet I rejoice in the Hasidic
fervency she absorbed from her father and in
her biblical steeping as well, which persists
throughout her career as it arced toward the
Catholic church.
To my mind one of Denise Levertov's
imperishable poems, "An English Field in the
Nuclear Age," infuses Catholic doctrine with
earthly passion, ending as
thistles, nettles, subtle silver
of long-dried cowpads,
gold mirrors of buttercup satin
assert eternity as they reflect
nothing everything absolute instant,
and dread

holds its breath, for
this minute at least was
not the last.
"To render it!," this poem had begun,
insisting that no true vision can be shared
"unless / (named, spun, tempered, stain of it /
sunk into steel of utterance) it / be wrought.'
Akin to such renderings of the physical
world's "sunbless'd particulars," Denise kept a
"Franciscan sense of wonder" (her phrase for
Williams) vis-a-vis commonplace material
things and common people alike. Not only did
she generously foster many young writers; she
would bend toward any promising soul. When
I telephoned my sister to let her know the griev
ous news, she recalled a dinner I'd given years
before, where Denise had been attentive to
Susan's concerns. "Not at all like !" my
sister added, naming a famous homme de let
tres she'd also met at my home.
The point is, Denises several sorts of atten
tiveness — to literature, music and art; history
and politics; nature; religion; people — all
issued from the one core; an active, appercep
tive spirit, a "savor of creation" she prized in
Rilke, at the close of her essay collection Light
Up the Cave. "In California" ends with her ask

ing.
Who can utter
the poignance of all that is constantly
threatened, invaded, expended
and constantly
nevertheless
persists in beauty . . .
Yet she knew herself capably drawn by that
urgency, that renewable energy of hers.
During the dozen or so years that Denise
taught each winter at Stanford, -she lived across
a green field behind my house on campus.
Once or twice when I wanted to present her
poems in class, wanted to imprint their pres
ence, I walked across that field the night before
and asked her to record them. She gave my pal
try tape machine the same intentness she gave a
major audience.
Like countless other people, I'll go on living
with the presence of Denise Levertov's poems
but now for the first time living without this
poet's own presence in our world. Yet thanks to
her we needn't wait in the dark.

colleague of Denise Levertov, is a profes
