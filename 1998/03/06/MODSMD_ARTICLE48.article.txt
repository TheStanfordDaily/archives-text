1 recall these lines spoken quietly with a subtle
urgent rhythm and caring enunciation. I hen the
poems core image, that of being sealed inside an
anemone, closes this way:
the petals creak and
begin to* rise.
I bey rise and recur/
to a bud's form
and cLunp shut.
I wait in the dark.
But this image was offset by the speaker, a bright
visaged woman in a blue-yellow-and-red pomegranate
flowered dress, and by the illuminating force of her
poem.
I first encountered Denise l.evertov, reading " I he
Pulse" from her "life at War section of Ihe Sorrow
Dance, in Stanford's old Geology Corner in 1966.
(Shed come with her husband Mitch Goodman to take
part in the Voice Project, created by Albert Guerard.)
Having been tutored in the Anglo-European tradition
consummated by W.B. Yeats and T.S. Kliot, I never
imagined that anyone — much less a woman in a
gaudy dress — could fill the role of poet without those
two dignified initials. Yel there she was, utterly authen
tic, articulating what it felt like to live in the United
States during the Vietnam Wars early years. (And who
then could see them as "early"?) As ever with Denise,
her eye offset the clamping dark with "the glitter / of all
that shines out of itself.
