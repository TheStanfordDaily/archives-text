## Seeking Answers 
### Sayra Khandekar 
I remember the day I left for college last September. Like everyone
else, I pondered the uncertainty of the next few days and where they
would lead me in"the rest of my life." The night before I left, I acknowl
edged that at this time the next day, I would begin a new daily schedule,
complete with new people, new places and a funny look whenever I
decided to say "y'all."
I had packed the material things that would make my bare dorm
room "home" for the next eight months, but I felt that my life would be
completely new. I was leaving family, friends, a region with a culture all
its own and basically everything I was used to. The only things I knew I
was taking was me: my habits, my quirks and my beliefs. And while the
first two would even change, the third was cemented in me as something
much stronger that kept me grounded in the worst of times: my faith.
Along with my prayer rug and copy of the Koran, I was taking the
reminders and lessons from my parents, grandfather and years of Sunday
school. These would form the base from which I would always learn
more, they all insisted. And so they were the last to be packed and the
first to emerge when my mother and I unpacked the next day in my new
room. One of the first things my father and I searched out was the loca
tion of Friday prayers, and one of the first people I met here was the pres
ident of the Islamic Society. Throughout the confusion of moving in, fig
uring out that, yes, I was ready to take college courses and getting used
to a very lively dorm atmosphere, praying five times a day gave me sta
bility, a foundation on which to base my "new life." Now I look back on
these months and examine the establishment of myself here on campus
and how my faith and religious beliefs played a vital role in that.
It is interesting that we often look at university campuses as places
that examine culture and politics, but it is not surprising. Universities
have always been places of involvement and activism. We are told the
endless stories of people who "found themselves" in college. In a sense,
they do find themselves in the organizations, activities and the people
they meet. Part of who (or what) they find is influenced by those three
things, but part is always within them and is based in their own history.
It is a natural and logical process: a person is given many choices and
options; their decisions shape their experience, but what is within them
shapes their decisions. It must be the environment of learning in a uni
versity that creates its affinity for exploration. Organizations and associ
ations on campus are all about learning and exploring; we are trying to
find ourselves, and we will look everywhere we can. This is not as des
perate a journey as it may sound to some. We are supposed to enjoy the
slow process of discovery. The years as a student are the best of a person's
life, we are told. Our missteps along the way are part of the learning
process. As students, the allowances we are given for mistakes encourages
us to learn and grow. And at the end of it all? We should have a better
idea of who we are, what we believe and where we are going. Never go
into college with preconceived notions of your own future, they warn,
because they will inevitably change.
All of the above applies to spiritual discovery in college. (By "spiritu
al," I mean religion as organized or personal, and "faith" as practice or
conviction). Much of that discovery is associated with some sort of com
munity. Religious organizations on campus hold "regular" activities such
as weekly prayer services or programs specific to holidays, but almost
more vital to their groups are the retreats, study groups and community
dinners. For a student who has left home, family, their own community
and in some cases their own country, a community on campus is vital.

"It provides consistency and stability," said Islamic Society President
Imran Maskatia, a coterminal student. "For those students who have a
strong religious background, there is the need to maintain ties with a reli
gious community." And for international students especially, becoming
part of a community is vital; in order to find a place, many look first at
their religious backgrounds.
Not all of the community building and involvement in religious
organizations is based on a need for stability. The community a student
leaves behind may be quite different from the one he or she becomes
involved with. "Either the community at home didn't exist, or for some
reason it didn't appeal to them," Maskatia explained. What makes the
campus community different? The tendency of religious organizations
on campus to be more activist tends to draw more interest, as does the
fact that they're mainly student-run groups and therefore more indicative
of student interests. "All the factors match for them. . . . The circle of
people is tighter," Maskatia said.
There are also those students for whom involvement in a certain
religious organization is an exploration into that religion. This is more
common in an educational environment where a person is exposed to the
writings or people of different religions. One of the main purposes of
Residential Education, as we are told over and over again, is to give
Stanford students this exposure. Beyond reading various informational
texts, a curious student finds it much more useful to talk with members
of a different faith, to observe their practices and to participate in their
community activities. If that student then decides to adopt that new
faith, a community becomes even more important as a means of adjust
ment to a new lifestyle. Sometimes a strong enough community attracts
people first; curiosity about the religion itself then intrigues someone fur
ther. People have an intrinsic need for community and a sense of belong
ing. Religious organizations, including those at Stanford, are built
around the appeal of a community.
I'm no advocate for exclusionary practices. Religious groups who are
not welcoming to the curious observer or who make it difficult to learn
more about their beliefs are, in my humble opinion, not communities:
they should be viewed with great caution for being cult-like and hosting
platforms for people's personal agendas. A community, while being
strong within itself, should not feel threatened by "outsiders"; a well-built
community is able to maintain its integrity and share the love, so to
speak. Becoming involved in a religious organization is not an immedi
ate action for everyone; it may take a couple of weeks, a quarter, or even
years to explore yourself and find a community. "A lot of it is finding
people like you," Maskatia said.
Of course, there are people who will never take that route. For most
people, however, there is a need to be around people with whom they
share a belief. "It doesn't make you close-minded. In college, there are
going to be a wide variety of things you will experience no matter what.
You need depth, but diversity doesn't provide depth. It's the kind of
depth religious, cultural and ideological groups provide, Maskatia said.
Even as I came here feeling strong in my faith, my journey is no eas
ier than anyone else's. I do not and will never pretend to know enough
about how I feel, what I believe, or what I know. What kind of a world
would we have if we were ever satisfied with "enough." Challenge your
self to be involved and to explore, even to question. It's not wrong to seek
the answers — its wrong to assume you have them all.

reason it didn't appeal to them," Maskatia explained. What makes the
campus community different? The tendency of religious organizations
on campus to be more activist tends to draw more interest, as does the
fact that they're mainly student-run groups and therefore more indicative
of student interests. "All the factors match for them. . . . The circle of
people is tighter," Maskatia said.
There are also those students for whom involvement in a certain
religious organization is an exploration into that religion. This is more
common in an educational environment where a person is exposed to the
writings or people of different religions. One of the main purposes of
Residential Education, as we are told over and over again, is to give
Stanford students this exposure. Beyond reading various informational
texts, a curious student finds it much more useful to talk with members
of a different faith, to observe their practices and to participate in their
community activities. If that student then decides to adopt that new
faith, a community becomes even more important as a means of adjust
ment to a new lifestyle. Sometimes a strong enough community attracts
people first; curiosity about the religion itself then intrigues someone fur
ther. People have an intrinsic need for community and a sense of belong
ing. Religious organizations, including those at Stanford, are built
around the appeal of a community.
I'm no advocate for exclusionary practices. Religious groups who are
not welcoming to the curious observer or who make it difficult to learn
more about their beliefs are, in my humble opinion, not communities:
they should be viewed with great caution for being cult-like and hosting
platforms for people's personal agendas. A community, while being
strong within itself, should not feel threatened by "outsiders"; a well-built
community is able to maintain its integrity and share the love, so to
speak. Becoming involved in a religious organization is not an immedi
ate action for everyone; it may take a couple of weeks, a quarter, or even
years to explore yourself and find a community. "A lot of it is finding
people like you," Maskatia said.
Of course, there are people who will never take that route. For most
people, however, there is a need to be around people with whom they
share a belief. "It doesn't make you close-minded. In college, there are
going to be a wide variety of things you will experience no matter what.
You need depth, but diversity doesn't provide depth. It's the kind of
depth religious, cultural and ideological groups provide, Maskatia said.
Even as I came here feeling strong in my faith, my journey is no eas
ier than anyone else's. I do not and will never pretend to know enough
about how I feel, what I believe, or what I know. What kind of a world
would we have if we were ever satisfied with "enough." Challenge your
self to be involved and to explore, even to question. It's not wrong to seek
the answers — its wrong to assume you have them all.
