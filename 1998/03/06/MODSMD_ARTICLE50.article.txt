## Big Plans for the future 
### Alexandra Huddleston 
Much thought has been put into where the Egyptian
mummy will be displayed in the new Iris and B. Gerald
Cantor Center for the Visual Arts at Stanford. When
the center s new building reopens in January 1999, the
mummy will be one of the main attractions for groups of school chil
dren visiting from the surrounding community. The mummy will be sit
uated at one end of the Ancient Mediterranean Gallery, surrounded by
plenty of space for the curious to gather and gaze at the remains of a
woman born during the Ptolemaic dynasty.
The museum's collection contains works valuable not only to young
children but to the students and faculty on campus. "By studying from

original sources you can experience the
aura of an object," Joel Leivick
explained. Leivick has been a professor
of photography since 1981 and curator
of photography for the museum since
1986. This term, Leivick is teaching "A
History of Photography," a course he
declares is "the most exciting class I have
ever taught." Instead of using the typi
cal sequence of books and slides nor
mally seen in art history courses, for this
seminar, Leivick draws mainly on origi
nal works found on campus. The stu
dents meet twice a week to view pho
tographs in the collections of the Art
and Architecture Library, Green Library
Special Collection and the print storage

area of the Stanford Museum. "The original prints are often small, del
icate. 'I he paper, the handwriting in the margins, all of these factors are
very important," Leivick explained. "The aura is lost in reproduction."
Unfortunately, a class such as Leivick's is available to only a small
number of students. Since the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake seriously
damaged the old Stanford Museum, the center's extensive collection has
been stored away from the eyes of most students and faculty. However,
in the past few years, as plans have progressed on the redesign and
reopening of the museum, steps have been taken to ensure that the cen
ters collection will soon be more accessible to the public than ever

before. The positions of museum director, curator of modern and con
temporary art and curator for education have all been newly created and
filled since the earthquake.
According to Patience Young, the center's curator for education, the
museum's most visible involvement with the community has been
through its docent program. For the past quarter of a century, interest
ed members of the community have volunteered their time to conduct
tours of Stanford's architecture and sculpture. With the opening of the
center, the docents' role will again include tours of the permanent col
lection. "Unfortunately, students can't do the training program required
to be a docent. It takes a full academic year," Young explained. However,

she mentioned that once the center
opens, a special docent program
with a briefer training period may
be established for students.
Young stressed that the facilities
and space available for educational
purposes played a considerable role
in the redesign of the center s new
building. "The planning committee
developed a list of essentials among
which were accessibility for students
and faculty and an active involve
ment with the campus," Young said.
Among the new center's most inter
esting features are the Pigott Gallery,
a large temporary gallery for big
shows; The Halperin Gallery, a spe-

cial exhibitions gallery designed mainly for delicate works on paper; and
an experimental gallery, which can accommodated exhibits on media as
diverse as virtual reality or radiology. The building's new electronic play
room will house three computers, one with direct access to the center s
database, another with a World Wide Web connection and the third
with access to a selection of CD-ROMS. A study room will be located
next the buildings art storage area. " There classes can come to look at
things not on view," Young explained.
Both Young and Leivick feel that the very reopening of the building
will constitute its main influence on the campus's student and faculty
body. " The exhibited works are only a hint of the museum's holdings,"
Leivick explained. "In the exhibits, we're trying to give a sense of what
the museum collects and why."
According to Leivick, the chronology and geography of the
exhibits as well as the teaching materials such as labels, texts and hand
outs, all are part of the center's teaching mission.
The center has also been discussing the options for using the col
lection in collaborative classes with the Art Department. According to
Young, the School of Education has ideas for how the museum could
be used as a laboratory for understanding more about how people learn
through art.
"Behind the scenes there will be work-study and internship oppor
tunities with the curatorial staff and registrar's office," Young said. "We
have tried to maintain and awareness of the different levels of involve
ment, the different needs of the undergraduate and graduate students."
Young explained that in recent years the center has only been able to
work with a small number of students on an individual basis, but
opportunities for a more established program may develop with the
building's reopening.
Over the past nine years, the center's collection has not been total
ly inaccessible to students and faculty. Professors and lecturers like
Leivick, mainly in studio art and art history, have used the museum's
works in their teaching. Art Professor Wanda Corn taught a seminar in
which her students produced an exhibition titled "After Image." The
students' project reconsidered and reinterpreted photographic works
from"The Enduring Illusion," an exhibition previously displayed by

the center. Assoc. Art Professor Melinda Takeuchi has used the old
study gallery to show pieces to students in her introductory Asian
course.
I he students in Asoc. Professor Michael Marrinan's seminar on
18th century enlightenment, assembled an exhibition called "The Look
of Reason: Strategies of Description in the 18th Century." With the
opening of the new building, such collaboration between the center
and Stanford faculty will hopefully continue and grow.
"It's unique to have a museum that opens its arms to the student
body," Leivick said. Young agreed saying, "In the past we've worked
with Art Department faculty, but we hope that other faculty will see a
value in using the museum."
Each year the docents conduct a tour for medical students of
the Rodin Sculpture Garden. The tour focuses on the sculptures hands,
their anatomy and their expressive force. Young hopes the museum's
reopening will bring even more such involvement for all academic dis
ciples.
" lb judge by my student's reaction this quarter, there is just
such a sense of excitement when allowed to access the actual objects,"
Leivick said. "That kind of learning experience can't be replicated."
Hopefully, when the museum reopens, Stanford's students and faculty
will enthusiastically cluster around the Egyptian mummy, Rodin's
sculptures and exhibits on radiology with the same excitement as the
visiting kindergartners.

Over the past nine years, the center's collection has not been total
ly inaccessible to students and faculty. Professors and lecturers like
Leivick, mainly in studio art and art history, have used the museum's
works in their teaching. Art Professor Wanda Corn taught a seminar in
which her students produced an exhibition titled "After Image." The
students' project reconsidered and reinterpreted photographic works
from"The Enduring Illusion," an exhibition previously displayed by

the center. Assoc. Art Professor Melinda Takeuchi has used the old
study gallery to show pieces to students in her introductory Asian
course.
I he students in Asoc. Professor Michael Marrinan's seminar on
18th century enlightenment, assembled an exhibition called "The Look
of Reason: Strategies of Description in the 18th Century." With the
opening of the new building, such collaboration between the center
and Stanford faculty will hopefully continue and grow.
"It's unique to have a museum that opens its arms to the student
body," Leivick said. Young agreed saying, "In the past we've worked
with Art Department faculty, but we hope that other faculty will see a
value in using the museum."
Each year the docents conduct a tour for medical students of
the Rodin Sculpture Garden. The tour focuses on the sculptures hands,
their anatomy and their expressive force. Young hopes the museum's
reopening will bring even more such involvement for all academic dis
ciples.
" lb judge by my student's reaction this quarter, there is just
such a sense of excitement when allowed to access the actual objects,"
Leivick said. "That kind of learning experience can't be replicated."
Hopefully, when the museum reopens, Stanford's students and faculty
will enthusiastically cluster around the Egyptian mummy, Rodin's
sculptures and exhibits on radiology with the same excitement as the
visiting kindergartners.
