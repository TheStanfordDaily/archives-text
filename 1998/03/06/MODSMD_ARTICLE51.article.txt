### Alberto Tovar 
Alberto Tovar graduated from Stanford University in 1997.
He currently attends the Refugee Studies Programme at the
Univesity of Oxford in England and earlier this year spent
three months in Nepal researching the geopolitics of the
Himalayan nations regarding refugees in eastern NepaL He
offers here a general discussion on refugees as well as analy
sis of his own research on the expulsion of Nepalese from the
Himalayan nation of Bhutan.

In daily conversation, we take for granted the word home. We use phras
es such as "I'm going home or "It's at home." We know of a "home"
with four walls that we can call our own, a home that will be there
when we go back. Whether it be a dorm room or the home our parents
live in, we have somewhere secure. Rarely do we see beyond the glass windows
to the real worlds that are not our own. In our pursuit of straight As, the mag
icaj 4.0, and the letters of recommendation, we ignore many issues that shape
other realities in this world. Yet there are populations that lack homes and
nations to call their own. Today the global population of refugees numbers
more than 25,000,000.
While homelessness is very serious dilemma common to our society, there
arc few of us who can relate to the plight of refugees. Many of us detest how
homeless people are treated, Local governments often attempt to remove the
"problem," of homelessness from sight with the hopes of then removing it
from our minds and thus eventually from our concern. In attempts to hide
this "problem" local governments regard it as an incurable social ill and seek
to conceal homelessness rather than alleviate it.
In the situations that produce refugees, governments have commited even
further injustices. Rather than pursue a solution, governments thave often

worked towards the elimination of the "problem", that is, the elimination
of the people within the "problem". The Nazi policies of the 1930s and 1940s
Germany remains history's most noted example of such a "final" solution.
Hitlers policies did not develop solutions to its refugee problems, they sought
to eliminate the refugees. Most recently, the ethnic cleansing in the former
Yugoslavia and the Great lakes region of Africa (Burundi and Rwanda) show
that the Third Reich's actions were not an anomaly in history.
These situations have never been considered unique to the 20th century.
For centuries individuals have sought asylum in other countries. Kings, nobles
and elites were consistently accepted into foreign lands as revolutions over
turned their governments. Periods of religious persecution created migration
patterns between the states of Western Europe. The reconqucst of Spain in
1492 sent Muslims fleeing to Africa while the Spanish Inquisition forced
many Jews to either leave their homes or face death. England's oppression ot
Catholics sent many to France. The French Huguenots, English Puritans and
Quakers, are a few of the groups that were the unwanreds of Europe and also
the colonists of present-day United States.
The history of our very own "great nation" has been involved in every
aspect of refugees. It has created them (ask the Native Americans if they want
ed to leave their homes), it has accepted them (Hungarians, Laotians,
Nicaraguans and, among other individuals, Albert Einstein), and it has even
refused them, with the latter serving as one of the greatest marks against the
United States's past. Hundreds of Jews fleeing Germany in the 1930s arrived
by ship on the East Coast, only to be summarily returned to the anti-Semitic
policies in Europe.
The differences between today and centuries past is that today's world has
been for the most pan carved up into nation-states. One can no longer "go
West" to unexplored land and establish new lives. Nations can no longer claim
and develop uninhabited lands. In many places the situation has reversed to
governments seeking to depopulate areas in order to guarantee, if not create,
more room for people of their own "kith and kin." These policies have been
justified by the underlying assertion that a state owes "its people", where the

nation of origin) and Nepali to describe those still living in Nepal.

criteria for "its people" is defined by the state,
and draws reference to the social contract each
one of us entered upon birth. Governments
today are narrowing the criteria regarding who
constitutes their "people" and have redefined
many of the stipulations of this social contract,
specifically, to whom the state is obligated.
The international order of law and nation
states is based on a social contract in which a
state guarantees the protection to its nationals.
In return, each national agrees to follow and
adhere to that states laws and customs. In
bonafide refugee cases, this contract has been
broken.
The state no longer chooses (or is no longer
capable of) extending protection to the said
individuals, and hence those individuals
choose to go beyond the borders of their coun
try in order to seek refuge and asylum in
another. (There are many variants to this, but
for the most part, the statement holds) The
asylum-seeker's immediate future is then deter
mined by the host state. In individual flight
cases, Western nations determine whether the
asylum-seeker's fear of persecution is well
founded. If so, the refugee is given the oppor
tunity to resettle and enter into a new social
contract with the host-nation. In Europe, how
ever, this has become more difficult, to the
point where the continent has gained the
moniker "Fortress Europe."
Europeans currently fear that they will be
overwhelmed by foreigners seeking a better life.
During the Cold War, Western Europe consid-

I am a refugee.
I was a refugee, in many lands for many years.
At that time, I felt there was no hope.
There was no hope because refugees need hope and find none.
Who is a refugee?
It is someone who feels unwanted undeserved.
Because of us there are too many refugees in the world.

They need a refuge.
We are their refuge.

ered the Mediterranean nations as the soft
underbelly through which communism could
expand. Today they fear that those southern
European nations will serve as the soft under
belly through which African refugees may
enter.
For the United States, the situation is vast
ly different. The majority of refugee-causing
situations occur in South Asia and Africa,
regions far from Washington, D.C. The major
ity of refugees in the world are the politically
silenced and the poor, those who lack the capa
bility to defend against threatening actions as
well as those who lack the economic capital
necessary for passage to North America.
During the Cold War the United States' for
eign policy funded factions involved in nation
al conflicts in order to contain communism,
and consequently caused internal and interna
tional displacement.
Thereafter, many Latin American nationals
crossed into other countries. Many fled from
their own nation's security forces, forces that in
theory pledged to protect the people but which
in reality only protected the interests of the
elite. In many cases, the United States would
accept refugees fleeing the insecurity of their
country of origin, but the majority stayed
within their region, with few attempting to
enter the United States.
Today, the United States State Department
recognizes the majority, if not all, of the Latin
American countries as "democratic." Many
analysts question whether the United States

would be willing to accept refugees from
"democratic" nations. In explaining this argu
ment, they point to the significance of the
United States choosing to accept refugees from
a state. In such a situation, the asylum govern
ment is in essence declaring the state of origin
inadequate in fulfilling its role in the social
contract, a very strong political statement.
Thus, it would lead one to assume that
denouncing a Latin American government
would not further Washington's goal in devel
oping the Americas into its own economic
trading zone able to compete with the
European Union (EU) and the Association of
South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Recently many events in the Caribbean, on
the other hand, have demanded greater atten
tion from the United States. In 1980, the
United States declared Cuba as unfit to ade
quately protect its nationals' freedoms. Rather
than dealing with individual claims for asylum,
the government was required to manage a large
number of immigrants.
Thanks to the age of information and com
munications technology, we are bombarded
with images of frail refugees housed in isolated
camps within proximity to warzones. These
images are not of one individual seeking safety
but of thousands. Entire towns, from Bosnia to
Rwanda, are forced to flee because their homes
no longer provide the safety and security that
we benefit from every day. Many of these fam
ilies are not simply worried about the possibili
ty of violence and crime in their lives but

instead face the question: "what do we do
when they do come?".
The issue is not if they will be persecuted
and forced from their homes, but when.
They flee alone or with the remaining family
that they have. They leave their homes, their
livelihoods, and even their identities.
Having acknowledged the political, eco
nomic, and human tragedies of refugees
through years of study, I set out last year to
journey to Nepal, towards one of the poorest
nations in the world and towards a people
whose situation few are aware of, and even
fewer care about.

Nepal was obviously different from any
thing I had experienced in Europe, the
United States or Mexico. It rendered me con
scious of the vast difference between what we
have and what is truly necessary. In the vil
lages high on the base of the Himalayas, I did
not require anything other than a hole in the
ground for a restroom, a kerosene lamp for
light, a fire for cooking, and a bed only high
enough to keep the farm animals off of me.
Staying in the home of a friend s family and
was told that the Nepalese villages in Bhutan
were probably structured in the same way.
Bhutan which borders India to the south
and China to the north, has been characterized
as a country in trouble. The national govern
ment in Thimpu has never denied that
Bhutan's small size and relative underdevelop
ment has left it vulnerable to external political
and military aggression.
Bhutan honors a treaty with India that
places its foreign policy and defense at the con
sultation of New Delhi. But its greatest fear lies
in the destruction of its cultural autonomy, a
loss which it sees tantamount to the destruc
tion of its national sovereignty. As the only
independent Bhuddist kingdom in the world,
Bhutan's government provides its citizens with
a very limited democracy, investing its execu
tive power in the wisdom of King Jigme Singye
Wangchuk. With two bordering hegemonic
powers, Thimpu fears their corrupting influ
ence on Bhutan's unique culture. The govern
ment of Bhutan believes that the survival of
their kingdom, and hence the nation as they
know it, depends on the strength and
endurance of their cultural practices. In a
region dominated by Hindu, Muslim, and
Communist nations, Bhutan's unique culture
is its strongest variable in maintaining sover
eignty. Its image as a Bhuddist Shangri-La
attracts international aid as well as cultural vis
its from Western diplomats, both of which
serve to legitimize the status quo. Furthermore,
Thimpu is haunted by memories of Sikkim's

annexation into the Indian Union.
Sikkim was a nation to the north of India
wedged in between Nepal and Bhutan.
Migration patterns throughout the century in
the Himalayan region led to thousands of
Nepalese politically overwhelming Sikkim's
indigenous population. In 1975, Sikkim's pop
ulace voted to renounce its independence and
become a State within India. Thimpu is great
ly concerned that Bhutan's demographic pat
terns offer an eerie similarity to those of pre
-1975 Sikkim, and it is Bhutan's fear that its fate
may lie somewhere near Sikkim's.
Prior to the late 1980s, southern Bhutan
had been heavily populated by migrants from
the Nepalese diaspora of the Himalayan
region. Depending on the source, the Nepalese
in the south numbered anywhere from one
third to half of the population, with the exact
numbers in dispute.
The truth is difficult to assess for two rea
sons: a) a census has never been published, and
b) a large number (as many as half) of the
Nepalese from the south have been expelled. If
the population estimate of one-half is correct,
then the Hindu Nepalese would dwarf the
"indigenous" population and therefore threat
en the legitimacy of the power elite in Thimpu.
The controversy lies in regards to the
Nepalese's permission to reside. The Nepalese
state that they had been invited to enter as eco
nomic migrants in order to develop the south
of Bhutan. The Bhutanese authorities declare
that the majority are illegal immigrants who
took advantage of a loosely regulated border,
flooded the area, and alter the nations identity.

On the surface, the issue appears to be a debate
concerning a nation's authority to control its
borders and to determine its criteria for nation
ality and residence. But the underlying impli
cations are much more dire.
Bhutan sees itself as fighting for its proper
existence. According to Thimpu estimates, less
than half of its population is of the culture, or
the ethnic national identity, from which the
Bhutanese government derives its legitimacy.
To safeguard against a repetition of the events
that doomed Sikkim, the Bhutanese govern
ment implemented policies emphasizing its
cultural norms. The Hindu Nepalese in the
south felt that these policies oppressed their
cultural expression. Encouraged by the con
temporary democratic movement that had top
pled the absolute monarchy in their ethnic
homeland of Nepal in 1991, Nepalese villagers
began to protest and demonstrate against these
policies, calling for democratization of the
country. These actions conflicted with
Bhutanese culture and law, which demand a
high respect for its king and his authority.
Since its inception at the beginning of the
century, the Bhutanese government has out
lawed any denunciation of the government —
an action which, if convicted of, is punishable
by execution. Arrests on these grounds, as well
as on the legal equivalents to conspiracy to
overthrow the government, the harboring of
criminals, and association to criminal intent,
were made to quell the disturbances.
According to the expelled Nepalese, local
authorities initiated house-to-house searches
for demonstrators. Thev accuse the authorities

of rape, torture, and murder in order to force a
large majority of Nepalese to flee their homes
and cross into India. Some recrossed the bor
ders seeking vengeance against the authorities
responsible for their expulsion, activities which
added fear and urgency to the actions of the
authorities.
Consequently, the national government
cracked down on illegal immigrants. Anyone
who could not present valid documentation of
residence in Bhutan since 1958 was expelled.
By 1994, over 80,000 Nepalese had fled west
and reported themselves as refugees to Nepali
authorities. Thousands others are suspected of
having dispersed into India and other parts of
Nepal. Recently, diplomatic talks between offi
cials from Bhutan and Nepal have attempted to
resolve the issue. Bhutan has agreed to allow
those it identifies as bonafide refugees to return
without censure. But the majority will most
likely never see their homes again.
These facts and figures can be gleaned from
the political literature, with the details and the
finger-pointing changing according to author.
What I didn't read, but realized> when I arrived
at the refugee camps, was how the reality and
politics of the situation varied at different levels.
At the domestic level, the individuals con
tained in large camps in Jhapa, Nepal's south
eastern district bordering India, require large
amounts of aid from international agencies.
The budget allocated by the United Nations
High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) for
those in Jhapa amounts to at least $14 million,
and is much less now than in previous years. As
in other refugee situations, the UNHCR funds
nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to
maintain the camps, run educational programs,
and develop programs for income generation.
Once a camp has been situated, NGO's politi
cally maneuver to maintain or increase their
share of the funding as well as gain favoritism
with UNHCR and the local Nepali authorities
in order to operate efficiently.
One of the greatest dilemmas in refugee
assistance is the need to placate disgruntled
local politicians who feel that the refugees have
access to greater benefits than the locals. In
order to avoid this conflict, much of the inter
national aid from the UNHCR must be chan
nelled to benefit the local communities: and
thus roads are built and the local infrastructure
is strengthened.
Through interviews with local officials, I
discovered that the same politicians who com
plain of the unfair treatment of locals are the
same contractors who are employed to build the
roadways and structures with UNHCR funds.
Thus, while the local people may benefit by
better roads and structures, it is the local elite

who financially benefit the most.
Many other issues complicate the resolution
of the refugees and their plight. Nepal has suf
fered its fourth governmental collapse in the
last four years. With each new government, a
new negotiation team is sent to meet with
Bhutanese officials. Bhutanese officials com
plain that progress can never occur because
talks begin anew with each newly formed dele
gation.
Furthermore, the issue of refugees sits low
on the political agenda of all countries in the
region. The expelled are no longer a problem
for Bhutan. India benefits greatly from a stable
Bhutan and an unstable Nepal; since an unsta
ble Nepal depends heavily on India and pre
vents Chinese economic expansion in the area.
For Nepal, a population of over 80,000 con
tained and independently sustained is negligi
ble to the 14 million Nepali who struggle to
obtain the basic necessities in one of the poor
est nation of the world.
The Nepali government's economic contri
bution to the camps are minimal; most of the
funding originates from the UNHCR. As we
have seen, it has become profitable for Nepal's
local political and economic elite to maintain
the refugees in order to lure financial assistance.
As an issue among political parties, refugees are
less emotionally appealing to the voting public
in comparison to the the illegal trafficking of
Nepali girls to India and the Middle East for
prostitution. Though the refugee situation is
occasionally mentioned in political discussion,
it is mostly employed as a rhetorical criticism of
the government's overall ineptitude.
Furthermore, the Nepali government would
rather not internationalize the issue, favoring
instead to use its opportunities to elevate its sta
tus within the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and under the
South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA),
both of which include Bhutan and India. Thus
it seems no one would gain by resolving this
issue — except of course, the over 80,000 who
have no homes or nation.
In the camps, the residents tire from the
wait. Because of restrictions which prevent
them from competing with local markets or
travelling into the local town, most in the
camps are prohibited from working. Because a
resolution does not appear in the immediate
future many are abandoning the confines of the
camps and are taking their chances at finding
employment in the local community. With an
increasing number of individuals abandoning
camp-life, Bhutan stregnthens its assertions that
these individuals are not bonafide refugees but
rather economic opportunists.
To the frustration of many within the

camps, various leaders live outside the immedi
ate area, with some as far as 18 hours by bus.
Consequently, what has occurred has been a
fractionalization of interests, with over 20-30
different organizations each proclaiming them
selves as the representative for a specific group
within the camps. So many voices clamoring
for leadership make it impossible for an effec
tive united refugee front to develop and conse
quently a return to their homes a much more
distant possibility.
The complexities of the situation have sel
dom been understood by outsiders. The unique
Bhuddist identity of what is today's Bhutan is
endangered by an overwhelming cultural influ
ence from India. For Bhutan, a poor undevel
oped nation, the democratic principles may not
be a practical answer within its social context.
Its history and culture argue strongly against
the adoption of Western-based notions of gov
ernment and human rights. Furthermore, the
violence and corruption in Nepal and India, the
world's largest democracy, do not provide a
convincing argument for such a change. And
amidst the discussion of what was done or what
should be done lies the reality of what is. Over
one hundred thousand people currently live
contained in camps. They have huts for houses,
but those are not their homes.
"The strong do what they can, the weak
suffer as they must," said the ancient historian
Thucydides: the individuals expelled from
Bhutan have consistently been the weaker of
the parties involved. They were forced to flee
their homes because they did not have the polit
ical power to resist. Now they must wait in
camps for their futures to be decided by politi
cians. Both instances might be different if they
had the political leverage necessary to influence
their own destiny.
Yet, these problems are not unique to a sit
uation half the world away. The specific nations
and players involved are the transient details.
There are issues outside that can be addressed
across borders: civil rights, racism, sexual har
rasment, etc. For the most part, we will always
be able to return to a "home" with four walls
which we can call our own. But the improba
bility that such unfortunate situations could
happen to us should not mean that we can
ignore the plight of the homeless, the poverty
stricken or other issues around us. Ignoring it
makes us a part of the problem.
No man is an island entire of itself; every
man is a piece of the continent, a part of the
