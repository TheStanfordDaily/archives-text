Alberto Tovar graduated from Stanford University in 1997.
He currently attends the Refugee Studies Programme at the
Univesity of Oxford in England and earlier this year spent
three months in Nepal researching the geopolitics of the
Himalayan nations regarding refugees in eastern NepaL He
offers here a general discussion on refugees as well as analy
sis of his own research on the expulsion of Nepalese from the
Himalayan nation of Bhutan.

In daily conversation, we take for granted the word home. We use phras
es such as "I'm going home or "It's at home." We know of a "home"
with four walls that we can call our own, a home that will be there
when we go back. Whether it be a dorm room or the home our parents
live in, we have somewhere secure. Rarely do we see beyond the glass windows
to the real worlds that are not our own. In our pursuit of straight As, the mag
icaj 4.0, and the letters of recommendation, we ignore many issues that shape
other realities in this world. Yet there are populations that lack homes and
nations to call their own. Today the global population of refugees numbers
more than 25,000,000.
While homelessness is very serious dilemma common to our society, there
arc few of us who can relate to the plight of refugees. Many of us detest how
homeless people are treated, Local governments often attempt to remove the
"problem," of homelessness from sight with the hopes of then removing it
from our minds and thus eventually from our concern. In attempts to hide
this "problem" local governments regard it as an incurable social ill and seek
to conceal homelessness rather than alleviate it.
In the situations that produce refugees, governments have commited even
further injustices. Rather than pursue a solution, governments thave often

worked towards the elimination of the "problem", that is, the elimination
of the people within the "problem". The Nazi policies of the 1930s and 1940s
Germany remains history's most noted example of such a "final" solution.
Hitlers policies did not develop solutions to its refugee problems, they sought
to eliminate the refugees. Most recently, the ethnic cleansing in the former
Yugoslavia and the Great lakes region of Africa (Burundi and Rwanda) show
that the Third Reich's actions were not an anomaly in history.
These situations have never been considered unique to the 20th century.
For centuries individuals have sought asylum in other countries. Kings, nobles
and elites were consistently accepted into foreign lands as revolutions over
turned their governments. Periods of religious persecution created migration
patterns between the states of Western Europe. The reconqucst of Spain in
1492 sent Muslims fleeing to Africa while the Spanish Inquisition forced
many Jews to either leave their homes or face death. England's oppression ot
Catholics sent many to France. The French Huguenots, English Puritans and
Quakers, are a few of the groups that were the unwanreds of Europe and also
the colonists of present-day United States.
The history of our very own "great nation" has been involved in every
aspect of refugees. It has created them (ask the Native Americans if they want
ed to leave their homes), it has accepted them (Hungarians, Laotians,
Nicaraguans and, among other individuals, Albert Einstein), and it has even
refused them, with the latter serving as one of the greatest marks against the
United States's past. Hundreds of Jews fleeing Germany in the 1930s arrived
by ship on the East Coast, only to be summarily returned to the anti-Semitic
policies in Europe.
The differences between today and centuries past is that today's world has
been for the most pan carved up into nation-states. One can no longer "go
West" to unexplored land and establish new lives. Nations can no longer claim
and develop uninhabited lands. In many places the situation has reversed to
governments seeking to depopulate areas in order to guarantee, if not create,
more room for people of their own "kith and kin." These policies have been
justified by the underlying assertion that a state owes "its people", where the

nation of origin) and Nepali to describe those still living in Nepal.
