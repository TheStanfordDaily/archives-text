## STRESS FRACT URES Re-examining the University Tenure System 
### Chuck Carlson 
Tenure reform. Two words which do not
exactly evoke an immediate sense of
passion and urgency when stacked up
against incendiary issues such as affirmative
action, global warming, the bombing of Iraq or
even global economic restructuring. And yet,
exactly 30 years ago this May, it was one of the
issues which led thousands of students and
young professors to tear up the cobblestones in
Parisian streets and hurl them at police in the
turbulent days of the May 1968 rebellion
against Giscard D'estanges government in
France.
Recent tenure disputes at Stanford have also
galvanized students around the issue of tenure
reform. And though none have yet resorted to
trying to find a suitable substitute for cobble
stones on the Stanford campus, the issue of
tenure reform has been simmering along, dri
ven by the recent denial of tenure to several
popular junior professors â€” most prominently,
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta and U.S.
History Prof. Karen Sawislak. How the rather
esoteric issue of tenure has become a hot issue
at Stanford and across the nation, and how it
impacts the scope of your education are subjects
of this article.
Why should students choose to care about
tenure and the tenure process? Two years ago, as
an incoming graduate student in history, 1
could have cared less. In my qise, as with many
others in other departments, the issue chose
me. With last year's denial of an overwhelming
ly positive history department recommendation
to tenure Sawislak by the Dean of Humanities
and Sciences, I stood to lose both my adviser

and the entire field, U.S. labor history, which
she represents. My first lesson in the urgency of
the tenure issue was that the tenure system not
only determines who will teach you, it can
determine what you will be taught as well.
We have all had professors at Stanford who
have either impassioned and inspired us with
their teaching or writing, or bored us half to
death and frustrated us with their esoterica and

aloofness. Who teaches and advises us, how we
are taught and advised, the quality and rele
vance of the information we receive, and the
freedom to hear and express controversial ideas
during the course of our college education are
all bound up in a tenure system which has
become a fixture in nearly all public and most
private universities throughout the nation.
Before I address these issues and the current
controversies which surround them at Stanford,
Id like to contextualize them by presenting

some historical background on tenure and th
most recent national debate on tenure and th
tenure system.

TO SERVE AND BE PROTECTED:
THE ROOTS OF THE SYSTEM

Tenure is first and foremost a labor system
designed to protect the academic freedom and
job security of professors at post-secondary
institutions. Though it can trace forma] prece
dents back to medieval craft guilds, the modern
tenure system was formally instituted through
the efforts of the American Association of
University Professors, founded in 1913. Their
1915 General Report on Academic Freedom
and Tenure was issued in response to the then
disproportionate power of university presidents
to arbitrarily dismiss professors at whim.
Professors with controversial ideas or approach
es were vulnerable to dismissal on ideological
grounds alone. The 1915 report was the blue
print for formal guidelines on tenure policies
drafted in 1940 which have since been
endorsed by 135 higher education organiza
tions and have become the standard for tenure
policy in the modern university. As articulated
in the 1940 statement, the guidelines were
drafted for two express purposes: "Tenure is a
means to certain ends, specifically: (1) freedom
of teaching and research and of extramural
activities, and (2) a sufficient degree of eco
nomic security to make the profession attractive
to men and women of ability. High-minded
and practical, these two "ends' reflect the ten
sion between "noble purpose" and self-interest.
