## STRESS FRACT URES Re-examining the University Tenure System 
### Chuck Carlson 
Tenure reform. Two words which do not
exactly evoke an immediate sense of
passion and urgency when stacked up
against incendiary issues such as affirmative
action, global warming, the bombing of Iraq or
even global economic restructuring. And yet,
exactly 30 years ago this May, it was one of the
issues which led thousands of students and
young professors to tear up the cobblestones in
Parisian streets and hurl them at police in the
turbulent days of the May 1968 rebellion
against Giscard D'estanges government in
France.
Recent tenure disputes at Stanford have also
galvanized students around the issue of tenure
reform. And though none have yet resorted to
trying to find a suitable substitute for cobble
stones on the Stanford campus, the issue of
tenure reform has been simmering along, dri
ven by the recent denial of tenure to several
popular junior professors — most prominently,
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta and U.S.
History Prof. Karen Sawislak. How the rather
esoteric issue of tenure has become a hot issue
at Stanford and across the nation, and how it
impacts the scope of your education are subjects
of this article.
Why should students choose to care about
tenure and the tenure process? Two years ago, as
an incoming graduate student in history, 1
could have cared less. In my qise, as with many
others in other departments, the issue chose
me. With last year's denial of an overwhelming
ly positive history department recommendation
to tenure Sawislak by the Dean of Humanities
and Sciences, I stood to lose both my adviser

and the entire field, U.S. labor history, which
she represents. My first lesson in the urgency of
the tenure issue was that the tenure system not
only determines who will teach you, it can
determine what you will be taught as well.
We have all had professors at Stanford who
have either impassioned and inspired us with
their teaching or writing, or bored us half to
death and frustrated us with their esoterica and

aloofness. Who teaches and advises us, how we
are taught and advised, the quality and rele
vance of the information we receive, and the
freedom to hear and express controversial ideas
during the course of our college education are
all bound up in a tenure system which has
become a fixture in nearly all public and most
private universities throughout the nation.
Before I address these issues and the current
controversies which surround them at Stanford,
Id like to contextualize them by presenting

some historical background on tenure and th
most recent national debate on tenure and th
tenure system.

TO SERVE AND BE PROTECTED:
THE ROOTS OF THE SYSTEM

Tenure is first and foremost a labor system
designed to protect the academic freedom and
job security of professors at post-secondary
institutions. Though it can trace forma] prece
dents back to medieval craft guilds, the modern
tenure system was formally instituted through
the efforts of the American Association of
University Professors, founded in 1913. Their
1915 General Report on Academic Freedom
and Tenure was issued in response to the then
disproportionate power of university presidents
to arbitrarily dismiss professors at whim.
Professors with controversial ideas or approach
es were vulnerable to dismissal on ideological
grounds alone. The 1915 report was the blue
print for formal guidelines on tenure policies
drafted in 1940 which have since been
endorsed by 135 higher education organiza
tions and have become the standard for tenure
policy in the modern university. As articulated
in the 1940 statement, the guidelines were
drafted for two express purposes: "Tenure is a
means to certain ends, specifically: (1) freedom
of teaching and research and of extramural
activities, and (2) a sufficient degree of eco
nomic security to make the profession attractive
to men and women of ability. High-minded
and practical, these two "ends' reflect the ten
sion between "noble purpose" and self-interest.
which has historically conflicted academic iden
tity in both professors and the university as an
institution. We'll return to this a bit further on.
As a labor historian, I should note that these
principles were accepted by the university as a
standard at a time when a militant national
labor movement was at its peak of power, class
conflict was endemic and, with a rising tide of
white collar unionism, a national union of col
lege professors was perceived as a real possibili
ty. As universities were predominately middle
and upper-class institutions, university admin
istrators did not want their institutions sullied
by the specter of class or conflict — not good
business when it came to soliciting funds from
wealthy alumni.
Once accepted, the tenure system became
sacrosanct; for professors it became the symbol
of academic freedom, professional identity and
job security, for administrators a self-policing
system of departmental quality control and an
assurance that professors would act as self-inter
ested free agents, not as collective workers. The
only apparent problem came from the occa
sional slacker who would use tenure as license
to "coast" in terms of diminished academic pro
duction. Since more than 95 percent of univer
sity professors and students were white, male
and, at least middle-class at the time the tenure
system gained currency, there was very little cul
tural or class discord to disturb institutional
tranquility. All in all, it seemed to be an ideal
solution: a respectable middle-class, profession
al club for white male intellectuals. The univer
sity was then supposed to be an ivory tower;
academics and administrators could afford to
agree to disagree over matters of ideology and
politics, as long as it was civil and nobody lost
their job over it. Fairly quickly, however, the
system showed signs of stress.

FREEDOM UNDER ATTACK:
TENURE AND THE COLD WAR

At the end of World War 11, the humanities
and social sciences operated on the assumption
that the production of knowledge was, when
undertaken correctly, value neutral and free
from personal and political bias. Historians, for
instance, worked within an ethic which
assumed facts could be absoutely determined
and could speak for themselves; the historian
was a vessel through which facts could be dis
covered and interpreted in an objective analyti
cal process. He (and he was nearly always a he)
was supposed to be able to separate his person
al politics from scholarly interpretation in the
quest for determining historical truth. The divi
sion of the world in ideologically opposed com
munist and capitalist blocs began to erode that

ideal.
As the Cold War was taking shape in 1949
the prominent Japanese historian, Edwin O.
Reischauer, spoke out in favor of mounting an
ideological attack against communism in Asia
from within the community of U.S. scholars.
He challenged American academics to rise (or
sink) to the occasion: "If we exploit the special
prestige of the scholar, the intellectual group in
that area, it would seem to me that propaganda
work, information aimed primarily at them
[Asians] would be the most effective kind of
information work. It might be advisable to try
to put American professors in every university
[in Asia] to the extent that the universities can
absorb them." If Reischauer's call for action had
only been a personal political expression, it
would have come under the aegis of academic
freedom under the tenure system. Reischauer's

statement, however, was accompanied by a con
gressional assault on left scholars in East Asian
Studies — an attempt by conservative congress
men and academics to purge the academy of left
influences and re-orient it to a political Cold
War agenda.
In 1951, the Senate Judiciary Committee,
conducting what can only be termed an ideo
logical soul mate to the McCarthy hearings,
began its witch hunt of left-oriented Asian his
torians and social scientists, the most dramatic
result being the suicide of Japanese historian
E.H. Norman after his blacklisting by several
prominent U.S. universities. The hearings, like
the McCarthy hearings, were replete with the
spectacle of American professors denouncing
communism and testifying on the communist
tendencies of their peers. For more than 20
years after the hearings, scholarship on East

Asia was colored by the pro-West, anti-commu
nist bent of modernization theory and "area
studies," sponsored in part by the Central
Intelligence Agency, which utilized the univer
sity as a conservative policy think tank.
When the political axe came down, the
Senate Judiciary hearings showed that the
tenure system could neither insulate the univer
sity from pressures and issues in the larger soci
ety nor could it protect professors absolutely in
terms of free expression. The Cold War ideo
logical assault on academic freedom paradoxi
cally both tamed academic expression and
cemented the rhetoric of academic freedom
from social pressures in the ideology of tenured
academics. Normans banishment from the
American academy was but one glaring example
of the susceptibility of the tenure system to the
political biases of dominant schools of acade
mics. The purge of the left brought a temporary
tranquility rooted in political homogeneity to
the university in the late 19505, but the mold
ing of a Cold War consensus with fundamental
ideological and political purposes opened the
door to challenges to the system on political
grounds in the following decade.

DIVERSITY AND ADVERSITY:
MODERN ASSAULTS ON TENURE

With the bitter memories of the political
and social encroachment of the Cold War fresh
in mind, tenured professors and administrators
faced new social pressures in the 1960s — this
time from the left. The eruption of Vietnam
war protests in the university in the late 19605,
accompanied by wildcat teach-ins and occupa
tions of administrative offices, set off a new
series of debates on the role of the university in
society and of the academic in the university
setting. What evolved was a generational split
between students and largely young, untenured
professors (with a few tenured, left Cold War
survivors) and a generation of scholars tenured
during the stifling years of the Cold War.
Arising concurrently with the tide of anti
war protests was a trend among young scholars
to embrace a social and cultural history model
we now call "history from below," or the histo
ry of disenfranchised groups and their political
and economic struggles. Calls for the institu
tion of labor history, women's history, African-
American history, and the histories of other
people of color were closely identified with the
anti-war, civil rights and feminist movements of
the era. Under intense political pressure, and as
the premier institution of liberal, democratic
values in America, the university slowly acceded
to the demands of students and instituted pro
grams in these areas. With the institution of
such programs came demands that more
women and people of color be hired and
tenured to write and teach in these emerging
fields.
The effect on tenure of the new programs
in social history cascaded. First, the demo
graphics of the university began to change.
More women and people of color were hired in
response to the call for new scholarship, and to
adjust for an influx of minority and women stu
dents into the university. Second, academic
approaches to history and the social sciences
underwent dramatic changes as the new subject
fields demanded new analytical models and the
ories.
Neither the dominant "consensus"
approach to history — that is the idea that all
American history has been a process of synthe
sizing diverse interests into a peculiarly
American liberal, democratic consensus, nor
alternative Marxist approaches, based on the
idea that history is driven by an inevitable clash
of identifiable economic interests between class
es, could effectively address the forces of race
and gender in American history and society.
Innovative scholarship in these fields was often
identified with young women and minority
professors hired to fulfill the university's new
commitments to diversifying both the demo
graphics and the academics of the institution.
The problem many of these young profes
sors experienced was that their scholarship was
not being favorably reviewed by either the con
servative or left scholars of the preceding (and
tenured) generation. Hiring, consequently, was
not translating in tenure, and the core of
tenured professors throughout the nation
remained overwhelmingly white and male — a
holdover from university of the 19505.
The expanding diversity of both professors
and students in the 19605, in conjunction with
student revolts during the Vietnam war further
eroded the borders between the university and
society, and brought the tenure system under
direct attack from left academics, women and
people of color. Similar to the erosive effects of
the left's assault on government in the late
1960s and 19705, the fundamental questioning
of the university's integrity opened the door for
a subsequent (and ongoing) assault by the right
on the "left-liberal" orientation of academic
departments in the humanities and social sci
ences in the 1980s. Since the mid-19605, the
university in America has been unable to free
itself of the ideological and social struggles of
society at large; one might propose that it was
never free of these social pressure — never an
ideologically neutral ground on which the con
cept of "academic freedom" could operate
unhindered by political bias.

In recent years, tenure has come under
attack from all sides. Administrations at several
prominent universities, reflecting the current
vogue that universities should be run more like
businesses, have been rethinking the policy of
tenure on grounds of "corporate" efficiency:
"why take the risk of giving lifetime job securi
ty to a professor who may or may not produce
prize-winning, and thus revenue-generating
work. The University of Minnesota has recent
ly taken steps to abolish the tenure system
entirely, sending shock waves through the
national academic community.
The inherent racial and gender bias of a sys
tem which preserves the positions of white
males who gained their job security in an era
when the university was nearly all white and
male has brought repeated challenges to the sys
tems ability to implement its relatively recent
commitment to racial and gender diversity.

New social theories, such as poststructuralism
and postmodernism, have called into question
the intellectual foundation and universal pre
cepts of systems of knowledge, in turn calling
into questions whether professors and adminis
trators can judge the value of untraditional
scholarship in an unbiased and even-handed
manner. What happens to academic freedom
when the validity and integrity of the produc
tion of knowledge itself comes under attack? In
short, the tenure system is beginning to resem
ble a 40-year-old punch-drunk boxer facing a
title bout against, not one, but four or five
aggressive challengers.

BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME
(WELL, MOST OF IT ...)

So what does all this history have to do with
current tenure struggles at Stanford and with
you as a student and consumer of the
University's services? I've provided a brief (and
necessarily crude) sketch of the history of
tenure to emphasize two points and bring up a
number of questions. The first point is simply

that neither the concept nor the shape of tenure
is sacrosanct. The reasons why we have a tenure
system and why we have the system as it stands
now are historically constructed and interpret
ed. The second is that, as such, we have both a
right and an obligation as consumers to ques
tion the efficiency of the system in delivering
the kind of education which the University has
promised to deliver.
The first questions which come to mind in
mulling over the turbulent history surrounding
tenure are: has tenure fulfilled its missions, as
stated in the 1940 report, and can it continue
to fulfill its promise of academic freedom in an
increasingly diverse and contentious university
setting? In two significant ways, tenure has ful
filled it's prime mission: it has attracted many
talented young men (and some women) to aca
demic careers with its promise of lifetime job
security and it has done a credible job of pro-

tecting academic freedom for rhose who have
achieved tenure. There are, however, fatal flaws
in the system on both ends.
First, as the system stood in the not-so-dis
tant past, when University professors were near
ly ail white and all male, job security and the
decisions on who to tenure and why have
devolved to white males who were trained and
who, for the most part operated within a more
traditional concept of universalist, enlighten
ment ideals. That is, the belief that a universal
standards of ethics, morality and justice can be
identified and implemented through the power
of reason, and that human history has general
ly been a progressive march towards these ends.
I would include in this universalist tradition
oppositional theories such as Marxism.
Though it's dangerous to generalize hard
and fast lines between traditional and opposi
tional theories, poststructuralism, postmod
ernism and many types of interdisciplinary
inquiries challenge both the existence of one
universally applicable standard of human ethics
and the idea that history is progressive.
Reflecting the emphasis on the struggles of the
disenfranchised, the emphasis is on conflict
rather than consensus.
As the superheated conflicts of the early
Cold War gave way to cooling-off period in the
early 19605, a more gentlemanly atmosphere re
asserted itself in academia. Ideological and
scholarly conflicts persisted, but generally were
carried out within the bounds of scholarly eti
quette to avoid the unseemly bloodletting of
the early 19505. Many of those who hold the
power to grant or deny tenure today, particular
ly at universities like Harvard or Yale which
rarely grant tenure, are first or second genera
tion products of that era. The attacks on the
tenure system since the mid-1960s both call
into question the openness of what many per
ceive to be a white gentleman's club, and also
challenge many of the universalist ideals which
underlay that generation's scholarship. When
you hear challenges to tenure at Stanford based
on the ability of these men to fairly asses "inno
vative scholarship," this is the core of the prob
lem as cited.
Does this "old guard" harbor conscious or
unconscious biases to relatively new social the
ories such as poststructuralism, postmod
ernism, or other types of less easily categorized
interdisciplinary work which not only challenge
everything they hold dear, but have also been
seized upon by feminist and minority scholars
as methods of exploring patriarchal and racial
hierarchies? In the face of the "new" social the
ory, I have seen even Marxist scholars react with
conservative vitriol to poststructuralist and
postmodernist methods of analysis. For young
feminist or minority scholars on the tenure
track engaged in such work, academic freedom
is far from a secure promise.
The fact is, under the current system, only
tenured professors are assured academic free
dom. When those who will judge you for
tenure are the same people whose work you are
bringing into question, how much freedom do
you have? It's a bit like petitioning your boss for
a promotion and including a critique which
challenges the very core of his management
technique. The linking of academic freedom to
job security is both a carrot and a stick.
A second problem, one recently prominent
in student complaints in the Gupta and
Sawislak cases at Stanford, is the charge of a
possible double standard in the University's
commitment to diversity — an affirmative
action stance in hiring and a "purely merito
cratic" standard for tenure. The above discus
sion explored the challenges which are posed to
the implementation of a meritocratic standard;
the demographics of tenure at elite institutions
like Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Stanford
which remain about 85 percent male and white
after 25 years of conceptually embracing diver

sity, bring into question whether it can.
A third force which has brought its own
challenges to tenure has been the national
restructuring of the university to embrace the
values of corporate efficiency and commensu
rately shift the university's emphasis to math,
engineering and the sciences to meet the chal
lenges of the American competition in the glob
al economy. This has fostered more activist
administrations across the country.
Corporations have historically enjoyed a close
informal relationship with universities through
out the 20th century. Universities, however —
particularly ones like Stanford and MIT, played
a more direct role in fostering the advancement
of electronics as both a science and industry.
Consequently, as electronics have become
the new engine of industrial development, the
relationship between the university and the cor
porate world has become institutionalized. The
result has been an economic and ideological re
orientation of university values toward the sci
ences and away from liberal arts at the same
time as the mandate for diversity has drawn
many women and minorities into shrinking lib
eral arts fields. The intervention of administra
tions into tenure decisions by humanities and
social science departments may well reflect the
new priorities of the university to emphasize
scientific and engineering fields at the expense
of traditional liberal arts programs.

BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME
(THE REST OF IT)

In the last two years, each of these problems
with the tenure system, as it has historically
evolved, has been manifested in bitter disputes
within departments and between departments
and students and the administration at
Stanford. Foremost on students' minds have
been the place of teaching and advising in the
tenure process, a subject I've barely touched and
yet one which is insidiously submerged in the
history and issues I've just addressed. We gener
ally enjoy a high standard of teaching at
Stanford — at least in my department, the
humanities — but advising and the availability
of diverse fields of studies to meet the diverse
interests of an increasingly demographically
diverse student body have not kept pace. I have
not discussed the role of teaching and advising
in tenure because, frankly, these are the impov
erished stepchildren of tenure decisions. They
are simply not given much weight next to acad
emic production in major research institutions
like Stanford. Still, you have to be at least a
marginally competent teacher to receive tenure
at Stanford.
The consequences of this ordering of prior

ities on students can, does, and will continue to
lead to conflicts over tenure denials. However,
as our contact with professors is not generally as
scholars as much as it is as teachers and advis
ers. One of the points of giving the history of
tenure and tenure conflicts, however, has been
to emphasize that it is not simply who teaches
us, but what we are taught which is at stake
here. When a Karen Sawislak or an Akhil Gupta
is denied tenure, their fields may disappear with
them; U.S. labor history or studies in gender or
political economy in South Asia completely
drop out of the curriculum or are parceled out
to marginal discussions in other classes. In this
case, it is our academic freedom, our opportu
nity to receive a full spectrum of subjects
through which to learn about the world, which
is diminished in the process.
There are no easy answers to the tenure issue.
Scholars do need some kind of assurance that
they can pursue controversial subjects and come
to controversial conclusions without reprisal.
The academy, in nonprofessional departments at
least, cannot compete with salaries offered in the
private sector, and needs some means of entice
ment to attract the top minds of upcoming gen
erations; the job security of tenure is such an
enticement. But as society continues to struggle
with the issue of how to rectify systems and insti
tutions which have historically discriminated
against particular groups, and as diversity is like
ly to persist in some form as a value in this
diverse society, we do need to re-assess how to
evaluate merit in academic work and what acad
emic subjects are pertinent to succeeding gener
ations of students. This suppposedly non-biased
system has been shaped by, and is embedded in
the larger political and social struggles of bygone
eras. It has responded to calls for change only in
small increments, and only under intense politi
cal pressure.
Can it adapt to future social changes with
out fundamental reflection and revision? What
was designed to protect free thought and
expression from tyrannical university presidents
could not protect against the anti-communist
zealotry of the 1950s or the waves of social
protest of the 1960s and 19705. Can it now
accommodate a new wave of demands for
diversity in the nineties? Or has the tenure sys
tem been reduced to merely protecting the sys
tem itself? If this is the case, the largest group of
victims of an intransigent tenure system may be
you and I, and those students who follow us
into the University.
