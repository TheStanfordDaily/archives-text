## The
						Night Question 
### Tobias Wolff Alfred A. Knopf, 206 p. Review by Patricia Soung 
A couple files a complaint that a gross
error appeared in the morning paper.
The simple explanation that Mr.
Givens is well and alive, despite what his obit
uary may suggest, touches off an episode of
awkward explanations and ruminations. What?
An obituary for a thriving man? How could
such a mistake be overlooked?
The 15 stories in Tobias WolfFs recent col
lection, "The Night in Question," are likely to
incite reactions of curious confusion. Wolff
masters the telling of the unexpected, using
familiar situations to examine the unconven
tional.
In one story, a soldier tries to muster an
irresistible fit of laughter in response to news of
his mothers death. The character in another
story ferociously sinks his teeth into the ears of
a dog. And in yet another, a virtually bankrupt
mother and son shop for housing they obvi
ously cannot afford.
Despite creating an impression of seeming
nonsense, Wolff manages to make sense of
absurdity. His characters are not iconoclasts
who intentionally break the accepted norms of
human behavior and actions. Instead, as they
lead the reader through their thought process
es, what is perceived as extraordinary or pecu
liar gives way to logic and sense.
Wolff has a talent for drawing the reader
into the moral and ethical atmosphere of a
character. Even though the reader is dismayed
by the tacdess misdemeanors of a respectable
high school teacher, he empathizes with the
characters mixed emotions.
And though the reader is saddened by
a boys silent resentment of his father, the
grounds on which those feelings had been built
can be understood. The reader may even expe
rience a splitting headache alongside a charac

ter in "Migraine."
In successfully guiding the reader through
the minds of the characters, Wolff also achieves
an impressive examination of human thought
and action. Wolff explains, "Choice is the
engine that drives stories." Every character is
confronted by a situation, constraining them
to consider their loyalties and priorities, their
secret passions and desires. Without choices,
people lead a passive existence.
Wolff argues against a pessimistic view of
the world. He believes that "our wills have an
effect." In these stories, choices arise when the
sense of responsibility to the community and
to the self conflict. In the story after which the
collection is named, a father finds himself in
such a predicament. He must choose between
saving his son or a trainload of strangers.
Though the reader may not fully comprehend
the ultimate decisions, the significance of each
choice is that the character does not surrender
to hopelessness. In the process of decision
making, a character actively carves his individ
uality and self-identity.
Wolff himself attempted this process of
self-discovery when he wrote his memoir,
"This Boy's Life." Acclaimed as a modern clas
sic, the book explores his childhood growing
up in a disgruntled family. Another autobio
graphical work by Wolff, "In Pharoahs Army,"
details his army years in Vietnam as a para
trooper and combatant. Several stories in"The
Night in Question" seem grounded in these life
experiences.
Wolff has had a prolonged affiliation with
Stanford, starting in 1975 as a StegnEr Fellow
teaching creative writing. From 1976-78, he
was a Jones lecturer, and this past fall quarter,
Wolff joined Stanford as a professor in the
English and Creative Writing Department.

Wolff described all of the writers he
respects and admires as "exciting you with
love," invigorating and inspiring a pursuit for
creative expression. A definite trace of
Hemingways sparing sentences appears in
"The Night in Question," though Wolff's style
is minimal only in that nothing superfluous
clutters his phrases and metaphors.
One of Wolff's characters debates, "No,
he'd have to noodle up some righteous, high
sounding reasons for choosing her. And maybe
he wouldn't, at first, maybe he'd chicken out
and come up with the Bible-school answer."
Wolff's prose is clear, poignant, and suggestive
of more than is simply written. Without
explicitly describing their emotional state,
Wolff allows the reader to interpret characters
through their thoughts and actions.
"The Night in Question" is also versatile
and varied in style and pace. Much of Wolff's
prose is dominated by sentences which mean
der in the protracted thoughts of characters as
in "T he Life of the Body," in which a character
reflects, "Well, the body had a mind of its own.
He told it like that, like his body had abducted
him for its own low purposes, like he'd been
lashed to the back of a foaming runaway horse
hell-bent on dragging him through every
degradation."
Other sentences profess the mastery of curt
fragments. In "Lady's Dream," Wolff writes,
"Considerate. Everything a matter of principle.
Justice for all, yellow, brown, black or white,
they are precious in his sight. Asks her ques
tions about his own self. ... Is calm in every
circumstance. Polishes his glasses all the time.
They gleam so you can hardly see his eyes ..."
In some stories, however, Wolff exhausts this
style. The reader finds himself short of breath,
trying to catch up with the running phrases.
Wolff's insertion of comical sarcasm was
particularly enoyable â€” it was refreshing, but
not intrusive. The obituary writer in one story
first dismisses the possibility of someone sub
mitting phony death notices for amusement,
but then "saw that this was foolish of me, and
showed a radical failure of appreciation for the
varieties of human pleasure. "
As a collection, "The Night in Question" is
innovative and powerful in conjuring images
and snapshots of key moments in people's lives.
Each story is distinct.
Wolff explains that though you imagine
the characters separate and unique, they pass
each other on the street, inhabit and share a
common world and confront similar moral
concerns. These stories are almost surprising in
their honest representation of ordinary people.
