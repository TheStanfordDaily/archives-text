## AESTHETICS AND THE MODERN READER osca Wilder 
### Tanvir Rahman 
no one since Shakespeare has
as frequently as Oscar Wilde.
Even m*mgh academia has recently
been dismissiveofnH4i^ rra y gravity, Wilde's
exceeding wit and still
anchor him solidly within the canoTr»££jielish
literature. Overshadowing Oscar Wilde's liter
ary reputation even more has been the atten
tion paid to his personal life. Accused and
eventually destroyed for his alleged homosexu
al relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas,
Wilde has been unfairly elevated as a symbol of
youthful rebellion against conventional moral
ity. To understand Wilde in this aspect is unsat
isfactory, since Wilde was concerned with,
above all, aesthetics.
Wilde conceived of himself foremost as an
artist. Yet as an artist, he tragically noted, in his
The Picture of Dorian Gray ", the impossibil
ity of leading an aesthetic life. Wilde's "Preface
to Dorian Gray" is of particular interest to
today's reader, since it champions a philosophy
that is opposed to the tendency of modern
academia and the general attitude of literary
critics. Wilde's "Preface" is an impassioned
argument for the evaluation of literature pri
marily through its aesthetic merit. Any casual
understanding of modern criticism suggests
that Oscar Wilde would have considered con
temporary literary discourse as destructive to
literature and contrary to the purpose of art
being "for art's sake."
Today, literature is no longer critically
received as an art form, such as music or sculp
ture or painting, but is radically misread and
misappropriated under the piercing lens of var
ious forms of social perspectivism. The princi

pal culprits of this include feminists, lacanians,
new-historicists, Marxists, semioticians and the
various strains of multiculturalists. Subjecting
literature to these critical perspectives has both
the implicit and explicit aftertaste of reducing
rich and complex works of art into narrowly
■dpfgrminfvl categories. I itrnmri; rhrrT
becomes a product or social, political and eco
nomic energies, and thus devalues its supreme
function as an art. Oscar Wilde advised against
the degradation of literature by removing it out
of its original state as an art form. Yet today the
proponents of the aesthetic in literature have
become a minority in modern academia.
Wilde offers the supreme criterion for both
the artist and the critic: how well does the artist
create beautiful things, and how well can the
critic extract beautiful meanings from the artis
tic creation itself? The term "beautiful" is not
confined to its common application, but
includes within its realms realistic portrayals of
ordinary and low life. Art as beauty is then per
haps best understood as capturing the funda
mental representation of nature. According to
Wilde, his means are thought and language.
Beautiful use of thought and language to rep
resent nature is literature's supreme goal. For
the author, the criterion for his writing must be
concerned with how perfectly he can express
his intended creation. Wilde also explains that
the artist should be concerned with revealing
art and not himself. The artist must somehow
transcend his self and be above the forces (his
torical, sociopolitical, economic) that formu
late his life experience. New Historicism and
its proponents (Foucault, Rarthes) who come
close to claiming that the artist is insignificant
— or merely a vehicle of the social energies of

his time— are clear antagonists tojfe aestheti
cian's sacred creed, which maynave been best
expressed by Stephen who sought to
"forge the of [his] race."
After all, it — not the social energies
ofmtwtJfthe century Ireland — who wrote
of the Artist as a Young Man." If the
creation can transcend the artist, his collective,
and his times, it achieves an element of univer
sality and marks its status as a great or classical
work.
Wilde's "Preface" is concerned with the
place of morality in art, and appropriately so,
since aesthetic philosophy has been traditional
ly pitted against, or at least said to be indiffer
ent to moral considerations. Wilde writes,
"There is no such thing as a moral or an
immoral book. Books are well written, or badly
written." Works of literature are not fruitfully
read if the intention is to extract a system of
morals or values.
Yale Prof. Harold Bloom notes, "The
'Iliad' teaches the surpassing glory of armed
victory, while Dante rejoices in the eternal tor
ments he visits upon his very personal enemies
. . . Dostoevskv preaches anti-Semitism,
obscurantism, and the necessity of human
bondage . . . Spenser rejoices in the massacre
of Irish rebels, while rhe egomania of
Wordsworth exalts his own poetic mind over
any other source of splendor." Great literature
often proposes values opposite to those of our
most deeply held assumptions, as Nietzsche
certainly does in "Thus Spoke Zarathustra."
Because no artist should have "ethical sympa
thies," it is aesthetically problematic when dif
ferent modern critical theories rape literature
to support its own personal and moral outlook.
