Depression? But everyone's
happy at Stanford, right? Ask se
nior Katie Williams this, and the
response will be a resounding.
"No."
Diagnosed with depression her
freshman year. Williams had to
take medication, but she stopped
her junior year.
It was then that she reali/cd that
Stanford's resources tor informa
tion and support for depression
were nonexistent
Williams is not alone in dealing
with depression. Estimates project
that about 10 to 15 percent of the
Stanford community is suffering
with some varying degree of the
mental illness
To remedy the situation, the
Bridge will be offering a new pro

gram titled "Depression? But
everyone's happy at Stanford,
right?" 1 he program was initiated
b\ Williams and Bridge members
Adrienne \S att and Amori Mikami
and resulted from their personal
interest in the illness
Part information session and
part panel discussion, the new pnv
gram is aimed at educating the
Stanford community about depres
sion. possible treatments and cam*
pus resources.
"There is a social norm at Stan
lord that it isn't okay to publicly
express unhappiness or stressj*
said Mikami, a coterminal student
in psychology whose interest lies it*
adolescent depression.
I'he hope is that the panel, com
prised entirely of Stanford stu
dents, will add a face to the disease.
Hv having the students share their
experiences, they hope the taboo
associated with depression will dis
appear.
" The panel brings depression
from an intellectual thine to the

context of real life at Stanford,"
said Watt, a junior.
Williams gathered the panel by
sending what she describes as
"massive amounts" of e-mail.
According to her. 15 people re
sponded to her e-mail within the
first day, showing how common de
pression is on campus.
While there is a wide spectrum
of symptoms, depression is a dis

ease that interferes with daily func
tions for a significant amount of
time.
The program will focus on the
symptoms that typically affect the
Stanford community.
One example is the inability to
concentrate . which may result in a
cycle of academic failure and drug
abuse.
The goal in educating the Stan

ford community is to increase dia
logue on the issue and to help peo
ple become better acquainted with
other sufferers of depression.
In many cases, non-affected
friends don't understand the disor
der or know how to help.
"We want people to be able to
recognize and react to [depression]
in themselves and to help their
friends," Watt said.
