# Nygaard, Folkl injured
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
When the fifth-ranked Stanford women's basket
ball team (21-5) takes the court against Harvard Sat
urday in the first round of the NCAA tournament, it
will definitely be without the services of senior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard. But after yesterday's practice
it could be without senior forward Kristin Folkl as
well.
Folkl, the team's leading scorer and rebounder,
went down with an injury to her left knee at practice
yesterday. She was scheduled for an MRI scan last
night to determine the extent of the injury.
"I don't know the results yet." Folkl said, "but I feci
optimistic. I feel pretty good and hope things work
out."
As for Nygaard, an MRI performed Sunday re
vealed a fully torn anterior cruciate ligament in her left

knee. Nygaard was fitted for a knee
brace yesterday and said she will play
in the tournament.
Nygaard is not likely to play in
Stanford's first-round game against
Harvard this Saturday but could po-

tentially play Monday in the second round. She will
definitely play in the regionals March 21-23 if Stanford
advances that far.
"I have the opportunity to play and contribute to
the team." Nygaard said. "I can't pass that up. I'll do
what I can for this team here and now. I feel very for
tunate that I have the chance to play again. Someone
like [Connecticut's] Nykesha [Sales] doesn't even get
that chance. 1 get to roll the dice and try to play."
Nygaard suffered the injury in the Cardinal's sea
son finale March 8 against Oregon State in Corvallis.


Nygaard
No pain and very little swelling
were taken as positive signs, and it
was originally thought that
Nygaard's injury was not to her
ACL.

But the MRI results showed dif
ferently. and Nygaard will have
surgery on the knee to repair the
damage at the end of the season.
"We are obviously disappointed
that Vanessa won't be 100 per
cent." VanDerveer said. "And if
heart has anything to do with it.
she'll be OK."

Not only is Nygaard the team's
third-leading scorer and rcbound
er. hut she is also the Pacific 10
Conference's all-time leader in
three-point field goals made and an
all-conference selection.
A fifth-year senior and a co-cap
tain of the squad. Nygaard is also
one of the emotional leaders of the

team.
"Something like this goes
through you," VanDerveer said.
"With someone like Vanessa you
invest emotionally, and it hurts a
lot.
"I was upset post-game as was
the team. I feel like I've been on an
emotional roller coaster."
