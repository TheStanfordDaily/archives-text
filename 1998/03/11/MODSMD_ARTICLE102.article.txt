# Refusing to live in the shadows of the Knight
## Lee makes powerful point with play, leadership 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
He's been under the microscope
the from day one.
Junior point guard Arthur Lee
stepped into his starting role this
year as the team's biggest question
mark. In its place, he's left an excla
mation point.
After the Cardinal made a fan
tastic run into the Sweet Sixteen
last year, they had to face losing
All-America point guard Brevin
Knight to graduation and the NBA.
When this season began, every
one figured that the Cardinal
frontcourt would take all the atten
tion because it was so deep. The
only time anyone ever mentioned
the backcourt was to remind the
Cardinal how much it would miss
Knight.
"It got on my nerves a little bit,"
Lee said. "Actually, quite a bit after
a while. We were 20 games into the
season, and people were still asking
questions about Brevin. I mean
what can you do? Right now
they're dying off, but it was a little
bit later than I expected."
The Los Angeles native has not

only taken over the reins success
fully, but he's become the stabiliz
ing factor on a team that can play
passionately one minute and pas
sively the next.
When the Cardinal had found it
self only one point ahead of UCLA
after squandering an IX-point half
time lead in January at Maples
Pavilion, it was Lee who pulled up
for back-to-back three-pointers to
curb the Bruin rally.
Lee once again stepped up huge
for the Cardinal when it traveled to
play California. Stanford was be
hind the Bears late, and Lee pulled
up for another three-pointer, drew
a foul and completed a vital four
point play.
"Sometimes when 1 feel that we
need to get it done, and when I feel
like I can do it, then I just do it,"
Lee said. "It's just about opportuni
ties and cashing in on those oppor
tunities and making the best of
everything that you can."
And Lee has taken advantage of
every opportunity. His play has
stepped up with each passing game,
and he led the team in scoring
through conference plav with 15.1
points per game.

He also capitalized on the Cardi
nal's all-around depth by handing
out 4.4 assists per game, and on
three different occasions he was
able to reach double digits in dishes.
The change at point has resulted
in a player who doesn't gather the
same attention that Knight did but
is every bit as valuable, and that's
just fine with Lee.
He's not the same type of floor
leader that Knight was. He's not
very vocal on the floor unless he
feels he has to be.
"It took a little while, but after
we started winning games and we
got on the streak, that's when I be
came very comfortable." Lee said.
" That's when I became willing to
take the role of the leader, so to
speak, in terms of going out and
playing. I try to lead by example
pretty much.
"We knew that it was going to be
a team effort this year. We knew
that we lost a great player in
Brevin. and we knew that we had to
come out and do it as a unit, (iuys
responded to the call. Everybody's
done a great job."

Junior point guard Arthur Lee quickly silenced questions about
whether he would be able to fill the void left by All-American Brevin
Knight. His performances at Cal and against UCLA gave the Cardinal
a much-needed lift in big games.
