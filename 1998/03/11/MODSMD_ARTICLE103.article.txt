# Seeding sets high hopes for Cardinal
## Cardinal in position to advance deep into tournament play 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
Mike Montgomery couldn't have picked
a better draw himself.
When the NCAA tournament selection
committee announced the brackets for
March Madness on Sunday, the men's head
basketball coach had to be pleased.
Not only will the No. 11 Cardinal (26-4,
15-3 Pacific lOConference) not have to trav
el to the East Coast, but it also avoids the
likes of any team with the quickness and ath
leticism of Arizona or Connecticut, two
squads that thoroughly manhandled Stan
ford this year.
And as far as worrying about his team not
being prepared for its first-round match
goes, that's even less of a problem.
The Cardinal earned a No. 3 seed in the
Midwest and drew Trans America Athlet
ic Conference champion College of
Charleston, a squad that Stanford is very
familiar with, for Friday's first-round
game.
Last season, the Cougars upset the Cardi
nal in the semifinals of the Great Alaska
Shootout, a loss that cost it a championship
game showdown with then-defending cham
pion Kentucky.
"I guess the first sign of relief was when
we saw we weren't going east," Mont
gomery said. "We've got a Friday/Sundav

bracket which gives us a little time to get pre
pared.
"I think there was a little hit of apprehen
sion with [Charleston] having heat us last
year. Sometimes there is a misunderstand
ing that because you're seeded high it gives
you a movement through. I think there was
some understanding that hey. they've got a
good basketball program."
Hut this year Charleston can't expect to
sneak up that easily on the Cardinal.
The Cougars (24-5) aren't the same team
that lost to eventual champion Arizona by
only four points in last year's second round.
John Kresse's squad lost four starters and
has a front line that pales in comparison to
Stanford's.
Shooting guard Jcrmel President is the
lone returning starter for Charleston, and
the junior hasn't been quite the offensive
weapon he was expected to be with only 10.4
points per game.
The Cougars primary option is forward
center Sedric Webber, who leads the team in
both scoring and rebounding with 15.2
points and S. I boards per game.
The problem is that Webber stands at
only 6-fix>t-6 and will most have to go up
against either 6-8,235-pound power forward
Mark Madsen or 7-1. 24<)-pound center Tim
Young.
Because Charleston's tallest player
stands at 6-8 (Stanford has five active play

ers who are at least as tall), if the Cougars
want to give the Cardinal a real run. they will
have to try and play the type of up-tempo
game Arizona and Connecticut used this
year.
The Cardinal could face much heftier
competition in the second round Sunday,
where it would face the winner of the C'lem
son-Western Michigan game.
[Tie Tigers (IK-13) had a disappointing
year when compared to the expectations
that were placed on them at the beginning of
the season, but they are the type of team that
could give the Cardinal fits.
The Tigers, who received one of the 34 at
large bids for the tournament, have also had
to deal with the likes of Duke and North
Carolina in Atlantic Coast Conference play.
so their relatively weaker record should be
taken with a grain of salt.
Clemson is led by forward Greg Buckner.
a candidate for the John Wooden Player of
the Year Award who averages 16.2 points
per game. Hie Tigers also have a strong
point in Terrell Mclntyre who contributes
14.0 points and 4.b assists per game.
Forward Harold Jamison contributes on
the inside with a team-high 7.1 rebounds a
game, and he helps his team offensively with
10 points and four offensive boards a game.
Western Michigan was in\ ited to the Big

Reserve center Mark Seaton has helped anchor a
deep Stanford bench that will play a crucial role for
the Cardinal in tournament play. The Cardinal
backups saw extensive play in this 99-62 blowout
of USC.
