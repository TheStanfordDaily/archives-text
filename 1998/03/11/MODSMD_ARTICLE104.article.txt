# Young the man in the middle
## Cardinal center has provided inside presence for team, given foes fits with overwhelming defense and board play 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Tim Young says the NCAA tournament is
like the start of a new season.
He only hopes his back will agree.
It's almost 45 minutes after Thursday's
game against Oregon and the rest of the
Stanford team is chatting or watching Ari
zona lose on a last-second three-point
prayer to Southern California. Young is
nowhere to be found.
"Yeah, 1 just heard. USC won," he says,
emerging from the door leading to the train
ing room where he has been doing every
thing possible to ensure his back will give
him the least pain possible for the next
game.
Young, who has not been the consistent
go-to guy but has come through in the clutch
when he was needed, will definitely be need
ed if Stanford wants to advance to the later
rounds of the Big Dance.
But countless practices, exercises and
games have taken their toll on Young's back,
and he hopes his body is as up to playing as
his mind and heart are.
"I had a really tough summer," he said. "I
had my ups and downs during the season. It's
been a big adjustment."
Young's spasms caused him to rcdshirt his
sophomore year. Academically in his fourth
year, he will be back for one more year in the
cardinal and white next season.
But if there's one thing Young knows the
least about, it's his future. For now, he's con
centrating on the tournament — more im
portantly, Friday's game against the College

of Charleston.
Last year, when the Cardinal lost to the
Cougars in Alaska, Young scored 22 points
and grabbed nine boards. His 31 -point per
formance last season against Seton Hall
showed his ability to dominate inside.
"I just want to be a presence inside. The
tourney is guard oriented."
And Young has been more than enough of
a presence on several occasions.
At Washington last month. Young won
the battle of the 7-footers as he effectively
made a nonentity out of Washington's Todd
MacCulloch, who many would consider to
be the Pacific 10 Conference's top center.

'We really want to get past the
Sweet Sixteen. It's realistic if we
get our heads together'
— Tim Young

His performance ended up being huge, as
the Cardinal escaped with a buzzer-beating
win.
When the team faced UCLA in Maples
Pavilion for what many considered its first
true test of the year. Young dominated the
inside game and kept Bruin big men J.R.
Henderson and Jetani McCoy from having
any impact in the first half.
When he sat down early in the second pe
riod with four fouls, the gap he left in the
middle was more than apparent as the Bru
ins outrebounded the Cardinal to cut an IX
point deficit to one before losing.
Young has been one of head coach Mike

Montgomery's trump cards in the tradeoff
between quickness and height. Young has
been most effective against teams who. like
Stanford, rely on their height more than
their quickness.
Not tnat Young's incapable of pushing the
ball up the court.
Saturday night's behind-the-back dribble to
get around an Oregon State defender and his
driving layup on Thursday showed a more
versatile side to the center and elicited an ex
cited ovation and a few laughs from the crowd.
Young says his playing is directly related
to his health. And as Stanford prepares for
this weekend in Chicago, Young says he's
felt a lot worse.
"We've had a pretty solid season," he said.
"You can't go 18-0 without being really fo
cused.
"But for me it's been a long season," he
said. "I think my back takes a toll."
Young said he has put a priority on heal
ing his back and "worrying about the offsea
son later."
On Friday. Young will again be called
upon by Montgomery to spur the offense
against Charleston, which has a 6-foot-6 cen
ter and a 6-foot-7 forward.
Clemson, the Cardinal's probable oppo
nent in the second round, is much quicker
than the Cougars.
Hut Young hopes that after 2h wins in 30
games, the Cardinal will do better in the
tournament than last year's school-best per
formance.
"We really want to get past the Sweet Six
teen," Young said. "It's realistic if we get our
heads together."

Though many expected Tim Young to dominate op
ponents offensively, the junior center has been in
dispensable at both ends of the court. Against USC,
Young had nine points and nine rebounds as well
as three blocks.
