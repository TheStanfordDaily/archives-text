# Tournament selections display equality between conferences

### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
Exceptional balance among
power conferences and two at-large
bids to a conference with two tourna
ment wins in its history highlighted
Sunday's announcement of the 64-
team NCAA men's tournament field.
Five different conferences each
penciled five members into the brack
et, and the Midwestern Collegiate
Conference sent 111.-Chicago and De
troit in addition to its surprise tourna
ment champion, Butler. More sur
prisingly, the Flames and Titans
weren't even on the bubble, receiving
a No. 9 and No. 10 seed, respectively.
The No. 1 seeds presented no sur
prises. with the country's top four
teams in the rankings sent to their ap
propriate regions. Conference USA
champion Cincinnati (26-5) parlayed
a strong finish into a No. 2 seed, and
Purdue (26-7) became the only top
two seed not to win its conference
tournament or regular-season title
outright.

The Boilermakers and Bearcats
stole the No. 2 seed that some be
lieved would go to Utah (25-3), the
Western Athletic champion who lost
in the quarterfinals of the WAC tour
nament to eventual champion IJNLV
(20-12), or Pacific 10 Conference run
ner-up Stanford (26-4), who still
matched its best seeding in tourney
history as the No. 3 in the Midwest.
As expected, the Pac-10 Confer
ence sent four teams packing, with
Arizona State's 117-71 season-ending
loss at USC creating an NIT date for
the Sun Devils (18-13) tonight at
Hawaii (19-8). A lack of quality wins
couldn't keep fourth-place Washing
ton from its first bid in 12 years. The
Huskies (18-9) nabbed the 11th seed
in the East and a matchup with At
lantic 10 champion Xavier (22-7).
Arizona (26-4) earned the top
seed in the West and a first-round
cakewalk with Southland champ
Nicholls State (19-9), who won its
conference championship when a po
tential game-tying three-pointer from
sub-.5(X) Texas-Arlington was ruled

just after the buzzer.
UCLA (19-8) slumped badly in
the latter half of Pac-10 play and lost
center Jelrni McCoy, who quit the
squad, bu. still had enough left to grab
the sixth seed in the South. The Bru
ins will meet Miami another
team that stumbled late and lost to the
bottom seed in the 13-team Big East
tourney. The Hurricanes (18-9) still
enjoyed their finest season since join
ing the Big East.
While no leagues sent more than
five teams, parity dictated that some
teams with subpar conference records
would garner invitations. Florida
State (17-13) secured the final invita
tion and has the worst conference
record (6-10) of any at-large invite in
NCAA tourney history. The Semi
noles meet Texas Christian (27-5) in
first-round action from the Midwest.
The Horned Frogs were one of
several Western teams with a high
seed. Eight of the country's top 25
teams hailed from the West, with the

bound against Arizona. The Wildcats are the No. 1 seed in the West
Region of the NCAA tournament.
Pac-10 and WAC leading the way.
Utah will play San Francisco (19-10),
the fifth seed in the West Coast Con
ference who stunned the rest of the
WCC en route to its first tourney hid
since 1982. New Mexico (23-7) stag
gered to the finish line hut earned a
No. 4 seed in the South after reaching
the WAC Championship game,
where the Lobos lost to IJNLV.
The Runnin' Rebels upset Utah.
Fresno State and New Mexico on
consecutive nights to grab a No. 12
seed and relegate Fresno. Wyoming,
Colorado State and Hawaii to the
NIT. Big Sky champion Northern
Arizona (21-7) joined Big South win
ner Radford (20-9) and Southwestern
Athletic champ Prairie View A&M
(13-16) as first-time participants, and
the Panthers boast the worst power
rating of any team in tourney history.
Regional breakdown
Generally, the road to the Final
Four appears bumpier on the right
side of the bracket. The East and
West regions, which get underway to
morrow, feature several marquee
teams capable of a trip to San Anto
nio. Stanford's region, the Midwest,
gives Kansas (34-3) a great opportu
nity to try for a national title and an
unprecedented 40 wins.
North Carolina (30-3) won the
ACC' title and the right to participate
in a regional in nearby Greensboro,
assuming the Tar I feels can knock off
Navy (19-10) and either UNC-Char
lotte (19-10) or 111.-(Chicago in Hart
ford, Conn. But the No. 2 seed, Con

necticut (29-4), survived a tough Big
East Conference tourney and will
pose a tough challenge for anybody.
Third-seeded South Carolina (23-
7) will be l<x)king to a avenge a stun
ning loss in last year's first round to
Coppin State and could meet Xavier
in a premier second-round matchup
in Washington. I).('. The fourth seed.
Michigan State (20-7). won the Big
Ten regular-season title, and fifth
seeded Princeton (26-1) lost only to
North Carolina en route to a top-10
ranking.
The West features the defending
national champion in Arizona, who
will take to Sacramento in the first
and second rounds. Eute Olsen's
squad could meet up with Tennessee
(20-8) in the second round, where last
year's Oregon coach, Jerry Green,
has led the Volunteers to their first
men's berth in nine years. Giant
killer Maryland (19-10), which played
one of the nation's toughest sched
ules, could await the Wildcats in a re
gional semifinal.
Cincinnati and Utah are heavily
favored to survive Boise. Idaho, and
advance to the regionals. Sixth-seed
ed Arkansas (23-8). coming off a
blowout loss to Kentucky in the SE(
tournament semifinals, could pose a
threat, as could Temple (21-8). a his
torically tough tourney team.
In the South. Duke (29-3) could be
challenged by fifth seeded Syracuse
(24-8), should they meet in a regional
semifinal. But many experts favor
Kentucky (29-4), the No. 2 seed
which breezed through its conference
tournament more easily than any
major conference winner. Michigan
(24-8) jumped to a No. 3 seed under
interim coach Brian Ellerbe and has

shown it can win tournaments, with
victories in the inaugural Big Ten
tourney and the San Juan Holiday
Classic in Puerto Rico in November.
Duke and the top half of the South
bracket battle in Ix'xington. ky.. and
Kentucky and the bottom half square
off in Atlanta.
The Midwest gives Stanford an ex
cellent chance at a regional final ap
pearance. because Purdue is general
ly regarded as the weakest of the sec
ond seeds. Hut Clemson (IK-13). de
spite its huge loss total, boasts great
athleticism, an earlv-season top-10
ranking and a penchant for taking
great teams to the wire.
St. John's (22-9), which had a
chance to steal the top seed in the Big
East Conference the last da\ of the
regular season, could spring an upset
from the No. 7 seed in Chicago.
Either fourth-seeded Mississippi
(22-6). the SEC West champs, or
fifth-seeded TCI J. which was unde
feated in the VVAC. could pose a
tougher challenge for Kansas in the
regionals— if they survive Oklahoma
City.
V* rap-lip
The four No. 1 seeds have never
united in the Einal Four, but this
could be the year. Kansas and Ari
zona were blessed with the weakest
No. 2 seeds and have a great opportu
nity to hold up their end of the bar
gain. North Carolina has the best ath
letes of any team in the country and
should be able to hold off Connecti
cut in the East. But Kentucky's ath
leticism may be ttx> much for Duke in
the South, and the Wildcats ma\
prove they can win it all without Kick
Pit ino come March 30.

lotte (19-10) or 111.-(Chicago in Hart
ford, Conn. But the No. 2 seed, Con

East Conference tourney and will
pose a tough challenge for anybody.

North Carolina en route to a top-10

The West features the defending
national champion in Arizona, who
will take to Sacramento in the first
and second rounds. Eute Olsen's
squad could meet up with Tennessee
(20-8) in the second round, where last
year's Oregon coach, Jerry Green,
has led the Volunteers to their first
men's berth in nine years. Giant
killer Maryland (19-10), which played
one of the nation's toughest sched

Cincinnati and Utah are heavily
favored to survive Boise. Idaho, and

In the South. Duke (29-3) could be
challenged by fifth seeded Syracuse

semifinal. But many experts favor
Kentucky (29-4), the No. 2 seed
which breezed through its conference
tournament more easily than any
major conference winner. Michigan
(24-8) jumped to a No. 3 seed under
interim coach Brian Ellerbe and has

regular season, could spring an upset

The four No. 1 seeds have never
united in the Einal Four, but this
could be the year. Kansas and Ari

No. 2 seeds and have a great opportu

gain. North Carolina has the best ath

should be able to hold off Connecti

the South, and the Wildcats ma\
prove they can win it all without Kick

NCAA tournament.
Exceptional balance among
power conferences and two at-large
bids to a conference with two tourna
ment wins in its history highlighted
Sunday's announcement of the 64-
team NCAA men's tournament field.
Five different conferences each
penciled five members into the brack
et, and the Midwestern Collegiate
Conference sent 111.-Chicago and De
troit in addition to its surprise tourna
ment champion, Butler. More sur
prisingly, the Flames and Titans
weren't even on the bubble, receiving
a No. 9 and No. 10 seed, respectively.
The No. 1 seeds presented no sur
prises. with the country's top four
teams in the rankings sent to their ap
propriate regions. Conference USA
champion Cincinnati (26-5) parlayed
a strong finish into a No. 2 seed, and
Purdue (26-7) became the only top
two seed not to win its conference
tournament or regular-season title
outright.

The Boilermakers and Bearcats
stole the No. 2 seed that some be
lieved would go to Utah (25-3), the
Western Athletic champion who lost
in the quarterfinals of the WAC tour
nament to eventual champion IJNLV
(20-12), or Pacific 10 Conference run
ner-up Stanford (26-4), who still
matched its best seeding in tourney
history as the No. 3 in the Midwest.
As expected, the Pac-10 Confer
ence sent four teams packing, with
Arizona State's 117-71 season-ending
loss at USC creating an NIT date for
the Sun Devils (18-13) tonight at
Hawaii (19-8). A lack of quality wins
couldn't keep fourth-place Washing
ton from its first bid in 12 years. The
Huskies (18-9) nabbed the 11th seed
in the East and a matchup with At
lantic 10 champion Xavier (22-7).
Arizona (26-4) earned the top
seed in the West and a first-round
cakewalk with Southland champ
Nicholls State (19-9), who won its
conference championship when a po
tential game-tying three-pointer from
sub-.5(X) Texas-Arlington was ruled

just after the buzzer.
UCLA (19-8) slumped badly in
the latter half of Pac-10 play and lost
center Jelrni McCoy, who quit the
squad, bu. still had enough left to grab
the sixth seed in the South. The Bru
ins will meet Miami another
team that stumbled late and lost to the
bottom seed in the 13-team Big East
tourney. The Hurricanes (18-9) still
enjoyed their finest season since join
ing the Big East.
While no leagues sent more than
five teams, parity dictated that some
teams with subpar conference records
would garner invitations. Florida
State (17-13) secured the final invita
tion and has the worst conference
record (6-10) of any at-large invite in
NCAA tourney history. The Semi
noles meet Texas Christian (27-5) in
first-round action from the Midwest.
The Horned Frogs were one of
several Western teams with a high
seed. Eight of the country's top 25
teams hailed from the West, with the

Pac-10 and WAC leading the way.
Utah will play San Francisco (19-10),
the fifth seed in the West Coast Con
ference who stunned the rest of the
WCC en route to its first tourney hid
since 1982. New Mexico (23-7) stag
gered to the finish line hut earned a
No. 4 seed in the South after reaching
the WAC Championship game,
where the Lobos lost to IJNLV.
The Runnin' Rebels upset Utah.

consecutive nights to grab a No. 12
seed and relegate Fresno. Wyoming,
Colorado State and Hawaii to the
NIT. Big Sky champion Northern
Arizona (21-7) joined Big South win
ner Radford (20-9) and Southwestern
Athletic champ Prairie View A&M
(13-16) as first-time participants, and
the Panthers boast the worst power
rating of any team in tourney history.
Regional breakdown
Generally, the road to the Final
Four appears bumpier on the right
side of the bracket. The East and
West regions, which get underway to
morrow, feature several marquee
teams capable of a trip to San Anto
nio. Stanford's region, the Midwest,
gives Kansas (34-3) a great opportu
nity to try for a national title and an
unprecedented 40 wins.
North Carolina (30-3) won the
ACC' title and the right to participate
in a regional in nearby Greensboro,
assuming the Tar I feels can knock off
Navy (19-10) and either UNC-Char
lotte (19-10) or 111.-(Chicago in Hart
