# Tournament selections display equality between conferences

Exceptional balance among
power conferences and two at-large
bids to a conference with two tourna
ment wins in its history highlighted
Sunday's announcement of the 64-
team NCAA men's tournament field.
Five different conferences each
penciled five members into the brack
et, and the Midwestern Collegiate
Conference sent 111.-Chicago and De
troit in addition to its surprise tourna
ment champion, Butler. More sur
prisingly, the Flames and Titans
weren't even on the bubble, receiving
a No. 9 and No. 10 seed, respectively.
The No. 1 seeds presented no sur
prises. with the country's top four
teams in the rankings sent to their ap
propriate regions. Conference USA
champion Cincinnati (26-5) parlayed
a strong finish into a No. 2 seed, and
Purdue (26-7) became the only top
two seed not to win its conference
tournament or regular-season title
outright.

The Boilermakers and Bearcats
stole the No. 2 seed that some be
lieved would go to Utah (25-3), the
Western Athletic champion who lost
in the quarterfinals of the WAC tour
nament to eventual champion IJNLV
(20-12), or Pacific 10 Conference run
ner-up Stanford (26-4), who still
matched its best seeding in tourney
history as the No. 3 in the Midwest.
As expected, the Pac-10 Confer
ence sent four teams packing, with
Arizona State's 117-71 season-ending
loss at USC creating an NIT date for
the Sun Devils (18-13) tonight at
Hawaii (19-8). A lack of quality wins
couldn't keep fourth-place Washing
ton from its first bid in 12 years. The
Huskies (18-9) nabbed the 11th seed
in the East and a matchup with At
lantic 10 champion Xavier (22-7).
Arizona (26-4) earned the top
seed in the West and a first-round
cakewalk with Southland champ
Nicholls State (19-9), who won its
conference championship when a po
tential game-tying three-pointer from
sub-.5(X) Texas-Arlington was ruled

just after the buzzer.
UCLA (19-8) slumped badly in
the latter half of Pac-10 play and lost
center Jelrni McCoy, who quit the
squad, bu. still had enough left to grab
the sixth seed in the South. The Bru
ins will meet Miami another
team that stumbled late and lost to the
bottom seed in the 13-team Big East
tourney. The Hurricanes (18-9) still
enjoyed their finest season since join
ing the Big East.
While no leagues sent more than
five teams, parity dictated that some
teams with subpar conference records
would garner invitations. Florida
State (17-13) secured the final invita
tion and has the worst conference
record (6-10) of any at-large invite in
NCAA tourney history. The Semi
noles meet Texas Christian (27-5) in
first-round action from the Midwest.
The Horned Frogs were one of
several Western teams with a high
seed. Eight of the country's top 25
teams hailed from the West, with the

Junior guard Kris Weems, an all-Pac-10 selection, battles for a re
bound against Arizona. The Wildcats are the No. 1 seed in the West
Region of the NCAA tournament.
