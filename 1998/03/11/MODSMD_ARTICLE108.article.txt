## Card finds itself at home in West Region 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
The road to the Final Four is set for the
fiflh-ranked Stanford women's basketball
team, and it runs straight through what
head coach Tara VanDerveer affection
ately calls the "brain bracket."
When tournament seedings came out
Sunday, the Cardinal (21 5) icceived a No.
I seed in the West Regional and will host a
subregional this weekend.
The brains that VanDerveer is refer
ring to are the No. 2 seed Duke and Stan
ford's first-round opponent. Harvaid. Fill
ing out the subregional foi the ( aid are
Hawaii (23-4) and Arkansas (18-10). who
will play each other Saturday at Maples
Pavilion at 6:30 p.m. Stanford's contest
against the Crimson will follow the conclu
sion of that game. The winners will meet
up Monday atp.m.
"We're really excited to be hosting a
subregional." VanDerveer said. "And
we're excited that if we play well this
weekend we'll be going to Oakland."
The West Regional is being held at the
New Arena in Oakland, and VanDerveer
said that finals and the amount of travel al
ready put in by the Card makes staying in
the Bay Area very appealing, not to men
tion the support her squad will likely re
ceive from Bay Area fans.
But for Stanford right now. the most
important thing is the health of senior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard. Nygaard injured
her left knee last Saturday at Oregon
State, and even if Nygaard is available to

play in the tournament it's unlikely that
she will he full strength any time soon.
"It's a little stiff," Nygaard said Sunday.
"It's been through a trauma, hut it's not
painful or swollen."
If Nygaard is unable to go, Stanford will
be without the Pacific 10 Conference's
most prolific three-point shooter and the
team's third-best scorer and rebounder.
"She has a huge impact on our team."
VanDcrveer said. "She brings so much
and has been one of our most consistent
players all year. She 's a leader of our team,
but if we have to play without her. I know
other people will pick up the slack."
One of the first challenges those people
will be faced with is stopping Harvard's
Allison Feaster.
The senior forward is the nation's lead
ing scorer with 2N.5 points per game and is
14th in rebounding with 1 ().«S. Harvard got
into the tournament by virtue of its third
consecutive Ivy League title this year and
is a good shooting team (22nd in three
point percentage at 36.9 and second in
three-pointers per game with 7.6).
Feaster "really is an exciting player,"
VanDcrveer said. "On a team where you
have outstanding individual players, you
have to work very hard."
As for the Cardinal's second-round op
ponent, it's anyone's guess. Hawaii had
the best record in the Western Athletic
Conference this year but lost in the quar
terfinals of the WAC tournament to even
tual winner New Mexico. At one point in
the season, the Rainbow Wahine posted a
19-eame win streak, but Hawaii is only 2-2

against tournament teams.
Arkansas, meanwhile, finished tied for
sixth in the tough Southeastern Confer
ence. The Razorbacks struggled with a 7-7
conference mark and are only 5-8 against
tournament teams, winning only one out
of their last eight against tourney teams.
That win was a Jan. 11 victory (l()2- l >())
over the Midwest's No. 2 seed. Alabama.
But aside from that win Arkansas has not
beaten a tourney team since early Decem
ber.
"1 think everyone else will know more
about us than we know about them," Van-
Derveer said. "Hut we've been through
this routine before, and I know great
teams are coming. What a great bracket.
All the teams have had good years and
have great tradition. And it's a fun rivalry
with 1 larvard-Stanford."
If the rest of the bracket unfolds ac
cording to the scedings, the Cardinal
would face lowa in the Sweet Sixteen.
With 10 losses on the season, lowa has the
worst winning percentage of any fourth
seed in the tournament's history.
If Stanford makes it to the regional
final, it will probably face either Florida or
Duke. The Blue Devils are the No. 2 seed,
and Florida is the No. 3.
The Gators' potential second-round
matchup is sixth-seeded Wisconsin, who
beat the Cardinal W-X2 in Stanford's sea
son opener.
Both Stanford and Tennessee are aim
ing for a fourth consecutive trip to the

Senior forward Vanessa Nygaard and fifth-ranked
Stanford will begin its pursuit of a fourth straight
Final Four appearance when it plays host to Har
vard Saturday night.
