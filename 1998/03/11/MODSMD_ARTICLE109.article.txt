# Gbalazeh goes from walk-on to contributor
## Sophomore guard earns scholarship, praise 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
It was all part of a plan, she says.
"I had applied to Stanford with the
intent of trying out for the basketball
team." said sophomore walk-on
turned scholarship player Yvonne
Gbalazeh. "I wanted to play basket
ball because I wouldn't know what to
do with my free time."
For Gbalazeh. the path she tread
ed to become a member of the Stan
ford women's basketball program
was not an easy one. There was no
uniform with her name on it waiting
at Maples Pavilion and no scholarship
that went with it.
There were also the expectations.
"We've always had a [walk-on]
when we've won a national champi
onship." said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "Whether it was
Angela Taylor. Amy Wustefeld or
Kate Pave, we have a great tradition
of walk-ons here at Stanford."
But this did not deter Gbalazeh
a 5-foot-5 guard from Victoria. Tex.
— from daring to walk on to a team
that returned 10 letterwinners last

year and was the preseason No. 1
team in the country. Her bold move
(as well as her hard work) has been re
warded with a scholarship for this sea
son as well as an increased role in the
Card's improving backcourt play.
"I think she's helped with her in
tensity defensively, showing other
people that this is the kind of defense
I want played," VanDerveer said.
"She's improving her ball-handling;
she's working on her shooting. She's
someone who people really have con
fidence in."
Before Gbalazeh came to Stan
ford, she was a four-year letterwinner
in both crosscountry and track at Vic
toria High Schcxil. She was also the
point guard on the basketball team
for all four years. So a three-sport ath
lete like (ibala/eh shouldn't have any
problems with the preseason condi
tioning program of a highly-regarded
basketball program, right?
"I was extremely cocky going in,"
Gbalazeh said. "The coaches told me
there was a lot of track work involved
early on. but all through high school I
had run track and cross country. They
had said if I got through conditioning.

I would make the team.
"Well. I had an out-of-body expe
rience," she continued, laughing. "1
thought 1 was going to die. But after a
week of practice, Tara pulled me
aside and told me 1 had made the
team."
Gbalazeh made appearances in 13
games last season, all those after stars
like Kate Starbird and Jamila Wide
man had long salted the game away.
But Gbalazeh was on the team —
with an increased role on the horizon.
"I was there to provide support,
particularly in practice and in games,"
Gbalazeh said. "But there was also
lots of adjusting to make."
Fhis year has seen what Gbalazeh
calls "tremendous improvement in
every aspect of her game." Among
the highlights of her 20 appearances
include the eight points scored in the
win over UCLA and the five assists
she dished out against Washington
State.
But perhaps most importantly, she
has been a key contributor in the
backcourt-by-committee that Van-

Sophomore guard Yvonne Gbalazeh has earned substantial playing
time this season, playing solid defense like she did against sopho
more guard Kim Clark in a 91-63 rout of USC Feb. 14.
Derveer has used lately. With the ro
tation of Gbalazeh. junior Regan
Freuen and sophomores Christina
Batastini and Melody Peterson. Van-
Derveer has just the right amount of
offensive spark and defensive intensi
ty to keep sophomore point guard
Milena Mores concentrating on run
ning the offense.
"I feel like I've cot this ace in mv

hand, a secret weapon," VanDerveer
said. "I thought she did a great joh of
coming in and playing against [IISC"
sophomore guard) Kristin Clark
[Feb. 14]. At this point, she's a role
player for us. hut she might decide she
wants more, so I tell her to get her foot
in the door and go for it."
For Gbalazeh, the incentive to
keep working hard is certainly there
— her scholarship is only guaranteed
through this year. But her improve
ment has only added to her confi
dence — something that was there

from day one.
"It never entered my mind that I
wasn't going to make the team."
Gbalazeh said. "It was that mentality
that kept me going at first when I was
trying to make the team."
After all. not making the team was
never part of the plan.
"Is she the most talented guard on
our team? No." VanDerveer said.
"But she's very mature. She's some
one I can be really critical of and real
ly hard on. hut she always bounces
back. She's touch."
