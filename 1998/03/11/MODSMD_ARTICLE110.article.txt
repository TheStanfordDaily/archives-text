# 'Omi' looks back fondly on Stanford career
## Mulitauaopele set to move on after sitting out with knee injury 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
Ciood thing Naomi Muli
tauaopele's best friend wasn't on the
softball team.
Otherwise, she may never have
tried basketball. Confused? Muli
tauaopele explains.
"It actually started in the ninth
grade in high school," Mulitauaopele
says of her initial interest in basket
ball. "Basically my first love was vol
leyball, and I didn't even want to try
out for my high school [basketball]
team — I was very timid and I just
didn't like the sport.
"But my best friend was an avid
basketball player and she just threw
me into the gym during tryouts,"
Mulitauaopele continues. "Of course
they're going to say, 'OK, the 6-foot-1
freshman can play basketball and be
on the team.' So I tried it and got em
barrassed because I didn't know how
to play."
Mulitauaopele not playing basket
ball? Think about it. Her overtime
heroics in the 1996 West regional
semifinal against Alabama? Never
would have happened. The critical
jumpers nailed down the stretch in
No. 1 Stanford's showdown against
No. 2 Alabama in the 1996-97 season
opener? Nope. I"he sheer joy that she
brought to the court? Sorry, folks.
Fortunately for Stanford, every
thing fell into place — she began play
ing AAU basketball during the sum
mers, got recruited and chose to come
play for the Cardinal. And even
though the senior forward has missed
the entire season with a knee injury,
she has still been a positive presence
on the bench, cheering on her team
mates as only she knows how.
"She has a lot of enthusiasm and
she really enjoys playing," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"And that makes it sadder when
someone like that can't play."
Special relationship with her mother
Mulitauaopele is one of five chil
dren in a family that is extremely
close-knit. For Mulitauaopele. that
meant a wonderful relationship with

her mother Aperila, who died in 1992.
It was this woman who finally con
vinced her youngest daughter to give
basketball a shot.
"We went to this Christmas tour
nament [my freshman year in high
school], and this man came to me and
asked me if I wanted to play AAU
basketball for his team," Muli
tauaopele said. "At the time 1 wasn't
sure because it was in the summer and
I was getting offers to play club vol
leyball.
"But then, I thought about it and
talked to my mom about it and she
said, 'Well, you know enough about
volleyball, try this sport.' So I started
playing for AAU and then I started
liking mostly the team, and I had fun
with them. Also, the travel situation
was cool. I came back the next sum
mer and I thought that this sport
wasn't so bad. The next thing I knew,
I started getting letters from col
leges."
Indeed, the basketball honors
piled up almost as rapidly as the re
cruiting letters that were pouring in
from nationwide. Not bad for some
one who had never planned on play
ing basketball. But after Muli
tauaopele narrowed it down to the
West Coast schools, Stanford became
the lead choice for a very influential
reason — and it wasn't the tradition
built by VanDerveer.
"Out of the Pac-10,1 was consider
ing Washington, UCLA and Stan
ford," Mulitauaopele said. "From
there, my mom realized I had an op
portunity to come to Stanford. It's
kind of weird, but I wasn't very famil
iar with the tradition and background.
I knew that it was a great school, but I
honestly didn't know where it was."
"But I just remember how great
(my mom) felt and looked when I got
this little letter with Stanford head
ing," Mulitauaopele continued. "She
really was very excited that one of her
children had the opportunity. So that
was pretty much bottom line — it
goes beyond Tara saying Stanford
had the big names. I really knew that
it was my mom's dream and then it
became mine and then it became a
challenge, and then it became a good.

healthy challenge."
So Mulitauaopele was on her way
to Stanford, coming in with an amaz
ing freshman class that, during the
next four years, was going to help
bring Stanford back to Final Four
prominence.
Not that Mulitauaopele knew any
thing about that.
l ast-second dramatics
If ignorance is bliss, then stark re
alization must breed sheer shock.
Mulitauaopele was struck with the
scope of Stanford's basketball pro
gram immediately, but she knew she
had to overcome that quickly and try
to enjoy herself.
"I love to have fun because I re
alize that's the only wny that it's
going to make it easy," Muli
tauaopele said. "I remember fresh
man year just going home every day
to my dorm in Ujamaa and crying
thinking. 'I can't believe this is so
hard!" But as soon as conditioning
came in and I started to realize the
system and how it works. I became
the person that had fun."
The rest of the Cardinal was hav
ing fun during Mulitauaopele's fresh

man year, as the team rattled off a 30-
2 regular-season record before being
stopped cold by undefeated Con
necticut in the Final Four semifinal
game. Mulitauaopele was Stanford's
most accurate shooter that year with a
.582 field-goal percentage while aver
aging 7.3 points per game. The solid
numbers earned her a spot on the
Pac-10 all-freshman team.
She played in all 32 games for the
Cardinal the following season, as
Mulitauaopele continued to grow as a
player. The forward poured in a ca
reer-high 23 points in a remarkable
90-72 rout of eventual national cham
pion Tennessee. That victory was
only the fourth in a stretch that saw
Stanford win 29 of 30 games as the
Card, without VanDerveer, made a
surprising run to its second straight
Final Four.
But along the way, Mulitauaopele
had a major hand in salvaging Stan
ford's postseason run. The West re
gional semifinal against Alabama in
Mulitauaopele's hometown of Seat
tle, Wash., had everything anyone
would want out of a basketball game.
"That game couldn't have put to
gether so well being that it was in

Seattle, my whole family was there
and the intensity was high." Muli
tauaopele said. "It's like my favorite
game to watch — I like to fast-for
ward to the overtime."
With good reason. After Stanford
rallied from a seven-point deficit in
the last five minutes of regulation.
Mulitauaopele made two of her four
field goals in overtime, including a fv
footer over a fallen Lattice Jones with
2.7 seconds left in the extra session.
Her offense accounted for all of Stan
ford's points in overtime, as the Card
escaped with a 7N-7f» victory, a win
that could have been taken away had
the contact between Mulitauaopele
and Jones been called an offensive
foul
"It could've been either way,"
Mulitauaopele said of the possible
noncall. "1 remember turning around
and feeling her body against me and
thinking. Please don't blow the whis
tle'"'
Her postseason efforts earned her
a spot on the West Regional all-tour
nament team. Ironically, it would be
the last time she would play in front of
her home-town crowd.

Despite not having played since last year's Final Four semifinal game, Naomi Mulitauaopele was well-re
ceived at an emotional Senior Day (left). The senior forward is probably best remembered for her mem
orable shot that beat Alabama in overtime in the 1996 West Regional semifinal.
