# It was only a matter of time
## Early-season naysayers are silenced by the Card's season-ending 15-game win streak 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
With the announcement of the
NCAA tournament seedings Sun
day, the fifth-ranked Stanford
women's basketball team may have
erased the memories of the woes
that plagued the early season.
And you can bet that with the
Cardinal's selection as the No. 1
seed in the West Region, Stanford
fans are rapidly reserving their tick
ets for Kansas City.
It's become expected here, and
the season wouldn't really be over
without a trip to the Final Four. But
that's not what people were saying a
few short montl, - igo. "What's hap
pened to Stanford?" or "It's the end
of an era," were more likely to be
heard from fans than talk of a
fourth-straight Final Four.
Suddenly one of the toughest

programs in women's collegiate bas
ketball was off to its worst start
under head coach Tara Van-
Derveer, the very same coach who
had brought two national champi
onships to the Farm and turned
around the struggling program in
the late 1980s.
"I think the fact that we started
out on such a rocky road is a testa
ment to how much heart this team
has," said senior forward Olympia
Scott. "We could've said it's too
hard to get back to that Stanford tra
dition or it's too hard to meet the de
mands of our coach. I think this team
has a lot of heart and can bring it to
gether."
At that point senior forward
Kristin Folkl was still playing volley
ball. and senior forward Naomi
Mulitauaopele was still expected to
make it back from a knee injury.
There was still hope for improve

ment, hut wouldn't you know it, the
naysayers started popping up every
where.
An 0-2 start dropped Stanford
from its preseason top-five ranking,
but the Card bounced back with a
101-54 win over an unimpressive
San Francisco team. For a moment
Stanford was back.
Then came Tennessee. Everyone
was talking about the top-ranked
Lady Volunteers, and no one really
knew what to expect from the Card.
A 45-44 Stanford lead at the half was
both exciting and surprising, but
things turned ugly in the second. The
Cardinal went scoreless over the
first 4 minutes, 48 seconds as Ten
nessee took off for the 88-70 win,
and Stanford made only five field
goals in the second half.
The two 20-minute periods were
like a contrast of what the team
could be versus what it was at that
point in the season. And once
again, talk turned negative as Stan
ford was off to its worst start in 16
years at 1 -3.
"We threw them into the fire,"
VanDerveer said of the inexperi
enced guards. "My attitude was al
ways that what doesn't break you
will make you stronger. And in fact I
think it has made us a stronger team
and made us a hungry team wanting
to win. When you lose more games
in a week than you did in a whole
year, it gets your attention."
That was the first turning point.
More than two weeks without a
game gave Stanford the chance to
regroup and refocus. It also gave
other teams the opportunity to pass
the Cardinal in the rankings, and
when Stanford's Dec. 14 game at
then-No. 5 Illinois rolled around, the
Card was ranked 18th in the nation
and was the only team with a losing
record in the top 25.
Maybe you wouldn't call it a des
peration game, but then again
maybe you wouldn't call it anything
else. A loss would have dropped
Stanford to 1 -4 and probably pushed
it out of the A P rankings for the first
time since the end of the 1986-87
season.
It was a game the Card had to
win. The pressure was on, and it was
time to either step up or fold.
Stanford responded.
The Cardinal got 26 and 24
points, respectively, from Scott and
senior forward Vanessa Nygaard,
and the tide seemed to be turning as
Stanford got its first win over a
ranked opponent 91-78.
"Our backs were against the
wall," junior guard Regan Freuen
said of the Illinois game. "We played
a good team, and we beat them at
Illinois. We proved that we could
beat a good team on the road. We

had a lot of hard preseason games,
and they were all on the road. We
didn't get to play in our comfort
/one. which has tested us mentally
and made us stronger."
The tide was turning, that is. until
then-No. 3 Connecticut came along.
Stanford led 30-19 at one point in
the first half and things seemed to he
improving for the Card. The
I luskies made a run and even pulled
ahead 76-70. but Stanford was still in
it and playing well. That's when a
two-minute stretch of Stanford
turnovers and Connecticut steals
were good for a 10-0 Musky run that
put the game out of reach.
Here we go again. The first
month of the season had been a
roller coaster, not just game to
game, but minute to minute within
each game. If Stanford was going to
turn it around and keep it turned
around, it had to be soon.
Folkl returned, and Stanford rat
tled off four straight wins to move
above .500 for the first time all year.
Then came the first big conference
test — a game at then-No. 10 Ari
zona. Stanford's offense was in full
swing, but missed free throws and a
couple of late turnovers played a big
part.
Nonetheless, sophomore guard
Christina Batastini nailed a three
pointer with time winding down to
put Stanford up by one. It seemed
the Card had finally responded to its
first real test. Rut an answered
prayer at the buzzer gave the Wild
cats a 91-90 win.
Just another small setback, and at
this point it would seem to be the
last.
Stanford has won 15 straight

games since that contest and in the
process responded to some serious
threats. Just six days after the Ari
zona loss, the Cardinal found itself
fighting for its life against UC'I.A.
This time Stanford was clutch from
the line and got out of Pauley Pavil
ion with a five-point win. And that's
the closest any team has come to
beating the Cardinal since.
"We knew it was going to get bet
ter," VanDerveer said. "I think this
season the improvement of our
guards was very critical. It's night
and day. They're playing with so
much more confidence. And it's not
that we're doing things perfectly, but
we've got some players and now
they're starting to understand what
they're supposed to be doing."
Hut perhaps nothing did more for
Stanford's season than a win at then
fifth-ranked Texas Tech. The Lady
Raiders were the first team to lead
the Card at the half, but Stanford
made its run in the second half to get
the KO-71 win. More importantly, the
Card did it without Folkl. who broke
two fingers midway through the sec
ond half.
Suddenly people are talking
Final Four again. After all, Stanford
went into one of the most hostile en
vironments in women's basketball
and came away with a convincing
win on national television. And all
while its leading scorer and re
bounder sat on the bench.
The only big games that were
left proved to be when UCLA and
Arizona came to Maples Pavilion.
The Bruins came in to their Feb. 12
matchup against Stanford just one

game back in the conference race.
A UCLA win would mean a two
way tie for first, but the Cardinal
never gave the Bruins a chance.
Stanford ran away with the game
105-80.
And wouldn't you know it. Final

Four talk was getting louder and
louder.
"At the beginning of the season
we always set out goals, and those
goals are always to win the Pac-10
championship and win an NCAA
championship," Freuen said. "And
when we started out poorly. I think
we started taking things more one
game at a time. We knew we
couldn't look past anybody because

we weren't that good to be looking
past teams. So we obviously had
those goals but they were put more
in hindsight. We set day-to-day goals
or week-to-week goals."
When the Wildcats visited
Maples on the last day in February,
they should've known they didn't
stand a chance on Senior Day,
against a team that had come so far
since their last meeting. Stanford

pounded out its most prolific offen
sive performance of the year and
beat Arizona 108-90.
But the Wildcats should have ex
pected it. They should have known
that when a team starts out so high,
only to fall so fast and then gradual
ly build itself back up, you don't get
lucky against that team twice. It's
players are too strong for that be
cause to get back to where they are

now — to a place where even a na
tional championship seems a possi
bility — they had to be that strong.
"It's what we're talking about
right now as it's approaching,"
Freuen said. "We feel we can win an
NCAA championship. We still have
things we need to work on and im
prove on before then, but if we play
good basketball, we have the talent
that we can do that."
