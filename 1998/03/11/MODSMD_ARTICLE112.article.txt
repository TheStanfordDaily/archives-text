# Can anyone beat the Lady Volunteers?
## Undefeated Tennessee the heavy favorite 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
Stanford was not among those
complaining when the NCAA an
nounced the women's 64-team
contingent for the postseason Sun
day.
While Louisiana State and In
diana grumbled about their omis
sions and Connecticut (31-2) won
dered how a team with 10 fewer
wins that lost to the Huskies in the
regular season by 16 points could
earn a better seed, the Cardinal
(21-5) secured a top seed for the
third consecutive year. Connecti
cut's Nykesha Sales suffered a sea
son-ending Achilles injury last
month, but Stanford senior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard's availabil
ity for the tourney was in question
(due to a knee injury) at the time
of the announcement.
Few would classify any of the
top seeds in the West as the most
dominant No. 2, No. 3, No. 4 or
even No. 5 seed. lowa (17-10), the
region's fourth seed, has the worst
winning percentage (.629) of any
No. 4 seed in the 17-year history of
the tournament, although Angie
Lee's Hawkeyes were the Big
Ten's regular-season champion.
Second-seeded Duke (21-7)
won the Atlantic Coast in the reg
ular season but stumbled in the
ACC tourney. The No. 3 seed,
Florida (21-8), tied for second in
the powerful Southeastern Con
ference this season but lost three
of its last five games by an average
of more than 17 points per game.
Fifth-seeded Kansas (21-8) isn't
close to the rankings.
Teams from the Pacific and
Mountain time zones speckled the
women's bracket like never be
fore, earning 12 berths. The West
ern Athletic Conference, which
had never before sent three teams
to the NCAAs, was granted five
bids. And for the second consecu
tive year, the Pacific 10 Confer
ence sent its top half, with Wash
ington (18-9) narrowly avoiding
the cutoff yet again.
The Huskies used four big non
conference wins in November and
December to offset a ,S(X) league
record. Their No. 13 seed (in the
Midwest) represents the worst
seed among any at-large invite,
along with Massachusetts of the
Atlantic 10, and Washington's
poorest seed in 12 appearances.
Arizona (21-6) earned the right
to host a subregional for the first
time and will face West Coast
champion Santa Clara (23-7) in
the first round Friday. The Wild
cats are the third seed in the East

Region behind only Old Domin
ion and Connecticut.
Oregon (17-9) survived the loss
of freshman star Brianne Meharry
and advanced to its fifth straight
tourney, hut Jody Runge's team
received its poorest seed ever and
will battle Big East runner-up
Rutgers (20-9) at Ames, lowa, in
the first round.
The WAC failed to receive bet
ter than Utah's No. 7 seed after
the favorites struggled in the early
rounds of the conference tourna
ment. Utah (21-5) and Hawaii (24-
3) were hoping to host subregion
als. Instead, the Utes meet
Louisville (19-11) at Durham,
N.C., and Hawaii meets Arkansas
(18-10) at Maples Pavilion Satur
day at 6:30 p.m., with the winner
facing the winner of Stanford-
Harvard.
New Mexico (26-6) took the
WAC tourney crown and earned a
trip to Norfolk, Va., to battle the
No. 9 seed in the East, Nebraska
(22-9). Southern Methodist (21-7)
also travels to the East Region to
take on sixth-seeded Virginia (18-
9), and Colorado State (23-5) bat
tles Missouri Valley champion
Drake (25-4) as the 12th seed in
the Midwest in West Lafayette,
Ind.
Elsewhere among Western
teams, Big West winner UC-Santa
Barbara (26-5) looks to knock off
sixth-seeded Vanderbilt (20-8) in
Champaign, 111., and Big Sky
champion Montana (24-5) duels
Elorida in Gainesville as the No.
14 seed.
The West's surge into the field
coincided with the Southeastern
Conference's slight slackening of
its stranglehold on the host slots.
Only Tennessee, Alabama and
Florida will host subregionals this
year after five SEC teams earned
the right last year. For the first
time in four seasons, the SEC did
not send seven teams to the tour
ney, but its six bids still outdis
tanced the ACC, Big Ten, Pac-10
and WAC, who each received five
invitations. The Big East's four in
vitations were a record high.
Regional breakdown
With the West shaping up as the
weakest of the four regions, the
East looks particularly strong at
the top four spots. In the Midwest,
Texas Tech (25-4) will never have
to leave Lubbock to reach its sec
ond Final Four. In the Mideast, a
fairly weak corps of teams will
likely bow to Tennessee (33-0),
which could claim the NCAA
record for victories in a season
with its 36th win in a regional

semifinal.
The West winner will face the
Midwest champion March 28 in
the Final Four, paving the way for
a possible Texas Tech-Stanford
rematch of a Jan. 31 game won by
the Cardinal.
The No. 2 seed in the Midwest,
Alabama (22-9), has more losses
than any second seed since Ten
nessee had nine in the inaugural
NCAA tourney in 1982. However,
third-seeded Louisiana Tech (26-
3) was considered worthy of a top
seed by some and may challenge
the Tide in a regional semifinal.
The Tide could face UCLA (19-
8) in the second round, although
Michigan (19-9) will try for its first
tournament win in eight years
against the Bruins in the first
round at Tuscaloosa, Ala.
The Lady Techsters should
have little trouble against Clem
son (24-7) in the second round,
and the Tigers should handle
Miami (Fla.), one of the more sur
prising entries in the tournament
at 19-9 from the Big East.
Neither Purdue (20-9), the Big
Ten tournament champ, nor Mis
souri Valley champ Drake (25-4)
appears to have the horses neces
sary to stop Ail-American Alicia
Thompson and the Lady Raiders
at home.
Tennessee will stay in the state
until the Final Four as well, with
the regionals in Nashville at Van
derbilt. The Lady Vols do face an
other unbeaten in the first round,
with the Big South's Liberty (28-0)
carrying no blemishes into its first
ever NCAA tourney game at
Thompson-Boling Arena. An
often-ranked opponent awaits in
the second round in either West
ern Kentucky (25-8) of the Sun
Belt or Stephen F. Austin (25-3) of
the Southland.
Nobody from the Ames, lowa,
subregional or the Champaign.
111., subregional should threaten
Tennessee, although the Illini
raced to a huge lead against the
Lady Vols in the early season be
fore collapsing. Illinois (18-9) re
ceived the highest seed of any Big
Ten squad although it won neither
the regular-season crown or con
ference tournament. Vanderbilt
(20-8) could knock off the streaky
Illini in the second round and ad
vance to its ninth consecutive re
gional — on its home floor.
Second-seeded North Carolina
(24-6) won the ACC tournament
but could have its hands full with
Florida International (28-1) in the
second round. The Trans America
Athletic champion had been
ranked in the top 15 and hoping

for a host opportunity, but a weak
schedule dropped the Golden
Panthers to a No. 7 seed.
In the East, Old Dominion (27-
2) seeks a return trip to the Final
Four, and the Lady Monarchs
should cruise past its subregional
opponents. Fourth-seeded North
Carolina State (21-6) could face
Conference USA champion Mem
phis (22-7) in a second-round
game in Raleigh, N.C.
In the bottom half, Arizona
should be able to advance to its
first regional unless sixth-seeded
Virginia (18-9) can spring a sur
prise. The Wildcats may like their
chances against Connecticut (31-
2), which sputtered without its all
time leading scorer but should be
able to get by the depleted No. 7
seed. Georgia (17-10), in Storrs,
Conn. The Lady Bulldogs might
not make it past George Washing
ton (19 9) in the first round.
Wrap-up
With the top four seeds in each
region hosting subregionals. don't

expect many dark horses to reach
the regionals. Illinois, lowa State
and lowa appear most susceptible
to upsets.
Texas Tech has the home-court
advantage but still may not have
the athletes to get past Alisa Bur
ras and Louisiana Tech. Stanford
should not be challenged in Oak
land, but Nygaard's injury could
keep the Cardinal from advancing
to the national championship
game for the first time in four con
secutive tries.
With Sales injured. Connecticut
may not be able to overcome Old
Dominion, which still features a
great point guard and center from
last year's national runner-up.
No team has ever won three
consecutive NCAA champi
onships. Expect Tennessee to join
AI AW champs Immaculata (1972-
74) and Delta State (1975-77)
among the ranks of the three
peaters. but don't count out a
Stanford team with Nygaard,
Folkl and Scott to bang with the
Ladv Vols.


Rebecca Roberts — Daily file
After leading them at halftime, the Cardinal fell prey to sophomore
guard Kellie Jolly (#l4) and the rest of the top-ranked Lady Vols, 88-
70. Tennessee enters the NCAA tournament 33-0 and as the top seed
in the Mideast Region.
