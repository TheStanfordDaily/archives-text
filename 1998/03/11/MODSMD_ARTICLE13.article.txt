Some minorities found more sus
ceptible to Alzheimer's disease
CHICAGO (AP) — Blacks and Hispanics
have a puzzling, additional risk factor that
makes them much more susceptible than whites
to Alzheimer's disease, researchers say.
It's been known since IW2 that people with a
certain gene have a greatly elevated risk for
developing the disease.
Now. researchers say that even without that
suspect gene, blacks and Hispanics are at much
greater risk than whites for Alzheimer's.
"We think it's another biological factor,
another gene or genes that account for this."
said Dr. Richard Mayeux. a neurologist al
Columbia University and one of the researchers
in the study published in Wednesday's edition
of The Journal of the American Medical Associ
ation.
About 25 percent of the total population has
the apolipoprotein E-4 gene, or apo F-4. which
is known to be closely associated with the dis
ease, although its exact role remains unknown.
The survey of 1,079 elderly men and women
found that blacks who lack the gene are lour
times more likely to get the disease than whites.
The risk to Hispanics is double that of whites. In
both cases, the influence of age. gender, educa
tion, hypertension and family history of demen
tia was ruled out.
About 10 percent of the white population
lacking the gene would be expected to get the
disease. Mayeux said.
Rats plague Vietnam
HANOI. Vietnam (AP) — Imagine killing 55
million rats in a year — and still losing ground.
Vietnam's vermin plague has gotten so bad
that the central government has banned exports
of traditional rat predators and closed down
restaurants that specialize in serving up cats or
snakes.
Some local government officials offer boun
ties for each tail brought in.
Television, radio and newspapers encourage
farmers and children alike to go out en masse
and use smoke, dogs or digging to flush out rats
and kill them.
A biological solution — a deadly rodent-spe
cific bacteria dubbed 'bio-rat is being pro
duced to avoid reliance on dangerous poisons
that can kill chickens, other animals and even
small children. Losses to Vietnam's critical rice
crop amounted to $6 million last year, said Dam
Ouoc Tru. deputy director general of the Plant
Protection Department in the Ministry ol Agri
culture and Rural Development
The problem has grown almost exponentially
Tru said 220.000 acres of rice paddies were
infested in 1995.
That rose to MO.(XK) acres in IW6 and
925.000 last year. In the first two months of
IWK. more than 320.000 acres of the winter
spring crop already have been hit
