### 
MANAMA. Bahrain (AP) — An
American-led team of U.N. weapons
inspectors ended its latest mission to Iraq
yesterday after searching eight sensitive
sites — areas that Iraqi sources said
included the Defense Ministry and bar
racks of the elite Republican Guards.
The six-day mission by American Scott
Ritter and his 50-member team had been
considered a first test of Iraq's compliance
with a Feb. 23 accord on the U.N. search
es for banned weapons.
Janet Ann Sullivan, a spokeswoman in
Baghdad for the I J.N. inspectors, declined
to identify the sites visited by Ritter's
squads but said: "All sites were inspected
to the satisfaction of the inspection team."
The pro-government Al-Iraq newspa
per said in a front-page editorial that Rit

ter "will not get more than what the other
inspection teams have gotten — noth
ing."
Also yesterday, a U N. envoy arrived
in Bahrain to lorni a diplomatic group to
accompany arms inspectors on the true
test of Iraqi compliance: searches of Sad
dam Hussein's palace compounds.
Iraq once vowed it would never open
the palaces to arms inspectors. Mut under
threat of a U.S.-led attack, it backed down
as part of last month's accord with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The
accord brokered a compromise by which
the palace inspections would go through,
but only with an escort of U.N. diplomats.
The first inspections of palaces arc
expected later this month.

Bahrain early today. He is to present his

escorts in meetings with Iraqi officials this
week
Iraq insists it has fully cooperated with
the inspectors and destroyed all of its
chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles.
