# Privacy questioned
## E-mail may be public domain

BISMARCK. N.D. (AP)
Some state officials are learning to
their surprise that their electronic
mail is more public than private.
The issue was highlighted when
North Dakota's attorney general
ruled that the state Board of 1 ligher
Education had held illegal secret
meetings.
The ruling came after The Asso
ciated Press revealed that board
members used e-mail to discuss and
even take straw votes on whether to
lire the president of the University
of North Dakota.
Under last week's order by
Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp,
the board held a public meeting yes
terday to explain what members had
discussed in secret. The panel even
tually decided to accept an apology
from university President Ken
Baker.
North Dakota's broad open
records law says most records are
available for public inspection. It
doesn't specifically say "government
e-mail is a public record," but in
most cases around the country so
far. it has been considered public,
experts say.
"Fortunately so far. most of the
time when the decision comes up
the decision is made in favor of open
government." said Paul McMasters,
First Amendment ombudsman for
the Freedom Forum of Arlington.
Va. "And courts and authorities in
most of the cases said e-mail can't be
used as a substitute for smoke-tilled
back rooms.
"My impression is the laws that
the attorney generals are making
their rulings under are general
enough that they can make that rul
ing without specifically mentioning
e-mail."
McMasters said there have been
several e-mail cases in other states:
In 1997. Baltimore Communi
ty College Board members got rid
of $25,000 worth of computer
equipment after the Baltimore
County attorney told the board that
using e-mail to discuss public affairs
would violate the state's open meet
ing law
In a IIW7l l W7 Sarasota, 1 la., case, a
majority of county commissioners
agreed via e-tnail to withhold a pub
lie vote on whether to sell a pro
posed library site. A lawsuit uncov
ered the secret arrangement, but the

suit was dropped when the commis
sioners left office.
â€”In Phoenix, Ariz., city council
members debated a range of issues
and held straw votes via e-mail. As a
result of inquiries by the Arizona
Republic in 1996. the city spent
$S.(MK) to upgrade the system so
copies of e-mail could be kept in the
eitv clerk's office for public access.
The North Dakota case arose
after members of the higher educa
tion board became upset by reports
of $b million in deficits at the uni
versity in Grand Forks.
In the e-mail messages, board
members discuss the impact of firing
Baker.
In one message, university chan
cellor Larry Isaak warned: "Forcing
Ken out will heighten anxiety at
UNI) and in Grand Forks. It will
create much thrashing about. It will
be bloody and public."
Though the e-mail messages
themselves did not constitute an ille
gal meeting. Heitkamp said. thev
were part of the evidence she
reviewed before ruling the board
broke the law by holding secret
meetings at a hotel and in a college
office. In fact, the board willingly
released the messages when asked
by the AP.
David Sobel. legal counsel lor the
non-profit Electronic Privacy Infor
mation Center in Washington. D C " ,
said e-mail privacy issues arc still
being debated.
"Now we're getting to the point
of needing to make distinctions
between things that are of legitimate
public interest and things that are
primarily personal business," he
said.
North Dakota Gov. Ed Schafer
said the case of the education board
is a lesson lor other state workers.
"I think what's happened with e
mail is we haven't mentally, as a
society, said That's really hard
copy." " Schafer said. "I think that's
where the enlightenment is coming.
"If I have my private computer at
home and 1 e-mail another private
individual on their private comput
er. why is that open record'.'" the
governor asked "Well, if you're
conducting state's business because
you're on a board or commission, it
is. And I think that's been some
thing that we're obviously sorting
out now. tixv"
