# Sororities accept housing
## 
### Kristie Lilje Senior staff writer 
Both the Delta Delta Delta and
Kappa Alpha Theta sororities have
accepted the Office of Residential
Education's housing offer for place
ment in the Cowell Cluster begin
ning next fall.
"We're trying to work out the lo
gistics to ensure that the house runs
as smoothly as possible." said Tri-
Delt President Sara Petersen, whose
sorority will be housed in ATO.
The logistics under consideration
most likely surround the size of the
two houses that Res Ed granted to
the sororities: ATO has a 55-person
capacity, and Alpha Sigma can
house 50 people. Critics of this deci
sion have argued that the houses are
too large to accommodate the soror
ities, which typically have 60 to 70
members, and charge that the hous
ing offer is not feasible for the soror
ities in the long run.
For the Thetas, being able to fill
Alpha Sig was a consideration in the
decision to accept Res Ed's offer, ac
cording to Theta Vice President of
Public Relations Katie Gore. More
than 80 percent of the members.

however, voted to accept placement
in the house despite having 32 of its
72 members graduating this year.
Gore added.
"We would not have accepted
the offer if we didn't think we could
fill the house." Gore said.
A new policy may help the
housed sororities this year in achiev
ing the numbers they need to fill
both Alpha Sig and ATO. Accord
ing to Intersorority Council Presi
dent Alice Prager, the council has
raised the allowable number ol
members per chapter from 70 to 75.
While Prager agreed that this
move helps the housed chapters by
increasing the pool from which they
can fill their residences, she ex
plained that it is a beneficial move
for all six chapters.
"The timing is not necessarily a
coincidence, but it is not tightly cor
related." Pruger said.
The totals will be raised after
Rush, which means that the Rush
process itself will remain the same,
Prager said. "We were expecting
more people to Rush this quarter so
we wanted to be able to give women
more spaces." she added.
Throughout the week, several

current and former residents of
Alpha Sig expressed outrage at what
they perceive as Res Ed's lack of stu
dent input regarding the decision to
give away their house.
When asked whether the student
outcry surrounding the loss of Alpha
Sig factored into the sorority's deci
sion, Gore said that the Thetas "were
under the impression that the house
would not be given hack to Alpha Sig
if [they) declined the offer."
