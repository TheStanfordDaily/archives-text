Grade inflation does
not decrease value of
college education

SOME CRITICS WORRY that
colleges today are devaluing their
degrees by inflating grades.
Although we recognize the existence
of grade inflation, we believe these
concerns are unfounded.
A New York Times editorial note
book on Sunday, March 8, decried a
nationwide trend of college professors
shelling out excessive A f s — either to
: S •• ' ' • '
attract students to classes facing extinc
tion or to avoid negative course evalu
ations. These evaluations affect tenure
and promotion decisions at many insti
tutions.
According to The New York Times
piece, colleges, parents and students
who push for high grades are "addicted
to counterfeit excellence." Diplomas,
the piece concludes, will become
increasingly meaningless as the years
go by.
But the fact that grades are general
ly going up is not to say that students
are learning less. For one thing, most
people agree that a grade is not always
an accurate measure of how much one
has learned.
However, the very attention given to
grades detracts from the purpose of
learning. To issue grades is certainly
reasonable, for it offers students an

extra incentive to study. But to suggest
that a particular grading scale is
devaluing college diplomas is to lose
sight of a main purpose of education.
The strong attention given to grades
encourages students to become grade
grubbers, not genuine scholars.
A grading system's greatest value
comes in its ability to distinguish stu
dents from peers at their own institu
tions. Although grades in general are
rising, gradations distinguishing stu
dents from their classmates remain.
Additionally, graduate school
admissions committees and potential
employers adjust for universities' var
ied grading systems. Thus, grades still
retain their value as a comparative
indicator of an entire cohort.
Contrary to the notebook's claim,
more A's and B's may indeed mean
that more students are well prepared to
enter the "real world," a trend that
should be welcomed, not decried. And
as many students can testify, C's still do
exist — sometimes even with hard
work.
ITie purpose of a university educa
tion is self-explanatory: to educate. It is
not to ensure that a constant propor
tion of students receive low grades, nor
to make students spend four years wor
rying about letters rather than learning.
If critics are concerned about the
quality of education in American insti
tutions, they might do well to speak to
issues more substantive than the first
few letters of the alphabet.
