## Reconsider bilingual education

Numerous times since my
arrival in the United States
last September, I have
consciously forced myself
to use English. However,
more often than not, 1

think in Chinese and then experience diffi
culty translating my ideas into English.
While I labor mentally, I fail to under
stand the words of my conversation partner,
who is then puzzled by "the outcome of my
hard work." For the first time in my life, I felt
helpless in conversations. This problem
stemmed from my English education back in
China. I have become accustomed to relying
on my mother tongue to study English. And
now at Stanford, it's pay-back time.
The editorial board of the Stanford Post
Dispatch (a simulated newspaper for the
opinion writing course 1 am taking this quar
ter) has been discussing Ron IJn/.'s bilingual
education initiative. Proposition 227, for the
last three weeks. After interviewing repre
sentatives from both sides of the issue and
participating in heated class discussions, the
board concluded that Unz's bilingual educa
tion initiative, though well-intended, is not
the best approach because of its oversimpli
fication of the serious problems facing bilin
gual education in America.
Keeping class discussions in mind, 1
embarked on my mission: to write an edito
rial expressing our opinions on this contro
versy. My initial feeling was to adopt the

majority opinion of the editorial board: no
on Unz. Before starting to write, 1 called a
friend studying English education at a major
research university on the East Coast to fur
ther discuss my uncertain conclusion.
Now a student teacher of English at a lan
guage school for foreigners, my friend wants
to be a bilingual education teacher after
graduation. She plans to study Spanish.
I told her about our editorial board's deci
sion. Her English has improved immensely
since she left China. "You made the right
choice," she said. "Unz just needs a new
hook for his political ambitions."
But I still had my doubts. "You know,
Chicano/Latino kids have a dropout rate of
4() percent, the highest among all ethnic
minority groups."
"That's because not all of them take bilin
gual education," she interrupted authorita
tively. That sounded weird to me. I suddenly
realized that the conversation topic had
changed smoothly and unquestionably from
ending bilingual education to expanding it.
Excuse me, my friend — Chicano/Latino
schoolchildren are the major clients of bilin
gual education. You must have known that
before you planned to take a Spanish class.
While there are hardly any Chinese bilingual
programs for Chinese immigrant children in
California, most of them excel in school, and
few drop out. I believe the high dropout rate
of Chicano/Latino children is not a reason
for bilingual education, but the result!
I am not an education major, but 1 know
how easy it is for a young child to learn
English. My roommate, who immigrated to

the United States from Taiwan at the age of
eight, was able to catch up with his native
peers in a mainstream school after studying
in an English language program for one year.
Immersion worked for him.
I know how hard it is for a person my age
to comfortably communicate in English,
even though 1 have studied it with the aid of
Chinese for over 10 years. For my opinion
writing class. 1 spend many nights struggling
into the early morning with English.
I know it will take me much more time
and effort to overcome the language barrier
than it would take a young child. But 1 am
conscious that I need to achieve this goal
before I can find a job in the I Jnited States 1
just hope the schoolchildren under the bilin
gual education program don't have to strug
gle to learn English my way.
In Shanghai, "bilingual education" is
becoming so popular that parents are willing
to pay astronomically high tuition to get their
children into "bilingual schools," as opposed
to ordinary tuition-free public schools. All
these bilingual schtxils have one thing in
common: they teach students English
through English instruction. The best school,
which costs $ I.(K M) a month, teaches subjects
like math and history in English only. And
the Shanghai people who can't afford "bilin
gual education" call it "American school"
with envy.

Weiye Tang is a master's student in media
studies. He wishes that he could have gone
through "bilingual education" in China at a
very young age.
