Stop whining, Alpha Sig
I'm sick of hearing the residents of
Alpha Sig whine about the "loss" of their
house. Whether or not you agree with the
University's decision to house Greek orga
nizations, it's a done deal — take it as given.
The University clearly cannot quickly build
more dorms, so some moderate-sized hous
es must be converted to fraternity or soror
ity residences.
Here's another fact: nobody wants to let
go of the wonderful housing memories he
or she has worked so hard to create. So if a
truly representative group of students were
brought together to discuss which houses
should "go Greek" a consensus would
never have been reached. Residential Edu
cation took authority where authority was
needed in order to get things done.
But what really gets me about the uproar
over this nonissue is that no one is kicking
you out of your house! I don't see anyone
dragging furniture out of Alpha Sigma and
ATO. None of you were guaranteed a spot
back in Alpha Sig next year: University pol
icy requires you to renew your housing con
tract every year through the Draw.
So instead of whining about how the
I 'niversity is destroying your livelihood, go
out and make the best memories you can
with your house this spring. Revel in the
great community you've got while it lasts.
And deal with the fact that it wasn't going to
continue on next year anyway, whether a
sorority is going to live there or not. Hey.

you could end up like me and draw well
above 28(K).
If you made such a great community out
of Alpha Sig this year, I'm sure you can
make the best of whatever the draw throws
you next year.

I'm glad to see ;i frenetic discussion of
housing. Residential Education, co-ops and
the Greek community. The discussion gives
us cause to reflect on the less tangible bene
fits and more fundamental goals of Univer
sity life. Living situations and our associa
tions in college should challenge us to form
a philosophy on life. This fact is at the cen
ter of the curent Res Ed / student dispute.
Res E:d, many of us think you are wrong
because you are de-emphasizing the part of
college life that many of us love: the chal
lenge of building and relying on a commu
nity. and watching it grow and change.
I live in a co-op because I believe in this
challenge, and I believe in the power of
community. I am president of Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity for the same reasons. Thurs
day. Wendy Lee challenged housed Greeks
to really mess with stereotypes by being a
co-op. I (with my four drawmates. all Phi
Psis) am living this challenge as much as
Res Ed allows me to. Phi Psi is seeking a

house, and we did ask about the possibility
of being a co-op, but this is against the rules.
The University is stereotypically not willing
to trust a Cireek organization with the
responsibility of being a co-op.
When comparing herself to her freshman
friends, now Greek, Lee said they were all
"looking for the same thing after [their) first
year at Stanford: a community whose values
[they] could embrace, a community that
[they] belonged to." She is absolutely right.
While she did not understand why anyone
would stay in what she sees as a "club." my
fraternity is a group of men whom I respect
for their intelligence, compassion, high ide
als. awareness and sense of brotherhood.
No one can understand brotherhood
without experiencing it. just as a co-op's
community is something no one can under
stand without living in one. Rather than
asking myself why I've stayed with my fra
ternity, I ask myself why more men aren't
here with me. I cannot imagine leaving.
I am one of the lucky Stanford students
who has found a community that helps him
grow and change. I love my fraternity just as
much as anyone loves his or her co-op. I
honor and salute those who feel strongly
about their own community, be it Synergy,
Alpha Sig. or anything else. Res Ed needs
to understand this, and in choosing the
nature of changes in the housing system at
Stanford, it must take the strength of our
communities into careful consideration.

Fix grad housing crunch
Since off-campus rents have been
increasing steeply over the past few years
with no end in sight, on-campus housing has
never been more necessary. Koughlv H(X)
graduate students were wait-listed for hous
ing last May, with 591 of them still without
housing after the second round in July.
Forced off campus, this latter group had to
contend with vacancy rates approaching 0
percent, and a mushrooming, well-paid Sili
con Valley population that has pushed the
price of what little housing there was well
beyond the range of a graduate stipend.
Since Silicon Valley and the biotech
industry are unlikely to vanish in the fore
seeable future, a long-term solution to the
graduate housing crisis is required. The rec
ommendations announced by the housing
committee make, at best, indirect progress
towards such a goal. The proposals confine
themselves to cramming a larger number of
students into the same physical space, while
juggling on-campus rents to make the
resulting overcrowded rooms appear more
enticing to graduate students.
As such, the recommendations garnered
only tepid support from the housing com
mittee's student members, and then only
with the explicit understanding that they
were a short-term solution.
Graduate students arc willing to com
promise, but in the long run the only feasi
ble solution to the graduate housing short
age is to build more housing. However, if

such long-term solutions are being consid
ered, students are not privy to the delibera
tions. In the absence of evidence that some
thing other than a quick fix is being envi
sioned, there is the danger that the current
proposals will become the 1990's analog of
the Manzanita trailers. The trailers were
scrapped shortly after celebrating their 26th
year as "temporary" housing.
The ASSIJ Senate is commissioning a
task force to further study the impact of the
housing committee's recommendations.
This task force will work with A SSI J gradu
ate senators, the Graduate Student Council,
student members of the Graduate Housing
Advisory Committee, graduate resident
assistants and other interested graduate stu
dents to formulate a response to these pro
posals.
The task force is tentatively anticipated
to release its findings during the first half of
the spring quarter.

ommendations announced by the housing
committee make, at best, indirect progress
towards such a goal. The proposals confine
themselves to cramming a larger number of
students into the same physical space, while
juggling on-campus rents to make the
resulting overcrowded rooms appear more
enticing to graduate students.
As such, the recommendations garnered
only tepid support from the housing com
mittee's student members, and then only
with the explicit understanding that they
were a short-term solution.
Graduate students arc willing to com
promise, but in the long run the only feasi
ble solution to the graduate housing short
age is to build more housing. However, if

such long-term solutions are being consid
ered, students are not privy to the delibera
tions. In the absence of evidence that some
thing other than a quick fix is being envi
sioned, there is the danger that the current
proposals will become the 1990's analog of
the Manzanita trailers. The trailers were
scrapped shortly after celebrating their 26th
year as "temporary" housing.
The ASSIJ Senate is commissioning a
task force to further study the impact of the
housing committee's recommendations.
This task force will work with A SSI J gradu
ate senators, the Graduate Student Council,
student members of the Graduate Housing
Advisory Committee, graduate resident
assistants and other interested graduate stu
dents to formulate a response to these pro
posals.
The task force is tentatively anticipated
to release its findings during the first half of
the spring quarter.
