250,(XX) American troops and a naval force waiting
in the Persian Gulf, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
and I J.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan reached an agree

provoke serious consequences — including potential air
strikes. Two of Stanford's experts on the Middle East assess
whether the United States should take unilateral action
against Iraq if it violates the current agreement.
