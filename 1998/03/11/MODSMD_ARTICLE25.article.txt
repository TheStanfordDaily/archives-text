# Act if Iraq breaks pledge

SHOULD IK AO now violate the agreement
authorizing inspection, the I J.N. Security Coun
cil will hopefully support the I J.N. Special Com
mission team — known by its acronym UNSCOM
it created and endorse action to compel Iraq's compli
ance. If not. the United States, with Britain, should
act.
Our response could involve air strikes and new
restrictions on commerce. Such a response will unfor
tunately cause further hardship for Iraq's people. But
the risks of tolerating noncompliance far outweigh
those resulting from action. Why is this?
Sympathy has focused on Iraq's beleaguered peo
ple. Consider their recent fate and reflect on their
future under Saddam Hussein. His 1980 invasion of
Iran caused an eight-year war that cost over 250,000
Iraqi and even more Iranian casualties. Thousands of
his own Kurdish citi/ens upon whom he showered
nerve and mustard gas suffered horrible mutilation.
Dr. Christine Gosden from the University of Liver
pool recently inspected some of the affected Kurdish
villages.
Her findings, horrifyingly portrayed on the March
1 edition of "60 Minutes," revealed the continuing
agonies of people whose altered DNA will afflict their
progeny.
UNSCOM discovered 4 tons of Iraqi produced VX
nerve gas plus other conventional weapons and bio
logical agents in enormous quantities. Iraq finally
admitted to filling ballistic missile warheads and
bombs with botulinum. anthrax, and aflatoxin, which
causes liver cancer.
While UNSCOM has overseen destruction of
many of these agents and the facilities that produced
them, the team, staffed by 21 countries and headed by
an Australian, believes their job is incomplete. Iraq's
disclosure documents on chemical and biological
weapons have proven grossly inaccurate.
Critical warhead, missile components, and propel
lant remain unaccounted for, as do 17 tons of growth

media for biological weapons agents and
key items of conventional

weapons production equipment.
Despite glaring publicity and
the grotesque suffering of Iraq's

people, Saddam's evasion and deception of
UNSCOM allows him to fulfill his goal of retain
ing and developing weapons of mass destruction

What does this mean if he is
left to proceed? Think of
Kuwait in 1990, when Saddam

showed poor judgment by invading another
neighbor after nearly losing an eight-year war with

Iran.
Think of his vengeful pillage and the ecological
destruction he wreaked by torching major oil fields.
He used the facade of distorted Baathist Arab nation
alist philosophy to legitimize the grab of any Arab
state.
Saddam regards every state in the region as an
enemy. Scores with Iran remain unsettled. Syrian par
ticipation in Desert Storm enflamed its long feud with
Iraq. Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
states are obvious U.S. collaborators and.in Bagh
dad's view, illegitimate feudal remnants. Jordan made
peace with Israel.
Israel, victim of SCUD missile attacks during
Desert Storm, remains a prime target in Saddam's
quest for greatness.
These factors combine into a nasty and dangerous

heap — prior use of chemical and
biological weapons, grossly ill-judged
invasion of two neighbors, continu
ing vendettas with almost all regional
states, absolute and repeated disre
gard of signed agreements and U.N.
authority.
But an added major factor
is Iraq's potentially great financial

power once oil production is fully restored. Such pro
duction would fund the re-establishment of significant
military capability.
The irresponsible course is gambling that
Saddam will not once again succumb to his megalo
maniacal dreams of expansion or unleash the horrors
of hell on his own Kurds or Shiites. For if he should,
the loudest voices now calling for protection of Iraq's
people will be the first to accuse the United States of
treacherous desertion of the Iraqis we have quasi-pro
tected since Desert Storm.
And if lie should use weapons of mass destruction
on a regional state, his people will suffer retaliatory
devastation beyond imagination or comparison to the

collateral damage of a U.S. bombing campaign.
I his is the choice. Stick to the UNSCOM mandate
and persevere in containment of Iraq's power, or
allow Saddam to wiggle free of sanctions and rebuild
a formidable military force that will have to be con-

fronted at far greater cost.
Which option is kinder to Iraq's people?
Why do other nations shrink from supporting
action? Clearly. Baghdad's neighbors
retribution and nationalist backlash in their own \
streets. Russia, Iraq's Cold War mentor, looks I
for repayment of billions owed and lucrative *

future oil-related
and weapons
contracts.
France, also

owed debt by Baghdad, also seeks financial opportu
nity and shares Russia's innate distaste for U.S. lead
ership.
II the Americans and the British can he counted on
to do the necessary job. why join them and suffer the
backlash?
1 here will be no John Wayne ending to this tragic
saga nothing neat and definitive with a responsible
democratic government springing forth in Baghdad.
Each step in containing Iraq's military ambitions will
have costs.
No step should be avoided simply because it will
not produce a definitive resolution.
