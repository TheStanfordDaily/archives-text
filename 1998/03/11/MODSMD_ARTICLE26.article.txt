THF. immediate danger of U.S. air strikes
against Iraq has been averted by the agree
ment negotiated by U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan and endorsed by a Security Council res
olution.
This resolution pointedly did not include lan
guage authorizing an automatic military response if
Iraq fails to comply with the agreement. Sueh a pro
vision was opposed by most of the Security Council,
including a majority of its permanent members, led
by China, France and Russia.
Brazil's representative affirmed that there was
"great resistance" to language that would authorize
an automatic U.S. attack on Iraq.
He added that "the majority of the Council has
the view that the authority of the Council is still
needed for any military action" (The New York
Times. March 4. 1998).
Nonetheless, the day after the Security Council
adopted its resolution. President Clinton and admin
istration spokespersons argued that the resolution

provided the authority for the United
States to undertake unilateral military
action.

This is consistent with U.S. policy
towards Iraq since the 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. Presidents Bush and
Clinton have consistently argued
that U.N. resolutions must be

scrupulously obeyed. In fact.
Washington has pursued its
,qwn very narrowly conceived
interests.

Saddam Hussein is a cruel
and brutal dictator. His
rule is a menace
to his own

people and to his neighbors. The occupation of
Kuwait was a particularly blatant act of aggression
that allowed President Bush to secure an interna
tional consensus for attacking Iraq.
But there was no such consensus for a I '.S.-led air
strike against Iraq before the agreement negotiated
by Kofi Annan. And there is no consensus appoint
ing the United States as the unilateral enforcer of
the agreement. The international consensus forged
by the Gulf War has collapsed because Clinton's
Middle Fast polic> of "dual containment'" of Iraq
and Iran is a failure.
It has virtually no support from I'.S. allies in
Europe or the Middle East. Most of the Arab world
sees Israel as a greater security threat than either
Iran or Iraq
Lopsided support for Israeli intransigence in the

Arab-Israeli peace negotiations has
diminished U.S. credibility in the
Middle East, even in friendly Arab
states like Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
U.S. insistence on the sanctity of
U.N. resolutions is considered hyp
ocritical because the United States
does not act against Israeli viola
tions of dozens of U.N. resolutions

or Turkey's continuing occupation of Cyprus.
The United States does not speak out against
Israel's possession of nuclear weapons or its refusal
to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, matters
which greatly concern Israel's neighbors.
The United States does not campaign against the
Turkish government for viciously attacking its Kur
dish citizens. Nor does it impose any penalty on
Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil-exporting states
that regularly violate the human rights of their own
citizens.
A military strike against Iraq based solely on U.S.
determination that the recent agreement has been
violated would contradict the intention of the major
ity of the U.N. Security Council. It would have no
moral authority. And it would be unlikely to achieve
any worthwhile objective.
I '.S. military action would probably cause numer
ous casualties among innocent civilians who are
already suffering from the harshest sanctions ever
imposed on a country .
It would enrage Arab public opinion and might
destabilize important pro-American Arab states like
Egypt and Jordan. It would create tensions with
Russia.
Saddam would very likely remain in power after
any military action. He might respond to a U.S.
attack by expelling U.N. inspection teams from Iraq
altogether, thus reducing rather than enhancing,
international supervision of Iraq's military arsenal.

Finally, unilateral military action would
confirm that the operative I S. policy
in the Middle East is. as Bush

put it after the Gulf War.
"What we say goes."
This may work for a short
while because there is now
no country with the means or

[he will to challenge the United

States.
In the long run. such a policy will

certain!) increase the already considerable
I' S. isolation in the Middle East and make fur-

ther military action more likely in the future.
Rather than sulking about their wounded pride
and threatening military strikes. Clinton administra
tion officials would do better to reconsider their
Middle East policy.
The United States should actively support a just
Arab-Israel peace including the right of the Pales
tinian people to self-determination and full Israeli
withdrawal from S\ria and Lebanon in exchange for
contractual peace treaties.
A Middle East policy based on support for the
human and political rights and economic develop
ment of all the peoples in the region will diminish
the need to resort to military force over the long run.
