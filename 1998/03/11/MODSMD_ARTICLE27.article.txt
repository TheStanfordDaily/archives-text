eDear Health Forum,
My father recently had a coronary artery
bypass graft and I was wondering if you
could provide more insight as to what that
procedure entails. Thanks.

Dear Mr. Chun,
A There are several different factors that
might contribute to a patient needing to
have heart surgery. The most common rea
son. however, is probably arteriosclerosis
induced by environment and diet.
This is usually due to lifestyle choices which
damage the cardiovascular system over several
years. Some of the most common are: a diet high in
saturated fat and cholesterol, a highly sedentary
lifestyle, being overweight, little or no routine car
diovascular exercise and routinely high levels of
stress and pressure.
Over an extended period of time, these factors
stress the capacity of an otherwise healthy human
heart to function properly. The damage impairs
blood flow to the heart. As the organ responsible
for supplying every system of the body with nour
ishing blood, a short "pause" in blood flow to car
diac muscle is a very big deal.
This condition usually sets the stage for a heart
attack. In order to facilitate blood flow to the heart,
a patient's doctor might recommend what is
referred to as a coronary artery bypass graft
(CABG, pronounced "cabbage"), better known as
a bypass.
In this procedure a surgeon determines which
blood flow pathways to the heart are in need of the
most help. Typically, the surgeon attaches a supple
mentary artery which circumvents the clogged sec
tion of the original coronary artery.
Thus, the new piece of artery "bypasses" the
clogged section of the original artery — a coronary
detour, so to speak. If the surgery is successful,
blood flow is restored to the heart via the new graft.
