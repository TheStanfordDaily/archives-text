## Chips streamline digital cameras 
### Armen Berjikly 
In just a few years, digital cameras have
become a widespread supplement to, if not a
replacement for. traditional film cameras.
Although wildly popular, these cameras' short
comings — high power consumption, limited qual
ity and relatively expensive cost — have limited
their applications.
Led by Electrical Engineering Prof. Abbas El
Gamal, research associate Boyd Fowler, and grad
uate student David Yang, the Image Sensor
Group at Stanford has pioneered a microchip that
addresses these shortcomings by combining image
capture and processing on a single chip. The prod
uct of their research, now undergoing testing, is a
"smart" digital camera chip that aims to make dig
ital cameras cheaper, better and far more perva
sive.
Current digital cameras use a passive matrix
architecture, in which light is captured by an ana
log sensor. This output is converted into a digital
format and passed on to other chips for processing
functions such as color balancing and image com
pression. This multiple chip design produces cam
eras that are expensive and consume large
amounts of power. More importantly, it lowers
quality and the camera's ability to function.
While simply merging many of the processing
chips with the sensor itself is feasible and marked
ly improves digital cameras. El Gamal believes
that it does not "fully exploit the possible advan
tages of integration." For this reason, the group
has not only merged the chips, but actually moved
the image processing much closer to the image
capture, onto the pixel level.
Since signals are not subject to conversion from
analog to digital format and because the distance
the signal needs to travel is minimized, digital
cameras using integrated chips will exhibit
improved image quality. Additionally, the tech
nology will minimize power consumption and pro
duction costs.
There are many potential applications for these
integrated chips. In addition to digital photogra
phy, the chips could be used in self-driving auto
mobiles armed with inexpensive cameras pro
grammed to "look for"the contrast between
asphalt and lane markers. ATM machines could
reliably identify people by using these chips to
scan for distinguishing features on a person's face.
"This will be the product for anywhere you
need high volume, high quality and low cost imag
ing," El Gamal said.
