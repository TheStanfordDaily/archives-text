# THE NEXT DIMENSION OF COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN

Stanford's Center for Integrated
Facilities Engineering (CIFE) is a rela
tively unnoticed part of the University,
but its research, which focuses on effi
cient design and construction of physical
structures, has not gone unnoticed. The
center's fundamental mission is to apply
advances in information technologies to
the construction industry.
Founded in 19K8, the CIFE is
arguably the world's foremost pioneer in
this emerging field. "CIFE has become
recognized around the world as a leader
in the application of information tech
nology in the construction industry,"
said James Gibbons, former dean of the
School of Engineering.
The CIFE has adroitly harnessed the
current explosion in information tech
nologies for use in the construction of
buildings. While producing tangible and
astonishing advances in its 10 years of
existence, the center is continually dis
covering new methods to improve the
way buildings are built.
The influence of the center's discov
eries is broad and wide-reaching. In the
past 10 years it has focused primarily on
development of computer tools to
improve the efficiency of design and
construction processes, and improve
ment in the methods of managing these
tools.
One exciting innovation in computer
tools that CIFE has developed is termed
4-D CAD (Computer-Aided Design). 4-
D CAD incorporates the additional
dimension of time to standard CAD pro
cesses. It was developed by Civil Engi
neering Frof. Martin Fischer and John
Kunz, a senior research engineer ui civil

engineering, in collaboration with Com
puter Science Prof. Terry Winogard.
The process allows engineers to cre
ate a series of linked 3-D models,
Depicting various stages of the construc-

lion process, these models allow man
agers to better plan and coordinate con
struction efforts.
As the intra-departmental coopera
tion for the development of the 4-1)
CAD suggests, the (Jj L encourages

collaboration between civil engineers
and computer scientists. This ensures
that the CIFE employs and incorporate l
experts from both fields in its research
and development enterprises.

"Instead of trying to do this ourselves,
as amateurs, we have established collab
orations with top computer scientists."
said Civil Engineering Prof. Raymond
Levitt, associate director of the CIFE.
"A number of places have taken the

whole do-it-yourself approach."
Previous projects at the ( II I' includ
ed the development ol improved plant
maintenance systems. A team of (II I
researchers including Barbara Hayes-
Roth. a senior research engineer at the
Stanford Knowledge Systems Faborato
ry. created a computer program that per
forms a plant maintenance evaluation
while calculating the most optimal time
for part repair or replacement.
Another team of ( IFF researchers
and Computer Science Professor Jean-
Claude Latombe developed a method
which drastically improves the efficiency
of pipe routing in industrial facilities.
In place ol rerouting pipe layouts dm
ing the design process, the method uses
techniques developed by Fatombe in
which mobile robots plot the best path for
repair using a high-powered computer
program.
Other projects reflect the growing
importance of the Internet and the
World Wide Web on commerce and.in
particular, on the construction industry
Efficient purchase and timely delivery ol
parts can significantly reduce ovetall
construction costs; projects underway
seek to use the Web to accomplish this
One such project w ill allow engineers
to create a 3-1) CAD model of a buildun
and then seamlessly connect the model
to online vendor catalogs. Another pi"
ject expedites the building permit appli
cation process Ihe program checks the
3-D CAD model of a building for com
pliance with local buildinu and disabled
access codes.
rhe ( 111 consistently stresses the
influence of information technology in
all its endeavors Current design models
are changing irrevocably to reflect this
change in technology
