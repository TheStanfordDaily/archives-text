from Kimball Hall. Residents of
Toyon Hall asked that it not be con

More than a dozen speakers ad
dressed the crowd, expressing their

bitterest criticism at Res Ed Director
Jane Camarillo.
"Last week she came into our
house as a guest and spat in our
faces," one protester said, recounting
a meeting in which Camarillo in
formed Alpha Sig residents of the
housing changes.
Three of the speakers were mem
bers of the Disabled Students group,
who addressed issues of disability ac
cess.
The group wants to ensure that

mobility-impaired freshmen are not
kept out of Kimball, which is "the
most accessible dorm on campus,"
according to junior Dan Davis, one of
the leaders of the Disabled Students'
housing campaign.
Davis fears that such an exclusion
could lead to "social isolation" for
mobility-impaired freshmen.
"There are not many dorms on
campus where mobility-impaired
students can live comfortably," he
said.

In addition, the group wants to
make sure that mobility-impaired
students — who are currently unable
to live inToyon, Davis said — are not
denied the chance to live in a sopho
more-only community.
"We're hoping that Res Ed will
rethink the proposed housing
changes in light of disabled students'
needs," Davis said.
