# Radar revolutionizes study or Earth’s surface
## Scientists can now measure minute changes in topography using satellites 
### Daniel Wan Contributing writer 
Studying the Earth's myriad geophysical fea
tures is a complex and difficult endeavor. But a new
technology called Synthetic Aperture Radar inter
ferometry promises to make doing so a little easier.
By using radar images taken from space, SAR can
track tiny movements on the Earth's surface, like
the flow of a glacier or the movement of an earth
quake fault system.
Developed hy a team of scientists including
Howard Zebker, associate professor of geophysics
and electrical engineering, SAR interferometry can
even detect quarter-inch surges in a volcano's lava
dome. These measurements can be used to predict

the likelihood of a volcanic eruption.
"This will revolutionize the way we look
at the Earth." said Assoc. Prof, of

Geophysics Paul Segal!
SAR was the result
of adaptations
made in a radar
technique
used to map
the sur
face of

Venus. At first, SAR was only used to create
detailed three-dimensional topographical maps of
the Earth's surface. Zebker was one of the first sci
entists to use SAR to detect and track the move
ment of fast-moving ocean currents and large areas
of land.
The incredible sensitivity of this technique was
demonstrated in several radar images taken of
farmland in California's Imperial Valley. Before
the farmers irrigated them, they were uniformly
flat.
After they were irrigated, the water underneath
expanded the surface of the soil and elevated it by
a little less than half an inch. On the radar image,
these changes caused the plots to appear as square,
fluffed pillows.
"This doesn't replace measurements »hat scien
tists take on the ground." Zebker said "Radar only
shows the surface, and a lot of the interesting things
about earthquakes and volcanoes require detecting
what goes on underground. Hut this technique does
allow us to measure some things we haven't been
able to measure before."

Glaciologists were the first to take advantage of
this radar technique, using it to study ice move
ments. Others like Segall use it to study volcanoes
such as the kilauea volcano in Hawaii. Segall and
his students initially established a network of Glob
al Positioning System instruments along the sides of

the volcano. By analyzing
the collected GPS data,
k they were able to determine
' how the shape of the volcano
was changing as a result of its
lava flow.
Thev are now trying to

incorporate SAR interferome
trv into their studies so as to pro
vide data on

areas of the
volcano that
are too dan
gerous for
researchers to tra
verse. Whereas Segall
and his team can only
observe changes at the spots
where they placed their instru
ments. SAR can track changes occur
ring across the entire surface of the area
of interest, even in the worst conditions
"With previous methods we could onl\ tell
what was happening after we went back and ana
lyzed our data. This is so visual that you can almost
see it moving." Segall said.
Perhaps

the most .

pictures taken
before and after the
magnitude 7.3
Landers Earthquake in
Southern California.
The study not only
showed how the surface
changed around the
epicenter, but also ho\s
pressure was relaxed
in a network oi neigh
boring faults in the
months following the
earthquake.
No other tech
nique is capable of
studying continuous

changes in anything i»s large as an earthquake fault
system.
Eventually. Zebker envisions a satellite cirJin:'
the planet, continuous!) snapping pictures I
glaciers, earthquake fault s\stems and \oleanoe>
Each image would be generated b\ a computer
from the radar waves bounced back from the sur
face. This satellite would return to the same region
once every two weeks and snap another picture
from a slightly different angle.
By comparing these pictures, scientists will K
able to detect movements as little as a quart, r uu h
and perhaps determine whethet a volcano is about
to erupt, how much stress is present along a fault
and how the Antarctic ice sheet is changing I his
information is important in tracking the rising sea
levels and the changes in global climate patterns
Currently, the United States does not have am
civilian satellites equipped with SAR intcrferome
try instruments. Canada. Japan and the 1 uropean
Space Agency just recently launched satellites with
radar capabilities.
Two versions of an S\R satellite have been
proposed to NASA, and Zebker hopes that one
will be launched in the near future. In the mean
time. he continues to improve \K intcrferome
try by working on methods to minimize image dis
tortions caused b\ water vapor and the Faith's
ionosphere.
As the technology continues to improve. "We'll
be able to ask questions we haven't even thought of
asking before." Segall said.
