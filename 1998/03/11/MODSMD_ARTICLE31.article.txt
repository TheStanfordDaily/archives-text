# Search for new dean begins
## 
### Will Chang 
The University is beginning its
search for a successor to John
Shoven, the current dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
He will be stepping down at the end
of this year.
Prior to March 20, all Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff are invited to
nominate a tenured professor whom
they think would be appropriate for
the position via e-mail to the commit
tee at kathy@sherlock. Only tenured
faculty members are eligible for nom
inations. The committee is looking
for nominees who are not only effec
tive teachers, but also someone with a

positive interaction in the Stanford
community with a leadership or ad
ministrative background.
"This may sound trite, but the
dean should be a well-respected, nice
guy," said former ASSU President
Bill Shen, one of two student mem
bers on the committee.
"The committee is linking for a
faculty person who can be both an
academic leader of the schtx)l as well
as a manager for important issues,"
said Kathryn Gillam, associate
provost for faculty affairs.
After all the nominations are re
ceived, the committee will screen the
submissions for their final recom
mendations to University President

Gerhard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice, who will make the
final decisions. The committee is
made up of faculty from a variety of
departments and Kevin Iga, a mas
ter's student in mathematics and
