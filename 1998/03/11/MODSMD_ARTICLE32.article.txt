## 
### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
The winds of Tibet — known as "the rooftop of the
world" — blew strongly at Bechtel International Center
Monday afternoon when the Dalai Lama's younger sis
ter discussed the region's political situation.
Jetsun Pema is an important figure in the Tibetan
community, of which her brother is the spiritual leader.
Well known for her work with the exile community from
Tibet, Pema was also the first female minister in the Ti
betan democratic government in 1990.
Pema's speech was strongly colored by her personal
experience with the Chinese occupation of Tibet. "I'm
not a historian," she said. "I travel around and talk with
people interested in Tibet's situation. We are living
through the darkest period in Tibetan history.
"Tibet was an independent country, with its own gov
ernment and territory before the invasion in 1949, ac
cording to international laws," she said.
In 1959, the first uprising against Chinese rule oc
curred at the capital of Lhasa, and many were either ex
iled or escaped. Pema left when she was 9 years old and
was raised by Irish Catholic nuns in India.
"The Chinese government encouraged Chinese settle
ment. and the population in Tibet is now 7.5 million Chi
nese and 6 million Tibetan," she said. "We are already a

minority in our own country. Violations of human rights
arc all too common in Tibet. Since we feel it is very im
portant to preserve our culture and identity, we aim to
give our youth a good education that is both modern and
deeply rooted in our culture and religion."
Today, there are five Tibetan schools in neighboring
India, where 1 (K).(KK) of the 131,000 refugees live. About
27,(XM) of these are children who were smuggled out of
the country. "In one school, as much as 6() percent of the
students had been smuggled out of Tibet." Pema said.
The Tibetan government currently operates out of
India, which "was kind enough to give the Tibetans land
and financial support," Pema said.
"Most Tibetans are looking for a middle way. one
that will be in the interest of Chinese and Tibetans alike.
Choosing a violent attitude would be suicide. Too many
young people have lost their lives," Pema said.
"I never thought of [the Dalai Lama| as my brother,
you know," said Pema. "He's my guru. He has directed
me in many ways, but I only go to him when I have a
problem."
Chris Callison-Burch. a sophomore and Friends of
Tibet organizer of the speech, said Pema was on a book
signing tour for her autobiography titled. "Tibet: My
Story."
"However, her main goal is to let people know about
the situation of her country," he said.
