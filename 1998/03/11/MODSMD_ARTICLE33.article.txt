# Hearings officer sides with University in case
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
In an HK-page report, a hearings officer largely sided
with the University on disputed facts related to the dis
missal of Psychiatry Prof. Adolt Pfefferbaum.
UC-San Francisco Law Prof. Richard Marcus se
lected as an independent hearings officer by the Acade
mic Council's Advisory Board offered neither "yes"
nor "no" answers to six questions posed by the board,
instead seeking to provide guidance for the board s de
cision. In further hearings yet to be scheduled, the board
will determine whether University President Gerhard
Casper has grounds to dismiss Pfefferbaum.
Pfefferbaum retired from a position at the Palo Alto
Veterans Affairs Hospital in 1996. an action that the
University considered to constitute retirement from his
Stanford professorship as well. Pfefferbaum and a Santa
Clara County judge disagreed, sparking the formal dis
missal proceedings.
In his final report. Marcus mentioned several times
his concern that much of the testimony related to dis
putes outside the advisory board's request.
"I sense that these parties have a variety of disputes
that have little to do with the six issues actually before
me," he wrote. "The parties' appetite for such inquire
(into other issues) tended on occasion to exceed that
need for background."
In addition. Marcus said he considered witnesses' be
havior in determining how to weigh their testimony
"From time to time below, I reject claims made by
witnesses," he wrote. "In part, these decisions are based
on their demeanor and behavior."
Marcus also noted that he had followed the board's
instruction to place the burden of producing "highh
convincing evidence" on the University "only if I first
conclude that Dr. Pfefferbaum has produced some evi
dence' to support his position." Marcus found that Pfef
ferbaum failed to provide sufficient evidence.
Pfefferbauni's lawyer. Pete McC'loskey. said the find
ings "reflect the position of the institution that has paid
him."
The University's lawyer, Eli (iould. declined to com
ment.
Without Compensation status
The advisory board first asked whether the VA hos
pital normally would have denied a request by Stanford
to allow Pfefferbaum to continue his work at the hospi
tal on "without compensation" status.
In fact. Marcus determined, history showed that
Stanford does not involve itself with such requests. lea\
mg the responsibility with individual doctors.
Furthermore, Pfefferbaum wrongly argued that he
had been granted unlimited without compensation sta
tus and that Stanford intervened in having that status
capped at Nov. 15. 19%. Marcus said. Evidence also
showed, he added, that the VA hospital had no interest
in either granting Pfefferbaum an unlimited status
change or keeping him at the hospital.
"The University has established by highly convincing
evidence that [the VA hospital] would have denied a re
quest by the Medical School to let Dr. Pfefferbaum con
tinue his work on a WOC basis... following his retire
ment in July of 19% after Nov. 15.19%," Marcus con
cluded.
Research space and staff
The second set of disputed issues regarded whether
Pfefferbaum's research space and staff were cut unrea
sonably after he left his position as deput\ chief of staff

for the VA hospital.
Much of the testimony on the space issue relied on es
timates. Marcus noted, resulting in great differences of
opinion about how much space was involved.
Comparison of estimates indicates that the change in
Pfefferhaum's job responsibilities "only had a small
bearing on his space." Marcus writes.
At most, he concluded. Pfefferbaum lost only 1.5 per
cent of his total research space, a change he found to be
unimportant "in light ol the fact that no proot was of
fered of any specific negative consequence for Dr. Pfef
ferbaum s research resulting from reduction in his
space."
With regard to research stall. Pfefferbaum failed to
indicate that his level ol lunding should have continued,
as stall doing research rather than clinical work were
being cut by the VA hospital administration because of
budget constraints. Marcus wrote.
"I see no reasonable basis for concluding that Dr. Pf
efferbaum was treated differently from anyone else in
regard to clinical funding of other members of his re
search staff. Mi reus concluded: in tact, the I 'niversity
demonstrated the contrary
Consulting services
A delay in approving Pfefferbaum's request to per
form outside consulting resulted from an inexperienced
administration and from Pfefferhaum's stubbornness
rather than from .1 concerted effort to treat him dilter
ently. Marcus said
When the request came up. Psychiatry Prof. Ir.t (1 lick
had just replaced Pfefferbaum as deputy chief of staff at
the VA hospital A delay in its approval. Marcus wrote,
"resulted from the presence ol Dr. Click as a new per
son in the [deput\ chief ol staff) position and from Dr.
Pfefferbaum's obdurate refusal to answer Dr. Click's
questions."
Another professor who had made a request, Jared
Tinklenberg. had answered Click's questions as to the
nature of his outside work, at which point his request
was approved. Marcus noted. Pfefferbaum repeatedly
declined to provide inlormation to (ilick.
"Dr. Click was not acting in bad faith or discrimina
tory in asking for more information." Marcus said.
Dissemination of communication
The final two disputed facts in\ol\ed dissemination
of communications regarding Pfefferbaum's behavior
Pfefferbaum contended that a letter of counseling about
his behavior and a proficiency report had been circulat
ed beyond appropriate channels.
Pfefferbaum failed to pnnidc evidence that then-
VA Hospital Chief ot Stall Richard Mazze had arculat
ed the proficiency report. Marcus determined. Mc-
Closkey "conceded that there was no evidence at all of
alleged dissemination of the proficiency report to any -
one other than Dr. Click." he wrote, adding that evi
dence failed to show that even Click had received a
copy.
Prior instances dealing with circulation ot letters of
counseling were not relevant to Pfefferbaum's case.
Marcus said. Normal handling of a letter would not in
volve disclosure to anvone but the affected employee.
Marcus noted, but "the circumstances surrounding this
episode were different because Stanford involved.
" I'he evidence is highl\ persuasive that Stanford had
a legitimate interest in matter that might lead to the ter
mination of a Stanford professor." Marcus concluded,
so the dissemination ot the letter to Psvehiatry Prot
Jerome Yesavage- acting as the I niversity s liaison
was not inappropriate.
