# Toyon changes provoke thoughts on eating clubs
## Goodbye, freshmen 
### Sonya Schneider 
Nick Peters, the general manager of the
Toyon Eating Clubs, leans hack into his
chair. Inside his office — located at the
heart of the eating clubs — Peters reflects
on the changing nature of Stanford dorm
life. Seven years ago, he was a freshman in
Toyon Hall. Now, Peters must look forward
to life without any freshmen at all.
Last week, the Office of Residential Ed
ucation announced that Toyon, now a four
class dorm, will become all-sophomore next
year. The decision was hard to accept, Pe
ters said. However, it didn't come as a com
plete shock.
"We've known that the eating clubs have
been under close scrutiny for a while," Pe
ters said. "But it wasn't until last week,
when we got a call from [ Director] of Hous
ing and Dining Keith Guy, that we knew
things were definitely going to be differ
ent."
Housing and Dining could not be
reached for comment.
The eating clubs provide food and a
unique social atmosphere for Toyon resi
dents and graduate students. They have
been in existence for 104 years and have ac
quired the reputation for offering delicious
food and great atmosphere, Peters said.
Their history of partying, compounded
with the imperfect physical state of the
building — which was erected in 1953 — has
created a precarious situation for the eating
clubs.

Starting next fall, things will have to
change, Peters said.
"We have a reputation of being indepen
dent and running things according to our
own agenda," Peters said. "Hut we know
that this is the time to prove that we can sur
vive. We have to show that we are an inte
gral part of the Stanford community."
Today, the unique structure of Toyon
extends into the eating clubs. ()ver 4(H) stu
dents gather for each meal. They also meet
outside for Friday afternoon gatherings,
called TGIFs; they enjoy sunset barbecues
and dances. However, the eating clubs cur
rently remain a separate entity from Toyon.
One of the main objectives for next year
is to combine Toyon and the eating clubs
into one dynamic community.
"If we can combine the activities of the
dorm itself with those of the eating club, we
will be really excited," Peters said.
Jean Chi, head advising associate at
Toyon, agreed.
" The eating club staff are so busy with
organizing their own programs and prepar
ing the food, but they are always very coop
erative and supportive.
"It would be wonderful to work in con
junction with them. This might be the right
opportunity," she said.
Another focus of the eating clubs will be
to incorporate a greater academic atmos
phere into its environment. Peters and his
staff are meeting with Lori White, director
of the Undergraduate Advising Center,
Vice Provost for Student Affairs James

Montoya, among others.in order to plan
different ways of integrating faculty into the
daily atmosphere. Specifically, they are
looking to invite those teachers and teach
ing associates who will be instructing sopho
mores to join them at meals and various
functions.
"What better way to learn than at the
dining room table?" Peters asked.
"We expect that the changes will lake a
few years," Peters said, "but we have no
doubt that this new atmosphere will en
hance the intimacy and large social base
that the eating clubs have worked hard to
ward promoting."
Peters is not sure what will happen with
out the freshmen next year. He fears that
they might be missing out on the unique ex
perience he had of learning from an eclectic
group of people of all ages. He said he also
worries that sophomores may come into
Toyon with large Draw groups, making
them less inclined to meet new people.
However, he sees no reason why this will
negatively affect the future of the eating
clubs.
"After all. what we're really about is
good food and great memories," he said.
"We exist because the students want us to.
If we can find a balance between the rigor
ous academic curriculum and the more re
laxed social atmosphere, we're going to be
successful.
"If we can prove that this place is fun and
stimulating, we will be living out our biggest
hope."
