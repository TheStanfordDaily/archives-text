# Black student groups discuss need for change
## 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
C ommunity activism and the need for
change were the main topics of discussion at
a town hall meeting of about 200 students
from various Hay Area black student groups
Friday night in the Tresidder Oak Lounge.
The meeting was organized by Stanford
black student organizations, including the
Black Student Union and The lime is Now.
The organizers of the event wanted to high
light and address issues of institutional
racism on college campuses, as well as ac
tions that could be taken to remedy these is
sues.
Last November, the University would
not agree to cover a speech by former Na
tion of Islam spokesman Khallid Abdul
Muhammad under its insurance plan — an
action that many students saw as censorship.
This was an example of the institutional
racism that students wanted to address.
A video recording of a speech given by
Muhammad at Fresno State University was
shown in the Ujamaa lounge on Thursday
night.
"We are issuing a challenge to students,
faculty and the administration to recognize
an end to the pervasive racism and discrimi
nation that continually relegates us to a sta
tus of second-class citizens," said senior
Mundi Attinasi. BSU president.
The students issued a list of 10 "demands
for change." including an increase in the
number of black tenured faculty, an end to
discriminatory police misconduct on cam
pus. the permanent inclusion of affirmative
action in the University's mission statement,
and the development of an African and
Afro-American Studies department.
The meeting continued until 11:30 p.m..
with students and faculty members dis
cussing ways to strengthen ties between the
two groups to work for change in the Uni
versity.
Students also discussed the building of
cross-campus coalitions and the need for
more dialogue between students from dif
ferent campuses.
"There is definitely a general need for
black students to become involved in the
problems that the University has: black fac
ulty hiring, black student retention and the
lack ol black students on administrative
boards," Attinasi said.
The meeting "was needed to let students
see there are things to be done." she added.
Panel speakers at the event included a
professor from San Jose State University.
Stanford Multicultural Affairs Director
Sally Dickson, students from other Ba\
Area schools and representatives of the Na
tion of Islam.

The Rev. Keith Muhammad of the Na
tion of Islam challenged students to consid
er why they had come to college.
"Most will say, 'I came because I wanted
to get a good job.' " he said. "We live in a so
ciety where greed for short-term profits has
generated an entire society devoid of val
ues."
But he encouraged students to reflect on
the history and current condition of blacks
in America and use their educations for the
purpose of "nation-building."
"In 1555, we were brought he.e for one
reason alone. In that time there was 100-per
cent employment, and you did not need a re
sume." he said. "So if our only concept of
education is jobs, we're making a grave mis
take."
San Jose State Political Science Prof.
Cobie Harris agreed with the Rev. Muham
mad.
"We have African-American students
pursuing the American dream of individual
achievement at the expense of collective re
sponsibility." he said. "It seems that a lot of
our students today think you can't do both."
"You have a special responsibility to
begin to take the consciousness of our peo
ple to another stage." he said. "You should
not commit a treason of the intellectuals."
Students from Sonoma State, San Jose
State. San Francisco State. U( -Santa Cruz
and UC-Berkeley all spoke for a few min
utes about institutional racism at their own
campuses, including police discrimination
and the abolition of hip-hop concerts on
campus.
Many students also noted a lack of sup
port from black faculty at their campuses in
their struggles with the administration.
Troy Nkrumah, president of the
African Black Statewide Student Alliance,
emphasized the need for students at differ
ent campuses to support one another. •'Any
time the administration attacks the students
on this campus, they're attacking students
on all the campuses." he said.
Dickson, also a Law School lecturer, said
no one can deny the need for more tenured
black faculty.
"It's a dismal 3 percent (at Stanford)."
she said.
However, it is also a problem of a lack of
black doctoral students, she noted. "We
need more people vsho can compete for
these positions we are talking about."
After listening to the students' descrip
tions of institutional racism on their cam
puses. Malik Zulu Shabaz/ of the Nation of
Islam said. "I see that our students in this
area are catching hell all over."
But he said that he felt there was "a great
new wave of activism that will come out of
this meeting."
