### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
While some students enjoyed Friday's beauti
ful weather studying outside Meyer Library, eight
volunteers from Students for Environmental Ed
ucation were planting trees with 35 East Palo Alto
children at the Stanford Community Farm.
The second and third graders from Green
Oaks Academy, who are taught earth sciences on
a regular basis by SEED volunteers, had a chance
to put their new knowledge about botany to work
by planting trees of their own.
Members of SEF.I). a 40-person group that op
erates out of the Haas Center for Public Service,
teach weekly environmental science classes in
two East Palo Alto elementary schools.
Friday's program brought the students from
Green Oaks Academy to Stanford for the first
time.
Twenty trees, donated by Central Valley Nurs
ery Growers to a nonprofit group called Magic

Inc., were planted by the group.
"It was wonderful to bring the kids to campus..
.. I hey loved running around and seeing the
farm," said freshman volunteer Melissa Neuwelt.
"SEED is great not only because it gives the kids
environmental education that would not normal
ly get into their curriculum, but also because it
brings older students into the classroom as role
models."
SEED coordinator Elliot Campbell added.
"These students get very little science education,
so SEED makes ;i pretty big impact on them and
their teachers."
I he program, which has been in existence for
seven years, educates students on various envi
ronmental themes.
The Stanford students work in groups of fours
and teach the children about subjects such as the
water cycle, agriculture and science issues related
to the East Palo Alto.
The classes that came to campus for the field
trip have recently been learning about food grow-

ing and basic agriculture. Campbell hopes to
spend the summer designing a yearlong project
which would engage the kids involved on a more
long-term basis.
The trip was made possible hy volunteers at
the farm who helped the Stanford students coor
dinate planting the trees.
"What was great about it was that so many
farm volunteers helped out," said SEED co-coor
dinator Not iko Toyota. "It started out as a SEED
and Magic program, but the people at the farm
were so enthusiastic."
Toyota emphasized that they plan to work
with Magic Inc. to coordinate another planting,
hopefully in the East Palo Alto area.
Having trees planted near the Green Oaks
Academy would he beneficial because the stu
dents could take care of them and learn more
about the entire growing process.
Campbell said that the SEED program cur
rently teaches about 2(X) students at elementary
schools in the area but hopes to expand.
