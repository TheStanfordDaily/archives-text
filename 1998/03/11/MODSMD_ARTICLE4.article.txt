remember for a long time.
ABC News' "Nightline" anchor
Ted Koppel has been announced
as this year's Commencement
speaker.
"I'm looking forward to it."
Koppel said. "I feel especially hon

ored and privileged. There's no
way I'm going to turn down an op
portunity to come back here."
The Senior Class presidents dis
tributed a survey to seniors via e
mail fall quarter asking their rec
ommendations for a speaker. Ac
cording to the presidents, Koppel.
Class of '62, was among those at
the top of the list.
"All of the seniors we've talked
to are really excited about it." said
Senior Class President Laudan

Nabizadeh. "I think he's a very re
spected person. We've all growr
up watching him everv night or
TV."
University President (ierhart
Casper has been equally enthusias
tic about this year's speaker.
"I am delighted that we havi
been able to secure I ed Koppel a"
our Commencement speaker.'
Casper said "He unites the desirt
of students to have a national
ly known individual, my desire
to have a speaker with Stan
ford ties and the desire of us all
to have a speaker of both sub
stance and style."
Koppel was born in Lan
cashire, England in 1940. He
moved with his parents to New
York when he was 13 and ex
celled in boarding school. He
began his undergraduate years
at Syracuse University when
he was 16.
Koppel was unfamiliar with
Stanford until his adviser at
Syracuse told him that Stan
ford had a solid program in
mass communications re
search.
"Where and what is Stan
ford?" Koppel asked.
"He told me it was in Cali
fornia, and that was all I need
ed to hear."
Koppel went on to receive
his master's in mass communi
cations research and political
science from Stanford. He
wrote his dissertation on the
trials of Adolph Eichmann, a
Nazi war criminal.
Koppel biked to class his
first year because he was un
able to receive car insurance
until he was 21. He lived in a
house with five other graduate
students in Redwood City, so
the trek to and from class

sometimes proved strenu
ous. If he forgot something
~at home, he sometimes
wound up biking 30 miles per
day.
Koppel said he also had
more pleasant memories of
campus.
"I met my future wife
there," he said. "She and I met
in September 1960 and mar
ried three years later."
Koppel and his wife. Grace
Anne, return to campus to
"look at the old haunts ...
Hoo Tow and Mem Chu"'
when business calls him to the
West Coast.
"It always improves with
age and distance." Koppel
said. "That's our youth we left
behind on campus."
After Stanford, Koppel
began his career in radio and
switched to television in 1963
when ABC News hired him as
their full-time general assign
ment correspondent in New
York.
Later, he covered the Viet
nam War as the Hong Kong
bureau chief. Koppel then
covered the State Department
while Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger engaged in "shuttle
diplomacy."
Koppel has anchored
"Nightline" since its inception
in 19K0. He also serves as the
program's chief interviewer
and managing editor.
He has been a major jour
nalistic presence in every pres

idential convention since 1%4.
Koppel has not gone unrec
ognized for his work as a
broadcast journalist, sporting
25 Emmys, five George Foster

Peabody Awards, eight
duPont-Columbia Awards,
nine Overseas Press Club
Awards and two Sigma Delta
Chi Awards, to name a few.
