# Course guide to be released
## 
### James Pritchard Contributing writer 
After many years of unrealized
efforts, the ASSU will finally release
the ASSU Course Guide to dormi
tories this weekend. The 24-page
guide will publish statistics on near
ly 200 classes being offered this
spring.
Class information, based on data
from the past four quarters, will in
clude the class enrollment, class
length and a breakdown of the stu
dent enrollment by class and gener
al area of study. The number and
cost of course materials, ratings
from previous course evaluations
and a breakdown of the workload
will also be listed.
All the classes covered in the pilot
course guide will be from the School
of Humanities and Sciences, but this
may be changed in future publica
tions. The guide, a frequent ASSU
campaign promise over the past live
years, is the culmination of two quar
ters of work by the editor, senior
Jesse Oxfeld, the project director,
sophomore Matt Spence, and a num
ber of students and faculty.
"This was ASSU's first priority
this year," Spence said.
The task of publishing the guide
required the compilation of infor
mation from the Bookstore, the
professors of the chosen courses and
previous course evaluations.
The guide staff originally focused
on introductory classes that would
appeal to the general undergradu
ate student body.
"When you get to the upper level
classes in your major, you are famil
iar with the professors or you are re
quired to take the class," Oxfeld
said. "We thought the chosen (in
troductory) classes would be most
useful to students."

With consultation from Ellen
Woods, the associate vice provost
for undergraduate education, and
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter. the guide staff came up with a
list of about 2(X) courses.
The professors of these classes
were surveyed for information
about their classes. Slightly more
than 50 percent of these professors
responded, Oxfeld said.
Kick Pettit, the textbook buyer
for the Bookstore, provided a print-

out of b(X)k re
quests from the
past year. This
printout allowed
the staff to in
clude total text
book prices for
each class.
The final
information was

made available with a Faculty Senate
resolution late last quarter to have
the Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven's office release
the numerical data from previous
student course evaluations. This in
formation was only available for
classes from that school, Spence said.
The evaluation data was taken
from the past four quarters and only
released if there had been over a 50
percent student response in the class
evaluation. Although it states on the
course evaluations that student
comments will used for the ASSIJ
Course Guide, there were not
enough responses to justify adding
them to the pilot guide, Spence said.
"We hope to be able to include
them in the future," he added.
Originally, the ASSIJ had
planned to release the guide for win
ter quarter. Hut the magnitude of
the project, coupled with a delay in
the release of evaluation data
pushed it back to spring quarter.
