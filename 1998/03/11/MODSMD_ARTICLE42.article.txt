Stanford head coach Richard Quick.
"There are definitely five teams (Stanford,

SMU being the favorites."
An immediate source of motivation for
the Cardinal will be the memory of last
year's 11-point loss to IJSC. That meet left
a bitter taste in the mouths of the swim
mers. and it is an experience they would
rather not relive.
"We've definitely been looking forward
to getting our revenge after last year's
loss," said sophomore Gabrielle Rose.
This year. Stanford qualified 14 swim
mers for the championship. It is a smaller
squad than last year, when 21 swimmers
qualified for nationals. However, this
year's team is arguably a more impressive

one both in terms of ability and unity. Each
swimmer hopes to perform well, but they
all understand that they are there in pur
suit of a team title.

in the 1(H) free as well. Fox placed
third last year in a tight race and will
vie for the title again this year. The
remaining swimmers all have a
chance at finals provided that they
swim well.
Gassner, Smith. Rose and senior
Amy Oberhelman will compete for
spots in the finals in the 2(H) free.
Oberhelman will also swim in the
S(H) and the 1.650 free, where she has
outside chances of making finals.
Freshman Lauren Thies will swim in
the S(H) free and also has an excellent
chance of proceeding to the finals.

Junior Elin Austevoll will be the
only representative for the Cardinal
in the KK)and2oobreastroke events.
Austevoll has a good chance of mak
ing finals in the 1(H). and is virtually a
lock in the 2(H) where she is seeded
second.
The backstroke events will likely
see two different Stanford swim
mers on the winner's podium. Fox
enters the meet as the defending
champion in the 1(H) back and boasts
the fastest time this year. Also swim
ming in the 1(X) back will be sopho
more Jessica Amey and juniors
Chantal Rawn and Suzanne Toledo.
In the 2(H) back, freshman sensa
tion Misty Hyman will be the top
seed. Joining Hvman in the 2(M) back

will be Rawn. Toledo and senior
Evi-Lynn Byer.
In the two butterfly events, the
1(H) and the 2(H). Hyman will show
exactly why she is one of the finest
swimmers in the world. The top seed
in both events, Hyman is as close as
it gets to a sure bet. In addition.
Amey and Cropper have legitimate
chances of making finals in the 1(H).
Also swimming in the 2(H) will be
Rawn and Byer.
Competing in the 2(H) individual
medley will be Austevoll. Rawn and
Rose. All three have a good chance
of making it into the finals. Swim
ming in the 4(H) IM will be Thies and
Byer. With the seventh fastest time
in the country, she will likely have a

place in the finals.
On top of these individual events,
the Cardinal will also enter some
very talented relay squads at the
meet.
With relays counting for twice as
many points as individual wins, they
will play a deciding role in determin
ing the national champion.
It seems as though the Stanford
women have traveled too far this
season to he derailed now. With a
tremendous effort they will he able
to claim the title, but a few miscues
and they could easily find that bitter
taste in their mouths again.

who is better on those three days."
