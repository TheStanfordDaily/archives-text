CORVALLIS, Ore. — When you're the nation's
fifth-ranked team entering the final contest of the reg
ular season against a team that's only won two confer
ence games, all you're really hoping for is a good
showing and one final tuneup before the NCAA tour
nament.

(21-5, 17-1 Pacific 10 Conference) got its big win —- 97-
74 over Oregon State (7-20, 2-16) but in the process
suffered one of its biggest losses of the season.

With |list under 10 minutes to play senior forward
Vanessa N'ygaard grabbed her ninth rebound of the
game but fell to the Ciill Coliseum floor in obvious pain
aftei i couple of dribbles. Nygaard,
ihe team's third Lading scorer and
reboundei. injured her left knee on
the play and did not return to the
game, leasing the arena on clutch
es.
Nygaard received an MRI Sun
day but at press time results were
not available Doctois were confi
dent, howevei that the injury was
not to the anterioi cruciate liga
ment. and Nygaard feels certain
she will play in the upcoming tour
nament
Scniot forward K.i istin Folkl got
a lav up on the play that put the
Card up 72-50. but the concern of
the team was clearly with Nygaard
and not with the conclusion of the
game.
"That is extremely difficult
whenever you see any teammate
get hurt," Folkl said. "Especially
because of who got hurt a fifth
veai scnioi an amazing attitude.
You've never seen anyone so de
voted to a sport. And for that to
happen, it's very hard to focus. We
did our best to try to channel that
emotion into playing well and
doing it for her. but at the same
time it's just very difficult."
After allowing the Beavers to
score the lirst six points of the
game, Stanford ran off 11 unan
swered points to spark an 18-2 run
that put the Card up by 10.
Oregon State stayed in it for a
while, mostly behind the offensive
efforts of senior forward Monica
Watts, who finished with a game
high 24 points. A layup from Watts
with 3 minutes, 10 seconds left in
the half cut the lead to 35-31 hut an
11 -2 Stanford run over the last 2:() t )
of the half put the Card up by 13 at
the break.
Stanford's press was a big part
of the run, as deflected passes led
to back-to-back layups from Folkl.
The 6-foot-2 forward had a
tremendous first-half performance
with 17 points and five rebounds
before finishing the game with 23

points and eight boards.
When the second half began,
Stanford picked up right where it
left off. The Card slowly began to
stretch the lead, and a layup from
senior forward Olympia Scott
made the score 70-50 with 10:41 to
go.
Scott finished with 18 points and
seven rebounds, but the excite
ment of a 23-point win completely
vanished when Nygaard went
down less than a minute after the
Scott layup.
"To me it looked like we were
going through the motions," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"It's very difficult, when someone
gets hurt like that, to get people
playing with the intensity we need
them to. You have to come out and
enjoy playing because you never
know when that can happen. You
just can't take the game for grant
ed."
Freshman forward Sarah Dim
son, who was responsible for
Folkl's back-to-back steals and hit
a jumper at the buzzer to end the
first half, came off the bench to re
place Nygaard and had the best
performance of her career.
Dimson shot 100 percent and
finished with a career-high nine
points in just 13 minutes. With the
uncertainty of Nygaard's condi
tion, Dimson will likely be called
upon to fill in more than ususal in
the NCAA tournament, which be
gins this weekend.
VanDerveer's other options in
clude playing both Folkl and junior
guard Regan Freuen at the small
forward position. Freuen is as
deadly as Nygaard from behind the
arc, as the duo is first and second in
the conference in three-point field
goal percentage.
"Without someone like Vanessa
— someone who's a really good
leader for us — it really changes the
mood for thinking about the NCAA
when you have a senior and a cap
tain and a leader real questionable
right now," VanDerveer said.
"It's just hard to get excited
about how you're playing or what
just happened during the game."
