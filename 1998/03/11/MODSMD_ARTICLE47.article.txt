were selected to the all-Pac-lOteam.
Seniors Olympia Scott. Vanessa Nygaard and
Kristin Folkl were not surprisingly selected to the
all-conference squad. Folkl and Scott are fourth

set the league record for field-coal percentage,
while Scott comes in third. Nygaard is lÂ°th in scor
ing. 13th in rebounding and third in three-point
field-goal percentage. Nygaard is also the Pac-lO's
all-time leader in three-point field goals made.
Arizona's Ac i Barnes was selected Pac-10
player of the year and was the only
Wildcat on the ail-Pac-10 squad.
But Arizona got four selected as
honorable mention, while Stan
ford's glaring exceptions were
sophomore guard Milena Flores
and senior forward Heather Owen.

Flores leads the league in assists,
and her free-throw percentage is
third in the conference. Owen had
the best season of her career and
was 18th in the league in rebound
