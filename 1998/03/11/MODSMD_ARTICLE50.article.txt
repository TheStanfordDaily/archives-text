■ TODAY: Stanford (4-7. 0-2) vs.
California (5-6-1, 0-2) at New Mal
oney Field, 4 p.m.
■ SUNDAY: Stanford at USF.

The Card (10-2.2-0) jumped out
to an early lead, ending the first hall
5-0. Sophomore Suze Gardner
scored the first Cardinal goal offol
a shot from 7 meters after the first
three minutes of play. Back-to
back goals by sophomore 2-meter
woman Ellen Estes and a success
ful penalty shot by freshman Dani
Bell put the Card ahead 4-0 at the
close of the first quarter.
"We came out strong in the first
half, which gave us an emotional
edge." said junior Rachel Best.
"We shut Cal down and their frus
tration showed in the way they
played."
Cal rallied in the third quarter
when Cal senior Karen Cook
scored with I minute, 40 seconds
left on the clock.
"I think we had a small lapse in

intensity, but we were able to re
gain in for the fourth quarter," said
Estes.
Just 35 seconds into the last
quarter. Gardner put another shot
past Schueller to widen the Cardi
nal's lead to 6-1. Stanford and Cal
traded goals for a final score of 7-2
in the last 1:19 of the game.
Estes led the Card in scoring
for the 10th time in 11 games
with four goals.
"The team was really on top of
things." Estes said. "Everyone on
the team played well and opened
me up for shots."
Stanford's defense was once
again central to its success. Junior
goalie Heather Crary h;id a stand
out game, with a total of 11 saves.
"We played really sweet de
fense." Crary said. "They totally
tunneled the ball to me. Our posi
tioning was done so well that I
didn't have to make any amazing
saves."
Crary's intensity set the tone for
the test of the team.
"II.C. was on fire," Estes said.
"She came out as a force. She
blocked two or three shots within
seconds — she was a wall."
Head coach John Tanner was
pleased with C'rary's play and the
strength of the entire defense.
"We dropped on [Cal hole-set]
Alisa von 1 lartit/sche and then tun
neled the shots from the outside so
that Cal only had one place to
shoot," Tanner said. "Heather was
in great position every time."

Huddled during the game, the Stanford women's water polo team
talks strategy. This team meeting proved successful as the No. 3
Card upset No. 2 Cal 7-2.
Stanford used the time during the
week leading up to Friday's game to
work on its offense.
"We had a lot more motion on of
fense than the previous times we
played Cal," Tanner said. "We
passed the hall mueh better, and our
counterattaek was more aggressive.
Cal didn't shoot the ball as well as
they did previously."
"We probably surprised Cal,"

Estes said. "We played hard and in
tense the whole game, and I don't
think they were ready for it."
Stanford also faced Pacific this
weekend. Six goals from Estes, two
from Gardner, and one each from
Bell, Best and freshman Kris Koblik
contributed to Stanford's 11-3 victo
ry
"We're improving game by
game," Best said. "We've been set
ting short-range goals in preparation
for the big finale [of Nationals] at the
end of the season."
Stanford's ability to continue im

proving together will he a key factor
in the games ahead.
"Our team unity is great." C'rary
said. "Everyday in practice every
one is supportive. I always feel the
bond."
The C ard's next match pits it
against top-ranked Bruins at IJCI.A
on Saturday.
It then faces No. 4 l)C -Santa Bar
bara the next day. The next home
games are March 26 against Long
