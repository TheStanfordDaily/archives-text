The Cardinal fared well in its

season, emerging with a convincing
IK-fi. 23-4 and 13-9 trio of victories
Feb. 20-22.

"It's unusual to finish with
UCLA so early in the season,"
Marquess said. "Washington and
UCLA are two different types of
teams. .. Washington is a veteran
team, and UCLA is a young, tal

me a bit because on any given
weekend they can give you a lot of
problems."

Marquess said the Bruins and
Huskies should expect to see the
traditional pitching lineup of ju
niors Jeff Austin, Chad Hutchin
son and Brent Hoard.
A few changes, however, are ex
pected during the midweek games.
"We might give sophomore
[third baseman] Jeff Ri/zo and
sophomore [infielder] Craig
Thompson a chance to swing the
bat a little," Marquess said.
