"lt should be another match like
against Cal or ASU or Duke," Stan
lord head coach Frank Brennansaid.
" Texas is a tough place to play. Last
time we were there we played under

the lights, and Texas had all these
guys with their faces painted. We al
ways have some good luck there."
The defending national champi
ons will also play No. IS Harvard at
home and No. 38Texas A&M at Col
lege Station, but the big test will come
against the Lady Longhorns, who
were absent when Stanford won four
matches on their way to a National
Team Indoor Championship.
Junior Sandy Sureephong is the
highest-rated singles player for the
Longhorns at No. 8 in the country,
but veterans Laura Berendt and
Cristina Moros have extensive dual
match experience and are ranked No.
72 and No. 94. respectively. Moros
has certainly played at a much higher
level throughout her Texas career,
spending much of her time in the top
20 in singles.
Texas freshman Kim Gates also
appears in the rankings at No. 98 na
tionally.
In doubles, Texas places two dif

ferent teams in the top 30 in the na
tion. Sureephong and Gates sit at No.
25, while Moros and Berendt punch
in at No. 29.
The No. 4 ranking for the Long
horns may be a bit deceptive, howev

William & Mary earlier this season.
"I don't know what happened
there," Brennan said. "Maybe there
were some extenuating circum
stances that we didn't hear about."
