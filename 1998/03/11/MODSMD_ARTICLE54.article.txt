After a close three-set battle,
Wolters and Goldstein beat the
Bryans with a 2-6,6-3,6-4 victory.
"The twins played really great
tennis, but Paul and Ryan just had a
great match," Gould said. "I was just
pleased with the fact that we had two
Stanford teams in the finals."
With the doubles tournament be
