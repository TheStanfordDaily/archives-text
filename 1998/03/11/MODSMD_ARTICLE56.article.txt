MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Last Friday: No. 7 Stanford defeat
ed UC-San Diego 15-8,15-7,15-1
■ Last Saturday: Stanford defeated
San Diego State 17-15,15-10,15-7

The seventh-ranked Cardinal
(10-3, 9-3 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) began a series of five
matches in eight days with two vic
tories last weekend, over UC-San
Diego (2-13, 0-12 MPSF) and San
Diego State (4-10, 4-9 MPSF).
Stanford's first match this week
came against a nonconference op
ponent, Penn State (7-12,3-1 East
ern Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation). At press time, the re
sult of this match was unavailable.
Penn State, a school ranked just
outside the top 15, is coming off its
best season ever as well as seven
straight EIVA titles.
Even with the loss of last year's
national player of the year Ivan
Contreras and second team Ail-
American Jason Kepner, the Nit
tan y Lions still return four
starters.
With the high concentration of
matches in this eight-day period,
the Cardinal hoped to show its
depth and give more players court
time.
"It is a good opportunity to play
a nonconference opponent at
home," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves. "Unfortunately, it
is sandwiched between a weekend
away and important league match
es, so we expect to get help beyond
our starting six."

Stanford's home match tomor
row night pits it against another
team coping with some key player
losses.
UC-Irvine (8-7, 5-6 MPSF) also
lost an Ail-American, Chris Harg
er, from last year's squad and only
returns four players. The
Anteaters have coped well, how
ever, and are probably having
their best year ever.
Irvine will be a difficult match
for the Cardinal, especially with its
strong hitting ability. The
Anteaters currently have three
players nationally ranked in kills
average, an impressive statistic.
The Cardinal will wrap up
Dead Week with a Friday night
matchup against top-ranked
UCLA (17-1, 11-1 MPSF). While-
Stanford will attempt to treat this
match like any other, that may be
quite a feat.
The Bruins will be looking to
hand Stanford a defeat after losing
the national title to the Card last
year.
After its first loss of the season
to third-ranked BYU Friday night,
UCLA came back and defeated
the Cougars the following night.
The Bruins now have the week
off to prepare for the matchup
with the Cardinal at 7 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.
Holding on to second place in
the MPSF's Pacific division, the
Cardinal seems a likely qualifier
for the MPSF postseason tourna
ment in mid-April.
"The first step in defending our
title is qualifying for the MPSF
tournament," Nieves said. "Victo
ries in our next three league
matches will help us take a major
step towards getting into that tour
nament."
Stanford will end the month of
March with a two-game series at
fourth-ranked Hawaii (13-3, 10-2
MPSF). The Rainbows hold first

place in the MPSF's Pacific divi
sion by 2 1/2 games over Stanford.
Picking up victories while visiting
the Rainbows would help the Car
dinal gain some ground in the Pa
cific Division.
Although a young squad with
four newcomers playing major
roles, Hawaii has had much suc
cess this season, including an un
defeated road record.
Along with major accomplish
ments on the road, the Rainbows

also play well at home before phe
nomenal crowds. In its two match
es at Hawaii, the Cardinal will
likely play before crowds of 10.(XM)
each night.
The Cardinal will hope to re
turn in April and finish its regular
season strong, with just five
matches left to be played before
the MPSF tournament. Victories
over the next three weeks will help
ensure a place for Stanford in that
tournament.
