The seventh-ranked Cardinal
(10-3, 9-3 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) defeated UC-San
Diego (2-13. 0-12 MPSF) Friday
night. 15-8. 15-7. 15-1. before a Sat
urday afternoon victory over San
DiegoState (4-10,4-9 MPSF). 17-15.
15-10. 15-7.
These matches marked each
team's second opportunity to defeat
Stanford, as the Cardinal defeated
them previously on Jan. 23 and 24.
respectively. Stanford stopped each
school in quicker form last weekend.
While UCSD is winless in the
MPSF this season, the Tritons kept
the first half of game one close he
fore falling victim to passing woes.
Sophomore outside hitter Andy
Witt lead all Cardinal hitters with 14
kills, while freshman middle blocker
Brett Youngherg added 10. Young
herg made his first start of this sea

son, at the outside hitter position,
while leading Stanford in hitting
percentage at .529.
"Youngberg has been playing
well in practice." Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves said, "and we
thought we should look at him as a
starter."
As a team. Stanford hit .493, as
the team held the Tritons to just
.083. The Cardinal was also able to
hold UCSD's top hitter, Ryan
Woods, to a .077 hitting percentage.
Stanford also held a significant
blocking advantage over the Tri
tons. 14-4. Senior middle blocker
Tad Hoffman posted a match-high
12 block assists.
Saturday's match was a more dif
ficult one for the Cardinal, just as it
was in Stanford's previous series
with the San Diego schcxils in Janu
ary.
While the Cardinal took five
games to defeat San Diego State at
the beginning of the season, it hand
ed the A/tecs a three-game loss over
the weekend.
While the match was a 3-osweep,
the Cardinal did not coast through it.
In both game one and two. Stan
ford was forced to come back from
large point deficits. In game one.
Stanford was down 8-14 before w in
ning the game 17-15. while in game
two. the Cardinal came back from a
1-8 deficit to win the game 15-10.
The Cardinal's game one come
back was aided immensely by senior
outside hitter Devin Poolman. as he
was a major factor in turning the
match around. Poolman hit .704. a
phenomenal percentage for an out
side hitter He also had a match-high
four aces.
"While Poolman usually has a lot
of kills for us. the key for him was
keeping his errors down." Nieves
said. "[That is] something that he did
tonight."
