# Mulitauaopele to depart Stanford
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
Senior forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele, who has sat out the entire
1997-98 season with a turn infrap
atellar tendon in her rigl knee, has
elected to forgo her final season of el
igibility and attempt a professional
career. The Daily learned Friday.
"I've decided to graduate," Muli
tauaopele said. "But as far as what
league I'm going to try out for. I'm
not sure as far as I can tell."
Because the senior forward did
have her redshirt season available to
use. it was assumed that she would
return to make up for playing time
lost during two injury-marred sea
sons.
Mulitauaopele initially hurt the
knee last season in practice prior to
the team's road contest against
Washington on Jan. 22. She had
surgery to repair what was diagnosed
as a torn lateral meniscus and subse
quently missed 10 games. She was
able to return for the final two regu
lar-season games and the NCAA
tournament, where she scored 13
points and had six rebounds in a re
gional semifinal win over Virginia.
However, about a month after the
season concluded, complications
arose once again. An M RI revealed a
partial tear in the patellar tendon and
was surgically repaired. A summer
and fall of rehabilitation did not ease
the pain and by December, it was ap
parent that another surgery was
needed. On Jan. 20, she had surgery
that ended any hopes of playing this
year.
"I really can't explain how it hap
pened," Mulitauaopele said. "It's
kind of frustrating that it did because
all the while 1 was thinking 1 was get
ting better."
When healthy, Mulitauaopele
had been a key component of Stan
ford's frontline with her soft outside

shooting and her improving post
play. She started 25 of the 91 games
she played in, 20 of those coming last
season. For her career, she averaged
9.7 points and 4.6 rebounds, and her
KM career points ranks 24th on Stan
ford's all-time list.
Obviously, the decision to move
on wasn't easy, especially with all the
factors to be weighed. She could
have returned and had a great season
and raised her draft stock — or she
could have gotten hurt again and not
realize her dreams of a professional
career.
"I looked at it as a win-win situa
tion," Mulitauaopele said. "If I came
back next year, the team would still
have a great chance to win a national
championship. So if I stayed, we
would've had a great team and I
could've cotermed.
"But mainly, my decision is that
I'm ready to go to the next level in
life. College was a great experience,
but the fact that I'm on track to grad
uate — I'm done with my major re
quirements this quarter, so I'm ready
to move on with life already."
Mulitauaopele also acknowl
edges that while draft position is not
a major factor, she has not complete
ly ruled out the possibility of return
ing to Stanford.
"I'm going to rehab as much as I
can and see how this turns out,"
Mulitauaopele said. "I do have to
say. if worse comes to worst, like a sit
uation where I'm not happy with the
option that's given me in the draft. I
don't see coming back out of the pic
ture. So in that sense, 1 won't get an
agent right away.
"Like I said, it's a win-win situa
tion, so I'll cross my fingers and
hope things go the way I would like
them to. I need to make some initial
choice of direction of where I want
to go, so I'll work toward that but
realize that I do have this other op
tion as well."
