and finals may seem
like torture right now,
hut a spring hreak trip to
Hawaii or Fiji will do wonders
to reverse the end-of-quarter
crunch and stress.

The Stanford Mendicants are among many groups of
students who have opted for adventurous and out-of-the-ordi
nary spring break trips. This a cappclla group, as well as Mixed
Company, will he touring the island of Oahu, singing and sun
bathing for nine days.
"We definitely are going to spend a gixxJ part of the trip
singing, but we're making time to relax and hang out," said tour
manager Michael LaHood. "Everyone's been so busy lately, so
we're really aiming to enjoy ourselves while also performing all
over new territory."
Their itinerary is packed with gigs and beaches, including ap
pearances on two radio shows, several restaurants, malls and fes

tivals. They arc also hopinpfor a chance to sing the national an
them at Pearl Harbor. said.
In addition to their a cappclla agenda, the 15 men in the group
will spend at least two days renting motor scooters and exploring,
or perhaps surfing at Waikiki Beach.
The rugby team will be touring Fiji while the Mendicants will
enjoy palm trees and luaus.
Sophomore Joseph Henry is looking forward to some intense
practice combined with rest and enjoyment of the beautiful cli
mate and scenery.
"The tour will give us a chance to test ourselves against some

very competitive Fijian rugby
teams," he said. "It will be a good
chance to train and perhaps prepare
ourselves for the upcoming region
al and hopefully an appearance in
the Final Four."
After a 14-hour plane ride, the 30
members taking the trip will be play
ing four games, interspersed with in
tense training for the spring.
Henry added that this will be "a
lot more exciting than going back to
Louisiana," his home state.
Also traveling for sport, albeit of
an entirely different nature, senior
Andy Pelletier is planning a trip to
Co/umel, Mexico, for spearfishing
and scuba diving.
A native of Rhode Island, Pelleti
er has developed the art and sport of
spearfishing for many years. He ex
plained that there are essentially
two different schools of the sport;
one with spear guns, the other with

hand spears.
"L only do the kind with hand
spears — I mean, anyone can go
shoot a fish. This takes a lot more
skill," he said.
The sport requires a wetsuit and
mask equipment, but unlike scuba,
spearfishing involves free diving
without tanks.
Accompanied by four other
friends, Pelletier will spend six days
joining expeditions on specialized
spearfishing boats. The most prized
capture is considered to be the white
sea bass, essentially a "Holy Grail" of
spearfishing. according to Pelletier.
"It takes a lot of practice and pa
tience," he said. "It definitely helps
to know about a certain fish — some
hide behind rocks or can disguise
themselves. You really have to start
to think like a fish."
In addition to catching and cook
ing the reward fish that can range
from 8 to 1(H) pounds, Pelletier
hopes to have some time to scuba
dive and rest on the beach.
Sophomore roommates Renee

Benson and Semira Rahemtulla are
planning to reap the benefits of
beautiful scenery, rest and relax
ation without leaving the state.
"I'm totally looking forward to
spa treatment," said Benson of their
anticipated excursion to the Calisto
ga spas.
The town of Calistoga is commit
ted to health, demonstrated through
their famous bottled pure mineral
water and luxurious spa treatment.
Mud baths, massages and aro
matherapy are available at the spa
complex and are set up for tourists
who stay in bed and breakfast inns
nearby. Benson got the idea of the
spas from her mother, who went to
one a few years ago.
"She loved it while she was
there," Benson said. "All I really
want to do is relax. 1 think the mud
baths will help with that."
No doubt they will have many
stories to compare to other Stanford
delegations headed to warm, tropi
cal places, but the trick is to first get
through finals.
