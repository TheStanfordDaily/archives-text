collegiate Ciolf Tournament in

1 he Cardinal decided not to
enter the tournament last season,
but chose differently this spring as
preparation for the upcoming
Western Intercollegiate Tourna
ment in Santa Cruz.
The team comes in off of a
mediocre performance in the
UThP Intercollegiate, where
Stanford finished seventh in a field
of nine although only Texas was

ranked higher than the Card. The
lone highlight of the UTKP Tour
nament for Stanford was junior
Joel KribeTs third-place finish.
Last year in Santa Barbara, the
tournament's team title went to
Fresno State, while top individual
honors went to Justin Russo of San
Jose State. It was played on the
same par-72. 6,86y-yard course as
this year.
Stanford hopes to raise its No.
2 l ) ranking, which has slowly
climbed after going as low as No.
31 in November. The team's high
est ranking yet this year is No. 25.
Also to be considered is KribeTs
individual NCAA seeding of No.
14.
Stanford brings to Santa Bar
bara a relatively young group. Of
the 13 team members, six are fresh
men and two are sophomores. Re
turning from last year are sopho
mores Dusty Brett. Andy Hastings
and Tvlar Lunke, juniors Kribel
and Tvler Dennis and senior Eri

Crum. The team is under the tute
lage of eoaeh Wally Goodwin for
the 11th season.
In the seven tournaments en
tered so far, Stanford has emerged
with five top-10 team finishes, two
of which were in the top five. The
team score is based on the four
lowest individual scores of a round,
over three rounds. With no tourna
ment v\ins to date and an average
of 295 per round, Stanford aims to
stir the waters this spring.
Kribel has been the most consis
tent individual performer, placing
in the top 10 live times and garner
ing Stanford's only win in the
IMNCi Arizona Intercollegiate in
Tucson, Ariz., on Feb. 3. After dis
appointing performances in the
fall, when the third-place rank he
held in early September plummet
ed. Kribel has come on strong late
ly. finishing no lower than third
and chalking up a tournament vic
tory.
Brett is the only other golfer to
place in the top 10 of a tournament,
while Searle. Dahlberg. and fresh
men Jimmv Lee and John Ander
son have all played themselves into
the top 25. Of the current crop of
freshmen, Lee, who has played in
four tournaments, has the best aver

age per round (75.56).
After the Pacific Intercollegiate
Tournament, the team gears up for a
series of important tournaments, in
cluding the U.S. Intercollegiate to
be held in front of the home crowd
and the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships in Orinda. Calif.
The NCAA West Regionals will be
held from May 14-16. with Stanford
aiming to qualify for the national
championships in Albuquerque.
