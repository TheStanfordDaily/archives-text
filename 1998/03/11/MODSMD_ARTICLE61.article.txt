## 
### Will Flemming Contributing writer 
From the lust day ot practice in
the fall. Stanford women's golf
coach Caroline O'Connor told her
young team to viev\ its early-season
competitions as preparation for an
ultimate goal — the NCAA Cham
pionship. O'Connor knew she had
an extremely inexperienced team,
vet she also knew that the young
Cardinal had some serious talent.
As the Winter Quarter comes to
a close, the C ardinal knows that the
heart of its season, including the all
important NCAAs in Madison,
Wise., is fast approaching.
However, the spring quarter
;ilso brings with it something far
more valuable to the Card than sig
nificant season-ending competi
tions the sunshine.
•We had .i three-week stretch
when we hit virtually no balls."
sophomore Julie Dunn said after
he Cardinal's successful third
:>lace finish at the UCLA Bruin
: lassie just two weeks ago. "We re
illy look forward to the spring,
a hen we can practice more often
and get a much better feel for
where we stand as a team."
The first step in this evaluation
process, which will continue
through the spring, takes place in
Monterey. Calif., from Monday to
today at the San Jose State Spartan
Invitational.
"The tournament in Monterey
is another good test for us," fresh
man Hillary Homeyer said. "We
just want to go out and compete in

every event, and hopefully good
things will happen. With a team as
young as ours, 1 think we will see
dramatic improvement between
now and the end of the season.
Each tournament is a step in the
right direction."
Stanford has competed with the
host Spartans already this season,
in mid-November, at the Golf
World Invitational in Palmetto
Dunes, S.C. In the early-season
competition, the Cardinal finished
third, while the Spartans posted a
lOth-place finish.
In South Carolina, the Cardinal
placed three players in the top 20,
while Molly Cooper. San Jose

State's highest finisher, ended the
weekend in 23rd place. For Stan
ford. freshman Stephanie Keever
finished in a tie for sixth place at 8-
over-par 224, five shots back from
the individual champion. Fresh
man Jessica Belskis and sopho
more Jae Jean Ro also had solid
performances, finishing in 10th and
16th place, respectively.
Belskis has continued her solid
play of late, as she finished tied for
eighth at the UCLA Classic.
"I really felt like 1 struck the ball
well down in Los Angeles," Belskis
said. "On the last dav, I seemed to

put everything together and was real
happy with the way I played."
It is exactly this type of perfor
mance from young players that

could lead the Cardinal to success in
the spring.
"We are obviously a real young
group," freshman Lauren Robert
son said. "But from the beginning,
Coach O'Connor has emphasized to
us that there is no reason we can't be
one of the best teams in the countrv.

"So far this winter, I think all the
rain and limited practice time has
slowed our progress a little. But as
the sun comes out this spring, I think
a lot of the girls on the team will im
prove, and our team will prove that
you don't have to he experienced to
succeed."
