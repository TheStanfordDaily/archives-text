### John Sullivan Staff writer 
The No. 17 Stanford softball team had a productive
weekend, taking a doubleheader from Toledo Saturday
1-0 and 3-0 at the Stanford Softball Complex and defeat
ing No. 13 California (S-8) on Sunday at Berkeley, 4-2
and 4-0.
In the first game against Toledo, a team not known for
its offensive firepower, things started slowly. The game
remained scoreless going into the fourth inning.
In the bottom of the fourth, junior Michele Acosta sin
gled junior Marcy Crouch in from second to give the
Card a 1 -0 edge. Neither team scored in the remainder of
the game, giving Stanford the win.
The Card (15-4. 3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) collected
only five hits in the victory from four players. The lack of
offensive production was compensated by solid defen
sive play. Junior Becky Blevins and senior Jessica Schul
man combined forces on the mound for the Card, with
Schulman (2-0) earning the victory. The combo allowed
onlv five hits while striking out three.

In the second game, both teams again left their slug
ging caps in the dugout when they came up to bat with the
game remaining scoreless going into the fourth inning.
The Card was able to get a run in the fourth and then
two in the fifth to secure a 3-0 victory. Stanford tallied
seven hits, while Blevinsand Schulman kept the Rockets
to only two hits.
"We weren't really up for the Toledo game," Schul
man said. "That is reflected in the box score."
Against Cal on Sunday, the Card kept up its intensity
level even when it held the lead.
"Though both games were tight, we came ready to
play," Schulman said. "We didn't pounce on Toledo like
we should have. But we made sure that we didn't sit on
runs against Cal."
With the Cal band on hand as a distraction and a large,
noisy crowd to egg on the Cardinal players, Stanford
maintained its focus at the plate and played solid defense.
"Everyone in our lineup today came through with
hits," Crouch said. "We came through in the clutch situ
ations when we needed to. When they came out flat in the
second game, we just kept on scoring runs."
Blevins pitched the first game for the Card, getting the
win and running her record to 9-1. Crouch was impres

sive in ihe second game, throwing a complete game two
hit shutout.
"Marcy was amazing," Schulman said. "There was no
threat at any point in the game that they would score."
