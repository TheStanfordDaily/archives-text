### John Sullivan Staff writer 
While the rest of us are lounging
somewhere over spring break, the
Stanford softball team will be hard
at work, playing 10 games in nine
days.
The No. 17 Card (15-4,3-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) matches up
against Texas Tech (10-4) on March
21 at the Stanford Softball Complex.
The Red Raiders are having a solid
season and have been playing well as
of late.
Recently, they won the Alabama
Tournament, beating Eastern Ken
tucky (then-10-1), Northeastern Illi
nois (then-4-0) and Tennessee-
Chatanooga (then-2-0).

On March 24, Harvard will ride
into town. Stanford cannot take the
Crimson (4-2) lightly, as it lost only
3-2 to No. 9 Missouri. Harvard also

has a solid pitching rotation, led by
juniors Heather Brown and Tasha
Cup and sophomore Kathleen
Brown.
No. 22 Kansas (10-8) is next in
line for the Card. Last year, the Jay
hawks went to regionals and has lost
only one starter and five players
overall from last year's squad.
The Jayhawks are led by senior
catcher Kristina Johnson, sopho
more first baseman Shannon Stan
nix and senior outfielder Sara Hol
land.
"The games against Texas Tech,
Harvard and Kansas are huge for us
because those teams are all out of
our region," Schulman said. "When
it comes time for regionals, the com
mittee will look at how we per
formed against teams outside of our
region."
After Kansas, the Card is on the
road for the weekend of March 28-
29. The team first travels to Wash
ington to take on the No. 3 Huskies
(13-3). Washington's three losses
have all been close and have come
against ranked teams. They lost to
then-No. 21 Florida State 1-0 on
Feb. 14. then-No. 25 Tennessee 2-1
on Feb. 15, and then-No. 9 Okla

homa State on March 1.
"Washington is a great team, but
we beat them last year," Crouch
said. "If we play well against them,
we can definitely compete with
them."
Washington's main weapon is
sophomore pitcher Jennifer Spedi
acci, who led the Huskies to victory
against No. 6 Oklahoma 3-0. Spedi
acci was one at-bat away from throw
ing a perfect game when she hit a bat
ter.
However, she did not get the no
hitter. For the season, she is 6-1 with
a 0.00 ERA with 57 strikeouts.
"There is always a big rivalry with
Washington," Schulman said. "But

even more so now that our coach
used to coach there. They have a
huge fan base, which makes playing
there challenging."
Next on tap for the Card is
UCLA (K-4). Earlier in the season.
Stanford beat then-No. 17 UCLA 8-
7 in nine innings in an impressive
come-from-behind victory. Though
the Bruins have dropped out of the
top 25. their hitting and fielding have
remained solid.
"The weekend we play Washing
ton and IJCL.A back-to-back at their
places is going to be tough." Schul
man said. "However, both teams
will really challenge us, which will be
a good test for ourselves."
