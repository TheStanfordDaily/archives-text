On Saturday, in a grueling game across the
Bay. Stanford's hopes came up empty as the Car
dinal fell to the (iolden Bears 4K-19.
Stanford led the Bears for most of the first half,
jumping to a 7-0 lead in the first minute of the
game. Midway through the half, both Cal and

Stanford scored to make it 14-12 in favor of the
Curd. The momentum switched right before the
half when the Bears scored twice to make it 22-14.
With these lust two scores, Cal accelerated the
pace of the game.
Stanford's defense never adapted to the quick
pace. During the second half. Cal's combination
of strength and speed dominated and eventually
allowed for the 4K-19 victory. Stanford played
hard but managed to score only once in the sec
ond half.
The much-anticipated matchup against the
Bears was a disappointment for Stanford. Though
the team showed its tenacity and fighting spirit, it
was once again plagued by defensive mistakes.
"The defense," said Stanford coach Franck
Boivert. "was extremely disappointing, with a lot
of missed tackles and slow realignment."
Despite the loss, the Cardinal is looking for
ward to the next couple of weeks. The players will
only do weight workouts during Dead Week and

finals so they can recuperate and concentrate on
exams. During the break, the team travels to Fiji
where it will compete in two games.
In the first game, the Cardinal will take on the
Fiji ( hampions — the Nadroga under-21 team in
Sigatoka. In their second contest, the Card will
compete against the University of the South Pa
cific in Suva. The University of the South Pacific
hits student / players from 12 different island na
tions - including Tonga, Samoa, the Solomon Is
lands, and more.
During the trip, the team will continue to train
every day and even get a chance to play basketball
against a Fijian development site. In addition,
Stanford will also participate in some community
service work in the villages and outer islands of
Fiji.
After the Fiji tour, Stanford will host Oregon
State on April 11 to begin the Pacific Coast Play
offs. The winner of this game will go on to the
Round of 16 in Houston on April 18-19.
