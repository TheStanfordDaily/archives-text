# Horse polo team rides into championships
## Nationals up next 
### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
When both the Stanford men's
and women's polo teams rode into
Rancho Murieta. Calif., two weeks
ago for the Western Regional
Championships, few expected either
team to survive the weekend.
But somehow, the women's
squad lasted through three games
against division foes and earned a
trip to the National Championships
in Burleson, Texas.
Things didn't go as well for the
men. as the team opened by beating
LJC-Santa Barbara in a close game
but then fell to Washington State,
which eventually came in second at
the tournament.
The women's team was supposed
to fare no better, as it entered the
seven-team tournament with a No. 5
seed.
"So many games got rained out
during the season that there wasn't
much to go on and seeding was a bit
of a guessing game," said senior
Courtney Riggle. "We knew we
were better than a No. 5."
By that point, Ihe team had gone
2-1 in an F.I Nirto-shortened regular
season, beating UC-Davis and Ore
gon State but losing to I JC-Santa

Barbara by two goals in a tight game.
The team's opener, a 19-16 victo
ry against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo,
was less threatening than the next
round's game against Santa Bar
bara, which defeated the Cardinal in
the regular season. The Gauchos
were seeded first in the tournament.
"Against Santa Barbara, we
played the hardest, fastest polo we
have ever played on the West
Coast," said sophomore Bonnie
Lind. "It was a really fun game."
By the final gun, the Card had
outshot the Gauchos 20-8 in the
championship game.
The team takes the trip to Texas
on March 30 but has mixed predic
tions for success.
"I think we'll do well, but it will
be tough," Riggle said. "It's tough
competing against East Coast
schools. Horse polo is a varsity sport
in some schools, and often they have
huge programs. In the West, it is
more often a club sport."
The Cardinal's three-member
team will feature fifth-year senior
Alexa Christy :md Higgle — both
all-Western Regional team mem
bers — as the first two starters and a
platoon of sophomores Allison
Dawson and Bonnie Lind filling the
third slot.
