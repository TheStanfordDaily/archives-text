# Men's loss marred by another injury

### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
Although the Stanford men's
gymnasties team put on a relatively
strong performance Saturday night
at the UC-Santa Barbara Invitation
al by earning a score of 216.95, the
night was tainted by a stunning fall off
the high bar by freshman Jason Biltz
that resulted in injury. Biltz, whose
best event has traditionally been the
high bar, said his knee felt "worse"
the next morning.

MEN'S GYMNASTICS

Invitiational: Stanford 216.95

"I have to go to the trainer and get
X-rayed and everything," Biltz said.
"It's pretty had."
Biltz's injury further depletes the
strength of an already injury-plagued
squad. The team now consists of only
six injury-free gymnasts.
Things started out well at Santa
Barbara Saturday night.
"In the first three events, the team

was looking gcxxl," said head coach
Sadao Hamada.
Then the team began to falter.
Nonetheless, the final score of 216.95,
though not enough to earn the Cardi
nal first place, reflected the solid per
formance of the gymnasts.
"It was not great," Hamada said.
"But 1 still noticed lots of improve
ment. It's starting to look really
g(x>d."
The 216.95 score is a substantial
drop-off from last weekend's score of
220 against Michigan, but before
Michigan, the team had been consis
tently posting scores that hovered
around 210.
The team is in danger of failing to
qualify for the NCAA Regionals,
which roll around April 4.
"The next two meets are very,
very important," Hamada said.
The Cardinal has two more cru
cial regular-season meets in March
and then the MPSF Championships
March 27-28. The Cardinal takes on
California and Massachusetts at
Berkeley Friday and Army, Cal and
Massachusetts at Stanford March 20.
Both of the remaining meets fea
ture top-ranked California, last
year's national champion. In three
clashes with the Bears this season, the
Cardinal has failed to even threaten
Cal. which boasts a squad over twice
as large as that of Stanford. More
over, the Bears enjoy a deep team

Considering the injury status of
Stanford's team, one might think
Hamada would rather focus on the
prospect of individual gymnasts mak
ing an impact at the NCAAs. Hama
da's mindset, however, remains
team-oriented.
"I'm not thinking about individu
als." Hamada said. "My concerns are
with the team."
Of course, several individual gym
nasts are capable of doing damage at
both the reeionals and the nationals.
