# Utes upset by red-hot gymnasts
## Seniors stellar in last home meet of season 
### Molly Brizgys Contributing writer 
Everything was sweet for the Cardinal last
Friday night at Burnham Pavilion, from the
corsages on the gymnasts' warmups to the
teary farewell for the seniors to 18th-ranked
Stanford's 195.275-194.275 farewell victory
over third-ranked Utah.
The victory made history for the Cardinal
(7-4), as the team had never beaten the Utes
(6-2) — not bad for head coach Mark Cook's
first year at the helm.

"It feels good," Cook said. "I'm very com
petitive despite my calm demeanor, and he
[Utah head coach Greg Mardsen] has 10 na
tional championships. I'm just proud of the
girls."
Stanford took first place in all the events,
which was impressive considering Utah re
turned five All-Americans from a squad that
finished seventh at nationals last year.
The win bodes well for the future, to say the
least.
Senior co-captain Keri Monahan per
formed the best gymnastics of her career and
took first place on beam (9.85) and floor (9.9).
Sophomore Larissa Fontaine also had quite a
night, stealing first on the bars (9.9) and vault
(9.875).
Junior Amy Murakami came up big and
won the all-around with a season-high 39.250.
The win, however, was a team effort with
everyone stepping it up for the last home meet
of the season.
The meet started off well with the team's
strongest finish this season on vault — four
tenths of a point higher than usual. Four gym
nasts grabbed scores better than 9.8, including
freshman Jenny Wilson, who scored a season
high 9.85. Wilson looked strong and sure-foot
ed oft both vaults as did Fontaine doing her
"Yurchenko" vault.
The momentum carried over to the uneven
parallel bars where Stanford faltered a bit but
was able to regain its composure. Wilson again
performed well, grabbing a score of 9.85, and
Murakami rocked her routine with a score of
9.85.
The real star, however, was Fontaine. She
performed every trick flawlessly down to her
"Fontaine" finish and grabbed a score of 9.9.
Fontaine's dismount off the bars is called the
"Fontaine" because she invented the move.
After performing it at the World Champi
onships, the dismount became official.
After two events, Stanford led 98.0-97.4.
Monahan opened for the Card on beam and
started the team off well with a 9.85 first-place
finish. After Monahan was junior Katie Fitz
patrick, who was just coming back after under
going ankle surgery. Fitzpatrick finished 45th
at nationals last year and has struggled this
season to get back into her groove.
One could see the intensity build in Fitz
patrick's face as she hit each of her difficult
skills en route to a strong 9.725 finish. After

the routine was done, still atop the beam, Fitz
patrick had a smile on her face, and she lin
gered there for a couple of seconds relishing
the moment.
After three events, the Cardinal was still
ahead 146.50-146.15, Ihe team hadn't
clinched the win yet and would have to per
form well on floor to ensure a win.
That's exactly what Stanford did.
Wilson opened with a solid routine (9.625)
and was followed by sophomore Traces Kohl,
who nailed her routine and grabbed a score of
9.825. Sophomore Kim Young stole the show
for the time being with a sass\ routine, wooing
the hearts of the audience which chanted
"10. 10. 10" — and finished with a career-high
9.875.
Hut the show wasn't over yet. and a deter
mined Monahan would end her home career
with a bang.
She hit every pass, including a new one iiist
added this week, and grabbed a 9.9 good
enough for first place. A usuall) reserved
Monahan couldn't control her excitement and
sprinted to her team as the\ all enveloped her
in a huge hug.
Senior Ann Neil performed exhibition on

bars and floor and had strong showings on
both, perhaps her best all season.
it was a special night and both seniors did
the best gymnastics of their career." Cook
said.
Utah didn't fare as well as the Cardinal and
had its worst meet of the season. The team was
competing without two-time national defend
ing beam champion Summer Reid. which may
have hurt their team score It was the Ctes"
first time coming to Stanford, and Cook said
he thought the fans might have rattled them
Despite all other factors, this is still a huge win
for the Card.
According to Cook. the meet was a "minor
peak." The squad has quite a schedule ahead
of it.and that will hopefully set them up for an
even bigger peak at regionals.
I he squad travels to San Jose Friday for a
dual meet th.it shouldn't pose too much of a
threat. I hen the team travels to I CI A for the
Pac-10 Championships March 28. II all goes
well at I'CI.A. the team will travel to W ash
ington for the N( A \ Regionals April 4
"We have to keep this intensity and consis
tency up." Cook said We're on schedule in
our plan to be ready for regionals."
