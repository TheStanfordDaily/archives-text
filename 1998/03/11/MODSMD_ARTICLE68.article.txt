St. Mary's and Chico State were the two most recent
teams to fall victim to the Card, losing 19-3 and 21-3, re
spectively.
Although the Gaels are probably the strongest of the
teams the women have laced yet this season, they were
dramatically overmatched by the ( ardinal. Junior co
captain ( arey Jones led all scorers with four goals, while
senior Para Kaplan and sophomore Hedy Born con
tributed three goals a piece. The Card worked on spe
cific skills throught the game.

Settling the offense "will be important when we play
better teams with stronger defenses," Kaplan said.
"Against stronger teams, we need to work on our
plays."
Stanford put on a clinic for the few fans in atten
dance at Maloney Field against Chico State. Jones again
led all scorers with six goals while also contributing two
assists. Kaplan also contributed four goals and one as
sist. Ten different members of the Card put the ball in
the net in a well-rounded attack.
Although the game was an impressive offensive
show, Stanford's defense was stifling as well with sopho
more Andrea Suh and fresnman Katherine Barnes con
tributing particularly strong performances.
"We didn't want to play down to their level," Kaplan
said. "We want to be prepared, stay confident and play
our own game."
Despite facing little challenge, the Cardinal has been
improving in every game, in anticipation of the chal
lenges to come.
"We have picked up the level of play in each game."
Kaplan said. "We have been working well on improving
the parts of our game."
"We are looking optimistically at continuing the
trend," said head coach Heidi Connor. These games are
"a real test of where we are in the season."
Yesterday the team faced Notre Dame at Maloney
Field in its first game against a Division I opponent. The
result was unavailable at press time.
During spring break, many of the members of the
squad will have a homecoming, traveling to the East
Coast for the toughest competition of the season. The
Card is scheduled to face Pennsylvania, Ohio State. St.
Joseph's (Pa.), Catholic University and Virginia Tech.
