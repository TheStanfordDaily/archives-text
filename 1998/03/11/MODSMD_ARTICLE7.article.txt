# More grad students to be housed on campus
## 
### Jaime Adame Contributing writer 
Single units in several graduate residences will be
come doubles beginning next fall, creating about 2M)
more spaces for students as a part of University efforts
to address the increased demand for on-campus grad
uate housing.
Currently, all rooms in Crothers Hall and Crothers
Memorial Hall are configured as singles, although 33 in
Crothers and 97 in Crothers Memorial were originally
designed to be doubles. These rooms will return to
their original design.
In Escondido Village. 82 one-bedroom apartments
originally intended to be used as doubles will be con
verted to double-occupancy apartments. Some two
bedroom apartments will be available to groups of
three students.
Last year. 591 graduate students seeking on-campus
housing were denied, despite the opening of two new
graduate housing complexes. Lyman Hall and Schwab
Residential Learning Center. Together, they house
more than MX) students. Of those unassigned. 329 indi
cated they were willing to live anywhere on campus.
"It )ust so happens that the area around Stanford is
the most expensive market in the country." said Tom
Wasow. associate dean for graduate policy
Stanford's rates are 25 percent below market level,
while the average rent in Palo Alto has increased by 33
percent over the last three years, rising 20 percent last
year alone.
To help offset rising costs, the University is also in
troducing several new off-campus incentive programs.
A new loan program will help students pay security de
posits and first and last month's rent. Faculty and stu-
dents will soon be able to advertise
off-campus real estate rentals free
of charge with Community Housing
Services. An emergency fund will
provide one-time grants to students
facing housing difficulties.

about $ 1.1 (X) a month," said Harris
Shapiro, a member of the Graduate
Student Council.
"■ I he average rent is about $MH)
to $700.
"It's unclear whether the Uni
versity is providing enough re
sources to have an effect," he said.
1 hesc changes were made based
on the recommendations of a com
mittee — consisting of eight admin
. istrators and three students — that
•* was formed last fall to study several
short-term solutions to the housing
problem.
"We considered a number of dif
,•* ferent options to create the greatest
• number ol spaces for graduate stu
dents enrolling next year," said
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya. who served on the
committee.
He made the final decision in
collaboration with Wasow and Vice
I'rovost for Budget and Auxiliaries
Management Tim Warner.
Warner said that the changes
will be reviewed regularly, with the

hope that they will be temporary.
The ASSU Senate is commis
sioning a task force to further study
the recommendations of the com
mittee and their impact, particular
ly focusing on more feasible long
term solutions. The group has ten
tative plans to release its findings
during the first half of spring quar
ter.
Jesse Adams, a doctoral candi
date in mechanical engineering
who served on the committee, ex
pressed concerns about the quality
of life for graduate students.
"Cramming more students into
the current number of spaces is not
the solution." Adams said.
"I'd like the University to say.
We're going to help you get a place
oft campus while we build new
housing on campus.' "
According to Wasow, the Uni
versity is looking into building addi
tional graduate residences, but it
will "probably be two or three more
years before additional housing is
available."
Students living in the double oc
cupancy rooms will pay less than
those in single occupancy ones. In
Crothers Hall and Crothers Memo
rial. the rates for doubles will be 25
percent below the current single
rate, while in Escondido Village the
rate for the converted apartments
will be approximately 15 percent
below the current rate for one-bed
room apartments.
