choreographer/ director
/Twyla Tharp has heeh called " The
oI irst l.adv ot Post-Modern
Dance." Since she founded her first dance
company in 1465, she lias worked with the
Paris Opera Pallet and the Royal Pallet in
I.ondon, won two 1 mmy Awards and
served as associate director ol the
American Pallet Theater.
lor the first time ever, Tharp's latest
dance company, I harp!', is coming to
Stanford. As part ol I harp's tour-day visit,
she is producing two mainstage perlor
mances pins a community spectacular
called "The' One,. I kindreds." I hese events
bear exceptional significance tor members
of the Stanford community.
I riday and Saturday nights' mainstage per
formances in Memorial Auditorium will in
clude "Yemava," I harp's latest work. This piece
is so new that it was named inst last month
and has never been performed in public.
(x>mmissioned in part In Stanford l ively
Arts, the work consists of dancers in original
( üban costumes moving to what Tharp de
scribed as "the spiritual music of Santeria
drumming and singing rituals |combined | with
the strictly secular music ot Uuben (ion/ale/
and other legendary Cuban musicians.''
"The scenes in this piece," Tharp ex
plained, "revXTtVir around a very extroverted
man who has a series ol'adventures with an
idealized female figure who has the power
of Yemaya ... the goddess ol the ocean." .
Other famous pieces that will be per
formed include "Sweet fields," which
Tharp described as "an examination ol the
various, components ol religion" put to
18th and 14th century American a cappella

music, and"I leroes," a combination of bal
let, modern and acrobatics done to a Philip
(ilass score.
The other landmark event of Iharp's
Stanford visit is tomorrow night's produc
tion of her one-hour piece, "The One
Hundreds." According to the lively Arts,
the cast of 100 ranges "fron'i members of
the Iharp's phenomenal company and
dance students to Stanford luminaries and
local 'celebrities' — many" of whom have
never danced before."
Of all ages and backgrounds,"the partic
ipants are an entire cross section ol the
community coming together to celebrate
dance," said Su/anne Held, marketing di
rector of Stanford I vents.
Instead ot auditioning, prospectivepar
ticipa.nts were asked to write a 25-word re
sponse to one ol three cjuesiions: What is "a
I harp!"? Describe "the world according to
I harp!" or "Why does participating in I he
()ne I lundreds" appeal to Vou?
According to Kevin Marlatt, director of
artist services and education for Stanford
lively Arts, about 120 people submitted
applications for this once-in-a-liletime op
portunity. He and the Stanford Dance
Action group have chosen ".is diverse and
eclectic a group as possible."
Stanford faculty of many different fields
will take the stage tomorrow night. They
include Vice Provost for Student Affairs
James Montoya, fencing coach Zoran
Tulum and Associate Dean of Continuing
Studies C harles Junkerman.
lunkerman has never performed onstage
before. He said that when he does dance, he
tries to "find a place oil where the lights
aren't , too bright." However, he is excited
about participating. "It's going to be lun to
do something like that with someone ot

1 harp's imagination ami with a hundred
other people. It's fascinating to think ol the
permutations ot movement.
Prom the surrounding community,
Palo Alto Mayor Hick Rosenbaum and
Menlo Park Mayor pro tern I'aul
Coliaccai will also enter the spotlight in
" The One I kindreds."
After only two rehearsals — one tomor
row afternoon and the other just before
the performance — the participants will
come together in what Stanford I ively Arts
called "a lighthearted, wonderful celebra
tion of movement and nature."
Decked in '60s garb, the participants
will concurrently perform individual 11-
second phrases, communicating the en
ergy and activity that comprises a single
moment in everyday lite.
"The One I kindreds" is the epitome of
Twyla 1 harp's early career goal of "find
ing movement that we all use and seeing
how then that can be made larger than
life but coming from lite."
A company of some of the world's most
talented young dancers, Tharpl's three
nights of performances will be landmark
events both artistically and historically.
