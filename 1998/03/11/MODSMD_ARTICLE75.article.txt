Nonsense is nonsense even when
people die. On December 11, 1969,
an anarchist railway worker dropped
from a fourth story window of the
Italian Police Headquarters in
Milan, inconveniently landing next
to a crowd of journalists who had re
cently left a press conference in the
same building.
The police's subsequent cover-up
was farcical, at first claiming that the
events were not recorded and then
producing three records of the
event, all of which contradicted each
other. At first they called it a suicide.
Finally they mysteriously labeled it
an "accidental death."
Dario Fo's "Accidental Death of
an Anarchist," written a year after
the event, ridicules the police's bru
tal and arrogant supidity in the
whole affair. It is an exceedingly
funny play, and the staged reading
presented last Friday in Little
Theater was an excellent opportu
nity to get a flavor of Fo's work so
soon after his 1997 Nobel Prize in
Literature.
The actors clearly had as much
fun reading the play as the audi
ence did listening to it. A madman
simply named Maniac (Tom
Freeland), who compulsively im
personates others, accidentally
ends up reading the wrong files in
a police station. He finds out about
the circumstances surrounding the
anarchist's death and pretends to
be a judge investigating the story.
The farcical nature of the cover
up is pushed to its limits, with the
Maniac helping the police amply
demonstrate their already obvious
stupidity. He gets them to recon
struct the event and then rework it.
The explanations for the inconsis
tencies become more and more
ridiculous. The police, desperate to
get out of the horrible mess they've
created, swallow everything the
Maniac feeds them.
In much the same way that table

tennis is not tennis on the table, a
staged reading is not simply reading
on a stage. Seven actors sitting at a
table reading from scripts eliminated
the manic physical comedy that the
play requires, but this was adequately
compensated for by the performers'
energetic characterizations.
The props were slight and the in
teractions between the actors fleet
ing, yet there were just enough to get
a sense of what the play would be
like, and more than enough to ap
preciate the play's comedy even
when deprived of its arms and legs.
The dry reading of the stage direc
tions even served to highlight their
absurdity.
The play is highly specific to its
culture and times. The first act ends
with the Maniac inciting the police
officers to sing a 1970s Italian anar
chist anthem. The actors on a stage in
1990s Palo Alto had to admit that they
had no idea how this song went. Even
if they did, it was unlikely that the au
dience would be any better off for it.
The play refers to politicians who
are now dead, mentions events
Americans never knew of or cared
about and tries to unsettle a govern
ment that the American audience
didn't elect. The play is translated in
language only; its substance is still
entirely Italian, even if the Italians
are speaking English. Outside of
Italy the play becomes an act of
voyeurism, a chance for people to
look and laugh at other people's
problems without ever having been
associated with them. This staged
reading was also a reminder of how
sparse this sort of political comedy is
in America. It's hard to imagine any
one writing a farce about the
Rodney King beatings. Instead, we
either have exactly the sort of scan
dalized dramas that Fo so deplores
or hollow one-liners about the pres
ident's libido by Jay Leno and David
Letterman. While these one-liners
are perfectly amusing, they lack the
outrage that makes this play so com
pelling.
Fo wants us to appreciate the rot
of the entire system, not just its oc
casional visible symptoms. To treat
Pinelli's death as a tragedy and the
police's actions as horrific is simply
to label society's "unhealthv parts"
without considering the system as
a whole. To laugh at the police and
to comically show both their ideo
logical and (in 1970s Italy) actual
roots in fascism is to deprive them
of their dignity and deny the sys
tem a chance to make the death of
an innocent man seem like an iso
lated event. As Fo writes in the
play's prologue, "There is no
greater equalizer than the stupidity
of men â€” especially when those
men are in power."
