## Banter with a bassist an interview with Keith Moseley of String Cheese incident 
### Zachary Roberts Senior staff writer 
In late February, Intermission
spoke with Keith Moseley, bassist
for the Colorado-based band
String Cheese Incident. The
group is currently touring the
West Coast to support its self-re
leased third alburn, and Moseley
took the time to talk about why
the Bay Area is so receptive to the
band, what's on the new album
and why he likes playing bass.
Intermission: What's the
new tour look like?
Keith Moseley: After a few
weekend warm up dates in
Colorado, the tour will swing
down to Arizona and Southern
California, including places
like San Diego and Los Angeles,
where we've been before and
other places we haven't hit so
much like Santa Barbara. Then
we come up to Northern
California and Oregon.
I: This will be String Cheese
Incident's fourth time in the Bay
Area since last summer. Why are
we attractive to the band?
KM: The audiences are just
good and well-attuned to the
style of music we play. West
Coast folks are musically
spoiled; they get to see and ap
preciate lots of really good mu
sic. We've had fun there every
time. Plus, three guys in the
band are either from or have
lived on the West Coast, so
they've got lots of friends and
family out there.
I: How has it changed the
band to be playing at larger
clubs?
KM: We're stepping up from
club to theater-sized halls in
some places. We've got some
thousand-seater halls on the
bill, and we're trying to step up
the caliber of our shows from
being just a bar band. Having
good sound and good lights,
which are usually a part of
larger clubs, really helps us cre
ate a quality experience for the
concert-goers.
I: But you'll still play places
like the Fox in Boulder, Colo.
KM: Yeah, we play Boulder
every three months. The thing
about the Fox is that it's the
nicest club of its size that I
know of in the entire country.
I: Things must be going well
to jump from headlining the
Maritime to headlining the
Fillmore.
KM: Things are snowballing
for us nationally. We played
around 230 shows in 1997,
which is really a lot, and in 1996

we played just over 200 shows.
So all the hard work is starting
to pay off, and we're building a
grass roots fan base.
I: Does the Web have any
thing to do with that?
KM: Yeah. Our Web page is
"stringcheeseincident.com,"
and there's lots of stuff on it.
There's a chat room where peo
ple can post things about the
band, and there's also an elec-

tronic newsletter / digest of all
the posted messages. Last I
heard, subscription to the list
was 200 to 300 folks.
I: Do you read the posts?
KM: Not really. Sometimes
our manager prints up stuff
and shows it to the band. It's in
teresting to see show reviews
and to hear what people have to
say, good and bad, about us.
There's so much feedback we
don't try to keep up with it. It's
good for us to know what fans
are saying about us, both posi
tive and negative, and about
other bands, venues, what kind
of crowd goes to the shows and
the crowd behavior at our
shows. We try to learn from the
list but not worry about it.
We're not bent on pleasing

everyone; we're just doing what
makes us happy.
I: How was the New Year's
Eve gig at the Henry J. Kaiser
Auditorium in San Francisco?
KM: It was great to do a
Bill Graham Presents show.
It was our first and we thought
it came off great. It was fun
to play with our buddies
Leftover Salmon. Yeah, we've

played in front of
2500-3000 people
before. We've done
other big
California gigs like
High Sierra Music
Festival and the
Marin County
Music Festival, but
it was a special
evening. The
Fillmore is some-

thing we are definitely looking
forward to. Lots of great music
has gone down in that magical
building.
I: Speaking of those summer
shows, how is it different for
you to play outside?
KM: Summer days are the
glory days. In the summer the
majority of our shows are out
side, festival-type gigs, and we
love it. It's fun for us to meet
and play and hang out with
other musicians — I'd say that
from June to September, 80 per
cent of our shows are outdoors.
We love it — we're outdoor
people. The clubs are the neces
sity of it all.
I: Who are some of your fa
vorite musicians to play with?
KM: In the last year I think

we played maybe 10 shows with
Paul McCandless, who appears
on the new CD. In fact, he may
sit in for some of the West
Coast tour. He's been a great in
fluence and teacher. It was also
a real kick to share the stage
with Vince Welnick at New
Year's. He's really a nice guy,
very humble. We played with
David Grisman and the Quintet
last August, and again, it was
just amazing to play with some
one who has been one of our
musical heroes.
I:How would you describe
your group's sound?
KM: That's a tough one. I
think that people are beginning
to identify the band by the
sound of the individuals them
selves. It's really in the instru
mentation itself. Billy on the
acoustic guitar, Kyle on the
organ, Travis on the hand drum
— and Michael has a distinctive
thing going on with his electric
mandolin and violin. So it's
more the actual instrumentation
and each individual's creative

voice as we travel through the
various styles.
Something 1 realized while
we were making the new CD is
that the common thread
through it is that it's us playing.
It's not us trying to sound like a

bluegrass band, or a
jazz band, etc. It's us
with our interpreta
tion of all these styles,
slowly growing and
starting to gel.
I: What's up with
the new album?
KM: We spent
about three weeks all
told in the recording.
We were really psyched
to be off the road for a
while, so we took some
vacation after the New
Year's show and then

hit the studio to record "Round
The Wheel."
It's got 12 new originals, most
of which we've been working out
on the road for a while, which
gave them a chance to grow and
develop. We haven't been in the
studio since January of 1996, and
we have over 400 shows under
our belt since then. We've ma
tured and become more confi
dent. The album has a pretty
eclectic range of styles — it runs
from bluegrass to country to
Afropop and jazz. There's also a
couple of sit-in guests, like Paul
McCandless on pipes and Tony
Furtado on banjo.
I: Who writes the songs?
KM: We all write. Everyone
contributed to the new CD.
Billy does the bulk of the writ
ing since he's been writing the
longest, and we do more of his
tunes, but it's really a group
process. If someone comes to
rehearsal with a tune, it gets
stretched, pushed and pulled to
a new shape. Everyone puts his
mark on it and it becomes more
of an S.C.I, tune than it was be
fore. And everyone is loose with
that process. We say, "Let's make
it work for the band" and then
we figure out how to do that. It
becomes a band tune.
I: How'd you get started on
the bass?
KM: I was a guitar player
when S.C.I, was born, but Billy
was better then me, so 1
switched to bass and have been
on a pedal-to-the-metal bass
program ever since. It's been a
great growing and learning ex
perience, and I feel that it's what
I was meant to do. To be able to
drive the band rhythmically and
melodically is really a huge chal
lenge. We play so many kinds of
grooves — Latin jazz to blue
grass to R&B — that it is a chal
lenge to do all of them well.
I: Who have you been listen
ing to lately?
KM: An eclectic mix. Lately
I've been digging into old
Motown, like Oscar Peterson,
an old-time jazz piano player. I
like the new Bela Fleck live al
bum too. Pretty much anything
with heavy bass players.
I: One last question. What is
your favorite color?
KM: Green.

tronic newsletter / digest of all
the posted messages. Last I
heard, subscription to the list
was 200 to 300 folks.
I: Do you read the posts?
KM: Not really. Sometimes
our manager prints up stuff
and shows it to the band. It's in
teresting to see show reviews
and to hear what people have to
say, good and bad, about us.
There's so much feedback we
don't try to keep up with it. It's
good for us to know what fans
are saying about us, both posi
tive and negative, and about
other bands, venues, what kind
of crowd goes to the shows and
the crowd behavior at our
shows. We try to learn from the
list but not worry about it.
We're not bent on pleasing

everyone; we're just doing what
makes us happy.
I: How was the New Year's
Eve gig at the Henry J. Kaiser
Auditorium in San Francisco?
KM: It was great to do a
Bill Graham Presents show.
It was our first and we thought
it came off great. It was fun
to play with our buddies
Leftover Salmon. Yeah, we've

played in front of
2500-3000 people
before. We've done
other big
California gigs like
High Sierra Music
Festival and the
Marin County
Music Festival, but
it was a special
evening. The
Fillmore is some-

thing we are definitely looking
forward to. Lots of great music
has gone down in that magical
building.
I: Speaking of those summer
shows, how is it different for
you to play outside?
KM: Summer days are the
glory days. In the summer the
majority of our shows are out
side, festival-type gigs, and we
love it. It's fun for us to meet
and play and hang out with
other musicians — I'd say that
from June to September, 80 per
cent of our shows are outdoors.
We love it — we're outdoor
people. The clubs are the neces
sity of it all.
I: Who are some of your fa
vorite musicians to play with?
KM: In the last year I think

we played maybe 10 shows with
Paul McCandless, who appears
on the new CD. In fact, he may
sit in for some of the West
Coast tour. He's been a great in
fluence and teacher. It was also
a real kick to share the stage
with Vince Welnick at New
Year's. He's really a nice guy,
very humble. We played with
David Grisman and the Quintet
last August, and again, it was
just amazing to play with some
one who has been one of our
musical heroes.
I:How would you describe
your group's sound?
KM: That's a tough one. I
think that people are beginning
to identify the band by the
sound of the individuals them
selves. It's really in the instru
mentation itself. Billy on the
acoustic guitar, Kyle on the
organ, Travis on the hand drum
— and Michael has a distinctive
thing going on with his electric
mandolin and violin. So it's
more the actual instrumentation
and each individual's creative

voice as we travel through the
various styles.
Something 1 realized while
we were making the new CD is
that the common thread
through it is that it's us playing.
It's not us trying to sound like a

bluegrass band, or a
jazz band, etc. It's us
with our interpreta
tion of all these styles,
slowly growing and
starting to gel.
I: What's up with
the new album?
KM: We spent
about three weeks all
told in the recording.
We were really psyched
to be off the road for a
while, so we took some
vacation after the New
Year's show and then

hit the studio to record "Round
The Wheel."
It's got 12 new originals, most
of which we've been working out
on the road for a while, which
gave them a chance to grow and
develop. We haven't been in the
studio since January of 1996, and
we have over 400 shows under
our belt since then. We've ma
tured and become more confi
dent. The album has a pretty
eclectic range of styles — it runs
from bluegrass to country to
Afropop and jazz. There's also a
couple of sit-in guests, like Paul
McCandless on pipes and Tony
Furtado on banjo.
I: Who writes the songs?
KM: We all write. Everyone
contributed to the new CD.
Billy does the bulk of the writ
ing since he's been writing the
longest, and we do more of his
tunes, but it's really a group
process. If someone comes to
rehearsal with a tune, it gets
stretched, pushed and pulled to
a new shape. Everyone puts his
mark on it and it becomes more
of an S.C.I, tune than it was be
fore. And everyone is loose with
that process. We say, "Let's make
it work for the band" and then
we figure out how to do that. It
becomes a band tune.
I: How'd you get started on
the bass?
KM: I was a guitar player
when S.C.I, was born, but Billy
was better then me, so 1
switched to bass and have been
on a pedal-to-the-metal bass
program ever since. It's been a
great growing and learning ex
perience, and I feel that it's what
I was meant to do. To be able to
drive the band rhythmically and
melodically is really a huge chal
lenge. We play so many kinds of
grooves — Latin jazz to blue
grass to R&B — that it is a chal
lenge to do all of them well.
I: Who have you been listen
ing to lately?
KM: An eclectic mix. Lately
I've been digging into old
Motown, like Oscar Peterson,
an old-time jazz piano player. I
like the new Bela Fleck live al
bum too. Pretty much anything
with heavy bass players.
I: One last question. What is
your favorite color?
KM: Green.

The band. What a nice bunch of guys.
In late February, Intermission
spoke with Keith Moseley, bassist
for the Colorado-based band
String Cheese Incident. The
group is currently touring the
West Coast to support its self-re
leased third alburn, and Moseley
took the time to talk about why
the Bay Area is so receptive to the
band, what's on the new album
and why he likes playing bass.
Intermission: What's the
new tour look like?
Keith Moseley: After a few
weekend warm up dates in
Colorado, the tour will swing
down to Arizona and Southern
California, including places
like San Diego and Los Angeles,
where we've been before and
other places we haven't hit so
much like Santa Barbara. Then
we come up to Northern
California and Oregon.
I: This will be String Cheese
Incident's fourth time in the Bay
Area since last summer. Why are
we attractive to the band?
KM: The audiences are just
good and well-attuned to the
style of music we play. West
Coast folks are musically
spoiled; they get to see and ap
preciate lots of really good mu
sic. We've had fun there every
time. Plus, three guys in the
band are either from or have
lived on the West Coast, so
they've got lots of friends and
family out there.
I: How has it changed the
band to be playing at larger
clubs?
KM: We're stepping up from
club to theater-sized halls in
some places. We've got some
thousand-seater halls on the
bill, and we're trying to step up
the caliber of our shows from
being just a bar band. Having
good sound and good lights,
which are usually a part of
larger clubs, really helps us cre
ate a quality experience for the
concert-goers.
I: But you'll still play places
like the Fox in Boulder, Colo.
KM: Yeah, we play Boulder
every three months. The thing
about the Fox is that it's the
nicest club of its size that I
know of in the entire country.
I: Things must be going well
to jump from headlining the
Maritime to headlining the
Fillmore.
KM: Things are snowballing
for us nationally. We played
around 230 shows in 1997,
which is really a lot, and in 1996

we played just over 200 shows.
So all the hard work is starting
to pay off, and we're building a
grass roots fan base.
I: Does the Web have any
thing to do with that?
KM: Yeah. Our Web page is
"stringcheeseincident.com,"
and there's lots of stuff on it.
There's a chat room where peo
ple can post things about the
band, and there's also an elec-

We played around 230 shows
IN 1 997, WHICH IS REALLY A
LOT, AND IN 1 996 WE PLAYED
JUST OVER 200 SHOWS. So ALL
THE HARD WORK IS STARTING TO
PAY OFF, AND WE'RE BUILDING A
