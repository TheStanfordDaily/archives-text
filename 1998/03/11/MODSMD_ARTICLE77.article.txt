# movie review and interview
## Men With Guns an independent film from one of the greats 
### 
In the capital city of
an unidentified Latin
American country, Dr.
Humberto Fuentes (Argentine
actor Federico Luppi) leaves
his comfortable home and lu
crative practice for the moun
tains. After the recent death of
his wife and in light of his
own failing health, he is seek
ing the medical students he
had sent years ago to work in
Indian villages. But he en
counters the same tragedy
wherever he goes: his students
have all been killed by the
"hombres armados" ("men
with guns").
Thus begins John Sayles'
latest film, "Men with Guns,"
which like most of Sayles'
previous work is a multi lay
ered film with one overrid
ing message. Sayles again
takes us into a situation that
we normally would not have
chosen to see or acknowl
edge; that was the strength of
his 1996 film "Lone Star."
Much of the same intelli
gent, unsentimental atten
tion to detail furnishes the
modern parable of "Men
with Guns."
Along his journey,
Fuentes picks up stranded
misfits: a precocious or
phaned boy, an army de
serter, a wandering priest
without faith and a young
woman who hasn't spoken
since she was raped by sol
diers. Each of these people
has lost something vital.
And each character is a liv
ing testament to the brutal
ity of the "men with guns"

— survivors who live in
contrast to Fuentes' mur
dered students. The students
are seen in black-and
white flashbacks during
their medical training with
Fuentes. These images serve
as devastating counterpoints
to the verbal accounts of
their deaths.
The identity of the "men
with guns" doesn't really
matter. They take on greater
implications as symbols of
evil, although they are osten
sibly soldiers belonging to
the official army or the guer
rillas. The important thing
about these men is not
whose side they're on but
that they have the power to
kill indiscriminately — and
they do.
Although this film might
resonate more if you have a
conception of political vio
lence in Latin America, it in
volves you wholly through
Fuentes' position of privi
lege. For good measure,
there are a couple of oblivi
ous American tourists
(Mandy Patinkin and
Kathryn Grody) who know
the history of the Indian ru
ins in the area but nothing
about the people presently
living there.
I'he dialogue is almost en
tirely in either Spanish or in
digenous languages (with
English subtitles), but don't
let that put you off. While
"Men With Guns" might not
be as easy to relate to as
"Lone Star," it is nevertheless
an absorbing look at the re
ality our own privilege so
easily hides.
