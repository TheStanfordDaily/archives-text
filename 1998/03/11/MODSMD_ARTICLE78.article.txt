# Director John Sayles
## 
### Wendy Lee Contributing writer 
John Sayles is widely con
sidered to be one of this coun
try's foremost independent
filmmakers. His first ac
claimed feature, "Eight Men
Out" (1988), chronicled the
1919 World Series scandal. His
subsequent films have ranged
from the Louisiana-set
"Passion Fish" (1992) to the
charming Celtic fairytale "The
Secret of Roan Inish" (1994).
In 1996, his film "Lone Star," a
multi-generational drama set
against the past/present bor
der of Texas and Mexico, won
him wide critical acclaim and
popularity, as well as an Oscar
nomination for Best Original
Screenplay.
Intermission talked with
Sayles about the inspiration
for his latest film, "Men With
Guns," and his views on inde
pendent filmmaking.

Intermission: Location
has always been a very impor
tant part of your films. Can
you explain why you decided
not to specifically identify the
setting of "Men With Guns"?
John Sayles: The incidents
in "Men With Guns" are from
all over the world. Some of
them took place in Bosnia,
some in the former Soviet
Union, some in Africa and
some in Vietnam. The speech
that you hear the son-in-law
make in the restaurant, when
he's talking about, "Oh, we've

lived with these people for
centuries," is something that I
hear in Latin America a lot,
but it's pretty much verbatim
what I heard in Georgia dur
ing the American civil rights
movement. I didn't want to set
it in a specific country partly
because I would have felt I
had to be responsible to the
details of those particular
politics, whether it were
Brazilian or Guatemalan or El
Salvadorian. Each one is its
own very specific case. But
also 1 didn't want people to be
able to say, "Oh, that could
only happen in that place."
I: Are there aspects of Dr.
Fuentes' character that you
identify with?
JS: Well, I think that once
he knows something, he does
n't turn back. That is what's
heroic about him. He is a guy
who has not done what he
should have done. He's gotten

his students in
mortal danger
through his own
fault. But once it's
put in front of him,
he doesn't turn
back. He wants to
go to the end of it
even if it's painful
for him.
And I think that
like a lot of people,
I'm not a saint. I'm
not somebody who
can every day feel
everybody's pain or
everbody's prob
lem. But once it's
put in front of me, I
want to know more
about it. I got inter
ested in people
speaking Spanish in
this country be
cause my mother's
parents lived in
Hollywood, Fla. I
kept going down to

Miami when I was a kid be
fore, during and after the
Cuban revolution. I've lived in
places where 1 was right on the
border or actually in an
African-American commu
nity. These are people I have in
my life who I don't see on the
screen, or I don't see the diver
sity of what's there on the
screen. That's something I
want to include in my stories.
I: Were the two American
tourists in the film supposed
to be representative of us?
JS: The point of them, as 1
always said to the actors, is

that they're "not the ugly
Americans, [they're) the
Teflon tourists. None of this
sticks to [them] emotionally."
Although the tourists take the
exact same geographical jour
ney that Dr. Fuentes does,
every time they cross paths
with him they're the same and
he's different. And they've
gone through some of the
same things and they've
learned some of the same
things, but they're American
citizens. It's so easy for us
Americans to just say, "That's
Third World business. Thank
God, I'm glad it's not quite
that bad in our country."
Certainly there are a lot of
countries in the world that
have done a pretty good job of
messing up their own cultures
without American help. But
like it or not, American culture
and foreign policy have af
fected a lot of places nega
tively. Maybe we stopped go
ing there in body a hundred
years ago, but the legacy of
world economies and political
control is still there, certainly
in Latin America.
I: Do you feel that it's your
responsibility as a filmmaker
to show that?
JS: Well, you can make a
movie that's just entertaining.
That's all you intend to do, so
then your responsibility is to
entertain the audience but
nothing else. With the movies
that we make, we're trying to
do a little bit more than that.
We're trying to have people
leave them thinking about
their lives and the world
around them. So once you get
in there, I think your responsi
bility is to try and tell as much
of the truth as you know.
I: What does it mean to you
to be called an independent
filmmaker?
JS: For me, the only thing
that's important about that
definition is that there is an
independence of thought.
And that what you're inde
pendent of is careerism and
concerns that are only com
mercial. So if the story de
mands you go in a certain di
rection and you would make
more money going in another
direction, you go in the direc
tion the story is taking. And
you can do that with studio
money. It's hard no matter
how vou do it.
