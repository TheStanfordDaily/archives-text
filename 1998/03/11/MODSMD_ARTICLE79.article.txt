# The 						Controversy Surrounding Testimony
## 
### Alex Tung Staff writer 
When you think a cappella,
you think blended voices and
vocal percussion. You think pop
rock, '80s megamixes, African
rhythms and the occasional
comedy sketch. You probably
don't think God, Christianity,
personal stories about
Christianity, or crosses dangling
around necks. But then again,
you're probably not thinking
about Testimony.
What is Testimony?
"Now this is bold a cappella,"
proclaimed the audition
fliers earlier this year. Singing
what is known as contemporary
Christian music, a cappella
group Testimony certainly has
reason to claim this sense of
boldness. Facing the fact that
outsiders mistakenly associate
the group with the political reli
gious right and television evan
gelists, Testimony struggles to
overcome Christian stereotypes
and societal prejudices with
every performance.
"People tend to think that
Christianity lacks intellectual
rigor, and that it's kind of
hokey," said senior Henry Hsu,
director of Testimony. 'We try to
get away trom the stigma and
the tainted prejudice, and make
it more of a personal story."
Founded seven years ago, the
group began rather informally,
according to Hsu. It was started
by two people who enjoyed

Christian contemporary music
and wanted to start a group to
sing that style of music.
The group sings at dorm
shows, churches and weddings
and holds annual Christmas and
spring concerts. At each show,
group members step forward to
give a personal account of their

experiences with
Christianity and life
in general between
songs. The tone is
not intended to be
preachy, but inti
mate — an oppor
tunity for the audi-

ence to listen, understand and
question.
Audience responses are mixed,
but generally polite, Hsu said.
"We're conscious of it, and we
try to address it,"he said.
"Most people are extra edgy
when they know we're religiously
affiliated," Hsu said. He noted
that the group does not try to
force its beliefs on its audience.
"We don't preach — rather,
it's like I'm telling you a story."
Since its inception, Testimony
has evolved from "a bunch of
Christians singing Christian
music" to a group which focuses
on challenging its audience to
"seriously think about
Christianity," Hsu said.
"In its infancy, it was not as di
rected, not as focused on the au
dience. Now we plan and think,
'OK, who's the potential person
in the audience?' " Hsu said. "We
try and think of how to make
[the performance) conducive to
those who aren't Christian."

Why Testimony?
Testimony is perhaps the least
known a cappella group on
campus, and yet it receives one
of the largest responses when it
performs — but the response is
not always positive.
Khan Lowe, a new member

Why would this group of singers place themselves in
situations where they'd receive cool to lukewarm
responses and averted eyes?

who has sung professionally and
works as a case writer at the
Graduate School of Business, in
dicated that his first dorm show
with Testimony was different
from his previous singing expe
riences. "I've never had an audi
ence where I'd try to make eye
contact, and maybe one out of
50 people would make eye con
tact back. I was just in awe of
that," he said.
Lowe said he was so stunned
by the audience's reaction that
he forgot the lyrics to the song
he was singing. "I was literally
making up the words to the
song, because 1 had just com
pletely blanked," he said.
Hearing about experiences
like this makes one wonder, why
put up with it? Why would this
group of singers intentionally
place themselves in situations in
which they would receive cool to
lukewarm responses and averted
eyes? Why choose to sing with
Testimony and not another a

cappella group that is almost
certain to be cheered off the
stage?
In a sense, the response of the
audience is exactly the reason
that the group continues doing
what it does.
"For us, a cappella isn't an
end, it's a means through which

we can express
what we be
lieve," senior
Valerie Hsieh
said.
This aspect
of the group
also enhances

the singing experience, according
to Hsu. When the music is "the
foundation of [our] life, in one
way or another that makes us
more serious about what we do,"
he said. Hsieh said she was drawn
to Testimony by "their boldness
in claiming what they claimed."
For some members, those
claims became a source of dis
comfort. Senior lennifer Lee ex
plained being uncomfortable
with that same boldness during
her freshman year.
"You've really got to believe
what you're saying," she said.
"My freshman year I wasn't
really sure about my
Christianity, and I wasn't really
happy about being in the group
[because of audience reactions).
I kind of hid the fact that I was
in Testimony. It wasn't the first
thing I would tell someone
when I met them."
lessening this discomfort for
the audience as well as the
group's members has become a

focal point of the group's efforts.
Freshman member Brenna
Peterson said she believes the
purpose of Testimony is to go
[into a dorm| and diffuse the
stereotypes |about Christianity
But what are those stereotypes,
and where do they come from?
The stigma of Christianity
There are 25 Christian min
istries among the 32 Stanford
Associated Ministries run out of
Memorial Church, and a
substantial percentage of the
student population is involved
in some sort of small group
Bible study, according to Rev.
Maurice Charles, associate dean
for religious life. Combined with
the numerous students who
attend Christian services
(Catholic and Protestant) every
Sunday, this would suggest a
campus that is accustomed to
having Christianity as a part of
its culture.
So why does Testimony re
ceive the often cool, stand-offish
welcome that it does?
"A number of people have
been burned by religion and
don't want to have anything to
do with it," Charles said.
He pointed to various exam
ples of being people who'd been
"burned," — those who'd grown
up with coercive, controlling
churches which did not encour
age the free expression of ideas;
lesbians and gays who found
that the church insisted that
they hide their sexual orienta
tion; people with deeply reli

gious parents who restricted
them in some way; cases where
religious professionals "abused
the power of their office"; mem
bers of minority traditions who
felt an imposition by the major
ity Christian church; and those
who have had unpleasant expe
riences with others trying to
convert them.
Most of these had to do in
some way with a person's reli
gious upbringing working against
free thought. Because of such an
upbringing, the person is likely to
be wary of anything having to do
with that particular religion.
Although he said he had not
experienced any adverse reac
tions himself, many Christian
faculty and students have com
plained of hostility toward them.
"From my perspective as a
University chaplain, I've been
surprised at how open people
are to religious questions and
my presence on campus... I've
never experienced discomfort
from others because I'm an
Episcopalian priest," he said,
"but I have heard from a hand
ful of younger faculty and
Christian students that they
perceive some overt hostility."
This hostility has less to do
with an association with the re
ligious right or other conserva
tive political views typically as
signed to Christians than it has
to do with the idea that religion
does not breed intellectualism,
Charles said.
"Many students who de
scribe themselves as conservative
Christians (generally Protestants)
feel that their intelligence is often
called into question," he said.
Despite this possible deter
rence, Charles noted that "stu
dents seem to be more comfort
able about being religious" than
they have been in the past.
Christians in general receive
a fair amount of discrimination,
not only from other groups, but
also from other Christians, ac
cording to Charles.
"Americans have the attitude
that religion is a private matter,
and they may not be comfort
able with religious display out
side of a church setting," he said.
"For many, your faith is per
sonal, and public display of it is
limited to Sunday at church."
Some have a desire to dissoci
ate themselves from the political
religious right and the often
maligned evangelists, but others
follow the ethos that public
evangelism is just plain impolite

and rude.
These are the issues and
stereotypes which Testimony
and other vocal Christian
groups must face. But all these
issues become the fuel that dri
ves Testimony forward, giving
its members all the more reason
to sing Christian music.
A cappella, shma cappella

Testimony vies with
seven other a cappella
groups on campus for
students' interest.
Although the a cap
pella tradition is not as
established here as in
East Coast schools,

competition among
groups ensues nevertheless. Due
to the numerous number of

shows, it seems easy at times to
get "a cappella'd out." But a var
ied range of styles ameliorates
the situation somewhat.
"The best thing about
Stanford a cappella is its diver
sity," said Matt Hempey, direc
tor of Fleet Street Singers, the
oldest a cappella group on cam
pus. "We have groups that per
form every genre of music.
Although there is a healthy
sense of competition to be as
good as possible, this diversity
enables us to take pride in our
own style without being pitted
against another group."
Testimony perhaps has a
more difficult time than the
other groups because of the neg
ative baggage that comes along
with being a Christian a cappella
group. Within a cappella circles,
however, cooperation is just as
prominent as competition.
"The leadership of other a
cappella groups is very support
ive of us," Hsu said.
Still, Testimony finds itself in

somewhat of a unique position,
in that it generally functions sep
arately from the other groups.
Every year, group leaders
meet to decide which of the au
ditionees they would like to ac
cept into which group, since
many try out for several ones.
Generally, however, those audi
tioning for Testimony tend not
to audition for others.

'I don't appreciate
proselytizing, and so I don't appreciate
such an explicit pronunciation of a
single viewpoint.'

"This actually turns out to be a
good thing for me," Hsu said,

"since I usually get to leave the
meeting early, and [the meetings]
can last until four in the morning."
While other groups pair up for
road trips and concerts,
Testimony largely operates alone.
"The only time we really have
contact with [Testimony] is
during auditions," said sopho
more Peter Westen, a member
of the Mendicants.
Although Testimony is not as
prominent as some of the other
groups, it nevertheless holds
their respect.
"1 always like watching a
group that believes in what
they're singing," Hempey said.
"Testimony's repertoire is obvi
ously very close to their hearts,
and knowing that a performer is
sincere always makes a show
more special."
Like any other a cappella
group, Testimony definitely has
its own culture, even though its
focus may be slightly different.
"Everyone has something in
common," Hsu said. "They all

like to sing, and they're all
Christian."
Belief in Christianity be
comes, of course, the main uni
fying factor in the group. Part a
cappella, part campus ministry,
Testimony provides its mem
bers with a forum in which to
discuss their Christianity.
"Another aspect of Testimony
that is important is that we have

a fellowship amongst
ourselves," Lowe said.
"That's one of the rea
sons I auditioned.
Sharing our faith is
something that enables
me to get through the
week sometimes."
When they bring this
sharing of faith to public

eye and ear, even in the form of
audition posters, some find the

group slightly overbearing.
"I don't appreciate prosely
tizing, and so 1 don't appreciate
such an explicit pronunciation
of a single viewpoint," said
sophomore Ross Venook.
"When I read their posters, it's
very directed. 1 feel like it's in
vading the public domain. You
read them and it's like reading a
sign that says, 'Jesus Christ is
Lord.' 1 feel almost accosted."
Venook said he didn't think
the group's message was consis
tent with the goals of
Residential Education.
"It's the proclaiming nature
that disturbs me," he said. "It's
great that people want to do
[what Testimony does), but it's
taking sides on an issue that is
n't really appropriate in a dorm
setting. Res Ed works hard to
present diversity — [Testimony
is] contrary to that."
Others don't see it that way.
"I think that a lot of their
songs are quite touching," said
junior Ivonne Mosquera.

"However, 1 have always
thought that if they would ex
pand their repetoire a bit, per
haps to include a few nonreli
gious songs, they would draw
more of a crowd and in turn
would be able to spread more of
God's word."
"Through my experience
with them, they are very low
key on the conversion front,"
said sophomore Tom Soule.
"They do not want to convert
anybody, they just want to
praise their god."
Despite Testimony's unique
position among groups on cam
pus, the a cappella experience
does hold a few universal char
acteristics.
"People join a cappella
groups for a variety of reasons,
Hempey said. "Most come from
a choral background and relish
the ability to sing music that
people like to listen to i unlike
the repertoire of many school
choirs). Some are excited by the
chance to perform for their
peers in a somewhat informal
setting. And most al! of us ap
preciate the camaraderie of be
ing in a group of people with
similar interests."
The friendships built in a
cappella groups become a large
part of their members' lives.
"You get used to being with
these people all the time, and
you get used to seeing them
three times a week at practice."
said Akhi Sista, a lunior and di
rector of Talisman a cappella. "A
big part of your life, when you
decide not to return, is gone."
Still, for members of
Testimony, it's just as difficult to
separate the Christian base
from the a cappella as it is diffi
cult to separate religion from a
person's identity.
"Dealing with religious issues
is dealing with people's
core identity," Charles said.
"Not only that, but it's dealing
with people's world view.
Challenging people's religious
ideas may be challenging how
they view the world."
Testimony seeks to do just
that: challenge its audience to
think about Christianity and how
they set- the world.
"People hear 'Christian' and
they think right wing, intoler
ant," Hsu said. "We try to present
Christianity and the gospel in a
wav that isn't offensive We trv to
challenge people within the
framework of entertainment.
