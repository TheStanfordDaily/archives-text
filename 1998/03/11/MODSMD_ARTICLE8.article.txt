# Graduate RAs lose funding
## 
### Govind Dandekar Contributing writer 
The University announced
yesterday that resident assis
tants in graduate dorms will no
longer be paid. This decision will
take effect fall quarter of 1998.
"The changes in graduate
RA positions are part of a $4
million budget cm in Housing
and Dining Services." said
Christine Griffith, the director
of graduate residences. "The de
cision was heavily influenced by
a shift in the way the University
provides support and services to
graduate students and student
families."
The University's new vision
for graduate students is more
holistic, and the support of the
graduate community will now be
shared through partnerships
with administrative and acade
mic offices. Griffith said. The
University hopes to continue the
community-building service
with volunteer graduate RAs.
"Our goal is to continue to
provide this support to students and student
families in conjunction with any newly
formed services." Griffith said.
Many current graduate housing residents
and graduate RAs expressed frustration
with the University's decision.
"The University doesn't realize that grad
uate RAs provide a great community service
at a minimal cost." said Jesse Adams, a doc
toral student in Mechanical Engineering and
RAin Crothers Memorial Hall.

Adams added that paying graduate RAs
is essential.
"It sends a message that the I 'niversitv
cares about graduate services and graduate
community development when graduate
RAs are paid. It the> are not paid, they
make not take their jobs as seriously or be
taken as seriously by other residents. The
RAs may not work as hard if the onl\ bene
fit is guaranteed housing."
Although the intentions of the I niversity
are appreciated, they are misguided. Adams
said.
Current graduate R As plan on discussing
this decision with the administration.
