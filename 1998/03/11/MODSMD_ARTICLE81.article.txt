"Voices from the Sky"
Depending on the mood you're in,
Dadawa's "Voices from the Sky"
makes excellent mellow mood music.
"Voices from the Sky" is all in
Chinese. But the language barrier is a
bonus rather than a problem.
Dadawa's pure soprano voice soars
over grand acoustics and wind instru-

ments and it's easy to see why she is called the "melodious god
dess." Some of her songs are serene, some are searching, but each
track on this album is a journey into spirituality, reminiscent of
Enya. Each song speaks to you with its entrancing beauty.
