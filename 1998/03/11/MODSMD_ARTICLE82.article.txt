# Sarah Jahn: Sparkle
## 
### 
Sparkle is not fast paced, nor is it mellow. Her rich
voice on track one, "Brand New Name," reminds me of
Natalie Merchant's delivery on "Because the Night." Jahn
sings about rebirth and change, asking "When's the
dusty dwelling call my heart a brand new name?"
Each song portrays a different element. A sharp guitar
becomes the focal point of track four's "Face," and the
rich, deep voice from track one becomes a whispering,
soft lilt of questions on the popular track five "Love
Learn Happy."
"What makes you laugh," she asks, "What makes you
learn, what makes you happy?"
