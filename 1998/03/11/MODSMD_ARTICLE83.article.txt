When I first listened to this
CD I thought, "What? Who's
that singing? Eddie Vedder? Is
this a Bob Marley tune? Whoa,
where did ska come into the
picture? Hey — is this Green
Day?" Of course, none of those
guesses were right.
It was The Erratics.
By shifting musical styles
with each song, The Erratics
shows that it has what it takes
to he a lean, mean, musically
multitasking machine. The
band uses elements from an ar
ray of musical genres, mimick
ing everything from the noto
riously deep-throated vocals of
Pearl jam to the head-bobbing
reggae guitar chords of Bob

Marley to the deep, heavy bass
stylings of Green Day.
Perhaps the only consistant
thing in this self-titled album is
that the band's name describes its
music: erratic.
The group doesn't try to
combine all the different ele
ments on any one particular
song. Rather, it seems to write
each song in a different genre
and cycle through different
styles on different tunes.
The first track, "Fence
Sitting," has a simple, catchy
reggae beat that immediately
catches your attention, even if
the largely indiscernible lyrics
don't. As the tune picks up
pace, some of the catchiness is

lost, but the repetitious chorus
line didn't last long enough for
me to get really annoyed.
Even within songs, the group
likes to mix up the tempos and
beats, alternating quick ska and
walking pace rhythms within
tunes like "Deranged" and
"Grain of Sand."
The Erratics like to create a
certain feeling with each tune,
and the band's pretty good at
it. Although the fast drumbeats
caused my interest to wane
during some songs, the album
overall deserves some attention
for its spastic, high-entropy ap
proach to music.
