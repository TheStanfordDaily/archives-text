# Cadillac Angels: Rest Stop Dance Party
## 
### 
Time to slop the hogs. Rest
Stop Dance Party, the debut al
bum by the Cadillac Angels, is a
cut-rate rip-off of the entire
rockabilly genre.
It's much worse than Southern
Culture on the Skids, way worse
than the Rev. Horton Heat and it
doesn't even show up on the
radar of the great Carl Perkins.
Musically, the album is a
joke. If it were making fun of
itself or being somehow self
deprecating, it'd be really
funny. But it's serious, which
makes the album ridiculous.
In addition to being bland,
most of the songs on this album
drift into the four- to -five minute
range, making them way too long.
It's like Cadillac Angels thought
they could avoid being poppy

simply by having longer cuts.
There are a few bright spots.
Songs featuring the vocals of
bassist Mickey Rae, like "Little
Bit 0' Lovin'," are at least listen
able. She's got the husky, sultry
vocals of Margo Timmins of the
Cowboy Junkies. And the guitar
work of Tony Balbinot at times
approaches passable blues
rhythm work.
But of the 19 tracks on this
album, only four are really
worthwhile. "Say You Care" is a
driving blues that echoes early
work by The Doors and
George Thoroughgood. "Link'n
Continental" is a fast instru
mental blues. "1 Give It All" is a
nice midtempo shuffle and
"Diane" is a slow, grueling in
strumental walkin' blues.

That's about it, though. I
won't bore you with details of
the many tracks that fail.
The Cadillac Angels try to turn
Southern Culture on the Skids'
unique psychedelic rockabilly into
a shtick, down to a big-haired fe
male bass player (Mickey Rae). But
the Cadillac Angels are to Southern
Culture on the Skids what the
Spice Girls are to the Beatles.
It's sad that in trying so hard,
Cadillac Angels tries too hard.
Every song is about cars, women,
or cars and women. The group
doesn't even give itself a chance.
This ain't no dance party.
Don't listen to the album. Don't
buy it. Don't think or talk about
it. In fact, burn this review and go
buy the "Twin Peaks" soundtrack!
