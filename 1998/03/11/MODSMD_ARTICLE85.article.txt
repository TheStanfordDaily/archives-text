# Various Artists:
## The 'Caught Up' Soundtrack
### 
Every once in a while,
a movie has a sound
track with more than
one decent song. It's
rare, but it's happened.
Following in the foot
steps of "Boomerang,"
"The Nutty Professor"
and "Waiting to Exhale,"
the "Caught Up" sound
track is a funky melange
with enough tracks to
satisfy both hip hop and
R&B tastes.
The soundtrack kicks
off with an intro by
Bokeem Woodbine, the
movie's star, and is fol
lowed by a new song
from Snoop, featuring
Kurupt. In traditional
"dogg style," Snoop tells it
like it is in his song "Ride
On / CaughtUp!"
Complaining about
the commercialization of
the gangster lifestyle,
"Niggas walking on like
they free agents," he re
minds us,"Nigga this ain't
no game / It's a mother
fucking way of life."
But this is not a West
Coast album. East and
West get equal playing
time and both are repre
senting with jiggy beats

and new songs from
Lost Boyz, Luniz, AZ,
Gang Starr, Inspectah
Deck and GZA and
Mack 10.
Three R&B songs
smooth out the hip
hop feel. Joe lends his
smoothed-out vocals to
a romantic cut, "U
Should Know Me,"
which is pleasantly rem
iniscent of his "Love
Scene." Some-thing for
The People, this time
without the female
back-up, gives a little
something on a melodic
"R.U. Down" and MC
Lyte drops her rhymes
on "I Like," a smooth
groove Aaliyah-like bal
lad from Shiro.
Shaggy, KRS-One and
Mad Lion get together on
"Ey yo! (The Reggae
Virus)," a tight song that
is a mixture of reggae and
rap. The song plays off
the beat from Bangles
1980s hit "Walk Like An
Egyptian."
There's a little some
thing here for everybody
and it's all good.
