"Like I Really Do," the first song on
Brownie Mary's Naked, makes lead
singer Kelsey Barber sound exactly
like No Doubt's Gwen Stefani. But the
resemblance stops there.
Although many of the songs begin
with a cleverly written introduction
that gets repeated throughout the
tune, each track tends to come off as
gimmicky rather than a sincere at
tempt at original music.
Not to say that Brownie Mary does
n't have its good points. The band's
members are definitely not lacking the
talent and drive to succeed, but the
band seems to have built the album
around a few creative sparks, leaving
the rest of it to mass-produced filler.
Cool guitar effects on the title track
make for a funky rhythmic introduc
tion, but the rest of the tune tends to
ward the mundane, contemporary Live
style of guitars and simple drums.
The use of bagpipes in, "Say You
Want Me," doesn't really do much ex
cept let the listener know that Brownie
Mary thinks bagpipes are cool.
The band on the whole has a dis
jointed style which would be hard to
follow if it weren't for the gimmicks in
each song. The tracks, though de
cently written and performed, re
minded me of pieces from other songs
and send the general message that,
"Hey, this has been done before."
Musicianship isn't lacking. Brownie
Mary just doesn't concentrate on cre
ating catchy, cohesive and unique
songs.
It's difficult, and even impossible,
to expect every new band to fashion
an immediate breakthrough in musi
cal style, but those bands which can
capture a "new sound" will be the
most successful. Brownie Mary proba
bly doesn't fall into this latter cate
gory, but the group has a sparkling
light of potential which just might be
worth checking out.
