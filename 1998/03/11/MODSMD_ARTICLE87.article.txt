## M 120 Minutes Live 
### 
I remember being a sophomore in high school
and watching one of my best friends rave about
Bad Religion performing "American lesus" on
MTV's "120 Minutes." I've always felt that no
other Bad Religion song could possibly compare
to the one on this badly-recorded videotape.
Now that very song has been released on CD,
together with 13 more memorable clips from the
Sunday late-night video show.
It's basically a tour through the live sounds of
the '90s. The album starts off with the catchy
drumbeats of Oasis's early hit "Supersonic." There
are cool versions of "Kiss Off" by the Violent
Femmes and "Undone (The Sweater Song)" by
Weezer. Evan Dando has an introspective piece
called "It's About Time," and Bjork does a really
trippy version of "Aeroplane." The Sex Pistols,
The Verve Pipe, Porno For Pyros and even Thev
Might Be Giants are featured
The one complaint I have about "120 Minutes
Live" is the quality of some of the recordings. A few
of the tracks are scratchy in places and during
Radiohead's "Fake Plastic Trees," you even lose
sound on one side.
You'd think MTV would have better equipment.
