## The
						Big Lebowski Various Artists: ‘The Big Lebowski' soundtrack 
### 
"The Big Lebowski" draws its
strength from a bizarre plot and
an eccentric cast of characters. It's
no surprise then, that the sound
track offers an equally quirky and
befuddling smorgasbord of clas
sic rock, opera and techno.
Carter Burwell, who has done
all of the Coen brothers' music in
the past, arranged the score. "The
Big Lebowski" is artfully comple
mented by a mix of classic sounds
that evoke the '60s and '70s. But
don't expect any Credence
Clearwater Revival or Marvin
Gaye — that would be too easy.
Bob Dylan heads up the musi
cal mayhem with "The Man In
Me," a folksy ditty that is much
more melodic than other recent
songs. Elvis Costello gets raw on
the guitar in "My Mood Swings."
This song is very Costello and
might even remind the listener of
"Watching the Detectives."
After a few mainstream songs,
however, this soundtrack delivers
a spooky, almost primal assort
ment of grunts and breathy har
monies with artists like Meredith
Monk and YMA Sumac.
The strangest song on this al
bum is the Gipsy Kings' rendition
of "Hotel California" — every bit
as feisty as you would expect from
this group, but its contrast to the
Eagles' original makes this version
all the more ... bizarre.
But bizarre seems to be the
theme in this musical endeavor.
Nina Simone's "I Got it Bad and
That Ain't Good" is a soft piano
piece. It's followed by Carter
Burwell's "Technopop," which is
anything but a soft piano piece.
The pure randomness of musi
cal genres on the CD doesn't make
for a very cohesive listening expe
rience, and I found it difficult to
enjoy the album as a whole at any
given time. But while you may not
keep this one close to your car's
CD player at all times, you'll defi
nitely be enticed to check out the
movie and see what the hell it
could be about!
