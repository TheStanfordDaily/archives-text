# Bowling balls and Nihilists
## 'The Big Lebowski' brings out the Coens' weirdness 
### 
With characters named
The Dude, Jesus, Bunny and
the Nihilists, "The Big
Lebowski" isn't even remotely
attempting to be your average
movie. Since the writer, direc
tor and producer combo of
Joel and Ethan Coen is the
creative force behind the film,
this isn't too surprising.
However, "The Big Lebowski"
is a far cry from "Fargo," the
Coen brothers' last effort.
Frequently verging on the

surreal, this movie is
trying very hard to
be bizarre, and it suc
ceeds. Additionally,
almost the entire
film is hysterically
funny.
Ranging from
chorus line dream
sequences to ear
chomping fist fights,
"The Big Lebowski"
is a movie where
everyone seems to be
having a grand time
as each quirky char
acter engages in the
rapid-fire dialogue
that the Coens are so
skilled at writing.
At the film's center
is The Dude (Jeff

Bridges), who is ostensibly
the most laid-back mellow
guy to ever enter the greater
Los Angeles area. He is a big
devotee of bowling. The
Dude is fairly hyper and a bit
whiny, which takes away
from the aura he is supposed
to be giving the movie. But
then again, these characteris
tics make sense considering
the misfortunes that befall
the man whose given name is
Jeff Lebowski.
This name is crucial to the
plot, as it is shared by a con
niving millionaire whose

wife is kidnapped. Mistaken
identity leads to The Dude's
unwitting involvement in the
kidnapping and subsequent
disasters. Considering the
fact that The Dude's favorite
rug is urinated upon, his best
friend Walter (John
Goodman) is a gun-happy
veteran, and he is being
stalked by a band of rodent
toting Nihilists, The Dude
has every right to complain.
Jeff Bridges just doesn't
seem quite right as The
Dude, although his trade
mark jelly shoes are smash
ing. Everyone else in the film
is absolutely perfect, which
gives "The Big Lebowski" the
energy it needs to overcome
occasional over-the-top mo
ments. Julianne Moore is
fantastic as Maude Lebowski
(of the millionaire
Lebowskis), a wacky artist
whose main interest is female
genitalia. John Turturro
steals all of his scenes as
Jesus, a rival bowler cloaked
in skintight jumpsuits.
The most ravingly funny
part of the movie lies with the
Nihilists, a group of Germans
(one of whom is played by
Flea) who shout, "We believe
in nothing!" as they sic the
Dude with a marmot. This
kind of humor is the hall
mark of the Coen brothers
and makes "The Big
Lebowski" overcome a disap
pointing ending and a few
frames that seem frighten
ingly influenced by Quentin
Tarantino. If the Nihilists
were going to chuck it all and
believe in one thing, it should
be the Coen brothers, bowl
ing balls and all.
