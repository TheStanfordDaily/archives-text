# The 						chase goes On...
## but not much is new with 'U.S. Marshals' 
### 
"U.S. Marshals" should have been
called "The Fugitive 2." Considering the
quality of "The Fugitive," this is not
necessarily a bad thing. Unfortunately,
"U.S. Marshals" is not very original, be
cause almost everything that was in
"The Fugitive" is replicated in some
form in this picture.
This time the special effects are
much bigger but not really better. The
action begins when a plane that is
transporting convicts must make an
emergency landing. The U.S. Marshal
team from"The Fugitive" is called in to
chase down Sheridan (Wesley Snipes),
the lone escapee who is wanted for
killing two agents.
Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), the
chief deputy marshal, is as committed
as ever to bringing in his fugitive. The
chase takes the marshals everywhere
from swamps to downtown New York.
Some of the most exciting scenes in
clude a cemetery shoot-out and a
fistfight between Sam and Sheridan in
the holds of a freighter.
Sheridan's most spectacular escape
from Sam is when he leaps from an

apartment building
onto a departing
downtown train.
Unfortunately, even
this death-defying
stunt was almost an
exact copy of Harrison
Ford's leap from a
dam in"The Fugitive."
"U.S. Marshals" is
more secretive about
the fugitive's situation
than the previous
movie was. This time
there is no doubt that
Sheridan is the killer,
but his motive for
killing the two agents
is uncertain. He claims
that he was set up by
someone else in his
government organiza
tion. Towards the end,
it becomes unclear

whether Sheridan is really the bad guy.
I also liked the fact that the person
who framed Sheridan goes to great
lengths to eliminate him. The resulting
three-way battles among Sam, Sheridan
and this unknown perpetrator are
much more exciting than those in"The
Fugitive."
The characters in "U.S. Marshals" are
well developed, and the actors do a
great job of bringing them to life. Jones'
performance is without a doubt the
most enjoyable. His dry sense of humor
along with his total self-confidence are
not new to his roles, but it remains fun
to watch. In one of the opening scenes,
Sam busts some criminals while
dressed in a yellow chicken suit that he
has to wear for the stakeout. Comical
diversions like this distinguish this
movie from the original.
Ultimately, "U.S. Marshals" is clearly
a sequel to "The Fugitive." To decide
which one is better is tough to say, but
as an action-suspense film, "U.S.
Marshals" is a great picture.
