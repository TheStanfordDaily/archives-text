# 'Hush' up
## Gwyneth's new movie should be silenced 
### 
"Hush," a film that's been sort of
ready for two years, is finally being
released. The film was ready to go in
1996, but it got bad screening re
views. The producers have spent the
past two years trying to make the
film more appealing, but ultimately
all the work may have been in vain.
While the story's premise is very
interesting, the execution of this
psychological thriller falls short of
delivering potential greatness.
The story begins when Helen
(Gwyneth Paltrow), the girlfriend of
Jackson Baring (Jonathan Schaech),
visits the Baring estate one weekend.
Despite her use of contraceptives,
she becomes pregnant. As a result,
the couple decides to marry and
move to the estate. This decision is
also the consequence of a request by
Jackson's mother Martha (Jessica
I.ange) for help at the farm and a
mysterious attack on Helen at her
New York home.
As the pregnancy progresses,
Helen starts to find out strange
things about the history of the
Barings. The secrets surrounding the
death of Jackson's lather are only the
tip of the iceberg. Helen starts to see
a connection between the Baring
family secrets and the strange things

that have been happening to her
since she became pregnant.
Frighteningly, the unborn baby
seems to be the cause of all these
strange events.
While this story perfectly lends it
self to melodrama, I still found the
acting too exaggerated. The psycho
logically dysfunctional characters in
"Hush" are immensely interesting,
but they are portrayed with a lack of
dimension. In the end, interesting
characters are turned into flat
stereotypes. On the other hand,
Nina Foch's portrayal of Jackson's
grandmother and Paltrow's por
trayal of Helen are consistently en
joyable.
While the story really had the po
tential to be consistently interesting,
some parts were just too slow.
Luckily, the more suspenseful mo
ments helped to keep my interest at
a decent level throughout the film.
The final half hour is magnificently
paced and executed, but unfortu
nately, the unpolished ending turns
out to be a big disappointment.
"Hush" is a good example of how
bad movies will never become good
by merely tinkering with them for a
long time.
