## Old male author seeks young male actor 'Love and Death on Long Island' is about an unusual infatuation 
### 
Director Richard Kwietniowski
moves skillfully beyond the
stereotypes of a stuffy British
intellectual and a teen heartthrob to
create a masterful celebration of
modernity in "Love and Death on
Long Island."
The film chronicles the adventures of
Giles Death (John Hurt), a middle-aged
man with a clipped accent and large col
lection of nondescript suits. He has
spent the majority of his existence in a
dark mahogany room churning out lit
erary masterpieces. On a rare excursion
into the outside world, Giles falls prey to
Hollywood's latest blockbuster, a film
brimming with crude jokes and stereo
types titled "Hotpants College 2" star
ring Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley).
Surprisingly, Giles finds depth and
passion both in the fabric of the film
and in the brooding young actor who
plays the lead. The film opens his eyes
to a world that he has been carefully
ignoring for years and fosters in him
an intense interest for all things new.
From radio to movies to television to
magazines and videos, Giles takes one
step after another into the brightly
colored world of popular culture and
media, finding beauty where few have
thought to look for it.
As he rents Ronnie's films and

spends time poring over magazines
and cutting out pictures of the actor,
Giles cultivates something like a
teenage crush. The infatuation inten
sifies into something deeper; Giles
senses the two share a distinct bond as
artists leading "solitary existences."
Priestley's character is easy to take
seriously only because he portrays
himself: a nonexceptional actor en
dowed with syrupy sincerity. Giles fi
nally succeeds in befriending Ronnie
through remarkable determination
that is fueled by his intense love.
However, he learns that the young ac
tor is hardly the creative genius he had
imagined.
Perhaps disappointed, but certainly
not disillusioned, Giles' confrontation
with reality forces him to question his
conservative lifestyle. If a deliberately
fluffy flick like "Hotpants College 2"
can cause one man to redirect his am
bitions and interests (to rediscover
life), a truly insightful film like "Love
and Death and Long Island" will have
at least an equally significant impact
on viewers.
