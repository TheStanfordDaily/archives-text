# No real blondes in Hollywood
## This movie fails to find a fair-haired girl... and a plot 
### 
Daryl Hannah plays the title
character in"The Real
Blonde," which does not bode
well, considering that the last film in
which Hannah had this distinction
was 1993's "Attack of the 50 Foot
Woman." This film manages to
achieve a degree of respectability (far
surpassing the debacle that was
"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"), but
not much else.
The subject of the film is the inter
twined worlds of modeling, soap op
eras and music videos in New York
City. Given the nature of these indus
tries, it is obvious from the beginning
that the film's director (Tom DiCillo
of "Living in Oblivion" fame) is set
ting us up for another plotless, stale
commentary about the superficiality
of the image industries.
The story starts out by focusing on
Joe (Matthew Modine) and Bob
(newcomer Maxwell Caulfield), two
struggling actors who are best friends.
Bob finds work in a soap opera, and

their paths diverge from there as the
film devolves into a web of loosely
connected stories. The title refers to
Bob's continuing struggle to find a
woman who is a real blonde. Among
the various characters that become
involved in the lives of loe and Bob
are a supermodel played by Bridgette
Wilson ("Mortal Kombat") and a
Madonna body-double played by
Elizabeth Berkeley ("Showgirls"), nei
ther of whom are real blondes.
In contrast to "Living in Oblivion,"
where DiCillo focused on the humor
surrounding the mishaps of a low
budget film production, "The Real
Blonde" is centered primarily around
the dramatic and moral issues that
those involved with the image-ori
ented industries undergo. Sadly, the
humor is lost, despite the presence of
such talented comic artists as
Christopher Lloyd, Buck Henry and
Dave Chappelle.
The film does contain some inter
esting elements. At a certain point in
the movie, we begin to realize that
"The Real Blonde" is not just criticiz
ing the three industries for their ob
session with sex objects and artifice.
It is also criticizing itself for focusing
on the same artificial reality. The
startling intrusions of intermittent
dream sequences are also pleasantly
appealing.
Ultimately, despite solid perfor
mances by Modine, Caulfield and
Berkeley, the film fails to follow
through with any true substance.
"The Real Blonde" is as artificial as
the world that it portrays.

Elizabeth Berkeley can only dream of
being a real blonde.
