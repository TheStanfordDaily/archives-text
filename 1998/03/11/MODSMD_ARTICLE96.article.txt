## An ear cleaner? 
### 
So it's Dead Week and
you're completely over
whelmed by work and end
of-quarter stress.
Overworked, under-played?
Why not take a load off?
Relax, take some personal
downtime. You know what
I'm getting at.
Don't let your fingers do the
walking! Get yourself a vibrator!
Let's start with the electric
(plug-in) vibrator, the "body
massagers" you might see at
Sharper Image. The illustri
ous history of the electric vi
brator began in 1869 with the
invention of a steam-powered
massager. Patented by an
American doctor, it was de
signed as a labor-saving med
ical tool for use in the treat
ment of "female disorders."
That means hysteria.
The electric vibrator is
known for its more intense vi
brating power. There is also the
coil-operated model that comes
with fun attachments specially
curved or textured to reach
those hard to-reach spots!
These vibrators arc pieces
of high technology so they're
a bit pricier, some costing up
ward to SIOO. But you get
what you pay for' Battery vi
brators have the advantage of
being smaller, cheaper and
portable. The hard plastic,
cylindrical ones are more
powerful -md durable than
the vinyl,. übber or jelly ones.
The latter can be ridged, rip
pled, textured or even molded
to a more natural likeness.
Available in multiple fash
ionable coiors, you can acces
sorize right down to your vi
brator!
A variation on the battery
vibrator theme is the bullet or
egg, a small egg-shaped vibra
tor that can be inserted vagi
nally or anally and can also
stimulate externally. These and
other battery-operated vibes
come with an attached battery
pack with variable speeds.
If you're in favor of some
thing gentler and quieter,
consider the jelly, vinyl or
rubber vibe route. These
don't provide vibrations as
intense (some find the more
powerful ones overwhelm
ing), and they are softer and
more flexible.
Available in an extremely
wide variety of shapes, sizes
and colors, these hand
crafted vibrators are really
works of art!
Legend has it that cen
turies ago in Japan, it was
considered taboo to make sex
toys resembling genitalia. As a

result, dildos were carved to
look like living creatures.
Vibrator manufacturers
have followed this ancient lead
by creating vibrators in truly
bizarre, yet fascinating shapes.
You can even get one
called the "Jolly Vibrating
Cucumber!" How's that for
odd marketing?
Dildos are like vibrators
without the vibrating. Dildos
are preferable for use in har
nesses. For those who enjoy
the feeling of fullness as op
posed to focused stimulation.
Most dildos are made out
of silicone, which retains
body heat and is easy to clean
— or rubber, which is less ex
pensive but not as durable.
Feel like killing two birds
with one stone? There are also
the double-headed dildos.
Ah, le petit-mort!
Anal toys, also known as
"plugs," are smooth, seamless,
often diamond-shaped plugs
with a flared base. Some also
vibrate! If you've ever seen an
anal plug, you might experi
ence a moment of shock and
a twinge of fear.
"Dear God! Can that fit in
there?"
Yes.
The average plug is wider
than one's anus. The key here,
as with all anal play, is relax
ation, communication and
ABOVE ALL, LUBRICATION!
Lots of lube is essential for
safe and enjoyable anal fun.
A health note here: any sex
toy that can be used anally or
vaginally must be washed af
ter anal stimulation and be
fore any approach towards
the vagina. Although these
two orifices are close together,
that does not mean that they
should be "swapping spit."
The anus and rectum har
bor lots of bacteria that the
sensitive vagina finds terribly
offensive and can provoke
nasty infections.
This is also an important
note in the care of all vibra
tors, dildos and plugs. All toys
need to be washed regularly
to prevent yeast and other in
fections. This is also just good
hygiene, so always wash your
sex toys with soap and water!
A well-known and rep
utable place to find all these
fun items is Good Vibrations
in San Francisco. Offering a
wide selection of toys, oils,
books and everything else you
could want in a sexual acces
sory, Good Vibrations is run
by helpful people whose only
desire is for you to feel com
fortable in your sex toy expe
rience. They also have a Web
site and provide online order
ing (order in sex toys!)
Now go have some good,
clean fun!
