# Sauer grows in the small forward position
## Junior forward adds leadership qualities during Stanford's run 
### Ben Hur Senior staff writer 
If you remember him only as the man who
sank the game-winning shot against Arizona
last season, you've missed quite a bit.
Junior forward Peter Sauer's contributions
to Stanford's success is substantial, but his ac
tual value to the team may escape the notice of
the average fan.
"He's a real mature guy that everybody re
spects." said Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "He's bright and articulate, and he
takes a leadership role."
Last season, Sauer shined against Arizona,
nailing a baseline jumper off a Brevin Knight
pass, sending Maples Pavilion into an absolute
frenzy. But a lot has changed.
For one thing, Sauer is playing a different
position. After playing power forward last
year. Sauer made the transition to small for
ward this season in order to make room for
Stanford's five power forwards. So he went
from having to guard guys like A.J. Bramlett
to euys like Michael Dickerson. Not an easy

He's very vocal. If he sees someone on the team that needs encouragement,
he'll go up to the guy and give him all the encouragement he needs.'

job.
"It took a lot of work over the summer,"
Sauer said. "I did a lot more work on my
quickness and shooting. It was tough."
The work has definitely paid off. Sauer has
provided offensive punch from the perimeter,
along with a steady defensive presence. His
heady play has also earned him some easy
points, along with the respect of his coaches
and teammates.
"He can really shoot the ball; he's got good
touch," Montgomery said. "He's a real un
selfish kid as far as the team goes. If he doesn't

have a big night, it doesn't bother him. Ik
knows he's going to have his opportunities."
Perhaps even more important to the team
than Sauer's scoring production is the leader
ship he provides both on and off the court. As
one of the more vocal leaders on the team,
Sauer has provided wisdom and encourage
ment all season.
"He's very vocal — he's a leader," said ju
nior guard Arthur Lee. "If he sees someone
on the team that needs encouragement, he'll
go up to the guy and give him all the encour
agement he needs.
"He's always ready to play. You might not
be able to see it as the average fan, see the in
tensity that he has on the court."
Sauer, like just about everyone else, never
expected Stanford to jump out to its 18-0 start.
So when Stanford slumped by losing three of
its next four, Sauer and the other Cardinal vet -
erans knew how to respond.
"1 just tried to tell the younger guys to keep
their heads up." Sauer said. "We just had to
keep practicing hard and keep our level of
confidence."

That attitude has helped the Cardinal win
seven of its last eight games. Stanford will take
its deep, sharpshooting team into the Midwest
Region, hoping for a trip to the Final Four in
San Antonio, Texas.
Along the way, the Card can expect some
close games, and some wonder who will have
the ball if Stanford needs a bucket in crunch
time.
"I definitely feel comfortable in that situa
tion," Sauer said. "I'm willing and ready to
take that shot."
It's not like he hasn't done it before.
