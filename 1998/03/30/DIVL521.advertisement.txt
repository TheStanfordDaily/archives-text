UNDERGRADUATE
RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES
IN CHEMISTRY
The Chemistry Department will award several
undergraduate research fellowships for the summer
quarter. Interested students are encouraged to contact
individual faculty members for information on how to
apply. A brochure describing the research interests of
the faculty and a brief description of the Program are
available in the Chemistry Department Office (Mudd
121). A short proposal, an unofficial transcript and a
letter from a sponsoring faculty member should be
submitted to Prof. Waymouth by April 3, 1998.
Individuals from underrepresented minorities are
especially encouraged to apply.
