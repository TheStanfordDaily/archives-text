An Open Letter to Students
Planning to Attend Law School
from
U.S.News & World Report
Dear Student:
DON'T YOU JUST HATE TO BE GRADED? Well, by their shrill protests about U.S.New's& World Report law school
rankings, so do most of the deans of the law schools you are considering. 1 lowevcr, as a law school graduate with both a
J.D. and a LL.M. degree, 1 can tell you that these same deans will subject you to rigorous grading. You will be required
to endure lectures from tenured professors who have not changed their class notes since the Battle ol Hastings. I hen,
after attending class for a full semester, you will be given one exam to determine your grade. One exam, one semester,
one grade. One roll of the dice to measure your performance.
At U.S.Nc\vs& World Report we are far more equitable (to use a legal term). We have a multi laceted, multi
dimensional, sophisticated ranking system developed and evolved over many years to give you guidance on what
may be one of your largest financial investments and certainly one of the most important choices tor your career in
law and perhaps beyond. While our law school rankings should not be the only criteria in your choice oi a law
school, they should certainly be an important part of the analysis.
Get your copy of U.S.News & World Report's Best Graduate Schools guide on newsstands now. Or, to make it easier for
you to see the book that 164 law school deans would prefer you not see (notwithstanding their commitment to the First
Amendment), call 1 800 836 6397 (ask for extension 5105) and I w ill arrange for a copy of the book to be sent directly
to you at SI off the newsstand price* This will also ensure that you have a copy of these important rankings because, as
a result of publicity surrounding the deans' determination to have you ignore the rankings, they are a very hot item.
These law school rankings are a small part ol our philosophy of News Yon ( an Use' information we bring you in each
issue of the magazine to help you manage your life.
Good luck in law school and good luck on making the right choice.
Kindest Regards.
Sincerely.
