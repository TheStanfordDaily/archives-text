Faculty Research Grants
William and Flora Hewlett Foundation Grants support summer interdisciplinary
research projects on poverty-related issues. The grants fund travel and modest living costs for research in
Latin America.
DEADLINE: APRIL 30, 1998
Latin American Studies Summer Faculty Research Grants win be
awarded to Stanford faculty members for travel to Latin America for research during the summer quarter.
Because the grants provide only modest support for travel and research (no salary offsets), applicants are
encouraged to seek supplementary funding from other sources.
DEADLINE: APRIL 20, 1998
U.S. Department of Education Language Across the Curriculum Grants
offer an incentive to Stanford faculty to incorporate Spanish or Portuguese into non-language-specific
courses. Two awards will be presented to faculty members for $7,(MX) each. These grants are designed to
enhance course development by providing funding for research assistants, teaching assistants, materials and
supplies or other means to further the incorporation of these languages into the broader curriculum.
DEADLINE: MAY 15, 1998
Applications should include a 1-2 page proposal outlining the project and a budget.
Application information is available from the CLAS home page at:
