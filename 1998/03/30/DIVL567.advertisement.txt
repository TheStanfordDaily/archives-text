The Photo Department is indebted to the following people for their help during
March Madness:
Sam would like to thank Peter Koeleman from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.
Garth would like to thank Scott Dine from the St. Louis-Dispatch, Ricard Mackson from Kodak, and
Richard Wisdom from San lose Mercury News.
Many thanks from Sasha to Ayanna Wakefield and everyone at Auburn; Richard Patton at the Heritage
House; Chad Barwick, Robert Smith, Trisha O'Brien, Keeley Streetman, Kim Rape and everyone at the
Auburn Plainsman; and especially Tod Van Ernst at the Opelika-Auburn News and Cliff Williams, without
whom none of this would have been possible. Most people have heard of Southern hospitality, but these
folks completely redefine the concept.
