# Murderess to be executed
## 
### 
STARKE. Fla. (AI *) — Judy Buenoano
filled 13 years on death row writing letters and
crocheting blankets and baby clothes. As the
clock ticks down to her execution today. she
waits in a cell a few feet from the electric chair.
She seems a paradox: either a doting moth
er or a ruthless "black widow" who drowned
her 19-year-old paraplegic son. poisoned her
husband with arsenic and tried to kill her
fiance first with pills, then a car bomb. She
might even have been the cause of her son's
paralysis, and is suspected in yet another poi
soning death.
If her execution is carried out on w hat
would have been her son's 37th birthday
Buenoano. 54. will be the first woman execut
ed in Florida since IN4N. when a freed slave
was hanged for killing her mastet
The Florida Supreme Court last week dis
missed Buenoano's appeal.
Pensacola prosecutor Russell I dgar. who
gave Buenoano the name that has dogged her
to this day, described her as ;i scheming, cold
blooded killer.
"She's like a black widow she feeds oft
her mates and her young," I dgar s.iid l.ist
week, repeating comments he made at her
trial for her son's 1980 drowning.
She collected about $240,000 in insurance
money from the deaths of her husband, son
and a boyfriend in Colorado.
"It docs appear the motive was twisted
greed." 1 dgar said.
Buenoano's husband of nine years. Air
Force Sgt James Goodyear, w;is 37 when he
died of arsenic poisoning in 1971 I hat was just
three months after he returned from a year's
tour in Vietnam.
Her partially paralyzed son. Michael
(ioodyear, 19. w.is wearing leg and arm braces
when his mother pushed him out of a canoe in
the Fast River near Pensacola in 19X0
But suspicions weren't aroused until after a

1983 car bombing in downtown Pensacola.
Her fiance. John Gentry, survived the bomb
ing and told detectives she had given him
"vitamins'" that made him sick
She w.is sentenced to 12 years for the
bombing, and Gentry's tale started investiga
tors on the path that led to discovers of her
other crimes.
In 1984. Buenoano was convicted of killing
her son and sentenced to life. And the next
year, she was convicted of killing her husband
and condemned to death.
On top ot those convictions, she w.is sus
pected but never charged in the 197S arsenic
death of Bobby Joe Morris, .i boyfriend in
Trinidad. ( 010.
She continues to deny an\ role in the
deaths ol Morris and her husband And in
television interviews in the past week.
Buenoano said her son's death was a terrible
accident, not murder.
"I suffered oxer it and I feel responsible lor
Ins death. It w.is an accident." she told
NBC.
\uthorities also believe she w.is responsi
ble for more than Michael s drowning His
crippling illness had developed after he
returned home Irom the Army, and an autop
s\ eventually lound traces of arsenic
But Buenoano's daughter. Kimberly
Hawkins. 30. a waitress m Naxarre. steadfastly
believes in her innocence.
"She did things with lis. she has told I tie
AsMviated Press. "She worked a lot ... but
she always made time for us."
Only two women have been executed in
the I nited States since the I S. Supreme
( ourt lifted its ban on capital punishment in
1976. North Carolina executed Velma
Barficld in NB4 tor poisoning her boyfriend:
