Students should
provide input in
dean selection

IN SPITE OF a persistent student
campaign in her favor. Asst. His
tory Prof. Karen Sawislak will not
get tenure at Stanford.
Understandably, the final rejection
of Sawislak s appeal leaves students
frustrated and uncertain about
whether their opinion matters. How
ever, in at least one important deci
sion — the selection of the new Dean
of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences — it does.
Nominations for the new Dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences will continue to be accepted
through the rest of this week.
The controversy over Sawislak's
tenure (as well as that of Asst.
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta,
whose tenure appeal was ultimately
granted) originated in the current
Dean of the School Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven's office. In both
cases, Shoven's decision overruled the
overwhelming support of the candi
date's department.
Once department approval of a
scholar's tenure status is secured, it
must be cleared by the dean, the
provost and the University president.
Student representatives never
directly participate in tenure deci
sions, although course evaluations and

solicited letters from students may be
considered. Fortunately, students have
more direct participation in selecting a
new dean. Students should share their
suggestions with Former ASSU Presi
dent Bill Shen, the student represen
tative on the search committee.
All those with a stake in the
humanities and sciences — in its
teaching, research, funding and other
curricular issues — should give their
input.
We have come to acknowledge the
considerable administrative powers of
the dean over the past several years.
As the recent report issued by the
Women's Coalition for Gender Equity
at Stanford highlighted, the dean is
key in determining whether or not an
individual will get tenure. Therefore,
selecting a fair and able candidate is
not a trivial decision.
Those frustrated and disappointed
by recent tenure controversies should
insist that the candidate is committed
to having a faculty representing
diverse backgrounds and possessing
cutting-edge research interests.
This is an opportunity to effect
change at the level often cited as the
root of many tenure ills.
Another point to consider: should
the dean come from within the Uni
versity or from the outside? Some are
concerned that someone tenured here
is already too institutionalized.
There are an infinite number of
issues at stake here — take this oppor
tunity to address them.
