## Inspiration from off the Farm 
### 
THIS JUNE, my par
ents will visit me at
Stanford for the
first time. They are coming
for graduation and have
heen anticipating their trip
for months. I am excited
for them to see the campus,
to meet the friends and

professors who I am close to, and to see the
little room where 1 live. I was also looking for
ward to a distinctive Commencement cere
mony and was hoping to hear a speaker with
a unique message.
That's why I was a touch disappointed
when I found out that Ted Koppel would
give the Commencement address. Not
because Koppel isn't worthy of speaking at
Stanford — in fact, he is an intelligent and sin
cere person. I had hoped, however, that the
senior class presidents and University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper would ch<x)se a speak
er whom 1 would not otherwise hear.
1 disagree with the unwritten policy that
the Commencement speaker must have a
strong connection to Stanford — usually a
former student or faculty member. This nar
row criterion severely limits the range of pos
sibilities.
It also favors people of a certain back
ground. Former students or faculty who are
distinguished enough to speak here are likely
to be older, white American men. because
those are primarily the types of people who

have been associated with this university until
the last few decades.
People with such connections to Stanford
usually come from privileged socioeconomic
classes. My concern is not that speakers cho
sen under this policy have a certain physical
appearance.
More importantly, at an elite institution
where so many students are pre-professional,
and seniors are vying for high-paying consult
ing and international banking jobs, it would
be useful to have a speaker who can bring a
viewpoint from outside the university. This
could broaden the restricted notions many of
us have about success, fulfillment and our
role in society post-Stanford.
For example, Guatemalan activist Rigob
erta Menchu did not attend Stanford, but she
could teach us about fighting injustice as an
indigenous woman in a military dictatorship.
Her experience could provide important
lessons in courage and resilience that we
might not learn at Stanford.
Koppel spoke at Commencement in 1986
and was on campus in 1992. Last year's
speaker. Supreme Court Justice Stephen
Breyer, is on campus almost every year. We
are lucky to have distinguished alumni visit
the Farm because of their strong connections
to the University. Why bring them back for
Commencement?
The fact that Koppel spoke at graduation
12 years ago should have precluded him from
being chosen again. Our university should

strive to bring in new people every year. Why
not use this as an opportunity to bring a
speaker who would not otherwise have a
chance to come to Stanford, and who most
students have not had the opportunity to see?
This is an occasion for Stanford to create rela
tionships with important figures in the Unit
ed States and beyond.
Another concern I have relates to speaker
selection. While the administration officially
asked for input from the senior class through
the senior class presidents. I wonder if this
was merely a gesture. I have yet to speak to
someone who nominated Koppel.
While Koppel is a sensible man with mod
erate viewpoints. I would like to hear some
one inspirational, entertaining or challenging
on my last day at Stanford. I might even pre
fer someone whom I fundamentally disagree
with, as long as he or she has something intel
ligent and substantive to say.
In future years, 1 hope that the policy of
having a speaker with a Stanford connection
is eased, and students have a more significant
role in the selection process. Mv picks for
next year's speaker include Toni Morrison.
Jerry Seinfeld, Kofi Annan, P.J. O'Rourke
and Hillary Rodham Clinton. In the mean
time, I will graciously welcome Ted Koppel
to campus in June. And maybe ... he'll sur
prise me.
