# Rice denies Sawislak appeal
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice has
declined to grant Asst. History Prof.
Karen Sawislak tenure.
In a letter dated March IK. Rice
said she would not reverse a deci
sion made last spring b\ the deans of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences to deny Sawislak tenure al
though the History Department had
voted nearly unanimously, with one
abstention, to approve her tenure.
Sawislak. an American labor his
torian. then appealed the decision to
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven. He rejected the re
quest. and Sawislak appealed again
to Rice, who appointed a grievance
officer in January to examine the
case.
Working with the report b\ the
grievance officer a member of the
Stanford faculty — Rice decided
there were no grounds to reverse
Shoven's decision. Regulations re
quire a reversal to be based on a pro
cedural error rather than an error of
judgment.
A "deeply disappointed" Sawis
lak said yesterday she would appeal
the decision to the Advisory Board
of the Academic C ouncil, the high
est level at which an appeal may he
made although Rice's decision
"has severely undermined my hopes
that the grievance process can lead
to a fair or just result "
According to Sawislak, Rice
"concluded that Dean Shoven's de
cision was a close and difficult |udg

ment call arrived at by applying the
most negative possible reading to
my tenure file — and that this is ap
propriate and reasonable under the
parameters of Stanford's process."
Rice could not be reached for
comment.
Sawislak added that the griev
ance officer found that the History
Department and the dean's office
disagreed on criteria for tenure
Rice decided the difference of opin
ion did not constitute a procedural
irregularity although the dean's
standards contradicted guidance
provided by senior faculty during
(he past six years, Sawislak said.
; The case, along with last year's
Controversy over Shoven's denial of
tenure to then-Asst. Anthropology
Prof. Akhil Gupta, has opened a di
alogue about Stanford's commit
ment to a diverse faculty. Alter a
lengthy appeals process. Rice grant
ed Gupta tenure.
The grievance officer found that
Sawislak's case "pointed to a lack of
fclarity in the University's policies

concerning affirmative action,"
Sawislak said.
Rice determined that Shoven
was "not under any obligation to
apply affirmative action concerns"
to a case, Sawislak said, raising
"grave doubts about the Universi
ty's professed commitment to facul
ty diversity."
Students involved in the Coali
tion to Tenure Karen Sawislak were
disappointed both by the decision it
self and Rice's timing — March IK
fell in the middle of final examina
tions, and students only received
word during spring break.
"I was not completely surprised
by the decision," said history doctor
al student Chuck Carlson. "It's very
difficult to get these things reversed
on appeal because the administra

tion can hide behind a veil of a faux
legality and technicality at this point.
They can avoid issues of merit and
justice by simply claiming that even
though it may have been a bad deci
sion, it was arrived at within the
rules and in broad parameters of
what might be considered reason
able."
Such a decision sends a message
to students and faculty that Stanford
"does not value teaching or student
input and that hiring and retaining
innovative scholars and women and
people of color is not a priority of
this University," said junior Cathy
Rion.
The coalition will meet next
week to discuss possible courses of
action to protest the University's de
cision.
