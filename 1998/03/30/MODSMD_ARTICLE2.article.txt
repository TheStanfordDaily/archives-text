# Rice denies Sawislak appeal
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice has
declined to grant Asst. History Prof.
Karen Sawislak tenure.
In a letter dated March IK. Rice
said she would not reverse a deci
sion made last spring b\ the deans of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences to deny Sawislak tenure al
though the History Department had
voted nearly unanimously, with one
abstention, to approve her tenure.
Sawislak. an American labor his
torian. then appealed the decision to
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven. He rejected the re
quest. and Sawislak appealed again
to Rice, who appointed a grievance
officer in January to examine the
case.
Working with the report b\ the
grievance officer a member of the
Stanford faculty — Rice decided
there were no grounds to reverse
Shoven's decision. Regulations re
quire a reversal to be based on a pro
cedural error rather than an error of
judgment.
A "deeply disappointed" Sawis
lak said yesterday she would appeal
the decision to the Advisory Board
of the Academic C ouncil, the high
est level at which an appeal may he
made although Rice's decision
"has severely undermined my hopes
that the grievance process can lead
to a fair or just result "
According to Sawislak, Rice
"concluded that Dean Shoven's de
cision was a close and difficult |udg

ment call arrived at by applying the
most negative possible reading to
my tenure file — and that this is ap
propriate and reasonable under the
parameters of Stanford's process."
Rice could not be reached for
comment.
Sawislak added that the griev
ance officer found that the History
Department and the dean's office
disagreed on criteria for tenure
