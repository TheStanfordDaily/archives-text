Fifth-years have in
valuable RA experience
I am writing to express my dismay at
the decision to prohibit fifth-year students
from becoming RAs. Though I understand
that Residential Education faces chal
lenges in housing its undergraduates, this
new policy is the wrong way to go.
As a former fifth-year RA, I agree with
The Daily that fifth-years offer a different
set of experiences than our junior- and
senior-year colleagues. By the time I set
foot in Okada. I had served in the ASSU
Senate, worked for The Daily, worked at
two high-tech start-up companies, spent
two summers in China, and interned at the
White House.
f was looking for a way to "give back"
to the Stanford community, and working
as an RA was the perfect fit. My experi
ence provided a good resource for my res
idents and augmented my contributions to
the residence staff.
Besides, I had previously taken one
quarter off from Stanford for my White
House internship, so I was technically a
fourth-year senior during the first quarter
of my fifth year. Additionally, I was living
in a housed fraternity, so I had voluntarily

given up my guaranteed years. Was I real
ly a "fifth-year"? Did I have any guaran
teed years left? Perhaps Res Ed can sort
out those types of issues in the fall.
I had a terrific year as an RA. Had I
been barred from applying — for whatev
er reason — my Stanford experience
would have been hurt considerably. My
post-Stanford life would have suffered
even more — I met my wife (then a Bran
ner RA) during RA training.
I sincerely hope that Res Ed reconsid
ers this poor decision.

VanDerveer shouldn't
publicly criticize team
I was shocked and dismayed to see
Tara VanDerveer castigate her players
publicly in Ann Killion's column in the
San Jose Mercury News on March 16.
Surely her comments would have served
their purpose if delivered privately. Stan
ford's coaches have traditionally followed
a higher road than the intimidating tactics
she borrowed from Bobby Knight.
VanDerveer has certainly been willing
to take credit for her team's successes in

the past. Now she must accept some of the
blame for not properly developing her
team. The inadequacies of her motionless
offense are woefully apparent now that
those players with rare instincts for the
game have graduated or suffered injury.

Disabled access needed
As disabled students, we have long
been concerned with the lack of accessible
housing for students with disabilities on
campus. In particular, we have been both
ered by the glaring lack of vertical accessi
bility (elevators allowing disabled students
to reach all floors). There are currently
elevators in Synergy and Mirrielees, which
are distinctive upper-class options, and
Florence Moore Hall.
However, because of safety concerns
about traveling to and from Flo Mo or
across Mayfield. disabled students are not
usually placed in those residences. There
fore, there are no housing options with
vertical accessibility available for fresh
men with disabilities.
Vertical accessibility is essential to
enabling students to participate fully in the
dorm commumtv. All students need to be

able to visit friends and hang out with stu
dents on all floors. These interactions are
especially critical for freshmen, who
potentially make lifelong friends in their
dorms.
Being confined to the first floor con
tributes to social isolation for students
with disabilities. The lack of vertical acces
sibility in Stanford housing also prevents
some students with disabilities from visit
ing their RAs and other dorm staff and
from reaching study partners and study
groups.
We understand that plans to install ele
vators in dorms are several years away.
However, Kimball will be gaining an ele
vator within the next few months thanks to
a private donation. Disabled freshmen,
especially quadriplegics, are often placed
in Kimball due to its accessibility. Con
verting Kimball to an upperclass dorm
removes this possibility.
We are also concerned about the deci
sion to make Toyon an all-sophomore
dorm. This change will make Toyon a
unique housing option. Each option, by
law and by Stanford guidelines, should be
available to students with disabilities.
Relying on lifts to reach student rooms is
unacceptable because of the safety risks
involved.
The required minimum of two escape

routes necessitates careful examination
and structural adaptations before Toyon
can he regarded as accessible. Until it is
made more accessible, making it an all
sophomore dorm creates another housing
option completely unavailable to students
with disabilities.
People with disabilities have the right
to participate fully in dorm life and take
advantage of all of Stanford's unique
housing options. We ask that the Universi
ty respect these rights by reconsidering the
decision to make Kimball upperclass and
Toyon all-sophomore, or by waiting to
implement those changes until more
dorms are accessible for students with dis
abilities. We also urge the University to
further examine the accessibility, includ
ing vertical accessibility, in Stanford hous
ing.
