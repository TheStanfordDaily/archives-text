FOR STANFORD'S MEN Sand
women's basketball teams it has been
a season of excitement and disap
pointment. The women rode a roller-coast
er season from a preseason No. 5 ranking to
the brink of falling out of the top 25. They
had a Kristin Folkl-aided revival for a No. I
seed in the NCAA tournament, only to fin
ish the year with an injury-induced fall to
No. 16 I larvard in the first round. The men
hovered in the top 15 all year and caught the
wave of March Madness all the way to the
Final Four for a heartbreaking overtime
loss to Kentucky.
It marked the first time that the men's
team had outperformed the women's team
in NCAA tournament play, signaling that
men's basketball at Stanford had finally
arrived. For the past few years, these teams
have had no problem filling the 7.(XH)-plus

seats in Maples Pavilion. The Fast Break
Club and the Sixth Man Club have turned
out in droves to support Cardinal basket
ball.
Hut rather than rehashing the events of
Stanford basketball's whirlwind year, the
Cardinal should turn its sights to next sea
son. As the fire of March Madness dies
down, the Stanford Athletics Department
should focus its basketball efforts on a Mid
night Madness program to kick off the 1998
99 season. California had one (before Har
mon (iym became a non-entity). Duke has
one (televised on ESPN no less). Stanford
should have one.
Midnight Madness, or whatever clever
name Athletic Director Ted Leland comes
up with, is a celebration held after midnight
on the first day that the NCAA allows Divi
sion I basketball teams to practice. Basical

ly, it's a preseason pep rally.
So what goes on? I he teams introduce
their players and play some type of low
impact scrimmage, and the fans play games
and get free gifts (ienerally, yelling, cheer
ing and screaming take place.
At UC Berkeley tv\o years ago. free
posters, shirts. Power Bars and CDs were
passed out to fans all for a measly $3
entrance fee. Wild 107.7 FM (now 94.9)
deejays played host and supervised audi
ence participation games. Both the men's
and women's teams were showcased, and
Randy Duck showed off his dunking skills.
Harmon Gym was packed.
I hat was I odd Bozeman's last year and
sixth-year senior Alfred (irigsbv's final hur
rah.
Let's do the math here: Stanford actually
has successful men's and women's pro

grams. Stanford is returning all fixe starters
from its IW7-98 men's I inal lour team.

Stanford should have had .i Midnight
Madness last year when both Brevin Knight
and Kate Starbird were here, but better late
than never. An assistant athletic diiector
confirmed last year that the idea had been
tossed around but rejected due to the
apprehensions of Montgomery and \ n
Derveer. II the fear is not being able to till
