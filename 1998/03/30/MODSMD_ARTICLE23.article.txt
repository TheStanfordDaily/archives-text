# Poets share their works
## 
### Art Diaz 
. It is commonly believed that poetry is meant to he
read aloud and shared. However, many poets and other
writers of creative forms have a hard time finding av
enues in which to share their works,
i So when senior Jenn Kao received an e-mail asking
for creative writers to give a reading at the Bookstore,
she quickly took advantage of the situation.
; "It's my senior year," said Kao, an English major. "I
had wanted to share my work with my friends, and I saw
this as my last chance to do this sort of thing."
The event titled "Undergraduate Student Reading at
the Bookstore" was one of a series of readings spon
sored by the Bookstore in conjunction with the English
Department. The purpose of the quarterly readings is to
provide a forum for undergraduate writers to express
their ideas and share their work.
Kao read from her series of poems that focus on films.
Her decision to write 011 films began when a line from
the novel "Portrait of a Lady" by Henry James struck
her. The line which reads, "I felt like a character in a
novel," seemed outdated to her because of the drastic
developments in popular media.
"Now people would say, 'I felt like a character in a
movie." 1 think movies have definitely changed the way
people think and the way people write," Kao explained.
Nvsa Lane, also a senior English major, read from her
collection of poetry, with titles such as "Sadness," "Cho-

rus of the Frogs" and "Market Days." Poetry, according
to Lane, is an essential part of her life, as it puts many of
her personal experiences into words.
"Poetry is an offshoot of your life experiences. You
live your life, and poems come out of that," Lane said.
Senior Nathan Jones, a feminist studies major, had never
read his work before and felt that the reading gave him
a chance to express his ideas.
"Most of my time is spent thinking and expressing,
and I really enjoy words. Not even journals per se,"
Jones said.
This reading series has continued for several years
now, and is currently coordinated by senior David Ball.
According to him, the reading program is open to any
student, regardless of major.
As for a future in writing, many of these students do
not envision themselves in careers as writers. Kao is
looking to take a year off before attending film school
while Jones has recently taken an interest in plants and
may search for a job at a nursery or garden. If that is suf
ficient enough to support him, Jones would like to be
able to play his trombone and eventually become a
writer.
Sophomore Oceana Blueskyes, who also writes poet
ry, doesn't see writing as a career option but does see it
as an integral part of her life.
"It's not realistic to think that I will make a living out
of writing," she said. "But I always have written, and I'm
going to be writing for the rest of my life."
