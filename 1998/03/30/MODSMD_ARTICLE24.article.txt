### Jaime Adame Contributing writer 
Volunteers in Asia, an organization that
has provided numerous Stanford students
with educational and eross-cultural exchange
opportunities, celebrated its 35th anniversary
on Saturday. About 250 past participants in
the program gathered on campus for an after
noon of reunion, remembrance and discus
sion about the future of Asia.
C urrently, the organization sends about 50
volunteers every year, usually college stu
dents or recent college graduates from the
Hay Area, to teach English in Vietnam. In
donesia. Laos and C 'hina. Undergraduate vol
unteers teach either at a university or middle
sch(X)l for about seven weeks during the sum
mer, while one- or two-year teaching posts are
available to college graduates.
"We're hoping to bring people closer to
gether by helping them communicate," said
Cliff Chan, executive director of the organiza
tion. "A number of Asian countries use Eng
lish to communicate with each other."
John Shoch. who earned a Ph.D. in Com
puter Science from Stanford in 1979, went to
Hong Kong with the program in 1968.
"The hallmark of VIA is its two-way ben
efit," Shoch said, adding that the cross-cultur

al exposure was a tremendous learning expe
rience for him personally.
"The teaching experience was wonder
ful," said senior Darlene Damm, who went to
Vietnam two years ago. "There were a lot of
stereotypes, and I felt I broke through that."
Volunteers usually live in dormitories or
with host families. Sylvia Martinez. ( lass of
'85, spoke of her experience living with a host
family in Taiwan.
"1 think most people would say you learn
from host families," Martinez said. "You talk
about everything. It's a rich environment."
The program began in the summer of 1963
when Dwight Clark, then Wilbur Hall's dean
of freshman men. answered a call for volun
teers and led 23 students to Hong Kong. Since
that time, the program has sent over 1.200 vol
unteers to 14 different countries.
"Our first group could only lcx)k across the
border into ('hina." C 'han said. "Now we have
a program in China."
A panel discussion, led by UC-Santa
Cruz Anthropology Prof. Nancy Chen, ad
dressed current trends in politics and family
life in China. Problems in Indonesia were
addressed by Suraya Afiff, a member of the
Indonesian Environmental Forum. Indone
sia is presently plagued by forest fires and
economic troubles, with inflation at about

25 percent and an unemployment rate esti
mated at 35 percent.
The discussion was followed by Indone
sian music, a reception and dinner.
"I think we've found a basic format that
works well," said Clark, now president of the
organization. "We're small, private, with no
government or religious ties. We're no threat
and have a degree of trust in Asia that has
been essential to us."
I"he organization is the only American vol
unteer group in Laos and was able to return to
Vietnam in IWO, five years before the nor
malization of relations between the United
States and Vietnam.
I"he group also offers students from Asia
the opportunity to come to the Stanford cam
pus for a cross-cultural study experience as a
part of the Trans-Pacific Exchange program.
Stanford students may sign on as hosts for the
visiting students.
Those interested in more information
about these programs may contact Volun
teers in Asia at their office on the third floor
of the Haas Center or call 3-3228.
"People have the impression that you
need to be Asian or an Asian studies major [to
go)." Chan said, "but VIA really specializes in
getting people who have little background,
training them and offering support."
