Robert (iregg. the dean of reli
gious life at Stanford for 11 years, is
slipping down Dec. 31 to pursue a
lull lime I niversity research and
teaching position as a professor of re
ligious studies. Hie process to find
his replacement will begin later this
year.
In the course of my years as I Ini
\cisii\ chaplain. I have developed
stmng attachments to Stanford and
its people," Gregg said. "The
piospeet ol continuing to live and
work here is a very happv one
belli for me and for Mary Layne. my
spouse."
One of the main reasons for
Giegg stepping down from his role
as Stanford's chaplain is his interest
in research.
\s a member of the facultv at

Duke University before coming to
Stanford. Gregg specialized in the
history of early Christianity.
He plans to undertake several re
search projects after he steps down,
including a comparative study of sa
cred stories shared by Jews. Chris
tians and Muslims and how these sto
ries are integrated and applied in
each religion.
Gregg said that he will miss lus
job. particular!) working with Ins col
leagues and interacting with stu
dents. ()ne of Ins major roles as dean
is to support and oversee all religious
groups on campus.
He raises ethical and spiritual is
sues that he feels students and facul
ty ought to engage in. Gregg is also
responsible for all activities at
Memorial Church. He holds meet
ings with committees and groups of
students and ent>at>cs in relinious

counseling.
Students and (acuity have had
positive things to say about C ircgg.
"He has been an extraordinary
gift to the University, and I'm de
lighted that he will continue to be
doing good work at Stanford in an
other capacity." said colleague Patri
cia Karlin-Neumann.
Assoc. 1 )ean of Memorial ('hurch
Kelly Denton-Borhaug said, "We
are delighted to have him receive this
great honor. I'his chair has been cre
ated for him in the Department of
Religious Studies, and no one is
more deserving.
"We are delighted that he will re
main on Stanford campus even while
we will greatly miss him in the office
for religious life."
"Bob (iregg has invigorated the
Stanford community in so many
wavs as dean of Memorial ('hurch

and professor of religious studies and
classics," said Beverley Foulks, a se
nior minoring in religious studies.
"As a member of Memorial Church.
1 will miss his presence in University
public worship.
"As his student. I appreciate his
decision to devote himself to teach
ing. I le will make an excellent full
time professor because of his phe
nomenal way of engaging students,
his sense of humor and his tenacious
investigation of religious texts."
The replacement process for
(iregg's position is still in the early
stages. A search committee will be
formed sometime this year to
process the applications.
No decision has yet been made re
garding a replacement. I'o give an
idea of the number of applicants,
over 2(H) people applied when (iregg
originally sought the position.
