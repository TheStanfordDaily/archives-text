# Meeting held on diversity of faculty
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
The author of a 1993 report on
the status of women faculty at
Stanford called for departmental
' hiring plans" to help diversify the
University's faculty at a meeting
in March.
Speaking at the annual meet
ing of the Stanford chapter of the
American Association of I niver
sity Professors on March 12. Edu
cation Prof. Myra Strober suggest
ed re-opening discussion of
whether a more formal mecha
nism was needed to move Stan
ford from its seat in the trenches,
relative to other Ivy League and
Pacific 10 Conference schools,
with regard to its percentage of
tenured faculty who are female.
Strober chaired the 1993
Provost's Committee on the Re
cruitment and Retention of Women
Faculty. The report called for,
among other things, hiring plans
that would help guide departments
in hiring and tenure decisions. Hir
ing plans are not quotas, Strober
emphasized, as departments would
not be penalized for failing to meet
the plans. Rather, a review of the
plans after a few years would let the
department know if it was making
the progress it hoped.
The committee's report included
a recommendation for hiring plans,
but Provost Condoleezza Rice
who had served on the committee
prior to her appointment as provost
— decided against implementing
the suggestion. Strober said, be
cause she felt it would be damaging
for professors to feel they were hired
only because of their race or gender.
Hut Stanford's slow progress in
diversifying its faculty during the
past five years has shown that such
measures may be necessary. Strober
said, adding that the future doesn't
look much brighter. "I think we're
going to make a lot of hires in the
next few years that don't help us in
crease gender and racial equity." she
said.
Other speakers at the meeting

had mixed views about hiring plans,
but all agreed that quotas were out
of the question. Many of the 15 pro
fessors in attendance — most of
whom had been or are currently in
volved in tenure disputes with the
University — suggested changes to
both the tenure and grievance
processes, bringing up ideas that
ranged Ironi specific lists of criteria
to allowing departments to appeal a
decision overturned on a higher
level
Tenure decisions must be ap
proved by the candidate's depart
ment. the school's deans, an adviso
ry committee and the provost.
History Prof. James Sheehan,
chair of the Academic Council's Ad
visory Hoard the group that ex
amines tenure appeals at the
provost's level said he was "very
skeptical of our ability to define
guidelines."
The task at hand in clarifying and
legitimizing the tenure process is not
easy, added Sheehan, who encour
aged faculty to continue the dia
logue and look for solutions.
"We're trying to work our way
out of what everyone believes was a
century-long process of not giving
women and minorities a fair shake,"
he said. "It's going to take us a while
to get out of it. Hut I think the dam
age to be done by rules or quotas or
laws is substantial."
Assoc. Religious Studies Prof.

Hester Gelber agreed that changes
will be a long time coming, citing
"hidden systemic biases" that pre
vent a faster move to diversity.
Women and minorities often do
work in relatively new fields, mak
ing their contributions harder to
evaluate, professors noted. Sueh
was the case for two recent high-pro
file tenure cases at Stanford: Assoc.
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta
specializes in gender issues in South
Asia while Asst. History Prof.
Karen Sawislak studies U.S. labor
history. Gupta eventually was
awarded tenure after appealing to
the advisory board; Kice recently
denied Sawislak's appeal to her.
It is precisely because such re
search is innovative that the Univer
sity must work harder to diversify its
faculty. History Prof. Joel Beinin
said. "One of the things that hap
pens when you bring women and mi
norities onto the faculty is that a big
proportion of them do teaching and
research in areas that otherwise
have been neglected." he noted.
University of Virginia Lavs Prof.
Robert O'Neil. chair of the associa
tion's committee on academic free
dom and tenure, agreed.
"Great universities ought to be
more representative than we have
tended to be." he said. "A university
in which women are underrepre
sented does not tend to offer a com
plete academic experience."
