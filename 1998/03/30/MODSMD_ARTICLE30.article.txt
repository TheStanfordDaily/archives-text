# THE 						CARDINAL RULES!
## Sports An un-FOUR-gettable run... 
### Gil Lopez Staff writer 
SAN ANTONIO — If the Stanford
men's basketball team's run through the
NCAA tournament had to end, this was the
only fitting way.
It took 56 years for Stanford to make it
back to the Final Four, and it didn't let the
opportunity go to waste.
The Cardinal (30-5) controlled Ken-
I

tucky (34-4) for 30 minutes before falling to
the Wildcats K6-K5 in overtime in Satur
day's national semifinal game.
Stanford spent its spring break making
believers of its critics and doubters through
out the nation, and Saturday's game left no
question regarding its prowess as a national
power.
How impressive was the Cardinal?
When junior forward Peter Sauer's full
court heave at the buzzer sailed wide right

and the teams exchanged congratulations,
there was nothing hut applause raining
down from every direction in the Alamod
ome.
Hut the greatest reaction came from the
seating section containing all the coaches
that didn't make it to the weekend. From
there, head coaches Mike Montgomery and
Orlando "Tubby" Smith received a stand-

ing ovation from their peers for the
memorable performances their
teams had given that night.
The ovation was more than just a
display of appreciation for the game.
It was a symbol of acceptance for the
C ardinal program. It showed that the

nation was ready to accept Stanford
as one of the country's top programs.
"1 think this was a great college
basketball game, and certainly our
fans — who have to be disappointed
have to be absolutely thrilled by
the level of performance by our
kids," Montgomery said. "And if in
deed the eoaehes in the stands were
standing and applauding our effort,
that makes me feel very, very good."

There was cause for the Cardinal
to be a little sad, but by no means
were they disappointed.
"It definitely hurts," said point
guard Arthur Lee, who finished with
a team-high 26 points and five assists.
"Like I told the coach, when the
buzzer sounded, 1 couldn't believe we
lost. It was a great run. Every time, we
figure that no matter what the deficit
is, we will come back and get a victo
ry. We almost did it.
"It hurts, but our guys aren't real
ly down because we had a great run.
We almost made it to the national
championship game when very few
people thought we could get this far."
Those people were proven very
wrong.
Kentucky trailed the entire game
until a pair of free throws by forward
Scott Padgett gave the Wildcats a 54-
53 lead with 10 minutes, 4 seconds left
in regulation.
After seven lead changes the
Wildcats took a 73-70 lead on a free
throw by point guard Wayne Turner,
but Lee pulled out even more tourna
ment heroics.
The Cardinal point guard, who
has been the team's biggest clutch
performer, did it yet again, sinking a
three-pointer with 27 seconds re
maining in regulation to tie the score.
Sophomore power forward Mark
Madsen pulled down a missed layup
by Turner and called a timeout with
1.1 seconds left on the clock, but ju
nior guard Kris Weems missed a 30-
foot shot at the buzzer.
The Wildcats took the quick edge
in overtime, forcing a Cardinal
turnover after Madsen won the jump
ball to begin the extra period.
After Madsen and junior center
Tim Young fouled out for the Cardi
nal. Kentucky never trailed in the
extra period and took a four-point
lead with 15 seconds left on a free
throw by guard Jeff Sheppard.
But as they've done all tourna
ment, the Cardinal refused to go
down quietly. Sauer hit a 23-foot trey
with nine seconds left to put Stanford
right back in the game. Freshman Jar
ron Collins forced a jump ball with

Padgett on the ensuing inbounds, but
the possession arrow favored Ken
tucky.
The Cardinal then covered the
floor on the next inbounds, but the
pass sailed over the leaping Lee and
into Turner's hands. Lee was forced
to foul with 2.5 seconds left. Turner
missed both free throws, but Sauer
didn't have enough time to get off a
good shot.
Sheppard was named the game's
most valuable player for his game
high 27-point performance, which in
cluded three clutch treys.
The Cardinal's 30 wins is a new
school record, breaking the old mark
set by the 1942 NCAA championship
team.
But more importantly, the Cardi
nal's strong showing against perenni
al power Kentucky quieted all those
who thought Montgomery's squad
didn't belong among the nation's
elite.
"I don't think you saw any of the
desperate body language [after the
game) or anything like that because
we have had a great season," Madsen
said. "In a lot of people's minds, we
have overachieved. We have high ex
pectations for ourselves. We really
thought we were going to win today,
but we have had a great season.
"Everyone on the team — the
guys on the court, the guys on the
bench — these are very competitive
players and they have given it every
thing that they had. We are going to
take this thing and learn from it and
work as hard as we possibly can this
spring, this summer, next fall. And we
will be back."
The Wildcats move on to their
third straight championship game,
but the Cardinal left its mark on
Smith and his players.
Montgomery's "team is very com
petitive and very well-coached,"
Smith said. "They understand the
game very well. They have a never
die type attitude. With this experi
ence of being in the Final Four and in
the semifinal game here, I'm sure that
will go a long way as it has for Ken
tucky's players."
