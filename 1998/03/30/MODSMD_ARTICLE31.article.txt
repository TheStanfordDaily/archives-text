# Stanford falls to Kentucky in OT
## 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
SAN ANTONIO — High in the air. junior Arthur
Lee was plotting his latest game-winning strategy
(with six seconds remaining in overtime during Satur
day's Final Four matchup against Kentucky.
But when he returned to the Alamodome floor,
set to begin the execution, one thing was missing. He
didn't have the hall.
Stanford's defense had prevented Kentucky from
an easy inbounds play and forced the Wildcats to
throw the ball down the court, hoping for an open
man.
" The ball was in the air, and I knew I was going to
get it," Lee said. "I thought that was us right there."
Said sophomore forward Mark Madsen: "I really
felt that we were going to win the game — I thought
this was going to be just like the Rhode Island game."
But Wildcat point guard Wayne Turner jumped
up over Lee and came down with the ball.
"We wanted [TurnerJ to get the ball, but not on
that long pass." Lee said. "Man. he just went up and
got it. We got so close."
Although Turner missed both free throws after
being fouled by Lee. the Cardinal could not engineer
any miracles in the 2.5 remaining seconds, succumb
ing to Kentucky 86-K5.
Two times during the last 10 seconds of overtime.

(34) and Nazr Mohammed for a critical rebound in Saturday s Final
Four showdown.
the steal which could have sent
Stanford into tonight's national
championship game was just inches
away.
With 9.4 seconds left and Stan
ford looking to foul whomever got
the ball, freshman Jarron Collins
almost came up with the steal ot his
life, but he could not wrestle the
ball away from Kentucky forward
Scott Padgett.
The play was ruled a jump ball
and, because the Card won the open
ing overtime tip, the ball was award
ed to the Wildcats, setting up Lee's
steal-that-was-not-meant-to-be.
"1 was just trying to get the ball
out of his hands," Collins said. "I
was looking at the possession arrow
and saw it was going their way. It
was disappointing."
"You just had the sense that that
was it, we were going to win. - ' said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery.
"In both instances we just didn't
quite have it."
Throughout the NCAA tourna
ment and Stanford's entire season,
the Cardinal's never-say-die atti
tude kept the team in games and al
lowed different players to step up.
On Saturday it was the outside
shooting of junior Kris Weems,
who made two outstanding 7-foot
bank shots to prevent the Wildcats
from extending their lead and had a
shot at the game-winner in regula
tion.

To beat Kentucky, the Cardinal
had to play perfect basketball. It al
most did. The inside-out game,
which was dormant against Rhode
Island, returned as Stanford de
pended on Lee and Weems for key
baskets. Madsen and junior center
Tim Young scored just 19 points
combined.
Hut after the first half, Stanford
began turning the ball over more
frequently, leading to 21 Wildcat
points. Kentucky had just six
turnovers on the game, leading to
six Cardinal points.
People are going to be asking
the what-ifsfora longtime to come.
What if Lee had stolen the ball?
What if Padgett's dunk attempt
blocked out of bounds by Madsen
had been ruled a goaltend, giving
the Wildcats two points and not
three, which they got from Shep
pard? What if Turner had made
that second free throw, giving the
Cardinal a chance to set a play dur
ing the last 2.5 seconds?
But. although Lee said he'd be
second-guessing this one for a
while, that's probably not likely to
happen. Stanford played its best
game all season and, unlike its
game against Rhode Island, some
times the breaks just don't go your
way.
As was proved during the tour
nament, Montgomery's team is too
mature to let small mistakes cause a
stellar performance to be forgotten.
"I was just so proud of'the kids,"
Montgomery said. "Their effort
was just fantastic."
