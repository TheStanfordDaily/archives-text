SAN ANTONIO — High in the air. junior Arthur
Lee was plotting his latest game-winning strategy
(with six seconds remaining in overtime during Satur
day's Final Four matchup against Kentucky.
But when he returned to the Alamodome floor,
set to begin the execution, one thing was missing. He
didn't have the hall.
Stanford's defense had prevented Kentucky from
an easy inbounds play and forced the Wildcats to
throw the ball down the court, hoping for an open
man.
" The ball was in the air, and I knew I was going to
get it," Lee said. "I thought that was us right there."
Said sophomore forward Mark Madsen: "I really
felt that we were going to win the game — I thought
this was going to be just like the Rhode Island game."
But Wildcat point guard Wayne Turner jumped
up over Lee and came down with the ball.
"We wanted [TurnerJ to get the ball, but not on
that long pass." Lee said. "Man. he just went up and
got it. We got so close."
Although Turner missed both free throws after
being fouled by Lee. the Cardinal could not engineer
any miracles in the 2.5 remaining seconds, succumb
ing to Kentucky 86-K5.
Two times during the last 10 seconds of overtime.
