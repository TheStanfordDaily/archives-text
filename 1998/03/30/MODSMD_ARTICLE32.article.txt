AUBURN, Ala. — Stanford
men's swimming is hack on top as na
tional champion.
In one of the best team efforts
ever, all lb men from Stanford who
made the meet scored at the N< AA
Championships. The Card finished
off the season in grand fashion with
at least one swimmer in the finals of
every swimming event en route to
599 points — the second-highest
total in history.
Most Auburn came in a distant
second with 394.5. and Texas tix>k
third with 3b2.5. I "ho reasons for

Stanford's success were apparent all
weekend.
"Every person was important,"
said senior Tom Wilkens. "You
don't win a team championship with
out anyone."
Outstanding leadership from the
seniors. They elevated the level of
their swimming for the meet, and
every senior swam personal best
times during the meet. Wilkens was
victorious every time he touched the
water, finishing the meet with indi
vidual titles and schtnil records in the
200-yard and 400-yard individual
medleys (1:45.1 band 3:43.%. respec
tively) and the 200 breaststroke
(1:55.02, tied school record). He was

also on Stanford's championship 400
medley relay. Senior Sabir Muham
mad swam in three finals and set a
school record in the 100 butterfly
(4b. IS), breaking assistant coach and
Olympian Pablo Morales' mark
(4b.2b, an American record).
Incredible swimming from the
freshmen. The freshmen came out
fired up and represented half of
Stanford's swims in finals on the first
day. Freshman Steven Brown swam
in three finals and finished runner-up
to teammates in the 400 IM and the
200 butterfly. Freshman Anthony
Robinson qualified for two big finals.
