### Andre Salles-Cunha Contributing writer 
AUBURN, Ala. — Stanford
men's swimming is hack on top as na
tional champion.
In one of the best team efforts
ever, all lb men from Stanford who
made the meet scored at the N< AA
Championships. The Card finished
off the season in grand fashion with
at least one swimmer in the finals of
every swimming event en route to
599 points — the second-highest
total in history.
Most Auburn came in a distant
second with 394.5. and Texas tix>k
third with 3b2.5. I "ho reasons for

Stanford's success were apparent all
weekend.
"Every person was important,"
said senior Tom Wilkens. "You
don't win a team championship with
out anyone."
Outstanding leadership from the
seniors. They elevated the level of
their swimming for the meet, and
every senior swam personal best
times during the meet. Wilkens was
victorious every time he touched the
water, finishing the meet with indi
vidual titles and schtnil records in the
200-yard and 400-yard individual
medleys (1:45.1 band 3:43.%. respec
tively) and the 200 breaststroke
(1:55.02, tied school record). He was

also on Stanford's championship 400
medley relay. Senior Sabir Muham
mad swam in three finals and set a
school record in the 100 butterfly
(4b. IS), breaking assistant coach and
Olympian Pablo Morales' mark
(4b.2b, an American record).
Incredible swimming from the
freshmen. The freshmen came out
fired up and represented half of
Stanford's swims in finals on the first
day. Freshman Steven Brown swam
in three finals and finished runner-up
to teammates in the 400 IM and the
200 butterfly. Freshman Anthony
Robinson qualified for two big finals.

day.
the 1(X) breast and the 50 freestyle.
He was also on the record-breaking
200 free relay. Freshman Adam
Messner was in the finals of the 200
free and scored in the 1,650 and 500
as well. Freshman Rob Canales
scored in both IMs while freshman
Jeremy Kane finished sixth in the
mile (15:06.72). Although the times
are impressive, the most important
contribution to the team was enthu
siasm, which allows a team to exceed
all expectations.
" The strengths of our team this
year have been senior leadership
and freshman enthusiasm," Wilkens
said. "The freshmen did a great job
of keeping us excited all year."
The juniors had a breakthrough
year. Five juniors traveled to nation
als. and all five had at least one swim
in finals (top eight). Juniors Matt
Pierce (2(H) butterfly) and Tate Blah
nik (200 backstroke) joined the long
list of Stanford greats who won an in
dividual NCAA title for the first
time in their junior year, while junior
Blake Holden was second only to
Wilkens in the 200 breast. Alumni on
the list include Olympians Kurt
Grote and Ray Carey and Stanford
greats Tyler Mayfield and Brian
Retterer. Wilkens is also on the list.
Records had to be smashed to keep
junior Dod Wales from joining the
list in the 1(H) fly — he was third to
NCAA record-holder Lars Frolan
der from Southern Methodist and
Stanford's Muhammad.
Sophomore Glenn Counts repre
sented his class well as he swam
faster than he ever has. He had to
out-touch his brother Chris Counts
from Arizona for ninth place in the
2(H) IM.
The coaches were practically per
fect. The taper was right on. and
there were almost no bad swims.
Head coach Skip Kenney had a
tough job to do picking people for
the relays because everybody was so
fast, and he made a winning call
every time. All the stroke groups
were on, and the World Champi
onship members and sprinters swam
extremely well. These are all signs of
great coaching.
Before the meet the defending
champion Tigers were projected to
be in the lead after the first day on
the strength of its 50 freestylers and a
solid IM group. They did well
putting six swimmers in the finals of
these two events. But Stanford did
better, putting four swimmers in the
big finals and six in consolation fi
nals.
The first event of the meet was
the 2(H) freestyle relay. Auburn ex
pected to win the relay, but Stanford
had other plans. Stanford won in
American- and NCAA-record time
(1:16.76) to Auburn's 1:17.19. Senior
Scott Claypool and Muhammad split
18.82 and 18.79. respectively.
"Auburn's strength is the sprint
events, and we wanted to neutralize
that," Claypool said. "I think we did
that tonight."
In fact, Stanford more than neu
tralized Auburn in the sprint events.
Stanford out-scored them in the 50

freestyle, and the 200 free relay
speaks for itself.
Stanford finished the day the
same way they started it — fast. Stan
ford's 4(K) medley relay of Blahnik,
Wilkens, Muhammad and Wales
swam away from the field en route to
a p(x)l record and the second-fastest
time ever. Every Stanford swimmer
had personal best times on the relay.
With jaw dropping swims time
after time, the Card remained un
stoppable. Stanford set school
records in four of the five relays dur
ing the meet.
Muhammad was the star relay
swimmer of the meet. He split 45.09
in the KM) fly and helped Stanford's
200 medley relay go faster than any
four Americans ever had with his
split of 19.74 in the 50 fly.
Wales and Claypool joined
Muhammad with awesome relay
swims on the freestyle legs.
"I haven't seen this kind of relay
swimming in years ... all those guys
are making decisions for the team,"
said assistant head coach Ted
Knapp. "You have to ask those guys
where those swims came from.
There is some kind of energy coming
from the team."
"I don't know why I'm sur
prised." Kenney said. "These guys
have been surprising me all year."
On the second morning of com
petition. Stanford all but put the
meet away. The swimmers qualified
for 10 big finals and three consola
tion finals. Stanford parents and
alumni sensed that victory was immi
nent. Few vocal chords were left un
scathed by the end of the weekend.
On the second day Wilkens
(3:43.96) and Brown (3:46.52) went
one-two in the 4(K) IM and Canales
finished 11th. Holden (sixth. 54.15)
and Robinson (eighth. 55.28) ended
Stanford's two-year absence from
the 100 breaststroke final.
Stanford owned the third day of
competition, winning four of the six
swimming events and going one-two
in the 2(X) fly and 2(X) breast.
Stanford scored all three swim
mers in the 1,650 to start off day
three. Messner swam a best time of
15:19.14 to get 15th from the morn
ing heats. Kane was Stanford's
fastest miler with a sixth-place
15:06.72. Junior Matt O'Mara went a
15:18.35 to get 14th. With this swim
O'Mara scored three points and en
sured that all 16 Stanford swimmers
at the meet scored.
"I just kept thinking 15 guys have
scored — one guy hasn't," O'Mara
said.
The 1 (X) fly was the fastest in his
tory with SMtJ senior Lars Frolan
der becoming the first flyer to break
46 seconds. He needed the milestone
to beat Muhammad, who took sec
ond with the third-fastest swim ever
and a school record (46.18). Wales
took third in 46.32.
Pierce (1:43.68) and Brown
(1:44.00) were Stanford's only two
swimmers in the 200 fly. and they
made the most of it, placing first and
second for Stanford's third one-two
finish of the meet and seventh title.
They swam the fastest final 50 yards
in the event to get to the wall ahead
of the competition.
Stanford had the NCAA champi

on in the 2(H) backstroke in Blahnik
(1:41.20). He too finished the race
with the fastest final 50 to beat last
year's champ. (JSC's Lenny Krazel

(fifth. 43.29) finaled in the 1(K) free.
Wales became the second Stanford
swimmer under 43 seconds in the 1(H)

breast from start to finish to tie
Grote's school record of 1:55.02.
Holden held off last year's champion
Jeremy Linn to get second with a
1:56.90. Wilkens completed his per
fect meet with this swim and joined
Morales and Olympic champion Jeff
Rouse as Stanford's three event win
ners.
"I can't believe I tied Grote,"
Wilkens said.
Stanford ended the meet in fitting
fashion with a team and pool record
of 1:51.37 while winning the 4(X) free
relay. Wales (42. I >2). Muhammad
(42.65). Counts (43.41) and Claypool
(42.39) combined to swim the sec
ond-fastest 400 yards ever.
Stanford accepted the award for
the NCAA champion to enthusiastic
cheers from its large group of fans
and alumni that had attended the
meet. After the awards the team cel
ebrated for almost an hour. It was

possibly the longest poolside cele
bration in NCAA history.
"1 really don't even know what to
say," Kenney said. "This has exceed
ed everything 1 expected from this
team."
When all was said and done the
scoreboard read Stanford 599.

as well. Freshman Rob Canales
scored in both IMs while freshman
Jeremy Kane finished sixth in the
mile (15:06.72). Although the times
are impressive, the most important
contribution to the team was enthu
siasm, which allows a team to exceed
all expectations.
" The strengths of our team this
year have been senior leadership
and freshman enthusiasm," Wilkens
said. "The freshmen did a great job
of keeping us excited all year."
The juniors had a breakthrough
year. Five juniors traveled to nation
als. and all five had at least one swim
in finals (top eight). Juniors Matt

that tonight."

freestyle, and the 200 free relay
speaks for itself.

same way they started it — fast. Stan

Wilkens, Muhammad and Wales
swam away from the field en route to
a p(x)l record and the second-fastest

200 medley relay go faster than any
four Americans ever had with his
split of 19.74 in the 50 fly.

Muhammad with awesome relay
swims on the freestyle legs.
"I haven't seen this kind of relay
swimming in years ... all those guys
are making decisions for the team,"
said assistant head coach Ted
Knapp. "You have to ask those guys
where those swims came from.
There is some kind of energy coming
from the team."

prised." Kenney said. "These guys
have been surprising me all year."
