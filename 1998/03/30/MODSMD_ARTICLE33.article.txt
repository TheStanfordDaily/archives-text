# Women win eighth crown
## 
### Mino Martinez Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's swim
ming team had to wait an entire
year for the chance to regain the na
tional title. Given the opportunity,
the Cardinal swam its way to su
premacy in collegiate swimming,
defeating second-place Arizona
422-378. Georgia (3bB). Southern
Methodist (339) and USC (277)
rounded out the top five.
All season the Stanford women
had to cope with the thought of the
trophy resting in the hands of I ! SC.
Another close second-place finish
would only make Stanford seem less
powerful and all the more vulnera
ble. The Cardinal needed nothing
less than the title, and it had no in
tention of letting the title slip away
once again. Led by sophomore
Catherine Fox and freshman Misty
Hvman the Stanford squad turned in
a convincing performance en route
to regaining its throne.
From the very beginning, an ex
tremely competitive meet was ex
pected.
"Over the next three days, you
vsill see some of the most keen com
petition and some of the most excit
ing swimming that has ever been at
the NCAA level." said Arizona
coach Frank Busch.
The swimmers did not disap
point
Ouring the meet almost every
event had the fastest field in history,
and by the end the record Kx>ks had
been rewritten.
Inking her name in the record
hxiks in five events was the NCAA
Swimmer of the Year. Hvman.

Swimming in her first NCAA cham
pionship she said. "My first thought
was that it would be a lot of tension."
The tension, however, did not
seem to bother her. In her first
event, the KM) fly, Hyman put on an
awesome show She won in a time ot
51.34 seconds, besting her nearest
opponent by more than 1.3 seconds,
and shattering the NCAA. I S.
Open and American records by
nearly four-tenths of a second.
Hyman added another record in
the 2<X) flv. Her winning time of
1:55.70 beat the second-place finish
er by two seconds, and established a
new pKxil record at the I University of
Minnesota. To put a finishing touch
on her individual events. Hyman set
yet another pool record in the 2(X)
backstroke. Her time of 1:53.12 was
just. 14 off the NCAA record. These
marvelous swims were part of the
reason that she was also named the
NCAA Swimmer of the Year.
Also partaking in the shattering
of records w as Fox She successfully

defended her title in the 100 back
with a time of 52.71, establishing
new NCAA. U.S. Open and Ameri
can records. Helping Fox overcome
any possible anxiety prior to her
races was her mindset going into the
meet.
"I am excited to get in the water
and race." Fox said. "It is a big party
and you just go and play."
Fox continued to play in the 50
free, where she was also able to de
fend her title from last year with a
time of 22.21. Defending both of her
titles required all the energy she
could muster.
"Whatever is in front of me at the
time. I attack that and go at it 1(X)
percent." Fox said. "It's been a pret
ty exhausting meet."
As a result she managed only a
sixth-place finish in the 100 free with
a time of Nevertheless, the big
party was very successful for Fox.

breaststroke events was junior Elin
Austevoll. Competing in the KM)
breast, Austevoll claimed sixth place
in a time of l:() l .41. Her time was just
one-hundredth of a second off her
lifetime best and was a pleasant re
ward for a very consistent season.
Austevoll's bigger reward, however,
was still to come. In the 2(H) breast
Austevoll touched in a time of
2:11.04. good for second place.
The Cardinal also got strong ef
forts from several other swimmers
who provided valuable points.
Freshman Siobhan Cropper sprint
ed her way to a seventh-place finish
in the 50 free with a time of 22.57.
I ler time of 54.46 also earned her a
lOth-place finish in the l(X) fly. In ad
dition to her individual swims. Crop
per would proved to be extremely
valuable in the relays.
Another freshman. Lauren
l'hies. also swam well. In the 4(H) IM
she won the consolation final in
4:14.65. In the S(H) free Thies swam
tii 12th place in a time of 4:46.36.
Joining Thies in the S(H) free was
senior Amy Oberhelman. She came
in 15th with a time of 4:48.79. Other
individual consolation finalists were
sophomores Jessica Amey and
Gabrielle Rose, junior Chantal
Rawn and senior Evi-Lvnn Byer.
Amey. competing in the 100 fly, fin
ished ninth in 54.24. She came awav
with a win in the consolation final
but fell far short of her third-place
performance from last year. Rose
won the consolation final in the 2(H)
IM with a time of 1:59.70. Both
Rawn and Byer competed in the 200
back. Rawn took 10th place with a
time of 1:58.71. while Byer finished
11th in 1:58.85.
In addition to these individual
swims, the relays also swam excep
tionally well. While the free relays
were dominated by Arizona, the
medley relays belonged to the Cardi
nal. In the 2(H) medley relay the Car

clinal team of Fox, Austevoll.
Hyman and Cropper finished in
1:37.50. beating both the old NCAA
record and Arizona by nearly eight
tenths. The Stanford quartet had an
even more dominant performance in
the 4(K) medley relay. A fantastic
swim by Georgia still left the Bull
dogs 1.8 seconds behind the Cardi
nal. With a time of 3:33.61, the Stan
ford team had crushed the old
NCAA mark by more than two sec
onds.
In the freestyle relays Arizona
reigned supreme. The Wildcats
came away with victories in each 112 ree

relay. The Cardinal, however, was
not far behind. In the 2(M) free relay
the Stanford team of Cropper, se
nior Lindsay Gassner, Hyman and

I think last year we were all a little scatterbrained, not quite focused as a unit. This year,
we re working together a lot more; we're much more excited. You can feel the support be
hind the team.'
— Catherine Fox

Fox came in fourth with a time of
1:30.29. The 4(H) free relay team of
Cropper, Rose, Gassner and Fox

placed second in 3:16.99. In the 8(X)
free relay the Cardinal slid down a
notch to third. The team of Rose,
Hyman. Thies and Austevoll fin

ished in 7:11.03. Such stellar relay
swims were more than enough to
propel the Cardinal toward victory.

While the Cardinal was powerful
in certain events, there were also fi
nals which saw no Stanford swim
mers.

"Each of us have a weakness,"
said Stanford head coach Richard
Quick.

The key weakness was distanee
swimming. The Cardinal did not
have a single competitor in the finals
of the 2(X), S(X) and 1,650 free events.
Meanwhile, Stanford's chief com
petitors were sending multiple swim
mers into each final. The other con
cerns for the Cardinal were the 1M
events. The 400 1M final had three
USC and two Georgia swimmers but
not a single member of the Stanford
squad. Likewise, the 2(X) IM was
peppered with Georgia and SMIJ
swimmers.
The divers were also able to lend
a helping hand in the competition.
Junior Carissa Zenorini placed
eighth in the 1-meter competition
while freshman Kim Powers finished
sixth in both the 3-meter and plat
form competitions.
My the end of the meet, the world
of women's swimming had returned
to normal. Last year's loss proved to
be a fluke, not a trend. It was a fluke
which this Stanford team would not
allow to happen again.
"I think last year we were all a lit
tle scatterbrained, not quite focused
as a unit." Fox said. "This year, we're
working together a lot more; we're
much more excited. You can feel the
support behind the team."
As a result this close-knit squad
produced Stanford's eighth national
championship in the illustrious his
tory of women's swimming.
All season the goal had been to
reestablish the dominance of Stan
ford women's swimming. As of now,
the mission is complete and the tro
phy has returned to a familiar home.

year for the chance to regain the na
tional title. Given the opportunity,
the Cardinal swam its way to su
premacy in collegiate swimming,
defeating second-place Arizona
422-378. Georgia (3bB). Southern
Methodist (339) and USC (277)
rounded out the top five.
All season the Stanford women
had to cope with the thought of the
trophy resting in the hands of I ! SC.
Another close second-place finish
would only make Stanford seem less
powerful and all the more vulnera
ble. The Cardinal needed nothing
less than the title, and it had no in
tention of letting the title slip away
once again. Led by sophomore
Catherine Fox and freshman Misty
Hvman the Stanford squad turned in
a convincing performance en route
to regaining its throne.
From the very beginning, an ex
tremely competitive meet was ex
pected.
"Over the next three days, you
vsill see some of the most keen com
petition and some of the most excit
ing swimming that has ever been at
the NCAA level." said Arizona
coach Frank Busch.
The swimmers did not disap
point
Ouring the meet almost every
event had the fastest field in history,
and by the end the record Kx>ks had
been rewritten.
Inking her name in the record
hxiks in five events was the NCAA
Swimmer of the Year. Hvman.

Swimming in her first NCAA cham
pionship she said. "My first thought
was that it would be a lot of tension."
The tension, however, did not
seem to bother her. In her first
event, the KM) fly, Hyman put on an
awesome show She won in a time ot
51.34 seconds, besting her nearest
opponent by more than 1.3 seconds,
and shattering the NCAA. I S.
Open and American records by
nearly four-tenths of a second.
Hyman added another record in
the 2<X) flv. Her winning time of
1:55.70 beat the second-place finish
er by two seconds, and established a
new pKxil record at the I University of
Minnesota. To put a finishing touch
on her individual events. Hyman set
yet another pool record in the 2(X)
backstroke. Her time of 1:53.12 was
just. 14 off the NCAA record. These
marvelous swims were part of the
reason that she was also named the
NCAA Swimmer of the Year.
Also partaking in the shattering
of records w as Fox She successfully

defended her title in the 100 back
with a time of 52.71, establishing
new NCAA. U.S. Open and Ameri
can records. Helping Fox overcome
any possible anxiety prior to her
races was her mindset going into the
meet.
"I am excited to get in the water
and race." Fox said. "It is a big party
and you just go and play."
Fox continued to play in the 50
free, where she was also able to de
fend her title from last year with a
time of 22.21. Defending both of her
titles required all the energy she
could muster.
"Whatever is in front of me at the
time. I attack that and go at it 1(X)
percent." Fox said. "It's been a pret
ty exhausting meet."
As a result she managed only a
sixth-place finish in the 100 free with
a time of Nevertheless, the big
party was very successful for Fox.

breaststroke events was junior Elin
Austevoll. Competing in the KM)
breast, Austevoll claimed sixth place
in a time of l:() l .41. Her time was just
one-hundredth of a second off her
lifetime best and was a pleasant re
ward for a very consistent season.
Austevoll's bigger reward, however,
was still to come. In the 2(H) breast
Austevoll touched in a time of
2:11.04. good for second place.
The Cardinal also got strong ef
forts from several other swimmers
who provided valuable points.
Freshman Siobhan Cropper sprint
ed her way to a seventh-place finish
in the 50 free with a time of 22.57.
I ler time of 54.46 also earned her a
lOth-place finish in the l(X) fly. In ad
dition to her individual swims. Crop
per would proved to be extremely
valuable in the relays.
Another freshman. Lauren
l'hies. also swam well. In the 4(H) IM
she won the consolation final in
4:14.65. In the S(H) free Thies swam
tii 12th place in a time of 4:46.36.
Joining Thies in the S(H) free was
senior Amy Oberhelman. She came
in 15th with a time of 4:48.79. Other
individual consolation finalists were
sophomores Jessica Amey and
Gabrielle Rose, junior Chantal
Rawn and senior Evi-Lvnn Byer.
Amey. competing in the 100 fly, fin
ished ninth in 54.24. She came awav
with a win in the consolation final
but fell far short of her third-place
performance from last year. Rose
won the consolation final in the 2(H)
IM with a time of 1:59.70. Both
Rawn and Byer competed in the 200
back. Rawn took 10th place with a
time of 1:58.71. while Byer finished
11th in 1:58.85.
In addition to these individual
swims, the relays also swam excep
tionally well. While the free relays
were dominated by Arizona, the
medley relays belonged to the Cardi
nal. In the 2(H) medley relay the Car

clinal team of Fox, Austevoll.
Hyman and Cropper finished in
1:37.50. beating both the old NCAA
record and Arizona by nearly eight
tenths. The Stanford quartet had an
even more dominant performance in
the 4(K) medley relay. A fantastic
swim by Georgia still left the Bull
dogs 1.8 seconds behind the Cardi
nal. With a time of 3:33.61, the Stan
ford team had crushed the old
NCAA mark by more than two sec
onds.
In the freestyle relays Arizona
reigned supreme. The Wildcats
came away with victories in each 112 ree

relay. The Cardinal, however, was
not far behind. In the 2(M) free relay
the Stanford team of Cropper, se
nior Lindsay Gassner, Hyman and

I think last year we were all a little scatterbrained, not quite focused as a unit. This year,
we re working together a lot more; we're much more excited. You can feel the support be
hind the team.'
— Catherine Fox

Fox came in fourth with a time of
1:30.29. The 4(H) free relay team of
Cropper, Rose, Gassner and Fox

placed second in 3:16.99. In the 8(X)
free relay the Cardinal slid down a
notch to third. The team of Rose,
Hyman. Thies and Austevoll fin

ished in 7:11.03. Such stellar relay
swims were more than enough to
propel the Cardinal toward victory.

While the Cardinal was powerful
in certain events, there were also fi
nals which saw no Stanford swim
mers.

"Each of us have a weakness,"
said Stanford head coach Richard
Quick.

The key weakness was distanee
swimming. The Cardinal did not
have a single competitor in the finals
of the 2(X), S(X) and 1,650 free events.
Meanwhile, Stanford's chief com
petitors were sending multiple swim
mers into each final. The other con
cerns for the Cardinal were the 1M
events. The 400 1M final had three
USC and two Georgia swimmers but
not a single member of the Stanford
squad. Likewise, the 2(X) IM was
peppered with Georgia and SMIJ
swimmers.
The divers were also able to lend
a helping hand in the competition.
Junior Carissa Zenorini placed
eighth in the 1-meter competition
while freshman Kim Powers finished
sixth in both the 3-meter and plat
form competitions.
My the end of the meet, the world
of women's swimming had returned
to normal. Last year's loss proved to
be a fluke, not a trend. It was a fluke
which this Stanford team would not
allow to happen again.
"I think last year we were all a lit
tle scatterbrained, not quite focused
as a unit." Fox said. "This year, we're
working together a lot more; we're
much more excited. You can feel the
support behind the team."
As a result this close-knit squad
produced Stanford's eighth national
championship in the illustrious his
tory of women's swimming.
All season the goal had been to
reestablish the dominance of Stan
ford women's swimming. As of now,
the mission is complete and the tro
phy has returned to a familiar home.
