The Stanford women's swim
ming team had to wait an entire
year for the chance to regain the na
tional title. Given the opportunity,
the Cardinal swam its way to su
premacy in collegiate swimming,
defeating second-place Arizona
422-378. Georgia (3bB). Southern
Methodist (339) and USC (277)
rounded out the top five.
All season the Stanford women
had to cope with the thought of the
trophy resting in the hands of I ! SC.
Another close second-place finish
would only make Stanford seem less
powerful and all the more vulnera
ble. The Cardinal needed nothing
less than the title, and it had no in
tention of letting the title slip away
once again. Led by sophomore
Catherine Fox and freshman Misty
Hvman the Stanford squad turned in
a convincing performance en route
to regaining its throne.

tremely competitive meet was ex
pected.

vsill see some of the most keen com
petition and some of the most excit
ing swimming that has ever been at
the NCAA level." said Arizona
coach Frank Busch.

been rewritten.

hxiks in five events was the NCAA
Swimmer of the Year. Hvman.

pionship she said. "My first thought
was that it would be a lot of tension."

seem to bother her. In her first
event, the KM) fly, Hyman put on an
awesome show She won in a time ot
51.34 seconds, besting her nearest
opponent by more than 1.3 seconds,
and shattering the NCAA. I S.
Open and American records by

the 2<X) flv. Her winning time of
1:55.70 beat the second-place finish

Minnesota. To put a finishing touch
on her individual events. Hyman set
yet another pool record in the 2(X)
backstroke. Her time of 1:53.12 was

defended her title in the 100 back
with a time of 52.71, establishing

any possible anxiety prior to her
races was her mindset going into the
meet.

and race." Fox said. "It is a big party
and you just go and play."

free, where she was also able to de
fend her title from last year with a
time of 22.21. Defending both of her
titles required all the energy she
