##

Senior Heather Pease spent
spring break leading the Stanford
synchronized swimming team to
its first national title.
Pease earned first place in solo,
figures, duet and trio, and she
earned the individual high-point
title for the second consecutive
year.
Although this alone is an im
pressive feat, it merely adds one
more highlight to a 12-year career
in synchro that includes six years
on national teams, one year on the
gold medal-winning Olympic
team, and competitions in China,
Russia, Argentina, as well as most
of Europe.
Pease started synchronized
swimming when she was 10, grow
ing up in Monterey. She had al
ways liked both swimming and
gymnastics, so she thought syn
chro provided the best of both
worlds.
"1 was kind of a klutz on land,"
she said. "I loved swimming."
Pease's first synchro club, lo
cated in Monterey, was a small
club called "Cyprus." After four
years on the club team, she quali
fied for the Junior National
Team.
The next year, as a high school
junior. Pease moved to Walnut
Creek to train at one of the top
clubs in the country under
Olympic coach Gail Emery. She
then went to college at St. Mary's,
which was close enough to Walnut
Creek that she coukl continue her
six-hour daily practice schedule
there.
She made the national team for
the next three years, and after two
years at St. Mary's, she made the
Olympic team in 19%.

Pease swam on the gold medal
winning, eight-woman American
team. She describes the Olympics
in Atlanta as being exciting,
swimming in front of a home
crowd.
After the Olympics, most of
the members of the Olympic team
retired. Pease, however, decided
to transfer to Stanford and swim
here.
"1 always wanted to go to Stan
ford. growing up as a kid," she
said. Now she had the opportuni
ty, so she took it.
For her, the most important as
pect of synchronized swimming is
the collective effort.
"The biggest thing are the peo
ple on the team, and I've had a ton
of fun," she explained.
Pease (Joes not discount the
skill of her teammates.
"We have some pretty good
people on this team," she said.
Pease noted that three or four of
the 10 team members have a shot
at participating in the next
Olympic Games. Pease said it's
impressive to have a team of that
caliber to swim with here at Stan
ford.
Next year the English major
will stay to complete premedical
requirements and swim for the
Stanford synchro team one more
year. Pease still has eligibility re
maining. as she did not compete at
the collegiate level until attending
Stanford.
For now. the team appreciates
Pease's contribution to their na
tional title.
"Heather was phenomenal,"
head coach Viekey Weir said, re
flecting on her performance at na
tionals. "Heather was just the true
leader for the team in every as
pect."
