# Harvard teaches Stanford a lesson
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
Some of life's mysteries can
never he fully understood. For ex
ample. no one will probably ever be
able to explain why everything fell
apart for the nation's fifth-ranked
team in the last week of its season.
Hut that's exactly what happened
to the Stanford women's basketball
team (21-6). After a hard-fought
season that saw the team's improve
ment rewarded with a top seed in the
tournament, the Cardinal lost two
key players in a matter of days —se-
nior forwards Kristin Folkl (a
Kodak All-American) and Vanessa
Nygaard — and never rebounded
from the loss, falling in the first
round of the NCAA tournament to
Harvard 71-67.
And people are probably still
asking themselves what happened,
as the Crimson became the first No.
16 seed ever to defeat a No. 1 seed in
the NCAA tournament (men or
women), ending Stanford's 59-game
win streak at Maples Pavilion and

marking the first time the Cardinal
has bowed out in the first round of
the tournament since I^X2.
"Obviously for those who have
followed our season, this isn't what
we planned," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer after the loss. "The
things we've tried to handle this
week really took a lot out of us. It's
been a horrible week tonight isn't
the worst of it."
Hut when the game started, it mo
mentarily looked as if the Cardinal
would respond to the situation. Ju
nior guard Regan Freuen swished a
beautiful three-point slot off the
opening tip. and Harv trd coach
Kathy Delaney-Smith's pian to dou
ble-, triple- and quadruple-team
Stanford's posts didn't look like such
a marvelous idea.
But unfortunately for the Card,
its shooting went ice-cold after that,
and Harvard opened up the lead on
a 16-3 run over the next 7 minutes, 13
seconds of the half. Stanford shot
just 31 percent from the field in the
first period compared to Harvard's
62.5 percent, and the Crimson

pulled out to as much as a 12-point
'cad behind the play of senior for
ward Allison Feaster, a Kodak All-
American.
I easier, the nation's leading scor
er and arguably the best player ever
in the Ivy League, was dominating in
the first half, scoring 16 points and
grabbing seven rebounds.
"She's a really good player, espe
cially to be a post." said senior for
ward Olympia Scott. "She can take
the ball off the dribble, shoot the
three and score down low. She was
very effective for their team."
Meanwhile, the ("rimson defense
was stilling. Stanford had only nine
points at the 9-minute mark and
didn't get a basket from the inside
until senior center Heather Owen
connected on a driving layup from
the top of the key with 10:14 remain
ing in the half.
Stanford's frontline felt the ab
sence of Folkl and Nygaard as ()wen
and Scott combined for only eight
points and four rebounds at the
break. The guard contribution was
not enough to open things up inside

as Freuen was the only perimeter
player to hit outside shots with any
consistency.
Hut somehow the game never re
ally seemed out of hand, and Maples
fans were just waiting for their team
to take over the contest. And for a
few minutes in the first half that's
what happened. Trailing 21-9 with
remaining in the half, the ( ardi
nal stepped up its defensive intensi
ty, improved its offensive output and
surged to a 34-33 lead on a Freuen
three-pointer.
Hut every time Stanford seemed
to find its poise and confidence. I lar
vard dug a little deeper for some of
its own. The Crimson closed out the
half with a 10-0 run that put it up 43-
34 heading into the locker room.
" That was a great run." Delaney-
Smith said. "It was important to go
into the locker room with that much
of a lead because it gave our team a
boost. The single biggest surprise (of
the game) was the way we held our
poise."
