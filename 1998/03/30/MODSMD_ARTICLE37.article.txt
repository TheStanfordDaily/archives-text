# Backcourt lets its guard down under pressure
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
II one of the keys to a team's suc
cess in the NCAA tournament is
guard play, then the Stanford
women's basketball team learned
this lesson the hard way with a stun
ning first-round loss to Harvard
March 14.
Just ask head coach lara Van-
Derveer.
Bitterly disappointed at her
team's performance. VanDerveer
blasted the play of her backcourt in a
press conference the day after the 71 -
67 loss to the Crimson. She just about
covered every aspect of their play,
from work ethic to attitude.
"I'm terribly disappointed to see
the problems (the guards] have,"

VanDerveer said. "You'd think that
watching (alumnae) Jamila (Wide
man) and Kate (Starbird) for a year,
they would understand the big pic
ture better than they do, but they
don't. One of the hardest things is 1
know we'll never go anywhere with
out an adjustment and improvement
in the attitude of our guards. They
didn't get it done."
VanDerveer was so disgusted by
her team's play, she went so far as to
say sophomore guard Yvonne Gbal
azeh may step up and become a cap
tain next year.
After being on the wrong side of a
historic loss to a No. 16 seed, some
really dicey things will be said. I lere's
more from VanDerveer:
"When you've coached the cal
iber players and teams that I've

coached, you know when something
tastes right, and you know when it's
not right," VanDerveer said. "Our
guard play hasn't been right all year.
It's not physical talent. It's related to
work ethic, understanding the team,
giving tloor leadership, developing
chemistry with the team, not giving
up on the court and not making fouls
and decisions that don't give us a
chance in"the game against Har
vard.
While it has been questioned
whether or not these comments were
out of line, anyone who saw the
Maples debacle two weeks ago prob
ably partially understood Van-
Derveer's frustration. Aside from ju
nior guard Regan Freuen's 19points,
the sophomore tandem of Milena
Flores, Melody Peterson and Christi

na Batastini shot 4 for 16 from the
floor and tallied 18 points. Worse yet.
with the game on the line, Flores and
Peterson failed to look down low for
a high percentage shot and resorted
to desperation jumpers that missed
badly.
And what about Cibala/eh. the
future captain? She never entered
the contest.
So where does the Cardinal go
from here? Five freshmen to go along
with this year's freshman class will
round out a young team that has big
shoes to fill and high expectations to
meet. Three Final Four appearances
and 59 straight wins at Maples can do
that to the Cardinal's spoiled fans,
who hope their team can be at next
year's Final Four at San Jose Arena.
"We've signed five freshmen,"
VanDerveer said. "Our biggest is
Cori Enghusen at 6-foot-7. She'll re
mind you of a Kara Wolters. She has
that kind of build. Also from Wash
ington is Enjoli I/idor. She's 6-1. She
plays four, and hopefully we'll move
her to the three. The biggest im
provement will be on the wings with
Lauren St. Clair and I.indsey Ya
masaki."
About those scathing comments.
VanDerveer eventually apologized
to her players and fans March 23.
saying that her "staff and our team is
committed to continuing with a pos
itive attitude, great work ethic and a
winning tradition."
After such a tumultuous upset,
VanDerveer should have probably
worried less about apologizing and
more about rebounding strongly
next season.
It's not as if they don't have
enough motivation.
