# Students to register on Web
## Web Axess axes Folio 
### Alicia McCann Contributing writer 
During the next few days, Stanford students will begin
to register for classes. However, it will quickly become
apparent that a major change has taken place in the reg
istration process. Today, the Axess system through Tel
net became extinct. Students will now only be able to reg
ister through the World Wide Web.
"I feel that so long as the Web access is as reliable as
the Telnet, there shouldn't be any problems," said junior
Jason Conroy.
In an attempt to assuage concerns about reliability
and to make a smooth transition into the new process,
students have already received several messages through
Folio Axess about this new system of registration.
Basically, the system itself is not changing. Just like the
Folio version, the Axess system on the Web will be oper
ating from 8 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. Monday through Friday
and from 9 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
The shift to the Web will make it easier for students to
connect to Axess through outside computers. The system
can be reached through several different methods. The
Stanford home page provides a link to Axess. A student
then simply needs to enter his or her SUNet ID, password
and personal identification number. Any questions re
garding SUNet IDs and I'lNs can be directed to eon
sult@forsythe. Any other problems or questions about
the system should be sent to web-axess(Â« forsythe.
The system can also be reached through the address
https://axess.stanford.edu I his is ,i more direct connec
tion, but it is just as effective.
Students without a standard browser will still be able
to connect to Axess. Once he or she logs into any I.eland
account, entering the command "lynx" at the prompt will
allow the student to use a Lynx browser to find Axess.
"I think that it's for the better," said freshman Ed
Froehlich. "I never used Telnet anyway. I think that the
display on the Web is easier to understand and work
with."
An\ student or staff member
uho uses Axess should be aware of
the changes so that the system can
still be used efficiently and produc
tively.
