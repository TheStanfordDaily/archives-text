# The 						Play's not the thing
## Miracle Minute vaults Card to Final Four 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
ST. LOUIS — Forget The Play. The greatest memo
ry in Stanford sports is now the Miracle Minute.
For Rhode Island, call it the Big Choke, the Silence of
the Rams, whatever.
But few words could explain the tumultuous turn of
events that oceured at the Kiel Center during the last 59
seconds of Stanford's emotional 79-77 victory over
Rhode Island on March 22.
In short, Rhode Island had control. Stanford wrestled
it away.
Rhode Island head coach Jim Harrick, usually not at
a loss for words, was stunned.
Stunned.
He had coached the game of his life, shutting down
the Cardinal inside game for what seemed like eternity.
At game's end, there was nothing Harrick could have
done, no advice he could have given his team which
would have changed the outcome. For once in this tour
nament, maybe even in his coaching career, Harrick
could do nothing to affect his team's destiny.
"Sometimes at the end of the game you lose your
sense of control," he said.
This was exactly what Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery had wanted. When Rhode Island began to slow
things down to try to run time off the clock, Stanford
began fouling.
"We had made a decision." Montgomery said. "We
wanted to be in control as much as we could. The more
possessions you have at the end of the game, the more
likely it is that you can make something happen."
Words cannot do justice to the final plays of the game,
because they were dominated by inscrutable emotion
which left fans, coaches and players wondering what had
just happened.
One thing is clear. Any Stanford or Rhode Island fan
who failed to see the game or Hipped channels when the
Rams led by 11 with under nine minutes to play or by six
with the immortal minute left committed a true Cardinal
sin. And this description is for them.
Fifty-nine seconds.
The Ram lead is six. Arthur Lee, having been out
played by Tyson Wheeler all night, takes the ball and
gets that look on his face. Wheeler defends him for a
drive. Lee jumps to the left and releases a line drive,
nothing but net. Lime consumed: seven seconds.
Fifty-two seconds.
The Ram lead is three. After a Cardinal timeout,
David Moseley fouls guard Cuttino Mobley. who makes

one of two free throws. Mark Madsen grabs the board.
Net time consumed: three seconds.
Forty-nine seconds.
The Ram lead is four. Lee throws the ball into Mad
sen. who makes a lavup. Rhode Island, who was suc
cessful in double-teaming Madsen the entire game, was
not in position for a double team this time. Net time con
sumed: nine seconds.
Forty seconds.
The Ram lead is two. The Cardinal has to foul. Mose
ley commits his fifth on Preston Murphy, deemed by


Garth Patil — Daily
Junior forward Mark Madsen converts a second
chance bucket to close the gap in the closing mo
ments of regulation Saturday. Madsen became a
hot topic nationally after a scintillating dunk and
dance gave Stanford a shocking lead over Rhode
Island in the Midwest Regional final.
Montgomery to be the shooter most
likely to miss. Murphy hits both free
throws. Net time consumed: one
second.
Thirty-nine seconds.
The Ram lead is four. Ryan
Mendez inbounds the ball to Mad
sen, who passes to Lee with speed.
Lee spurts around to the left and dri
ves toward the basket, letting the
ball go a split second before he is
fouled by Luther Clay. The ball goes
in and Lee makes the free throw.
Net time elapsed: seven seconds.
Thirty-two seconds.
The Ram lead is one. Mobley re
ceives the ball and waits to be
fouled, but when he is not he begins
to dribble the ball up the court. Lee
pokes at the ball, which comes loose
and into Madsen's hands.
Madsen dribbles once, steps on
the floor with both feet and puts up
the dunk heard around Rhode Is
land while being fouled by Antonio
Reynolds-Dean. Madsen emits a
primal scream and shakes his 6-8,
235-pound torso in a manner only
described as unique. Tim Young
calms him down.
Harrick calls timeout and tries to
ice Madsen. but Madsen sinks the
free throw anyway. Net time
elapsed: six seconds.
Twenty-six seconds.
The Cardinal lead is two. The
Rams are running a set play. But
Reynolds-Dean misses the cue for a
back-door cut and accidentally
throws the ball out of bounds.
Murphy fouls Weems near mid
court, who hits one of two free
throws. Net time elapsed: 13 sec
onds.
Thirteen seconds.
The Cardinal lead is three. Mont
gomery is shouting to guard against
the three and not foul.
Wheeler, who has made some
impossible three-pointers in the

game, has the ball in front of the
Rhode Island bench. He goes up for
the shot, guarded closely by Lee.
Lee gets a lot more than ball and
sends Wheeler to the line for three
free throws and the chance to tie the
game. Net time elapsed: eight sec
onds.
Five seconds.
The Cardinal lead is three.
Wheeler misses the first free throw,
surprising everyone on the court ex
cept Harrick, who appears emotion
ally drained. Wheeler's second shot
barely hits the front of the rim.
Lee walks toward the Stanford
fans at the other end of the court and
puts his hands to his neck in a choke
sign. Neither the referees nor the
CBS camera crews catch the ges
ture, which, if considered taunting
by the officials, could be cause for a
technical foul.
Wheeler purposely misses the
last free throw and knocks the ball
out bounds. Net time elapsed: .2 sec
onds.
4.8 seconds.
The Cardinal lead is still three.
Lee is fouled by Mobley and sinks
both free throws. Net time elapsed:
.6 seconds.
4.2 seconds.
Mobley dribbles down the court
and connects from 10 feet beyond
the three-point line. The buzzer
sounds, and Stanford advances to
the Final Four.
There — that's a chronology. But
the true effects of the Miracle
Minute could be seen only in the
press conference after the game,
w hen players and coaches from both
sides were asked to recall what had
just occurred and no one really
could.
"I can't really tell you what hap
pened," Montgomery said.
Harrick could only speak in the
big picture: "They cut my heart out
and my team's heart out," he said.
As the buzzer sounded, there was
no question which team had the
heart.
