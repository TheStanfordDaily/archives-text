# The
						Play's not the thing
## Miracle Minute vaults Card to Final Four 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
ST. LOUIS — Forget The Play. The greatest memo
ry in Stanford sports is now the Miracle Minute.
For Rhode Island, call it the Big Choke, the Silence of
the Rams, whatever.
But few words could explain the tumultuous turn of
events that oceured at the Kiel Center during the last 59
seconds of Stanford's emotional 79-77 victory over
Rhode Island on March 22.
In short, Rhode Island had control. Stanford wrestled
it away.
Rhode Island head coach Jim Harrick, usually not at
a loss for words, was stunned.
Stunned.
He had coached the game of his life, shutting down
the Cardinal inside game for what seemed like eternity.
At game's end, there was nothing Harrick could have
done, no advice he could have given his team which
would have changed the outcome. For once in this tour
nament, maybe even in his coaching career, Harrick
could do nothing to affect his team's destiny.
"Sometimes at the end of the game you lose your
sense of control," he said.
This was exactly what Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery had wanted. When Rhode Island began to slow
things down to try to run time off the clock, Stanford
began fouling.
"We had made a decision." Montgomery said. "We
wanted to be in control as much as we could. The more
possessions you have at the end of the game, the more
likely it is that you can make something happen."
Words cannot do justice to the final plays of the game,
because they were dominated by inscrutable emotion
which left fans, coaches and players wondering what had
just happened.
One thing is clear. Any Stanford or Rhode Island fan
who failed to see the game or Hipped channels when the
Rams led by 11 with under nine minutes to play or by six
with the immortal minute left committed a true Cardinal
sin. And this description is for them.
Fifty-nine seconds.
The Ram lead is six. Arthur Lee, having been out
played by Tyson Wheeler all night, takes the ball and
gets that look on his face. Wheeler defends him for a
drive. Lee jumps to the left and releases a line drive,
nothing but net. Lime consumed: seven seconds.
Fifty-two seconds.
The Ram lead is three. After a Cardinal timeout,
David Moseley fouls guard Cuttino Mobley. who makes

one of two free throws. Mark Madsen grabs the board.
Net time consumed: three seconds.
Forty-nine seconds.
The Ram lead is four. Lee throws the ball into Mad
sen. who makes a lavup. Rhode Island, who was suc
cessful in double-teaming Madsen the entire game, was
not in position for a double team this time. Net time con
sumed: nine seconds.
Forty seconds.
The Ram lead is two. The Cardinal has to foul. Mose
ley commits his fifth on Preston Murphy, deemed by

Junior forward Mark Madsen converts a second
chance bucket to close the gap in the closing mo
ments of regulation Saturday. Madsen became a
hot topic nationally after a scintillating dunk and
dance gave Stanford a shocking lead over Rhode
Island in the Midwest Regional final.
