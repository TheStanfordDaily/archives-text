SAN AN TONIO — For Arthur
Lee, it's finally over.
The junior point guard — more
popularly known to the national
media as Brevin Knight's protege
— no longer has to put up with that
distinction.
Lee would be the last person to
downplay the crucial role that
Knight played in building up Stan
ford's national status, but he would
prefer to be recognized for his own
talent.
And that talent was showcased
beautifully throughout the NCAA
tournament, where Lee made few
errors and many clutch plays. No
one questions whether Lee and fel
low junior Kris Weems can deal
with the quickest backcourts in the
country.
"I thought we've been proving
that throughout the tournament."
Lee said. "We've been playing
quick team after quick team, and
we continued to beat them. We had
a chance to win this (Kentucky]
game, to say the least."
In the tournament. Lee aver
aged 20.6 points. 5.6 assists and 3.2
rebounds while earning honors as
the Midwest Regional's Most Out
standing Player and leading the
Cardinal to its first Final Four ap
pearance in 56 years.
And everything Lee has done
has been in dramatic fashion.
Last year, when the game was
on the line and someone needed to
step up. everyone knew that the
way would be cleared for Knight to
execute.
This season, Lee has taken over
in crunch time.
Among his highlights:
• When UCLA came into

Maples Pavilion on Jan. 17. the
game was regarded as a chance for
the Cardinal to prove it deserved
its top-10 ranking.
The Cardinal ran up an 18-point
halftime lead, hut the Bruins
stormed back and cut the deficit to
one. Lee stepped up and hit hack
to-back three-pointers to end the
comeback.
• At California on Feb 4. the

Cardinal found itself in a two-game
slump and with damaged credibili
ty. Ihe Bears ha' pushed Stanford
around for most of the game, hut
the Cardinal was able to keep it
close. Lee was fouled on a crucial
trey and converted the four-point
play, swinging the momentum hack
in Stanford's favor and leading
