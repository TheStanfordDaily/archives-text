SAN AN TONIO — For Arthur
Lee, it's finally over.
The junior point guard — more
popularly known to the national
media as Brevin Knight's protege
— no longer has to put up with that
distinction.
Lee would be the last person to
downplay the crucial role that
Knight played in building up Stan
ford's national status, but he would
prefer to be recognized for his own
talent.
And that talent was showcased
beautifully throughout the NCAA
tournament, where Lee made few
errors and many clutch plays. No
one questions whether Lee and fel
low junior Kris Weems can deal
with the quickest backcourts in the
country.
"I thought we've been proving
that throughout the tournament."
Lee said. "We've been playing
quick team after quick team, and
we continued to beat them. We had
a chance to win this (Kentucky]
game, to say the least."
In the tournament. Lee aver
aged 20.6 points. 5.6 assists and 3.2
rebounds while earning honors as
the Midwest Regional's Most Out
standing Player and leading the
Cardinal to its first Final Four ap
pearance in 56 years.
And everything Lee has done
has been in dramatic fashion.
Last year, when the game was
on the line and someone needed to
step up. everyone knew that the
way would be cleared for Knight to
execute.
This season, Lee has taken over
in crunch time.
Among his highlights:
• When UCLA came into

Maples Pavilion on Jan. 17. the
game was regarded as a chance for
the Cardinal to prove it deserved
its top-10 ranking.
The Cardinal ran up an 18-point
halftime lead, hut the Bruins
stormed back and cut the deficit to
one. Lee stepped up and hit hack
to-back three-pointers to end the
comeback.
• At California on Feb 4. the

Cardinal found itself in a two-game
slump and with damaged credibili
ty. Ihe Bears ha' pushed Stanford
around for most of the game, hut
the Cardinal was able to keep it
close. Lee was fouled on a crucial
trey and converted the four-point
play, swinging the momentum hack
in Stanford's favor and leading

them to the comeback 74-72 win.
• In the Midwest Regional final
in St. Louis on March 22, Rhode Is
land had a six-point lead with 52
seconds left on the clock.
With the Stanford season seem
ingly over, Lee led one of the
greatest comebacks in college bas
ketball with his performance in the
"Miracle Minute." First he hit a
three.
Then he penetrated the lane
and dished off to power forward
Mark Madsen for a layin. Then
Lee penetrated again and hit a
layup as he was fouled, converting
a three-point play.
On the ensuing inbound, Lee
knocked the ball out of Cuttino
Mobley's hands, and Madsen
picked it up, hitting the dunk and
getting fouled for another three
points. Lee later iced the 79-77 vic
tories with two free throws, sealing
his MVP status.
His willingness to take the big
shot is no surprise. It can be seen in
his eyes as he dribbles down the
court. His determined glare lets
everyone know that he'll be taking
over.
The Cardinal has a play sig
naled by a thumbs-down. It simply
lets everyone know to spread out
and let Lee create.
Sometimes head coach Mike
Montgomery doesn't even have a
chance to call it. Lee will get the
ball and give the signal himself, un
willing to let his team lose.
"He was something," Mont
gomery said. "I've got to believe,
based on his performance in the
tournament, he goes into next year
as a guy to look at. He answered
the call. He ran the club."
And now he can enjoy the acco
lades.
And in a year, freshman point
guard Mike McDonald might have
to learn to deal with constant ques
tions about taking over for Arthur
Lee.
