# Frosh grows up against Purdue
## Collins helps Cardinal reach Elite Eight 
### Brian Singer Staff writer 
ST. LOIJIS - Purdue coach Gene Keady told his
players before they matched up against Stanford March
20 that Stanford forward freshman Jarron C ollins was "a
good player."
In other words, that was all Purdue knew before
Collins entered the game midway through the first half
with Purdue leading by five points.

Seven minutes. 10 points and 11 rebounds later.
Collins had led the Cardinal to an 11-point lead which
would never he relinquished.
Brought in after junior center Tim Young picked up
his third foul with 6:41 remaining in the first half. ( 'ollins
was told by Stanford coach Mike Montgomery to "go in
and get 'em," Collins said.
"I said okay." ( ollins said. "I was out there for awhile
and I thought. Timmy?"
His individual effort boosted the starters' confidence
as Stanford went on to win the game 67-59 and advance
to the Elite Eight matchup against Rhode Island
"We were better off when Young played," Keady ad
mitted.
Collins was most effective on the offensive glass
where he grabbed eight rebounds, many ol which show
cased his abilities to tip Cardinal free-throw misses back
to the top of the key.
The highly-touted freshman was recruited with his
brother Jason — who sat out this year due to injury
and said he realized the position Stanford was in and |ust
tried to do anything he could.
"My job is to come off the bench and give my team a
lift." he said. "Whenever I'm called upon to give the team
a lift I try and do that."
Collins almost single-handedly willed Stanford back
into the game with five lavups in five minutes, culminat
ing a 23-5 Cardinal run with a layin to end the first half.
After the game. Keady pointed to ( ollins' play and
that run as the turning point in the game.
"The game was lost in the first half." kead\ said. "We
lost our enthusiasm."
Virtually every Cardinal win has been incumbent on a
different Cardinal player stepping up his level of play,
and the NCAA Tournament was no different.
Against College of Charleston, forward Rvan
Mendez had two key three-point shots to stave off a
Cougar comeback. Arthur Lee keyed Stanford's Miracle
Minute, allowing Stanford to surge past Rhode Island
and advance to the Final Four.
But March 20 was Collins'night to bask intheglor> of
the television cameras and clamoring media
"A lot of freshmen go into the game and it is natural
to have tentativeness," said sophomore forward Mark
Madsen. "I saw no indication of tentativeness 1 saw onh
aggressiveness and that carried over to others on the
team."
For better or for worse. Collins' name will now appear
prominently in the Stanford video archive other coaches
examine when preparing to take on the Cardinal.
"He's got a good sense," Montgomery said. "He's got
a gixxl nose. He's not a good feel for the name."
