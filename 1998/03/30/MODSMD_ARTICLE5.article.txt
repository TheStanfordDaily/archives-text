The Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity
will once again be able to call 592 May
field Ave. home sweet home starting
next September if they satisfy certain re
quirements, according to Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais.
The Dekes. who lost their housing
last June due to an alcohol-related
pledge incident, received a letter from
Wais on March 20. The letter was an up
date tin the status of the Dekes v\ith re
spect to regaining their house.
"With the general status letter, the

University has essentially indicated [the
Dekes] have met all of the conditions
that were required to get their house
back after the decision to unhouse the
fraternity was made last year." Wais
said.
There are, however, several out
standing conditions that the Dekes must
fulfill before being rehoused.
Wais said there are three conditions
that still need to be completed, but of
those three, the one the University is
most concerned about is the member
ship requirement.
Wais is hopeful that the Dekes will be
able to successfully fulfill their require

ments.
"The bottom line is that the fraternity
has made significant progress since last
June in straightening out their organiza
tion." he s,ud. "Based on their progress,
the University is very confident that they
will meet those conditions."
In order to fulfill the membership re
quirement. the Dekes must have at least
10 people commit to the fraternity for
next year after Rush, for a total of 29
members, according to junior Mike (ire
nier, Deke president.
The Dekes must also go through an
alcohol education program and perform
a community service requirement. Ore

nicr said.
"The Dekes have worked fall and
winter quarter to complete the sanctions
outlined b\ Dean \\ .ns." he said.
Issues such as house staff and finan
cial commitments will require that the
Dekes plan and coordinate with the I ni
versitv in moving back into their old
house.
"II the\ meet all the remaining out
standing conditions. we will send a letter
for the Dekes to resume occupancy in
September." Waissaid.
