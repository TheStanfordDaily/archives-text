## Quad's teaching facility, stats building ready for service 
### Arthur Hu Editorial staff 
Alter several months of delays, the University
will open another building in the Science and En
gineering Quad.
The science quad's leaching Center will he
available for students and classes starting tomor
row, said Olivier Pieron, co-program manager for
the project. The new Statistics Department build
ing opened in the end of February.
The center is designed to serve as both a lec
ture hall and a multimedia presentation building.
Two large auditoriums in the new center will re
place the classroom space lost by the demolition

of the Physics Tank.
Earlier this year, delays in the construction of
the quad forced physics classes to find new
venues, which were sometimes unsuitable for cer
tain types of demonstrations.
The new auditoriums will accommodate 4KO
and 2(H) students, respectively, and are set up for
Stanford Instructional Television Network class
es.
The teaching center is the second building of
four to open in the $120 million quad.
The first, a new statistics building, is in approx
imately the same place as the old Sequoia Hall,
which was home to the Statistics Department
when it was demolished two years ago to make

room for the new quad.
The remainder of the quad, while still under
construction, is now on schedule. Pieron said.
"The construction is going well â€” the electrical
engineering building is 35 percent complete, and
the Mc( 'ullough building is about 25 percent com
plete."
The Mc( ullough Annex will serve as the lab
building for the Center for Materials Research.
"We're expecting completion at the end of
1998, hopefully. Our only major problem has
been the weather. With construction, you never
know until you are finished." Pieron added.
The science quad was originally conceived four
years ago.

stand last fall. As a part of the new Science and Engineering Quad,
the Materials Research Annex is being constructed in its place.
