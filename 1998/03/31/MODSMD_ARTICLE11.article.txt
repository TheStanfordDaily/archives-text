# Kentucky defeats Utah 78-69

### 
SAN ANTONIO (AP) — No lead was
safe against Kentucky these past two
weeks. And last night was no different.
The Wildcats fought back from 17
down with 1-2 minutes left against Duke.
They raced ahead from a 10-point deficit
in the second half against Stanford.
And with the NCAA championship on
the line and I Jtah leading by seven with 10
minutes to go. Kentucky simply forced its
will on the sagging, weary Utes to pull
away to a victory.
In two breathless spurts in the final fre

netic minutes, Kentucky scored nine
straight points to take the lead for the first
time since the early minutes. Then, after
six points by Utah, the Wildcats fashioned
a 10-1 run to surge ahead for good 70-64.
Just as they had in the South Regional
final against Duke and again in the nation
al semifinals against Stanford, the Wildcats
fell behind in the first half, trailing 41-31 at
halftime. The deficit was as many as 12
points in the opening minutes of the sec
ond half before Kentucky started shooting
well, something Utah's last two opponents

couldn't do.
The Utes, the second-best defensive
team in the country this season, had held its
five tournament opponents to 39 percent
shooting and an average of 62.5 points.
Kentucky, which finished 29-for-57
from the field (51 percent), chipped awa>
at the lead by scoring on seven of 10 pos
sessions. The Wildcats took the lead for
the first time since early in the first half at
60-58 with 7:16 to play on a breakaway
dunk by Jeff Sheppard after he stole the
ball from Hanno Mottola.
