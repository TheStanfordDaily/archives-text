# No deal between Israel and Palestinians
## U.S. peace proposal falls

JERUSALEM (AP) â€”U.S. envoy Dennis
Ross was left empty-handed yesterday after
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
refused a U.S. proposal that he withdraw
troops from 13 percent of the West Bank.
The American mediator's fourth and final
meeting with Netanyahu ended last night with
no deal. He was to depart Israel early today.
Earlier. Ross suggested American patience
was running out and the Clinton administra
tion would not keep up the mediation effort
indefinitely. "At some point we have to bring
this effort to a conclusion." he said.
David Bar-Illan, a top adviser to
Netanyahu, said the prime minister "flatly
rejected the idea of a 13 percent withdrawal."
But Bar-Illan insisted that "progress was
made" in the meetings with Ross.
"We believe there is a much greater under
standing of our position on the part of the
Americans," he said.
Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath
said it was too early to say whether Ross' mis

sion had failed. "Each side presented their
conditions and perceptions of the minimum
things they can accept," he said.
In the West Bank, where frustration is
growing over Washington's inability to break
the deadlock in the peace talks. Palestinians
chanting "Death to America!" stoned Israeli
troops.
Israeli troops fired tear gas and metal pel
lets to disperse hundreds of protesters in the
West Bank towns of Bethlehem, El Birch and
Ramallah. Several Palestinians were injured.
Ross was meeting with Netanyahu to try to
get his backing for Washington's proposal
that Israel withdraw from 13 percent of the
West Bank in several stage over 12 weeks.
The Palestinians would meet each stage
with new efforts to prevent terror attacks in
Israel.
Netanyahu says Israel can give up no more
than 9 percent of the West Bank, and has
denied Israeli media reports that he had made
a compromise offer of 11 percent.
