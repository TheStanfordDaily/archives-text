WASHINGTON (AH — In a major test
of disability rights. Supreme Court justices
sparred yesterday over whether HIV-infected
people should he considered disabled because
of dangers involved in sex and childbearing.
The lawyer for Maine dentist Randon
Bragdon argued that Bragdon did not illegal
ly discriminate against an HIV-infected
woman by refusing to treat her at his office.
The patient. Sidney Abbott, suffers no
AIDS symptoms and therefore is not protect
ed by the Americans With Disabilities Act.
said attorney John McC arthy.
But Abbott's lawyer said lower courts cor
rectly found that Bragdon violated the law.
which bars discrimination against the disabled
in jobs, housing and public accommodations.
The law — responsible for such aids as
wheelchair ramps at countless public places
says people are disabled if they have a physi
cal or mental impairment that "substantially
limits one or more major life activities."
HIV-infected people should always lv con
sidered disabled because the contagious and
fatal nature of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome severely limits their ability to have

sex and bear children, said Abbott's attorney.
Bennett H. Klein.
Justices David H. Souter and Antonin
Scalia suggested an HIV-infected person faces
a "moral choice" rather than an actual physi
cal limit on his ability to have children.
However. Justice Anthony M Kennedy
said that if a person with highly infectious
tuberculosis stays away from other people,
"we don't just call it a moral choice."
Someone with bubonic plague would be
considered disabled, said Justice Stephen (i
Breyer.
Bragdon's lawyer said the disability law
aims to protect people whose disabilities
affect their "day-to-day independent living
and economic self-sufficiency," not HIV
infected people who suffer no symptoms.
I he disability-rights law says disabled pco
pie can be treated differently it the\ pose a
"direct threat to the health or safety of oth
ere."
"Dr Bragdon believes that when he priv
vides a service in the face of the risk of death
he should be allowed to take additional pre
cautions," McCarthy said
