JONESHORO, Ark. (AP) Some reluc
tant pupils had to he coaxed out of their par
ents' cars yesterday as Westside Middle
School got back to the business of learning
after four classmates and a teacher were
killed in a schoolyard ambush.
The rules were bent a little — classes were
allowed to be noisier, for example — and stu
dents read cards and letters from people
around the world before classes were held for
the first time since last Tuesday's shootings.
Two students at the school, Mitchell John
son. 13. and Drew (iolden. 11. are accused of
using stolen weapons to gun down the victims
during a fake fire alarm. Ten were wounded:
three — including a teacher — remained hos
pitalized yesterday.
Mitchell and Drew are being held on five
counts each of murder and 10 counts of bat

tery pending an April 29 hearing.
I he way Arkansas law now stands, the two
hoys accused of killing five people at their
school will be able to own guns the day they
get out of the juvenile |ustice system
Under state law. adults convicted of
felonies can never again possess a gun. But
Arkansas youths convicted as juveniles of
similar crimes can buy and possess guns the
moment they are released from state supervi
sion - at age IS. That's because such young
sters are considered juvenile delinquents, not
felons.
A community memorial service for the five
victims is scheduled for today. President Clin
ton plans to address the sen ice via videotape
from Africa. Attorney General Janet Reno
and (iov. Mike Huckabee were scheduled to
