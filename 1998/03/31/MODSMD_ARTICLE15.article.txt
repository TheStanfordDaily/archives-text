# Clinton strikes back
## Contempt charges filed against Jones lawyers 
### 
LITTLE ROCK (AP) — President Clin
ton's lawyers said yesterday that Paula Jones'
legal team should be cited with contempt for
violating a gag order and disclosing the iden
tity of a woman allegedly assaulted by Clinton
more than 20 years ago.
The president's lawyers said Jones'
lawyers were trying to "taint the jury pool
with false information and were using Jones
lawsuit "as a stalking horse for the investiga
tion being conducted by independent coun
sel" Kenneth Starr.
Jones' lawyers had filed court papers Sat
urday saying they had evidence of a 1970s sex
ual assault and contending that Clinton
obstructed justice b\ withholding correspon
dence about Kathleen Wille\ until after she
went on national television to accuse him ot
making a crude sexual advance.
Clinton's lawyers responded ti»da\ b\ ask
ing U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright
to strike the materials from the record. The>
also asked that Jones' lawyers be held in con
tempt of court and required to file all future

court papers under seal.
Lawyers for Jones did not immediate!)
return a telephone message.
Starr spokeswoman Deborah Gershman
said. "We are not working in collaboration
with the lawyers for Paula Jones."
Clinton's lawyers contend their legal oppo
nents are "loading up the public record" with
salacious material that isn't supposed to be
made public. Specifically, they sa\ Jones'
lawyers violated an Oct. 30 secrecy order and
an oral order March 10 to use the generic
name "Jane Doe" for am women wanting to
retain their privacy
Jones' lawyers on Saturdav identified a
registered nurse from Arkansas that the\ said
was the victim of a sexual assault b\ then-
Attorney General Bill Clinton. The\ also
made public a l c letter in which Phillip
Da\id Yoakum, an acquaintance ot the
woman, writes to her.
In the letter. Yoakum says she confided to
him an incident which he says took place 14
years earlier in a hotel room.
