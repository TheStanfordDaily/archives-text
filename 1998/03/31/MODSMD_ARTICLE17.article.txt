The Daily will use these
guidelines when making
special-fee endorsements

THE ASSU'S SPRING General
Election is fast approaching,
and students will soon be voting
on whether to fund each of the 29 stu
dent groups seeking special fees.
Traditionally, the board has offered
a value judgment about a fee group's
intrinsic worth to the campus commu
nity. recommending a simple "yes" or
"no" for each special-fee request. ITie
board has also served as an auditor,
carefully scrutinizing each group's
budget.,,
The board has reconsidered its
endorsement procedures, in light of
the fact that all of the returning fees
had their fee requests approved last
spring. Additionally, it is the role of the
ASSU Senate Appropriations Com
mittee to carefully scrutinize each spe
cial-fee group's budget. It is neither
our role to act as financial auditors nor
our responsibility to make value judg
ments about groups in which students
have demonstrated their faith by
approving their special fee.
Rather than offering a black-and
white recommendation. The Daily will
rate each group on a five-point scale.
I"he groups whose fees were approved
the year before will be rated in terms
of their "effectiveness." All others will
be rated on two different five-point
scales, one for "effectiveness" and
another for "value."
Among the factors that will be con
sidered in assessing effectiveness are
whether the group met last year's stat
ed goals, whether it budgeted appro
priately to achieve those goals and
whether it has a clear sense of the con
stituency it serves. We will also consid
er whether its programs or publica
tions are consistent with its under
standing of its constituency, whether
this year's budget and programming

reflect lessons learned during the past
year and whether plans for the upcom
ing year appear realistic.
By the term "value," we refer to the
benefit the fee group offers to the pay
ing constituency, the extent to which it
is serving a currently unmet campus
need, and fiscal efficiency.
While we will not be making a value
judgment on returning fee groups, we
reserve the right to make judgments
on the value of a first-time special-fee
request or a special-fee group whose
previous years request was denied.
Our endorsement process aims to
serve as a quality control mechanism.
Students place their faith and their
dollars in the hands of groups each
year, but most do not have the time to
follow up on whether or not each
j r
group fulfills the goals outlined each
year in the Elections Handbook. The
Daily endeavors to aid the Stanford
community in evaluating whether or
not the groups have fulfilled their stat
ed missions.
The board plans to meet with repre
sentatives from each of the groups
before the election. ITie group repre
sentatives will prepare an eight-minute
presentation, which will be followed
by a 12-minute question-and-answer
session. At least four of the boards
eight members will meet with each
group; the entire board will discuss
each special-fee application and make
a recommendation.
The board will make recommenda
tions on all groups whether or not the
group chooses to meet with us.
Ideally, these recommendations will
help students think more clearly and
critically about student groups before
they vote. However, these endorse
ments are not meant to take the place
of students thinking for themselves.
We encourage all voters to read the
Elections Handbook when it is dis
tributed next week.
The Daily welcomes responses to its
endorsements and will publish them
on a space-available basis during elec
tion week.
