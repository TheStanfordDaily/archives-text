Jonsson and the lower level
stacks of Green have been closed
since the Feb. 2 Hood. According to
University Librarian Michael
Keller, the reconstruction and
cleaning of the physical facilities in
Green were finished during spring
break, and the flooded bottom
shelves were put back in place.
Damaged books from Green
were free/e-dried and will be
reshelved during the spring and
summer quarters. Books checked
out during the repair period that
were subsequently returned have
also been reshelved. All the shelved
books will undergo a thorough
cleaning process during April.
The lower level of Green will
also be recarpeted during the next
few days. The process began during
spring break and will continue for
the next couple of days.
Most of Green's faculty study
rooms, and dissertation study rooms
as well as a number of the public
reader areas, will reopen by early
May. with new permanent furniture
installed in the studies. The reader
areas will have temporary furnish
ings until the summer. The library
materials in these areas will be avail
able during the replacement
processes.
According to the release, micro
form material previously stored in
compact shelving was moved to the
South Mezzanine due to damage to
the mechanical operating system of
the shelves. The compact shelves

cess to the government document
stacks. Material sent to the freezers
due to flood damage will be

from the water, they are reported to
be largely in good shape and are
ready for active use. A M 5 to MS pel

the materials.
The repaired hooks will be re
turned at a rate of about S.(KK) vol
