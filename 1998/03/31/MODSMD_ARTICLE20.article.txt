and white pom
pom, a "Do not
disturb" sign and a pair of
purple fuzzy dice hang
from the rearview mirror.
A huge Stanford "S"
scrawled in soap graces

the rear window. We've
crossed 13 states and all four time /ones.
We've consumed enough Dr. Pepper to caf
feinate a Russian republic and more fast
food than Bill Clinton in his first presiden
tial term.
We're on our way to the Final Four, hav
ing already witnessed the demolition of
Purdue and Rhode Island at the Midwest
Regional in St. Louis. As anyone who
watched the amazing come-from-behind
victory knows, our men's basketball team
has produced some incredible moments on
this trip. Seeing the absolute joy registered
on the players' faces and Mark Madsen's
victory celebration dance — which can only
be adequately described as a cross between
the hokey-pokey and a primate mating ritu
al — was an unforgettable experience.
But my friends and I have created some
memories on our own. There was the false
accusation of shoplifting in a St. Louis
Schnueks complete with mug shots. There
was a brief, regrettable interchange with the
Nebraska highway patrol, who showed little
interest in our "hoop dreams." There were

celebratory cigars purchased in Walgreens
and enjoyed outside of the Knight's Inn.
It has been a road trip of near misses as
well: the Dan Quayle Museum, the Lincoln
log cabin, the birthplaces of both Bill Clin
ton and James Dean. For every missed
opportunity, however, another presents
itself: Boomtown, Nev.; Hayti. Mo.;
Menard. Texas. The glory of our nation.
Spring break, if we can recall it after the
fact, reminds us of that peculiar phe
nomenon of the "Stanford bubble" — the
self-contained, some might say claustropho
bic. quality our campus maintains. We are a
world unto ourselves, shielded from the
"outside world" and all of its politics and
events. In an almost monastic sense, we give
up this larger awareness to pursue an edu
cation centered in the classroom and the
library. Though we may feel disassociated
and alone on the Stanford island, it
becomes increasingly difficult to put the
books down in order to voice a protest or
simply read a newspaper.
Perhaps this is why there were only 15
students in St. Louis that weekend, or why
the administration chooses to announce
major changes to its housing policies during
Dead Week. We are too self-consumed to
take heed. The bubble takes the blame for
much of our disinterest. We ask ourselves
how we can be expected to balance our lives
inside and outside of the bubble and use the
ivory tower as a justification for our inac

tion and disinterest. As a result, spontaneity
and involvement are qualities sorely lacking
on our campus.
I like the bubble. It contains the most
remarkable community I've been a part of.
As pangs of homesickness set in after a
week on the road, I'm reminded of how spe
cial the bubble really is. I miss the friends 1
have left behind. And there is more night
life in the Tresidder LAIR than all of down
town St. Louis. We have an incredible con
centration of talented and interesting peo
ple who occasionally get too caught up in
their own ambitions to reach beyond the
University.
Perhaps the basketball team should
serve as a model of how to negotiate our
lives within and outside the bubble. The
dedication required to succeed on the court,
tempered with the need to shed those pre
tensions in the occasional dance of sheer
joy, is an apt way to think about our own
varied ambitions. Allowing ourselves to
drop everything, course work and career
ambitions included, might make the bubble
much easier to pass through. We largely
construct such barriers ourselves and they
need not cripple us into believing they are
insurmountable.

David Ball is a senior majoring in English.
He sincerely hopes he did not offend any
one from Boomtown, flayti, Menard, or the
fine slate of Nebraska.
