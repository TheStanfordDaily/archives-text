Welcome to The Rock
This morning, the first classes were held
in the Teaching Center at the Science and
Engineering Qu;id. This facility is a terrific
addition to our campus and will accommo
date countless Stanford students for years to
come. It is a welcome replacement for the
Felix Bloch Auditorium — known to Stan
ford as the lank.
The Tank had character. It was large,
stately and old. with broken desks, an air
conditioner that only worked in the winter
and the only nosebleed seats on campus. Its
odd shape and central location made it a
quirky landmark for students and visitors. It
looked like a water tower — a holding tank
for science and engineering hopefuls — and
it became a part of the Stanford lexicon,
next to MuFuLJnSun and the CoHo.
The new building mav soon develop a
mystique like its predecessor However, in
Ihe long run. a name like "The Teaching

Center at the Science and Engineering
Quad" will just not work. Could you imag
ine it in conversation? "Yea, Jane — I got a
class now at the TCSEQ" or maybe "Fred,
lets stop by the TeaCenSciEnQ, pick up
those handouts, then go get some FroYo."
We need a name for the Tank's successor
that fits its character. The new building is a
monolithic complex, like a federal installa
tion. The monstrous structure is like an
island in a field of sandstone and Spanish
tile. Its asymmetrical, jagged shape stands
out on campus like a huge sliver of granite
shining on the horizon. It's a rock.
The Rock. The name is local, visually
apparent, and accurately portrays an experi
ence relevant to the S(K) freshmen that
spend five hours a week within its walls.
More so, could you just imagine a professor
(Nobel Laureate Prof. Doug Osherhoff
comes to mind) saying on the first day of
physics, in a baritone Sean Connery voice,
"Welcome to the Rock." Just a suggestion

Recall Res Ed protest
During lunch hour on March 17,1 partic
ipated in something that I never thought
would happen at Stanford: a well-attended
impromptu protest denouncing Residential
Education and its unwillingness to listen to
student input.
Why was this event so unlikely? I irst of
all. this is Res Ed. Self-described as
inescapable. Res Ed is the omnipresent
bane of student housing. Every freshman,
from the moment he hears his name called
by smiling dorm staff, gets indoctrinated by
the Res Ed system .
Secondly, it was the middle of Dead
Week. A handful of Stanford students will
happily spare an early-in-the-quarter lunch
hour to protest, but to see so many
protestors in the home stretch of winter
quarter was truly remarkable.
Res Ed has orchestrated a brilliant sys
tem of student deception. Masked by goals
of political correctness. Res Ed truly serves

only one master: risk management.
Consider a house in Res Ed's domain as
an asset if there is a low probability of
mishaps involving the health and safety of
students, and a liability if there is a high
probability of such events. University
cleaned and maintained houses under the
iron-fisted control ol Res Ed are assets. Co
ops, fraternity houses, sorority houses, and
self-owned houses (Sigma Chi and Chi
Theta Chi) are liabilities.
Alpha Sigma is a huge liability, and so
are housed sororities. So Res Ed's most effi
cient action would be to eliminate Alpha Sig
bv fiat and the sororities by offering them
undesirable houses that they can't fill.
As much as I sincerely want to see Delta
Delta Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta suc
ceed in keeping their houses, I suspect that
Res E d has intentionally stacked the chips
against them. To top it all off. the powers
that be took their action just before Dead
Week, thinking that the few students who
care would be swamped with end-of quarter

work. Or they'd just forget what happened
over spring break.
Moreover, in a matter of months. Res Ed
will benefit from one of the many factors
that allows it to continue this relentless plot
ol deception — student turnover. The pow
ers that be magically lose opponents and
gain thousands of supporters. Thus the
vicious cycle will continue.
I share with many students the belief that
Res Ed is a system that operates ostensibly
for the benefit of students without concern
for students' needs. This is a travesty
