# Showering with the boys
## Vanessa Bartsch What I learned at home on spring break 
### 
LAST WEEKEND I convinced my
parents to try Jagermeister. They
didn't like it. So I made my sister fin
ish the bottle.
She didn't like it either. But, then again,
what do you expect from a 10-year-old?
Okay, 1 lie. My sister is 22, hut she still
didn't like it. Regardless, that was probably
the peak of my spring break — living vicar
iously through Mom and Dad.
Why did I return home to New England
for spring break? My friends divided them
selves among the beaches of Hawaii, the
bars of Mexico and the slopes of Tahoe.
But me, I went home to Bolton. Mass. —
(lew from the mid-7()s to just below freezing
in under seven hours. And why?
To seek adventure in a town where, as of
last census, the 3,254 residents were out
numbered 2-to-l by livestock?
To drive by the field where I used to play
Little League and the farm where I rode my
first pony?
To sit around with beer-gutted ex-high
school football stars and reminisce about
those glorious varsity moments?
I don't think so. Such things further
affirmed the maxim, "High school heroes,

real life zeros," and left me feeling a very
old 20.
Watching my town grow from a place of
farms and orchards, where neighbors are
few and far between, to a place of gross yup
pie development actually made me quite
sad. Suburban takeover guerrilla tactics
break my heart.
But this is where I am from. This little
farm town with its eclectic mix of farmer
folk and suit-wearing commuters who still
go to town meetings and argue about the
smell of chickens. This is a place where you
actually sit on the back porch swing and
watch the sunset.
Bolton is a very comfortable place.
I guess I came back to where I am from
to figure out where I am going. Most people
seem to hit this point. It usually happens
around winter when they're scrambling to
make sense of their lives. They end up
choosing one of four resolutions:
a) To suck it up and sell out, cash in their
impressive academic chips for a nice job
that pulls in lots of zeros, a little stability,
and a big office with an espresso maker.
b) To decide to "make a difference" and
head out into the great unknown to fight

Burmese dictators, whale-killers or fourth
graders while their parents cry over the fact
that such noble pursuits earn their children
shacks in Ecuador, apartments in the Ten
derloin and a career that brings in less
money than ;i street mime.
c) To resolve that life takes you wherev
er it pleases, so such worry is all a crock.
After taking at least 30 Seantron tests and
waking up at K a.m. five days a week just to
avoid reading a book for a class you are tak
ing for a DR. you decide to live at home
until your parents boot your butt out.
Or, d) After completely frcakin out in a
panic-stricken, what-am 1-going-to-do
with-my-life, tear/drinking-fest, just draw
straws over choices a. band c. II no straws
are available, default to choice e) grad
school.
Of course, the true Stanford way is to
manage all five. To be totally together,
simultaneously land a lucrative job that
makes a difference and enroll in business
school.
But I am sick of multiple choice.
Still, as I watched my sister spend count
less hours studying for M( A Is and CiREs
at our kitchen table, on which books and

papers she needed for her thesis were
stacked a mile high. I began to feel pres
sured into producing a life plan.
I see my sister diligently pursuing an
MD/Ph.D a well-suited life in academia
that leaves summers open for surfing, and I
wonder what the hell I am doing.
I have no tests to cram for. No real long
term plans. Heck I don't even know what
classes I am taking this quarter.
So I spent hours sitting and thinking of
the things that I once dreamed of doing I
stepped hack into a small-town pace of life,
perfect for reflection.
I enjoyed a week of going for long walks
in the woods and curling up in the sun to
read hooks. I played the piano every
evening and talked late into the night with
family and friends.
I existed quite nicely without alarm
clocks. No papers or tests. No pressure to
compete in a game 1 am not even sure I
want to he playing.
And I realized it was the happiest 1 have
been in months. It is not that I don't value
my education or the enormous amount of
fun I have at Stanford. This is an amazing
place.

And it is not even that I necessarily want
to spend my life in a one-stoplight town that
doesn't even have a grocery store, where
Boh Bahmi's hulls getting loose on the
interstate is the most action the police have
seen in months.
But going hack reminded me that there
are simpler pleasures in life. ()ne can get by
without owning stock or a Beemer.
I didn't set any lofty goals. I didn t make
any major life decisions. For the most part.
1 just slept a lot and ate some really good
food.
But m\ little town reminded me of the
things that make me happy, as simple as
they may be. And even if. instead of a life
plan, all I have are some dreams and a
bunch of crazy ideas, then at least I have
those. That may not pay the bills, but hey.
I'll figure something out — without drawing
straws.

Vanessa Barisch is a junior majoring in
music. And (hough she can't decide on
classes, la ti da ti, she likes to party, she
don 't cause no trouble and she don t bother
