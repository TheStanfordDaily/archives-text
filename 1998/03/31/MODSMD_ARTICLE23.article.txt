### Will Chang 
After 207 physically exhausting
and mentally draining bouts, the
Cardinal fencing squad brought
home a third-place trophy from
Notre Dame in a repeat of last year's
finish at the NCAA championships.
For the fourth consecutive year,
Penn State won the national title
while Notre Dame finished second,
separated from the Nittany Lions by
onlv a one-bout loss.

â–  March 19-21: I 'earn Scores: 1.
Penn State 149, 2. Notre Dame 147,
3. Stanford 128.

The Card began the first day of
competition in first place. Unfortu
nately, Stanford was unable to hold
the lead in the second day of compe
tition as it dropped to second, only
two points behind Notre Dame, and
finally fell behind Penn State by 21
points by the end of the champi
onship.
The competition was held in a
round-robin format with team scor
ing. which meant that each team
earned one point per bout victory.
After the round robin portion, the
top four fencers in each of the
weapons categories (men's foil,
epee, sabre and women's foil and
epee) competed for the individual
national titles in direct elimination
bouts.
Stanford faced many challenges
entering this championship, one of
them being the extremely demand
ing structure of the competition.

"It is very difficult for fencers to
stay focused since each consecutive
win is not followed by a higher cal
iber of competition which most of
our fencers, especially the freshmen,
are used to," said head coach Zoran
Tulum. "What this creates is many
major upsets, which was what hap
pened at the NCAAs. But that focus
is what separates the winners from
the champions."
Senior Sasha Zueker was one of
those able to pull off major upsets.
He defeated the No. 1 sabreman in
the nation, but he also suffered up
sets himself.
While the other schools rested
between bouts and each day of com
petition. the Stanford fencers were
plagued with the stress of studying
and finals, which were administered
bv the coaches. In a sport where the
mental challenge is often compared
to that of chess, the stress of finals
can play a major detrimental factor.
The most difficult handicap the
Card suffered was its lack of a 10th
NCAA qualifier in the men's sabre
squad. That handicap counted
against the Card as an automatic 23
defeats.
"Penn State and Notre Dame
both had 10 qualifiers," said junior
captain Tim ("hang. "We could have
won, but there was absolutely no
room for mistakes, which created a
huge amount of pressure for our
team."
Despite all of these obstacles, the
Card still performed brilliantly.
