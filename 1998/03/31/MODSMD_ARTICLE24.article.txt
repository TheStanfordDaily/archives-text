### Brian Eule Contributing writer 
While yesterday's game with UCLA might not have
been the greatest day tor Stanford, it was Stanford's Day
who saved the game.
The No. 1 Cardinal (25-4-1. 10-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) barely defeated I J( LA (11-21.
5-12), as sophomore right fielder Niek Day nailed a
three- run double to give Stanford the 7-6 victory. Trail
ing 6-3 in the bottom of the ninth with the bases loaded
and one out. Day's line drive missed the glove of
UCLA's diving right fielder, Erie Byrnes. As the Cardi
nal bench erupted onto the field. Day was tackled by a
teammate's bear hug and lifted into the air.
"I've been swinging the bat badly." Day said, w ho hit
into a double play earlier in the game. "I was just happy
1 got another chance. The last thing I wanted to do was
hit into a double play (again) and lose the game."

Leaving eight runners in scoring positions through
the first eight innings at Sunken Diamond. Stanford fell
behind early with three errors in the first two innings.
"It was a good comeback but we didn't play real well
today," said Stanford head coach Mark Marquess. "You
just don't have a good feeling w hen you don't play well
defensively. We obviously left too many guys on base (as
well.) We were just real fortunate to win the game."
Freshman pitcher Justin Wayne came in to relieve Ju
nior Brent Hoard, in the fifth inning, trailing 2-1. After
pitching 2.5 hitless innings. Wayne gave up two solo
homeruns in the eighth inning. The Bruins held onto
their lead through the ninth, but the Cardinal would not
allow the Bruins to defeat it this season.

"It was a freaky thing." Marquess said of the finish.
It's difficult to tell when a squad as strong as Stan
ford's team experiences a slump. Losing two of four
games at the start of spring break, including a loss to No.
20 Washington in which the Cardinal only landed three
hits, might be evidence ol such a struggle. On the other
hand, it might simply serve as a reminder ot w hat a week
away from baseball can do. I ither way, Stanford proved
that it is as strong as ever with its sweep of the Bruins
"We always get geared up to play them, junior sec
ond baseman Tony Schrager said ol I CI A. "We know
if we don't come ready to plav they are going to beat us.
Really, we can't afford to lose any games in the Pac (con
ference) right now."

five games during spring break. Schrager crushed two
homeruns in Stanford's 15-3 victory on Sunday before a
crowd of 2,148
"Anytime you take four or five days off. it's going to
take a couple days to get back in the groove." he said
While the Cardinal may not have been in its normal
hitting grove immediately after finals. Stanford certain
ly performed well on Sunday.
Scoring six runs in the first inning, two in the third,

through the game. With Chad
Hutchinson (5-2) allowing only two
hits in his seven innings on the
mound, Stanford had little trouble
handling the Bruins.
"We hit the ball really well
today," Marquess said. "[Hutchin
son] got his rhythm and pitched very
well. Even though he walked a cou

zone. Then he really settled down
and pitched well."
Among Stanford's 17 hits were
those belonging to junior center
fielder Jody Cierut, who went 2-4 at
the plate, with four RBls. and hit his
team leading 11th homerun of the
season.
"Jody is swinging the bat very
well now," Marquess added. "He's
worked real had over the break and
he's got himself in a real good
groove. That's a good sign for us.
We need him."
Saturday's series opener with
UCLA was not exactly the normal
Stanford slugfest. While the Cardi
nal destroyed the Bruins earlier in
the season by scoring a record 54
runs in the three game series at Jack
ie Robinson Stadium. Stanford
could not produce a multiple run in
ning game on this particular after
noon at Sunken Diamond.
With junior Jeff Austin (8-0) on
the mound, however, it didn't need
to. Pitching a complete game,
Austin allowed just one run as the
Cardinal defeated the Bruins 4-1.
With a ERA of 1.59 in the six-pack,
Austin had nine strikeouts and al

lowed just one walk.
"He works real quick and usually
is riot in too much trouble,"
Schrager said. "It's hard to stay fo
cused (on hitting) when you know
he is only going to give up one or two
runs and that's it. He's done a great
job all year."
The Cardinal began spring break
with a three game non-conference
series against the Huskies at Sunken
Diamond after the team's week off.
After winning the first game 5-4,
Stanford was shut down in a 9-5 loss
to Washington the following day.
Three Husky pitchers combined to
limit the Cardinal to just three hits,
two of which belonged to sopho
more first baseman John Gall, and
Stanford's Hutchinson could not
subdue the Husky hitters. An early
four run rally and three runs scored
in the seventh inning gave Washing
ton the eventual win.
Although it took 10 innings,
Stanford came back to defeat Wash
ington in the third game of the se
ries, 4-3.
Freshman designated hitter Joe
Borchard, who led the team with his
.400 batting average at the time,
belted a three run homer to tie the
game in the eighth inning, and had
the game winning RBI with his sin
gle to left field in the tenth.
Stanford dropped another non
conference game to University of
Nevada at Rent) on March 26. Scor
ing all of its runs in the final three in
nings, the Wolfpack defeated the
Cardinal 13-5.
"Sometimes it's hard to get a hit,
other times it just flows," Marquess
said. " I think that's just the game of
baseball."
