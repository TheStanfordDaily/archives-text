While yesterday's game with UCLA might not have
been the greatest day tor Stanford, it was Stanford's Day
who saved the game.
The No. 1 Cardinal (25-4-1. 10-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division) barely defeated I J( LA (11-21.
5-12), as sophomore right fielder Niek Day nailed a
three- run double to give Stanford the 7-6 victory. Trail
ing 6-3 in the bottom of the ninth with the bases loaded
and one out. Day's line drive missed the glove of
UCLA's diving right fielder, Erie Byrnes. As the Cardi
nal bench erupted onto the field. Day was tackled by a
teammate's bear hug and lifted into the air.
"I've been swinging the bat badly." Day said, w ho hit
into a double play earlier in the game. "I was just happy
1 got another chance. The last thing I wanted to do was
hit into a double play (again) and lose the game."

Leaving eight runners in scoring positions through
the first eight innings at Sunken Diamond. Stanford fell
behind early with three errors in the first two innings.
"It was a good comeback but we didn't play real well
today," said Stanford head coach Mark Marquess. "You
just don't have a good feeling w hen you don't play well
defensively. We obviously left too many guys on base (as
well.) We were just real fortunate to win the game."
Freshman pitcher Justin Wayne came in to relieve Ju
nior Brent Hoard, in the fifth inning, trailing 2-1. After
pitching 2.5 hitless innings. Wayne gave up two solo
homeruns in the eighth inning. The Bruins held onto
their lead through the ninth, but the Cardinal would not
allow the Bruins to defeat it this season.

"It was a freaky thing." Marquess said of the finish.
It's difficult to tell when a squad as strong as Stan
ford's team experiences a slump. Losing two of four
games at the start of spring break, including a loss to No.
20 Washington in which the Cardinal only landed three
hits, might be evidence ol such a struggle. On the other
hand, it might simply serve as a reminder ot w hat a week
away from baseball can do. I ither way, Stanford proved
that it is as strong as ever with its sweep of the Bruins
"We always get geared up to play them, junior sec
ond baseman Tony Schrager said ol I CI A. "We know
if we don't come ready to plav they are going to beat us.
Really, we can't afford to lose any games in the Pac (con
ference) right now."
After getting just three hits in the Cardinal's previous
five games during spring break. Schrager crushed two
homeruns in Stanford's 15-3 victory on Sunday before a
crowd of 2,148
"Anytime you take four or five days off. it's going to
take a couple days to get back in the groove." he said
While the Cardinal may not have been in its normal
hitting grove immediately after finals. Stanford certain
ly performed well on Sunday.
Scoring six runs in the first inning, two in the third,
and six in the fifth put the Cardinal on top 14-0 midwa)
