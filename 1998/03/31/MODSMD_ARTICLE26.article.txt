Sports fans, take note. Fhe women's gymnastics
team has done what no other women's gymnastics
team in Stanford or conference- history has done be
fore.
With the men's basketball team making it to the
Final Four and the men's and women's swim teams
both winning national championships, it is easy lor the
llth-ranked women's gymnastics team to be over
shadowed.

Junior Katie Fitzpatrick performs her bar routine earlier this season against Cal At the Pac-10 cham
pionships. Fontaine's stellar performances helped her team take the title for the first time in the pro
gram s existence.
Stanford led the meet with a
score of 195.25, followed bv Oregon
State (194.950), Arizona (194.900)
and coming in fourth place, defend
ing national champion UCLA
(194.700).
"We are proud to have done this
for Stanford," said rookie head
coach Mark Cook. "We are making
our mark and showing everyone we
are going to he a constant force."
The win was particularly sweet
for Cook, who was formerly an assis
tant coach at UCLA. He was instru
mental when the Bruins won the na
tional championship last year, but he
vfcas more than happy to return to
Pauley Pavilion and bring home a
win for the Cardinal.
"I love to win," Cook said. "I'm
proud of the girls and honored that
we competed and won in an arena full
of such line gymnasts and coaches."
Although the win would be con
sidered an upset by some, the squad
has consistently improved through
out the season, culminating in its win

over third-ranked Utah March 6.
The title was definitely a team ef
fort, but it was highlighted by the
performances of senior co-captain
Keri Monahan and sophomore
Larissa Fontaine.
Monahan tied with Fontaine forii
third-place finish on vault with a
score of 9.875. Earlier in the week,
Monahan was recognized for her
performance against Utah when she
was named Pac-10 Gymnast of the
Week. Fontaine also grabbed sec
ond place on the uneven bars with a
score of 9.925.
Cook attributes part of the team's
success to its relaxed demeanor. The
theme of the meet was disco, and ac
cording to Cook, the squad went
crazy and was fully into it.
"Thegirls really took an opportu
nity to enjoy themselves," Cook
said. "It helped us to stay loose and
as a result, perform better routines."
Things went well from the get-go
with the squad opening on beam. Al
though this event has traditionally
been the squad's weakest, it hit six of
six sets, even with a last minute
change to put senior Amy Neil into
the lineup. It was the squad's

strongest showing on beam this year,
and it set a strong foundation for the
rest of the meet.
The floor exercise was next, and
the squad had some rough routines,
falling once and going out of bounds
a couple of times. The gymnasts
weren't going to let it bother them,
however, and they came back strong
on vault.
"This was our best vault of the
season. We had some big vaults and
stuck our landings," Cook said.
The Cardinal led after three
events, but the meet was far from
over. The women rocked their bar
routines and as final gymnast
Fontaine dismounted, the team col
lapsed on her and started screaming.
"Everyone did really well,"
Fontaine said. "We were having so
much fun, and we didn't concentrate
on anyone else. When we found out
we won, we were so happy. Finals
were over, the meet was done, and
we had all performed well."
The meet was solid but definitely
not Stanford's best showing. This is
encouraging, since the team is still
on a peaking cycle in order to gear
up for regionals Saturday.
