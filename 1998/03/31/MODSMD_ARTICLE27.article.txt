Junior third baseman Shane An

that was slow, and we did not adjust.
It was a good day in that we didn't
play our best but got two victories."
It was also a good day in that the-
Card followed up its losses to Wash
ington (2-1 and 3-0) with two confer
ence wins. The Huskies got things
going in the bottom of the second as
junior Jeanine Giordano singled in
junior Becky Newbry for the first
run of the game.
But the Card answered the very
next inning with a pair of singles
from freshman left fielder Ramona
Shelburne and sophomore catcher
Kellie Wiginton. Foyle then laid the
sacrifice bunt to score Shelburne and
tie the game. But Washington would
not be turned away as sophomore
pitcher Jennifer Spediacci drove in
the game winner in the fourth.
"We just missed tying the game,"
Crouch said. "Michelle Schneider
hit a ball that hit the top of the fence.
The luck went their way in the first
game. It's tough when luck doesn't
go your way, but that's what hap
pened. We were right there in it both
games."
Washington struck quickly in
game two, scoring two runs in the
first inning. The Card was able to
record hits in the final three innings,
but could never mount a rally for a
run.
Prior i > this weekend. Stanford
took six of six games at home. The
Cardinal I irst got things going with 2-
0 and 3-2 wins over then-No. 23
Texas lech March 21. After a 45-
minute rain delay, Blevins went to
work on a two-hit complete game
shutout, allowing only one baserun
ner over the final four innings and
recording her 10th win of the season.
The ( aril scored a run in the first
inning when Wiginton scored from
third on a passed ball But Stanford
did not strike again until the bottom
of the sixth. Junior shortstop
Michelle Schneider tripled and then
crossed the plate on a single by

Acosta tor the final score of the
game.
The Lady Raiders jumped out to
a 2-0 lead in the first inning of the
nightcap and held the lead behind
the pitching of Emily Hayes, who
was responsible for Texas Tech's
win over No. 1 Arizona earlier this
season.
But Stanford edged back into the
game with one run in the fourth on
another RBI single from Acosta.
Then the Card completed the come
back in the bottom of the sixth on an
RBI single from Crouch and a
grounder from freshman first base
man Jenni Shidlcr that scored
Schneider.
"Our coach always says, we're
going to come back and get them,' "
Crouch said. "He would say the
same thing last year, and we would
never come back and win. This time
we put some pressure on them.
We're finally getting some cluteh
hits."
Stanford then extended its win
streak to 11 with victories over Har
vard and Kansas in back-to-back
double-headers March 24-25. H.ir
vard was demolished easily. f>-0 and
KM) (in five innings).
Stanford pounded the Crimson
for 12 hits in the opener with Schnei
der, Crouch. Acosta and Shidler all
recording multiple hits. But the story
of the game was the pitching ot
Blevins. who only allowed two Har
vard batters to reach base.
Blevins gave perhaps the best
performance of her career, striking
out six. walking two and recording
the second no-hitter of her career
(the second in the history of the pro
gram). The only time the no-hitter
was in question was in the sixth when
junior center fielder Kelly YaMonski
had to make a diving catch to rob a
hit from the Crimson
"She had them so fooled,"
Crouch said of Blevins' perfor
mance. "They couldn't touch the ball
against her. They never even came
close to threatening: she was in com
plete control."
Game two was more of the same
as the Card capitalized on six hits and
three Crimson errors to take the
game on the l()-run mercy rule in five
innings. Senior Jessica Schulman got
her first start of the season on the
mound and gave up only one hit.
Crouch and Shidler led the way at
the plate with three RBIs apiece.

Stanford followed that up with a
4-0 win over Kansas and then a 10-in
ning one-run thriller that the Card
took 4-3. In the first game Blevins
was again untouchable. She struck
out six and scattered just four hits
over seven innings en route to her
fourth shutout of the season. Two
Stanford singles and two Jayhawks
errors helped guide the Card to a
four-run fourth inning and put the
game out of reach. Stanford only got
three hits in the game but made the
most of its opportunity in the fourth.
The Card jumped out to a 1 -Olead
in the second inning of the closer, but
Kansas came back to tie it two in
nings later. One more from each

squad sent the game into extra in
nings tied up 2-2.
In the 10th. the game went into in
ternational tiebreak rules, which
places a runner on second base to
start the inning. Kansas vsas able to
score Katie Malone on a single from
Sara Holland to give the Jayhawks
their first lead of the game. But in the
bottom of the l()th. Stanford rallied
for two runs to pick up the 4-3 win.
"There wasn't any doubt in our
minds that we were going to win."
Acosta said. "It was a real team ef

about after the game. Team effort
that's the way to describe that

game.
The Lady Raiders jumped out to
a 2-0 lead in the first inning of the
nightcap and held the lead behind
the pitching of Emily Hayes, who
was responsible for Texas Tech's
win over No. 1 Arizona earlier this
season.
But Stanford edged back into the
game with one run in the fourth on
another RBI single from Acosta.
Then the Card completed the come
back in the bottom of the sixth on an
RBI single from Crouch and a
grounder from freshman first base
man Jenni Shidlcr that scored
Schneider.
"Our coach always says, we're
going to come back and get them,' "
Crouch said. "He would say the
same thing last year, and we would
never come back and win. This time
we put some pressure on them.
We're finally getting some cluteh
hits."
Stanford then extended its win
streak to 11 with victories over Har
vard and Kansas in back-to-back
double-headers March 24-25. H.ir
vard was demolished easily. f>-0 and
KM) (in five innings).
Stanford pounded the Crimson
for 12 hits in the opener with Schnei
der, Crouch. Acosta and Shidler all
recording multiple hits. But the story
of the game was the pitching ot
Blevins. who only allowed two Har
vard batters to reach base.
Blevins gave perhaps the best
performance of her career, striking
out six. walking two and recording
the second no-hitter of her career
(the second in the history of the pro
gram). The only time the no-hitter
was in question was in the sixth when
junior center fielder Kelly YaMonski
had to make a diving catch to rob a
hit from the Crimson
"She had them so fooled,"
Crouch said of Blevins' perfor
mance. "They couldn't touch the ball
against her. They never even came
close to threatening: she was in com
plete control."
Game two was more of the same
as the Card capitalized on six hits and
three Crimson errors to take the
game on the l()-run mercy rule in five
innings. Senior Jessica Schulman got
her first start of the season on the
mound and gave up only one hit.
Crouch and Shidler led the way at
the plate with three RBIs apiece.

Stanford followed that up with a
4-0 win over Kansas and then a 10-in
ning one-run thriller that the Card
took 4-3. In the first game Blevins
was again untouchable. She struck
out six and scattered just four hits
over seven innings en route to her
fourth shutout of the season. Two
Stanford singles and two Jayhawks
errors helped guide the Card to a
four-run fourth inning and put the
game out of reach. Stanford only got
three hits in the game but made the
most of its opportunity in the fourth.
The Card jumped out to a 1 -Olead
in the second inning of the closer, but
Kansas came back to tie it two in
nings later. One more from each

squad sent the game into extra in
nings tied up 2-2.
In the 10th. the game went into in
ternational tiebreak rules, which
places a runner on second base to
start the inning. Kansas vsas able to
score Katie Malone on a single from
Sara Holland to give the Jayhawks
their first lead of the game. But in the
bottom of the l()th. Stanford rallied
for two runs to pick up the 4-3 win.
"There wasn't any doubt in our
minds that we were going to win."
Acosta said. "It was a real team ef
fort. That's what we were talking
about after the game. Team effort
that's the way to describe that
game."

"I thought it was a really awe

er Michelle Acosla. "I think as a
team we have so much confidence

game knowing we're going to win I
think that's the attitude we try to

sacrifice bunt to score Shelburne and
tie the game. But Washington would
not be turned away as sophomore
pitcher Jennifer Spediacci drove in
the game winner in the fourth.
"We just missed tying the game,"
Crouch said. "Michelle Schneider
hit a ball that hit the top of the fence.
The luck went their way in the first
game. It's tough when luck doesn't
