Junior Geoff Abrams played at

play sixth singles, beating Jeff Har
bach 6-2,7-5.
Stanford had no trouble earning
the doubles point with the Bryans,
Goldstein and Wolters and Abrams
and senior Charles Hoeveler, drop
ping only five games combined.
The tougher matches for Stan
ford's team came against Arizona
and Arizona State in the desert. With
difficult weather and travel condi
tions, Gould said he was very pleased
with the way the team performed.
Stanford blew Arizona away 7-0,
despite the traveling and weather
conditions.
Wolters again took charge at the
No. 1 spot, winning 6-0. 6-4 against
Roland kupka. and Goldstein had a
standard two-set win against Jerome
Oliveri 6-4,6-4. Mike Bryan and Kim
cleaned up against their Arizona op
ponents in straight sets, and Abrams
had a quiek win over Adnan Novo, 6-
3,6-0.
Again, with Bob Bryan taking a
day off. Gould put in another Stan
ford player for more match experi
ence. Hoeveler struggled and lost the
first set against Arizona's Mike Huss
but came back to win 6-4. 6-4 in the
last two sets.
Stanford came away with all six
singles wins, as well as the doubles
point. The Bryans, Goldstein and
Wolters, and Abrams and Kim all
had quick wins over their Arizona
opponents.

Stanford's biggest challenge of
the weekend came against Arizona
State on Saturday. Battling high alti
tude and what Gould called the
"worst conditions I've ever seen."
the Cardinal dropped the doubles
point against ASU.
Mike and Bob Bryan had an easy
8-2 win over Ed Carter and I'im
Hammond of ASU, but the other
two doubles teams struggled against
their opponents. Goldstein and
Wolters lost to Gustavo Marcaccio
and Alex Osterrieth 8-6, while Peter
Dani and Casey Was defeated
Abrams and Hoeveler 8-6.
(ioldstein said he was disappoint
ed that Stanford dropped the dou
bles point, but was pleased to have
won the overall match.
"It's hard to go an entire season
without losing a single doubles
point," Goldstein said. "In retro
spect. it's not that disappointing, but
the players who lost could have
played a little better to pull out the
win."
Even having lost its first doubles
point of the season, Gould said the
team did an excellent job of coming
back to win the singles matches.
"They rebounded so well even
with the terrible weather condi
tions." Gould said. "It was a great ef
fort under trying conditions."
Gould said Wolters, playing again
at the first spot, played very well in a
tough match against Marcaccio.
Wolters emerged the victor in the 6-
2,6-2 match.
"This weekend was Ryan's
chance to play No. 1," Gould said.
"He did a superb job."
Playing with a full lineup against
Arizona State, Stanford cleaned up
in singles. Goldstein had an easy vic
tory against Osterrieth (6-0, 6-2),
while Bob Bryan, back in the lineup
at third singles, won easily over
Carter, 6-1, 6-1. Mike Bryan. Kim
and Abrams all had straight set victo
ries over their opponents for a 6-1
win over Arizona State.
"This win gives us good momen
tum going into this weekend," Gould
said.
Even though Stanford's record
has been spectacular, helping it keep
its top ranking, Goldstein said the
rankings are not terribly important.
"We just compete one match at a
time and play the best tennis we can,"
Goldstein said. "At the end of May, it
doesn't really matter what our rank
ing is going into the NCAA's."
With only three weeks and eight
matches of dual-match competition
left in the season, Gould said he is
very happy with the team's outlook.
"We're good." Gould said/"NiM
only are we good, but we just'bvSnc
teams out. I've never to this point had
a team dominate like this year's team
has dominated. I'm really proud of
them.
" The scariest part of all this is that
we're not even near as good as we're
going to be as a team by the end of
May. This could be just a tremendous
season."
