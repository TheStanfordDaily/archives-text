### Brie MacDonald Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's water polo team se
cured its No. 2 national ranking over spring
break by winning four out of its five games. The
( ard (14-3,5-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) defeated UC-Santa Barbara, San Jose
State, Long Beach State and San Diego State
and dropped one game to top-ranked UCLA.
Stanford traveled south over the March 14th
weekend and faced the Bruins. After one quar
ter of play, the score was 3-1 UCLA. The Card
couldn't capitalize on its scoring opportunities,
and the UCLA offense was on fire.
"In the first quarter, we played pretty well,
but we didn't have much to show for it," said
head coach John Tanner. "UCLA's shooting
was almost flawless, and after the first quarter
they got off to a big lead."
Junior goal-keeper Heather Crary's seven
saves weren't enough to stop the Bruins. UCLA
had seven players contribute to its 11-goal total.
Stanford ended the match with three goals, two
from sophomore hole-set Ellen Estes and one

from freshman Anne-Marie Keenan.
In spite of the loss to UCLA, Stanford came
out strong in its game against Santa Barbara the
following day.
"Our defense was great" Tanner said. "They

didn't have any real scoring threats. We played
soundly and we frustrated them."
The Stanford defense was so strong, in fact,
that it shut out the Gauchos until the last quarter
of play. Stanford's goals were divided between
Keenan, who scored two, and Estes, sophomore
Suze Gardner and freshman Kris Koblik who
each scored one.
After finals, the Stanford women remained

on campus to practice and prepare lor their next
match against San Jose State, Long Beach and
San Diego State.
On March 21, the Card shut out the Spartans
11-0. And those 11 goals were split between 10
different players.
Stanford then faced Long Beach Friday, and
the Card came away with a 19-2 victory. The
Card's goals were again spread out within the
team — this time 12 players shared the points
with Estes and freshman Dani Bell leading the
team with three goals apiece.
The Cardinal's final match was against San
Diego State Saturday. This was the first meeting
between the two teams since the 1997 Nationals,
when Stanford lost to San Diego State in triple
overtime in the third place match. This time it
was the Card that came away with the win. de
feating the Aztecs 13-6.
"It was sweet," said junior captain Lindsay
Tam. "They came out hoping for the same
matchup as last time. They were surprised."
Stanford was led in scoring by Estes and Gar
ner, who each scored four goals. On defense,
Crary tallied seven saves for the Card.
Overall, it was a successful round of games
for the team, and Tanner is optimistic about the
rest of the season.
"Our counterattack has improved," Tam
said. "It makes the other teams tentative and
broadens our attack when we have so many dif
ferent players scoring."
The Cardinal women can look forward to
some changes in their training this week as the
team shifts from its midseason to postseason
focus, according to Tanner.
"We're really in transition. Our focus is on
the end of the year and not on each one of these
matches," Tanner said. "This is the last week of
the regular season, so we're going to start work
ing on more sprinting and speed work."
Now that the team has ousted California
from the No. 2 spot, Stanford must focus on con
tinuing to improve its offensive attack and main
taining its solid defense.
"We have a lot more anticipation now," said
Tanner. "We've been keeping our opponents
off-balance through our team approach to the
game. We've been creating scoring opportuni
ties for everyone."
