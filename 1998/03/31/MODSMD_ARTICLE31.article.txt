In the past three weeks, the Car
dinal has posted a somewhat dis
couraging record of 2-3, with victo
ries over UC-Irvine and UCLA
and losses to Penn State and
Hawaii.
The Cardinal (12-6, 11-5 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
started off Dead Week rather un
expectedly, with a loss to Penn
State, 8-15,14-16,15-13,14-16. who
at match time, was unranked with
just an 8-11 record.
Senior middle blocker Keenan
Whitehurst struggled offensively
early in the match, but finished
with 14 kills, while sophomore out
side hitter Andy Witt struggled
throughout the match.
Senior middle blocker Tad
Hoffman led the Cardinal attack
with a match-high hitting percent
age of .639 (25-2-36) and nine
blocks and a team-high 25 kills.
"Hoffman, more than anyone,
picked up the slack in both our hit
ting and blocking," said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves.
The Cardinal bounced back
three duysJatqr with a decisive vic
tory over then-15th-ranked Irvine
(9-7). Stanford finished off the
Anteaters 15-1. 15-8. 15-7 in a sea
son-low time of 1:07.
All five Cardinal starting hitters
posted hitting percentages over
.563 as the team posted a season
high .654. committing just six hit
ting errors. Senior swing hitter
Devin Poolman posted a match-

high 21 kills, while Witt posted his
season-high hitting percentage of
.737 (16-2-19). Hoffman and
Whitehurst both had near-perfect
offensive evenings, hitting .857 and
.818. respectively. Hoffman had six
kills on seven attacks, while White
hurst had nine kills on 11 attacks,
both hitters without any errors.
The Cardinal followed up its
victory over Irvine with a match
against top-ranked UCLA (20-3,
13-2 MPSF) the following evening.
In a rematch of last year's national
championship, the Cardinal again
proved to be ten) much for UCLA,
sweeping the top-ranked Bruins
15-11, 15-12. 15-9. Stanford was
considered an underdog in the
match, and it was not expected to
win. let alone win so decisively. The
victory is the strongest and most
encouraging one of the Cardinal's
season to date.
The Cardinal fell behind early.
2-8, in game one. before scoring
nine unanswered points to finish it
off.
"We struggled with UCLA's
jump serve." Hoffman said. "Then
we got into a side out rhythm."
Down 2-3 in the second game,
Poolman served three straight aces
to give Stanford the lead for good.
Stanford opened the final game
of the match to a 2-6 deficit, but
again came back strong. The C ardi
nal took leads at 7-6 and 8-7 before
going on a 7-2 run to finish the
match.
"Even though we lost to un
ranked Penn State, we felt much
better after the Irvine and UCLA
matches," Nieves said.
The Cardinal took a week off of
practice for finals week, resumed
practice Friday night and defeated
Sacramento State in a scrimmage
Saturday. Although the Cardinal
was victorious, the match was a
hint of what was to come. Stan
ford's first team split the first two
games of the match. Nieves fol
lowed through with hi* pre-game
plan lo play his second team after
the first two games.
"While the first team strug
gled." Nieves commented, "the
second team won games three and
four decisively."
The team left for Honolulu the
following day for a two-game series
with fifth-ranked Hawaii the next
weekend. Thursday's practice in

Hawaii was somewhat disappoint
ing. with the second team again
outplaying the first. The Rainbows
thoroughly defeated the Cardinal
in both matches, 8-15. 1-15. 7-15
Friday and 5-15. 5-15. 15-17 Satur
day.
The start ol match one did not
give much indication of what the
remainder of the match would be
like. The score remained close until
7-9. when Hawaii went on a run.
scoring 21 of the next 23 points to
close out both games one and t\so.
At 4-1 in game two, Hawaii sopho
more middle blocker Andre
Breuer took to the service line and
continued until a kill b\ sopho
more outside hitter Josh Palacios
stopped the run. after Breuer had
served eight consecutive points.
Stanford hoped to bounce back
quickly for the following night's
match.
"When two teams have similar

abilities." Nieves said, "there's no
reason there cannot be a different
result."
Unfortunately, the Cardinal
turned the match into a continua
tion of the previous one. After los
ing the first two games. Nieves de
cided to take out his starters, with
the exception of W hitehurst. and
put in the second team that had
been pla\ ing so competitiveh
It worked.
Stanford led the Rainbows for
most of the game and nearl> won
the third game I*u unfortunate
Cardinal errors at 15-15 gave
Hawaii the match.
"For the first time all weekend,
we had Hawaii rattled." Nieves
said.
Junior outside hitter Patrick
Klein posted a match-high 21 kills,
with 19 of them in that final game.
