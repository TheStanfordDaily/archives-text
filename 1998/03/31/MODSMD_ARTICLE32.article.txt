Although the 199K men's gym
nastics season is not memorable in
tangible terms — no championship
trophies came the Cardinal's way
it built a stable foundation for poten
tial future trophies.

■ March 21: Pac-10 Championships:
1. California (229.050) 2. Nebraska
(227.850) 112). Stanford (219.025)
The season came to an early,
rather sudden close last weekend at
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion championship at Maples Pavil
ion. While the team posted a re
spectable score of 219.025, the Car
dinal's formidable competition kept
it lingering in sixth place out of eight
teams.
Going into the MPSF champi
onship, the Cardinal was ranked
eighth in the West region. In order to
qualify for the NCAA Regionals,

the C 'ardinal needed to climb to sixth
in the region. Accomplishing this
task meant outscoring Air Force by
six points while also posting a score
above 223.
The Cardinal easily overcame the
Air Force Falcons but fell short of
223 points, so this weekend marked
the end of the team's season. While
the team as a whole did not qualify
to move on to regionals, a few indi
viduals were still able to qualify with
either high all-around scores or high
event scores. Those who qualified
will be named today.
The Cardinal knew that the
MPSF championship was a do or
die competition.
"This weekend was our chance to
push all of our injuries aside and
focus on having a solid competition
from start to finish." said senior
Gabe Edelman. "We started off re
ally well, but by the third event peo
ple were making mistakes and get
ting frustrated. From then on it just
got worse."
Thus, the Cardinal finished sixth,
behind Oklahoma (224.075). New

Mexico (224 775). Hrigham Young
(225.95), Nebraska (227.K5) and
MPSf- champion California
(229.05). Only Air Force (212.15)
and l'(-Santa Barbara (210.30)
trailed the ( ardinal.
The individual competition on
Saturday night was dominated by
other universities, but Stanford en
joyed a lew moments. Senior co-cap
tain Clarence Miao, a 1996 NCAA
All-American still recovering from
an arm injury, managed to place
sixth in both the floor exercise and
the vault.
Senior co-captain Jeremy Her
man. an All-American on the pom
mel horse in 1996, placed fifth on the
event in the competition.
New Mexico's Lateef Crowder
earned the all-around title while Ne
braska's Marshall Nelson was
crowned athlete of the year. Mako
Sakamoto, coach of the Brigham
Young Cougars, and C'al's Barry
Weiner were awarded coach of the
year honors.
The Cardinal may have been fair
ly absent from the awards podium.

hut it can smile looking back on the
season.
"We could have made a few less
mistakes and probably made it to the
regionals." Herman said. "But given
all the injuries, I think we did fairly
decent this season."
"We had a very tough season."
Edelman said. "With all the injuries,
we knew it was going to he an uphill
battle the whole way. We tried to re
main focused on our goal of nation
als. but sometimes you have to settle
for a little less."
It was a rough season, hut a
promising one for the future. The
freshmen this year developed lead
ership skills and the ability to perse
vere through difficulties such as in
jury. These skills should serve them
well over the next three years.
" This was a very young and tal
ented team." said Edelman. "I
wouldn't be surprised if Stanford be
came the team to beat next year."
With several top recruits coming
to the Farm next year, the team
should regain its championship glory
of past seasons.
