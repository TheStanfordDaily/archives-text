# Power outage hits Row during finals
## 
### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
Students joked that the power
failure that affected a number of
houses on the Row and parts of the
faculty ghetto during finals week was
part of an evil annual plot to stop res
idents from studying.
The power in these houses, which
is controlled by a PCI&E switch
board unlike the rest of campus, went
out for a period of about 12 hours on
March 15 and 16. Most of the campus
gets its power from the Cardinal Co
generation Facility.
A similar outage hit during finals
week of fall quarter in 1995: that
time, the power was not restored for
three days. PG&E could not be
reached for comment about the
source of this outage â€” the second
during winter quarter.
It was annoying because there
was no way to find out any informa

tion when power would be back on,"
said Slavianskii Dom resident com
puter coordinator 'Alim Beveridge.
a junior.
The power faltered and went on
and off between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Sunday, when it went off altogether.
Students commented that the
outage was especially inconvenient
because of their inability to use com
puters and to study in their rooms.
Many students spent the night in the
24-hour study room because power
was not restored until 4 a.m. Mon
day.
At Durand. students also said
they were affected because they
could not use the kitchen. Afraid that
food would spoil, they did not open
the refrigerators or freezers and in
stead concocted a "frontier dinner"
of pasta and Stove Top stuffing.
"It sucked." said junior Dan
Maidenberg. the kitchen manager at
Durand.
