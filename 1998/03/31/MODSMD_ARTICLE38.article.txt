# Graduate Fellowship Program earns high marks from students and faculty
## 
### Bill Hanson Contributing writer 
Stanford's Graduate Fellowship Program have
been in place for two quarters now, and students,
faculty and administrators remain excited about
the program.
"It's going great," said Tom Wasow, associate
dean of research for graduate policy, "but it's too
early to really determine exactly how well things
are going."
The program, in large part made possible by the
efforts and vision of University President Gerhard
Casper, is the nation's largest in science and engi
neering that does not depend on federal funds.
The program provides each fellow with three
years of tuition plus an annual stipend of $16,(XX)
with no strings attached and no requirement that
the recipient teach to earn a living or choose a pro
fessor as a mentor based on the availability of
grant money. Most of the 122 fellows are in the en
gineering or life sciences departments although a
few social science students receive funding as well.
Officially launched last April, the Stanford
Graduate Fellowship program has three primary
goals. The first was to attract the world's best and
brightest students to Stanford. Although Stanford
has a tradition of attracting such students, compet
ing universities — as well as a hot job market in in
dustry— have appealed to prospective students in

recent years.
"The yield has been better than expected,"
Wasow said.
Robert Simoni, a biology professor and co
chair of the committee on graduate admissions for
the biological sciences and the Medieal School,
shared Wasow's enthusiasm.
"In terms of attracting the best students to Stan
ford, this goal has clearly been met," Simoni said.
"This program has given the biggest boost in
morale to the faculty in the 25 years I've been
here."
The second goal of the program was to reduce
Stanford's reliance on federal support for fund
ing. About $125 million of the $2(X) million in
tended for the program has already been raised,
and the sources for such funding are various en
dowments. Corporations such as Cisco Systems
and Chevron Corp. view these donations as "an
investment in the economic future of Silicon Val
ley," according to John Morgridge, chairman of
the board of Cisco Systems.
The third goal of the program was to allow stu
dents autonomy in their research. With the no
strings-attached stipend, fellows are able to devel
op their own projects and are not confined to the
support of one laboratory or one professor.
"We've given students the freedom to shop
around a little," Wasow said. "The funding is in
ternal, and the students aren't restricted bv the na

ture of the grant."
Some administrators and faculty are still uncer
tain as to whether the fellows can handle the au
tonomy and creativity fostered by the programs.
Only time will tell whether students are able to
achieve more with greater independence.
The fellows themselves, of course, relish this as
pect of the program.
"I'm not constrained," said Jessica Ruvinsky, a
fellow in biology, who noted that her department
generally allows freedom for all students. "I'm in a
lucky position. I have the freedom to work be
tween labs."
Because one of the primary goals of the pro
gram was to reduce Stanford's dependence on fed
eral support, the humanities and, to a lesser extent,
the social sciences are excluded from the program,
as they have not traditionally enjoyed such sup
port as extensively as engineering or life sciences
departments.
The humanities and social sciences have, how
ever, enjoyed some internal University funding for
quite some time — more than that given to the en
gineering and life science departments prior to the
program.
"Humanities rightfully complains about not
having enough funding," Simoni said, "but this
graduate fellowship program is not really related
to their complaints. It was developed to reduce
federal dependence."
