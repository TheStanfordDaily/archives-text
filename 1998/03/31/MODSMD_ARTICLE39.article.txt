Memorial services were held at
San Francisco's Grace Cathedral
Saturday for Oscar F. Nelson Jr.. a
longtime employee of the Stanford
Planning Office.
Nelson died Feb. 28 of complica
tions of asthma at his home in San
Francisco. He was 85.
Nelson joined the Planning Of
fice in 1955 when it was one of the
first offices of its kind in the nation
and only had a staff of three. He re
tired from his position in 1982.
He served as executive secretary
for the Committee on Lands, Build
ings and Development, an advisory
committee to the president on all
matters of buildings and grounds.
While at Stanford, Nelson was re

sponsible for many aspects of plan
ning for the campus; he is credited
with developing standards of confor
mity for signage, street furniture,
off-street parking and campus light
ing.
"Oscar Nelson's contribution to
the design of the Stanford campus
and, in fact, all components of Stan
ford lands was enormous, and his tal
ent and ability were respected by the
administration, the faculty, and, yes,
much of the student body of the era
when he served as master planner."
said Harry Sanders, director emeri
tus of planning. Sanders worked
closely with Nelson from 1956 to
1976.
According to Sanders. Nelson
had a great talent for campus plan
ning and landscape in general, espe
cially for specifics such as color cod-

ing. lighting and paving materials.
It was Nelson who first realized
that the 50-foot-high light poles
being installed everywhere in the
1950s were out of scale on campus.
He began to adopt smaller, deco
rative light standards that were
being discarded by other communi
ties throughout the nation. Nelson
was key in getting San Jose to do
nate several dozen light fixtures re
moved from a residential neighbor
hood.
According to Gene Kershner. as
sociate director of the Planning Of
fice from 1968 to 1991, Nelson felt
that the smaller light fixtures would
be on a more human scale and more
attractive for the campus.
Nelson alone was responsible for
the acquisition and installation of
these fixtures around campus, Ker-

shner said.
These light fixtures formed the
nucleus for the University's lighting
standards and can be seen today
throughout the campus.
Kershner described Nelson as a
wise, precise and sophisticated
member of the Stanford community.
Nelson was born in Omaha, Neb.,
and attended the University of Ne
braska. He received his training and
degree in landscape architecture at
IJSC, later serving in the Signal
Corps of the U.S. Army during
World War 11.
Nelson is survived by a son and
daughter-in-law. Terence and
Eileen Nelson; a daughter and son
in-law. Molly and Michael Brennan;
four grandchildren and four great
grandchildren. All live in the Seattle
area.
