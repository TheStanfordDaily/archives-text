# Stanford refinances $90 million in loans
## 
### Theresa Vargas Contributing writer 
The University could save up to $17 mil
lion over the next 32 years due to a recent re
financing of $90 million of its debt.
In lysy. Stanford sold $W million in
bonds at a 7.2 percent interest rate. Working
with the California Educational Facilities
Authority, the University recently bought
back the bonds and resold them at a 5.43 per
cent interest rate, which will lead to estimat
ed savings of several million dollars.
"We essentially brokered the deal." said
Yier Shi, a spokesman for State Treasurer
Matt Fong. who heads the CEFA. He added
that Stanford picked a prime time to take ad
vantage of the interest rate.
"Maybe in five or so years, it might go
down again and then Stanford can refinance
again." he said. "Hut mavbe it will go back up
and then Stanford will have gotten a great
deal."

Stanford finan
cial Analy sis and Planning
Director Brian Sandquist
said his office is extremely
proud to have landed such
a deal for the I University.
"This will help the
I niversity save money
and help us to better af
ford capital improvements

to the infrastructure of the I niversity.
Sandquist said. "Essentially this will help
keep all other costs down."
While most of the proceeds 112 rom the orig
inal million bond sales went toward re
pairs needed after the IM.S9 Loma Prieta
Earthquake, the rest is being spent on infra
structural repairs and remodeling.
Sandquist said a major factor in obtaining
such a low interest rate is Stanford's AAA "
status, which essentially deems the I ntversi-


Byerwalter
ty the lowest risk investment for
bond holders.
"Otherwise, the bond holders
would think there was a higher risk,
and we'd have to pay them more,"
Sandquist said, adding that only
eight universities received such a
ranking, including Harvard Uni
versity, MIT and Yale University.
"It's very elite," Sandquist
added.
Another factor to the low inter
est rate, Sandquist said, is the
CEFA's issuance of tax-exempt
bonds, which allows holders not to
claim them on their income taxes.
Taxable bonds would come at a
higher interest rate, according to

Sandquist.
Although the CEFA said the re
financing should save the Universi
ty $17 million, Sandquist estimates
that once fees and inflation are fig
ured in, the University will only
save about $5.3 million present
value.
"You have to pay bankers, at
torneys and the CEFA," Sandquist
said. He added that the CEFA
most likely did not figure in infla
tion when coming up with the $17
million figure.
Vice President for Business Af
fairs Mariann Byerwalter said this
is only one of many refinances
made during the last few years to
help deal with the University's
total debt of $9(K) million.
"You save a little every year,"
Byerwalter said.
