land.stanford.edu. That site will be retired,
with all its pages moved to http. w ww.Stan
ford. edu.
The change — implemented b\ Distrib
uted Computing Group, a division of Infor
mation Technology Systems and Services
w ill take about a year, according to an e-mail
announcement. Pages currenth on the le

land server may he accessed at either ad

"The decision was made within lISS
based on requests from facult\. staff and stu
dents." said lim Jorgenrud. technical
manger of distributed computing and coordi
nator of the changes. He added that there
was also some confusion among those out
side the I niversit\ about the two-server

www -leland designation or attempt to follow
a link with the leland address will see a page
saving that the I Rl has been changed, along
with a link to the corresponding
page on the www.stanford.edu
server. After Sept. 1, 19W, users at
tempting to access pages with the
old URL address will receive a
"page not found" message on their
screen, with no links.

make the Weh easier to use," Shep
