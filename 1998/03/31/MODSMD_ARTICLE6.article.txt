No matter what he does after the
year abroad, though. Price feels that
his experience in Copenhagen will
increase his knowledge ot Denmark,
a country that he said has not been
overstudied; add another language
to his foreign language repertoire of
French and Russian: and make him a
strong candidate lor whatever he
chooses to do next.
