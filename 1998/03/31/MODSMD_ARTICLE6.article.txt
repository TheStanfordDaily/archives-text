Majoring in modern thought and

currently writing an honors thesis fo
cusing partly on Soren Kierkegaard,
a Danish philosopher and religious
thinker. Outside of Denmark,
Kierkegaard has been most influen
tial as a critic ot the (ierman philoso
pher Fricdrich Hegel.
Ai the Kierkegaard Research
C'entei at the University ol ( open
hageii, I'rice will extend his research
on the philosopher and his hack
ground as .i Danish intellectual.
Price will also study the intellectual

culture ol century Den
mark and how Kierkegaard lit into
this context.
While in Denmark. Price will
take intensive Danish language
classes, have the opportunit> to in
teract with other scholars at the in
stitute and have access to the
Kierkegaard archives as well as a re
production of his library. He will
most likely have a mentor and finish
the program hy writing a long paper
For Price, this scholarship is "a
chance to keep studying and pursue
interest further without heme com
mitted to a graduate program at an
American university."
Although he is not making a com

mitment now. some of Price's
thoughts lor his post-Fulbnght ycai
include law school, journalism, for
eign service or an academic career
"M\ plans are wide open." he said.
No matter what he does after the
year abroad, though. Price feels that
his experience in Copenhagen will
increase his knowledge ot Denmark,
a country that he said has not been
overstudied; add another language
to his foreign language repertoire of
French and Russian: and make him a
strong candidate lor whatever he
chooses to do next.
At Stanford. Price plays bass in

the jazz group Surplus Quartet. The
group has been seen at cafe nights at
La Maison Franqais. Price is also Sla
vianskii Dom's theme assistant and a
research assistant for Asst. German
Studies Prof. Art Strum and Slavic-
Languages Prof. Richard Schupbaeh.
This spring, he will assist Schup
baeh in a freshman seminar on gen
eral Russian history and culture.
Price spent part of his junior year in
Moscow; last summer he spent three
weeks in Sarajevo with a Stanford
student group called Miles To Go,
which performs humanitarian aid
work in the former Yugoslavia.

The Fulbright Scholarship's pur
pose is "to increase mutual under
standing between the people of the
United States and other countries
through the exchange of persons,
knowledge and skills." according to
a news release. Worldwide, there
were 4.423 applicants for avail
able grants this year. Some countries
are more competitive than others. In
Price's case, there were 23 applicants
in Denmark and only eight spaces.
The general application includes
a long form of personal information,
a two-page research proposal, a one
page personal statement, three rec
ommendations and a language ref
erence where applicable. At Stan
ford. applications are submitted
through the Overseas Resource

Center, where a four-person faculty
panel interviews the applicant, eval
uates the proposal and decides
whether to endorse the applicant.
The application is then forwarded to
the national Fulbright office.
Le-Ann Joy Adam, who works at
the Overseas Resource Center, was
recently in Denmark at the Universi
ty of Copenhagen, where she met
with the Fulbright Commission. " The
Fulbright Commission is anxious to
meet Price." she said. "They are very
excited about what he will be doing."
Adam will be running weekly in
formation meetings in the Bechtel
International Center this quarter,
where students will receive a hand
out and more specific information
on the Fulbright application process.
