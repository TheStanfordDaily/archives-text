With destruction of the Band Shak imminent, the Of
fice of Residential Education announced yesterday that
Phi Sig will serve as a Band theme house for the 1998-99
school year.
The office, acknowledging the Stanford Band's close
knit community, refused to force any separation of the
group. As a result, it stated that all band members —
more than 3(X) total — will be allowed to live in Phi Sig
(capacity: approximately 15).
"This is a great opportunity for us to better develop
Band culture," said the surprised Josh Schiller, former
Band president. Band members did not even know there
was a possibility for a theme house until after the Res Ed
announcement yesterday.
Certainly, space will be cramped. Band members es
timate stolen street signs and alcohol alone will fill most
of the house. To create more space. Band members plan
to eliminate clothing. The naked-only policy will give
more closet space for rooms and, according to Band
members, foster a stronger community spirit.
"Nudity will allow us to be even more open with one
another," said alto saxophonist Mike Huijon. "We will
be able to express ourselves more easily."
The Band also is already making plans for renova
tions. "The band doesn t need a regular kitchen facility,
so we will be replacing it with a more practical full-ser
vice bar," Huijon said.
All 10 Phi Sig residents, shocked and angered by the
announcement, have joined forces with the Stanford
Coalition Against War in Iraq and plan to stage a protest
the next time President Clinton comes to campus.
In a related incident. Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo returned a phone call to a Daily re
porter yesterday for the first time in many weeks,
The message, left on the news department's voice
mail at 5:15 p.m., stated simply, "Hello, this is Jane Ca
marillo. I'm returning [reporter] Eric Stratton's phone
call. Please call me back."
The three-sentence statement surprised many Uni
versity insiders. Camarillo has not spoken to the press or
appeared in public since March 2, the evening of the an
nouncement that Alpha Sigma house would become the
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority house for the 1998-99
school year.
"But, no matter, they will be assimilated," she added.
The voice mail ended speculation about the true iden
tity of the Residential Education director. University
sources and filmmaker Oliver Stone suspected, but
could not confirm, that Camarillo was actually a com
posite of several individuals speaking through a repre
sentative.
