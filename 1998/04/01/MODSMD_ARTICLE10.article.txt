Early Monday morning at Roble
Gym could fairly he called "Swing
Time," as a mass of would-be
dancers arrived to reserve a space in
Richard Powers' extraordinarily
popular dance classes.
Sign-ups for Social Dances of
North America 1 and Living Tradi
tions of Sw ing attracted an estimat
ed S(H) people, many of whom ar
rived two or three hours early to en
sure thatthey will be able to swing,
waltz, tango, merengue and cha-cha
by the end of the quarter.
There is room for approximately
120 students in each of the two
classes, 60 of each gender, for a total
of 240 spots each quarter. More
than half of those in line were un
able to join the classes.
Freshman Sarah Robinson
showed up at 6:15 a.m.. "and there
were 30 people there already. Some
of them had sleeping bags, but I
don't know if they all slept out."
Freshman Priva Venkatesan ar
rived at Roble Gym at 7:15 a.m. to
register for the swing class. Sign-ups
were scheduled to begin at 9 a.m.
"There were so many people. It
was insane," he said. "I was
amazed. I was hoping they were all
there for golf, but. no. There was a
huge crowd of people already.
When I signed up last quarter. I got
there at 6:30 and I was something
like the fourth person in line."
According to Dance Instructor
Richard Powers, as the line grew, it
extended through the courtyard of
Roble Gym. out the back door and
down Panama Street past the
Godzilla and Bambi bungalows.
To add to the chaos, many peo
ple were prepared to sign them
selves up as well as one other per

son.
"That meant that we had about
50 percent more sign-ups than there
were people in line." Powers said.
"It's sort of a tradition I inherited.
People who are out of town are al
lowed to have someone sign them
up. We won't do that any more.
Next year, you'll be able to sign
someone else up, but that will be
your only purpose in line. You can't
sign yourself up. too."
Powers and his dance partner
Angela Amarillas also offer non
credit evening classes. Dance class
es are also taught at Stanford
through the Ballroom Dance Club,
the Tango Club and salsa groups.
I lowever. Powers' classes that are
offered through the University con
tinue to grow in leaps and bounds.
James Mendoza, a 1994 gradu
ate in medical microbiology and im
munology. reports that when he
first took Social Dance I. there were
about 18 people at the first class
meeting, a sharp contrast to the
hundreds of students who now take
the class every year.
Mendoza said that before Pow
ers arrived, "Social dance was real
ly something a few grad students
would do. I think most undergrads
thought it was very uncool. Since
Richard came, it has grown fairly
exponentially."
As for Powers' take on the suc
cess of his programs, he said. "I
think the importance is not in num
bers but in the qualitative differ
ence we make in students' lives.
Students know from hearing from
their friends that this is more than
just a class — it's not just to learn a
step.
"We try to make it as meaningful
as possible. 1 think that's what peo
ple hear because it's apparently
word-of-mouth that causes this."
