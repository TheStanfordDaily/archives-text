## Yoga more than stress reliever 
### Allison Hays Editorial staff 
A loyal group of students set aside time to
learn correct posture and breathing exercises
under the direction of Stanford accountant Das
rathi Raghunath. For the teacher, who has pro
vided yoga lessons at Stanford for over 10 years,
meditation is not only a leisure activity but also a
way of life.
"I wanted to share my experiences with any
one interested in knowing their true nature and
their true potential," Raghunath said. "All they
need to do is wake up."
Raghunath describes his interest in yoga as a
hobby. He has given yoga lessons free of charge
and he considers it a form of community service
on campus.
Raghunath was first introduced to the bene
fits of meditation when he was 15 and attending

military school in India.
After being afflicted with a seri
ous illness, he returned to his vil

lage. where he met an in
spirational yoga instruc
tor. The study of the art of
yoga. Ragnuhath said,
helped him recover.
Learning yoga was "a
turning point in my life."
Ragnuhath said. "From
then on I never had any dis
eases."

Ragnuhath came to work
as an accountant at Stanford

over 10 years ago and has
offered the class

ever since. His

class size is
small,
ranging
from five to
15 people,
an d ni ee t s
every Satur-

day in Roble Gym. His students feel they have
benefited greatly from the experience.
"1 took the yoga class mostly for perspective
and to have some escape from the stresses of aca
demic life." said Deepa Srinivasan. a junior ma
joring in psychology. "I feel that it has helped me
to be more spiritual and more calm in my day-to
day activities.
"I enjoy the time to myself every Saturday
It's the little thing I pamper myself with."
Meditation and yoga exercises. Raghunath
said, can enhance

mental ca
pacity

and improve health. Altogether there are S.<KK)
standard yoga exercises v\ith 40 core exercises.
According to those w ho swear b\ it.it you do any
of these core exercises twice a day. "you can re
ally feel a change."
The three major areas of the yoga discipline
are the physical, mental and spiritual. One of the
goals. Raghunath explained, is to he "an inte
grated person."
"Anyone can practice and he physically fit.
mentally elevated and spiritually realistic." he
said.
According to the yoga master, much research
has been done investigating exactly how diet in

fluences the mind and how a vegetarian
diet is the most beneficial for the

Philosopher Didi
Anandamitra has written
over 2(K) publications Her
book about spiritual and

social philosophy describes

how the universe is ruled by three

forces: sentient, mutative and tactic.

"One can reach spiritual perfection with the
sentient force, which emphasizes the higher con
sciousness and calms our minds." Raghunath
said. "The mutative force makes us restless and
disrupts minds while the static force decays the
nund."
Certain foods trigger each of the forces. For
instance, fish and meat, according to the spiritu
al belief, decay the mind. On the other hand,
spicy foods such as garlic and onions disrupt
thinking.

Anandanutra's writings aim to
prove uh\ human bodies are de
signed for vegetarian diets.

' The important thing
about diet is balance,"
Raghunath said.
> "Fasting once in a
while for a 24-hour pe
riod will cleanse your
binlv and give it a rest."
