# Loan fund will offset grad housing costs
## 
### Shalini Bhargava Contributing writer 
As graduate students face in
creasing housing prices in the Bay
Area, the University has proposed
two new plans to help defray the
costs of living off campus.
rhe University is working to help
graduate students finance off-cam
pus housing through a new revolving
loan fund and a new plan to provide
free student housing listings. The
loan fund will help offset the costs of
housing deposits and the first and
last month's rent.
Given the high cost of housing in
the Stanford area, the current hous
ing crunch will most likely continue,
said Kathleen Bransfield, manager
of Housing Assignment Services.
Last year alone, more than 500 grad
uate students requesting housing
were left unassigned.
In an effort to alleviate the hous
ing pressure on graduate students,
Community Housing Services is
proposing a new rate structure for
housing listings. Student listings will
be free of charge. Bransfield said.
"The cost [of providing free list
ings] would have to be absorbed
elsewhere in the system." she said.
"Community Housing Services is
working with fixed costs."
Administrators at the Financial
Aid Office said the specific features
of the loan fund and its implementa

tion are not fully known vet.
While undergraduates are guar
anteed on-campus housing for four
years, graduate housing is guaran
teed only for new graduate students
who apply for housing by the July
deadline. Bransfield said.
Those who fail to apply by the
first deadline only receive housing if
someone previously assigned sud
denly refuses their assignment.
I Jnlike undergraduates, graduate
students are admitted throughout
the summer, Bransfield said, sug
gesting that the practice of admitting
graduate students year-round exac
erbates the housing problem. New
students admitted late in the process
have a harder time finding housing.
"Somebody admitted late in the
process is at a disadvantage. [How
ever], new students are given hous
ing before continuing students,"
Bransfield said.
Another factor in the lopsided
supply and demand for housing is
that Stanford's housing prices are
about 25 percent below the prices in
surrounding areas.
Bransfield said she worked with
Vice Provosts James Montoya and
Tim Warner and Linguistics Prof.
Thomas Wasow to improve gradu
ate housing. The group's proposed
changes, which were announced last
quarter, include making the singles
in Crothers Memorial Hall into dou
bles.
