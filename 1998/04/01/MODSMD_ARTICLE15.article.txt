# Urban Immersion offers alternative break experiences
## 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
For the 24 students who spent
last week in Los Angeles with
Campus Crusade for Christ's
Urban Immersion program, spring
break was much more than the
usual beaches and relaxation.
A program operated by Campus
Crusade for Christ, Urban Immer
sion is made up of students repre
senting various Christian Stanford
groups such as the Intervarsity
Christian Fellowship. Harvest and
Rejoice.
"I've never really done a mis
sion trip before," freshman Vanes
sa Padgett said two weeks ago in
anticipation of the community ser
vice and Christian outreach. "I've
indirectly shared the gospel with
friends, but now I'll have a purpose
volunteering in the community."
The delegation spent the five
days working with underprivileged
schoolchildren, handing out fliers
on Christianity door to door and
engaging community members in
religious dialogues.
"We had a packed schedule for
each day," Padgett said of their
daily regimen. They had 7:30 daily
breakfast, prayers, worship and
speakers, followed by a workday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. spent at vari
ous sites, culminating in a final
evening outreach.
Daily activities were geared to
ward service and faith. They
ranged from helping out with Sun
day school, to working with chil
dren in an after-school program, to
aiding in a church clothing distribu
tion for homeless families.
"I've never really been in a com
munity like that before," said ju
nior Molly McGuire. "You can go
in with any preconceived notions
and stereotypes, but I realized
quickly that the kids we worked
with were just kids."
Junior Andrew Federle admit

ted to similar preconceived biases
and anticipations of working with
homeless people in the inner city.
Perhaps the most meaningful expe
rience for him. he said, was aiding
with a church clothing distribution.
"What struck me most was the
humility of the people that we
worked with. Part of me felt
ashamed to watch them dive in and
collect all the clothes they could
hold, but they seemed very grate
ful."
McGuire added that the Bible
teaches people to take care of the
poor. So the clothing distribution
was a way to give back to the com
munity.
"Even if you're not faced with
[poverty] in your own community,"
she said, "you need to seek it out
and help people."
McGuire and Padgett were
equally moved with the interaction
with children. The group worked
with children from a Sunday
school, as well as children from an
after-school program — run by the
Faithful Central Missionary Bap
tist Church — called SAY Yes, or
Save America's Youth.
"The kids are so energetic and
have such a capacity for affection,"
Padgett said of the children from
the Sunday school.
The group spent two days with
SAY Yes serving as "college bud
dies" to many inner-city children in
the program.
McGuire acknowledged a
"strong connection with the kids"
as they are free from much of the
baggage that adults have to man
age, she said.
"Working with the kids was re
ally meaningful," Padgett said. "I'd
hope that contact with a college
buddy or something we said or did
could plant a little seed and keep
them inspired."
Through work with children and
with homeless adults of the com
munity. the group was able to share
religion and spirituality with peo
ple of a radically different back
ground.
"A lot of times when people go
to do service, they expect to give a
lot. We really received," Federle
said of the experience, which he ad

mitted. has enormous value in ret
rospect.
Both Federle and McGuire
were moved in talking to Jackie, a
church coordinator with whom
they had much interaction.
"She said we draw a big distinc
tion between (being) homeless and
not," Federle said. "But there is a
time for everyone when you go to a
foreign city or strange place and
need to crash with a friend. You're
homeless yourself then."

McGuire added, "We all have
this conception of homeless people
as grimy and pushing a shopping
cart down the street, but in reality,
we are all at times homeless."
The students agree that they
took more out of the experience
than they originally anticipated.
The mission was about faith and
outreach, and the students returned
with a new perspective on the home
less and on interpersonal connection
at a religious and spiritual level.
