Fewer boys born
CHICAGO (AP) — The search for Mr. Right may he getting
even harder.
The ratio of boys to girls born in the United States and ( ana
da dipped ever so slightly between 1970 and 1990, and a study
suggests environmental factors — such as prenatal exposure to
pesticides — may be why.
The declines began even earlier in several other industrialized
countries and corresponded with increases in some male birth
defects and prenatal exposure to pesticides and industrial chem
icals, said Devra Lee Davis, an environmental epidemiologist at
the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based policy
research institute.
Davis and her colleagues examined data on birth ratios and
increases in male birth defects, such as misplaced urinary open
ings, and testicular cancer.
"Some, as yet unrecognized, environmental health hazards

are affecting the sex ratio of births as well as other unexplained
defects in male reproduction," they concluded. Their analysis
appears in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
Whale released from captivity
SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Coast Guard cutter leaned hard,
shifting with the weight of the 10-ton gray whale as she precari
ously dangled over the side of the boat.
"Release the whale!" cried the crew officer.
The pulley whirled as the rope rushed through. J.J. slipped
from the canvas cocoon that was supported by a crane and
splashed into the water yesterday.
After 14 months at Sea World, where she was routinely fed,
monitored and marveled at by tourists, J.J. must now survive on
her own. She is the first gray whale raised by humans and her
return to the ocean made history for marine science.
