# Polygraphs banned

WASHINGTON (AP) — Lie-detector
evidence can be banned from trials, the
Supreme C ourt ruled yesterday, citing con
cern over its scientific soundness. But the
justices left open the possibility that poly
graph results might have to be allowed in
some cases.
"There is simply no consensus that poly
graph evidence is reliable," the court said,
rejecting K-l a California airman's claim that
he had a constitutional right to tell a court
martial jury that he passed a lie-detector
test.
The ban on use of lie-detector results in
military trials is a valid means "of advancing
the legitimate interest in barring unreliable
evidence," Justice Clarence Thomas wrote
for the court.

Some courts allow the use of lie-detector
results in criminal trials but most state and
federal courts ban it. Yesterday's ruling
allows each of those courts to continue its
own policy.
Hut four justices among the eight-mem
ber majority said a future case might present
a more compelling argument that some
defendants have the right to use favorable
polygraph results.
Writing for the four. Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy agreed that the military rule did
not violate the Constitution's Sixth Amend
ment right to present a defense. "I doubt,
though, that the rule of.. . exclusion is wise,
and some later case might present a more
compelling case for introduction of the testi
mony than this one does," he said.
