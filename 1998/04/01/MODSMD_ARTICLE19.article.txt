ASSU course guide needs
improvement before it
can serve students' needs

Although we applaud
the ASSU's effort to pub
lish a course guide for this
quarter, significant improvements
must be made before the guide can
adequately help students select class
es. Many students were rightfully dis
appointed at the noncomprehensive
nature of the guide.
A serious flaw with the course
guide is its failure to include most of
the classes offered this quarter. Some
classes were not included because
their departments would not release
information due to low response
rates on evaluation forms. Now that
we have a course guide, students
should make a greater effort to fill
out the forms and course guide
researchers should work towards
more comprehensive coverage of
classes.
Another way the content of the
course guide can be improved is by
broadening the sources of informa
tion used. Hopefully, future course
guides will include qualitative infor
mation in addition to quantitative
data. Student comments are essential
to a course guide. Without them, it is
difficult to assess the validity of
numerical information.
For example, an "excellent" in one
class according to one group of stu
dents might mean something differ
ent to another group. By reviewing
student comments, succinctly sum
marizing student opinion and offer
ing a few selected student responses,
the utilitv of the course guide will

improve significantly.
The course guide researchers
might look to the School of Engi
neering's Tau Beta Pi Course Guide
as a model. To obtain helpful student
comments, the ASSU should consid
er producing its own class evaluation
form. A comment sheet designed
specifically for the course guide
could allow students to be more can
did in their evaluations. Such forms
should establish criteria and a rank
ing system for evaluating courses
that would be extensively explained
in future guides.
The course guide also lacks infor
mation pertinent to this quarter.
Some of the ratings reflect the course
when it was taught by a different pro
fessor. Different instructors can
make the same class enthralling or
dull. Hopefully, future editions of the
course guide will include evaluations
that apply directly to the present
term's instructors.
Improving the presentation of the
information given will also improve
the course guide. Its designers should
concentrate on displaying the infor
mation in a uniform format that is
easier to read. Integrating graphics
and charts would also be helpful.
Although there is significant room
for improvement in the course
guide's content and presentation, it is
a good first attempt.
The ASSU recognizes the need to
improve the guide and an ASSU
Course Guide Advisory Board has
been formed so that students can
provide suggestions.
By unifying its formatand incorpo
rating more qualitative information
about the courses, the ASSU can
make its course guide a useful tool
for students.
