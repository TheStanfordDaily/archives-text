### Alda Leuinskii Senior staff writer 
A bright light, possibly the spirit from another
world, visited Memorial Auditorium last night as
Ralph Reed, the former head of the ( hristian ("oali
tion. returned to the Stanford campus in response to
a vision he had "in the Motel 6 in I ulsa off Route
94."
Believers besieged Memorial Auditorium at
midnight last night, hoping to catch a glimpse of the
Holy Spirit that Reed claimed would "come to bless
the mission of the religious right."
Followers were rewarded by the appearance of a
bright amorphous light that illuminated Reed as he
preached about the importance of morality and
chastity.
According to Associate Dean of Religious Life
Patricia Karlin-Neumann, Reed's illuminated
frame resembled "Elvis in his sagging years."
Reed, currently the president of Security
Strategies, a campaign and marketing company
for conservative political candidates, was ;iuak
ened in the middle of the night during an
overnight stay in Oklahoma by a voice that beck
oned him to return to Stanford, "that cesspool ot
liberal thought."
"The voice was deep and btxmnng. it came from
nowhere and everywhere. The room began to shake
— if the TV weren't glued to the table, it would have
fallen off." Reed said haltingly in a press conference
yesterday night.
"1 turned to the woman next to me. asked her
name and questioned her as to whether or not -«he
had heard the voice as well.
"She hadn't. That's when I knev\ that I had vsit
nessed a miracle."
Reed's roommate maintains that she heard n> th
ing that night and that Reed mas have been halluci
nating due to the consumption of a great deal of "al
lergy medicine."
The voice told Reed that his work to further
Christian values would be rewarded and that the
spirit of Christ would visit Stanford in the waning
moments of the month
At Stanford. Reed was struck by the bright Imht
mid-sentence as he prtx:laimed. "The human body
is a vessel of God. We must as men strive to main
tain its chastity and perfection. I personalis have al
ways ..."
The bright light faded after a few brief and shin
ing moments, leaving only a faint odor of bacon
where Reed once stood.
