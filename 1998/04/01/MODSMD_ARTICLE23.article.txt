						communist new world order

DON'T YOU just
love capitalism?
Who isn't proud
of capitalism's relentless
invasion into every
aspect of our lives with
its cheers of low prices
and great savings? Take
telemarketing, for exam-

pie. I love it when they call me, don't
you?! I also like the ring of "3COM Park."
which is so much more mellifluous than
"Candlestick Park," its lugubrious prede
cessor.
Don't get me wrong. I mean. I love the
free market and take personal pride in
eliminating dead-weight loss, hut some
times I wonder if our society gets a little
carried away. Then again, what are our
alternatives?
Some folks say. what about commu
nism? Ah yes, communism! For those who
grew up in late and post-Cold War Amer
ica, communism has always been an enig
ma. Most of us never really understood it
until we were "exposed" to a little Marx in
CIV and promptly forgot it after the
exam.
At least in the unadulterated objectivi
ty of the American news media, commu
nism and capitalism are portrayed as dia
metrically opposed forces pitted against
each other in a zero-sum game aimed at
world domination. But is this really so?
Who is to say that communism and cap

italism will not form the mutually interde
pendent yin and yang of the political land
scape for the third millennium of the com
mon era? Are we really to believe that the
visible hand of cultural imperialism and
modern industrial policies will transform
our beloved Earth into a corporate Dis
neyland? As "the people" get more and
more fed up with the status quo, they will
be seeking alternative politics in the
upcoming decades, just as they sought
alternative clothes in the '70s, alternative
economics in the '80s and alternative
music in the '90s.
As the potential dawning of the alter
native political age approaches, we must
be aware that subtle changes around us
may be indicators of things (or regimes) to
come. Thus, without further ado, I now
provide a handy-dandy guide to the top 21
indications that your country (or any other
country, for that matter) is becoming com
munist:
#21: Every title is prefaced with "The Peo
ple's" or " The People's Democratic," i.e.
"The People's Court."
#20: Five-year planners become every
one's Christmas gift of choice.
#19: There are frequent mass gatherings of
the "folk" waving the country flag in pub
lic squares. Something like New Year's
Eve in Times Square, perhaps?
#18: Everyone's first name is "Comrade."
#17: Idiomatic expressions like "Three's a

crowd" become *'3(H)'s a crowd."
#16: Relatives keep disappearing.
#15: Proposition 152 ... hmmm?
#14: Colors disappear. Only gray remains.
#13: The weather is always overcast.
#12: Architecture is dominated by bland,
identical concrete block structures suspi
ciously similar to Escondido Village.
#11: The Olympic women's swimming
team grows beards and chest hair and
starts bench pressing more weight than the
men's weightlifting team.
#10: History books change.
#9: Youth movements arise based on the
country's political leader.
#8: Pictures of the leader appear on
stamps, money, public buildings, toilet
seat covers, prophylactics, etc.
#7: Government leaders have been in
office since World War II or before you
were born, whichever is earlier ... i.e.
Ronald Reagan, Jesse Helms ... hmm???
#6: Opposition leaders mysteriously disap
pear.
#5: On maps of the world, your country is
front and center and colored red.
#4: People wait in line outside the DMZ
instead of the DMV.
#3: People wait in lines in general.
#2: Your country is split into two, and the
other half has diplomatic ties.
#1: The Reds always win the World Series.
