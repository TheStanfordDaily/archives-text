Overseas students left
out in the cold
Stanford University offers its students
an enormous range of opportunities to get
better acquainted with other countries and
cultures. By participating in one of Stan
ford's overseas programs, you can sub
merge you can see the world while simulta
neously getting the same quality education
you pay $30,(MX) a year to get in California.
So you pack up your bags, stash your
stuff under a friend's bed or in some dirty
storage box in East Palo Alto and ship
yourself off to Paris (or Florence or Berlin,
or some equally distant location). Then you
have a great quarter (or two), and after a
crash course in culture, you're good and
ready to get back to California.
But what they don't tell you when you
decide to go off to the boonies is that they
will have absolutely no consideration for
you when you get back. Although you have

guaranteed housing, they will "regret to
inform you that they can't offer you any
housing at this time."
Hni ... that's funny, I must not really
know the definition of guaranteed, hut
that's OK, I'll just pitch a tent in White
Plaza until the gods of undergraduate hous
ing decide they can turn the janitor's closet
in Arroyo into a small, windowless, but
quaint bedroom for me and two friends to
live in for the next three months. Sure, it
will be a little soggy by the Claw the first
two or three weeks of the quarter, with the
torrential rains and all, but there will be 77
other people who were abroad all quarter
and have no means of finding accomoda
tions keeping me company. Because guess
what? They're all unassigned too!
Or maybe I will move home and com
mute eight hours back and forth by plane.
Home would be in Nicaragua, by the way.
The other 12 people and I returning
from the Paris campus without a place to
live are not worried. We will all just move
into the storage place where we left our

stuff and hitch a ride to school in the morn
ings from East Palo Alto, since our campus
is highly accessible for people without cars.
The funny part is, I could probably
afford a ear, and a completely furnished
house in Palo Alto if I weren't paying
$3().(KK) a year to go to Stanford. But then I
wouldn't need to live in Palo Alto, would I?
I guess I should be used to it. After all,
this is the second time this year that I have
been unassigned. You would just think that
knowing we have a housing problem. Stan
ford would become a little more selective in
admissions ... or build more housing.
In my next life I'm going to Berkeley!
