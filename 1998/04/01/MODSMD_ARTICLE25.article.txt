eDear Health Forum,
In a previous Health Forum, you men
tioned that the best way to inerease or initi
ate "fat loss" is to use long, slow, distance
type exercises. Why do these exercises burn more
fat than short, intense exercises such as lifting
weights or sprinting?
— Maddy, Class of2ooo
A Dear Maddy,
Good question. I'm sure that other peo
ple were wondering the same thing. At
rest, approximately 50 percent of muscu
lar energy comes from fatty acids. These fatty
acids are the products of adipose tissue
metabolism.
Certain hormones, which are a class of blood
born signaling molecules, set in motion the
metabolism process. These hormones travel to
places in the body where adipose tissue is stored,
including the waist, hips and thighs. The adipose
tissue is broken down into fatty acids that travel to
muscle cells via the blood stream.
When you start to move, however, the muscle
primarily uses stored sugars such as glucose for
energy. Meanwhile, burning of fatty acids dimin
ishes. The reason for this is simple: degrading fat
into fatty acids and sending those molecules to
active muscles takes a long time.
The muscle needs energy right away to power
contraction. Waiting for fatty acids to trickle
through the fatty acid pathway doesn't provide
cellular fuels within the necessary time frame. To
maximize fat metabolism, one must engage in
long, slow, distance exercises which provide the
body with enough time to mobilize fat stores.
This is not to say that the other types of exer
cise are not beneficial. Weight resistance training,
for example, is a great way to build muscle mass
and increase your resting metabolic rate (RMR)
on a daily basis.
These and other similar exercises still burn
calories. But if you're looking to maximize "fat
loss," increasing the amount of long, steady jogs
and swims in your exercise regimen will do a
world of good.
And. always remember that the best exercise
scheme is one that works for you and is composed
of things that you feel comfortable doing. I would
recommend a regimen that consists of both types
of exercise and balances the goals of fat
metabolism with maintenance of muscle mass and
strength.
Dear Health Forum,
m M I've been looking for a way to
increase and maintain my calcium intake
but I am also lactose intolerant. Any
quick suggestions?
— Jen K., Class of 1999
A Dear Jen,
I, too, am mildly lactose intolerant
and sometimes find it difficult to make
sure I'm getting my RDA of calcium.
Luckily, there are several options for us to choose
from in this day of nutrition gurus and dietary
supplements.
First and foremost, you can buy just about any
dairy product that has had the lactose removed.
The brand Lactaid has several items — everything
ranging from milk to ice cream to many different
kinds of cheeses.
Almost all of the major supermarkets carry
these items including Andronico's on Quarry
Road. Marie Calender's in Menlo Park and 7-
Eleven.
1 am an extremely picky eater and even I can't
taste the difference between lactose-free dairy
products and regular ones.
Alternatively, barring any unknown medical
conditions, you might want to consider the use of
a daily calcium supplement or daily vitamin.
This might be just the solution you're looking
for, if you can remember to take it every day-
There are several brands that are just as good and
much less expensive than many of the name
brands.
But, as always, you should first consult your
primary care physician before taking any dietary
supplement or daily vitamin.
