# Garlic, gingko and ginseng:
## Alternative medicine finds a home on the Farm 
### Molly Masland Contributing writer 
Eight years ago, Ann Clark was given
news that most women pray they'll never
hear: she had breast cancer. After under
going a mastectomy, Clark thought the
ordeal was over. However, she discov
ered last year that cancer had developed
in her other breast and underwent a sec
ond mastectomy.
Alter the operation, she did all the
things her doctors told her to do, such as
getting exercise and eating well.
Although her doctor didn't prescribe it,
she also slept on a magnetic mattress,
used a magnetic pillow and wore mag
netic inserts in her shoes. Clark recov
ered rapidly from her illness and now
leads a normal life.
"Magnet therapy didn't replace my
regular medicine or surgical treatment,
but it was a wonderful complement to
my healing regimen," Clark said. "1 had
a lot more energy, experienced less pain
and got better sleep."
Clark received a bachelor's degree in
biology from Stanford in 1%2. She now
runs a health consulting practice in Red
wood Shores.
Although many question the efficacy
of magnet therapy, people nationwide
are turning to alternative healing
approaches for relief that conventional
medicine has been unable to provide.
According to Dr. David Spiegel, pro
fessor of psychiatry and behavioral sci
ences at the School of Medicine, one
third of Americans and half of all cancer
patients use alternative medicine. A 1990
study by Dr. David Eisenberg at Har
vard's School of Medicine showed that
more visits are paid to alternative care
practitioners than to all regular primary
care physicians combined.
Given the staggering demand for
alternative medicine, the medical estab
lishment in America is running to catch
up with a trend already well underway.
Alternative therapies available here
As part of this effort, Stanford is
opening the Complementary Medicine
Clinic this month. The clinic will provide
alternative medicine as an integrated
component of advanced medical care.
Under the direction of Spiegel, national
ly recognized for his work with hypnosis
and cancer support groups, the clinic will
provide techniques to help patients cope
with the stress, pain and anxiety associat
ed with medical illness and its treatment.
Among the therapies to be offered
are acupuncture, biofeedback, hypnosis,

group psychotherapy, meditation and
massage therapy. The clinic will be avail
able on a fee-for-service basis to anyone
with health problems, ranging from
chronic headaches and arthritis to lile
threatening illnesses such as cancer and
heart disease. Treatment costs are not
yet covered by most health insurance
plans.
According to Spiegel, many patients
try alternative medicine when orthodox
treatments fail to work or when the
adverse side effects of conventional
treatments become intolerable. He also
believes patients are tired of the imper
sonal care they receive through HMOs
and other health plans where profit is a
primary motive.
"Over the years as doctors have
become more like biotechnicians.
they've also become more distant from
their patients." Spiegel said. "The

patients are turning to alternative
modicine whictr often values the whole
person. Patients need a sense of caring
from physicians."
Spiegel's work with cancer patients,
featured on Bill Mover's PBS series
"Healing and the Mind," has shown that
psychological factors have a dramatic
effect on cancer mortality rates.
Patients lived longer than others at
similar stages in the disaease when they
joined support groups, had close rela
tionships and practiced relaxation tech
niques.
"How these patients deal with stress
affects mortality." Spiegel said. "Social
support is a stress buffer with physical
consequences. Social isolation is as bad
for vour health as smoking."

Evaluating alternative medicine
I he Complementary Medicine Clinic
is the first of its kind at Stanford to offer
alternative therapies as part of a regular
medical treatment. Formal research at
Stanford in the area, however, started
several years ago.
Eisenberg's Harvard study, which
showed growing numbers of Americans
were seeking out alternative medicine,
was published in the New England Jour
nal of Medicine in 1993 and sparked
great interest among members of
Congress. In 1994, Congress created the
Office of Alternative Medicine at the
National Institutes ol Health (NIH) to
identify areas of research in the growing
field. Using federal grants, the NIH
funded 10 academic medical centers to
conduct research on complementary and
alternative medicine.

Tn 1995, Stanford's Medjcal School
received a NIH grant to fund the Com
plementary and Alternative Medicine
Program. I he purpose of the program is
to research effects of different therapies
on the aging process. In particular, the
program is investigating the role of alter
native treatments in reducing heart dis
ease. osteoporosis, arthritis, depression
and mental deterioration.
According to Dr. William Haskell,
principal investigator for the program,
the goal of the studies is not only to iden
tify new therapies but also to weed out
potentially harmful treatments.
"Some of our motivation is to test out
claims and see what degree of benefit
they really have," Haskell said. "There's
a lot of hype about some of these thera

pics, and we think it's important to docu
ment that in many cases there are no
effects, and in some cases there are even
harmful effects."
Although praised by many who
believe it's time formal scientific studies
were done on alternative therapies, the
program has not gone uncriticized.
"When we first started, there were
many questions of concern from people
worried that if Stanford became involved
in these studies it would be an automatic
endorsement of alternative medicine."
Haskell said. "Hut this is not an endorse
ment. In fact, it's just the opposite. We
need to document the benefits, or lack of
benefits, and potential risk factors of
such therapies for the sake of the pub
lic."
Among the research being conducted
by the program are studies on garlic's
potential effect on cholesterol levels,
plant estrogens' effect on post
menopausal women, meditation's effect
on heart patients, and gingko's effect on
memory and cognitive function. Ginko is
an Asian herb.
Caveat emptor
Ellen DiNucci. project coordinator
for the program, believes that reconsid
eration of licensing prt>cedures are nec
essary to ensure public safety and thai
consumers should be cautious in adopt
ing alternative medicine.
"This has become a major consumei
issue." DiNucci said "There are prob
lems with credentials and licensing ol
practitioners. Some have an M l)., other
have only done a 30-hour seminar. Peo
ple are basically just trusting their gut
There are no long-term studies out. The
only thing consumers can do at this point
is try to do a lot of research on their own
beforehand."
,„,"Man\ of these petiple see We&jftjn
physicians but often combine them witf]
3 J - ~1 y, i i
native approaches." Haskell said. "Most
of these approaches have an emphasis on
the mind-body spiritual component of
healing. We see this in traditional Chi
nese medicine, medicine in Korea. Tibet
and South America. It's often described
in different ways but refers to the same
underlying principles."
Chao-Chi Lin. a Stanford masters stu
dent in political science from Taiwan,
regularly combines both traditional Chi
nese medicine with standard Western
treatments. She views the Chinese
approach, with its emphasis on diet and
herbal supplements, as more preventa
tive and helpful for chronic conditions.
