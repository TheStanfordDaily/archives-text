## Bacteria teach biologists about the cellular skeleton 
### Charmain Tan 
The activities of two bacteria may hold the answer to
the age-old question of how a cell changes its shape,
moves in response to external cues and organizes its
cytoplasmic contents.
Much as a building's girders provide for its shape
and stability, the cytoskeleton — a dense network of
intracellular protein filaments found throughout the
cytoplasm — maintains a cell's architecture.
However, unlike the rigid girders of a building, the
cytoskeleton is a dynamic structural entity. In response
to extracellular signals, it undergoes continuous rear
rangements. These transformations lead to changes in
cell shape and directed cellular movement.
The bacteria. Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella
tlexneri, are "smart cells that have learned how to rear
range the [infected cell's own] actin cytoskeleton." said
Julie Theriot. assistant professor of biochemistry. "By
expressing a single protein, these bacteria cause the
host cell to polymerize actin." The polymerization of
actin propels the bacteria through the infected cell and
into neighboring cells.
Actin filaments are tine of the major structural priv
teins of a eukaryotic cell's cytoskeleton. The filaments
are formed by the addition of actin protein monomers
to one end of the filament, a process known as poly
merization.
Localized actin polymerization events result in the
deformation of the plasma membrane — which is the

cell's outer membrane and formation of protrusions
that can cause the leading edge of a cell to crawl over
surfaces.
This behavior of actin filaments is crucial for allow
ing directed cell locomotion in functions such as
"wound healing, where a white bl<xxl cell moves into
an infected wound to clean things up." Theriot said.
Actin filaments can be thought of as the building
blocks upon which different types of cell surface struc
tures arise. While the basic form of the actin filament
stays the same, the design is directed by a large number
of actin-binding proteins. Due to the complex assem
blies of proteins required for cytoskeleta) function,
understanding how these proteins determine when and
where actin polymerization occurs has been difficult.
Thus. Theriot and others have turned to L . monocy
togenes and S flexneri for clues into the workings of
the cell cytoskeleton. Both bacteria infect and then
grow inside the host cell's cytoplasm. Once inside the
cell, they induce the formation of actin filaments adja
cent to their surface and use this polymerization of

actio as a mode of transportation to move through the
cell.
"A single bacterial surface protein is necessary and
sufficient for motility in each organism." Theriot
reports. Furthermore, "expression of either of these
proteins in a normally non-motile bacteria induces
actin-based motility in these organisms." said Sandy
McCallum, a postdixrtoral fellow in Theriot *s laborato
ry.
ITns. together with the finding that "neither bacteri
al protein exerts any direct influence on polymerization
of pure actin." suggested that both bacteria required
interactions with other host cell factors to induce actin
based motility.
Theriot s laboratory has successfully reconstituted
motility of these organisms outside of the whole cell, an
achievement that allows them to study actin-based
movement in a simple model system. Additionally,
because a single bacterial protein from each species is

he used as molecular bait to identify
other factors involved in motility.
"We hope to use Shigella IcsA to
identify proteins which are involved
in actin rearrangement," McCallum
said. Following this, each individual
protein can he "selectively depleted
and studied to see if it plays a direct
or indirect role" in the motility of
Shigella. I 'sing this technique, Mc-
Callum and Theriot hope to identify
novel cvtoskeletal and motility pro
teins and to understand the normal

goes.
I'his research could also lead to a
better understanding of the patho
genesis of Shigella and identify new
ways to control the spread and
severity of Shigella infection. S.
flexneri is the causative agent of
bacillary dysentery, a disease that
claims the lives of half a million
children per year in Third World
nations. Over the years, antibiotic
resistant strains of Shigella have
arisen, with the result that only one
class of antibiotics still works to
control disease. However, this fam
ily of antibiotics, fluoroquinolones,
is not recommended for children
because ot its toxicity. Thus, the de
velopment of alternative antibiotics
with novel targets is desperately

needed.
McCallum is looking at the bac
terial genes which induce actin
polymerization as one such possi
ble target. In Shigella strains with
mutations in thelcsA gene, bacte
ria multiply but are unable to
spread to other cells. This loss in
cell-to-cell spread results in de
creased virulence, pointing to the
importance of bacteria-cytoskele
ton interactions in Shigella dis
ease. "We hope by looking at IcsA
that we will be able to identify spe
cific interactions between IcsA and
cellular proteins, short circuit the
interaction between the bacteria
and the cytoskeleton," and thus in
terfere with the disease process,
McCallum said.
