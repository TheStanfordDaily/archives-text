MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
■ Tonight: No. 6 Stanford (12-6,11 -5 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) vs. BYU(I3-3,11-3),7p.m.
at Burnham Pavilion.

The sixth-ranked and defending national
champion Cardinal (12-6, 11-5 Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation), looks to rebound from a
difficult spring break with a match against
Brigham Young University (13-3, 11-3 MPSF)
tonight at 7 p.m.
Stanford has already secured a spot in the
MPSF's postseason tournament, but needs vic
tories in order to maintain its second-place po
sition in the MPSF's Pacific Division. Keeping
that position will allow the Cardinal to play its
first-round MPSF tournament match at home.
The Cougars started the season ranked No. 1
in the preseason polls; they currently own the
fourth spot in the rankings.
The last Cardinal-Cougar matchup was near-

ly a year ago, in the semifinals of the MPSF
tournament. BYU fell to the Cardinal in three
hard-fought games, 16-14. 16-14. 17-15.
"They gave us a lot of trouble last year," s;iid
Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves. "It was the
critical match of the postseason and our biggest
challenge on the way to the [national] champi
onships."
BYU returns five starters from last year's
squad, in addition to bolstering its roster with
top recruits.
"On paper, they are a very good team,"
Nieves said. "And they back it up pretty well."
Stanford's middle blockers will face quite a
challenge from the middle blockers of BYU. ju
nior first-team All-American Ryan Millar and
top freshman recruit Shane Van Beest.
Van Beest currently leads the Cougars in hit
ting percentage and service aces in addition to
leading both BYU and the nation with a 2.69
blocking average. He brings important interna
tional experience to BYU as a starter on the
Australian National Team.
Nieves considers both Millar and Van Beest
"dominating forces in the middle."
BYU also returns two setters who battled for
the starting position last year, sophomores Hec
tor Lebron and Chris Pitzak. Lebron played
more for the Cougars last year, but this year,
Pitzak has beaten out Lebron for the starting

spot.
The Cougars are also deep at the outside hit
ter position, led by junior Ossie Antonetti. An
tonetti leads the Cougars with a 5.35 kill aver
age and a 2.39 dig average.
The Cardinal is coming off a strange couple
of weeks with both an unexpected sweep of top
ranked UCLA and two disappointing losses to
fifth-ranked Hawaii. Stanford needs to pick up
wins this week to rebuild confidence and gain
momentum going into the postseason.
After the strong, competitive plav of Cardi
nal substitutes in Hawaii. Stanford fans just
might see some different players on the court
this week.
Because of the aggressive play of Stanford's
second team. Nieves feels that he "needs to be
open-minded about who [he] puts on the
court."
In the Cardinal's last match, five Stanford
substitutes recorded 37 kills, mainly in the final
game of the match. The starters they replaced
all but senior middle blocker Keenan White
hurst — posted just 17 kills in the first two
games of the match.
"This will be a tough match, especially com
ing off of our disastrous matches in Hawaii."
Nieves said. "There isn't much time to regroup,
so these are the times that we learn a lot about
ourselves and our team."
