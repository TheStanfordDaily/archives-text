# Cold Cardinal fumbles at Ord
## Monterey a bust for unpracticed team 
### Will Hemming Contributing writer 
The winter season for the Stan
ford women's golf team was full of
constant rain and frustration
caused by El Nino. Following the
seemingly endless weeks of dark
skies and limited practice, Stanford
headed to the San Jose State Spar
tan Invitational March 9-11 in
search of some relief.

WOMEN'S GOLF
â–  March 9-11: Arizona 633, Stan
ford 659 (7th place).

Mother Nature cooperated, and
it looked as if the Cardinal would
have a chance to put together a
solid tournament. But the golf
course at the Fort Ord-Bayonet
Golf Club had other ideas. Stanford
came in seventh at the tournament
posting after three rounds. Ari
zona finished first with 633.
Throughout the three-day com
petition. the long par-74 layout, fea
turing narrow tree-lined fairways
and extremely slick putting sur
faces, gave the Cardinal fits. Stan
ford had played few competitive
rounds prior to the tournament,
and the difficulty of the course only
magnified the Cardinal's lack of
preparation.
"We didn't have great tourna
ment preparation going into Mon
terey." said junior Michelle Sperrv.
*'We didn't hit any balls that week,
and we were all of a sudden faced

with a really tough course."
Prior to the tournament, the
course itself did not appear to be as
difficult as it later proved.
"On paper, the course didn't
look like it had a very hard setup."
said freshman Lauren Robertson.
"But there were just a lot of holes
where it was easy to post a high
number."
Aside from its unusual length
and tight fairways, Fort Ord's
toughest element all week long was
its lightning-fast greens.
"It was like putting on a warped
hardwood floor," Robertson said.
"It was extremely difficult to judge
the distance, and almost every putt
had a huge break."
However, the hair-raising three
day affair was not a complete fail
ure for the Cardinal. Freshman
Stephanie Keever posted her best
finish of the year and placed fourth
at 11-over-par 233.
In the first round, Keever recov
ered from a shaky start and birdied
four out of the last six holes. Her
late-round Hurry led to a score of 77
and kept her in contention after IS
holes. She then wrapped up the
week with a pair of 78s.
"I feel like I played pretty well,"
Keever said. "I putted real well all
week, which was great considering
how fast the greens were."
Sperry also had a strong showing
in Monterey, but after the tourna
ment, she chose to focus her con
