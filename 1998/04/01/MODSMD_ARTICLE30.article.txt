# Lacrosse gains East Coast experience
## 
### Bobby Blunt Contributing writer 
During spring break, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team (b-0 Western
Women's Lacrosse League, 7-5 over
all) prepared itself for the continua
tion of the season by taking a tour of
the East Coast. Although the team did
not come out with a winning record
during the trip, it gained valuable ex
perience
The Stanford squad met stiff com
petition during the trip after taking a
short break from the season lor finals
week. The team posted a 1-4 record
over the course of the tour. Stanford's

win came against Catholic University,
while the team lost to Pennsylvania,
Ohio State, Saint Joseph's and Vir
ginia Tech.
Lacrosse is much more established
on the East Coast, where there are
much stronger teams. Most high
schools there have women's lacrosse
programs, while in the West, and es
pecially in California, high school pro
grams are now just getting started.
"Right now we are in the building
stages to get to the East Coast level."
said sophomore Dana Katter. "Over
all, the week was a great learning ex
perience. Although we lost a few
games, we put up a good fight and had

a positive week
The trip came at a perfect time, as
the team is gearing up lor the final part
of the league season.
Now. only two final league games,
against California and UC-Davis, re
main for the team Ihe Davis and Cal
teams will offer Stanford the toughest
competition on its league schedule, so
the spring break trip should serve as
good preparation for the Cardinal.
"As ;i team we learned a tremen
dous amount." said senior Dara
Kaplin. "The defense was solid and we
improved in the transition in the mid
field W hat we learned will be very ap
parent in our remaining games."

The East Coast teams were j ust too
strong for Stanford over the course of
the entire game, but the team did show
strong points.
Armed with a positive attitude and
the technical improvement gained
front the spring break trip, the Card is
ready to plunge into the remainder of
the season.
The team hopes that the experience
gained by facing tougher competition
will bring it up another level and help
it continue its unbeaten league streak.
The Stanford lacrosse team will not
have to wait long to put its new experi-
ence and confidence to the test.
Stanford will host the Western
Tournament this weekend.
Forty-eight teams from all
over western North America will
be attending the competition.
This will be the first time that
Stanford has hosted the annual
tournament.
Play will begin Saturday at S
a.m. and continue all day. The
second part of the tournament
will continue on Sunday. The

tournament will be held on eight
different fields, the main one
being New Maloney Field.
After this final preparation
the Stanford lacrosse team will
then have a chance to prove itself
against league rivals Davis and
Cal.
Although these are the tough
est of its league opponents, the
Cardinal is very confident.
"The results of our spring
break tour are not representative
of our ability, especially out
here," Kaplin said. 1 think that we
w ill be successful against Cal and
Davis. I'm sure we will be."
