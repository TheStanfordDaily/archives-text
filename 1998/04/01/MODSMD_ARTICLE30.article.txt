### Bobby Blunt Contributing writer 
During spring break, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team (b-0 Western
Women's Lacrosse League, 7-5 over
all) prepared itself for the continua
tion of the season by taking a tour of
the East Coast. Although the team did
not come out with a winning record
during the trip, it gained valuable ex
perience
The Stanford squad met stiff com
petition during the trip after taking a
short break from the season lor finals
week. The team posted a 1-4 record
over the course of the tour. Stanford's

win came against Catholic University,
while the team lost to Pennsylvania,
Ohio State, Saint Joseph's and Vir

Lacrosse is much more established
on the East Coast, where there are
much stronger teams. Most high
schools there have women's lacrosse

good preparation for the Cardinal.
"As ;i team we learned a tremen
dous amount." said senior Dara
Kaplin. "The defense was solid and we
improved in the transition in the mid
field W hat we learned will be very ap
parent in our remaining games."

The East Coast teams were j ust too
strong for Stanford over the course of
the entire game, but the team did show
strong points.
Armed with a positive attitude and
the technical improvement gained
front the spring break trip, the Card is
ready to plunge into the remainder of
the season.
The team hopes that the experience
gained by facing tougher competition
will bring it up another level and help

The Stanford lacrosse team will not
have to wait long to put its new experi-
