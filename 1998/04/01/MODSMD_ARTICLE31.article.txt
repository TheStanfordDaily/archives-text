## Predictions and suggestions for next year's Card squad 
### 
Now that the college basketball season has fi
nally come to a conclusion, there is only one
thing for us basketball writers to do.
Speculate about next year.
The Stanford men's basketball team will follow
up its fantastic Final Four run with a national title in
1999.
A bold claim? Let's quality it a little. The Stanford
men's basketball team will be crowned national
champions next season if...
1) Junior center Tim Young consistent!) makes
himself a presence under the rim No one is asking
Young to score 20 points a game, but he must be an
offensive threat. When opponents worr\ about
Young scoring, his excellent passing abilit\ often
eives Stanford wide open looks from the outside.

Actually, this brings up another point. Young
needs to make sure he stays on the court, meaning he
must keep out of foul trouble. Although I'm sure he
cheers loudly from the bench, his contributions on
the court are likely to be far more useful.
2) Stanford must also make itself more flexible
defensively. Thanks to the Card's impressive play in
the tournament, head coach Mike Montgomery is no
longer one of the most underrated coaches in Amer
ica. He has nurtured the Cardinal program into a na
tional powerhouse, and he has done it using primar
ily a man-to-man defense.
However, Kentucky guard Jeff Sheppard killed
the Card with three treys late in the game, and all
three of them came off the same double screen that
left Cardinal junior Kris Weems helpless. Recogniz
ing how hot Sheppard was and perhaps switching up
on the picks would have at least put a Stanford de
fender in Sheppard's face.
Also, how can one resist looking at the success
that Utah had using a triangle-and-two zone against
Arizona? The Wildcats made the Cardinal look like
it was playing in quicksand when the teams met this
season. Although nobody is suggesting that Stanford
become a zone team, a tiny amount of tinkering with
the Cardinal defense will make the team more adapt
able to the competition.
3) Stanford must also finish among the top few re
bounding teams in the nation. The Card finished in
the top 10 in rebounding margin this season, but with
eight players over 6 foot 7 inches, it can do better.
Put it this way â€” Utah and Kentucky finished first
and second in this category, and look where it got
them.
