# Lessons of the tourney
## Predictions and suggestions for next year's Card squad 
### 
Now that the college basketball season has fi
nally come to a conclusion, there is only one
thing for us basketball writers to do.
Speculate about next year.
The Stanford men's basketball team will follow
up its fantastic Final Four run with a national title in
1999.
A bold claim? Let's quality it a little. The Stanford
men's basketball team will be crowned national
champions next season if...
1) Junior center Tim Young consistent!) makes
himself a presence under the rim No one is asking
Young to score 20 points a game, but he must be an
offensive threat. When opponents worr\ about
Young scoring, his excellent passing abilit\ often
eives Stanford wide open looks from the outside.

Actually, this brings up another point. Young
needs to make sure he stays on the court, meaning he
must keep out of foul trouble. Although I'm sure he
cheers loudly from the bench, his contributions on
the court are likely to be far more useful.
2) Stanford must also make itself more flexible
defensively. Thanks to the Card's impressive play in
the tournament, head coach Mike Montgomery is no
longer one of the most underrated coaches in Amer
ica. He has nurtured the Cardinal program into a na
tional powerhouse, and he has done it using primar
ily a man-to-man defense.
However, Kentucky guard Jeff Sheppard killed
the Card with three treys late in the game, and all
three of them came off the same double screen that
left Cardinal junior Kris Weems helpless. Recogniz
ing how hot Sheppard was and perhaps switching up
on the picks would have at least put a Stanford de
fender in Sheppard's face.
Also, how can one resist looking at the success
that Utah had using a triangle-and-two zone against
Arizona? The Wildcats made the Cardinal look like
it was playing in quicksand when the teams met this
season. Although nobody is suggesting that Stanford
become a zone team, a tiny amount of tinkering with
the Cardinal defense will make the team more adapt
able to the competition.
3) Stanford must also finish among the top few re
bounding teams in the nation. The Card finished in
the top 10 in rebounding margin this season, but with
eight players over 6 foot 7 inches, it can do better.
Put it this way — Utah and Kentucky finished first
and second in this category, and look where it got
them.

4) The Cardinal has quieted ;ill
of those who suggested that the
team does not have a go-to guy. II
junior guard Arthur Lee doesn't
qualify, then no one in the college
game does. But Stanford cannot
allow "Brevin syndrome" to mu
tate into "Art syndrome" — one
of Stanford's problems in lWft- 1 )?
was that the Card would some
times stand around and just watch
Brevin Knight perform his magic.
This season, the Card has won
nearly all of its close games by re
lying on a lull cast of characters,
making Stanford one of the most
dangerous teams at the end of a
close game. Any one of a number
of players could put the dagger in
an opponent's heart.
5) If Stanford has any hopes of
returning to next year's Final
Four, it must stay focused. The
Card got a taste of life near the top
earlier this season, when it was
ranked fourth in the country after
starting the season 18-0.
But Stanford quickly found
that being the big game on every
team's schedule can be a trying af
fair. and the Card suffered a mid
season stumble, partially because
it started to think that rankings
could win games.
6) The Cardinal cannot be
come complacent now that it is
considered an "elite" team. Some
times. lost amidst the pandemoni
um that followed Stanford's
miraculous win over Rhode Island

is that. well. Stanford beat Rhode
Island. Kansas, the No. 1 seed in
the Midwest region, watched the
game on television. The Card
would be foolish to assume that
such a fortuitous arrangement will
happen again next season.
7) If the Card wants to return to
the Final Four, every player must
step up his game a notch. Al
though junior Peter Sauer impres
sively made the transition from
small forward to power forward,
he still lacks effectiveness at the
point of attack and sometimes
struggles defensively against
quicker players.
Sophomore Mark "Mad Dog"
Madsen's enthusiastic and aggres
sive plav have endeared him to
fans and pro-scouts alike, but his
offensive game is still quite limit
ed. A little more range, better
free-throw shooting and a little fi
nesse would make Mad Dog one
of the most dangerous weapons in
the country.
Freshmen Jarron and Jason
Collins must make substantial
contributions to the Card at both
ends of the floor. Although Jarron
is one up on his twin brother, both
must mature beyond their years if
Stanford is to make a champi
onship run.
OK, so there are a lot of quali
fiers to the claim that Stanford will
win next year's NCAA tourna
ment. But hey, nobody was mak
ing claims anything like this last
year.
Stanford had a whirlwind wel
come to the nation's basketball
elite. Now it must prove it be
longs.
