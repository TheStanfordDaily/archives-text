## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
In a setback for the University, a
California court ruled this week that
a psychiatry professor has sufficient
evidence to take his case against
Stanford to trial.
Psychiatry Prof. Adolf Pfeffer
baum in August accused the Univer
sity of fraud and theft of intellectual
property, his third lawsuit related to
a dispute with Stanford that led to
his resignation from the Palo Alto
Veterans Affairs Hospital in 19%.
The University claims Pfeffer
baum's action amounted to a resig
nation from his Stanford professor
ship as well; University President
Gerhard Casper's attempt to dismiss
Pfefferbaum is scheduled to be de

bated by the Advisory Board of the
Academic Council.
The lawsuit in question is related
to grants Pfefferbaum had won to
run his Mental Health Clinical Re
search Center at the VA Hospital.
After he resigned from his VA
professorship, Stanford attempted
to renew a $1 million grant from the
National Institute of Mental Health
for schizophrenia research by nam
ing a different faculty memberas the
principal investigator. Upon failing
to win renewal, Stanford allowed the
grant to expire.
Pfefferbaum filed a lawsuit in
August charging that the Universi
ty's actions amounted to theft of in
tellectual property, and Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Robert Baines ruled that he had

provided sufficient evidence to justi
fy a trial, according to a news release
from the Coalition for Academic
Freedom and Justice. The group is
chaired by Pfefferbaum supporter
Edie Sullivan, a psychiatry profes
sor.
Stanford appealed the ruling,
which this week was upheld by a
two-judge panel of the California
Court of Appeals.
The University's actions, accord
ing to Pfefferbaum, set a dangerous
precedent in failing to protect a pro
fessor's rights to intellectual proper
ty-
"Stanford's deliberate actions —
first to transfer my grant to another
faculty member and then to allow it
to lapse — were unconscionable,"
he said.
