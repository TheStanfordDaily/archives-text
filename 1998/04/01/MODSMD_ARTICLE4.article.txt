Just call it Belt
way West.
Once a small

contributor to the Stanford student
body, the greater Washington, D.C.
area has jumped to the top of the
Farm's undergraduate feeding
pool, according to statistics re
leased yesterday by Dean of Ad
missions and Financial Aid Robert
Kinnally.
Of the 2,548 students accepted
to Stanford through regular deci
sion, more than half hail from the
District of Columbia, northern Vir

ginia or southern Maryland. Appli
cations from that area increased by
'HH) percent this year. Kinnally said.
A senior admissions official,
speaking on condition of anonymi
ty, attributed the change to a drastic
increase in applications from chil
dren of government officials.
"Overnight. Stanford has be
come the hottest place in Washing
ton to send your kids to school." she
said. "It's a craze that transcends
party lines."
Late yesterday evening. The
Daily obtained a partial list of well
known students that have been of
fered admission in the Class of
2(X)2. Among them are Jason Lott.
son of Senate Majority leader Trent

Lott (R-Miss.); Kathryn Scalia.
daughter of Supreme Court Justice
Anthony Scalia: mayoral daughter
Jenny Barry; Raphael Reno, son of
the U.S. attorney general; Harold
"Buck" Gingrich; four great-great
grandchildren of former presiden
tial candidate Bob Dole; and at
least three young women claiming
to be the illegitimate offspring of
former Secretary of State Warren
Christopher.
Kinnally refused to confirm the
list, but did offer an explanation of
the influx of Beltway interest in the
school.
"Stanford offers the rigorous
academics, caring faculty, classic ar
chitecture and healthy grade infia

tion that greatly appeal to politi
cians." he said. "And members of
Congress especially appreciate the
value of allowing their children to
rebel as far away from the [White
House] press corps as possible.
"Also, our basketball teams
swept the Washington schools in
conference play this year."
It was the first time in Stanford
history that California was not the
most-represented state in accep
tances. a fact that is not lost on kin
nally.
"It's about damn time." he said.
"We were really getting tired of
having so man> kids who expect a
top-notch education while still get
ting to go home for lunch."
