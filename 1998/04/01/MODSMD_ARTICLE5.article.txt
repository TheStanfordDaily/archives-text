## 
### Alyson Auto Staff writer 
In a shocking press conference
held late yesterday evening, the
NCAA Academic Regulations Sub
committee revealed that Harvard se
niors Allison Feaster and Alison
Seanor. both standouts on the 16th
seeded Crimson women's basketball
squad (23-4), were academically inel
igible for play against Stanford on
March 14.
Harvard had defeated Stanford
71-67 during the first round of the
NCCA tournament and eliminated
the No. 1 seed Cardinal (21-6). Due
to the ineligibility of Feaster and

Seanor. however. NCAA Academic
Standards President Christy Cum
mins has nullified the match.
A rematch will be scheduled with
in the week.
"We heard rumors that Feaster
and Seanor were beginning to do
poorly in their classes," Cummins
said. "So we conducted an investiga
tion using volunteer Secret Service
agents. Those guv's sure know how to
blend into the student crowd."
The agents, dressed inconspicu
ously as "college students," trailed
Feaster and Seanor throughout the
Harvard campus.
Feaster, the nation's leading sett
er, racked up an unimpressive 2.3

CiPA on the season and managed a
dismal .624 in Stratification in Sociol
ogy.
"I'm so sorry." Feaster said in a
phone interview. "That sociology
exam just killed me. 1 was pumped
before the exam, and I told my team
mates. Ladies, this one is for the
team." I even actually bought the text
for the class, opened it and told the
waterbov to read it for me the night
before. I did everything I possibly
could for that test. I was certain I'd
slam dunked that thing."
Cardinal forward Vanessa Ny
gaard provided the definitive evi
dence in the case when she noticed
that Feaster and Seanor, who com

pleted their exams while at Stanford,
attempted to bully the Tree into pro
viding answers for their test
After a brief skirmish, in which
Nvgaard chest-slammed Feaster and
Seanor into retreat, the subcommit
tee knew it had the proof it needed.
"Those two were just asking for
trouble." Nvgaard said "Luckily.
I've been working on my chest-slam
as of late, and I knew what I had to do.
It all happened so quickly. 1 had to
fake past Feaster and whirl around
for my ne*lv created rebound slam'
to knock over Seanor. After that,
they just pretty much ran for their
lives, but I threw in a couple more
chest slams for good measure."
