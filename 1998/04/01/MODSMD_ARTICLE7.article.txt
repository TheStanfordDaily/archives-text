### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
The University is negotiating to include the house
sandwiched between 557 Mayfield and Campus
Drive in its monopoly of Row residences.
"This particular house, because of its location,
was one we thought we should acquire," said Geof
frey Cox, vice provost and dean for institution plan
ning.
The Dunn-Bacon house is one of only a few hous
es within the Campus Drive loop that is still private

ly owned.
"It's part of the University's long-term plan to
have the properties within the Campus Drive loop."
explained Carolyn Sargent, director of faculty staff
housing.
According to the land lease agreement, the Uni
versity has the first option to buy the house at mar
ket value if its senior staff residents move out, and if
the University doesn't want to purchase the house, it
can only be sold to a senior staff member. The Uni-

versity already owns the land the
house is on.
"It's a bit like having your house
in the middle of the freeway and hav
ing to sell it to Caltrans," said Charlie
Bacon, who is negotiating the sale on
behalf of his mother, Rosamond.
"You don't have a choice."
When his mother moved out last
fall, talks between Bacon and the
University began.
According to Bacon, negotia
tions are still proceeding, but stu
dent groups on campus are already
making plans for the house. Cox ad
mitted the University has already
engaged in discussions with a num
ber of groups regarding the house,
but he had no comment about any
of the groups or the discussions
specifically.
Representatives from both the
Newman Center Catholic Commu
nity at Stanford and the Hillel
Foundation have looked at the
house since the negotiations start
ed. Bacon said.
Jewish community members are
particularly optimistic when it
comes to acquiring the house. In an
e-mail. Rabbi Yoel Kahn stated the

Hillel group "expects to acquire"
the House. He added, "According
to our current plan, renovation will
begin this coming fall, with occu
pancy of the renovated building
(beginning) in fall 1999."
"T he space in the Old Union is
very cramped and really quite inad
equate for the size of our opera
tion," said Robert Rosenweig, pres
ident ol the board of directors of the
Hillel Foundation.
Hillel hopes to have expanded
office, meeting and greeting space.
If it acquires the house, Hillel
plans to build a second structure on
the property.
Changes to the house and its
grounds could meet opposition by
historians. The Stanford Historical
Society, 650 members strong, has
taken an ongoing interest in the
house.
Stanford Archivist Maggie Kim
ball stated that converting the
building to office space or building
on the property could damage the
historical integrity of the 99-year
old building.
"The Historical Society is very
concerned about the house and its
use in the future," Kimball said
The Stanford Historical Society
is including the house in its upcom
ing faculty house tour on April 26.
