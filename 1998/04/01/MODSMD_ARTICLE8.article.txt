## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Two female doctors have filed
lawsuits alleging discrimination at
the Stanford Medical Center.
In documents tiled with the
Santa Clara County Superior Court
in March. Katherine O'Hanlan and
Amrita Dosanjh accused Stanford
and its School of Medicine of sever
al wrongdoings, including making
their work environments uncom
fortable. paying them less than male

doctors and failing to promote or
reappoint them.
The lawsuits come on the heels of
a report released in February by the
Women's ( oalition for (iender Eq
uity, which criticized Stanford for
hiring and promoting too few
women, in addition to failing to en
courage a supportive environment
for female faculty. The report fo
cused on the Medical School and the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
O'Hanlan, an assistant professor
of gynecology and obstetrics at the

Medical School from 1990-96,
claims Stanford denied her equal
pay and a promotion because of her
gender and sexual orientation, as
well as misrepresenting her record
and concealing information from
her that would have guided her pro
fessional development.
The result, according to the law
suit. is that due to "intentional inflic
tion of emotional distress upon her.
lO'Hanlanl suffered special dam
ages, including but not limited to in
jury to [her] reputation, business
profits and professional standing."
The suit names as individual de
fendants Medical School Dean Eu
gene Bauer, Obstetrics and Gyne
cology Department Chair Mary
Lake Polan, Gynecological Oncolo
gy Division Director Nelson Teng
and Gynecology and Obstetrics
Prof. Maurice Dru/.in, chair of the
committee that denied O'Hanlan's
promotion.
The promotion was denied,
O'Hanlan wrote in the lawsuit, de
spite her excellent reputation as a
teacher, researcher and surgeon.
O'Hanlan has won several local and
national awards and nominations
and earned a spot in the Guiness
Book of World Records for remov
ing the world's largest known ovari
an mass from a woman at the Stan
ford Medical Center.
In 1991, O'Hanlan, a lesbian, au
thored a bill to extend benefits to ho
mosexual domestic partners em

ployed by Stanford. In her first per
formance review shortly after the
Board of Trustees passed the bill in
December 1992, O'Hanlan claims
she was criticized for "offending"
and "alienating" male doctors.
Polan later suggested that O'Hanlan
"knock off that lesbian stuff," ac
cording to the lawsuit.
The performance review also
pointed to a lack of scholarly publi
cations and a shortage in patient
billings, which O'Hanlan had im
proved on during the following
years, the lawsuit says.
In 1995, the Medical Center re
vised its promotions guidelines,
making the major criterion excel
lence in clinical teaching and clinical
medicine, both areas in which
O'Hanlan had received recognition.
Despite that, the committee
headed by Druzin — who O'Hanlan
claims had told Teng he "hated" her
— recommended against reappoint
ment and promotion, saying her
clinical performance was substan
dard.
Dosanjh, a staff physician in pedi
atrics at the Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital, alleges discrim

ination based on national origin,
race and gender and "harassment in
employment" resulting in her termi
nation without explanation in Feb
ruary.
The only non-white physician in
the Pediatric Pulmonary Division,
Dosanjh said she was paid less than
other employees and continues to
suffer from disparaging comments
made about her professionalism.
She names Pediatrics Prof.
Richard Moss as a defendant, along
with Stanford University, the Board
of Trustees and the Medical Center.
During Dosanjh's two years at Stan
ford. Moss "engaged in behavior de
signed to harass and intimidate
[her], including ... impeding her re
search efforts, embarrassing her in
front of other physicians, nurses and
other medical personnel, and pre
venting her from doing the duties
she was hired to perform." accord
ing to the lawsuit.
Medical Center Communica
tions Director Laurel Joyce said the
University had not seen Dosanjh's
suit yet and had no comment. No
one could be reached for comment
on O'Hanlan's charges.
