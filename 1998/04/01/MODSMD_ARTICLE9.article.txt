# New cancer clinic in works
## Center will bring all Stanford specialists under one roof 
### Bimal Shah Senior staff writer 
The Board of Directors of UC-San Francisco Stan
ford Health Care has approved funding for a new out
patient care facility at Stanford.
The building will house the Center for Cancer
Treatment and Prevention and the Ambulatory Care
Pavilion for outpatient surgical procedures.
The new facility — at 218.(KM) square feet — will be
located adjacent to Stanford Hospital and Lucile
Salter Packard Children's Hospital.
The new center will occupy most of the building,
bringing together most of Stanford's cancer specialists
under one roof.
This arrangement has several advantages, accord
ing to Charlotte Jacobs, professor of medicine and di
rector of the Clinical Cancer Center, a program that
encompasses all cancer treatment at Stanford.
"The management of cancer has changed dramati
cally," Jacobs said. The optimal way of treating cancer

is with combined modality teams, where man\ spe
cialists work on a patient's case together, she ex
plained.
"It's no longer acceptable for a patient to just go
from one specialist to another." Jacobs said.
The facility will ser\e as the 24-hour infusion cen
ter that is necessary for outpatient care and pro\ ides a
way to bring new therapies forward. Furthermore, the
facility will make treatment more convenient for can
cer patients and their families. Jacobs said.
Significant amounts of clinical research will also
take place at the center, providing patients with access
to the latest treatments.
"This has been tried at other institutions and has
not worked." Jacobs said of efforts to bring cancer
treatments under one roof. In many cases, not all the
specialists wanted to work together, but at Stanford
they do. she explained.
Part of the reason for this difference is that man\
medical centers mistakenly build
new facilities without seeking input
from their future inhabitants. In
contrast, the planning for the new
cancer center was done by groups
of representatives from all the
components that would use the fa
cility.
An application for the construc
tion of the new facility is currently
awaiting approval from the City of
Stanford HcfspiuL
"Sfid"tt(c'Lu?ilc Packard Children's

Hospital are both on land that's
under the jurisdiction of Palo
Alto." Director of Community Re
lations Andy Coe explained.
After an environmental review,
the project will undergo public re
view by the Palo Alto Planning
Commission and City Council, a
process that will take about one
year. Coe said.
"We think the project ultimate
ly will be approved by the city
council."he said. But, he added,
"Palo Alto will take a serious and
rigorous look at it."
( . center will likely
completion in 2001, Coe said.
