At least 15 million
Americans already
have the virus that
causes them.
Human papillomavirus (I IPV), the virus that
causcs genital warts, is the most common sexually
transmitted disease in the United States today.
In fact, an average of 750,000 new cases of genital
warts are diagnosed each year. And il s estimated
that 11 million people who have the virus that
causes genital warts don't even know it.
Genital warts are not always obvious. They can
be small or large and appear alone or in clusters
outside or inside the body. Many genital warts
can only be found by a healthcare provider.
It's still not possible to cure lIPV But, by getting
rid of the warts, healthcare providers hope to get
the virus under control. There are many types of
I IPV infections, some causing external warts and
others affecting the cervix. It is important for
women to see their healthcare providers regularly
for pelvic exams and Pap smears. And, because
men and women can pass the virus to sex partners,
they should see a healthcare provider whenever
genital warts or HPV are suspected.
Genital warts don't just happen to other people.
If you notice any unusual bumps or growths in
the genital area, or if your partner has had genital
warts or I IPV, see your healthcare provider.
