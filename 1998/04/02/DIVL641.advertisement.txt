Here are some comments from past interns:
Intern for the Pacifica Tribune
" The editor let me try a little of everything, including news, features, sports, and even
a personal column. The staff at the Tribune made me feel welcome immediately, and
I learned a lot about community journalism."
Intern for the Mountain View Voice

the newspaper, from writing, to advertising to layout."
Intern for the Sonoma Index-Tribune
"I've done features, covered two fatal car crashes, and interviewed local officials on a wide
range of subjects. There's nothing like the experience of working at a community-oriented
weekly newspaper, and I love it...l've been hired as a reporter"
