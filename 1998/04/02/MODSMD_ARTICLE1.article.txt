neering-economic systems student
Nwokoro Duru Ahanotu will deliv
er speeches on Founders' Day start
ing at 11:30 a.m.
Hammond and Ahanotu were
selected from a group of 65 student
contenders who took part in a
speech competition earlier this
year. Each of the two will receive
$4,000. According to Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais, head of the com
mittee in charge of promoting
Founders' Day, speeches were se

lected by a student committee on
the basis of excellence and rele
vance to the Founders' Day theme:
a recognition of University history
and commemoration of the found
ing family.
"I don't think anyone should ex
pect to have a dry eye in Memorial
Church during the speeches ... it
will be a truly impassioned ceremo
ny," Wais said.
After the service at Memorial
Church, a complementary barbe

cue lunch will be served in the Main
Ouad to the backdrop of music pro
vided by the Stanford Jazz Band.
Contributing to the intended his
torical atmosphere of the event will
be enlarged archival pictures of the
University arranged around the
Main (Juad.
In order to increase campus
awareness surrounding the event,
Wais and fellow coordinators have
been occupied posting advertise
ments, making announcements at

house meetings, distributing
Founders' Day buttons as well as
contacting alumni in regards to the
event. Last year, S(X) people came
out for the Founders' Day celebra
tions. Wais is expecting even more
this year.
"Students and all other Stanford
affiliates shouldn't give up an op
portunity to mingle with the presi
dent. provosts, students, faculty
