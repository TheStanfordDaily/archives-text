Breast cancer death rate higher among blacks
ATLANTA (AP) — A study of why the breast cancer death rate
is higher among black women than among whites suggests that
unequal access to health care is only part of the explanation. The
study was conducted at military hospitals, where supposedly every
body has the same access to treatment.
It found that among the military women, the black-white gap in
the breast-cancer death rate was much smaller than it is among
wflmen in the general population.
Researchers have long recognized black women's higher death
rate from breast cancer and have speculated that the factors could
inelude not only inadequate access to health care, but also genetics,
diet, culture and lifestyle differences, such as use of alcohol and
tobacco.
Researchers at the Army Medical Department Center and
School at Fort Sam Houston compared military medical records of
6,577 women. 698 of whom were black, who were diagnosed with
breast cancer between 1975 and 1994.
They found the five-year mortality rate for black women was
24.77 percent, compared with 18.08 percent for white women.
The study did not include data on whether the women had mam
mograms.
The researchers now are analyzing the use of mammograms and
other factors that could have contributed to the disparity.
Dr. Harold Freeman, director of surgery at New York's Harlem
.Hospital Center and chairman of the President's Cancer Panel, said
it's possible the black women did not receive the same treatment as
white women.
-Study on blood substitute ends
HOUSTON (AP) — A pharmaceutical company abruptly halted
it>study of a blood substitute in U.S. emergency room patients after
discovering they were dying at a higher rate than expected.
. ' But tests are continuing with emergency care patients in Europe
Vrtd with elective surgery patients in the United States because they
have shown no evidence of a higher death rate.
Healthcare Corp. of Deerfield, 111., ended the trauma
patient study Tuesday after a review of the first 100 participants
showed people given the artificial blood product, Hem Assist, died
at*a greater rate than those who did not receive it, said Mary
Thomas, a Baxter spokeswoman.
The company refused to give the exact number of patients who
died or the exact number of those who received Hem Assist. Studies
showed that if 50 patients were given the blood substitute, at least 20
died.
