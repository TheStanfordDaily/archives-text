# Judge dismisses Jones lawsuit
## Alleged conduct did not constitute sexual assault 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -
In a legal victory for President Clin
ton. a federal judge yesterday
threw out Paula Jones' civil lawsuit,
saying her evidence fell "far short"
of proving sexual harassment.
"While the court will certainly
agree that plaintiffs' allegations
describe offensive conduct, the
court ... has found that the gover
nor's alleged conduct does not con
stitute sexual assault," U.S. District
Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled.
"The plaintiffs' allegations fall
far short of the rigorous standards
for establishing a claim of outrage
under Arkansas law," she ruled in a
39-page decision.
President Clinton is "pleased
that he has received the vindication
he has long awaited," said his chief
spokesman, Mike McCurry, who
was traveling with Clinton in
Africa.
The Rutherford Institute, which
has been paying the legal costs of
Jones' suit against Clinton, said.
"We will appeal this decision to the
Bth Circuit Court of Appeals imme
diately and confidently seek
redress for Jones' grievances for as
long as is necessary, even to the
Supreme Court of the United
States."
An embattled White House
immediately cheered the news,
which comes more than three years
after Jones first filed a lawsuit
alleging Clinton made an unwanted
sexual advance in a Little Rock,
Ark. hotel room in 1991.
At the time. Clinton was
Arkansas governor and Jones was a
state worker.

The Clinton's attorney, Robert
Bennett, hailed Webber's ruling as
a "very strong and very powerful
opinion."
Bennett had argued that Jones'
case was motivated by politics and
had failed to show she was harmed.
"I think we were very strong on
the facts and on the law," Bennett
said outside his law offices.
Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said he was not "par
ticularly surprised" by the judge's
ruling but said he did not think it
would have any impact on the con
tinuing investigation by Whitewa
ter prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
"I think there has been pressure
on him to get to a conclusion." Lott
said, "but it's pretty hard for him to
get to a conclusion when the White
House won't submit facts or tell the
truth."
Wright's ruling comes more
than three years after Jones first
went to court alleging Clinton, as
Arkansas governor, made an
unwanted sexual advance.
Clinton's lawyers had said that
even if he had asked Jones for sex
on May N. 1991. at a Little Rock
hotel room, the case against him
was "veneer-thin" because there
was no proof that she suffered in
her state job. as she alleged. Clin
ton was Arkansas governor at the
time.
Her employment records
showed that she received regular
raises â€” and Clinton's lawyers said
one of her most serious allegations
of ill treatment after the alleged
incident was that she didn't receive
flowers on Secretary's Dav one

year.
The judge took note that Jones
continued to work at the Arkansas
Industrial Development Commis
sion for another 19 months and
never filed a formal complaint or
told her supervisors of the incident.
"The court has determined that
her quid pro quo and hostile work
environment sexual harassment

claim are without merit and war
rant a grant of summary judg
ment." the judge said.
The judge wrote that whatever
went on in the hotel room, it"was
brief and isolated: did not result in
any physical harm ... did not result
in distress so severe that no reason
able person could be expected to
endure it."
