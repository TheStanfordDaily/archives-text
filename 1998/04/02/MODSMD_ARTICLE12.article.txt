## Editorial Wanted: More housing 
### 
Long-term solutions are
necessary for campus
housing shortage

THE SINGLE. It is a coveted
and rare commodity on the
Stanford campus. And for
graduate students next year, it will
become even rarer. While the Univer
sity's recent decision to convert rooms
in several graduate residences into
one-room doubles will temporarily
mitigate the graduate housing crisis, a
long-term solution is needed.
The danger of "short-term" solu
tions are that they tend to overstay
their welcome. It would be a mistake
to settle for the converted doubles and
the minor changes in facilitating off
campus housing. In the long run, the
University must either build more
housing or stop accepting more stu
dents than it can house.
As long as Silicon Valley industries
continue to boom, students are going
to have a hard time competing with
salaried yuppies for housing in the sur
rounding communities.
One possible long-term solution is
to reconfigure existing graduate hous
ing facilities like Crothers Hall and
Crothers Memorial Hall. This does not
mean cramming more students into the
rooms already built. It means knocking
down the old structures to make way
for better-designed buildings that can
house more students. This would also
avoid developing new land.

Another alternative is to help stu
dents find affordable off-campus hous
ing. The University might buy off-cam
pus housing and make it available to
students. This would keep students
from having to compete with non-stu
dent renters.
Jhe University should also work on
coating a more helpful off-campus
housing office. Improvements might
focus on maintaining an updated log of
available housing options and aiding
students in contacting landowners and
making rental arrangements.
What if all of these solutions just
won't cut it? It is painful to contem
plate, but judging from the short sup
ply of housing for both undergraduate
and graduate students, there are just
too many people on campus to fit com
fortably in current residential space.
In the past, facilities such as Mir
rielees, which once housed graduate
students, have been given over to
undergraduates. Painful as it may be, it
might be necessary to restrict the size
of entering freshman classes until
there is adequate space on campus for
all students.
We recognize the short-term bene
fit of reconfiguring existing rooms to
create space for graduate students.
However, this solution must be tem
porary if graduate students are to be
satisfied with their quality of life at
Stanford.
New construction or better off-cam
pus options is necessary if the Univer
sity wants to keep top-notch graduate
students coming to Stanford.
