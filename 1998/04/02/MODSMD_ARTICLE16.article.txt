## Cardinal convert confessions 
### 
I AM NOT a big sports
fan. I don't even like
to play sports. Like T.,
S. Garp (and John Irving/
for that matter), I have a
particular aversion to
sports involving a ball. In
high school 1 ran cross
country and long-distance
.. -j:J ; i _ i 11

track because they didn't involve a ball.
Let me elaborate. I am not a big Stanford
sports fan. Friends of mine who go to other
schools get more excited about Stanford
sports than 1 do. My mother even calls me
when she sees game results on the evening
news or in the newspaper.
My mother, who once thought the Bulls
were a football team.
Sure, I've been aware of the talented
individuals associated with Stanford —
Olympic stars like Pablo Morales and Sum
mer Sanders, international stars like Tiger
Woods. But they've always represented
themselves, not Stanford.
1 mean, how many people come to Stan
ford primarily because our sports are so
great? j.
I have never been to Big Game. The only
football game I went to was during freshman
orientation. Since it was about 1(X) degrees
in the shade and Stanford was losing, I left
during halftime. In addition to one women's

crew race, that is the extent to which I have
attended Stanford sports events.
I guess it's the lack of what used to be
such a big deal in high school — that amor
phous thing called school spirit. Something
that you kind of bought into even if it made
you sit in a stuffy gym and watch cheerlead
ers do endless routines to MC Hammer dur
ing pep rallies. Maybe you just didn't know
any better.
Stanford just isn't the kind of place
where that happens on a campus-wide
scale. The Stanford Band is amusing, the
Tree is amusing, the Dollies are even more
amusing — but what's all the fuss about? 1
have enough trouble explaining to people
that Stanford's mascot is a pine tree with
googly eyes pasted across its midsection,
and that "Cardinal" refers to the color, not
the Pope or the bird.
That changed for me over a week ago
when the Stanford men's basketball team
made the Final Four. For the first time. I
watched an entire basketball game on tele
vision, agonizing, cheering and hyperventi
lating. One minute left in the game and 1 was
ready to leave the room (I am a poor loser).
But I'm glad I stuck it out.
Maybe it's because I was here on campus
during spring break and that there was
extensive coverage of Stanford basketball. It
was advertised all over the place, from the

Bookstore to the shops on University
Avenue. The hoopla made me wonder why
there wasn't as much of a fuss last year when
the women's basketball team made the
Final Four.
Still. I was gobbling it up. I faithfully re id.
watched and listened to the hype during flie
heady week between playing Rhode Ishiiid
and Kentucky. It's refreshing to hear about
Stanford in a different light — not just asym
elitist, prestigious, Nobel Pri/e-winnijig
school. ,
As I got ready to watch the Stanford
Cardinal vs. the Kentucky Wildcats. I
empathized with soccer fans. Now I can
understand what makes people dye their
hair the color of their favorite team or start
riots. (Although I will never understand the
appeal of the Super Bowl.)
Can it be that I am finally starting to feel
something lor a Stanford sport? Incredible!
But so is the men's basketball team.
Despite the Stanford men's loss to Ken
tucky, I've been converted. Maybe this
quarter I'll attend a sports event. Maybe I'll
even sign up for an intramural event - as
long as il doesn't involve a ball.

Wendy Lee, a senior majoring in modern
thought and literature, still doesn't under
stand statistically why it is better to foul the
winning team with one minute left to play.
