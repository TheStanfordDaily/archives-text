Political and cultural
wills must coordinate
Youth is advantageous because it typi
fies dynamism, optimism, swagger and
curiosity. This young nation describes
itself using all of these terms, and addi
tionally, with two others — acrimony and
self doubt.
Affirmative action complements the
optimism and dynamism of a remarkable
political experiment (a nation based on
ideas and ideals, not bloodlines and
churches), but it confounds citizens
because of national acrimony and self
doubt. -
Now, let's move imo national maturity
and stop hating our lineage because it is
not white only, but is in fact, brown, yel
low, black, red and white. It is not fair for
us to despise and chide our nonwhite lin
eage.
Political will (affirmative action) must
connect to cultural will.
Crocodile tears lament "multicultural
ism." but multiculturalism as it is often
taught is handed down paternalistically.
Those tears come from fear and appre
hension — and who would not be afraid
when one's hegemony is challenged?
I am told that some minorities perform
poorly on standardized tests. But which

element is the original: the polemic
against minority achievement and intelli
gence (capability) or the apprehension of
tests among minorities? If you are of a sus
pect class, do you not suspect and expect
the worst?
The LSAT, SAT, ORE, and MCAT
"don't simply produce a stigma in certain
minority populations; the tests witness the
actualizing ability of the polemical narra
tive, which states that "minorities perform
poorly on standardized tests" is axiomatic.
Creative minds must define a new cul
tural will which complements the muddled
nature of our national skin tone; cultural
will must join with political will in the
form of affirmative action.
The LSAT is objective? The MCAT?
The (iRE? Occam's Razor only applies
among folks with shared paradigms.
Those tests are not gospel from above.
I recall boosting my SAT and LSAT
scores, via self-study, more than 12 per
centile points each, in part because I disre
garded the polemic stating that "minori
ties perform poorly on standardized
tests," *
My proud African father and white
mother openly ridiculed the stories that
media, politics and impolite conversations
developed
I performed well on the SAT; I gained
a wind at my back. The LSAT came; I had
the wind at my back, and I breezed

through that as well. This nation blows
forward some and blows back others. Cul
tural esteem is cumulative.
This young nation seeks mature
form. The lineages — red, black, yellow,
brown, white — compete for institutional
representation in a finite political econo
my.
Bad habits from the past and the inertia
of political and cultural inequality make
this adolescence acrimonious. Affirmative
action attacks the political circumstance.
New authors — lay persons, academics,
clergy, the government — are burdened to
fashion the complementary cultural will.
There has to be a national authorship.
Though not through "political correct
ness," which makes people sneer as they
rear-guard their private political economy.
Instead, it requires the cessation of cultur
al inertia. Political will (affirmative action)
needs direct entanglement and innovation
with cultural will.
