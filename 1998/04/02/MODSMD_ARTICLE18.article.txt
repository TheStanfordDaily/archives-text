DEAR MR JAMFS Montoya,
It's really too had the w;iv things
have turned out. Just last year, it
seemed like things were looking up lor
.jioiir office. Your appointment as vice
provost for student affairs was widely
regarded as a good deal for students. You
had a reputation for being one ol Stan
ford's more capable administrators, and
you said all the right things about improv
in&student life.
*Jt's been all the more baffling, then, to
the work you've done so far. As you
have announced and implemented a flurry
of policies related to undergraduate hous
ing, you and your office have developed a
prtfir record of working with students in
sgryice of our needs.
You are in the midst of implementing a
byzantine and unworkable report on stu
dent housing — one that will give Res I d
an even bigger role in the daily lives of shi
dents, will limit Draw choices and will
require ever more stall to administer.
Undergraduates mostly oppose these
cfranges, but you don't seem to think that's
very important.
(Readers please note: I'm talking about

the Report of the Task 112 orce on Residen
tial Programs and Student Housing for
Undergraduates, which you can find at
www-leland.Stanford.edu/group/assu/'l ask
Force/.)
By following the task force's recom
mendations, you are beginning a heart
breaking process ol destroying stable stu
dent communities in order to create a sys
tem only a bureaucrat could love.
II the report were fully implemented.
Stanford would see houses segregated by
grade, gender, ethnicity, advising system,
whether or not one is writing an honors
thesis. .. the list is as endless as it is
absurd.
If you do this, you will create a campus
environment with all the charm and digni
ty of Sarajevo. Moreover, you will have
done something that students didn't ask
you to do and will hate the results of.
Apart from the report, the housing
changes you've made this year are capri
cious. For example, the decision to make
I'oyon all sophomore was made at the last
minute as you looked at the numerical
consequences ol creating so many new all
lreshman dorms. But you seem to have

paid little attention to the effect the
change will have on the eating club system.
You administrators say good things will
emerge from the chaos. Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education Ramon Sal
divar says he is excited about the ability to
bring sophomore advising into 'I'oyon as
an integral part of the dorm's program
ming.
If students are not equally excited. I'm
sure they're curious to learn what sort of
bastard child the marriage of Res Fid and
our mediocre undergraduate advising pro
gram will produce.
Next year promises even more annoy
ing alterations. Poor 'I'oyon residents will
sutler through repeated majors fairs at din
ner time. And if you have your way.
juniors and seniors will be bombarded with
job placement seminars in their dorm
lounges. Who needs Alpha Sig now that
we have the prospect of a career planning
theme dorm?
Your implementation of the report
might be less disturbing it student affairs
had established a record this year of work
ing for student interests. But it hasn't. And
Res Fd. an office vou oversee, has been

outright hostile towards students as it
seeks to implement its plans.
One of the most disturbing examples is
Director of Residential Education Jane
( amarillo's decision to liquidate the
Alpha Sig house. By her own account, she
didn't start thinking about which houses to
give away to sororities until a week before
the decision was due. She had five business
days to consider her decision, and in that
time came to the lully researched conclu
sion that it would be a good idea to elimi
nate one of the most socially important
houses on campus, and one with significant
student support.
Why would she do this? Camarillo says
she relied on the Row office for her deci
sion. which is unfortunate because rather
than being a constructive force, the Row
office has spent much of the past couple of
years dismantling the student management
system in its houses.
However, the decision was made with
out any concern for student desires. Do
you see a pattern emerging?
At the end of last quarter, one sixth of
the undergraduate student body signed a
petition asking you and Res Ed to recon

sider its decision to dehouse Alpha Sig.
Res F:d didn't even respond to the peti
tion. Neither did you.
Students met with you personally, con
cerned that Res Ed had not made this deci
sion fairly or honestly. You responded that
you wouldn't he re-examining Res Ed
decisions because that would he "micro
managing."
About the only response to students
was a short letter from Camarillo to Alpha
Sig complaining that students there didn't
form the kind of community that Res Ed
prefers. But what happens if the vast
majority of students want something dif
ferent than Res Ed in their campus hous
ing experience?
When, exactly, did student affairs and
Res Ed goals become more important than
students? And why should students trust
or support your housing reforms when
you've given us ample reason not to?
These are rhetorical questions, but feel
free to answer them. Unless, of course, you
can't.
