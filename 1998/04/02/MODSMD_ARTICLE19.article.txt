### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
After fighting off a huge upset
bid oy Harvard, the top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team
turned it up a notch and went on to
win (he remainder of its spring break
dual|matches in blowout fashion.
most Cardinal fans had
theif eyes set on San Antonio,
Tex£s, and men's basketball, the No.
1 defending champion women's ten
nis tfcam (18-0) was busy demolish
ing ljfth-ranked Texas 5-1 just down
the load in Austin. One day earlier,
Stanford warmed up for its top-10
with the Longhorns by down
ing SIo. 35 Texas A&M in a 5-1 win.
"J think Texas was our breakout
Stanford head coach Frank
Brefinan said. "I had told the girls
thatiwe needed to start roiling over
people. We had a lot of 5-4 wins,
whicjh proved we were really tough.
We }iad to prove then that we were
good. We had to start making
statements."
I*he Cardinal did just that in bull

dozing a Longhorn squad on its
home court. Back from an ankle in
jury that kept her out of the home

Three other Stanford competi
tors also notched straight-set wins
for the Cardinal. Austin native Julie
Scott — up at No. 4 in the latest sin
gles rankings — edged Texas' Cristi
na Moros 7-6,7-5.
In the No. 4 spot, senior Ania
Bleszynski rolled, defeating
Longhorn Kim Gates 6-4, 6-2.
Sophomore Jennifer Heiser took
advantage of a first set win by

denying a Texas bid to split sets
and recording a 6-1, 6-4 win over
Nomena Rasolomalaia.
Freshman Sarah Pestieau re
fused to let inexperience be a factor
in her No. 5 singles match against
Texas veteran Laura Berendt.
Pestieau outlasted Berendt in three
sets 6-4,6-7,7-5.
The Longhorns avoided an all
out Cardinal sweep by taking the
No. 3 singles match. Michelle Panth
er's three-set victory over Stanford
sophomore Teryn Ashley marked
the first loss hy Ashley in her entire
Stanford dual-match career.
" That was quite a run," Brennan
said. "But I think it is good for Teryn
that it is over. Now she doesn't have
the undefeated pressure anymore.
That was a real upset, but we aren't
worried about Teryn at all. We
know she can play "
Doubles play was suspended
after Stanford clinched the win.
It was much the same story on the
previous day against an over
matched Aggies squad. Each of
Stanford's five singles wins came in

straight sets. Still recovering from
the ankle injury. Kremer competed
in the third singles spot and rolled 6-
0,6-1.
Stanford did not miss a heat with
Scott in the top spot as she cruised 6-
4. 6-3. Ashley, Bleszynski and Heis
er also registered straight-set victo
ries. The Aggies earned their lone
point in the No. 6 match in which
Eva Marcial edged the C ardinal's
Marissa MacLennan in two
marathon sets 7-6, 7-6.
At the beginning of the week,
however, the Cardinal barely es
caped California without blemishing
its perfect dual-match record.
Upset-minded Harvard had Stan
ford on the ropes at 4-4 with one
match remaining, but seniors Scott
and Bleszynski held on in the No. 1
doubles match K-6.
Rain forced an atypical dual
match format for the meeting be
tween the then-No. 2 Cardinal and
the No. 25 Crimson. Some of the
matches were held on the Taube

then went on to beat Texas and Texas A&M to preserve the team's
perfect 18-0 dual match record.
Family Tennis Stadium's indoor
court while others were held at an in
door venue in Fremont.
"It was really an awkward match
since we didn't know what was going
on at the other location," Brennan
said. "The girls just assumed that the
others were doing all right. The situ
ation was really ripe for the upset.
[Harvard] likes playing indoors; they
have been indoors all winter."
With Scott and Bleszynski lead
ing 7-4, Brennan decided to keep the
4-4 score to himself. But Harvard's
squad of Ivy Wang and Rosemary
She climbed right back into the
match, and Brennan chose to notify
his seniors.
"When we were up 7-5 with Ania
serving. I decided to tell them that
this was the match," Brennan said.
"They didn't believe me — they
thought I was kidding. So 1 an

nounced it to the entire crowd on the
indoor court. Ania tightened up on
her service game and we lost to go to
7-6, but the seniors pulled it out.
"1 was reduced to a basket case
though."
The Crimson kept it tight by tak
ing two singles matches and the
other doubles matches. Scott, Ash
ley, Pestieau and Heiser earned
Stanford singles wins while Harvard
took the No. 3 and No. b matches.
Brennan was forced to shake up
the lineup a bit clue to Kleiner's ankle
injury; she only played doubles.
"We did have Anne out," Bren
nan said. "We are not comfortable
with her out of the lineup, but we
thought we would be OK."
In the rankings, Stanford re
turned to the top spot it occupied fol
lowing the team's win in last year's
NCAA Championships. The jump
from the No. 5 spot was motivated
by the undefeated start, a title at the
National Team Indoors Champi
onship in February and a 37 dual

match win streak dating back to last
season.
Florida, who is also undefeated
and was rated No. 1 throughout this
season, mysteriously dropped into a
tie for No. 3 with Georgia.
"1 don't know how that hap
pened," said Brennan, who speculat
ed after the indoor title that the Car
dinal would move to No. 2 behind
the Gators. "I'm not sure 1 want to
be No. 1 at this point, but I guess
we'll take it."
The Cardinal returns to confer
ence play this weekend with a road
trip to Los Angeles to meet IJCLA
and DSC. The Bruins, who were
ranked as high as No. 2 at one point
this season, have dropped from the
elite due to numerous injuries and
subsequent dual-match losses.
This weekend marks the first
time this season that the Cardinal
will see either the Bruins or the Tro

make a return visit to Taube Family
Tennis Stadium in two weeks.

Sophomore Jennifer Heiser took
advantage of a first set win by

denying a Texas bid to split sets
and recording a 6-1, 6-4 win over
Nomena Rasolomalaia.
Freshman Sarah Pestieau re
fused to let inexperience be a factor
in her No. 5 singles match against
Texas veteran Laura Berendt.
Pestieau outlasted Berendt in three
sets 6-4,6-7,7-5.
The Longhorns avoided an all
out Cardinal sweep by taking the
No. 3 singles match. Michelle Panth
er's three-set victory over Stanford
sophomore Teryn Ashley marked
the first loss hy Ashley in her entire
Stanford dual-match career.
" That was quite a run," Brennan
said. "But I think it is good for Teryn
that it is over. Now she doesn't have
the undefeated pressure anymore.
That was a real upset, but we aren't
worried about Teryn at all. We
know she can play "
Doubles play was suspended
after Stanford clinched the win.
It was much the same story on the
previous day against an over
matched Aggies squad. Each of
Stanford's five singles wins came in

straight sets. Still recovering from
the ankle injury. Kremer competed
in the third singles spot and rolled 6-
0,6-1.
Stanford did not miss a heat with
Scott in the top spot as she cruised 6-

er also registered straight-set victo
ries. The Aggies earned their lone
point in the No. 6 match in which
Eva Marcial edged the C ardinal's
Marissa MacLennan in two
marathon sets 7-6, 7-6.
At the beginning of the week,
however, the Cardinal barely es
caped California without blemishing
its perfect dual-match record.
Upset-minded Harvard had Stan
ford on the ropes at 4-4 with one
match remaining, but seniors Scott
and Bleszynski held on in the No. 1
doubles match K-6.
Rain forced an atypical dual
match format for the meeting be
tween the then-No. 2 Cardinal and
the No. 25 Crimson. Some of the
matches were held on the Taube

Sophomore Anne Kremer returns a ball against Arizona last month.
Over spring break, her team barely survived a run by Harvard and
then went on to beat Texas and Texas A&M to preserve the team's
perfect 18-0 dual match record.
Family Tennis Stadium's indoor
court while others were held at an in
door venue in Fremont.
"It was really an awkward match
since we didn't know what was going
on at the other location," Brennan
said. "The girls just assumed that the
others were doing all right. The situ
ation was really ripe for the upset.
[Harvard] likes playing indoors; they
have been indoors all winter."
With Scott and Bleszynski lead
ing 7-4, Brennan decided to keep the
4-4 score to himself. But Harvard's
squad of Ivy Wang and Rosemary
She climbed right back into the
match, and Brennan chose to notify
his seniors.
"When we were up 7-5 with Ania
serving. I decided to tell them that
this was the match," Brennan said.
"They didn't believe me — they
thought I was kidding. So 1 an

nounced it to the entire crowd on the
indoor court. Ania tightened up on
her service game and we lost to go to
7-6, but the seniors pulled it out.
"1 was reduced to a basket case
though."
The Crimson kept it tight by tak
ing two singles matches and the
other doubles matches. Scott, Ash
ley, Pestieau and Heiser earned
Stanford singles wins while Harvard
took the No. 3 and No. b matches.
Brennan was forced to shake up
the lineup a bit clue to Kleiner's ankle
injury; she only played doubles.
"We did have Anne out," Bren
nan said. "We are not comfortable
with her out of the lineup, but we
thought we would be OK."
In the rankings, Stanford re
turned to the top spot it occupied fol
lowing the team's win in last year's
NCAA Championships. The jump
from the No. 5 spot was motivated
by the undefeated start, a title at the
National Team Indoors Champi
onship in February and a 37 dual

match win streak dating back to last
season.
Florida, who is also undefeated
and was rated No. 1 throughout this
season, mysteriously dropped into a
tie for No. 3 with Georgia.
"1 don't know how that hap
pened," said Brennan, who speculat
ed after the indoor title that the Car
dinal would move to No. 2 behind
the Gators. "I'm not sure 1 want to
be No. 1 at this point, but I guess
we'll take it."
The Cardinal returns to confer
ence play this weekend with a road
trip to Los Angeles to meet IJCLA
and DSC. The Bruins, who were
ranked as high as No. 2 at one point
this season, have dropped from the
elite due to numerous injuries and
subsequent dual-match losses.
This weekend marks the first
time this season that the Cardinal
will see either the Bruins or the Tro
jans. Both UCLA and USC will
make a return visit to Taube Family
Tennis Stadium in two weeks.
