win (he remainder of its spring break
dual|matches in blowout fashion.
most Cardinal fans had
theif eyes set on San Antonio,
Tex£s, and men's basketball, the No.
1 defending champion women's ten
nis tfcam (18-0) was busy demolish
ing ljfth-ranked Texas 5-1 just down
the load in Austin. One day earlier,
Stanford warmed up for its top-10
with the Longhorns by down
ing SIo. 35 Texas A&M in a 5-1 win.
"J think Texas was our breakout
Stanford head coach Frank
Brefinan said. "I had told the girls
thatiwe needed to start roiling over
people. We had a lot of 5-4 wins,
whicjh proved we were really tough.
We }iad to prove then that we were
good. We had to start making
statements."
I*he Cardinal did just that in bull

dozing a Longhorn squad on its
home court. Back from an ankle in

Three other Stanford competi
tors also notched straight-set wins
for the Cardinal. Austin native Julie
Scott — up at No. 4 in the latest sin
gles rankings — edged Texas' Cristi
na Moros 7-6,7-5.
In the No. 4 spot, senior Ania
Bleszynski rolled, defeating
Longhorn Kim Gates 6-4, 6-2.
Sophomore Jennifer Heiser took
advantage of a first set win by

denying a Texas bid to split sets
and recording a 6-1, 6-4 win over
Nomena Rasolomalaia.
Freshman Sarah Pestieau re
fused to let inexperience be a factor
in her No. 5 singles match against
Texas veteran Laura Berendt.
Pestieau outlasted Berendt in three
sets 6-4,6-7,7-5.
The Longhorns avoided an all
out Cardinal sweep by taking the
No. 3 singles match. Michelle Panth
er's three-set victory over Stanford
sophomore Teryn Ashley marked
the first loss hy Ashley in her entire
Stanford dual-match career.
" That was quite a run," Brennan
said. "But I think it is good for Teryn
that it is over. Now she doesn't have
the undefeated pressure anymore.
That was a real upset, but we aren't
worried about Teryn at all. We
know she can play "
Doubles play was suspended
after Stanford clinched the win.
It was much the same story on the
previous day against an over
matched Aggies squad. Each of
Stanford's five singles wins came in

straight sets. Still recovering from
the ankle injury. Kremer competed
in the third singles spot and rolled 6-
0,6-1.
Stanford did not miss a heat with
Scott in the top spot as she cruised 6-
4. 6-3. Ashley, Bleszynski and Heis
er also registered straight-set victo
ries. The Aggies earned their lone
point in the No. 6 match in which
Eva Marcial edged the C ardinal's
Marissa MacLennan in two
marathon sets 7-6, 7-6.
At the beginning of the week,
however, the Cardinal barely es
caped California without blemishing
its perfect dual-match record.
Upset-minded Harvard had Stan
ford on the ropes at 4-4 with one
match remaining, but seniors Scott
and Bleszynski held on in the No. 1
doubles match K-6.
Rain forced an atypical dual
match format for the meeting be
tween the then-No. 2 Cardinal and
the No. 25 Crimson. Some of the
matches were held on the Taube

Sophomore Anne Kremer returns a ball against Arizona last month.
Over spring break, her team barely survived a run by Harvard and
then went on to beat Texas and Texas A&M to preserve the team's
perfect 18-0 dual match record.
