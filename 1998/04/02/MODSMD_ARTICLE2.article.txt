The conference was the brain
child of law students Jacqueline Sut

ing to Sutton, who is also the chair of

The biggest issue was making
sure that the conference had a "di

elists from the liberal thought to the
conservative thought," Sutton said.
"We wanted a conference that

was more pragmatic so that what
was learned from it could actually be
used in the future," Sutton said.
