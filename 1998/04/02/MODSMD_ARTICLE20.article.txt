honors, is known almost as well for her smile.
method of swimming, she has pio
neered a new technique, which she
calls the "fish kick." Hyman's coach
read about the fish kick in an article
in Scientific American magazine in
which MIT professors studied the
way fish swim in hopes of applying it
to new military inventions.
Hyman and her coach decided to
apply this to her swimming. After
she dives in and after she turns at
each wall. Hyman moves to her side
to kick rather than staying on her
stomach.
Being a student of the sport has
brought tremendous rewards.
In high school, she set national
records in the 100-yard back and
the 100-yard fly. In 1995, she was
the world champion in the short
course 100-meter fly and 100-meter
back.
Through the vears, she has been

a U.S. national champion seven
times and is the U.S. Open record
holder in the short course 100-
meter fly and the world record
holder in the short course 50-meter
fly.
She is currently ranked first in
the world in the l(X)-meter fly and
second in the 200-meter fly. At this
year's NCAA Championships, she
won five events — all in record
times — and was named the NCAA
Swimmer of the Year.
With such a list of accomplish
ments, one might think she has
Olympic rings tattooed on her arm
or that she awakens each morning
to the national anthem.
But when asked about her hopes
for her swimming future, she simply
says,"I want to keep enjoying
swimming and keep getting better.
Records come and records go; I just
want to enjoy swimming. If you do
that, good things usually follow."
Coupled with her determination
is an incredible sense of under

standing. Despite what Nike nSay
advertise, sports are not a matte£of
life ordeath. Swimming is her pas
sion, but it does not dictate hei'en
joyment of life. .

isn't a constant damper on

Outside of her individual racing,
Hyman is busy creating memories
in other aspects of her life. She tarks
fondly of her teammates, her room
mates and her freshman experience
thus far.
Hyman is a mix of fervent dedi
cation and constant enjoyment.

in peace without certain swimming
accomplishments, one gets the feel

the beaming smile.
