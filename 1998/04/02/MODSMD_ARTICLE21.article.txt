jjmost all of the team qualified for
thfi<J>gionals. Some gymnasts are com
peffi in all the events, however, while

others are focusing on only one or two.
Sophomore Jason Katsampes, one of
the team's top contenders, is unable to
participate due to injury.
"1 have some back pain," Katsampes
said. "It should get better soon, but I'm
going to have to mis> the regionals."
Katsampes has his eye on the world
championships in late summer and
hopes his back will be ready in time to
compete there.
Senior co-captain Clarence Miao
who was named to the All-Pacific 10
Conference Team in both the floor exer
cise and vault — plans to compete in
both events at the regionals.
"All I have to do is hit my routines

and I'll be fine," Miao said. "Cal and Ne
braska — especially some of Cal's in
ternational recruits — should be my top
competitors."
Freshman Rico Andrade. who will be
competing in every event but the pom
mel horse, echoed Miao's enthusiastic,
pressure-free attitude.
"This is the kind of meet where we
can really go for the hard skills." An
drade said. "If we hit them, we'll get the
higher scores, but if we nuss, the team is
not hurt. I have a really difficult routine
on the parallel bars, which 1 think I'm
just going to go for this weekend."
The gymnasts are competing as indi
viduals. but team unity remains inipor

tant.
"I've always liked competing with my
teammates because I like being in a
group rather than as an individual."
Miao said. "1 feel that team units is pret
ty strong right now."
Andrade recognizes that the pressure
is different when competing as an indi
vidual hut also feels inspired by the other
team members" presence.
"I like the fact that we're going as a
team even though we're competing as in
dividuals." he said.
Freshman Bobby Osterhoff. who will
be competing on the pommel horse, has
enjoyed consistently improving
scores in that event. Osterhoff felt
somewhat differently about com
peting as an individual.
"It's a lot easier," Osterhoff s;ii(J.
" There's nothing realh riding on
this. It's more of a personal thing."
The regionals. according to Os
terhoff. seem almost like a relief
after a strenuous, injury-plagued
season during which a lot o! pres
sure fell on the shoulders of the
team's freshmen.

"There's been so much pres
sure on the whole team this year
to help out the team — for the
greater good of the team. Oster
hoff said. "It's been on the fresh
men especially. Now the seniors
are making their transition to
leave. It's just time for all of us to
see if we can live up to our poten
tial without all the pressure."
The seniors, in fact, are aware
that this meet could well be their
last.
"I was extremely relieved to find
out that pretty much everybody on
the team qualified for regionals on
at least one event." said senior

Gabe Edelman. who will be com
peting in the floor exercise and the
vault.
"There are certainly a few peo
ple who have a very realistic chance
of making it to nationals. However,
this has been a long season, and I
am glad that it is coming to a close."
In addition to Miao. Andrade.
Osterhoff and Edelman. sopho
more Craig Nesbitt will tackle all
events except the rings.
Senior co-captain Jeremy Her
man will try to shine on his best
event, the pommel horse, and fresh
man Jason Biltz will perform in
every event.
The team season may be over, but
hopes remain high among individuals on
th<j §lanford men's gymnastics squad as
