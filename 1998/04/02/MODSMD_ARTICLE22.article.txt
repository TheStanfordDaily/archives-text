end's devastating losses to Hawaii.

Fortunately for the No. 6 Cardinal (13-6. 12-5
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation), the problems
didn't last long. After Stanford lost the first game of
the match, the fourth-ranked Cougars (14-4. 10-4)
proceeded to run up the second game's score to a dis
mal 2-7. But at that point, the Cardinal was able to
come back strong and pick up a mild upset victor) 11 -
15. 15-12. 15-6. 15-12.
Last night was the first time the two teams had met
since last year's Stanford sweep of BYI in the MPSF
semifinals.
The match was the first that the Cardinal had
played since being handed two defeats b\ the Rain
bows last weekend. The start of the BYI match did
little to boost Stanford's confidence
"Our confidence realh took a blow with last week
end's losses," said Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves. "Plus, we had to bounce back from a difficult
first game."
Stanford made a change in last night's lineup from
the start, placing freshman setter Brad Griffith into
the starting m\ in his first significant start of the sea
son.
The Cardinal lineup continued to change through
out the match, as 11 Stanford players made appear
ances. 10 of those in more than one game.
"I'm realh proud of our guys off the bench, espe
cially [Patrick) Klein and [Chris] Griffith." Nieves
said.
Klein, a junior outside hitter, entered the match
midway through game one and posted 32 kills for the
Cardinal, second only to sophomore outside hitter
Andy Witt. Witt added a match-high 36 kills to Stan
ford's total.
"What makes Witt's numbers even more impres
sive is his poor start in game one." Nieves said.
W itt took a spot on the bench midwa\ through the
lust game after hitting negative!). then re-entered the
game and finished with a strong hitting percentage of
.473 (36 10-55).
Other Cardinal players to m.ike early exits from
the match included senior swing hitter Devin Pool
man and sophomore outside hitter Josh Palacios.
Although Palacios made an early exit from the
match with |ust three kills, he did record a team-high
hitting percentage of .750.
"I'm proud of Palacios. Poolman and Witt's re
sponses to being taken out ot the match." Nieves said
"They showed full support for their teammates and
found ways to help the team even though they were
not on the court."
Although the numbers from the match don't show
it, junior Chris Griffith also made a significant impact
alter his entrance into the first
game.
"Griffith's opportunities have
been few, but I always know he is
competing and trying as hard as
anyone on the court," Nieves said
"He's worked tremendously hard
for four years."

Hoffman, one of only two regular
Stanford starters to play a complete
match, had a strong night on both
sides of the court. Hoffman fin

total of 19 digs and eight blocks,
both match-leading. Freshman
Brad Griffith added 11 digs lor the
Cardinal.
Hoffman holds the No. 5 posi
tion nationally in hitting percent
age, .478, and finished the match
just above that total .at 4KO with 14
kills.
