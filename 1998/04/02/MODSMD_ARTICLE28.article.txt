# Alumnus fights for cancer patient's sight
## 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
A 16-year-old girl in Belarus is quickly going
blind, but with help from the Stanford community,
an alumnus may be able to save her sight... and
her life.
John Martin, who has a doctorate in education
from Stanford, met Dasha Eskevich, a 16-year-old
suffering from a brain tumor, while working in Be
larus in IIWS-%.l l W5-%. Since then, her condition has be
come critical.
Dasha's vision becomes worse every day, and
she is expected to go blind in a week or two, ac
cording to Martin. The condition is irreversible.
"In the next week or two, she must have an op
eration," Martin said.
"It's very serious," agreed Jack Van Hoff, asso
ciate professor of pediatrics at Yale University's
School of Medicine. He reviewed the case and also
worked in Belarus. "Untreated, this tumor will
eventually kill her."
Martin has vowed to do his best to prevent that.
"Here's the case where there's one human being,

and it's a life-and-death thing. And it doesn't have
to happen. She doesn't have to go blind. She
doesn't have to die," he said.
He has already convinced the doctors to go
ahead with the operation this month.
It will cost $26,236 for the operation and trans
portation to Germany, where it can be performed.
There is no way Dasha's family can support the
costs of the operation, Martin said.
"Doctors there make about 50 bucks a month,"
Van Hoff said. "There's no way that woman or
even her whole village could come up with the
money to get that treatment in the West."
In the last few weeks, Martin has made a full
time commitment to raising money for the girl, but
much of his efforts have been futile. Martin, with no
success, contacted churches, political figures,
schools, 120 famous individuals and many charita
ble organizations. He found they prefer to give
money to programs, not individuals.
"Nobody wants to help a child halfway around
the world," Martin said.
Frustrated by other attempts, Martin is now fo
cusing his fundraising efforts on college campuses.

He secured a post office box and account solely for
money for Dasha.
Martin is seeking small donations. "If every per
son gave $1 or $5 eventually that would be enough
to pay for the operation," he said. "You don't have
to help everyone, but you can help one person."
He suggested that dormitories could give some
of their money, or Greek organizations could
throw a fund-raising event for her.
Martin takes his own advice to help others. For
nearly 10 years, Martin worked in the former Sovi
et Union to create health education programs and
train teachers. His program now reaches 3,000 to
4,(X)0 students every year and is in place in 55 Russ
ian cities. He returned a year ago to the United
States with teachers from Belarus to show them
ways to educate students with disabilities.
"[Martin] really looks for opportunities where
he can serve in some kind of positive way," Van
Hoff said. "He absolutely is not lcx)king for money
or personal fame."
