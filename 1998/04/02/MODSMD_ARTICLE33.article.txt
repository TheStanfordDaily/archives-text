## 'No Looking Back' 
### 
If you enjoyed either of Edward
Burns' earlier movies, "The Brothers
McMullen" or "She's the One" (star
ring Jennifer Aniston and Cameron
Diaz), then you'll love his latest, "No
Looking Back." Once again, Burns gives
us believable, ordinary people who are
just trying to figure out life.
The story begins with a recipe for dis
aster. A beautifiil young woman named
Claudia (Lauren Holly) lives in a small
working-class town in New York. And
this town is small — everyone knows
who everyone else is sleeping with.
Claudia's been dating Michael (Jon

Bon Jovi, yes, from the band) for three
years. All is la di da between them — or
at least there's nothing to complain
about. He adores her and will do any
thing for her, and she seems fine with
this.
Enter disaster in the form of Claudia's
ex-boyfriend Charlie (Burns). He re
turns to the town after mysteriously dis
appearing three years earlier and thinks
he can get Claudia back. Suddenly, she
doesn't know who to date — the com
forting but boring Michael or the excit
ing but unreliable Charlie.
"No Looking Back" works because it
was easy to understand Claudia even in
when I didn't agree with the things she
did. I empathized with her fear of get
ting married and remaining a waitress
for the rest of her life. This is her fate if
she marries Michael, because he doesn't
seem to want anything to change. He
can't even understand why Claudia
would want to visit New York City.

There are subplots in the movie that
help explain Claudia's commitment
phobia. Her father recently ran off and
left her mother (Blythe Danner), and
her sister Kelly (Connie Britton) is going
through a string of hopeless dates.
One of the best aspects of the movie is
Bon Jovi's portrayal of a hard working
man who just wants to start a family.
He's calmed down from his wild rocker
days and is completely believable in his
role. Lauren Holly is a little less believ
able as a 30-something-year-old from a
small town, because she looks as if she's

in a Vidal Sassoon commercial. But aes
thetic problems aside, her performance
certainly doesn't detract from the film.
The movie stays within the shades of
gray that make us human. It is 90 min
utes of observing people who you could
probably know. While you do wonder
who Claudia will finally choose, it's
more interesting to watch her as she
makes that decision. It was nice to see a
film about people and how they relate to
each other rather than concentrating
what they ultimately end up doing.
