# Director Edward Bums
## 
### Kerry Shaw Staff writer 
Edward Burns is a lucky guy.
He's a critically acclaimed writer, pro
ducer and director who stars in his own
films.
Given his string of accomplishments in
a business that isn't exactly known for hu
mility, 1 wasn't sure what to expect when 1
went to interview him. His public relations
representative in San Francisco told me
that he was one of the most down-to-earth
celebrities she's worked with. There's even
a rumor that he's only yelled in public
once, and that was when he recognized
Tom Hanks from afar. Still, 1 had my
doubts.
But what I found out is that Burns is a
very normal guy who happens to make
good movies. Sitting across from me in a
simple black sweater and pants, there
were no outward signs of vanity or ego-

tism. He answered my ques
tions patiently and seemed gen
uinely interested in talking
about his craft. I found out later
that he golfs with his father
once a year in Florida and has
dinner with his family about
once every two weeks.
Perhaps he seems normal be
cause he never really planned to
go into the movie industry.
"When 1 went to college 1
knew that I wanted to be a
writer," Burns said. "So I be
came an English major and
tried my hand at short stories,
thought about writing a novel,
tried journalism and then
wrote a one act play. That was
the first time I ever thought

about writing dialogue and enjoyed that.
"It was my junior year, and I was basi
cally failing out of college. My dad sent
me a screenwriting book, just trying to
get me motivated to do anything. 1 read
the book and I saw the format, and I said,
'I think I can handle this.' And then I
wrote a screenplay and fell in love with
screenwriting."
Burns now thinks that his first script was
terrible, but at the time he believed it was
going to be a great movie. He couldn't bear
the thought of sending it to Hollywood and
"letting some guy potentially massacre" his
masterpiece, so he decided to learn how to
make movies himself.
He promptly switched his major from
English to film. After graduating from
Hunter College in New York City, he
wanted any job in the industry that he
could get. He found one in the New York
office of the television show
"Entertainment Tonight" where he

worked as a production assistant for the
next four years, "fetching coffee and dri
ving the van."
For fun on his days off, he made a
movie with his friends about a couple
dating in New York City. They used inex
pensive equipment, did their filming at
his parents' house and had a good time
doing it. The movie got rejected from
every film festival and every distribution
company they sent it to. Except one.
"I almost didn't send it to Sundance
because I had given up hope," Burns said.
"The Hamptons Film Festival on Long
Island rejected it. So if they didn't want a
film from Long Island, what made me
think Sundance would want it?"
"The Brothers McMullen" was
awarded the Grand Jury Prize at the fes
tival and got picked up by 20th Century
Fox for national distribution. The movie
cost only $24,000 and ended up grossing
more than $11 million.
Burns had hoped to use the film to get
a gig directing commercials. The actors
were hoping to have some scenes to pre
sent to agents. But the film met with in
stant success, earning Burns the distinc
tion of being "the Irish Woody Allen."
Movie studios rushed to sign him.
Burns hasn't been changed all that
much by fame. Sure, it's given him the re
sources to work with more famous actors
and actresses, but he still uses his friends
from his first work. Connie Britton, one
of the stars in "Brothers," returned to
work with him in "No Looking Back."
His stories still revolve around the com
plexities of human relationships.
When it comes to his own relation
ships, he hasn't been in one since he
broke up with his long-term girlfriend

last year. He's single and "still looking."
Now he spends most of his time writ
ing, averaging 20 to 25 drafts on a script.
"It's the only part of the process that
isn't collaborative," Burns said. "You
don't need a million dollars, and it's
yours. At the end of the day, you have
something that you've produce ... the di
recting is just a way to maintain as much
control over my baby as possible."
After "No Looking Back," Burns took a
break from writing and filmmaking and
flew to Ireland. There, he had an acting
role in this summer's upcoming release,
"Saving Private Ryan," directed by Steven
Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks.
It took about a week to get used to not
being in the director's seat. "I was used to
being in charge," Burns said. "I was
thrown off a little bit. But then it was
great, because it was nice to not have all
the responsibilities."
When it comes to his own movies, he
tries to stay positive. Part of the way he
does this is by not reading too many re
views. In fact, he only allows his staff to
show him the great ones.
"I read reviews of'McMullen,' because
those were all good for the most part," he
said. "And then we got mixed reviews on
'She's the One' and those really stung ...
You just can't torture yourself."
What's refreshing about Burns is that
he seems genuinely appreciative of the
opportunities his success has provided
him.
"Basically, what I do isn't work," he said.
"For me, writing is the best way for me to
spend my time ... I could spend 24 hours
a day playing around in the editing room."
