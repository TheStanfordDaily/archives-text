## You ain't seen nettling yet! 'General Chaos' gives you a closer look at the gross 
### Amina Gautier Contributing writer 
So you've given up on the old silent cartoons of
a cat and mouse chasing each other, and
you've seen one too many pie-in-the-face rou
tines. And the Power Rangers and Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles just don't cut it anymore.
You're an adult; you go to college. You're through
with kiddy stuff, and you've seen enough of
Japanimation's brand of head slicing and dismem
berment.
You're searching for something with good anima
tion. Something that's not meant for the Sesame
Street bunch. Something that shows the humor in
real life situations. Something ... slightly grotesque.
"The Simpsons." "Beavis and Butthead."
"Rugrats.""Ren and Stimpy." They've all come, sold
T-shirts and gone. Now you think you know all there
is to know about adult animation. But until you've
seen "Attack of the Hungry, Hungry Nipples" and
"American Flatulators," you ain't seen nothing yet.
Manga Entertainment has brought "General
Chaos: Uncensored Animation," a festival of short
animated films, to the Bay Area. Running a total of
90 minutes (including an intermission), "General
Chaos" is a collection of adult animation geared
specifically for mature and Generation X audiences
(ages 18-34). No little kiddy cartoons here.
The quirky clips vary in length. "Misfit" is a very
short, funny sketch about a circus clown who "falls"
for a trapeze artist. It runs one minute and 11 sec
onds. On the longer side, "Oh Julie!" about a
woman's sexual preparation for a night of passion,
runs for nine minutes. Most of the clips range from
three to five minutes.
When shown together, the individual shorts rep
resent material that dates from the mid-1980s to the
present. There are 21 individual titles, featuring dif
ferent visual styles ranging from eel, puppet and
clay animation to computer generation.
You can find many of these animators working
for Disney, MTV, Dreamworks, Apple and
Nickelodeon. "General Chaos" features the work of
some of the hottest animators around, such as Bill
Flympton and the Bolex Brothers. Many of the ani
mators have worked on popular series such as "Ren
and Stimpy," "The Weird Al Show" and "Rocko's
Modern Life."
However, you won't see the kind of work they've

submitted to the festival on "Ren and Stimpy."
"General Chaos" is "uncensored animation," so the
material goes quite a bit further than the routine
"Ren and Stimpy" fart game.
So what exactly can you expect to see when you
sit down for a festival of uncensored animation?
How about a spin you never thought Lewis Carroll's
"Alice in Wonderland" could take? Vince Collins an
imated and directed "Malice in Wonderland" and
takes Malice on a hysterical journey as she falls
through her own vagina and encounters some very
strange creatures and lots of phallic imagery.
Remember "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes?" Well,
get ready for "Attack of the Hungry, Hungry
Nipples," directed and animated by Walter Santucci.
It's about lean Jean, a boy who argues with his
mother while locked in the refrigerator. He escapes
when the Hungry, Hungry Nipples come over. They
don't seem too fond of Jean Jean; the Hungry,
Hungry Nipples tell him to suck something. Alas, a
baseball bat with Richard Nixon's face kills the nip
ples, but the short cartoon does have a happy end
ing: Jean Jean gets nipples of his own.
Not all of the shorts are about sex or sexual or
gans. For instance, there's David Donar's "Espresso

Depresso," which takes satirical pleasure in spread
ing light on today's coffee culture trend.
"Junky," Tony Nittoli's puppet animation, has
been called a "touching and unflinching story." It's
also been called "lustfully dark and truly perverted."
"Junky" portrays the story of a parrot who tries to
cope with his addiction to crackers and the things
he undergoes to get his fix.
"American Flatulators" gives a provocative turn
of thought to the now-defunct show "American
Gladiatiors" that featured gladiators who pitted
their strength against one another and fought. Well,
the Flatulators fight in the gas arena.
Tyron Montgomery and Thomas Stellmach's
touching puppet animation film, "Quest," a 1996
Academy Award winner, is the 11-and-a-half-minute
prologue that kicks off the animation festival. "Quest"
is about a sand puppet who wanders through other
worlds in search of water. He finally finds the water he
seeks, but not in the way you might imagine.
If you've been looking for gross humor, then I'd
sav you've found it.
