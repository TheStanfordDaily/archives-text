# music interview
## Signifying everything Intermission talks with Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree 
### Mark Brewton Contributing writer 
Not too long ago, "progressive"
was a dirty word in the music in
dustry. And for good reason —
almost every "progressive" band
has been nothing but a bastion of
imitation. But progressive rock is
still alive in a good way.
Intermission decided to interview
Steven Wilson, founder of
Porcupine Tree, a British "pro
gressive band."
Intermission: "Signify" was
released in 1996; it's two years
later and you're still promoting
it. Why?
Steven Wilson: It took us
that long to find someone we
thought was right to push it in
the States. We had a lot of inter
est from record companies in
the States. What was most ap
pealing about going with Ark 21
was they were aware of what we
were trying to do in terms of
appearing as an album-based
act, rather than a kind of singles
band. Obviously, we're very
much about creating albums
that are supposed to be listened
to as a whole rather than taking
little pieces out and putting
them on the radio.
I: Did "Signify" evolve as a
discrete set of songs or is there
an overarching concept to it,
even though "concept album" is
a dirty word these days?
SW: The whole beauty about
making music is creating an al
bum, a series of songs that work
together as a unified whole. It's
very unfashionable to do this,
although I think it's coming
back. With the advent of CD, I

think people are thinking again
about creating a whole instead
of individual pop songs.
For me, it's a little like
putting together a jigsaw puz
zle. You have to create the right
sense of dynamics, the right
sense of highs and lows, fast
songs, slow songs, vocal pas
sages, and instrumental pas
sages. Obviously when 1 start
writing material for a new al
bum I'm not writing with that
in mind. But as songs come out
,1 begin to get a picture of how
they're going to fit together and
so the last two or three tracks of
"Signify" were written almost as
the missing pieces of the jigsaw
puzzle. On top of that, there is a
kind of lyrical theme that runs
through the album, and musi
cally there is a kind of narrative.
I: Let's talk about that. There
does seem to be a strong sense
of waiting and alienation in
your lyrics. Is this what
"Signify" is about?
SW: I know everyone has his
or her own hang-ups and fears
and whatnots, and mine is that
I've got this terrible fear that I
will live my life having not left
anything of worth or signifi
cance that will live on after I go,
and that's become a bit of an
obsession. Obviously the way
I'm trying to counter that is by
making music, which I hope
will still be listened to and still
be important to people after
I'm no longer on this planet.
There are a lot of songs, as
you pointed out, about waiting,
and anticipating life coming to
you rather than going out and
creating opportunities for your
self. They're songs about orga
nized religion, dead-end careers

which, through a kind of lazi
ness, you can't be bothered to
find a way out of. I was in that
position for a few years after I
left school. I went into a posi
tion for four or five years only
intending to be in it for six
months! Three or four years
down the line, it's so easy not to
break out. The whole album be
came a set of themes about how
people — myself in particular
— might waste the gift of life.
I: Did the move from record
ing by yourself to writing and
recording with a band affect the
way "Signify" sounded or the

I was suddenly not writing with ma
chines in mind,
I was writing with people in mind

writing and recording process?
SW: I was suddenly not writ
ing with machines in mind. I
was writing with people in
mind. The material became
much more organic, more like
rock and less synthesized. Early
on there were a lot of elements
of techno and trance. 1 had very
textural andkeyboard-oriented
music. Suddenly going out and
playing live the music 1 was
writing, 1 became more song
oriented and had more of rock
attack to it. When you go and
play live suddenly your music
has a whole new dynamic and
energy. That kind of translated
back into the studio.
I: Particularly the title track,
which almost seems like a re
sponse to the endless Pink
Floyd comparisions. It's a song

that Floyd never would have
written.
SW: Absolutely. 1 feel that
way about a lot of songs. But
obviously this is the very an
tithesis of Floyd — very aggres
sive and very driving. The new
album, which is almost Fin
ished, continues the trend to
ward more song-oriented mu
sic, much tighter arangeinents,
and much more of a rock
sound. The sonic experimenta
tion is still there which is an el
ement I think that people tend
to associate with Pink Floyd. I
don't necessarily think our ma
terial is very Floydie, but the
way we put our albums together
is very unusual. The only real
precedent for that are the al
bums done by bands like the
Floyd where all the songs are
linked. This makes the album a
very seamless musical journey. I
think that's a very Floydian
thing, and it's what people pick
up on.
I: Where do you see yourself
fitting in the American musical
market?
SW: Well, it's difficult. I've
been totally confused by the
American market. How can any
band ever become successful in
the States? Flere in England it's
really easy because you've got
two or three influential maga
zines, and two or three radio
stations that are influential, and
you have to hit them or else you

will not be successful.
In America you've got this
massive network of radio sta
tions and publications, and
there are so many angles you
can approach it from. However,
in America, there does seem to
be a tradition of the serious,
art-rock bands, bands that
made albums as opposed to
those who just wrote pop sin
gles. In America you have a
much stronger tradition of rock
in the '90s, with bands like
Nirvana and Soundgarden. We
don't really have bands like that
in England anymore.
The last Smashing Pumpkins
album was a massively ambi
tious piece of work and mas
sively successful. We see our
selves having more in common
with a band like Smashing
Pumpkins, even though our

sound isn't that similar.
In terms of the scope and the
ambition of what we're trying
to achieve, we have some of the
same things in mind. I would
see ourselves going to that area
of the market. In the end, peo
ple respond to good music, and
for a long time there hasn't been
a band working in the area we
do. We're rock, but there's
something very cerebral about
what we do. You can enjoy it
with your head and your heart.
I: Your music gets catego
rized under the nebuous pro
gressive rock genre; what do
you think are the prospects for
the revival of ambitious music
that can have a mass audience?
SW: I think it's already hap
pening. The problem is that
there is a stigma attached to it.
But there are bands in UK and
America that are incredibly am
bitious and doing extraordinary
things in the whole medium of
creating albums. What they
would have in common with
the progressive rock genre, at
least the classic era, from the
early '70s, was taking all the
other styles of music and com
bining them into a new form.
Pink Floyd came from a blues /
rock background, but in the
studio they added elements of
jazz, spacerock, psychedelia.
There are bands creating
their own blueprints all the
time. 1 do get a little annoyed
that our music gets referred to
as progressive rock, but 1 have
to admit that our music has
some of its roots in that style.
I: What are your fans like?
SW: They vary massively. In
the UK they tend to come from
the old school of progressive
rock, the sort of people who'd
be familiar with Fink Floyd,
King Crimson and Marillion.
The music press in the UK
has almost completely ignored
us. They think we're some sort
of genre band, of course, they
haven't actually listened to us.
On the other hand, in places
like Italy, Greece, Poland and
France, the appeal seems to be
pretty much across the board.
The media there have basically
promoted us as a rock band.
And when 14- or 15-year-old
kids hear a Porcupine Tree
song, they're not familiar with
the progressive genre. They just
hear a band that they like.
That's much more refreshing
than playing for these very spe
cific genre-related audiences in
the UK.

months! Three or four years
down the line, it's so easy not to
break out. The whole album be
came a set of themes about how
people — myself in particular
— might waste the gift of life.
I: Did the move from record
ing by yourself to writing and
recording with a band affect the
way "Signify" sounded or the

writing and recording process?
SW: I was suddenly not writ
ing with machines in mind. I
was writing with people in
mind. The material became
much more organic, more like
rock and less synthesized. Early
on there were a lot of elements
of techno and trance. 1 had very
textural andkeyboard-oriented
music. Suddenly going out and
playing live the music 1 was
writing, 1 became more song
oriented and had more of rock
attack to it. When you go and
play live suddenly your music
has a whole new dynamic and
energy. That kind of translated
back into the studio.
I: Particularly the title track,
which almost seems like a re
sponse to the endless Pink
Floyd comparisions. It's a song

that Floyd never would have
written.
SW: Absolutely. 1 feel that
way about a lot of songs. But
obviously this is the very an
tithesis of Floyd — very aggres
sive and very driving. The new
album, which is almost Fin
ished, continues the trend to
ward more song-oriented mu
sic, much tighter arangeinents,
and much more of a rock
sound. The sonic experimenta
tion is still there which is an el
ement I think that people tend
to associate with Pink Floyd. I
don't necessarily think our ma
terial is very Floydie, but the
way we put our albums together
is very unusual. The only real
precedent for that are the al
bums done by bands like the
Floyd where all the songs are
linked. This makes the album a
very seamless musical journey. I
think that's a very Floydian
thing, and it's what people pick
up on.
I: Where do you see yourself
fitting in the American musical
market?
SW: Well, it's difficult. I've
been totally confused by the
American market. How can any
band ever become successful in
the States? Flere in England it's
really easy because you've got
two or three influential maga
zines, and two or three radio
stations that are influential, and
you have to hit them or else you

will not be successful.
In America you've got this
massive network of radio sta
tions and publications, and
there are so many angles you
can approach it from. However,
in America, there does seem to
be a tradition of the serious,
art-rock bands, bands that
made albums as opposed to
those who just wrote pop sin
gles. In America you have a
much stronger tradition of rock
in the '90s, with bands like
Nirvana and Soundgarden. We
don't really have bands like that
in England anymore.
The last Smashing Pumpkins
album was a massively ambi
tious piece of work and mas
sively successful. We see our
selves having more in common
with a band like Smashing
Pumpkins, even though our

sound isn't that similar.
In terms of the scope and the
ambition of what we're trying
to achieve, we have some of the
same things in mind. I would
see ourselves going to that area
of the market. In the end, peo
ple respond to good music, and
for a long time there hasn't been
a band working in the area we
do. We're rock, but there's
something very cerebral about
what we do. You can enjoy it
with your head and your heart.
I: Your music gets catego
rized under the nebuous pro
gressive rock genre; what do
you think are the prospects for
the revival of ambitious music
that can have a mass audience?
SW: I think it's already hap
pening. The problem is that
there is a stigma attached to it.
But there are bands in UK and
America that are incredibly am
bitious and doing extraordinary
things in the whole medium of
creating albums. What they
would have in common with
the progressive rock genre, at
least the classic era, from the
early '70s, was taking all the
other styles of music and com
bining them into a new form.
Pink Floyd came from a blues /
rock background, but in the
studio they added elements of
jazz, spacerock, psychedelia.
There are bands creating
their own blueprints all the
time. 1 do get a little annoyed
that our music gets referred to
as progressive rock, but 1 have
to admit that our music has
some of its roots in that style.
I: What are your fans like?
SW: They vary massively. In
the UK they tend to come from
the old school of progressive
rock, the sort of people who'd
be familiar with Fink Floyd,
King Crimson and Marillion.
The music press in the UK
has almost completely ignored
us. They think we're some sort
of genre band, of course, they
haven't actually listened to us.
On the other hand, in places
like Italy, Greece, Poland and
France, the appeal seems to be
pretty much across the board.
The media there have basically
promoted us as a rock band.
And when 14- or 15-year-old
kids hear a Porcupine Tree
song, they're not familiar with
the progressive genre. They just
hear a band that they like.
That's much more refreshing
than playing for these very spe
cific genre-related audiences in
the UK.

Not too long ago, "progressive"
was a dirty word in the music in
dustry. And for good reason —
almost every "progressive" band
has been nothing but a bastion of
imitation. But progressive rock is
still alive in a good way.
Intermission decided to interview
Steven Wilson, founder of
Porcupine Tree, a British "pro
gressive band."
Intermission: "Signify" was
released in 1996; it's two years
later and you're still promoting
it. Why?
Steven Wilson: It took us
that long to find someone we
thought was right to push it in
the States. We had a lot of inter
est from record companies in
the States. What was most ap
pealing about going with Ark 21
was they were aware of what we
were trying to do in terms of
appearing as an album-based
act, rather than a kind of singles
band. Obviously, we're very
much about creating albums
that are supposed to be listened
to as a whole rather than taking
little pieces out and putting
them on the radio.
I: Did "Signify" evolve as a
discrete set of songs or is there
an overarching concept to it,
even though "concept album" is
a dirty word these days?
SW: The whole beauty about
making music is creating an al
bum, a series of songs that work
together as a unified whole. It's
very unfashionable to do this,
although I think it's coming
back. With the advent of CD, I

think people are thinking again
about creating a whole instead
of individual pop songs.
For me, it's a little like
putting together a jigsaw puz
zle. You have to create the right
sense of dynamics, the right
sense of highs and lows, fast
songs, slow songs, vocal pas
sages, and instrumental pas
sages. Obviously when 1 start
writing material for a new al
bum I'm not writing with that
in mind. But as songs come out
,1 begin to get a picture of how
they're going to fit together and
so the last two or three tracks of
"Signify" were written almost as
the missing pieces of the jigsaw
puzzle. On top of that, there is a
kind of lyrical theme that runs
through the album, and musi
cally there is a kind of narrative.
I: Let's talk about that. There
does seem to be a strong sense
of waiting and alienation in
your lyrics. Is this what
"Signify" is about?
SW: I know everyone has his
or her own hang-ups and fears
and whatnots, and mine is that
I've got this terrible fear that I
will live my life having not left
anything of worth or signifi
cance that will live on after I go,
and that's become a bit of an
obsession. Obviously the way
I'm trying to counter that is by
making music, which I hope
will still be listened to and still
be important to people after
I'm no longer on this planet.
There are a lot of songs, as
you pointed out, about waiting,
and anticipating life coming to
you rather than going out and
creating opportunities for your
self. They're songs about orga
nized religion, dead-end careers

which, through a kind of lazi
ness, you can't be bothered to
find a way out of. I was in that
position for a few years after I
left school. I went into a posi
tion for four or five years only
intending to be in it for six
months! Three or four years
down the line, it's so easy not to
break out. The whole album be
came a set of themes about how
people — myself in particular
— might waste the gift of life.
