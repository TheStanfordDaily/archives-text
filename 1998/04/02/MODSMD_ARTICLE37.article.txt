( now and then a work of fiction comes along
makes me sit down and read with the sort of
attention I usually save for staring matches against
stiff-eyed, nonsmiling, beautiful men.
Joanna Scott's "The Manikin" (Henry Holt, $22.50) is one
of those works.
"The Manikin" is the name of the Rochester, New York
mansion where the book takes place. Overflowing with the
preserved and stuffed carcasses of every sort of animal, the
mansion was bought in 1912 by the late Henry Craxton Sr.,
founder of Craxton's Scientific Establishment. Craxton
was often called "the Henry Ford of natural history." He
named the mansion after the durable form used as a skele
ton in taxidermy.
At the start of the novel, the Manikin is inhabited by an
elderly Mrs. Craxton, her stooped and ugly hanger-on taxi
dermist, Craxton's handful of servants and her servant's
children. The most prominent of these children, the beauti
ful adolescent Peg Griswood, is the center of the story.
The Manikin is an overwhelming place to live.
Intimidated by the emptiness of the place and spoiled by his
mother's kindness, Henry Craxton Jr. spends his time trav
eling around the world instead of staying home. This causes
a lonely, upset and vengeful Mrs. Craxton to invite a family
friend to stay for the summer iri her son's stead.
Peg Griswood is beautiful and dreamy. She wants to leave
the hills of Rochester and travel the world. She's tired of be
ing the housekeeper's daughter. Moreover, she is sick of Mrs.
Craxton's lack of appreciation for her servants. She's ready
to go; all she needs is a reason to leave.
Enter Ms. Lillian Stone, a Craxton family friend. Scott
doesn't hit you over the head with Stone; she works her in
with the deft hand of a mystery writer, using simple imagery
to evoke larger themes. The reader sees Stone for the first
time just as Griswood does: "Lillian Stone may be a slender
thighed, small-breasted, fashionable nymph, but the effect
of her is that of a boulder rolling down a hill, crushing
everything in its way." Instantaneously, everything in the
novel changes.
"The Manikin" is beautifully crafted. The prose has a
sense of immediacy that is usually found in short fiction,
not novels. The story twists and turns on itself just enough
to stay interesting, but isn't too roundabout to follow.
However, "The Manikin" is not without its flaws. What
begins as a nonstereotypical look at the not-so-idyllic 19205,
sans big band swirg and flappers, ends up being cut short.
The mystery, which is characterized by a general feeling of
unease throughout the novel rather than a confusing game
of whodunit, gets solved in a final chapter that seems tacked
on. Scott begins many interesting plotlines but seems unable
to finish many of them.
Abrupt ending aside, "The Manikin" is a fun, moving,
sensual read. After all, it was a finalist for the 1997 Pulitzer
Prize in fiction. That's usually a pretty good sign.
