# GET OUT AND GROOVE
## A 						Stanford student's guide to bay area night clubs South Bay 
### 
by Angel Flores and Alison MacKinnon
For people who are tired of hanging around campus and want to venture outside of Stanford to dip into the club scene, there are many opportunities in San Jose, San Francisco and Palo Alto.
Each club has a unique flavor and cover charges vary depending on the club, the night and the venue. Most clubs are open until 2 a.m.

San Jose
Only a 20-minute drive south on Highway 280, the
popular downtown area of San Jose is known as SoFA
(South of First Area). People pack the streets as they
wander in search of a club, coffeehouse, restaurant or
theater to hang out in.
Police patrol the well-lit surrounding area, but it
doesn't feel like they're out to keep you from having
fun.
Parking lots and structures allow for parking at a
reasonable fee within walking distance of the clubs.
We recommend the Second and San Carlos Garage,
which is brightly lit and easily accessible. It has a flat
cost of $3 after 8 p.m.

The Usual
where: 400 S. First St., San Jose
nights open: Tuesday through Sunday
cover charge: $3-$ 10,
Wednesdays free with college ID
minimum age: 21
information: (408) 535-0330,
http://www.theusualniteclub.com

The Usual sits in the heart of downtown San Jose.
Depending on the night, clubbers can dance to
groovin' modern rock, disco/funk, techno, high en
ergy or live bands. When you get in line, make sure to
get in the right one if you're not on the guest list.
Upon entering the club, a small room to your left
houses a bar and a neighboring room invites club-go
ers to take a break with a game of pool.
The main room is dotted with small tables and
chairs and a well-stocked bar. If you need a place to
leave your coat and purse, there is a small coat check
near the door. Behind the dance floor, a big screen
shows Japanese animation, and flashing fluorescent
lights brighten up the dance floor. The music is
"poppy" techno and dance, similar to the tunes plaved
on Z95.7 FM.
The general crowd consisted of trendsters in their
early 20s. They seemed like usuals in this scene, and it
didn't seem like a trashy meat market. The clubbers
arrived in big groups of people, and these groups
seemed to know each other.
The room was kept at a comfortable temperature,
and those who got hot from dancing could cool down
at the bar, where pitchers of ice water were provided.

Agenda Lounge
where: 399 S. First St., San Jose
nights open: Tuesday through Sunday
cover charge: $3+,
Fridays free with college ID before 11p.m.
minimum age: 21
information: (408) 237-4087,
http://www.agendalounge.com

Across the street from The Usual is the more so
phisticated Agenda Lounge. This club houses three
levels: the upstairs lounge, the cellar and the main
level restaurant.
Live bands often play in the lounge upstairs, and
certain nights feature DJs spinning dance music. The
club offers special nights including rockabilly and
swing on Wednesday nights and "Planet Reggae" on
Sundays. Every Friday night is "Go," which features the
best of '80s and '90s modern rock. Every third and
fourth Saturday of the month, the club has live salsa
music.
On the night we went, a funk jazz band played and
drew people into a crowded room. There were small
bar tables but most people stood and watched the
band. Many were groovin' to the funk band's energetic
beats, some with partners and others swaying by
themselves.
The people in the crowd were mostly in their late
205., but they seemed classy without being stuffy or
unapproachable.
The room is large and well-lit with wood-paneled
walls and large windows on the sides of the room fac
ing the street. A bar greets patrons as they reach the
top of the stairs.
In the cellar there are 24 microbrews on tap, pool
tables and plenty of cool vibes.

The Cactus Club
where: 417 S. First St., San Jose
nights open: Tuesday through Sunday
cover charge: $5+
minimum age: 18
information: (408) 491-9300
http://www.cactusclubsj.com

Another notable place right across from The Usual
is The Cactus Club. Mostly live bands play in this
large, warehouse-like club. Some nights, DJs provide
the dancing music.
On Sunday nights, DJs spin electronic, industrial
and techno music. Tuesday nights feature "Flashback"
with '80s modern rock music. The Thursday night
DJs play gothic, industrial and alternative.
This club is a small, intimate place to listen to live
rock, alternative and punk bands. The main room
with the stage is dark with concrete floors, high ceil
ings and little wall decor. At the back of the room is a
bar and some small tables and stools within viewing
distance of the stage. The club draws an eclectic crowd
of people of different ages and styles.
As San Jose's only 18-and-over club, this is a great
place to watch local and underground bands play and
offers a more alternative feel.

Palo Alto
If you can't drive to San Francisco or San lose, Q
Cafe is conveniently located in downtown Palo Alto.
Parking is available in the lot next door, on the street
or across the street in the Caltrain parking lot.

QCafe
where: 529 Alma St.,
near University Ave.
nights open: Tuesday through Sunday
cover charge: $5-$ 10 during live music,
otherwise free,
minimum age: 21
information: (650) 322-3311,
http://www.qcafe.com

The age of the crowd at Q's is generally 20s. The
people there are mostly professional-types looking
to unwind.
Q's has a typical uptown Palo Alto style â€” tower
ing ceilings, mahogany tables and a clean, neat fin
ish. Upon entering, there are small candle-lit tables
where you can enjoy tasty, yet pricey, appetizers and
a large variety of drinks. In this bar area, four televi
sions broadcast sporting events and news.
Towards the back are seven tournament-sized
Olhausen pool tables. Be prepared to wait for a table
on a Friday or Saturday night.
Live rock music is played on the small stage in the
center of the room. The usual bright dance lights
flash over the dance floor, which is usually crowded
on Friday and Saturday nights.

with '80s modern rock music. The Thursday night
DJs play gothic, industrial and alternative.
This club is a small, intimate place to listen to live
rock, alternative and punk bands. The main room
with the stage is dark with concrete floors, high ceil
ings and little wall decor. At the back of the room is a
bar and some small tables and stools within viewing
distance of the stage. The club draws an eclectic crowd
of people of different ages and styles.
As San Jose's only 18-and-over club, this is a great
place to watch local and underground bands play and
offers a more alternative feel.

The age of the crowd at Q's is generally 20s. The
people there are mostly professional-types looking
to unwind.
Q's has a typical uptown Palo Alto style â€” tower
ing ceilings, mahogany tables and a clean, neat fin
ish. Upon entering, there are small candle-lit tables
where you can enjoy tasty, yet pricey, appetizers and
a large variety of drinks. In this bar area, four televi
sions broadcast sporting events and news.
Towards the back are seven tournament-sized
Olhausen pool tables. Be prepared to wait for a table
on a Friday or Saturday night.
Live rock music is played on the small stage in the
center of the room. The usual bright dance lights
flash over the dance floor, which is usually crowded
on Friday and Saturday nights.
