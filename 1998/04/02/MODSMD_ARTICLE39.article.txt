San Francisco — North Beach
Most of the San Francisco clubs are located in the
favored SoMa (south of Market Street) district. Of
course, there are always the deviants, like The
Palladium in North Beach. North Beach, a notorious
red-light district, is alive with strip joints, porn shops
and catcalling, and sketchy men who slur lines like
"Are you girls naked?" and "Damn, baby, are you a
nurse, 'cause I need some mouth-to-mouth resusci
tation!"
Club-goers can choose between circling around
for hours trying to find a parking place on the street
or dole out $12 to park in a dingy, cramped structure
near the clubs.

The Palladium
where: 1031 Kearny St.
at Columbus Ave., S.F.
nights open: Thursday through Sunday
cover charge: Thurs $5, Fri $10, Sat Si 5,
Sun ladies free, guys $10
minimum age: 18
information: (415) 434-1308

The Palladium nightclub, known to some as the
"Get Laid-ium," definitely earned that name. The
most accurate description of the club is a high school
dance at best. The crowd was very young, and many
clubbers didn't even look the minimum age of 18.
Clearly, many of the clubbers were there to mack
on other people. The red walls are checkered with
mirrors, and flashing lights illuminate the dance
floor and stage for dancing. There is a vending ma
chine and a small snack bar with popcorn and candy.
Although a sign at the entrance said that a dress
code of "casual elegance" would be enforced, the nu
merous boys in white T-shirts, jeans and baseball
caps defied this rule. The girls did not personify ele
gance either and were mainly clad in tight jeans and
tank tops.
The DJ played the popular dance tunes that the
crowd wanted, and the girls crowded the dance floor
while boys sat at the surrounding tables to watch
them or lounged on the large leather black couch.
The security guards at the door and the bartender
were well dressed and friendly.

San Francisco — SoMa
The SoMa district has more clubs and bars than
North Beach. Parking is close to impossible to find
on the street. There are a few cheap, darkened out
door lots that cost $5 or $6.
The clubs are mainly located on Folsom and
Harrison streets. Don't be fooled by people who say
the clubs are within walking distance, especially if
you are wearing uncomfortable heels.

Tenls Folsom
where: 1015 Folsom St. at 6th, S.F.
nights open: Tuesday through Sunday
cover charge: $10
minimum age: 21

Ten 15 Folsom is also known as "Release" on
Saturday nights when 70s disco and funk tunes fill
the air. On Friday nights, one room features techno
music while another has '80s pop dance music. There
is a long line to get into the club, but it is worth the
wait.
DJs play acid house music in the basement, where
you can relax on a number of sofas. Upstairs there is
a lounge, a bar and an outside patio.
In the first room, a screen displays pictures of flu
orescent shapes and psychedelic colors. Another fog
filled room features a techno dance floor and high
ceilings that tower over the crowd.
The atmosphere in this room was like a faux rave.
The lights were reminiscent of a 3-1) laser show and
were by far the flashiest anywhere. In this room, a guy
approached us and asked, "Are you looking for the X?"
The crowd primarily consisted of people in their
early 20s and was very diverse. Many people, mainly
couples, danced on the floor. Although there were a
lot of people, there was still plenty of room to dance
and move around the club. People were dressed ca
sually without looking sloppy.
Unlike many clubs in the area, Ten 15 stays open
beyond the usual 2 a m closing time and sometimes
as late as 6 a.m.

Holy Cow
where: 1531 Folsom St.
near 12th Street, S.F.
nights open: seven nights a week
cover charge: "never a cover,
always a party"
minimum age: 21
information: (415) 621-6087

Holy Cow is easily recognizable because of the
huge cow hanging over the entrance. The atmos
phere seemed like that of a frat party, with a huge
number of people trying to squeeze past each other
onto a small, crowded dance floor that reeked of
sweat and beer.
The DJ played '80s rock and dance music. Local
radio station Z95.7 FM has recently broadcasted live
shows from this club.
The crowd was young, notably drunk and con
sisted mostly of prepped-out or grungy college-aged
men.
The dance floor was at the back of the room, and
there was hardly any room to dance because it was so
stuffy and crowded. Some chose to dance on tables
surrounding the dance floor.
In the center of the place was a bar which featured
16 microbrews on tap and helped keep the patrons
happy. The place had few eye-catching decorations
— except for the Holy Cow T-shirts on sale — no
lights and nowhere to sit. It was more like a bar with
music than a dance club.
Here, we were approached by two large burly
Canadian tourists who told us they had lots of
money, lots of drugs and a place to sleep but no idea
where to go. Despite their intoxication, they knew
that Holy Cow was not where they wanted to be.
The only good thing about this club was that there
was no cover charge.

DNA Lounge
where: 375 ! Ith St. at Harrison St., S.F.
nights open: seven nights a week
cover charge: $3+
minimum age: 21
information: (415) 626-1409,
http://www.dnalounge.com

If the frat scene isn't your thing, the nearby DNA
Lounge offers a different feel.
"Cheese and Crackers! Cheeeeese and Crackers!"
one of the patrons yelled as he walked out.
Yes, this club is a bit on the cheesy side, but it
seems to have no problem drawing a crowd.
This club has a ground-level dance floor and a
second- floor overlook where people can stand and
scope the people dancing below.
The crowded dance floor pulsated with energy. A
stage where bands play earlier in the night is open to
dancers once the equipment is cleared away.
The clubbers ranged in age from early 20s to early
30s. There were a lot of guys checking out the women
and moving in on them. Still, it did not feel like a
meat market because their advances were aimed only
where they were welcome.
Patrons can buy drinks at either of the bars located
upstairs and downstairs. An ATM is also conve
niently located next to the bar. And if you need to
satisfy your sweet tooth, clubbers can buy sweets
from a woman showered in glitter and glowing
makeup selling candy upstairs.
The DNA Lounge stays open, until 4 a.m. on
weekends.
San Francisco — Mission District
Over in the heart of the historic Mission District,
club-goers can get away from the cheese and crackers
of the club scene and go to the relaxed atmosphere of
the Elbo Room.
Trying to find parking near the club is a chore.
There are no public lots, and spaces on the streets are
mostly taken by the locals. But parking and walking
the eight blocks can be well worth it.

Elbo Room
where: 647 Valencia St.
between 17th and 18th, S.F.
nights open: seven nights a week
cover charge: $4-$5
minimum age: 21
information: (415) 552-7788,
http://www.elbo.com

On the Elbo Room's first level, a packed room of
mostly college-age people hang out as background
music plays. In the back are two rooms, and each has
a pool table. Near the restrooms is an ATM.
Up the stairs is the dance floor where people can
move to the live bands or DJs. Although this room is
pretty small, it is not as crowded as the downstairs
bar. Towards the back is another bar, and in the cor
ner are another pool table and video games.
Every day trom 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. is happy hour,
when patrons can get Anchor Steam pints for $1.75
orsl off other drinks.
Monday nights, you can catch the house band,
Corazon, and munch on the complimentary salsa
and chips.
