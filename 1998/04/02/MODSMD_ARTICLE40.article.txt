## Silverjet: 'Pull me up... drag me down' 
### 
Clad in fashionable 70s thrift attire on the cover of its new release, Silverjet pretends to be another
innocuous indie band stranded at the Goodwill. But one listen to "Pull me up ... drag me down
and even my grandmother would be able to immediately see through this farce: Silverjet is totally
from the '80s.
"Pull me up ... drag me down" is filled with '80s rock gems. "Meant to Be" is cheery and hook-filled.
"That Call" is an embarrassingly catchy semi-ballad reminiscent of the love songs of White Lion and Bon
Jovi (yeah, pretend you don't remember).
In fact, as the album progresses, you start to think Silverjet's going to pull all of this off. But then
comes "When She Smiles." Compare "When She Smiles" to Tom Wait's "When I See You Smile" ... co
incidence? With a title like that, it's impossible to avoid cliched sappiness. Add unintentionally hilarious
falsetto vocals, and you've got a problem bigger than '80s hair.
However, Silverjet doesn't completely ignore the '90s. "Kid," its ode to unrequited love and indie
queens, is not only fun to sing along with, but also has cute lyrics like "maybe she'd dig me if I was
Thurston Moore."
Silverjet missed its decade. But a little nostalgia hidden behind a friendly '90s face is good for every
one ... well, unless you hated Cheap Trick, Foreigner, and '80s rock even when it was cool to like them.
