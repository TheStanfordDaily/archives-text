# The 						Club That Plays Itself
## 
### 
Nowadays, you can't make a
movie without releasing a
soundtrack to go along with it.
Usually, the soundtrack comes out after
the movie. However, this is not the case
with "The Flayer's Club," Ice Cube's
soundtrack from Heavyweight records.
Maybe Ice Cube just couldn't wait.
He should have.
The first two cuts from this album
are different versions of the already re
leased hit "We Be Clubbing." The song
has been playing for weeks. You can
hear it on all the radio stations catering
to rap and hip-hop fans. It is blaring
out of cars driving around campus and
audible behind some closed doors.
The beat was kinda hype, especially
the remixed version with DMX. Maybe
the shout-outs at the end, where Ice Cube
asks almost every city on the map to
"show me love up in the club," went on
for too long, but the song itself was cool
enough to make you want to hear what
the rest of the album would sound like.
Don't bother. "We Be Clubbing," the
first cut released from the soundtrack,
was a tease.

"The Players Club" is a mess of ill
matched songs. This album supposedly
features "various artists," but at least one
fourth of the songs are by Ice Cube.
Kurupt's song, "Under Pressure," is a
tribute to smoking weed and "living my
life hustling / struggling / under pres
sure / under pressure." Master P, Mack
10 and Scarface round out the descrip
tions of the life by painting pictures of
delinquents and whores in the songs
"You Know I'm a Ho" and "You
Delinquent."
Added to this are smooth vocals by
Changing Faces on "Same Tempo," a cut
dedicated to taking one's time before
rushing into sex. Brownstone's song,
"Don't Play Me Wrong," which tells
men to treat women right, likewise has
smooth vocals.
These songs are beautifully done but
seem out of place. I wonder if these
ladies heard the whole album, or if
they got confused like I did and said
"no more" after song three? Or was it
four?
