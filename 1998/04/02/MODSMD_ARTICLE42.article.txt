# BMX Bandits 'Theme Park'
## 
### 
Why do bands always seem to feel
the need to write a "founda
tion" song, forcing the listener
to hear the many trials and triumphs that
led to their success?
"Theme Park" begins with such a song,
and its insipid lyrics serve as a foreboding
sign for the rest of the CD: "Back in '85 I

had a dream / We'd be a band, we'd be a
team." Luckily, the first song by these
Scottish musicians turns out to be the
worst, and the music does become more
interesting as the album progresses, cul
minating in two ethereal instrumental
that tease the listener with what this cd
could have been: an elegant synthesis of
tin whistles and violins with traditional
rock instruments. Unfortunately, the lis
tener only gets glimpses of this more
creative, vocal-less side.
Meanwhile, the BMX Bandits end up
sounding like a poor Scottish interpre
tation of the Beach Boys, and are only
successful when they switch to their
guest vocalists. In"I Wanna Fall in Love"
and "Before the Blue Moon," Kle adds a
refreshing Heavenly-esque element to
the BMX Bandits' pop. In "Opel
Mantra," Anne Moyon and Phillipe
Katerine dreamily recite French over an
intricate synthesizer and bass back
ground. Those who have tired of the
BMX Bandits' inane lyrics will likely
find this last song particularly pleasing,
provided that they don't possess the
French language skills necessary to deci
pher the words.
