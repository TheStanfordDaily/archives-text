OK, you got me.
I vnch's debut, an album of stunningly mediocre pop, mixes

electronica

with a guiding aesthetic sense (alt-rock)
that has already been beaten

like a dead horse.
I.vnch is just someone

else who uses Nirvana-es

ground voices and intermittent sound effects. Heavily dis
torted verses and clean choruses (or vice versa) wreck what

would otherwise he a collection of engaging pop hooks.
liven if it were possible to overlook the musical monstrosity,
l.yncli's album has a huge problem. It attempts to use socially.con
scious (and condemning) lyrics and fails. There are two reasons for

this: first, Lynch doesn't say anything cohesive, and second, what he man-

ages to sptf out has alread)' been said. And its been said better.
One good cut on the album, "Anybody Out I here,' is a beautiful midtempo ballad
echoing Tom Hetty's best work, but it's one that Fink Floyd fans will find sacrilegious.

"Is there anybody out there? / Is there anyone at all? / Is there anyone

who'll listen? / To a man against a wall?," lynch wails as he pla

t-iari/es Lloyd's "t l»e Wall." Mavbe he figures the folks who

• " • "*• ~v
listen to Live 105 L\l will think he came up with

that nitty metaphor himself.
The best thing about this

album is Lynch's take on
the competing roles
of television and radio

in modern culture. His self-indulgent total condemnation
of television, is unfortunate, hut there's a spark of soul.here

that saves Lynch from complete disaster.
Either way, treat yourself right and skip this one. Get
some Ween instead.
