# Bare Wire Delicatessen
## 
### 
Once in a while, something beautiful comes
along that changes the way we look at the
world. Bare Wire's "Delicatessen" is one of
those things.
Bare Wire is the name of a project by Simone
Grey, who wrote, performed and produced the en
tire album. She has a haunting, ethereal voice simi
lar to that of Tori Amos, but without Amos' jagged
edge of anger and turbfilence.
But "Delicatessen" isn't emotionally barren; bar
renness is the antithesis of this album.
"Delicatessen" is packed with explosive lyrics delv
ing into the relationship of relationships and emo
tions themselves.
But the delivery of the lyrics is what makes Grey's
project unique and enthralling. Solo vocal tracks
become woven with multiple other vocal tracks, of
ten with a soft, slow and deep bass beat pulsing like
a heart at the center of the track.
The best thing about this album is the hidden
track, a wonderful five-minute track of gentle elec
tronica that crests and dips in luxurious waves.
The hidden track is a surprise biscuit at the bot
tom of the basket, but it's so good that the absence
of similar pieces throughout the album becomes a
shame.
