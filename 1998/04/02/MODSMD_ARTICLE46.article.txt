## Butch Cassidy and the Newton Kids? 'The Newton Boys' is more than a babefest 
### 
Soon alter I walked into the theater on the opening
night of "The Newton Boys," I feared I had made a
mistake. It seemed that Leonardo's fan club had

gotten lost, and instead of marching like lem
mings into another screening of "Titanic,"
these preteen girls had packed themselves
into our cozy theater.
The cries of "Oh, baby!" as soon as
Matthew McConaughey appeared on
screen, however, made it clear that they were
simply looking for another cute young guy
(or four) to gawk at.
The four young guys that our lovable pre
teens came to gawk at were McConaughey,
Ethan Hawke, Skeet Ulrich and Vincent
D'Onofrio as Willis, Jess, Joe and Dock
Newton, respectively. The Newton boys are
your stereotypical cowboys-turned-bank
robbers who have decided that a home on the
range isn't enough for them.
Willis leads his brothers into the outlaw
business when he can't seem to find enough
respect or success. Willis has already served
time in a penitentiary for a crime he appar
ently did not commit. He uses this experience
as an excuse for turning to a life of crime and
convinces his brothers to follow him.
If this setup sounds familiar, that is proba
bly because you've seen it before. From the
opening credits, modeled after title cards

from early silent films and antique portraits, the film is
distinctly reminiscent of "Butch Cassidy and the

Sundance Kid." At times, director Richard Linklater
seems to be shamelessly ripping off "Butch Cassidy"
right down to the fiddle-and-banjo-ridden score.
But unlike its prototype, which ends with a freeze
frame on the impending early demise of Butch and
Sundance, the last half of "The Newton Boys" dwells on
the troubles of outlaws trying to get out of the game.
This is almost unheard of outside of Mafia films.
It is at this point that you realize the film is a true
story. It's a biographical picture imitating a similar bi
ography from 30 years past. It is infinitely more inter
esting than the average cookbook-action-picture imi
tating whatever made money the previous year. The fact
that this story contains very little of what we haven't al
ready seen on the screen is of little consequence. Come
to think of it, I don't mind the banjos as long as they're
not ripping off the soundtrack from "Titanic," or should
I say, "Braveheart?"
"The Newton Boys" is the latest from Linklater, the
acclaimed independent director of "Slacker" and
"Dazed and Confused." This film is a big step up for
him. The film's $27 million budget exceeds total expen
ditures on his first four films combined. But don't
sweat, Linklater, Leonardo's fan club seems willing to
fork over the price of a ticket for any movie with the
word "boys" in the title.

The real Newton boys weren't this good-looking.
