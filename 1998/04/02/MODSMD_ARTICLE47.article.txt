# All for Leo and Leo for all
## If only 'The Man in the Iron Mask' cculd get past Mr. DiCaprio... 
### 
If you plan to go see "The Man in the Iron Mask," 1 rec
ommend opting for the latest showing available.
Why? Well, if you keep your fingers crossed, the late
show may be after the curfews of the legions of Leonardo
DiCaprio fans who are flocking to see his new film. If you
brave the preteen and teenage crowd, you may leave the
theater wondering what happened, since you'll spend the
duration of the film, like I did, trying to block out squeals
of adolescent desire.
In terms of scream time, "The Man in the Iron Mask"
makes things worse by giving DiCaprio a dual role and
double the screen time. DiCaprio plays both the despotic
French King Louis XIV and his imprisoned twin brother
Philippe. You can only imagine the reactions of adoles
cent girls to scenes featuring — gasp! — two Leonardos.
Double the DiCaprio, double the eardrum damage.
So how does the oft-lauded DiCaprio fare in this challeng
ing role? Not too notably. He relies on his prettiness (magni
fied by long, 17th- century locks and ornate costumes) and
two facial expressions — sneering for evil King Louis and
sniveling for sweet Philippe. And it is interesting to note that
both 17th century Frenchmen seemed to have been raised in
West Los Angeles.
Of course, I was probably also the only one who had never
learned in history class that the three Musketeers were British
(Jeremy Irons is priestly Aramis) American (John Malkovich
is vengeful Athos) and French (Gerard Depardieu is lusty,
gluttonous Porthos) respectively. Or that Captain
D'Artagnan was Irish (Gabriel Byrne). Accent inconsistencies
aside, all four give good performances. And like the

Musketeers they portray, the actors must often step in to rescue their leader's poor performance.
Despite DiCaprio's one-note performance and the multinational Musketeers, "The Man in the Iron
Mask" is actually an entertaining swashbuckling movie. Its premise (that the now-retired Musketeers ac
cept one last jaunt to restore dignity to the French throne) is interesting despite the obvious and sometimes
painful liberties the film takes with history.
If someone could figure out a way to still the beating hearts (and shrieks) of teenage girls everywhere,
"The Man in the Iron Mask" might actually be an enjoyable moviegoing experience.

I don't know — Leo's costume just doesn't
look very manly.
