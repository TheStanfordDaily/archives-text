# Where the stereotypes are
## 'Wild Things' entertains in spite of plastic actors 
### 
The much-hyped "Wild Things" is
a film driven by three things,
none of which make for a very
good murder-mystery: breasts (Denise
Richards'), acute comic timing (Bill
Murray's) and a rapid-fire series of plot
twists. Combined with an excellent
cast, however, those three elements lead
to an entertaining movie.
Set in the town of Blue Bay in south
Florida, the movie begins with high
roller Kelly Van Ryan (Richards) and
swamp trash Suzie Toller (Neve
Campbell) accusing their high school
guidance counselor Sam Lombardo
(Matt Dillon) of rape.
Dillon beats the rap with the help of
his low-rent lawyer, Ken Dowden
(Murray). But detectives Ray Duquette
(Kevin Bacon) and Cloria Perez
(Daphne Rubin-Vega) suspect that the
whole thing is a sham set up by Kelly,
Suzie and Sam to get to Kelly's $8.3 mil
lion trust fund.
"Wild Things" takes off from there,
offering a series of plot twists even

more outrageous than those
in"The Usual Suspects." The
only thing is, "The Usual
Suspects" is a much better
movie.
The most important thing
for murder-mystery flicks is
that they need to be tense;
"Wild Things" has only fleet
ing moments of tension.
There is no sustained build
up of suspense as there is in
"The Usual Suspects," mostly
because rapid plot changes
prevent its development.

"Wild Things" has that rosy, Hollywood
make-believe tint to it.
Director John McNaughton tries to
remedy a lack of character development
through the use of an interesting cine
matic device — a series short clips inter
spersed through the closing credits.
These scenes act as "missing parts" of the
movie and give depth to the characters,
especially Campbell's. The thing is, she's
not the one that needs it since she plays

the movie's most fully developed charac
ter.
There are several things that are right
with this movie. Murray is superb, as
are an edgy Campbell, a manipulative
Richards and a surprisingly complex
Rubin-Vega.
Dillon and Bacon are unfortunately
stiff (excuse the pun on Bacon's gratu
itous full-frontal shot), and the prob
lem is exacerbated by their ridiculous

dialogue. "You're killing me," and
"You're going to get me drowned,"
Bacon jokes, moments before Dillon
does exactly that.
"Wild Things" isn't a bad movie, and
it's fully entertaining. The myriad fans
of Neve, Bill, Matt and Kevin will like it,
and it will earn Denise her fair share. So
enjoy it for what it is: fun. Don't see it
hoping for a thriller.
