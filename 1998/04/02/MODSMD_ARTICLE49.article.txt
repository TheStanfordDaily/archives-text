# Renee Zellweger's semi-awakening
## 'A Price Above Rubies' lacks a strong leading character 
### 
Forget true love. Forget happiness. If you want to watch a repressed
Renee Zellweger try to retrieve her life from the men who hurt and
stifled her, go see "A Price Above Rubies."
Sonia (Zellweger) is a young wife in New York City who is still nurs
ing her baby, yet harbors thoughts of freedom from her conventional
Jewish marriage. Her husband, Sender (Christopher Eccleston), is a per
fect Jewish scholar who has not changed since his youth. Vulnerable and
quiet, he is scared to rrfake love to Sonia passionately for fear that it will
anger God.
On the other hand, Sonia's brother-in-law Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald)
is eager to make love to her whenever he pleases — he offers her work at
his jewelry shop in return for sex. But Sonia is unhappy in both cases —
the sex is for the men, not for her. She is searching for something more,
something for herself.
While she works at the underground jewelry shop, she discovers
Ramon, a black jewelry designer who makes exquisite and unique ear
rings, rings and sculptures. Following him to his shop, she eventually de
cides to open herself up to him as he, in turn, opens himself up to her.
As liberating as the story seems, I was left unfulfilled the end. Sonia
leaves her job, her husband and even her baby to live with Ramon. The
point of the story is that she must leave her stifling life behind in order
to find her freedom. But by the end of the story, she still seems weak and
unfocused.
Sonia seems to be leaving without great thought, relinquishing her re
sponsibilities as if they were only dreams in the past. The story is com
parable to Kate Chopin's "The Awakening," but for some reason Sonia
seems to have less heart and less direction when she leaves.
Zellweger plays the part of Sonia to a credible degree, displaying the
emotions of a washed-out mother and wife. She is not convincing as a
heroine, but perhaps she was not meant to be.

The movie has a depressing tone from beginning to end. It left me with
the feeling that something was still missing — strength and passion.
