# Maples expansion possible, but not in immediate future
## 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
With the remarkable growth and success of the Stan
ford men's and women's basketball programs t his decade,
a lot of people are asking whether Maples Pavilion w ill be
expanded in the near future.
Don't bet on it. according to Athletic Director Ted Le
land.
Leland acknowledged that the Athletics Department
hired a management consulting firm. Bain & Company,
to examine the long-range financial outlook of the de
partment. and that one possibility they considered was
the expansion of the 7.391-seat campus arena.
However, he added that this project is in its very pre
liminary stages with no timetable set. With the opening of
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium last vear and the reno

vation of the Harry Maloney Soccer Field this past fall, it
could he four or five years before a Maples expansion gets
serious consideration.
"The big thing is where the l'ni\ersit\ "spriorities are."
Leland said. The Athletics Department has "spent $55 to
$b0 million in the past five years and with another $2() mil
lion coming up. it's kind of like. 'When's it going to
stop?'"
Despite this possible expansion not being high on the
department's list of priorities nght now. the preliminary
talks are probably a sign that Stanford has noticed that it
has become the smallest basketball arena in the Pacific 10
Conference. With a capacity of 7.391. it is just behind the
University of Washington's 7,870-seat Hec Edmundson
Pavilion and a far crv from the L'niversitv of Arizona's
14,489-seat McKale Center.
Also, just across the Bay, UC-
Berkeley has been undergoing a two
year project to replace 6,(XX)-seat
Harmon Gym with 12,50()-seat Haas
Pavilion. That project, despite its
many delays, is set to open in time for
the 1999-2000 season.
There is probably also a hesita

tion to expand because, as Leland
acknowledges, Stanford is not los
ing money on Maples. This past
season, the men's program sold a
record 6,000 season tickets while
attendance averaged 6,743, includ
ing nine sellouts. Meanwhile, the
women's team averaged a healthy
5,257 per game.
At the present capacity and given
the current strength of the programs,
the department will always be en
sured a full or nearly full house at

practically every basketball game. A
larger arena might not carry the same
guarantee.
Furthermore, dramatic expansion
might make Maples lose its home
court edge. The arena's small scale
makes it one of the best places in the
Pac-10 to watch a basketball game
and for opponents, one of the tough
est to play in.
"This past year, [the men's team]
played Connecticut up in Storrs and
they got beat," Leland said." But next

year when they come to play here,
we're going to play them in Maples,
and we're going to beat them."
With the men's team likely to get
a preseason Top 5 ranking in 1998-
99, next year's schedule could be sold
out to season-ticket holders. Could
that hasten the expansion of
Maples?
"I'd rather not say at this point,"
Leland said. "You always want big
ger, higher, stronger, faster, but again
it's probably a long ways away."
