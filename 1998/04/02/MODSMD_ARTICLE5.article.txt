# Maples expansion possible, but not in immediate future

### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
With the remarkable growth and success of the Stan
ford men's and women's basketball programs t his decade,
a lot of people are asking whether Maples Pavilion w ill be
expanded in the near future.
Don't bet on it. according to Athletic Director Ted Le
land.
Leland acknowledged that the Athletics Department
hired a management consulting firm. Bain & Company,
to examine the long-range financial outlook of the de
partment. and that one possibility they considered was
the expansion of the 7.391-seat campus arena.
However, he added that this project is in its very pre
liminary stages with no timetable set. With the opening of
the Taube Family Tennis Stadium last vear and the reno

vation of the Harry Maloney Soccer Field this past fall, it
could he four or five years before a Maples expansion gets
serious consideration.
"The big thing is where the l'ni\ersit\ "spriorities are."
Leland said. The Athletics Department has "spent $55 to
$b0 million in the past five years and with another $2() mil
lion coming up. it's kind of like. 'When's it going to
stop?'"
Despite this possible expansion not being high on the
department's list of priorities nght now. the preliminary
talks are probably a sign that Stanford has noticed that it
has become the smallest basketball arena in the Pacific 10
Conference. With a capacity of 7.391. it is just behind the
University of Washington's 7,870-seat Hec Edmundson
Pavilion and a far crv from the L'niversitv of Arizona's
