Unfortunately, we didn't get very many good pieces this week, so we are
running the best of the ones that we did get. Thanks, those of you featured this
week, for taking time out of your busy schedules to send us some quality stutt.

Lets try an experiment: how about if next week's entries all describe just how
annoying and awful it is that the sky thinks rain is acceptable at this point in the
academic year ,

So, if bunches of you enter the 27-word fiction contest with irate pieces •
about rain, perhaps the sky will get the point and the sun will come out. Let's try
exploring the existence of a sky deity that listens to our weather wishes. We could
change the course of history.

Should be lots of fun.
