# Getting Tested
## free sexx 
### Mae West Coltrane 
So you want to try getting
tested for AIDS.
You could have a couple
different reasons — it's been a
while, you've never been tested
and you just want to make sure
all is weil, or else you've done
something stupid that put you
at risk.
"Risk" is anything that in
volves swapping of body fluids,
such as kissing someone with a
split lip (OK, it's technically
possible, even though there are
no recorded cases of HIV
transmission this way), getting
a blood transfusion in a Third
World country, sharing hypo
dermic needles, going down on
a friend or plain old unpro
tected sex.
Even if you know you're
fine, it can't hurt to make sure,
right? Get yourself an appoint
ment for a test. There are free
and low-cost HIV testing ser
vices all over the place, but if
you're a Stanford student, you
might as well keep it simple and
just call up Cowell (3-4841).
The procedure itself does
n't take more than a few min
utes, just long enough to draw
5 cc's of blood. If you're squea
mish when it comes to needles,
I'm afraid you're out of luck —
blood testing is the only reli
able way to go right now. It you
start feeling sick, close your
eyes and think of a lemon (I
swear it helps) and it'll be over
in a matter of seconds They'll
tape a little wad of g.iuze on the
needle hole (wear it with
pride!) and send you home.
The results come back in
about 10 to 14 days. They won't
give you the results over the
telephone, even if it's good
news. You'll have to set up an
appointment, either with a
peer counselor or with a clini
cian. They'll sit you down, and
they'll give you the yes or no,
and then they'll tell you about
your options.
If your test comes back
negative, be a little bit wary
about rejoicing, especially if
you're getting tested because
you've been engaging in risky
behavior. The test doesn't mea
sure the actual presence of HIV
in your blood, it measures the
antibodies your immune sys
tem produces to fight off the
virus. So if it hasn't been long
enough since /oa last put your
self at risk, there might not be
enough antibodies in your
blood for the test to come back
positive, even if you are truly
infected. To be absolutely sure
you're clean, get tested again in
six months (and meanwhile,

behave yourself).
If you really are clean, good
for you. There's no reason not
to stay that way. If you're hav
ing intercourse, use protection
(latex, not animal skin). If
you're using needles, clean
them thoroughly and carefully
with bleach and water (make
absolutely sure you know how
to do this — it's easy to kill
yourself if you mess up), or
better yet, don't share them.
If your test comes back
positive, it's not a death sen
tence. For one thing, a positive
test doesn't necessarily mean
you have HIV, though false
positive results are a lot less
common now than they were a
few years ago.
But just in case, get another
test or two, preferably some
where other than where you
got the first one.
If you are infected, there are
a lot of resources for you. The
counselor you talk to can point
you toward numerous physical
health specialists who can talk
to you about treatments —
drug cocktails, acupuncture
and herbs, and just taking good
care of yourself.
Your body isn't the only
thing you need to pay attention
to. It's just as important to
make sure you're OK mentally
and emotionally. Nobody ex
pects you to play it cool or to
deal with this on your own.
Cowell can help you find some
one to talk to, to help you cope
with your emotions and deal
with issues like telling your
family and friends.
Now then, AIDS is the big
name in sexually transmitted
diseases lately, which is as it
should be, but that doesn't
mean you're home free if you
don't have it. Pay attention to
your body and get to know the
way it works normally, and if
you notice something out of
the ordinary (sores, discharge,
pain, foul smells, itching... ),
get thee to the doctor ASAP.
A basic checkup at the
Cowell women's care clinic will
find most of your garden-vari
ety STDs (pun definitely in
tended), and also includes a
breast exam and a pap smear
— a good deal even if neither
of your regions are in any kind
of distress — and men can
make an appointment for the
not-quite-so-equivalent-but
it's-all-we-got checkup. It's
generally a smart idea to get
yourself checked every couple
years even if you live a pure,
chaste and fully protected life.
If by chance you have caught
something, the sooner you start
treating it, the better.
Co forth and play safe now.
