# Stocks prove lucrative
## Student investors start early 
### Art Diaz Contributing writer 
Cashing in the big bucks through
the stock market isn't just reserved
for old men with fat pockets. Many
students at Stanford amass small for
tunes by reaping the benefits of in
vesting in the market.
Some students, like freshman Josh
Allen, are using stocks to prepare for
the future and to pay their Stanford
tuition bill.
Allen's personal wealth began
when his parents invested for him in
long-term stixks that reaped enor
mous gains after 15 years. The stixks
have risen from what Allen estimates
as an initial investment of several
thousand dollars to what is now tens
of thousands ot dollars enough for
at least three years of a Stanford edu
cation.

"It's not like I want to be an eco
nomics major. It's a good way to plan
for the future." said Allen, who is
presently taking Economics 1. 'Til
use it to plan for my kids."
Another investor, cotenninal stu
dent Steven Liu. works in fixed-in
come derivatives trading at his place
of employment, Lehman Brothers.
Liu has his own investment strategy
and philosophy as he focuses on the
global economy. Currently he has as
much as $450,000 invested in Asian
marker and about $150,000 in the
United States market
Liu's present focus is on emerging
markets, especially in Asia, as he be
lieves that the existing undervalued
stivks wilt soon be on the rise.
"This next month could be a great
time to buy Japan. Korea and Hong
Kong, as Japan is forced to stimulate
its economy and help its neighbors,"

Liu explained.
Liu's philosophy is based on his
belief that investors move like sheep,
following news on hot trends, such as
the current statement that "Asia is
risky."
"The tnck here is to find the com
panies and assets which are being
sold for no reason other than group
panic and see if they can weather a
temporary reduction of investment
and foreign capital." Liu explained.
"11 they're still in great shape, then
b\ all means buy them at the bargain
prices."
Senior Andy Pelletier has been in
vesting in the stock market since his
freshman year. Fhis year, he was able
to trade stock options usually re
served for experienced traders.
"When I applied to trade with the
online trading system, Datek, I exag
gerated my income so they would let
me trade stock options," Pelletier
said. "I don't see the point in owning
stocks anymore. Options are more

lucrative, really."
Pelletier's first major trade as a
freshman was a disappointing loss
for him. He lost several thousand
dollars when his Acclaim stock
plummeted.
"I tried to console myself by say
ing, 'a few grand will be nothing to me
in a few years,' " Pelletier said.

Since this summer, Pelletier has
more than recovered his losses and
now prospers as a trader with a port
folio exceeding $20,(XX) in value. He
earned much of his fortune by day
trading over the summer, using a se
cret weapon known mainly to stu
dents at the Graduate School of Busi
ness: the Bloomberg terminal. This

machine was donated by a Stanford
alumnus and retails for over $40,(XX) a
year.
The terminal provides the service
of offering groundbreaking news as it
occurs, even before it hits the Associ
ated Press wire. Traders ean use it to
obtain real-time stock quotes and
react as news happens.
