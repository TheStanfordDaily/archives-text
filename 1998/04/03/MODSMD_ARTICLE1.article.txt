# Trends in college financial aid shift

Stanford's re
cent rise in finan
cial aid and low tu
ition increase re
flects a nation
wide trend.
The Board of
Trustees an
nounced in Feb
ruary that Stan-

ford will spend an additional $3.K
million per year on financial aid.
Next year, Stanford tuition will in
crease by 3.S percent, which is com
parable to the low increase in tuition
at other private universities. "During
the 1980s, 1 remember that the in
creases in tuition [for Stanford) were
much higher than those in the
19905," said Cynthia Rife, director of
student awards. In 1989, tuition was
raised 8 percent.
Rife explained that the changes
will affect about a third of Stanford's
student population. They are applic
able to current classes, as well as in
coming freshmen.
This trend has been apparent in
other competitive private universi
ties, such as Princeton and Yale.
There has been some speculation
that schools are choosing to increase
their financial aid in order to remain
competitive to applicants.
According to Dean of Admis
sions and Financial Aid Robert kin
nallv. however, Stanford's decision
was not influenced by the announce
ments of either Princeton or Yale.
Rife suggested that the cause of
the trend could be pressure from the
National Commission on the Cost of
Higher Education, a Congressional
panel appointed to find ways to de
crease the cost of higher education.
"For this reason, [these institutions]
are reluctant to increase tuition dra
matically." Rife said.
"Stanford has been minimizing
costs to keep tuition increase to a
minimum for the past five to six
years. Cutbacks in the administrative
personnel were one of the first meth
ods in doing this," she added.
The additional money for this in
crease in financial aid came from the
operating budget as well as Universi

ty President Gerhard Casper's re
allocation of certain funds.
The reason Stanford made these
policy changes this year is largely due
to the results of research conducted
in fall 1997 by the ( ommittee on I Jn
dergraduate Admissions and Finan
cial Aid.
"We keep our linger on the pulse
of families," Kinnally explained.
"This change was motivated by re
search last year that showed that pay
ing tuition was a real stretch for some
families, usually due to our assess
ment of home equity as an asset."
The outside scholarship policy
has also changed. Previously, any
money from jobs or outside scholar
ships was mainly used to replace part
of the scholarship awarded by Stan
ford. Now. outside scholarships go
directly to decreasing loans and
work-study.
"Student debt is a big concern of
mine. Stanford students are among
the most resourceful in the world,
and we wanted to reward them. The
most important part is you will get
more money." Kinnally said.
Even though the decisions were
announced in February, few students
know about the changes. Freshman
Holly Goodliffe was enthusiastic
when she heard about them. "There
is no way I could come to Stanford
without my awesome financial aid
package. I think it's wonderful that
they want to give us more!"
However, some students were
skeptical. "I think my parents will
still have to negotiate for next year's
financial aid anyway. I guess it's a
good thing, though," said Marie
Wong, also a freshman.
The Financial Aid Office has also
made service changes, such as the in
teractive voice response system,
which allows students to call in to
find out the status of their financial
aid applications, as well as the avail
ability of loans. Their new toll-free
number is (KSX) FAO-3773.
"We will be looking into increas
ing international student aid." Kin
nallv remarked. "We fund a good
number of international students
every year with a total of approxi
mately $4(X).(XX) to $S(X).(XX). We're
just starting to look at expanding this
base."
