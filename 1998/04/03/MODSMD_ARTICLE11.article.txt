# Jones' case reversal unlikely

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Paula
Jones' lawyers will confront an exceeding
ly difficult endeavor if they seek to revive
her sexual harassment lawsuit against
President Clinton, legal experts said yes
terday.
"Nothing's impossible hut it's very
hard to turn around a summary judg
ment." said Ernest Rossieilo, a Chicago
lawyer who represents sexual harassment
plaintiffs. "I'm reading the Jones decision
now and I think the judge was very cor
rect. She followed the law of her circuit."
On appeal. Jones' legal team would
have to convince a three-judge panel of
the Bth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that
Judge Susan Webber Wright made some
error of law in deciding that a trial is
unnecessary.
They would be bucking a decade-long
trend in federal courts of killing lawsuits,
especially employment-bias disputes,
before they reach a jury.
"District court judges used to routinely
deny summary-judgment motions and
allow cases to go to trial," said law profes
sor Kathrvn Urbonva of William and

Mary College. "That all changed with a
trilogy of 19H6 Supreme Court rulings
that encouraged judges to save taxpayers'
time and money if a plaintiffs allegations,
even when taken as gospel, don't add up
to a legal claim."
As a result, said University of Min
nesota Law Professor Suzanna Sherry, "it
has become more and more likely that
summary judgments won't be reversed."
That's so even though the Nth Circuit
court would make its own determination
of the legal issues in Jones' case, giving
no real deference to Judge Wright's lind
ings.
The judge's ruling Wednesday said the
allegations made by Jones, if true, could
not amount to illegal sexual harassment.
The judge rejected two separate theories
of harassment the lawsuit had advanced:
That then-Gov. Clinton's actions
had created a "hostile environment" in
her workplace.
That he had committed what
lawyers call "quid-pro-quo" sexual
harassment by linking job-advancement
opportunities to sexual favors and threat

ening retaliation it those favors were with
held.
To the first. Judge Wright said the one
incident alleged in the lawsuit did not
amount to the sustained and pervasive
conduct needed to show a hostile work
envin mment.
To the second, she said a quid-pro-quo
harassment claim must allege some job
related harm as a result of sexual favors
being withheld.
Federal appeals courts are split on that
second point, and the Supreme Court is
expected to resolve the matter after hear
ing arguments in a ( hicago case later this
month.
It's conceivable that if the Supreme
Court savs no showing of job-related
harm is required, the Bth Circuit court
would order Judge Wright to restudv
Jones' case in light of that new standard.
But the judge may have anticipated
that possibility. Her 39-page decision said
that Jones would not be able to prove
quid-pro-quo harassment under any stan
dard because she never sufficiently
aliened that Clinton threatened her.
