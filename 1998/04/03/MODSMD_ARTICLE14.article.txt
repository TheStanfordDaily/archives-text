## Editorial Pay graduate RAs

Providing salaries to grad
uate RAs helps ensure
dedication to residents

PRIOR TO SPRING break, the
University announced that
graduate Resident Assistant
positions will no longer be salaried.
Starting next year, the positions will be
filled by volunteers. In doing so, the
Graduate Housing Office will get what
it pays for — graduate RAs who run
hot and cold in their performance,
much like the unpaid advising associ
ate* Itt rhe undergraduate realm.
The housing office has made a cost
cutting move, eliminating approxi
mately $1(K).(KK) from its budget. The
question is whether or not this change
will severely impact the quality of
graduate RAs who will accept the
positions in the coming years.
Most graduate RAs accept their
position for the opportunity to pro
vide programming and social events
for their residents. In addition to
receiving a budget for programming,
these RAs are also guaranteed hous
ing for themselves and another per
son. Whereas the housing office might
say that this is enough of an incentive
for the typical graduate student who
wants to be an RA, this is a very short
sighted and socially irresponsible
position.
Indeed, it seems as if the housing
office is taking advantage of the fact
that housing in the surrounding com
munities is so expensive that students
are willing to do almost anything to

obtain on-campus accommodations.
Moreover, what makes this position
so distasteful is that the housing office
actively promotes its role as a commu
nity builder, but does not allocate the
financial resources necessary to create
such an atmosphere.
The $500 per quarter currently
being paid to graduate RAs barely
covers a month of housing expenses
for the typical graduate student. In
reality, it is more of an honorarium
than a salary. And it works out to be
approximately $5 per hour for all of
the tasks the graduate RA performs in
his or her 10-hour week. Rather than
removing the only financial compen
sation graduate RAs are given, why
doesn't the housing office increase the
salary to more accurately reflect the
time and effort dedicated to the tasks
of lock-outs, rentals, programming and
resident management?
The housing office ought to reflect
on the relative effectiveness of and
sense of satisfaction felt by undergrad
uate RAs and undergraduate AAs.
The former, who are housed, paid and
strongly involved in dorm program
ming, generally enjoy their jobs.
By contrast the latter are volun
teers, who work sporadically, range in
effectiveness from hot to cold, and
have very mixed feelings about their
jobs.
Finally, the issues of cost cutting
should not be a major issue in this time
of increased enrollment and potential
ly greater revenues due to the
Crothers Memorial Hall housing
changes. Use the money for the good
of the graduate community, rather
than budget cost cutting.
