## Touched for the very first time 
### 
I AWAKEN TO seag
ulls pecking and crap
ping all over me.
Those bastards. Their
menacing gawks are my
alarm clock. Last night
was a rough one.
When 1 felt the cold con-

Crete instead of my nice
comfortable metal transport rack. T knew
that it would not be long until 1 faced this
rude awakening. Angela Marie Acosta, stu
dent #4531620, was to blame this time. It
would have been so easy to place me inside
with my friends. Instead, I slept in the cold
beside Reggie, a disgusting mauve tray
coated with mayonnaise and soy beans.
Not like 1 had any justification for com
plaining — on top of my beautiful face is a
vile combination of rejected food service
offerings, la crap de la crap. First there is a
thin layer of skanky skim milk just deep
enough to conceal the seagulls' diseased
feet. Swimming in the milk are bloated
croutons, eggplant lasagna remnants and
the half-eaten crust of some beef pot pie.
In addition, I am a yellow tray — the
plainest, dirtiest and most beaten up of all
of the trays. The other trays call me
Ramone; I like to call myself the Trayana
tor. However, with my wretched appear
ance comes respect. I have endured the
worst that a Stanford student or dining ser
vice itself could ever dish out. I have been
dropped from heights of 4 feet, flung onto
the hard tile of the kitchen floor, pelted
with shattered glass and sexually assaulted
by the great gray demon known only as
Hobart.

I have completed eight tours of duty
serving in Florence Moore. Kicker. Stern
and the swampy badlands of Lagunita.
Currently I am in Wilbur, which is a sweat
shop for a tray. My history lets other trays
know who is the king, who is the worst, and
who is the last tray you want to be stuck
under in the student tray snatching bay.
So here I am: feathered beasts picking
the harsh functional truth of my existence
out of my pores. Finally, the warm knowing
hands of Faustino, a dining service employ
ee, pick me up and carry me inside. It is
usually at this point that I enter a line to
take a refreshing shower. The overwhelm
ing weight of all the plates, glasses and sil
verware is lifted off of my shoulders. As the
hot water beats down on my soap-enriched
skin. I release sighs of ecstasy exceeded in
pleasure only by an Herbal Essence com
mercial I once saw when brought into the
Kinconada lounge.
Yes, although I usually just get to watch
the Simpsons when brought inside, I have
also endured mindless dorm programming
— everything from "Frolicking Flutes: Did
you know that five Alondrans play the
flute?" to "Krazy about Kites: Come learn
from an expert to whom we paid $7(M) to
show us how to make kites."
Back to my personal nirvana, the show
er. 1 emerge from the shower feeling, in
Madonna's words — "shiny and new, like a
virgin touched for the very first time." This
time picked up by a dining service employ
ee who 1 do not recognize.
It must be a busy brunch, because he has
not allowed me to go through my drying
phase. While showering is my period of

euphoria, drying is my slow relaxation time
where I meditate on my own existence. I
must return to the student tray-snatching
bay soggy and exhausted.
I lay there shivering on the top of a heap
of some conceited peach-colored trays who
are grumbling about a piece of red snapper
that accidentally fell on them. "Pipe down,
peachies," 1 yell at the pansies. "Mv back
side was just covered in seagull shit."
They quiet down and contemplate the
fact that they are currently wrapped
around my backside. I hear the familiar
rolling of the tray transport rack coming my
way. Soon I will be wrapped around the
backside of a tray more offensive than
myself.
Dear (Jod, a twist of fate! Settling down
into my loving embrace is the one and only
black tray. A legend among the tray and
student community, the black tray has only
been seen by a few. It is kept away from us
most of the time because of its seductive
powers and the unique ribbed material of
which it is made. Eating on it is incredible;
laying underneath it is even more incredi
ble.
1 enjoy the moment; my normal anxiety
about being snatched up is replaced by lust.
These are the moments I live for in my
troubled lifestyle. A lifestyle that can only
be understood by a fellow Stanford dining
service trav.
