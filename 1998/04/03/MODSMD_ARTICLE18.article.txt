Low scores for traditional
fee endorsement process
The Daily is finally beginning to see the
light. The adoption of a new system for spe
cial-fee endorsements offers some hope that
all groups applying for a special fee will be
given a fair shake by the Daily powers that
be.
Yet, let us not forget this paper's long
history of arbitrary and discriminatory spe
cial-fee endorsements. While groups like
the Stanford Band, Axe Committee, ASSU
Speakers Bureau and Club Sports have con
sistently received positive recommenda
tions, ethnic and public service groups have
frequently not been so fortunate.
Searching through The Daily archives
for the past five years reveals quite clearly
that 1) the criteria hav; been inconsistently
applied across groups each year, 2) the rec
ommendations have been formulated based
on the incorrect interpretations of the edi
torial board which lacks any contextual or
conceptual knowledge of the groups, and 3)
there have been unrealistic expectations for
finding funding and other resources.
What groups have consistently not
received positive recommendations from
this supposedly wise and neutral editorial
board? The Asian American Students

Association, the Black Student Union,
MEChA, Barrio Assistance and the Stan
ford Homelessness Action Coalition
(SHAC). While this raises some eyebrows
in and of itself. Project Motivation received
a NO recommendation in 1996 despite hav
ing received very strong YES recommenda
tions the three previous years and decreas
ing their previous year's budget by nearly
$500.
Equally aggravating is the general bias
towards public service groups. While The
Daily enthusiastically supports the Stanford
Band's special fee (around $60,(XX)) because
"it is a valuable group that should be paid
for by students," the Stanford Project on
Nutrition, (SPOON, with a fee request of
around $5,000) which feeds countless num
bers of hungry people, has been criticized
for not having twist ties and labels donated.
The Chapparal was critiqued by The Daily
in 1995 and 1996 for "not always befing]
very funny" but was given a YES recom
mendation because "it is an institution
almost as old as the University itself."
SHAC, fighting for the rights of pwr and
homeless people, was given a NO recom
mendation because "their budget cannot be
considered worthwhile enough for all stu
dents to support."
Additionally, last year found The Daily
criticizing the proposed public service

minor because "it does not seem appropri
ate to create a program granting students a
minor for merely volunteering in the com
munity." Such comments rival The Stanford
Review for shallowness.
Finally, while The Daily's creation of
new evaluation criteria is an acknowledg
ment of the old system's ridiculousness, last
Tuesday's editorial arrogantly notes "the
board will make recommendations on all
groups whether or not the group chooses to
meet with us," in effect forcing groups to
meet with The Daily or make the risk even
greater of falling prey to their traditionally
limited way of thinking.
Given such bullying tactics, I have no
reason to believe that this paper's editorial
board has the ability to rate student groups
objectively. Historically, I'd give The
Daily's editorial board a 0 on both counts.

Solutions for gracl housing
Stanford charges too little for its on-cam
pus graduate housing. The cost of living on
campus hasn't kept pace with the cost of liv
ing off campus, and this has caused on-cam
pus housing demand to far exceed supply.
Now we have a situation of uncertainty, in
which students do not know, year to year,

whether they will have access to low-cost
housing. This can wreak havoc on a stu
dent's finances and ability to plan. It
amounts to subsidized housing for some,
but not all, of Stanford's graduate students.
Instead of drastically reducing admis
sions to reduce housing demand, I think the
University has other options. These solu
tions deal directly with the housing prob
lem, and strive to bring supply and demand
of on-campus housing closer together.
Option 1: Stanford can supply more
housing, by building or by procuring off
campus housing. This idea seems to be pop
ular with students, though not so popular
with Stanford. This is understandable, as it
costs Stanford money and possibly land. If
the housing boom cools off, Stanford does
not want to be left with extra housing.
Option 2: Stanford can raise the rent,
which would decrease demand for on-cam
pus housing. If the pain of housing costs are
spread more evenly, graduate stipends are
likely to rise. If all graduate students are
affected by high housing costs, there is a
stronger initiative to bring graduate student
wages in line with the cost of living.
Option 3: Stanford can issue an
adjustable housing credit to students denied
on-campus housing. This credit could be
applied to rent offcampus. If the housing
boom cools off and rents decrease, so can

the housing credit. A housing credit would
decrease demand for on-campus housing,
relieving some of the pressure from the
Draw. Then people who want to live off
campus can do so without severe financial
hardship. Stanford retains its flexibility,
maintains its public image, and students get
more equal treatment.
I'm concerned because many of my
friends are extra-stressed lately due to the
impending housing lottery. This random
ness can be difficult to deal with. The Draw
would be much more benign if the supply of
housing more adequately met the demand.
The housing shortage is a problem Stan
ford should address more forcefully if it is to
remain a top graduate school. Higher
stipends and lower costs at lesser institu
tions are making them more palatable to
good students. When prospective students
ask us about housing at Stanford, we gradu
ate students have to be honest.
