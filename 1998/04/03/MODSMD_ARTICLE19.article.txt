## Life 101: Melting the ice in hungry eyes

J II slow, thick voice cxhaust-
J— * cd of emotion repeats the
insistent request for my hall-eaten ice
cream cone as I and two friends exit a mall
in San Salvador. A hand grabs my arm. I
turn around to see the hardened gaze of a
7-year-old girl clutching a dirty, ripped
McDonald's bag. '7, Da me helado?" she
repeats. The question mark is rhetorical.
One friend tries to rescue me, in my
naivete, from the situation. "No. mi amor."
he says, "otro dia." She ignores him. know
ing as well as we do that "another day" will
not feed her this afternoon. We all know
that the ice cream in my hand is now or
never. 1 search the eyes for a softening of
the ice. It does not come.
With rocks in my stomach, I look at my
friend, and ask if he would be offended if I
gave her the ice cream he'd just bought for
me. It is my choice, lie said, and so I gave it
to her, still wandering in the coldness of her
eyes. Hers is the fixed gaze belonging to
millions of children throughout El Sal
vador. England. Egypt, Mali. Mississippi.

Mountain View. Even ice cream is too bit
ter to swallow when watched by such eyes.
Both of my friends look sorrowful
ly at the little figure as she retreats down
the avenue. There are so many they
explain. ()ne cannot give to all. "Wait until
we take you to the mercado central." they
tell me. "There are a million hungry chil
dren." As if the point needs to be driven
even deeper, in the space of two crumbling
sidewalk panels we have already met two
hollow-cheeked little boys with boxes of
bright-colored Chiclets for sale. They are
not successful. I have a boulder in my
throat. Sickness. Frustration. Urgency.
Frothing, boiling anger.
( hances are that those children endeav
ored to survive the last treacherous six
months. They are probably still on that
street corner begging half-eaten ice cream
cones from the half-real half-humans
strolling by. Hut more than three million
other children under the age of 5 have died
from malnutrition in these same months.
Where have I been? What have I done to
prevent three million deaths? What have I

done to validate the promise of "otro dia?"
Since my high school graduation, I have
justified my progression down the luxuri
ous. mainstream path of academia. I have
allowed mysell to assume that knowledge
is the most valuable tool in the eradication
of social injustice.
And so. every year. $3().(MH) has been
pumped into this sunny university in
exchange for 45 to 60 academic units of
History CIV, soccer and creative writing.
$3().(>(M) has not paid for penicillin or clean
water or surgery or primary schools.
$3().(KM) has not purchased 45.(XX) ice cream
cones,
A few hundred children's lives can be
saved for every 45 academic units of eco
nomies. water polo, sociology. Hut I tell
myself that such redirection of funds would
be a short-term solution, a drop in the
bucket, and I continue instead to invest in
myself as human capital. Always there is
the justification — the reconciliation
that my education will be beneficial to
more children than could ever by saved
with the $ 120,(KM) these four vears are cost

ing. I don't even bother to multiply by
6.550, Stanford's current undergraduate
population.
What I find dillicult to reconcile espe
cially as the social sciences increasingly val
idate themselves with the quantification ol
reality is my sense of an internal vacu
um. Something is missing inside me as I
float through this warm, red stucco won
derland. When I learn about comparative
advantage, it is missing, but it is also miss
ing when I learn about political gerryman
dering and the atomic bomb. It is also miss
ing when 1 learn about Marx, the Stanford
Prison Experiment and social security poli
cy.
What is missing here? I am not angry.
My throat does not tighten with sobs. m\
lists do not clench with rage, and my head
does not ache with emotional concussion.
My stomach does not till with rocks.
Stanford University does not breed
anger; it assuages it. My education is not
molding me into an agent for social change.
It is permitting me to become an apologist
for social stagnation. Here, in a world con

strutted of palm trees and daffodils, there is
no accountability. There are no little girls
with messy hair and stony eyes clutching
our arms and pleading for ice cream at a
Kappa Sigma party, none in Econ 51, and
none sitting in Wilbur Dining complaining
about the food.
And so a new reality is created in which
hunger is a dieting trick and ragged clothing
is a conscious choice made by co-op resi
dents. Everyone cares about hungry chil
dren. and there are few who would refuse a
little girl the end of an ice cream cone. Yet,
"feed the world" has not become a mission
statement, but a cynical cliche describing
holier-than-thou liberalism. For 107 years,
Stanford students and faculty have
researched ways of melting the ice in hun
gry children's eyes. We have failed.
We forgive, we forget, we smile, we hug.
"No. mi amor, otro di'a." Without the
warmth of compassion and the heat of
anger, we will never melt frozen tears.
