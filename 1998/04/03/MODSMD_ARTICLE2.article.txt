Across the country today, I.S44
high school seniors opened their
mailboxes to find the famous folder.
They got in.
Of a record IK.KXK total appli
cants, Stanford offered spots in the
("lass of 2(X)2 to a total of 2.455 stu
dents, including 611 accepted previ
ously through the Early Decision
program.
The admission rate of 13 percent
is the lowest in Stanford history, said
Dean of Admissions and Financial
Aid Robert Kinnally. Applications
increased by 12 percent, also a
record, and the highest increase of
any comparable institution in the
country. I he jump in applications,
combined with a higher assumed
yield rate based on last year's results,
produced the record low rate of ac
ceptance. he said.
Last year. Stanford accepted

2.604 students for a 15.5 percent
admit rate, and experienced a
percent jump in applications.
Kinnally cited the University's
recent high profile in the national
press when explaining the admis
sions numbers.
"Wc have students thinking
about us who wouldn't have normal
ly." he said, noting increases in ap
plications and admissions from New
Jersey. Pennsylvania, the South and
the Midwest.
"Wc have an amazing place, and
more people are learning that." Kin
nally said. "I wonder what the Final
Four is going to do to our yield."
Kinnally characterized the in
coming class as unusually filled with
"self-starters." For example, a sig
nificant number engaged in fairly so
phisticated research in high school,
he said. C ommunity service was also
popular among applicants.
