That's not a professor holding of
fice hours today in White Plaza. It's
Assemblyman led Lempert, who
thinks t he Stanford campus is a good
place to hear from his constituents.
Lempert (D-Palo Alto) will he at
a table this afternoon from noon Id
1:3() p.m. A Class of'% Law School
graduate, Lempert currently repre
sents about 4(X).(XX) people in Palo
Alto and 14 neighboring communi
ties.
Office hours give people the
chance to bring up concerns that
they might not otherwise express to
their representative, said Lempert's
field representative, Erin Koch.
"People are always welcome to

walk into our district office on El
('amino Real, but at office hours, it's
a lot easier for people to walk by and
say what's on their mind," Lempert
said.
Stanford students may want to
voice their feelings about anything
from traffic concerns to problems
with the I)MV to the cost of higher
education, Koch said.
Lempert said that he has a partic
ular interest in ensuring that stu
dents are involved in the democratic
process. He noted that the age
group of 18- to 22-year-olds has the
smallest percentage of voters, and
he hopes to hear from some of this
group today.
In previous sessions. Lempert had
used some of the suggestions from his
office hours in drafting legislation.

"One person's comment could lead
directly to a new piece of legislation
being introduced." he said.
"For staff members, it's one of
the best things that we do because
it's a direct democracy," Koch said.
Lempert and his staff have al
ready spoken with people at various
locations in Palo Alto. Belmont and
Redwood City. This will be his first
session of office hours at Stanford.
"We'll probably be doing it a few
more times after this."
Lempert, who served as County
Supervisor from 1992 to 19%, has
been involved in violence preven
tion campaigns and education re
form. 1 le began his post in 19% and
will run for re-election in Novem
ber. Today's event is not campaign
related. said Koch.
