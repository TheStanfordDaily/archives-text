This is it.
This is the moment Mark Cook
and the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team have been waiting fort lie
entire season — the NCAA region
als tomorrow at the University of
Washington.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Saturday: NCAA reeionals at Washington's Hec Eidmundson Pavilion

Also participating in the meet
will be all the teams from the Pacif
ic-l() Conference, Boise State and
UC-Davis. Stanford won the Pac-1()
on March 21, which bodes well for
tomorrow, but both Oregon State
and Washington were right on the
Card's heels.
Defending national champion
UCLA has some outstanding indi
vidual performers, like Pac-lOGym
nast of the Year Stella I Jmeh, but
the squad couldn't get it together as
a team.
Stanford must finish first in the
competition to be guaranteed a spot
at the national meet 011 April 16th,
but seven wild-card bids are given to
the teams with the highest score na
tionally.
In the past, the top two teams
from the West region usually end up
going, but it fluctuates from year to
year.
After waiting all season. Stan
ford is definitely ready lor the chal

"We got to rest last week," Cook
said. "We're in a training cycle

which we're going to pick back up
intensity-wise. We're totally ready."
The squad's recent win at Pac-l()s
was a team effort and no individuals
stole the show. Cook is expecting a
repeat effort from his entire team
and will be conservative on difficul
ty level and concentrate instead on
execution.
Stanford will put the same lineup

on the apparatuses as it did two
weeks ago while winning the Pac
l()s. The squad is nursing a few
minor injuries, but it is the healthiest
it has been all year.
"We're into a groove |with the
Pac-10 lineup]," Cook said. "I'm
looking for the same effort from
Pac-l()s minus a few errors we had
011 the floor exercise."
Senior co-captain Keri Monahan
will compete on all events except the
bars and is expected to contribute
major points. Monahan has been a
force all season, grabbing numerous
first- and second-place finishes in
conference meets.
"No one is looking to show off,"
Monahan said. "Since the scoring is
so close, the team that wins will be
the team with the cleanest execution
— not the hardest tricks."
Junior co-captain Amy Muraka
mi will compete in the Ail-Around.
Murakami has also guided the team
in points and leadership and will have
to step up tomorrow in order for the
