— South Central.

The No. 1 Stanford Cardinal (25-4-1,10-2 Pacif
ic 10 Conference, Southern Division) travels to the
USC this weekend for a three-game series with the
N0.2 Trojans (27-5,13-2) beginning tonight.
"The Trojans are real good, hut that's no sur
prise," said Stanford head coach Mark Marquess.
"I think they are solid. They play well every
where."
Tonight's matchup could he one of the greatest
of the season, with two of the nation's best pitchers
opening the series at 7 p.m. on USC's Dedeaux
Field. Undefeated C ardinal Jeff Austin (8-0) and
USC star Seth Etherton (K-0) are both accustomed
to giving their respective teams a win in the first
game of the series.
Etherton, a senior, turned down a contract offer
from the St. Louis Cardinals after last season in
order to return to the Trojans. Named to the 1998
Collegiate Baseball preseason Ail-American first
team, Etherton is already having a tremendous
year.
'I put Etherton in the same category as a Kyle
Peterson," said Marquess, comparing the Trojan
star to Stanford's ace last year, who was drafted by
the Milwaukee Brewers. "When Etherton didn't
sign (a major league contract after his junior year),
he brought them from a good team to a great
team."

USC's offense is led by sophomore catcher Eric
Munson. who leads the team with his 11 homeruns.
and senior Morgan Ensherg. who has nine home
runs and a team-leading .383 hatting average.
With three gixxl starting pitchers, as well as one
of the nations top relievers in senior Jack Krawczyk.
the Trojans hope to silence Stanford's offense.

"It's good that we arc kind of getting back in the
swing of things, (but)! don't think we are swinging
the bat as well as before the break." Marquess said,

the Cardinal made three errors early
in the game. Marquess is concerned
about his team's defensive play as
well.
"That concerns me more than
anything else." he said. "We can't
beat good teams unless we play con
sistent defense."
Facing a team as strong as the
Trojans. Stanford will be forced to do
everything right and show why the
Cardinal has remained atop the na
tion's polls all season long.
"We're not a young team," Mar
quess said of his players. "They know
what they have to do. You can't play
like we did Monday and expect to
beat the Trojans."
