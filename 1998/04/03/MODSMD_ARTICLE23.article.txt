# Hinch thrilled to be in big leagues
## Former Stanford star earns starting role for A's

OAKLAND — Crowds of reporters en
gulfed the lockers in the Oakland Athletics*
clubhouse Wednesday night. After all the lire
works, balloons and music were finished and
gone. Oakland had lost its opening night game
to the Boston Red Sox and an uncomfortable
silence had settled in the room. Some players
tried to eat their dinner. Others changed into
street clothes and attempted to leave in a
hurry, while a few veterans seemed to stare off
into space, knowing the wear and tear of the
start of yet another season.
One player, however, did not fit into the
subdued setting. With a face beaming brighter
than the lights of the television cameras aimed
at him, rookie catcher A.J. Ilinch would not let
his historic day be ruined.
"Sure I could have written the script a little
easier." said the former Stanford star of his
major league debut. "But I'll tell you what . .
I've got something to build from. It won't get
any tougher than this."
Catching knucklcballer and veteran pitcher
Tom Candiotti and going O-for-3 at the plate
against Boston's Pedro Martinez may not have
been the easiest of nights for the young Mar.
but it didn't take the stars out of his young eyes
this night.
"It's not the easiest job in the game, but it is
a fun one. I'll take being here rather than being
back home, any day," Hinch said. "My adren
aline was pumping. W hen they were doing the
introductions, it kicked in that this was real.
I'm loving life, l'his in what I've dreamed
about."
Hinch didn't have to dream for long. It was
only a couple years ago that Stanford's pride
and joy turned down a baseball contract after
his junior year the year in which most colle
giate baseball players sign 111 order to play in
the ()lympics and return to Stanford for his se
nior year.
"It was a giH)d decision." he said with a
laugh.
While many felt that Hinch was ruining his
road to the big leagues, the catcher made it
through the minors in less than a year, a place
where many players spend a lifetime. Moving
up from A to the AAA league midway

Former Stanf rd star A.J. Hinch, making his professional debut as catcher for the Oak
land A s, shal cs hands with Cardinal sophomore basketball star Mark Madsen. Madsen
threw the inaugural pitch to Hinch before Wednesday's game.
through the season, Hinch was a lit
tle taken back.
"At first I was just filling in for
some hurt guys. Then all of a sud
den, I had a starting role," Hinch
said. "Hv September, I was up here
with these guys, learning how they
play. It was a thrill. I got to have
everything about the big leagues
without the pressure."
Invited to compete for the start
ing position this season at spring
training, Hinch earned the opening
day catching job. Now, he is forced
to realize that he is on the same
level as many of his lifetime heroes.
"You can't be in awe of these
guys if you are going to be their
teammates," said the catcher
whose locker is next to that of fu
ture Hall of Famer Rickey Hender
son.
"That's the toughest thing be

cause you are going to go out and
face Pedro Martinez, Randy John
son, and all these guys you've read
about and really idolized. You can't
(play at their level) by being in awe
of the situation."
Even with the 40-year-old Can
diotti on the mound, Hinch had no
hesitations in performing his catch
er's role of counseling the pitcher.
Despite the fact that Candiotti was
in the minors and working toward
the majors when Hinch was only in
diapers, he claims the age differ
ence matters little in the game of
baseball.
"The fundamentals stay the
same for them (the veterans) as for
the younger guys. The game is the
same whether played at Stanford,
A ball, AAA, or in the majors."
Opening day has passed and
Hinch has survived. Perhaps he was
even less nervous than Stanford
basketball star Mark Madsen, who
threw out the honorary first pitch to
Hinch. making the dav even more

special for the alumnus.
"I just hope I can hit his glove."
said Madsen with a nervous chuck
le before the game.
Hinch was loving it.
"I've talked enough trash to
make everybody hate Stanford
here," Hinch said. "It was a fun run
for everybody, and I was glad a
Stanford guy got to throw out the
first pitch."
With his first-game jitters out of
the way, Hinch has only one more
thing to worry about — pranks
played on the rookies.
"They'll pull some pranks. I've
heard some good ones the last cou
ple years. (But) I'll adjust to it and
love it,"he said in his optimistic
tone. "I just don't want to wear a
dress. They may take my clothes
and make me wear something out
rageous."
Until then. Hinch will continue
wearing something he's incredibly
proud of.
An Oakland A's uniform.
