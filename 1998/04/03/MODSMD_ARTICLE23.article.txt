# Hinch thrilled to be in big leagues
## Former Stanford star earns starting role for A's

OAKLAND â€” Crowds of reporters en
gulfed the lockers in the Oakland Athletics*
clubhouse Wednesday night. After all the lire
works, balloons and music were finished and
gone. Oakland had lost its opening night game
to the Boston Red Sox and an uncomfortable
silence had settled in the room. Some players
tried to eat their dinner. Others changed into
street clothes and attempted to leave in a
hurry, while a few veterans seemed to stare off
into space, knowing the wear and tear of the
start of yet another season.
One player, however, did not fit into the
subdued setting. With a face beaming brighter
than the lights of the television cameras aimed
at him, rookie catcher A.J. Ilinch would not let
his historic day be ruined.
"Sure I could have written the script a little
easier." said the former Stanford star of his
major league debut. "But I'll tell you what . .
I've got something to build from. It won't get
any tougher than this."
Catching knucklcballer and veteran pitcher
Tom Candiotti and going O-for-3 at the plate
against Boston's Pedro Martinez may not have
been the easiest of nights for the young Mar.
but it didn't take the stars out of his young eyes
this night.
"It's not the easiest job in the game, but it is
a fun one. I'll take being here rather than being
back home, any day," Hinch said. "My adren
aline was pumping. W hen they were doing the
introductions, it kicked in that this was real.
I'm loving life, l'his in what I've dreamed
about."
Hinch didn't have to dream for long. It was
only a couple years ago that Stanford's pride
and joy turned down a baseball contract after
his junior year the year in which most colle
giate baseball players sign 111 order to play in
the ()lympics and return to Stanford for his se
nior year.
"It was a giH)d decision." he said with a
laugh.
While many felt that Hinch was ruining his
road to the big leagues, the catcher made it
through the minors in less than a year, a place
where many players spend a lifetime. Moving
up from A to the AAA league midway
