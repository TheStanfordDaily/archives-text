MEN'STENNIS
■ Today: No. 1 Stanford (16-0. 5-() Pacific 10 Conference) \s No S I CI \
(12-3.5-1) at Taube Family Tennis Stadium, noon
■ Saturday: Stanford \s No I SC (13-3. 4-2) at I aube I amily I enni> sta
dium. 1:30 P.m.

At 16-0 this season and 5-0 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, Stanford has
looked untouchable, but the Mruins
and Trojans, ranked at No. S and

No. respectively. will pose a chal
lenge to the Card.
Head coach Dick Gould said this
weekend s matches will be tough for
Stanford, but that the victories oxer
ihe break gave the team "good mo
mentum going into this weekend."
Stanford is the onl\ remaining
undefeated team in the top KKI

teams in the country. having defeat
ed the nation's best, including No. 2
Georgia and No. 4 Illinois.
USC (13-3, 4-2. Pac-10) and
UCLA (12-3,5-1, Pac-10) were both
ranked higher in the polls earlier this
year — IJS(' at No. 6, and UCLA at
No. 2 at one point — hut they split
matches earlier this year, which hurt
their standings. They are "two hig
contenders for the NCAAs," Gould
said.
All three of these Pac-10 teams
have had formidable records in the
past and are some of the toughest
teams in the nation. USC, UCLA
and Stanford have earned 15
NCAA titles and have captured all
but two NCAA championships
since 1973.
Last year, the Bruins tied with
Stanford as Pac-10 champions and
were the only Pac-10 team the Card
lost to all season. Although their
records are not perfect, both the
Bruins and the Trojans pose a threat
to Stanford's stellar match record
and its 27-match win streak.
UCLA's lineup features junior
Vince Allegre. fourth-ranked in the
country, and freshman Jean-Noel
Grinda and senior Matt Breen. USC
is led by senior George Bastl. the na
tion's 23-ranked player.
Stanford sophomores Mike and
Bob Bryan are ranked at 10th and
11 th in the country, respectively, and
are No. 6 as a doubles team. The
doubles pair of junior Ryan Wolters
and senior Paul Goldstein is ranked
at No. 8. and are ranked 39th and
41st, respectively, in singles.
Stanford's match record and indi
vidual player rankings have only
been improving. All six of the Card's
starting singles players are ranked in
the Top 75 in the nation, and two of
its doubles teams in the Top 10. In
addition, the Cardinal has lost only
one singles match out of 90 in dual
match competition this year.
Gould said he thinks USC and
UCLA will be tough competitors,
but Stanford's talented squad will be
able to pull through.

"This is one of the most outstand
ing winter sessions we have ever
had." Gould said. "These guys are
really to he commended on it. Thev

have achieved things no other team
at this time has ever achieved. To
this point, this team has really been
amazing."
