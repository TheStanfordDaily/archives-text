"We will face two very tough
teams this weekend." said Stanford
head coach John Ritttnan. "In order
to win this weekend, we are going to
have to step it up and hit the ball
well "
Dunnn spring break, the Card put

together eight victories, but lost two
to the No. 3 Washington Huskies, 2
1 and 3-0.
"If we don't play well this week
end. we could come home with no
wins." Rittman said.
The Ducks are a solid all-around
team, hut their strength lies primarily
in their hitting. They are led by fresh
man Triawn Custer, who was named
Pac-10 Player of the Week last week
for her efforts at the plate. She hit
.714 with 16 RBIs for the week, high
lighted by a grand slam against the
No. 1 team in the nation, the Arizona
Wildcats.
Five Ducks are averaging at least
a hit per th ree at - bats. J un ior J en n i fer
Cook is the team's leading pitcher
with a 15-9 record and 2.04 ERA and

68 strikeouts.
Like Stanford, the Dueks are on a
rampage as of late, winning six of
their last eight games.
The Ducks' impressive offensive
firepower will put the Card's pitching
to the test. Junior Marcy Crouch has
been consistently strong for the Card
and junior Becky Blevins has been
phenomenal recently. Against Har
vard over break. Blevins struck out
six Crimson players en route to her
second career no-hitter. For her per
formance last week. Blevins was
named Pac-I() Pitcher of the Week.
"Becky is throwing really well
right now." Crouch said. "Her speed
and spin have been working for her,
and her location is near perfect."

Like Oregon, the OSU Beavers'
strength is their hitting; they also had
their worst showing of the season
against the Wildeats and split games
with the Sun Devils as well.
The Beavers are led by sopho
more Ail-American pitcher Tarrah
Beyster, who has seven shutouts for
(he season. Stanford will have to
tame the 5-11 power pitcher if it
wants to smell victory against the
Beavers.
"We expect the level of play to be
a little higher now that it is Pac-10
time," said junior Kelly Yablonski.
"Though we have a lot of momentum
from spring break, we'll have to step
it up this weekend and rely on solid
pitching and defense."
