■ Yesterday's result: Stanford 3, USC 1

■ Today: Stanford (15-3,7-1 MPSF) faces UC-Davis, San
Jose State and Hawaii in the Hawaii Classic, all day.
The Stanford defense was lead by junior goalkeeper
Heather Crarv. who tallied 10 saves for the Cardinal.
Stanford kept the Trojans from scoring until the last five
minutes of the game, when USC's freshman 2-meter play
er Jennifer Durley put a shot away.
The Trojans also had a strong defensive game. After
the first quarter, USC junior goalie Bernice Orwig was
able to shut out the Cardinal offense.
Immediately after the match, the Stanford squad
caught a plane headed for the University of Hawaii to plav
in the Hawaii Classic. There, Stanford will face UC-Davis,
San Jose State and Hawaii.
Stanford last faced Davis at the LJC-Santa Barbara

tournament earlier this season, where the C ard won 9-1
and took third place overall, behind California and
UCLA. The team also defeated San Jose State 11-0 last
Saturday, a game in which 10 different players scored for
the Cardinal, demonstrating the impressive depth of Stan
ford's squad.
The biggest threat for the Card will be I lawaii, who is
currently ranked fourth nationally.
"They're a very balanced team," said head coach John
Tanner. "They're solid in every position and they have
good 2-meter play, good 2-meter defense and good dri
ves."
Hawaii has been fairly consistent throughout the sea
son. giving the top teams a run for their money. The talent
of some of the Canadian national team members has also
added to Hawaii's overall strength.
"They only lost to [No. 3] Cal by one," said junior cap
tain Lindsay Tam. whose home is on the island of Oahu.
"They have on and off days, but they have some girls from
the Canadian national team that are very strong players."
Hawaii will also have the home-pool advantage over
the Card, which has been an important factor in Hawaii's
play this season.
"They're much better at home than on the road," Tan
ner said. "They've been pretty consistent against every
one. It should be a pretty even game."
The Card plays Davis today, San Jose tomorrow, and
Hawaii on Sunday. After the tournament, Stanford will
really shift into postseason gear in preparation for quali
fiers and nationals.
Stanford returns to deGuerre pool for the national
qualifiers, which will be held on April 24-26.
