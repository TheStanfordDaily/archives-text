# Sun Devil Invite up next for golf
## Women look to get on track for Pac-10s 
### Will Flemming Contributing writer 
Throughout the winter months,
the Stanford women's golf team has
cited El Nino and limited practice
time as explanations for its inconsis
tent play. And considering the un
usually rainy conditions around the
Farm, these excuses have seemed
quite legitimate.
However, with postseason plav
quickly approaching, in the form of
the Pacific 10 Conference and
NCAA Championships, the Cardi
nal needs to put the soggy months of
February and March behind it and
elevate its play.
There would be no better place
for Stanford to find its form than at
the Sun Devil Invitational in Tempe,
Ariz, this weekend.
"The Arizona tournament is the

last big event before all the postsea
son tournaments," said freshman
Lauren Robertson following the
team's disappointing seventh-plaee
finish at the San Jose State Spartan
Invitational.

Invitational.

"We really need to put together
some low scores and prove to our
selves that we are tournament
ready."
The three-day event should be a
serious test for the Cardinal, consid
ering the presence of two talented
Pac-10 opponents — host Sun Dev
ils and their interstate rival. Univer
sity of Arizona — in the tournament
field. The Wildcats finished first at

the Spartan Invitational just three
weeks ago.
All season long, Stanford has
posted a number of impressive indi
vidual performances by many team
members. I n order to achieve success
in Tempo and throughout the re
mainder of the season, the Cardinal
needs to perform well as a whole unit.
"It has been hard for us to post a
complete team effort due to the re
cent weather and lack of practice,"
said junior Michelle Sperry. "But we
have shown that we have individual
talent all year lone: and if we can
play well at the same time, we will be
hard to beat."
Stanford desperately needs to
post a solid team effort in the near
future. The rain-soaked Cardinal is
searching for a springboard to future
success, and the hot sun of the Ari
zona desert should do the trick.
