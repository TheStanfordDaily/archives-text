### Michaela Crouch Contributing writer 
After an upset victory Wednesday night over No. 4
Brigham Young, the sixth-ranked Stanford men's vol
leyhall team will play two matches this weekend that
could impact the ( ardinal's postseason play.
The Cardinal (13-h, 12-5 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) faces off against seventh-ranked Long
Beach State (16-6,8-6 MPSF) tonight and 13th-ranked
USC (9-12, 5-9 MPSF) tomorrow. Both are 7 p.m.
matches in Burnham Pavilion.

and played both schools in late February. The Cardinal
defeated LBSU in a five-game thriller but lost to the
then-unranked Trojans in five games after winning two
of the first three games.
A victory for the Cardinal tonight is important in
order to be in the best possible position going into the
playoffs. A Stanford defeat of the 49ers would ensure a
Cardinal homecourt advantage in the first round of the
MPSF playoffs.
Stanford's only hope to win the Pacific Division is a
long shot — there would have to be Hawaii losses in
three of its final four matches, in addition to Cardinal
victories in all of its final three matches.
Tonight's match promises to be a very different one
that the 49er-Cardinal matchup in February. LBSU has
been a hot team lately, with an impressive defeat of Pep
perdine that dethroned the Waves from their top na
tional ranking.
One thing essential to a Cardinal win tonight is the
shutdown of senior All-American middle blocker Gaby
Amar. the 49ers' top hitter.

■ Tonight: No. 6 Stanford (13-6, 12-5 MPSF) vs. No. 7
Long Beach State (16-6, 8-6) at Burnham Pavilion, 7
p.m.
■ Saturday: No. 6 Stanford vs. No. 13 USC (9-12,5-9) at
Burnham Pavilion, 7 p.m.
"Amar is a key guy for them," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "When he struggles, they are a
different team."
In their previous victory this season, the Cardinal ef
fectively shut down Amar. holding him to just 19 kills
and a .333 hitting percentage (19-5-42). Stanford also
stopped the entire Long Beach State offensive attack.
In tomorrow's match, Stanford will face another
young team in I JSC. The Trojan 15-member lineup in
cludes eight freshmen. The Cardinal looks to avenge its
earlier unexpected loss to the Trojans tomorrow. In that
loss, Stanford posted its lowest team hitting percentage
of the season, .235 (100-50-213).
"It was a bitter loss for us." Nieves said, "so it will be
an interesting rematch."
Stanford also fell victim to USC in North Gym last
season, when the Trojans upset the then-No. 1 Cardinal
3-1.
In this season's match, two Trojan returning starters
as well as a top freshman recruit effectively shut down
the Cardinal attack and went on their own offensive.
Senior middle blocker Szilard Kovacs recorded 30
kills. His eight blocks also worked to slow the attack of
senior middle blockers Tad Hoffman and Keenan
Whitehurst.
Sophomore setter Donald Suxho. a former starter
on the Albanian national team, recorded his season
high 91 assists in that match. He also slowed the attack
of Cardinal outside hitters with a match-high 14 digs.
To stop the Trojan attack, Stanford will also need to
stop freshman outside hitter Trevor Julian, who record
ed a career-high 22 kills in the match.
While the Long Beach match is slightly more signif
icant because of standings and postseason implications,
victories in both matches are critical for the Cardinal.
"We badlv need to plav better as much as we need to
pick up wins." said Nieves. "We need to get momentum
going into the postseason."
