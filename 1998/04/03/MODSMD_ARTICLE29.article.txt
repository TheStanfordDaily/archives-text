# Oliver departs for Idaho St.

### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Doug Oliver, longtime Stanford
men's basketball assistant coach,
will leave the Farm to become head
coach at Idaho State, the school an
nounced March 16.
Oliver has coached at Stanford
since head coach Mike Montgomery
took over in 1986 and has seen Stan
ford's program rise to a pinnacle Pa
cific 10 conference team and its first
Final Four appearance since 1942.
"There's some anxiety leaving,"
Oliver said. "What Stanford offers
to the student athletes is something
special."
However, Oliver said he is look
ing forward to running his own pro
gram in Pocatello, a city in which
Idaho State athletics could easily be
come the prime sports ticket.
"Once you get into this business,

you understand that if you have the
opportunity to run your own pro
gram. you take it,"he said.
Oliver interviewed for the posi
tion during the basketball season
and missed a Cardinal practice to fly
to Pocatello. The announcement
was made one day after the Cardinal
defeated Western Michigan to ad
vance to the Sweet 16 round of the
NCAA Tournament.
However, Oliver said the timing
of the announcement would have no
effect on the team — other than
lumping Oliver into the same cate
gory as seniors Kamba Tshionyi and
Pete Van Elswyk.
"I'm really scared to death to
jump out into my own world," he
said. "But I feel prepared."
Oliver's best moments coaching
the Cardinal came during the 1988-
89 season, which he said gave the
Stanford program recognition, and

this year's Final Four — a highlight
for any coach.
The only nadir of his Stanford ca
reer, Oliver said, was when he re
ceived a technical foul during last
year's Sweet 16 matchup against
Utah for arguing with the officials
just as Stanford was staging a come
back against the Utes.
"That devastated and scarred me
more than most people realize," he
said. "When you're in our circle, you
live with your actions."
As he begins to look ahead to
Idaho State, Oliver said there is a
good probability that Idaho State
basketball will bear very few resem
blances to Stanford basketball.
" The success we've had here at
Stanford fit Stanford," he said. "I
know that. I'm going to do things dif
ferently at Idaho State. The person
nel will be different. We have to ad
just."
