## Inside the box The 						homed problem ends today 
### 
Anthony Eggles

Palo Alto faces the gravest
problem in its history. They are
constantly overfoot, they are
wasteful, they are everywhere.
They are homed people.
I m a cranky old homeless per
son. I'm just sick of the homed
people who are ruining our beauti
ful neighborhood. Sure, they might
have lived here for awhile, but can
you bear to look at them? There
they are, in their homes, watching
their televisions, with their Lexus
es in the driveway, luxuriating in
opulent splendor.
It is just gross!
Frankly, it makes the rest of us
feel quite uncomfortable. I just
don't feel right sharing the same

street space with them. I might be
sitting on the street, wrapped in my
beaten blanket, my beaten jacket,
and my beaten face, just trying to
find a place to sleep. Then, I swear
this is true, I'll see one of them go
into Hair by Tang and pay for a
haircut. Hair by Tang?
Worse yet, they go into the
Stanford Shopping Mall as if it
were a real shopping mall! The
other day, while fighting a cat for
the last bits of a burrito, I actually
saw someone go into Oilily. I saw
them look at a price tag and,
instead of running and screaming
in sheer terror, this homed person
actually said, "1 think Wimsley Jr.
would look absolutely eutesy while

playing with Ruffington 111 in this
marvy jumper, don't you?"
If I hadn't needed the calories
so badly, I tell you, I would have
vomited. But it's not just that
they're annoying, they are danger
ous! Do you realize that homed
people commit over 90 percent of
all crimes? They are also responsi
ble for over 99 percent of drunk
driving accidents.
Further, it has been conclusive
ly shown that homed people
caused the Great Depression, the
Irish potato famine, the Holocaust,
AIDS, fascism and the alienation
of labor.
Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Jack
the Ripper — they all had homes.

You know who didn't? Jesus.
These homed people, they will
he the end of us.
The Palo Alto City Council,
thankfully, has put a stop to all
this. They have written a bill that
will restore our security. From now
on, whenever a homed person is
spotted, all you need to do is fol
low your instincts: call the police.
Then the police will escort
these homed people to the bus sta
tion, purchase a ticket to the desti
nation of their choice, and forever
remove them from our dirty, dirty
hair.
It's the only humane thing to
do. We can't stand still while the
homed people walk around, with

their Wedgwood sofas, their throw
pillows and their ineredibly precise
watches. Who needs to know the
time to half a second, anyway? No
one who's up to any good, that's
for certain.
So remember to vote for
Proposition 24 — the Homed Per
sons Liquidation Act. Soon, the
homed problem will be a thing of
the past. And the Palo Alto City
Council has included a measure to
erect giant spiked city gates to
keep the homed out.
We'll all be safer this way.

Mr. Eggles newest book, "Hew to
Write that Italics Bit at the Erri of a
Column" is in stores everywhere.
