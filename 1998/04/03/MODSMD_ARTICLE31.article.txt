# Controversy over Wilfred Wu's While Plaza Watch No. 32'
## 
### 
Yesterday, the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art caused considerable contro
versy when it paid $3(X),(X)0 for Wilfred
Wu's "White Plaza Watch No. 32" (pic
tured right).
The piece uses the usual "White Plaza
Watch" format. But, where there would
normally be pictures, questions and quotes,
there are only blanks.
"This isn't what I'd call White Plaza
Watch," said one angry San Francisco resi
dent. "This looks like some editor couldn't
be bothered to fulfill his obligations and so
did some stupid piece parodying certain
trends in '60s modern art. I think it's a
waste of money. My 3-year-old child could
do better."
However, the director of SFMOMA
praised the piece. "It raises fundamental
questions as to what is and what isn't White
Plaza Watch. The viewer is invited to fill in
the blanks and in doing so, consider his/her
own role in constructing White Plaza
Watch."
Mr. Eddv, the editor of Diversions,
said. "I think this shows how much Diver
sions needs new writers. Anybody who's
interested should e-mail cthulu@leland or
mrman@leland with ideas or pieces."
