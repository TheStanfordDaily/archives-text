# Menlo Park files another Sand Hill lawsuit
## 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
A lawsuit filed by Menlo Park against Palo Alto
charges that the environmental impact of the Sand
Hill Road Corridor Projects was not adequately
studied, violating a state law that regulates such de
velopment projects.
The Stanford Management Co. and the Uni
versity have been named in the lawsuit as real par
ties in interest.
The Sand 1 lill Road Corridor Projects were ap
proved by Palo Alto voters last November, when
Measure M passed with a 55 percent majority.
The approved project involves extending Sand
Mill Road to E:l ("amino Real and widening it to

four lanes for most of its length. I 'nder the plan,
the I 'diversity also intends to build 628 apartment
units and 454 senior housing units as well ;is ex
pand the Stanford Shopping ("enter by SO.IHKt
square feet.
Stanford's expansion plans must be approved
by the Palo Alto City Council and Palo Alto vot
ers. Menlo Park residents have hail no similar
voice although they live adjacent to the construc
tion site.
The trial w ill begin April 23 in Sonoma ('ounty
If Menlo Park prevails, Palo Alto would ha\e to
amend its environmental impact report for the
Sand I lill Road project and delay the start of con
struction.
Menlo Park's lawsuit contends that the effects

of development beyond that approved by Mea
sure M were not adequately considered in the sub
mitted en\ironmental impact report, even though
the widening of Sand Hill Road elearly shows an
ticipation of further development
"The environmental impact report fails to ac
knowledge that these future Stanford develop
ments. which the roadway improvements are in
tentionally designed to accommodate, are the di
rect and foreseeable consequence of the roadway
improvements," states Me.ilo Park's opening
brief.
I hese future development projects include a
planned expansion of the Medical Center to in
elude a new cancer treatment center
and an ambulatory care center.
Because an expanded Sand Hill
Road would he necessary for people
to access any new Medical Center
complexes, such expansion "needs to
be analyzed as an impact that is re
sulting from the project," said Menlo
Park City Attorney William Mc-
Clure.
According to McClure, the sub
mitted report considers future ex
pansion as part of the cumulative im
pact of the Sand Hill development
plan rather than as a direct impact of
it. The cumulative impact of a project
anticipates the entire regional
growth that could occur whether or
not the project under consideration is
completed.

As Menlo Park argues, the Med
ical Center expansion and other fu
ture development projects could not
occur without the Sand I lill Road im
provements and thus should have
been studied more lullv in the envi
ronmental impact report. Palo Alto
and Stanford both maintain that the
submitted environmental impact re
port is complete.
"Our position is that the environ
mental impact report was adequate
and contained everything that [state
law| required it to contain," said Sue
Case, senior assistant city attorney of
Palo Alto. Five years were spent
preparing the report, she said.
"We flatly reject the position
taken by Menlo Park that (the re
port] required more extensive review
than it got." said Larry 1 iorton, Stan
ford's director of government and
community relations.
According to Horton, an applica

tion for Medical Center expansion
was submitted last December, and
Palo Alto will determine the nature
and extent of necessary environmen
tal reviews for the project.
Case pointed out that environ
mental impact reports are supposed
to survey the project under consider
ation, not future projects. Menlo
Park is "essentially asking us to in
clude in this environmental impact
report future projects that weren't
before the (City] Council at the time
and may or may not come before the
Council," she said.
She also said that potential Med
ical Center expansion was consid
ered in the report when the cumula
tive impact of all possible develop
ment was investigated. Medical Cen
ter expansion was not individually
studied because Stanford had yet to
submit an application for such expan
sion.
