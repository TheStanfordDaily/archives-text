# Hair-raising interviews in the 'real world'
## 
### Jennifer Godwin Contributing writer 
Being nestled in the academic
comfort of Stanford protects many
from the troubles of the notorious
and mythic "real world." However,
there comes a time when the en
chantment ends and students must
venture out into a forest of job in

terviews. prospective employers
and chaos.
Sometimes the path through the
forest is clear. Other times, there
are hobgoblins that pose a barrier to
the occupational success students
expect to achieve upon graduation.
The job interview hobgoblins
are particularly fascinating. He
cause job interviews involve people.

not to mention their foibles, expect
to be surprised. I lie most common
word that comes up about a unusii
al job interview is "stunned. - ' as the
interview takes ;in unexpected ;tnd
sometimes unwelcome turn.
Hob I husk, director of the < .1
reer Placement and Planning ( en
ter said. It's important to prepare,
but students can be tripped up No

matter mm well \ou prepare tor the
interview, there is always some
thing th.it's going to he ;i surprise."
Sham Strnod. Class of '85, en
eountered an interview where the
"top tcchnieal person" .it a eompa
ny gave her "a quasi IQ test, akin to
;i set of /en koans
"1 was so stunned and self-con
scious, that I didn't perform too
well," Strnod said. "In one case, he
gave me a piece of blank paper and
asked me to create some perfect
three-dimensional geometric figure
simply by folding! I couldn't do it,
and so he impressed me by doing it
himself."
According to Strnod, the inter
viewer also asked questions such as.
"Why are manhole covers round?"
and "Why is the sky blue?" Strnod
later learned from his girlfriend that
manhole covers are round because,
she said, if "they were rectangular
or square, the covers could be rotat
ed 45 degrees, and turned up on
edge, where they could fall through
the rectangular / square hole — re
member the Pythagorean theo
rem?"
Barring any demands to repli
cate the proof for Fermat's Last
Theorem or to perform a series of
cartwheels across the office carpet,
surprise questions should not be too
daunting.
Thirsk described the key for
good interviews.
"Know yourself very well," he
said. "Expect to be surprised, but if
you know yourself, you should be
prepared to answer any questions."
However, he warned, do watch
out for any queries that display dis
criminatory intent, delve too far
into your personal life or otherwise
make you uncomfortable.
Dan Colman, who received a
doctorate, in modern European his
tory in 1997 before turning to the
corporate world, knew who he was.
.. even when a prospective employ
er highly recommended he forget.
"I contacted the head of a re
search division in an investment
bank." Colman said.
At the interview, "he explained
why he wouldn't hire someone with
a Ph.D — salary expectations too
high, not enough experience, bored
too easily... I then asked him what
advice he could give me. His sugges
tion: take your Ph.D. off the re
sume."

Colman kept his Ph.D. where ii
was and happily went on to ;t de
sired position at a small consulting
firm.
Adventurers in the forest of the
"real world" are reminded that all is
not what it seems when it comes to
job interviews.
Rebecca Strait graduated in 1997
with a master's in biology. She had
three interviews with ;i San Francis
co ecological consulting firm, in
cluding two extensive visits to their

offices in Southern California.
The vice president, who had
been conducting the interviews,
said several times that the third visit
— an on-the-job interview — was a
final confirmation of what Strait al
ready knew: they would make her
an offer before she left.
Strait said. "I was sent home with
no offer and told that I would be
called with it. In the meantime, 1
took the VP at his word and turned
down my one other firm job offer, as
that position looked less appealing
than the one I was sure to be offered
any day."
Unfortunately for Strait, several
days went by before the company li
nally called, only to tell her they had

decided to look lor someone with
more experience.
"Never assume you have an oiler
until you can hold it in your hand."
she warned.
Ihirsk confirmed that confu
sions and confrontations between
employers and candidates regard
ing "the offer" are one of the inter
view process's biggest pitfalls. The
new trend of the "exploding offer"
is the most straightforward of these
difficulties.

According to Thirsk. "The idea
is that you have a certain time to de
cide before the otter goes 'poof and
disappears. We find that very un
fair. It's hard to make a decision in a
period of days or even as little as 48
hours. It puts a tremendous amount
of pressure on students."
Most problems with job inter
views are not the result of malice or
any kind of bad intentions.
"Most employers really want the
best for their interviewees because
they want to hire the best employ
ees. It's rare to find a real problem
these days. For the most part, re
cruiters are very professional,"
Thirsk said.
Sometimes the interview experi

ence is merely weird.
Reshon Anderson, Class of'%,
interviewed with the president of a
consulting firm in Menlo Park who
was also a Stanford alumnus.
"We sat down and begin talking,
and I noticed that he had a coffee
cup in his hand," Anderson said. "I
didn't think too much of it, until I
noticed that he was chewing some
thing. As we proceeded, 1 witness
the most horrific thing I have ever
seen in an interview — he spits a
huge brown spitball into this cup!
"He's chewing tobacco ... while
he's interviewing me!"
After considering whether or not
to ask the company president to
stop chewing. Anderson was suffi
ciently repulsed and decided "to en
dure the interview and just never
contact them again."
Other times the interview expe
rience reveals a clash of personality
or perspective between the inter
viewer and the candidate.
Julie Lynthcott-Haims, Class of
'89, was a first-year law student
when she was interviewing for a
summer public interest legal job.
During an interview for a prison as
sistance program, the interviewer
asked a question designed to get a
sense of her personality. She re
sponded with "some declaratory
statements about my bubbly, ser
vice-oriented personality."
Haims, however, was not satis
fied that her response was truly in
sightful and proceeded to depict an
analogy for her interviewer:
"If I were a bus driver, I would
say a friendly hello to everyone,
help people who were lost, and wait
for people running to catch the
bus."
According to I laims, "The inter
viewer sat stunned. I stammered. It
turns out they didn't want a bus dri
ver, they wanted a lawyer, and I
didn't get the job. The moral?
Sometimes creativity can leave
them thinking you're a wacko."
As they say. the path does not al
ways run smoothly, especially
through the forest of the real world,
but know thyself, check thy magic
beans before trading with gnomes
and you will end up where you want
to be.
