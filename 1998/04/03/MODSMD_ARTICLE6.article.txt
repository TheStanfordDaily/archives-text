sponsored b\ the I aw School's Fed
eralist SiK'ictv and was moderated
b\ ke\ in Young. the co-president of
the organization.
Approximate!) 20 people at
tended the speech, many ol whom
were students Cooper's hour-long
speech broached issues ol public
polic\ and moraliu In advocating
legislation based on traditionalism,
he promoted the conservative plat
form on current issues, while de
nouncing liberals for "rewarding
freedom without the responsibilit\
that goes along with it "
"The idea of no responsibilits
tries to save you from the conse
quences." Cooper said. "Hut it is the
consequences that steer you in the
right direction."

( ooper discussed a change in ihe
attitude of indi\iduals in the nation,
a growing trend toward respect for
"personal responsibility, faithful
ness. loyalty and a willingness to
maintain one's commitments." He
firmly assured the audience that the
"old. traditional ways" of operating
in government can still apply today,
since these methods are "tune test
ed."
"There are moral matters in

public policy making, and these
should not he experimental ones,
but ones that have been proven to
work throughout history," Cooper
said.
He went on to discuss issues such
as welfare, family values, work regu
lations. the tax code, bankruptcy,
the environment and divorce — all
revolving around the theme of "per
sonal responsibility." Cooper also
put forth his definition of the Amer
ican dream: a chance to give some
thing back to society through its
youth.
"I like to think of the American
dream as not to have your own
home, but to get your children out of
it. so they can do something in the
world," he said.
Cooper's speech was followed by
a response, given by Martha
Matthews, director of Family I lous
ing. Matthews, who gave a 10-

minute rebuttal, agreed with Coop
er's basic premise that there cannot
be "morally neutral public policy."
However, she attacked his no
tion of "tradition" by posing the
questions, "What is moral tradi
tion? Do not many moral traditions
exist?"
She looked at the high divorce
rate as one of the results of increased
female liberation, through which she
discussed the removal of the stigma
of divorce.
"If one of your traditional values
is to respect human dignity, then re
spect women's economic freedom,"
Matthews argued.
Matthews went on to examine
Cooper's views on welfare, the envi
ronment and work regulations, pro
viding arguments that revolved
around "different interpretations of
personal responsibility." She con
cluded with her views concerning
the American system.
" The real debate is from which
strands we should draw public poli
cy," she said.
