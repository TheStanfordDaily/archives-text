Married without children
DUBAI, United Arab Emigrates (AP) — The parents of Saudi sep
tuplets have separated because of the publicity generated by the births,
further delaying their babies' homecoming, the father said Saturday.
Abdullah Mohammad Ali said pictures of his wife appeared in Saudi
magazines and on Arab satellite TV channels seen in the kingdom —
and angered his in-laws so much that they are refusing to allow their 40-
year-old daughter to return to her husband's home.
Tradition in the conservative southern city of Abha, where the sep
tuples were born Jan. 14, dictates that women must cover their faces in
public.
"Her family says I am not a worthy husband because I have allowed
everyone to see my wife. They say I have besmirched my wife's honor."
Ali said in a telephone interview from his home. "I will not be able to
bring the children home until my wife gets back."
Forest report cites problems, progress
WASHINGTON (AP) Even though forests are disappearing at
an increasing pace, governments and consumers are beginning to take
steps to preserve them by changing official policies and refusing prod
ucts from badly managed forests, an environmental group says in a new
report.
But the report had plenty of bad news about the state of the world's
forests.
Since the 19605, wood consumption has doubled and paper use has
more than tripled. Each year, at least another 16 million hectares of nat
ural forest are razed, an area the size of Washington State. From 1960
to 1995, legal trade in forest products tripled to $142 billion, and sub
stantial amounts of illegal trade go unreported.
More people are taking an active role in recycling, the report says.
At least one-third of the fiber used to make new paper today comes
from recovered waste paper, up from less than one quarter in 1970.
Worldwide, over 40 percent of paper is now recovered and recycled.
King march finished
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Friends and followers of Martin Luther
King Jr. marked the 30th anniversary of his death Saturday by finishing
a march for justice he never lived to complete.
King was murdered in Memphis on April 4. 1968, while helping
organize a strike by city sanitation workers. A protest march, with King
in the lead, had been planned four days later.
Saturday's 4.000 marchers followed much the same route the origi
nal demonstration was to take. The march was among several held
across the country Saturday to honor King's memory.
James Nelson, 34, carried a replica of the famous "1 Am A Man"
sign favored by strikers in 1968.
"This is history and I want to be part of it," Nelson said. "1 want to
make sure people my age ... don't forget the dream. I don't want to let
Dr. King down."
