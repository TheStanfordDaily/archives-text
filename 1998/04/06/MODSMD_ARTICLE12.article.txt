# Clinton pleased with case dismissal
## Friends, aides hope for end to Starr investigation 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Clinton
says that if he were an average citizen. "Joe Six-
Pack." he might regret not getting his day in court
against Paula Jones. But as president, he says,
he's glad the case was dismissed and he can get on
with his job.
Americans are telling pollsters they want the
independent counsel's investigation of the presi
dent to end as well.
With a federal court decision last week to dis
miss Jones' sexual harassment law suit against the
president, friends of the president said yesterday
that the time is right for Clinton to speak out on
the other sensational case against him: allegations
of a sexual relationship with former intern Moni
ca Lewinsky of urging her to lie about it.
Clinton, in an interview in the rime magazine
edition on newsstands Monday, said the end of
the Jones case helps not only him but the United
States.
"If 1 were just a private citizen. Joe Six-Pack. I
would have mixed feelings about not getting a

chance to disprove these allegations in court."
Clinton told Time. But he added: "I don't have
mixed feelings as president, because having the
case dismissed and putting this behind us is plain
ly in the best interest of the country."
Clinton again denied Jones' charges that as
Arkansas governor in 1991 he made unwanted
sexual advances in a Little Rock hotel room.
Asked about the Supreme Court decision to
let the civil case against a sitting president pro
ceed. Clinton said he has done his best to live up
to the court's opinion that the lawsuit would not
affect his job.
The challenge was to keep his personal prob
lems and his official duties separate. "It's been a
test." he said, "but I've tried to do that."
1 Ie sai J the case alsT) confirmed historical an\ '
ieties that such a case "would have an over
whelming political aspect to it."
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright,
who dismissed the case, told Newsweek: "I don't
feel like niv decision was courageous. I'm sworn

to follow the law and 1 tried to do that. 1 just want
to go back to being a regular judge."
The president's aides offered that with the dra
matic turn in the Jones case. Independent Coun
sel Kenneth Starr should wrap up his investiga
tion so the White House and Congress can con
centrate on what's important for the country .
"The American people want less, not more."
adviser Rahm Emanuel, on NBC's "Meet the
Press." said of the investigations.
"We have important business to do as well, the
president does have a day job. and it's running the
only superpower on God's earth." said another
adviser. Paul Begala. on ABC's "This Week with
Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts."
A majoritv-of Americans appear to agree. The
latest Newsweek poll. aisTnbWdfound
57 percent of Americans saying Starr should end
his investigation of charges that Clinton commit
ted perjury about his relationship with Lewinsky
or encouraged others to lie about it. Thirty-eight
percent said Starr should continue.
