# Drunk driving limit remains unchanged

### 
WASHINGTON (AP)
Intense lobbying by the liquor and
restaurant industries helped pre
vent a House vote on legislation
lowering the threshold of drunken
ness behind the wheel.
Such laws should be left to the
states, not Washington, says the
Republican committee chairman
whose panel kept the measure off
the House floor. But its Democratic
sponsor says the committee action
proves unmistakably that "the
liquor lobby ... put profits ahead of
people's lives."
The legislation was an amend
ment to a giant highway spending
bill that would have taken highway
money away from states that don't
enact .OS percent blood alcohol eon
tent levels for drunken driving.
It is shaping up as one of the
most hard-fought drinking issues

since the drive more than a decade
ago to make 21 the nationally rec
ognized legal age for drinking.
A month ago. the Senate passed
such an amendment to its highway
bill by a strong (S2-32 vote, and Pres
ident Clinton has endorsed a
national .08 percent standard that
already is in force in 16 states.
Rep. Nita Lowey. D-N.Y.. main
sponsor of ihe House amendment,
angrily blamed the liquor and
restaurant lobbies for stopping her
amendment from even getting a
vote. "Today the liquor lobby bot
tled up our bill and demonstrated
loud and clear that they put profits
ahead of people's lives," Lowey
said.
Liquor and restaurant groups
admit that after losing in the Senate,
they waged a full-court effort in the
House. The National Beer Whole

salers Association and the Ameri
can Beverage Institute ran large ads
in Capitol Hill newspapers, sent let
ters to lawmakers and had whole
salers and brewers write or fax their
representatives.
The ABl's general counsel.
Riehard Berman. hired lobbyist
Ann Eppard. who for 22 years was
chief of staff to Transportation
Committee Chairman Bud Shuster.
R-Pa.. author of the highway bill.
"We're very proud of the folks."
said David Rehr. vice president of
government affairs for the beer
wholesalers. "They were not
embarrassed to tell people that this
was not the solution."
Normally members of the
National Restaurant Association
make lobbying visits to Congress
every fall. ITiis year, the association
moved up the schedule, and the

association's Kathleen O'Leary said
120 restaurant owners met with
their congressmen. Their aim: To
stress that ".08 is not the problem, it
is the chronic drinker, the abusive
drinker, underage drinking." she
said.
Jackie Ciillan of Advocates for
Highway and Auto Safety said the
last time they went head-to-head
with the alcohol and restaurant
industries was NB4. when Congress
was debating the nationwide 21
question. "They made the same
c hicken Little predictions, that the
sky would fall." Gillan said.
Beer wholesaler Rehr said their
side struck a chord with lawmakers
sensitive to the states' rights ques
tion. and the association's ads said
the Lowev amendment was "feder
al blackmail" that imposed Wash
ington's will on the states.
