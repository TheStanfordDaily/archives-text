## Editorial More convenient Axess 
### 
University should con
tinue expanding the ser
vices available on Axess

STARTING THIS QUARTER,
students will only be able to
register for classes on Axess
through the World Wide Web. This
user-friendly shift makes Axess-relat
ed tasks much easier for students
connecting from off campus. The
change also makes registration, filing
study lists and checking grades more
convenient for students living on
campus.
Connecting to the new Web format
is more straightforward, especially
for users who may have had trouble
deciphering the steps it took to con
nect through Folio. Most importantly,
it runs continuously on weekdays
from 8 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. and on the
weekends from 9 a.m. to 11:59 p.m.
This allows students to conduct aca
demic and housing necessities
throughout the day without logging
onto the Folio version, only to be dis
appointed at having missed the last
few minutes when Axess was avail
able.
While allowing Axess to run
throughout the day until midnight is
a vast improvement from its earlier
schedule, it would greatly benefit stu
dents to be able to connect to Axess
24 hours a day. Many students stay up
past midnight, and are often frustrat
ed in having to wait until later in the
morning to conduct business through

Axess.
Furthermore, students studying
overseas often have a difficult time
filing their study lists through Axess
because of time differences and the
fact that their centers are usually not
available at all times. Although we
realize that Axess requires time for
maintenance, maximizing the hours
in which it is available would be a
great service to Stanford students
worldwide.
Axess should also consider
expanding its services. Axess could
be used to track each student's
progress towards fulfilling his or her
major and minor requirements.
This could be done in a manner
similar to how Axess currently keeps
track of an individual's progress
towards completing University
degree requirements â€” GERs, the
language and gender requirements,
and writing and critical thinking.
While not essential for students'
academic planning, notification of
academic progress would be another
convenience.
Perhaps the Registrar's Office can
work with individual academic
departments to provide this service.
Ultimately, it may expand to notify
ing students of the requirements they
have yet to complete that are offered
in a particular quarter.
Ideally, students would be able to
file class lists at their convenience,
whether it is 3 o'clock in the after
noon or in the morning. We applaud
the University for recognizing that
need and taking the first steps
towards simplifying the process.
