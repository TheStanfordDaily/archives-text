Solve housing crunch
Fellow graduate students, have you seen
your choices for 1998-99 on-campus hous
ing? Not exactly what you would expect for
graduate housing at a private university like
Stanford!
Two hundred sixty of you will have to
share a tiny dorm room with a roommate!
Another 152 of you will live in one-bed
room apartments for two people, and 60 of
you will live in two-bedroom apartments for
three people.
In other words, a total of 472 graduate
students will either have to share a bed
room or have someone sleeping in the living
room!
Such cramped living conditions could be
tolerated for a term, but for an entire year?
Indefinitely? This short-term solution only
crams more people into the same amount of
space, while extra rent is collected from
these extra tenants.
One long-term solution is to build more
graduate housing. Yes, the housing boom
may cool off, but do you really think Silicon
Valley rents will become affordable to stu
dents within the next 10 years? And, yes, it
will cost Stanford land and money, but
Stanford already owns a lot of land, and
after paying for the initial cost of construc

tion, Stanford will make a profit by collect
ing rent.
Any long-term solution to our housing
crunch will take time to plan. Which means
we had better start planning and taking
action now.

Rethink rent suggestion
In a fascinating argument, Dina Binell
makes a variety of suggestions about how
the University might solve the current grad
uate student housing crisis (April 3). In her
second presented option, Binell suggests
that Stanford might "raise the rent, which
would decrease the demand for on-campus
housing."
"If the pain of housing costs are spread
more evenly," Binell explains, "graduate
stipends are likely to rise." Only an engi
neer (or perhaps a right-wing lawyer) could
engage in this kind of economistic self
deception.
Hey, Dina! Why don't you take some
time and learn how things work in the
humanities, which are replete with what
you probably would call "market imperfec

tions?" Your proposal — which gives new
force to the concept of "standpoint episte
mology"— wouldn't be so troubling if it
weren't representative of the most short
sighted and ideologically mystifying of cur
rent intellectual trends.

Revise SURE program
1 am writing to bemoan the inefficiency
of SURE, the familiar 5-SURE golf cart
service. I recently had a frustrating experi
ence that was reminiscent of many other
unsatisfactory experiences I and others I
know have had with this program.
After calling the service from Lagunita
around 12:45 a.m. on Thursday morning, I
was told the cart would be there in 10 min
utes. When the phone still had not rung
more than 20 minutes later, I called back.
The oh-so-helpful man at the desk
checked that I had indeed given him my
correct location and phone number, then
informed me that the cart "was just there,
but took off when you didn't answer the
phone." April Fool's. I guess, as the phone
had been totally silent.
When I asked if the cart could return,

he said, "Sure. After it drops someone off
at Slav Dom and then Robinson, he can
come get you."
I opted to walk home instead of waiting
another 20-plus minutes. Lord knows the
people who live in Sterling Quad and Slav
Dom need the ride far more than I do!
The night was pleasant, and the walk
home was less than 10 minutes and mostly
well-lit.
Stanford is lucky to have a relatively
insulated and safe campus, and it was not
a real problem to walk home.
Still, the SURE service is very ineffec
tive at achieving its stated goal of a safe
ride.
Due to the limited number of carts and
the setup of the system — first come, first
served as far as I can tell — the carts are
booked far in advance. Others have joined
me in the past of calling for a ride on a
weekend to find a 45-minute or even
hour-plus wait.
Often, I will choose to walk home
instead of stay somewhere strange waiting
for the cart. The setup of the system
means that few people can benefit from it
and may even be harmed while waiting for
a safe ride home.
I transferred from Brown University,
and I believe they had a much better sys
tem there. From dusk until 1:30 a.m. (2:30

on weekends), student drivers made a
loop of the entire campus in vans. There
were three shuttles which stopped at des
ignated spots every other block or so. This
meant the wait for one would never be
more than about eight minutes. Though
this lacked the convenience of door-to
door service, it was much more successful,
and many people took advantage of the
guaranteed ride.
Though weatherproof and larger vans
may not be financially available, Stanford
could easily adopt this system with the
present golf carts.
A loop could include sections of Cam
pus Drive. Mayfield Avenue, and Santa
Teresa Street to maximize locations stu
dents need to access.
I believe the SURE program could
benefit enormously from a more sensible
and accessible program.
