Activists often
talk about
"building com
munity." On issued such
as affirmative action,
immigrant rights and eth
nic studies, this proposed
community is often a

coalition of people of
color. At Stanford this usually involves
interaction among the groups represent
ing African Americans, Chicano/Latino,
Native Americans and Asian Americans.
These alliances often include feminist and
queer groups.
Forming coalitions is difficult work.
These constituencies share a marginalized
status in American society and have been
treated in similar ways by dominant
groups.
Yet they also have distinct histories and
relationships with the majority population
and with each other. As a collective, they
have ,been most effectively engaged on
issues of broad relevance such as Proposi
tions 187 and 209.
Organizing groups based on identity
politics can lead to the formation of rigid
binaries: people of color and whites, men
and women, queers and straights. While
claiming an identity is important, it can
alienate those who fall outside of that
claimed identity. Not all people's politics
can be defined by their physical appear
ance. At Stanford we have both conserva
tive black women and radically left
straight white men.
I have noticed many white folks orga
nizing around issues particularly relevant

to people of color. Many come to these
issues through Students for Environmen
tal Action at Stanford, the Women's Cen
ter or the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center. Some of them are
unsure about the role they play in these
struggles.
White students don't want to presume
to know how another ethnic group should
act on an issue, nor do whites want to have
their involvement attributed to white
guilt.
On this campus, forming alliances
among different groups of color is facili
tated by their institutionalization.
Members of ethnic centers, student
groups and theme dorms have ways to
contact each other. They have leaders,
places to meet, funding and University
recognition.
White students interested in working
on issues such as prejudice and cross-cul
tural understanding may find it more diffi
cult to form strong ties with these commu
nities.
They may not be accepted into these
communities due to suspicion and uneasi
ness on the part of the ethnic organiza
tions. Furthermore, these groups may not
provide a forum to speak about issues
from the perspective of white folks.
There are not always institutionalized
ways for eager white students to get
involved.
But they play a crucial role in achieving
equality, since this group has access to
much of the power. Why not work with
them — especially sympathetic, liberal
white folks?

I propose the creation of a White Stu
dents Association (WSA) on campus. This
would not be about white supremacy or
white guilt.
Rather, it would be a way for white stu
dents to form coalitions with people of
color and educate white students about
issues that are important to us all.
This would be a group of people who
are conscious of their racial privilege and
their critical role in the race debate. Of
course, not all white folks have the same
status, especially women, queers and
working-class people. But their physical
appearance does give them a unique claim
to America. A WSA would be an ideal
place to talk about race issues from a
white perspective, and to highlight, for
example, the invisibility of the white
working class in the issue of affirmative
action.
Institutionalizing white students would
facilitate greater interactions with people
of color through co-sponsored events,
conferences, activism and speakers.
It would also provide a way for white
students to think critically about how
"whiteness" has been socially constructed
and explore the history of white immigra
tion.
Little progress can be made on issues of
relevance to people of color without
including white folks, because access to
power and privilege is at stake. I think a
WSA is an effective way to reinvigorate
the race dialogue on campus.
