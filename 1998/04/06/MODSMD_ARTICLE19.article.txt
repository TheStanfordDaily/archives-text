## Alda Leu Giving a twist to six degrees of separation 
### 
Everyone at Stanford is
linked by two or fewer degrees of
separation. How good are you at
finding that eonneetion?
You've heard of "six degrees of separa
tion or even "six degrees of Kevin
Bacon." Now play "Two degrees to Stan
lordization."™ It's a fun, exciting way to
solidify your complete integration into the
Stanford community. Play with your
neighbor in class or with the ushers at
Flicks. Strike up a game in the computer
cluster or at the Coffee House. Play any
time, any place. You can be a winner!
Object: The object of the game is to
determine a mutual acquaintance so as to
find some common topic for banal conver
sation during an initial encounter with a
stranger. Fully Stanfordized students
should achieve stated objective each time
the game is played in a minimal amount of
time.
hqiiipincnt: The equipment consists ol
two people, a means of communication
(voice, telepathy, e-mail ...) and at least
24 hours as a member of the Stanford

community.
Prcparution: Stand or sit facing the
other person and extend hand to shake
and greet them. One person is designated
the "asker" and the other the "answerer."
The Piny: The asker is armed with an
arsenal of questions with which to deter
mine a common acquaintance with the
answerer.
These questions consist of:
1) Where do you live? Generally, this
lends itself it) the most connections. For
example, "I live in Granada" lends itself to
"Oh. I lived in Adelfa sophomore year." A
winning connection would entail some
thing like: "Oh, my roommate freshman
year was dating this guv whose Drawmate
now lives in [insert name of dorm/house|."
2) What ('IV are you in? Reserved for
freshmen just embarking on the path to
two degrees of separation. Also feeds con
versation about the relative easiness of
that particular ( IV program. Winning
connection: ' This girl |insert name] in my
advising group is in that CIV. She says it's
[insert level of difficulty]."

3) What's your major? Upperclass
equivalent of above question. Related
questions: Who's your adviser? What's
your focus? Winning connection: "My
next door neighbor from sophomore year
is writing a thesis in [insert niajorj
4) What are you taking this quarter''
Generic question appropriate for any stu
dent. Clever players may derive answer to
question 3 from this response. Winning
connection: "Do you know [insert name]?
He's taking that class this quarter."
5) Are you involved in any activities? A
somewhat riskier question that may make
answerer feel inadequate if he or she is an
antisocial library rat. It also may give
interview-like turn to otherwise innocuous
conversation. Winning connection:
" That's cool, my roommate used to be lab
partners with [insert name] who is [on
your team/in that club/in that sorority].'
6) Where are you from? GeneralK a
popular question for freshmen who have
yet to establish activities or majors. It is
also appropriate for conversations
between upperclassmcn il other options

have been exhausted. Winning connec
tion: Did you go to school with [insert
name]? I hey are from [ insert place], too."
7) Who's in your Draw group? For
upperclassmcn who seem to have Iriends.
()r alternatively who's your roommate?
I oi freshmen oi those who appear to be
socially maladjusted. Winning connection:
"()h my gosh! [Insert name] was in my sec
tion for [insert class title] all last year."
Most semi-Stanfordi/ed students will
be able to achieve said objective within
three questions. More experienced players
can make a winning connection with just
one question. This may require the asker
to si/c up the answerer and determine
which question would be most appropri
ate.
For example, il the answerer is a large,
muscular male student wearing a "Stan
lord Football" sweatshirt, an experienced
asker would gauge the situation and ask
about the answerer's participation in ath
letic activities. Or if the answerer is thin,
pale, sporting thick glasses and wearing
clothing that appears slept in.the asker

may choose to pre-empt a question about
the answerer's major and skip to "Do you
know (insert name]? He works in Sweet
I Jail a lot."
Or perhaps the answerer is Asian, car
rying a molecular biology book and wear
ing a "Harvard Medical School" sweat
shirt. A skilled asker may then decide to
skip directly to. "I used to work at Jamba
Juice with [insert name]. She used to be a
Hid Lab course assistant. Did \ou have
her?"
II you're not at that level yet. don't
despair.
You. too. can be a winner at the game
ot "Two degrees to Stanfordization."™
Each game brings with it new excitements
and new challenges.
Break down those social barriers!
Reach out and touch someone! Don't
delay, play today!
