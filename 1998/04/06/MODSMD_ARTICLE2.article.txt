## 
### Kumar Narayanan Contributing writer 
The Stanford College Bowl won
the national championship this
weekend at a tournament in
Nashville, Tenn.
Stanford's team sent Adam Ke
mezis, Rachel Marshak, Jesse
Molesworth and Alan Taber to Van
derbilt University to compete with
62 other teams.
"This is the tournament that
means the most," said Molesworth, a
doctoral student in English. "We
were not a favorite going in."
Stanford has placed in the top 10
for several years but has not won a
national title since 1978. the team's

inaugural year.
A tournament typically consists
of matches between two four-person
teams. A moderator asks a question,
and a team presses an electronic
buzzer as soon as it has the answer. A
match consists of 20 questions.
The questions themselves are
drawn from a broad base of knowl
edge that falls into three general cat
egories: literature, history and sci
ence. The team includes many disci
plines; for example. Taber is a senior
in mechanical engineering while Ke
mezis is a junior in the Classics De
partment.
"If I know a science question. I'll
answer it first." Molesworth said.
"Rut it ends up that I answer more

literature questions, and Alan an
swers more science questions."
Molesworth has a long history
with the College Bowl. He partic
ipated as an undergraduate at the
University of Maryland, placing as
high as second in this tournament.
He also competed in high school.
"You find more players did (com
pete in high school) than didn't," he
observed. "It's the nature of the
game — the ones who have played
(before) have more practice."
Molesworth stressed the impor
tance of practicing. Practice primari
ly involves reading previous ques
tions as well as writing new ones. At
a tournament, each team must sub
mit a pack of questions that are used

for competition.
The Stanford College Bowl club
hosts two intramural tournaments —
one in the fall and tine in the spring
— and sends teams to compete in
other tournaments.
These intramural events help the
College Bowl identify talented can
didates for the team. The club also
recruits from undergraduates and
prominent competitors from the
high school circuit.
Stanford teams have done excep
tionally well this year, winning five
out of the six tournaments in which
they have participated.
Stanford also has hosted two in
tercollegiate tournaments on cam
pus this year.
