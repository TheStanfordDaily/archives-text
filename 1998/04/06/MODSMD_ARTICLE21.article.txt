# Feinstein discusses U.S-China relations
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Contributing writer 
In a speech Friday night at the
Stanford Barn. Sen. Dianne Fein
stein, D-Calif., called lor a U.S. pol
icy of full engagement with China.
"The most important relation
ship in the world is between the
United States and China, and I'm
puz/led by the hour how little atten
tion is given to it," Feinstein said.
Feinstein blamed many of the
United States' difficulties in relat
ing with China on China's commu
nist politics and inadequate human
lights policies â€” attitudes eon
founded and crystallized by the
Tiananmen Square massacre.
"Tiananmen Square made it
hard for Americans to deal with the
Chinese," she said. "Many in this
country came to view China as sole
ly a brutal dictatorship.
"Americans have trouble treat

ing a non-elected government, es
pecially a communist one, as an
ally."
She admitted that China's
human rights policies remain
deeply disturbing to her.
" The Chinese continue to lock
dissidents up in prison, torture pris
oners, repress speech and religion
and pursue an unacceptable policy
with Tibet," Feinstein said.
To address these concerns, Fein
stein proposes that the United
States move Tibet to top policy in
IJ.S.-( 'hina relations, push for an in
dependent judiciary and continue
to press for the release of dissidents.
Despite these concerns, Fein
stein sees a positive change ap
proaching in U.S.-China policy,
marked most notably by President
Bill Clinton rescheduling his visit to
China from November to June. The
key to the future of this policy, she
feels, is to bring China in as a full

participant in the world's economic
community by allowing it to join the
World Trade Organization.
"When China joins the WTO,
China's (Most Favored Nation) sta
tus should become permanent," Fe
instein said.
She believes that another impor
tant issue is U.S. policy toward Tai
wan.
"The U.S. must do nothing to en
courage Taiwanese indepen
dence."she said. "At the same time,
we must not countenance any mili
tary action by China against Tai
wan."
Another topic that Feinstein
feels that Clinton should address in
his visit to China is nuclear nonpro
liferation.
"There are still questions about
whether China has truly turned the
corner on non-proliferation, but the
signs are encouraging," she said.
Now is the time for the U.S., when

Clinton goes to China in June, to
encourage China to join with other
countries in signing non-prolifera
tion agreements."
Feinstein noted that, although
China has not officially signed
many of the treaties on nuclear
arms control, it does follow their
guidelines.
Friday's speech was the midway
point of a two-day conference on
U.S.-China relations sponsored by
the Harvard-Stanford Preventive
Defense Project organized by Har
vard Prof, of Science and Interna
tional Affairs Ash Carter and Polit
ical Science Prof. William Perry.
Former Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili
and Rep. Howard Berman, D-
Calif., among others, attended the
conference.
Feinstein graduated from Stan
ford in 1955 with a bachelor's de
gree in history.
