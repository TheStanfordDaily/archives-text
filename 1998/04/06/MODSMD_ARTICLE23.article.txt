Battling windy conditions and
rain delays, Stanford's top-ranked
men's tennis team garnered two
more victories for a perfect IK-0
record so far this season.
"You don't play USC and
UCLA and sweep all the singles
matches very often," said head
coach Dick Gould after the matches
this weekend.

■ Saturday: Stanford 6, USC 0

But that's exactly what Stanford
did.
On Friday, Stanford defeated
No. 8 UCLA (12-4, 5-2 Pacific 10
Conference) 7-0. Although Stan
ford. now 7-0 in the Pac-10, swept
both singles and doubles competi
tion, it was by no means an easy
match for the Card.
The teams first played the singles
matches instead of the doubles due
to the threat of rain.
Senior Paul Goldstein's victory
over UCLA's Jean-Noel Grinda
went only two sets, as did Ryan
Wolters' match against Vince Alle
gre. Goldstein won 7-6, 6-3, and
Wolters took a 6-2,7-5 victory. Both
Grinda and Allegre are ranked in
the top UK), but they were no match
against the 41st- and 39th-ranked
Stanford players.
Sophomore Mike Bryan won 7-

5, 6-4 over Matt Breen while Boh
Bryan struggled hut pulled out a 2-6,
6-1,6-2 win over Alex Decret.
Junior Geoff Ahrams had an
easy time against Brandon Kramer,
winning 6-1,6-3, and freshman Alex
Kim had a tough three-setter
against Jason Cook, 6-4, 7-6, 6-3.
Kim was tied at 6-6 with Cook in the
second set when the rain began, and
the players were forced to take a 30-
minute rain delay. Cook came hack
to win the tie-hreaker and the set
after the delay, but 36th-ranked
Kim fought to win the third set 6-3.
"My playing was a little up and
down," Kim said. "Overall, I was
pretty happy with how 1 played."
Stanford also won the doubles
point, with the Bryansand Goldstein
and Wolters pulling out victories.
Abrams and senior Charles Hoevel
er did not get the chance to play.
Saturday's match against ninth
ranked USC proved to he even
more challenging for the Card. The
Trojans (13-5,3-2) got out to a good
start in the matches before the rain
delay, when things started to fall
apart.
"We handled the weather pretty
well," Kim said. "Coach empha
sized not losing our focus during the
rain delays."
Gould also felt the team held on
well after the delay.
"I thought they dealt with the
conditions really well," Gould said.
"1 was a little disappointed that
there was no doubles point played,
but we had a lot of good wins indi
vidually."
At No. 1 singles, Goldstein was
down 3-1 in the first set going into
the hour-long rain delay against
IJSC's George Hast I. Basil, a major
contender in last year's NCAA
Championships, could not pull out a
win Saturday. (ioldstein came back
strong after the rain delay to win the
match 6-4,6-4.
Wolters also had a rough start
against Roman Kukal. trailing 3-1
going into the rain delay. Wolters
managed to win the first set 7-5 but
lost the second to Kukal 6-3. In the

end, Wolters pulled out the victory
in a close 7-5 third set.
Both Mike and Bob Bryan had
easy matches against USC. Ranked
No. 10 in the country, Mike Bryan
defeated Patrick Gottesleben 6-3,6-
0, while Gould said Bob Bryan
"overpowered'' his opponent. Bob
Bryan only gave up two games in a 6-
1, 6-1 quickie against Fernando
Samayoa.
Gould said he was pleased with
Wolters, Goldstein and Mike
Bryan's play after the rain delay.
"With Paul and Ryan down 3-1
and Mike struggling at 2-2 at the
break, they really came back strong
and took command of the match,"
Gould said.

Abrams and Kim closed out the
singles with two strong wins.
Abrams only went two sets against
Kyle Spencer, winning 7-6. 6-2. but
Kim pulled out a three-set victory
against USC's C'ristoph Poehler6-l,
1-6.6-1.
"I thought we played a little bet
ter Saturday than we did on Fri
day." Gould said. "We're |ust get
ting back from break and from fi
nals and all. and we're not razor
sharp yet."
"As long we stay healthy, we'll be
fine, because as soon as we get a few
injuries things can start to fall apart,"
Kim said. "It's a great feeling to beat
these great teams, but we each know
that we have room to improve."
