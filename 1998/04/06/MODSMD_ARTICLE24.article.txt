comfortable with their routines
that they could nail them in their
sleep.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
■ Saturday: Stanford places third
with 11>4.625l l >4.625 at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships as Washing
ton and UCLA qualify for the
NCAAs.

But Saturday at the NCAA
West Regional at Washington, the
Stanford gymnastics team
couldn't manage to do its beam
routines awake, and it cost the
Cardinal a trip to the NCAA
Championships.
Stanford led the meet by four
tenths of a point going into the
final event, the balance beam. The
team watched its lead slip away as,
one by one, the gymnasts fell at
Hec Edmundson Pavilion. Only
two gymnasts, senior Amy Neil
and junior Tara La Morte. man
aged to stay on and hit the entire
ty of their sets.
"We've been making these
routines over and over: all of us
can nail t! i n 1 s : p " s;i11
junior co-captain Amy Muraka
mi. "It was a really tough loss —
it's hard to be on such a high note
with everyone doing so well and
then see people falling.
"It's unbelievable and a
shock."
Since each fall costs fiv« tenths
of a point and the team had to
count three falls, it was enough foi

the host Huskies to steal first
place with a score of 196.15 and
head to nationals.
Even if three gymnasts had hit
their sets, the Card could have fin
ished second and advanced to the
NCAAs with a wild-card hid. In
stead, defending national champi
on UCLA holds that honor with a
score of 195.1.
UCLA staged a huge come
back late in the meet. The Bruins
had languished in fourth place for
the first three events, but a heroic
effort on their final event, the
vault, allowed the Bruins to move
up to second.

Stanford missed going to the
NCAAs by four-tenths of a point
and finished with a score of
194.625. The squad had beaten the
Huskies and Bruins two weeks
ago at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.
Stanford started out with a b\e
and used the time to stay relaxed
and. above all. tried not to con
centrate on what the other teams
were doing.
Next up for the squad was the
floor exercise. The gymnasts hit
all of their sets well and finished
with a score of 48.K75. the second
highest team score in the meet de

spite tight judging. Stanford was
led by sophomore Sarah Harding
(9.K25) and senior Keri Monahan
(9.825). both of whom tied for
fifth place.
After another bye. the squad
returned to the apparatuses and
hit a great vault set (49.15). good
for a second-place team finish.
What was once the Card's worst
event had become one of its
strongest. The Card stuck its land
ings and had clean execution, fin
ishing strong behind UCLA.
