# Baseball takes two of three from No. 2 Trojans
## Stanford validates its lofty ranking 
### Brian Eule Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — The phrase
"the Battle of Troy" was given new
meaning this weekend on the USC
campus, where the No. 1 Cardinal
took two of three baseball games
from the No. 2 Trojans (28-8,14-4).

BASEBALL
■ Friday: Stanford 1, USC 0
■ Yesterday: Stanford d. USC 7-6
(game 1). USC d. Stanford 7-4
(game 2).

Although rain delayed Friday's
game at Dedeaux Field and canceled
Saturday's, forcing a Sunday double
header, Stanford (27-5-1, 12-3 Pacif
ic 10 Conference Southern Division)
was still able to prove why it is ranked
one notch higher than the men of
Troy (28-8,14-4).
In what was one of the greatest
games of the season, as well as an in
credible pitching battle, Stanford ju
nior Jeff Austin (9-0) pitched a com
plete game in the opener, striking out
eight batters and shutting out the
Trojans. Austin earned his ninth win
of the season in as many appear
ances.
Trojan senior Seth Etherton (8-1)

pitched a brilliant game for USC as
well, striking out a career-high 15 and
allowing only four hits. Matching
each other inning for inning, there
was only one major difference be
tween the two star pitchers — Austin
had Jody Gerut on his side and
Etherton didn't.
"It was one of the few mistakes he
made all game," the junior center
fielder said of the Etherton curveball
which he returned to the parking lot
behind the right-field fence. "Fortu
nately for me, 1 was looking curve
ball. 1 knew it went over the score
board."
Gerut's solo home run in the top
of the seventh was the only run
scored, giving the Cardinal the 1-0
victory.
"You're not going to see a better
baseball game," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "I was very
proud of the way Austin pitched.
(Etherton) is a great pitcher. He was
dominating us. but Austin matched
him."
Etherton, the 1996 Six-Pac Pitch
er of the Year, continued another
outstanding year, retiring 18 of the
first 19 Cardinal batters he faced.
"Etherton's having one heck of a
year." Austin said. "He's a master at
his craft."
The modest Austin pitched a ca
reer game himself. His eight strike

outs gave him 259 career strikeouts,
tying him for ninth on Stanford's all
time career strikeout list.
The Trojans came close to match
ing Stanford's run. when in the bot
tom of the ninth they had a runner

got as far as third base. Austin, how
ever. was not about to give up the
game, nor his perfect record.

ball seemed to have a little more juice
on it."he said.
With two outs in the bottom of the
ninth. IJSC first baseman Robb Con
sent a fly ball deep into the right-field
corner, but sophomore right fielder
Nick Day was waiting for its landing,
ending the game with a Trojan
baserunner on third.
"It's huge." said Marquess of win
ning the game. "Winning any of (the
USC games) is big.
Pitching 8 1/3 innings in his
longest game of the season yester
day, junior ('had Hutchinson (6-2)
earned the win in the first game as
Stanford won 7-6.
The Cardinal scored two runs
early in the first inning when sopho
more first baseman John (iall and ju
nior third baseman Josh Hochge
sang both had shots to the outfield,
and Stanford scored a third run in the
third inning.

Unlike Friday's game, however,
the Trojans were quick to come
back, scoring three runs and tying the
game in the bottom of the third. But
Hochgesang's solo home run in the
sixth inning put the Cardinal back on
top.
Hochgesang. who went 3 for 5 at
the plate with three RBIs, added to
another Cardinal rally during the fol
lowing inning. singling to USC short
stop Seth Davidson with the bases
loaded. Freshman designated hitter
Joe Borchard and junior second
baseman Tony Schrager each batted
runners home to give Stanford a 7-3
lead.
While Hutchinson pitched seven
scoreless innings. USC made one last
valiant attempt at a comeback in the
bottom of the ninth. A three-run
homer by Gorr off Cardinal fresh
man Justin Wayne put USC down by
only one run.
But Wayne was able to hold on to
the lead, earning his fourth save of
the season.
In the second same of the double

header, however, the Trojans gained
control early on. scoring two runs in
the second inning and leading for the
first time in the series. Never looking
back, USC defeated junior Brent
Hoard (2-2) and the Cardinal 7-4.
"It would have killed us (to lose
all three)," said USC head coach
Mike Gillespie, who was swept by
Stanford at Dedeaux Field last year.
"It was a grind. These were three
rugged games. To not fall three
games behind these guys was ab
solutely critical."
Gorr had his second home run of
the day in the third inning, adding to
the Trojans' lead.
Stanford made its greatest at
tempt at a comeback in the fifth in
ning. when Gerut doubled to drive in
two runs, but Trojan designated hit
ter Jason Lane (4-0), who later
pitched in relief, homered in the bot
tom half of the inning to silence the
Cardinal.
"I was very pleased with every
body." Gillespie said. " This race has
vet to be won."
