# Baseball takes two of three from No. 2 Trojans
## Stanford validates its lofty ranking 
### Brian Eule Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — The phrase
"the Battle of Troy" was given new
meaning this weekend on the USC
campus, where the No. 1 Cardinal
took two of three baseball games
from the No. 2 Trojans (28-8,14-4).

BASEBALL
■ Friday: Stanford 1, USC 0
■ Yesterday: Stanford d. USC 7-6
(game 1). USC d. Stanford 7-4
(game 2).

Although rain delayed Friday's
game at Dedeaux Field and canceled
Saturday's, forcing a Sunday double
header, Stanford (27-5-1, 12-3 Pacif
ic 10 Conference Southern Division)
was still able to prove why it is ranked
one notch higher than the men of
Troy (28-8,14-4).
In what was one of the greatest
games of the season, as well as an in
credible pitching battle, Stanford ju
nior Jeff Austin (9-0) pitched a com
plete game in the opener, striking out
eight batters and shutting out the
Trojans. Austin earned his ninth win
of the season in as many appear
ances.
Trojan senior Seth Etherton (8-1)

pitched a brilliant game for USC as
well, striking out a career-high 15 and
allowing only four hits. Matching
each other inning for inning, there
was only one major difference be
tween the two star pitchers — Austin
had Jody Gerut on his side and
Etherton didn't.
"It was one of the few mistakes he
made all game," the junior center
fielder said of the Etherton curveball
which he returned to the parking lot
behind the right-field fence. "Fortu
nately for me, 1 was looking curve
ball. 1 knew it went over the score
board."
Gerut's solo home run in the top
of the seventh was the only run
scored, giving the Cardinal the 1-0
victory.
"You're not going to see a better
baseball game," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess. "I was very
proud of the way Austin pitched.
(Etherton) is a great pitcher. He was
dominating us. but Austin matched
him."
Etherton, the 1996 Six-Pac Pitch
er of the Year, continued another
outstanding year, retiring 18 of the
first 19 Cardinal batters he faced.
"Etherton's having one heck of a
year." Austin said. "He's a master at
his craft."
The modest Austin pitched a ca
reer game himself. His eight strike

outs gave him 259 career strikeouts,
tying him for ninth on Stanford's all
time career strikeout list.
The Trojans came close to match
ing Stanford's run. when in the bot
tom of the ninth they had a runner

got as far as third base. Austin, how
ever. was not about to give up the
game, nor his perfect record.
