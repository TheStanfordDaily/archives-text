The week began with the Pacif
ic Coast Intercollegiate Tourna
ment at Sandpiper Golf Course in
Santa Barbara, and concluded with
the Anteater Invitational in Coto
De Caza. Calif.
Junior Joel knbel anchored the
team in the opening round at Santa
Barbara with an impressive 2-
under-par 70. but he could not du
plicate the feat the next day. hand
ing in a 76.
Despite his disappointing sec
ond round. Kribel tied for third

overall, behind onl\ Nate Dunn of
Cal State-Stanislaus and John
Mallinger of Long Beach State.
The team experienced similar
fortunes, faltering a hit after a
strong first day.
Freshman Alex Aragon turned
in a 74-79—153, and sophomore
Tvlar Lunke dropped two strokes
to a second-round 78 after
Wednesday's 76.
Stanford opened the tourna
ment with a fourth-best 284. but
fell to Nth after a disappointing
319 the final day.
A duplication of Wednesday's
team score would have placed
Stanford first.
"You can see — we started off
well, but then that (second round)
hurt us." said Stanford head coach
W ally Goodwin.
The team fared better at the
Anteater Invitational, which was
held at Coto De Caza Country
Club. Stanford took fourth place
behind UCLA, Washington and
California, kribel again took third
with a combined three-day score of
214, finishing well with a final
round 69.
The big improvement in the
team's overall score, however.
came from the efforts of sopho
more Dusty Brett (20th overall)
and freshman James Lee (24th
overall), who finished a combined
97 places higher than they had at
Sandpiper.
The mixed results of the two
tournaments leave Stanford up in
the air as to whether the Cardinal
will make the field of 12 that con
tinues on to the West Regional
next month.
Currently ranked 13th, the Card
greatly helped its cause at Coto De
Caza, but muddled matters with
the 14th-place finish at Sandpiper.

Usually there's a gradual
drop-off. This year, the pack
is real thick from (teams
ranked) 11 through 14. Last
year we were 12th and
made it.'

"Usually there's a gradual drop
off. This year, the pack is real thick
from (teams ranked) 11 through
14," Goodwin said.
"Last year we were 12th and
made it."
The team is now in Santa Cruz
at the Western Intercollegiate
Tournament at Pasatiempo Golf
Course, a two-day event hosted by
San Jose State. After the comple
tion of that event tomorrow, Stan
ford will turn its attention to the
home front.
The Cardinal will host the Stan
ford Invitational April 11-13 with
out its most dangerous weapon.
"Kribel is going to miss that be
cause he'll be playing in the Mas
ters," Goodwin said. "Hopefully
the selection committee will take
that into account when looking at
our scores."
