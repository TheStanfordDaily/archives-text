## 
### Jaime Adame Contributing writer 
Dr. Kate O'Hanlan. a former fac
ulty member at the School of Medi
cine recently filed a lawsuit claiming
she suffered discrimination at Stan
ford due to her sexual orientation.
She lectured to ftO people about ho
mophobia on Friday at the Medical
School.
O'Hanlan, a gynecolegic cancer
surgeon, was denied reappointment
in 19% after serving as an assistant
professor for almost six years at Stan
ford. During that time, she won the
Gender Equity Award in Medicine
and the Kaiser Preclinical Teaching
Award. She has twice been named
one of the Bay Area's best doctors by
San Francisco Focus magazine.
She currently has a private prac
tice in Portola Valley.

Titled "Homophobia as a Health
Hazard," the lecture addressed the
origins of homosexuality and homo
phobia. illustrating the problems fac
ing gays and lesbians and possible
ways to help offset those problems.
"Kids learn subtle messages from
society and parents that they're not
OK." O'Hanlan said, citing several
surveys and psychological journals
that showed decreased self-esteem
among gay and lesbian youth.
"There is objective evidence that
these kids don't see a future for
themselves," she said.
O'Hanlan said homophobia can
be viewed as a variant of sexism,
often caused by people seeking to re
assure themselves of their own sexu
ality.
O'Hanlan went on to discuss re
search done to determine the cause
of homosexuality, drawing laughter

from the audience of mostly medical
students when she joked that les
bians have a gene for bad haircuts
and gay men a gene that allows for
freer movement of the wrist.
After explaining some of the the
ories and research done in this field,
she concluded that sexual orienta
tion was "probably not [a choice] but
maybe."
"I support everybody in living
close to their heart," O'Hanlan said.
She said homophobia is a major
problem in the health care industry,
citing a 1989 survey of nurses and a
1986 survey of doctors that revealed
widespread homophobic attitudes.
O'Hanlan later read from a list of
concerns facing homosexuals, smil
ingwhen she mentioned job fairness.
"Is there a homosexual agenda?
There is, and this is it." she said. The
list also included education, privacy.

housing fairness and insurance bene
fits.
In the early 19905. O'Hanlan was
instrumental in a campaign that led
to insurance benefits for same-sex
domestic partners of University em
ployees.
"As doctors, as pillars of society,
you can share with people your non
biased attitude." O'Hanlan said,
adding that she doesn't let inappro
priate comments — regardless to
whom they are directed — pass by
without her censure.
"I want homophobia to be your
problem." she told the audience.
She advocated the use of generic
terms on office forms to avoid bias
against homosexual patients and
urged the audience to speak with
their patients about sexual behavior
using nonjudgmental language.
"You'll be a more thorough doc

tor and able to do the good work that
you want to do," she said.
The lecture was a part of the
"Queer Health and Medicine" series
sponsored by the Lesbian Gay Bisex
ual Transsexual Meds. Lectures will
be held every Friday at the Medical
School at noon. Next week's topic is
"Health Issues of Queer Youth."
Speaking after the lecture,
O'Hanlan downplayed the effect of
the lawsuit on her interaction with
the University. The lawsuit is focused
on specific individuals, she said.
"I'm still very active in teaching
fat Stanford J." she said, noting that
she has spoken before students, resi
dents and faculty members several
times since her departure.
"It's not controversial that 1 am a
wonderful teacher, that I love to
teach and that teaching medicine is
mv life's mission.'' she said.
