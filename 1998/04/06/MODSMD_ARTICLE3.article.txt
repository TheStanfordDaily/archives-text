### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
Stanford's second annual Islam
Awareness Week — aimed at in
creasing understanding of Muslim
history, culture and politics —
kicked off yesterday and will contin
ue through Saturday with speeches,
discussion groups and a food bazaar.
"The purpose of the week is to in
form the general Stanford popula
tion about Islam and Muslims and
dispel many of the misconceptions
that are prevalent in the West," said
coterminal student Imran Maskatia.
president of the Islamic Society of
Stanford University and one of the
week's organizers.
Activities began yesterday with a
discussion at the Women's Center

on "Politics of Misrepresentation:
Women and Power in Islamic Soci
eties."
Other activities will feature food
from various Muslim countries, in
formation about the basic precepts
of Islam and speeches on subjects
ranging from Pakistan's foreign pol
icy (given by Ahmad Khalal, Pak
istan's representative to the United
Nations) to Christian and Muslim
perspectives of slavery (by Howard
University Prof. Sulayman Nyang).
The week's events culminate Sat
urday with an Eid banquet benefit
ing the East Palo Alto Muslim com
munity. The proceeds of Saturday's
banquet will be donated to the East
Palo Alto Muslim community.
"We're pretty excited that all our
hard work will finally pay off this
week," said freshman Narjes Mish
ergi, who co-chaired the event with
sophomore Nauman Khan.
According to Mishergi, similar
Islam awareness weeks are orga
nized by Islamic student organiza
tions in colleges throughout the
United States and Canada; the con
cept was conceived by the Muslim
Students Association of North
America several years ago. In previ
ous years, members of the Islamic
community at Stanford had wanted
to put on such an event but weren't
able to "muster up the resources,"
Maskatia said. However, the recent
growth of Muslim student groups
on campus enabled them to start
small last year and expand this year.
Campus groups organizing and
sponsoring Islamic Awareness
Week include the Muslim Students
Awareness Network, the Islamic
Society of Stanford University,
Pakistanis at Stanford. Persian Stu
dents Association, the Internation
al Undergraduate Community, the
ASSU Speakers Bureau and the
ASSLJ Program Board.
