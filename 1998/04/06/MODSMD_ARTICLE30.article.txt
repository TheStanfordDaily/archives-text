MEN S VOLLEYBALL
■ Friday: Long Beach State d. Stan
ford 15-13,15-13,8-15,15-6.
■ Saturday: Stanford d. IJSC 8-15
15-6.12-15,15-10.15-7.

The sixth-ranked Cardinal (14-
7, 13-6 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) dropped Friday's
match to No. 7 Long Beach State
15-13.15-13,8-15,15-6 but defeated
13th-ranked USC in a five-game
match Saturday, 8-15, 15-6. 12-15,
15-10, 15-7.
Fifth-ranked Hawaii has now
clinched the MPSF's Pacific Divi
sion title and home-court advan
tage in at least the first two rounds
of the MPSF playoffs. The Cardinal
is now tied with the 49ers (18-6.10-
6) for second place in the Pacific Di
vision, so a loss by either school
would give the other the runner-up
spot.
Stanford again utilized its bench
this weekend, showing seven differ
ent starting sixes in nine games. Of
the seven lineups used, none was
the starting lineup that the Cardinal
has relied on most of the season.
Twelve Cardinal players made
game appearances in at least one of
the two matches.
Stanford has recently had diffi
culty finding six consistent players

to put on the court and has relied on
the impressive play of its bench to
keep it close in matches.
Friday's match can be consid
ered a missed opportunity for the
Cardinal. Stanford held the 49ers to
a .258 hitting percentage but was
unable to convert that into a win.
"When we hold a team to .258,"
Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves
said, "we need to be good enough
offensively to win the match."
Overall, Stanford had just two
effective hitters in the match — se
nior middle blocker Keenan White
hurst and sophomore outside hitter
Andy Witt. Witt paced the Cardinal
with 27 kills, while Whitehurst hit a
match-high .565 and added 17 kills,
seven of those in the first game of
the match.
"Because [the 49ers] didn't have
to worry about our other hitters,"
Nieves said, "they were able to slow
down Whitehurst effectively."
Witt and Whitehurst also led
Stanford defensively. Witt posted
seven digs while senior middle
blocker Tad Hoffman and sopho
more outside hitter Josh Palacios
each added six digs. Whitehurst led
the Cardinal with eight blocks,
while Hoffman and freshman setter
Brad Griffith each added six.
Stanford was forced to bounce
back in an effort to avenge a loss
earlier this season to USC (10-13,6-
10 MPSF), when the Cardinal trav
eled to North Gym in February.
The match was also important for
Stanford's attempt to play at home
in the first round of the playoffs.
"The team knew how important
the match was," Hoffman said.
"We knew that we had to win to

stay in second place in our divi
sion."
Stanford began the match
slowly, losing two of the first three
games. In the final game of the
match, the Cardinal hit a near
perfect .900 with no hitting errors.
Saturday was a much better
night for several C ardinal players.
Stanford doubled the number of
hitters who recorded more than 10
kills, from two players to four. Ju
nior outside hitter Patrick Klein led
all hitters with 23 kills.
Hoffman led the Cardinal in hit
ting percentage (for players with
more than one attack) with a .565,
adding 15 kills for the Cardinal. He
was also strong on the defensive
side, posting match-leading num
bers with 10 digs and 15 blocks
(four solo and 11 assisted).
"Whitehurst is a more respected
middle hitter, and USC concentrat
ed more on slowing him down,"
Hoffman said. "I was open, and I
had a better night tonight" than last
night.
Whitehurst added nine digs for
Stanford, while Klein and freshman
setter Josh Lukens each added four
blocks. Three Stanford players —
Poolman. Whitehurst and Lukens
— each posted two service aces for
the Cardinal.
As Stanford approaches the
postseason. Nieves said the Cardi
nal needs "to find consistency day
in and day out."
Because the Cardinal has little
chance of receiving an at-large bid
into the four-team NCAA tourna
ment. it will likely need to win the
MPSF tournament in order to
make an appearance.
