# Women runners take first place at Mathias Relays
## Injured men's team finishes meet in third place behind Nebraska and Fresno State 
### Will Chang Contributing writer 
The weather forecast for Satur
day in Fresno, Calif., was extremely
windy and cold. For the competitors
at the Bob Mathias Relays, that
meant two things: slower times for
the runners and shorter distances for
the throwers.
Despite these adverse condi
tions, the Stanford women's track
and field team pulled off a close 6.5-
point victory over Nebraska, Fresno
State and Cal State-Northridge.
Despite numerous injuries. Stan
ford men's track and field team
ended in third place, 41 points be
hind the first-place Cornhuskers and
second-place Bulldogs.
The women's throwers scored
big with a first-place finish front
sophomore Allison Beatty, who
threw 138 feet in javelin. Freshman
Whitney Drumright finished second
in javelin with a throw of 131 feet. 10
inches. Sophomore Summer Pier
son came in a close second, just an
inch behind Cheree Hieks of the
Matadors, with a 165-7 throw in dis
cus.
"It was a really great meet for the
throwers," said sophomore Cassan
dra Romuld. "We felt really confi
dent going in.and the results reflect
ed it."
The women's throwing victories
were accompanied by success in the
women's distance events. The Card
dominated the top spots in the 1.500-
meter run with first- and second
place finishes. Senior captain Monal
Chokski won in 4 minutes. 20.05 sec
onds. and senior Sara Moore fin
ished 23 hundredths of a second be
hind.
Senior Kortney Dunscombe
came in second with a 17:11.53 in the
5,000-meter run.

meter run by swiping the second

through fifth-place finishes. Junior

Stanford pack, followed by junior
