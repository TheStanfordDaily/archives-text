## West calls for promoting values 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
Cornel West, professor of religior
and Afro-American Studies at Har
vard University, delivered a com
pelling and inspirational keynote ad
dress at Saturday's "Where Do Wt
Go From Here?: A Colloquium or
Race in the 21st Century."
The day-long colloquium, spon
sored hy the Mack Law Students As
sociation and the Stanford Law
School, featured panel discussion;
on criminal justice, race and educa
tion. coalition building and the future
of the civil rights agenda.
Panelists included academics
public policy experts and represents
tives from nonprofit organizations.
The date of the conference coin
cided with the 30th anniversary ol
Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassina
tion.
West's address, given to an audi
ence of 500 in Kresge Auditorium
focused on restoring the democrati(
traditions of political mobilizatior
and commitment to larger siKia
causes in an era where "market val
ues" have taken over.
West described this loss of demo
cratic tradition as the greatest proh

lem facing society today. "The raw
stuff of democratic tradition, of
struggle, the motivations and inspira
tions for compassion and commit
ment â€” we're losing that in America.
It's waning, the 'we,' it's weaker,
more feeble." he said.
In the iy7os and 'XOs. West said.
America experienced a rise in "mar
ket values." a conviction that the
marketplace will take care of social
problems and racial inequalities.
But West argued that non-market
values such as love, compassion and
a commitment to a larger cause must
also play a part in addressing racial
inequality and social ill.
"You can move things when you
internalize that kind of compassion."
he said. "It cuts against a market sen
sibility."
In answering the question "where
do we go from here," West said, "you
have to give a prominent role to non
market values."
West challenged the notion that
America is experiencing a time ot
prosperity, based on assessments of
the stock market and economic per
formance and productivity.
"Let's be honest." he said. "It i*
not a good time for certain Ameri
cans."
He pointed out that approximate
ly 50 percent of Chicano / Latino and
black children live in poverty in the
United States, one of the wealthiest
nations.
"Martin Luther King is crying out
from his grave, Where's the out
rage?' " West said.
To move forward, he said, society
needs to sustain hope. "Hope is
about participating in the struggle,
pushing it forward a little while we
are here and then transferring it to
the next generation."

"Can we sustain a sense of
hope?" he asked. "I believe it's an
open question."
'i think we have seeds of hope,
but so much depends on how much
courage we can muster," he said.
West received a standing ovation.

President Keith Jackson encouraged
the audience to be active participants
in the colloquium's panel discus
sions.
"What we want for you to do is
open your mind and really challenge
yourself," he said. "How do we get to
where we want to be as a nation?"
A letter to the audience from
President Bill Clinton was also read,
in which he sent "best wishes to all
for a productive conference."
