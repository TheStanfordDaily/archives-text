Some say Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare has revitalized the
National Science Board, the bod\
of which he is chair.
When Zare's six-year term ends
this May. he aims to have distanced
the board from what Chemical <x
Engineering News called a "reputa
tion for obscurity, sleepiness and ir
relevance" and to have converted
the board into an institution with
more influence over the national
science scene than it had when he
took charge.
The board, based in Arlington.
Va.. is a panel of 24 science leaders
appointed by the I S president to
serve staggered six-year terms Its
two primary functions are to over
see the National Science Founda
tion — which annualh funds $3.7
billion of research at Stanford and
other academic institutions — and
to advise Congress and the presi
dent on the state ot American sci-

ence.
When Zare
was appointed
the board's chair
in IW2. he said,
its advisory role
was relatively
low-key although

significant influence. Zare wanted
to take lull advantage of the board's
potential. "I wanted [the hoard] to
he more." he said.
With that in mind. Zare moved
to increase the board's influence in
American science. The most con
troversial of these moves was the
1997 publication of a paper arguinu
that national priorities should dic
tate the nature of NSF-funded re
search.
That paper constituted "an im
portant shilt in the perception ol
basic research: that basic research
could indeed support national
