# Zare ends term
## Chair of National Science Board looks back 
### Huat Chye Lim Contributing writer 
Some say Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare has revitalized the
National Science Board, the bod\
of which he is chair.
When Zare's six-year term ends
this May. he aims to have distanced
the board from what Chemical <x
Engineering News called a "reputa
tion for obscurity, sleepiness and ir
relevance" and to have converted
the board into an institution with
more influence over the national
science scene than it had when he
took charge.
The board, based in Arlington.
Va.. is a panel of 24 science leaders
appointed by the I S president to
serve staggered six-year terms Its
two primary functions are to over
see the National Science Founda
tion — which annualh funds $3.7
billion of research at Stanford and
other academic institutions — and
to advise Congress and the presi
dent on the state ot American sci-

ence.
When Zare
was appointed
the board's chair
in IW2. he said,
its advisory role
was relatively
low-key although
structurally. it
could Tave had

significant influence. Zare wanted
to take lull advantage of the board's
potential. "I wanted [the hoard] to
he more." he said.
With that in mind. Zare moved
to increase the board's influence in
American science. The most con
troversial of these moves was the
1997 publication of a paper arguinu
that national priorities should dic
tate the nature of NSF-funded re
search.
That paper constituted "an im
portant shilt in the perception ol
basic research: that basic research
could indeed support national


Zare
needs," said Hansen Experimental
Physics Laboratory Director
Robert Bver.
Another major change the board
has made under Zare has been the
promotion of greater cooperation
among parties involved in NSF
funded research efforts. There
"should be a convocation of all
stakeholders to set up priorities"
and determine other aspects of re
search. Zare said, using a hypothet
ical research facility as an example.

If "the Department of Energy
wanted to build a [hypothetical]
neutron spallation source," he said,
it would look to the NSF and others
to use the facility. In the end, the en
tire project would benefit if the var
ious agencies involved cooperated
"to see how to build the facility and
to suboptimize the [research] bud
get."
Byer characterized the Stanford
research community's reaction to
Zare's direction of the board as
"positive, very positive."
Not all reactions have been as
good: John Gibbons, then science
adviser to President Clinton, initial

ly reacted with anger to the board's
research priori tics paper on the
grounds that the paper's proposi
tion. if implemented, would intrude
on his advisory duties. However,
Gibbons has since been reconciled
with the board's views.
Although the board is based in
Washington, its decisions ultimately
impact the Stanford community,
Zare said. The NSF. which the
board oversees, "pays for a large
fraction of what goes on" in Stan
ford research in fields as diverse as
chemistry, physics, biology, com
puter science and engineering.
Stanford commands a relatively

significant amount of the NSF's $3.7
billion annual research budget, he
said.
In addition, the NSF helps fund
graduate fellowships and undergrad
uate summer programs at Stanford.
"If we can help everybody set re
search priorities, we'll have more
money to do research" and appor
tion to Stanford and other institu
tions, Zare said. That is important,
he believes, because "our country
can move ahead by investing in
more support for science and engi
neering."
Science, Zare said succinctly, is
"our future, our children's future."
