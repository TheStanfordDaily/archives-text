Do you think
having an ASSU
president and
vice president
with no previous

ASSt) experience is a good thing?
Sophomores Matt Crystal and
Jonathan Lotzdo. "I don't consid
er my lack of contact with the
ASSU to be a bad thing," said
Crystal, who is running for presi
dent in next week's election.
"We're average students and
have the average Stanford stu
dent's perspective."
Crystal and Lot/ also promise,
if elected, to come into office with
specific reforms in mind
"Most candidates say things
like they want to make the ASSI'
more accessible to students, hut

If elected, ASSU presidential candidate Matt Crystal and vice-presidential candidate Jonathan Lotz
hope to fully automate the financial aid disbursement system, allow upperclassmen to deny a Hous
ing and Dining Services meal plan and make better use of Frost Amphitheater.
they don't give details," Lot/ said.
Among the changes that Crystal
and Lot/ who are on track to grad
uate a year early — propose is the lull
automation of the financial aid dis
bursement system.
Under the current system, stu
dents have to stand in line to piek up
some of their loan checks.
"Unless you ask to have it other
wise. there's 110 reason why you can't
get your loan money directly trans
ferred to lower your tuition hill,"
Crystal said.
Crystal objects to the current
system not only because it wastes
time and paper, hut also because it
forces students receiving Financial
aid to stand in a line at Tresidder
Union.
"It's not right to make a process
like that public," Crystal said. "It's a
violation of your right to privacy."
One of the pair's admittedly most
ambitious proposals is giving upper
classmen the option to purchase a
meal plan.
Currently, all students who live in
dorms with meal plans are required
to purehase at least 12 meals per

week.
"We realize that the University
has an economic interest in not al
1< wing that to happen, so. if that's im
possible. we'd at least like to make
the meal plans more flexible," Crys
tal said. "If they could let you buy
only 10 meals a week, maybe, even
that would be better."
Crystal and D)tz also would like to
see an expanded use of Frost Am
phitheater.
"You get to see Frosted Ricks
once a year, and then Frost disap
pears from sight." Lot/ said.
Crystal noted that in past years,
the amphitheater hosted performers
like the Grateful Dead.
1 le proposes holding concerts and
festivals in Frost, including a "Shake
speare in the Park" festival in the
spring.
Crystal and Lotz also would like to
see more student input in the running
of Cowell Student Health Center.
"We've all heard so many horror
stories about Cowell," Lotz said.
"We think the way to fix that is to get
students involved."
"If you look at the Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center, you'll see that
it's Cowell's best resource center,"
Crystal added. "It works so well be
cause it's student-run."

"We'd like to make the rest of
Cowell accountable in the same way
by having a student committee meet
with the administrators of Cowell
once a month."
The two would also like to see
more student input in decisions made
by the Office of Residential Educa
tion.
"One-sixth of the University
signed a petition for Alpha Sig. and
Res Ed made no response," Lotz
said.
"A trend I see in housing is to con
formity," Crystal added. "All the
houses are starting to look and feel
the same, and that's really unfortu
nate."
They propose forming a student
committee to meet with Res Ed to
discuss any future housing changes.
Although neither Crystal nor Lotz
have been involved previously with
the ASSU, both have other leader
ship experience.
Crystal was dorm president in
Otero last year and is vice president
of the Kappa Alpha fraternity. Lotz
was dorm president in Roble last year
and is currently in dorm government
in Mirnelees.
"There are other ways of getting
leadership oo campus besides the
ASSU," Crystal said.
