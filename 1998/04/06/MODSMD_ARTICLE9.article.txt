## Clash protested in Israel 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — In a sign
of increasing restiveness, Israeli
Arabs called yesterday for a gener
al strike to protest hrutal clashes
with police that began after author
ities demolished three homes in a
northern Bedouin village.
The clashes, which began late
Saturday night, were among the
worst in 20 years between Israeli
troops and Arab Israelis who are
caught in an uneasy limbo between
the country's Jewish majority and
the Palestinians of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
Twenty-two police officers and
about two dozen protesters were
injured, said police spokeswoman
Linda Menuhin. Eighteen
protesters were arrested.
"This definitely represents the
beginning of a more activist and
militant response of Israeli-Arabs
to Israeli authorities ... something
we may well be seeing more of in
the future," said Elie Rekhess, a
professor of Arab affairs at Tel

Aviv University.
Israel's 1 million Arab citizens
nearly a fifth of the country's
population — have rarely engaged
in violent protests like those in the
West Bank and Gaza.
But as the Israeli-Arab peace
process founders, and with it the
prospects of resolving their alien
ation within the Jewish state, the
Israeli Arabs' politicization has
grown. It has been compounded by
the government's failure to close
the economic and social gaps that
have left Israel's Arab citizens in
general, and the Bedouin in partic
ular. lagging behind the rest of the
country.
The clashes broke out in the
Bedouin village of Suweij in north
ern Israel and spread throughout
the night to include Arabs from sur
rounding villages. Arab youths
spilled out onto the main road,
throwing rocks at passing cars.
"We will not agree to this sort
of humiliation and oppression,"

Salah Saliim, an Israeli Arab
member of Israel's Knesset, said
on Israel radio. "It is as if we are in
occupied territory. We are Israeli
citizens, with Israeli identification
cards."
The clashes began when hun
dreds of police arrived in Suweij to
stop a group of Bedouin from
rebuilding three homes that had
been demolished by police on
Thursday.
The Interior Ministry said the
homes were put up recently without
permits. Local residents insist they
had been standing for more than 40
years.
The eight Bedouin families liv
ing in the village, along with hun
dreds of other Arab Israelis from
surrounding villages who had come
to help rebuild the homes, threw
rocks at the police and threatened
them with sticks, chanting, "Dear
Saddam, bomb, bomb Tel Aviv."
Police responded by clubbing
protesters and firing tear gas.
