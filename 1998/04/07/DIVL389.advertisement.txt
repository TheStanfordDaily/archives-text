Power Control, and Motion control.
Analog Design Engineers
If you are graduating with an BS/MS/PhD EE with very strong
analog design skills, these positions will provide the opportunity to learn
advanced IC design while developing systems engineering skills. Design
Engineers will have the cbhnce to work in advanced BiCMOS/CMOS
process technologies. You will also design and develop analog and mixed
signal ICs, including/Chip definition, circuit design, simulation, layout
supervision, debyg; characterization and release to production.
Test Development Engineers
If yOu are graduating with a BS/MS EE, enjoy working on analog and
mixed-signal circuits, and have computer programming skills, our Test
Development Engineering opportunities may be your ticket. You will use
your understanding of analog and digital circuits to design hardware and
software that performs complex electrical screening of our mixed-signal
ICs on automatic test equipment. You will insure this testing correlates to
laboratory benchmarks. You will work closely with our IC Design, Product
and Applications Engineers to define and implement a test program that
guarantees parametric and functional operation of the IC.
