What's it like to "fly" at 18,000 feet? Just ask
Beau Peelle, a senior majoring in Biology, and
Jonathan Bruck, a junior majoring in Inter
action Design. Beau and Jonathan are skydivers
who have each "flown" dozens of times. The
pair started skydiving on a whim, and now they can't get
enough. Says Bruck, "Skydiving is the ultimate form of physi
cal freedom The sport is great because in 60 seconds of
freefall, you seemingly have hours to contemplate your life
and put things in perspective." The duo thinks everyone
should try skydiving at least once in their life, and Peelle
guarantees rookies that once they start, they'll be hooked—
"with just a twist of the hand and a little bit of gravity, you can
send your body spiraling down at speeds in excess of 150
mph, and there's nothing in the world quite like it."
