# Pamphlet blasts Res Ed

### Evan Nordby Contributing writer 
Students opposed to next year's changes in University
housing distributed copies of a pamphlet criticizing the
decisions at the Founders' Day festivities on Sunday.
The pamphlet, titled "Stanford's Ignorance of Student
Voice," detailed the numerous grievances recently ex
pressed by residents of Alpha Sigma, graduate resident
assistants, the Disabled Students of Stanford and resi
dents of Kimball and Toyon Halls. ()n its cover, the pam
phlet purports "to bring more attention to the unfair man
ner in which students are being dealt with."
"We designed it to be informative," said junior Santos
Marroquin, co-editor of the pamphlet. "We reached a
larger audience than just students" at the Founders' Day
luncheon, including parents, alumni and faculty mem
bers.
"Although it was small, we wanted people to know
that we're still working," Marroquin said. "We've gotten
a lot of support from people that realize this is far bigger
than just |the ()fftce of Residential Education] — no stu
dent involvement in the University."
However, "we have a dialogue forthcoming" with
University administrators, he added. Each group oppos
ing the housing changes submitted a section for the pam
phlet. Sophomore Jason Mendelson, Alpha Sig house
manager, described his house's "dissatisfaction with how
Res Ed took houses without input" for sorority housing.
Mendelson noted that Res Ed Director Jane Camaril

lo faulted Alpha Sig for a lack of dorm programming.
"We had a faculty dinner, and they didn't know. White
tablecloths and all, two weeks before they took our house
away." he said. " The pamphlet is just another way to let
people know. We're still knocking on doors, telling 'em
we're still here."
Junior Jessica Lehman contributed on behalf of the
Disabled Students of Stanford, opposing the conversion
of Kimball to upperclass housing.
"We spend a lot of time fighting lor access," Lehman
said. "A lot of disabled frosh have lived in Kimball."
Lehman explained that Synergy. Mirrielees and Palo
ma are the only houses on campus with elevators. Kimball
is one of the most handicap-accessible dorms outside o!
those, and the addition of an elevator this summer will
make it even more so. Stanford's policy regarding dis
abled student housing promotes totally accessible hous
ing as optimal for disabled students, for social reasons as
well as practical, she noted.
Kimball is "a great place for anyone to live," Lehman
said. "Stanford goes on about (how) residential life is so
important — they had an opportunity to improve the sit
uation and didn't."
"The Kimball issue goes far beyond disabled stu
dents." said junior Thai I ran, the dormitory's resident
computer coordinator. "We have 60 happy frosh liv ing in
Kimball.
He noted that the population there is equivalent to a
Florence Moore all-freshman house,
but with the reeogni/ed benefits of
upperelass residents as role models
and peer advisers. 1 ran also lauded
Kimball's extensive programming
aimed at its freshman population.
"We're the Res Ed dream.'' he
said.
Chemistry doctoral student Jason
Wong, a graduate RAin Lyman
1 iall. added his perspective.

I he pamphlet "is one way of get
ting the University to acknowledge
the graduate student perspective on
these issues," he said "We want to
make sure that the University real
i/es the negative impact that there
cent changes will make on thegradu
ate community ."
Marroquin said the authors o! the
pamphlet plan to revise their puhli
cation and distribute it at other
spring events, possibly including
Flicks and sporting events.
Camarillo was unavailable lor
comment.
