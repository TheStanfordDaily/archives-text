Dow hits 9,(MM)
NEW YORK (AP) — Hulling past a new mile
stone, the Dow industrials yesterday closed above
9,(HM) for the first time, extending a relentless climb
that got its final nudge from the biggest business
merger ever.
The nine-month journey, which included a brief
detour below 7,000 during ()ctober's swoon. w;is long
and hard — at least by recent standards.
But dire predictions of the bull market's
impending collapse just five months ago could not
choke investors' appetite for stocks, yesterday's
first-time close above 9,000 by the Dow represents
a stellar 14.2 percent gain for this year, ;i bigger
climb than even the most optimistic forecasts for all
of IWB.

got its picture snapped for the first time in two
