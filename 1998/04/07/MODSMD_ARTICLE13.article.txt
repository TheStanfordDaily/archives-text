Founders' Day celebrated
institutional memory, not
"robber baron" legacy

AS I TALKED with students
around campus last week, I
kept hearing them express
mixed feelings about Sunday's
Founders' Day celebration. Some indi
cated that the notion itself was
"cheesy" while others voiced distaste
at commemorating Leland Stanford
Sr., the "robber baron" who exploited
"Chinese railroad workers."
While I understand the origins of
these reactions, 1 was saddened to see
that some students seemed to be losing
sight of the day's significance as they
siijgle-miudedly criticized Stanford's
moral character or attended solely to
eat the free food.
Granted, Stanford was a "robber
baron," but without him, none of us
would be where we are today.
As I think about my own education
at Stanford, 1 realize how deeply the
University's history and figures like
the Stanfords, David Starr Jordan, and
Payson Treat have affected the educa
tional opportunities that I've had.
As a history major concentrating on
Asia. 1 am a beneficiary of the Univer
sity's 90-plus years of commitment to
the study of Asian history. At the turn
of the century, in spite of its relative
youth in comparison to East Coast
institutions. Stanford was very pro
gressive in Asian studies. This is even
more remarkable given the
widespread anti-Chinese and Japanese
sentiment in California during the
period. Indeed by 1914, there were
two professors teaching Asian history.
One of them was even a Japanese
national. Professors in fields such as
law and economics also took great
interest in Asia.
The institutional impetus for the
promotion of Japanese studies came
from then-University President Jor
dan, an ichthyologist who had traveled
extensively in Japan. A quick check of

Socrates reveals that he wrote 20-
some-odd works on different species
of Japanese fish. While his writings on
Japanese eels aren't particularly inter
esting to me, Jordan's voluminous cor
respondence with professors at univer
sities in Japan demonstrates the impor
tance of the Asian connection to the
University's development.
And if it weren't for the other oft
maligned Stanford alumnus Herbert
Hoover, the University would not
have had an extensive collection of
books on Asia by the middle of the
second decade of the 20th Century.
But it is not only through the aca
demic channel that the University has
helped Asia become a part of my life.
For 35 years. Volunteers in Asia, a
nonprofit volunteer organization, has
enabled hundreds of Stanford students
to interact with East and Southeast
Asians through cultural exchange and
English instruction programs. As a
1997 Treat Fellow through Volunteers
in Asia. 1 had the opportunity to meet
and learn from students from Japan,
Thailand and Singapore in a full-circle
exchange program. And how did Vol
unteers in Asia get started? It began
with a dinner conversation at Wilbur
Dining Hall.
I bet if you sat down and considered
your interests, there would be some
thing historically unique about Stan
ford that made these things possible.
11l us, 1 urge each of you to put aside
your gut reactions about the Stanfords
and think instead about the way that
the lives and legacy of the Stanfords,
Jordan, Branner, Wilbur, Terman, etc.
affect our academic and non-academic
pursuits every day.
Founders' Day is a built-in opportu
nity to find that personal connection to
the University. And it is important to
remember that Founders' Day is
about much more then the Stanfords
themselves. It is about how genera
tions of students, faculty and alumni
have kept institutional history memory
alive and bequeathed it from one gen
eration to the next.
