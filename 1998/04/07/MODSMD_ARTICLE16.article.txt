## Entertainment over education 
### 
SOONER THAN
expected, the first
week of the quarter
is behind us, and with it
goes that curious "shop
ping period" we've
become so enamored
with. For it is only during
this week that we can

take SO units. Wo are true Renaissance
men and women, collecting syllabi and
weighing options. Professors present
themselves to us cautiously, detailing the
mechanics of their courses, while simulta
neously being careful not to overstate the
burden of their demands. After a fair
amount of scrambling, comparing one pro
fessor's lecture style to another, courses
are chosen and the first week of an all-too
short quarter dissolves away.
However, the criteria by which we
eventually select courses is fatally Hawed.
Witness the tentative shoppers who sit in
the lecture hall as close to the exit as possi
ble, ready to flee at the words "rigorous,"'
"demanding" or "cumulative final." Class
es that meet too early in the morning, too
many times a week, or don't captivate our
limited attention spans are ruled out. We
actively search out courses that will enter
tain us, where the tone is conversational
rather than academic, and the professor is
filled with amusing anecdotes rather than
abstract theories.

The result of this selection process is a
eollege education that is "enjoyable"
rather than challenging or potentially
unsettling/We gravitate toward courses
that show films or slides and deal with
aspects of popular culture. The easiest way
to double the attendance in any class is to
casually mention "Monty Python and the
Holy Grail" or Madonna in the course
description.
We want professors who are first and
foremost entertainers. Economics Prof.
John Taylor's Halloween tradition of
dressing as a pumpkin and Psychology
Prof. Philip Zimbardo's various stunts in
class have earned them a following on
campus that their academic reputations
and rhetorical skills never would. Gaieties
is perhaps the ultimate expression of this
desire to see our instructors lay down their
academic pretenses in order to entertain
the student population — in a way only a
macarena-dancing Gerhard Casper can.
Thus, the thin distinction between ped
agogy and performance is increasingly
blurred. Professors must literally dance in
front of us to claim our attention. This is
not to claim that .the study of classics is
superior to that of cultural studies or that
film and television have no intellectual
worth. Neither do tired platitudes about
Generation X and the slacker mentality of
college students ring true in the ambitious
and competitive environment that Stan

ford fosters.
In the confusion between effective
teaching and frivolous entertainment —
where the teaching merits of a professor
receive a score in the ASSU Course Guide
akin to a figure skater's mark for artistic
impression — student demands for a
greater emphasis on teaching in the hiring
and tenure processes are disabled.
We are open to criticisms that claim that
a liberal education is lite entertainment for
bored college students. In a recent article in
Harper's Magazine, Mark Edmundson
writes that "University culture is ever more
devoted to consumption and entertain
ment, to the using up of goods and images
... today's generations are the progeny of
1 (X) cable channels and omnipresent Block
buster outlets. On good days they display a
light, appealing glow; on bad days, shuffling
disgruntlement. Hut there's little fire, little
passion to be found."
We should expect more from ourselves,
whether it be signing up for a section that
conflicts with Must-See TV or participat
ing in a rigorous, if potentially offensive,
intellectual debate around the dinner
table. The experience might not be quite as
pleasurable as an episode of Seinfeld, but
it is considerably more real.
