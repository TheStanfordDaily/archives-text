Course guide worthless
What a joke.
Isn't that what we all were thinking
when we paged through the ASSIJ Course
Guide and then tossed it into the trash can?
Not only is the guide hard to read and
poorly assembled, but the information it
contains is worthless.
What the course guide needs is a Roset
ta stone, whieh would give as much infor
mation as the time schedule.
Contrary to last Wednesday's editorial
in The Daily, the course guide is not a good
first attempt. It is a terribly disastrous first
attempt.
It humored us, however, to read Matt
Spence's opening welcome on the first page
of the "guide." He declared it to be the
"culmination of years of collaboration
among students, administrators, and facul
ty"
More disturbingly, Spence wrote that
the course guide "represents the potential

of the student government at Stanford."
If Mr. Spence honestly believes that the
course guide in its present situation repre
sents potential, then I do not want him in
the ASSU.
He says that he is looking for ways to
make the course guide better by using more
student input and involvement in the
future.
He should have used more student input
earlier.
The course guide seems to be the epito
me of the ASSIJ this year: doing a less
than-mediocre job and then afterwards
looking to the students for help and ideas.
What the course guide represents is the
need for someone who has a clue.
The Undergraduate Advising Center, in
a letter on the inside of the course guide,
urges that many other resources may be
more helpful than the guide. These
resources include departmental Web
pages, academic and departmental advis
ers, and the opinions of friends.
Our question is, why didn't Mr. Spence
and his group compile some of that more

useful information during those "years of
collaboration?"
As transfer students, we are continually
in awe of all that Stanford has available to
us. This course guide has been our first
major disappointment.
The course guide does try to serve a
worthy goal, but so far the ASSU has failed
miserably to achieve anything of use.
I'm sure we can find people to better
allocate and direct our resources and pro
duce something more useful than what we
have seen in the course guide.
