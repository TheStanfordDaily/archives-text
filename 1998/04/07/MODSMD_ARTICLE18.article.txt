# Showering with the boys
## Seven homeless friends ... one cozy single 
### 
Vanessa Bartsch

I HAVE A single. In fact, I have a big,
fat, cushy, high-ceilinged palace. For the
second year in a row. And I'm just a
junior.
1 live smack dab in the heart of campus.
I am part of Res Ed AND I have hardwood
floors, huge closet space, room for a couch
and a breezy view of a gorgeous courtyard.
Hate me if you want,
For two years I have been living in this
luxury. Consuming my selfish space, playing
any music I please at any time. Free to nap
at the drop of a hat, to pull all-nighters like
a mad freak and all the while never worry
about upsetting a soul.
The combination of a down-comforted
bed and a 7-foot plush couch, nicknamed
the Man Trap, creates the perfect equation
for some serious lovin'. Life is good.
*• The only thing wearing on my soul is the
knowledge that somewhere out there, five
people are cohabiting a converted dorm
Jtudy room with less personal space than
Summer camp. Meanwhile, 1 could invite
4he entire men's basketball team over for
cocktails.

I have it a 11... sort of.
Last week 1 returned to campus, to my
single, excited to welcome back my friends
who have been abroad. One by one they
returned, toting hundreds of bags and big
crocodile tears. Not a single one of my six
guaranteed-housing comrades had been
assigned to a residence.
So much for room-warming parties.
In this time of companion vagrancy. 1 did
what any single-owning soul is obligated to
do: 1 opened my doors.
My room has become a happening place.
For the past week. I have been having more
fur than a frisky salamander in Lake Lagu
nita.
My room has become the happening
place. My friend Kathleen has claimed the
coveted couch position. After returning
from six frolicsome months in Chile, Kath
leen was left to live in a dumpster outside
Escondido Village.
There have also been cameo visits by
Carolyn, Karen, Chrissy, Lindsay, Jeff and
John to name a few, all awaiting classes or
their day of walk-on destiny.

My little love nest has slept more people
than a pay-by-the-hour motel.
The phone has been ringing off the hook,
and I seem to have four people around to
answer it. It's great having my own call
screening service and a couple of personal
secretaries.
And last week, when I returned from
classes, stressed out and upset with more
than a few aspects of life. I opened my door
and smiled. They had the windows wide
open and the radio blaring 'KOs rock. Car
olyn was lying in my bed reading Cosmo,
Kath was sitting at the computer e-mailing
someone in Spanish, and Karen was
sprawled out on the couch talking to one of
my friends on the phone.
Truly a welcome sight. In seconds they
had me from feeling like a dehydrated
amoeba to romping like a playful sea otter.
Such is the way of true friends.
Having these wonderful people at my
beck and call has made me realize a few
things. Though I appreciate my friends, us
time rolls and classes become upper-level
seminars, I rarelv stop to appreciate any

thing but sleep.
And when I finish the day. I run off to my
sweet single and relish time alone. But,
when I stop to think about it. after I gradu
ate I am going to have a whole lot of "alone
time," so lately it has seemed silly.
Right now, I should be crammed into a
room living on top of my friends. They are
the ones who pull me out of slumps, drag
me to places I swore I'd never frequent and
make me do things I'd never do alone.
Roommates are live-in playmates. And
they have to be there to listen to you.
because all of their stuff is in the room.
Sooner or later, we all need clean clothes.
I won't try to argue that you should love
every person you have to live with. 1 too was
a freshman. 1 had two random roommates
and a pretty small room.
And we ran the gamut — from huge
fights over spilled ramen to laughing until
our sides hurt over late-night bunk talks.
We dealt with each other's varying stan
dards of cleanliness — in living styles and in
boyfriends.
So after that first year, when I drew alone

into a place of many singles, I wanted space.
Hut with that space comes a little bit of
loneliness. Yes, it is true that there is no one
hooking up in your bed when you are gone
for the weekend, hut there is also no one to
share laughs with.
When something strikes me as entertain
ing or provoking. 1 have to pick up my
phone and dial five digits.
Because here at Stanford, where you are
never more than a mile from any friend's
door, people are lazy enough to rationalize
not making a cross-campus visit. I call my
friend who lives 40 feet from my house
when I could just as easily hoof it on over.
That is what happens when you live
alone. You get just what you've always been
craving: space. But you miss your friend's
crazy morning hair and spontaneous late
night kitchen raids.
Having roommates for a week was just
what I needed. A little taste of what could
have been.
