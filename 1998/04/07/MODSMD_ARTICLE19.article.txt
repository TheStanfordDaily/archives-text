"We were a little disappointed
with our showing this weekend be
cause we knew we could have won

all of the games," junior Michele
Acosta said. "However, we showed
good determination in coming back
twice after losing to split with both
teams."
Against the Beavers on Satur
day, the Card lost the first game 3-2,
but rebounded to take the second
by a score of 1 -0. On Sunday against
the Ducks, Stanford again dropped
the first game of its doubleheader 6-
1 but took the second game in com
manding fashion, 4-0.
Stanford got things started
quickly against Oregon State in the
first inning taking a 1-0 lead. The
Beavers responded in the third by
capitalizing on a Stanford error to
score three runs, two of which were
unearned. Stanford got another run
in the top of the fifth, but the
Beavers were able to hold on to the
3-2 lead and take the game.
I he second game in the double
header turned into a pitching duel
between Stanford junior Marey
Oouch and Oregon State's Ail-
American sophomore Tarrah
Bevster.
I he game was scoreless into the
sixth until Crouch helped her cause
b\ putting herself into scoring posi
tion with a double. Junior Michele
Aeosta batted in Crouch for the
game-winning RBI.
Crouch won a hard-fought battle
on the mound by tossing a complete
game two-hit shutout.
"Splitting on the road against
teams of this caliber is an indication
that we're doing okav." Stanford

coach John Rittman said. "Realisti
cally, I think we could have won all
four games. We definitely should
have taken three out of four, but we
struggled at the plate."
On Sunday, Oregon jumped on
Stanford early in the first game by
scoring two in the first and three in
the fourth to take a 5-0 lead. The
Card responded in the top of the
sixth when junior Jenny Foyle
scored from third when Acosta
grounded out to second. The Ducks
scored again in the bottom of the
sixth to seal the victory 6-1.
Just as it had done against the
Beavers, Stanford came back in the
second game for a little revenge. In
the third inning, sophomore Kelly
Wiginton started things oil lor the
Card when she doubled to right.
Foyle followed with a double of her
own to score Wiginton from second.
Junior slugger Michele Schneider
then reached on an error and scored
Fovle from second base.
