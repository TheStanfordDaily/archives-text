# Insurance woes
## Injured female athletes not offered same benefits as male counterparts 
### Wrenn Levenberg 
Have you ever thought of pur
chasing insurance against yourself?
Most people our age haven't, but
student athletes who are on their
way to a career in professional
sports seriously consider this op
tion and can pursue it through the
Exceptional Student-Athlete Dis
ability Program.
According to Senior Assoc.
Athletic Director Cheryl Levick.
this NCAA-sponsored program
"provides an avenue for student
athletes who have pro potential to
purchase insurance against them
selves during their senior year in
college."
But this program is only avail
able to male student athletes who
will finish their college career as
first- or second-round draft picks in
the NFL. NHL. NBA or Major
League Baseball. Generally, the
athlete purchases an insurance pol
icy for his senior year, which then
terminates once he is drafted when
the team takes over the insurance.
In the process, an athlete who
sees himself on the way to obtain
ing a professional sports contract

first contacts an insurance compa
ny. The chosen company then con
tacts the prospective professional
league, which determines whether
the athlete is eligible.
The price of the insurance is
based on the athlete's anticipated
income, and because most leagues
have a set salary for first- and sec
ond-round draft picks, insurance
companies can predict this income
and thus project potential income
loss, should injury occur.
This is "a wonderful program,"
Levick said. "It helps keep students
across the country from going pro
early."
It may be wonderful, but it is
also confusing and costly.
First, the athlete is personally
responsible for setting up this in
surance. He receives no assistance
from the NCAA or his school. Ath
letic Affairs Coordinator Susan
Burk encourages athletes to call
numerous companies to compare
rates. This is particularly important
since students often hear about this
opportunity through agents, who
could have a side deal with a partic-
ular insurance company.
The athlete must then make
sure that the chosen insurance
company fulfills all of the NCAA
guidelines that have been estab
lished in order protect athletes' col
legiate eligibility.
Finally , he must purchase the in
surance.
Such an insurance policy is not
cheap. In response to the high costs
of this insurance, the Exceptional
Student-Athlete Disability Pro
gram allows students to gel the in
surance on a deferred-payment
basis.
This opportunity is described in
the NCAA Division I Manual: "An
individual may borrow against Ins
or her future earnings potential
from an established, accredited
commercial lending institution ex
clusively for the purpose of pur
chasing insurance against disabling
injury or illness that would prevent
the individual from pursuing a cho
sen career."
P:.'rU. ipation in such a program
is " v ital," said sophomore Mark
Madsen, a forward on the Si: niord

basketball team.
"Any athlete who has a chance
to be a high pick in professional
athletics and who opts to return to
school for the senior yeai should
definitely take out an insurance
policy."
Millions of dollars could be lost
if injuries occur without insurance.
Presentlv no Stanford athletes
participate in this program It is dif
ficult because athletes do not begin
lo inquire until their senior year.
For one student athlete. Burk said,
almost half the season was over by
the time lie had obtained an ade
quate policy.
B\ that time, it was not worth it
to make the purchase.
Female athletes are excluded
from this program because there
were no professional team oppor
tunities for women until recently.
I lowever, the establishment of the
ABI and WNBA has opened up
such opportunities for women, and
a two-vear history of women's pro
fessional basketball should provide
a benchmark by which insurance
companies can determine potential
salary ranges.
Knee injuries to basketball stars
Vanessa Nygaard and kristen
Folk! this winter have spurred in

vestigation into female athlete's ac
cessibility to the Exceptional Stu
dent Athlete Disability Program
b\ the Athletic Department. Lev
ick would like to see this program
available to women by this coming
tail, especially for volleyball and
basketball.
Confusion arises in this pursuit,
however, as a function of the new
ness of these leagues. For example,
drafting procedures for women are
very different from the NBA. An
athlete may sign a contract with the
WNBA and then participate in an
internal draft, but she waives the
right to drafted in the ABL. And in
the ABL, athletes are drafted bv
region, not by team.
There is no protocol for the
drafting procedure in the women's
leagues. "Organizations are way
too fluid." Burk said, "to nail down
how this will work" for female ath
letes.
Another problem, according to
Burk. is not knowing about the
program.
"I don't believe women's bas
ketball coaches knew this existed
for athletes."
Despite all of these hurdles.
I.evick is optimistic "to get some
thing going foi this fall."
