■ Friday's result: No. 2 Stanford
13, No. 13 San Jose State 2.
■ Saturday's result: Stanford 9. No.
9 UC-Davis 8.
■ Sunday's result: Stanford 10,
Hawaii 9 (OT).

After defeating on Thursday, the
Cardinal jetted off to paradise to
face San Jose State, UC-Davis and
Hawaii. Regardless of the tough
schedule — the team played three
games in four days — and the in
evitable jet-lag, Stanford played well
enough to leave the island of Oahu

with three victories under its belt.
"We played with a lot of compo
sure this weekend," said head coach
John Tanner, summing up the
team's performance.
The second-ranked Card began
the weekend with a Friday game
against No. 13 San Jose State. Stan
ford was ahead 8-2 by the half and
put away five goals in the last two
quarters while holding San Jose
scoreless for a final score of 13-2.
Team scoring leader and sopho
more hole-set Ellen Estes again led
the team in scoring with four goals
while freshman Dani Bell con
tributed three to the Cardinal effort.
Scoring for San Jose were Laurel
Ciovett and Monica Turner.
The Cardinal received strong de
fensive play both from junior goalie
Heather Crary and freshman goalie
Alii Henry, who tallied two and four
saves, respectively.
On Saturday. Stanford played
No. 9 UC-Davis in a close match that
ended with Stanford coming out
ahead 9-8. Sophomore Suze Gard
ner led the offense with three goals,
Estes and freshman Kelly Shouey
eaeh scored two, and Keszler and
Bell each scored one.
In the final game of the weekend,
Stanford was down 8-7 and Hawaii
was man-up on offense in the final
quarter. The Cardinal defense
stopped the Hawaii attack and coun
tered aggressively enough to earn a
five on six at the other end of the
pool. With a minute left on the clock.
Shouey scored the tying goal to take
the teams into overtime.
In the second period of overtime.
Estes scored the final goal of the
game that ended with Stanford edg
ing Hawaii 10-9.
The Stanford defense was able to
shut down Hawaii's most dangerous
player, tournament MVP Marie-Luc
Arpin. who only scored one goal
under the defensive pressure of

guards Welsh and Gardner.
But Tanner was not satisfied on
the whole with the play of Stanford's
normally stellar defense, although
the offense played better than it has
all season.
Stanford had to struggle through
out the games against Davis and
I lawaii to keep its lead.
"We couldn't hold a lead," Tan
ner said. "We would get ahead hv a
couple of goals but we couldn't ex
tend it any."
In spite of the few glitches on de
fense. Stanford came away with
three wins for the weekend, which
further solidifies the team's No. 2
ranking going into the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation finals at
University of Pacific on April 10-
12.
In addition, two Stanford players,
Estes and Gardner, were named to
the All-Tournament team.
"We had good results," Tanner
said. "In difficult situations we made
intelligent decisions and played sim
ple. straightforward water polo."
