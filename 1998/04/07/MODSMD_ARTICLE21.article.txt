# Seniors cruise out of Stanford
## 
### Andre Salles-Cunha Contributing writer 
This year's Stanford men's
swimming team was one of the
most successful teams in the histo
ry of the NCAA, going undefeat
ed in dual meets and scoring the
second-most points ever at the
NCAA Championships. They are
still waiting for the competition
that Stanford head coach Skip
Kennev was warning them about
all year.
Two of the major reasons for
the teams success were the leader
ship of the seniors and the enthu
siasm of the freshmen. The se
niors had to wait for a while, hut
the freshmen are undefeated here

at Stanford.
The team was close this year,
and the seniors have had the
chance to he with each other for
four, veiys now. Xhev have been
through a lot as a team and they
have also done a lot as individuals.
"This was more like a family
than a team." Kennev said.
Tom Wilkens and Scott Clay
pool have been team captains and
roommates for two years. Togeth
er. they have led the team in and
out of the pool. Scott came in as
the fastest high school freestvler
in the country, signing early.
Upon acceptance, he immediately
sent letters to his future class
mates with a Stanford letterhead
that he had made himself. Clav

pool was second at NCAAs in the
50 free his freshman year, and he
constantly improved over his four
years. He worked to make himself
a better swinmur and w;is line of
the most focused people on the
team. He was the anchor for most
of Stanford's relays, and it he
went into a leg with the lead, you
knew that Stanford had the relax
won.
Wilkens w as a spring recruit
his major breakthrough in swim
ming came the summer after his
senior year of high school. There,
he earned Rookie of the Meet
honors at the summer nationals.
He had by this time alread\ cho
sen to attend Stanford over Har
vard. The Stanford swimmers

chanted his name in the finals of
the 4(H) IM. This was the first of
many times that Stanford swim
mers would have the opportunity
to cheer for 'WiJkejis in the 4<hi
IM He was in the NCAA finals all
four years in the IM events. Now
Wilkens and Claypool finall\
have an NCAA title to add to
their accomplishments.
"Our goal from the ver\ first
da\ of our Stanford swimming ca
reers was to win the NCAA title."
Wilkens said. "It took us until the
very last da\ to accomplish it.
That makes it that much more
special."
Chris Olson and Jed Crowe.

Senior Tom Wilkens is one in a class of Stanford seniors who saw their careers culminate in an NCAA Championship two weeks ago.
both out of Arizona, have roomed
together for the last three years.
"It's been great," Crowe said of
living with Olson. "He can bring
levity to any subject. He'll always
pep you up if you're feeling down."
Olson owns the record for the
most eggrolls eaten in a single sit
ting by any member of the Stanford
swim team. He was also the team's
representative on their trip to "The
Price Is Right," falling one unlucky
bid from advancing in the game
show.
The team's appearance on the
show caused its members to be sent
e-mail from all over the country.

This was due in large part to
Olson's incredible charm. So what
was it like on stage?
"I was looking at Bob's beauties
the whole time," Olson said.
Crowe will be a coterminal stu
dent in mechanical engineering
next year. As much time as he
spends with swimming and engi
neering, he still has time for other
things, like playing the guitar for
the past live years.
"Going into the meet, 1 wasn't
sure it was that big a deal," Crowe
said of the NCAAs. "Hut now that
it's happened it's one of those
things that, down the road, you can
say you were part of the team was
the best at a given time."
Sabir Muhammud had the meet
of his life at NCAAs. He spent

more time with the team this year
and had more fun than ever before.
He had lifetime bests over Ra
madan this year. Ramadan has
Sabir fasting right in the middle of
the swimming season. He elevated
his level of swimming through
focus.
"I was more focused spiritually
this year," Sabir said.
Muhammud has an awesome
sense of humor, and he has the abil
ity to know how to say what needs
to be said â€” and he'll say it in style.
He plans to join the ranks of
Kurt Grote and Pablo Morales,
who swam after their eligibility was
up and made the U.S. Olympic
team.
The seniors have gone out as
champions in more ways than one.
