# Seniors cruise out of Stanford
## 
### Andre Salles-Cunha Contributing writer 
This year's Stanford men's
swimming team was one of the
most successful teams in the histo
ry of the NCAA, going undefeat
ed in dual meets and scoring the
second-most points ever at the
NCAA Championships. They are
still waiting for the competition
that Stanford head coach Skip
Kennev was warning them about
all year.
Two of the major reasons for
the teams success were the leader
ship of the seniors and the enthu
siasm of the freshmen. The se
niors had to wait for a while, hut
the freshmen are undefeated here

at Stanford.
The team was close this year,
and the seniors have had the
chance to he with each other for
four, veiys now. Xhev have been
through a lot as a team and they
have also done a lot as individuals.
"This was more like a family
than a team." Kennev said.
Tom Wilkens and Scott Clay
pool have been team captains and
roommates for two years. Togeth
er. they have led the team in and
out of the pool. Scott came in as
the fastest high school freestvler
in the country, signing early.
Upon acceptance, he immediately
sent letters to his future class
mates with a Stanford letterhead
that he had made himself. Clav

pool was second at NCAAs in the
50 free his freshman year, and he
constantly improved over his four
years. He worked to make himself
a better swinmur and w;is line of
the most focused people on the
team. He was the anchor for most
of Stanford's relays, and it he
went into a leg with the lead, you
knew that Stanford had the relax
won.
Wilkens w as a spring recruit
his major breakthrough in swim
ming came the summer after his
senior year of high school. There,
he earned Rookie of the Meet
honors at the summer nationals.
He had by this time alread\ cho
sen to attend Stanford over Har
vard. The Stanford swimmers

chanted his name in the finals of
the 4(H) IM. This was the first of
many times that Stanford swim
mers would have the opportunity
to cheer for 'WiJkejis in the 4<hi
IM He was in the NCAA finals all
four years in the IM events. Now
Wilkens and Claypool finall\
have an NCAA title to add to
their accomplishments.
"Our goal from the ver\ first
da\ of our Stanford swimming ca
reers was to win the NCAA title."
Wilkens said. "It took us until the
very last da\ to accomplish it.
That makes it that much more
special."
