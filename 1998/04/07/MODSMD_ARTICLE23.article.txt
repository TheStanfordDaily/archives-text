## Gymnastics slips

The Cardinal's troubled men's
gymnastics season has finalK come
to a close tor all but one gymnast, se
nior co-captain Clarence Miao.

MEW'S GYMNASTICS
■ This weekend's result: Senior co
captain Clarence Miao qualifies for
NCAAs.

At Norman. Okla this weekend
for the NCAA Regional*, several
gymnasts performed well in individ
ual events, but only Nliao notched a
top-three finish in an event. He will
head to State College. Penn. for the
NCAA Championships April 16-18.
While ihe\ failed to place high
enough to quality for nationals, the
Card gymnasts felt that the season
ended on a high note. After ;i turbu
lent season plagued with injuries,
strong finishes by now-healthy gym
nasts were the most the Cardinal
could expect.
Freshman Jason Hilt/ tackled all
the events and — with especially
strong finishes on the still rings
(9.25-tied for 2()th). the floor
(9.35-tied for 24th) and the horizon
tal bars — deemed the
Regionals competition a positive ex
perience.
"It was the best meet of the year
for me. and 1 really feel as though I
ended on a gtxnl note." Bill/ said. "It

provided great motivation for next
year."
Another standout at the meet was
senior Gabe Edelman. Edelman fin
ished 22nd on the parallel bars, but
he saved his best performance for the
floor exercise, tor which he scored a
9.4 and tied for the 1 spot.
"1 missed qualifying tor nationals
on floor b\ .05. which i>> the equiva
lent of a small hop on a landing." said
Edelman. who has managed to re
main relatively injury-free through
out his four years on the team. "I was
a little upset about missing nationals
bv such a small margin, but I was also
slightly relieved to have this season
come to a close."
Stanford's star, however, was
Miao. who placed second on the
vault with an impressive 9.525. De
spite his strong finish, how ever. Miao
left (Oklahoma with mixed feelings.
it was really strange competing
as individuals." Miao said. "It was
the first time I had done that since my
high schml club program. I totally
forgot htm to compete without a
team. It was a lot less tun and a lot levs
intense."
Edelman echoed Miao's
thoughts, explaining that while indi
vidual competition was enjoyable,
there was something missing when
not competing as a team.
"Competing as individuals and
not as a team was very depressing."
Edelman said. "It was hard to get
psyched up and stay housed when
we were in the middle of all those
teams vying for spots to Nationals,
knowing that our own performances
didn't contribute to a team effort at
all."
In the team competition, Califor
nia took the top prize. BYU finished
second, and Oklahoma came in
third.
Miao. long a top competitor on
the Cardinal squad, is excited for
NCAAs but wished his teammates
were coming along.
"I really hoped that Gabe or Jere
my [Herman, senior co-captain]
would make it since it is their last year
and all." Miao said, "but I guess that
is the way things go."
While it has been a rough season
and the team failed to qualify for Re
gional for the first time in several
years, both coach Sadao Hamada
and the seniors have lofty expecta
tions for next season.
According to Edelman, Sadao
pulled the team aside after the com
petition and asked the gymnasts to
remember the depressing feeling of
not being in the race for a team cham
pionship.
"1 think that really hit home for
the younger guys on the team,"
Edelman said. "And 1 am sure that
they will use that feeling for moti
vation during every practice be
tween now and next year's compe
tition season."
Reflecting on the season as a
whole, Edelman decided that it was
valuable despite the hardships.
"The younger athletes on the
team learned a lot this season about
how to stay focused and how to be
strong competitors," Edelman said.
"This is the kind of thing that you
can't learn in the gym. and your
coach can't sit you down and explain
it to you. It takes hard experience,
like what we have been through this
year. They will be able to take what
they have learned during this very
demanding season and translate it
into some great performances in the
next few vears."
