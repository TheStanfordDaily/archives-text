MEW'S GYMNASTICS
■ This weekend's result: Senior co
captain Clarence Miao qualifies for
NCAAs.

At Norman. Okla this weekend
for the NCAA Regional*, several
gymnasts performed well in individ
ual events, but only Nliao notched a
top-three finish in an event. He will
head to State College. Penn. for the
NCAA Championships April 16-18.
While ihe\ failed to place high
enough to quality for nationals, the
Card gymnasts felt that the season
ended on a high note. After ;i turbu
