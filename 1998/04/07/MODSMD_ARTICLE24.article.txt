■ Today: No. 1 Stanford (27-5-1) vs.
Nevada (16-14) at Sunken Diamond,
3 p.m.

Today's game is almost certain
ly influenced by an issue of injured
Cardinal pride, for the highlight of
the unranked Wolfpack's (16-14)
mediocre season is the March 26,
13-5 defeat of the consenus No. 1
Cardinal.
In that midweek game, Nevada
senior ace Jim Brink elected to

take the mound and pitch against
Stanford. After scoring all of its
runs in the final three innings, the
Wolfpack emerged with the win.
Thankfully, Stanford won't be
facing Brink (6-2, 4.35 ERA), who
arguably has been the strongest
player for the Wolfpack this year.
Since the March game, howev
er, Nevada has struggled in the sea
son, losing 14-11 on March 30
against Cal State Northridge. The
Wolfpack then dropped two
against UC-Santa Barbara April 3-
4.
For Nevada, Stanford is just the
first hurdle. This weekend, the
Wolfpack travels to Cal State-
Fullerton for three games against
the No. 18 Titans.
Today, the Card will have to
look out for senior first baseman
Glen Carson, who is stinging op
posing pitchers with his .350 bat
ting average and team-high nine

homeruns.
Carson is a bit of a success story.
After batting an impressive .351 his
sophomore year, Carson had to sit
out last season because of an illness
— Chron's disease — that required
surgery. But this year, Carson's
skills haven't diminished, starting
29 games for the Wolfpack.
But the Cardinal is formidable
in its own right, and is flying high
after taking two games of a fiery se
ries at No. 2 USC.
After winning the opening game
Friday on a homerun by junior cen
terfielder Jody Gerut that broke a
scoreless tie in the seventh inning,
the Card split a doubleheader on
Sunday to take the series from the
Trojans.
After dealing with Nevada this
afternoon, the Cardinal will face
California in a Pacific 10 Confer
ence game on Thursday in Berke
ley at 2:30 p.m.
