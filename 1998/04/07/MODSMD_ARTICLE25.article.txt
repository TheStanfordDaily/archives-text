As a young girl, long before she
ever picked up a golf club, Hilary
Homeyer's father took her to see the
Arizona State Invitational Golf
Tournament. Walking his daughter
around the Karsten Golf Course, he
told Hilary that he would love to see
her play in the prestigious tourna
ment someday in the future.

■ This weekend's result: Stanford
finishes first at the Sun Devil Invita
tional.

That day came this weekend, and
Homeyer made Dad proud.
The Stanford freshman closed
the three-day event with an even-par
round of 72 and tied for the individ
ual title with a three-day total of 215.
Even more importantly, Homeyer's
teammates performed extremely
well, and the Cardinal took the team
crown with a total score of 872.
San Jose State finished second
with a total of 878, and Arizona took
third after posting a three-day sum
of 888.
"It was a real special tournament
for me and the team to win," I lome
ver said. "I had watched the event as
a kid with my dad, and it meant a lot
to make his vision come true."
It was also quite meaningful for
the Cardinal to post a total team ef
fort following a winter plagued by in
consistent performances.
"This was our best tournament
as a team since the fall," said sopho
more Julie Dunn. "We had some
good individual scores, but not
everyone was playing well at the
same time. [This weekend] we all
just clicked at the same time."
Her own game certainly clicked
— Dunn had her best outing as a col
legiate golfer, finishing in a tie for

fourth place at 2-over-par 2IS. Dunn
was especially hot in the second
round, shooting 69, including a3O on
the front side.
"This was my best tournament in
college by far," Dunn said. "I just
went out there, tried not to think too
much and just swung easy. It felt
great."
Cardinal sophomore Jae Jean Ro
also had a good week and posted a
three-day total of 222, good enough
to put her in a tie for l()th place. Ju
nior Stephanie Keever tied for 14th
at 224, and freshman Jessica Belskis
tied for 33rd.
" This team has always had the
talent to win," said Stanford head
coach Caroline O'Connor. "We saw
that the course set up well for us and
knew that if we played smart we
could win the tournament."
After the rain-soaked winter, the
Stanford golfers spent most of spring
break on the Farm getting their
games in shape for the upcoming
tournaments.
"Over the winter, our games
didn't go away," Homeyer said. "We
just didn't let them come through. So
it was good to all bounce back and
gain some momentum."
The win could not have come for
a better time for the Cardinal as it
approaches the postseason.
"1 think this tournament will
give us a great deal of confidence
going into postseason plav,"
O'Connor said. "We proved to
ourselves that not only do we have
great ability but that we can win
away from home."
Several members of the Stanford
team also felt like the win in Arizona
made a statement to the rest of the
country.
"We let all the other teams in the
country know we are right there to
win the national title," Keever said.
"We proved that if everyone plays
well, we are better than anyone."
