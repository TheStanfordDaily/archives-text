### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
Rather than go back to the
drawing board after its first loss
of the season, the top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team
will jump into perhaps its tough
est stretch of the season, with live
conference dual matches in 12
days.

WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Today: No. I Stanford (18-1, 6-1
Pacific 10 Conference) vs. No.BCal
ifornia (13-4, 5-1) at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium, i:30 p.m.

That stretch begins this after
noon as the Cardinal clashes with
archrival No. 8 California at the
Taube Family Tennis Stadium at
1:30 p.m.
By dropping a road match to
No. 14 UCLA 5-4 last Friday, the
Cardinal (18-1, 6-1 Pacific 10
Conference) lost its first match in
38 attempts, but then regrouped
to the tune of a 6-0 whitewash of
USC on Sunday.
Stanford and Cal last met in
February in Berkeley in the con
ference opener for both teams.
The Cardinal escaped with a 5-4
victory. Stanford has now played
four matches which have ended 5-
4, emerging victorious in three of
them.
"We learn a lot more from a 5-
4 loss than to win another tight
match," Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan said. "Maybe
that's what we need — a little
healthy paranoia."
Brennan commented also on
how well the Cardinal rebounded
from the loss against USC.
"I thought we turned it around
nicelv." Brennan said. "We sort

of made a statement there. Hut
we had a good meeting alter
UCLA. It was a pretty had per
formanee; we were just flat.
UCLA was OK. hut they didn't
play great, ihey were as sur
prised as we were alter the match.
But the girls admitted that they
didn't get up for the match as
much as they should have.''
The loss to the Bruins (11-7. 5
2) may provide a necessary wake
up call lor the Cardinal, who fin
ish up the conference and dual
match schedule in the next two
weeks. After today's match with
the Bears, Stanford heads to the
desert for meetings with Arizona
and Arizona State. The Sun Dev
ils also pushed the Cardinal to the
edge when they played the Cardi
nal tough in a 5-4 Stanford win in
earlv March.

"We are not the overwhelming
powerhouse we were last year.
Brennan said. "112 ;il is going to be
lough, and ANU has their best
li'Mm in veilr*.

We learn a lot more from
a 5-4 loss than to win an
other tight match. Maybe
that's what we need.'
