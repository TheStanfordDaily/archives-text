### Jessica Lan Contributing writer 
It's the best tennis team in the
nation, and no one has been able
to stop it.
But here come the Weenies.
At present. Pacific 10 Confer

ence rival California looks to be
one of the only teams that might
make a dent in Stanford's perfect
record. Stanford's top-ranked
men's tennis team takes 011 the
Bears today in Berkeley at 1:30
p.m.
Stanford (IK-0, 7-0 Pac-10 Con

ference) and Cal (13-2. ft-1), at
first and second place, respective
ly. in the Pac-10, met earlier this
season. Stanford emerged as the
winner.

MEN'S TENUIS
■ Saturday: No. 1 Stanford (18-0,7-0
Pacific 10 Conference) at California
(13-2.6-1), 1:30 p.m.

The Cardinal had very little
trouble with the Bears, losing only
one set at the No. 6 singles spot.
Freshman Alex Kim battled
through three sets against Cal's
Nathan Jackmon, who plays in the
second singles spot.
However, the Bears just came
off victories against both I ISC and
UCLA, marking the first time they
have defeated both of the Los An
geles teams in the last 25 years.
Senior Jackmon and junior
Bobby Mahal, ranked No. 91, have
led the Bears to an impressive w in
ning season in one of the toughest
tennis conferences in the country.
With a 13-2 record, and at 6-1 in
the Pac 10, the Bears look strong
going into today's match.
Although the Bears have had
success this season, with the
team's only losses handed down by
Stanford and Fresno State. Cal's
record doesn't come close to
matching up with Stanford's.
Cal has had some close matches
with Pac-10 opponents Arizona
State and UCLA at 4-3. and has
not had a clean dual-match win
since mid-February against un
ranked Utah.
Si) far this season, the Cardinal

has not only defeated its competi
tion. it has blown most teams
away.
Even against the toughest
teams. Stanford has not lost more
than one point in any dual match
this season, earning its No. 1 rank
ing.
Having won 101 singles match
es and lost only one with a variety
of lineups, Stanford's singles
spread is solid from top to bottom.
All the Card's starting six players
are ranked in the top 70 in the na
tion. including sophomores Mike
Bryan at No. 10 and twin Bob
Bryan at No. 11.

Cal beat both teams, just
like we did, and they'll be
riding high on those wins.
I think it will be a tough
and competitive match.'
— Dick Gould

Stanford still has momentum
from its victories this weekend
against USC and UCLA. Head
coach Dick Gould said he antici
pates a challenge from Cal's
squad.
"Cal heat both teams, just like
we did. and they'll be riding high
on those wins," Gould said. "1
think it will be a very tough and
competitive match."
The match will be played at
Cal's Hellman Tennis Center at
1:3() p.m. today.
