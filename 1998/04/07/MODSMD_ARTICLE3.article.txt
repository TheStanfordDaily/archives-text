# Ballot may include new amendment
## 
### James Pritchard Contributing writer 
With the ASSU Spring General
Election just over ;t week away,
some last-minute changes are still
being considered for the ballot.
In an attempt to make ASSU
senators more accountable to their
constituencies, a constitutional
amendment has been prepared that
would place senators in districts.
The amendment, authored b\
ASSU President Emily Andrus and
junior Patrick Bernhardt, will go
before the senate for review tonight
and for vote next Tuesday. If the
bill passes through the senate, the
amendment will appear on the bal
lot for the runoff election expected
to take place in two weeks between
the top two presidential candidates.
If approved by the student body,
the changes to the senate would
take effect in the fall of l l )W. T he

amendment shifts senator elections
to the fall of the elected term rather
than the previous spring.
This change would enable sena
tors to be elected through districts
The undergraduate student bods
would be divided geographically
into 15 districts of approximately
equal si/e. Each district would elect
one senator, voted on solek by
members of that district.
The graduate student bod\ is al
ready districted by school or de
partment.
"We want people to vote for the
senator to represent them." Andrus
said. "This will enable students to
make more informed choices about
who they are voting for."
The Office of the ASSI' Presi
dent would create a districting com
mittee to ensure fair and equal dis
tricts. Andrus said.
While the fall election would
allow for freshman senators, it

would also give students more say
in the senate. The amendment insti
tutes the right of the members of a
district to recall their senator ll they
feel he or she is not adequately rep
resenting them.
Following the election, an
ASSI committee would assign sen
ators to various student groups in
addition to their assigned resi
dences.
Since the senate elections are al
ready in place for next week, the
changes brought b\ the amend
ment w ill not take effect next year.
However, a second bill, facing a
senate vote tonight, addresses the
status ot next year's senate.
The bill, completed b\ Andrus
and ASSI Senator Santos Marro
quin last night, will institute a simi
lar setup for next year's senate
term, with a committee assigning


Andrus
