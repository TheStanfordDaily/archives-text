Maren Norton
and Santos Mar
roquin emphasize
the strengthening
of student voice

through concrete action in their
campaign for ASSIJ president and
vice president.
II elected, Norton and Marro
quin. both juniors, plan to make
elected officials more accountable
and accessible to the undergradu
ate and graduate student bodies.
Their campaign platform focuses
on the three major issues of recti
fying student housing problems,
improving transportation services
and reforming the ASSU's gov
ernmental structure.

Juniors Maren Norton and Santos Marroquin, ASSU presidential and vice-presidential candidates,
hope to make the ASSU more accountable to students and their concerns. In addition, they would like
to address transportation and housing concerns.
as well as substantial interaction
with the general student body
through many activities at Stan
ford. Each currently serves as an
ASSU senator.
A senator for the past two terms,
Norton has chaired both the Bud
get and Finance Committee as well
as the Appropriations Committee
of the ASSU Senate. Outside of
student government, Norton has
presided over three different house
governments as well as participated
in other student groups such as the
Stanford Jazz Orchestra.
Marroquin, a senator this term,
chairs the Student Affairs Commit
tee lhis year, and currently serves
as the co-editor in chief of the Stan
ford Chaparral.
The two hope to make the reso
lution of current student housing
problems a foundation for increas
ing student voice in both ASSU and
administration decisions.
"We hope to make the ASSU a
body of student advocacy," Norton
said.
Specific goals include the estab
lishment of the Graduate Student
Housing Network to ease graduate
housing troubles while they wait
for more on-campus housing to be
built. I'hey will also work for more
student voice in Residential Educa
tion decisions.
Marroquin has taken an active
role in protesting the extensive
changes in student housing an
nounced by the Office of Residen
tial Education last quarter.
" The Res Ed issue is a start,"

Marroquin said. "Once students
see that they can make a difference,
then maybe they can go on to voic
ing other concerns important to
them."
Norton and Marroquin hope to
ameliorate transportation prob
lems by expanding Marguerite ser
vice to Menlo Park for students
who need to buy groceries at Safe
way. Also, they feel parking prob
lems could be eliminated by shut
tling students and staff from new
parking structures off campus.
To reform the ASSU, the slate
seeks to create structure and ac
countability. They plan to make the
Office of the President more effi
cient by delegating projects to spe
cific people.
In response to complaints that
the senate does not properly repre
sent the general student body, Nor
ton and Marroquin will assign each
senator to a specific residence or
student group. Members of these
groups will then have a direct con
tact in the ASSU through whom to
voice any thoughts or concerns.
"We want to bring legitimacy to
the ASSU," Marroquin said. "We
want people to trust the ASSU."
Norton and Marroquin feel that
they bring with them a unique pas
sion for positive change in the Stan
lord community, coupled with a
history of hard work and dedica
tion to student issues.
"All people make up the
ASSU," Norton said. "It is their di
versity which makes Stanford such
a great institution."
"I would give everything — my
heart and soul — to the student
body," Norton said. "I believe so
strongly in student issues."
