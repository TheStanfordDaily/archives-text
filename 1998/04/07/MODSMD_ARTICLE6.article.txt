## Matter of privacy 
### Jason Engleman Contributing writer 
Most Stanford students arc un
aware of a I'niversity policy ol re
leasing students grades to resident
fellows and Row office officials
Although the policy is mentioned
in the Stanfoid Bulletin, main stu
dents don't reah/e that people other
than then adxiser have access to then
grades. According to the bulletin.
Rl s arc considered "schiKil officials
with legitimate educational inter
ests" in a student's academic
progress, allowing for an exception to
pmao rules
Officials from the ()ffiec of Resi
dential 1 ducation could not be
reached for comment, but Rl s s.i\
such a polio is really in the student's
best interest. "'Sometimes siudents
are having personal difficulties that
result in |xhh grades, said Potter Rl
Martha Beinin

\n\ problems that a student is
having are handled "caretull\ in pri
vate. she added In extreme cases.
Beinin refers students fo "appropri
ate professionals on campus "
\nother reason for Rl > in
volvement is that often, according to
Beinin. "academic advisers are not
involved." making it important for
someone else to ii>ok out for stu
dents
I nlike some residences, the Pot
ter Kl v announce to siudents at the
beginning ol the sear that they will be
monitoring their grades Beinin said.
But students often don't know
such .1 polio exists I lie worst thing
about it. s.nd coterminal student
Sonimer Gentry, "is people aren't
aware of it.
After she complained. Gentry's
Kimball Rl told hci he would no
longei view hci grades. Still as far as
she knows, he still technically could
have access to them.
"An RF is a housing official, not
an academic one." Gentry said.
"Students who live off campus don 't
have RFs. and their grades don't go
to any parallel official."
I'he issue of privacy concerning
students' grades extends far beyond
the bounds of Stanford. According
to the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act of N74. govern
ment funding can be withheld to in
stitutions that have a "policy or prac
tice of permitting the release of edu
cational records... without the writ
ten consent of their parents to any
individual, agency or organization."
Many students — under the im
pression that grades remain strictly
confidential between a student and
his or her adviser —were shocked to
discover that other eyes were view
ing their grades.
"Grades are very personal and to
release it to someone else is wrong."
said senior Tony Lin.
Others disagreed. "I can see the
good of someone being able to
counsel a student." said senior Na
talie DuMont.
