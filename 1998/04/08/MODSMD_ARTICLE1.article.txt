# Sororities on track to fill houses
## 
### Bill Bowen Contributing writer 
Alter rushing to open houses and
socials all this week, 2(X) prospective
sorority members can finally relax.
Yesterday morning, the Intersorori
ty Council gave bids to approximate
ly 70 percent of students who partic
ipated in this year's sorority Rush.
Members of the Delta Delta
Delta sorority and the Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority were particularly en
couraged by the strong turnout for

Rush this year since they were re
quired to recruit enough members to
fill their houses next year. The Tri-
Delts must house 55 members; the
Thetas have to house 50.
Theta President Sarah McDon
ald. a junior, said, "We're very excit
ed about our house next year. We're
not worried about filling the house at
all."
The Tri-Delts expressed similar
enthusiasm at their probability of
having housing next year. Inter
sororitv Council President Alice

Prager, a Tri-Delt, said, "I don't
forsee any problems. We're really
pleased for all the groups."
Organizers attribute the high
turnout to Sorority Rush this year to
efficient and flexible organization.
Greek organizations publicized
Rush this year by publishing a Rush
prospectus with statements by each
of the sororities and fraternities
about their activities and purpose.
Fraternity Rush continues
through next week.
Sororitv Rush chair Andrea Paz,

a senior, said. "We put out the Rush
prospectus to show students that its
great to be part of the (ireek system.
1 think it hit a lot of people because
they realized there wasn't a specific
stereotype to belong to the Greek
community."
Sorority Rush was done on cam
pus this year rather than in Palo
Alto, where it has been held in pre
vious years. Paz explained the Inter
sororitv Council moved Rush be
cause "it made it a lot easier to ac
commodate all women. We're trying
to get women with a wide variety of
interests to join sororities, so we
went out of our way to make sure
women with a wide variety of ex
tracurricular activities could be ac
commodated."
Rushing students were also as
sisted bv Rush counselors who tem
porarily ended their affiliation with
their sororities in order to help
guide students through the process
and answer any questions or con
cerns. "All these women spent
hours and hours training and role
playing with students," Paz said.
"We wanted to make sure that
[rushing] women had the best infor
mation possible."
Students going throuuh the Rush

process described it as enjoyable but
tiring. Freshman Marje Soova, who
received a Tri-Delt bid. said, "I real
ly enjoyed meeting new people,
even though it was tiring for both the
girls who rushed and the girls who
planned it."
Not all students have had positive
experiences with Sorority Rush.
Sororities were originally denied
housing in the 1440s largely due to
increasing tension and depression
caused by the competitive selection
process.
Many students feel the Sorority
Rush system places too much em
phasis on superficial social interac
tion and judgment.
Paz said sororities are attempting
to overcome this image in the Rush
process this year. "We're going
through efforts to shake sororities'
old image and to create a wonderful,
wonderful experience for all women
who rush." she said.
