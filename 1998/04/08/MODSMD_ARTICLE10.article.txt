## Clinton opens Social Security dialogue

KANSAS CIl V. Mo. (AP)
President Clinton opened wh;it
promises to he a years-long
national dialogue on the future of
Social Security by saying that it
would take only relatively small
changes — and not a drastic over
haul — to guarantee the program
for millions of baby boomers.
"We should not abandon a
basic program that has heen one of
the great successes in our nation's
history," he said.
Clinton told more than 700
Midwesterners from all walks of
life at a town meeting yesterday
that with the federal government
now operating in the black,
reforms are achievable without
increasing the payroll tax paid by
almost all workers and their
employers.
"Most of us are committed to
trying to find a way to solve the
problem without increases in the
payroll taxes." the president said.
The meeting in a college gym
nasium kicked off the national dis
cussion that Clinton called for in
his State of the Union address in
January.
With the aging of the hab\
boomers threatening the retire
ment program, the president has
asked Congress not to touch the
country's first budget surpluses in
30 years without first agreeing to
change that will ensure the solven
cy of the Social Securitv system.

He was more specific here. He
said that Si(X) billion ol the surplus
could add at least a year to Social
Security's financial stability, "with
no other changes being made."
Hut virtually every speaker at
the forum agreed that with no
other action taken. Social Security
is likely to run short of cash by
2029.
And many agreed that some
limited amount of "privatization"
with individuals investing a por
tion of their payroll taxes privately
— lay in the future.
House Speaker Newt (iingrich
last week endorsed an experimen
tal approach that would start such
private accounts this year, without
touching Social Security. b\ using
government surpluses resulting
from the balanced-budget deal.
The Clinton administration has
raised concerns about "privatiza
tion.' however, saving Social
Security's future could be ensured
with less radical changes, such as
adjusting tax rates and benefit lev
els and raising the retirement age.
Founded in 1935 as a ke\ part
ol Franklin 1). Roosevelt's New
Deal. Social Security now pays
benefits to 44 million Americans,
including retirees, the disabled and
the families of working-aged peo
ple who die. But without changes,
predictions are that the program
will be overwhelmed bv 77 million
aging bab\ boomers.
