Flynt faces court sequel
CINCINNATI (AP) — Hustler magazine publisher Larry
Flynt was indicted yesterday on obscenity and other counts in
the city where he was convicted of the same charge in 1977 for
distributing his magazine.
Flynt and brother Jimmy both were charged with nine
counts of pandering obscenity, three counts of disseminating
matter harmful to juveniles, two counts of conspiracy to
engage in a pattern of corrupt activity and one count of engag
ing in a pattern of corrupt activity. Hamilton County Prosecu
tor Joseph Deters said in a news conference.
The charges cite videos sold in Flvnt's downtown store, not
the magazine itself.
Deters said the Flynts are charged with selling an obscene
videotape to a 14-year-old boy, and accused of a pattern of
selling materials Deters said are obscene in Ohio.
Flynt's 1977 conviction was thrown out on appeal and he
was never retried. He opened a the store in October, challeng
ing law enforcement authorities by selling Hustler, adult
videos, sex toys and mainstream publications at the store.
He has repeatedly told reporters in recent months that he
wanted a trial on obscenity charges, because he believes that a
jury today would find that Hustler does not violate communi
ty obscenity standards.
Being cleared in such a trial would make it easier for him to
persuade other Cincinnati retailers to sell Hustler, he said.
Deters said he did not know when a trial would occur.
The maximum penalty, if the brothers were convicted of all
charges, would be 24 years in prison. The charges also are pun
ishable by probation.
Cohen sees 'don't ask, don't tell" problems
WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary William
Cohen acknowledged yesterday "some commanders haven't
gotten the message" about the Clinton administration's policy
barring the pursuit and harassment of homosexuals in the mil
itary. He ordered new guidelines to explain and enforce it.
"I have tried to make it very clear that we want this policy
fully and fairly implemented. That means there's to be no pur
suit, there's to be no harassment, and if it's taking place, its
something I'm very concerned about," Cohen said in an inter
view on National Public Radio.
The "don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue" policy was initiat
ed in 1994 amid great controversy, attempting to strike a bal

ance between prohibited homosexual conduct in the military
and attempts to maintain the privacy of those who choose not
to declare their sexual orientation.
Meanwhile, the Department of Defense released a report
showing that the number of people discharged for homosexu
ality climbed from 850 in 1996 to 997 last year. The lowest
number discharged was 617 in 1994. while the highest in recent
years numbered 1.998 in 1952. the report said. The high num
ber amounted to 0.095 percent of the total force.
The report also said that SO percent of those discharged for
homosexuality in 1997 had made a statement that they were
homosexual.
Clinton administration advocates test ban
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Clinton administration
urged the Senate to ratify a treaty banning all nuclear weapons
tests by the fall or risk losing a role in trying to prod India, Pak
istan and North Korea into signing the accord.
I'he pitch by senior administration officials yesterday was
aimed at Sen. Jesse Helms. R-N.C. the chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, who has declined to hold hear
ings.
Declaring the United States can rely on simulated tests lor
the American nuclear program. Undersecretary of State John
Holum said the Senate has "a historic opportunity" to make it
harder for non-nuclear nations to develop the weapons.
"Without testing, it's an insurmountable barrier." Holum
told reporters as the State Department marked the 10th
anniversary of a direct link between Washington and Moscow
to alert each other to missile tests or other provocative moves
that could jangle nuclear nerves.
Filipinos request war memorial bells
WASHINGTON (AP) — Two church bells taken from the
Philippines to Wyoming a century ago by marauding Ameri
can soldiers are still tolling a tale of bitterness over one of the
U.S. military's most brutal campaigns.
Filipinos want the bells back. Veterans groups and
Wyoming's members of Congress say they must stay as part of
a war memorial. When Philippine President Fidel Ramos
meets with President Clinton on Friday, they will try to find a
compromise on the bells, possibly letting each country keep
one and a duplicate.
It could be tounh.
