# College salaries up 3.4 percent

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —College fac
ulty salaries rose 3.4 percent this year,
with full professors at research universi
ties now making just under $80.(X)<), a
study released yesterday showed.
With inflation running at just half that
rate, it was the largest increase in faculty
pay in a decade, said the American Asso
ciation of University Professors.
But professors still lag far behind
other professionals when it comes to
salary, and their pay, when adjusted for
inflation, is actually 4.4 percent lower
today than it was in 1971-72. the AAUP
said.
The findings are based on an associa
tion survey of 1.839 colleges and universi
ties in 1997-98.

College and university faculty earned
42 percent less than other professionals
with similar levels of education, the study
said. That comparison was based on fed
eral earnings data for workers with at
least 18 years of education.
For example, the lowest-paid engi
neers and lawyers earned roughly $B,(KH)
more than the lowest-paid professors in
1996. the study said. By contrast, the
highest-paid engineers and lawyers
earned about more than the high
est-paid professors.
Jacqueline King of the American
Council on Education, a group represent
ing university presidents, acknowledged
that professors haven't made any real
salarv gains since the 19705, but said

schools arc also under tremendous pres
sure to keep tuition down.
"On one hand — the faculty, they
work hard, they're prepared with .1 lot of
education for their jobs — this is not a lot
of money." she said.
"At the same time ... institutions
have to do all they can to keep their costs
down, and one of their biggest costs is
salaries," she said. "Institutions are under
a lot of competing pressures."
The average salary for full professors
at research universities — those with doc
toral programs — was $7^.346.
The study also found increasing dis
parities among faculty at different types
of colleges, although it said the gap was
not as great as in many professions.
