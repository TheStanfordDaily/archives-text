Dance program's goals are
consistent with commit
ment to practical education

DUE TO THE rising populari
ty of Dance Division classes
during the past decade, the
administration must increase its sup
port of the Dance Division through
the addition of more space, more
resources and more instructors.
Since 1911. the Dance Division has
positioned itself as a venue to help stu
dents "develop a cultivated mind, a
trained body and a passionate engage
ment through movement experience."
In doing so, the Dance Division has
played an important role in fulfilling
the University's founding grant "to
qualify students for personal success
and direct usefulness in life.'''
Until recently, the administration
has viewed the Dance Division as a
physical education venue. However,
with the recent addition of the Dance
Division to the Drama Department,
the University has demonstrated its
growing understanding of the impor
tance of dance in terms of education.
In the last six years, the perception
of the Dance Division has undergone a
renaissance of sorts. Now, dance is
being recognized as combining physi
cal, mental and spiritual aspects to pro
vide a holistic education.
In addition, the Dance Division
serves over 2,(XX) students a year. The
staff consists of three full-time instruc
tors, two part-time instructors, four
guest lecturers and a total budget that
would barely pay the salaries of two

Silicon Valley software engineers.
The value of the education that the
program provides far exceeds that of
many Internet companies formed in
the area today. But the University has
all but strapped the Dance Division by
providing a small budget and limited
facilities. This quarter, dance classes
were in such demand that students
lined up at Roble Gym beginning at 6
a.m. last Monday to try to register for
classes like Social Dance I. Less than
half of the students were able to sub
scribe to the courses.
The administration needs to
increase the budget of the Dance Divi
sion so that it can better meet demand.
The division has an efficiency rating
higher than most academic programs
in terms of dollars spent per student
and would benefit from an increased
budget.
To house these courses, the Univer
sity should strongly consider long and
short-term measures. In the short run,
dance classes could be held in venues
currently unavailable to the Dance
Division such as the Elliot Program
Center or the Rains Hacienda Com
mons. In the long run, the University
should develope more dance space to
house not only increased dance offer
ings, but also many of the student
groups that vie competitively for the
limited space available.
In an increasingly technological and
competitive world, where opportuni
ties for acquiring "people" skills are
declining, dance presents a rare forum
for the discovery, learning and rein
forcement of such skills. The Universi
ty should just consider the potential
return on such an investment.
