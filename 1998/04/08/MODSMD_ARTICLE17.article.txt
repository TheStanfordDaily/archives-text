## Paying the bill for buzzwords 
### 
THE celebration of
Founders 1 Day last
weekend really
inspired me to reflect
upon my own Stanford
experience. NOT!
Actually, 1 didn!t even
know Founders' Day
existed. We never had that

when I was a freshman, but then again, we
also had Pro Fro Week and no F's back
then.
Do Stanford students really benefit from
events like Founders' Day? No matter how
much alumni contributions increase, our
tuition will never decrease! So why are we
willing to pay so much to attend this univer
sity?
Most of us agree that Stanford's efforts
to increase alumni contributions fully justi
fied last year's establishment of this classic
commemorative event. What else brings
Stanford affiliates of all shapes and sizes
together for a day of reflection and festive
feasting on free food? Plus, there are
serendipitous secondary side effects. For
instance, Stanford could climb a notch in
the good old U.S. News and World Report
university rankings. We all know that's the
most reliable standard for measuring the
true value of a college education.
Some say it is worth paying so much
because a university's name, reputation and
ranking will determine our future salaries.
Think again, thee who believe thy hundred

grand investment will return hundred-fold
upon graduation. The wealthiest people
who attend top universities like Stanford or
middle-tier universities like Harvard never
even make it to their sophomore years! The
most successful attendees of these two
Woods and Bill Gates, left
after freshman year. Having a sophomore
slump? Forget about it! Stop out!
Meanwhile, the rest of us seek innova
tive ways for our Stanford experiences to
distance us from run-of-the-mill proles. We
turn basic activities — like snagging books
from upper floors of the Bookstore at
cheaper prices than in the basement — into
opportunities to refine our analytical and
quantitative abilities. When we apply these
finely tuned skills to our classes, we see
what no ordinary plebe sees. We discover
that the almighty graphs of economics
reveal certain unmistakable truths. For
example, minimum wage adds to unem
ployment and taxing the rich is bad for all of
us!
A recurring problem at Stanford is our
tendency to mistakenly apply our knowl
edge outside our fields of study. The Uni
versity's strict categorization of knowledge
into departments and other subdivisions
must not be taken lightly. For example,
"venture capital" belongs to finance,
"mitotic catastrophe" belongs to biology
and "Java" belongs to computer science.
What could go wrong if we were to confuse
these variables and globalize them into our

world view?
Imagine the statement, "The latest
reports indicate the Java market has gone
sour. People are just pursuing other alterna
tives." How would you react if you were a
software analyst? What about the owner of
a small coffee house? What about a banker
in Indonesia?
Nowadays, vocabulary needs to be field
specific. "Special Economic Jewel," for
example, implies Silicon Valley and Cyber
jaya to economists, and sapphires and dia
monds to jewelers. Serious complications
arise when two unrelated fields are dis
cussed together. Take economics and bal
looning. Imagine an article on "hyperinfla
tion wreaking havoc in the balloon indus
try." Just picture the disastrous potential of
someone applying a concept as discipline
specific as "statistical discrepancy" outside
the economics realm. We'd have to correct
every number to account for possible errors
in calculation. Otherwise, we'd have history
books that read, "In 1456 Columbus sailed
the ocean blue," biology texts with " The
human being has three ears," and music
critics reviewing bands like "UB38" and "5
Live Crew."
We have to be extremely careful when
we use our hard-earned buzzwords if we
hope to succeed in achieving more than a
mere phyrric victory with our education.
