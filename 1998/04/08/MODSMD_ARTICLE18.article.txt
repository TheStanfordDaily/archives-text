AIDS risks overstated
As a Stanford regional alumni club presi
dent, I read the entire April 2 issue of The
Daily. However, I was alarmed by the con
tent of the "Free Sexx" column entitled
"Getting Tested," which overstated risks to
heterosexual non-drug users and left out
some effective methods for those in low-risk
groups to further reduce their risks.
Worrying about an AIDS test should not
keep most college students from focusing on
more pressing sexual health issues. Congrat
ulations for pointing out that HIV transmis
sion through kissing has never been medical
ly recorded, but this is also true of oral sex of
all permutations. It is probably also true for
female-to-male sexual transmission, assum
ing the man lacks genital sores or injury.
Studies show that it takes about 500-I,(XX)
acts of unprotected sex with an infected man
(or men) for a woman to become infected.
This explains high AIDS rates among
women in cities with large IV-drug-using
populations and the virtual absence of AIDS
among non IV-drug-using women.
On a college campus where IV drug use is
probably unheard of and women don't sleep
with a man until they know him well enough

to have an idea of whether he is a junkie or
not, the chance of finding even one HlV
positive heterosexual man is remote. With
pregnancy and other STDs rampant on cam
puses, wise college women will insist their
partners use condoms, hut AIDS fears
should he far down on the list of reasons.
For healthy men, the chance of HIV
transmission by vaginal sex with an infected
woman is unheard of — not to mention the
minuscule odds of finding even one infected
woman on a prestigious college campus. Of
course, female-to-male transmission does
occur in Third World countries where ulcer
ative STDs are the norm among men and
women. A man's genital sore can he an inlet
for the high level of HIV typically found in
the vaginal fluid of a woman with an open
genital sore. However, if an HIV-positive
woman has no open genital sores, her vagi
nal fluid is far more benign.
A man's best defense, in addition to con
dom use for prevention of pregnancy and
transmission of other STDs, is to ensure that
he does not have genital sores or injuries that
would allow HIV to enter his bloodstream.
Another important piece of omitted
advice regards heterosexual anal sex, which
may be hundreds of times more effective at
transmitting HIV from a man to a woman
than vaginal sex. The practice is not uncom

mon among college-age women and men,
who may not use condoms because of
reduced pregnancy risk. Some scientists
believe that anal sex accounts for a majority
or all cases of male-to-female HIV transmis
sion. Women who experiment with this prac
tice should always insist on condom use.
Diligent condom use is reported to
reduce transmission odds by a factor of 10.
Good, but not good enough. The odds can
be reduced much more by knowing your
partner's history well
Most college students should be con
cerned less about AIDS and more about
conventional STDs such as chlamydia, geni
tal warts and herpes, which can be transmit
ted without apparent sores.

University is working
on graduate housing
Amid the hue and cry about on-campus
graduate housing, few have bothered to
look at the big picture. Here are some basic
facts that should not be forgotten:
1) The crisis in on-campus housing is not
of the University's making. It is the sky

rocketing cost of off-campus housing that is
driving people to the less expensive options
on campus.
2) The University has been extremely
responsive to external conditions. Over the
past 11 years, three new graduate student
residence complexes have been built. We
now house a far higher percentage of our
graduate population on campus than any of
our major competitors.
3) Planning is under way for the con
struction of additional graduate housing.
This is an involved process, requiring exten
sive consultation within the University and
with surrounding communities and govern
ment agencies. Hence, it takes a few years
to put up new residences.
4) In the interim, a number of steps are
being taken to mitigate the problem. These
include:
— An increase in fellowship stipends,
teaching assistant salaries, and resident
assistant salaries that is substantially higher
than the increases in other areas of the Uni
versity's budget.
— A loan fund to help students cover
security deposits and first/last month rent
requirements in off-campus housing.
— An emergency grant fund to help stu
dents with short-term financial crises
brought about by housing-related prob

lems.
— Modification of the system of priori
ties for access to on-campus housing to
increase fairness and to coordinate these
policies with academic objectives.
— Reconfiguration of the existing on
campus housing stock to allow more stu
dents to live on campus.
— Revision of the rent structure to cre
ate some lower-cost options on campus.
The University is making a serious effort
to address an extremely serious problem.
Constructive suggestions from graduate
students are always taken seriously. Indeed,
some of the steps described above were first
proposed by students. On the other hand,
attacks on the motives or character of indi
vidual administrators are neither warranted
nor productive.
