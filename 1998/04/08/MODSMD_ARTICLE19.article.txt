# From the fourth dimension
## A 						hygiene booster or a tool of oppression? 
### 
Kerry Rodgers

I WAS SOAKING in the tub one
evening when my sweetie offered to
read to me for entertainment. He stole
two books off his housemate's coffee table
for me to choose from: "Why Cats Paint" or
"The Encyclopedia of Bad Taste."
I choose the latter, intrigued by the title's
presumptuousness. The authors were pic
tured on the back cover among their kitsch
Americana interior. This proved they were
firsthand experts on the subject matter.
My partner perused the table of eon
tents, which sounded like a list of pop cul
ture relics from previous decades: bell bot
toms, elevator shoes, macrame, roller
derby, white lipstick and feminine hygiene
spray.
"Feminine hygiene spray?" I sputtered,
splashing bubbles in my astonishment.
"What the hell is that? Read that one," I
begged.
According to authors Jane and Michael
Stern, the product was developed in 1966
thanks to lluorocarbon aerosol technology,
and the enlightened "60s "why-wash-it
when-you-can-spray-it" ethic.
The hilarity of it — basically it's cheap
perfume for your putinany — had me in

stitches. "Those naive, repressed mid-'6()s
kids," I laughed. "It's definitely a product
from before the sexual revolution. Any
thing that smells like an artificial bouquet
can't taste too good. Thank God the times
have a-changed."
"Not so fast," my compadre warned me.
"I think the stuff still exists."
I refused to believe it. It sounded like an
outdated, oppressive product in the tradi
tion of corsets and curlers. It had to be dead
like the dinosaurs. Nobody would buy such
a thing in the '90s, would they?
I embarked to discover the truth on my
own.
Feeling like an investigative journalist, I
armed myself with a notebook and made
my way to the local drugstore. Sure enough,
alongside douche solutions, yeast infection
treatments and lubricants were little unas
suming bottles in pastel colors labeled FDS
— feminine deodorant spray.
According to the bad taste experts,
somewhere along the line the Federal Drug
Administration required the word
"hygiene" be removed from the product
title so consumers would not be misled into
thinking it had anything to do with cleanli

ness or health.
However, I guess one bad idea led to
another, because to my surprise I noticed an
even more bizarre item at the drugstore. On
the same shelf as the spray were little boxes
containing "feminine deodorant supposito
ries" to keep them flowers fresh till morn
ing.
Thankfully, the advertising for these
products is slightly less offensive than it has
been in the past.
Back in their heyday, manufacturers
advertised the spray as "essential to your
cleanliness and your peace of mind about
being a girl — an attractive, nice-to-be-with
girl."
I guess feminism hasn't gone entirely
unheeded by the free market, and the cur
rent labels simply read. "Use daily to feel
clean and fresh."
I still couldn't imagine what kind of per
son would buy this stuff. It obviously sells in
droves, since three separate drug stores
were all well-stocked with the varying for
mulas.
I imagine the typical consumer is the
type who spravs air fresheners in the bath
room every morning instead of opening the

windows, and has one of those smelly card
board trees hanging from her rearview mir
ror.
She probably buys into our culture's
implicit hierarchy of scents: anything that
smells alive is at the bottom of the totem
pole, and synthetic floral fragrances are at
the top.
Old-fashioned bubble bath just isn't
good enough for her. She feels it is worth
the warning label's risks of itchiness, rash
and discharge in order to keep those <>dors
under control.
Maybe she works really long days in an
office where she has to wear stuffy panty
hose.
Maybe she works out in a co-ed gym
after those really long days before she takes
a shower. Maybe her lover has an extra-sen
sitive sense of smell.
Sure, on the surface this is really funny
and silly. I laughed all the way home from
the drugstore.
When I got home, there was a message
from an old friend from home. She comes
from a family of feminine hygiene spray
types. They don't talk about bodies or sex in
her family. So when she got violently date

raped at hoarding scho< I. she didn't tell a
soul.
Six years later, in the prime of her life,
she is unahle to participate in normal inti
mate relationships because of her unhealed
emotional wounds. 1 can't help but think if
she had been taught to feel less shameful
about her body, she might have been able to
seek help and vuiuld be a much happier per
son today.
Maybe it's a big jump from odor-sup
pressing products to debilitating emotional
repression. Yet at the core of their beliefs,
both my friend and the feminine deodorant
spray lady are thinking. "Our bodies are
unacceptable, so they must be concealed."
It seems like a sad way to live through
life.
So be yourself. Boycott feminine
deodorant spray.
Don't deodorize, harmonize.

Kerry Rodgers, a senior majoring in philos
ophy ami form of i isual art, thinks feminine
hygiene spra\ could actually he used as a
cheap alternative to mace. Just make sure
you get the hah\ powder kind. It's far supe
rior to the shower fresh formula.
