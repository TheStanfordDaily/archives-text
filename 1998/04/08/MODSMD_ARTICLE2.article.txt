While students will still be praying to the god
dess of good Draw numbers, some anxiety should
be relieved by changes to this year's process.
The most significant change is advance notice
of Draw numbers, which will allow students to
rank their housing choices based on where they
are most likely to get in. Groups also have a week
long period to make changes to their housing
preference list, which this year is located on Axess
on the World Wide Web."
The changes were recommended by the Resi
dential Programs Implementation Group,
formed in response to a report released last fall by
the Task Force on Residential Programs.
Monday night. Housing Assignment Services
held the first open forum for undergraduates
about the Draw process. "I wanted students to
have an opportunity to ask specific questions
about their own situations," said Kathleen Brans
field. manager of Housing Assignment Services.
In the meeting comprised mostly of freshmen
and residential staff, Bransfield and her col
leagues went through the entire Draw process
step by step, stopping to answer all questions.

Bransfield noted that students will apply for
housing this year on the Web. where students will
also submit applications, check on the status of
their priorities and find out Draw numbers and
housing assignments. Draw groups can register
starting April 15.
Groups will receive their Draw numbers on
Axess on May 2. just two days after the deadline
for the initial application. This change enables
students to make a more informed decision and
allows eight days of deliberation before finalizing
residence choices, according to information pro
vided at the meeting.
Most students would agree that this is proba
bly the best change, but "1 think it robs the Draw
process of some its mystery." said sophomore Bill
Huston.
Last year. 230 students w ho applied for hous
ing were unassigned in the first round of the
Draw.
The process goes like this: First, if students
want to live with friends, they must submit a
group application by April 29. One student sets
up the group on Axess by entering a group name
and password, and others may join the group up
until the deadline bv entering the established

name and password on Axess.
A group can he as large as eight people. No
changes can be made alter the deadline.
All undergraduate students have four years of
guaranteed housing. Freshmen have two pre
ferred years (Draw numbers 1-2,000) and one un
preferred year (2,001-3.000). One condition for
forming a group is that every member must be
consistent in choosing a preferred or unpreferred
year, and all must have guaranteed housing, ac
cording to Housing Assignment Services.
Residences will run informational meetings
and open houses April 13-21. giving students the
opportunity to take a close look at the residence,
check out what kinds of rooms there arc. find out
about in-house Draw procedures and gc> the de
tails on how to get priority in the house if neces
sary.
Students can use priorities to improve their
chances of getting into a particular house. Getting
priority is an objective process, and the require
ments vary among the houses.

self-operated houses and all cooperatives offer
