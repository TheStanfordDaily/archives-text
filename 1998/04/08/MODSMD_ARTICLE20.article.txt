# 300 apply to be RAs
## Number roughly the same as last year 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
Despite the recent changes made
to residential housing, there has
been no significant change in the
number of resident assistant applica
tions for next year.
According to Ann Porteus. asso
ciate director of Residential Educa
tion, 300 students turned in RA ap
plications by the deadline last Fri
day, for a total slightly below last
year's 312.
Porteus said the application fig
ure comes as a little bit of a surprise
because the staff did not know what
to expect after the University an
nounced several changes to the con
figuration of residences.
Effective next year, Arroyo,
Cedro and Faisan will be converted
to all-freshman dormitories, while
Toyon will be all-sophomore and
Kimball all-upperclass.
"I don't see any effect of these
changes on the number of applica
tions." Porteus said. She did think it
might have affected the type of ap
plicants, due to the increase in all
freshman dorms.

Boh Royalty, the resident fellow
for East Florence Moore Hall, which
includes Faisan, agreed. "1 don't
think the changes to the dorms af
fected the applications this year," he
said. "We've always had a good mix
of all-frosh and four-class dorms,
and the applications were the same
this year."
Royalty, however, did say that
the number of applicants to his side
of Flo Mo was slightly lower this
year, possibly due to the exclusion of
fifth-year students in the applicant
pool.
Due to the housing crunch expe
rienced this year. University admin
istrators decided to exclude students
who have used up their four years of
guaranteed housing from applying
for residential staff positions in dor
mitories. The only exceptions are
staff positions in the Row houses
and the Suites.
These changes are necessary to
maintain Stanford's commitment to
four years of guaranteed undergrad
uate housing, according to Porteus.
The change hasn't affected the num
ber of fifth-year student applicants,
however. There were 30 applicants

last year who had used up their guar
anteed years, and there are 30 this
year.
According to Porteus, the num
ber of applicants to the Row houses
and Suites did increase significantly
this year, possibly as a result of the
change to the application policy.
Students have expressed their
disappointment in the changes.
Ama Ofusu-Barko, a Gavilan RA
and a senior, had planned tin return
ing to Flo Mo to RA next year. "My
heart was in Flo Mo," she said.
Paul Heneman, a Roble RA and
a junior, expressed the same feel
ings. "I'm kind of disappointed.
[Fifth-year students] are a valuable
addition to the staff, especially the
returning RAs."
The changes, however, did not af
fect Ofusu-Barko's decision to re
apply for next year; she applied to the
Row houses and Suites. "I want to be
an RA. I love the position," she said.
Without freshmen, she said, "it
won't be the same, but there are al
ways other venues to interact with
freshmen, such as advising roles."
Dorm interviews of applicants will
begin during the next two weeks.
