As El Nino subsides and the luscious California
sun re-emerges, the crash dieting season also com
mences. This is the time when millions of Americans
throw billions of dollars at well-known (and not so
well-known) quick-fix schemes for weight loss.
After all, we'll have weddings to attend, beaches to
sun ourselves at, outdoor volleyball games to play,
Exotic Erotic parties to go to, and who can forget Fri
day afternoons at Zot's over on Alpine Road â€”
bathing suits and bare-backs galore.
Well, if there is one message that I've tried to
emphasize, it's that crash diets and starvation tech
niques don't burn fat. True, to shed pounds you must
expend more calories than you ingest. However, sheer
starvation only leads to muscle and water loss and just
isn't healthy.
At the end of that first week of denying yourself
breakfast, lunch and dinner, the scale may tell you
that you're 10 pounds lighter. But that fat which you
love to hate hasn't gone anywhere.
My advice for those who wish to lose the fat that
has plagued them all winter is to exercise, eat right
and stop overeating. First and foremost, exercise. A
combination of aerobic and anaerobic is ideal for
building healthy muscle tone and burning fatty tissue.
A great way to start is by alternating your routine
between easy jogs up to the Dish and workouts in the
weight room at the Arrillaga Family Sports Center.
You'll feel more vibrant and increase your resting
metabolic rate (thus bunting more calories while you
rest) and increase your fat free mass (lean muscle
mass).
Second, remember to eat correctly. Eat a variety of
foods and try new dishes to keep things upbeat.
Returning to the campus dining halls day after day
can get monotonous, so don't let it get you into a rut
of eating that same old cheeseburger or beef taco.
Dabble in the other available offerings. You will also
want to keep away from fatty foods such as McDon
ald's, fried wings, french fries and soft drinks.
Finally, don't overeat. Just because you are eating
salad for a certain meal doesn't mean that you can eat
plate after plate smothered with dressing. Calories
will add up! And. although we all hate to admit it, con
suming alcoholic beverages will also pack on the calo
ries.
Try to use alcohol in moderation, and steer clear of
"the munchies" when the party's over. Why do you
think Jack-in-the-Box stays open until 2 a.m.? The
truth is, a good portion of their daily business is
between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. Eating
"under the influence," after you've had your three
square meals is just overeating, plain and simple.
Hopefully, this list of suggestions will help you get
the figure that you want for all the summer weddings
and bathing suit days ahead. Just try to keep in mind
the mentioned concepts and keep writing in with your
questions!
