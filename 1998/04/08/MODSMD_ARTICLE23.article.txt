A new study published in the March 6 issue of
Science suggests that tasks learned early in life
cause permanent physical changes in the brain.
These changes could explain why childhood learn
ing is so critical to developing the tools necessary
for adult life.
According to Eric Knudsen, professor of neuro
biology and author of the study, "changes in the
brain that are induced by early experience result in
a persistent effect that can be re-used later in life."
Knudsen used owls to monitor the effects of
childhood learning on adult behavior. He gave
very young owls special prismatic glasses that
adjusted the owls' vision so that objects on their
right appeared directly in front. Young owls treat
ed with the glasses would adapt to the shifted
vision. Upon hearing a sound coming from the
right, they would look forward to see the sound
producing object.
Owls given the glasses for the first time at an
older age were unable to adapt their head move
ments. However, older owls who had adapted to
the glasses as youngsters and then re-adapted to
life without the glasses could easily relearn the
head-shifting necessary to see with the prismatic
glasses.
Knudsen's work with owls could potentially
have groundbreaking implications in treating deaf
ness. The deaf often get auditory implants to
bypass damaged or malfunctioning hair cells in the
ear. These malfunctioning hair cells 3re the cause
of many forms of deafness. Ihe implants directly
stimulate the auditory nerves. Implant recipients
who could hear as children but become deaf as
adults can quickly adapt to the stimuli provided by
the implants. However, those who have always
been deaf have much more difficulty.
