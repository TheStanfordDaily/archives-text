# From bench to bedside:
## Translating research into treatments for cancer 
### Eric Keisman 
Advances in our knowledge of how
cancer cells elude chemotherapy may
soon allow doctors to fight back. This
may render previously unresponsive
cancers treatable.
When doctors treat a cancer patient
with chemotherapy, the results can vary
widely. Some cancers shrink away,
while others persist.
"For any particular drug, there are
many ways that a cancer cell can devel
op resistance or be resistant from the
onset of treatment," said Dr. Branimir
Sikic, professor of oncology and direc
tor of Stanford's General Clinical
Research Center. Research in Sikic's
lab aims to understand the mechanisms
of cancer resistance to chemotherapy.
Sikic then takes this knowledge from
the "bench to the bedside" to treat
patients in the clinic.
Chemotherapy kills cells by targeting
the machinery for cell division. Because
cancer cells are dividing out of control,
they are especially susceptible to this
attack. Some drugs interfere with the
machinery that replicates the cell's
DNA. while others disrupt the micro
tubular spindle used to apportion chro
mosomes to daughter cells during divi
sion.
How does cancer develop resistance
to chemotherapy? The key lies in the
recklessness with which cancer cells
duplicate. The poor fidelity of DNA
replication leads to genetic instability,
in which mistakes, or mutations, are fre
quently introduced into the genetic
code.
"Genetic instability is one of the
underlying problems, because the result
of genetic instability is heterogeneity
among cancer cell populations," Sikic
said. The diversity of cells in a tumor
provides a pool in which a resistant cell
may arise. In a classic survival of the
fittest scenario, chemotherapy-resistant
cells have an advantage over their
neighbors and grow to dominate the
tumor.

Sikic and his colleagues study a phe
nomenon called multi-drug resistance,
in which cancerous cells are resistant to
a whole class of chemotherapeutic
drugs. Multi-drug resistance is con
ferred by a protein called P-glycopro
tein (P-gp). P-gp is a "transporter" pro
tein, a molecular pump that spans the
cell membrane.
Scientists believe P-gp is part of the
body's natural defense against foreign
toxins, pumping out poisons that we
might encounter in our environment.
Multi-drug resistant cancer cells have

recruited P-gp to expel chemotherapeu
tic drugs.
Said Sikic. "about half the drugs we
use" are transported by P-gp. rendering
them less effective against these can
cers.
What can be done to attack cancer
cells which are armed with P-gp? The P

gp pump is a tiny protein machine, and
it turns out that one solution is to throw
a molecular wrench into the works.
The drug PSC 833 belongs to the
class of molecules that P-gp transports,
but when P-gp tries to ferry PSC 833
across the cell membrane, it gets stuck,
disabling the pump. P-gp is then unable
to remove chemotherapeutic drugs
from the cell.
When PSC 833 or similar drugs are
added to the chemotherapy regimen,
previously unresponsive cancers can be
forced into remission. "Ultimatelv. our

hope with PSC 833 is that we wil
improve patient survival and perhap
even increase cure rates by adding PSC
833 to conventional chemotherapy,'
Sikic said.
Sikic added, "In patients who do not
yet have drug- resistant disease, our
hope is that PSC 833 will prevent the

development of resistance" by neutral
izing P-gp from the start. Clinical trials
to test the effectiveness of inhibiting P
gp are currently underway.
Another way cancers can evade
chemotherapy is to literally forget how
to die. It turns out that most
chemotherapy doesn't actually kill cells
outright. Instead, chemotherapy inflicts
such damage that the cells commit sui
cide in a process called programmed
cell death. Some tumors have learned
how to activate a gene called bcl-2.
which prevents programmed cell death,
thereby pulling the plug on this self
destruct sequence.
Researchers in Sikic's lab are testing
ways to shut down bcl-2 and render
tumors vulnerable to chemotherapy.
The magic bullet in this case may be
a technique called anti-sense gene ther
apy. In a cell, chemical messengers
called mRN'A's carry the instructions
for building a protein such as bcl-2.
Anti-sense gene therapy involves slip
ping a mirror-image copy of this chemi
cal message into the cell. Like a minia
ture Lego piece, this mirror-image copy
finds its target mRNA and sticks to it.
Lnable to read this inactivated mRNA.
cancer cells are prevented from making
bcl-2 protein and become responsive to
chemotherapy.
The ultimate goal of research such as
Sikic's is to understand the varied ways
in which cancer evades chemotherapy.
Doctors can use this knowledge to
design therapies that overcome resis
tance.
Targeting multiple resistance mecha
nisms at once should further boost the
efficacy of treatment. "The major
progress we've made in the last 20 years
has not been at the bedside." Sikic said.
"But there has been tremendous
improvement in the understanding of
the molecular and cellular basis of can
cers."
Sikic added. "For me. one of the
biggest challenges for the next 10 years
is to translate the knowledge we have to
the bedside to improve patient benefit."
