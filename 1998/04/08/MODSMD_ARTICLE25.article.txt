# Staring into a crystal ball:
## Students predict future trends in technology

Bad traffic getting into the City this afternoon? No
problem, just take your personal helicopter — there's lots
of room in the sky. What do you mean you don't have a
personal helicopter? At the end of World War 11. futur
ists were promising your grandparents that you would be
flitting about in the skies by now.
So. if the predictions of the past fell that far from the
mark, what lead Computer Science Prof. Ed Feigenbaum
to offer a course on forecasting the future of information
technology last quarter?
In partnership with Paul Saffo. director at the non
profit Institute for the Future, Feigenbaum led a class of
15 undergraduate and graduate students in which they
developed forecasts for the direction of technology in the
next 20 years.
Twenty years from now, these predictions will range
from enormously to slightly inaccurate. "There is a ten
dency at Stanford to teach today's techniques with
today's technology for concreteness," Feigenbaum said.
"Students are not taught how to envision the adaptations
they will need to survive in their careers and beyond
graduation."

Rajat Paharia, a computer science master's student
who took the course, agrees. "Doing a forecast makes
you look at a much bigger picture than you would have
otherwise," he said. Forecasting attempts to analytically
extend today's trends into the future, and as such must
examine much more than just technological advances.
Economic, managerial, political, social, cultural, intellec
tual, ecological and ethical considerations frequently
shape the development and acceptance of a new technol
ogy more than its engineering requirements.
Forecasting is not just reading tea leaves either. As
commercial interest in forecasting has grown, a large col
lection of techniques has been developed to prov ide for
casting with some analytic basis. "Forecasting is about
what will happen, not what you think should happen."
Saffo said.
One such method applies the famous S-curve to track
the diffusion of a specific technology into society. New
products ranging from the printing press and automobile
to personal computers and the World Wide Web follow
the same general tiend. At first, the priKluct's acceptance
is siow. but it suddenly accelerates until the market is sat
urated. Then the demand slows, rhe forecaster's chal
lenge is to determine where on that curve a new technol

ogy lies.
In case you think that forecasts based on these tech
niques never come true, consider the case of Moore's
Law. In 1%4. shortly after the invention of the integrat
ed circuit. Gordon Moore made an off-the-cuff predic
tion that the number of transistors on a chip would dou
ble every IK months.
More than 30 years later, the exponential growth in
transistor density implied by that prediction still holds.
Many unpredictable innovations in integrated circuit
manufacturing were required to maintain Moore's law.
but the general trend it extrapolated has held true for
over three decades. Many believe it will for at least two
more.
Forecasting. 10 to 20 years into the future, is a unique
endeavor that Feigenbaum feels students would benefit
from practicing. " Forecasts too far into the future quick
ly become science fiction." he said, "while those restrict
ed to the next few years are journalism." Targets beyond
current research — but close enough that plausible links
can be drawn between the present and the future —yield
useful forecasts. And students like Paharia can think of
an application for good forecasts. As Paharia says. "If
you am forecast the future, perhaps you can invent it."
