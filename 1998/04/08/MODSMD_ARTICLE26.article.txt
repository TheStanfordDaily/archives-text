# What will the future look like in 2017?

ng that kind of computing power in the
palm of your hand.
However, conventional chip designs
do have their limits, and researchers
predict that the superchips described
above may be the end of the line for tra
ditional microprocessors. By that stage,
some of the structures comprising indi
vidual transistors may be only a few
atoms thick. Under those conditions,
quantum atomic effects will begin to dis
rupt transistor function.
Technological innovation, however,

depends as much on advances in soft
ware as in hardware. A prime example is
speech recognition. Long promised by
artificial intelligence researchers,
speech recognition is finally appearing
in commercial packages. What will rev
olutionize interaction between humans
and computers will be the adoption of
agents — programs capable of au
tonomous. goal-based action.
For example, suppose you want to
know in what movie Sheryl Lee starred
in 1992. Instead of searching the World
Wide Web for a site featuring movie in
formation and then searching that site
for Sheryl Lee. in 2017 you may be able
to simply say to your computer, "In

what movie did Sheryl Lee star in
1992?" The computer will interpret the
speech, dispatch an agent to retrieve
"Fire. Walk With Me" from the appro
priate Internet database, and instruct
that agent to find the director's, produc
er's and costars' names as well. Tomor
row's machines will be more like well
trained secretaries than the mute plastic
boxes of today.
Moreover, if the question comes up
at a park bench over lunch, there will be
no need to pull out your laptop and
search for a telephone socket to get the
answer. Increasing power in smaller
packages means that today's portable
computers will give way to tiny "person

al information appliances" (PIAs).
Technophiles can already search the
Web by wireless modem on paperback
sized PI As. By 2017, a PI A the size of a
credit card will have more power than
current desktops, be wirelessly connect
ed to a worldwide network, and may
even include speech recognition fea
tures.
"If you want to know the future, look
at what today's engineers read when
they were kids," said Paul Saffo, direc
tor of the nonprofit Institute for the Fu
ture. Star Trek computing may seem far
off, but remember how far we've come
since 1977, when we had the Apple II
and punched cards.
How would you like to live in the
world of Star Trek? Well, by 21)17 we
may not be going "where no one has
gone before," but our computers may
be more like the Starship Enterprise's
than the latest Macintosh.
After all. making the next genera
tion of computers a reality requires
only three steps: shrinking a supercom
puter into a broach-sized piece of jew
elry, writing applications which can
understand human language and
autonomously solve tasks, and using
wireless technology to connect the rest
of the world. Sound unlikely? The stu
dents of Computer Science Prof. Ed
Feigenbaum's forecasting course pre
dict just that for the future, and more.
The most viable of their predictions
states that the size of computers will
shrink. The operational element on the
integrated circuit, or chip, that runs
your computer is the transistor. The
Intel HOBB — the microprocessor at the
heart of the first IBM PCs in 1981 —
contained about 7,000 transistors. The

miniaturization of transistors permits
fabrication of 10 million transistors on
the Pentium 11. Technologists predict
that within the next 15 years, a chip of
the same size will have over a billion
individual transistors.
Since the speed and power of a chip
increases as the size of transistors
shrink, the microprocessors of 2012
may be capable of more than a trillion
operations per second. That is a thou
sand-fold increase over today's fastest
chips — about the same as the speed
difference between the Pentium II and
the 8088.
In fact, it would nearly equal the
speed of the current champion super
computer, a parallel processor ASCI
Red which contains over 9,000 Pentium
Pros and is owned by the Department
of Energy. Red is designed to simulate
extremely complex systems in minute
detail; for example, the evaporation,
collision, and burning of individual
droplets of fuel in the combustion
chamber of a jet engine. Imagine hoidi
