# What will the future look like in 2017?

ng that kind of computing power in the
palm of your hand.
However, conventional chip designs
do have their limits, and researchers
predict that the superchips described
above may be the end of the line for tra
ditional microprocessors. By that stage,
some of the structures comprising indi
vidual transistors may be only a few
atoms thick. Under those conditions,
quantum atomic effects will begin to dis
rupt transistor function.
Technological innovation, however,

depends as much on advances in soft
ware as in hardware. A prime example is
speech recognition. Long promised by
artificial intelligence researchers,
speech recognition is finally appearing
in commercial packages. What will rev
olutionize interaction between humans
and computers will be the adoption of
agents â€” programs capable of au
tonomous. goal-based action.
For example, suppose you want to
know in what movie Sheryl Lee starred
in 1992. Instead of searching the World
Wide Web for a site featuring movie in
formation and then searching that site
for Sheryl Lee. in 2017 you may be able
to simply say to your computer, "In

what movie did Sheryl Lee star in
1992?" The computer will interpret the
speech, dispatch an agent to retrieve
"Fire. Walk With Me" from the appro
priate Internet database, and instruct
that agent to find the director's, produc
er's and costars' names as well. Tomor
row's machines will be more like well
trained secretaries than the mute plastic
boxes of today.
Moreover, if the question comes up
at a park bench over lunch, there will be
no need to pull out your laptop and
search for a telephone socket to get the
answer. Increasing power in smaller
packages means that today's portable
computers will give way to tiny "person

al information appliances" (PIAs).
Technophiles can already search the
Web by wireless modem on paperback
sized PI As. By 2017, a PI A the size of a
credit card will have more power than
current desktops, be wirelessly connect
ed to a worldwide network, and may
even include speech recognition fea
tures.
"If you want to know the future, look
at what today's engineers read when
they were kids," said Paul Saffo, direc
tor of the nonprofit Institute for the Fu
ture. Star Trek computing may seem far
off, but remember how far we've come
since 1977, when we had the Apple II
and punched cards.
