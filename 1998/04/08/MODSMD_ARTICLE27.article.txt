WOMEN'S TENNIS
■ Yesterday: Stanford 7, California
1

To date, the Cardinal (20-1
overall, 8-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
has been playing extremely tight
matches, four of which were de
cided by one match. Since losing
to UCLA 5-4 last Friday, Stanford
has responded by demolishing
USC 6-0 and the Bears 7-1.
Stanford stomped all over Cal
(14-5, 5-2) from the start and
never looked back. Five quick
straight-set wins, and the Cardinal
had its 20th dual-match win of the
season.
"That was more than I could
ever have hoped for today," said
Stanford head coach Frank Bren
nan. "1 think we have responded
very well to the adversity of losing
that match. We were pretty darn
good against a good USC team,
and very good against a great Cal
team."
Four Stanford singles players
recorded 6-0 sets against their
archrival counterparts from

Berkeley. In the No. 2 match,
Stanford senior captain Julie Scott
registered two of them in white
washing Cal sophomore Amy
Jensen. Right next door on the No.
3 court. Cardinal sophomore
Teryn Ashley was busy picking
apart sophomore Esther Knox, 6-
0, 6-3.
Senior Ania Bleszynski was the
first to finish for the Cardinal,
cruising past Cal freshman Anita
Kurimay in the No. 4 match, 6-0,6-
1. On the No. 6 court, Stanford
sophomore Jennifer Heiser had
little trouble with junior Francesca
La'O, winning easily, 6-2, 6-0.
In the top singles spot, Stanford
sophomore Anne Kremer
avenged a previous dual-match
loss to Amanda Augustus. The Cal
junior took the match in their first
meeting, but Kremer was too
tough this time, winning 6-2, 6-1.
"Those scores are unbeliev
able," Brennan said.
Brennan's surprise certainly is
justified, given the previous meet
ing between these two teams.
Playing at Berkeley in February,
the Cardinal needed a huge win by
Heiser and strong doubles play to
escape the Bears' upset bid.
Stanford added insult to injury
with a win in the No. 5 singles
match. After dropping the second
set as t he other five matches ended
in favor of the Cardinal, freshman
Sarah Pestieau rebounded for a
three-set triumph over Cal junior
