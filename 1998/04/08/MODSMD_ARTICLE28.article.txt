BASEBALL
â–  Yesterday: No. 1 Stanford 8. Nevada 2

An RBI single hy Wolf Pack senior catcher
Corky Miller drove in sophomore outfielder
Joe Inglett in the top of the fourth. Meanwhile,
the routinely hard-hitting Cardinal (28-5-1)
remained strangely silent.

That is, until Cardinal junior Josh Hochge
sang stepped to the plate in the bottom of the
sixth. The third baseman tallied his seventh
homerun of the season with a solo shot that ar
cked easily over the left field fence.
"I just got everybody up before the inning
started, and I just said we made a couple stupid
mistakes but we're playing well," Hochgesang
said. "We're hitting the ball well, let's just stick
with it and in the end we'll come out on top.
"Anything can happen, even with two outs,
and I just got a decent pitch to hit. I kept my
head down, and it went over the fence. It's
pretty simple."
From there, the Wolf Pack fell prey to a
landslide as 10 Stanford players took a turn at

the plate, bringing in six runs. Junior outfield
er Nick Day opened the frame with a solo
homer, his first of the season, off freshman
righthander Christian Johnsen.
With the run.the Cardinal took the lead.
Wolf Hack head coach Gary Powers delved
into the bullpen four times during the seventh
in an ineffectual attempt to cork the Cardinal
scoring deluge.
"It was a great game for six innings," Pow
ers said. "Stanford did the things they needed
to do to take advantage of our mistakes. We
expected that to happen if we got ourselves
into that situation.
