Stanford's 8-2 victory over unranked Nevada
(16-15-0) yesterday hinged on one hit.

BASEBALL
■ Yesterday: No. 1 Stanford 8. Nevada 2

An RBI single hy Wolf Pack senior catcher
Corky Miller drove in sophomore outfielder
Joe Inglett in the top of the fourth. Meanwhile,
the routinely hard-hitting Cardinal (28-5-1)
remained strangely silent.

That is, until Cardinal junior Josh Hochge
sang stepped to the plate in the bottom of the
sixth. The third baseman tallied his seventh
homerun of the season with a solo shot that ar
cked easily over the left field fence.
"I just got everybody up before the inning
started, and I just said we made a couple stupid
mistakes but we're playing well," Hochgesang
said. "We're hitting the ball well, let's just stick
with it and in the end we'll come out on top.
"Anything can happen, even with two outs,
and I just got a decent pitch to hit. I kept my
head down, and it went over the fence. It's
pretty simple."
From there, the Wolf Pack fell prey to a
landslide as 10 Stanford players took a turn at

the plate, bringing in six runs. Junior outfield
er Nick Day opened the frame with a solo
homer, his first of the season, off freshman
righthander Christian Johnsen.
With the run.the Cardinal took the lead.
Wolf Hack head coach Gary Powers delved
into the bullpen four times during the seventh
in an ineffectual attempt to cork the Cardinal
scoring deluge.
"It was a great game for six innings," Pow
ers said. "Stanford did the things they needed
to do to take advantage of our mistakes. We
expected that to happen if we got ourselves
into that situation.
"I mean, they're not No. 1 in
the country, because they don't
know how to do that. ... I think
we didn't do a good job offensive
ly earlier in the game when we
had a chance to take the lead."
The Cardinal, meanwhile,
worked four pitchers, with the
win going to junior Tony Cogan
(3-0).
Cogan "hasn't been as effec
tive in the earlier part of the
year," Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess said. "Today he was
very effective. This was a good
outing for him. That was one of
the things that was real positive
about today was that he pitched
like he's capable of."
Yesterday's victory stands in
sharp contrast to the Cardinal's
13-5 loss to the Wolf Pack on
March 26 in Reno. In that game,
the Cardinal suffered a pitching
drought as Marquess repeatedly
reached into the bullpen in vain.
"We pitched very well
[today]," Marquess said. "I
thought we didn't swing the bat
very well. We hit a couple home
runs, but we can swing the bat

better than we have been. Hut on
the whole, it was a good opportu
nity for the pitchers because you
want to get the pitchers to work."
The Cardinal next prepares for
a trio of games against Bay Area
rival California (13-21, 1-16).
Last week, the Bears defeated
UCLA 11-4 before dropping
three straight to the Bruins in Los
Angeles over the weekend.
