## Fans celebrate NCAA titles and Final Four run 
### Ben Hur Senior staff writer 
It was a sign that Stanford is not
just an academic powerhouse.
Last night's rally at Maples Pavil
ion honored the recent accomplish
ments of the men's and women's
swimming teams, the synchronized
swimming team, the College Bowl
team and the men's basketball team.
Just under 1 .(KM) fans attended, lis
tening and cheering as each squad
was announced. University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper, introduced to
the crowd as a representative of the
Sixth Man Club, took shots at the

Cardinal basketball team.
Casper congratulated the hoop
sters for a fine run to the Final Four,
but also had a suggestion for head
coach Mike Montgomery.
"After seeing his gyrations during
the Rhode Island game, I think the
team should take a course in dance
from Mad Dog," Casper said, refer
ring to sophomore forward Mark
Madsen.
Madsen, whose dunk against
Rhode Island with 26 seconds left on
the clock punctuated Stanford's
amazing comeback victory and led to
his frenzied movements, was disap
pointed with Casper's description of

his dancing technique.
"For Casper to consider my great
dancing as mere 'gyrations' was erro
neous," Madsen said. "But I guess I
can see where he is coming from. Se
riously though, it was all taken in
good spirit."
Casper ended his brief remarks
with his best rendition of Dick Vi
tale's "Awesome, baby!"
However, the German accent did
not ring sweetly in the ears of every
one in attendance.
"If Dick VitaJe spoke with a Ger
man accent. I don't think I could
stand him," Montgomery said.
Montgomery spoke on behalf of

all the teams honored at the rally.
"I want to congratulate the men's
and women's swimming teams and
the synchronized swimming team."
he said. "Stanford athletics is about
athletes supporting athletes, and 1
am just glad that [men's basketball)
could finally step up to the plate and
get to the level that so many other
Stanford teams have."
The men's and women's swim
ming squads, along with the synchro
team, each earned national titles
over spring break. Each of the three
squads earned their trophies onto
the floor, signifying their status as the
best in collegiate athletics.
"I was surprised." said senior
men's swimmer Sahir Muhammad.
"Everyone was so excited that it
makes you feel gcxni about being an
athlete here."
For the men's and women's swim
ming teams, the victory added yet
another accolade to their distin
guished past. It marked the eighth
national title for both the men's and
women's squads.
For the synchronized swimming
team, however, the victory was less
commonplace. The squad has consis
tently placed among the nation's syn
chro elite, but it finally earned top
honors by dethroning Ohio State,
ending the Buckeyes' 13-vear reign
as champions.
"It was awesome," said junior Ail-
American synchro member Cather
ine Chen. "Representing Stanford
has really been an honor. We didn't
expect to be recognized like this with
basketball and swimming. We were
really honored to be here."
The College Bowl champions
were also recognized and given a
standing ovation by the crowd,
demonstrating that Stanford is trul\
an institution that excels on many
levels.
