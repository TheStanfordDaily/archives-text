## Merger approved 
### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
The Board of Trustees yester
day approved a merger of the Stan
ford Aluruni Association with the
University, a move that could end
the association's independence
after more than 1(H) years.
The decision to integrate the as
sociation with the University will
be fully decided after Alumni As
sociation board deliberation sched
uled for niid-Mav and a vote by
members of the association.
"I'm very pleased with the
progress so far." said Bill Stone, di
rector of the Alumni Association.
"I think that we have reduced the
issues under debate to a manage
able number, and we will discuss
the process further in May."
The board authorized the five
trustees on a task force created in

January of this yeat to sign the
merger agreement, contingent
upon the Alumni Association's de
liberations in May. This merger is
anticipated to increase the number
of alumni programs, services and
resources.
"One of the benefits of t his com
bination is that it will allow the Uni
versity to provide more services for
the Alumni Association by creating
more programs, more resources
and more useful contacts," said
trustee John Lilley. chair of the
task force.
Lilley added that the combina
tion creates benefits for students.
"This initiative creates an in
creased focus on students from the
very time that they are accepted
and admitted," he said "We are
recognizing that we need to pre
pare them ... for a lifelong associ
ation with the University."
The union of the University and
the association is contingent upon
the Alumni Association's approval
and a positive vote from the Uni
versity's 72,000 alumni. At least 10
percent of alumni must vote to
reach a quorum.
Coordinating the voting proce
dure will be a difficult task, accord
ing to Lilley, hut plans are being
made to create World Wide Web
sites to facilitate voting.
The votes will be collected by
September.
Associated with this decision is
the approval of preliminary plans
for a new alumni center, which
would be combined with the Uni
versity's Office of Development.
"The most exciting component
of the announcement is the ap
proval of the plan for the alumni
center," Stone said. "The creation
a home base for the alumni is quite
welcome."
The new building, which will
cost more than $30 million, would
serve as a center for alumni visitors
to the University and would pro
vide increased working and meet
ing space.
The new facility is planned to be
located at the corner of Campus
Drive and Galvez Street. The Of
fice of Development would move
out of Encina Hall: the space that
has already been slated for another
department.
"The task force is the sign of try
ing to bring this merger to a conclu
sion," Lillev said.
"1 think that we've made sub
stantial progress; we have a draft
which brings us closer to an agree
ment."
Yesterday's meeting also result
ed in the appointment of a new
member of the Board of Trustees,
Susan Packard Orr.
Orr received both a bachelor's
and an MBA from Stanford; she is
president of the David and Lucile
Packard Foundation and a director
of Hewlett-Packard Co. Her hus
band. Franklin Orr Jr.. is dean of
the School of Earth Sciences.
