of life and as a vehicle to enrich themselves on a human level.'
— Coach Franck Boivert

is the national champion. The University of the
South Pacific had players from the 12 island na

ford coach Franck Boivert. "The teams we
played were excellent, very fast and skilled."
Playing only two games in nearly two weeks
gave the Stanford players the opportunity to ex
plore Fiji and take part in community service
events. I he team acknowledged that it was pri
marily rugby that brought them to Fiji, but it is
apparent that the Card came away with a lot

more.

players to experience rugby as a p;irt of life and
as a vehicle to enrich themselves on a human
level," Boivert said.
"This trip fulfilled this goal. The Stanford
players learned a lot about rugbv. but also a lot

about themselves, about a different culture, dif
ferent people, and they also embraced the beau
ty of a different environment. It is my conviction
that it will help them be better players, because
they will be better men."
