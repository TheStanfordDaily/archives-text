# Spitting and scratching ...
## Let's play ball! 
### 
It's springtime again, and after
a short hiatus from our columns,
(We w ere on our world tour — 15
central Californian metropolises
in three fun-filled days. What
could he better?) we 're hack and
readx to attack the world of

sports. This week, we're talking
about why this will he the come
back year for America's favorite
pastime.
Va: Alright, lawn darts in the
Olympics! I've got 20 on the
C roatians.
Robin: Hey dummy, you must
still be on painkillers from your

surgery. We're talking about
baseball. You're the only one
who plays lawn darts.
Va: Shut up. By the way. thanks
for the post-op flowers.
Robin: Seriously, do you think
baseball is making a resurrec-

tion?
Va: Yeah sure, but why do you
want my opinion?
Robin: As I can see. the time off
has not made you any nicer. The
whole point of this column is for
me to ask you questions and for
you to provide insightful answers

about the world of sports. You're
our resident expert.
V a: Oh, well in that case I predict
baseball to be the next lead char
acter in a Ouentin Tarentino
movie.
Robin: OK, sounds like those
drugs are really working for you.
Tell us what your favorite thing
about baseball is.
Va: Two verbs: scratch and spit.
Totally unacceptable in any other
facet of society, an everyday part
of baseball life.
Robin: Va. do you like to scratch
and spit?
Va: No, I like to watch.
Robin: Well, besides those verbs,
what are things the average specta
tor can identify with in baseball?
Va: I love that it's outside. You can
watch and get sun. but watch out for
nasty tan lines from the foul poles.
Robin: What about domes?
Va: Like the Taj Mahal?
Robin: Not exactly. You don't get
out much do you? Let me ask you
this, do you enjoy the atmosphere
at ball games?
Va: It's got to be tops for relaxing
— best food, not a lot of quick ac
tion to follow, if you have to pee
you might not miss anything, and
of course, inebriation.
Robin: You're not talking about
drinking, are you?
Va: Well Robin. I personally don't
drink, but I hear it's definitely a
good thing to do in the hot sun at a
baseball game.
Robin: Well. I m kind of the resi
dent expert on this. Let me just
jump in here. Nothing fits in with a
baseball diamond better than a
few cold ones. And if you've got a
big group, just bring along a keg.
Va: Yeah, and if you squint really
hard, a keg looks like a baseball
from far away, only without stitch
es and it's gray with a rope in it.
Robin: I have nothing to say to
that. Let's move on. Do you ever
really get into the heckling aspect

of the sport?
Va: I'm a natural. I've been called
the Hulk Hogan of hecklers.
Robin: Really? 1 hadn't heard that.
Va: C ome on you crybaby, you're
writing like a girl. Put some mus
tard on that hot dog. My grand
mother writes better than that.
Robin: Oooh, you are good.
Va: Yeah, and that's with no re
search. My preferred technique is
to attack one player with the aim
of making him cry.
Robin: I'm crying now. Well, if
what you're saying is true, baseball
must be making a comeback The
thing I like is that you can bring
your glove to the park and if you
catch a ball, you get to keep it.
Va: Anything that flies into the
stands you get to keep. Freebies
and constant physical danger —
what's not to like about that?
Robin: I really don't know. But se
riously. baseball is different from
most other sports. What do you
think about the format of the
game?
Va: 1 love the fact that they just
end it if it rains. And why nine in
nings? Just because we didn't feel
like playing 10.
Robin: Well what if you get caught
at one of those 18-inning marathon
games that last forever?
Va: You can leave when you want.
It's not like anvthing's holding you
there. You got your nine innings
worth. It's not like someone
chained you to your chair and
made you watch "Babylon 5" re
runs.
Robin: I have friends who like
"Babylon 5."
Va: You would.
Robin: On that note, we're done.
Despite what we may have led you
to believe, baseball is definitely
back, so get out to the park and
catch a game.

On a more serious note, be sure to
visit Sea-level Diamond (home of
Stanford softball) to be a part of the
action this Saturday on the first un
official Official Becky Unruh Day.
Festivities begin at 1 p.m. as the
Card takes on California.
