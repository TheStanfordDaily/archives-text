could he better?) we 're hack and
readx to attack the world of

sports. This week, we're talking
about why this will he the come
back year for America's favorite
pastime.
Va: Alright, lawn darts in the
Olympics! I've got 20 on the
C roatians.
Robin: Hey dummy, you must
still be on painkillers from your

surgery. We're talking about
baseball. You're the only one
who plays lawn darts.
Va: Shut up. By the way. thanks
for the post-op flowers.
Robin: Seriously, do you think
baseball is making a resurrec-

tion?
Va: Yeah sure, but why do you
want my opinion?
Robin: As I can see. the time off
has not made you any nicer. The
whole point of this column is for
