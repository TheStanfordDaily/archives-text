## 
### John Sullivan Staff writer 
With the best defense and pitch
ing in arguably the best conference
in the country, Stanford softball
should dispose of the pesky Santa
Clara Broncos quite easily. The
teams meet today at the Stanford
Softball Complex at 2 p.m.

SOFTBALL
â–  Today: No. 13 Stanford (25-8) vs.
Santa Clara (10-28) at the Stanford
Softball Complex. 3 p.m.

However, the 13th-ranked Card
(25-8) will have to improve its per
formance at the plate if it wants to
roll over the Broncos (10-28). Last
weekend. Stanford was uncharac
teristically quiet at the plate, aver
aging only six hits and two runs a
game.
"Although in years past, we

could look at Santa Clara as an au
tomatic win, that is no longer the
case," said Stanford coach John
Rittman. "They have a lot of young
talent and have nothing to lose."
Stanford, on the other hand, may
have something to lose hy dropping
a game to a team like Santa Clara.
This week's NFCA/USA lodav
coaches' poll inched Stanford up to
No. 13 from the No. 14 spot it held
during the past three weeks.
Earlier in the season, Stanford
steamrolled the Broncos 7-0. Last
season, the Card swept Santa Clara
4-1. 11-0.
"It is definitely going to he a
challenge for us to go out against
Santa Clara with the same intensity
as if we were going against a Pacific
10 Conference team." said junior
pitcher Marcy Crouch. "However,
Santa Clara is a scrappy team that
we can't overlook. Also, they give
us a good opportunity to get used to
our field again after the road trip."

Despite a poor record and con
sistently poor performances against
ranked teams. Santa ( lara is not a
team wholly without talent. The
Broncos have four players current
ly batting over .333: sophomore
Melanie Hoick at .394, sophomore
Shawnterra Moore at .355, and
freshmen Natalie Fry and Lisa I)a
-zols at .333.
On the mound. Hoick has been
respectable, posting a 2.84 LKA
and a 3-8 record: she has given up 84
hits in 61 1 / 3 innings. Moore, with
a 3.00 HRA and 2-5 record is also
decent, but she has also given up
more hits than innings pitched with
71 in 53 2 / 3 innings.
The game against Santa Clara
has significance for Stanford be
yond this season, even though win
ning both games is crucial if the
Card wishes to maintain its No. 13
ranking. Santa C lara is an emerging
team, with over two-thirds of its
team and most of its leaders consist-

ing of underclassmen. Ihe experi
ence against this team will certainly
come in handy down the road.
For Stanford pitching has been
its strength Junior Becky Blevins
leads the squad and the Pac-1() with
a .90 FRA. She also ranks fifth in
the conference in wins (15), stike
outs (Ml), and shutouts (5). Stan
ford's other starter. Crouch, has
been phenomenal on the mound,
tossing two complete game
shutouts last weekend against top
25 squads.
At the plate, junior Michele
Acosta is leading the Card with a
.359 batting average. She is also
tops in hits with 37. doubles with
eight, homeruns with two and RBI
with 26.
Slugger Michele Schneider is
also tearing things up with the tim
ber, hitting .320 with a team-leading
21 runs. She has also collected 31
hits, seven doubles, a homer and
nine RBI
