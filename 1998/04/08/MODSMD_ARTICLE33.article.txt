# Zimm makes his mark on West Coast
## 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
Wrestler Zach Zimmerer called
a mutual friend after our interview.
"Oh, yeah, one more thing," he
said, "tell him not to write that I'm
some redneck hick."

"Hut Zach..." my friend re
sponded. "you are some redneck
hick."
The truth is perhaps in the mid
dle. Although Zimmerer elected to
leave the friendly confines of
Billings, Mont, for the Bay Area, he
remains a stout fan of country and

western music, hunting and fishing.
"In Montana, it's really white
bread, so there was this real culture
shock coming out here," Zimmerer
said. "It made me appreciate Mon
tana more."
However, in his three years on
the West Coast, "Zimm," a redshirt
sophomore, has built an impressive
resume of wrestling achievement.
After redshirting his freshman year,
the 126-pounder took third place at
the Aggie Open and second at the
All-Cal Invitational in his first sea
son on the mat.
Zimmerer led the team with six
pins on the way to a fourth-place fin
ish at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, which landed him a
spot at the NCAA tournament.
There, Zimmerer went four rounds,
compiling a 2-2 record and placing
him in the top 20 in the nation.
"I definitely pick it up at the end
of the year," Zimmerer said.
This year, the double major in
economics and mechanical engi
neering went 22-15 en route to a sec
ond-place finish at the Pac-lOs. At
the NCAAs in Cleveland, Zimmer
er faced a tough first-round draw
against fifth-seeded Pat McNamara
of Michigan State. The match went
to the wire as Zimmerer fell 9-8.
He then beat Ryan Egan of
Northern Illinois 13-9 to advance
against 11 th-seeded Shawn Ford of
Arizona State in the consolation
bracket. Zimmerer had defeated
Ford in the Pac-10 Championships
but could not duplicate the feat, los
ing 9-3.
In light of his solid overall and
dual-meet records, the season was
certainly a successful one for both
Zimmerer and the team.
"We had a reallv voung team.

and [senior co-captain Scott] Chap
man was out early" to injury, Zim
merer said. "But our mental tough
ness was our strong point.
"Coach [Chris Horpel] did a real
ly good job this year in getting us
ready. Everyone had faith in each
other, and it gave everyone more
faith in themselves."
The highlights of a season that
ends at the nationals are always
many, but Zimmerer points to two
victories over tough ranked oppo
nents. His Jan. 7 6-3 defeat of Penn's
Steve Walker began a winning
streak that carried Zimmerer to the
NCAAs. He enjoyed similar success
against Fresno State's Stan Greene,
who was in and out of the top eight
all season, and his 13-4 victory over
Ford at the Pac-lOs proved that
Zimmerer is a force to be reckoned
with.
"1 honestly feel that 1 can wrestle
with anyone in the country when it
comes down to it," Zimmerer said.
"I could win it all, or 1 could take
last."
With the loss of senior captains
and the departure of juniors B.J.
Sanchez and Doug Bardsley proba
ble, the team needs a strong leader
to lead it to the promised land of a
Pac-10 title. The burden will likely
fall on Zimmerer, one of the most
experienced members of the team.
"He's the main guy on the team I
look to for inspiration," said team
mate Kay von Bina, a freshman.
"He'll be a big part of whether or not
we're successful next year."
Zimm's ready.
"I definitely want to be an Ail-
American," he said, "and 1 want to
win the conference."
Added Bina: "I'd be surprised if
he didn't."
