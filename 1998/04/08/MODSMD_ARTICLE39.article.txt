schools of Earth Sciences, Engi
neering and Humanities and Sci
ences. This year's awardees are
Jhumki Basu. Mark Bell, Sunil
Gandhi. Heidi Hau, Allison Hiin
mel, Alexander Maloney, John
Maurer and Robert Neel.
These students distinguished
themselves to their professors and
advisers by showing high levels of
accomplishment, often researching
topics at the graduate level and
sometimes studying multiple acade
mic disciplines.
Many professors remarked that
the students they selected were
among the most extraordinary they
had encountered in years of teach
ing at Stanford.
"This is the most impressive un
dergraduate I have come in contact
with in seven years of mentoring
over 30 Stanford undergraduates,"

Asst. Neurophysiology Prof. Bruce
Maclver said of Himmel.
Mathematics Prof. Emeritus Robert
Finn said Neel was among "very few stu
dents at any level who possess such origi
nality and independence."
Former Dean of Undergraduate Stud
ies Tom Wasow, who created the Deans'
Award in 1988. said the award is designed
"to celebrate some of the exceptional
scholarly achievements of our undergrad
uate students and to bring them campus
wide recognition."
