# Navy wants Stanford lawyers
## Law School may have to change military policy 
### Shelley Ingram Contributing writer 
Stanford Law School may have
to change its longstanding position
against allowing the military to re
eruit its students, despite the
Armed Forces' stance on gay and
lesbian personnel.
Although the Law School has
been able to avoid deciding
whether the military is in violation
of its nondiscrimination polio. re
cent communications from the
Navy may force a decision.
The military has not recruited at
the Law School in recent years, but
it expressed interest last fall in in
terviewing law students for their
Judge Advocate General's Corps,
the unit portrayed by Tom Cruise
and Demi Moore in "A Few Good
Men."
This unit is composed only of
lawyers and is responsible for all
trial and legal work for the mili
tary.
But the Law School's nondis

crimination in employment policy,
in effect since states that its
facilities and services are open onl\
to employers who do not discrimi
nate or, the basis of a number of
categories, including sexual orien
tation.
The military is potential!) in \i
olation of this standard because of
its "don't ask. don't tell" policy,
which prevents the militar) from
asking its personnel about sexual
orientation hut does allow them to
discharge service people who are
gay or lesbian.
Because of this, the Law School
has not allowed the militar\ to re
cruit at its buildings. Recent legis
lation places student financial aid
at risk if the school does not ac
commodate the nnlitar) Last fall,
a concession was made b\ the Law
School that gave the nnlitar) per
mission to interview law students
at the Career Planning and Place
ment Center, which was seen as
technically not at the Law School.
Whether this compromise will satisfy
the military remains to be seen.
The CPPC has always allowed military
recruitment because its policy states its
facilities are open only to employers that
do not "unlawfully discriminate."
"The military has a waiver from the
federal government to discriminate law
fully." said CPPC Director Bob Thirsk.
"Our policy states anyone that unlawful
ly discriminates can't use our services or
facilities."
Outlaw, the gay and lesbian law stu
dent association, has been working to
keep the military entirely off the campus.
"Outlaw's position is that the military
should not recruit at all on campus," said
Toni Broaddus, Outlaw member. "If the

military was blatantly discriminating
against women or blacks, the Law School
wouldn't stand tor that. We think they
should do the same for gays and lesbians
because our civil rights are no less impor
tant."
In the past, the Law School would not
have had to grant the military's request to
recruit. In 1990. however. Congress
passed the Solomon Amendment, named
after Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.,
which placed any school's Department of
Defense funding in jeopardy if the mili
tary was not allowed to recruit on cam
pus.
Because law schools did not receive
defense funding, they were still able to
deny the military access to students. To
directly target law schools, a second
Solomon Amendment was passed in 19%
that prohibits the Department of Educa
tion and other government agencies from
. giving.granls to colleges that ban military

recruiters.
This includes any federal financial aid
given in lump sum to a school for later dis
tribution to students.
Between $75(),(M)() and $1 million each
year in Law School funding could be in
jeopardy, according to Law School Dean
Paul Brest.
According to Eric Pelletier, parlia
mentary counsel to Congress' Rules
Committee, which is chaired by Solomon,
the amendments were enacted because
skilled personnel in the military are es
sential to providing national defense.
"The military should still be allowed
access to students and let the students
make the decision rather than having the
school's administration make the deci
sion because they may disagree with the
policy of our nation's military," Pelletier
said.
Outlaw's Broaddus interprets
the Solomon Amendment differ
ently.
"The Solomon Amendment is
basically an attempt to blackmail
law schools into complicity with the
U.S. government's policy of dis
criminating against and harassing
gay and lesbian citizens," she said.
The Solomon Amendment
placed many law schools in the mid
dle of needing to protect financial
aid while still complying with their
nondiscrimination policies.
Frank Valdes, of the gay and les
bian section of the American Asso
ciation of Law Schools, explained
that although the Armed Forces do
not comply with the association's
nondiscrimination policy, the asso
ciation was forced to allow univer
sities' noncompliance because of
the financial burden the law creat
ed.
"We decided to excuse noncom
pliance with our anti-discrimina
tion policy as long as a school is
being forced to do so, and this ex

ception applies only to the military.
And in addition, the school takes
ameliorative action." Valdes said.
These actions, which include
promoting an active lesbian and
gay student organization and an
openly gay faculty and staff, are de
signed to help soften the damage of
the military's discrimination.
The financial cost has been more
than most schools can absorb. Al
though not every school has been
approached by the military, all that
have, except New York University,
have allowed access, including the
law schools at Yale University.
Duke University and UC-Berke
ley.
NYU decided it had sufficient
endowments to give financial aid to
students without the government's
help.
Pelletier explained that the
amendment purposely tied non
compliance with funding, rather
than mandating compliance, so
schools have a choice if they want
to continue to receive federal aid.
Broaddus found the tying of dis
crimination to financial incentives
as an attempt to reach beyond the
military's domain.

"It's ridiculous for the govern
ment to hold hostage the opportu
nity for students based on discrimi
nation," Broaddus said. "Basically,
it's a bribe."
So far, the Law School has been
able to avoid making any financial
or policy decisions. In the fall, the
military agreed to interview law
students at the CPPC, which Brest
deemed as not technically at the
Law School, hut the interviews
never took place because of sched
uling conflicts.
"Last fall, they were perfectly
content to recruit at the CPPC, not
at the Law School." Brest said.
"Our policy only concerns using
Law School facilities."
Brest emphasized that because
of the technicality of the Law
School versus the CPPC, he has not
had to make any decisions yet.
"At the moment, there has
never been a determination about
whether the military policy violates
the Law School's regulation," Brest
said.
How long this technicality will
appease the military is unknown.
The military is in communication
with 44 law schools, including Stan

ford, that are suspected of not com
plying with the Solomon Amend
ment.
"Currently, the Department of
the Navy is seeking clarification of
Stanford Law School's policy re
garding recruiter access," said a
spokesman for the Department of
Navy, Office of the Judge Advo
cate General.
Bill Carr. from the Office of the
Secretary of Defense, said, "If the
military is treated differently from
other employers and specifically
asked to not go onto the Law
School while other employers are
allowed on, that would probably
rise to a violation in the statute."
Another option for Stanford
would be to comply with the mili
tary while filing suit against the fed
eral government over the Solomon
Amendment.
"The First Amendment forbids
the government from regulating
speech in ways that favor some
viewpoints at the expense of oth
ers," explained Kelli Evans, of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
"If you don't like military recruiters
because you believe they discrimi
nate and you decide to protest

those acts by not allowing them on
campus, the Solomon Amendment
takes away all of your federal fund
ing. We would claim that abridges
the school's right to academic free
dom and of free expression."
Brest said that at this juncture,
the Law School has yet to decide
how it will proceed because it has
not yet determined whether "don't
ask, don't tell" violates school poli
cy.
Evans said there were a number
of universities contemplating a law
suit but no one has actually filed
suit.
"It would be a challenging law
suit to bring. These are very hard is
sues, and litigation against the gov
ernment is a big undertaking. Law
schools and undergraduate institu
tions are afraid. They are unwilling
to jeopardize millions of dollars in
federal funding, so they're unfortu
nately willing to capitulate."
Valdes, of the American Associ
ation of Law Schools, agreed that
"the tendency has been to back
slide. It has been the habit of school
to change their policies unthought
fully."
Outlaw members said they real

ize that military recruiting may be
inevitable, and they are lighting to
lessen the damage when it occurs.
At Stanford, this could include
hanging large disclaimer posters
that the Law School does not sup
port the discriminatory practices
and hosting informational panels
for the law student body about mil
itary policy, including members of
the military discharged for being
gay-
How well the heterosexual law
students will welcome the military
is still unknown. Numerous inter
views at the Law School found no
one with an interest in a military ca
reer.
If the military is at Stanford in
the fall, there are a number of gay,
lesbian and gay-friendly students
prepared to lill the recruiting slots,
and ihen announce at the beginning
of the interview that they are gay,
effectively negating the interview
and wasting the military's day.
"If the school is coerced, it
doesn't mean they must allow them
on friendly terms," Broaddus said.
"We want to make it an uncomfort
able environment so they won't
come back."
