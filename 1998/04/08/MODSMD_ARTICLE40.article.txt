# Not the whole enchilada
## Men's basketball removed from season sports passes 
### Justin Haugh 
The Whole Enchilada will soon
be missing a key ingredient: men's
basketball.
As of next year, the highly suc
cessful program will be removed
from the comprehensive season
ticket package.
Last year's Whole Enchilada in
cluded football, men's and women's
basketball, women's volleyball and
baseball season tickets for $99.
This time around, men's and
women's tennis, track, soccer, gym
nastics and golf have been added to
the package for a reduced price of
$75. Students will still have the op
tion of buying men's basketball sea
son tickets separately for $25.
According to Bob Carruesco, a
manager in the Department of Ath
letics, the change is a response to
"too much demand for too few
seats."
"Virtually every [Pacific 10 Con

ferencej game sold out" this season,
he explained, and most others were
close to full capacity. Demand for
men's basketball tickets will likely
be even higher next year, due to the
fame the Cardinal earned in its re
cent Final Four appearance.
Taking men's basketball out of
the package will increase the num
ber of season tickets available to
diehard basketball fans who don't
want to pay the full $99 for the En
chilada, Carruesco said.
Previously, the only certain way
to get tickets was to order the
Whole Enchilada, which was far
more expensive than buying the
basketball pass by itself. So many
season tickets were sold as part of
the Whole Enchilada that a limited
number of individual passes were
available when they went on sale
separately in October.
According to Carruesco, the
change is an attempt to solve an
"inventory and bookkeeping"

problem. Some fans bought season
tickets and then didn't attend
games, leaving empty seats in the
student section. Selling men's bas
ketball tickets by themselves should
more efficiently allocate seats, he
said.
The student section of Maples
Pavilion has 1.2(H) seats, out of a
total of about 7,()(X). If student sea
son tickets sell out, devoted fans can
buy regular tickets for $15 each.
"Students and the Sixth Man
Club are very important for men's
basketball." Carruesco said.
The decision will almost certain
ly decrease the number of ticket
packages sold, despite the reduced
price. Some students feel the Whole
Enchilada is no longer worth buy
ing. despite four other nationally
ranked athletic programs.
"1 would have bought it," said
freshman Peter Chang, "but with
out the basketball tickets. Enchila
da just isn't worth it."
