# A 						mix of culture and intellectual debate
## Native American Week in full swing on campus 
### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
This year's Native American Awareness
Week will supplement its traditionally cul
tural focus with discussion of intellectual is
sues relevant to the Native American com
munity.
The festivities, which began Monday,
represent a "huge collaboration" between
the Stanford American Indian Organization
and Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, the Native Amer
ican theme house, according to senior Ahtza
Chavez, an organizer of the event.
Participants are expected from through
out the Bay Area. "It is a celebration of our
selves and everyone around us," said sopho
more Enei Begaye, another organizer.
"Many people will join us for our activities."
The purpose of this week is to "let people
know we're out there and we're doing big
things even though we're a small percentage
of the population," she said.
Chavez explained developing awareness
is important because Native Americans
must often confront cultural stereotypes.
"We're this vanishing race," she said.
"The United States, with its policies and at
titude, always thought we would eventually
be assimilated. We're trying to make our
voice heard.
"You still get people who are very igno
rant about Native American issues. They
ask me questions like, 'Do you live in a tipi? 1
If these [Stanford students] are the cream of
the crop, just imagine what the rest of the
people think," Chavez said.
Many of Stanford's Native American stu
dents want to use their education to help
their tribes.
The speakers invited for the week are
meant to be role models for these students,
Chavez added.

Drew Lacapa, a White Mountain Apache
and famous stand-up comedian, will per
form at the Native American Cultural Cen
ter tomorrow at 7 p.m. with another comedi
an, Arapaho / Kiowa Chance Rush.
"His humor plays on all kinds of themes,
such as how everyone is related, being in the
city and modern multi-ethnicity. He's outra
geously funny," Begaye said.
For students like sophomore Roman
White-Runs-Him, a member of the Crow
tribe, Native American Awareness Week
makes it a little easier to be away from
home.
"I come from Lodge Grass, Montana," he
said. "Every year when Native American
Awareness Week rolled around, we'd have
parades and ceremonies around town. It's
nice to see that all of these things still happen
on a lesser scale at Stanford. It's important
that Stanford recognizes the culture that was
once predominant" in America.
Non-Native American students say they
have much to gain from the events as well.
"It's interesting to learn about different
cultures. The similarities between our cul
tures are really amazing," said Jesus Torres,
a Latino senior.

Chance Rush, Native American Cultural
Center, 7 p.m.
