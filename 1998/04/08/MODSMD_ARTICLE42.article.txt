Postponed business and confusion
on proper parliamentary procedure
highlighted last night's ASSU Senate
meeting.
The appointment of a new ASSU
financial manager for the next school

year, scheduled for last night's meeting, was delayed
until next week for undisclosed reasons.
A bill that would create an ASSU Alliance to Con
trol Tuition was tabled until next week for lack of a
correct version of the bill, while action on a senate re
form bill was also postponed with no finalized copy of
the bill available.
The graduate student body currently contributes
about 53 percent of the ASSU's general-fee funds,
which are intended to fund programming for all stu
dents. However, most of this money is now going to
ward undergraduate activities.
"A lot of money is coming from graduate students
but not coming back to them," said Robert Rudnitsky,
a member of the Graduate Student Council.
The bill would adjust the senate bylaws to change
the way general fees are allocated to graduate stu
dents. assigning 20 percent of the general fees to the
Graduate Student Council.
General fees are distributed by the Program Board,

Community Service Board and Publications Board.
The second bill concerning graduate students
would allocate $ 1 .(KM) of the senate discretionary funds
to the ASSU Task Force on Graduate Housing.
The money would be used to fund the publication of
the task force's final report to the administration and
go toward food for task force meetings. Food is essen
tial for graduate student attendance, graduate senator
Alane Murdock explained.
Each of these bills will be voted on at the ASSU
meeting next Tuesday.
In other business, recently resigned senate secre
tary Eric Friedman proposed a bill to change that po
sition from a paid to an unpaid one.
Friedman was paid a salary of $350 per quarter to
take the minutes at the meetings, a total which he esti
mated as about $70 per meeting. The text of the bill
states, "It is a disgrace to the senate to have so little
oversight of such sizable expenditures and waste the
students' money so blatantly."
ASSU President Emily Andrus introduced a bill to
place an amendment on the ballot for the probable
runoff election between the top two candidates for
ASSU president to be held in two weeks. The amend
ment would move the election of ASSU senators from
the spring to the fall and split the undergraduate stu
dent body into 15 voting districts, each electing one
senator.
This bill will also be voted on at the next meeting.
