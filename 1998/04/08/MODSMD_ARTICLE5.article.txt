Hepatitis A is a virus that causes
infection ot the liver and differs
from Hepatitis B. a sexually trans
mitted disease. Symptoms may last
for several weeks and include loss of
appetite, stomach ache, lethargy
and jaundice, the yellowing of mu
cous membranes or the skin. After
recovery, the person is immune to
Hepatitis A.
Hepatitis A is passed through
the oral / fecal route and is usually
spread through foods or utensils
contaminated by an infected per
son.
Precautionary measures include
extra care in hygiene, such as hand
washing after using the restroom
and before eating food, not sharing
personal items such as eating uten
sils or water bottles and not touching
food with bare hands.
"There is no known common
source for all this," Friedman said.
"It could be the dining facility, but
we have no proof of that."
