said.
"You've got to come through to
the best of your ability," Louie
said. "But more important, you've
got to go above and beyond the call
of duty."
Specific issues for the duo —
who are currently two of the four
junior class presidents — include
expanding hours at Old Union and
Tresidder Union, ensuring that im
portant decisions such as housing
changes aren't made without stu
dent input and keeping tabs on the
pulse of the student body through
surveys and leadership confer
ences.
Being seen as well as heard is es
sential to meeting these goals, Mar

Through a "Step Up, Step Out"
program in which he and Louie will
"step up" to their promises and
"step out" of the ASSU office to
campus residences. One way they
will do this will be through a picture
book of campus leaders and admin
istrators. T his will allow students to
better know who they can contact

about issues, Martinez said. Such
programs also will allow the admin
istration and various student
groups to work together to achieve
solutions, he added.
"The reason why the ASSU
hasn't been able to constructively
change anything is the fact of its
disorganization," Martinez said.
The student government must "in
crease its credibility with the ad
ministration," he said. "That's
something completely different
from just meeting with them."
To improve the ASSU execu
tive's credibility with students,
Martinez and Louie will establish
their presence and availability
from day one. Dorm outreach will
be an important part of the pack
age, Martinez said. Fie added that
they will seek out graduate stu
dents at their departmental convo
cations in the fall and through the
Graduate Student Council.
In addition to two years as class
presidents, Martinez and Louie
have served with groups ranging
from the Interfraternity Council to
the Founders' Day Committee. A
political science and urban studies
major focusing on community or
ganization, Martinez has been

president of Toyon Hall, a tour
guide and head Orientation volun
teer. Louie, an economics and po
litical science major, is an ethnic
theme associate in Okada and has
been an advising associate.
That experience will help make
the ASSU executive office an ef
fective organ for community build
ing, they said.
"I'm really proud of how we've
been able to bring diverse parts of
the campus together," Louie
noted.
The focus of their efforts will
likely be on-campus issues such as
housing, they said. Their bimonth
ly World Wide Web-based survey
of student opinion will allow them
to adjust their goals to what is most
important to the campus.
"We need an ASSU that's down
to earth." Martinez said. "We want
to reclaim the ASSU and bring it
back to the students."
Their promise of effectiveness is
based on past accomplishments, he
added.
"Let our diverse campus experi
ences, our past record of solid ac
tion ... and our solid commitment
from the start be able to say that we
will do the job exceptionally well."
