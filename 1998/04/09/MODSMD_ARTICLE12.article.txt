HI I I AS I. Northern Ireland
(AIM facing today's deadline to
solve a 30-yeai conflict, the British
and Irish prime ministers pursued
frantic shuttle diplomats yesterday
in negotiations on Northern Ire
land's I'u tu re.
"We have had 30 years of mur
ders and I think that what we need
to do in the next 24 hours is show a
determination among all parties to
make sure we see no more," Mo
Mowlam. Britain's Northern Ire
land secretary, said after a day of
agoni/ing negotiations.
today's deadline for a solution
for the British-ruled province was
set by George Mitchell, the former
U.S. Senate majority leader who
has overseen the peace talks in
Belfast since June IW6.
Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahem, i etui nine to Belfast after

attending his mother's funeral,
said an agreement "requires
everybody to move a little bit. and
I think we are all prepared to do
that."
Ahern and British Prime Minis
ter I'ony Blair focused much of
their attention yesterday on Ulster
Unionist leader David 1 limbic,
the support of his pro-British
Protestant party is essential to mak
ing any agreement work.
On I uesday, Trimble dramati
cally rejected Mitchell's 65-page
draft settlement just hours after it
was presented to the eight partic
ipating parties in hopes it would
form a foundation for an accord.
"Mere tinkering, minor amend
ments will not do it. I here will have
to be radical changes." said I l im
bic. who is using his pivotal role to
seek maximum concessions.

Mitchell's confidential docu
ment does outline key proposals
sought by the Ulster Unionists,
such as amendments to the Irish
Republic's territorial claim to
Northern Ireland.
But fundamental disagreements
remain over the main points of a
settlement how Catholics and
Protestants should share power
within a new Northern Ireland
assembly, and how much responsi
bility they should cede to a sepa
rate. cross-border council of law
makers linking the north with the
rest of Ireland.
The moderate and militant
wings of Catholic opinion â€” John
Hume's Social Democratic and
I abor Party, and Gerry Adams'
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party insist
the cross-border council must be
powerful and independent of the

Belfast assembly, which would have
a Protestant majority.
"1 want to make peace with Mr
Trimble. But we will not be intimi
dated by his stunts, his threats, or
his running scared to Tony Blair."
Adams said.
Hume, considered the main
architect of the peace process, said
that since nothing could be
achieved without Protestant politi
cians' agreement. "How can they
be out in public arguing that the\ 're
being subsumed ... into a united
Ireland against their will?"
Trimble said he would reject any
proposals that didn't respect public
opinion in Northern Ireland, a
Protestant-majority state created at
the behest of I Ister ( 'nionists 77
years ago as the largely Catholic
rest of Ireland won independence
from Britain.
