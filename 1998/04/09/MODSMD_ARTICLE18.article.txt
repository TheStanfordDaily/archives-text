RFs should inform
students that they have
access to grades

II WAS PROBABLY news to
ninny students that resident fel
. lows and Row office officials
receive students' grades.
However, the news should not be
cause lor alarm since such a policy is
legitimate for a number of reasons.
Nonetheless, greater attention should
be given to ensuring that students are
aware of the practice.
I It's justifiable that these residence
oTl'icials receive students' grades. After
all. the policy's to allotv for
greatei sensitivity to students' needs
primarily those of freshmen adjust
ing to life at Stanford.
As the I niversity officials responsi
ble foi providing guidance and support
in campus residences, resident fellows
and Row officials should be informed
about students' academic perfor
mance.
I his is because academic perfor
mance can be an indicator of personal
and social well-being. For many stu
dents, the dorm is a supportive setting
in which these issues can be most
efleetiveily addressed.
Students who live in campus hous
ing are part of a system designed to
serve their needs, and that includes
providing such University officials
with the means to understand and
meet those needs.
Because Rl s meet reeularlv with

resident assistants and generally have
more contact with dorm residents than
the residents have with their academic
advisers. RFs are in a good position to
notice problems that a student may be
having.
Ideally, the academic advising sys
tem would provide a comprehensive
support system and be involved
enough in students' lives to be able to
spot student problems.
We recognize, however, that the
advising system alone cannot cover all
aspects of a student's difficulties.
Because advisers are more removed
from students' daily lives than resi
dence officials, advisers often cannot
be as sensitive to specific circum
stances.
As such, RFs and Row house offi
cials can serve as a safety net to spot
problems overlooked by the advising
system.
Furthermore, students have the
option of requesting that their resi
dence officials not see their grades.
We advise that RFs uniformly
inform their residents during the first
house meeting of the year about the
practice of reviewing grades, so that
students can exercise the option to not
have their grades viewed, if they
choose.
It is certainly justifiable that RFs
and Row house officials have access to
their residents' grades. But the policy
should be made more explicit. If peo
ple other than academic advisers are
going to be monitoring academic per
formance, then students should be
fully informed about it â€” and not just
in the fine print.
