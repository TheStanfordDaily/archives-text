## A
						vegetarian, just because ... 
### 
I WISH I had a good
reason for being a
vegetarian.
When people ask me if
I'm a vegetarian. I simply
say "yes." What I 'd really
like to say is. "Well. I
sometimes eat fish, but
that's usually just with my

family because my parents get offended if
I don't eat what they've cooked. Plus. I'll
eat marshmallows and Jell (). and they
contain gelatin, which is made out of bones
and horse hooves. And if I'm on an air
plane and I forget to order a vegetarian
meal. I'll eat what they put in front of me.
And if you dangle a piece of shrimp dim
sum in front of my nose. I will bite. So it's
really red meat that I stay away from. Usu
ally."
Ihat. however, is probably a longer
answer than what people are willing to lis
ten to. so I let them think I'm vegetarian
instead of a "vegetarian minus minus."
There are just so many reasons out there
for being a vegetarian that I can't wholly
relate to.
If I were a vegetarian for health reasons,
then I would exercise more. I'd also be able
to resist things like ice cream, which is why
I wouldn't make a good vegan.
If I were a vegetarian for moral reasons.
I wouldn't be wearing shoes made out of

leather. Plus. I'd be able to spout statistics
such as. eating animals wastes l X) percent of
the energy that would be obtained by
directly eating the plants fed to the animals.
I'd probably also be a vegan.
If I were a vegetarian for religious rea
sons not necessarily due to the fact that I
subscribe to a religion prohibiting the con
sumption of meat, but that I abstain with a
religious fanaticism â€” I'd insist on having
separate facilities in my house for the
preparation of meat products.
If I were a vegetarian for trendy reasons,
I wouldn't be a vegetarian. I'd be a vegan.
I don't even have a psychological reason,
like a friend of mine in junior high who
wouldn't eat red meat after her summer
camp took her on a field trip to a slaughter
house.
It's not that I have an aversion to the
taste or smell of meat, or get offended when
people around me are diving into cooked
animal flesh.
It's also not that I have an unwavering
devotion to soybeans, lentils, tofu, seitan,
nutritional yeast, textured vegetable protein
or tempei (especially not tempei).
It's not because I think it's incredibly
ironic that by eating animals you increase
your risk of developing life-threatening
conditions like heart disease. (Somewhere
up there, all the KFC chickens you ate are
cackling their heads off when vou kick the

bucket.)
Actually. I am a vegetarian out of habit.
Because freshman year I wouldn't touch
Roble dining service's olive-colored meat
and chicken with feathers still stuck on it.
Because for the next two years. I lived in a
vegetarian / vegan co-op. Because I'm lazy,
and you have to make sure meat is well
cooked before you eat it. Because I'm para
noid and think that I'll get salmonella every
time meat juices get on a chopping board.
Because I'm inflexible.
I may be a vegetarian for a lack of good
reasons, but it still has the same effect. For
the health nuts. I'm not putting hormones in
my body. For the moralists, a cow's life is
still saved. For the religious, I'm not con
taminating their space. For me, it's just what
feels natural.
It's difficult to put a label on someone
for what he or she does or does not eat. Just
as I don't think that people eat meat
because it comes from a dead animal, you
shouldn't assume that I'm out to save the
earth just because I'm a vegetarian.
Although if you ask me. I might say that I'm
out to save the earth because explaining
why I'm not could take all day.

thought and literature, would like to dedi
cate this column to all the fruits and vegeta
bles she has known.
