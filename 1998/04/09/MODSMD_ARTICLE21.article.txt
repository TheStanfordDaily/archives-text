I was pleased to read the editorial in
I he Daily on April ft about the Web ver
iion of Axess.
A number of people have worked very
lard to bring Web Axess into existence,
uul it was good to see that their efforts
lave been well received.
I he editoii.il made suggestions about
uture directions lor Axess. A number of
irojects are currently under way.
112 or instance, the housing function that
■ indents will be using for their housing
issigiiments next tall will include the fol
owing features: the ability to update
hoices. access to the Draw number earli
•r and a new priority system for graduate
tudents.
In addition, new functions should be
ivailable next fall.
Students will be able to declare their
najors through Axess. and undergraduate
tudents who have filed a registration
oniniilmcnl will be able to annul their
onimitment up until the second day of
lie quarter via Axess.
We do hope to extend the hours that
i\css is available in the near future. A't
leserit. wt arc still line-tuning the Web

version of Axess. Once we are assured
that the system is functioning smoothly,
the hours can be lengthened.
There will always be a need to take
Axess down for some time during the
early morning hours because of other pro
cessing that needs to take place.
However, we do expect to have Axess
available lor even more hours than the
current K a.m. to midnight schedule.

Daily should not endorse
presidential candidate
On Tuesday, the editorial page of The
Daily will endorse an ASSU presidential
candidate and various special fee groups.
These endorsements are generally well
thought out and serious, but they also
should be taken with many grains of salt."
With this statement, Nick Thompson
(ASSU vice president IWft l >7) opened a
letter to the Stanford Daily last year
regarding the effect of the Daily's
endorsements.
This year, we find ourselves in the same
position. Questions have already been
raised regarding the ambiguity of the

Daily's special-fee endorsements.
Hut what about the biggest endorse
ment of all? ASSIJ president? It is clear
that The Daily has every right to publish
an endorsement, but should they? As the
primary (and. most would agree, only)
campus news source. The Daily's editorial
staff finds itself in a unique position
Its personal preference for ASSI' pres
ident gets published 13.5(H) times and dis
tributed all over campus on the day before
the election.
I hat number effectively matches the
maximum number ol fliers a candidate for
ASSI J president can make under current
ASSI J election rules.
Therefore, the slate that secures the
endorsement automatically doubles its
campus presence.
Think that Stanford students are smart
enough to make their own decisions, their
own choices?
We would all hope so. but for at least
the last three elections, the candidates
endorsed by I he Daily have won the elec
lion.
"OK." you say. "but they were obvi
ously the most qualified candidates." In
the past, candidates sal down with the
endorsement board and chatted for 30
minutes or so about their platform.
In an attempt to. perhaps, objectify I he

Daily's process a bit more, the candidates
are now required to present their platform
in 30 minutes with no more than five over
heads and two Excel spreadsheets
explaining their proposed budget.
They are then grilled on the specifics of
their platform and the feasibility of their
program. In this attempt. The Daily has
overcorrected.
The ASSU president has power
because he / she is a representative of the
students.
A candidate who wants a serious dis
cussion of important issues will have no
more (and. granted, no less) access to Peo
ple In Charge, or credibility with those
people, than you or I would.
And any attempt to fabricate a budget
is simply an exercise in futility. The over
all effect is a lot of wasted time and effort
on both the candidates' and the board's
part.
And the past results of the endorse
ment process? One president who's two
greatest accomplishments were spending
all of his allotted money on mono
grammed Post-It notes and choosing the
aforementioned Thompson as his vice
president. And another who failed to meet
her only major campaign promise, a Big
Ciame bonfire (though, to her credit, she
did try).

My point is simple — for all of the
alleged time that The Daily's editorial
board spends on making its endorsement
decision, it has no way of knowing, any
more than you do, who will make a good
ASSU president.
So please. Daily, stick to the objective
candidate profiles that serve their purpose
well. Air the issues, let the students make
a decision, and don't abuse your power
over the "captive audience" that is your
readership.
And students, please, ignore what The
Daily has to say. Don't even read Tues
day's edition until you vote the next day.
If you want to know the issues and the
candidates, read the Election Handbook
and talk to the candidates.
They'll be more than visible for the
next week, and I am sure that they would
all be happy to talk to you.
