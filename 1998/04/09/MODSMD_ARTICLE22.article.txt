# Bordering on slander
## Suppressing the involuntary shudder 
### 
T. J. Babbitt

I I HOUGHTTHATI had sex all figured
out. Then 1 saw a television commercial,
and that changed everything.
What I thought 1 had figured out was
everything 1 needed to know about sexual
health, which for me was basically how to
avoid AIDS and pregnancy. That's pretty
easy to do with the right tools. It hardly mer
its a second thought.
So it really surprised me how much this
commercial scared me. It was about an
aspect of sexual health that is much less cer
tain.
Plus, the ad itself was bizarre. Even though
it was produced by a drug company, it was
filled with sexual imagery. It depicted a happy
couple flirting over dinner, doing the tango
across a dance floor, walking hand in hand
down the beach, embracing.... All this, even
though one of them has genital herpes!
The narrator reminds the viewers that
some enormous number of Americans have
genital herpes. Some studies have estimated
that between one-fifth and one-fourth of all
American adults carry the virus. Widespread
condom use does not seem to have been

effective in halting its spread.
This is a real risk. I thought to myself as I
watched the commercial. It's not some far-off
possibility like dying in a plane crash or get
ting AIDS. What is to be done? How can I
avoid the fate of the couple in the commer
cial? I realized 1 didn't have a clue about how
one gets infected.
I suspect this is common. Our generation
has had its head filled with HIV and preg
nancy prevention information to the exclu
sion of almost everything else. We know that
using dirty needles and having unprotected
anal sex with strangers is completely unac
ceptable behavior. We know that simple
common sense can virtually eliminate the
risk of HIV infection, which in any case poses
a very low risk for most heterosexuals.
But I don't think we are fully aware of the
extent to which America has lost the war
against other sexually transmitted diseases.
There are two very common incurable
and frightening STDs: the herpes simplex
virus (HSV), which causes genital herpes,
and the human papiloma virus (I II'V), which
causes genital warts.

Alter realizing my cluelessness, I began
reading the health section of the newspaper,
and I learned surprising things. Some good
news, but first the bad:
Condoms are good for some things, but
they have not been effective in halting the
spread of either HSV or HPV. This is
because HSV and IIPV are largely skin
infections.
As with herpes, the statistics for HPV are
worrisome. Do/ens of strains have been
identified, and some studies indicate that
about three-quarters of all American adults
carry at least one. Statistics are hard to inter
pret. but it seems that the prevalence of both
diseases is increasing.
Needless to say, this is all terrible news. It
would seeni to indicate that virtually every
sexual encounter is fraught with risk. This is.
in fact, true — no matter what precautions
we take, sexual contact with a new partner is
very likely to bring us in contact with these
viruses. Since infection can often be asymp
tomatic. there is virtually no way to certify a
prospective partner as disease free. And
often, we will decide to have sex with the new

partner anyway, out of love, lust or some
other human emotion.
Hut that, I think, was the scariest subtext
of the commercial: it you get one of these
STIX maybe people won't want to have sex
with you anymore. (Unless, of course, you
buy the new drug from Glaxo-Wellcome:
then you get to do the tango with a sexy part
ner. )
I admit that I'd have second thoughts
about jumping into bed with someone who
had just told me they had 11SV or HPV. But
is that justifiable?
First of all. such a large percentage of peo
ple are already infected most without
knowing it — that it would hardly be an
effective strategy for avoiding infection.
Also, it's hard even for a hypochondriac
like me to argue that HSV and HPV are the
end ot the world. Only some people with
HSV and HPV ever show symptoms. A large
number have symptoms once, with no recur
rences. Most people with these viruses are
never diagnosed and have never recogni/ed
their minimal symptoms as manifestations of
disease. Onlv a relatively small minority has

frequent or major recurrences. (They, of
course, were the targets of the drug commer
cial.)
Maybe HIV has put other STDs in their
place. Maybe they are just not worth worry
ing about. Eliminating risk within the context
of a normal young adult's sex life is impossi
ble. but maybe it doesn't matter very much.
Don't get me wrong. I still think these
viruses are yucky. I'm glad I don't seem to
have either of them, though of course the
laek ol apparent symptoms is no guarantee.
( That makes these STDs a dream come true
for paranoid people like me.) At the end of
the da\. though, there are worse problems to
have and better things to worry about than a
skin infection.
Next time I see that commercial. I vow to
suppress the involuntary shudder that goes
down my spine Sure, sex is risky, but as long
as vou take the proper precautions to avoid
death and pregnancy, you're not nskmg any
thing truly important.
