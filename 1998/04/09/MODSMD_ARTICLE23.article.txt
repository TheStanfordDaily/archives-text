In a late afternoon doubleheader
against perennial rival Santa Clara,
12th-ranked Stanford softball si
lenced the Broncos in convincing
fashion 3-0 and 5-1.
The Cardinal bats, which were un
characteristically quiet last weekend
in Oregon, came alive in the brisk air
at the Stanford Softball Complex.
Stanford (27-8,6-4 Pacific 10 Con
ference) also benefited from excel
lent pitching performances by juniors
Marcy Crouch and Becky Blevins.
"1 think the team did a good job of
coming out focused against Santa
Clara," said senior Jessica Schulman.
"It is always tough to get up for non
conference games, so it was gotxJ that
we came out to play.
"However, while we managed to
score some runs early, we could have
scored more rather than sitting on our
lead."
Sophomore catcher Kellie Wigin

ton led the Card with her strong hit
ting. She was 5-for-7 on the day with
one run scored and a double.
"Kellie was awesome today."
Schulman said. "Her five hits really
provided a spark for us when we
needed it."

ball hard for the past month or so,"

when she didn't reach base, she
smacked the ball pretty hard."
