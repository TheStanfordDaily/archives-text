# Weenies awaiting powerful Cardinal
## 
### Michaela Crouch Staff writer 
With all its league games com
peted, the fate of the Stanford
men's volleyball team in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation tour
nament is out of its hands.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal (14-7,
13-6 MPSF) is currently tied with
No. 7 Long Beach State (18-6, 10-6)
for second place in the MPSF's Pa
cific Division.

M Tonight: No. 6 Stanford (14-7, 13-
6 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) vs. California (8-2), 7 p.m.,
Burnham Pavilion

The 4 l )ers have three conference
matches remaining in their regular
season. Wins in all three would give
it the second-place spot and home
court advantage in the first round of
the playoffs.
That would leave the Cardinal to
facc either top-ranked lICI.A (22-3,
15-2) or third-ranked Pepperdine
(18-3, 15-2) in the first round.
" If Long Beach loses any of these
matches, Stanford clinches the sec
ond-place spot and will play fifth
jftnked BYU (14-5,12-5) at home in
the first round.
"We have two weeks to prepare
for our [first-round playoff] match
and to improve our individual and
team play," Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves said.
Tonight's match against Califor
nia — at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion
— is one of the Cardinal's remaining
two games this season. Neither has
any impact on Stanford's postsea
son play, so Nieves considers them
"two good practice matches."
Tonight's opponent is not an

NCAA member. The Bears (8-2
Northern California Collegiate Vol
leyball League) have a club team, so
the match is not sanctioned by the
NCAA and will not affect the Car
dinal's record.
Stanford has faced off against the
Bears about 50 times in the past 25
years, but Cal has never been able to
defeat the Cardinal.
Tonight marks the second time
this season that Stanford has faced
the Bears. In February, the Cardinal
was victorious in a four-game battle
15-4. 12-15, 15-6, 15-9. A major fac
tor for Stanford was sophomore
outside hitter Josh Palacios, who hit
.655 (22-3-29) that night.
Stanford also saw productive
evenings from senior outside hitter
Devin Poolman and junior outside
hitter Patrick Klein. Klein lead the
Cardinal with 24 kills, while Pool
man fell in just behind with 23.
In that match, Stanford played a
combination of starters and re
serves, a mix the Cardinal will likely
employ again tonight as well as in a
Saturday night match with UC-
Santa Cruz.
"We're planning on playing a lot
of different players over the course
of the two matches," Nieves said.
"We'll likely play at least 12 players
but probably more than that."
Cal currently ranks second in the
Division 1-North Division of the
Northern California Collegiate Vol
leyball League. The Bears became
league champions last week in their
conference tournament, defeating
Sacramento State 3-0.
Stanford hopes to slow down a
Cal star, senior outside hitter Pat
Aparicio. When not contained,
Aparicio has the ability to become a
factor in any match. The competi
tiveness of recent Stanford-Cal
matches has reflected consistent
with the play of Aparicio.
In February's match. Aparicio
had 30 kills, hut the Cardinal was
able to slow his attacking power at
key times through strong blocking
and digging.
"We won't set out to stop him,"
Nieves said, "but rather to slow him
down."
