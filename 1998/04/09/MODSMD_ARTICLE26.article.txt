Stanford also beat I JS( " and IJCLA last weekend, but it was not as significant of a vic
tory for the Card. Cal swept those matches for the first time in 25 years.
"I was very concerned about rebounding after two tough matches this weekend, and
1 was also very concerned about Cal coming off of two big w ins over USC and UCLA,"
Ciould said.
In Monday's play, which began with doubles competition, all three of Stanford's dou

hies teams had stunning victories over the Cal pairs.
Gould said sophomores Mike and Bob Bryan had a routine 8-5 win over Minh l .c and
Erik Dmytruk hut that there was a "superb effort at No. 3 doubles and also at No. 1 dou
bles."
At first doubles, senior captain Paul Goldstein and junior Ryan Wolters defeated a
tough Bobby Mahal and Nathan Jackmon duo 8-3. In the No. 3 spot, sophomore Geoff
Abrams and senior Charles Hoeveler blew by Scotty kint/ and Adrian Barnes of ( al
with an impressive 8-0 score.
Gould was particularly impressed with Hoevelcr's performance, saying he played
"outstanding tennis, some of the best doubles play I've seen.
Each singles player had a score of 4-<). 4-1, or 5-0 within the first 20 minutes of play
At first singles. Mike Bryan easily defeated Mahal in two sets 6-1. 6-2. Earlier this
year. Goldstein defeated Mahal with a similar score of 6-2. 6-1 And Bob Bryan had an
easy time with Jackmon. winning 6-3,6-2.
At third singles. Wolters earned a quick victory over Gal's Le 6-0. 6-3. but doubles
partner Goldstein struggled against Kian Kaiszadch. Goldstein easily Ux*k the first set
6-0 but quickly dropped the sea in d set 2-6. Goldstein was down two service breaks 0-3
in the third set before roaring back for a 6-3 victory .
Gould said he was very pleased with Goldstein's play as well as his determination.

Earlier this season Bob Bryan backhands a return.
Monday. Bryan easily disposed of his Cal oppo
nent, helping the Card stay undefeated.
Goldstein "deserves a lot of cred
it for not giving up in a seemingly
hopeless match." (iould said.
Freshman Alex Kim also strug
gled against Cal's David Sutton,
eventually winning in three sets 6-1,
1 -6,6-3. Abrams rounded out the sin
gles competition with a victory over
Pmytruk 6-1,6-2.
Rankings released Monday still
places Stanford at first in the nation,
and each Stanford starting singles
player remains in the top 75.
Monday's 7-0 win only adds to
Stanford's outstanding results so far
this season.
"I thought the match would be a
tremendous test, especially at Cal's
home courts," Gould said.
What was supposed to be a chal
lenge turned into a blowout in
Berkeley.
"If you just looked at the score
board at Cal, you could get an idea of
how overwhelming the win was,"
Gould said. "It was a great team
beating a good team on their home
courts. I could not have been more
pleased."
