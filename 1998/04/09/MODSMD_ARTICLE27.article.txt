Tuesday, S( BN became the first
college television network not fund
ed hv a local access system to air 24-
hour programming.
Its capacity to do so has been
made possible by a contract with the
College Television Network, a sub
sidiary of CNN.
SCBN will now be able to oper
ate using formalized program
ming.
"Before what we had been doing
was popping a tape in with a show
when it was scheduled to air." said
senior Tudor Havriliuc, SCBN's
station manager.
"With this new programming
scheme, we can have shows that run
on the hour and half hour," Havrili
uc said.
Some new, student-produced
shows scheduled to premiere in the
next few weeks include "SCBN
News" and the "Andre Show,"
which will explore useful topics for
the college student, such as adjust
ing to a new roommate and plan
ning summer vacation.
New programming will join a
lineup of SCBN mainstays, such as
the cooking show "It's All Good,"
hosted by the La Maison Franchise
cook, the comedy show "The Oval"
and"The Call-In Show" before
Teleflicks on Saturday nights.
Havriliuc said the number of
movies offered through Teleflicks
will increase.
The expansion in programming
will ensure no reruns in a 24-hour
period.
The programming will generally
be associated with on-campus
events. For example, in accordance
with this week's Islam Awareness

Week, SCBN will air programming
that deals with issues important to
Stanford's Muslim population. As
part of AIDS Awareness Week,
SCBN plans to show "It's My
Party," a film about a man diag
nosed with HIV.
Starting in August, a satellite sys
tem will be installed that can down
load local and international news.

sports and entertainment â€” all
geared toward college students,
Havriliuc said.
"These shows will be aimed at
the Stanford student," he said.
"Some of them will be done in a
M TV-style format.
"The news anchors will be
younger; basically it's designed for
college students."

Students at SCBN are volun
teers.
With the new affiliation to
CNN, Havriliuc predicts an in
crease in contacts and a greater
chance for internships for student
volunteers.
SCBN plans on assessing student
response to the new programming
through phone polls.
