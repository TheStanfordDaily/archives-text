# New student news program looks for the human angle
## 
### Ritu Bhatnagar Contributing writer 
A half-hour news magazine
show will premiere on SCBN Sat
urday at 10 p.m.
Tentatively called "SCBN
News," the student-run program
will feature human interest sto
ries based on events, groups and
people on campus.
This is the first time in about 10
years that Stanford has had a stu
dent-run news show. Executive
producer Ryan Medders, a se
nior, has been working on the
show since last summer, with the
intentions of adding a new media
source to Stanford and giving stu
dents experience in broadcast
journalism.
"We're hoping [the show] will
add to Stanford and that people
working on it can learn about cre
ating a television news show."
Medders said.
"SCBN News" producers are
hoping to present stories with a
human element in a feature-type
format rather than a hard news
one.
For example, this week's pro
gram will include features on the

Ram's Head spring musical
"Chess," Sorority and Fraternity
Rush and a profile of the men's
tennis team.
"Not many things happen on
campus that require a hard news
angle," Medders said. "That's
why we're using a human ap
proach to our stories."
If an important news story
arises, the show hopes to use a dif
ferent angle in reporting — one
with more of a human perspective
— to differentiate it from other
media sources.
Although "SCBN News" will
cover opinions on campus and
controversial issues when they
arise, the show does not have any
political position or affiliation,
Esberg said.
"We plan on looking at issues
that are relevant to all students,"
said freshman Sarah Esberg, the
show's associate producer. "But
there is no slant on it: we have no
liberal or conservative position.
We don't want to be propagating
any issues."
Filming of "SCBN News" —
completed in advance early Sat
urday evening — is done at the
studio in theToyon Eating Clubs,

and on location. The show's pro
ducers are currently awaiting the
arrival of a new production sys
tem, which will enable them r6'
use more technologically sophis
ticated methods, such as a green
screen that places an image be
hind the speaker, like in weatlYer
reporting.
At this point, about 20 under
graduates are involved with
"SCBN News," which is headed
by lead anchor Alice Chang, a se -
nior.
Students involved with the
show are volunteers, and anyone
interested is welcome to join.
The students already involved
said they were drawn by the
unique opportunity. "I've been
interested in broadcast news, and
working for SCBN is like having
an internship in news," Esberg
said.
"It helps me to explore that in*
terest."
The show's producers hope to
ensure its longevity by making It
an interesting and fresh program.
"We're there for the Stanford
community as a resource and fa
an educational tool," Meddeijs
said.
