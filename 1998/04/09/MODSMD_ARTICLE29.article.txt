team will put its unbeaten league
record to the test this weekend
against rival California.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
■ Saturday: Stanford (7-5.6-0 West
ern Women's Lacrosse League) vs.
California, 1 p.m.. New Maloney
Field

Only two league games remain
for the team (7-5, 6-0 Western
Women's Lacrosse League), and
both are key in determining rank
ings for the upcoming playoffs.
The first game against Cal will
be at Stanford's New Maloney
Field starting at 1 p.m. Saturday.
The following weekend, the UC-
Davis Aggies will host Stanford.
The Cardinal is coming off an in
tense training and playing tour on
the East Coast. The spring break
tour readied the team for its quest
to prove that it can play at a higher
level.
"I think this weekend is a big
game in terms of our really proving
that we are of a different caliber
than the rest of the teams in Cali
fornia." said junior team captain
and attack wing Carev Jones.

The Cardinal faced several of
the tougher East Coast teams while
on its trip. While the games were
difficult, they offered Stanford es
sential experience to take into the
last stretch of the season.
It is not hy accident that the last
games of the league schedule are
slated against Cal and UC-Davis.
These two teams pose the toughest
threat to the Cardinal within the
league.
Cal, though a traditionally
strong team, is not quite as solid as
it has been in the past. The oppor
tunity to claim the league title de
pends more on Stanford playing to
its potential than on the ability of
the opposition.
Stanford is ready both mentally
and tactically for the finale of its
season. Offensively, the team is
guided by leading scorers Dara Ka
plan (58 points) and Hedy Born (53
points), who are complemented by
a strong defense.
"We are peaking at just the right
time." said head coach Heidi Con
ner. "Our defense looks solid: our
attack looks lethal. Now we must
perfect our transition game. Stan
ford is ready and willing to reclaim
the [league] title that is deservedly
ours."
These last two league games will
also determine the seeding for the
regional playoffs. Winning the

league title will give the Cardinal
No. I ranking fur the divisional
playoffs.
Phis will be an advantage to
making the final tournament in
May. as only the top two finishers

of the divisional tournament will
advance
"Winning should he no problem
as long as we sta\ focused on the
game .ind are confident that we can
beat |< "all Jones said.
