## 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
Although recent and upcoming
changes to University buildings in
compliance with the Americans
witli Disabilities Act will have a
major impact for the disabled com
munity, students and administra
tors caution that there are still
many changes to be made before
the campus is hilly accessible.
Last week, a ramp at the Old
Union Clubhouse was completed,
allowing wheelchair access to Hillel
and the Native American Cultural
Center. A ramp at the Black Com
munity Services Center should be
completed by tomorrow.
As part of the I University's ongo
ing Capital Improvement Project,
houses in the ('owe 11 ( luster. Lagu
nita Court and parts of Escondido
Village will be made wheelchair-ac
cessible during the summer.
Alpha Sigma, A I C), Terra and
Whitman will be made accessible in
the Cowell ( luster, In Lagunita.
I Jjamaa and Eucalypti) will receive
changes, said Assoc. Director of
Housing and Dining Rodger W hit
ney.
Alpha Sig and AK) will become
houses for the Delta Delta Delta
and Kappa Alpha I heta sororities
in the fall.
Barnes, a mid-rise building in
Escondido, and a small number of
low-rise buildings for families, cou
ples and single students will also be
made accessible.
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk will be
made accessible as well, though this
is not part of C IP.
A donation made bv the Kim

ball family for an elevator in Kim
hall 1 fall will make the upper floors
ol the dormitorv accessible to dis
ahled students.
According to \\ hitnev. this pro
ject is current!) in the planning
stages, and he anticipates comple
tion of the Kimball elevator in the
summer or fall of WW.
"We want to be sure that the op
tions students at Stanford have for
living are also available to disabled
students," Whitney said.
He pointed out that a coopera
tive house, a self-operated house
and sorority housing will be accessi
ble in the Cowell Cluster In Lagu
nita. an ethnic theme house and a
four-class house will become living
options for disabled students
He noted that, in addition to

making a theme house an option
lor disabled students, the changes
would allow them to attend pro
grams put on at those houses
Another project in the planning
stages is improvement ol the public
spaces at Maples Pavilion Void

rector ol the ()l 1 icc ol Multicultural
Development and I niversitv
\l) A compliance officer. I lie num
ber of wheelchair seats and the ac
cessibility of rest rooms and o >nccs
sion stands may be altered this sum
mer.
"We're seriously putting togeth
er a formulation for that." (ion/a
lez said.
"I think it's great that the I m
versity is making these changes and
hopefully starting to realize that
making all programs accessible to
students is not a favor to students
with disabilities but is something
that we all deserve," said junior
Jessica Lehman.
Senior Lisa Connor agreed that
the University has been doing a
good job, but "it needs to stay the
course."
I he impact that changes in ac
cessibility have for disabled stu
dents cannot be understated.
1 lie new ramp at the Old Union
Clubhouse allowed Lehman to get
into Hillel, something she has
wanted to do since freshman orien
tation.
"It just feels really good to be
able to go there, see what's going
on and see what the community's
like," Lehman said. "You really
need to be able to get in the build
ing and hang out to join a commu
nity."
Bliss Temple, a coterminal stu

dent in Earth Systems who is cur
rently stopped out, said that "it's
made a really big difference that
disabled students have more access
to student life than we did before."
Before an elevator was installed
in the Fire Truck House last sum
mer, Temple and other disabled
students could not get inside the
Lesbian. Gay and Bisexual Com
munity Center.
"I now feel that 1 can be a part of
the queer community in a way that
I never could before," Temple said.
"It gives me the sense of belonging
and homecoming that I never had."
A ramp installed in the front of
Memorial Auditorium last summer
has meant that disabled students
no longer need to go in the building
through a side door.
"It's really a different experience
to go in with everyone in the front
and not have to ask someone to let
me in on the side," Lehman said.
Traci Powell, a doctoral student
in genetics, emphasized that mak
ing buildings accessible to the dis
abled is "not a gift or a privilege, it's
something that should have been
done a long time ago."
