BASEBALL
■ today: No. 1 Stanford (28-5-1,12-
> Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division) at California (13-21, 1-16)

Despite the fact that the Bears
(13-21. 1-lb) have experienced a
dreary IWB season. Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess expects a
challenge.
"I think they're a good team."
Marquess said. "Their record
doesn't indicate how good they are.
They're very talented, but they're
very young, so they're inconsis
tent."
Despite the inconsistency, the
Bears are "very capable of beating

anybody," he added, "because
they've got some very talented
young hitters, and they've got some
young pitchers."
Those pitchers include the no
table freshman duo of right-hander
Ryan Atkinson and lefty Jason
Dennis. Atkinson throws a stellar
split finger fastball, change-up and
slider.
Dennis, meanwhile, is noted for
his fastball, change-up and curve
ball and is scheduled to take to the
mound during the weekend series
against the Cardinal.
"With freshmen, sometimes you
get them when they're not so good
and then other days they're just
great so they're very dangerous,"
Marquess said. "We're very con
cerned about them because they
are very talented."
Stanford's squad provides a
study in contrasts as it is dominated
by the experience of veterans, in
cluding junior aces Jeff Austin and
Chad Hutchinson.
The Cardinal also has benefited
enormously from the hitting power

of sophomore first baseman John
Ciall (.374) and junior outfielder
Jody Gerut (.353).
Experience greatly aided Stan
ford in its remarkable six-game
sweep of the Bears during last
year's season, including one devas
tating 20-5 Cardinal blowout at
Evans Diamond.
"There's a little bit of a rivalry
there," junior third baseman Josh
Hochgesang noted.
"1 know they talked to a lot of
the other teams, and 1 think they're
figuring out how to pitch us. so
they're going to be throwing a lot of
off-speed pitches this weekend to
keep us off-balance.
"It'll be a good test for us as far
as hitting goes."
The matchup will offer a mea
sure for the Cardinal's progress.
"We've been struggling as a
team just a little bit to keep the
tempo up and keep playing our
style of baseball," Hochgesang said.
"But I think this weekend we'll
come out and start playing the way
we're capable of doing."
