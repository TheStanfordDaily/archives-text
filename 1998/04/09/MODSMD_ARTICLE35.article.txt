# Joy of the job
## Combining study with full-time job fulfilling, if not restful 
### Jennifer Godwin Contributing writers 
A typical full day for a Stanford student
consists of seven hours of sleep, four hours
of class and four hours for meals, exercise
and showering. This leaves about nine
hours for television, socializing, and of
course, homework. Most students cherish
this well-deserved "free" time with a cushy
10-hour a week campus job.
However, some adventurous Stanford
students take a full load of classes and
work a full-time job, throwing in a 40-hour
work week on top of the obligations of
school, homework, friends and basic sur
vival needs like food, sleep ... and well,
sleep. Senior Kimberly Axelrod and coter
minal student Michael Elisofon have both
had full-time off-campus jobs and felt that
these jobs have enhanced their social life.
Axelrod. an English major, has been
waiting tables at California Pizza Kitchen
since her freshman year. Since then, she's
added staff training to her duties at the
restaurant.
"Usually what I would do is go in at 7:30
p.m. and teach a training class until 10:30
p.m. Then, I'd go to an 11 p.m. class," she
said. "I'd have class through the morning
and afternoon and then go back at night
and wait tables."

Axelrod felt that working was some
thing she was obligated to do since her par
ents pay for Stanford. She currently lives
off campus and pays for everything herself
except tuition.
"It's been like another family, another
support system," she said. "It's sort of re
placed the Res Ed system that I don't have.
That didn't really work for me.
"It's been nice because it's another so
cial life, and friends offcampusgowith the
social life and friends I have on campus,"
Axelrod added.
The attraction of a serious commitment
to a job can be the financial benefits, pro
fessional experience or personal enjoy
ment. Axelrod explained that part of her
commitment to her job is her positive rela
tionship with her bosses.
"I'm really committed to the manage
ment team. It's gotten to a point where
they're understanding if I need to take a
break and just kick back or (if I need to)
buckle down and really study."
Elisofon worked at Florentine's on El
Camino his sophomore year while taking a
full course load. Elisofon originally want
ed to work 20 to 25 hours a week, but as he
became closer to the staff, his work week
grew to 40 to 45 hours a week.
"I was really good friends with the peo
ple there, and it was a small staff," said

Elisofon who earned about $ l ) an hour.
"When problems occurred and people
quit, I was dependable, knew the system
and was the only one there to till in."
According to Elisofon, his work life be
came a routine, and he became close to the
managers. Even when his work day was
supposed to end at K p.m., he knew he was
going to hang out wilh the staff, so he
would often end up working until 11 p.m.
anyway.
Altera few weeks working there, Eliso
fon grew nonchalant about his school
work.
"I stopped trying to balance my acade
mic life with my life at Florentine's after a
while," he explained. "1 wasn't interested
in any of my classes at that time."
Elisofon persevered for over two quar
ters. He eventually quit the job although,
he admitted, "I loved working there."
I he nature of on-campus jobs are dif
ferent than the demands of outside work.
Among other things, the pay scale ranges
widely off campus, from a minimum of
$5.25 an hour to $15 an hour at positions
wilh commissions or highly-skilled office
jobs.
Axelrod adds, "There's a weird aura
about on-campus jobs, like you're not ex
pected to work during finals week. I think
that's unrealistic."
