# OBLIQUE! (literally)
## 
### Nitin Chopra 
When I agreed to review "Oblique," a new on
line journal of expression created by four
Stanford students, I figured I was in tor some cute
poetry and maybe a story or two. Instead, 1 got a
bizarre picture of a sofa, some audio files and a
few shocking, mini-length movies.
Oh, and there were poetry and stories, as well.
"Oblique" is an online art journal envisioned
and created by sophomores Doug Stillinger,
Kumar Narayanan, Peter Kinne and Paul

Kerschen. It goes beyond your usual run-of-the
mill journal, featuring not only poetry and prose
but also such varied mediums as film, music and
photography. Still in its infant stages, only one is
sue of "Oblique" has been released.
The creators were hallmates freshman year in
Lagunita, and they all shared a passion for cre
ation. The crew felt that, among themselves, they
had enough material for a pilot issue of some
thing — just what that something was, they
weren't exactly sure. Of course, there was always
the possibility of the usual magazine format, but
the group decided they wanted something bolder
than that. The group wanted to "push the limits
of what [theyl had available."
Through the World Wide Web, "Oblique" can
make use of many different mediums. The cre
ative mind can contribute virtually anything to
"Oblique," including paintings, songs and home
videos. In providing an outlet for all types of ere
ativity on one site, "Oblique" offers a variety that's
hard to obtain through a regular magazine.
When I asked for a mission statement, the cre
ators didn't offer anything hokey like "serving the
artistic needs of the Stanford community and be
yond ..." Instead, "Oblique" is about creating for
the sake of creation. Sounds noble enough, but I
felt like something got lost when I was looking at a
picture of an "Impending Sofa Tree." Just what type
of creation that was supposed to be, I wasn't sure.
What exactly are they creating? A poetry jour
nal? A short story collection? It's definitely a mix
of the two, plus paintings, sculptures and Legos
(think back to your childhood for this one). In
fact, the material at this site is refreshingly varied.
I have to admit that I had never seen two Lego
men do battle before. Stillinger, a double major in

product design and English, says that basically,
"anything goes — so long as it's good."
And they do have some good stuff. I especially
liked a poem on the site about the intensity of
Bombay, India.
Another entertaining feature of "Oblique" is its
ability to display different art forms at the same
time. While looking at a picture of an elf, I also
enjoyed an accompanying audio file that added
character to the whole display. It was a smorgas-

hord of art.
While there were a lot of things 1 liked, some of
the prose was a hit overdramatic. One particular
piece tried to comment on ethnicity, style and
disillusionment all at once.
If you haven't heard of "Oblique,' it is because
they've been pretty low-key so far. This group of
perfectionists didn't want to hype up their first is
sue, which was more of a prototype experiment
than a finished product. In fact, when 1 asked
them what their parents thought of the site, they
weren't even sure that all of their parents had seen
it. Their hig public relations push starts this week
with the release of their new issue. Kinne, a
graphic design major, is in the process of graphi
cally transforming the site's look to give it a more
exciting presentation, and the group is pleased
with their new issue.
To be sure, there have been many obstacles
along the way. The first time around, the audio
format they used resulted in files that were too
large for most browsers to accommodate. Also,
the first layout was a bit alienating. They had split
the material into three categories: "The
Sanguine," "The Phlegmatic" and"The Choleric
(remember high school English?). What they
found, however, was that their audience didn't
know what any of those words meant.
Stillinger said, "We're trying to find a balance
within a triangle of originality, cliche and intel
iectualism."
But tliers are out and e-mails have been sent —
"Oblique" is ready for the masses. This is defi
nitely a class act. You can, and should, check them

creative? loin the ranks of "Oblique" and become
a vanguard for online art!
