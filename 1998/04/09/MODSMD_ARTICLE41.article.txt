# For the garlic lover in you

Incredible as it may sound, The Stinking Rose restaurant
in San Francisco's North Beach puts garlic in every dish
it serves â€” it's even in the ice cream.
Garlic is a theme that the restaurant goes to great lengths
to promote: pictures of the herb plaster the walls, small gar
lic-bulb sculptures cover any visible shelf space, and wreaths
of garlic stream from the ceiling. The restaurant couid almost
be a garlic museum.
The Stinking Rose has become so popular since its open
ing in 1990 that the waiters take orders on digital notepads
that look like cellular phones. Despite this inhuman element
and the hordes of people waiting to eat, the waiters were sur
prisingly calm and friendly.
My friends and I started with the house special, "banya
calda," a roasted garlic that arrives simmering in olive oil in a
skillet. It's a dish that the restaurant pushes on its customers.
Our waiter suggested it before taking our drink order, and it
seemed as though everyone had a skillet on his or her table.
Rut it was a delicious dish that you won't find at many other
places. The garlic slid like butter onto steaming buttermilk
rolls. Priced at only $4 and large enough for four, it was a
great deal.
The entrees arrived before we could fully observe all of the
garlic decorations. The chicken with 40 garlic heads was not
spicy enough for a garlic-phile at our table. The garlic
mashed potatoes, which are served with all the entrees,
weren't too spicy either. The gnocchi and the lamb ravioli
were described as "interesting," but never quite "delicious." At
any other restaurant, the flavoring would be excessive, but it
seemed excusable at a place that's earned its fame precisely
for serving garlic.
If your palate for garlic has not been oversaturated by the
end of the meal, there is garlic ice cream. The tiramisu also
supposedly has the herb. Unless you feel consumed by the de
sire to have a three-course garlic meal, it's better to skip
dessert there and have it at one of

the pastry shops on Columbus
Avenue.
Your best bet is to order the
banya calda and save your appetite
for a restaurant that earns its keep
by serving good food rather than
over-the-top garlicky dishes. For a
restaurant that is as much an at
traction as it is an eatery, The
Stinking Rose does a good job of
keeping the service quick and
friendly. The dishes are nothing to
write home about, but the decor
and obsession with garlic is.
