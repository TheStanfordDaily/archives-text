# Looking for thrills?
## Great America offers a new ride and plenty of fun 
### Matt Bell 
Stanford is fortunate to he situated only 20
minutes away from Great America, the largest
theme park in the Bay Area. Now open on
weekends, it provides an avenue of escape from
the stress of academic life. There are seven roller
coasters, several water rides, smaller carnival
style rides, live shows and a children's area.
Every time Great America opens in the
spring, a new ride is added to the park. This
years addition is an innovative roller coaster
called Invertigo. Unlike conventional roller
coasters, in which riders sit atop the track,
Invertigo riders arc suspended below it. Also, the
seats are oriented face-to-face, allowing you to
watch the expression on your friends' faces dur
ing the ride. Because there are only two seats in
each row, everyone is guaranteed a good view of

the scenery while it whizzes by.
There are three inversions on
the track. However, halfway
through the ride, the coaster
stops and begins to traverse the
track in the opposite direction.
Riding backwards is very dizzy
ing and disturbing, since the
upcoming track is unseen. By
the end, riders have been up
side down a total of six times
and experienced forces five
times as strong as gravity.
Photos of the ride are available
afterwards, allowing you to im
mortalize your moments of terror.
On most coasters, multiple
trains can run on a single track,
allowing one train to be loaded

while the other one goes through the ride. But
because the Invertigo track is not a loop, only
one train can run at a time. This causes the line
to move quite slowly. However, the experience
justifies the wait.
Meanwhile, Great America also offers plenty of
other diversions.
The Drop Zone Stunt Tower raises you to a
height of over 200 feet, and then lets gravity
plunge you back down, providing just over two
seconds of weightlessness. We spend our entire
lives in the presence ot gravity; being released
from its influence, even for a short time, is a
strange and unforgettable experience. I no
longer felt my own weight, and my internal or
gans seem to float upwards. I wouldn't recom
mend eating before the ride.
For $20 and up (in addition to park admis
sion), you can go on the 1-xtreme Sky Flyer, which
essentially turns you into the bob of a giant pen
dulum. There is no seat; you simply put on a body
harness that is hooked to the end of a very long

swing. This setup allows you to get very close to
the sensation of flying like a bird.
Top Gun, one of Great America's most pop
ular roller coasters, is supposed to make you
feel as if you're flying in a jet plane. Like
Invertigo, Top Gun is a suspended roller coaster.
This allows the ride to have unusual maneuvers,

such as barrel rolls. This
twisting, looping ride is one
of the longest and most in
tense of any ride in the park.
There is also a new show in
Great America's IMAX the
ater. IMAX film is about 10
times the size of an ordinary
one, allowing it to be pro
jected onto a huge screen
while still maintaining incred
ible detail. The new show,
"Mission to Mir," focuses on
American astronaut Shannon
I.ucid's stay aboard the
Russian Mir space station. It
also talks generally about the
U.S.-Russia space partnership.
The film has the feel of a well-

crafted documentary; it is humorous and engag
ing while providing plenty of information.
The IMAX format is very well used in
"Mission to Mir" The full capabilities of the
sound system are demonstrated during the
scenes of rocket launches; the rumble of the
space shuttle taking off is literally loud enough
to shake the theater seats. The enourmous
screen makes the space shots of Mir and the
Earth from space even more breathtaking.
Unfortunately, since much of the movie con
sists of old footage that was not shot in IMAX,
some of that effect is lost.
Although Great America is not cheap and the
lines for rides are often incredibly long, it is def
initely a wonderful way to escape the world for
a day. A final word of advice: go as early as pos
sible to avoid the crowds.
