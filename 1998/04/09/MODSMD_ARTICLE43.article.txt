## Mary Stuart will ALWAYS fight over a man. 
### Jennifer Wang Contributing writer 
"Mary Stuart," the rarely performed
historical drama about the heated ri
valry between Queen Elizabeth I of
England and Mary Queen of Scots, is
the newest American Conservatory
Theater production.
Though the play is based on an epic
power struggle that took place in 18th
century England, the themes that arise
are relevant even in the modern era.
The theater's artistic director Carey
Perloff said, "This play is about the
very same questions we are wrestling
with today. It keeps pulling back the
veil to reveal the private drama behind
the public facade."
In light of the recent accusations
against President Clinton and the
growing concern over the private lives
of our government officials, Perloffs
comment rings true. Mixing personal
desire with political power, the play
highlights the dangerous combination

of sex, deception and
manipulation — a trio
that has become more
publicized than ever in
the media today.
A tale of politics, mis
guided love and religion
laced with espionage,

betrayal and murder, "Mary Stuart"
portrays the tenacious Elizabeth 1 as
she battles to defend Protestant
England against the trickery and de
ception of her charming and manipu
lative cousin Mary, an ally of France
and Rome.
Caroline Lagerfelt (Elizabeth) and
Susan Gibney (Mary Stuart) make
their company debuts as opposing
queens. The two stand in jealous com
petition with each other. They pursue
the same man as their lover, they com
pete to be the more beautiful rule and
they compete for the undisputed loy
alty of the English people.
Marco Barricelli plays the hand
some Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester
and the object of the rivalry between
the two domineering women. He is
continually forced to submit to their
whims. Between the imperious de
mands of the two women, his life is
turned into a juggling act of trying to
maintain his secret devotion to Mary
while publicly pretending to return the
fervent love that Elizabeth feels to
wards him.
Johnny Moreno, cast as the young
Mortimer, also plays a lustful closet
Papist who feigns allegiance to the
Protestant queen. He does so in order
to help rescue Mary Stuart from her
death sentence and the prison in
which she has been confined.
The play, which opened April 1 and

'This play is about the
very same questions we
are wrestling with today'

closes April 26, is a dramatic reimagin
ing of the historical feud between
Queen Elizabeth I of England and
Mary Queen of Scots. The acclaimed
German playwright, Friedrich Schiller,
actually invents a scene that never hap
pened, a personal confrontation be
tween the two quarreling queens.
Writing during a time of revolu
tionary passions in Europe and the
newly formed United States, Schiller
was widely recognized as the leading
playwright of his nation. His plays
tend to depict the conflict and turmoil
resulting from issues of political and
religious freedom, personal ambition
and public responsibility.
Michael Feingold's new modern
translation refines Schiller's verse to
make it come alive for 20th-century
American audiences. However,
Feingold successfully retains the power
of the original poetry.
Perloff stresses the difficulty of
achieving the smooth confluence of
several different time periods in both

language and staging. As
she explains, "This is not
Shakespeare — this is
Elizabethan England
seen through a pre-
Napoleonic, post-
Revolutionary, late 18th
century lens and then,

indeed, through the eyes of late 20th
century America."
In fact, nearly all aspects of the play
feature a merging of elements from
different time periods. The musical
score by David Lang echoes two styles,
one of the Renaissance period in
which the historical events actually oc
curred, and one of the Romantic pe
riod in which Schiller wrote his drama.
Ralph Funicello, the set designer,
works with the richly textured pillars
of Tudor England against gridlike im
ages which bring to mind Diebenkorn
paintings. The result is a background
that is at once simple and striking.
One of the best reasons to go watch
this play is the elaborate and intricately
detailed costuming done by Deborah
Dryden. The costumes incorporate
European and American styles span
ning several centuries.
The historical background of the
play is important. The drama is a
highly complex and subtle one.
Watching this production without any
understanding of the context of reli
gious and political conflict is a risky
gamble. For someone seeing the play
without any previous knowledge, the
first act will be very confusing and dif
ficult to appreciate.
Otherwise, the drama is enjoyable
for anyone wanting a compelling
glimpse into a different time period.
Those looking for fast-paced and high
excitement dramas are not advised to
go to this one.
