# Parents in trash cans and stuffed animals??
## Stanford theatre 
### Robin Moroney Editorial staff 
It is a day like all the others have been: the
parents are in the trash cans, the man in the
wheelchair is blind, his attendant enjoys
staring at the kitchen wall, and time itself
may or may not be on the verge of ending.
Samuel Beckett's "Fin de Partie," or
"Endgame," is stripped of plot and recogniz
able characters. These factors make it a diffi
cult play to pull off successfully.
The production in Eleanor Prosser Studio
last weekend managed to surmount many of
the play's challenges, and at its best, managed
to maintain the play's tragic obscurity with
out letting it become tedious and remote.
The play was performed in the original
French, and I hope the reader can forgive a
reviewer who gave up French five years ago,
leaving it skilled enough only to ask for ham
sandwiches and directions to the hotel. Yet
even for the less fluent audience member the
production can still be powerful. In terms of
comprehensibility, the play benefits little
from being performed in one's native tongue;
thus, the play's drama could affect the non-
French speaking audience member directly,
unmediated by Beckett's bare words.
Director Jean-Marie Apostolides, appar
ently acting under the pseudonym Paulin
Capron, put in a wonderful performance as
Hamm. Fie maintained a deadpan expres
sion and tone that at any moment could
convey exhausted tragedy or wrenching
comedy. By cruel, ridiculous and pitiful cir
cumstance, Hamm is blinded and confined
to a wheelchair. Yet Hamm insists on being
right in the center of the play.
Apostolides' delivery was cool and lilting
— his speeches like long sighs. Hamm's re
counting of his adoption of Clov was too
melodramatic, but no less effective for it. His
mood swings were perfectly timed and be
lievable. The scenes with the stuffed dog,
which Hamm deludes himself into believing
is a loving loyal pet, were wonderfully orches
trated. Hamm's inability to throw the dog
away at the end of the play was ridiculous,
funny and moving — as Beckett should be.
Joshua Landy's performance as Clov,
Hamm's friend and attendant, was less ac
complished but still entertaining. His stutter-

ing mechanical walk and his repeated diffi
culty with the stepladder had all the right
ideas, but Landy couldn't make his strange
ness seem natural enough to fit into this
bizarre world. His demented cheerfulness
complemented Hamm's melancholy well, and
his erratic physicality provided an excellent
counterpoint to his companion's immobility.
Hamm's parents, Nagg (Matthew Tiews)
and Nell (Marie H£l£ne Le Tuan) — who
live in trash cans and poke their heads above
the rims sporadically throughout the play —
were nicely rounded characters. There was a
tenderness to their arguments and com
plaints — a factor that was surprising and
welcome. Naggs joke, told in English, was
brilliantly recounted. However, the punch
line, which is one of the most difficult I
know to pull off, was underestimated and
accordingly thrown away.
The tenderness and intimacy between
them were emphasized by the lighting that
isolated them from the rest of the stage. This
had the advantage of presenting these char
acters for fresh consideration, as relations
apart from their blind son. However, this also
destroyed the bizzareness of the tableau —
man in wheelchair listens to people in trash
cans and nightgowns bickering over biscuits.
Apostolides' direction was accomplished.
While maintaining Beckett's rigid and ex
haustive stage directions, he still found room
to be innovative. The use of sound effects
was restrained and effective and didn't tam
per with the silence and stillness that Beckett
demands. Particularly effective was the
clamor of applause that accompanied Clov's
indication of the audience to Hamm.
The play was punctuated by brief musical
blackouts. Rather than signifying the passage
of time, these breaks provided a new rhythm
to the play that upset and confused the con
ventions of dramatic time.
This production genuinely had moments
where all of Beckett's staging difficulties were
overcome. Performing the French version of
Beckett's play may have limited the scope of
the audience, but good theater is more than
words. Indeed, "Fin de Partie" proved that
language is no obstacle to a good play.
