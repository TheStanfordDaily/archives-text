# And now for something completely different

Q: What do you get when you combine an '80s
rock concert, a tragic love story, Cold War politics
and a whole lot of enthusiasm?
A: "Chess," this year's Ram's Head spring musi
cal production.
The story of a Russian and an American vying for
the world chess championship, "Chess" was written
in the early '80s by Tim Rice ("Evita," "Jesus Christ
Superstar," "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor
Dreamcoat") with music composed by Bjorn
Ulvaeus and Kenny Anderson of the Swedish pop
quartet ABBA. Stanford's production stars Brandon
Singleton as Freddy Trumper (the American) and
Lisa Anfield as Florence, Freddy's second. Freddy's
rival, Antatoly Sergievsky (the Russian) is played by
George Hoffman. His second is Molokov, played by
John Chakan.
As I interviewed staff members and crew and
read up on "Chess," that famous Monty Python line
"and now for something completely different" kept
running through my head.
"Chess" is something completely different. I

don't know about you, but
when I hear the word "musi
cal," I think of Sunday mati
nees, of white-haired audi
ences, of flat slappy voices and
cutesy dance numbers. That's
just not "Chess."
As set designer Chris Sanders
put it, "Chess" is not your tradi
tional musical — it's modern,
it's sad, it's rock. This is not
"The Music Man."
The decision to perform
"Chess" follows a recent Ram's
Head trend away from more
conventional, popular shows

and toward lesser-known, but more interesting ones.
"After 'Guys and Dolls' in 1994, the shows se
lected for spring musical have been more different
and challenging — instead of just the same things
everybody did in high school. It's hard because
there's no name recognition for something like
'Chess' — it's not 'Oklahoma,' or something like
that, where everyone already knows about it. More
obscure shows are much harder to sell, but they can
create much more excitement," said producer
Christina Drake.
Last year's spring musical, "Fool's Dream," is an
excellent example. Written by a Stanford student,
"Fool's Dream" is about as obscure as musicals get
in terms of name recognition. Yet "Fool's Dream"
was a rare event in spring musical history in that,
unlike most other Ram's Head productions, it actu
ally made money. Why? Because people were ex
cited about it and told their friends, who got excited
about it and told others.
Drake hopes that this is what will happen for
"Chess." The staff's enthusiasm has infected the ac
tors, and hopefully they'll both infect the audience.
As far as I could see, her plan was right on.
Sanders was the epitome of infectious excitement.
By the end of the interview he had me crawling
around underneath the set, inspecting the boards
and constructions and totally pumped about every
thing. He convinced me that, indeed, "Chess" is
something entirely different.
"'Chess' is as much a rock concert as a play," he
said. "The draw is really the music and the show. I
mean, it all started as a concept album. The musical

ning to come from as far
away as Portland.

evolved out of the record. The plot is just there to
connect the songs."
That made sense to me. "Chess" is unique among
musicals in that some of its songs actually made it
onto the pop charts. "One Night in Bangkok" is an
old friend for those of us who grew up in the '80s.
It was a "Top Five Smash" in half a dozen European
countries and had two versions make "Billboard's
Top Ten" in this country. The ballad, "I Know Him
So Well," sung by Florence and Anatoly's wife,
Svetlana, was extremely successful, especially in
Britain where it occupied a space at the top of the
charts for four consecutive weeks.
So Sanders had a point — the music was incredible.
Great angle, I thought, and started writing my article.
But then I talked with ensemble member Alicia
McCann. "'Chess' is a love story," she told me.
Okay ... that's okay, most musicals are love sto
ries. My rock concert angle can still work. The plot
doesn't really matter anyway, right? "The story line
is really complex," says Alicia, as if she's reading my
thoughts. " 'Chess' is a successful, beautiful story
with depth and symbolism. The cheesy '80s music
makes it fun."
Heh, heh. Yeah, it's all about the plot, and the
music just makes it fun. Right. So 1 looked at the

plot. What basically happens is
that Freddy is a total asshole and
ends up pissing Florence off. She
and Anatoly start being lovers.
But then Svetlana, Anatoly's wife
,enters the picture and things get
crazy. Then there's a sad ending,
but I can't tell you that part or it
would ruin the surprise.
So sure, it's a love story. And
yes, the plot does get pretty com
plicated, especially with all the
Cold War politics. If I thought I
could avoid the political aspect of
things, I was wrong. The next
thing Miss McCann said was that

the romance and the politics were "deeply inter
twined."
Politics is especially involved in the version of the
show that Ram's Head is using. "Chess" was origi
nally performed in London, under the direction of
Trevor Nunn. Nunn took over when the original di
rector, Michael Bennet ("Chorus Line,'
"Dreamgirls"), fell seriously ill and withdrew from
his position a mere three months before the show
was scheduled to premiere. Nunn managed to pull
enough of the show together for it to go on, and he
received respectable reviews.
Before sending it to Broadway, though, Rice and
American playwright Richard Nelson rewrote the
script in an attempt to reduce production costs and
simplify the story. They not only changed "Chess"
so that the American player wins, but they also
added all sorts of CIA and Russian Mafia manipu
lations and political strategizing that have a large
influence on Florence and Anatoly's affair. The
American version differed also in that it was not en
tirely sung, unlike the London version.
Ram's Head is using the American version.
Unfortunately, this version was not so well received.
It was financially unsuccessful, overlooked by the
Tony Awards and butchered by critics like one who
wrote in "Variety" in 1992 that, "Tim Rice has made
yet another move in his unending effort to score
with 'Chess.' Despite considerable reworking and an
attractive physical production, the tuner can't over
come its essential mediocrity."
Essential mediocrity? Ouch. Makes you kind of
wonder why Ram's Head chose it. Or at least it

makes me wonder. So I asked. The responses I re
ceived were overwhelmingly confident and positive.
John Knag, who plays Walter Anderson said,
"'Chess' is not at all inferior. It's a fantastic musical
and definitely worthwhile."
"'Chess' wasn't a big success at first," admits
Drake. "People assumed it was mediocre. But you
have to consider that the majority of theater-goers
are 50 to 60 years old and to them, this music is
mediocre. It appeals to a much younger crowd.
Besides, who knows why things catch on? Sondheim
wasn't at all successful on Broadway, but 'Beauty and
the Beast' is. I just don't understand."
Sanders had a similar opinion. "It's not the lack of
a good show, it's just Broadway chaos. One bad re
view, and everyone else follows along. 'Chess' has a
very loyal following."
It sure does. "When we got our Web page up, we
started getting all these excited e-mails from all
over," Drake said. People were planning to come
from as far away as Portland.
Many of the cast and staff are longtime "Chess" fans
as well. "I saw the show in seventh grade and ran out
the next day to buy the CD," McCann said. Hoffman
is another example. "Apparently, he was the first per
son at the audition table, all excited because he had
been waiting to perform in 'Chess' for six years,"
Garfield said. "There's a power, a magic in 'Chess' that
ignites something and doesn't let go of you."
The magic, the excitement, seems to be conta
gious. Which is good, because enthusiasm is what
will make Ram's Head's production of "Chess" a
success. "Chess" is a complicated show, from its
troubled history to its contorted plot line.
This is a huge show. It's expensive, elaborate, ex
travagant. Financing and coordinating it has been a
huge undertaking that requires incredible commit
ment and energy.
Most of the expense and glamor comes from the
physical setup. The stage is minimal: a few white
squares of floor, some flags, a couple props. Simple,
right? Actually, no.
"It's not your traditional backdrop set," says
Sanders of the set construction. "It's a much more
architectural style. It's just not practical to stage
'Chess' like 'Phantom' or 'Les Mis.' It's abstract and
high tech."
And it's the high tech part that makes the show
even more unique, more expensive, and generally
more complicated than most musicals. Among the
goodies are — a video projector, rock and roll style
truss, a plethora of color scrollers, and moving
spots. Translated into money, this all adds up to
somewhere around $10,000. But Sanders and his
cronies through "begging, pleading, borrowing and
stealing" managed to do it for $2,400.
Getting all the lights, sounds and special effects
coordinated and in synch has posed some difficul
ties. "It's a challenging show to put together, and the
hardest part is getting everything to work together,"
Sanders said.
Coordinating people's different visions of "Chess"
has also been a challenge. The biggest thing I noticed
when talking with people was that everyone seemed
to have a different angle, a different approach to
what "Chess" should be. A rock concert? A love
story? A political statement? What is this?
As director Ariana Garfield said, "'Chess' is more
than just singing and dancing on a cool set. It's su
per-entertaining and beautiful, but there's a more
meaningful side, too. People who love musicals will
be in seventh heaven, but there's a seriousness that
can reach out to non-music lovers too. Everyone will
come away with something different."
