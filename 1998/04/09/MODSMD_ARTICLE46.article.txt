I don't like techno. I find the drumbeats monotonous and repetitive, the samples trite and hol
low and the overall enterprise lacking in that fundamental element of human soul — that
sensual squeak of fingers sliding on strings that makes popular music worth listening to.
Therefore, I am the perfect audience for Propellerheads' "Decksdrumsandrockandroll," the
latest attempt to sell techno to the ignorant masses. The Propellerheads are part of a movement
called "Big Beat." Pioneered by the Chemical Brothers, "Big Beat" adds rock elements, such as
electric guitars, to traditional techno, hoping to expand the audience beyond some dingy bars
in Europe.
Frankly, it doesn't work. Take, for instance, "Velvet Pants," one of the better songs on the al
bum. It samples a Doors groupie and then cycles her voice into a repetitive riff that underpins
the beat. This leads to a reasonably entertaining, sexy rhythm. However, within a minute I was
already bored, and within two minutes I was ready to scream. Now extend this to 60 or 70 min
utes and you begin to understand exactly how tedious this can get.
Furthermore, the excellent non-techno tracks —"360 Degrees (Oh yeah?)" featuring De La Soul
and "History Repeating" featuring the sexy stylings of Miss Shirley Bassey — provide such a stark
contrast to the dull grind of techno that it almost would have been better if they weren't included.
Techno may be the wave of the future, but the Propellerheads aren't the people to convince
me. You can throw in all the guitar riffs you want, but as long as the revolution includes two
computer nerds who can't play instruments, I'll let it pass me by.
