# Gp-Wu: 'Don't Go Against the Grain'
## 
### 
The album is solid from start to finish. Lyrically, nothing jumps out
at you if you're just listening casually. It is neither complex nor
very innovative, but there are many subtle moments of brilliance
and all four MC's flow tightly. The group's innovation rests in its ability,
much like the Alcoholiks out on the West Coast, to make the old styles
sound fresh by doing its homework on the hip-hop tradition and adding
its own twist to the mix. Production-wise, subterranean bass rumbles
dominate. They are layered with nicely utilized horn and piano samples,
both sparse and well-placed in a way that gives a sense of fullness.
The centerpiece is the manifesto "Hip Hop," a track that's worth the
price of the album itself. It is characterized by a multilayered drum track,
a thick and smooth bass line, and skilled used of synthesizers, hooking
horn, keys, and even harpsichord sounding loops. Lyrics are on point, us
ing the musical personification of songs like Common's "i used to love
h.e.r." The lyrics tell the story of hip-hop caught up in a shady music in
dustry. This is an effort to rescue the culture from all those wack rappers
that are just out for the money. It's an old story, but a story from which
we have yet to learn lessons.
GP Wu offers a sincere and timely wake-up call, one of those that we
need every now and then. As the song sums up, "to the old school and the
new school, it's time we do this hip-hop shit to the next horizon, 'cause
the other cat's got another kinda game planned for us so we must over
whelm that shit and bring it full-fledged to the next millennium."
