# Bond
## 
### 
To sum it up quickly, Bond provides catchy, melodic tunes with a
tasteful blend of rock, modern instrument technology and ingenu
ity.
By no means am I trying to belittle the group with this short description. Its
music is rather enjoyable. In fact, I was able to listen through the entire disc,
which is more than I can say for most of what i hear in modern rock today.
What makes this group appealing? First, each song has a melodic hook
that makes you want to sing along. Secondly, and possibly more impor
tantly, is the group's use of experimental programming and keyboard
sounds. Bond goes beyond the typical four-person British pop instrumen
tation, and uses programmed sounds ranging from backward samples to
drum loops to cacophonous noises. Each track brings in sounds that are
typically unconventional for rock music, such as chimes in "Interactive"
and carnival-type noises in "I'm A Bastard."
One thing that may turn you off (or on) to Bond is that lead vocalist Steve
Eusebe sounds a lot like Damon Albarn, the lead singer from Blur. Eusebe sim
ilarly blends his words together in a way that can often make them difficult to
decipher. However, this vagueness also adds to the intrigue of these songs.
Martin Slattery adds to the creative instrumentation of Bond, playing
keyboards, saxophone and even flute. Credit is also due to guitarist Jimmy
Hogarth and drummer Scott Shields for their ability to leave musical space
for these instruments.
I recommend Bond to anyone who is willing to explore one of the inter
esting realms in which rock is moving towards.
