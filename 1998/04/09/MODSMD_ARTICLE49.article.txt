# Esthero: 'Work'
## 
### 
Get ready to fall in love. From beginning to end, including the
hidden track, Esthero's debut album, "Work," is nothing short
of aural bliss.
Imagine a music genre that is ideal for passive or aggressive listen
ing, for smoking pot or playing basketball, for utter failure and de
jection or the Final Four. Add to that the vocal stylings of a woman
whose mercurial voice echoes that of Billie Holliday, TLC, Bjork and
Roberta Flack. Finally, make sure that the voice you've imagined is
equally comfortable rapping, singing or speaking. Now quit dream
ing. You've just created Esthero.
With a perfect blend of hip hop, jazz, lounge, rock, pop and dance,
Esthero invents a moving, mellow and dramatic form of audio plea
sure that could even make sitting alone in a stinky room desirable.
Track 1, "Breath From Another," slides into the conscious world
slowly, with nothing but an electronic chime, a bass line and a sam
ple from the pig scene in the movie "Deliverance." Like the pig scene
itself, the song starts out sounding eerie and sinister. Enter the drum
beat, a pause and then lead singer Esthero's smooth, almost choirboy
(but a tad too sexy) vocals. As Sufi poet Rumi would say, it's like wine
and honey mixed.
Other songs to look out for: "Indigo Boy," "Heven Sent," "That
Girl," "Country Livin' " and the hidden track (which 1 will let you
find on your own).
Each song washed over and under me, leaving me wet, confused and
unsure of what I was listening to. It felt good, but in a guilty way. I'm an
English major, but I didn't care about the words. I couldn't tell you what
they were. But the sparse wording is appropriate, even necessary.
Buy "Work." If you get it now, you'll feel like a trendsetter later.
