# Dimitri From Paris:
## 'Sacrebleu!' 
### 
Bossa Nova, techno, Robin Williams,
Henry Mancini and a sense of humor
â€” there's very little that Dimitri has
left oil this album. The music is electric con
fectionary, neither deep nor dark, and is
) meant only to amuse and surprise. The titles
alone suggest the music's intentions: "Le
Moogy Reggae,""Une Very Stylish I ille,""Un
Terlude."
Each track cheerfully bounces along, evok
ing the soundtracks to hip '60s romantic
comedies and the music to corporate promo
tional videos. Sometimes, Dimitri's clear ob
session with background music makes the lis
tening too easy, and sometimes dull.
I lowever, just because it doesn't take itself
seriously doesn't mean that this album isn't
worth serious consideration. This music has
spikes below its sugar-coated surface. Its at-

titude, its eclecticism and the risks it

takes make it playfully subver
sive. A

The alburn Inventively
moves from style to style,
from Latin jazz, to cheap
'70s funk, to trip hop. I;ach
track is stitched together by
samples from films, comedy
albums and television, mak-

ing a smooth whole from
wildly dispai ate parts. For those
familiar with either artist, this al
bum is a great blend of Barry
Adamson's . "Oedipus
