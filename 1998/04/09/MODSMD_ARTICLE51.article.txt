# Killah Priest: 'Heavymental'
## 
### 
Times, they are a-changing, right? Or have they already changed? Rap and hip hop have
been so blended with R&B that now, you don't know where one begins and the other ends.

Every song now "features" Puff Daddy, Lil' Kim or Missy Elliott, and every rap is now graced by
Aaliyah's or Total's vocals. But not "Heavymental," Killah Priest's debut album.
"Heavymental" stands apart from the recent influx of hip hop / R&B. It doesn't need any extra vo
cals or zillions of remixes. A mixture of Nas' and The Wu-Tang Clan's style, Heavymental is complete
with tight lyrics and phat beats.
Killah Priest definitely seems to have a lot of interests. His raps cover a range of esoteric topics, in
cluding third eyes, martial arts, African-American history and bibilical anecdotes on his cuts "Tai
Chi,""Heavy Mental,""Wisdom,""Mystic City" and "8.1.8. L.E."
. .On "Fake MC's," Killah Priest throws his two cents in on the ongoing East Coast / West Coast
what-happened-to-hip-hop-and-who-told-Puffy-he-could-rap discussion. "Too many phony MCs
out there / this year / niggas be frontin' / ain't sayin nothin " and "too many rappers in the east wanna
be gangstas / too many gangstas in the west wanna be rappers / a bunch of actors / 1 oughta smack ya
/ Who's your master?"
Killah Priest's album is definitely "mental." Each cut is a cross between a musical lecture and a his
tory lesson.
