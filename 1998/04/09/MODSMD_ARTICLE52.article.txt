# Libido: 'Killing Some Dead Time'
## 
### 
The most striking thing about this album is the CD itself — it just looks neat. It is the kind of shiny silver that 1 would expect to see these Norwegian boys wearing at the dis
cotheque. Beyond the dazzling CD, there is nothing especially remarkable about this album.
Libido sounds like the Gin Blossoms with a harder edge — add a funky twist and some Norwegian accents, and you have Libido's version ot radio pop. It's rock; it's mellow at times
and ha.s that singalong quality associated with a round of "row, row, row your boat.'
No one track really jumps off the album, but of special interest are track 5 and track 8. On track 5, we see a little of Libido's punkier side. In track 8 its lounge-lizard side makes
an appeareance.
Libido has the talent to do something different than what everyone else is doing, and it should develop that talent.
This is an album that will not offend — but "Killing Some Dead Time" is not all that noticeable in a market full of other bands who are doing just what Libido is doing, only better.
