# The
						Young Dubliners: 'Alive, Alive'O'
## 
### 
The Young Dubliner s new live album is probably best ap
preciated by those who have already seen the band in
concert.
The recording definitely conveys the energy and vitality of
a live performance, but it carries along a Spinal Tap-like qual
ity whenever the band launches into their hard-rock Irish iig
interludes. The cornv episodes end up working for the band,
because they lift the mood that most o! their lyrics set. While
the words speak of loneliness, frustration and other bad stuff,
the tone of the album is upbeat and lively.
Musically, the Young Dubliners have a good thing going —
guitars, fiddle, saxophone and keyboard texture the classic quar
tet of guitar, bass, drum and vocals. The band knows how to har
mom/.c along the likes of lack O'Pierce and can vary its sound
enough to sustain an hour of anyone's attention. Most of all, you
can hear that the group is having a great time petforming.
The Young Dub's put on a great show. But don't rush out for
the CD. Save your money, buy a 40 o' Mickey's, and see them live.
