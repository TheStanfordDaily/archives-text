# Dr Didg: 'Serotonality'
## 
### 
If you heard the music of Dr. Didg on the streets or
at a festival, youd probably be really impressed and
decide to stick around for at least a song or two.
You'd even remark to your companions how wonderful
it is that such pure artistry can still exist in our cynical,
money-hungry society.
Centered around the Australian aboriginal instru
ment, the didgeridoo (get it, Dr. Didg? Isn't that
clever?), the music of the band is complex, with mul
tiple loops that create a unique sound layering. Dr.
Didg's members are very talented, and the music is

filled with wholesome, old-fashioned fun. In fact, "Bob's Cloud" sounds a lot like the opening to
Sesame Street.
But could you actually sit through a whole hour of this on a CD? Although the didgeridoo pro
vides a unique and sometimes fascinating touch, the loops of Dr. Didg grow tiring, and the occa
sional use of boring horn samples overpowers the didgeridoo.
Perhaps under the spell of harmony, love and unity that is intended to he rave, Dr. Didg would
he amazing. But on CD it ends up sounding like a watered down, easy-listening fusion of funk,
jazz and techno. It is a bit too clean-cut, and requires a little too much patience.
Think of it as techno for your parents — Huey Lewis and the News with sampling and a
didgeridoo. But slipped in between the John Tesh and Kenny G CDs, it may soon become a favorite.
