# Scott Wetland: '12 Bar Blues'
## 
### 
Although a worthwhile effort, Scott Weiland's newest album should come with a
warning label reading, "Caution: this album contains attempts at ballad rock."
12 Bar Blues is an intriguing jaunt into a different sound for Weiland. He adds
unique-sounding instruments, such as the ever popular mellotron, organ and cello. It
seems as though he is trying to mix the harder sound of Stone Temple Pilots with some
thing a little more poppy. But he is not all that successful.
In addition, Weiland abandons his previous rough, deep and raw style of singing for a
more lyrical sound — is he listening to too much Hanson? He does not appear to sing along
with the music that accompanies him, which is a shame because the music is well done.

He must have had a lot of time on his side, because all of the
songs on this album are long. The problem is they also

feel long. If you are an STP fan, you may be disap
pointed, but the album is worth a listen. If you

are not an STP fen, this may be the chance
to begin listening to a new sound.

Either way, I give Weiland an "A"
for effort. I think that once he gets a

better handle on the type of
sound he wants to produce, he

will put out a better album.
