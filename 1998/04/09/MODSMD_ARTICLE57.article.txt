# LBC COMPILATION'
## 
### 
It sure is hard growing up a gangster in L.A. You wake up late, since you don't have
a job. Then you tell your boys to come over because your mama ain't home (she
has a job). You down some alcohol with your

boys before you call the freaks and hoes. You
don't love them hoes, though. Then you ac
tually leave the house. Though you manage
to avoid drive-by shootings, you still run
into the freaks you dissed. They just won't
take no for an answer (they just want you
for your indo).
Who told me 'the life' was so rough?
Snoop Doggy Dogg, Warren G, Dr. Dre and
Ice Cube, to name a few. Now "19th Street
LBC Compilation" is telling me again.

On "I Like To Roll," Coco Loc, Shorty K, Lil' J and Crooked give us their philos
ophy on education: "I hate school / so 1 don't go / maybe twice in a month / to play
some dice / and eat some lunch."
Some of the song titles are "Stay out of L. A.," "Gangsta Gangsta," "Flossin'" and
"Servin' and Swervin.' " That's exactly what those songs are about.
The music is good enough to dance to and Miss CoCo puts nice background vo
cals on "Stay Out of L.A." There's nothing wrong with this album, but in light of it's
predecessors, there's nothing right with it either. "19th Street LBC Complilation"
lacks originality.
This is a pretty good album for what it is. Unfortunately, it's a repeat of a tired
and recurring theme.
