# 'LEGACY' — A TRIBUTE TO FLEETWOOD MAC'S 'RUMOURS'
## 
### 
Fleetwood Mac's "Rumours" is an album of such
perfect, dreamy and vibrant pop that this tribute comes as no surprise. "Legacy"
is supposed to be a re-interpretation of "Rumours" by some prominent contem
porary Top 40 artists. But if this album is in any way representative of the state of pop
todav, we are screwed.
' Legacy" starts off promisingly with Tonic's lighthearted, even goofy, version of
"Second Hand News" and The Corrs' blend of New Age and disco in the song
"Dreams." However, the album's momentum is brought to a crashing bait with a
muddy, preening and pretentious cover of "Never Going Back" by Matchbox2o.

(Can someone please tell that guy to stop pouting?)
The rest of the album is a hit-and-miss affair. Contributions by The

Cranberries (remember them?) and Tallulah are as good as Mac's
originals. Elton John, on the other hand, somehow manages to

drain all energy and verve out of "Don't Stop," while Jewel, cof
feehouse wench that she is, whines her way through "You

Make Loving Fun.""Legacy" reaches its absolute nadir with
Sister Hazel's Blues Traveler impression on "Gold Dust

Woman" and Duncan Sheik's atrocious version of
"Songbird."

But the musical genius of "Rumours" still shines
through the most tired of these cover versions.
"Legacy," with all of its VHI -style blandness, cannot
dim Fleetwood Mac's immaculate, solid songwriting.
So, stick to the original and use this CI) as the
crowning argument in your today's-music- suc ks rants.

Los Aminos

r Invisibles:
'The New

of the

Vene/iielan

Gozadera'

Every few years, some record company tries to sell
Latin rock to the United States; the most notable examples being Caft Tacuba
or Los Pabulosos Cadillacs. The logic here is that with the growing number of
Spanish speakers in the United States, Americans will one day be ready for something
with a bit more bite than Gerardo.
In general, companies have made the mistake of importing the best Latin

American rock bands — bands whose
swirling polyrhythms, metrical shifts and
politically-charged lyrics would make the
average Matchbox2o fan scratch his head
and turn back to "Push."
Thus, Los Amigos Invisibles, the hot new
band from Venezuela, is poised to be the
next big thing. This is precisely because they
are bad enough for American tastes. They
know that Americans don't want to hear
about deforestation in Mexico or discourses
on the nature of death; they want to hear "el
Ultra-funk."

Los Amigos Invisibles promises a "fusion of different elements of dance
and sex culture," and it delivers in spades. The album has the atmosphere of a sleazy
70s Latin disco. The music is little more than a fat bass-ltne and all the wah-wah
you could want. The lyrics stick with "the forbidden dance" (if you know what 1
mean) and include such subtleties as "quiero tus senos y hay algo aqui abajo que
grita.'ven a mi, mama' n [I love your breasts and there's something down here that
screams "come to me, mama! n ]
Sure the music is repetitive, and yeah, it goes on too long, but it maintains a
highly consistent level of funkiness, and that's all that counts. So if vou're looking
to get your groove on, or if you just want a good pickup line for that next trip to
Puerto Vallarta (see above), Los Amigos Invisibles may be the new sound you're
looking for.
