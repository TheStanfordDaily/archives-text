## 'Lost' in bad lines Dialogue crashes the updated Jupiter 2 
### 
The only good thing about "Lost in Space" is Gary Oldman, and he
fails to rescue the film from mediocrity. Stephen Hopkins'
("Predator 2") newest film, based on the 1960s television series, suf
fers from horrible dialogue and sub-par acting. It is just a messy action
flick at heart.
Matt Leßlanc from "Friends" plays Major West, a cocky war hero cho
sen to pilot the Jupiter 2 spaceship. He utters every bad line in the book in
his effort to win the heart of fellow passenger Judy Robinson (Heather
Graham). The real problem with his performance is that he is hard to take
seriously — even in the action sequences. He manages to look goofy even
when dressed in the futuristic suit of armor that he uses to fight bugs with
lasers ("Starship Troopers," anyone?).
Judy's two siblings in the movie, Penny (Lacey Chabert) and Will (Jack
Johnson), don't add enough to the film to warrant their presence. They
could easily have been condensed into one part without losing anything
of importance other than a little extra cutesyness.
The Robinson parents, John (William Hurt) and Maureen (Mimi
Rogers), are convincing in dealing with believable family problems.
Oldman plays a saboteur who gets caught on the flight he was supposed
to stop. He plays the part with his usual psychopathic flair. Although it
may be a stock character for him, he plays the bad guy in such an enter
taining way that it is hard to say anything bad about him. These three ac
tors are the highlight of the film, as their interactions are the only inter
esting ones.
What realJy kills this movie is the dialogue. For instance, in a suppos
edly scary sequence in which little space spiders are about to attack the
family, Judy turns *.o Major Wes' and says,"I don't like the sound of that
sound." How c?a you not laugh? Or cry, at least. The movie continually
amazed me v »th bad line after had line, and although the violence and ac
tion was fan to watch, 1 prefer not to laugh during suspenseful scenes. I
prefer Keing on the edge or my seat.
