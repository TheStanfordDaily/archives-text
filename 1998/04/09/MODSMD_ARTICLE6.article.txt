Comni unica

This tidbit of
advice carries
over to the rela-

tionship between students, the
ASSIJ and University administra
tion, said Lisa Liao and Loren De
meroutis. candidates for ASSIJ
president and vice president, re
spectively.
Hie pair, both juniors, have out
lined a three-point plan to establish
the credibility and accountability ol
ASSI) government. They want to
see the ASSI' "fill the gap between
students and administration." lore
most through improved communi
cation.
"We want to convey student
opinion to the administration," De
meroutis said.

versity issues and policy and establish
a human resources clearinghouse
within the ASSI I office to coordinate
student involvement in ASSU pro
jects. They also intend to distribute
the ASSU's newsletter more widely
across campus.
"Sometimes students don't know
who to go to" with their problems or
to find out how to get involved with
the ASSU. Liao said. Their plan
would streamline student input, she
added.
Liao and Demeroutis hope to
reach out to two other underserved
populations as well. They plan to
hold Ccxikies and Tea gatherings
with ASSU officers and produce a
video explaining the function of the
ASSU for freshmen to watch during

orientation.
" The lack of graduate interest in
the ASSU is the ASSU's fault for not
addressing substantial issues for
graduate students," Liao said.
"We'd like to get to enthusiastic
freshmen before they're exposed to
apathetic upperclassmen," Demer
outis said.
The second point of their plan is a
restructuring of the ASSU Senate.
They support electing undergradu
ate senators in the fall to represent
residences, again in order to facilitate
communication.
"It gives the senator a more per
sonal stake." Liao said, "since he or
she lives with you and knows you."
The system would more closely re
semble that of graduate senators,
who are elected out of districts based
on the schools in which they study.
Finally. Liao and Demeroutis
seek to increase the credibility of stu

dents serving on University commit
tees.
Other members of the commit
tees do not see the student members
as truly representative of the opinion
of the student body, Liao said.
She and Demeroutis want to facil
itate the How of information and get
students on different committees
working together on issues from their
respective committees' angles.
"We want to coordinate support
and feedback from the public," Liao
said. "There is a huge potential to af
fect policy if student committee
members organize."
To implement their ideas, Liao
and Demeroutis plan to appoint spe
cial, focused president's office work
groups to help them.
"Some administrations seem to
have lost steam a bit," Liao said.
"People get disillusioned — other
people don't care as much as you do.

But we expect that. Each administra
tion will learn from the one before."
Liao and Demeroutis have been
involved with the ASSU Nomina
tions Committee, which selects stu
dents to serve on University commit
tees.
"I've seen all aspects of the ASSU
from a nonpolitical perspective and
how University policy affects student
life, said Liao, chair of the committee.
Demeroutis is also a resident as
sistant for Burbank.
"I plan to stay in touch with stu
dents" as vice president, he said, "as I
stay on top of what's going on in the
dorm."
The candidates emphasized their
motivation for running for office.
"We had the platform, then decid
ed to run," Demeroutis said. "We be
lieve in these ideas ... and that we
could work in the best interests of stu
dents."
