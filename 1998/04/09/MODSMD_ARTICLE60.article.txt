# Lemon and Matthau: Mismatched for life
## Felix and Oscar are at it again in 'The Odd Couple II' 
### 
I was hoping for more "Grumpy Old Men," and"The Odd Couple II"
gave me exactly that. This sequel to the 1968 hit "The Odd Couple"
reunites Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Walter
Matthau) as completely polar and utterly hapless men who are trying
to find their way to their children's wedding. Albeit predictable in terms
of plot direction, I found myself fully engaged in this periodically side
hurting comedy.
Lemmon and Matthau seem to be growing rather accustomed to
seeing each other on the set: "The Odd Couple II" marks the 10th time
they have co-starred in a movie. The time spent together only adds to
the comic timing and deft touch that a comedy needs to succeed. These
two veterans know how to nail a punch line.
The obsessively neat Felix treks to Southern California from New
York, while the poker-playing and rather unkempt Oscar flies in from
Sarasota, Florida. When Oscar realizes that his son, Brucey Madison
(Jonathan Silverman from"The Single Guy"), is marrying Felix's
daughter, Hannah Lugar (Lisa Waltz), his reaction is nearly golden.
They agree to share a rental car and attempt to find their way to the
fictional town of San Malina. Of course, they are not going to get there
on their first attempt — or even on their fifth go-around. The count
less obstacles and mishaps that occur along the way are what we have
come to expect from Matthau and Lemmon.
An example of such a mishap is when each has lost his set of direc
tions to the wedding. One set is burned up partially and thrown out of
the car window. The other is left at the airport.
Supporting cast members are likely to raise a few eyebrows because
of their prominent television careers. Christine Baranski (Emmy-win
ner from "Cybil") plays a luscious flirt named Thelma. Jay O. Sanders
("Saturday Night Live") has been delegated the role of the bad guy since
he, with the help of a friend, nearly kills our beloved antagonistic duo.
Producer and screenwriter Neil Simon, best known for his work in
theater, returns to Felix and Oscar 30 years after they were supremely
mismatched as roommates in New York. He garnered an Oscar nomi
nation for best original screenplay in 1968 for"The Odd Couple." I
don't really foresee any such hopes for Simon's latest effort, but the
movie was good-hearted and nonetheless delivered many laughs.

Do you suppose there'll be a sitcom this time around?
