# Travolta does a good Clinton
## 'Primary Colors' is smart but stretchy 
### 
Given the current state of the presidency, "Primary Colors" has an
appealing premise. The political drama stars John Travolta as
southern governor and presidential candidate Jack Stanton, who
bears an uncoincidental resemblance to Bill Clinton.
"Primary Colors" is based on the book with the same title. The plot
has picked up plenty of media attention because it seems to match
many of the events that took place during Clinton's candidacy (includ
ing a (Jennifer Flowers-like scandal, complete with tape recordings).
More importantly, it focuses on the sometimes fake idealism behind a
presidential campaign.
The story centers around one of Stanton's campaign managers, a vi
sionary man named Henry Burton (Adrian Lester). He has to deal with
many inexperienced and interesting people on the way to the top.
Henry also has to try and untangle Stanton's past, which, not sur
prisingly, includes a string of extramarital affairs. He and political ad
viser Richard Jemmons (Billy Bob Thornton) have to handle Stanton's
wife Susan (Emma Thompson), who is oblivious to sex and obsessed
with cultivating her own success through her husband's campaign.
Help comes in the form of Libby Holden (Kathy Bates), an unstable
college friend of Stanton and wife. She agrees to be a Dustbuster for
Stanton, getting certain people to shut up before the press becomes in -
terested. She also digs up the dirt on Stanton's dangerously charismatic
opponent, Freddy Picker (Larry Hagman).
"Primary Colors" has many memorable scenes. My favorite is a slow
zoom on Stanton's favorite doughnut shop, where he takes the time to
talk politics with the graveyard-shift cashier. The message we're given is
that in spite of a candidate's faults, the man (or at least the campaign)
with genuine concern for the people is the one to pick.
The movie starts off great, with humor and ethical issues being
tossed around. About halfway through the movie, though, the plot hits
a brick. It becomes really boring as the epic struggle of the campaign is
forgotten and a personal score between Libby, Stanton and Susan is di
alogued to death.
1 found the second half of the movie to be so aggravatingly long that
1 can't recommend shelling out money for this movie when tun movies
like "Lost in Space" are playing in the same theaters.
"Primary Colors" has some great ideas and top-notch acting all
around (most notably from Lester and Thornton). However, it's best
left to video or Sunday Flicks.
