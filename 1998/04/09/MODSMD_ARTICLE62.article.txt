# Bad news for Bruce
## 'Mercury Rising' is too typical 
### 
Interestingly, while trying to find the Web page for the new film "Mercury
Rising," I came across several that pertained to a Maryland heavy metal
band with the same name. That comes as more news to me than the action
that fills the screen in Bruce Willis' latest action-thriller. Very blast 4 and co
matose, "Mercury Rising" is a sleeper of a film with few thrills and little action.
Willis gets top billing as FBI agent Art Jeffries, a man who is pressured to
quit following a botched undercover job. Art is a hardened veteran, and he re
fuses to let the Bureau release him. After being given some minor tasks. Art
stumbles across an unusual child kidnapping case in Chicago. This is where
everything gets moving, because the boy involved, a 9-year-old autistic kid
named Simon (Miko Hughes), has just decoded a multibillion-dollar security
code for a project entitled "Mercury."
Lt. Col. Nicholas Kudrow (Alec Baldwin) is the mastermind advocating
Project Mercury. He is most disheartened to find out that some pre-pubescent
boy has cracked the nation's innermost layer of security. How might he have
gotten his hands on the code? Well, the project's designers placed it in Carries
Magazine and dared the amateurs of the world to figure it out.
Kudrow's National Security Agency henchmen are called to locate and
eliminate the child and anyone protecting him. One such strongman is played
by Peter Stormare, who appeared in "largo" as a silent hitman who went
crazy with a wood chipper.
I personally don't see why anyone would even want to kill Simon. He does
not appear to be able to replicate the series of numbers without looking at the
magazine, so why not simply take the magazine out of his possession?
Director Harold Becker has recycled a plot line — endangered and helpless
citizen is assisted by toughened veteran — and placed it inside the world of
hackers and high-tech security. There is a moment of irony when the computer
science whiz relies 011 a rundown typewriter to send out a confidential memo.
I honestly couldn't help laughing throughout the movie, even when the
rest of the sold-out audience was silent. While Simon is busy puzzling over
the code in Games, a wacky digitized sound repeats itself, which reminded me
of those old '50s sci-fi films.
All in all, "Mercury Rising" is an uninvolving and run-of-the-mill action
comeiiy which Willis could easily perform in his sleep.
