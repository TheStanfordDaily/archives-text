# 27-word fiction
## Editor's Ricks 
### 
It looks as if the reign of the 27-word fiction
contest has ended. Our entries have decreased to a
mere pittance of their former strength (in num
bers). What can we say, gang?
If we don't start getting raging entries from
more people, we may have to lay to rest the most
consistently profound part of The Stanford Daily.
This, to us is a cause for mourning.
On a happier note, some of our entries this
week were actually about the evil of rain. Our reg
ulars are here again: Ilias, forest, Patrick and

Michael — all have some words to share, and a new
regular, lauren, seems to be joining the ranks of
wild.
We know that there are more poets and writers
out there who are looking for a forum. Please
make yourselves known. We are here now, not on
spring break! Be here now! Exhibit your art, or the
forum will disappear mysteriously!
