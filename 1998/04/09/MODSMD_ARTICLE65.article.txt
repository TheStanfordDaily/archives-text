### Mae West Coltrane 
What do Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Janeane
Garofalo, Jennifer Jason
Leigh, Naomi Campbell and
Mae West Coltrane have in
common? I'll let you think
about it for a paragraph.
It's getting close to the
middle of the quarter.
Workloads begin to weigh
heavily on our minds, and
sometimes the overwhelming
call of the loin isn't strong
enough to make you wag your
butt across campus to meet
your lover. But your loins are
calling. So what do you do?
Phone sex.
That's the answer. Arnold
does it to keep his long-dis
tance marriage together;
Janeane, Jennifer, and Naomi
have all done it for a camera
(and a great deal of money);
Joe Shmoe from Philadelphia
probably partakes just to get
off when his buddies are at a
game somewhere macking
with their steady girlies.
Now, just hold on a
minute. Before you begin
telling yourself that Mae West
can't even get the real thing,
let's get something straight: it
was over spring break. My
honey was nowhere to be
found, and I'd never tried the
far-away kind before. I had
nothing to lose and a column
to write. So I dialed the toll
free number, made sure my
door was closed and turned
off the lights.
The particular phone line
I chose allowed me to listen to
a bunch of different messages
from many possible partners.
I must have listened to 30 of
them before I found one that
I liked. Some guys sounded
like they had a mouthful of
spit, some sounded like ex
boyfriends, and a couple of
them scared me so much that
I almost hung up. A few made
me laugh out loud. It takes all
kinds to make a great institu
tion. Phone sex is a great in
stitution. Almost everyone
likes to climax with another
person nearby. If "nearby"
happens to mean "on the
phone," more power to the
open-minded.
The guy I chose was an an
tique dealer from somewhere
in England. He seemed nice

enough, so we talked a bit
about his work. I described
myself (inaccurately), and I
am sure he did the same.
I'm not going to tell you
what happened. Suffice to say,
there are some nice-sounding
people out there in
phoneland, but there are also
plenty of scary people who
fantasize about things I'd
rather not mention. There are
also art dealers named John
from England.
But I was unlucky enough
to be far from my honey.
When you're on opposite
sides of campus, however, you
know what you're getting
into. I have some quick tips
for those of you who want to
meet the aural side of the
guy(s) or gal(s) that you've
been getting to know.
First: WANT TO DO IT.
Just like with the real thing, a
partner who doesn't want to
get down and dirty isn't going
to have fun, and may come
out of the experience emo
tionally scarred. Make sure
that the person you want to
talk into a climax wants to
hear what you have to say.
Second: DON'T BE SHY.
There's no bigger letdown in
the world of long-distance
cumming than a person who's
afraid to speak. It's the equiv
alent of frigidity. At least
make some sort of sound.
Moaning, hard breathing and
laughing or screaming as nec
essary help the process along.
Third: DON'T BE AFRAID
TO ENJOY YOURSELF. Take
that any way you want. If that
means using your free hand,
go for it. If it means just talk
ing about the weather until
you feel horny, go for it. If it
means cursing and screaming
about politics, go for it.
Whatever gets you off (and
won't cause the other person
psychological damage.)
For those of you who insist
on using the pay-to-call ser
vices, I have one final piece of
advice: HURRY AND GET
DOWN TO THE NITTY
GRITTY. Phone sex companies
don't care if you get off. They
want your money. So, unless
you want $400 phone bills,
hurry up and get whackin'.
So set your fingers for
speed dialing. Just don't forget
to turn off your call waiting.
