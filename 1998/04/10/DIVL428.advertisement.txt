Yes, it's a dream come true. A
diet that works permanently, costs
relatively little, and is even fun to go
through.
The diet's secret is based on a
two-pronged approach by highly
regarded scientist Dr. Rudolf
Redgear.
The first element to this diet is
milkshakes. These contain herbs that
have been common knowledge in
Third World nations, but are only
now becoming apparent in America.
The herb, called Fairyweed, explains
the amazing weight-loss record of the
Third World.
You've seen those pictures and
wondered, "How did those people
get to be so thin?" Well, now you
know. And now you can share in the
amazing weight-loss achievement of
the involuntarily starving.
By taking the milkshakes every
day for a week, and eating nothing
else, you'll find that you've lost 10
pounds.
"But it says 60 pounds on the top
of the page," I hear you say. That's
right, the extra 50 pounds comes
from the second prong of our two
step approach.
On the seventh day of the diet
,you chop your leg off with a special
ax that we provide. See the pounds
literally fly off your body. Watch
with delight as your scales register a
weight you never thought you were
capable of.
That's science, and that's the
essence of weight loss.
BEFORE:
Unhappy at 210 lbs.
AFTER:
60 lbs lighter
For just $50 we'll send you:
1. A GALLON OF MILkSHAKE
2. A BIG AX AND
3. NOTHING ELSE BECAUSE
4. YOU'RE DESPERATE TO LOSE WEIGHT AND
5. WE WANT YOUR MONEY.
Yes, yes, yes, oh my god yes, I want to lose weight.
You will steal my money, and in return I get to dam
age myself.
