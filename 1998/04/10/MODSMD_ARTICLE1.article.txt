# What's it like to be HIV positive?
## Students listen to personal stories about HIV and AIDS

"Live fast and die young" may
sound really romantic, a speaker
said at last night's AIDS panel dis
cussion â€” but not when the state
ment actually pertains to your life.
As part of AIDS Awareness
Week, 40 students gathered last
night in Toyon Hall lounge to partic
ipate in a discussion about HIV and
AIDS. Students listened intently to
two HIV-positive speakers and then
asked questions and shared their
personal connections to and feelings
about the HIV / AIDS virus.

Both speakers, who wish to re
main anonymous, talked about their
lives before acquiring the HIV virus
and their current situations. Both
speakers, one male and one female,
stressed their prior beliefs about
their own invincibility and present
appreciation for life.
The male speaker said that he
now lives life to its fullest. Two
weeks ago. he quit his corporate job
and is now writing a play. "I need to
chill." he said.
The female speaker reinforced
this desire to live after hearing her
HIV-positive test reports. "I real
ized for the first time since I was

young that I didn't want to die," she
said. "It took HIV to make me real
ize how precious life is, but I don't
recommend it as a mode of trans
port."
The speakers shared their stories
to demonstrate the personal con
nections people have with HIV. The
female speaker said she tells her
story in order "to show what HIV
looks like" and in the hope that peo
ple "can find things in common with
my story and not push me away."
She said her HIV experience is a
"life experience that can happen to
anyone," and she related the incred
ible difficulty of "looking at vour

parents and telling them their baby
might die."
The speakers also talked about
new developments in AIDS treat
ment. Testing positive for HIV in
the late 1990s is much different than
testing positive in the 1980s. Today,
there is a growing belief that HIV is
a manageable disease and not dead
ly.
Both speakers are on a rigid
medical schedule, and the female
speaker said that she does not plan
on dying from AIDS but living a
long, healthv life.

Sophomore Amy Hsu reads names of AIDS victims by the NAMES Project quilt in White Plaza Tuesday. The event was put on by Volun
teers Increasing the Visibility of AIDS as a part of AIDS Awareness Week.
Jessica Werner, a sophomore
majoring in history and internation
al relations and one of VIVA's co
presidents, shared her hopes for the
panel.
" This panel brings it home. AIDS
is something that affects everyone.
The people who are speaking are
very young."
After the speakers told their sto
ries, an engaged audience asked
questions and shared personal expe
riences. Students asked about new
medical treatments, the growth of
HIV cases among women and teens
and the period when the virus does
not appear on tests.
Stephanie Arvai, a senior major
ing in psychology, said that the panel
helped her "put a face behind the
statistics." Ernesto Martinez, a se
nior and English major, had attend
ed many AIDS panels and discus
sions. "In other groups. I've left," he
said. "But this was great."
Sophomore Karina Celaya was
affected by the discussion. She ex
plained that she comes from a small
town where discussion about AIDS
and HIV was limited. "I feel like
|HIV / AIDS) is a personal thing. I
can relate to it much more."
The speakers were sponsored by
Health Initiatives for Youth, a Bay
Area organization that sends HlV
positive speakers to local junior and
senior high schools to dispel myths
about the virus. So that their audi
ences can best relate to the subject
matter being presented, all speakers
are under age 26.
