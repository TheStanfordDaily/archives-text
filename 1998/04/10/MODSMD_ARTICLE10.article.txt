## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF)
Brushing aside possible con diets of
interest, the Justice Department
gave Whitewater prosecutor Ken
neth Starr the go-ahead yesterday to
investigate allegations that a conser
vative foundation may have provid
edfinancial assistance to his star wit
ness.
Justice officials were looking at
Starr's ties to the American Specta
tor foundation, said a senior agency
official who requested anonymity.
Hut Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder told Starr in a letter that the
independent counsel has "investiga
tive and prosecutorial jurisdiction

over these allegations" because it
involved possible tampering with
one of his witnesses.
"The department lacks jurisdic
tion to investigate it," Holder wrote.
A witness has alleged that top
Whitewater witness David Hale
received payments and other assis
tance from conservative activists
working for the American Spectator
Educational Foundation, which also
publishes a magazine, when Hale
was cooperating with Starr's investi
gation.
Starr's friend and former law
partner, high-powered Washington
lawyer Theodore Olson, is a direc

tor on the foundation's board and
the magazine's publisher is a per
sonal friend of Starr's. Also, the
foundation has received funding
from a group controlled by billion
aire publisher Richard Mellon
Scaife that gave $1 million to Pep
perdine University, where Starr
plans to teach after the investiga
tion.
Allegations that Hale was assist
ed by conservative activists working
for the magazine first came to light
in March.
C'arvn Mann, a Bentonville,
Ark., funeral home employee, said
that her former live-in boyfriend

received money from magazine offi
cials and that her son saw the
boyfriend give cash to Hale when
Hale was cooperating with Starr's
invesigation.
Parker Dozhier. Mann's former
boyfriend, acknowledged to The
""Associated Press that he received
$35,000 to be the magazine's "eyes
and ears" in Arkansas and that 1 laic
occassionallv stayed rent-free in a
"secluded fishing cabin he owns, but
denied giving money to Hale.
Whitewater prosecutors working
