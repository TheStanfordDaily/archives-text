CARROLLTON, ky. (AP)
In the heart of tobacco country.
President Clinton pledged yester
day to "do right by the families that
grow tobacco" as he pressed his hat
tie against teen-age smoking.
Tobacco companies scoffed at his
promise.
Clinton's visit, one day after
cigarette makers said unprecedent
ed anti-tobacco legislation was
dead, was designed to increase
pressure on the industry not to
fight Congress at it moves to curb
teen smoking and compensate
states for smoking-related health
care costs.
Clinton and lawmakers said they
would act with or without Big
Tobacco's cooperation.
"Even in tobacco country, we

can't deny what ... has been done
to market tobacco to children in
ways that compromise their future,"
Clinton told a rally at Carroll Coun
ty High School. And he urged fami
lies reared on the profits of hurley
leaf to look at such evidence.
"To me, no company's bottom
line is important compared to
America's bottom line. America's
bottom line should be your life,
your future, your health."
And he pledged that farmers
would not be left to pay the price.
"Tobacco farmers have not done
anything wrong," Clinton said. "If
we succeed in reducing teen smok
ing. then sooner or later we will
reduce the overall demand for
tobacco.... Can we do that and still
do right by the families who grow

tobacco, by the warehouses, by the
communities? I think the answer to
that is 'yes.' "
Not likely, the tobacco compa
nies said.
"Any grower who falls for Bill
Clinton's line is making a really ter
rible mistake," said J. Phil Carlton,
the industry's top settlement nego
tiator in Washington. He said there
is no way to protect farmers if com
panies are driven out of business or
overseas.
While Clinton spoke. Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Co. Chairman
Nicholas Brookes joined over 4(K>
employees to protest that the pend
ing crackdown would devastate the
industry and the local economy.
"I can't find another job that
pays what Brown & Williamson

pays." said Vicki Shockley. a single
mother with a 15-year-old daughter,
as workers paraded with signs say
ing. "Don't lax Us Out of Our
Jobs."
Last June, the big companies
signed a deal with state attorneys
general to settle 40 state lawsuits b\
paying $368 billion and curbing
marketing in return lor significant
legal protections.
That deal. RJR Nabisco chief
Steven Goldstone said Wednesday,
is now dead because Congress and
Clinton have toughened the provi
sions enough to kill his industry.
The pending bill would raise the
industry's penalties and fines to halt
a trillion dollars without the legal
protections — so Goldstone
pledged to work to kill it.
