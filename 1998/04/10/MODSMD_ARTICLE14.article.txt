Amendment should have
been completed in time
for the general election

THE ASSU SPRING General
Election is less than a week
away, but the latest ASSU ini
tiative to make its senators more
accountable to the student body will
not be appearing on the ballot.
Instead, the amendment will appear
on the ballot during the runoff election
that will occur, should no presidential
ticket receive 50 percent of the vote in
the general election.
The constitutional amendment
would place undergraduate senators in
geographic districts, thus allowing sen
ators to be elected only by students in
their own district.
If the authors of this bill were really
serious about this amendment, they
would have seen to it that it reached
the ballot in time for the general elec
tion. Legislation of this importance
should not be riding on the fact that
this year's five-way presidential race
will likely necessitate a runoff election.
Moreover, this amendment
deserves campus-wide discussion
because it significantly overhauls cur
rent senate election procedures. Now
is the time for discussion of this
amendment. The ASSU's failure to get
the bill on the general election ballot
and foster dialogue about it is irre
sponsible.
Even more disturbing is the fact
that voter turnout for runoff elec
tions—stipulated to be held 14 days
after the general election — is histori

cally significantly lower than that of
the general election.
If indeed undergraduate senators
should be assigned to geographic con
stituencies, it is essential that such
efforts are made as a response to the
opinion of as many voting students as
possible. The implications of a passed
or rejected amendment are too impor
tant to be left to the low voter turnouts
that have characterized previous
runoff elections.
In May 1987. less than half of those
who cast a vote in the first election
turned out for the runoff. In May 19%,
a mere 1,269 students, or less than 12.4
percent of the student body, turned out
for the runoff election compared with
the 30.1 percent turnout in the general
election.
Assuming last years general elec
tion undergraduate voter turnout rate
of approximately 59 percent holds, the
stakes for saving the redistricting
amendment for a runoff election
appear higher than ever. Rather than
placing the initiative in front of as
many students as possible, the ASSU
has left the decision to be considered
by what will probably be a significant
ly smaller group of people.
The inability of the ASSU to bring
this amendment to the attention of the
entire student body during the general
elections has evidenced a lack of
accountability on the part of those who
initiated it — exactly what the amend
ment itself intends to improve. The
ASSU has lost its chance to effectively
act on the voice of the majority of the
voting student body by leaving this
drastic measure to an election which, if
it occurs, will probably continue in the
low turnout tradition of the past.
