Course guide was a good
first attempt
Quit whining.
That's my response to Damen Downs'
and Ray Park's thoroughly unhelpful let
ter about the ASSU Course Guide in
Tuesday's Daily.
These two are adept at complaining,
but they don't offer any concrete sugges
tions for improvement.
It seems all they would like to do is
attack Matt Spence, the one ASSU sena
tor who seems to have put any time into
an even somewhat useful project.
Development hasn't stopped on our
end and the course guide will continue to
grow and improve.
Would Damen and Ray prefer not to
have any course guide? If something can't
be perfect, they seem to be saying that we
shouldn't bother at all. By that standard,
nothing would ever get done.
Rome, as the saying goes, wasn't built
in a day, and Stanford's initial student
body numbered only 559 students. Great
things don't spring up overnight.
If vou don't like the course guide, don't

use it. And if "the eourse guide has been
(your) first major disappointment at Stan
ford," you've led a remarkably sheltered
existence.

The Daily editorial defending Founders'
Day was welcome. In judging Leland
Stanford, his whole record should be
examined; it was positive.
Stanford celebrated Founders' Day on
April 5 with a discreet ceremony. Presi
dent Casper laid a wreath on the Mau
soleum and made an appropriate speech.
Then a procession to Memorial Church
led to the main ceremony, which was fol
lowed by an elegant luncheon in the Quad
to which all were invited.
To the west of the Quad is the site of
the new science quad, for which some
buildings have been leveled. Between the

two quads, unscathed, stands the sacro
sanct statuary celebrating gay liberation.
Meanwhile the attractive family group
of the Stanfords, which was formerly the
centerpiece of Memorial Quad, still sur
vives ignobly in the dust and chaos of an
outdoor storage area, forgotten and
unhonored — or should I say dishonored?
My previous protest has produced no
result. The group, which is traditional and
attractive, is dismissed as Victorian or too
sentimental. Obviously the family does
not rate high in Stanford values.
Here is a suggestion which should
appeal to egalitarians. Rescue the statu
ary from ignominy and place it next to that
celebrating gay liberation, with a plaque
inscribed "Two ways of life."

They're baa-ack! Election time is here
again and predictable as ever. So are those
fluorescent / vomit-colored, slogan-bear
ing leaflets.

It seems as though you can't walk 4 feet
without being bombarded by a half
rhyming couplet proclaiming the virtues
of somebody you've never heard of. Or a
leaflet begging you to vote for an exotic
special-fee request.
1 think I speak for the majority of the
campus when I say that we, students of
Stanford University, would rather NOT
have our private time in the bathroom
taken up reading silly fliers. (I've heard
that the local fluorescent trees would also
rather spare their progeny from this annu
al demoralization.)
For the last three years, I have fallen
into the trap of voting for the people
whose names ring a bell. "Dedicashen,
devoshen, etc." "Know the way, vote for
Chris K!"
What did I really know about the peo
ple I've voted for except that they were
lucky enough to have a name that
rhymes?
Make this year different. First of all,
make an effort to learn about the candi
dates.
These people actually do have an effect
on your lives. Listen to their ideas, and
vote for people on platforms, not on pop
ularity or good looks.

Second, when all else fails, vote for the
people whose names you don't recognize
on the ballot.
They were kind enough to take your
sanity into account when they thought
about their election campaign.
And hopefully, they'll continue to keep
your sanity in mind when they run your
school.
