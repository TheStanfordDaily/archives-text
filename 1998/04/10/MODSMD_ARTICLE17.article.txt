## Demand action from ASSU 
### 
ASSU candidates
should really
consider running
their campaigns in a man
"rter that is similar to the
way the Stanford Tree is
chosen. Last year, I know
you wanted to see Emily
Andrus wrestle a pig in

I o
White Plaza while Ben Decker spanked his
own buttocks and chugged whiskey by the
quart.
Who are Emily Andrus and Ben Deck
er, you may ask? Why, they are the presi
dent and vice president of the ASSU. How
have they served you in the last year? I am
pondering the same question.
Let us consider their recent perfor
mance with the housing changes, some
thing Stanford students care a great deal
about.
During the time when nobody knew
which houses would be given to sororities
or if anyone had anything to worry about or
who was even making the decision, Emily
and Ben stood by happily.
When it was announced that Alpha Sig
would be given to the Kappa Alpha Theta
sorority, who was first to tell Residential
Education that the Thetas did not want a
Cowell Cluster house and that Alpha Sig is
held sacred by some students? Did you
accidentally say Emily and Ben? I'm sorry.
They said nothing to represent the student
outcry.
When it was announced that Kimball
and Toyon would no longer have freshmen.

Emily and Ben stood by instead of noting
that the residents of those dorms should
have had some input in the decision.
Where were Emily and Ben when Res
Ed decided that graduate resident assis
tants should no longer be paid? You
guessed it, still standing.
When one-sixth of the undergraduate
student body signed a petition IN LESS
THAN 16 HOURS asking Res Ed to
reconsider removing the Alpha Sig com
munity, Emily and Ben followed the Res
Ed and University model by not respond
ing.
In the times when we needed them
most, times in which we needed some sort
of official leader to speak out in our favor,
Ben and Emily were quiet. I hope Emily
feels great every time she looks at her
resume and sees the title ASSU President.
On a resume that seems like such an
impressive achievement... if only the out
side world knew how meaningless that title
has become.
There is this misconception th;tt the
ASSU has no power and cannot really have
much impact on University decisions. This
is only because many people in the ASSU
do not realize that you can stop kissing ass
once the campaign is over. For example, a
condemnation of a University action by the
ASSU is not taken lightly. However, Emily
and Ben were too timid to exercise this
power and have allowed the misconception
to last another year. Thus proudly continu
ing the ASSU's tradition of impotence.
All 1 am asking for this year is a presi

dent and vice president who have the guts
to speak out when students are treated
unfairly. I am asking for a pair who truly
represents the undergraduate and — as
much as I hate to acknowledge those little
white-helmeted devils — the graduate stu
dent bodies.
After looking at this year's slate of can
didates, you need to decide which pair is
most likely to speak up for the students
rather than just running for the titles alone.
I am confident that Maren Norton and San
tos Marroquin are the most likely to finally
give Stanford students some real leaders.
These are people who are not afraid to
tell the University it has made a mistake,
and they are willing to work hard until
things are changed. Currently, Norton has
the reputation of being the hardest working
member of the ASSU Senate and has
chaired both the Budget Finance Commit
tee and the Appropriations Committee.
Marroquin has chaired the senate's Stu
dent Affairs Committee. In addition he is a
two-time kitchen manager in the Cowell
cluster and co-editor in chief of The Stan
ford Chapparal.
Norton and Marroquin have remained
committed to fair campaigning and not
abusing the positions they already occupy. 1
encourage you to join me in voting for a
pair of candidates committed to the stu
dents, not just to wearing their titles.
