# Only human
## Jocelyn Wiener Armchairs in the sky and whispers in the dark

MY FIRST VISION of God crystal
lized when I was 6 years old. I le
was a gaunt old man with graying
features, settled comfortably in a plush red
velour armchair. Together with my two
absent grandparents who were mytholo
gized in my imagination, he watched down
on me from a puffy white cloud, chatting and
sipping Scotch.
By the time I was K, I found his face
rather hard to distinguish from that of Dan
Rather. While such a comparison might
spark an indictment of naive trust in the
media, it was also a mark of the distinct
admiration I had for God's purveyor of
truth, one who acknowledges human woe.
My mom always flipped the television off
when the sports came on. God did the good
news, the bad news and the weather. Mark
I'urdv did sports, and we hated Mark Purdy.
Not long past the age of K, I began to rec
ognize that my conception of God was not
fully plausible. How could all of the people
in heaven fit on one living room couch on a
cloud? And did I really want all of those
people watching me? I was a pretty good kid

in the forgiving eyes of grandparents and
nice guys like God. Hut I did swipe the occa
sional cookie or pull my younger brother's
pants down when he wasn't looking.
Slowly, my quiet living-room God began
to melt away as more of my close relatives
and family friends began to die. I needed a
comfortable place in heaven for them to
rest, too.
By the time I took my wobbling steps into
fifth grade, I was confronted not only with
logistical but also political dilemmas of my
conception of God. How could (iod be ('au
casian, male and comfortably middle class?
Wasn't this conception of God merely a
paternalistic construct embedded in the
misogynistic paradigm of the dominant cul
ture? (()f course, I was in fifth grade and si ill
fairly liberated from the multisyllabic colle
giate linguistic code.) But why did God look
like Dan Rather and not Oprah Winfrey or
Connie Chung?
St) my God metamorphosed as I extract
ed the physical humanity from his image.
Instead of "He" or "She," I now wrote "G
-d" (without the 'o') — a Jewish practice

designed to keep the sanctity of the term
intact. My sixth-grade teacher often marked
off for misspelling, hut I persevered. M v new
interpretation of the Almighty resembled
the landscape in an untouristed area of
Yosemite. With rainbows and mist and
greenery and mountains, Ansel Adams
could have been my Moses if he had taken
photographs in color.
In sixth grade, too. I became more con
cretely aware of the horrors of the Holo
caust. as embodied in the twisted limbs ol
my ancestors. I dredged from their memo
ries the cruel, biting stereotypes that had
been lodged in six million Jewish deaths,
leased as 1 was for my unfortunate last
name, I became more and more embar
rassed to speak of (iod. My desire to high
light another difference and possible cause
for mockery was at best less than urgent.
"1 am Jewish," I would tell people, "but
not very Jewish." I his was during junior
high school. Even when I had my Bat Mitz
vah in eighth grade, I believed in God. but
only in whispers after the lights had been
turned out.

By the time I reached high school, most
ol my closest Jewish, Catholic and Hindi
friends had taken communion with atheism,
as had my 10-year-old brother. I admired the
certainty ol their rejection ol that which I
also knew, intuitively, to be Fiction. As time
went by. there was no religious theme wor
thy of our conversations.
At the same time, other friends of mine
had swung in the opposite direction. Born
into non-practicing families, they now clung
with outstretched hands to the glowing
social worlds of ( hristian youth groups. I
was envious of the sureness with which they
pronounced a fundamental reason for exis
tence. Those who had read Revelations
were especially urgent, as they confided in
me their hopes to rescue me from the hell
lire where I am currently destined to spend
eternity.
It prodded to describe, defend or detail
my faith. I would do so hesitantly. I could tell
them about my religion. Judaism, but I
didn't know il that would tell much about
me. I had grown up lighting the candles on
the menorah, making hamantaschen on

Punm and hunting for the afikomen at
Passover. I grew up with my grandfather's
stories of concentration camps, with Moses,
Abraham, and Joseph and the coat of many
c< >lors.
"Are you very religious?" people would
ask ■'No," I always said. "No. I guess not." I
had once known a (iod who sat in an arm
chair in the sky. smiled benevolently from
the 6 o'clock news, and intervened in every
rainbow as a million drops of divine mist.
But this Ciod no longer made sense. And
while I had once known a Sunday school
I ruth, I now knew its opposite — not
Untruth, but unknowing — no capital let
ters. no certainty
And so I believed my religion had left me
with nothing. I'his is somewhat true. But my
blood still tinjzl with the mild throb of cul
ture: my mind till peruses its faded, well
loved history and occasionally my lips
blow whispers the dark to the \ivid mem
ory of (iod.
