### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
Warren Christopher, man of ne
gotiations, Stanford alumnus and
former U.S. Secretary of State,
spoke at Kresge Auditorium yester
day. The lecture was titled "The Ne
gotiator."

Christopher talked about quali
ties that are necessary in a negotia
tor, including mastery of subject
matter, creative and constructive
problem-solving and patience.
Christopher adhered to the phi
losophy that "some things are so im
portant that you can't let the other
side's negotiating style let you
down," a lesson he learned early on.
When negotiating with Syria,
Christopher realized that eating was
essential to negotiating skills. Dur
ing meetings that would take as long
as 14 hours, no food would be
served.
The negotiator "needs to think
out of the box," he added.
"Without negotiation, we would
live in a world where war and litiga
tion are a customary rather than an
exceptional outcome of conflicts."
He emphasized the importance
of law in international relations. "1
believe lawyers should be trained as
negotiators rather than gladiators,"
Christopher said.
Law School Dean Paul Brest in
troduced Christopher, acknowledg
ing that without him and his negotia
tions, children of the Middle East
and Bosnia would still be plagued by
war.

Christopher remarked that the
"turnout for his lecture was larger
than that of the 8 a.m. lectures dur
ing his third year" at the Law School.
University President Gerhard
Casper was "absolutely intrigued"
by Christopher's speech. "I found
that his ideas also apply to my daily
life. These characteristics [of a nego
tiator] are useful in almost any job,"
he said.
Freshman Travis Neal chose to
come to the lecture to "see Warren
Christopher because his name is al
ways the one in the newspaper."
Christopher's accomplishments
have earned him high honors. He
was the first Stanford graduate to
give a Ralston Lecture.
Christopher's speech was only
the eighth Jackson H. Ralston Lec
ture in International Law, a lecture
series established in 1977 at the Law
School for people who have made
distinguished contributions to the
development of the role of law in in
ternational relations.
Previous Ralston lecturers in
clude former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter. Czech Republic President
Vaclav Havel and former Prime
Minister of Canada Pierre Elliot
Trudeau.
