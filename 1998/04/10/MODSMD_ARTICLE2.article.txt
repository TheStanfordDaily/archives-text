"To eat without wine is not to
eat." That was what senior Andrew
Pelletier's host family told him
when he stayed with them as a part
of Stanford in Florence. They
served him generous amounts of
wine every night. Pelletier i- but
one of many students who ire ;r id
wine lovers.
Pelletier's love for wine started
early in life.
"My fascination and enthusiasm
for the art of wine began as a child,
when my family had red table wine
at dinner," he said.
Another senior. Wade DeGot
tardi, has been interested in wines
since his freshman year.
"Wine is a passion for me. and a
growing obsession," said DeGot
tardi. whose parents have always
been interested in wine. They
would often go to Christie's and
Sotheby's auction houses in New
York to buy cases of wine.
Biology doctoral student Alex
Domin grew accustomed to a life
with wine when in Europe.
"I lived all my life in Italy, and
wine is a part of the daily ea'ing
habits," Domin said. "I remunh i
friend's eighth birthday patty
where we got wine mixed with
water."
"But 1 never appreciated it until
I was about 16. when my parents
made me try some of their very
good wines."
A wine-tasting class at Colum
bia University helped DeGottardi

hone his discriminatory skills.
While in New York, he joined a
local wine society which held wine
tasting competitions.
"Wines have become increas
ingly popular and important for
young people in my generation,"
DeGottardi explained. "The only
problem is that these young people
have indiscriminate tastes. We are
so near Napa Valley, yet most stu
dents opt for cheap beer at frat par
ties."
Freshman Khara Ramos agreed.
"I enjoy wine. Who wouldn't? But 1
wish I could be able to know more
about them."
One of the best ways to learn
more about wine is to go out and
start tasting them.
"Go to the Napa and Sonoma
regions," Pelletier recommended.
"Visit all the various wineries. Go
tasting."
Many of the wineries, such as
Mondavi, have instituted tours to
educate the public about the wine
making process. To know more
about what wine connoisseurs look
for in a bottle, Pelletier suggested
buying a copy of Wine Spectator or
some other wine magazine.
Pelletier personally enjoys Napa
V alley /infandels, while DeGottar
di prefers French Bordeaux wines.
Said DeGottardi, "I often look
for a muscular, meaty wine — I'm a
man. you know — with so much
body that it's practically bursting
out of its constraints."
