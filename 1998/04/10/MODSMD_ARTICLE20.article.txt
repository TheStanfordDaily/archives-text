Alleging discrimination and repression of speech.
President of the European / American Issues Forum
Louis Calabro has sent a letter of complaint to the
Board of Trustees and the Law School.
Calabro said European American issues were not
fully represented at the Law School's "Colloquium on
Race in the 21st Century," held last weekend.
As president of the European / American Issues
Forum, a local nonprofit civil rights organization ded
icated to preserving the civil rights of all European
Americans, Calabro said he had hoped that the con
ference would meet its stated goal of facilitating frank
discussion about race, including viewpoints from vari
ous philosophies and experiences.
The* colloquium hosted several panels to discuss
race issues. Calabro was an audience member of the
panel discussions on criminal justice and coalition
building.
Calabro went up to the microphone address the dis
parate impact also experienced by European Ameri
cans in the criminal justice system and the lack of Eu
ropean American representation at the conference.
According to both panelists and audience members
who were present. Calabro spoke extensively, bel
ligerently imposing his views on the audience. Harvard
Law Prof. Charles Ogletree, a panelist at the discus
sion, said Calabro prevented other people from ap
proaching the microphone to ask questions. Calabro
said that the microphone was shut off before he had
finished speaking.
Calabro wrote the letter specifically in regard to the
issues addressed at the panels. He said the panel on
criminal justice concluded that a "negative disparate
impact is experienced by African Americans in our
criminal justice system." but neglected to consider the
question of negative disparate impact being experi
enced by European Americans.
In order to prove his point. Calabro cited that in all
of the 405 civil rights cases prosecuted by the Depart
ment of Justice in the last 20 vears, there has not been

one case where the primary victim was a European
American. He said he feels that many district attor
neys target European Americans in the prosecution of
hate crimes.
Ogletree said that although he agrees alleged dis
criminatory practices of this kind are unfair, Calabro
was not at the colloquium "to get support for his posi
tion but to get as much air time as he could."
Terry Gray, vice president of the Black Law Stu
dents Association at Stanford, was at the panel and
said the microphone was not turned off because Cal
abro was expressing contradictory views, but because
of his offensive attitude and rudeness.
In regard to Calabro's concern that there was a lack
of representation of European American viewpoints
at the panel, Ogletree responded that his premise was
false because the majority of the program's attendees
were non-minorities.
Janice Strong, co-chair of the steering committee
that organized the conference, offered that Calabro
could have come forward earlier before the start of the
conference and made cooperative efforts with the co
ordinators to ensure that European American view
points would be fully treated.
Calabro said he believes that there is a concerted ef
fort by the United States government, some civil rights
groups and some parts of the media, to portray Euro
pean Americans as "the" purveyors of racial animus
toward other racial groups and"the" perpetrators of
hate crimes. While he acknowledges that a substantial
number of civil rights violations are indeed committed
by European Americans, a substantial number of
racially motivated crimes are also committed against
European Americans, he said.
The coordinators of the conference said they aimed
to have many different viewpoints represented and be
lieve that this initiative was accomplished. "In my ex
perience. this conference was unparalleled in its will
ingness to hear discordant views or issues about race,"
Ogletree said.
"There was a wide diversity of viewpoints covering
a wide spectrum of racial opinions and ideas," Gray
said.
