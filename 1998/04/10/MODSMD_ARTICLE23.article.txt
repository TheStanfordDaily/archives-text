## 
### Will Flemming Contributing writer 
All season long, the Stanford women's golf team
has played well and won on its home course. Stanford
head coach Caroline O'Connor was only concerned
about the team's play away from the Stanford course
— until last weekend's convincing victory at the Ari
zona State Invitational in Tempe.
The Card took home the team title in that tourna
ment. while freshman Hilary Homeyer tied for the in
dividual title.
Alter winning on the road, the confident Cardinal
returns home to host the Peg Barnard California Clas
sic this weekend, and looks to re-establish its domi
nance at the Stanford Golf Course.
"1 think that when we won the tournament earlier
this fall, a lot of people thought it was just because we

were playing at home," freshman Stephanie Keever
said after the win in Tempe.

Keever tied for 13th.
"Most people probably thought that the success of
our young team was a fluke." Keever said. I think we
proved them wrong [last) weekend, and I think we will
continue to gain confidence this weekend.
The three-day tournament boasts a strong 14-team

lield. including last year's champion. San Jose State.
"San Jose State had a strong tournament" in Tempe.

solid team effort on Saturday to catch them, and I was re
ally happy to see us step up to the challenge
Despite its earh success on the Stanford course, it is
extremely important for the Card to regain its home
form, considering that the upcoming NCAA West Re
gional will take place on the Farm.
"We have shown that we can pla\ quite well here all
year." O'Connor said. "1 think that hosting the West
ern Regional here will help our young team consider
ably \\ e need to have a strong showing here this week
end to regain that early-season confidence."
Considering its impressive performance a week
ago. it is hard to believe that the C ardinal will not re
turn home this weekend and once again dominate the
field.
