### Michaela Crouch Staff writer 
Last night in a match against Bay
Area rival California, the defending
national champion Stanford men's
volleyball team posted a victory, but
its record stays unchanged.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal (14-7,
13-6 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) defeated the Golden Bears
(14-3. 8-2 Northern California Colle
giate Volleyball League) in a close
four-game match, 15-13, S-15, 15-9,
15-12.
MEN S VOLLEYBALL
■ Last night's result: No. 6 Stanford (14-
7) defeated California (14-3) 15-13. 8-15,
15-9,15-12.
■ Tomorrow: No. 6 Stanford vs. UC-
Santa Cruz (4-11) at 7 p.m.. Burnham
Pavilion.
At Cal. men's volleyball is a club
sport, so last night's match was not
sanctioned by the NCAA and will
not affect the Cardinal's record.
However, Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves viewed it as "a good
practice match.''
"With two weeks off from league
play." freshman setter Brad Griffith
said, "a match like this helps us to
stay focused."
The Cardinal attack was led by
sophomore outside hitter Josh Pala
cios. who posted a team-high 23 kills.
"We've always known that if Pala
cios hits effectively, it gives us a
boost because he does so many other
things so well." Nieves said.
Freshman middle blocker Dan
Zhang, who has seen limited match
time this season, hit a match-high
.526 while adding 13 kills for the Car
dinal. Zhang also totaled six blocks.
Junior middle blocker Jeremy
Bart posted a .438 hitting percentage
(10-of-16 hitting with just three er
rors), in addition to recording two
aces for the Cardinal total.
"Bart's deep-float serves have
gotten to the point that they are very
intimidating and our opponents
dread them," Nieves said.

Senior swing hitter Devin Pool
man posted match-highs in both digs
and service aces, eight and three, re
spectively.
Stanford mistakes made an at
tempted game-two comeback diffi
cult. The Cardinal made errors on
four of its first six serves in addition
to making 11 hitting errors.
After falling behind 4-11 in game
two, Stanford brought freshman out
side hitter Curtis Graham into its
lineup. Last night marked Graham's
first collegiate match appearance.
"Although we lost game two. Gra
ham did a nice job of going in and
helping turn the momentum back in
our favor." Nieves said.
Game two exemplified some Car
dinal weaknesses that may hurt its
effort to defend its national title.
"We're not executing well."
Nieves said, "and we need to execute
to be successful in the MPSF tourna
ment."
Stanford looks to add another vic
tory tomorrow night in its final regu
lar-season match. The Cardinal will
face UC-Santa Cruz (4-11) at 7 p.m.
in Burnham Pavilion.
The Banana Slugs finished last
season as the No. 5 team in NCAA
Division 111. with an 8-13 record
overall and a 4-10 record against
NCAA opponents. Stanford won the
last meeting between the two teams
3-0.
Santa Cruz returns three starters
from last season's squad — senior
middle blocker Adrian Sosa, junior
middle blocker Matthew Paine and
sophomore setter Derek Newcomer.
Stanford knows little about its op
ponent. and the Card is not really
concerned about its lack of knowl
edge.
"We're not going to worry about
their personnel," Nieves said.
"We're going to focus on our own
play."
Although tomorrow's match will
have no impact on the Cardinal's
postseason standings, it is a helpful
one for Stanford to play.
With two weeks off from league
play entering the MPSF tournament,
matches like last ninht's against Cal

and tomorrow's against the Banana
Slugs allow the Cardinal to eet on the
court and play competition other
than itself.
Stanford's place in the postseason
now depends on the pla\ of No.
Long Beach State. An\ 49er loss will
give the Cardinal home-court advan
tage in the first round of the MPSF
tournament as runner-up in the Pa
cific Division.

With just n\cr one week left in
preparation tor the postseason, the
Cardinal is looking to add one more
vietor\ in an effort to gain momen
tum.
"We knovs as well as anyone we
are a dangerous team.' Sieves said.
"We've gotten to the point that when
we pla\ well, execute and keep our
hitting errors down, there's not a lot
that our opponent can do about it."
