ford's men's tennis team's specialty,
and it plans to keep it that way this
weekend when it faces Arizona State
and Arizona.
MEN'S TENNIS
■ Today: No. 1 Stanford (14-0. H-0
Pac-10) vs. Arizona State (K-8. 3-6)
at 1:30 p.m., Taube Family Tennis
Stadium.
■ Tomorrow: No. 1 Stanford vs. Ari

1 lead coach Dick Gould's biggest
concern is the weather.
"What do 1 expect from the week
end?" he said. "Well, I hope it

doesn't rain."
Top-ranked Stanford (19-0. 8-0
Pacific 10 Conference) first takes on
Arizona State (8-8. 3-6) today at 1:30
p.m. at the Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium. The Sun Devils are the only
team to have taken a doubles point
away from the Cardinal this season.
However, that match was played in
l empe. Ariz., and not at Stanford s
home courts, where the players have
dominated.
Ciould attributes the tough match
earlier this year to difficult playing
conditions, including high altitude
and wind.
"I hope we can redeem ourselves
after losing the doubles point to ASI I
down there," Ciould said. "I don't
want to be down that first doubles
point again like we were last time."
Although the Sun Devils are a
solid team. Gould said the match
would probably prove to be less diffi
cult at home than if the team was
traveling.
"We had very gix>d matches in
Arizona under trying conditions,
having just come off finals week and
that break," Gould said.
The Cardinal boasts a lineup of
sophomore Bob Bryan at No. 9. twin
Mike Rrvan at No. 13, junior Kvan
Wolters ranked 38th in the country,
and senior captain Paul Goldstein at
45th. To cap it off. the doubles teams
of the Bryans and Goldstein and
Wolters are ranked at fifth and sev

enth, respectively.
On Saturday. Stanford will take
on Arizona (5-9.2-6 Pac-10) at noon.
The Cardinal had very little trouble
with the Wildcats earlier this season
when the team traveled to Tucson.
Gould said that with all of Stan
lord's players healthy, he does not ex
pect the Arizona schools to present
huge challenges this weekend.
"1 expect good matches [from
Stanford's players] right down the
line." Gould said. "We're the fa
vorite. as we should be. hut if we're
not ready for them, they could take a
bite out of us."
This weekend's matches are the
last Pac-10 competitions this season.
After Saturday, the Card only has
one home match left, making these
two matches particularly important
for the team.
