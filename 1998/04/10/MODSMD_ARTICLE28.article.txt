The Stanford track and 112 ield jug

qualify for N( A As.
TRACK AND FIELD
■ Tomorrow: Stanford competes in
the Brutus Hamilton Memorial Invi
tational in Berkeley.
Stanford's women are fresh off a
win at the Bob Mathias Relays in
Fresno, a meet in which Stanford's
men placed third.
The women hope to match, it
not improve upon, last year's third
place finish, and the men will also
try to post strong marks before the
teams head to larger meets such as
next week's Mt.-Sac Invitational
and the upcoming Penn Relays.
Stanford will be one of 14
schools sending athletes to the
meet at Cal. which was formerly
known as the Golden Bear Invita
tional. Other participating teams
include Boise State. Cal. Cal
State-Bakers field. Cal Poly-SLO.
Chico State. UC-Davis, Hum
boldt State, Nevada, Ohio State.
Oregon. Sacramento State. I JSC
and Wisconsin. Nevada and Wis
consin will send only their
women's squads.
According to head coach Vin
Lananna, Oregon is the team to
watch in the overall competition for
both the men and the women. Al
though the women may face added
competition from Nevada and Wis
consin, Lananna said that the
Card's balanced attack of throws,
jumps, sprints and distance running
could help it to a team title.
Despite the large number of
teams participating, each school
may enter only two participants of
each gender per event. The top

eight finishers in each event will
score points for their team.
The first and only event to be
contested on Friday is the hammer
throw. I'he women will begin
throwing at 1 p.m. and will be fol
lowed by the men at 3 p.m.
Saturday's first field event, the
men 's javelin throw , is scheduled to
begin at 9 a.m.. and the men's and
women's 400-meter run.the first
track event, will follow at 11 a.m.
Stanford's representatives have
yet to be announced, but according
to Lananna, athletes participating
in this weekend's meet will be those
not already slated to participate in
next week's larger Mt.-Sac Invita
tional.
"We don't want to do anything
that might hurt next week's perfor
mance." Lananna said.
He concedes that few national
qualifying marks are likely to be set
in the weekend's meet, but out
standing marks are not the team's
only goal.
"The competition is always two
fold," Lananna said. "There is the
qualifying mark aspect and the
team victory aspect. This meet is
more of a team effort."
Nevertheless, with the tremen
dous crop of \oung athletes on the
Stanford squads, it would be no sur
prise to see many qualifying marks
set for participation in the Pacific 10
Conference meet, which is sched
uled lor May 23-24.
Sophomores Brad and Brent
Hauser have already posted autiF
matic qualifying marks for
NCAAs The Hausers qualified in
the 10.000-meter run. The men's
team also has 10 athletes provision
ally qualified to compete at nation
als.
I'he women's team also boasts
four provisional qualifiers. Auto
matic qualifiers are guaranteed the
opportunity to compete at the na
tional meet, while pro\ isionai qual
ifiers compete on a space-available
basis.
