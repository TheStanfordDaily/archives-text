# Time to debate
## ASSU presidential candidates discuss their campaign goals 
### James Pritchard Contributing writer 
Five Stanford students got the
chance to play politicians last night at
the SC'BN-broadcasted ASSU presi
dential candidate debate.
It was an evening of grave de
meanors and passionate promises as
the candidates for ASSU president
— sophomores Matt Crystal and
Matt Spence and juniors Lisa Liao,
Mike Martinez and Maren Norton
— stated their platforms.
The debate title was somewhat of
a misnomer. The presentation con
sisted five questions with indepen
dent, one-minute responses from
each candidate and three-minute
closing statements, featuring little
comparison or reference to opposing
candidates.
With the exception of some clos
ing-speech comedy from Crystal and
a couple awkward misstatements
from other candidates, the debate
ran smoothly with few surprises.
Candidates presented their respec
tive three-point, four-point, and five
point plans in their opening state
ments. reiterating highlights in later
responses.
Student voice was the central
theme of the night, with anti-Resi
dential Education and pro-ASSI re
form sentiments the common trend.
The five explored the versatility of
the English language by finding nu
merous ways to verbalize the idea of
student voice.
Student representatives need to
work through University commit
tees. Liao said. "That's how you're
going to get the voice." she ex-«
pressed.
Norton felt that the key to student
voice was grass-roots organization
with a unified front led bv the ASSU

president and
vice president.
Spence
sought to foster
student voice
through town
hall meetings
where students
can express their

concerns to administrators over din
ner.
A "Step Up. Step Out" program
was proposed by Martinez, where he
and his running mate, junior Matt
Louie, would step out to dormitories
to hear students' opinions.
Finally, Crystal spoke with cyni
cism about the Res Ed issue. "The
ASSU needs to be completely honest
with students. There's not a whole lot
they can do about it." Crystal said
We just need to have taith in student
voice, he added
Later in the debate. Norton coun
tered her opposition, commending
her running mate junior Santi >s Mar
roquin. "[Marroquin] was anti-Res
Ed before it was cool to be anti-Res
Ed."
Spence raised the stakes in his
closing statement by pledging to re
sign from his position next February
if he and his running mate junior
Bianca Ling had not fulfilled their
five promises He also promised to
give back the $7.(KX) salar> that the
ASSU president receives.
Cry stal called and raised Spence's
bet. saving that he would resign, give
back his salary and pa\ Spence
$7,000.
But Martinez brought it back to
the heart of the issue, dramaticallv re
mindimrstudents. it's not about the
money... It's about the love for this
University."

Liao sought to get down to busi
ness. "What's the bottom line?" she
asked, 'it is you students, and that's
what we're here for,"was her firm re

sponse.
The final — and only — laugh of
the night went to Crystal, who stood
out as the most relaxed member of
the panel. "I'm sure both of you
watching this have seen all the fliers,"
lampooning SCBN's probable small
viewing audience.

I \c continued, asking students to
"ignore the Daily's endorsement
[for ASSI J president] next Tuesday.
It is unfair to put the vote in the
hands of seven students" who make
up The Daily's editorial board.
"Throw away next Tuesday's
Daily," he concluded.
