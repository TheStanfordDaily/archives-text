## Straight from the Capitol Byrd's-Eye View 
### 
Clinton s at it again. I can't believe
he was found innocent. Hes getting
away with murder. Let's review the
facts, shall we?
Clinton's former flame Billie Sue
Hatfield, and a male associate of hers,
Ludwig Wittgenstein, lay on the front
doorstep of their palatial Washington,
D.C. estate with their throats slashed.
The crack forensics team reported their
deaths to have occurred on March 23,
1951. Of course, Slick Willie has an alibi
for everything — he says he was in
Arkansas and also only 5 years old.
What he doesn't explain is the
paper trail and confusing actions that
all point like a pointing finger: a point
ing finger of guilt. No one knows why

he flew to Chicago's O'Hare airport to
catch a connecting flight to Africa
almost exactly one hour after the
deaths of Billie Sue Hatfield and Lud
wig Wittgenstein. After all. New York's
JFK Airport was much closer and actu
ally has flights to Africa.
It's also pretty odd that he flew to
Africa on some "goodwill" tour right
after the deaths of his ex-beau and this
century's most important philosopher.
One hour is exactly the amount of time
you would need to drive from D.C. to
Dulles International to catch a flight
after having killed two people.
And if he were innocent, why
would he flee the police with his friend
A 1 Gore? Unless, of course, a one

armed man did it, and Clinton was try
ing to prove his innocence by capturing
him. That would be understandable.
But still, why in a crappy white Ford
Bronco? He is the president; you might
imagine that he could afford something
a bit nicer.
But most incriminating of all is the
bloody glove found in the White House
and the bloodstains on Air Force One.
Actually, the entry in his journal says,
"March 23, 1951 — killed B.S.H. and
L.W. today. L.W. couldn't separate a
signifier from a signified if they each bit
him on separate buttocks, anyway," is
maybe the most incriminating.
But that bloody glove isn't helping
him either. DNA testing showed that

the blood came from Hatfield and
Wittgenstein. It was most likely from
some kind of slashing wound on the
jugular vein committed by a current or
former head of state. DNA testing also
showed that both of the victims were
very nice people who liked children
and kitties, and only wished for a hap
pier world for everyone.
Clinton's defense team has been fir
ing shots in the dark, accusing Louis
Farrakhan of planting the bloody glove
on Clinton's hand and dragging his arm
across the throats of the victims. It's all
a racist Republican conspiracy.
And yet, even in light of all the evi
dence, Clinton's approval ratings have
never been higher. The people just

don't want to know. One friend of mine
said, "Hey, what he does on his own
time is his own business. I don't see why
the American people care about whom
he murders or whatever. It wouldn't be
a big deal if he weren't president. Just
so long as the economy is going well,
that's what the president needs to be
concerned about, even though the
executive branch is structured to delin
eate foreign policy and has little control
over domestic affairs. I mean murder?
We're going to lose a mediocre presi
dent over that?"
Well, I am outraged, I tell you. Out
raged.
