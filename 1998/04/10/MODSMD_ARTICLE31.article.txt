# Easters around the world!

### Norma Majority Cultural correspondent 
This weekend is Easter,
and every good Christian
will be out celebrating the
death and resurrection of
Jesus Christ. But not
everyone celebrates the
same way! Each country
has its own way of praising
the joy of the Christ mira
cle.
Here in the United
States, we paint chicken
eggs and let the young

ones go and try to find them. We also go to
church to remember Christ's great sacrifice.
I his is the most sensible way to celebrate
Easter. The only thing more sensible would be
a giant talking white rabbit.
But in other countries, they do some crazy
stuff! In Spain, they march through the streets
shouting and yelling, carrying crosses, and eat

ing this strange food that is a mix of rice and
cumin and shrimp. They call it "pie-a-yah."
But the greatest of all Easter celebrations is
in the Kalahari Desert. They celebrate Easter
over 364 days. They wear loin-cloth costumes
and wander around the desert. When Easter is
over they return home, read the newspaper, do
some work at the office, and wait expectantly
for Easter to come around again.


Me and the Kalahari hushmen last Easter. That's me standing up there
