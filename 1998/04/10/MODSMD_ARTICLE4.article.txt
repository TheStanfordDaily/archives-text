## 
### Evan Moffic Kerry Shaw 
Six members of the 15-person search committee
for a new dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences held an open forum seeking student input
yesterday in the Lane History Corner. The most
prominent issue discussed was the need for the
University to hire more minorities, especially
women of color, for this position and for faculty in
general.

Nine members of the Black Student Union at
tended the forum, and several expressed the view
that the new dean should be a minority or. at the
very least, someone with a track record of promot
ing minority hiring.
The members of the committee, which is
chaired by Economics Prof. John Taylor, noted
that "the committee must consider as many people
as possible." Taylor also pointed out that the pri
mary qualifications for the ni >sition are outstanding

scholarship, teaching abilit\ and experience in fac
ulty administration.
I~he dean oversees the graduate and undergrad
uate programs in research, budget, hiring and spe
cial programs. The dean also oversees the tine arts,
languages and literatures. wial sciences math
ematics and natural sciences
I~he School of Humanities and Sciences is the
largest school at Stanford, with 2K de
partments. more than 4.5 CX) students
and several hundred professors.
When confronted with the statis
tics depicting the small percentage of
minority faculty at Stanford, the com
mittee's undergraduate representa
tive Bill Shen replied that it was
"more important to encourage mi
nority faculty recruitment from the
bottom up."
Committee member Kathy
Gillam. senior associate provost for
faculty affairs, also cautioned that
"minority faculty representation

varies within different departments,"
and that it is important to look at is
sues of minority faculty recruitment
carefully within the many depart
ments of the University.
When asked if she believed their
input would impact the committee's
recruitment process, BSU President
Mandi Attinasi said. "Because we
were such a major collective force,
we've made an impact and opened up
the committee's and students' eyes to
the issues we've raised."
The dean's position is appointed
based on nominations from Universi
ty officials.
The nominations have all been re
ceived, Shen said. Now they are try
ing to determine what the rest of

Stanford expects from the new dean.
"Before we enter the decision
making process, we want to hear
from community members about
how the decisions should be made,"
Shen said. "We don't have an agenda
in terms of a structured form. We just
want to open up discussion to anyone
who is interested."
The current dean. Economics
Prof. John Shoven, will end his five
year term this June. He plans to re
turn to his research and teaching, said
Asst. Humanities and Sciences Dean
Judith Cain.
The committee hopes to make its
recommendations to University
President Gerhard Casper in May,
who will make the final appointment.
