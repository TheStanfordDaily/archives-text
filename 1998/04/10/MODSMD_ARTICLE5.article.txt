Sophomore Matt Spence and junior Bianca Ling, who are running for ASSU president and vice presi
dent, said they will resign if they do not fulfill their six campaign promises by next February.
the ASSIJ." Spence said.
"I've been the Deputy Chair for the
senate this year and helped in making the
course guide and bringing about the town
hall dinners, which is the first time in 30
years that administrators have come to
talk to students face-to-face about con
cerns."
Spence also helped organize the fresh
man senator program and secure funding
for the freshman council.
Ling currently chairs the Asian Ameri

can Students Association. She feels her
time at AASA has taught her how to lead
an organization with a clear vision of the
role she should play.
"The center of our campaign is simple
and radically different from anything done
before," Spence said. "If we don't keep our
promises, we don't keep our jobs."
Ling said that both she and Spence
would resign if they did not keep their
promise to accomplish a list of six tasks
they have detailed in their campaign.
Both stressed that, if elected, the sole
focus of their administration would be de
voted to issues that directly affected stu
dents.
The six specific tasks that they plan to

complete by the middle of their term in
fehruary are creating an improved student
union with extended hours, increasing the
role that students' voices play in adminis
trative decisions, producing a significantly
improved and expanded version of the
ASStJ Course (iuide, increasing support
for student groups who could benefit from
the ASSU's resources, developing a World
Wide Web-based campus calendar of
events, and hiring a graduate student to
deal exclusively with graduate student af
fairs.
They also stressed the realism in their
election promises as an integral part of
their campaign.
"There are a lot of things that the ASSI I

can do for students hut also things that we
cannot do. We can't help you ace your
final, and we can't increase dating on cam
pus," Spence said.
Both feel that the go;ils they have set for
themselves are realistic. "All six points are
big, important things that affect students.,"
L.ing said. W"e have no choice but to carry
out our plans because we have committed
ourselves."
Some of the more general goals that
Spence and l ing would like to address are
the perceived lack of energy in current stu
dent government and the view that the
ASSII is apathetic.
In addition, Spence and I ing would like
to tackle the issue of tuition control. "Slu

dents should have a real voice in tuition
control, and there are ways the ASSU can
help students have a greater say in the
process and prevent tuition from increas
ing absurdly like it has been," Spence said.
I ing said, "Many of the things that we
are working toward are things that we can
build on. For example, if we were able to
extend Tresidder's evening hours by 2
hours initially, we could perhaps get them
to eventually stay open all night. Each goal
opens up more options."
Together, Spence and King feel that
their combined experience will allow them
to avoid the stumbling blocks that have
tripped up ASSI I administrations in the
past.
