# Talks continue past deadline

BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) — Nego
tiators for a Northern Ireland peace accord
pressed past their midnight deadline into today,
trying to reach a compromise over the province's
political future and end 30 years of sectarian vio
lence.
Before yesterday's midnight deadline, two
prime ministers, a former U.S. senator and the
province's key politicians said they would ignore
the clock and work overtime.
The leaders of the eight negotiating parties
emphasized that nobody wanted to waste the
momentum created hy the deadline pressure.
"We might have to shoot out the clocks at five
minutes to midnight, hut we'll get there." said
David Ervine, who leads a party linked with a
pro-British Protestant paramilitary group, the
Ulster Volunteer Force. " The gap is bridgeahle.
We have a decent chance of an agreement."
The midnight deadline passed without any
word from negotiators.
Northern Ireland's bloody history has been lit
tered with failed political initiatives ever since the
rise of street confrontations between Catholic
protesters and Protestant authorities in the late
19605.
But even success in these talks would not
mean a certain end to the shooting and bombing
campaigns waged sporadically by groups on both
sides of the political divide.
Past truces always have provoked damaging
splits between pragmatists and those determined
to carry on "armed struggle" to the end against
Britain and the north's dwindling pro-British
Protestant majority.
Late last night, about 200 Protestant hard-lin

ers from groups who boycotted the talks broke
through the gates surrounding Stormont. the
negotiating venue. They were stopped by riot
police with dogs.
The marathon deliberations kept the prime
ministers of Britain and Ireland, l ony Blair and
Bertie Ahern, effectively hostage, since both men
pledged to stay involved until a deal was reached
— or fell through.
"We have to prepare ourselves for the possi
bility that we may not be able to reconcile our dil
ferences," warned Gary McMichael, whose
Ulster Democratic Party represents the biggest
pro-British paramilitary group, the outlawed
Ulster Defense Association.
But Ervine said that wasn't an option.
"To walk away from here would mark the
destruction of a lot of political careers." he said.
One party did dramatically depart Castle
Buildings, the drab brown office in east Belfast
where the search for a compromise way to govern
Northern Ireland began in June 19%.
The Ulster Unionists, the pro-British Protes
tant party considered most central to an agree
ment. left for their headquarters to present the
emerging shape of an agreement to the group's
110-member executive committee.
A handful of Protestant hard-liners picketed
the entrance, but inside Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble received a standing ovation
before the news media was barred.
Most parties said substantial progress was
made yesterday on a key plank of any settlement
the structure and powers to be wielded b\ a
cross-border council of lawmakers linking North
ern Ireland with the Irish Republic.

Such an institution is supposed to promote
cooperation between both parts of Ireland. It's
essential to win support from the north's
Catholics, who oppose Northern Ireland's cre
ation as a Protestant-majority state 77 years ago.
The talks chairman, former I S. Sen. George
Mitchell, announced the deadline two weeks ago
in a hid to inject urgency into negotiations that
had continually bogged down in procedural wran
gles.
Should the politicians strike an accord. Britain
and the Irish Republic have promised to subject it
to referendums in both parts of Ireland in May
On Tuesday. Mitchell presented a 65-page
document intended to serve as the foundation lor
a settlement. I he I Ister I monists publicly reject
ed the document, hut presented an array of pro
posed amendments to Blair and Ahern on
Wednesday.
That angered the IRA-allied Sinn Fein parts,
whose chairman Mitchel McLaughlin con
demned what he called the I Ister I nionists'
attempt to "rewrite the document" and emascu
late the cross-border aspect of a peace package.
Sinn Fein was being pressed to accept a new
Northern Ireland assembly in which Protestants
and Catholics would share power, hut within a
state that the Irish Republican Army has sought
since 1970 to destrov

to have equal access to all senior positions in both

has gridlocked negotiations in the past, insist
they'll agree to that onl\ once the IRA starts dis
arming.
