Created in 1989 as a community service of Stan
ford Hospital, at a time when the baby boomer gen
eration needed more health information, the Health
Library "triggers the idea that it's OK (for people) to
get their own health info."
"We don't give medical advice, we help people to
narrow down their searches," said Barbara Ralston,
the library's director.
The library, a nonprofit organization providing
medical information and health education to com
munity members, currently has four branches located
at the Stanford Shopping Center, the Stanford Hos
pital, the Palo Alto Senior Center and the Peninsula
Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired. Its Inter
net "virtual branch" was launched in 1991 and is cur
rently the second-most visited part of the Medical
School's World Wide Web site.
Main resources for the library include clipping
files, reference books and health databases on the In
ternet.
Consumers' needs have also changed since 1989.
Ralton said when the library was first founded, infor
mation was hard to get.
Now, there is such an inundation of information
that the library spends more time helping people to
filter through the information.
The library is currently run by five staff members
and 120 volunteers. Ralston, Class of '75, started vol
unteering 10 years ago and became its director two
years ago.
Ruth Kasle, a Palo Alto resident who volunteers
as a reference associate, said, "I had actually used it
to get health information myself. I was impressed
with the service. When I retired, I began to volun
teer."
Now volunteering an average of three hours each
day, she said, "You get a real feeling that you are
helping someone."
In its third annual speaker series on American
health controversies, the library is bringing five pan
elists to speak on "Playing For Keeps: Sports, Exer
cise and Your Health" at Kresge Auditorium on
April 30.
