WASHINGTON (AP)
Stressing the importance of U.S.
involvement in Northern Ireland,
the chairman of the peace talks said
yesterday he hopes President Clin
ton will visit the region to encour
age people to accept an historic
peace agreement.
Former U.S. Sen. George
Mitchell heralded Clinton s role in
brokering the peace pact for North
ern Ireland last week and he
stressed that all sides must now
ensure ultimate success of the deal
to end three decades of sectarian
violence.
"This agreement reallv doesn't

finalize peace. It creates the oppor
tunity for peace and reconciliation."
Mitchell said on ABC's "This
Week." "It's a good first step, but
there's still a long way to go."
Mitchell said he believes a return
Clinton visit to Northern Ireland in
the coming months would bolster
support for the peace pact before a
voter referendum on May 22. Clin
ton traveled to both Northern Ire
land's capital. Belfast, and Dublin,
the capital of the Republic of Ire
land. in 1995.
"I know he's considering it." said
Mitchell, noting that Clinton is "the
onl\ American president ever to

have visited Northern Ireland while
in office (and) the first to make it ;i
high priority for American policy."
White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said a Northern Ireland
trip is under consideration by the
president but no definite plans have
been made. Clinton will be in the
region in mid-Mav for an economic
summit in England.
Clinton will meet today at the
White House with Mitchell "to get a
firsthand report" from the envoy he
appointed three years ago. Lock
hart said.
The president, who spent the
weekend at his Camp David presi

dential retreat in Maryland, took
more congratulaton telephone calb
yesterday from British Prime Minis
ter Tony Blair, who was at tlu
peace table. and Kofi Annan, secre
tary-general of the United Nations
"They were both basically u
express some gratitude for the pres
ident's help." Lockhart said of the
calls.
Rep. Peter King. R N.Y.. a con
fidant of Sinn Fein leader Ciern
Adams, said Clinton's engagement
could make or break the deal in the
upcom ing referendum.
"He's the linchpin here and he
can keep this together." King said.
