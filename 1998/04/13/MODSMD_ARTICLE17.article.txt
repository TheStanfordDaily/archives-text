Coed IM soccer scoring
rules fail to promote
gender equity

SPRING IS HERE, and all over
campus students are feeling the
urge to get in shape. From sailing
to aerobics to swimming and tennis.
Athletics Department classes are
filled. And for those who haven't built
exercise into their class schedules, res
idence-based intramural sports serve
as an oppotfunity to get a workout
while bonding with housemates.
Last week, sign-ups were held for
Division I. Division 11, and intramural
coed soccer. Division I and Division II
teams place no regulations on the
number of females on the field. Goals
scored by women and men are count
ed as being equal.
But such is not the case in coed IM
soccer. According to coed IM soccer
rules, at least three of the seven team
members on the field at any given time
must be female.
On one hand, making sure that
almost half of the people on the field
are female seems like an action that
strongly promotes gender equity. But
further examination shows that this is
where commitment to equality on the
field ends.
In an age when women are advanc
ing in all sorts of traditionally male

dominated fields and participating in a
wide variety of athletic events, there is
no excuse for scoring rules which are
downright patronizing.
According to coed IM soccer rules,
every goal scored by a man is worth 1
point and every goal scored by a
woman is worth 1.5 points.
Giving this "advantage" to women
is simply patronizing, because women
can be every bit as aggressive on the
field as their male counterparts.
Rewarding women with an extra
half point somehow makes it seem like
scoring a goal was an incredible
accomplishment that deserves to be
rewarded in a different manner.
It is inappropriate that the Athletics
Department would allow a program
that it administers to perpetuate out
dated stereotypes about women's ath
letic ability.
Presumably, one of the goals of
coed IMs is to promote equity, a sense
of community and a love of sports.
Simply put, practices that serve to
highlight perceived gender differences
seem to run counter to those ends.
We urge those who set the rules for
IM sports to think more carefully
about the impact of their decisions and
the subtle message they send about
sports and gender issues. If women
want to take the field with men, they
ought to be treated as equal partners.
We hope that coed IM soccer rules
will be adjusted in the future to reflect
gender equity.
