## An activist dressed in Armani 
### 
I SPENT SA TUR
DAY shopping at
the outlet mall in
Gilroy, and on Sunday I
led a workshop on polit
ical activism at a South
Asian American confer
ence. Sometimes I think
1 have a split personality

â€” 1 enjoy u.iak.ui,Armani Exchange as
much as I enjoy reading about anti-colo
nial struggle in India.
We all have multiple interests, and
sometimes these are contradictory or
problematic. For example, most of us love
Stanford for some reasons and hate it for
others.
I find, however, that it is difficult to he
accepted as both a political activist and a
mall rat. In the activist community, I often
feel like an outsider because I don't look
or act in the same way as many other peo
ple. In a crowd of bare-footed, long
haired. new-age hippie types, I feel out of
place even though my commitment to the
issues is no weaker than theirs.
Some of this is my own insecurity at
being different. But I do notice double
takes and questioning looks. I often feel
like I have to prove that I am "down"
enough. I know other people who have
progressive politics and do important
work, but feel uncomfortable calling
themselves "activists" since they don't fit
the convention.
When someone calls me an activist, I

often feel like I don't deserve the title. I
wonder if people would still use that label
if they knew how long it takes me to pick
out my clothes each morning.
But many of us are involved in the
same struggles that more traditional
activists work on, including racial and gen
der equality, environmental protection,
gay rights, poverty alleviation and so 011.
We may look different and use differ
ent methods to bring about change, but
ultimately we have the same goals. In fact,
Armani Activists can be effective where
others have failed, because we can work in
different circles and different ways than
more traditional activists.
This brings up the question of lip-ser
vice liberalism. Many times 1 have looked
disdainfully at self-identified progressive
Palo Altoans driving BMWs and ques
tioned the strength of their commitments.
But how am I different from them? I
too am a privileged person who claims
progressive politics, but watches Melrose
Place religiously and attends an elite pri
vate university.
There are always tensions between our
beliefs and our actions, and all of us are
hypocrites to some extent. This is some
thing I have come to accept as someone
who is a vegetarian for ethical reasons, yet
wears leather shoes. Fashion won out in
that debate.
I also go to a university that was found
ed by a racist railroad magnate, whose
athletes are sponsored by Nike and whose

student workers in the Coffee House get
paid more per hour than non-students.
Some of these contradietions are more
severe than others, and I don't want to
triviali/e them. People who protest the
exploitation of labor in Indonesia should
not wear Nike shoes. But most shoes are
made by poorly-paid laborers somewhere
in the United States or abroad.
Negotiating these discrepancies is diffi
cult: ft is impossible to live without
oppressing someone or something, since
exploitation and inequality are the basis of
modern capitalism.
Each of us must make these difficult
decisions. Not everyone can take the more
radical stance, and that does not necessar
ily mean they are "selling out." Many peo
ple do the best they can, given their
diverse loyalties. But not everyone is an
activist. Some people adopt the rhetoric,
but have little solid engagement or com
mitment.
The term activist needs redefinition.
There is still an important place for tradi
tional activism. But we shouldn't let that
form claim all legitimacy. I encourage all
activists, including the Armani species, to
continue the struggle.

Aly Remtulla is a senior majoring in
anthropology. He thinks Stanford should
terminate its athletic sponsorship by Nike
and engage in better investment responsibil
ity and association.
