Stanford's Sanskriti hosted its
third annual "Awaaz" conference
yesterday at Tresidder Union. A di
verse array of panelists and speak
ers addressed the concepts of identi
ty and conflict as part of the event.
Awaaz, which means "voice" in
Hindi, included a keynote speech by
Kartar Dillion. an activist for social
justice. In her address, Dillion spoke
much about her personal experi
ence growing up in a small timber
town in Oregon in the 19205.
"We were made to feel very dif
ferent," she said. "Our identity from
the very beginning was very differ
ent from the Europeans."
Dillion encouraged the audience
to look beyond race.
"I learned long ago that we are
all only human beings," she said.

Later. Dillion prompted the au
dience for questions, in line with
Sanskriti's larger goal for the event.
"We wanted to take [Awaaz] a
step further this year â€” to make it
more interactive," said sophomore
Shanaira Udwadia, one of the coor
dinators.
Included on the program for the
day were small-group discussions,
as well as several panel sessions,
ranging from "Are you Down and
Brown?" about activism in the
South Asian American community
to "The Next Generation," about
balancing American and Indian cul
tural values.
To lead these sessions, Sanskriti
"really looked for leaders in the
community; leaders of temples, of
youth groups and so on," said
Vikram Grover, a sophomore, who
w as one of the conference's coordi
nators.
1 he panel on "Overcoming Reli
gious Barriers," for example, was
moderated by Imran Maskatia, pres
ident of the Islamic Society at Stan
ford and a coterminal student in
computer science. The panel includ
ed community members such as.lee
van Zutshi. the current president of
the Indo-American Community
Federation and Man/oor Ghori,
founder of the Indian Muslim Relief
Community. The panel included a

charged discussion about the nature
of religious conflict in India as well ;is
prejudice among Indian Americans.
The conference closed with a
speech by Richard Yuen, the assi
tant dean of students, and included a
dinner afterwards.
The forum hit home for many of
those in attendance.
"I think it's important to discuss
these issues to gain a better under
standing of our identity," comment
ed Saad Rakim. a sophomore.
"Growing up in the I J.S., it's hard
to define what is your culture and
what is your experience within the
South Asian identity," observed
Grover. Sanskriti's issues officer.
