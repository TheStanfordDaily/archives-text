One alum's ASSU advice
I know that the only thing worse than
watching UC-Berkeley's marching band is
to listen to advice from old fart grads, but
here it is anyway.
When you proceed to choose your can
didates for ASSU president and vice pres
ident. ask yourself the following ques
tions:
1) Have you ever believed a candidate
who said he or she wanted to win an elec
tion in order to "help you?"
2) How often has the University volun
tarily looked to the ASSU as an equal
decision-making member regarding Stan
ford policy and/or conditions?
3) What good is a guarantee that allows
candidates to exit a job with some kind of
honor, if they prove to be inadequate?
4) Adding it up: Track record = 1 (K).
Promises = 0.
Based on my quite unscientific obser
vations of the candidates' statements. I
would recommend Mr. Crystal for the job.
At least he has an apparent grip on the
realism of student government's level of
influence and power.
Cienuine authority results only from
true freedom.

Do run ASSIJ campaigns
like the contest for Tree
In Friday's edition of The Daily, Casey
Ketterling suggested that ASSIJ candi
dates "run their campaigns in a manner
that is similar to the way the Stanford Tree
is chosen," hy performing such acts as
wrestling a pig. As a pig wrestler with
Responsible Individuals Brawling Swine
(RIBS) certification myself, I feel it is my
duty to reply to his suggestion.
First and foremost, pig wrestling is an
activity to be performed by trained profes
sionals only. It takes years of work first
inside the classroom, then with specialized
pig simulators, before one is allowed to
even begin wrestling a live pig.
I would hope that no ASSIJ candidate
has taken the advice from Friday's column
seriously, as I would fear for the safety
(and wonder about the sanity) of such a
candidate.
As for Mr. Ketterling's other sugges
tions that candidates might do better to
"spank 11hcir| own buttocks and chug
whiskey by the quart," GO FOR IT!

Education can benefit
from entertainment
In his column last week. David Ball
bemoaned the fact that the "shopping
period" emphasizes "entertainment over
education." a fact which, in his opinion is
"fatally flawed." He claimed professors
aim to entertain and students pick classes
based on entertainment value. This is
untrue.
Even if students used such criteria for
choosing, a professor would rather have a
small class of dedicated students than a
large class of students only looking for
entertainment.
It is thus in the professor's best interest
to be honest about the content of the
course the first week, and to teach in a
manner in which students would learn the
most all quarter.
In addition, there is something to be
said for entertainment. After all. the
more entertaining the lecturer, the more
likely I will recall the subject matter after
the class is over.
Since many people complain that stu
dents don't retain matter after the final
i.e., that they aren't truly educated — Ibis
is important.
Btuing professors teach forgettable
classes. Enthusiastic, entertaining profes
sors teach classes on topics their students
will remember for years to come.

Which brings us to the course guide.
Students at a top university should he able
to distinguish between entertainment and
teaching effectiveness and score profes
sors accordingly.
Students should be rightfully upset
after taking a course which had little sub
stance, no matter how entertaining it
might be. After all. we are here for an edu
cation. There are much cheaper means of
entertainment.
Some of Ball's opinions have nothing
to do with the shopping period. Students
would drop out of boring or otherwise dis
agreeable classes whether they had to sign
up for them before the first week of class
or after.
If there are students who value enter
tainment over education, it's their loss.
They probably shouldn't be here, and the
money and time they are wasting is most
ly their own. as they'll find out after grad
uation.
Besides, rare is the major in which all
classes have little content or challenge, let
alone high entertainment value.
