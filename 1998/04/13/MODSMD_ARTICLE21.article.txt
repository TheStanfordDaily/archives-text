# Listening to the voices
## Leaving Las Vegas as a pauper 
### 
Alda Leu

I SIT IN a seedy motel room, my com
puter screen illuminated by the glow
of neon lights. I frantically type away,
anxious to return to the casinos and lose
my Res Ed salary for the rest of the
month. It is impossible to tell whether it is
day or night; the neon lights overpower
any natural lighting. I gaze out the window
and am for a brief instant fascinated by the
methodical flashing of the word "Circus
Circus" over and over again. My eyes
glaze over, and I am entranced.
This same trance overtakes me when I
enter the brightly lit, ceaselessly noisy lair
known as the casino. My senses are over
taken by chaos. Smoke fills the air. Lights
flash. Scantily clad waitresses walk the
floor. Bells ring. Coins fall. People scream.
My usually level-headed friend.
"Bimal," tries his luck at the roulette
wheel and comes up short. He now runs
frantically to the nearest ATM because he
insists that he is "feeling lucky."
Yes, this is Vegas. And Potter is in the

house.
Okay, so not all of Potter is in the
house. In fact, only 15 of my dorm's 90 res
idents chose to make the trek with us to
the City of Sin. But those who came soon
realized that Las Vegas is truly the best
place for a dorm trip.
Sure, we did the customary dorm ski
trip to Tahoe and yeah, people bonded
and skied and hung out. Whatever.
But skiing is pretty much an individual
activity. And because most people want to
maximize their skiing time, everyone goes
to bed early.
Not so in Vegas. Gambling and drink
ing are decidedly group activities. Friends
can take up the whole table and make win
ning and losing more fun.
And sleep is secondary. The hotel
rooms have no clocks. The casinos have no
windows. Time is at a standstill and fatigue
is for "losers." To top it all off, the experi
ence is shared with dormmates. Even if
they were strangers before, shadows that

passed by in the hallways, they will now be
friends. The dorm that plays together truly
stays together.
Each person shares in the adventure.
The typical Las Vegas day runs something
like this:
Midnight: Play roulette.
12:30 a.m.: Win $30 Wonder how any
one can lose in Vegas.
1 a.m.: Decide roulette is not your
game. Play blackjack instead.
1:30 a.m.: Decide that blackjack is not
your game. Play craps instead.
2 a.m.: Decide that craps is not your
game. Count your losses. Play slots
instead.
4 a.m.: Decide that quarter slots are a
little bit too rich for your blood. Play nick
el slots instead.
4:45 a.m.: Hit a jackpot. Realize you've
won $5.
6 a.m.: Decide that sleep is a good
thing. Go to bed.
2 p.m.: Wake up. Realize your hair

smells like smoke. Shower.
3 p.m.: Realize that you are hungry.
Spend $5 on a buffet. Eat dreadful food.
4:30 p.m.: Hit the tables. Decide to
learn a new game. Try Caribbean Stud
Poker.
5:30 p.m.: Decide that Caribbean Stud
Poker is not your game. Realize you're
down to only $10. Decide to play carnival
games instead.
6:30 p.m.: Decide that hand-eye coordi
nation is not your bag. Wander dejectedly
through casino.
7:30 p.m.: Eat 50 cent hot dog.
8:30 p.m.: Take a nap.
10 p.m.: Dream that you've discovered
a fool-proof strategy for winning money.
11:30 p.m.: Wake up. Take cash out on
your credit card.
Midnight: Repeat cycle.
Interspersed with the above routine are
amusement park rides or sightseeing, hut
everyone knows that gambling is why the
crowds have come.

1 return to my computer and sit in my
room, again gazing into the awesomely lit
night. All around me the excitement
abounds. Fortunes are made and lost.
Lives are reborn and broken. Dorms revel
in Easter weekend debauchery.
And yet, the action around me is only a
vision in the recesses of my mind. The
reality before me is newspaper work, a
thesis and readings. 1 struggle to focus on
the task at hand. Soon, the bright lights,
the smell of smoke and the casinos on
every corner will be replaced with decep
tively cold days, unbearably long lectures
and bicycles at every turn. The Strato
sphere will become Hoover Tower, and
Treasure Island will become Lake Lag.
1 slowly pack my belongings, grateful
for the impoverishing respite.
Dejectedly, 1 return home a pauper.
