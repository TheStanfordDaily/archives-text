SURE is doing its best
I am writing in response to the letter
written by Kim Nieholas regarding SURE
Escort. In regards to the specific experi
ence which prompted her to write, I apol
ogize for the frustration and inconve
nience it caused.
The person working the phone called
her, as promised, 10 minutes after receiv
ing her request to tell her that the driver
was waiting for her outside. Regrettably,
the escort calling Ms. Nicholas must have
dialed the wrong number and received no
response.
Unfortunately, sometimes people find
other rides and decide not to take the
escort without letting us know. This is
what the calling escort thought had hap
pened.
The problem was that the escort did not
call again immediately to verify that he
had dialed the correct number. The escort

is a new employee and this will not happen
again.
Now onto the larger issues raised by
Ms. Nicholas. She stated that "the SURE
service is very ineffective at achieving its
stated goal of a safe ride" and"the setup
of the system means that few people can
benefit from it." She proposes a Mar
guerite style fixed route shuttle service to
rectify the situation.
I believe that the existing system is
superior to a Marguerite style system for a
number of reasons. A fixed route cannot
be run by golf carts due to the limited seat
ing available. Due to budget constraints,
the maximum number of carts running per
shift is two and it would take a golf cart 35
minutes to complete a comprehensive cir
cuit of the Stanford campus. With only 4
spots available per cart, a person could
easily be waiting indefinitely on a busy
night as the carts continually fill up at a
stopping point somewhere ahead of the
waiting person and pass by dropping the

passengers off somewhere farther along
the route.
The whole point of the existing door
to-door service is not convenience, hut
rather to make sure users of the service
are not at risk of being harmed when out
side alone at night. Most students would
rather have the door-to-door safety
offered by the current system instead of
having to wait outside alone in an unfamil
iar or desolate place.
While buying vans with a higher seating
capacity could solve this problem, this is
not financially feasible at current budget
levels. SURE Escort purchased golf carts
because virtually every campus location is
accessible to them.
Vans would not be able to pick up. and
drop off people at locations like Green
and Meyer libraries, most of the Main
Quad and some of the science and engi
neering buildings.
Also, a fixed route would make it
impossible to take people to cars parked in

remote, poorly lit lots. In addition, vans
could get stuck in heavy traffic whereas
golf carts can easily get around it.
Ms. Nicholas complains that the current
first-come, first-serve system enables few
people to benefit from the service.
On the contrary, SURE handles a very
large volume of requests each night.
Approximately 95 percent of callers
accept the wait given them. The first-serve
system is the fairest and best system.
In the vast majority of cases, the wait is
no more than 20 minutes. During extreme
ly busy periods when only one cart is run
ning (carts may be unavailable for mainte
nance reasons) the wait can sometimes
rise to double that. A wait of this length is
not unjustified to ensure personal safety.
Also, most people are calling from a
place indoors or surrounded by people, so
they are able to wait in safety for their
escort.
While we always try to escort people as
quickly as possible, our primary goal is to

provide safe transportation across campus
and this may entail some waiting bv users.
If you are in a party oi three or more
people and feel comfortable walking, we
ask that you please walk to your destina
tion so that others traveling alone can get
an escort more quickly. If you want to
avoid the possibility of a long wait on busy
nights, you can always call 5-SURE in
advance and request a pick-up at a specif
ic time and location later that night.
There is incredible demand for Sl'RE's
services. We do everything we can to
accommodate it within our budget limita
tions while striving for improved efficiency
and providing the highest level of safety
possible to the Stanford community.
Any questions, comments, or sugges
tions you may have are welcome. I can be
reached at joneis(p leland or you can leave
a message at 5-SURE.
