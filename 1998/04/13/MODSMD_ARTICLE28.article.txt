■ Saturday: No. 6 Stanford d. IJ(
Santa Cruz 15-0,15-2,14-16,15-8

The sixth-ranked Cardinal (15-7,
14-6 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) played its final regular-season
match in Saturday's 15-0, 15-2, 14-
16, 15-8 win over UC-Santa Cruz.
The match was the final regular sea
son appearance for Cardinal seniors
Tad Hoffman, Tyler Neal, Devin
Poolman and Keenan Whitehurst.
The Cardinal's postseason play
now rests on the result of tomor
row's match between No. 7 Long
Beach State and No. 14 I JSC. If
Long Beach defeats USC, Stanford
will play at third-ranked Pepperdine

on Saturday, but if the Trojans beat
the 49ers, then the Cardinal will host
fifth-ranked Brigham Young.
As can be seen by the game
scores, the Cardinal showed two
very different faces in Saturday's
match. Stanford starters played the
first two games of the match and did
not allow the Banana Slugs to score
until 12-0 in the second game.
"It's hard to keep focused in a
game like this," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves, "and our
starters did a nice job of that."
The 15-0 score of the first game of
the match marked the second time
this season that the Cardinal held an
opponent scoreless throughout a
game.
Freshman setter Josh Lukens
took to the service line at the start of
the match and did not leave until
Stanford had scored six points.
Lukens then served Stanford to its
first five points in the second game.
As a team, Stanford had just one
hitting error in the first game and
four in the second.

The Cardinal held the Banana
Slugs to poor hitting percentages in
both the first and second games,
minus-,316 and minus-.211, respec
tively. Just three Banana Slugs fin
ished the match with hitting percent
ages above zero.
"This match showed that we can
come out and play with anyone and
not sink to their level." Lukens said.
"I think we stayed focused" in the
first two games of the match.
The final two games were much
closer after the entrance of Stanford
reserves. The Cardinal utilized all
but two members of its lineup during
the match.
"In games three and four, we had
some guys who didn't play the way
they can play — the way we need
and want them to play," Nieves said.
"So it turned into a struggle."
