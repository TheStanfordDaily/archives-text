break on her home course and fin

well both days," Homever said. "It
was just one of those tournaments
where nothing seemed to go exactly
right. Whether I was plugged in a
bunker or three-putting a couple of
times. I just didn 't get many breaks —
and my scores reflected that."

ing on its home course. man> of the
players felt that it was harder to pre
pare and focus for this tournament.
"It is hard to get into the tourna
ment miKle when you are staying in
your dorm room." Keever said. "It is
difficult to go to sleep in the dorms
and have to wake up at 5:30 and be
ready to play for real."

home. Homever agreed. "We had
just come off a big win. and we were
