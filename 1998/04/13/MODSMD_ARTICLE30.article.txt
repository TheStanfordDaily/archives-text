## No. 1 women slip past Sun Devils and Wildcats 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team took two
steps toward yet another Pacific
10 Conference title this weekend
with two road victories at No. S
Arizona State and No. 23 Ari
zona.
The Cardinal (22-1, 7-1 Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division)
extended its dual-match winning
streak to four as the team held on
to beat the Sun Devils 5-4 on Fri
day and ran over the Wildcats 7-2
on Saturday.

"Overall I think it was a good
weekend from the team stand
point," said sophomore Teryn
Ashley, who won two of her four
matches this weekend.

WOMEN'S TENNIS

■ Saturday: Stanford 7. No. 23 Ari
zona 2.

Stanford ran out to a huge 5-1
lead in singles against ASU.
putting the match out of reach for
the upstart Sun Devils (12-6, 4-5).

Arizona State made the final score
close by sweeping all three dou
bles matches at the Whiteman
Tennis Center.
"After winning five out of six in
singles, it was hard to motivate for
doubles," Ashley said. "But we
weren't too concerned about it."
Stanford's singles success al
lowed for the Cardinal's noncha
lance in doubles. Four of the Car
dinal's five wins were of the
straight-set variety.
In the No. I match, sophomore
Anne kremer got the best of Ari
zona State's Reka Cseresnves in a
6-2, 6-4 victory. Ashley followed
suit in the No. 3 match, defeating
Alison Nash 7-5, 6-0.
Stanford recorded two more
straight-set triumphs in the bot
tom of the lineup. Freshman
Sarah Pestieau earned a Cardinal
victory in the No. 5 match by beat
ing Kerry Giordano 6-3, 7-5. In a
similar match on the No. 6 court,
sophomore Jennifer Heiser got
the best of Celena McCoury 6-2,
7-5.
In the No. 4 match, senior Ania
Bleszynski won a three-set match
over Katy Propstra 4-6,6-4,6-2.
The Sun Devils' lone singles
victory came in the No. 2 match,
in which Karim Plame defeated
Stanford senior Julie Scott 6-2, 0-
6, 6-4.
But ASU stormed back to
make it a one-match margin by
sweeping Stanford in doubles
play. For the second time this sea
son, Propstra and Stephanie
Lansdorp defeated Kremer and
Ashley in the No. 1 doubles match
8-1.
In the No. 2 match, Bleszynski
and Scott fell to Nash and Mc-
Coury by an 8-4 count, and ASU

completed the sweep with an 8-3
win by Cseresnves and Plame in
the No. 3 match.
While the match was already
clinched by the time doubles com
menced, the three losses contin
ued a trend of poor doubles play,
which prompted head coach
Frank Brennan to suggest after
last week's win over California
that a lineup change might be in
order. But Brennan stayed with
the same teams and the same line
up.
"I think it was more of a
threat," Ashley said. "He wanted
us to think about it and scare us
into playing better."
While the Cardinal teams still
struggled against ASU, they came
to play against the Wildcats (10-8,
2-7). All three doubles tandems
earned victories in the 7-2 victory,
two of them even after the match
was secured for the Cardinal at
the LaNelle Robson Tennis Cen
ter.
Kremer and Ashley downed
Arizona's Vicky Maes and Joan
na Buczowska in the top match 8-
4. Bleszynski and Scott bounced
back to beat Monica Allegre and
Betsy Miringoff 8-3. In the No. 3
match, Heiser and Pestieau also
earned an 8-5 win over Michelle
Gough and Vanessa Abel.
"I think we all played really

good doubles against Arizona,"
Ashley said. "We used that ASU
sweep to make us play better."
In singles, the Cardinal took
four of six from the Wildcats. Kre
mer notched her second victory of
the season over former Pac-10
Player of the Year Vicky Maes 6-
2, 7-6.
Stanford also got straight-set
wins from Bleszynski and Heiser.
Bleszynski broke open a tight
match and cruised to a 6-4,6-0 win
over Gough. Heiser did the same
as she finished strong against
Abel in a 7-6, 6-1 triumph.
Stanford's final singles point
came from Sarah Pestieau in the
No. 5 match, as she outlasted Buc
zowska 6-3, 5-7, 6-1.
Arizona kept it close by win
ning the No. 2 and No. 3 singles
matches. Miringoff punished
Scott 6-1,6-0, and Allegre handed
Ashley a 6-4, 7-6 defeat.
Stanford now has just two dual
matches remaining before the
postseason begins, including a
huge rematch with UCLA, the
only team to defeat the Cardinal
this season.
