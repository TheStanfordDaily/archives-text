BASEBALL
■ Friday: California 4. No. 1 Stanford 3
■ Saturday: Stanford 7. ( alifornia 3
■ I odav: Stanford (29-h-l.13-4 Pac-10) at California (14
22.2-17). 2:30p.m. RADIO: KZSl (90.1 FM).

On the mound, junior C had Hutchinson (7-2
was had news for the Bears. Throwing a one-hitte
through eight innings. Hutchinson made up fo
Stanford's 4-3 upset loss to the struggling Bears thi
previous day.
"I try not to lose to Cal." said the two-sport star
"We came out ready to plav today I knew I had t(
come out with a good pitching performance
Thankfully. I had enough command of my pitche
to have a good game."
Throwing eight strikeouts. Hutchinson kept tht
Bears scoreless until midwa\ through the ninth in
mng.
"He got tired in the end." said Stanford heac
coach Mark Marquess. "But he pitched a heck of ;i
game for us. 1 thought he had command of all of bis
pitches. He's tough to hit."
Although the Bears struggled w ith their offense,
Stanford swung its bats with ease. While Ciall and
sophomore left fielder Edmund Muth were both 2
for 5 at the plate, freshman outfielder Joe Borchard
went 4 for 5 on the day with an RBI double in the
Cardinal's fifth-inning rally. After scoring five runv
on five hits in the inning, there was no looking back
for Stanford.
Streak\ hitting "comes and goes." Marquess
said, i look for the pitching and m\ defense. Then
you can win the game even it you don't get a lot of
hits."
With Hutchinson on the mound. Marquess got
all of his wishes.
"He's the type of guy that I wish could have
pitched for the IS A team last year." said Califor
nia head coach Bob Milano, who served as the skip
per of the national team over last summer. "There
is a tremendous amount of respect out there for
him."
On Friday, however. Sunken Diamond did not
pro\ ide the Cardinal with the same jov as E\ans did
a day later. Losing a 4-3 battle to its cross-town ri
vals. Stanford gave the Bears onlv their second con
ference victory of the season.
"They just played better than us." Marquess
said. "I don't think it was a case of overlooking
them We just didn't swing the bats well. We knew
that they were capable, but we just got beat "
With Jeff Austin — Collegiate Baseball's nation
al player of the week — on the mound for the Car
dinal. Stanford felt it was in good hands. Austin (9-
1) pitched yet another complete game, with a sea
son-high 11 strikeouts, but still fell short in his quest
for his 10th victory of the year.
"I think he pitched well, but they did a good job
of hitting him." Marquess said. "He gave us a
chance to win but we didn't net enough runners in."
The main reason Stanford was
sluggish at the plate was Califor
nia's freshman pitcher, Jason
Dennis (5-2). Pitching his first
complete game ever, Dennis con
trolled the Cardinal.
"it was just overwhelming." he
said. "1 was so excited. [Sunken
Diamond] is a beautiful place and
has more crowds than I've seen in
a while."
Stanford scored its three runs
on an RBI single hv junior third
baseman Josh Hochgesang in the
third inning and a pair of RBI
shots to the outfield corners by
Muth and junior catcher John
Salter in the sixth inning.
Tied up at three in the ninth in
ning. sophomore outfielder Cur
tis Johnson slapped an RBI single

to right field with two men on
board for California to give the
Bears the 4-3 lead and eventual
victory.
"The main thing (on my mind)
was just putting the ball in play,"
Johnson said. "This will give us a
boost of confidence. We know
that we are a lot better team than
our record indicates."
Dennis retired Stanford in
three batters in the bottom of the
inning, giving California the
much-celebrated win.
The series concludes today at
2:30 p.m. as the Cardinal travels
back to Berkeley to make up for
the rained-out game last Thurs
day.
Junior Brent Hoard (2-2) will
likely get the nod for Stanford
and face Cal's Ryan Atkinson (1-
4). While Hoard has struggled
with a 6.10 ERA, Atkinson's
ERA stands at a lofty 10.45.

With Hutchinson on the mound. Marquess got
all of his wishes.
"He's the type of guy that I wish could have
pitched for the IS A team last year." said Califor
nia head coach Bob Milano, who served as the skip
per of the national team over last summer. "There
is a tremendous amount of respect out there for
him."
On Friday, however. Sunken Diamond did not
pro\ ide the Cardinal with the same jov as E\ans did
a day later. Losing a 4-3 battle to its cross-town ri
vals. Stanford gave the Bears onlv their second con
ference victory of the season.
"They just played better than us." Marquess
said. "I don't think it was a case of overlooking
them We just didn't swing the bats well. We knew
that they were capable, but we just got beat "
With Jeff Austin — Collegiate Baseball's nation
al player of the week — on the mound for the Car
dinal. Stanford felt it was in good hands. Austin (9-
1) pitched yet another complete game, with a sea
son-high 11 strikeouts, but still fell short in his quest
for his 10th victory of the year.
"I think he pitched well, but they did a good job
of hitting him." Marquess said. "He gave us a
chance to win but we didn't net enough runners in."
The main reason Stanford was
sluggish at the plate was Califor
nia's freshman pitcher, Jason
Dennis (5-2). Pitching his first
complete game ever, Dennis con
trolled the Cardinal.
"it was just overwhelming." he
said. "1 was so excited. [Sunken
Diamond] is a beautiful place and
has more crowds than I've seen in
a while."
Stanford scored its three runs
on an RBI single hv junior third
baseman Josh Hochgesang in the
third inning and a pair of RBI
shots to the outfield corners by
Muth and junior catcher John
Salter in the sixth inning.
Tied up at three in the ninth in
ning. sophomore outfielder Cur
tis Johnson slapped an RBI single

to right field with two men on
board for California to give the
Bears the 4-3 lead and eventual
victory.
"The main thing (on my mind)
was just putting the ball in play,"
Johnson said. "This will give us a
boost of confidence. We know
that we are a lot better team than
our record indicates."
Dennis retired Stanford in
three batters in the bottom of the
inning, giving California the
much-celebrated win.
The series concludes today at
2:30 p.m. as the Cardinal travels
back to Berkeley to make up for
the rained-out game last Thurs
day.
Junior Brent Hoard (2-2) will
likely get the nod for Stanford
and face Cal's Ryan Atkinson (1-
4). While Hoard has struggled
with a 6.10 ERA, Atkinson's
ERA stands at a lofty 10.45.
