al player of the week — on the mound for the Car
dinal. Stanford felt it was in good hands. Austin (9-
1) pitched yet another complete game, with a sea
son-high 11 strikeouts, but still fell short in his quest

of hitting him." Marquess said. "He gave us a
chance to win but we didn't net enough runners in."
