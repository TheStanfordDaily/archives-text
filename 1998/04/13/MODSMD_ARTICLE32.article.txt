MEN'S TENNIS

■ Saturday: Stanford 7. Arizona 0

Stanford beat both the Arizona
schools earlier this season down in
Arizona, but home-court advan
tage for the Sun Devils (8-10) and

the Wildcats (6-10) did not help
them, either.
At Stanford's Taube Family
Tennis Stadium on Friday, the Car
dinal took on the Sun Devils. Stan
ford dropped only one set in the en
tire match.
With Stanford's flexible-top
lineup, head coach Dick Gould
again had room to switch players
around to give them playing time at
the top positions. With four players
having played at the No. 1 position.
