Several diverse music traditions
converged Saturday night in World-
Jam. a concert to combat North Ko
rean hunger.
The concert included perfor
mances from Talisman a cappella,
Stanford Taiko, Stanford American
Indian Organization Drums, Mari
achi Cardenal de Stanford, in addi
tion to organizers Stanford
Hwimori, a Korean American drum
group.
"We have come together to edu
cate the public about the North Ko
rean famine this year," said Robert
Lucero, president of Mariachi —
which delivered a particularly en

gaging set.
"We were so excited," said
sophomore Jane Park of last night's
performance. "( The groups] all vol
unteered to perform for free."
In addition to musical perfor
mances, the event included a short
documentary hosted by Bryant
Gumbel about the famine in North
Korea.
I'he documentary said that as
many as one in five North Koreans
were suffering from hunger. The
documentary was immediately fol
lowed by a passionate rendition of
"Amazing Grace" by Talisman.
"A lot of people were touched by
the sequence," commented sopho
more Minhee Cho, a member of
Hwimori.

The concert closed with a fusion
piece, called "Bayetou," in which all
five groups performed at once.
Hwimori, which means "two
beat," held a spring concert last year
also advancing the issue of hunger in
North Korea. This year, they decid
ed to involve other groups.
"We've been working on this for
a while," said Cho, who had joined as
a freshman.
Over $1(XH) was raised through
donations at Saturday's concert. The
money will be distributed through
American Friends Service Commit
tee.
"We trust the program," said
Park, who has family in North
Korea. "They are a Nobel Prize-win
ning organization with monitoring."

Through other events, Hwimori
has raised over $3(XX) this year. They
plan a major fund raiser on April 24-
25. On these dates, an international
fast will be held.
At Stanford, a few dollars will be
refunded by University Dining Ser
viees for each skipped meal, which
will then be donated by the dorms to
the Korea Relief Fund.
Hwimori's efforts are taking
place in concert with groups nation
wide, including other college cam
puses, including Harvard University
and Massachusetts Institute ol Tech
nology.
At Stanford, a "wide variety of
students" have expressed interest,
according to Park, and many attend
Hwimori's meetings.
