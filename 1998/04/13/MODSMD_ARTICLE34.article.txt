has suffered some tough losses to

Canadian opponents, rival Califor
nia and, most recently, the Pacific Is
lander teams in Fiji. The victory
over the Beavers has reasserted the
Cardinal's winning tradition.

fied for the regionals. which will be
held in Houston next weekend. 1 he
team leaves Friday and will take on
Virginia Tech on Saturday after
