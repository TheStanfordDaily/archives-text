# Mixed picture on faculty pay
## Stanford salaries among nation's highest, but so is cost of living 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
Stanford remains the second
highest-salaried school of its kind in
the nation for full professors, ac
cording to a survey carried out by
the American Association of Uni
versity Professors that was pub
lished in the Chronicle of Higher
Education.
Although salaries are high, the
high cost of living, particularly hous
ing in the area around campus, still
tends to diminish Stanford's finan
cial attractiveness for potential fac
ulty.
According to the association's
survey, Stanford's average salary for
a full professor — outside of the
School of Medicine — is $111.000,
with associate professors averaging
$75,300 and assistant professors
$60,100.
Harvard University has the high
est average for full professors
among doctoral institutions that
also grant four-year degrees:
$ 116.8(H).
Stanford's average salaary in
creased 4.3 percent from last year,
which is consistent with the survey's
national increase of 4.2 percent
among comparable institutions.
Robert Weisberg. the vice
provost for faculty relations, noted
that this increase is substantially
above the rate of inflation, and esti
mated that salaries have been rising
somewhat above inflation for sever
al vears.

Haverford College Assoc. Eco
nomics Prof. Linda Bell, who wrote
the report for the association of
which the survey was a part, was
quoted in the Chronicle of Higher
Education saying, " The 1997-9K in
crease does not bring us back to the
real salary levels that existed before
the substantial decline in real facul
ty salaries in the 19705."
As Weisberg noted, however, in
flation was extremely high during
the 19705, lowering the real value of
salaries in the entire work force so
that wages in general "don't look
that good in real terms" over the last
20 to 30 years.
Base salary rates for all ranks of
faculty are set by the provost. But
individual schools, which each ha\e
their own pay scales, make recom
mendations as to what their scalc
should be. Weisberg said tin
provost tends to substantialh follov
those recommendations.
According to Weisberg. annua
increases in salaries are also deter
mined by the provost, who in th<
course of making the l.'niversit;
budget with the University Fresi
dent and the Board of Trustees, set
a "ballpark rate" for an average in
crease.
This is then distributed to indi
vidual schools in proportion to then
overall salary pool.
The schools then, in consultation
with departments, apportion raises
to individual professors based on
merit considerations. Weisberg said
that "the assumption is that we're
trying to move faculty salaries up" in
real terms.
He added that competition for
salaries with other institutions did
not affect year-bv-year decisions al
though different schools at different
times may find that they need to
make increasing salaries a fund-rais
ing goal for competitive reasons.
Weisberg pointed to the Law School

as the most recent example of such a
move.
However. Weisberg added, high
salary rates do not make teaching at
Stanford a financially attractive
proposition as compared to compa
rable institutions.
"It is really rough to buy a house
around here," Weisberg noted,
adding that "people don't come here
because they want to get rich."
"They come here because they
want to teach at Stanford." Salaries
and benefits simply served to offset
the basically high cost of living in this
area, he said.
