In the 11th inning, Cal catcher
Meguni Takasaki doubled home
third baseman Tricia Hunt to put
the Bears ahead 2-1. Then Iancin
singled to bring in Takasaki,
putting the Bears ahead 3-1.
Stanford rallied in the bottom
of the inning, scoring on an error
and loading the bases before
Floyd, a two-time Ail-American,
recorded the final out.
Floyd allowed only five hits
and struck out four while walking
one in 11 innings of work for the
Bears. Stanford junior Marcy
Crouch (8-5) got the loss despite
allowing only one earned run.
"We didn't take advantage of
the opportunities that we were
given," junior shortstop Michelle
Schneider said. "In the second
game, we pulled off the victory
even though we had five errors.

We didn't play our style; we
weren't swinging the bat aggres
sively. Basically, our pitchers
saved us by pitching extremely
well."
In the second game, Stanford
was able to battle through adver
sity. In the bottom of the 10th, ju
nior right fielder Michelle Acosta
singled in junior second baseman
Jennie Foyle to break a 2-2 tie. Ju
nior Becky Blevins (17-4) threw
another outstanding complete
game, allowing two hits and no
earned runs while striking out 11
for the Card.
Acosta led the Card at the
plate on the day with a 4-for-9 per
formance. Freshman first base
man Jenny Shideler contributed
two hits, one run and two RBIs for
the Card.
Stanford hosts San Jose State
(16-21) today at 2 p.m. at the Stan
ford Softball Complex. The Spar
tans have struggled to a 4-12
record in the Western Athletic
Conference.
"We split with them last year,"
Schneider said. "They are certain
ly not going to give up. They will
attempt anything it takes to win —
playing scrappy, bunting to move
runners, taking advantage of any
opportunity we given them."
Stanford split with San Jose
last year. Lindsey Lewis leads the
Spartans with a .301 average. Jen
nifer Ellinger provides the power,
with four home runs and 17 RBIs.
On the mound. Niki Senger (9-
7) has led the way with a 2.37
ERA, and Sabrina Quintero (2-4,
4.11) and Corina Lilly (4-8, 4.32)
fill out the rotation.
