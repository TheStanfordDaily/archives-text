# Candidate field full for ASSU president
## 
### James Pritchard Staff writer 
Students will
face a difficult choice
on Wednesday and
Thursday in voting
for next year's ASSU
president and vice

president.
The presidential race features five
strong candidates, each with focused
platforms. However, each ticket brings
with it a different level of experience

and energy.
Matt Crystal, one of the two sopho
more candidates for president, has em
phasized the strength of having little ex
perience in the student government.
However, knowledge of ASSU logistics
and politics could make a significant im
pact on the implementation of candi
dates' platform goals.
Junior Maren Norton, her running
mate Santos Marroquin and sophomore
Matt Spence are all current ASSI' sena
tors. It is a rare senate bill that is not
sponsored by at least one of these three.

Spence serves as the ASSU senate
deputy chair. He has been one of the
central organizers of such projects as the
ASSU Course Guide and the freshman
senator program.
Norton currently chairs both the
Budget and Finance Committee and the
Appropriations Committee, two major
decision-making groups of the senate.
Marroquin chairs the Student Affairs
Committee.
As to familiarity with the entire Uni
versity — both its administration and
students — the five tickets come from

various perspectives.
The experience of juniors Mike Mar
tinez and Matt Louie lies in class go\-
ernment. The two make up half of this
year's junior class presidency Martinez
also served as one of the sophomore
class presidents last year. Martinez and
Louie have also been active in Greek
life at Stanford.
Junior Lisa Liao has likely developed
a thorough knowledge of the Universit}
throueh her position as the ASSI Nom-

inations Commission chair, whose
function is to appoint students to a
wide range of University commit
tees. Her running mate, junior
Loren Demeroutis, is also a resi
dent assistant in Burbank.
Spence's running mate, junior
Bianca Ling, chairs the Asian
American Student Association.
Beyond their experience in
ASSIJ affairs. Norton serves as the
Athletic Department event manag
er, while her running mate Marro

quin is the co-editor of the Stanford
Chaparral and has been a major or
ganizer of the campus protests
against the recent housing deci
sions made by the Office of Resi
dential Education.
Crystal and his running mate
sophomore Johnathan Lotz do not
share significant campus leader
ship experience, but they see this as
no disadvantage, billing them
selves as average students with av
erage students' perspectives.
Yet again, it could be the ideas
and not the experience which will
make the difference.
Both Liao and Norton are fo

cused on the reorganization of the
ASSU Senate through assigning
senators to residentially based dis
tricts. Martinez seeks to improve
ASSU accountability by making
himself and Louie more accessible
to the student body.
Three platforms address gradu
ate student issues at length. Mar
tinez wants to hold ASSU graduate
student mixers while Norton and
Liao look to tackle concrete prob
lems with a Graduate Student
Housing Network and appoint
ment of graduate students to exec
utive committees, respectively.
Although there is a surprising

consistency between the five plat
forms, there are some unique ideas.
Crystal and Lot/, emphasize ex
panding the use of Frost Am
phitheater and reforming financial
aid by setting out to make the loan
disbursement process fully elec
tronic.
Norton and Marroquin want to
expand Marguerite service while
Spence and Ling suggest creating a
World Wide Web site to notify stu
dents of campus events.
Both the Martinez and the Crys
tal tickets are interested in increas
ing the flexibility of Dining Ser
vices for undergraduates.
