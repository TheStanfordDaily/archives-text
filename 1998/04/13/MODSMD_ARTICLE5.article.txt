Students will
face a difficult choice
on Wednesday and
Thursday in voting
for next year's ASSU
president and vice

Spence serves as the ASSU senate

ASSU Course Guide and the freshman
senator program.
Norton currently chairs both the
Budget and Finance Committee and the
Appropriations Committee, two major
decision-making groups of the senate.
Marroquin chairs the Student Affairs
Committee.

year's junior class presidency Martinez
also served as one of the sophomore
class presidents last year. Martinez and
Louie have also been active in Greek
life at Stanford.
Junior Lisa Liao has likely developed
a thorough knowledge of the Universit}
throueh her position as the ASSI Nom-
