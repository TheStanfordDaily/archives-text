These kind of cartoons "desensi
tize kids to violence and tell them it's
OK to be violent. They are then
more likelv to find violence in the

real world acceptable," said fresh
man Victoria Porto.
The vast majority of Stanford
watchers feel the opposite, however.
Kown said, "It's a parent's re
sponsibility to monitor their kids
viewing if they really find it all that
offensive."

Other students just don't find the
show all that humorous and prefer
the style of other popular adult-ori
ented cartoons.
It's "not as nearly as inspired as
'The Simpson's." (It) only really
works off a couple of levels while
'The Simpson's' has many." Porto

said. "Overall. ' The Simpson's' is so
much better."
For the fans, "South Park" is sim
ply a fun show to watch when relax
ing after a hard day of classes.
"It's worth missing a house meet
ing to watch a funny episode of South
Park." said freshman Matt ()glander.
