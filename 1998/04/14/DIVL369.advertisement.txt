Analog Design Engineers
If you are graduating with an B!j/MS/PhD EE with very strong
analog design skills, these positions will provide the opportunity to learn
advanced IC design while developing systems engineering skills. Design
Engineers will have the chance to work in advanced BiCMOS/CMOS
process technologies. You will also design and develop analog and mixed
signal ICs, including chip definition, circuit design, simulation, layout
supervision, debugf characterization and release to production.
Test Development Engineers
[tydu are graduating with a BS/MS FF, enjoy working on analog and
mixed-signal circuits, and have computer programming skills, our Test
Development Engineering opportunities may be your ticket. You will use
your understanding of analog and digital circuits to design hardware and
software that performs complex electrical screening of our mixed-signal
ICs on automatic test equipment. You will insure this testing correlates to
laboratory benchmarks. You will work closely with our IC Design, Product
and Applications Engineers to define and implement a test program th.it
guarantees parametric and functional operation of the IC.
Product Engineers
If you are graduating with a BS/MS FE and have a preference for analo;
and mixed-signal c ircuits, our Product Engineering positions may
be of interest to you. Strong analog skills are integral, as you will evaluate,
characterize and introduce new products to manufacturing. You will also
be responsible for analyzing, enhancing and forecasting Wafer Sort and
Final Test yields and supporting production to resolve product issues.
