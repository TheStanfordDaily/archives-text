# Fines assessed for violations
## 
### Adam Kemezis Senior staff writer 
A lull field of candidates and

competitive races has led to ag
gressive campaigning in this year's ASSII election.
This in turn has met with aggressive enforcement of
election rules and a series of fines for violations of
poster and flier rules.
Over the weekend, the hearings committee in
charge of dealing with all violations heard 15 cases. 14
ol which resulted in fines and one ol which resulted in
a censure, a sanction less severe than a fine.
All live presidential tickets were fined, as were four
senatorial candidates, three senior class presidential
slates and two sophomore class presidential slates. All
fines were set at $25. except for the X ( ite slate for se
nior class president and the presidential ticket ol Vlatt
Spence and Bianca Ling, which both incurred $50
fines.

included putting fliers in dormito
ries and areas of dormitories
where posting was not permitted;
posting fliers in the Main Quad,
which is entirely off limits; and
placing fliers over other candi
dates' fliers.
Lee said he had neither seen
any instances of presidential tick
ets placing their fliers over those
those of their opponents nor sena
torial candidates placing fliers over
their opponents', which he saw as a
"mitigating factor."
The fines were levied by a hear
ings committee — of which Lee is
not a part — chaired by senior
Solomon Lefler. Lee's job consists
of investigating the violations, but
he has no role in assessing punish
ment.
Lee toured dormitories to
check whether candidates were
complying with the rules. "I think
in years past, the elections process
has been very lax" about the flier
rules, Lee said, adding that he had
taken special efforts this year that
resulted in more cases for the hear
ings committee.
When he found serious viola
tions. Lee said, all material of the
candidate or slate in question was
removed from the dormitory
where the violation took place.
Lefler said he supported the $50
fine against Spence and Ling not
because they had done anything
qualitatively worse than other

slates but because the violations
occurred in about 13 separate sites,
which he said was "not comparable
with [the frequency of] the other
candidates or slates."
X-Cite, he said, had differed
qualitatively from the rest in that
they had put up fliers in the Quad,
which he said demonstrated "a
greater degree of carelessness,"
given how explicitly the rules for
bid posting material there.
Erica Straus, a member of the
X-Cite slate, stressed that "what
ever happened, it wasn't us pur
posely breaking the rules," noting
that her slate would jeopardize its
position by doing so. According to
Straus and Mina Bak, also a mem
ber of X-Cite, they posted fliers in
the Quad after seeing other elec
tion fliers there, without realizing
the area was off limits.
Bak speculated that the candi
dates who posted the other fliers
removed theirs after all candidates
were warned that there would be a
"sweep" to see whether any mate-,
rial was posted there.
Bak said X-Cite didn't remove
theirs because they didn't realize it
was against the rules.
In addition to the four other
presidential slates, senior class
presidential slates Construction
Ahead and Swingers, sophomore
class presidential slates Euphoria
and The 2001 Crew, and senatorial
candidates Luke Avila, Clara
Chan, Mike Levin and Adam
Weiss were each fined $25. Senato
rial candidate Daniel Maeng was
censured.
