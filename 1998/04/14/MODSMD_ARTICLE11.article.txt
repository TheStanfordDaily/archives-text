Bank mergers keep feds on their toes
WASHING lON (AP) — Can federal regulators keep up with the rolling waves of
huge bank mergers? While the megamergers push the United States toward the sort of
national bank systems that exist abroad, bank regulation in America remains scattered
— sometimes competitively — among different agencies.
I he fragmentation has some lawmakers and consumer activists wondering whether
the government can adequately scrutinize and regulate the new megabank combina
tions that could affect thousands of consumers across the country.
That criticism was renewed yesterday after Nationsßank Corp. and Bank America
Corp. announced a $62.5 billion marriage to create a coast-to-coast banking giant, and
Bank One Corp. and first Chicago NBI) Corp. said they will unite in a $2K.9 billion
deal to form the dominant bank in the Midwest.
"I have real concerns. We are moving in the direction of fewer and fewer, and larg
er and larger megabanks." said Rep. Bernard Sanders til Vermont. Congress' lone
independent and a member of the House Banking Committee.
While Congress wrestles with legislation to revamp the Depression-era laws that
prohibit banks from getting into the brokerage or insurance businesses, some law
makers have contemplated proposals that would restrict future bank mergers.
"We have seen a real epidemic of mergers." said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. "I'm
skeptical about the public interest being served."
