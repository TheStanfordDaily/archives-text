# Russia sold missile parts to Iraq
## Soviet firm smuggled gyroscopes three years ago 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” In a glaring
example of lax export controls, a
Russian firm sold 8(X) hi-tech missile
gyroscopes to Iraq in 1995. a Rus
sian think-tank charged yesterday.
The tale of the smuggled gyro
scopes first came to light after U.N.
weapons inspectors received a tip
and fished 10 of the gyroscopes out
of the Tigris River near the Iraqi
capital Baghdad in 1995.
The gyroscopes were delivered
in violation of U.N. sanctions in
place against Iraq. I he PI R-C enter
for Policy Studies said yesterdav
that the overall shipment was much
larger than previously reported.
The Russian government investi
gated the sales but closed the case
and has never prosecuted anyone at
the military plant that allegedly sold
the sophisticated devices to a Pales
tinian middleman, said Vladimir
Orlov. head of the independent
research institution. He said a loose
ly worded Russian law has made it
difficult to bring charges.
"The Russian Criminal Code
doesn't work because ... Russian
lawmakers and the government

tailed to notice its serious flaws."
Orlov told a news conference.
A section of Russian criminal lavs
dealing with export controls hars
only the sale of weapons tit mass
destruction. It does nut specificallv
prohibit the transfer, however, of
kev missile components, such .is the
gyroscopes, which are used to guide
missiles to their targets.
After the gyroscope deal was
first reported more than two \ cars
ago. Russia denied involvement,
pointing its finger at other former
Soviet republics. Several months
later. Moscow acknowledged that
the equipment came from Russia,
but said the gyroscopes were
exported without government per
mission
A shipment ot gyroscopes was
intercepted b\ Jordanian authorities
in the fall of 1W?. But previous
reports put the number at 115. while
the think tank said the actual num
ber exceeded <S(X)
The gyroscopes came from the
Research and Testing Institute of
Chemical and Building Machines, a
defense plant in Sergivev Posad, a

town near Moscow. The plant is
involved in the dismantling long
range strategic missiles, the center
said.
Struggling to survive amid Rus
ski's prolonged economic slump, the
firm agreed to a proposal from
Palestinian Weaam (iharbiyeh. who
wanted to bu> the gyroscopes left
over from Russia \ dismantled mis
siles. the center's report said
The gyroscopes were part of the
guidance systems for the RSM-50
submarine-launched intercontinen
tal ballistic missiles with a range of
5.1 *X> miles. The missiles were dis
mantled under the START-1 arms
reduction tre.it> between the I nit
ed States and Russia.
Gharbiyeh initiallv procured a
batch of 10 samples, which were
ultimatelv found in the Tigris River,
the report said.
He then received the main ship
ment of SOO gyroscopes, dubbed
"micromotors" in official docu
ments that passed through Russian
customs at Moscow 's Sheremetyevo
airport and on to Jordan, the report
added.
