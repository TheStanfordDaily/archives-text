In field of five strong
presidential tickets,
Spence slate is strongest

MATTSPENCE and Bianca
Ling boast the strongest
ticket of the five presented.
They balance three critical elements:
experience dealing with University
administration, knowledge of ASSU
operations and a viable plan to
achieve feasible goals.
As a senator. Spence has invaluable
experience working with the adminis
tration in a student government
capacity. Working with the Faculty
Senate, Spence finally brought a long
time ASSU dream of a course guide
to fruition. Spence recognizes the
improvements that must be made in
this project. He also recognizes that
the next president needs to make the
course guide a priority in order to
improve it and institutionalize it as a
staple publication.
Spence also knows ASSU protocol
and bureaucracy better than any of his
opponents. His knowledge of the
ASSU spans beyond his personal
years of service. This sense of history
lends itself to his clarity of vision for
the presidential office and its role in
the University.
As chair of the Asian American
Student Association, Ling brings
strong coalition-building experience
to the ticket. She adds a human touch
to Spence's "consummate politician"
polish. As leader of one of the most
streamlined, well-run umbrella orga
nizations on campus. Ling has the
approachability to be sensitive to stu
dents and the charisma to rally them
when necessary.

Spence and Ling have made a bold
promise to resign if their six stated
goals are not met by the time Spence
delivers the State of the Association
address in February. This has forced
them to set reasonable goals. Having
an ASSU Town Hall dinner every
quarter, issuing an improved course
guide and extending Tresidder Union
hours are goals that are more feasible
than proposals to overhaul monoliths
such as Housing and Dining Services
or the ASSU Senate.
But the voting population should
not take Spence's promises at face
value. Spence could try to escape his
own promise when it comes time for
the student body to issue him a pink
slip. If he neglects to clearly establish
the criteria by which he is to be judged
before he begins his term, then the
promise is an empty one.
Spence presents an impeccable
platform to the student body. This is
unquestionably a product of his polit
ical personality. But in order for him
to be as successful in working with stu
dents as he has been in working with
the administration, he must soften the
political lingo and be honest with his
constituency. The biggest challenge
the Spence administration will face is
the need to effectively reach out to
students. This is a concern that stu
dents must consider before they cast
their votes tomorrow and Thursday.
Nevertheless, Spence's ticket fea
tures a wealth of experience with the
administration, the ASSU and student
groups. The Spence I Ling ticket
boasts feasible goals and the follow
through necessary to achieve them.
Spence and Ling — as a team — have
the experience, the leadership and the
vision to effectively lead Stanford's
student body through the 1998-99
school year.
