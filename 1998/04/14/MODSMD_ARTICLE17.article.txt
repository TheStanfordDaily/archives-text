There are other ways to
gain leadership skills
In light of yesterday's Daily article, we
want to respond to what we felt was an
inaccurate representation of us.
The writer wrote that "Crystal and Lot/,
do not share significant campus leadership
experience."
'['his. however, is not true.
While we have never served in the
ASSU. students should keep in mind that
the ASStJ is not the only place in which to
gain leadership experience.
Matt has been Otero dorm president
and is currently Kappa Alpha vice presi
dent and Rush chair.
Jonathan was Roble dorm president
last year and currently sits on Mirrielces

dorm government and the Stanford Judi
cial Panel.
In all of these positions, both of us have
gained connections to the administration
that current ASSU officers are expected
to have.
We are disturbed by the fact that The
Daily's articles and biases help to ensure
that the same people will serve in the
ASSU each year.
While we believe all of this year's can
didates are qualified, we would like to
remind voters that many of our opponents
currently serve in an ASSU which has
been heavily criticized for its inaction.
This is why we believe that our status as
"outsiders" is a positive thing.
We think the ASSU and student poli
tics as a whole need some new faces and
fresh perspectives.
This is what we will bring to the ASSU.

along with leadership experience and an
honest, realistic platform.

Bike campaign begins
Two years ago an information and edu
cation campaign called "Clear Access"
began.
A joint effort of Stanford's disabled
access advocates Bicycle Program and the
Public Safety department, "Clear Access"
encourages courteous bicycle parking at
building entrances.
Because the Stanford community
responded favorably, the stairs at History
Corner, Meyer Library and several other
important locations are much less fre
quently obstructed by parked bikes.

Today the Bicycle Program launches
"Bike Smart," a new campaign focused on
bicycle-driving behavior.
"Bike Smart's" illustrated messages
will run Tuesdays and Thursdays for the
next four weeks. See today's introductory
message on page two.
When operating a bicycle, each of us
has the same rights and responsibilities as
when driving a car.
Think about the Bike Smart principles
when you're biking and walking around
campus.
This helps make Stanford a safer and
saner place to travel.
If you have comments or suggestions,
feel free to contact me at bikes@forsythe
or 725-BIKE.
