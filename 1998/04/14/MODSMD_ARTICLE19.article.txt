## Answer my questions, Res Ed 
### 
Residential
education has
been taking some
heat recently. They've
ticked off graduate stu
dents, fifth years, students
with disabilities and the
entire residence popula
tions of both Alpha Sig

and Kimball. When talking to a friend about
this article, she summed up the situation say
ing. "Res Ed? You could be all controversial
and write about how much you like it."
I think Res Ed has been given a bad
name. I sincerely doubt that Assoc. Res Ed
Director Ann Porteus and Asst. Director of
the Office of Student Activities Heather
Dunn have put their heads together in order
to squelch student communities that don't
meet the Res Ed stamp of approval.
First, it is easy to confuse the organization
of resident fellows and resident assistants we
know and love with those responsible for the
recent changes in the University's housing
policy. Student debate has vilified "Residen
tial Education" unthinkingly, failing to dis
tinguish between its positive and negative
aspects.
Not that it is a simple task to figure out
exactly who is responsible for what's going
on these days. The most reprehensible action
that members of the administration have
taken is their refusal to respond to student
concerns. Everyone who seems to be in the
know is conveniently unavailable for com

ment. Half of the time, the administrators in
question have been in St. Louis or San Anto
nio watching the basketball team. This
silence translates into disinterest in student
opinion. When someone does take responsi
bility for the changes, these are the questions
I want answered:
1) Why Alpha Sig and Kimball? Admit
tedly. nobody wants changes to take place in
his or her backyard. In petitions to the Uni
versity and on residence evaluations, we
have asked for housed sororities and more
all-freshman residences. Something has to
give in order to make both of those things
possible.
However, what rationale was used to
make these choices? All I have heard is
hearsay — Alpha Sig parties too hard and
Kimball is merely a bone to throw to discon
solate upperclassmen in the Draw. Surely
you have a better justification, right?
2) What do you plan to do with these new
all-sophomore and upperclass communities
you've created? As near as I can tell, Toyon
is projected to behave like one big sopho
more seminar, with major panels in the eat
ing clubs (if they are permitted to continue
operating) every other week. How will you
keep 250 sophomores from slumping at the
same time? I doubt the freshman class is
excited about an Undergraduate Advising
Center theme dorm.
Similarly, what are the "unique" needs
that distinguish upperclassmen so dramati
cally from freshmen and sophomores that it

was deemed necessary to turn Manzanita
Park into another Sterile Quad? Perhaps
freshmen might distract us from our theses
and our Career Planning and Placement
Center job fairs; a strange assumption con
sidering your own critique of our generation
as too "pragmatic" and not interested in a
complete education.
3) Why all the secrecy? By remaining
silent through most of the protest, we have
been left 110 choice but to suspect the worst.
Replace student conjecture with a well-rea
soned overview of how these changes will
inform an overhaul of residential life on cam
pus. Justify the creation of freshman and
upperclass dorm clusters — residences that
appear as nothing more than campus ghet
toes where classmates are forced to live with
one another. Why are student-operated resi
dences being given the squeeze? Provide us
with some answers.
The solution is simple. The mystery deci
sion-maker needs to document the rationale
for making these changes and explain how
they fit into a larger plan for campus life.
Then make those principles liable to discus
sion and give students their say.
Maybe these changes will be a shot of
adrenaline in the arm of Res Ed. reinvigorat
ing the ways in which students interact with
each other. That is, after all. the goal of Res
Ed in the first place.
