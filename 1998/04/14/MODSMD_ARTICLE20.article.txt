# ENDORSEMENTS
## Special-fee requests 
### 
To make informed special-fee endorse
ments, members of The Daily's editorial
board spent more than 30 hours over the
past two weeks talking with the fee-seeking
groups and reviewing the budget and Elec
tions Handbook statement each group sub
mitted to the ASSU. Whenever possible, the
editorial board met with representatives of
each group and asked tliem questions
about the group's goals, its accomplish
ments and failures during the past year, its
plan of action for the upcoming year, and
how the requested special-fee budget
reflects lessons learned this year.
Based on the written information and
the interview discussions, the board
reached a unanimous decision on each
group. The board has attempted to include
as much information as possible on each
group in the endorsement explanations.
Still, The Daily encourages all students to
obtain a copy of the Elections Handbook
and read each group's budget and hand
book statement for themselves.
IN AN EFFORT to hold special-fee
groups more accountable to the stu
dent body. The Daily Editorial Board
modified its special-fee endorsement sys
tem this year.
As noted in the evaluation criteria edi
torial on March 31. The Daily has rated all
returning fee groups on a 1 to 5 scale based
on the group's effectiveness.
The new fee group, the Undergraduate
Weenie Roast, has been rated on a 1 to 5
scale for both value and effectiveness.
In evaluating the groups, the editorial
hoard closely examined the achievements
of fee groups during the past year and the
viability of the group's plans for the
upcoming year.
Below is an explanation of the 1 to 5
"effectiveness" rating scale that was used.
5 Group has fulfilled all goals set out
during the previous year. Has a strong
sense of its constituency and an overarch
ing vision for the organization. Has a
viable plan of activities for the coming
vear. and has clear goals to improve upon

itself.
4 — Group has fulfilled most goals set dur
ing the previous year and knows who it is
serving. Plan for the upcoming year is
viable and includes effort to fulfill unmet
goals.
3 — Group has fulfilled only some of the
previous year's goals. However, plan for
the upcoming year reflects effort to fulfill
unmet goals and achieve significant
improvement.
2 — Group has met few of the previous
year's goals. Plan for the upcoming year
does not clearly reflect effort to fulfill
unmet goals or does not seem viable. Has
cloudy sense of long-term vision for pro
grams.
I — Group has met no goals and has no
sense of constituency or direction.
Groups received the rating that most
accurately corresponded with the organi
zation's effectiveness.
The aim of the summaries below is to
convey the highs and lows of the fee
groups this past year and the group's plans
for the coming year.
The annual cost per student is indicated
in parentheses under the group's gross fee
request amount. The per capita amounts
are taken directly from the Elections
Handbook. A "B" prior to the amount
indicates the fee will be assessed to both
undergraduate and graduate students; a
*U<)' indicates the fee will be assessed to
undergraduates only.
The Daily welcomes responses to its
endorsements from groups or students;
letters will be published tomorrow or
Thursday on a space-available basis.
Please submit letters as early as possi
ble. Only those received by 3 p.m. today
will be considered for publication tomor
row. Letters for Thursday publication
must be received by 3 p.m. tomorrow.
Please submit letters via e-mail addressed
to letters@dailv.stanford.edu

Alternative $17,089.00
Spring Break (UO $2.63)
© © © © ©
Each year, the Alternative Spring
Break Service/Learning Projects expose
more than 130 Stanford students to a
wide range of social and environmental
issues through an intensive week of ser
vice and learning. ASB hopes to trans
form student concern into a long-term
commitment to public service.
This year, Alternative Spring Break
added more curriculum-based learning
to its service program, which earned it the
Curriculum Based Alternative Break of
the Year award. With special fees, orga
nizers hope to include more students by
making the trips more affordable and also
expand the number of spaces available
by including an 11th trip.
Currently, each participant pays $60 (a
$20 increase from last year's price) and
works Stanford Fund shifts to raise
money for speaker fees, transportation,
housing and food.
Asian American $27,871.00
Student Association (UO $4.29)
® © © © ©
Over 30 different student groups are
funded under the umbrella of the Asian
American Student Association. Dedicat
ed to promoting social, cultural and polit
ical awareness of the Asian American
community, AASA effectively reaches
large segments of the Stanford commu
nity.
AASA made some efforts at cost con
trol, for instance, by relying on free e-mail
publicity when appropriate. This year
Stanford Asian Women redefined its
direction, and the Queer and Asian group
has been added under AASA's special
fee. We hope AASA will continue to work
closely with the diverse student groups
under its umbrella to take advantage of
fund raising and other revenue sources
to keep its special fee requests from ris
ing.
ASSU Legal $91,487.00
Counseling Office (B $6.78)
© © © © ©
ASSU Legal Counseling offers free,
confidential legal advice to all students
and their spouses. This helps many stu

dents in times of legal need, especially in
civil cases. The budget for Legal Coun
seling mostly covers fees for a San Jose
based law firm, the salary for the office
coordinator and updating the legal mate
rials available for students. The law firm
charges ASSU Legal Counseling a
reduced fee for its services. The only
major increase in the budget this year
comes about due to a new postal code.
Hence, the need to print new stationery.
Legal Counseling operates as effi
ciently as a self-service legal group could,
providing expert advice without the high
overhead of a costly legal firm.
ASSU Speakers $120,616.00
Bureau (B $8.94)
© © © O ©
This year, the Speakers Bureau
brought Ralph Reed, Michael Moore and
Scott Adams to campus. It also co-spon
sored speakers with MEChA such as
Arturo Rodriguez and will co-sponsor
Gloria Steinem with the Women's Coali
tion. These speakers fulfilled the group's
goal of bringing timely and diverse
speakers to campus.
However, the group suffered from not
having a speaker series in place before
the school year began. This hindered the
group's ability to secure as many engag
ing speakers as it might have. The group
plans to rectify that by having an on-site
director planning next year's program
ming this summer. This should produce a
more thematic-based Speakers program
next year.
Barrio $23,464.00
Assistance (U053.61)
© © © © ©
Barrio Assistance, a tutoring program
serving approximately 70 East Palo Alto
and East Menlo Park students from the
first through eighth grade, directly
addresses the high dropout rate within
the Chicano/Latino community. It also
provides Stanford students an opportuni
ty to volunteer and act as role models.
This year a new academic and social
issues program called Barrio Assistance
Bridge has been added. The program
serves seventh and eighth grade stu
dents and helps ease the rough transi
tions into the teenage years This year's
special fee increase will be applied to the

cost of BA Bridge, food, literature, sup
plies and field trips for the children.
Black $22,454.00
Student Union (UO $3.46)
® © © ® ©
This past year, the Black Student
Union has organized many programs that
have attracted large numbers of students.
Additionally, it has created more targeted
programs that have served cultural, polit
ical and social needs of black students at
Stanford. BSU members have continued
to work in the surrounding communities
by mentoring minority high school stu
dents and promoting academic excel
lence.
This year the BSU is asking for a slight
ly higher special fee in order to fund more
programs. Some of its goals for the
upcoming year are to increase its fund
raising to make up for its expanding bud
get, to work on outreach to the communi
ty, to increase publicity for its events and
build alliances with BSUs at surrounding
universities. The BSU has a strong sense
of its constituency, has fulfilled many of its
goals and has a viable plan of activities for
the coming year.
Club Sports $155,067.00
(B $11.49)
® © © ® ©
Traditionally one of the most popular
special-fee groups, Club Sports serves
nearly 1,000 Stanford students. The
group has fulfilled its goals for the past
year by providing funding to 16 different
non-varsity athletic teams including the
ice hockey, rugby and ultimate frisbee
teams.
This year's special fee increase reflects
the rise in essential costs, such as renting
facilities for teams. The special fee is sup
plementary to mandatory dues paid by
participants to their team. Club Sports
has shown remarkable discipline and
organization in supervising its budget.
Communication between individual
teams and the umbrella organization has
created a budget that is specific and
pragmatic.
International $9,415.00
Undergraduate (U051.45)
Community
® © © 0 ©
This group tries to create a home away
from home for about 400 international
students by providing parties, dinners, a
sib program and a fall orientation guide.
The workshops and programs organized
by the lUC are open to all Stanford stu
dents. Some of last year's programs,
such as the sib program, suffered from
inefficient organization. But the group has
plans for improvement. Next year orga
nizers will start working on the sib pro
gram earlier in the year to make sure it
runs smoothly.
lUC is asking for an increase in funds
to provide more food at its programs and
better quality programming. lUC spreads
itself over many diverse activities. The
group's organizers should demonstrate a
concerted effort to decrease the cost of
existing programs before asking to
increase its special fee.
KZSU $48,443.00
(B 3.59)
® © © ® ©
KZSU, Stanford's only radio station,
effectively provides several services to the
community. Not only does it provide
extensive coverage of Stanford athletics
events, but KZSU also offers a unique
learning opportunity for students interest
ed in broadcasting.
Two years ago, KZSU lost its special
fee request and seriously re-evaluated
operations. Last year, KZSU increased
programming and expanded its format to
allow for varied tastes of its listeners and
DJs alike. KZSU developed a new under
writing department focused on collecting
revenues from outside the University,
which has allowed KZSU to completely
fund its sports department without using
student money.
KZSU also serves as the University's
emergency broadcasting system.
Masque $15,259.00
(UO $2.35)
® © © ® ©
Masque, a journal of queer art and lit
erary expression, is now in its second
year of publication and has been pro
duced with a professional quality largely
absent in other campus publications
Published quarterly, the journal has been
distributed beyond the Stanford campus
and has made visible efforts to bridge the
gap between gay and heterosexual com
munities, one of its stated goals.
Although it relies heavily upon special
fee funding to operate, outside revenues
are difficult to raise because of the per
ception by advertisers that the journal
reaches a narrow audience. Furthermore,
most other campus funding sources
have maximum limits and do not cover
the costs needed to produce a high-qual

ity journal every quarter
—Mayqu« hupes tu reach a laryur audi
ence in the coming year. Despite its lack
of substantial outside revenues, the jour
nal has met its stated goais and has a
clear sense of direction for the upcoming
year.
MEChA $29,366.00
(UO $4.52)
(D © © 0 ©
MEChA is an umbrella group whose
organizations celebrate Chicano and Lati
no culture and try to effect positive
change in the Chicano / Latino communi
ty. This year MEChA organized events
like the Raza Day Conference, during
which 300 high school students came to
Stanford, and a Cesar Chavez Commem
oration at which Arturo Rodriguez spoke
MEChA has added two new groups
under its umbrella. Unidas promotes Lati
na pre-professional development and
Familia is a gay and lesbian Latino group.
This is why the special-fee request
increased. While MEChA groups fulfill
their goals, it is unclear whether MEChA
supervises the budgets of each individual
group. We suggest MEChA make an
effort to increase oversight of its umbrella
organizations and their budgets.
The Mind's Eye $13,392.00
(UO $2.06)
® © © © ©
A popular journal of expression, the
Mind's Eye has recently raised its budget
to allow increased publishing and circula
tion. The increases have also allowed
enabled the publication to print some art
work and photographs in color. This past
year's expanded production has allowed
the journal to meet rising student demand
and to put on new programs such as the
"Mind's Eye Night" at the Coffee House.
The journal is dependent on the special
fee, but outside revenues are difficult to
generate because it is published only
twice yearly. Furthermore, the English
and art departments have been unable to
provide substantial funding, although
they support the journal. So far the journal
has been effective given its limited finan
cial means.
Project Motivation $8,126.00
(UO $1.25)
(D © © 0 ©
Project Motivation, which tries to steer
underprivileged youth toward higher edu
cation, exposes more than 1.000 high
school students each year to realities of
college life. In sponsoring workshops on
the college admissions process, financial
aid, and self-esteem, Pro Mo helps to
eliminate misconceptions about the col
lege experience.
Pro Mo has been effective in streamlin
ing its budget and cooperating with the
Office of Undergraduate Admissions and
Admit Weekend. However, we are con
cerned that the current core group of at
least 20 members may be too small to
ensure the program's long-term viability,
especially considering the large con
stituency the program serves. We agree
with the leaders of Pro Mo that higher
membership should be an important goal
for next year and hope they will accom
plish the task successfully
SCBN $21,209.00
(B $1.62)
® © © ® ©
Last year, SCBN said Give us a
chance, and we'll come through." It
received its funding and has provided a
welcome return on the investment SCBN
spent the year developing a quality stu
dent-run television studio. SCBN has fol
lowed through on its goals by providing
original content, better infrastructure and
expanded coverage of events SCBN is
currently developing a news department
and now has 24-hour programming. The
ever-popular TELEFLICKS has been
expanded
SCBN is asking for only half of last
year's budget. Yet it plans to expand the
TELEFLICKS offerings, remedy the stu
dio's wiring, enhance equipment and
remove aesbestos from the carpeting in
its home, the Toyon Eating Clubs SCBN
will use its special fee effectively to devel
op a true broadcast studio
Stanford American $29,929.00
Indian Organization (UO $4.61)
® © :s O
SAIO does a good job as an umbrella
organization with a diverse population of
Native American student groups The
group's annua! event, the Stanford Pow
wow, is the main focus of the organiza
tion. The SAIO request also provides
funding for various smaller organizations
to enhance the life of Native students on
campus. The group has been influential
in introducing courses on Native Ameri
can and Native Hawaiian culture into the
Stanford curriculum
The largest expenditure of the SAIO
budget is for the Powwow. This is a

$100,000 event for which students
donate approximately $8,000 for speak
er honoraria. SAIO should consider
reducing its fee request for the next year
by absorbing the honoraria request for
the Stanford Powwow
Stanford Axe $10,982.00
Committee (U051.99)
i ® © ® (D
The Axe Committee is devoted to pro
moting school spirit at Stanford Its con
tributions include the annual Big Game
Rally, a handbook on Stanford traditions
for freshmen and an annual Frisbee Golf
tournament It is also charged with pro
tecting the Axe itself when it resides at
Stanford..
We agree with the Axe Committee
that finding an alternative site for the Big
Game bonfire and exploring new tradi
tions should be a major goal for next
year However these tasks are complex;
and the Axe Committee's plans for
accomplishing them next year are not
concrete enough to persuade us of their
effectiveness. We hope the group can
complete its negotiations with the Uni
versity as soon as possible and suc
cessfully revive Stanford's glorious Big
Game traditions.
Stanford Band $60,013
(LSJUMB) (UO $9 23)
12 3 4 ©
The notorious Leland Stanford Junior
(pause) University Marching Band aims
to entertain, promote school spirit, teach
all interested students and support Stan
ford athletic programs. Student involve
ment in the Band has grown consistent
ly over the past four years. In its stated
goals for next year, the Band hopes to
stretch its special-fee budget to meet its
increased size, organize a Band reunion
during Homecoming weekend, produce
a new compilation album and hold a
high school band day
Stanford Chapparal $16,842.00
(UO $2.59)
1 2 3 4 ©
A University institution since 1899.
The Stanford Chapparal has already
published four issues this year, as many
as they published for the entire 1996-97
year. The organization is on track to
meet its goal of publishing six issues. It
has also increased recruiting efforts,
upgraded necessary equipment and
minimized its special-fee request by rais
ing money through the Stanford Fund.
If more advertising revenues can be
obtained in the upcoming year, the orga
nization can continue to make laughs
less expensive for Stanford students.
The group has shown impressive
improvement and a direction for the
upcoming year that hopes to build on
this momentum.
Stanford $6,506.00
Community (UOSI.OO)
Carnival
1 2 3 4 ©
Each year the Stanford Community
Carnival puts together a free day of fun
and games for local elementary school
children. The Carnival works hard to
stretch its special-fee dollars by fund
raising and soliciting donations from
vendors This year, for example, drinks
were donated by Trader Joe sand bus
transportation was free The entertain
ment is provided by Stanford students,
from the dorm members who staff the
game booths to student teams and
groups who perform for the kids
Community Carnival does a good job
of spending money only when neces
sary They are conscious of the need to
make the Carnival attractive for kids
while utilizing community funding
sources and involving dorms who wish
to donate and volunteer at the carnival
booths
Stanford $63,557.00
Concert Network (B $4.71)
® 2 © © ®
The Stanford Concert Network aims to
bring quality contemporary musical acts
to the Stanford campus at reduced tick
et prices The organization also provides
free shows in White Plaza and the Coffee
House and works with other student
organizations in planning and co-spon
soring musical events
This year the group has encountered
problems in tour routing and securing
access to venues due to lack of long
term planning While we realize the diffi
culty in booking gigs far in advance, the
group to date has only brought one
major musical act, the Violent Femmes,
to campus.
The special fees increase will allow
the concert network to attract high-qual
ity acts, provide more free musical
events, and continue working with more
campus organizations. Next year the
organization aims to have at least one

show in Frost Amphitheatre, two in
Memorial Auditorium and three in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium. The group is also plan
ning at least one more concert for this
spring.
Stanford Film $31,542
Society (UO $4.85)
(D © © 0 ©
The Film Society exposes the Stan
ford community to independent, unre
leased films and shorts that students
might not otherwise see. The group has
experienced increased attendance, but
still falls short in meeting its attendance
goals. Last quarter, an estimated 700
people attended Film Society events, but
an increase is likely since the group
plans to improve publicity.
The group has made commendable
efforts to work with other student organi
zations, such as KZSU, in hosting
events. Students can look forward to
much of the same in the future.
Stanford in $24,206.00
Government (UO $3.72)
(D © ® ® ©
Stanford in Government provides
resources and services to students inter
ested in public policy and to the campus
as a whole.
SIG continues to expand its internship
offerings while funding fellowship
stipends from outside sources. In fact,
only a quarter of its total budget comes
from the special-fee request, which has
fallen by more than $2,000 from last
year. Most of SlG's special fee will go
toward the organization's operating
costs.
Stanford Jazz $19,320.00
Orchestra (UO $2.97)
©©© 0 ©
The Jazz Orchestra consists of two
components — jazz education perfor
mances by top artists and a collection of
Big Band-style student ensembles. The
group this year increased the number of
guest performances and replaced old

equipment in accordance with last year's
goals. However, the group has had prob
lems with unnecessary line items in its
budget and its advertising efforts. In the
upcoming year the group hopes to offer
free concerts to students and record a
CD. The group could improve its function
by working more closely with the concert
network to bring guest artists to campus,
and by making greater attempts to
increase student attendance at events.
Stanford Project $4,851.00
on Nutrition (UO $.75)
© © © © ©
SPOON tries to alleviate hunger in
communities around Stanford by collect
ing leftover food from dorms and dis
tributing it to local food shelters. SPOON
has been operating for 10 years, and it
has effectively fulfilled its stated mission.
The group is making an effort to share its
experience with other schools through
attending conferences and helping East
Coast schools start similar programs.
The group is not asking for an increase
in funds this year. This spring, SPOON
will also use its special fee to have a
Hunger Awareness Week at Stanford.
SPOON utilizes its resources well and
has concrete plans to increase its visibil
ity and effectiveness.
Stanford Solar $31,769.00
Car Project (UO $4.89)
© © © © ©
Students involved in the Stanford
Solar Car Project participate in several
collegiate and international races, suc
cessfully competing against better-fund
ed opponents. Unfortunately, the organi
zation currently draws such a small num
ber of committed Stanford participants
that we have grave doubts about its
future viability.
Largely due to low membership and a
change in leadership, the project has not
been able to use its funding for the pre
sent year. Next year's funding would be
more productively spent recruiting mem
bers, making long-term plans and solicit
ing donations. However, we are uncer
tain whether even these modest goals

could bo accomplished. The Solar Car
team is valuable to the Stanford commu
nity, but the student body should not be
asked to fund it until a strong group of
core members is in place to ensure the
organization's goals can be met effec
tively.
Stanford $27,252.00
Women's Coalition (UO $4.19)
® (D © © ©
The Stanford Women's Coalition is an
umbrella organization providing funds to
almost 20 women's groups. It also offers
supplementary programming through
programs such as Men in Solidarity.
Womenspeak (an art/literary journal
for women) has been added to the coali
tion's special-fee budget for next year,
accounting formost of the Coalition's
increased request. The coalition raised
significant outside funds this year and
plans to add more fund raising activities
to compensate for its increased budget.
Other goals are to work more closely
with the ethnic centers and organize
more events for both men and women.
The coalition has clearly met many of its
goals this past year and plans to surpass
its current efforts next year.
Students for $7,865.00
Environmental (U051.21)
Action at Stanford
®®® ® ©
This grass-roots organization aims to
educate the Stanford student body on
environmental and social justice issues.
This year, SEAS has chosen to address
local environmental issues. The group's
actions have been brought closer to
home and is working on building coali
tions both on and off campus. Special
fees will allow the group to bring in
experts to speak about issues of concern
and to publish the Daily Planet, a one
page bathroom stall newsletter address
ing the current SEAS campaign or other
environmental issues relevant to the
community.
Undergraduate $7,770.00
Weenie Roast (U051.20)

Effectiveness Rating:
®©® ® ©
Value Rating:
® © (D ® ®
The Undergraduate Weenie Roast is a
new group formed solely to organize a
party on the night before Big Game. The
Roast's organizers will provide live
music, drinks and EANABS to achieve
their stated goal of increasing school
spirit before Big Game. We agree that
current Axe Committee festivities, like the
bonfire, are not as effective as they could
be in mobilizing school spirit. We also
believe that if students vote to give the
Roast the requested special fee, the
organizers could stage a successful
giant party.
However, the Roast's value does not
justify asking for student's special-fee
money. Other campus organizations like
Axe Committee are working toward the
same goal as the Roast. Perhaps the
organizers should work with the Axe
Committee to get such an event planned.
There are also alternative routes for fund
ing, such as the Program Board and the
Dean of Students office, which the
Roast's organizers have yet to explore.
While those groups would not pay for
alcohol or food, they might assist with
other expenses so students wouldn't
have to pay for the entire cost through
special fee.
General Fees
Program Board: No increase
Publications Board: 10 percent
increase
Although the number of publications on
campus is constantly multiplying, the
Publication Board's general fee has not
had an increase in over a decade.
Community Service Board: 10 percent
increase
Many groups fall under the umbrella of
the Community Service Board. With the
extra funding, they could provide more
substantial services that benefit both the
Stanford community and surrounding
towns.
