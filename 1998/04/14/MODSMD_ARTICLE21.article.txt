Above the visitor's dugout on
the left side of Evans Diamond, the
daily construetion eontinued on
California's adjacent Harmon
Gym. Yet amid the customary clut
ter of the architectural makeover,
many workers stood still. Posi
tioned in small groups, all eyes
were focused on the playing field
as No. 1 Stanford (30-6-1, 16-3 Pa
cific 10 Conference) defeated the
Bears 13-7 yesterday.
Cal (14-23-0. 2-1 S) is "very tal
ented. very capable, and they play
well against us," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess.

Nevertheless, the Cardinal took
charge in the second as 12 Stanford
hitters stepped to the plate, scoring
six runs off Cal freshman Ryan
Atkinson.

The Bear's top pitching recruit
has struggled this year with his
control. Yesterday was no excep
tion.
Atkinson's problems started
when lie gave up a line drive up the
middle to sophomore outfielder

Nick Day that scored senior short
stop Jay Pecci and commenced the
Cardinal scoring deluge in the sec
ond.
Atkinson followed up by launch
ing a string of halls and wild pitches
that scored sophomores Edmund
Muth and John Gall. Hut when he
had thrown three wild pitches and
hurled one straight into Cardinal
third baseman Josh Hochgesang,
Cal righthander Jon Cuccias took to
the mound in relief.
Cuccias didn't fare much better,
issueing two walks that scored ju
niors Jody Gerut and Hochgesang
before he could induce Day to fly
