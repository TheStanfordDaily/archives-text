California's adjacent Harmon

were focused on the playing field
as No. 1 Stanford (30-6-1, 16-3 Pa
cific 10 Conference) defeated the
Bears 13-7 yesterday.
Cal (14-23-0. 2-1 S) is "very tal

well against us," said Stanford

Nevertheless, the Cardinal took
charge in the second as 12 Stanford

The Bear's top pitching recruit
has struggled this year with his
control. Yesterday was no excep

Atkinson's problems started
when lie gave up a line drive up the
middle to sophomore outfielder

Cardinal scoring deluge in the sec

had thrown three wild pitches and
hurled one straight into Cardinal
third baseman Josh Hochgesang,
Cal righthander Jon Cuccias took to
the mound in relief.

to right and end the inning.
Despite the Cardinal's 7-0 lead,
the Bears fought back, tallying
three runs apiece in both the sec
ond and third innings.
Cal sophomore outfielder Cur
tis Johnson knocked off his first
homerun of the season to drive in
senior outfielder Aaron Gordnier
and freshman first baseman David
Stark in the second.
Stark and Johnson returned in
the bottom of the third to score off
a double by third baseman Mike
Tonis. Then Cardinal freshman
Justin Wayne stepped to the
mound in the bottom of the second
to replace junior Brent Hoard.
Wavne effectively eliminated the

Cal threat through the remainder
of the game.
"That long inning hurt" Hoard.
Marquess said. "The thing with
Wayne is that you're going to have
to beat Wayne. He's not going to
walk."
The Cardinal clung to its lead,
taking final control with a four-i in
sixth inning. Junior catcher Joint
Salter tallied his fourth homerun
on the season with a bomb over the
left field wall that drove in Pecci
Freshman outfielder Joe Bor
chard finalized the Cardinal lead
in the top of the seventh with a sin
gle that drove in Cierut.
Today the Cardinal challenges
Sacramento State at 6 p.m. at

not faced the Hornets this season,
but the Cardinal leads the series
10-8.
