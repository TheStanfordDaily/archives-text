Gardner and Estes set the pace for
the team, with three goals each.
Sophomore Elissa Keszlcr and
freshman Kcllv Shouey each con
tributed one goal.
In the final game of round-robin
play, Stanford defeated California
6-1. Once again. Gardner and
Estes led the attack with two goals
apiece. Keszlcr and freshman
Anne-Marie Keenan each scored
once. Cal's lone goal came in the
second quarter, from hole-set
Alisa vonHartizsch.
Crary had an exceptional game
in the cage recording 12 saves. The
win was Stanford's second against
the Bears, after falling to them

twice in the preseason.
"We played our best in the
game against Cal," Estes said. "A
lot of people really stepped up."

the top two teams in the country
against each other. Two-time de
fending national champion UCLA
got out to a 6-3 lead in the first half
of the game.

the leading scorer. Estes and ju
nior Nicole Glazer scored one
each.
"It took us a while to adjust to
their six-on-five offense," Estes
said. "But it was still a close game,
and I'm excited because I think we

can do even better. We have the
talent and the opportunity to win
nationals."
The loss to UCLA signified the
end of Stanford's 12-game winning
streak, but the close margin of the
final score bodes well for Stan
ford's chances at nationals. The
Western Regional qualifiers will
bring together the top teams in the
nation to determine which squads
will be traveling to the national
championship.
"This weekend we did really
well noticing what the other teams
gave to us," Estes said. "We've
been going along according to our
game plan. We need to keep pro
gressing and hopefully when it
counts we can pull it all together."
Stanford will host the Regional
tournament at deGuerre pool
April 24-26.
