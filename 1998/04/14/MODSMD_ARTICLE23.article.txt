## Regatta yields mixed results 
### Will Chang Contributing writer 
The UC-Davis Regatta Saturday featured a re
match between Da\ is and Stanford, two of the closest
competitors of the San Diego Crew ( lassie held April
4-5. Only four regattas into the season, the Card is al
ready looking to improve internal!) in preparation
for the Pacific 10 Conference Championship that will
determine which teams move on to nationals.
After poor results at the San Diego Crew Classic,
women's rowing coach Aimee Baker restructured her
entire varsity boat.
"Aimee realh switched around the lineup." said
sophomore Lauren Russell. "The seat positions were
changed with the same eight people to really maxi
mize our potential. After the San Diego Crew Classic,
this was realh turning a new leaf for us "
Led by its new stroker. senior Cecily Bostock. the
Stanford women's varsit\ eight boat blew awa\ San
Diego despite a slow start. The boat finished 14 sec
onds ahead of Davis with a final time of ft minutes. 43
seconds in the 2,000-meter race.
The women's junior \arsit\ eight boat expected a
close race from San Diego, and that's what it got. But
the Card managed to maintain a small lead all the w ay
to the finish and notched a final time of 6:58. 3 sec
onds ahead of San Diego's 7:01.
The most exciting race of the da\ came from the
women's novice eight boat. With 500 meters left in
the race and the Cardinal four
seats behind, the boat appeared to
be repeating its loss at the San
Diego Crew Classic a week ago.
Hut with the finish line closing
in.the novice eight boat managed
to burst out with a final reserve of
power to beat San Diego to the
finish by two seconds with a final
time of 7:(X).
"Unlike many of the other
boats such as Cal which has an en
tire boat with previous experi
ence. we are a true novice boat."
Baker said. "We expected a close
race, but I was confident that our
novices could win."
The Stanford men's team ran
two novice boats — one with four
rowers, the other with eight — but
garnered less success than the
women. The novice four boat's
7:34 finish was slow enough to be
beaten by both the Aggies' A and
B boats.
"There were many of us who
were injured on the novice four."
said junior Ralph Garvin. "Some

of us haven't rowed for over three
weeks."
The novice eight boat met with
a little more success, but still had
a troubling day After a slow start
which put the Card in third be
hind Davis's A and B boats, the
Cardinal managed to catch the B
boat in the final l.() 00 meters to
beat it by a boat length with a time
of 6:24. Unfortunately, the Card
was unable to close the gap to the
Davis A boat, which captured the
race by a boat length and a half.
"Overall, we raced well as a
team." said sophomore novice
captain Will Smith. "There are no
excuses. We needed more intensi
ty and focus. We had a terrible
start, but that is something we'll
work on."
The men's rowing team did
leave Davis with some redemp
tion. The men's varsity and junior
varsity teams blew the Aggies out
of the water with final times of
5:57 and 6:15 despite choppy
water conditions.
"This is the fastest and closest
team I've ever seen." said senior
captain Jamie MacQuarrie. "I
think this is our season."
