■ Today: No. 1 Stanford \s Boise
State at 1:30 p.m., Taubc Family
tennis Stadium

I .irlicr this \ ear. Stanford took
on Boise State.it the National
I'eam Indoor Championships in
kentuckx Stanford met the
Broncos in the first round ot com
petition at that tournament, win
ning even match to prevail with a
score of 7-0.
"There were several really
close matches, but we did end up
winning all of them." said head
coach Dick Gould.
Although the Broncos have
fared well lately with a 21-0
record. Boise State is not at top
form now. The team's top two
players, Daniel Merkert and
David Dalgaard. are both battling
injuries.

As of Frida\. Merkert was rest
ing a chronic knee injurs, and
Dalgaard was out with a back in
iur\
Ciould said Boise State would
ordinarily pose a challenge, but
with the Bronco lineup looking a
little shak\. he did not knovs what
to expect.
"They're ranked 13th. but
they've had some injuries, so 1
don't know how healthy they're
going to be." (iould said.
W hen Stanford met Boise
State in February, junior Ryan
Wolters struggled to win against
Tsolak Cievorkian. and freshman
Scott\ Scott fought for a three-set
win against Ryan Thompson.
However, that match was
played when Boise State had a
lull, healthy lineup and Stanford
was plaxing without sophomore
Mike Bryan because of chronic
tendonitis in his wrist
The Cardinal, on the other
hand, seems to be in good shape
going into today's mateh against
Boise State. Stanford will face a
team which, even if it does have a
full lineup, will probably not be
up to the task Having won 11M
out of 120 dual singles matches,
an incredible achievement in col
legiate tennis, Stanford's players
are coming off good wins this
weekend against Arizona and
Arizona State.
"We played very well this
weekend," Gould said. "This will
be a good tune-up for the matches
in Los Angeles this weekend."
Today's match will also mark
the last home competition for se
niors Paul Goldstein and Charles
Hoeveler.
"I think we're looking forward
to it." Gould said. "Everyone is
pretty healthy. We've won 119 out
of 120 matches, which is almost
unheard of hv any team. Hopeful
ly we can keep that going through
three more matches."
