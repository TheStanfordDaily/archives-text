WOMEN'S LACROSSE
■ Suturdav: Stanford 14. California
12.

"Stanford was the better team
out there today with this key win
over Cal," said head coach Heidi
Connor.
The win was very important for
the Cardinal as the league season is
finishing up. The playoff picture de
pends very much on the outcome of
the last few games of the league sea
son. and Stanford has a chance to se
cure the top seed.
The team is intent on proving that
it is indeed competitive against

tougher competition. The first step
in achieving this goal is to win the
league title. The next step is to carry
that win into the playoffs and the
Final Four.
Saturday's game against Cal was
a very good test of the team's com
mitment to winning the league title.
Cal would not let up and kept the
game close for the duration of the
match. It was only in the last six min
utes that the Cardinal was able to
pull away and secure the win.
"For the entire game, Stanford
and Cal were neck and neck, trading
the lead back and forth," Connor
said, 'it was the team with more de
termination and sheer hustle that
came out on top today."
Stanford was only up 7-6 after 30
minutes of play. The second half was
a seesaw affair with the lead chang
ing hands several times. With only 14
minutes left in the game, the score
was tied 12-12.
But the superior fitness, stick
skills and talent of the Stanford
squad proved to be too much for the

Bears to overcome. A pair of quick
goals with less than nine minutes left
in the game gave the lead to Stan
ford 14-12.
The Cardinal was able to hold
onto that lead and prevent Cal from
scoring by keeping the ball out of the
Bear's hands with good passing.
"We expected a close game." said
sophomore attacker Hedy Born.
"But we were confident that we
were the better team."
Absolutely essential to Stan
ford's win in Saturday's game was
the great week of practice that the
team had in preparation.
" These exact situations present
ed themselves Saturday, and Stan
ford was ready to handle it," Connor
said.
Connor said that the team had
worked repeatedly on the tactics of
making and breaking a stall, and it
proved to be a very key part of Sat
urday's game.
"The Cal game was the first game
where we showed how strong our
midfield can play — both on transi

tion and on defense." senior attack
er Dara Kaplan said.
Several players had key perfor
mances that led to the Stanford win.
Junior goalie Stephanie Tuerk had
20 saves for 32 shots on goal. The
scoring attack of the Cardinal was
led by Born with four goals and
three assists. Freshman center
Katharine Barnes was also instru
mental offensively with three goals
and one assist.
Kaplan was also fundamental in
Stanford's win. The senior, who al
ways has a strong game, was her po
tent self over the weekend, scoring
three goals.
"I am confident that we will be
back at home for the playoffs — we
can host the playoffs if we are first in
the league — so I didn't look at it as
the last time I would be playing for a
home crowd." Kaplan said.
Stanford's work is not over yet.
Next Saturday the team plays UC-
Davis, which is also very strong.
The Aggies will have home field ad
vantage.
