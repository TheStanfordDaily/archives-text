# Space access under review
## 
### Karin West Contributing writer 
Planning is under way to develop a new system that
w ill prov ide faster and more complete access to Univer
sity space and building information.
University departments are currently involved in a
needs assessment to determine how the old system,
known as Stanford University Facilities Engineering
Database, might be improved, according to Patrick
('icvelt of I aeilities Operations.
Ihe new s\siem called the Spatial Information
Management System â€” will centralize information
needed bv planners, facilities managers and emergency
response teams.
"It's a verv exciting project, and it needs a lot of care
ful planning." Crevelt said. "Right now we only have
funding for a planning phase."
.According to the project's World Wide Web site, the
original system was designed more than 12 years ago to
audit the amount of University space used for research.
I he government could then give funding for the amount
of research space used, Crevelt explained.
I lowever. the system can no longer meet the I Jniver
si t\ s needs for overall planning of space usage.
Seven I 'niversitv departments joined in funding the
analysis, including Housing and Dining Services. Envi
lonmcntal I lealth and Safety and Communications Ser-

vices.
PlanCiraphics Inc., the consultant for the planning
phase, will interview individual departments over the
next todays to determine what improvements are most
needed.
"We are meeting with critical users," said Chris
Christofferson. director of Facilities Operations. "We
need to know the functions of existing spaces [and] who
the occupants are."
Coordinators hope to create a database of buildings
and space that can be precisely searched and viewed,
Christofferson said.
Crevelt envisions the system as also providing track
ing information on building safety, such as locations of
all exit signs, fire extinguishers and fire hoses. Informa
tion on hazardous waste might also be available.
"We'd like to improve the diversity of space infor
mation available," Crevelt said. The new system should
provide space and building information in a more inte
grated way. possibly on a Web site, he added.
Although funding has only been allocated for the
planning stage of the project, the needs analysis will be
incorporated into a proposal.
The project will be presented to the Provost's Office
in July. Crevelt said, after which the University will de
termine additional funding. We are trying to employ an
enterprise-wide system." Crevelt said, "and that will re
quire a lot of work and planning."
