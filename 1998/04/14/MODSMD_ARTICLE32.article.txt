# Kennedy writes evolution guide
## 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
As president of Stanford, he
made a lot of changes at the universi
ty level. Now Donald Kennedy is
teaching change — evolutionary bi
ology — to elementary and high
school teachers.
1 leaded by Kennedy, a group of
National Academy of Sciences edu
cators and scientists published a
guidebook this month to help teach
ers explain evolution. The National
Academy of Sciences is printing
-4(1.000 copies of the guidebook,
Kennedy said.
Fvolution. according to Kennedy.
vv;is a great place to start what will
probably be a scries of teacher guide
hooks.
"You can't make any sense out of

biology without evolution — it's a
key concept," he said.
"Quite apart from controversy,
evolution is a difficult subject to
teach and teach well," he said. "Evo
lutionary thinking brings together a
number of different kinds of ideas
from a number of different areas."
The guidebook seeks to help
teachers better present evolutionary
information and better respond to
student questions. It even gives fre
quently asked questions and supplies
suggested answers.
According to Kennedy, the hand
book adds a new dimension to evolu
tionary material by focusing on ped
agogy. "Most textbooks give pretty
straightforward accounts of evolu
tion. but they don't help the teacher
teach the material most effectively."
he explained.

The guidebook encourages stu
dent engagement in the material.
"It's an ideal way to demonstrate to
students how scientific thinking pro
gresses," he said.
Kennedy hopes the handbook
will promote better science educa
tion for all students, not just future
scientists. Future policy making re
quires that the American citizenry
have a better understanding of scien
tific issues, he said.
"We think that science literacy in
America need to be improved."
Kennedy said.
Kennedy added that his experi
ence at Stanford was a great asset in
writing the guidebook.
"Teaching intro classes has gotten
me extremely interested in how you
teach most effectively." he said.
Kennedy has been both the chair

of the Biology Department and the
Program in Human Biology, which
he helped found. After taking this
year off. Kennedy plans to return to
teaching human biology next year.
From teaching. Kennedy said he
learned that "you don't teach well
just because you know a subject well.
You really have to learn how people
learn and how to intercept their style
of learning best."
Kennedy said he hopes the guide
book will instruct teachers how to
best intercept styles of learning.
"The idea is not to make any
money on the guidebook,"
Kennedy said. "It's to get the ideas
out there."
The guidebook can be down
loaded for free from the World Wide
