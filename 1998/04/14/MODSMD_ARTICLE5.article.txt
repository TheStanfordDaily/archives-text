# Files lost in GSB mishap
## 
### Kumar Narayanan Staff writer 
In a recent teehno-mishap. facul
ty members and doctoral candidates
at the (iraduate School o! Business
lost significant portions ol their
work when the school attempted to
upgrade two powerful computers to
a network system.
"This was a total disaster," said
Mike Spence. dean of the Business
School. "An\ time you lose ke\ data
files ... it qualifies as a disaster."
The problem occurred March 7
and K when two technicians turned
off the computers to move them to a
new location.
When the computers were
brought hack up. the servers didn't
recogni/e the contents of the origi
nal files. Spence said.
There was a partial backup of the
files made the day before the up
grade. and when this backup was
uploaded, it overwrote the original
contents, destroying some portions
of data.
Spence estimated that about 10
to 15 out of 2(H) students and profes
sors affected had not recovered
their work.
"It's probable that [people who
had lost work] will net most of their
stuff back because of the way acade
mics work." said Janet Zich. the as
sociate news director at the Busi
ness School. "It's like losing \our
credit cards but not losing the
money. It will still take an enormous

amount of work."
Most people "don't know what
they've lost: they can recover it from
co-authors or written files." Spence
added.
Kathleen Knopoff. a doctoral
candidate in business, said it will
take her a significant amount of
time to make up for the work lost
due to the computer problems.
"I lost data summaries that I had
done over the last two months.... I
probabh won't be able to get it
back." she said. "I have to redo all
the tables. I still have the raw data,
but I have to do all the regressions."
Knopoff . who has a job lined up.
will dela\ her starting date to finish
her research at Stanford.
I he situation was precipitated b\
a number of contributing factors, ac
cording to Spence. including the re
luctance of the system's users to
back up their material.
Another factor was the lack of a
concrete system administrator: ac
cording to Zich. the s\stem adminis
trator was on a six-week leave, and
the acting system administrator was
not present at the time the problem
occurred.
I o avoid such problems in the fu
ture. Spence said the Business
School will be moving its servers to
Stanford's central system.
rhe situation has generated sub
stantial interest in media as far
reaching as the Chronicle of Higher
Education and National Public
Radio.
