None of the Stanford students in
(Kford got to vote in the 1W" ASSI
Spring (ieneral Election. due toptxir
communication regarding a field trip.
Stanford in Oxford had ;i field trip
this \ ear also, but the Elections ( orn
mission knew in advance. Running
the election was a relative!) simple
task. said Flections Commissioner
Dan Perkel. a sophomore.
"Last year's problems definitely
weighed heavil\ in m\ mind." Perkel

said. "I think that
I've worked out
some of the
bugs."
Last year's
problems begin
when Flections
Commissioner
(iha/al Badio/a

mani did not find out that the Stan
ford in C )\tord students would be on
a field trip durine the eleetion until
the preceding Monday. Fo let stu
dents in Oxford vote earh was im
possihle because the ballot had not
been finali/ed: to let them \ote late
violated the ASSI Constitution,
which states that the election must be

held on no more than two consecutive
weekdays. Also, to allow voting after
the results from the main campus has
been announced would have been
detrimental to a fair election process.
The election last year ran on a
Wednesday and Thursday, and Ox
ford students returned from their field
trip on Friday.
Badiozamani elected not to allow
students in Oxford to vote. This im
mediately sparked a controversy
when it was discovered that winning
presidential candidates Emily An
drus and Ben Decker had won with
only 50.1 percent of the vote. Two
more opposing votes would have
forced a runoff. This quarter's Stan
ford in Oxford students left this morn
ing for their trip to Stratford-on-Avon
after casting their votes.
One student in Oxford, junior
Alex Sepiol, reported that everything
went normally. "There were signs
everywhere, and people were talking
about it."he said. He added that stu
dents there were not discussing last
year's follv at length.
