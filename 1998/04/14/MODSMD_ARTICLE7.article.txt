### Clara Kim Contributing writer 
Have you ever had a medical question you didn't
feel comfortable asking your doctor about? Try dialing
up "()n ( all." a weekly radio show on K/Sl hosted h\
the brother-sister team ol Andrew and Dr. Alexa
Boer.
Alexa and Andrew's relaxed, irreverent approach
to the medical talk show comes with a disclaimer that
emphasizes the entertainment value of the show, which
airs every Tuesday from 6-6:30 p.m.
" I he purpose of the show is to be both educational
and informative, but we try to do it in an entertaining
and funny way," said Alexa. who is currently the chic!
resident in dermatology at the Stanford Medical ( en
ter.
Alexa. is the self-described "bossy older sister,
while Andrew. 27.sa\s he is the " tain' in the 'edutain

ment' of it all."
1 he issues the show covers range
from mad cow disease to genital
piercing. Basically, the show ad
dresses general medical questions
and "whatever is on the callers'
minds." Andrew said. The audience
mainly consists of 20- to 35-vear
olds.
Andrew compared the show to
"I.ove 1 ine." ;i popular call-in radio
and television show that deals with
romance and relationships. In the
show, there is a medical authoritv as
well as a host, and callers ask for ad
vice about their personal lives.

Regarding his own show, An
drew said. "Unlike 'Love Line,'
you'll actually get through and you'll
get your questions answered."
"On Call" is expanding into the
cable television scene. Because of
the radio show's success. Alexa and
Andrew have begun airing a weekly
television show.
"We'll view clips ... and we'll
talk about those. It's more visual."
Andrew explained.
Their success has taught them a
lesson about how perseverance pays
off. According to Alexa. "If you
want to go out there and do some
thing. you can make it happen ..."
"... if you're terribly charismat
ic." Andrew finished.
While growing up. Alexa and

Andrew said they fought constantly.
"We used to get paid not to
fight." Andrew said.
They started getting along while
attending Princeton University to
gether. They parted ways when
Andrew went to law school and
Alexa went to medical school.
Alexa started up her own talk show
after relocating to California. In
1996, Andrew, who had been
working as an attorney, came out
west and joined his sister on the
show. They've been working to
gether ever since.
Due to his extremely short atten
tion span. Andrew promises to
change the subject before the audi
ence gets bored so that there is never
a dull moment.

According to Andrew, the goal
of the show is "to take over the
world and ruthless self-promotion."
Alexa added. "At some point
we'd like to take the show commer
cial."
For now. Alexa and Andrew are
satisfied with providing a safe place
where students and local residents
can anonymously ask questions and
receive candid answers.
"It's reassuring to find out others
have the same questions you have,"
Alexa said. "Radio is interesting be
cause people feel more comfortable
calling up the radio and asking the
questions than going into a doctor's
office."
" 'On Call' is the coolest thing we
do," Alexa and Andrew agreed.
