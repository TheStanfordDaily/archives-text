If all your customers loved you,
WARNING
all your competitors feared you,
and you're on a first-name basis with the CEO,
you'd be psyched to come to work, too.
Hey, it's fun to work for a winner. And that's exactly what People Soft is. Why? Because of our outstanding
product line? Partly. But success in this industry requires more than great products. It takes passion. Vision. The
courage to question. And most important, the ability to change. Our unique ability to respond to our customers'
needs has made us a consistent winner in the marketplace. And a great place to work. In fact, Fortune magazine
recently listed us #20 in"The 100 Best Companies To Work For In America." Which we're rather proud of. But
don't take our word for it. If you're studying MIS. Computer Science, or Industrial Engineering, come to
the career fair on Thursday, April 16th, and start getting psyched.
Job Connection Day
(hosted by the Career Planning and Placement Center)
