# Senate business postponed again
## Roll call 
### James Pritchard Staff writer 
On the first day of its spring gen
eral election, the ASSU Senate is
desperate for more members. Of
the nearly 30 senators, a total of only
13 were present for most of last
night's meeting.
The start of the meeting was de
layed 25 minutes — not an unusual
occurrence for the ASSU — until
enough senators were present to
make quorum. An hour into the
meeting, ASSU President Emily
Andrus and Vice President Ben
Decker counted heads to see il
there were enough present.
When Deputy Senate Chair
Matt Spence left the meeting due to
personal issues, the senate lost quo
rum. as only 12 senators remained.
The meeting quickly deteriorat
ed to a sort of controlled disorder.
All essence of parliamentary proce
dure crumbled as each senator vo
calized his or her suggestion of what
they could do next.
Although the senate can contin
ue to debate bills, it cannot call a
vote when it does not have quorum.
Andrus went to make phone calls in
a last-ditch effort to get more sena
tors to the meeting.
Ouorum was lost in the midst of
a debate on a senate reform bill that
aims to make senators more ac
countable to their constituencies.
C )ne senator commented on the ap
propriateness of the bill, referring to
the poor attendance.
Another senator suggested the
senate vote to expel absent mem
bers. However, the 12 remaining
grudgingly realized that they could
not vote to expel anyone without
quorum.
A second senate reform bill that
could not be voted on would have
placed an amendment on the ballot
for the expected runoff election be
tween the top two ASSU presiden
tial tickets. The bill is quickly run
ning out of time for a vote because
the ASSU Constitution states that
an amendment needs to be placed
on a ballot at least a week before the
election. II necessary, a runoff will take place in two
weeks.
Medical student Alane Murdock pleaded for a vote
on a bill that would give $1,000 to the Graduate Student
Housing Task Force before quorum was lost but failed in
her attempt. One senator leafed through the ASSIJ
Constitution to search for a loophole to pass the task
force bill, as Senate Chair Joe Freund suggested closing
the chaotic meeting to move business to a special meet
ing later in the week.
Some business was completed prior to losing quorum.
ASSI I Financial Manager Don Coleman reported that
the ASSU is under budget and over revenue for the year.
A bill intended to bring fairness to the allocation of

general fees to the graduate student body was passed.
The bill states that 20 percent of the ASSU general fees
will automatically be given to the Graduate Student
Council each year.
The council is a group of 11 elected graduate students
who work to address graduate student issues.
The added money request was intended to address
the lack of programming for graduate students while at
tempting to redress the disparity of funding between the
graduate and undergraduate student bodies.
"Very, very few graduate student groups come to the
Program Hoard and ask for money," said Maren Norton,
the Appropriations Committee chair. "And graduate
students contribute 53 percent of the general fees.... 1
feel we should accept this."
Alter 20 minutes of waiting for more senators to ar
rive and establish quorum, and the meeting was ad
journed.
