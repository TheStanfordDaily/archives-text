New endorsement system
rates effectiveness, not
value of special fee groups

AFrER FIELDING ongoing
complaints from a number
of special-fee groups over
the years. The Daily changed its spe
cial fee procedures this year in an
endeavor to make the process less
arbitrary and more friendly to student
groups.
The editorial board, in effect, has
significantly changed The Daily's role
in ASSU elections.
The board took the position that
each group that received a special fee
last year had made a contract with stu
dents to provide services or programs.
The job of the editorial board this
year was to assess how well each
group fulfilled its contract with stu
dents.
If a group did not fulfill its stated
goals, the board tried to determine
whether the group had developed a
viable plan for improvement for the
coming year. The board also exam
ined each group's future plans and
looked for a realistic plan of action.
Since students felt that the fee
group was valuable when they voted
for the group's special fee last year,
making a value judgment on returning
fee-groups would merely be antago
nistic.
However, for the one new group on
the ballot this year. The Daily made a
judgment about the "value" of a stu
dent contract with the group. The
Daily retains the right to make a value
judgment on new fee groups and any
fee group whose previous year's
request was denied.
By only gauging a returning group's

effectiveness, The Daily filters infor
mation for the voting population,
holding groups accountable for the
goals set in the previous year. Those
groups that met all or most of their
goals and have a realistic plan for fur
ther improvement scored high on the
effectiveness scale.
Moreover, this year's endorsement
process emphasized the need for spe
cial-fee groups to better manage
themselves and realize their responsi
bility to their constituency.
We believe that the new format is a
fruitful exercise for all involved. The
members of the editorial board
learned a tremendous amount about
the various student groups, and sever
al group representatives indicated that
the new process helped them think
more critically about their organiza
tions.
Nonetheless, the editorial board
recognizes that the endorsement pro
cedure is not perfect. We make the
best assessment possible, but it is not
easy for student groups to sum up a
year's worth of work in an 8-minute
presentation and 12-minute question
and-answer session.
The Daily endorsement process has
never purported to substitute stu
dents' individual study and analysis of
the election issues. We suggest that the
voting constituencies of these groups
use The Daily simply as an additional
source of information. We firmly
believe in the service The Daily pro
vides in ensuring a more informed stu
dent body.
This is even more valuable consid
ering the dwindling turnout rates for
elections held at every level nation
wide.
The editor extends an open invita
tion to special-fee groups to share
their thoughts on the process next
week.
