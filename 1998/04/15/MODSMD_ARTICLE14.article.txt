Dropout plan a cop-out
Elections are the birthplace of great
ideas, hut they also create shallow promises.
It is our task to sort through the campaign
ing and not fall prey to the hype. One of the
most meaningless promises this year is the
vow hv one slate to give up their jobs if they
do not keep their campaign pledges. It
sounds nice, but how practical is it? By giv
ing up their jobs midway through their
term, would the students of Stanford truly
be better served? No. it's a cop-out.
Resigning halfway through a term seems
to be a sign of dedication, but it's just a way
to provide an escape. Instead of seeing
things through, the candidates will drop the
hall and run. Their administration might be
poor, hut by quitting they will guarantee
another fruitless year.
I was always taught to finish what I start
ed. Do we want a slate that will only do its
job if things go its way? Don't be fooled,
fledging to resign is only another empty

promise by a standard politician.

Post-election dedication
Here's an idea:
All the ASSU presidential candidates
should fulfill their campaign promises
whether or not they are elected. They all
have good ideas for increasing student voice
and improving campus life, and obviously
they have a lot of energy.
The elected slate would be the leader of
the ASSU, but all the candidates would still
be involved in student government.
If all presidential candidates were
required next year to work on their plat
form projects, running for office would he a
commitment to dedicate time, energy and
creativity to Stanford's student bodyâ€” like
a IJRO proposal for student governance.
I urge those who don't win the election
to stay involved and press for the change

you see this campus needs.

IM rules support women
Monday's editorial on coed IM soccer
raises interesting questions about gender
equality in sports. Unfortunately, in many
popular sports, including soccer, men are
better designed than women for competi
tion, since most sports rely on physical
strength and speed rather than flexibility
(advantage to women) and decision-making
(gender invariant).
IM scoring rules are a bit patronizing and
condescending. However, they try to ensure
that women are treated as an important part
of the team. In most IM leagues I have
played in, women's goals are counted twice
as much as men's. This encourages teams to
include women whose technique may be
inferior to some of the male players.

It is not an ideal, or popular, solution.
But if a men's team plays a women's soccer
team at any level, the men's team will win,
usually by a wide margin. Am I sexist to rec
ognize this? Or is the editorial too political
ly correct to be honest and practical?

Science quad class woes
I am taking Biology 150. which meets in
Room 200 of the Teaching Center of the
Science and Engineering Quad. There are
300 normal-sized people in this class. Vet
this classroom was designed for midgets.
First, the amount of leg room is inade
quate. There is not enough room to place a
bag at your feet. Second, the desks' corners
were cut off to preserve natural resources.
This is great if you are using 5" x 6" paper.
Another feature of this classroom is that
the desks rest on your knee when you sit

upright. It is very conducive to learning to
take notes on a desk that is sloped away
trom you at a 45-degree angle. However, if
you like sitting in an uncomfortable,
slouched position for two hours and you
brought your miniature paper, the TCSEQ
2(H) is a great classroom.
Is this natural selection to make all sci
ence majors under 4 feet tall?
Ihe 1 ( SEQ 2(X) classroom may look
high tech and ooze with architectural
accents, but the purpose of the room as a
place for professors to lecture and students
to learn was overlooked.
