## The 						great election name game 
### 
Today, as i bike
to section, there
will be lots of
names on my mind.
Names like Moon.
Beaver. G-Spot, 7-Eleven.
Voiceless and Umpire. I
think I've spotted a trend
in this year's ASSIJ elec-

tion campaign. It seems like every Tom,
Dick and Harry has discovered how to work
his or her name or something resembling it
into a cheesy slogan.
I love it! Walking around campus has
never been so much fun. Every day I wake
up and run down the hall to the bulletin
board to see who "elsa" to vote for and who
won't be monkeying around in the ASSU.
Actually, I think the whole name cam
paigning thing has been around for a long
time. I still remember my freshman year,
when a student name Kai-Ming Fu ran for
ASSU senate with the slogan; "Say F-IJ to
the ASSU." The funny thing is, I still
remember his name, but he was never elect
ed. Hmmm ... maybe it takes more than
just a catchy slogan to go far.
Nevertheless. I really don't have the time
to fully inform myself about the platforms
and merits of the individuals running for
student government. So maybe I'll just vote
for inv friends and the ones with slogans.

Some people say that's cheap, insincere and
a detriment to democracy. But then again,
isn't that the way we run most of our lives?
Alter all. our minds aren't as simple as e
mail where we can just save everything into
special folders.
I also like the spirit of democracy that is
filling this campus. I can't even leave the
restroom without being reminded about
how much influence my little mouse-grip
ping right-hand index finger will have upon
the face of this university. I'm inspired by
the calls to nobility — "Aim high, gentle
men!" Just imagine how much more amaz
ing it will be next year, when ASSU elec
tions will have an interactive town forum
where students can fax in the latest ques
tions to candidates, who will be televised
live around the clock on SCBN.
Who says this campus isn't politically
active? From the looks of my dorm I would
say there are scores of folks here who care
about real reform and tackling the hard
issues — definitely not a mob of resume
packers. If everyone is so gung-ho about
this election, just imagine how engaged lie
or she will be during section. I can't wait
bring on the supplementary texts!
1 also love special fees. Who doesn't? Is
there anyone really so mean-spirited as to
reject a group's special-fee request?
What I really don't get is people who

refund their ASSIJ dues. Who came up with
that system? What's the point? I thought
the ASSI) was supposed to be an associa
tion by and for Stanford students. It seems
extremely selfish to ask for an ASSIJ
refund. After all. the same people who
request refunds seem not to mind hurling
up to $3().(XX) a year in tuition, room and
board. ASSIJ fees are pocket change in
comparison, and they help the whole stu
dent body.
.lust imagine Stanford without the Band,
ethnic support centers, the Speaker's
Bureau, intramural sports, the Stanford
Chapparal. KZSIJ. etc. Sure, many stu
dents belong to only a few student groups,
but we all benefit from what these organi
zations offer to campus life — art, news,
intellectual stimulation, athletics, parties
and more.
It is important to keep Stanford in per
spective. Many of us who have spent time
outside Stanford or studying at other uni
versities have come to realize that there
really are a lot of good things going on here
that should not be taken for granted.
One last thing ... today's April 15th. I
hope you've done your taxes.
