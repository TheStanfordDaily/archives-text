hoard spent more than 30 hours over the
past two weeks talking with the fee-seeking
groups and reviewing the budget and Elec
tions Handbook statement each group sub
mitted to the AS.SU. Whenever possible, the
editorial board met with group representa
tives and asked them questions about the
group's goids, its accomplishments and fail
ures during the past year, its plan of action
for the upcoming year, and how the
requested special-fee budget reflects lessons
learned this year.
Based on the written information and
the interview discussions, the board
reached a unanimous decision on each
group. The Daily encourages all students to
obtain a copy of the Elections Handbook
and read each group 's budget and hand
book statement for themselves.
IN AN EFFORT to hold spccial-fee
groups more accountable to the stu

modified its special-fee endorsement sys

As noted in the evaluation criteria edi
torial on March 31, The Daily has rated all
returning fee groups on a I to 5 scale based
on the "roup's effectiveness.
I he new fee group, the Undergraduate
Weenie Roast, has been rated on a 1 to 5
scale for both value and effectiveness.
In evaluating the groups, the editorial
board closely examined the achievements
of fee groups during the past year and the
viability of the group's plans for the
upcoming year.
Below is an explanation of the 1 to 5
"effectiveness" rating scale that was used.

itself.

The Undergraduate Weenie Roast is
a new group formed solely to organize a
party on the night before Big Game The
Roast s organizers will provide live
music, drinks and EANABS to achieve
their goal of increasing school spirit for
Big Game We agree that current festivi
ties are not as effective in mobilizing
school spirit. We also believe that if stu
dents give the Roast a special fee. the
organizers could stage a giant party
However, the Roast s value does not
justify asking for student s special-fee
money Other campus organizations like
Axe Committee are working toward the
same goal as the Roast Perhaps the
organizers should work with the Axe
Committee or find alternate funding
sources, such as the Program Board
and the Dean of Students office
General fees
Program Board: No increase
Publications Board: 10 percent
increase
Although the number of publications on
campus is constantly multiplying, the
Publication Board s general fee has not
had an increase in over a decade.
Community Service Board: 10 percent
increase
Many groups fall under the umbrella of the
Community Service Board. With the extra
funding, they could provide more sub
stantial services that benefit both the Stan

their goal of increasing school spirit for
Big Game We agree that current festivi

However, the Roast s value does not
justify asking for student s special-fee

Although the number of publications on

Publication Board s general fee has not

The Undergraduate Weenie Roast is
a new group formed solely to organize a
party on the night before Big Game The
Roast s organizers will provide live
music, drinks and EANABS to achieve
their goal of increasing school spirit for
Big Game We agree that current festivi
ties are not as effective in mobilizing
school spirit. We also believe that if stu
dents give the Roast a special fee. the
organizers could stage a giant party
However, the Roast s value does not
justify asking for student s special-fee
money Other campus organizations like
Axe Committee are working toward the
same goal as the Roast Perhaps the
organizers should work with the Axe
Committee or find alternate funding
sources, such as the Program Board
and the Dean of Students office
General fees
Program Board: No increase
Publications Board: 10 percent
increase
Although the number of publications on
campus is constantly multiplying, the
Publication Board s general fee has not
had an increase in over a decade.
Community Service Board: 10 percent
increase
Many groups fall under the umbrella of the
Community Service Board. With the extra
funding, they could provide more sub
stantial services that benefit both the Stan

Students involved in the Stanford
Solar Car Project participate in collegiate
and international races, successfully
competing against better-funded oppo
nents Unfortunately, the organization
has a small membership and we have
grave doubts about its viability
Due to low membership and a
change in leadership, the project has not
used its funding for the present year
Next year's funding would be best spent
recruiting members, making long-term
plans and soliciting donations However,
we are uncertain whether even these
modest goal? K e accomplished.

The Undergraduate Weenie Roast is
a new group formed solely to organize a
party on the night before Big Game The
Roast s organizers will provide live
music, drinks and EANABS to achieve
their goal of increasing school spirit for
Big Game We agree that current festivi
ties are not as effective in mobilizing
school spirit. We also believe that if stu
dents give the Roast a special fee. the
organizers could stage a giant party
However, the Roast s value does not
justify asking for student s special-fee
money Other campus organizations like
Axe Committee are working toward the
same goal as the Roast Perhaps the
organizers should work with the Axe
Committee or find alternate funding
sources, such as the Program Board
and the Dean of Students office
General fees
Program Board: No increase
Publications Board: 10 percent
increase
Although the number of publications on
campus is constantly multiplying, the
Publication Board s general fee has not
had an increase in over a decade.
Community Service Board: 10 percent
increase
Many groups fall under the umbrella of the
Community Service Board. With the extra
funding, they could provide more sub
stantial services that benefit both the Stan
ford community and surrounding towns.
