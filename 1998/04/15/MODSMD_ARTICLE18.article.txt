I would like to share the following question with all
of you. I was asked this question by an acquaintance
who is rather unique and uninhibited. Here is an
abstract of his proposal...
His question revolved around the active ingredient
in marijuana, THC. This is the toxin that is responsi
ble tor the herb's effects on people who ingest or
smoke it. Those effects most accurately can be
described as a feeling of lightheadedness and exag
gerated sensory perception. Many say that if you're
feeling bad. it will probably make you worse. If you're
feeling great, it will probably make you feel like
you're on cloud nine (figuratively and literally).
According to organic chemistry. THC is lipid solu
ble (able to dissolve into fat cells or cell membranes)
and could possibly stay "dormant" in fatty tissue for
up to 30 days or so. Well, 1 couldn't attest to how long
THC could stay dissolved in fatty tissue, but I was with
him so far. Anyway, if we accept that THC could dis
solve into fatty tissue and remain dormant in the said
tissue long after the "high" was gone — he meant
DAYS after — could we have a relapse?
In other words, couldn't one, a few days after
smoking some marijuana, participate in aerobic exer
cise. have some of this THC break free into the blood
stream as fat is metabolized during exercise, AND
couldn't that THC go to our brain? Wouldn't it have
the same effect on our brain that its brothers and sis
ters did the previous Saturday night, but just in a
smaller temporary dose?
Hmm. Good question. It sounds like a sound theo
ry. doesn't it? I mean, after all, it seems logical: THC
dissolves in fat, fat gets broken down, THC goes to
bloodstream, bloodstream goes to brain and finally,
THC goes to the brain. Well, to be completely honest,
I don't know. I really am not versed well enough in
the effects of THC, mechanisms and THC lipid solu
bility.
BUT, 1 suppose anything is possible ...
