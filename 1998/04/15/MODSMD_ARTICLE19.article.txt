Webster's be warned: sniffing not
smelling, scientists say
Young children often have hours of fun explor
ing "scratch-and-sniff' stickers. A group of Stan
ford researchers has passed its time in a perhaps
more worthwhile manner by exploring what could
he termed the "sniff and smell" response.
Many people don't distinguish between sniffing
— the action of air rushing up the nose — and
smelling — the attachment of odorant molecules to
nerve cells. But Asst. Psychology Prof. John
Gabrielli has found that the two events involve dif
ferent parts of the brain. Gabrielli stated that his
research group has "discovered what appear to be
two different aspects of olfactory processing." He
continued, "one is the exploratory phase — the
sniffing. And the second is the evaluative one — the
smelling."
The group theorizes that either one of the sniff
or smell processes could be defective in people who
cannot smell. Every year, 200.1 XX) people visit doc
tors with problems associated with the ability to
smell. Most Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease
patients have some sort of smell dysfunction.
Gabrielli and Noam Sobel, the lead author of
the new study and a graduate student in the neuro
science program, used images of brain activity to
define the sniff and smell responses. When their
volunteer subjects sniffed without any odor present,
images of their brains indicated that an area ot the
brain called the piriform cortex was most active.
However, when an odor was actually detected, the
frontal lobe showed more activity.
The team used a procedure called functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at
brain activity. fMRI detects the levels of oxygen
delivered to various nerve cells in the brain — high
er levels of oxygen correspond to higher levels of
activity.
Interestingly, the researchers also observed that
the sniff response could be generated when air was
blown up the nostrils, but not when the subjects
were asked to sniff with their noses blocked. They
concluded that this was because the response was
not generated from the movement of the nose mus
cles, but rather, the air passing through the nose.
Using this new knowledge, scientists may be
able to devise new schemes to treat smell dysfunc
tion. "It wasn't evident before that there were these
two phases of olfactory processing." Gabrielli said.
"Now wc can ask which one goes wrong in disease."
