# Preventing pandemics
## Early-warning system fights the flu 
### Rollin Hu Staff writer 
When officials in response to an
influenza outbreak ordered the slaugh
ter of millions of chickens in Hong
Kong last December, many people
wondered if the health department had
gone overboard. Most people associate
influenza, commonly known as the flu
or "grippe," with symptoms that are lit
tle more than fever, chills and general
malaise. However, influenza can be a
swift and deadly killer, as evidenced by
the infamous flu epidemic of 14IK that
killed between 15 and 25 million peo
ple.
To prevent another such deadly pan
demic, the World Health Organization
set up an international network of labo
ratories in 1947 to monitor flu out
breaks worldwide. These laboratories'
findings contribute to the development
of flu vaccines. The necessity of such an
elaborate monitoring system is a direct
result of the complexity and devious
ness of the influenza virus. Eric Claas of
the World Health Organization Nation
al Influenza Center stated in the Lancet
medical journal that the flu outbreak in
Hong Kong "illustrates the importance
of intensive global influenza surveil
lance."
There are actually three major types
of influenza virus. Type C influenza
does not cause disease, and type B usu
ally has very mild symptoms. However,
type A influenza, which is responsible
for periodic pandemics and epidemics,
can be fatal. Usually, only the very
young, the very old and those with com
promised immune systems are at risk of
dying from type A flu. The flu often
triggers pneumonia in the aged and
other high-risk populations. However,
some variants of type A can be deadly
to healthy young people, like the strain
which decimated the world's popula
tion in 191 <S.
The most frustrating problem with
the flu virus is that it often changes its
appearance, preventing the body's
immune system from defeating it. Nor
mally. once the body has been exposed
to a virus, it "remembers" the virus and
will immediately launch a protective
response if exposed again. This
immunological "memory" is what pre
vents people from getting the chicken
pox twice. Influenza viruses often
change two of their surface molecules
critical to the body's recognition and
memory of them.
These molecules, hemagglutinin and
neuraminidase, aid the virus in its infec

tion of target cells. However, influenza
changes these coat molecules regularly
so that the immune system no longer
recognizes it. Every year, the dominant
form of flu has a slightly modified type
of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase.
Occasionally, a drastic change occurs
in one or both of these molecules,

and this "new" virus successfully
evades most people's immune systems
and causes a major flu outbreak.
Scientists have now characterized a
number of the major sero-

logical types of flu
\irus, based on

their surface
molecules.

Th e

virus
that

caused
the 191X

epidemic was
labeled HswNl.

which, translated

from the scientific short-

hand, means that the virus had a
swinelike hemagglutinin protein (Hsw).
and a type 1 neuraminidase protein
(Nl).

Another virus that appeared in a
1929 epidemic was labeled HONI and
appeared to have kept the same neu
raminidase protein as the 191K virus,
but had changed its hemagglutinin pro
tein. Other viruses
similarly
labeled. The

recent Hong Kong avian flu worried
many researchers because it represent
ed a new hemagglutinin protein shift
characterized as HSNI.
This type of virus had

never infected

people before

that, and
was a

cause
of

much

concern.

Fortunately,
the outbreak was

contained by the inabil-

itv of the virus to spread from per
son to person, and was stopped by the
mass slaughter of potentially infected
chickens.

Usually, a novel virus arises some
where in western Asia between Decem
ber and March, ['his is the traditional
breeding ground for influenza. The
killer virus of 191K has been epidemio-
traced back down to one ot
two possible locations: Western China
or less likely, somewhere in Kansas. Jet

travel allows the
virus to spread
like wildfire.
In 1957, for
example. the
pandemic start
ed somewhere
in China in
February of
1957. By April,
it had reached
Hong Kong,
and by May. it
had spread
throughout
Southeast Asia
and into India
and Australia.
The first cases

of this flu were reported in California
and Louisiana in July of 1957. and with
in six weeks, had spread to every state
in the continental United States. In less
than six months, the virus had spread
over the entire world.
The rapidity of the spread worries
researchers developing vaccines. Usual
lv. labs in Asia monitor new flu out
breaks and characterize the type of flu
virus involved. Vaccine developers
around the world then use this informa
tion to predict the type of 11 u that will
spread and make the corresponding vac
cine. The flu shots administered each
year correspond to the three strains
most likely to cause outbreaks, and usu
ally include two type A vaccines and one
type B vaccine.
The effectiveness of the vaccine
depends on the similarit\ of the vaccine
to the actual flu virus being transmitted,
and is therefore indirectly dependent
on the data gathered by the flu moni
toring labs As a result, timely identifi
cation of a new virus strain and prompt
production of a vaccine could save
thousands of lives.
Whether the Hong Kong HSNI
influenza strain will eventually learn to
be transmitted human to human rather
than chicken to human remains to be
seen.
However, the efforts of epidemiolo
gists and virologists across the globe
can ensure that vaccines are available
to combat it before it causes another
devastating pandemic.
