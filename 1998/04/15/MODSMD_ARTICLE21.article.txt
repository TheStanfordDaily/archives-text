# Paul Ehrlich: maverick with a message
## 
### Lynne Mercer Contributing writer 
It is difficult to stand out and he noticed when sur
rounded by the shining stars who constitute the Stanford
faculty. Yet. standing out is exactly what Paul Ehrlich.
Bing Professor of Population Studies in the Biology
Department, has achieved.
With a Ph.D. from the University of Kansas.
Ehrlieh has been a member of the Stanford faculty
since 1959. He catapulted into the national and
international limelight in I%K when his book. "The
Population Bomb," was published. In it he warned that
the world population was exploding beyond the
earth's capability to sustain it. In an era when scientists

were discouraged from "going public." and even ostra
cized by their colleagues if thc\ dared to do so. he
risked his own career.
As it turned out. Ehrlich had little to tear from his
Stanford colleagues, who supported him from the
beginning. The prizes and awards that have been show
ered on him are a testament to the esteem in which he
is held throughout the scientific and non-scientific com
munity.
His prizes and awards, main of which are ranked
among the most coveted in science, include the first
AAAS/ Scientific American Prize for Science in the Ser
vice of Humanity, the Heinz Award for the Environ
ment. a Mac Arthur Prize 112 ellowship, the International
Center for Tropical Ecology's World Ecology Medal,
and the Royal Swedish Academ\ of Sciences' Crafixird
Prize in Population Biology and the Conservation of
Biological Diversity. Most recently, the lyler Prize for
Environmental Achievement was awarded to Ehrlich
and his wife. Anne.
Both the Tyler Prize and the Crafoord Prize are
extremely prestigious. According to Ehrlich's biograph
ical sketch, the Crafoord Prize, which he shared with E.
C). Wilson ol Harvard I niversity. is "an explicit replace
ment for the Nobel Prize for areas where the Nobel is
not given." Or. as Ehrlich phrased it.it is "important
enough so that my mother got to have tea with the king
and queen of Sweden "
Ehrlich is a fellow of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science and the American Acade
my of Arts and Sciences, and holds many other honors
and titles.
To Ehrlich. being at Stanford is absoluteh the key to
his success. "By being at Stanford I have been sur
rounded by extremely gtxxl scientists throughout my
career." Ehrlich explained, "and tree to pursue my
research."
Ehrlich also enjoys teaching and is proud of his
department's teaching programs "The Department of
Biological Sciences is deeply devoted to excellence in
teaching and is living prtxif that first-rate research can
coexist with first-rate teaching." he boasted proudly.
When his works were first published, his opinions

were run always embraced, even b\ mainstream scien
tists. Ehrlich is particularly pleased that the vast majori
ty of scientists and educated people throughout the
world have come to understand and agree with his mes
sage.
In the appendix to his kx>k. "Betrayal of Science and
Reason." he printed a statement presented in at
the International Conference on Population and Devel
opment. The statement underscores "the need for gov
ernment policies and initiatives that will help achieve
zero population growth within the lifetime of our chil
dren." It was prepared b\ 56 of the world's scientific
academies and signed b\ over 1.670 scientists, including
104 Nobel laureates (more than half of the living recipi
ents of the Nobel Prize in the sciences).
Ehrlich is also encouraged on other fronts. "It is very
cheering to see the increasing interaction between ecol
ogists and economists." he said. But much remains to be
done, and not everybody is convinced. Ehrlich, who
plans never to retire, has his work cut out for him. Dis
believers have gone so far as to circulate fake articles
that Kxik like reprints from reputable scientific journals,
according to Ehrlich These articles debunk such con
cepts as global warming. "When the idiots on the far left
and far right stop attacking me." he quips. "I will know
1 am doing something wrong."
Ehrlich exudes energy and continues his research
and teaching while alerting the public and politicians to
issues of overpopulation and its impact on resources and
the environment.
Despite his hectic schedule Ehrlich still manages to
find quiet time to spend with his family and to enjoy
hobbies. These include tribal art. birdwatching and fine
wine. He was an instrument rated pilot for many years,
and military history is another of his favorite pastimes.
Anne Ehrlich met her husband at the University of
Kansas and has collaborated with him throughout his
career. She has co-authored many of his lxx>ks. They
have one daughter and three granddaughters.
When asked what he would most like to be remem
bered for. Ehrlich said. "Telling the truth and trying to
make the world a better place." It seems he may. once
again, succeed.
