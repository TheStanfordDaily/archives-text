# Expert Isozaki talks art

### Brittney Jensen 
Japanese architect Arata Iso/aki
ist night traced the evolution of the
art museum in a lecture with accom
pany ing slides of his varied work.
\unenberg Auditorium was tilled
to capacity with a mostly older crowd
that anxiously awaited Isozaki's de
layed arrival from Beijing.
Petei Walker, a landscape design
er on campus, introduced "lso" as
an international architect of consid
erable tank and interest, here and all
over the world." In addition to win
ning numerous architectural awards.
Iso/aki has designed projects such .is
the 1 os Angeles Museum of Con
temporary Art and the San Jordi
Sports Hall for the 1992 Barcelona
Olympics.
Iso/aki described the consider
able challenge he laced in designing
Japan's first modern art museum 25
years ago.
"Most people weren't interested
in a museum for modern art; they
preferred the traditional museum for
classic art." he said.
The traditional museum design
stemmed from 18th-century collec
tions of art meant to express the iden
tities of nation states. Iso/aki ex
plained. "The first generation of art
museums were like palaces, gor
geous. monumental," he said. " This
fit the content: art pieces collected

from ancient temples and shrines."
In the second generation, muse
ums were transformed to reflect art
created for homes, not temples,
Iso/aki said; sculptures with bases
and paintings with frames allowed
greater mobility. Thus the new muse
ums were simple, "needing only a
w all to hang paintings and a floor to
place sculptures."
Based on these understandings,
Iso/aki designed the Museum of
Modern Art in Ciunma, Japan, with
"movable partitions for changing ex
hibitions. Every modern painting has
friends that it is arranged with ac
cording to the context of the show."
He literally interpreted the muse
um as a frame for art by forming the
building through "cubic frames,
square windows, square panels, half
exposed, half covered."
In 1991, Isozaki designed what he
describes as "the third generation of
art museums," the Nagi Museum of
Contemporary Art in Okavama,
Japan.
The mayor of the city wanted a
museum of modern art. but the city
had no artwork to display. So Isozaki
worked with artists to create a muse
um that was itself art made up of "im
movable art pieces in a permanently
installed environment."
The museum consists of three sec
tions: a rectangle whose axis pointed
to a nearbv sacred mountain, a hori

zontal cylinder sun and a crescent
moon.
During his speech. Isozaki
thought one of the slides of the interi
or cylinder was upside down, but
even for him it was hard to tell in the
circular space with benches on the
ceilings and rocks protruding in from
the walls at every angle.
The building also played with "un
predictable acoustics," he said. "The
sound of walking changed from the
point to the center of the crescent."
University President Gerhard
Casper opened the lecture by de
scribing the importance of architec
ture at Stanford.
"When Stanford opened its doors
in IK9I. its only form of artistic ex
pression was architectural design,"
Casper said. "For most of us, archi
tecture is the form of art we en
counter most."
Casper said the University has
started an effort to make up for what
he described as a "mundane" archi
tectural period during the last
decade.
"By the end of the century. Stan
ford will have a campus second to
none not only in its functionality but
also in it's beauty." he said.
Iso/aki's lecture was the first in
stallment of the fourth annual land
scape and architecture series, which
will continue with lectures on April
28, Mav 12 and Mav 26.
