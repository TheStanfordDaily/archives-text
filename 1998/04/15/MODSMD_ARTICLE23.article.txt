## Programming extended 
### Jaime Adame Contributing writer 
Computers are now available for student use at the
Women's Center, adding to an array of new tutoring and
academic programs there.
The cluster consists of nine Macintosh machines, each
fully networked. Made possible through a grant from the
Office of the President and a donation from the (Kerseas
Studies Program, the cluster also includes a printer that
students may use free of charge. The center's study group
/ tutoring program, which began last quarter, is expand
ing to include 19 classes, as well as a writing tutor. All stu
dents are welcome to attend.
Master's student Diana Swart/., program director of
the Women's Center, said more than 220 students partic
ipated in the program last quarter, when tutors were
available for only 15 classes.
"The idea was to bring more people in the Women's
Center and provide a nice, comfortable environment for
women," said coterminal student Eileen Peters, who co
founded the program with Swart/.
Tutors are primarily drawn from Society of Women
Engineers, the Graduate Women's Network and Cap
and Gown Women's Honor Society. They undergo train
ing through the Center for Teaching and Learning.
Tutoring is available daily from 7 to 9 p.m., but study
groups may stay longer.
Swart/ said that while individual tutoring is available
elsewhere, the study group aspect of the program is im
portant because it allows for interaction with peers and a
sense of community.
Peters, vice president of Society of Women Engi
neers, noted that many students stav to study together

after the tutors have left.
"Sharing strengthens knowledge." she said, encour
aging everyone to attend the sessions.
The sessions are scheduled to coincide with problem
sets and midterms. The Women's Center site on the
World Wide Web
(http://www.stanford.edu/group/womenscntr) has a
complete schedule of classes for which tutoring and study
group sessions are offered.
"All professors have been extremely supportive,"
Swart/ said.
The center also began a faculty adviser program this
year. T his quarter. Assi. Religious Studies Prof. Alice
Bach will hold office hours on Thursdays from 2 to 4 p.m.
Bach said students often find it difficult to speak with
busy faculty members, and when they meet with profes
sors, they expect to talk only about issues specifically re
lated to class.
"Students can come and talk about anything they
want," she said, adding that men are welcome as well.
Another recently introduced program is the Research
Round Table, which is designed to encourage students to
become involved in independent research.
"I think it helps, especially for women, to have a place
to ask questions without worrying about sounding un
professional," said senior Kate Stinger, the educational
program intern for the center.
The center has begun to offer educational support for
the surrounding community through efforts such as a
mentorship program for 20 to 25 sophomore girls at An
drew Mill I ligh School in San Jose. Stinger said logistics
have made it difficult for mentors to meet regularly, ham
pering the success of the program. "When we get togeth
er. it's been good." she said.
