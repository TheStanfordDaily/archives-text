## Golf gives gutsy show on green 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf team hosted the 54-hole U.S.
Intercollegiate Tournament this weekend at Stanford
Golf Course. The team took 15th overall, and sophomore
Dusty Brett turned in another strong performance with a
fourth-place finish.
Brett led the team with a final score of 217, tying him
for fourth with John Mercer of New Mexico State. His
second-round one-under-par 70 was the lowest score
posted by the Cardinal. It was Brett's best finish since the
Nike Northwest Classic on Oct. 7 of last year, where he
finished second.
The University of San Francisco and Pacific led the
tournament after the first round, tied with 293. But then
fourth-place UCLA stormed back from its first-round
2%, taking the lead with a second-round 291 and holding

it with a final round 290 to win the tournament with a
score of 877. Washington took second by scoring 881.
"UCLA's got a terrific program and a great coach."
said Stanford head coach Wally Goodwin.
Stanford improved each day, shooting a collective
311-301-295 for a final score of 907. That was good for
15th overall, a respectable score given the absence of star
junior Joel Kribel. Kribel missed the tournament because
lie was playing in The Masters.
"If Kribel had been there and shot just a 72. we would
have taken fourth, so that's pretty good," Goodwin said.
"I was happy to see that our final round score was fourth
best on the day. That was not an easy round."
The Cardinal's final round improvement was due
largely to the performances of freshmen Alex Aragon
and James Lee, who shot 72 and 73, respectively, after
identical 155 two-day scores.
"I was really happy to see the freshmen go 80-75-72
and 80-75-73." Goodwin said. "[Brett] had a chance to
win the tournament. We're playing OK, and with Kribel
we'd be a really tough team."
The tournament likely helped Stanford's cause in the
eyes of the regional tournament selection committee.
