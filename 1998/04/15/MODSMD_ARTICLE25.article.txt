# Brad Pitt inspires rowdy fishermen
## 
### 
Since spring has arrived and El Nino is returning to his watery hiber
nation haven, we decided to spend a little time with nature, going hack to
one of the most fundamental sports of human existence—fishing. And
what better place than our own Lake Lag.
Robin: There are no fish in Lake Lag!
Va: How do you know? Have you ever been fishing here?
Kohin: No, I missed that special fee about stocking the lake with trout it
must have been by the one about the climbing wall.
Va: Shut up. Robin. Stop being a smartass. They're building the climbing
wall — it's just taking time.
Robin: Seriously, you've got to be quiet toeateh fish. Plus you're going to
pop the Zodiac 3(X), our trusty vessel, that I bought at Wal-Mart.
Va: You don't know anything about fishing do you? Your research for

this article was probably staying up last night watching infoinercials about
the new helicopter lure.
Robin: I know you've been bitter for the past month, but can we write a
column instead of you just yelling at me? Let's talk about fishing. What
makes it so unique?
Va: Well. Robin, I enjoy waking up at 4:30 in the morning, traveling in a
pickup and drinking doughnuts and beer for breakfast before I get on a
boat and control a large motor.
Robin: That doesn't sound very safe. Don't you think fishing has better
qualities than that? 1 enjoy the camaraderie.
Va: Yeah, nothing better than you and me in a rubber boat with a Power
book and sharp, hooked objects. You really get to know w hat a person's
made of. Pass the 1 10-l lo's.
Robin: You know, Vanessa. I'm from Allentown, (la., and for once Ire
ally think I know more about the subject than you. Pishing is in my blood
Va: Alright then, who's your favorite professional angler?
Robin: I have so many favorites I can't just pick one. Anyone with good
wrist control, 1 like to watch.
Va: They say it's all in the wrist. Since you're the expert, what's your fa
vorite type of fishing?
Robin: Since I saw "A River Runs Through It." I've always liked lly fish
ing when Brad Pitt is there, but since the waders are too cold. I prefer tra
ditional fishing from a boat.
Va: I like fishing for compliments. Do you like this shirt?
Robin: Yeah, it's great. Let me tell you about a fishing incident from my
past that has some relevance here. I'here was this neighborhood kid. and
we decided to go fishing one day. We went out to out local hillbilly lake,
brushed away the tin cans and old boots and set sail on a boat much like
this one. To make a short story long, we spent all day in the hot sun. ar
