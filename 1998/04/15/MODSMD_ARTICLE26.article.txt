Head coach Dick (iould had only
one regret about this season. "You
know, we didn't have a single day of
good weather this entire season."
Despite Stanford's weather woes
yesterday. No. 13 Boise State (21-6)
was no different than any other team.
I he Broncos lost in a 6-omatch to the
Cardinal (22-0. 10-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference ).
Freshman Alex Kim. playing at
fifth singles, was the first to reign in a
point for the Cardinal with a 6-0.6-0
score over sophomore K> uji Araki.
As soon as Kim finished his
match, the sunns weather gave way
to a downpour, postponing the
matches. Play was soon moved to the
indoor court, where Boh Bryan fin
ished up his match against senior
I solak Gevorkian. Before the rain
delay. Bryan had been up 4-0. but in
the second set. Gevorkian. whose
playing improved with each game,
pushed Bryan to a tiebreaker and
eventually t(x>k the second set 7-6
with his consistent playing. But.
Bryan fought back in the third set
with a series of close games to win the
match 6-3.7-6.6-2.
"I'm really proud of the way Bob
played in the third set." (iould said.
"Hisopponent was plavinij vers well.

and Bob fought hard to come back."
Flaying at the second singles spot
for Stanford was senior captain Paul
Goldstein in his last home match of
his Stanford career. (ioldstcin easily
won his match against Bronco fresh
man Adam Webster. 6-2.6-( >
' It was niee to close with a win."
(ioldstcin said I felt really nostalgic
out there. I started shaking when I
was up match point, ready to serve.
An overwhelming feeling suddenly
came over me."
Outdoor match plav resumed
after Goldstein's match, and at third
singles, junior Ryan Wolters pulled
out a win over Boise State junior
( on Dalos. 7-6.6-1.
"Wolly had a sloppy first few
games," Gould said, "but he really
came on strong to close out the
match, as he should have."
Ai the No 4 sjx)t. sophomore
Cieofl Abrams breezed b\ sopho
more Andrew Rounneh 6-0.6-1 and
freshman Scotty Scott closed out the
competition with a win over junior
Tristan Bounds, fr-2.6-1
"They 've done a great job of rising
to the occasion this entire season.'
(iould said "Day in and day out.
these gu\s are ready to play.
Although both of Boise States
top twoplayers were out. (iould was
still \ery concerned about the out
come of the match.
"This is the fourth week in a row
we've had three matches in a week I
was afraid of a let-down," he said.
"Fortunately, that didn't happen.
"It was a chance for a psychologi
cal let-down, knowing that they were
missing their top two players li s
\cr\ easy to get careless and sloppy,
and we almost did. I think the rain
delay actually helped us refocus."
With a record of 125 out of 126
singles wins, an unheard of record in
dual match competition, Stanford is
looking strong for the upcoming
NC "AA tournament.
"There has never been a team in
college tennis that has done what this
team has done to this point." Gould
s;iid. "I'm rcallv. really proud of
them."
