James Montoya.
his staff and stu
dent leaders are all
planning to take
action in response
to the recently re
leased Undergrad
uate Experience

Survey, which was conducted in Jan
uary.
Although 69 percent of Stanford
students reported satisfaction with
their overall experience, only 26 per
cent indicated that they felt valued as
a person by the University.
" This survey reaffirms lhat stu
dents are not happy with the small
role the University has given them in
making decisions," said junior San
tos Marroquin. an ASSU senator
and Alpha Sigma resident who has
led recent protests against Office of
Residential Education decisions.
Improving the degree to which
student feel valued as a person was
the emphasis of Montoya's staff
meeting yesterday morning, but
even he admitted the goal was am
biguous.
"We really don't know what that
means, but we need to work to better
understand that." Montoya said.
He has already established the
Oualitv Service Task Force, which,
among other things, will conduct
focus groups in the next two weeks to
get input from students regarding
their experiences in dealing with the
administration.
The survey is "one piece of infor
mation." Montoya said. "Our job is
to bring many pieces of information
together so we can have as compre
hensive a view of the student pro
gram as we possibly can."
Student leaders applauded Mon
toya's call for increased student
input in University decisions and
plan to take advantage of the oppor
tunity.
Marroquin. in conjunction with
other student leaders, said he is
going to try to achieve better com
munication between Res E 7 .d and stu
dents.
"For now, we want to focus our
efforts on Res Ed because once that
office changes, we think that action

will set a precedent for other previ
ously inflexible offices," Marroquin
said. Tomorrow, Marroquin and
other student representatives will
meet with Res Fid staff.
He pointed to investment respon
sibility and transportation services as
other possible targets of reform.
Disabled Students of Stanford
also plans to initiate more talks with
the University.
"Disabled students can talk best
about physical access or lack there
of." explained junior Daniel Davis, a
member of the group. Disabled Stu
dents of Stanford "would be very re
ceptive to proposals to increase stu
dent voice, and one of our priorities
now would be to see what we could
do to upgrade accessibility of dorms,
especially for freshmen who are also
making a difficult transition."
Moreover, some leaders are call
ing for more student involvement in

University governance.
"Students are sick of being on ad
visory committees where they can
just be ignored," Marroquin said.
ASSU President Emily Andrus'
suggested appointment of students
as voting members of the Board of
Trustees could be one such a step to
increasing student involvement. As
of now, students are only allowed an
advisory function on trustee com
mittees.
"The perspective of a current stu
dent could have an impact on the
[trustees'] decision-making process
and give the students a forum to ad
dress some of the most important
decision makers at the University."
Andrus said.

Montoya. though expressing en
thusiasm for student input, ex
pressed some caution in giving stu
dents governance powers.
"('learlv there are some decisions
that need to be made without stu
dent input, but 1 believe that stu
dents should have a say in most deci
sions." he said.
Some students have questioned
the accuracy of the survey because it
was conducted before recent contro
versies arose.
"1 think that if the survey came
out right now. students would say
they feel valued even less." Marro
quin noted. "1 don't think students
realized how much they were being
ignored until the Alpha Sig and Res
Ed incident."
Montoya. however, voiced confi
dence in the survey results.
"The survev was broad enough

looking at the comprehensive stu
dent experience that it would not he
dramatically different," he said.
Montoya emphasized that the
survey is not an endpoint hut instead
a part of an ongoing dialogue be
tween students and the administra
tion.
Most student affairs units — Res
Ed. Housing and Dining Services,
Cowell Student Health Center, the
Office of Student Activities and the
ethnic centers — conduct annual
surveys themselves. "Ongoing stu
dent feedback ... is very valuable to
us." Montoya explained.
Student leaders agreed on the
value of feedback.
"Students have to stay involved
and realize you can't just roll over,"
Marroquin said. "We're gaining
ground. Right now there's some
thing to look forward to."
