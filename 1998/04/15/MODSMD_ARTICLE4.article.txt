## 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
Most Stanford students — 69
percent to be exact — are happy
with their Stanford experience, ac
cording to a survey conducted in
January bv the office of Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya.
"With a few exceptions, there is
little dissatisfaction demonstrated
in this survey," Montoya said.
Students were happiest with the
way Stanford allowed them to grow
as people (62 percent) and with
their academics (61 percent). Fifty
five percent indicated that they
were satisfied with Stanford's ex
tracurricular activities and 52 per
cent with the sense of community.
Forty-two percent of students indi
cated that they were happy with
their residences.
One of the exceptions to the pos
itive tone of the survey was interac
tion with student support services,
which include Cowell Student
Health Center, the Registrar's Of
fice. the Dean of Students Office and
the Haas Center for Public Service.
Of the 4b 1 sophomores, juniors and
seniors who responded to the survey,
only 29 percent were satisfied with
student support services.
Another complaint raised bv the
survey was that only 26 percent of the
responding students felt valued as
people. Specifically. 23 percent were
happy with the degree to which Stan
ford allows them to get involved in
th e gove mance of the IJ n i ve rsi tv, and
18 percent felt that the University was
responsive to their concerns.
The survey noted that while 76
percent of students who lived in all
freshman dormitories were satisfied

with their Stanford experience, only
62 percent of those who lived in four
" class dorms their freshman year were
satisfied.
"Wo are doing something in the
all-freshman houses that we need to
understand so we can do it for all stu
dents," Montoyasaid.
In response to other questions
about residential life, only 20 percent
of students indicated that they were
happy with the availability of study
space in the residences. Fourteen
percent of respondents were pleased
with the Draw process, and i 1 per
cent were satisfied with the availabil
ity of single rooms.
I'he survey was the follow-up to a
round of focus groups held this fall by
Montoya and Jerold Pearson, direc
tor of market research in t he (Mice of
Development.
"What we heard in the focus

groups wasn't very surprising, but the
survey allowed us to know which of
those problems we could make the
most difference by addressing." Pear
son said.
Montoya and Pearson e-mailed
information about the survey to 735
students. 63 percent of whom re
sponded.
Each survey question could be an
swered on a scale of one to seven,
with a score of one indicating that the
student was very dissatisfied and
seven indicating very satisfied. The
percentages of students considered
"satisfied" or "happy" on a given
question were those who responded
with a score of six or seven.
Overall. Montoya was delighted
with the results.
"What pleases me most is that 87
percent of students would choose
Stanford again." he said.
