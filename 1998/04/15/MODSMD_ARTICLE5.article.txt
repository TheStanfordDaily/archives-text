lounge to hear bedtime stories
C asper's visit, which included two stories and casual
socializing with students, was one of the many programs
that the Office of Residential Education brings to the
dorms every week.
I his is not the Res Ed that has been \ ilified 111 recent
student pamphlets and dinner conversations. Main stu
dents have expressed dissatisfaction with their exclu
sion from Res Ed administrative decisions, but the ol
lice also provides students with a network ol stafl with
in their dorms that are there to support them.
"My position with students hasn't changed." s.ud
Resident Student Affairs Specialist Jamila Saudi of Ho
rence Moore Hall. "I have maintained a eood relation
ship with students. The conflict is not with Res Ed .is a
whole, but with the leadership and the lack ol informa
tion in the decision-making process "

I think that people are generally happy vsith tin
way things work in the dorm.' said Roble Resident As
sistant Paul Heneman. "Hut they are unhappy with tht
lack of student input in decisions like the Cowell Clus
ter and the exclusion of fifth-year students from RA po
sitions "
I lie goals dI the Res I d program, as provided in its
mission statement, arc to promote intellectual stimula
tion. further academic progress and success, create a
pluralistic community and train students in leadership.
Fach ol these goals is brought about throuiih the staff
working in each dorm.
Making administrative decisions, although clearly
part ol Res Ids responsibilities, is nut the main focus of
the office.
"Residential Education provides students with the
opportunity to li\e on campus in an environment which
supports a student's academic path at the I niversitv."
said Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya.
Res Ed is important because it provides options ap
propriate to a student's needs, likes and dislikes."
