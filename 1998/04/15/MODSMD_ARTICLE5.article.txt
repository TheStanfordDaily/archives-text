nearly 50 students gathered at University President
Gerhard Casper's feet Monday night in the Ruble Hall
lounge to hear bedtime stories
C asper's visit, which included two stories and casual
socializing with students, was one of the many programs
that the Office of Residential Education brings to the
dorms every week.
I his is not the Res Ed that has been \ ilified 111 recent
student pamphlets and dinner conversations. Main stu
dents have expressed dissatisfaction with their exclu
sion from Res Ed administrative decisions, but the ol
lice also provides students with a network ol stafl with
in their dorms that are there to support them.
"My position with students hasn't changed." s.ud
Resident Student Affairs Specialist Jamila Saudi of Ho
rence Moore Hall. "I have maintained a eood relation
ship with students. The conflict is not with Res Ed .is a
whole, but with the leadership and the lack ol informa
tion in the decision-making process "

I think that people are generally happy vsith tin
way things work in the dorm.' said Roble Resident As
sistant Paul Heneman. "Hut they are unhappy with tht
lack of student input in decisions like the Cowell Clus
ter and the exclusion of fifth-year students from RA po
sitions "
I lie goals dI the Res I d program, as provided in its
mission statement, arc to promote intellectual stimula
tion. further academic progress and success, create a
pluralistic community and train students in leadership.
Fach ol these goals is brought about throuiih the staff
working in each dorm.
Making administrative decisions, although clearly
part ol Res Ids responsibilities, is nut the main focus of
the office.
"Residential Education provides students with the
opportunity to li\e on campus in an environment which
supports a student's academic path at the I niversitv."
said Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya.
Res Ed is important because it provides options ap
propriate to a student's needs, likes and dislikes."
According to members of vari
ous dorm staffs, the negative re
sponse to the recent decisions have
failed to color the relationship be
tween residents and their staff.
"I think that the whole thing is
unfortunate because of the negative
association with Res Ed." said Kim
ball Resident Fellow John Rick
ford. "At Kimball, there were a lot
of people unhappy with the changes

made, but the day-to-day workings
in the dorm haven't been affected."
Instead of viewing themselves as
part of the dissatisfaction with Res
Ed. staff members voiced similar
feelings of frustration in being ex
cluded from the administrative de
cision-making process.
"Students can be very reason
able and should be included in deci
sions." Saudi said. "It's hard to sup
port [the Res Ed administration]
when you don't know what they are
doing."
Cardenal RA Andv Bradlev

noted a rift between dorm stall's and
the administration because of the
one-sided nature of the relation
ship. Although the staff turns to the
administration for help in internal
matters, they are not invited to par
ticipate in the office's decisions. He
added that this division is exacer
bated by the differing goals of the
two aspects of Res Ed.
"There's a lot of talk about pro
gramming. but it's really just icing
on the cake," Bradley said. "What
gets you through the night in the
dorm is caring about people."
