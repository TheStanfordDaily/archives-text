## 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
Drawing on their i xpeiiences during the
past year, ASSI PreMdent fcmih Andrus
and Vice President Hen Deckct had the fol
lowing advice for the winners ol this week s
presidential election
"Keep the long-term \iahility of the
ASSI in mind, locus youi energy on projects
that will continue in the future and don't get
caught up in the media game by pursuing
projects that will iust make headlines."
Decker said
Andrus and Dcckci adopted this ;ip
proa h when thev to> k office last spring and
feel that their administration has marked a
change in the tone, style and locus of the
ASSU.
The duo's campaign platform pledged to

put the ASSI in order, improve communi
cation between students and administrators
and provide tangible benefits for students
through projects such as a course guide and a
Draw guide.
"It hasn't been all lun. and we've taken
our share of criticism, said Decker, a coter
minal student. "But we're proud of what
we've accomplished. Anyone who takes a
good look at our record will be satisfied."
According to Andrus and Decker, laying
the foundation for projects and programs
that can continue to be implemented in fu
ture years was one of the most important
components of their administration.
I'he ASSI J Course Guide, issued for
spring quarter, w as one such project.
I hough the student bod\ had a mixed re
spouse to the guide, Andrus feels that it
can continue to improve in future years.
Decker pointed out that much of the en
ergy spent on the course guide this year
had to do with getting permission from the
Faculty Senate to carry out the project. In
coming years, he noted, this energy can be
channeled toward the quality of the guide
itself.
Other long-term changes that their ad
ministration will leave behind are coordi
nation of the Bookstore Advisory Com
mittee and a Draw guide that is forthcom

ing.
" There was a shift from talking about
making sweeping changes to actually
working on practical projects," said ASSU
Senate Chair Joe Freund, a junior. "People
were less interested in making students at
large and The Daily impressed than with
getting projects under way."
"What [Andrus and Decker] did the
most was lay the groundwork for future
successes." Freund added.
Andrus and Decker believe their focus
on projects has been an important shift
from the preceding Bill Shen and Nick
Thompson administration.
"The focus of student government
should not be on giant, national change,"

Decker said. "The focus of student govern
ment as we see it is tangible projects that
leave a concrete impact on the Stanford
experience."
Decker was referring to Shen and
Thompson's attempts to challenge the
U.S. News & World Report's university
rankings and to boycott corporations with
investments in Burma.
"In the end, they promised to do very
little, and they followed through with
that," Shen said of Andrus and Decker.
"That's not meant to be critical: that's just
meant to say that their approach to student
government was decidedly less proactive
than what Nick and 1 set out to do."
But Andrus and Decker's focus on the

specific details of projects may have con
tributed to a perception that they lacked a
larger vision for the student body.
"At times, it was unclear what their pur
pose was in office besides holding the of
fice and seeing it through until the next of
fice." Shen said.
However. Andrus and Decker see the
legacy of their focus on concrete projects
in the current ASSIJ elections, where they
feel the presidential slates have goals simi
lar to theirs.
"People are looking for specific plans."
Andrus said. "They're more focused on
projects."
They plan to go over the work they have
done this year with the elected ticket so

their projects can continue next year.
"We don't want four work I to be a sunk
cost." Andrus said.
T hough Andrus and Decker have been
criticized for not stepping in on behalf of
students on recent housing issues, Andrus
pointed out that they "found out the same
day students found out."
Decker also said the more fundamental
issue in the housing controversy is how the
I Jniversity makes its decisions and the lack
of student input in the process. I le said that
the problem requires an "institutional
framework for student input" rather than
an incident-specific response from the
ASSU.
"I know [Emily] met with ad
ministrators, had good relations
with the dean of students and she
did a good deal of the behind-the
scenes administrative mainte
nance," Shen said.
"Hut maybe students preferred
a president who could've stepped
up and been a little more contro
versial."
Andrus, however, noted that
she had wanted to move away from

"past inefficiencies and petty poli
tics" in her administration.
The pair has also worked to in
crease the continuity of ASSU par
ticipation with a freshman council
and summer mailings to freshmen
about the ASSU.
Andrus and Decker believe
they have changed the ASSU's
tone for the year, ending "political
infighting" in the senate and keep
ing the budget balanced.
"The ASSU has been a lot less
of a political government this
year," Freund said, "especially
considering that just two years ago
there was a lot of bickering.

"In the long run. if this attitude
continues, it'll be beneficial for the
students."
As part of their campaign plat
form. Andrus and Decker also
pledged to bring back the Big
Game Bonfire in Lake Lagunita.
After helping conduct research
and submitting a report to Univer
sity administrators, their proposal
was rejected.
"When it comes down to it.the
ASSU president doesn't make the
decision." Andrus said.
"Things are hard to change at
this place." Decker said. "You
don't realize this until vou try."
