6 Tips for Safe and Legal Bicycling at Stanford
WHEELS ON THE STREET,
HEELS ON THE SIDEWALK
For "wheels" (bicyclists):
Where there's a sidewalk along a street
or parking lot. stay off it unless
you're walking or parking your bike.
Sidewalks are for walking, not biking
\ \q
a v\
In the center of campus where there are _ > —~~ m \ er\
only mixed paths and malls , slow down H l \ \
enough to be able to stop if you need to — \ —
being late to class is no excuse for a crash For courtesy and safety,
don't pass walkers too close — slow up and wait for a gap rather than
squeezing by (a bike bell helps). Remember, pedestrians have the right of way
Inside the Main Quad, the arcades are walking spaces. Bike on the central plaza and service
alleys instead If you must travel along the arcades, dismount. When riding across arcades, yield
to pedestrians.
For "heels" (walkers):
Where there's a sidewalk — for example on Serra Street — please use it! For your own
safety, keep the street open for bikes, trucks, and Marguerites.
On crowded paths and malls (like beside the Quad at class-change time), keep to the
right so bicycles and other traffic can pass you safely
