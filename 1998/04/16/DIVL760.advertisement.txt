THURSDAY, APRIL 16 4:15 - 5:30 p.m.
BUILDING 420 (JORDAN HALL), ROOM 041
In 1975, Indonesia invaded and annexed the independent
nation of East Timor. Genocide followed, with arms supplied
by the United States. Over 200,000 Timorese have died —
shot, bombed, starved. Constancio was a student activist,
forced underground, who made an arduous escape to
Portugal. As a fellow student [temporarily at Brown], he has
much to tell us about what we can do in the fight against
oppression. He will also introduce a new video (30 min.),
"Indonesia: One Struggle, One Change."
