# Grape issues education sees renewal
## 
### Jennie Berry Contributing writer 
Dean of Students Marc Wais and Director of Resi
dential Education Jane Camarillo are forming a commit
tee to improve Stanford students' knowledge of the
United Farm Workers' boycott of California grapes.
The Grapes Education Committee is going to plan,
develop and implement at least one major University
wide educational program each academic year by Oct. 31
concerning the boycott. According to Wais, a series of
grapes education programs is also a possibility, but right
now the committee will focus on the single main pro
gram.
The program w ill be videotaped, so it can be used bv all
residences any time. I lowever, it w ill probably be used dur
ing the fall quarter when the residences are expected to
vote on whether their dining halls will serve grapes.
"I think this represents a great University-wide initia
tive to provide balanced educational programming to
the campus community concerning the UFW grapes
boycott issue," Wais said.
Currently residences are encouraged to vote on the
grapes boycott issue, but. according to Res Ed. they are
not required to do so.
In fact. Res Ed does not even know the exact number
of residences that have voted on the issue, let alone their
votes on the matter. According to Salomon Varela, co
chair of MECh A and a senior. Res Ed's ignorance on the
issue indicates "their lack of commitment on the issue."
The Res Ed office currently gives all resident assis
tants a grape policy discussion guide at the beginning of
the year and has three videos on the grapes boycott avail
able for dorms to use.
According to Varela. the resulting education is incon
sistent. if it exists at all.
"There are some dorms w ho are not voting and resi
dents are not educated on the issue," he said. "We'd like
to see them be committed on the issue."
In addition to inconsistencies in education, the actual
job of providing grapes education has often fallen on the
Chicano / Latino community. Somewhere between 15 to
20 students, comprised largely of members of MEChA.
put on grapes boycott presentations for 10 to 15 dormi
tories this year.
"It's up to a few students who are left with the burden
of educating the entire campus," Varela said.
Now. members of the Chicano / Latino community
hope the committee will make grapes boycott education
more of a campus-wide concern.
"The issues farm workers face — low wages or the use
of pesticides — all are something that needs the ongoing
attention of everyone, especially Californians because
California is a leading agricultural center in the world,"
said Frances Morales, director of
El Centro Chicano.
"When the movement is driven
with all Stanford student con
stituencies. it makes grapes educa
tion a more viable and systematic
program."
"The new committee is going to
enhance learning about the issue
and more fully support the expec
tations set forth by the president
and the provost in their response
to the Grape Policy Committee."
Wais said.
