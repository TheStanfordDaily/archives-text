# Trial begins for former apartheid president
## Botha may have authorized killing of anti-apartheid activists in 1995

GEORGE, South Africa (AP) — South
Africa's past confronted its present yesterday
when apartheid-era President P.W. Botha — still
defiant in his beliefs — appeared before a black
judge on charges of refusing to cooperate with
the national Truth and Reconciliation Commis
sion.
At the trial's start yesterday, Botha learned
that some of his defiance was in vain: His court
case is going to delve into his actions as South
Africa's last hard-line apartheid president —just
as a Truth Commission hearing would have done.
Botha, 82. sat stone-faced as prosecutors pre
sented a barrage of evidence that the State Secu
rity Council he headed in the 1980s may have
authorized the killing of anti-apartheid activists.
But during a break in proceedings, he spoke
defiantly to the reporters who took up most of
the public gallery.
"Even if they destroy me, they cannot destroy
my soul and my convictions," said the man once
called the "Big Crocodile" for his inflexible lead
ership style.
The case before black magistrate Victor Luga
ju highlights racial divisions in South Africa after

the nation's first all-race election in 1994 ended
white minority rule.
The commission was created by President
Nelson Mandela's government to uncover
apartheid-era crimes. Botha has called it a circus
and vowed he would never testify before it in per
son.
His intransigence has made him a rallying
point for right-wingers who consider the commis
sion biased against whites, especially Afrikaners,
the Dutch-descended white settlers who ruled
during apartheid.
"In his view we have done nothing but humil
iate his people," said Desmond Tutu, the retired
Anglican archbishop who won the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid activities. "1
don't think anything we try to say or do would
move him from that position."
Botha's intransigence also has become a cru
cial test of the Truth Commission's credibility
with many blacks, who believe apartheid leaders
are getting off easy while black leaders such as
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Mandela's former
wife, had lengthy public hearings.
Botha, 82. was head of state from 1978 to

IMSy. when Mandela was in prison for his efforts
to end racial segregation.
Botha faces contempt charges for ignoring
several Truth Commission subpoenas to appear
in person at a hearing last year on his role in the
State Security Council. If convicted, he could
receive up to two years in prison and an unspeci
fied fine.
Botha appeared jovial as he entered the court
room yesterday, giving a mock salute to prosecu
tor Bruce Morrison and shaking hands with Tutu,
the Truth Commission chairman who is his
adversary in the trial.
The trial was supposed to begin Tuesday, but
Botha's lawyers asked for a postponement to try
to work out a deal in whieh the former president
would testify at a private hearing before the com
mission in exchange for dismissal of the charges.
But Botha scuttled the deal yesterday, missing
a chance to have any incriminating or damaging
information about him kept private.
Now the evidence before the commission on
Botha's role with the State Security Council will
be part of the legal battle conducted before the
world's media.
