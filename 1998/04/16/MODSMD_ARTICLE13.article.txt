Lagunita Dining Hall

THE CAPITAL Improvement
Plan renovations for Lagunita
Court are under wav accord
ing to schedule. Amid the noise and
rubble by the deep lake-side trench
,es. Lagunita Dining Hall stands shin
ing in almost full service â€” the prod
uct of yearlong negotiations between
Lagunita resident fellows and the
University.
A year ago, the original plan to
hhut down dining hall operations for
4he entire spring quarter was met
with disgruntlement. Since board
costs are non-refundable, approxi
mately 400 residents would have had
to go to Roble Hall. Florence Moore
Hall or Ricker Dining for all meals.
However. RFs promptly protested
Stating that lack of a centralized din
ing area would harm the sense of
dorm community.
As a result of the RF initiative and
the cooperation of Housing and Din
ing Services, the dining hall is
presently in service and operating
smoothly even with limited
resources.
Dining Services is doing its best to
respond to residents' concerns and
needs. Because the kitchen and the
side wings of the dining hall are now

closed. Dining Services employees
have been carting food to Lagunita
from Wilbur Dining Hall.
In addition to Wilbur entrees. Din
ing Services has added an outdoor
grill. A barbecue is held at every
meal. Juice machines, serveries and
furniture have all been rearranged to
fit in the limited space indoors. Extra
picnic tables were set up in the court
yard during finals week. Many stu
dents even claim that the food tastes
better.
Throughout this transition, Dining
Services has kept all residents
informed of the changes and has reg
ularly solicited input. This was done
through fliers detailing construction
information and discussing student
concerns questions.
In addition to directly addressing
the need for food to be served in
Lagunita, Dining Services has
responded to students' environmen
tal concerns by reissuing another
batch of large, plastic University din
ing mugs. Currently, residents eat off
paper plates and disposable plastic
utensils. However, plans are in the
works to use washable plastic dish
wear as soon as possible.
The positive result of negotiations
with Dining Services shows what
could be done with a certain amount
of initiative, communication and
cooperation. We commend Dining
Services for quickly responding to
and going out of its way to address
residents' concerns.
