Cast your vote for Norton
I don't expect to agree with The Daily's
1 indorsements, in fact, I often haven't. But
I do expect them to be factually accurate.
,l The idea that Matt Spence '"knows
ASSU protocol and bureaucracy better
than any of his opponents" is simply
untenable.
Anyone remotely involved with the
ASSU in the past two years knows that
Alaren Norton does most of the work.
She's carried the ASSU on her back for
her whole tenure — doing the important,
but unglamorous work when the politicos
ducked out to do meaningless but high
profile drivel.
For two years. Norton has co-chaired
both the senate's Appropriations and
' Budget and Finance Committees.
As such, she's the main liaison for stu
dent group and ASSU money. She's run
both the general fee and special processes
both years, helping innumerable student
"groups navigate the often complicated
ASSU funding system.
She sat on the search committee for
almost every position filled in these years
. She authored the umbrella group bill
which allowed collectives like the
Women's Center, Asian American Stu
dents Association, Black Student Union.
Stanford American Indian Organization
and MEChA to apply for special fees. She
drafted the ASSU budget for this year.

Maren Norton has never missed or left
a meeting early in two years.
Everyone — from student group trea
surers to fellow senators to those hoping
the ASSU will notice their issue — goes to
Norton for help and advice because no
one knows the ASSU better or is more
fair.
For two years Norton has been the
hardest working, most indispensable
member of the senate.
The Daily can "vote" for who it choos
es, but it shouldn't misrepresent the facts.

Possible change to coed
IM soccer scoring
In response to The Daily's editorial
entitled "Unwarranted Aid" (April 13),
the Intramurals Department will be con
ducting a survey concerning scoring in
coed IM soccer.
As the editorial stated, coed IM soccer
rules currently assign 1.5 points to goals
scored by females and 1 point to those
scored by males.
This rule was created before any of the
current IM staff worked with the depart
ment.
However, in no way do we feel that this
regulation is intended to be patronizing or

represents a lack of devotion to equality
between the sexes in IM athletics.
To ensure the equal and fair treatment
of IM athletes, we will he conducting a
survey April 25-26 to determine whether
or not to alter this rule.
All IM coed soccer participants will be
asked to indicate their preference: change
the rule to 1 point per goal for all athletes,
or to leave the rule as currently followed.
Results will be reviewed in three cate
gories: women's votes, men's votes and
combined.
The female consensus will be the decid
ing factor in the event of any discontinuity
in the results.
Our primary goal is to meet the desires
and expectation of those who the rules
most directly concern — women. Any
changes to the rule will be implemented
immediately.
We hope that this action will end any
controversy about the IM Department's
stance on the role of female athletes.
In addition to this survey, the over
whelming number of female IM staff
members should convince any concerned
individual that the female athlete is prop
erly represented in the department.
Currently, five of the top six positions
in the department are filled by women,
including two of three student directors
and all three spring sport league commis
sioners.
We welcome any other suggestions or

questions. Contact the IM Department
directly at 723-1081 or email Carmen
Babb at cbbabbb@leland.

Solar Car is on track
Contrary to The Daily's evaluation, the
Stanford Solar Car Project has met its
goals. We recently placed third in a field of
36 cars in Sunrayce, better than all our
past attempts.
We also placed fifth in the FIA Solar
Cup in Japan.
Our goal for the summer was to race,
and we raced.
Furthermore, our expressed plan for
this school year was to design a new car
for the next race, which is still 14 months
away, in June 1999. Right now, we're
drawing pictures and gathering materials.
A roll of Kevlar cloth for the new canopy
arrived on Friday.
Our goal for the year is to design a new
car, and we're doing it.
The Daily criticizes us for holding onto
our money this year.
We're still designing the car. If we had
already spent all our money for the year,
seven months into a 21 -month project,
that would be a financial travesty. I view

our conservative spending as a sign of our
prudence — a reason for more funding,
not less.
The Daily's observation of our low
membership during the design phase of
the project is accurate, but that's how it
should be.
Over the last decade, membership has
always waned after races, and then risen
again as we approached race time, when
there is more work to do.
As for the Daily's suggestions that
"next year's funding would more produc
tively spent recruiting members, making
long-term plans, and soliciting donations,"
I can't imagine what they mean. Spend
$3(),(MX) on phone calls and posters?
Please, don't impose a nine-month
timeline on a 21 -month project.
The Daily risks crippling the most
extensive student-run engineering oppor
tunity available to the Stanford students,
graduate or undergraduate.
