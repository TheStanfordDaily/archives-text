## Nostalgia for the best years of life 
### 
SOME PEOPLE say
that your college
years are the best
years of your life. Of
course, they're probably
closely related to the
same people who say that
your high school years
are the best vears of your

life, and you know how true that is. I
mean, how can you possibly make such a
statement if you can't compare it to the
rest of your life?
But now that my departure from Stan
ford is just around the corner, I've been
thinking about my high school graduation.
Maybe there's something to be said about
misplaced nostalgia after all.
Enough time has elapsed so 1 can actu
ally feel a fondness for those high school
years; for people in neon and sweatbands
and hair-sprayed bangs, for Madonna
wannabes and drum machines. For when
the poster boy for preteen lust was Johnny
Depp, and Leonardo DiCaprio really was
the age he looks like he is now — 12.
But wait, all that was going on when I
was in elementary school. Like most of us
who are graduating this spring, my high
school years were in the early '90s. The
trouble is, I can't remember anything sig
nificant about them. I feel they should
have been in the '80s instead. Call me
brainwashed by movies like "The Wed

ding Singer," "Grosse Pointe Blank" and
"Romy and Michele's High School
Reunion."
You've heard how the pop culture crit
ics say that the '80s are now what the '70s
and '60s were for older generations. It's a
phenomenon that's gone beyond the
"Classics of the '80s" CDs advertised on
television at 3 a.m. The '80s have become
a cultural touchstone, something you've
experienced even though you weren't
there or were simply too young to remem
ber. Maybe even something that's more
fun to pretend you remembered.
My high school years have suddenly
become those of John Hughes teens before
they realized they were suffering from
angst. My best friend was of the opposite
sex, and 1 was secretly in love with him. Of
course, he had a crush on someone from the
other side of the tracks. Amid romantic
confusion, 1 would have given anything to
have met a Lloyd Dobler. (Never mind the
fact that I saw "Say Anything" for the first
time last year.)
Everyone at my school could fit more
or less neatly into one of the five character
stereotypes from"The Breakfast Club."
(If 1 had known anything about math or
chess I would have been the nerd. Other
wise, I would have been the basket case.)
The one missing stereotype was what
my school referred to as a Weird Drama
Person, the gloom-and-doom flipside to

Day-Glo and Debbie Gibson. 1 was disap
pointed when I went to a Cure concert a
couple of years ago, and everyone looked
like they would have been equally stoked
to see Hootie and the Blowfish. Where
have all the Weird Drama People gone?
What do they become when they grow up?
An aging Weird Drama Person is proba
bly even sadder than an aging hippie
(although s/he will look scarier). I miss sit
ting in history class with three Robert
Smith clones.
At a recent party, I was reminded of a
song by The Smiths: "There's a club, if
you'd like to go / you could meet some
body who really loves you / so you go, and
you stand on your own / and you leave on
your own/ and go home, and you cry / and
you want to die."
What a perfect song for trying to meet
people in the '90s. It might make more
sense now. because how many of you were
old enough to go to clubs 12 years ago
when that song first came out?
By the time I get to go to my 10-year
high school reunion, the '90s just may
have gotten its own era treatment. I only
hope that it won't be something like "Bev
erly Hills, 90210." You could never feel
nostalgic for that, not in a million years.

Heaven knows Wendy Lee, a senior major
ing in modern thought and literature, is mis
erable now.
