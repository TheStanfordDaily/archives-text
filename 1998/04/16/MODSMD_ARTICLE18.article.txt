an athlete to compete at the na

■ Today through Saturday: Sopho
more Larissa Fontaine competes in
the NCAA Championships in Los
Angeles.

Sophomore gymnast Larissa
Fontaine will he doing just that
today when she vies for a national
championship on the vault —
solo.
The sophomore qualified for
the national meet in the vault after
she scored a 9.975 at the Western
Regional gymnastics meet, good
enough for first place.
However, she will travel to
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion alone —
her team finished third and failed
to make the cut by only four-tenths
of a point.
"It will he hard watching know
ing we belong there as a team."
Fontaine said.
"But it will be motivating to
know where we can be next year if
we work hard."
Fontaine is competing this
morning in the same rotation as
Brigham Young University.
She will warm up with the

Cougars and wait through a series
of performances before her turn.
If her score is among the top
four in her session, she will ad
vance to the final meet Saturday
afternoon.
Because competition is at such a
high level, the top four gymnasts
who advance usually have identi
cal scores or are within one-tenth
of a point of each other.
"Basically, 1 have to do a really
good vault," Fontaine said.
Fontaine is up against the best
in the country; performing in her
session are national powers Geor-
