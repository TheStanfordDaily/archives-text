It's nerve-wracking enough for
an athlete to compete at the na
tional championships.
But it's even harder without the
support of your teammates.

WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS

■ Today through Saturday: Sopho
more Larissa Fontaine competes in
the NCAA Championships in Los
Angeles.

Sophomore gymnast Larissa
Fontaine will he doing just that
today when she vies for a national
championship on the vault —
solo.
The sophomore qualified for
the national meet in the vault after
she scored a 9.975 at the Western
Regional gymnastics meet, good
enough for first place.
However, she will travel to
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion alone —
her team finished third and failed
to make the cut by only four-tenths
of a point.
"It will he hard watching know
ing we belong there as a team."
Fontaine said.
"But it will be motivating to
know where we can be next year if
we work hard."
Fontaine is competing this
morning in the same rotation as
Brigham Young University.
She will warm up with the

Cougars and wait through a series
of performances before her turn.
If her score is among the top
four in her session, she will ad
vance to the final meet Saturday
afternoon.
Because competition is at such a
high level, the top four gymnasts
who advance usually have identi
cal scores or are within one-tenth
of a point of each other.
"Basically, 1 have to do a really
good vault," Fontaine said.
Fontaine is up against the best
in the country; performing in her
session are national powers Geor-

gia and Michigan.
"Larissa is going down there to
make a run at the national champi
onship." head coach Mark Cook
said. "It is harder to go individual
ly. and it's upsetting the team
didn't make it. But she has a
chance."
Fontaine has been successful
with her "Yurchenko Arabian lay
out front" vault all year and will
perform it today.
However, if she advances to Sat
urday's competition, she is re
quired to perform two different
vaults so she will also do a "hand
spring pike front" vault.
Cook expects Fontaine to hit
her vaults cleanly and will "see
where it will take her."
"I'm ready," Fontaine said.
"I've been training for this all year,
and I just have to do the same thing
I've been doing."
Senior Clarence Miao from the
men's squad also qualified for na

tionals for the vault.
However, Miao has decided not
to attend.
Miao didn't compete all year
until the Pacific-10 Conference
meet due to a wrist injury that had
kept him out for the entire season.
He decided to compete at re
gionals for the sake of his team and
was surprised he made it after
being injured for so long.
Although Miao said he was
happy he made it, the risk of fur
ther injuring his wrist wasn't worth
continuing in competition.
"I was honored I made it,"he
said.
"It was a hard decision to make
considering I was a senior and I
wanted to finish as an All-Ameri
can again. But it is more important
to stay healthy."
