# Senate explores ideas for attracting and retaining women, minorities
## Medical faculty seek more diversity 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
The challenges on the road ahead lor
the School of Medicine lie in diversifying
the gender and ethnicity of its faculty and
students, professors agreed yesterday at a
meeting of the school's Faculty Senate.
The school's admissions committee re
ported on its proposals for new programs
that would draw in more minority appli
cants and to convince those who do apply
and are accepted, to attend Stanford.
Non-minority applicants, too. sometimes
choose other schools above Stanford he
cause of financial aid considerations.
Assoc. Gastroenterology Prof. Gabriel
Garcia noted.
Professors joked that eliminating I lar
vard I Jniversity and the I JniversityofCal
ifornia from the pool of available schools
would be the most effective route for im
proving Stanford's yield rate. But Garcia,
who is replacing Radiology Prof. Emeri
tus Norm Blank as the head of the admis

sions committee, had several more practi
cal solutions.
With the charge to "ensure that the
high quality and diversity of our students
is maintained." (iarcia said he and a com
mittee worked to devise ways to avoid the
negative affects of California's Proposi
tion 209.
Passed in the November 19% election,
the proposition — called the California
Civil Rights Initiative called for the
elimination of affirmative action practices
in hiring, admissions and other arena.
Although the proposition remains
mired in legal battles and does not affect
private institutions such as Stanford, it
may be pushing away prospective minor
ity students, said senate chair Ken Mel
mon, a professor of medicine.
"We're very worried about the impact
of what 209 has done — that messages
that are coming out of C 'alifornia are mis
interpreted." Melmon said. "The real
issue is that there's no room for loss of di
versity in our student bodv."

Schools within the University of ( all
fornia system have experienced severe
decreases in the numbers of minority stu
dents applying, accepted and matriculat
ing.
Students considering Stanford Med
ical School are awash in misinformation,
according to Multieultural Development
Office Director Sally Dickson, who at
tended the senate meeting to brief pr< >fes
sors on legal issues that might impact their
decisions about how to attract more mi
norities.
Aside from perception. Stanford will
be affected by having fewer minority stu
dents graduating from I niversity ofC 'ali
fornia campuses, which act as feeder
schools for Stanford's graduate schools.
Dickson added.
"If that applicant pool is shrinking, it
will affect us as we approach the tough
issue of recruiting." she said.
Garcia's plans included establishing an
alumni database, establishing contacts at
Stanford and other universities who

would identify prospective* applicants to
be recruited, and improving Stanford's fi
nancial aid offers. I he Medical School is
working to increase its aid — in the form
<>112 l(>ans and grants to 80 percent of stu
dents' need.
Although issues remain to he solved.
Blank pointed out that Stanford does well
in terms of recruitment and retention of
minority and female students as com
pared to 12 other schools with which it is
part of a consortium. Last year, underrep
resented minorities made up 1K percent of
admitted students: 12 percent of those
students matriculated, making Stanford
about average.
Women made up 56 percent of the stu
dents admitted at the top of the schools in
the consortium.
Hut Stanford still lags behind in re
cruitment ;uid retention of female faculty
members, said Psychiatry Prof. David
Spiegel, presenting a report from the
school's Council on Diversity. The
senate will continue discussion of the
status of women at its May meeting.
Statistics compiled by the council
show that women made up 12 per
cent of the total Medical School fac
ulty in I W() and 20 percent in 19%.
However, women are dispropor
tionately hired for non-tenure line
and lower-ranking positions, leaving
them underpaid as well as underrep
resented in the higher ranks, Spiegel
said.
fie suggested that the disparity
might be rectified by having depart
ments develop hiring plans and by
having department chairs and deans
review searches to assure the appli
cant pool is diverse.
