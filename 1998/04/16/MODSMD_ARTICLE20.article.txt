# Schrager at home on Farm
## Junior hopes for another homecoming in Omaha 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
Tony Schrager knew it wouldn't he easy to make
the transition from an unranked Yale team to the No.
I Cardinal.
But the junior has proven his cross-country move
was worth it.
Called the surprise of the 1997 season after trans
ferring from Yale to earn a starting spot on the No. 1
Cardinal squad (30-6-1), Schrager has become a per

manent defensive fixture at second base and a forceful
hitter at the plate.
"He's really made the difference for us defensive
ly." Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said. "He
and [senior shortstop Jay Pecci] I think are one of the
best double-play combinations in the country and
[Schrager's] got power. He's just a good solid player
for us. so we're real fortunate we got him."
While at Yale his freshman year. Schrager ap
peared in 33 Bulldogs games. Despite suffering a torn
quad, he made 28 starts while tallying 17 RBls at the
plate.
"I just felt like at that time that that was the place
that I really fit in." Schrager said. "I felt really com
fortable with the coaches and the guvs on the team."
However, at the conclusion of the 19% season.
Schrager made the coastal leap.
"The main reason I transferred was for baseball."
Schrager said. "Yale's baseball program isn't what it is
here in terms of the intensity. We practice really year
round. and this is what I was really looking for in terms
of a baseball program."
He knew, however, that a difficult road lay ahead.
The coaches "were open with me with having to
come in and win a job," Schrager said. "But at the same
time, they said I'd be given the same opportunity as
anyone else."
Since that time, Schrager's stats have been on a
steady rise. As a sophomore last season, the second
baseman hit .289 with seven homers and IS RBI in 4(t
games, including 35 starts.
At the College World Series, the Omaha native tal
lied an .333 average, three runs, and two RBI.
"That was a dream come true really." Schrager said
of his return home. "I grew up watching the World Se
ries every year. We had season tickets, so we'd go to as
many games as possible. To actually be able to partic
ipate was sort of indescribable."
And judging by his contributions on the current
season, a return trip could be possible.
Named the Pacific-10 Conference Southern Divi
sion Baseball Player of the Week for Feb. 23. Schrager
hit .S(X) with seven runs scored, one double, three
homeruns and nine RBIs to lead the top-ranked Car
dinal to three road victories that week.
Schrager's goal for this year \\ inning the ('ollege
World Series — remains a couple months away.
"I think we have a great shot at getting back there,
but once we do. we know that we really expect to go
farther than we did last year." Schrager said. "For a lot
of the juniors here, there's a lot of guys that are going
to get drafted off this team, and they realize that this
could be their last shot at a national championship."
Schrager hopes to be one of those juniors with a
major league option come June.
"It's always been my dream to play baseball — to
play in the major leagues." Schrager said. "It would be
a dream come true to have that opportunity.
