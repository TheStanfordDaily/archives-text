# NCAA instates new safety rules
## 
### Evan Meagher Staff writer 
The NCAA has issued a second
set of recommendations designed
to regulate weight-cutting in colle
giate wrestling.
After the deaths of three
wrestlers earlier this year, the
NCAA rules committee instated
temporary rule changes. Among
the measures were a temporary 7-
pound allowance on all weight
classes and a rule locking all
wrestlers into weight classes they
had competed in on or before Jan.
7.
With the end of the season, the
rules committee and the organiza
tion's competitive safeguards com
mittee met once again.
"1 think it'll be good." Stanford
wrestling head coach Chris Horpel
said of the latest developments.
"The same people will be wrestling
each other, just at a higher weight
class."
The committee first reinforced

the recommendations implement
ed midseason. specifically discour
aging the use of unsafe weight-loss
techniques such as rubber suits,
laxatives and self-induced vomit
ing.
The University of Michigan en
acted similar measures against its
own team after junior Jeff Reese
died trying to cut 17 pounds to
qualify for the 150-pound division
before a meet against Michigan
State.
One of the most striking sugges
tions includes making a preseason
weight-assessment program
mandatory to determine the mini
mum weight at which a particular
wrestler can compete.
Similar programs in place in
Michigan and Wisconsin high
school wresting leagues take per
centage of body fat and gravity of
urine into account: they have met
with success.
Wrestlers would be given a cut
off date after which they could only
compete in weight classes they had

occupied earlier that season. The
weight-assessment program is re
peated before the second half of
the season to maximize its flexibili
ty.
"I feel it's a big step in the right
direction for the health and safety
of wrestlers at the collegiate level."
Horpel said. "Hopefully, it will
trickle both down to the high
school level and up to the interna
tional level."
Furthermore, weight classes
themselves would be adjusted, and
the usual order of matches (now
beginning with lIS pounds and
progressing through to heavy
weights) would he switched to a
random draw.
This would discourage heavy
weights from cutting weight more
drastically because they know they
have the longest to recover from
the regimen before competing.
"The way the rules are written,
there can be no extreme dehydra
tion anymore, and people will have
to compete much closer to their

natural weight once they've gotten
in shape," Horpel said.
"Once they're within 5 to H per
cent body fat, what they come in
every day and wrestle in practice at
will he their competition weight,
give or take 1 or 2 percent."
Other recommendations in
clude requiring all coaches to be
certified in CPR. banning practice
rooms with temperatures above 75
degrees and requiring weigh-ins
one hour before the first match in
dual meets.
For logistical reasons, weigh-ins
would occur two hours before the
first match on the first day of tour
naments.
On subsequent days, weigh-ins
would occur one hour before the
first match.
Allowances cannot be granted
during tournaments that last multi
ple days.
The recommendations await ap
proval by the NC AA's champi
onships committee in the next few
