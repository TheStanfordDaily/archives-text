## 
### Sage Cooke 
From April l l >-23, the Co-op Council
will be hosting Co-op Awareness Week
in order to inform the Stanford commu
nity about what it is like to live in a coop
erative house.
During the week, the co-ops will fea
ture panels in several dormitories, pro
vide information on tables in White Plaza
and host open house tours in each co-op.
The week culminates in a party spon
sored by all the co-op houses.
The panels will feature co-op mem
bers discussing their reasons for joining a
co-op, as well as their personal experi
ences as a resident in this type of house.
They will also explain how each co-op is
run and answer questions. Panels have
been planned for Roble Hall, Ujamaa
and Florence Moore Hall. One panel has
already been held in Soto.
In White Plaza, members will distrib
ute Co-op Guides, which feature infor
mation about each specific co-op, pro
vide information on co-op living and ex
plain how to get priority in the housing
draw. They will also provide samples of
their houses' food.
Each co-op will host open house tours

every evening in order to show students
the housing and atmosphere of co-op life.
The party is planned for Thursday,
April 23, and features a barbecue potluck
at Synergy at 6 p.m., followed by a party
at Chi Theta Chi at K p.m.
According to Barbie Wong, Synergy
resident assistant, the purpose of the
Awareness Week is to educate the cam
pus about co-ops. and to find the people
most suited for living in them.
The council hopes to dispel common
misconceptions that co-ops are primarily
for people who are involved in either veg
etarianism. animal rights or are "politi
cally left." Wong said.
In addition, the council wants to
demonstrate that each co-op has a dis
tinct personality. Students who are not
compatible with one co-op should not
generalize this stereotype to all the co
ops, said Samar Mehta, Columbae RA
and member of the council.
They also want to disprove the idea
that co-op houses are unclean. Ultimate
ly, they are hoping for a more "self-se
lected community," Mehta said.
The council wants to show the positive
aspects of co-op living, especially the
tight-knit community that is formed be

tween house members when they are
working together, as they cook, clean and
care for themselves.
They also want to attract co-op mem
bers so that everyone who draws into
each house will really want to live there,
rather than simply drawing in as a last re
sort. Mehta said.
The council was revived during winter
quarter after being abandoned several
years ago.
Its reinstatement was a combined ef
fort between Assoc. Residential Educa
tion Director Ann Porteus and members
of Columbae and other co-op houses,
Mehta said.
The council is open to all members of
the co-op community, but consists of 10
core members, with at least one represen
tative from each co-op.
The council has several goals, which
include developing a stronger sense of
community, reaching out to new people,
forming a Co-op Alumni Network,
archiving co-op historical documents and
continuing a positive relationship be
tween co-ops and Res Ed. Co-op Aware
ness Week is their largest initiative thus
far, although they have also released reg
ular co-op newsletters.
