The silvery tones of Gilbert and
Sullivan's comic opera "Patience" are a
fitting finale to the Stanford Savoyards'
25th anniversary season. Since 1973, the
Savoyards have brought to life the light
operas written by the English team of
Gilbert and Sullivan. The group presents
two shows each year on campus.
The Savoyards include current and
former Stanford students, faculty and
diverse members of the Bay Area and
Silicon Valley communities. A reunion
later this spring will bring past company
participants together. The group will in
clude five Nobel laureates — a claim that
can't be boasted by any other operetta
company.
This season, University President
Gerhard Casper will add his name to the
list of Savoyard alum by taking the stage
during the final performance of
"Patience" on April 25.
The 14 light operas written by Gilbert
and Sullivan in the late 1800s are known
as "The Savoy Operas," named for the
Savoy Theatre. The theater was built in
London in 1881 specifically to house the
duo's works. The term "Savoyards" de
scribes all Gilbert and Sullivan fans, and
was donned by the Stanford company in
1973.
Gilbert and Sullivan's social satire:
never too old
What keeps all these artists interested
in shows that were written well over a
century ago? Quite simply, it's the music.
The Savoy Operas are known for the fast
paced lyrics of William S. Gilbert, which
were often sarcastic spoofs of class and
social trends. The words flow — some
times in rapid fire, sometimes liltingly
fluid — on the melodies composed by
Arthur Sullivan.
"Sullivan was a brilliant music writer
who was never realized in his lifetime,"
said Oakland piano technician Matt
Callahan, who performs the role of
Colonel Calverley in "Patience." This is
Callahan's first show with the Savoyards,
although he has performed in seven
Savoy Operas with another G&S com
pany in San Francisco, The Lamplighters.
"The words are wonderful, and the sto
ries are cute and harmless," Callahan says
of Gilbert and Sullivan's continued ap
peal. "Many of the 'golden age' musicals
— Rogers and Hammerstein, Rogers and
Hart — find their roots in these shows."
Today's audiences still relate to many
of the social issues that Gilbert and
Sullivan satirized. The central theme of
"Patience" — poking fun at blind devo
tion to fads and figureheads — rings as
true today as it did one hundred years
ago.
Mandy Khoshnevisan, a sophomore
majoring in English, is singing in her sec

ond performance with the Savoyards.
According to Khshnevisan, the opera,
which critiques fad-huggers and trend
follwers, still has audience appeal.
"The topics are still relevant,"said
Khoshnevisan. "Pretentious people are
still pretentious people in any century."
A lesser-known Savoy

"Patience" is not the first show
most people name when asked
about Gilbert and Sullivan light
operas. "H.M.S. Pinafore," "The
Mikado" and"The Pirates of
Penzance" are more familiar to
musical audiences.
Nonetheless, "Patience" has
one of the better musical scores
of Gilbert and Sullivan's op
erettas, and the lightning-fast
lyrics and social commentary are
as entertaining and sarcastic as
any other Savoy show. The opera
is sometimes criticized by
Gilbert and Sullivan performers
for the fact that the male chorus
completely disappears in the sec
ond act, but the women's songs
that are featured are beautiful
and enjoyable.
Clever choreography and
staging in "Patience" also add en
ergy and depth to the show. The
voices of the talented cast do
great justice to the script and
melodies of the duo's work.
"Patience" first opened in
London on April 23, 1881 at the
Opera Comique Theatre. The

show later moved to the new Savoy
Theatre, where it continued its opening
run of 578 performances.
Following on the heels of successful
"H.M.S. Pinafore" and "Pirates of
Penzance" premieres in 1878 and 1880,
the number of performances in the ini
tial run of "Patience" exceeded that of
any other Gilbert and Sullivan operetta.
'Patience; or, Bunthorne's Bride'
Because of the fast pace of Gilbert and
Sullivan's lyrics, it helps to explain the
plot and characters beforehand.
The opera is set in the English coun
tryside and centers on two rival poets,
Reginald Bunthorne (Titus France) and
Archibald Grosvenor (Kevin Mallory).
Each has his sights set on Patience (Marti
Berg), the young village milkmaid.
The female chorus comprises the
group of "Rapturous Maidens" — a
tongue-in-cheek symbol of the "aesthetic
culture" of the 1880s. They prize all
things that are outwardly beautiful and
perfect. Lady Angela (Natausha Wilson),
Lady Saphir (Coral Sprukts) and Lady
Ella (Jocelyn Medina) lead the maidens
in their admiration of all things pleasing
to the eye.
Much to the dismay of Dragoon

Guard — the "common" men who are
portrayed by the male chorus — the gen
teel ladies favor the "literary" Bunthorne
and Grosvenor and reject the affections
of their military betrothed. None of the
guard's officers can understand what the
women are attracted to.
Patience is innocent and unschooled
in the ways of love, but learns quickly as

she watches her two poet rivals prosti
tute themselves to win her favor. She is
told that true love is unselfish, and she
evaluates her two suitors accordingly.
Grosvenor was Patience's childhood
companion and was called "Archibald the
All-Right" in acknowledgment of his
perfection. Feeling her actions must be
unselfish, she therefore chooses the
flawed, egotistical Bunthorne.
The Rapturous Maidens, who had
idolized Bunthorne, are saddened by his
pairing with Patience, and turn their at
tentions briefly back to their betrothed
soldiers. Soon, however, the aesthetically
perfect Grosvenor arrives on the scene,
and the ladies immediately shower their

fickle adoration upon him.
Bunthorne, baffled by the defection of
his female flock, is aided by Lady Jane
(Shelley Johnson) in putting a curse on
Grosvenor. It compels Mr. Ail-Right to
become a very commonplace young man.
Rather than becoming dissuaded,
however, the Rapturous Maidens also
don ordinary clothes; if Archibald is giv-

ing up aestheticism, then they will too.
Patience, still following her unselfish
notions of love, transfers her affections to
Archibald Grosvenor, for he is no longer
perfect.
Bunthorne, spurned yet again, decides
to wed the Lady Jane — his only remain
ing admirer. The Duke of Dunstable,
however, also decides to take advantage
of the new anti-aesthetic trend, and says
that since he is a very ordinary man, it is
only fair for him to choose an ordinary
lady — Lady Jane, who happily accepts
his hand.
The antagonist must find himselt
"contented" in the only way he can, for
"Nobody is Bunthorne's Bride!"
