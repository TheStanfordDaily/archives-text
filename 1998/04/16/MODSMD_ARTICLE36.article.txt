# "Prune Your Humanity" by Donna Carter
## Stanford students' digital art showcased on Caltrain 
### Jennifer Stein Contributing writer 
All aboard for Stanford's latest art exhibit. The 14 students in last quar
ter's Art 174 Digital Arts in Public Spaces class are displaying their work
on various Caltrain coaches running from Gilroy to San Francisco. The
project, entitled "Sidetracked," is the brainchild of Gregory Niemeyer, a
Stanford instructor and former Caltrain commuter.
"The train, by far the most efficient and safe form of commuting,
does not benefit from the same cultural artifacts as other forms of
transportation," Niemeyer said.
He was referring to the cell phones, traffic reports and large spaces
commuters in cars experience daily. Niemeyer and Caltrain marketing
manager Gordon Smith sought to find a way to reward Caltrain com
muters with a visual stimulus.
"You shouldn't have to go to an art gallery or concert hall for an
artistic experience that is out of the ordinary," Smith said. Now com
muters — with the help of funding from the University, Caltrain and
Hewlett Packard — will be able to view art in the mundane setting of
their routine commute.
Communications masters student Chris Jenkins focused his piece
"Cyclepath" on the importance of the bike car. He collaborated with
teaching assistant Julie Stevens in an effort to draw attention to the im
portance of commuting by bike. It is not only environmentally sound
but also fosters communication among Caltrain passengers, as they
must stack their bicycles according to their respective destinations.
"Nutrition Condition" by senior Jenny Tran integrates the concept of
American fast food with Asian culinary images. Tran considers her piece to
be a success because two of her panels had already been stolen from the
train after having been on display only one week. She saw this as a positive
sign because this meant people were having a strong reaction to her work.
Junior Jonathan Bailey's "22 Molotov" piece was also the subject of a
bit of controversy, as those who returned the viewer response portion
of the "Sidetracked" brochure felt that the piece made them feel unsafe
and had a sense of danger to it. The piece depicts the 22nd Street sta
tion in San Francisco.
Bailey said that he hopes the work will "create a dialogue about what
it means to live in a city, be scared or want a good life."
Students were allowed to create designs as long as they conformed
with a few guidelines. No work could encourage any sort of dangerous
actions or behaviors that violate Caltrain rules.
Sophomore David Scheine had his first submission, a narrative on
the role of technology, rejected because Caltrain's officials felt it was of
fensive in its use of religious imagery. Instead, Scheme's piece now fo
cuses on manipulating images seen in and around the Palo Alto
Caltrain station.
According to Scheine, the challenge of the assignment "was making
it look like it wasn't an effort. Digital art is often criticized as it looks as
if there was no effort put into it, but that is actually the mark of doing
digital art well."
Other works include a closer look at Bay Meadows, gambling and a
love story between two commuters from Gilroy and San Francisco. No
matter which car you end up in, "Sidetracked" ensures that the scenery
on a Caltrain commute is not limited to looking out the window.
