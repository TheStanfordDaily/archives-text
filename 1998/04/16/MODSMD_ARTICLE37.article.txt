# Warner Brothers classics
## return to the big screen 
### Rito Trevi√±o Editorial staff 
So you weren't born yet when "Casablanca" was
released in 1942. The same probably goes for "A
Clockwork Orange," which came out in 1971. And
maybe you weren't close to one of the theaters that
showed the director's cut of "Blade Runner" during
its brief rerelease in 1992.
Come next week, however, you will have little ex
cuse for never having seen these and other great
Warner Brothers movies in a theater. As part of its
75th anniversary celebration, Warner Brothers is pre
senting a "Festival of Classics," featuring 33 films from
the 1930s through the early 19905.
Tomorrow the festival will come to the Park
Theatre in Menlo Park, only minutes away from
Stanford.
The films are presented in a decade-a-day
arrangement. The more popular movies from the
70s, '80s and '90s will be played over the weekend.
The true classics will be shown during the week, be
ginning with the '30s on Monday and finishing with
the '60s on Thursday.
Among the features is the legendary film "The
Jazz Singer," which in 1927 became the first "talkie,"
or the first movie with sound. "The Adventures of
Robin Hood" (1938) stars Errol Flynn and his infa
mous tights; he's considered to be "the definitive
swashbuckler of the Golden Age of Hollywood."
Humphrey Bogart dominates the screen in"The
Maltese Falcon" (1941) and the Oscar-winning
"Casablanca" (1942). Bette Davis lights her famous
cigarette as an emotionally repressed woman in
"Now, Voyager" (1942). And in "Rebel Without a
Cause" (1955), James Dean demonstrates the hard
ships of being a teenage rebel in the role that won
earned his stardom.
If these Golden Age movies don't quite pique your
interest, there are plenty of recent "classics," starting
with Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange"
(1971), a dark, violent vision of the future. "The
Shining" (1980), another Kubrick film based on the
Stephen King novel, is a horror masterpiece starring
Jack Nicholson. "Unforgiven" (1992), a modern
Western directed by and starring Clint Eastwood,
garnered the company its latest Best Picture Oscar.
All of the movies in the "Festival of Classics" are
on brand-new prints, assuring the best possible the
ater experience. Special versions of some of the
movies will be presented, including the restored "A
Streetcar Named Desire" (1951) and the director's
cuts of "Blade Runner" (1982) and"The Wild
Bunch" (1969).
The "Festival of Classics" offers a few admission
options. Instead of paying the standard ticket price
for each movie, film buffs can purchase all-day tickets

With all of this year's hoopla on the 75th anniver
sary, one might ask, "Just who were the Warner
Brothers?" It turns out that their story is just as fairy
tale-like as any in Hollywood.
Albert, Sam, Harry and Jack Warner entered the
movie business in 1903 as traveling exhibitors. In
1907 they opened up a theater in New Castle,
Pennsylvania. Albert and Harry sold tickets, Sam ran
the hand-crank projector, and Jack, the biggest "show
man" of the four, sang during the intermissions.
After acquiring a few hundred films and opening
more theaters, the Warner brothers decided to pro
duce movies of their own. They moved to California
and began a studio in Culver City. In 1923, following
a few high-grossing movies and the opening of a
new studio on Sunset Boulevard, the Warners incor
porated their business. The rest is history.
You may not be able to catch all 31 of the classics
showing at the Park in the coming week, but you re
ally ought to see one or two of them. Go see a fa
vorite over the weekend, like "Goodfellas" or
"Blazing Saddles." More importantly, see one of the
black-and-white features on a weekday. There's
nothing like seeing a piece of filmmaking history on
the silver screen.
