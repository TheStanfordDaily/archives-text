# The 						Palo Alto
## Asia Pacific Film Festival 
### Jennifer Godwin Contributing writer 
The Palo Alto Asia Pacific Film Festival is more than a mouth
ful to say. It's a four-day traveling festival of films from six Asian
countries and Hawaii that is intended to expose Northern
Californians to contemporary Pacific Rim cinema. Asian lan
guage films aren't often released in commercial Western theaters.
The seven films will be presented by the Palo Alto Cultural
Center at Spangenberg Theatre beginning today. The screenings
are free and open to the public.
Connecting the Pacific Rim by bringing the art of Asia to
California, the seven movies all consider the modern clash between
spirituality, morality and the widespread troubles we face at the
century's end. Prostitutes consider the nature of family, ghosts
haunt unhappy apartment dwellers, citizens stare down autocratic
governments — all of these movies consider the nature of human-

ity through the unique per
spective of Asian filmmakers.
When asked to comment
on the festival's depiction of
the various parts of the Pacific
Rim, Cultural Center Director
Linda Craighead said, "The
festival is really intended to be
educational and a forum for
communication and discus
sion. Every year it's a little dif
ferent. It's intended to connect
the Asian and non-Asian pop
ulations."
Selected and sent on tour
by the Asia Pacific Media
Center at the USCand the
Network for the Promotion of
Asian Cinema, the films hail

from Korea, Japan, Thailand,
Singapore, India and the Philippines.

Greater understanding of the films will be promoted by dis
cussion panels of local film authorities and leaders of Asian-
American cultural groups.
"We intend to discuss both the films and their countries of
origin," Craighead said. "We have people with backgrounds in
cultural anthropology, comparative literature, lots of fields. The
panelists will each give a very brief presentation, and then we'll
turn it over to questions."
The festival is organized and presented by the Palo Alto
Cultural Center, the UNA Midpeninsula, and Neighbors Abroad,
an organization that develops relationships with Palo Alto's sis
ter cities. Funding was provided by the San Jose Mercury News.
The seven films of the festival will each be shown twice, with
the exception of the Hawaiian film, "Words, Earth & Aloha: The
Source of Hawaiian Music," which will close the show on Sunday,
April 19, at 7 p.m.
"The Red Door," India (1996, 95 minutes)
The Indian title of this film set in Calcutta is "Lai Darja" (now
you can say red and door in Bengali!). The film tells the tale of a
dentist named Nabin Datta who is dissatisfied with his life. He
has a recurring dream in which his childhood is revisited and he
is content with everyday pleasures and his environment. The
dream leads him to his chauffeur, whom he has ignored and
taken for granted. Datta recognizes that his driver is satisfied
with his life and happy, and his observations about what the dri
ver is doing right lead him to a more free-spirited and substan
tive life. This is a film by Buddhadeb Dasgupta, who is also a poet
with six volumes of published verse. "The Red Door" won the
1997 National Film Award, India's top film prize.
"Twelve Storeys," Singapore (1997, 100 minutes)
This film tells the parallel stories of three families connected to
each other by visits from the ghost of a man who committed sui
cide by jumping from his building. Described as "very funny and
at other times emotional and explosive," the film considers life in
the high-rise blocks in which about 85 percent of the
Singaporean population resides. Calm on the exterior, emotional
and desperate on the interior, the film "casts a cold look at life un
der the roofs of Housing and Development Board flats," accord

ing to a synopsis released by the festival. Directed by Eric Khoo,
the film was an official selection at the what year ? Cannes Film
Festival.
"A Single Spark," Korea (1996, 92 minutes)
This is a powerful and poignant rendering of the chaos and
perpetual disturbances of private and personal life under a dic
tatorship. The film depicts life in Korea under that country's mil
itary rulers by juxtaposing an intellectual in 1975 with his sub
ject, Chon T'ae-il, a labor union martyr who immolated himself
at the age of 22 in protest. The biographer's attempts to under
stand the life of his subject are the core of the film. This film is
considered particularly sensitive in its telling of the relationship
between the United States and Korea and the complicity of the
United States in the daily oppression that accompanied Korea's
famous economic miracle. This film was directed by Park
Kwang-su, who has been recognized widely as one of the leaders
of Korea's new wave.

"Deep River," Japan
(1995, 130 minutes)
Known as "Fukai
Kawa" in Japanese
(there's two more vocab
ulary words for you) this
film directed by Kei
Kamai is based on the
novel of the same name
by Shusanku Endo. In
this picture, three gener
ations of Japanese
tourists journey to India
— in particular Varansi
and the banks of the
Ganga river. They seek
deliverance and a har
mony that feels unavail-

le to them at home. The first generation of travelers is haunted
by memories of World War 11, while the post-war generation
mourns the social compromises it has made. The youngest gen
eration, the present one, feels an inexplicable unhappiness that
develops in reaction to the surrounding preoccupation with pos
sessions. The film was voted "audience's choice" at the 1997
Hawaii International Film Festival.
"Fun, Bar, Karaoke," Thailand (1997, 98 minutes)
Bangkok is the setting in which Pu, a young rebel, meets a for
tune-teller who predicts that Pu's father will die when Pu com
pletes a recurring dream. Pu's father frequents a karaoke bar where
he is involved with a hostess who is also the mistress of a Chinese
mafioso. As it goes in movies, he is warned to stay away from her,
but he refuses and is beaten. Meanwhile, Pu starts a passionate
love affair with Noi, a half-Thai, half-American gangster who
dreams of emigrating to the United States at any cost. A consider
ation of the coexistence of modernity and superstition, "Fun, Bar,
Karaoke" is director Penek Ratanaruang's first feature film.
"Milagros," Philippines (1997, 130 minutes)
"Milagros," which means "miracles" in Spanish (our last vo
cabulary word for the day), is the name of the main character.
She quits her job as a stripper in Manila to work for the
landowner to whom her late father owed large amounts of
money. Milagros attempts to bring order to the uncontrolled
lives of her family members film, which depicts family as the
center of the Filipino way of life. According to the festival,
" 'Milagros' charts the passage of a family from a time of relative
innocence toward a time when nothing can ever be the same."
The film was directed by Marilou Diaz-Abaya from a script writ
ten 10 years ago by the late playwright and poet Roland S. Tinio.
The Palo Alto Asia Pacific Film Festival will round out its
weekend of screenings with a presentation of "Words, Earth &
Aloha: The Source of Hawaiian Music," which recognizes and
honors the particular Hawaiian relationship between music, na
ture and life. The 58-minute documentary tells of the origins
and early evolution of Hawaii's rich musical tradition. The film
will be preceded with live Hawaiian music by composer Eddie
Kamae and musician Claybourne "Smitty" Smith.

The seven films of the festival will each be shown twice, with
the exception of the Hawaiian film, "Words, Earth & Aloha: The
Source of Hawaiian Music," which will close the show on Sunday,
April 19, at 7 p.m.
"The Red Door," India (1996, 95 minutes)
The Indian title of this film set in Calcutta is "Lai Darja" (now
you can say red and door in Bengali!). The film tells the tale of a
dentist named Nabin Datta who is dissatisfied with his life. He
has a recurring dream in which his childhood is revisited and he
is content with everyday pleasures and his environment. The
dream leads him to his chauffeur, whom he has ignored and
taken for granted. Datta recognizes that his driver is satisfied
with his life and happy, and his observations about what the dri
ver is doing right lead him to a more free-spirited and substan
tive life. This is a film by Buddhadeb Dasgupta, who is also a poet
with six volumes of published verse. "The Red Door" won the
1997 National Film Award, India's top film prize.
"Twelve Storeys," Singapore (1997, 100 minutes)
This film tells the parallel stories of three families connected to
each other by visits from the ghost of a man who committed sui
cide by jumping from his building. Described as "very funny and
at other times emotional and explosive," the film considers life in
the high-rise blocks in which about 85 percent of the
Singaporean population resides. Calm on the exterior, emotional
and desperate on the interior, the film "casts a cold look at life un
der the roofs of Housing and Development Board flats," accord

ing to a synopsis released by the festival. Directed by Eric Khoo,
the film was an official selection at the what year ? Cannes Film
Festival.
"A Single Spark," Korea (1996, 92 minutes)
This is a powerful and poignant rendering of the chaos and
perpetual disturbances of private and personal life under a dic
tatorship. The film depicts life in Korea under that country's mil
itary rulers by juxtaposing an intellectual in 1975 with his sub
ject, Chon T'ae-il, a labor union martyr who immolated himself
at the age of 22 in protest. The biographer's attempts to under
stand the life of his subject are the core of the film. This film is
considered particularly sensitive in its telling of the relationship
between the United States and Korea and the complicity of the
United States in the daily oppression that accompanied Korea's
famous economic miracle. This film was directed by Park
Kwang-su, who has been recognized widely as one of the leaders
of Korea's new wave.

"Deep River," Japan
(1995, 130 minutes)
Known as "Fukai
Kawa" in Japanese
(there's two more vocab
ulary words for you) this
film directed by Kei
Kamai is based on the
novel of the same name
by Shusanku Endo. In
this picture, three gener
ations of Japanese
tourists journey to India
— in particular Varansi
and the banks of the
Ganga river. They seek
deliverance and a har
mony that feels unavail-

le to them at home. The first generation of travelers is haunted
by memories of World War 11, while the post-war generation
mourns the social compromises it has made. The youngest gen
eration, the present one, feels an inexplicable unhappiness that
develops in reaction to the surrounding preoccupation with pos
sessions. The film was voted "audience's choice" at the 1997
Hawaii International Film Festival.
"Fun, Bar, Karaoke," Thailand (1997, 98 minutes)
Bangkok is the setting in which Pu, a young rebel, meets a for
tune-teller who predicts that Pu's father will die when Pu com
pletes a recurring dream. Pu's father frequents a karaoke bar where
he is involved with a hostess who is also the mistress of a Chinese
mafioso. As it goes in movies, he is warned to stay away from her,
but he refuses and is beaten. Meanwhile, Pu starts a passionate
love affair with Noi, a half-Thai, half-American gangster who
dreams of emigrating to the United States at any cost. A consider
ation of the coexistence of modernity and superstition, "Fun, Bar,
Karaoke" is director Penek Ratanaruang's first feature film.
"Milagros," Philippines (1997, 130 minutes)
"Milagros," which means "miracles" in Spanish (our last vo
cabulary word for the day), is the name of the main character.
She quits her job as a stripper in Manila to work for the
landowner to whom her late father owed large amounts of
money. Milagros attempts to bring order to the uncontrolled
lives of her family members film, which depicts family as the
center of the Filipino way of life. According to the festival,
" 'Milagros' charts the passage of a family from a time of relative
innocence toward a time when nothing can ever be the same."
The film was directed by Marilou Diaz-Abaya from a script writ
ten 10 years ago by the late playwright and poet Roland S. Tinio.
The Palo Alto Asia Pacific Film Festival will round out its
weekend of screenings with a presentation of "Words, Earth &
Aloha: The Source of Hawaiian Music," which recognizes and
honors the particular Hawaiian relationship between music, na
ture and life. The 58-minute documentary tells of the origins
and early evolution of Hawaii's rich musical tradition. The film
will be preceded with live Hawaiian music by composer Eddie
Kamae and musician Claybourne "Smitty" Smith.
