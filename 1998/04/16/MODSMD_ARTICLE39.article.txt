## Before Spike Lee... Don't let anyone tell you that we didn't start making movies until Spike.' 
### Maxine Hurt Contributing writer 
Black filmmaking did not begin with John Singleton
and Spike Lee. For nearly 100 years, blacks and filmmak
ing have strolled together through history. In fact, they've
been inseparable since motion picture technology was
invented at the end of the 19th century.
Film history textbooks devoted to the history of film
usually recount the lives of filmmakers like D.W. Griffith,
George Melies and brothers August and Louis Lumiere.
But they fail to recognize the accomplishments of darker
faces that also sat in the director's chair.
Friday, independent filmmaker Pamela Thomas is
coming to Stanford to pick up where textbooks have of
ten fallen silent. She is coming to inform the Stanford
public that, "blacks have been making movies since mak
ing movies began." She is also living proof that although
the majority of the filmmaking industry white males
make up, there is a growing number of black female film
makers making a space for themselves.
Thomas, a 1982 film and media studies graduate of
the University of Cincinnati, was not always passionate
about filmmaking. She's also nurtured a love for fashion
design and animation. While taking a photojournalism

class in college, she developed an interest in
motion pictures when she decided she wanted
to "see the still pictures move."
Not one of Thomas' college professors ever
acknowledged the black presence in film his
tory. Ignorant of any gaps in her film history
education, Thomas assumed that if the topic
was not addressed, it must not exist.
She was wrong.
One cold, New England afternoon years after
she graduated, Thomas dropped in on a lecture
at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. She would
never be the same again. The lecture changed
her life from then on.

"When I left the lecture, I was hot. My emotions went
trom shock to confusion to anger, which quickly gave
way to curiosity."
Thomas learned that her education had failed her in
the one area where she needed it most. But instead of
shaking her fist and damning the higher powers, she de
cided to do someting positive, by creating an historic
documentary.
"Midnight Ramble: Oscar Micheaux and the Story of
Race Movies" explores the people and circumstances that
sustained "race movies," films made by blacks for blacks
between 1910 and the end of World War 11. The film
screenings were called "midnight rambles" because they
were held after normal business hours in segregated
movie houses.
When film as a medium was created, the black com
munity seized the opportunity to use this new technol
ogy to counter the demeaning images of blacks being
portrayed in American popular culture.
William Foster, a show business publicist, made the

'I get angry because the guys get all the play. There are
some fabulous filmmakers out there that just happen to
be female but don't get the chance to really shine be
cause of the attitudes toward women in general.'

first black-produced movie, "The Railroad Porter," in
1910. Other black producers also made slapstick come
dies and dramas. By 1920 there were more than 100 race
movie companies across the United States. The race
movie industry regularly distributed black films to more
than 300 theaters by the mid-'2os.
Black filmmaking pioneer Oscar Micheaux is the main
focus of Thomas' documentary. Micheaux's films are
best known for the way they treat race and social in
equity. The novelist, farmer and entrepreneur from
South Dakota made over 40 films during the early 20th
century, many of which dealt with controversial topics
around class and color in the black community, such as
interracial romance and lynchings.
Because of his subject matter, many of Micheaux's
films were banned by a society that was not ready to rec
ognize and incorporate the black American perspective.
One of his most talked-about films, "Within Our Gates,"
was made in response to D.W. Griffith's 1915 pro-Ku
Klux Klan film "Birth of a Nation." The film use a plot
line that revolves around the attempted rape of a black
woman by a white man and the lynching of a black fam

ily. The film illustrates Micheaux's belief that economics
is the fundamental basis for segregation.
"Midnight Ramble" also documents the near destruc
tion of race movies by the Depression and Hollywood's
infiltration of the race movie market. Because of segre
gation, blacks had control over the production and dis
tribution of their films, but this changed as Hollywood
began to produce more "black cast" films.
Thomas notes the role distribution played in sustain
ing race movies and recognizes that a similar system con
trolled by blacks today would aid in the making and dis
tributing of more black films.
" 'Midnight Ramble'shines a light on a time in history
before integration when blacks were forced to be more
enterprising," Thomas said. "At one point we had our
own theaters and distribution networks. Today there is a
small movement toward developing our own distribu
tion where we would again have control of our films.
The documentary uses interviews with Edna Mae
Harris, former race movie star, Elton Fax, the illustrator
of many of Oscar Micheaux's books and Toni < ade
Bambara, a black film historian and professor of film at
Temple University.
"Midnight Ramble" has won numerous awards in
cluding the Silver Hugo Award at the Chicago

International Film Festival and the Gold Apple
Award at the National Educational Film and
Video Festival. In October 1995. Thomas showed
it at the first annual Black American Film Festival
in Flong Kong. Julie Dash, the first African-
American woman to commercially release a fea
ture film ("Daughters of the Dust," 1992) was also
at the festival.
Thomas' documentary aired on PBS in 1994 in
the series "The American Experience." Although
the film has reached an international audience,
Thomas feels that the messages in "Midnight
Ramble" are not reaching those who will benefit

from them most.
"The film is for everybody, but I expressly wanted to
get this information out to the black community so they
would know what's going on. Black folks don't fit the PBS
demographic."
In order to reach a larger audience, Thomas has been
screening her documentary at college campuses, high
schools and grade schools. It seemed the best way tor
both children and adults to have access to this untold
part of black history.
1 homas has already lectured all over the United
States at Howard University, Harvard University and
The Smithsonian Institute National Museum ot
American History.
But things didn't always look that good.
" I he first two years of the project I was spending what
little money I had and working a full-time job at Harvard
Law School. I have yet to recover my losses," said Thomas.
I he finished product is the result of a century of film
making, $700,000 in funding and a woman's selfless de
votion to unbinding the truth that would educate a com
munity ignorant of the contribution their predecessors
