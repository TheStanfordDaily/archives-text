# Tuition bingo nixed
## Giveaway not on ballot due to legal hurdles 
### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
Think of a bingo game, with a
prize of $22.(XK) to go toward a single
student's education, accompanied
hv a campus-wide party and concerts
bv live hands. Sounds great, doesn't
it?
At the last minute, the Tuition
Giveaway in Frost was "removed
from the ballot by request of Univer
sity administrators and those in
volved with the group." according to
junior Joe Freund, treasurer of the
group and ASSI J senate chair.
The reason for this decision is
that lotteries such as this are not al
lowed by California law. "We were
hoping we could make it legal," Fre
und explained, "because there is an
exemption that enables bingo games
to be held as long as they are non
profit."

"Unfortunate
ly. this exemption
is only granted to
religious organi
zations and chari
ties, and [the give
away] did not
qualify," he said.
"The Univer-

sity General Counsel was consulted
to clarify if the initiative violated
state law." said Dean of Students
Marc Wais.
"There were a number of legal
problems." said Nanci Howe, direc
tor of the Office of Student Activi
ties. "Tuition isn't a charitable pur
pose."
If the eligible student population
were limited to students in need, the
bingo could ostensibly be called
charity, but doing so would be "dubi

ous at best since individual students
are not legitimate charitable organi
zations." Freund said.
Howe also raised the issue of
whether the money would fall under
the category of tuition and financial
aid. potentially raising other issues
with the University and federal tax
law.
Since it did not appear on the
ASSU ballot, the inclusion of the
bingo special fee in the elections
handbook aroused curiosity. "The
group fulfilled the election require
ments to go into the handbook." said
Elections Commissioner Dan Perkel.
However, every special-fee group
has to be recognized by the Office of
Student Activities before it can be

put on the ballot.
"I decided to keep them in the
handbook since there was still the pos
sibility that they could be approved,"
Perkel said. If they had been ap
proved. "taking them out of the hand
book would have been bad for them."
"Technically, the project could
still be included on the ASSU ballot,
but there was no way to insure that
legal troubles wouldn't have fol
lowed." Freund said. "We couldn't
justify the risk.
"It would be irresponsible of us to
ask students for money to fund [the
project]," he added.
One student also raised ethical
opposition. "Education should not
be a prize. It cheapens it. If they gave
money to someone in need, it would
be OK." said coterminal student
Jodv Woods, resident assistant of
Eucalvpto.
