made to filmmaking.
When Thomas could no longer afford to pour money
from her own pockets into her documentary, she started
seeking outside funding sources.
After numerous patronizing pats on the back, Thomas
found a production company with the insight and vision
to realize the importance of her film. Northern Light
Productions produced Thomas' film. " The American
Experience" funded the majority of production costs al
lowing for the completion of the iilm.
"Because we were dealing with the history of black
folks in film, which most people knew nothing about,
potential funders treated the project like political toot
ball. That coupled with the fact that I was brand new,
black, female and independent, didn't help."
But being a filmmaker, female and black did not stop
Thomas from accomplishing her mission.
"I get angry because the guys get all the play. There are
some fabulous filmmakers out there that just happen to
be female but don't get the chance to really shine because
of the attitudes toward women in general."
Fitting a minority demographic is financially and ar
tistically difficult in an industry comprised mainly of
white males.
Thomas doesn't wish to downplay her talented male
counterparts, but believes that women are being short
changed in filmmaking's male-dominated industry.
"Women are extremely powerful because we have a
strong sense of ourselves — who we are and what we are
capable of doing. Men feel threatened by that. Because
they are the ones who are in control right now, they want
to keep us in check."
As a result, only a few women filmmakers have made
it to the big time. Dianne Houston became the first black
female director ever nominated for an Academy Award in
1995 for the live-action short film "Tuesday Morning
Ride." The film chronicles an elderly black couple's last
trip in their car before committing suicide.
Kasi Lemmons, director of "Eve's Bayou" (1997),
Tracey Edmonds, producer of "Soul Food"( 1997), and
Debra Martin Chase, co-producer of "The Preacher's
Wife (1996), are a few of the other black women who now
populate the Hollywood sets and have worked on films
that have become commercial successes. But they are still
the overwhelming minority in a very promising industry.
Tomorrow, Thomas will speak about the realities of be
ing an independent filmmaker and what she hopes to ac
complish by screening her film at educational institutions.
In Thomas' ideal world, the history of black cinema
would be included in the study of American history, film
study and film theory. She feels that it is her mission as a
filmmaker to not only unveil the history ot blacks in film,
but also to spread the word to the uneducated.
"Blacks have been constantly told that we don't con
tribute anything, we don't do anything and that we are
dumb. In the Constitution we were worth 3 / 5 of a man.
If you are told that long enough, you'll believe it. Don't
let anyone tell you that we didn t start making movies
until Spike." ... c u
Thomas has worked as the executive director ot the

Annual Symposium on Black Americans in the mass
media, held at Harvard University. The symposium is ti
tled "Blacks in Black & White & Color." The filmmaker
also co-founded The International Black Cinema
Network Listserv, which is an electronic forum based at
the University of North Carolina in Charlotte. She has
also worked as a producer, animator and director of pho
tography for short films, a music video and a documen
tary for The Contemporary Arts Center of Cincinnati.
Thomas is currently working on a multi-part series
entitled "From Chicago to Hollywood: The First 100
Years of Black American Cinema." The series will expand
the themes and chronological history ot blacks in cinema
raised in "Midnight Ramble." Her next endeavor is to
create a CD-ROM package that will educate people on
the first century of black American cinema.
The African American Staff Group on campus is spon
soring Thomas' lecture and screening which will take
place on campus in the Oak Room at Iresidder I nion, 6
p.m. tomorrow. The group, funded by the Office ot
Multicultural Diversity, fosters the preservation and ex
posure of African-American culture on campus by host
ing social and educational events and participating in
community service activities.
The group's chair, Wayne Duckworth, wanted the
Stanford community to see Midnight Ramble alter
Thomas approached the group about having an on-cam
pus screening.
"1 personally wasn't aware that there were a large num
ber of movies made by African Americans between 1910
and the 19505. Hearing about Pam's documentary made
me curious and interested to find out more about the
history of blacks in film."
Duckworth hopes that the Stanford audience will ben
efit from Thomas' insight on the history of blacks in film
and the process of independent filmmaking.
Accrding to Thomas, the audience has a responsible
to actively view and critique films. If they don t, she teels
they are ignoring their power as individuals to initiate
political change and educate themselves.
"People have to stop blindly accepting what happens
on screen," Thomas. "Viewers have gotten extremely lazy.
They are at the point where they feel like — just wake me
up when it's over'."
Documentaries are generally not seen as entertaining
films, yet Thomas does see ways this film genre can reach
an audience by appealing to both the viewer's need for
entertainment and education.
"There are ways of entertaining people and educating
them at the same time without beating them over the
