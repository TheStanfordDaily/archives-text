Meet Mister Man.
He likes CDs. When he
likes a CD, he brings
friends to help him buy
it. When he doesn't like
a CD, he goes CD shop
ping alone because he's
ashamed. When he
doesn't bring his friends,
the CD is pretty bad. He
only has three friends.
Follow the music
advice of Mister Man.

'Sensual Sensual'

B -Tribe's newest album is a great listen for the first 45 min
utes. The combination of flamenco guitar a la The Gypsy
Kings and hip-hop ballads k la Babyface is pleasant and
intriguing to listen to while studying, falling asleep, meditating,
or hooking up. The tracks manage to be mellow while building
to a climax, and they relax without being boring.
However, what begins as an innovative and novel sound
quickly becomes repetitive. One song blends into the next
and the next until the album finishes. While that's nice for the
aforementioned activities, people who just want to sit and lis
ten to good music will be disappointed and bored after their
quick screw has finished.
