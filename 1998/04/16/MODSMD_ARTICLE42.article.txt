# Everything:
## 'Super Natural' 
### 
Everything's sound is pretty much summed up by its name. Its debut re
lease on Blackbird / Sire, "Super Natural," doesn't fit into categories.On
"Super Natural," Everything performs a mixture of rock, R&B and funk. A
folk twist in some of the songs reminds me of the music of Paul Simon and
The Dave Matthews Band.
The group combines various musical sounds, leaning toward New Orleans
style horns and solid basslines. Everything's combination of hip-hop rhythms
with a strong, brassy horn section carry an upbeat, yet mellow, sound throughout
the CD. The six-member group has been playing together for eight years. These
professionally-trained musicians have each been playing since childhood, and
their skills show through the sound of their saxophones, guitars, a trombone, an

organ, keyboards, basses and a clarinet.Everything converted a pre-civil war man
sion into a recording studio for "Super Natural." Each room was used for its spe
cific acoustics. Jim Ebert, who has worked with Madonna, Toni Braxton, Ice
Cube, Soul Coughing and Everclear, flew in from Los Angeles to produce "Super
Natural" in Virginia.
"Super Natural" is Everything's fourth release. Its previous CD releases include
"Sorid" (1993), "Labrador" (1994) and its self-titled 1996 release. Everything's
third CD was nominated for Best Rock Album by the National Association of
Independent Record Distributors and for Best Cover Design for a Rock Album.
