# Clannad:
## 'Landmarks' 
### 
Clannad's latest album,
"Landmarks," is a pow
erful and balanced mix
of music. It features lyrics in
English and Gaelic and the po
etic wind instruments that have
come to mark the musical form.
Gaelic music, as embodied by
Clannad, evokes the organic
and the natural in a way that
many music genres can't. It's as
if the music is coming out of
the earth itself. This environ
mental quality is probably why
the genre is so often used in
movie scores ("Braveheart,"

"Titanic") to create a powerful
emotional atmosphere.
Fifteen years ago, Clannad was
just about it in popular Gaelic mu
sic. Then Enya (a former member
of Clannad) spun off into her own
solo career stardom, and between
Clannad, the Chieftains, Gaelic
Storm and others, the sounds of
Ireland have been exported and
widely enjoyed.
At first glance, "Landmarks"
seems like the kind of music you
would put on for quiet music to
study by, but the album has too
much energy — it sneaks up on

you and makes you want to
dance. "Fad 6" opens with an low
whistle solo that sounds like
something from "Titanic" but
then segues into a lovely Gaelic
ballad, while "Let Me See" could
be any American love song.
Gaelic tradition, elegant and
touching instrumental and a
splash of modern sensibility
make this album a pleasure to
listen to. With only 10 tracks, it's
a pleasure that ends all too soon.
