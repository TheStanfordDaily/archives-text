# Various Artists:
## Noella Hutton 
### 
Why does every
artsy chick
with a few
messy break-ups behind
her feel like she's enti
tled to record an album
of meandering punk
folk songs with self
pitying lyrics? This is
what Noella Hutton
did, and the resulting
CD is a mess.
Despite a limited vo
cal range, Hutton is a
competent and engag
ing singer, reminiscent
of both Tori Amos and
Marianne Faithfull.
Unfortunately, her ma
terial is so substandard
that it overshadows
whatever singing talent
Hutton has.
Considering that the
music on the album
lacks both pop hooks
and dramatic intensity,
one would expect the
lyrics to make up for
those shortcomings. But
no, the lyrics are insipid
in that open-micro

phone poetry reading
way. Hutton is full of
angst but can't seem to
express it in a way that
makes listeners care.
Even after probing her
emotional depths, all
that she can come up
with are platitudes like
"This world makes me
sick from all the pain
that exists" and "Pain —
all this time in vain."
That is not to say that
the CD is without its re
wards. Mature, dreamy
tracks like "It's Unusual
to be Happy" and
"Shameful" are indica
tive of the directions
that Hutton's songwrit
ing could take if she
were to abandon her
sincere but misguided
self-righteousness.
Perhaps with the
right production team
she could be another
Meredith Brooks.
And then God help
us all.
