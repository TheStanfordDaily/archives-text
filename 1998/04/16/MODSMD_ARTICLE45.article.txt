# ‘A Go Go’
## 
### 
A great man once said, "Good
Gawd! You've got to get it on
the good foot!" And that's ex
actly what John Scofield and Medeski,
Martin and Wood do on their new al
bum "A Go Go." From track one on
wards, the album is a steady stream of
steamin' funk, serving up a heaping
helping of grooves so thick you could
cut them with a knife.
John Scofield is one of the world's
premiere jazz guitarists, and his dis
torted, rock / funk-influenced style
makes him the perfect addition to the
formidable drums, bass and organ
trio of Medeski, Martin and Wood.
The group's scorching live shows have
been winning fans across the country.
The real joy of this album is the
way these two powerhouses comple
ment each other, bringing out each
other's strengths while smoothing out
the weaknesses. Medeski, Martin and
Wood prove to be the perfect medium
for Scofield's improvisations, since
their creaking, wheezy soul adds life to
Scofield's occasionally sterile compo
sitions. At the same time, Scofield's
presence really opens up the sound of
MMW, keeping them from falling into
the repetitive riffs which often plague
their albums.
Having said that, "A Go Go's" only
flaw is that it has a tendency to get
stuck in a laid-back jazz album rut
just when it needs to open up and
really go.
However, that's a small complaint
when you consider the fierce funki
ness that pervades this disc and the
incredible opportunity to hear these
two together.
