Though the scary guys in Hawaiian shirts and
wave-shaped pompadours on the "Meet the
Deedles" album cover do not provide high
hopes for the quality of the music, the tracks are
solid both individually and an album.
Opening the album is a new song by the Mighty
Mighty Bosstones,"Wrong Thing Right Then." Using
its newer more-ska-and-less-hard-core sound, the
Bosstones set the pace for a strong soundtrack.
The Dance Hall Crashers, Hepcat and Save Ferris
all provide poppy ska tunes that are fun and instantly
catchy. Goldfinger turns out a surprise album-stealer
with "Seems Like Yesterday," a track that combines
upbeat horns with a mainstream punk sound.
Lesser-known band Perfect Thyroid does a musi
cally adept cover of the "Hawaii Five-O" television
theme while Gary Hoey reveals what would happen
if the Partridge Family had been a ska band on his
track "Go Where You Go." Rounding out the album
are a great swing track by the Cherry Poppin'
Daddies and a few alternatunes by the likes of Radish
and Homie.
Taken track by track, "Meet the Deedles" provides
a bunch of fun and danceable songs that definitely
merit a listen. Taken as a whole, the album yields a
largely ska- and surf-based collection of solid efforts
by established bands who provide the perfect ac
companiment for the lazy days of summer — with
or without Hawaiian shirts.
