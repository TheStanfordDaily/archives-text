Without one ounce of shame, I am giving a mixed re
view for Billy Crystal's new comedy, "My Giant." It
becomes drenched in gooey sentimentality by the

end, but I am a sucker for that kind of film. "My Giant" actually clicks as a
movie, particularly in the dramatic moments, and I found myself pulling for
certain events to happen.
Crystal stars as Sammy, a self-involved movie agent who is divorced and
nearly broke. He pins his hopes on a talented, up-and-coming actor, but
when the child star dumps him, he is fazed and gets into a major car accident.
In fact, he would have died had it not been for the brave rescue by 7-foot-7-
inch Max, (Gheorghe Muresan, NBA center for the Washington Wizards).
Sammy mistakens Max's enormous hands for those of God.

Sammy needs to find new income so that he can visit
his son, Nick (Zane Carney), and he sees an

opportunity in Max. He strikes a deal
with a local producer to hire Max for a
small part. With some money and a
I plane ticket in hand, the Shakespeare
( quoting giant travels to America in
search of his childhood girlfriend,

Lillianna (Joanna Pacula).

Unfortunately, Lillianna
does not want to speak to
Max, and this poses quite a
problem for Sammy. How
can he get Max to go to Las
Vegas for a movie shooting
without dangling the carrot

rof seeing his beloved flame?
Well, Sammy doesn't have the
gumption to break the news to
Max, so he lies.
Now Sammy faces his fam
ily and his ex-wife, Serena
(Kathleen Quinlan, "Apollo
13"), in an attempt to garner

some funds to travel Nevada.
The movie in Las Vegas stars
Steven Seagal, who graces the big
screen with his ugly mug and
one-dimensional acting.

The pushes for comedy seem
forced and sitcom-like, and they
are clearly directed at the younger
set. Jokes about vomiting and Jews
come across as crude and out-

dated. I really feel that this might
have been a much better film had
the filmmakers decided to concen
trate on the dramatic side of gigan-

™ tism. The medical and social aspects
of being abnormally tall are particu
i larly involving, and the movie made
\ me consider myself lucky to be of av
erage height. Overall, "My Giant" is a

surprisingly well-meaning and jovial
picture.
