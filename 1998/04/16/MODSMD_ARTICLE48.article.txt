# Forbid that fruit
## 'City of Angels' isn't all that heavenly 
### 
There are points during "City of Angels" when the film has the op
portunity to become a really good movie. Unfortunately, at each
of these points, director Brad Silberling makes the wrong deci
sion, sending the film into the realm of mushy-goo love and ludicrous
situations. If there is one phrase that describes "Angels," it is "over the
top."
The problem is, the film is trying to work at too many levels. It
wants to serve both as an epic love story and a theological dissertation.
It questions the afterlife, the existence of God and the basis of human
ity. That's a lot, considering that we're also supposed to accept Meg
Ryan as an expert thoracic surgeon.
The film centers around Seth (Nicholas Cage), an angel who is dis
enchanted with his heavenly existence. Living at the library, looming
about deathbeds and unable to experience touch, taste or smell, the only
perks of angelhood seem to be "music in the sunrise" (please) and un
limited loan desk privileges. Humanity, on the other hand, is blessed
with junk food, pain and — best of all — dating.
Seth becomes smitten with cardiologist Maggie (Ryan), despite the
fact that she is an unfeeling procedure surgeon. When Maggie loses a
patient, he steps in to offer spiritual guidance, and their tortured love
grows from there.
In no time, he has taught her a valuable lesson about compassion,
and she has shown him human pleasures, like eating pears and looking
at Meg Ryan. Soon he is considering a leap towards mortality. Both
Cage and Ryan play characters filled with perpetual wonder at each
other's beauty and goodness.
"City of Angels" starts out with a promising wry wit, and the two
stars are initially appealing. Silberling's direction provides an elevated
view of Los Angeles that gives the city a cool ethereal look. Dennis Franz
provides comic relief as a fallen angel with a penchant for cholesterol.
Everything goes rapidly downhill into schmaltz, however, with dia
logue like, "He would give up eternity," and"I would do anything for
just one breath of her air" Cage and Ryan are cheesier than I ever be
lieved possible. The fact that they are supposed to be espousing com
mentary on faith and God just makes things worse.
The last half hour is awful and replete with arms-spread "Titanic"
poses, which makes "City of Angels" all the more frustrating. It at
tempts to remind us of the simple joys of being human that are taken
for granted, with an emphasis on the enjoyment of market produce.
This is not necessarily a bad message, but it certainly does not require
two hours of mush to deliver. For once, Nicholas Cage isn't much of a
messenger.

Meg, I don't think I'm getting an Oscar this time.
