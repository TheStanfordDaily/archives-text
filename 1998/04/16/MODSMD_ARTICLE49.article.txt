# ‘The Players Club' loses the message
## Stereotypes prevail in Ice Cube's directorial debut 
### 
Ice Cube's new film and directorial debut, "The Players Club," is a
vigorous, interesting movie. However it is problematic on a number
of levels.
"The Players Club" both challenges and reinforces stereotypes of
women as "bitches" and "hoes" as it depictsthe seedy underworld of
strip clubs and the women resigned to work in them.
The primary challenge to these degrading stereotypes comes from
Diana (Lisaßaye), a college student and single mother who reluctantly
turns to stripping to support her education, her child and her hopes of
becoming a broadcast journalist.
She ends up at a seedy joint called The Players Club, which is run by
the even seedier Dollar Bill (Bernie Mac). Dollar Bill is being tracked
down by a gangster to whom he owes money. His troubles serve to ra
tionalize the number of gunshots, explosions and beatings that some
how make their way into a movie that's supposed to be focusing on
"one woman's struggle to uplift herself."

Lisaßaye plays her
character excellently,
and she lends a
strength to her strug
gling young mother
role — you may feel
sorry for her, but you
don't pity her. Ice
Cube empowers her
through her dialogue
and her actions, con
stantly reminding
you that she's a
strong protagonist.
But in almost
every other aspect of
"The Players Club,"
it's like Ice Cube is
saying that too much
female empower
ment is not a good
thing. There are an
inordinate number of
T&A shots of the
same women who
speak about how de
grading stripping is.
Men mock the "fat
and ugly" women
with a viciousness,
and there is more
than one disturbing
rape scene — one of
which is perpetrated
by the villain, Ronnie

(Chrystale Wilson), who is somewhat of a rabid lesbian. There's even a
bloody cat fight between Diana and Ronnie, emphasizing the pitting of
women against women instead of women against men.
Which is not to say that "The Players Club" doesn't have a chord of
realism, because it most definitely does. Its explicit goal is to expose the
horrors that some women face. The problem is that the way in which
this is done serves more to encourage stereotypes than to discourage
them. So on the level of entertainment, "The Players Club" is an excit
ing, interesting movie. But on any other level, it's a very disturbing
piece of social commentary.
