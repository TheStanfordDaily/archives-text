# No, Greased Lightning, no!
## Is 'Grease' really a worthy classic? movies 
### 
Anybody out there feel nostalgic about the 19505, a time when rock
'n'roll was just coming alive and people wore poodle skirts and leather
jackets? If you're like many college students, the answer is very likely
no. That's why the 20th anniversary rerelease of "Grease" can fail to entertain
us.
"Grease" is a fun and typically cheesy musicaj about a group of high
school students in the '50s. This classic does have its moments of sly wit and
humor, but in these less innocent times, it often comes across as cloyingly

happy.
"Grease" is primarily the story of two
young lovers — Sandra Dee (Olivia

Newton-Iohn) and Danny Zuko
(John Travolta) — who come

from totally different worlds.
Sandra is the goody-two
shoes new girl from

Australia, while Danny is
the bad hoy who needs to
look cool.

After sharing a sum
mer romance on the
beach, Danny and Sandra

are surprised to find them
selves at the same high
school. Danny, trying to be

cool, initially brushes off
Sandra Dee, and their rela
tionship has a few rocky bumps.
The showcase of high
school stereotypes and the
parody of school life are per
haps the best things about the
movie. Lines like, "If you can't
be an athlete, be an athletic

supporter," (from the uptight school principal of Rydell High) are easily
imaginable elsewhere. The jocks, nerds, cheerleaders, "bad" girls and cool
rebels all make an appearance. And the movie makes fun of them all in a
lighthearted, harmless way. Also, an attempt by Frenchy (Didi Conn) to find
a career is a comical treatment of a serious adolescent anxiety.
However, most of the serious issues in this movie are brushed off with
such a carefree attitude that one wonders why they were put in the movie in
the first place. For instance, Rizzo (Stockard Channing) has unprotected sex,
misses her period and gets really worried. Soon she finds out it was just a false
alarm, and all of her problems are over. In a car race between rival gangs,
Danny's car is sabotaged in a silly attempt to add some suspense.
Most of the music is pretty bad. This presents a problem, considering that
the movie is a musical. The dance numbers have a lot of energy, but songs like
"Beauty School Dropout" just got on my nerves.
Overall, "Grease" is a fun bit of fluff that will appeal to people feeling sen
timental about the '50s and who love the old television show "Happy Days."
If people can get past how silly this movie gets most of the time, they will
really love their two hours in the theater. Otherwise, stay tar, far away from
this movie and spend your time and money on something more worthwhile.
