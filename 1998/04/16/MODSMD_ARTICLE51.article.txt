Despite the naysayers, at
some point everyone's wanted
to know whether or not aphro
disiacs really work. Why else
would Spanish Fly still sell? So
I'm going to give you the
skinny on some allegedly au
thentic aphrodisiacs.
First, the myth of Spanish
Fly. True, Spanish Fly is made
from crushed emerald-green
Mister beetles and has a very in
tense clove flavor. But whatever
you may have seen in seedy sex
shops or the back of some mag
azine is most likely some sort of
scam. Chances are that you
can't get the real thing, and if
you can, it doesn't work.
A lot of aphrodisiacs de
pend more on the power of
suggestion than anything else.
Chemically-based sexual stim
ulation is one thing, but many
foods are aphrodisial simply
because they feel good to eat.
There's a lot to be said for a
food with the right texture,
taste and smell. And hey, if it
turns you on, run with it!
Over the centuries, certain
foods, spices and other sub
stances have gained distinction
for their contributions to the
erogenous arts. Some are well
known, some are barely pro
nounceable. Others are natu
rally evocative of sexual
impressions, like figs and
honey. Still others are a little
more difficult to imagine in a
sensuous light (for example,
you probably don't immedi
ately think of ginger or garlic as
sexy foods).
Lobster, sole, clams and es
pecially oysters are all reputedly
potent aphrodisiacs. Oysters
have garnered renown ever
since ancient times; the Greek
love goddess Aphrodite came to
the Earth in a large oyster shell.
She then promptly gave birth to
Eros. An aphrodisiac was born!
Low in fat and high in min
erals like phosphorous and
zinc, oysters are a healthy and
light food whose slippery tex
ture could be quite provocative
with a little imagination. Zinc
is especially important since it
is said to increase sperm and
testosterone production as well
as the secretion of vaginal lu
bricant.
Different fruits have long
been famous for their eroge
nous properties, especially
grapes (go Bacchus!), strawber
ries (and champagne...), figs
(not as a means of daily wear),
mangoes ("Blue Lagoon?") and
cherries (ever seen "9 1/2
Weeks?"). Whether this is be
cause of actual aphrodisial
properties or just the intensity

of taste, fruit can be sexually ex
pressive as well as stimulating.
The sensuality of fruits can
be enhanced with the addition
of a drizzling of warm choco
late or honey, both of which
have racy qualities.
Even beyond its savory
taste, chocolate has long been
thought to have strong aphro
disial properties. There is a
chemical in chocolate called
phenylethylalamine that re
leases endorphins. These en
dorphins promote pleasant
sensations. Some reach for the
Godiva not only when they're
down, but also when they're
up-
Sweet and sticky honey has
been associated with sex and
sensuality for ages. Providing
you with an energy-efficient
form of sugar as well as being a
nice erotic condiment, honey is
great stuff for some good, high
energy loving.
If you're not the messy
type, Kama Sutra markets a
neater option â€” Honey Dust.
The dust is made from freeze
dried honey to produce a
lightly sweet and silky powder.
The powder can be dusted on
any body part with the dainty
feather duster provided and
then removed by a hungry
lover.
Ancient history gives us its
own version of Spanish Fly:
pine nuts. Roman poet Ovid
sang high praises of the tor
pedo or triangle-shaped pine
nut in"The Art of Love." The
most effective variety grows in
the northwestern Himalayas,
but there are many easy-to-ob
tain varieties from other coun
tries. Bet they didn't tell you
that in CIV.
There are other concoc
tions that are derived from
plant preparations and various
animal parts, but there are
many more than I can mention
here. I won't talk about animal
part potions since they're not
very humane, and I don't want
to give you any ideas about
your neighbor's cat. But if
you're really interested, check
out a Web site called "lohan's
Guide to Aphrodisiacs" at

cept/aphrlist.htm
Maybe there is a chemical basis
to some of these, but I'd argue
that the right mood, some sexy
intentions and an appetite for
fun can do just as much as a
rhinoceros horn cocktail.
