Jones contemplates appeal
DALLAS (AP) — In a series of meetings with her
lawyers and financial backers, Paula Jones contem
plated yesterday whether to ask a federal appellate
court to revive her sexual harassment suit against Pres
ident Clinton.
Jones and her lawyers were discussing the odds of
winning an appeal of the April 1 decision by Judge
Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock, Ark. Factoring
into the talks were concerns about how much of a toll
continuing the fight would take on Jones, both emo
tionally and financially, her adviser said.
While Jones' camp has suggested in recent days
that an appeal was "MO percent sure," her spokeswom
an sounded more pessimistic.
"We have a lot of things to look at," said Susan
Carpenter McMillan, Jones' adviser and spokeswom
an.

Mammograms often erroneous
BOSTON (AP) — A woman who receives mam
mograms every year for a decade runs a 50-50 chance
of a breast cancer false alarm, a study found. The study
is the first to show how the risk of these frights adds up
over time. Researchers said that while mammograms
clearly save lives, doctors should prepare their patients
better for the possibility of erroneous results.
"If women understand the chances of having to
come back for further tests, they might not get so
scared and anxious when that happens," said Dr. Mary
B. Barton of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a Boston
area health maintenance organization.
The study found that a woman who undergoes
annual mammograms after age 40 — as major health
organizations recommend — faces a 50 percent
chance of having at least one of these false positives
over 10 years.
