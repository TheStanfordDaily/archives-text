# Housing plans enrage faculty
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Amid protests from students
that their voice isn't considered in
University housing decisions,
more than 200 faculty and staff
members gathered at Tresidder
Union last night to make a similar
complaint.
Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders â€” an advocacy
group for campus homeowners -
called the meeting in response to
concern that four parcels of land in
residential neighborhoods had
been marked for development
without input from residents.
The University's recent surveys
of the May field Playfield, Cierona
Triangle, Frenchman's Triangle

and a site on Dolores Street have
destroyed homeowners' trust in
the University, said Christie Hol
loway. speaking for residents of
Gerona's and Frenchman's Trian
gles.
"The fact that these newly pro
posed housing units seem to be
moving ahead... and there was no
community process." she said,
"was most unsettling and disturb
ing."
The crowd that overflowed
Tresidder's Oak Room last night
came prepared to let the Universi
ty know its voice must be heard.
Applause, booing and murmured
comments frequently disrupted
the discussion.
