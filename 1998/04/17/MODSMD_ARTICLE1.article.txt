# Housing plans enrage faculty
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Amid protests from students
that their voice isn't considered in
University housing decisions,
more than 200 faculty and staff
members gathered at Tresidder
Union last night to make a similar
complaint.
Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders — an advocacy
group for campus homeowners -
called the meeting in response to
concern that four parcels of land in
residential neighborhoods had
been marked for development
without input from residents.
The University's recent surveys
of the May field Playfield, Cierona
Triangle, Frenchman's Triangle

and a site on Dolores Street have
destroyed homeowners' trust in
the University, said Christie Hol
loway. speaking for residents of
Gerona's and Frenchman's Trian
gles.
"The fact that these newly pro
posed housing units seem to be
moving ahead... and there was no
community process." she said,
"was most unsettling and disturb
ing."
The crowd that overflowed
Tresidder's Oak Room last night
came prepared to let the Universi
ty know its voice must be heard.
Applause, booing and murmured
comments frequently disrupted
the discussion.
Attendees particularly ex
pressed coneern about the develop
ment of the Mayfield Playfield, an
area across from Slavianskii Dom
that currently is used by students,
faculty and staff members and their
families. The Dolores site also bor
ders on student residences, wedged
between Roth House and the
upper Row, while the other two
sites border on Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
University Architect David
Neuman offered details of plans for
the Mayfield site, which he said has
been studied in more depth than
other sites. All four sites were
marked for potential residential
development in a 1980 land-use
plan.
Neuman listed three options for
the 1.3-acre Mayfield site: five sin
gle-family homes on quarter-acre
lots; 10 compact single-family
homes on smaller lots; or four
buildings with four townhouses
each, for a total of 16 units on the
site.
But members of the audience
were less interested in the develop
ment options than in the develop
ment itself. People repeatedly
asked whether the development
could be stopped — leaving the site
as an open field — and wdre left
dissatisfied with Vice Provost'for'
Institutional Development Geoff
C'ox's response that only the Board
of Trustees had authority to make
such a decision.
English Prof. John Felstiner,
representing residents in the May

field area, expressed "acute con
cern" about the University's plans
to build within its existing devel
oped borders rather than expand
ing onto its undeveloped land.
Mayfield Playfield is among
"the only precious remaining
oases" of open space within cam
pus, Felstiner said, calling the land
"not expendable."
But Cox emphasized that the
housing is necessary if Stanford
hopes to continue to attract faculty.
Stanford's plans to build 6(K) apart
ment units on Ohlone Field, off of
Sand Hill Road, which will provide
space for some faculty, staff mem
bers, graduate students and post
doctoral fellows, he said. But little
is available for those who might
want single-family or clustered
multi-family dwellings.
" The real estate market has
been a subject of increasing con
cern and even alarm for the Uni
versity," Cox said. "It would be ir
responsible to ignore that."
Faculty and staff in attendance
agreed with Cox but told him they
could not be ignored either.
As residents of an unincorporat
ed part of Santa Clara County, they
said they have few avenues to ex
press their opinions about develop
ment plans.
The leaseholders group was de
signed to give residents a voice,
Holloway said, but neither Stan
ford nor the county seems to be lis
ten rfra 3nt aaoioß I>■ i >i^
tening.
The UrtiVersity'sf plans'reflect a'
"short-term solution that will irrev
ocably change the character of the
campus," she said. "We want to re
store trust, and we want to develop
together the best long-term plan
for the challenges ahead."
