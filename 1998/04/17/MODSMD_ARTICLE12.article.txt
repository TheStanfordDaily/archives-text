NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP)
Tornadoes tore through Tennessee
and Arkansas yesterday, blowing
out windows in hundreds of build
ings and ripping off roofs in down
town Nashville and splintering
mobile homes in rural areas earlier
in the day.
Four people, including a little
brother and sister, were killed in
rural parts of Arkansas and Ten
nessee.
"People heard it but couldn't
see it," Manila, Ark., firefighter
Michael White said of the early
morning twister that was cloaked
by darkness and sheets of rain. "It
passed probably 4(K) yards from my

house. There was so much light
ning and rain I didn't see any
thing."
The earlier storm hit Manila, in
northeastern Arkansas about 230
miles west of Nashville, about 3
a.m., killing Casey Lomax, 2 1/2,
and Brittni Lomax, 5. Their par
ents were injured.
An hour later, a tornado
spawned by the same storm killed
Paul and Peggy Kolwyck in
Roellen, Tenn., about 50 miles east
of Manila. Their bodies were found
200 to 250 feet from their trailer
home, which was torn apart.
Yesterday afternoon two torna
does struck Nashville. About 100

people were injured, police and
emergency management officials
said. A man who was hit by a
falling tree in Centennial Park was
seriously hurt.
Cecil Whaley of the Tennessee
Emergency Management Agency
said most of the injuries were from
flying glass and none was believed
life-threatening.
Whaley said the first tornado
touched down west of downtown
at about 3:30 p.m. and then
skipped across the city for 3 or 4
miles, A second struck east
Nashville. About 300 buildings
were damaged. Whaley said.
Gov. Don Sundquist declared

Nashville a disaster area. Several
state buildings were damaged,
including the Capitol and the
James K. Polk office building.
"Considering the severity of the
storm, it could have been a whole
lot worse." Sundquist said. "The
fact that we didn't have a whole lot
of fatalities is a miracle really."
He had no estimate on
statewide damage, but said officials
from the Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency would tour the
state today and make an assess
ment.
The Tennessee Oilers' football
stadium, which is about one-third
complete, also was damaged.
