SANTIAGO. Chile (AP)
Unable to deliver on a free-trade
promise. President Clinton signed
a series of shorter-term economic
fixes on a state visit yesterday and
urged Chileans to "be patient with
us."
In advance of this weekend's
34-nation hemispheric summit.
Clinton and Chile's president,
Eduardo Frei. also signed pacts on
trade, environment, drugs, educa
tion and on dealing with climate
related disasters like El Nino.
Clinton saluted Chile's "aston
ishing record" in transforming
itself from one of Latin America's
most militaristic regimes to a
democratic dynamo in less than a
decade.
"Latin America has grown so

strong that I think even a lot of
you are surprised," he told a busi
ness audience. "Latin America has
found its voice, its confidence and
its well earned seat at the interna
tional table."
Clinton had hoped to be able to
deliver to Chile permanent mem
bership in the free-trade agree
ment that now links the United
States with Canada and Mexico —
a promise he made four years ago.
But the president has been
unable to win from Congress "fast
track" trade negotiating authority
needed — with U.S. labor and
enviornmental groups leading the
opposition.
Clinton said that despite
"bumps in the road" he would
forge on in his effort to win the

authority — not only for free trade
with Chile hut to meet the goal of
a hemisphere-wide free-trade zone
by 2005. At the same time, he sug
gested any such agreement would
have to accomodate some of the
environmental and labor concerns.
In the meantime, Clinton and
Frei announced they would form a
U.S.-Chile Commission on Trade
and Investment to study ways of
broadening trade and resolving
disputes. They also promised clos
er cooperation among their
respective banking industries.
"Obviously there will always be
a small amount of disputes or fric
tion or conflicts," said Frei. "But
the important thing is to find a way
to settle these. And that's what
we've done."

Among the agreements signed
by Clinton and Frei was one urg
ing stronger efforts by both indus
trial and developing nations to
curb air pollution that aggravates
global warming.
The two presidents also indicat
ed their two nations were close to
reaching an "open skies" agree
ment to ease restrictions on air
traffic.
Clinton and Frei agreed to
increase exchanges of students and
teachers and to create a pan-
American weather forecasting sys
tem to better prepare for destruc
tive weather events like El Nino.
Members of Clinton's Cabinet,
including Secretary of State Made
line Albright, met separately with
their Chilean counterparts.
