# Khmer Rouge leader dies

### 
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) — Pol Pot, the man
known to his comrades as Brother Number One died
Wednesday, two days short of the 23rd anniversary ol
the day his army captured Phnom Penh and began a
reign of terror.
Cambodian revolutionary Pol Pot had all the hall
marks of a tyrant: paranoia, cunning, ruthlessness.
King Norodom Sihanouk, at various times Pol Pot's
ally or adversary, compared him to Stalin — but also
said he had a certain charisma that made him "very
charming."
His Khmer Rouge regime, however, was one of the
most brutal the 20th century has witnessed. As many as
two million Cambodians died, some in grisly city tor
ture centers, others in the countryside with a blow to
the back of the head with a hoe. Many died of starva
tion, overwork and illness during Khmer Rouge
attempts to force a Maoist-style collectivization of agri
culture.
The last time Pol Pot was seen alive by outsiders
in several interviews last year — he was an enfeebled
old man who almost looked kindly.
"Our movement made mistakes." he told American
journalist Nate Thayer, the first to interview him in IS
years. "1 came to carry out the struggle, not to kill peo
ple. Even now. and you can look at me: Am 1 a savage
person? My conscience is clear."
The best estimates are that one in five Cambodians
of a population of 7.9 million died when the Khmer
Rouge were in power from 1975-79.
Pol Pot set up a secret communist party in the 1950s

while maintaining a legal Iront as a teacher at a private
school. Students described him as quiet and unfailingly
polite.
On April 17. 1975. the Khmer Rouge entered
Phnom Penh and a veil of darkness fell over ( ambodia.
I lie country, renamed Democratic Kampuchea,
shunned almost all contacts with the outside world.
But no postwar neediness could fully explain the
genocide the Khmer Rouge almost immediately
unleashed.
The first to he killed were soldiers and officials of
the old regime. In a few months came the elimination
of several members of Pol Pot's inner circle.
Indeed, party members suspected of treason would
face appalling fates, tortured and forced to write false
confessions at a high school-turned-prison before being
put to death at a killing field on the city outskirts.
To boost food production — and control the popu
lation — all residents of every city were moved into
vast rural communes. These came to mean terror for
ordinary Cambodians.
The communes, managed with more revolutionary
zeal than skill, were failures. Instead of reviewing the
wisdom of his drastic economic policies. Pol Pot
blamed the failure on treason and conspiracy. He
lashed out. and made the error of picking a fight with
Vietnam, which then had one of the toughest armies in
the world. With the help of Khmer Rouge defectors —
