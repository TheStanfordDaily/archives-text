# FAA calls for changes in 737 fuel systems
## New airplane rules 
### 
WASHINGTON (Al>) The govern
ment said yesterday it will require changes in
the fuel and vent systems of older Boeing
7375. the most popular airliner in the world,
to prevent possible explosions similar to the
one that downed TW A Right SIX)
The proposed airworthiness directive is
one notch below an emergency order.
Despite its mandator) nature, the Federal
Aviation Administration said there was no
immediate threat to the (lying public.
The FAA offered a 45-day public com
ment period and said it would then take
another month and a half before issuing final
requirements. l"he agencs is proposing that
the work, which it estimated would cost
$.V>.(KX) per aircraft, be completed within a
year of its final order.
l he proposed directive would require
installation of electrical surge suppression
systems or the shielding and separation of
wiring routed to the plane's fuel tanks from
nearby wiring.
In addition, the order would require the
installation of flame arrestors and pressure
relief valves in the plane's fuel vent system,
steps aimed at keeping flames outside the 737
from entering the fuel system via wingtip fuel

vents.
"It is not an immediate safety-of-flight
issue. It it was. we would be taking tar more
direct and quiek action on this." said Tom
McSweeny. director of the FAA's aircraft
certification service.
Boeing officials pledged ax>pcration with
the FAA and said the\ already are working
on aircraft changes that would accomplish the
same safct\ objectives as those proposed by
the government.
"We will respond to the FAA's proposed
rule after we've had the opportunity to
review our design, conduct tests and analyze
data We will continue to conduct airplane
tests to assess the hkelihixKl ot high voltage
currents entering the airplane's fuel tanks "
said Boeing spokesman Russ Young.
Boeing also said it is designing a flame sup
pressor pressure relief valve that it expects
will be available to airlines by mid-lW*}.
The proposed order stems from the inves
tigation into the explosion of I"W A Right 800
and mirrors an airworthiness directive the
FAA proposed for older Boeing 747 sin
November. It also is based on the ongoing
investigation of the explosion of a Philippine
Airlines 737-300 on May 11, I WO.
