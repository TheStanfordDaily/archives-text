## Notebook Going beyond charity 
### 
Acknowledge existence of
social injustices that may
be not be widely publicized

LAST WEEKEND 1 participat
ed in a Stanford concert enti
tled "World Jam: A Benefit
Concert for North Korea." It was a
touching concert both because of the
diverse talents that were displayed and
because it brought five very different
cultures together to support a common
cause. Yet. there was something more
to this concert than the jamming
rhythms and the charitable theme.
A million North Korean children
have died of starvation in the past three
years. Mavbe it's not a million; maybe
it's just half a million. Or perhaps two
million. The number doesn't matter.
What matters is that somewhere, a
baby girl just died because two months
ago her father died of hunger and two
weeks later, so did her mother. The girl
went to a nursery that no longer had
food — only a room full of dying
babies. But she did not appear on the
cover of Newsweek or Time. And so
the tragedy continues silently.
There are starving children every
where — we dig into our wallets for
those whose skeletal faces we see every
other day staring pitifully at a camera
or whose bloated bellies desperately
invite our goodwill. And we quietly
ignore those who don't have the oppor
tunity to flash their sickly bodies on
front-page media.
It takes a ghastly image — imprinted
on our minds some dozen times —
before charity kicks in.
But pictures of starving children are

not for sale; they are about human suf
fering. And human suffering is greater
than the periodic news images we see
and the little charity we send.
That baby girl who died in the nurs
ery died not because that's just the way
life is. To see her death as simply one
more of life's tragic misfortunes is to
ignore the injustice in a world that
allows her to die simply because she
did not display her wasting body on our
evening news. Her country adheres to a
different political ideology than ours
and refused to sell her pain.
It is unfortunate that we require
humans to market themselves as des
perate creatures before we acknowl
edge the injustices they suffer, if even
then.
I hope last weekend's concert wasn't
one that set images of starving children
to heart-wrenching music for a $5
donation.
As one of the organizers, I hope the
event will begin to ask more of us —
not just in dollars, but in how we see
the injustices of this world.
One benefit concert, even held
annually, will not end the hunger in
North Korea, Somalia, Ethiopia or the
United States. But the point is not that
we end the worlds troubles. It is that
we challenge ourselves to look beyond
our niche in the educated elite of
America — to look at a hungry boy in
North Korea not as a Third World alien
with a bloated belly but as a human
being who could be my or your baby
brother. It is to make sure that our sor
row and anger does not end when a
child's hungry face disappears from our
newspapers or when the green bill
drops to the bottom of the donation
box.
