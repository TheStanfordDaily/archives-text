# Dean Spence to step down in fall
## 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Staff writer 
Dean of the Graduate School of
Business Michael Spence an
nounced yesterday that he will step
down from his post effective Sept. I.
1999.
"I continue to believe that Stan
ford has so many wonderful charac
teristics: openness to move with an
idea and get things done is an extra
ordinary feature." Spence said at
yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting.
During his nine-year tenure at
Stanford. Spence inaugurated a
more global first-year core curricu

lum at the Business School. He also
raised funds and built the $31 mil
lion Schwab Residential Learning
Center and founded the Center of
Entrepreneurial Study.
Under Spence's leadership, "the
MBA program at Stanford has be
come the most sought-after in the
world." said Provost Condoleez/.a
Kice.
Although he will step down as
dean, Spence said that he intends to
continue playing an active role at
the University. Spence said his deci
sion is not related to a Business
School computer server snafu last
month in which several people lost
months of research material.
"1 am expecting to stay a col
league [and teach]," he told the sen
ate.
Rice said she would form a com
mittee to search for a new dean by
this summer.
The senate also revised policies
on minimum units to he earned at
Stanford for undergraduate degrees
and the University's transfer credit
policy.
Students will now have to com
plete a minimum of 90 units of cred
it at Stanford toward their bachelor's
degree. Those pursuing dual degrees
will have to complete a minimum of
135 units at Stanford.
Currently, students can complete
as little as 45 units of study here.
"If the Stanford brand name is to
mean something, (the committee]
believes that at least half of the units
counted toward the degree must be
earned at Stanford," said Hester
Gelber. chair of the Committee on
Academic Achievement and Ap
praisal.
"Harvard. Amherst. Dartmouth
and many other schools all have two
year minimum residency require
ments."
The new policy brings the
school's requirements closer to actu
al practice, as the vast majority of
Students already earn more than half
of their units here, Gelber added.
The senate also approved a policy
that will allow up to 20 (up from six)
units of transfer credit for courses
not comparable to courses taught at
Stanford.
"Comparability of courses is a
problem because we have a quarter
system, whereas most other schools
operate on a semester system," Gel
ber said.
Units transferred from communi
ty colleges will now be treated in the
same way as units transferred from
other accredited institutions, Gelber
said.
"Because the number of units to
be taken at Stanford is increased to
90, treating community college units
as different no longer makes sense,"
she added.

Before garnering unanimous ap
proval, the community college poli
cy prompted some concern among
the senate members.
Physics Prof. Doug Osheroff
voiced doubts as to the rigor of
physics courses that undergraduates
frequently take outside the Univer
sity toward their premedical re
quirements.
Students welcomed the new poli
cy.

"I think that giv
ing students the
opportunity to
take courses such
as physics outside
of the University
adds flexibility to
their schedules,"
said senior Ben-

ton Fong, a biology major.
The senate also unanimously ap
proved two minor changes in the
grievance process for University fac
ulty and staff.
The revisions to the "Statement
on Academic Staff Grievance"
streamline the grievance procedure
to be followed by faculty by elimi
nating overlaps with the "Faculty
Grievance Procedures."
"There is no change of substance
here," Rice said. "We are trying to
get to one process for grievances
dealing with appointments, promo
tions and those having to do with
academic freedom."
The senate revised the "Academ
ic Staff Grievance Procedures," used
by lecturers and research associates,
to include a bO-day period during
which a decision on the grievance
application is to be made and to re
quire that the grievant begins the
process at a level above which the
original decision was made.
" These changes bring the acade
mic staff grievance process in line
with the faculty grievance process,"
Rice said.
University President Gerhard
Casper and Rice will initiate a
major evaluation of the grievance
procedures beginning in the sum
mer.
University Librarian Michael
Keller gave a report on Academic
Computing, discussing current ap
plications of computing at Stanford
and the prospects for new technolo
gy, including "Internet 2" to be tried
this summer.
