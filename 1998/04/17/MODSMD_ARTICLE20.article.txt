ASSU Spring General Elections
are nothing new. In fact, 20
years ago this week, three 4-
member slates ran for Stanford's Coun
cil of Presidents.
Council of Presidents was standard
from the late 1960s until the 19%, when
an amendment was passed creating the
current system of a single president. Bill
Shen was elected in the runoff election
that year.
Many issues in the 1978 COP cam
paign platforms are still relevant today.
Of particular concern at the time was
the shortage of student housing, espe
cially creating more space for graduate
students.
The COP slates were also concerned
with ending the University's corporate
investments in South Africa and pro
moting a meaningful dialogue to help

end apartheid.
One slate vowed to equalize options
for men and women by fighting for
sororities to return to campus. Another
slate supported the idea of reinstating a
Western Culture Requirement in order
to add structure in student academic
programs.
All slates emphasized the need for a
more effective advising system and for
professors who excel at teaching as well
as research.
Pronouncing academic advising a
failure, slates proposed creating new
peer advising programs and training
house associates (resident assistants) as
academic advisers.
All slates advised that teaching per
formance evaluations and effectiveness
as a faculty advisor be considered as
part of the tenure decision process.
