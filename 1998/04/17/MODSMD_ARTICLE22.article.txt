## Looting is the creative solution 
### 
Disaster is
lurking around
every palm tree
at Stanford. Hepatitis A
is alive and well. The sta
tistical probability of an
earthquake known only
as "The Big One" is

increasing everyday.
Alpha Sig will be inhabited by the Thetas in
less than 16() days. And El Nino rages on.
destroying what 1 thought was a sacred peri
od of fun, sun and bikinis.
While the apocalypse is not near, it could
be only a matter of days before a disaster of
serious magnitude strikes. And what is tra
ditionally at the top of everyone's list of
ways to cope with disaster? Looting.
Some may call it barbaric. I call it a great
social experiment in anarchy. And it is com
pletely justified.
All the money that gets dumped into
insurance companies needs to go some
where — either back into your pocket or to
the immense insurance collective which
nobody can seem to account for.
Looting is much more effective than so
called disaster cleanups. While the library
floods this year brought everyone together
in a time of need, I guarantee that double
the number of books would have been
saved if people were snatching them up out
of greed rather than concern. So step off
your moral high horse, fellow Stanford stu
dents — if there's a disaster, let's loot.
The first step in my looting plan is mak
ing a beeline for Tresidder Express. If,

somehow. I were able to cart off the entire
store on my back, there is only a slim chance
that I would be able to cut the losses I
incurred freshman year buying $2.79
Gatorades at that money pit.
Next stop — where else other than our
very own Stanford Bookstore? It is at this
point in my looting run that 1 would be
joined by a rambunctious mass of other
looting Stanford students.
First, we'd head down to the basement
rooster coop otherwise known as the course
texts area. Sixty dollar course readers. $75
used text books — theoretically we would
be making millions by raiding those shelves.
But please show me where, other than the
Stanford Bookstore, we can sell our new
texts for those prices.
Here's a paradox: if you were to bring
back all of the stolen books and sell them at
the buy back window, YOU WOULD
STILL LOSE MONEY. Don't ask me how,
you just would.
March up one level to Micro Disc, which
allegedly has reasonable prices — no one
should be spared in the grand chaos. Stop
off for some coffee on the top floor, charge
up and take home office supplies for life.
Finally, we would take some time to turn
our backsides to all of the security cameras,
give a full moon salute and say Stanford
Bookstore, rebate this.
Once Stanford's material possessions are
depleted, it's time to do some informational
looting. Into the inner chambers of the
Housing and Dining Service Office the loot
ing masses shall surge. We'll find out what

our dinners are paying for (a secret
brainwashing experiment, code name:
CIV), how Draw numbers are really
assigned (by your performance in freshman
dorm Assassin), and what the University's
long-term plan for graduate housing is
(renting out cubicles in Sweet Hall).
Invigorated hv these discoveries, we
press on — striking at Stanford's most
beloved treasures. To the bellows of
astounding alliteration and allegory by the
Meyer Library Man, The Thinker is
stripped off his pedestal and temporarily
relocated to a spacious handicrapper (a sin
gle-toilet, handicap-accessible bathroom) in
Twain. A vicious mob takes the Soto dog to
the Cowell Student Health Center and has
it neutered. The Axe is used to chop down
all of the bollards. Complete chaos at the
expense of local and national insurance
companies.
Please do not misunderstand me. If you
are next to a person who is injured in the
disaster which precedes this loot-fest, please
help him or her out first (unless it means
dropping some of your loot). Then continue
liquidating I res Ex of its Twinkie and Ding
Dong supply.
One more request: please spare the Cof
fee House. Despite the riffraff it seems to
draw into its dim chambers, it has this great
"buy one drink get four free specials" if you
know the right server to ask.

pronouncing the word "loot."
