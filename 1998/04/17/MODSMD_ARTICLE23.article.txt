Scoring rules promote
having female forwards
I must take issue with Jeff Andrews' sup
port of the IM soecer scoring advantage
rule that supposedly encourages the inclu
sion of women. At this point, forfeiting the
match when not fielding enough females
encourages their inclusion on teams. The
current rule, which counts a goal scored by
a woman as 1.5 goals, only encourages
women to play as forwards.
Woe to the team with an excellent
woman goalkeeper, creative midfielder and
tough marking fullback. Since these posi
tions don't score as much, they are at a dis
advantage to the team that plays only
female forwards. This discourages females
playing positions they're good at.
This can be rectified by tweaking the
rules slightly. A goal scored on a woman
goalkeeper is deducted by one-half goal. If
a male player dribbles past a female defend
er and scores, his goal is deducted by one
quarter goal. Any goal that is created by a
female player's assist is credited an addi
tional one-third coal.

However. I am not too sure what to do
about teams that adopt the strategy of pay
ing extra defensive attention to women for
wards to ensure that they don't score.
Of course if this is too complicated, the
IM rules committee can recognize that
every position in soccer is important to the
team, and stop capriciously changing the
jogo bonito.

Backing up files can save
careers and much hassle
The recent loss of crucial data by faculty
and students in the Graduate School of
Business should serve as a wake-up call to
all of us who depend on computers. Any
thing stored on a computer is at risk of
being lost at any time — through theft,
fUx>d or mechanical failure of a hard drive
or a cooling fan.
The only way to protect yourself is by
making regular backups of your data. Ciet a
tape drive or a Zip drive, and get into the
habit of usinuil. Stuff vou're working on all

the time — such as a dissertation — should
be backed up every day on a floppy.
Get enough tapes or disks so you'll
always have two or three separate backups.
That way, you won't risk having the com
puter go belly-up while you're in the middle
of writing a new backup on top of your only
old backup! And every so often, take a
backup and leave it with parents or friends.
If your apartment or dorm room is ran
sacked. gutted or turned into rubble by the
Big One, that "off-site" backup could save
your skin.
If everyone in the GSB had been doing
his or her own backups of his or her life's
work, the system failure — though still irk
some — wouldn't have endangered any
one's career.
