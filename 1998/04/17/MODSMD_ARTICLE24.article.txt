## Savoring those memorable first kisses 
### 
Jocelyn Wiener

I WAS INITIATED into the world of
kissing boys with a peck on the cheek hy
a 7- year-old named Nick in a hard-core
game of boys chase girls. The next kiss came
during a week-long camp, the summer after
seventh grade. Seven of us partook in that
convenient relative to Spin the Bottle: Spin
Anything in Sight. Passing around one
warm, pilfered can of beer and spinning
someone's cabin keys catalyzed the first kiss
of my adolescence. My second, third and
fourth came within the hour.
The fifth kiss was a near-miss from a 14-
year-old with a staring problem, and the
sixth came a year later from a camp coun
selor six years my senior. He professed to
have been "looking at the moon and the
stars every night and asking God what to
do." The seventh was offered awkwardly
and unintentionally in an airport goodbye.
These first eight or nine kisses helped me
save face in games of Truth or Dare at slum
ber parties. But it was not until age 16 that I
had what I consider to be my first, real kiss.
I met Joel in June, when 1 was visiting his
sister. Wrapped up as he was in playing with

his round, smiling 14-month-old brother, he
hardly noticed me at all. This, of course, is
why I liked him. As I have the remarkable
ability to keep amorous intentions to
myself, he was never informed that that
night marked the beginning of our
courtship.
But it did. Once, I spent the night at his
house after his sister, a second friend and I
got back late from a party. This other friend
and I were sitting in our pajamas in the liv
ing room when he tottered in. slightly drunk
and entirely shirtless. My friend whistled
under her breath, and I bit my lip to stem
the vast amounts of blood flowing to niv
cheeks.
Another time, I went over to his house
the day after I was told that he had frac
tured his ankle playing soccer. Mv cheeks
were burning from what I perceived to be
my typical passionate shyness (later I
learned that I had a 102 degree fever). I
walked the three blocks to his house with a
hand-drawn get well card carefully stored in
my back pocket. When I arrived, it sudden
ly seemed too childish a gil t to offer a young

man of IS.
That summer, 1 would go for long moon
lit strolls with a friend who had delightedly
pronounced me the first girl with whom he
shared a purely platonic friendship. How
good it was. we would both exclaim, to be so
uninhibited. But sometimes, when the sky
was embroidered with stars and we were
particularly lost, we would both fall quiet.
Those nights. I would imagine I was walking
with Joel.
It was not until August 7. 1994 that any
thing came of the tiptoeing love affair in my
head. That night, in a well-paired game of
hide-and-seek. Joel and I noticed the
game's high rate of attrition. We looked
around. On every park bench in sight, a dif
ferent couple had decided to avail them
selves of the romantic electricity in the sum
mer air. Joel looked at me. 1 looked at him.
We both looked at our hands.
When each human sculpture came out of
its embrace, we all walked home. It was Joel
who wrapped his arm around my waist, and
it was I who leaned in to indicate that I
didn't mind. It was Joel who suggested he

walk rne home, and it was I who suggested
that we take the long way. It was Joel who
suggested that a kiss would be nice, and it
was I who suggested that shadows from a
nearby tree would cloak the event in priva
cy.
In some respects it is difficult to be a
good kisser with your heart in your throat,
although in other ways it no doubt adds
intrigue to the art. Joel, noting my hesita
tion (though probably not realizing the
extent of my terror) took the matter into his
own hands. He closed my eyes, and he
closed his eyes. Therefore, no one was avail
able to watch me receive my first real kiss.
No one had the opportunity to view the
sheer confusion from which I suffered when
I realized that I didn't know how to come up
for air. No one saw me with arms hovering
in limbo because I could not figure out if
they belonged on his shoulders or on his
hair. And no one saw the way I stood, slow
ly relaxing my flattened position against
that tree.
The next morning, when I woke up. I
scrutinized mv face in the mirror for hint of

some physical alteration that would parallel
my psychological one. My eyes were still
hazel and my lips were still pink. I looked at
my arms and my legs. In an entirely unro
mantic twist, I discovered they were cov
ered with hives.
When my friends came to visit, they
exercised tactful restraint in queries of the
previous night's development. Upon analv
sis of my ridiculous dermatological debacle,
they did not see fit to keep silent. "You are
allergic to Joel!" I denied it. blushing fierce
ly. Ihe more logical perpetrator. I
explained, was an exotic fruit I had eaten
the day before.
But who knows Maybe hives are an
appropriate response to kisses that mean
too much, that are too anticipated, too
sweet or too long. Maybe my body was try
ing to tell me something significant. Bathed
in the saliva and tears of nostalgia, the rest
of me is. as of yet. unwilling to understand.
