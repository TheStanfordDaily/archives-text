## Waves pose challenge for Card 
### Michaela Crouch Staff writer 
After two weeks without a match
against a conference opponent, the
Stanford men's volleyball team de
fends of its title tomorrow with its
first postseason match.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal (15-7,
13-6 Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) will face off against third
ranked Pepperdine (18-4, 15-3
MPSF) tomorrow night in Malibu,
Calif.
" There wasn't going to be an easy
draw [in the MPSF tournament |, but
this is a really tough one," said Stan
ford head coach Ruben Nieves.
The Waves were the team that
snapped the Cardinal's seven-game
unbeaten streak that started its sea
son in a 3-1 defeat on Feb. 20 in
Maples Pavilion.
In that loss, the Cardinal em
ployed a strategy that it will likely

use again tomorrow — aggressive
serving. In the February match, the
strategy was not as effective as Stan
ford would have liked, with the team
racking up a whopping 39 service er
rors.

■ Saturday: No. 6 Stanford (15-7,13-
6 MPSF) at No. 3 Pepperdine (18-4
15-3) in first-round MPSF postsea
son tournament play.

This time, Stanford hopes to
serve more effectively and take ad
vantage of that possible weakness in
Pepperdine.
In a UCLA defeat of Pepperdine
last Friday, the Bruins were success
ful in using a similar strategy. Al
though it had 26 errors, it was able to
ace the Waves 11 times.
Pepperdine's serving strategy
will likely be much different. In the
UCLA match, the Waves had nine

service errors, but no aces.
"For the most part, they are
rather conservative with their serv
ing," Nieves said. "They don't like
taking big chances."
With an assertive service game,
Stanford looks to somewhat slow
Waves' junior outside hitter George
Roumain. With effective jump
serves, Roumain will be forced to
focus solely on attacking.
"Roumain is probably the best
player in the league," Nieves said,
"and probably the favorite candi
date for league and National Player
of the Year."
Roumain is currently the nation's
leader in kill average, with 7.39 per
game. In the team's last matchup
with the Cardinal, Roumain hit a
team-high 21 kills.
"Roumain is their main player
and we're going to look to stop him
as much as we can." said freshman
setter Brad Griffith.

Pepperdine runs a simpler of
fense than many of the nation's
teams, including Stanford's. Al
though Roumain is an amazing play
er, his impressive statistics are boost
ed by the Waves' simplicity, which
allows junior setter J.J. Riley to set
more balls to him.
According to Nieves, the simplic
ity of Pepperdine's offense makes it
easier to prepare for than other
teams.
"They have a more straightfor
ward offense to block and prepare
for," Nieves said. "Hut because they
keep it simple, there is less room for
error and confusion."
The Cardinal has recently been
putting numerous lineups on the
court, and in preparation for tomor
row's match, wants to keep its op
tions open, but also establish stabili

Freshman outside hitter Brett Youngberg bumps the ball last week
against Santa Cruz. The Card will look to Youngberg to add depth
and flavor to the lineup in tomorrow s battle against Pepperdine.
Stanford wants to make sure that
its hitters are comfortable with ei
ther of its setters, freshmen Griffith
and Josh L.ukens.
It also wants to ensure that play
ers feel comfortable with any combi
nation of its four primary outside
hitters — senior Devin Poolman. ju

Josh Palacios and Andy Witt.
"We're trying to increase flexibil

itv and comfort with any combina
tion of three of these four players,"
Nieves said. "We also can add [ju
nior middle blocker Jeremy] Bart or
[freshman outside hitter Brett]
Youngberg, but we really want to
try and stick with these four."
With the Cardinal now in its post
season. a loss means the end of its
season, but Stanford does not by any
means expect an early exit.
"The main thing is playing our
game." (Jriffith said. "And when we
do. we are one of the best teams in
