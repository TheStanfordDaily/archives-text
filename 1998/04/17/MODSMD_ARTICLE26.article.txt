# Softball's long, slow climb
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
A year ago, the Stanford softball team
found itself sitting in the Eugene, Oreg.,
airport after concluding its season by tak
ing three of four games from Oregon and
Oregon State.
The NCAA selection committee was
handing out berths that day, and the Car
dinal was hoping that a strong finish (Stan
ford won 11 of its final 16 games and fin
ished fifth in the Pacific 10 Conference)
would be enough to catapult it into the

postseason.
But as the team was waiting on its re
tum flight home, Pac-10 rival California
came through the terminal celebrating its
own selection to the tournament. And
painfully, it was the Bears who broke the
news. The selection committee had opted
to take Arizona State over Stanford de
spite the fact that the Sun Devils finished
behind the Card in the Pac-10 and closed
its season by losing 16 of its final 19 games.
"That's just no respect," said junior
pitcher Becky Blevins. "They take a team
that's on a 10-eame losini> streak: we were

on a total winning streak. 1 don't ever want
to sit in the airport again and have coach
tell us we can't go because that feeling is
awful."
That was a feeling that most of the play
ers haven't been able to forget, and it's
been part of the motivation that's guided
the Card to its first national ranking and a
28-9 record.
But that's just one example in a long
line of incidents that have propelled the
Cardinal from the depths of losing seasons

The Stanford softball program has come a long way since the home games at Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale. The Card is
having its best season ever, and is ranked in the top 25 in the nation for the first time.
