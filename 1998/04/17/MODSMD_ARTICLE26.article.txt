# Softball's long, slow climb
## 
### Robin Davidson Senior staff writer 
A year ago, the Stanford softball team
found itself sitting in the Eugene, Oreg.,
airport after concluding its season by tak
ing three of four games from Oregon and
Oregon State.
The NCAA selection committee was
handing out berths that day, and the Car
dinal was hoping that a strong finish (Stan
ford won 11 of its final 16 games and fin
ished fifth in the Pacific 10 Conference)
would be enough to catapult it into the

postseason.
But as the team was waiting on its re
tum flight home, Pac-10 rival California
came through the terminal celebrating its
own selection to the tournament. And
painfully, it was the Bears who broke the
news. The selection committee had opted
to take Arizona State over Stanford de
spite the fact that the Sun Devils finished
behind the Card in the Pac-10 and closed
its season by losing 16 of its final 19 games.
"That's just no respect," said junior
pitcher Becky Blevins. "They take a team
that's on a 10-eame losini> streak: we were

on a total winning streak. 1 don't ever want
to sit in the airport again and have coach
tell us we can't go because that feeling is
awful."
That was a feeling that most of the play
ers haven't been able to forget, and it's
been part of the motivation that's guided
the Card to its first national ranking and a
28-9 record.
But that's just one example in a long
line of incidents that have propelled the
Cardinal from the depths of losing seasons

The Stanford softball program has come a long way since the home games at Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale. The Card is
having its best season ever, and is ranked in the top 25 in the nation for the first time.
to its best record ever and a third
place spot in the conference that is
considered softball's toughest.
The Stanford Softball program of
ficially got its start as a varsity sport in
the spring of 1994. Sandy Pearce was
in her first year at the helm of the pro
gram, and the Card did not play a
Pac-10 schedule, maintaining inde
pendent status from the conference
and struggling to a 5-28 record.
That's a far cry from where Stan
ford is now, as the program has gone
from almost nothing to a genuine
contender in just five short seasons.
"It's unbelievable because I know
it's going to keep getting better," said
junior tri-captain Michelle Schnei
der. "The first time we saw our rank
ings, there was just such a sense of
pride. Being at Stanford you want to
know that you can compete national
ly like all the other programs."
The Club Years
But to find the true beginnings of
Stanford Softball, you have to go
back a lot further than 1994. The pro
gram was started in 1980 as a club
sport, and functioned in the same
manner as other club sports for most
of the '80s, playing games on Roble
field and doing most of its own fund
raising.
"It was a really tough situation in
those early years," said Asst. Athlet
ic Director Shirley School. "They
wanted to be varsity so badly they
were willing to give up everything
else. You'd go watch a game, and
they were really lucky in a double
header to get one hit. You see them
plav today, and it's hard to believe it's
the same game."
School"s records do not show soft
ball as a club sport for the 1985 and
1986 seasons, and this is exactly
where the history of the program gets
muddled.
The team wavered between club
and varsity status until 1994. and ac
cording to Stanford alumna Kathy
Bowers, Class of '86. the program
was varsity in name only during her
final two seasons.
"We were actually varsity level
with no funding." Bowers said. "We
played a Pac-10 schedule those two
and theC'Y><iid for us'fo fr^^et. 1
But we had no scholarships. We
didn't win many games."
Bowers did recall a lone Pac-10
win during those seasons, a 1 -0 victo
ry over Arizona, but for the most part
the team struggled against more tal
ented competition.
"We didn't win very much, but we
had so much fun." Bowers said. "You
don't have bitter memories. We al
ways said with 10 or 15 years'experi
ence [Stanford] was going to be a
power in Softball."
But after Bowers' senior season,
the program returned to club status.
Club records for the sport end with
the spring of 1991, but the varsity
records don't officially pick up until
1994, leaving two seasons of Stanford
softball up in the air.
As it turns out. the program was
once again considered a varsity sport,
but was not funded. Hank Wallace
was the head coach, and the team
played one more year on Roble field

before moving to El ( amino Park
across from the Stanford Shopping
Center.
The team played one season as an
independent and one more in the
Pac-10. Conference opponents de
stroyed the less-talented Cardinal,
and stories of 30-run losses during
that time aren't exaggerated.
"There were doubts if it was even
going to last," Wallace said. "But it
was an experience I probably
wouldn't trade for anything because I
feel gix>d about what the program
has done now. If those other players
hadn't kept going, maybe this pro
gram wouldn't be where it is."
The Rebirth
In his final season as the softball
coach, Wallace had one-and-a-half
scholarships with which to recruit for
the 1994 season. The Athletics De
partment started the softball pro
gram on a track that would have it
fully funded by the 1999 season, and
Pearce took over the coaching duties.
The team finished with a 5-28 record,
recording its first win over Santa
Clara.
"Our uniforms didn't even
match," said Amanda Renteria, a
1997 graduate and four-year mem
ber of the team. "We'd get hand-me
downs from the basketball team. Lit
tle things like that hurt your confi
dence. but you learn what kind of
people are behind the uniforms and
the losing records."
After a one-year reprieve, Stan
ford rejoined the Pac-10 for the 1995
season and had to face the kind of
competition that has won the last 10
NCAA championships. Senior pitch
er Jessica Sehulman entered the pro
gram as the first lull scholarship play
er in its history.
"You would go out and know you
were going to lose," Sehulman said.
"If you played a team 5-3 you were
like. 'Yeah! We lost, hut wo only lost
by two!'"
Sometimes games got so bad that
opposing teams would leave base
early to give Stanford outs and end
the game so the squad wouldn't miss
its flight home.
"We visited Stanford when my
brother was looking at schools so I
was maybe a freshman in high
schiH>l." Sehulman said. "We were
driving by HI Camino, and we saw a
frtlWpl;fvhS^ v >Y» we went out there. It
was Stanford's team, and it was hor
rendous. My bobby-socks team
could've beaten them.
"1 knew that softball-wise, coming
here was going to be really frustrat
ing. But looking at the other
women's sports at Stanford. I knew
that if the Athletics Department put
time and energy into softball, it
would be successful."
Stanford did get its first confer
ence win that year, beating Oregon
State 9-5. That was the Card's only
Pac-10 win all year as a 1-27 confer
ence mark didn't show much im
provement. But the 15 wins overall,
coupled with the increased level of
competition, revealed the baby steps
the program was beginning to take.
Even with that progress, the pro
gram had a long way to go. Games
were still being played at El Camino,
where the lack of an outfield fence
left plenty of room for teams like
UCLA and Arizona to test their

long-range capabilities.
" They'd be around the bases, and
we'd still be waiting on the ball to
come back in," Kenteria said. "Play
ing on a team like that, the focus is
different. You have to enjoy being
with each other; you have to enjoy
the sport. That's the only thing you
have."
Moving on up
The 1995 season saw the signing
of seven recruits, and the outlook for
1996 was bright. The team had hoped
to have its own field that year, but in
stead the ( ard played home games at
Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale.
Hut even without a field of its
own. the 19% season marked a shift
for the program. For the first time the
team had more scholarship players
than walk-ons. The ("ardinal finished
24-29 and added conference wins
over Oregon, Arizona State and Cal
to its list of first-time accomplish
ments.
"Getting respect in the Pac-10 is
tough to do," said junior second base
man Jennie Foyle. "We've done a
good job of it, and now teams don't
want to play us instead of being excit
ed that they can come out and kill
us."
The win over Cal came in the
Card's final doubleheaderof the sea
son and marked a transition into a
whole new era of Stanford softball.
Last season the Card got a new field
and a new coach and posted the pro
gram's first winning record (31 -27-1).
earning victories over powerhouses
IJCLA and Washington.
Head coach John Rittnian came
to the Farm after four seasons as an
assistant coach at Washington, dur
ing which time the 1 luskies garnered
a No. 1 ranking, a Pac-10 champi
onship and a second-place finish at
the College World Series.
The momentum from the Card's
strong finish in 1997 has carried over
into a hugely successful 1 99,S cam
paign. The early part of the season
was distinguished by an 11 -game win
streak, and with four weeks left in the
season. Stanford is seemingly headed
for the program's first postseason ap
pearance.
"This team has developed an atti
tude that they're going to do it,"
Rittman said. "They've almost been
on a mission. They're just driven to
ward the same goal, and when you
get 16 people pushing the rock up the
hill it makes it a lot easier."
When the regular season ends this
year, the Cardinal won't be at the air
port, and the NCAA selection com
mittee won't overlook the team's ac
complishments. Hut what's more,
when the current players graduate
and join the players from over a
decade ago, they'll do it knowing
they took a program that was barely
noticeable just five years ago to an
unprecedented level of success.
"I'll look back and say we went
from practically a club sport to a (top
program)," Schneider said. "1 will
definitely have a sense of pride that I
helped build that, and I won't see the
frustrations. I'm going to leave here
with such a completely different feel
ing because I'm going to see a com
plete turnaround in the program,
which is probably one of the most ex
citing things you can experience as an
athlete."

Pac-10 win all year as a 1-27 confer

coupled with the increased level of
competition, revealed the baby steps
the program was beginning to take.
Even with that progress, the pro

were still being played at El Camino,

A year ago, the Stanford softball team
found itself sitting in the Eugene, Oreg.,
airport after concluding its season by tak
ing three of four games from Oregon and
Oregon State.
The NCAA selection committee was
handing out berths that day, and the Car
dinal was hoping that a strong finish (Stan
ford won 11 of its final 16 games and fin
ished fifth in the Pacific 10 Conference)
would be enough to catapult it into the

postseason.
But as the team was waiting on its re
tum flight home, Pac-10 rival California
came through the terminal celebrating its
own selection to the tournament. And
painfully, it was the Bears who broke the
news. The selection committee had opted
to take Arizona State over Stanford de
spite the fact that the Sun Devils finished
behind the Card in the Pac-10 and closed
its season by losing 16 of its final 19 games.
"That's just no respect," said junior
pitcher Becky Blevins. "They take a team
that's on a 10-eame losini> streak: we were

on a total winning streak. 1 don't ever want
to sit in the airport again and have coach
tell us we can't go because that feeling is
awful."
That was a feeling that most of the play
ers haven't been able to forget, and it's
been part of the motivation that's guided
the Card to its first national ranking and a
28-9 record.
But that's just one example in a long
line of incidents that have propelled the
Cardinal from the depths of losing seasons

The Stanford softball program has come a long way since the home games at Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale. The Card is
having its best season ever, and is ranked in the top 25 in the nation for the first time.
to its best record ever and a third
place spot in the conference that is
considered softball's toughest.
The Stanford Softball program of
ficially got its start as a varsity sport in
the spring of 1994. Sandy Pearce was
in her first year at the helm of the pro
gram, and the Card did not play a
Pac-10 schedule, maintaining inde
pendent status from the conference
and struggling to a 5-28 record.
That's a far cry from where Stan
ford is now, as the program has gone
from almost nothing to a genuine
contender in just five short seasons.
"It's unbelievable because I know
it's going to keep getting better," said
junior tri-captain Michelle Schnei
der. "The first time we saw our rank
ings, there was just such a sense of
pride. Being at Stanford you want to
know that you can compete national
ly like all the other programs."
The Club Years
But to find the true beginnings of
Stanford Softball, you have to go
back a lot further than 1994. The pro
gram was started in 1980 as a club
sport, and functioned in the same
manner as other club sports for most
of the '80s, playing games on Roble
field and doing most of its own fund
raising.
"It was a really tough situation in
those early years," said Asst. Athlet
ic Director Shirley School. "They
wanted to be varsity so badly they
were willing to give up everything
else. You'd go watch a game, and
they were really lucky in a double
header to get one hit. You see them
plav today, and it's hard to believe it's
the same game."
School"s records do not show soft
ball as a club sport for the 1985 and
1986 seasons, and this is exactly
where the history of the program gets
muddled.
The team wavered between club
and varsity status until 1994. and ac
cording to Stanford alumna Kathy
Bowers, Class of '86. the program
was varsity in name only during her
final two seasons.
"We were actually varsity level
with no funding." Bowers said. "We
played a Pac-10 schedule those two
and theC'Y><iid for us'fo fr^^et. 1
But we had no scholarships. We
didn't win many games."
Bowers did recall a lone Pac-10
win during those seasons, a 1 -0 victo
ry over Arizona, but for the most part
the team struggled against more tal
ented competition.
"We didn't win very much, but we
had so much fun." Bowers said. "You
don't have bitter memories. We al
ways said with 10 or 15 years'experi
ence [Stanford] was going to be a
power in Softball."
But after Bowers' senior season,
the program returned to club status.
Club records for the sport end with
the spring of 1991, but the varsity
records don't officially pick up until
1994, leaving two seasons of Stanford
softball up in the air.
As it turns out. the program was
once again considered a varsity sport,
but was not funded. Hank Wallace
was the head coach, and the team
played one more year on Roble field

before moving to El ( amino Park
across from the Stanford Shopping
Center.
The team played one season as an
independent and one more in the
Pac-10. Conference opponents de
stroyed the less-talented Cardinal,
and stories of 30-run losses during
that time aren't exaggerated.
"There were doubts if it was even
going to last," Wallace said. "But it
was an experience I probably
wouldn't trade for anything because I
feel gix>d about what the program
has done now. If those other players
hadn't kept going, maybe this pro
gram wouldn't be where it is."
The Rebirth
In his final season as the softball
coach, Wallace had one-and-a-half
scholarships with which to recruit for
the 1994 season. The Athletics De
partment started the softball pro
gram on a track that would have it
fully funded by the 1999 season, and
Pearce took over the coaching duties.
The team finished with a 5-28 record,
recording its first win over Santa
Clara.
"Our uniforms didn't even
match," said Amanda Renteria, a
1997 graduate and four-year mem
ber of the team. "We'd get hand-me
downs from the basketball team. Lit
tle things like that hurt your confi
dence. but you learn what kind of
people are behind the uniforms and
the losing records."
After a one-year reprieve, Stan
ford rejoined the Pac-10 for the 1995
season and had to face the kind of
competition that has won the last 10
NCAA championships. Senior pitch
er Jessica Sehulman entered the pro
gram as the first lull scholarship play
er in its history.
"You would go out and know you
were going to lose," Sehulman said.
"If you played a team 5-3 you were
like. 'Yeah! We lost, hut wo only lost
by two!'"
Sometimes games got so bad that
opposing teams would leave base
early to give Stanford outs and end
the game so the squad wouldn't miss
its flight home.
"We visited Stanford when my
brother was looking at schools so I
was maybe a freshman in high
schiH>l." Sehulman said. "We were
driving by HI Camino, and we saw a
frtlWpl;fvhS^ v >Y» we went out there. It
was Stanford's team, and it was hor
rendous. My bobby-socks team
could've beaten them.
"1 knew that softball-wise, coming
here was going to be really frustrat
ing. But looking at the other
women's sports at Stanford. I knew
that if the Athletics Department put
time and energy into softball, it
would be successful."
Stanford did get its first confer
ence win that year, beating Oregon
State 9-5. That was the Card's only
Pac-10 win all year as a 1-27 confer

provement. But the 15 wins overall,
