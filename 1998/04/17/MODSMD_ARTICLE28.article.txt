It wasn't a little more than a month ago
when these two teams last met. With the fifth
ranked team in the nation traveling to
Sunken Diamond to face the nation's pre
miere team, the series was predicted to test
just how strong the Stanford Cardinal would
be this season.

Still the top team in collegiate baseball
over five weeks later. No. 1 Stanford (31-6-1.
14-4 Pacific 10 Southern Conference) arrived
in Tucson in style last night. The classy Cardi
nal. traveling in suits and ties, begin a three
game series tonight with the now unranked
Arizona Wildcats (28-18.8-13).
"They've gone through a dry spell." said
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess of the
Wildcats. "They've struggled, but they are
(still) a veteran team."
This veteran team, which won 16 of the
first 17 games of the season, now finds itself
fifth in the conference and struggling to have
a chance at postseason play. Losing 12 of the
14 games that followed their series at Stan
ford. the Wildcats have but three more con

ference series to turn things arounu.
"They realize ihey need to win at the end."
Marquess said. "(Then) they might have a
chance for postseason. They'll he all pumped
to play us."
Playing in its last home series of the sea
son. Arizona will have to face a Stanford
team that has been pumped up since day one.
The Cardinal, on a three-game winning
streak, hopes to contain the Wildcats with its
powerful pitching, but may have to turn on
the offense to beat an Arizona team batting
.337.
"We just need to continue to pitch well.
Normally, though, when you play at Arizona,
one of the games has to be a slugfest." Mar
quess said. "They're very tough to beat there
— it's a hitters' ballpark."
Stanford should fare just fine, considering
its hitting hasn't exactly been struggling. On a
10-game hitting streak, sophomore first base
man John Gall now leads the team with a .393
average, as well as in the RBI category with
45.
"John |C»all] has been really swinging the
bat well." Marquess said. "The huge thing for
us is that we don't always have to depend on
the same guys."
With seven of Stanford's nine starters hit
ting over .300. the better question is who isn't
hitting the ball well. Freshman designated
hitter Joe Borchard. batting .357. and senior
shortstop Jay Pecci. batting .342. also plan to
try and test the "hitters' ballpark."
At the same time. Stanford's pitching has
been fairly consistent recently. With a 1.80
ERA. junior Jeff Austin (9-1) takes the
mound tonight to meet Wildcat
James Johnson (5-3, 4.(51). Coming
off of his first loss of the season in
last week's game with Cal, Austin is
currently tied for eighth on the all

time Stanford strikeout list at 27(1.
Losing junior pitcher Rob Sha
banskv the Wildcats leader in
wins and ERA last season — to in
jury. Arizona will be forced to turn
to Johnson and sophomore Ton\
Milo (7-3. 5.98) to shut down the
Cardinal. The Wildcats, however
have a team FRA of 6.18. as op

posed to Stanford s conference
leading ERA of 3.70.
Tomorrow's game, with junioi
Chad Hutchinson (7-2. 4.85) facing
Milo. will be played at 7 p.m. rathei
than the normal afternoon game
due to the Arizona heat. The serie*
will conclude with a 1 p.m. game or
