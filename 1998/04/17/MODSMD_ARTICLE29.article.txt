Revenge will be on the mind of the top
ranked Cardinal this weekend as No. 14
UCLA, the only team to defeat the Stanford
women's tennis team this season, comes to
Taube Family Tennis Stadium for a rematch
of the 5-4 Bruin upset victory two weeks ago
in Los Angeles.
Stanford (21-1 overall. 9-1 Pacific 10
Conference) hosts No. 21 CSC (11-8. 3-3)
today and No. 16 UCLA (14-8. 8-3) tomor
row to close out the regular season and com
plete its bid for yet another Pac-10 title.
Just two weeks ago. the Bruins shocked
Stanford and the rest of the women's tennis
world by beating the undefeated, defending
national champions. The Cardinal, who ad
mitted to not being up for the match, will be
looking to get back at the Bruins at home.
"We are looking forward to this weekend
for a lot of reasons." said Stanford head
coach Frank Brennan. "These are the last
regular season dual matches, and we are
anxious to get back at UCLA."
But Brennan warned that his sqund
would not be overlooking USC, the team
that the Cardinal blanked 6-0 in singles two
days after the UCLA loss.
"We have to get by USC first." Brennan
said. "They are better than they seem. They
have talent, but they have been lacking the
chemistry. The goal is to get through USC
and then really do a job in our last regular
season match of the year."
Despite the Friday match against USC.
the weekend's top billing certainly is Satur

day's match against the Bruins. who took
advantage of a droopy Stanford squad two
weeks ago.
"We were flat as a pancake, for whatever
reason." Brennan said. "1 didn't think they
played particularly well, but they took ad
vantage of our poor performance. It was one
of those coaching nightmares. Everything
went wrong at the same time."
