Two of the five presidential tick
ets — Matt Spence and Hianca
Ling, and Maren Norton and San
tos Marroquin will continue to
campaign. The runoff election is
scheduled for Thursday and Friday

next week.

uate students had cast their

of students voting. Norton narrowly
slipped into the runoff election with
856 votes.
Remaining candidates were ju
niors Mike Martinez and Matt Louie
with 7 l )8 votes, sophomores Matt
Crystal and Jonathan Lot/ with 583
votes, and juniors Lisa Liao and
Loren Demeroutis with 382 votes.
"I'm really excited." Spence said.
"Bianca and I worked really hard."
Norton was at a similar level of
nervous energy.
"1 came in with a lot of butterflies
in my stomach, and I'm going out
with a lot more," she said.
"1 can't even think straight. I'm
humbled, honored — all of the
above," Norton added.
Their running mates were also
thrilled. "It was close," Ling said.
"All of the slates put up strong cam
paigns. We're really happy we made

it into the runoff."
Murroquin expressed his original
scare when the numbers were read
off. "I can't believe she said 5(H)."
Current ASSU President Emily
Andrus had at first misread Norton
and Marroquin's received votes as
numbering in the 5(X)s.
Presidential candidates must re
ceive at least 50 percent of the total
vote to gain office. With Spence's
29.24 percent and Norton's 22.33 per
cent. next week's runoff will likely be
a tight race.
"Because the vote was so split. I
think the runoff vote will be more
representative of what the student
body really wants." Marroquin said.
Spence preferred to withhold
comment on the runoff. "We'll see in
a week." he said.
Liao was gracious to the winners.
"We're pleased with who are in the
runoff," she said. As to the eventual
winners, she was also reticent. "1
don't like to say." Liao said.
The logistics of the runoff election

will likely be finalized this weekend.
"We need to spend a few hours look
ing at the bylaws the provisions
that are necessary for the runoff,"
said sophomore Dan Perkel, the elec
tions commissioner.
Last year's presidential election
did not require a runoff, with Andrus
and current Vice President Ben
Decker narrowly earning a majority
of votes.
Asst. Elections Commissioner
Noshua Watson said. "Today has
been an extremely long day."
"We each picked which one of our
classes we were going to go to each
day," Watson said exasperatedlv.
The majority of the votes in the
election were received electronically.
There were only 200 to 250 paper
votes compared to the 3.5(H) to 3,6(X)
total undergraduate votes, Watson
said.
Students had the choice of voting
over the World Wide Web or on a
traditional paper ballot at various
spots across campus.
