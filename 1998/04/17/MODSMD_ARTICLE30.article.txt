In its last game before the Western Regional
Qualifiers, the second-ranked Stanford women's
water polo team (22-4) takes on IJC-Davis (15-
11) Sunday. I he Cardinal is currently ranked be
hind I'(LA.
Stanford and Davis last met in Honolulu,
Hawaii at the Aloha Classic tournament, hosted
by the University of Hawaii. In that match, the

Card came out ahead 9-8. Earlier in the season,
Stanford defeated Davis 9-1 at the Santa Barbara
tournament.
"We're still training and working hard on con
ditioning and refining our skills," said sophomore
F.lissa keszler. "We're going to approach the
Davis game like all other games. We're going to
try to execute our game plan and play with com
posure and skill."
One of Stanford's biggest strengths this season
has been its incredible depth and the effective

way the team functions as a unit.
"I've never been on a team that's closer than
this one," Keszler said.
Sophomore Aloha Jamais, who is recovering
from shoulder surgery, said, "Everyone is togeth
er. We're all there, all focusing on the same goal
— even the injured people go to the practices."
The Cardinal squad has been steadily fine
tuning its skills throughout the season under the
guidance of head coach John Tanner and assis
tant coach Susan Ortwein. Tanner was recently
named Coach of the Year for the Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation.
"[Tanner] has a great knowledge of the game
and he's a brilliant coach," Keszler said. "He's
done a really good job with the team."
"The team is looking great," Jamais said. "The
different types of defense we're using are starting
to gel together. On offense, we're more aware of
the openings and opportunities. The team is ex
actly where we want to be."

WOMEN'S WATER POLO

■ Sunday: No. 2 Stanford (22-4) at UC-Davis (15-
11), 1 p.m.

The Stanford team is keeping its focus on na
tionals. The biggest obstacle standing in the way
of winning the national title for the Card is the
formidable UCLA squad, which is still undefeat
ed this season.
But Stanford only lost to the Bruins by two
goals at last weekend's MPSF championships, so
an upset at nationals is a distinct possibility.
"The Davis game is another step towards na
tionals," Keszler said. "Honestly, I think that
we're going to beat UCLA. Every time we play
them, we get better. We're going to do it at na
tionals."
The national championships will be held at
USC this year. Next weekend Regional Quali
fiers will determine which teams from the West
ern region will receive berths in the final tourna
ment.
