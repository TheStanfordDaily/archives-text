Stanford's top-ranked men's
tennis team closes out its regular
season play in Los Angeles this
weekend. II history holds true, this
road trip will present the biggest
challenge yet for the defending
champions.
Eighth-ranked IJ( LA (13-6. 6-4
Pacific 10 Conference) and No. 9
USC (15-5, 6-4 Pac-10) were no
match for the Cardinal earlier this
year. Neither team managed to
score a single point against Stan
ford. but that was when the Card
had homecourt advantage.
Although Stanford swept both
teams early this month, USC and
UCLA came as close as any team to
taking a bite out of Stanford's stel
lar singles record.
UCLA in particular gave the
Cardinal a run for its money when
its squad came to the Taube Family
Tennis Stadium. In each singles
match except for one. the Bruin
players pushed at least one set to
seven games or forced a third set.
Head coach Dick Gould said the
matches against the Trojans and the

Bruins will be a test of the Card's
mettle.
"It's going to be a real challenge
this weekend." (iould said. "Since
I've been coach. I think we've
swept the LA schools only three
times in the last 32 years, and two of
those seasons, we've gone unde
feated."

Stanford has maintained an in
credible undefeated record this sea
son (22-0. 10-0 Pac-10). losing onl\
one out of 126 singles matches this
year. Each of Stanford's six starting
singles players is ranked in the top
75 in the nation, and two of the
team's doubles pairs are ranked in
the top 10.
With top players such as No. 10
Vince Allegre and No. 12 Jean-Noel
Cirinda playing for U( LA and 26th
ranked George Hast 1 playing for
USC, neither team is going to walk

away quietly this weekend.
I he Bruins and the Trojans are
coming off Pac-1() competition.
Both teams had close matches
against Washington last weekend
UCLA lost to the Huskies and
I JSC' came away with a win — and
both rebounded for a victory
against the Ducks.
With Stanford being the only
clear leader in the conference, the
Pac-10 teams are still fighting for
standings.
Senior captain Paul Goldstein,
who will be playing his last regular
season matches for Stanford this
weekend, said he could not antici
pate the outcome of this weekend's
matches.
"It has been incredibly difficult
to sweep US( and IJCLA in the
past, even in our undefeated sea
sons." Goldstein said. "I'm really
looking forward to the matches
down there. Both teams really need
a win. and they're going to come
out guns bla/ing.
"They have nothing to lose, but
then again, neither do we."
The Card will take on USC
today at 1:30 p.m. and UCLA to
