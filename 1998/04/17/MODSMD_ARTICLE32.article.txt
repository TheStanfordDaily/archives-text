# Frisbee heads to sectionals
## 
### Will Chang Contributing writer 
The Ultimate Frisbee sectionals,
which will be hosted by Laspositas
College Sunday, will be the first step
toward a possible repeat national
final appearance by both the men's
and women's teams.
The tournament will be held in a
round robin with each game lasting
one-and-a-half to two hours and 20-
minute breaks in between. Only five
teams can qualify to move on to the
Regional Championships, which is
the precursor to Nationals.
The men's team, which is current
ly ranked second in the nation by the
Ultimate Players Association, enter
the tournament as the heavy favorite.
While qualifying for the Regional
( hampionships is not an issue for the
Card, coming out undefeated and
No. 1 is important for the rankings
and seeding for the Regional Cham
pionships.
"We want to approach the tour
nament one game at a time." said se
nior captain Alex Young. "It is im
portant for us to really play well this
weekend so we can carry the mo
mentum over to the Regional ( ham
pionships."
Even though the men's team has
lots of veteran players returning this

year, gelling with the new rookies has
been the biggest obstacles the team
has faced. The team has been able to
deliver the only two defeats to top
ranked Santa Barbara this year, yet
they have lost to much lower-ranked
teams such as Harvard.

ULTIMATE FRISBEE

■ Sunday: I Jltimate Frisbee section
als at Laspositas College.

"Inconsistency is one ol the weak
nesses we need to work on." Young
said. "It really shows at long weekend
tournaments where we have to play
over seven games — and that is w hat
Nationals will be like."
The men's team will be entering
the tournament with the traditional
"Stanford Stack" strategv. along with
new zone strategies which the ( ard's
opponents w ill not be expecting.
The Stanford women's team is en
tering the tournament as the top
ranked team in the I Itimate Players
Association. Stanford has alread\
won both the Eastern and the Stan
ford Invitationals this season.
The team already has their eyes
set on the Regional Championships.
The Stanford women are expected to
blow out the competition and earn a
top seed for the regionals.
" The sectionals are onl\ impor-

tant symbolically, since it is the first
step toward the nationals." said se
nior Jo\ Miyahira. "We are going to
use it to re-evaluate the team and
iron out an\ last-minute problems."
Even though the women's team is
divided evenly this year between
rtx>kies and veterans, gelling has not
been a problem. While last year's
team featured many big superstar
names in Ultimate, this season's
team has surprising depth. Every one
on the team gets playing time and ex
perience. That is the Card's biggest
advantage. Durint: long tourna
ments. the bench can be expected to
step up and cam the team past weak
er opponents.
"We have many strengths this
year." said junior Man Hunt Martin.
"Our power lies in the zone offense
We do still have some kinks to work
out. such as slow momentum in the
beginning of games, hut this is the
closest team I have ever seen. We
have fun together and we never get
sick of each other."
While the team is the heavy fa
vorite to win. it is expecting chal
lenges along the way from nsine
teams such as Oregon. California,
and I ( -Santa Barbara.
"We are really confident, but vu
are nervous in that confidence."
Martin said.
