Q: What do the Stanford Police do with their time?


"Rob the parking meters."


"Practice performing body
cavity searches on each
other."


"They pump the bass and
cruise down Mayfield, to be
cool like me, Jon Wagner,
the coolest guy around."


"They don't help me out
when my car's blocked, 24
hours a day."


"On me."
