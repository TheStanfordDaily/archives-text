## ASSU campaigns fined for being stupid 
### 
The Crazy Angry Man in White Plaza

As an angry fictional creation, I am
at best an angry composite of other
angry people. But that does not mean my
message is not real.
The following are the fines that
Jodie Foster asked me to impose on the
ASSU campaigns for improper inanity.
The ASSU has offfended her, and they
will pay. The divinities who gave me this
proclamation wish it to be known that all
campaigners are equally odious; but
some must be made examples so that
humanity can learn.
I n fr a ction: * £ u r post?fy * seeking an ASSIJ
office when there are better things to do
with your life, like ending it.
Guilty: All candidates.
Penalty: Death.
Infraction: Using a crappy advertising as
a catch phrase for your crappy ASSU

campaign.
Guilty: Luke Avila for "Yo quiero
Luke." As if the "Yo quiero Taco Bell"
campaign wasn't annoying enough. Luke
Avila is also the winner of best pun on
the words "Taco Bell."
1 am certain there are worse out
there, but I didn't have the misfortune of
seeing them, thanks to the Almighty
Burger Cheese.
Infraction: Desperation for a catchy slo
gan, resulting in a forced monkey pun.
Guilty: Clara Chan, for her poster saying
1 1 -J I « j j W * I
"Stop monkeying around, [picture of
monkey] Vote for Clara Chan." Rabid
monkeys shall descend on your home
and destroy your family.
Infraction: Using bad puns to annoy me.
Guilty: Jenny Moon for writing "Hey,
I'm not promising the stars. But I will

touch the moon"; Elsa Jacobsen for
"Who Elsa you gonna vote for?" God
dammit! There are too many others!
You'll all pay, do you hear me?
You won't know where or when, but
when I find you, I shall stare at you with
such ferocity and think such violent
thoughts that maybe your head will
explode. Or at least you will feel uncom
fortable and leave the room. Ha ha!
Infraction: Using the "now we've got
your attention" ploy, also to annoy me.
Guilty: There are actually two this year,
BOOYAH! and THE FUN sQUAD. I
will not comment about the names of
these slates and in fact, all the names of
all the slates. Especially the hyperorigi
nal "Absolut FOURplay."
Hey, we're in college, we drink,
yeah! And hey, there are four of us, let's
think of a clever name that uses the word

"four" in a clever sexual innuendo that
no one has ever thought up before, and
certainly has never, ever used in an
ASSU campaign! And in another cam
paign: Hey guys, if you take off the U,
ASSU spells ASS!
I bet no one in the history of the uni
verse has been so clever! Text cannot
communicate pain with proper force. To
imagine it, strike yourself in the forehead
with a hammer.
Infraction: Being what they should
detest.
Guilty: The Chappie. Once they ran in
jest, now they run in earnest. Oh, whith
er have you wandered, dear Chappie?
Infraction: Pretending to be political by
using the phrase "focus on the issues."
Guilty: Everyone. Look, there are no
real issues. Except that the cheese indus-

try will gain political hegemony if we
allow its merger with that girl who can
set things on fire with her mind.
Infraction: Claiming you will make the
ASSU accountable to students.
Guilty: Everyone and their goddammed
orthopedist. Students don't want the
ASSU to be accountable to them. They
just want it to go away. Preferably in a
large explosion that could be recorded
and then played in reverse, because that
would look really cool.
Infraction: Drilling into my head with its
proboscis.
Guilty: The beetle that lives on my back.
Off, vile one!
YAAAARRRRRRGGGHH!

rest of the world is slanted.
