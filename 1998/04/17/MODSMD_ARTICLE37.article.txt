Dear Diversions Editors,
I think the above column is
offensive and degrading. The ASSU
provides valuable services to its stu
dents, none of which I can name off
the top of my head. We should be
thanking those brave young men
and women who put so much time
and effort into their resumes, and
not, as you suggest, kill these people.
Violence is never funny, unless it is a
man being hit in the crotch. Whoa, is
that a hootananny!
For The Daily, it appears, the
rabid monkey is mightier than the
pen.

Dear Diversions Editors,
I don't think it's fair for you to
pick on certain campaigns, when
clearly, they all should he con
demned. But I guess that's the prob
lem with limited space, and I guess if
you run for ASSU, you've got it
coming. Especially if your campaign
is a mere clone of every other cam
paign, like every campaign always is.
Never mind. Diversions Editors.

Dear Diversion Editors,
I object to the lack of space that
my letter was given.

Dear Diversions Editors,
I object to your first mock
"indignant" letter, as it deprives me
of the opportunity to write a real
indignant letter to The Daily,
declaiming all the wonderful things
that the ASSU provides. But you
know what? I'll probably write a let
ter anyway, because even though
this page isn't meant to be taken
seriously, there is the off-chance that
someone might be inspired to take a
good hard look at the ASSU. Then
they realize that they just don't care
about it even remotely, and if
Hitler's brain was elected ASSU
president, it wouldn't matter at all.
Not at all, little ones, not at all.
