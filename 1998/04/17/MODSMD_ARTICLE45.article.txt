# Special fee victory
## All but one earn funds 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
With the exception of the Un
dergraduate Weenie Roast, the
voting population approved all
ASSU special-fee groups request
ing support for the coming school
vear.

It is the second consecutive year that all but one
group has seen its fee request approved.
Next year, undergraduates will pay $105 in ASSU
special fees and graduate students will pay $37 for a
total of $937,892 in funding.
T hough most groups received their special fees, the
approval rate was noticeably lower this year than last.
The Stanford Band had the highest at 68 percent with
other groups at 40 to 50 percent.
In last year's election, several special-fee groups,
including Alternative Spring Break. K7.SIJ and Stan
ford Jazz Orchestra, were approved at rates of 80 per
cent and above.
Students voted for no change in the current level of
funding for ASSU general fees that fund the Publica
tions Board, the Program Board and the Community
Service Board. General fees for this year were
$397,281.
ASSU President Emily Andrus read the results
early this morning in the Tresidder Union lounge.
Shouts of approval could be heard as each group's
special-fee request was passed.

Patrick Lewis Jose, a freshman, described the waiting
process as "nerve-wracking" and emphasized that
special fees are important for the group's activities.
"We do a lot with [the fees]." he said. "We really
count on it every year. That's why we take it serious
ly."
Junior Darell Tibbies, KZSU general manager, ex
pressed relief when the radio station's special fee
passed.
"It allows us to continue broadcasting and stay on
the air," he said. "It's good to see that students sup
port us. It allows us to do our job better."
Special-fee groups were divided into categories
based on the population they serve — either under
graduate or both undergraduate and graduate. Each
special-fee request had to receive votes from at least
15 percent of the voting population in its category.
Undergraduate fee groups had to receive at least
965 votes, while fees for all students had to receive at
least 2.019 votes.
The Undergraduate Weenie Roast appeared on
the special-fee ballot for the first time in this election.
Though it received approval from more than 15 per
cent of the voters, it also garnered about 60 more neg
ative votes and thus did not pass.
