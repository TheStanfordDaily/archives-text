# Catchy slogans key to senatorial race
## 
### Jennie Berry Jim Tankersley Contributing writers 
Once again, name recognition pre
vailed in the ASSU Senate race — the
class of 15 undergraduate senators-elect
was dominated by candidates with
catchy campaign slogans.
Junior Jenny Moon ("Moon the
ASSU"), sophomore Adam Weiss
("Weiss. Weiss. Baby"), sophomore
Clarence Hu ("Hu's Your Daddy") and
freshman Michael Levin ("Seven-
Levin") finished first through fourth in
the election results announced this
morning in Tresidder Union.
The other 11 students selected to the
senate included: freshmen Clara Chan.
Malia Villegas. Elsa Jacobsen and Saba
Bireda; sophomores Nikki Love.
Stephen Leon Kane. Bobby Beaver,
Ann Thananopavarn, Luke Avila and

Rita Leung; and ju
nior Dave Searle.
As usual, the
soon-to-be-sena
tors were anxious
to get to work.
"I'm really
excited about the
election results,"

Weiss said. "I've met some of the senate
candidates and future senators, and
hopefully we have the potential to do
some great things in the senate next
year."
"I think this is going to be a great year
for the ASSU," Levin said. "We can re
verse the general negative view that stu
dents have toward their leaders."
Topping the agenda for several of the
new members was increased student
voice in University decisions.
"Issue-wise. I really like [the] idea of

a political union — where schools and
[students] are more supportive of politi
cal activities," Love said.
Only five students were listed on the
graduate senate ballot — Jeremy Brick
er, Michael Colon, Max Kamenetsky,
Alane Murdock and Lawrence Page. All
five won seats easily.
Write-in candidates won the other 10
seats. By district, the graduate winners
are Murdock, Scott Kush, Vladimir
Jevremovic, John Mills and William Int
ner (Law. Business and Medicine);
Bricker, Phillip Beineke, Dave Robison,
Hunter Tart. David Elashoff and Dana
Powell, who tied for the last spot (Hu
manities and Sciences, Education and
Earth Sciences); Page. Colon. Kamenet
sky. Brian Morfitt and David Hutton
(Engineering).
Write-in candidates have yet to ac
cept these positions.

Voting was close in two of the three
class president races. Both the senior
and sophomore class competitions went
down to the final round of the Aus
tralian ballot.
Euphoria, consisting of freshmen
Sarah Dimson. Ben Liu, Parth Raval
and Jack Wang, captured the Class of
2(M)I presidency. The senior class title
went to X-cite, which features Mina Bak.
Nate Brown. Jen Slaski and Erica
Straus.
Booyah!, the only slate entered in the
junior class competition, won that race
handily.
Its members include Ward Bullard.
Chris Collins, Shandra Montgomery and
Reiko Osaki.
Contested or not. victory was sweet,
Osaki said. "It was like the Aeneid: four
people, one journey. It was all up to us
whether we would persevere."
