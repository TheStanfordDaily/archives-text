# Zare receives chemistry award from American Chemical Society
## 
### Evan Moffic 
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare. best known
for his discovery of possible life on Mars, has
received the American Chemical Society's
annual Award in Analytical Chemistry.
The award is sponsored by Fisher Scientif
ic Corp. and honors outstanding researchers
in analytical chemistry.
The award was presented to Zare, a physi
cal chemist, on April 9 at the American
Chemical Society's 215 th national meeting in
Dallas.
Zare received worldwide attention in 1996
when he helped prepare and lead part of the
investigation of the billion-year-old microfos
sils of organic molecules in a meteorite. The
molecules were believed to have originated
on Mars. With other colleagues from Stanford
and NASA, he published groundbreaking re
search in the August 1996 issue of Science
magazine.
The meteorite investigation continues to
be written about and debated within scientif
ic circles. According to chemistry doctoral
student Clyde Wilson, a member of Zare's lab
team. Zare's work on the meteorite project
consisted primarily of investigating the mete
orite with laser absorption technology. In ad
dition to this most recent award. Zare was rec
ogni/ed by NASA last year for his outstand
ing work on the meteorite project
"Zare is one of the premiere scientists in
the world todav." noted C hemistrv Prof. John

Brauman, a member of the
Fisher Scientific Awards
Council."He has probably
done more than anyone else
to apply laser techniques to
chemistry. Every major
chemistry department has
researchers who are indebt
ed to Dr. Zare for the devel-

opment of his methods."
Zare's other work includes his 1991
demonstration using a laser to specifically di
rect the course of a chemical reaction.
In his acceptance speech, he noted. "What
chemists do best can he described by the
'three M's."
"Chemists make it. they measure it and
they model it. Analytical chemistry is an es
sential core activity of what constitutes chem
istry. I am thrilled to be recognized as a mem
ber of the analytical chemistry community."
Zare came to Stanford after teaching as
signments at MIT, the I Jniversity of Colorado
and Columbia University. He received his
doctorate in chemical physics from Harvard
I jniversity in 1%4. He is also ending his term
as chairman of the National Science Board.
Wilson said he believes that Zare is an ex
cellent choice for the award. "Dick is delving
into an amazing branch of areas," Wilson
said. "He is interested in every idea, every
field and every approach. The only rule he has
as our supervisor is that we are excited about
the work we do."
