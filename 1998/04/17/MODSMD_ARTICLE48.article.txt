With the nation's top varsity ten
nis teams in the nation, it is difficult
for the average student to find com
petitive tennis to partake in at Stan
ford.
But look no further.
The first annual World Teamten
nis Collegiate (Challenge starts Mon
day on the Farm.
Although not an official part of
the Stanford intramural program,
this tournament will provide the op
portunity for any student to com -
pete in Stanford tennis. The play
consists of one set each of men's and
women's singles, one set each of
men's and women's doubles, and
one or two sets of mixed doubles.
Score is kept by game, with every
game counting as a point in the over
all team score. Teams consist of be
tween four and 10 players (at least
two men and two women), and a
team's final score is the sum of all in
dividual points.
A team must win the final game
of the last set to be crowned the vic
tor. no matter how far ahead the
team may be. Many matches may go

over the expected two hours, and
thrilling comebacks are a real possi
bility.
Funding for the tournament has
been provided by Home Access
Health, and the tournament will be
taking place at 10 universities
around the nation. Alter four weeks
of tournament play, each school will
crown a victor. The champion teams
from each university will then com
