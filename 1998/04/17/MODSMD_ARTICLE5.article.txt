Coffee, instead of books, may soon be on
students' minds when they make a trip to the
library. Alter two-and-a-half years of plan
ning. the coffee kiosk located between
Green and Meyer libraries will open in early
May.
Moon Bean's Cafe, which also has

branches in San Jose and I.os Gatos. will
lease and operate the kiosk after winning the
bid between six companies. According to
Sarah Williamson, the director of communi
cations of Stanford libraries, library officials
selected the vendor based on service atti
tude, quality and price of the drinks, ideas for
interior design and how soon the plan can be
implemented.

company that has gained a lot ot ground in a
short time," Williamson said. 'I think their
commitment to quality is absolutely top."
