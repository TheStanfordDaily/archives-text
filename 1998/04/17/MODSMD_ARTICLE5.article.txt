### Fei Wu 
Coffee, instead of books, may soon be on
students' minds when they make a trip to the
library. Alter two-and-a-half years of plan
ning. the coffee kiosk located between
Green and Meyer libraries will open in early
May.
Moon Bean's Cafe, which also has

branches in San Jose and I.os Gatos. will
lease and operate the kiosk after winning the
bid between six companies. According to
Sarah Williamson, the director of communi
cations of Stanford libraries, library officials
selected the vendor based on service atti
tude, quality and price of the drinks, ideas for
interior design and how soon the plan can be
implemented.

Describing Moon Bean's ('ate as "a small
company that has gained a lot ot ground in a
short time," Williamson said. 'I think their
commitment to quality is absolutely top."
The idea for the coffee kiosk originated in
the late summer of IWS b\ l'niversit\ I i
brarian Michael Keller.

Moon Bean's Cafe will soon occupy the coffee kiosk between Green and Meyer libraries. The cafe is scheduled to open in
the beginning of May.
"He felt it would provide a really
goixl and positive effect to the library
program and its overall experience,"
Williamson said.
Peet's Coffees and Teas, original
ly chosen as the vendor, withdrew
from the contract December 1997. A
second round of interviews for a new
vendor then followed.
Bon Appetit of Tresidder Union
and the Bookstore also entered in
bidding but were not selected. Be
cause the selection process was
"open and comprehensive,"
Williamson said there should be no
conflict in competition.
Hours for the coffee kiosk will
parallel hours for Green, and the
leasing is based on that library's

hours "because Green is probably
more visited."
Jennie Reynolds, owner of Moon
Bean Cafe, said the Stanford coffee
kiosk is a bigger shop compared with
its other two off-campus branches
and will have more drinks and food
selection. Besides the traditional cof
fee and tea, Reynolds said the coffee
kiosk will also have sections for cof
fee bean wholesale, fresh-baked
muffins, coffee, possibly soup and
merchandise like mugs and T-shirts.
For students who need to grab
and go, an express lane will be set up
in the kiosk accepting exact change in
a canister. A daily set of internation
al newspapers will also be provided.
"We want to make it a really com
fortable gathering place for the stu
dent body, and faculty too,"
Reynolds said. "We are really excit
ed to open up."
