# Talking about Toyon
## 
### Brittney Jensen 
In Toyon lounge last night. Vice
Provost for Student Affairs James
Montoya and other members of
the Residential Programs Imple
mentation Group met with stu
dents to discuss Tovon's future as a
sophomore focus dormitory next
year.
Students gave ideas for sopho
more academic and social pro
grams. and Montoya addressed
concerns such as the future of the
Toyon Eating Clubs and coping
with the "sophomore slump."
Sophomores will have priority
for housing in Toyon. Although
the Office of Residential Educa
tion plans for the dormitory to be a
social and academic center for all
sophomores, only 11 percent of
Stanford sophomores will live
there, up from 7 percent this year.
"As freshmen, everyone loves
you and takes care of you." Mon
toya explained. "Juniors and se
niors have their departments to
look after them. Sophomores are
thrown out to campus with little
support."
With increased advising re
sources and in-house upperclass
mentors from a variety of disci
plines, Toyon will help students
through the infamous "sophomore
slump," according to Montoya.
Ramon Saldivar. vice provost
for undergraduate education, sug
gested a one-day mini-orientation
for sophomores next fall.
"During the massive freshman
Orientation, students are given
everything they need to know for
all four years," said Saldivar, ex
plaining that this was too much in
formation given at an impractical
time. "Freshmen aren't ready to
think about going overseas or an
economics minor."
Saldivar said that Toyon will
focus on "the crisis year, when stu
dents have many big decisions to
make."
Montoya gave each of the ap
proximately 30 students at the
meeting, including several Toyon
residents, a chance to suggest how
to meet the needs of sophomores.
Students expressed frustration
and disappointment at the current
lack of academic support given to
sophomores.
"As a freshman, there were lots
of academic programs available
through the dorm." said sopho
more Susie Cranston. "But 1 didn't
take advantage of them since I was
taking introductory courses."
This fall, she said she went to

the Undergradu
ate Advising
Center for help in
picking a major,
hut there was a
three-week wait
for an appoint
ment. She said
she thought

sophomores need
immediately available resources
they can use, now that they are "a
year older and wiser."
Current Toyon residents ex
pressed concern at Toyon becom
ing too academic advising-orient
ed. Montoya emphasized that Res
Ed would attempt to create a bal
ance between academic and social
aspects of the house. The sopho
more orientation would be primar
ily social. Academic programs
would be options but wouldn't dis
rupt Toyon's social atmosphere.
Toyon will be used as a center
for social events that promote class
unity. "Toyon should open up to all
sophomores on campus," suggest
ed senior Nate Whitman, a resi
dent assistant in Branner. "It could
host barbecues in the eating clubs,
volleyball on the lawn and dances
in its lounge."
There will also be a small bud
get for an overnight trip to some
where like Big Sur, said Toyon res
ident fellow Ralph Faste. Overall,
he said he "doesn't see any major
shift in our emphasis to be a place
people love to live."
These changes in Toyon will not
affect the future of Toyon's much
loved eating clubs.
Some current residents thought
Toyon was the wrong choice to be
a sophomore focus house because
it is one of the most successful four
class residences.
Montoya explained that Toyon
was a logical choice because it was
already 65 percent sophomore.
The change helps preserve a bal
ance of freshmen on the east and
parts of west campus.
Changes in upperclass housing
are necessary, as more dormitories
are converted to all-freshman resi
dences.
Even with the current additions.
150-200 incoming students who re
quest all-frosh housing will be
placed in a four-class dorm.
These changes stem from rec
ommendations made by the Task
Force on Residential Programs, a
group of faculty, staff and students.
Students are encouraged to e-mail
any comments or suggestions to
Montoya at weekend@leland.stan
ford.edu.
