El Nino, Global Warming, and the
Implications of Climate Changes
Dr. Stephen Schneider,
Senior Fellow, Institute for International Studies and Professor,
Department of Biological Science, Stanford University
Climate change affects everyone—some
may benefit, some may suffer. Dr. Stephen
Schneider has studied all the reasons for
climate change; from long-term advances
and retreats of the Ice Ages, to the current
concern about Global Warming. Only now,
however, has humanity reached a stage in
population and technology that we might
change the climate by our own actions.
Questions as to the extent and severity
of such changes were discussed recently
at a conference in Kyoto, Japan, that was
attended by representatives of more than
185 nations. Dr. Schneider will explain
what was accomplished at Kyoto in
reaching an agreement to limit the future
discharge of greenhouse gases, and what
remains to be done to make the treaty
more effective and equitable.
Dr. Schneider serves as consultant
to the White House staff and to various
departments of the federal government.
His current global change research
includes: climate change, global warm
ing, food, environmental science and
public policy issues.
