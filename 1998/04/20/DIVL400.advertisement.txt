What is Anxiety?
Anxiety is an emotion of elusive
uneasiness and dreaded tension.
The intensity of feeling may range
from extremely mild to moderate
to very severe, and the level of
discomfort can change. It may be
short-lived, chronic, episodic, or
some combination of these.
Anxiety has an impact on both our
physical and mental systems. It
affects how we feel, think and
perceive; it precipitates muscle
tension and activity in adrenal
system, and it influences our
motivation and our behavior.
Causes
Anxiety is caused by many
different things. These may
include:
■ Large amounts of academic
work, limited time, and human
limitations
■ Challenging relationships with
professors
■ Separation from home or
country
■ Problems in relationships
■ Illness or death of family
members
■ Anxiety disorders such as
social anxiety and panic attacks
■ Excessive worrying
■ Medical problems (e.g., hyper
or hypothyroid disorders,
tumors of the adrenal gland,
and diabetes)
■ Monthly hormonal changes
' T <*4 . -L
Ever feel like you're barely going
to make it? Life today is even
more complicated than it was for
this Stanford javelin thrower in
the 1890s.
Effects
Anxiety can be either helpful or
harmful. When mild, anxiety can
motivate students to engage in the
academic tasks or social situations
that triggered it. When moderate or
severe and chronic, it may lead to:
■ Generalized stress
■ Performing below one's capa
bilities
■ Avoiding participation in
classroom discussions
■ Perfectionism and over-prepar
ation
■ Procrastination
■ "Choking" or confusion during
Over-fearfulness of failing a
class
Excessive fear of asking for a
date
Fear of being evaluated or
judged
Panic reactions
A less-than-full university
experience
What to Do
Many students feel "stressed"
when facing exams or experiences
that pose some risk or threat. For
some, this situational anxiety
abates once the challenge is over;
for others, the burden of anxiety
continues. Here are some tips for
coping with anxiety:
■ Avoid letting your worries
build up; talk with someone
about them
■ Learn relaxation techniques (e.g.,
deep breathing or muscle
relaxation)
■ Set aside a regular time to
practice relaxation, and give it
high priority
■ Don't fixate on the anxiety - you
may stimulate it even more
■ Don't try to get rid of the
anxiety "instantly"; that can
make it worse
■ Observe yourself: do you get
anxious about being anxious
■ Rather than resisting your
anxiety, try developing a
"friendship" with it
■ In exams or under deadlines,
don't keep looking at your
watch or the clock
■ When anxiety medication has
been prescribed by a psychi
atrist or a physician who
knows you, take it
■ Join one of the anxiety groups
offered at CAPS
■ Educate yourself about the
form of anxiety you have
(you'll find material on anxiety
in the CAI'S waiting room) and
at the Cowell Health Library
For a professional evaluation of the
anxiety you experience, call CAI'S at
723-3785. There's no need to struggle
alone. D
