help analyze which joint research projects between the Livermore laboratory
and private industry succeeded, which failed, and why. The student should be
good at interviewing busy people and should have a sound grasp of common
sense economics. They should also be good at generating and following up
their own research leads. This is a challenging paid research project for a
