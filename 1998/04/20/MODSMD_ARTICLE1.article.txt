Conley describes Med School
discrimination in new book

In her book "Walking
Out on the Boys," Frances
Conley portrays Stanford
Hospital as a boys' club full
of "blatant gender discrim
ination."
Conley, chair of the
Faculty Senate and acting
chief of staff at the Palo
Alto Veterans Health
Care System, portrays a

world where women are routinely groped, fondled and
propositioned by their male colleagues and superiors.
"It's a system whereby women are treated as inferior cit
izens," Conley said in an interview.
At first, Conley said, she did not object to the harassing
behavior.
"None of the women in my world (nurses, for the most
part) ever made an issue of this touchy-feely, flirtatious,
and at times not very attractive behavior, and I certainly
was not willing to call attention to myself by doing so," she
wrote.
Conley, a neurosurgeon, decided to air these charges in
1991 when she resigned after one of her colleagues, Gerald
Silverberg, was named chair of the Neurosurgery Depart
ment. In her book, Conley describes Silverberg as compet
itive and critical, saying that he "chose gender as the means

by which to establish his superior sta
tus."
However, Conley asserts that Sil
verberg was far from alone in his sex
ist antics.
"Women as 'fair game' was ac
cepted as an integral part of the world
of medicine," Conley wrote.
Conley implicates former mem
bers of the University administration
in condoning or permitting this be
havior, including former University
President Donald Kennedy and for
mer Medical School Dean David
Korn. She recalls Kennedy asking
her at the time of her allegations
whether this was "really important."
Kennedy, Conley asserts, couldn't af
ford to make a scandal out of her
charges because he was busy quieting
scandals about his own private life.
Kennedy could not be reached for
comment. Conley's allegations
caused a national furor in 1991, and
she was interviewed by everyone
from CNN to The New York limes.
She eventually reversed her decision
to resign, returning to Stanford to
continue "the battle for equal oppor
tunity for women in our workplace."
Since her return to Stanford, Con
ley said, she has not experienced the
same type of harassment.
"People have been treating me
very carefully," she said.
With the attention given to her
charges, Conley began to realize that
the issue at hand was larger than sim
ply her department or her hospital.
"My conflict was not about Pro
fessor Gerald Silverberg and the
chair position, but about a medical
culture that condoned stereotypic
thinking, outdated behavior, and an
arrogant superiorist ideology cou
pled with stubborn resistance to
change," she wrote.
After an investigation into his be
havior, Silverberg was demoted from
acting department chair. He current
ly serves as a professor of neuro
surgery at Stanford. He is on sabbat
ical until July 1 and could not be
reached for comment.

Conley, who first entered Stan
ford Medical School in 1961, said that
while she believes the environment
has improved for women in the past
35 years, it is still not at the point of
equality.
"It has come a little ways, but
there's still a long way to go," she
said. "I'd say that the situation is get
ting better but. like beauty, that is in
the eye of the beholder.
"I had a surgical intern in my of
fice a month ago telling the same
kind of stories that I experienced 30
years ago, and 1 still don't know what
to tell her," Conley said. "She's in a
precarious position where in a year
she might need a recommendation
from this man, so she has to do a cost
benefit analysis."
Changing the system, Conley as
serts, will take both time and dili
gence.
"This is a situation that will
change by evolution, not revolution,"
she said.
Conley commends the current ad
ministration on its attitude and be
havior toward issues of sexual harass
ment.
"I feel that the current administra
tion including [University President
Gerhard] Casper and Provost [Con
doleezza] Rice and the Med School
has done very well with these issues,"
Conley said.
University Communications Di
rector Terry Shepard agrees that the
University must continue to take
strong step* to combat sexual harass
ment and discrimination.
"This is not a problem that is just
University-wide," he said. "Issues of
sexism are worldwide."
Conley feels, however, that sexist
behavior is particularly sheltered and
protected in universities.
"Our academic institutions have
always been very revered and have
not necessarily been subject to the
scrutiny that they should be on this
issue," she said.
Despite the furor created by her
allegations, Conley insists that she
does not have the time to be a full
time activist. "People would like to
catch me up in this cause, but I still do
have a full-time job," she said.
