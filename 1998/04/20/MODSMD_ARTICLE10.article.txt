SANTIAGO. Chile (AP)
Leaders of the Western Hemi
sphere's 34 democracies overlooked
political and economic uncertainties
yesterday and forged ahead with a
bold plan for hemispheric duty-free
trade by 2(X)5. They directed negoti
ations to begin in September.
The talks will start in Miami and
finish in Mexico City.
"Here in Santiago the ground has
been broken for the largest free
trade area in history," Chilean Pres
ident Eduardo Frei told the conclud
ing summit session. The combined
economies total trillion and
encompass nearly SIX) million peo
ple.
The assembled leaders, at the
second Summit of the Americas,
called for specific accomplishments,
such as standardized customs forms,
as early as 2(XK).
"Our journey from Miami to
Santiago was ... from words to
deeds," said President Clinton, who
presided over the first summit meet
ing in Miami in l c W4. "Today we

launch comprehensive negotiations
for a Free Trade Area of the Amer
icas.'"
That's the formal name that has
been given to the proposed zone,
reaching from Alaska to Cape Horn,
where virtually all existing tariffs
and duties would be eliminated.
Clinton conceded the work
would he difficult and said that
democracy was still fragile in some
parts of the hemisphere. "We must
continue to stand fast for democracy
... with no holdouts and no hack
sliders."
The accord only made passing
reference to the biggest obstacles:
Clinton's failure to win fast-track
negotiating powers from Congress
and a new skittishness in Latin
America in the aftermath of Asia's
financial troubles, which tightened
export and credit markets.
"We are confident the Free
Trade Area of the Americas will
improve the well-being of all our
people," a joint statement Irom the
leaders said.
