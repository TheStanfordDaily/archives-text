DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) — Sinn
Fein leader (ierry Adams, seeking
to keep his IRA-allied party united
on the road to compromise, let
hard-liners within his ranks vent
their opposition yesterday to the
Northern Ireland peace accord he
helped negotiate.
Adams told his party's annual
conference that Irish republicans
like him would never accept North
ern Ireland's existence under
British rule. But he hinted they
should take seats in a new Northern
Ireland Assembly alongside the
province's pro-British Protestant
majority — a key plank of the peace
accord.
"I totally reject any notion of
accepting the legitimacy of the six
county state or of partition," he said
in reference to Northern Ireland
and its creation 77 years ago when
the rest of Ireland won indepen
dence from Britain.
He defended the accord as a
"mixed bag" that would enable
Sinn Fein to pursue its "root objec
tive" — to build its voter support
beyond the 17 percent the party
already has in Northern Ireland.
To reject the accord would mean
adopting "a defensive strategy that
will emasculate our struggle." he
warned in his closing address at the

Royal Dublin Society conference
center.
Adams persuaded the more than
I.(XM) Sinn Fein delegates to post
pone a decision on the accord until

an "emergency" conference in two
or three weeks. While he said he
would be confident of winning a
vote now. he wanted lengthy inter
nal debate first.

The delav allows him and his cir
cle ot supporters the time to identi
tv outspoken dissidents or waverer
and apply pressure before the nexi
high-profile gathering.
