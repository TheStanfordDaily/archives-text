University should have
consulted faculty earlier
about construction plans

ALTHOUGH THE Universi
ty is hard-pressed to provide
housing for a growing num
ber of students and faculty, its housing
decisions should take into account
more carefully the interests of those
whom it is trying to serve.
Availability of affordable housing is
certainly of crucial importance in
attracting eminent professors to Stan
ford.
Especially considering the exorbi
tant prices of residences in the Bay
Area, Stanford has every duty to pro
vide viable residence options for
scholars who choose to teach and
study here.
The University's efforts to stretch
its resources in order to provide hous
ing is commendable.
But it is not acceptable for the Uni
versity to make decisions which will
so drastically alter the landscape of
Stanford — and the homes of many
faculty living on campus — without
more actively consulting with the peo
ple who will be affected by these
changes.
Some of the areas currently under
survey for development, located in
residential neighborhoods on campus,
are among the few open spaces

remaining within campus. Others are
currently home to many faculty or
border student residences.
To develop the Mayfield Playfield,
Gerona Triangle, Frenchman's Trian
gle or the site on Dolores Street would
irreversibly change the character of
the campus.
It may be necessary in the long run
to build more space-efficient housing
in these areas, in order to accommo
date the needs of a larger number of
faculty and students.
But because these are decisions of
snvh.long-lasiing impact, (acuity input
should be included in all steps of the
decision-making process. 1
In particular, the leaseholders
group — which was designed to give
residents a voice — should work to
ensure that the University and the
county take the opinions of residents
into account.
Students who recently voiced their
complaints about their lack of input in
University housing decisions certainly
understand that the University is try
ing to serve their needs. The case with
faculty is the same.
But if these housing decisions are
meant to serve the interests of stu
dents and faculty, then the University
must certainly listen to — and take
into account — their opinions.
As the recent housing situations
have demonstrated, conversation, not
confrontation is a far more effective
mechanism for achieving the desired
result.
