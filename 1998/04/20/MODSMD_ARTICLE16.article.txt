Twenty-seven years ago this
week, Stanford students planned
an array of activities to celebrate
the first Earth Day.
Among the highlights were an envi
ronmental fair in White Plaza, a panel
discussion at Memorial Auditorium,
and a rally to support picketers protest
ing poor conditions at the Owens-Corn
ing fiberglass plant in Santa Clara.
Sixteen environmental films were
screened at Meyer Library (which was
at the time, simply known as the
"UGLY.") Workshops were offered on
land use. air pollution, logging, technol
ogy and pesticides. A special Earlh Day
dinner was also held in which home
made bread and honey were served.
According to Steve Fortmann. the
spokesmen for the Stanford End Day
(Environment Near Death) C ommittee,

"Stanford has a hell of a lot of people
who aren't aware of the depth of the
environmental problem and the radical
nature of the solutions that are
required. We hope to stimulate aware
ness that these problems are not simple
and are not just technological but are a
matter of our whole philosophy and
lifestyle. We cannot go on living like we
are living, consuming like we are con
suming and breeding like we are breed
ing.
A puppet show rendition of the
"Magic Garden" was performed at
noon in White Plaza.
Moreover, all classes were also
encouraged to discuss the relevance of
their discipline to ecological crisis.
More than HX) students had been
preparing for the festivities since Jan
uary.
