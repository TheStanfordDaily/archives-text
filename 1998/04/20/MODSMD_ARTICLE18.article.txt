## Neocolonialism for the nineties 
### 
PRESIDENT Clin
ton's recent trip to
Africa was hailed
as a milestone by liberals
and conservatives alike. It
was the first official state
visit a U.S. president has
made to Africa. Clinton

brought up the issue of
slavery and made a fleeting apology. He
also recognized that the United States had
been neglecting Africa in its trade practices
and foreign aid disbursement. He promised
to make changes.
Initially, I was happy to see that Africa,
the continent where my family lived for
several generations, was finally gaining a
place in U.S. foreign policy. Then I began
to think about American motives. The
United States rarely does anything for sole
ly altruistic purposes. There is almost
always something to gain, even under the
guise of foreign aid or service.
As I read the papers more closely, I real
ized that K(X) other Americans accompa
nied President Clinton on his trip. There
were politicians, press and, most important,
business people.
Few people know enough about Africa
and the history of American imperialism to
make the connections. We forget history
and the insightful cliche that history repeats
itself. Recent relations with Africa, while
different in some key ways, have the possi
bility of repeating the exploitation of slav
ery.

Clinton's visit paralleled those made by
Americans hundreds of years ago. Last
month, he was not capturing people and
bringing them over on slave ships. Howev
er, his trip was the beginning of a new rela
tionship of exploitation and neocolonial
ism. The business people who accompanied
the president were searching for opportuni
ty and cheap labor. They turned to Africa;
the poorest and least "developed" conti
nent. with hungry eyes.
The possibility of closer relations with
Africa is frightening. Although African
nations will receive large amounts of aid, to
whom will the money go and how will it be
used? Most important, what strings will be
attached to that aid?
During the period of Western colonial
ism. trade and development were present
ed as beneficial to both the colonizers and
the colonized. However, Asians, Latin
Americans and Africans were trapped in
exploitative economic relationships. They
labored to produce cash crops like sugar
which could not be used to feed hungry
people. As a result, they were forced to buy
staple items under conditions set by the col
onizers.
This abuse continues. It includes the use
of poorly paid labor in Asia and Latin
America to make American products. It
also includes bringing migrant laborers to
this country. Their civil and human rights
are violated while they work here. Eco
nomic exploitation occurs at Stanford on
Webb Ranch, in the Coffee House and in

our cafeterias. It is perpetuated by the com
panies that support Stanford and those in
which we invest.
People are too slow to make the con
nections between the past and the present.
By the time consciousness is raised, it is
usually too little, too late.
After the Nazi Holocaust, many people,
especially thape in th#lrwtflnamm*iity,
vowed not to Jet such an atrocity Occur
again. But in recent years the majoritv of
the world has stood by as genocide in
Rwanda. Bosnia and East Timor continues.
Without an economic motive, the United
States has comfortably turned a blind eye
to these injustices and spent more time on
Saddam Hussein and the Gulf War.
1 blame the United States because with
global power comes global responsibility.
Other nations, mine included, are equally
culpable for their inaction. While several of
these conflicts have escalated beyond con
trol, the increased exploitation of Africa is
still in its infancy.
We need to remember history and draw
connections to the present. We need politi
cal lobbyists to prevent the same kind of
exploitation that occurred during slavery to
be repeated. We also need to link the situ
ation in Africa to those in Latin America,
Asia and within our own borders to see the
ills of global capitalism. Join me in the
struggle.
