Try harder to remedy
grad housing shortage
In a letter to The Daily on Wednesday,
April S, Tom Wasow, associate dean of
graduate policy, addresses the graduate
housing crunch by saying — in effect — "It
isn't our fault." While I'm sure that's a nat
ural reaction, I'm not sure that cuts it.
I understand that time, budgets, envi
ronmental issues, governmental regulations
and even (or perhaps especially) the Stan
fords' original bequest all restrict the hous
ing office.
However, have they tried all possible
avenues to accelerate an on-campus hous
ing boom? For example, have they tried
partnerships with private industry? Have
they held on open forum to discuss the
problem? If they have. I haven't heard
about it.
Also left unanswered is the issue of equi
ty. Some students get their first housing
pick and stay there for years. Others get

their last pick and are then forced to search
for housing outside the University.
While a lottery may seem like a good
method of assignment, it isn't always
fair. True, life isn't always fair, but an
attempt to make things more equitable
would be good.
Wasow also claims that Stanford is doing
"far better than competitors" at housing
students. What competitors?
Where else is there a major university in
an area with both demand and cost of hous
ing already high and accelerating, with no
rent control and with insufficient public
transportation?
Berkeley has the latter two, and New
York City and Boston have perhaps the
best public transportation systems in the
nation. And that's not even a fair compari
son. since schools in those cities are actual
ly in the heart of the cities, not as isolated as
Stanford.
Me goes on to cite Stanford's "increase
in fellowship stipends, teaching assistant
salaries and research assistant salaries."
Yet comparing similar fellowships by

other universities — such as Illinois, where
rent costs are half what they are here —
Stanford offers the smallest per nine-month
year.
Don't get me wrong — I'm glad I came
to Stanford, and I'm grateful for my fund
ing. I just hope I get on-campus housing
next year.
