Excerpts from Walking Out on the Boys, by Frances
Conlev, published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New
York:
On another occasion, as I entered the room for
lunch, a male cofftague yelled out, "I can see the
shape of your breasts and nipples even through that
white coat!" All eyes turned to appraise ijiy fully,
and nonprovocatively, clothed body. My face turned
red, and an appropriate, incisively belittling reply,
for a moment failed me. Then I answered, "And I
noticed yours is hanging on the left today, sir!"
— page 49
On one occasion, two residents played "dropkick,"
one by one, with a stack of dirty restaurant dinner
plates, splattering shards of broken ceramic toward a
huddle of terrified waitresses. One of the women had
sinned by not accepting the advances of a drunken
resident surgeon, and this was the doctor's way of get
ting even. — page 35
