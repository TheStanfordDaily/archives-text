Excerpts from Walking Out on the Boys, by Frances
Conlev, published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New
York:
On another occasion, as I entered the room for
lunch, a male cofftague yelled out, "I can see the
shape of your breasts and nipples even through that
white coat!" All eyes turned to appraise ijiy fully,
and nonprovocatively, clothed body. My face turned
red, and an appropriate, incisively belittling reply,
for a moment failed me. Then I answered, "And I
noticed yours is hanging on the left today, sir!"
— page 49
On one occasion, two residents played "dropkick,"
one by one, with a stack of dirty restaurant dinner
plates, splattering shards of broken ceramic toward a
huddle of terrified waitresses. One of the women had
sinned by not accepting the advances of a drunken
resident surgeon, and this was the doctor's way of get
ting even. — page 35
It was not only about touching
and fondling — it was an attitude.
In my department women had no
value.... There was an implicit
message in the neurosurgery of
fice routine, and from Gerry's
verbal comments, that I was infe
rior because 1 was a woman, and
for no other reason. — page 99
One survived in this masculine
world by being one of the boys,
and for all intents and purposes 1

had become one of them. Only I
received much more physical at
tention, having legs that were
stroked, a neck that was caressed,
breasts that were a topic of con
versation as to their size and
shape. Frequently offended. I
dared not offend, for fear of ban
ishment from the only profession
al camaraderie I had even known.
Not wanting to lose my quasi
membership in the surgeons'
club, 1 had never done anything
to stop behavior that was repul
sive to me and ultimately damag
ing to my self-respect and dignity.
