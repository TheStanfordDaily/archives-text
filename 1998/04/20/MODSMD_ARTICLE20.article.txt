## Alda Leu Cars, carts and bikes: best bets for travel 
### 
IM LAZY. I admit it. And the biggest
problem I have faced during the last four
years is how to get my lazy self to class
and around campus. Stanford is a huge
school — Campus Drive is almost four miles
all the way around and getting from one side
to another can take more than half an hour
depending on the mode of transportation.
I've been trying bravely through the
years to find the best possible way to get
from point A to point B at Stanford and
have condensed my findings for public ben
efit below:
Biking My freshman and sophomore
year, 1 actually biked to class. 1 sweated to
class on my Huffy (in the days before I
understood what Specialized, Gary Fisher
and Diamondback were), able to get to most
classes in less than 10 minutes. Biking is
probably the quickest way to get to class, all
things considered. And it is clearly the most
popular method.
Pros: Parking is never a problem. Park
your bike (locked to itself, of course) right
by the door and stroll into class.
Cons: Fashion limitations. Skirts are pret
ty much out of the question. During perpet
ual rainy seasons like this one, muddy water
splashes everywhere, and a wet bike seat
poses another fashion hazard. And what's
up with those rubber bands that the engi
neering grad students wrap around one leg?

Energy expended. High — after all. even
if it's downhill one way, the trip back will be
a huffer and a puffer.
Weather extremes. No matter what the
weather's like, bikers will feel it to an
extreme. Windy days are windier; cold days
are freezing; rainy days are like monsoons;
and hot days will be sweltering.
Walking After living on the Row, 1 dis
covered the joys of walking. This alternative
is the most inexpensive and time consuming,
depending on place of residence. Row resi
dents will find walking through the sunny
streets a pleasurable, elitist experience,
whereas Governor's Corner residents may
find the classroom trek a bit more exhaust
ing. Having lived in both areas, I can attest
to the fact that the Gov Co trek is not as long
as everyone thinks. This is my mode of
transport HO percent of the time.
Pros: Freedom. Read the newspaper; lis
ten to your walkman without the fear of
being run over; eat breakfast, lunch or din
ner; gossip with your friends; enjoy the
weather. No need to struggle with a bike
lock or parking.
Cons: Time. It simply takes longer to get
places, especially if one has trouble waking
up in the morning. On countless occasions,
I've realized, after several snoozes, that I
now face the choice of walking in to class 20
minutes late and insulting the professor, or

not going to class at all and wasting my par
ent's money. Alas. I often choose the latter.
Treacherous conditions. Walking past the
Clock Tower around noon is a dangerous
endeavor — bikes abound and a pedestrian
stands to sustain considerable damage from
being grazed by an impatient biker.
Driving OK, OK once I drove from
Xanadu to Tresidder Union, but it was an
emergency, 1 swear. Driving is a luxury to be
sure, and parking can be a pain. Nonetheless
I frequently take this option.
Pros: Energy expended. Provided that a
close parking space is at hand, personal
energy expended is minimal. Open the door,
turn the key and that's about it. No need to
brave the elements.
lime saved. Excellent for those in a great
hurry. It's faster than walking or biking ,
depending on willingness to park illegally.
Cons: Pollution. Driving to the Ouad
from Toyon Hall does not exactly help the
environment.
Parking hazard. Parking in service vehi
cle spaces can get very expensive, trust me.
Looking for legitimate parking will take you
longer than walking most of the time.
The Golf Cart Earlier this year, two
friends and I rented a golf cart. We
tooled around campus in style. However,
I think they are supposed to be for
injured people. But I often count my

friend Wade as handicapped.
Pros: See Stanford. The sky is the limit
with a golf cart. Go to the stables, then jet
over to the hospital, then pop over to
explore the golf course. There are no bol
lards that the cart can't handle with a good
navigator. And every open space is potential
parking.
Speed. Cruising at 10 to 20 mph without
having to scour for parking makes the golf
cart a speedy option. Tear through White
Plaza and watch people scramble away from
the path of the cart. Plus, find other friends
with golf carts and drag race.
Cons: Cost. It costs $40 for delivery from
San Jose and $130 a month to rent one.
That's not small change.
Weather. Without a front windshield it
gets downright freezing in a golf cart.
The Marguerite Last week. I discovered
the Marguerite. It's truly beautiful. I hop on
the shuttle at noon after class and get
dropped off in front of my dorm at 12:05
p.m. in temperature-controlled comfort.
Pros: Cost. It's free.
Time. It's faster than anything else,
despite the stops, because it goes where no
car can and there is not a parking dilemma.
Relaxing. Read; enjoy the air condition
ing: eat fcxxl; chat with the driver — Felipe
and 1 have become good friends since my
first ride.

Cons: Archaic routes. I never had the
energy in four years at Stanford to figure out
the Marguerite. A line. B line, SLAC — very
frustrating. Most of the routes run to places
like SLAC or the Medical Center and are
intended to transport employees, not stu
dents. so it's hard to find a match. Plus it
doesn't run at night.
Conclusion My favorite mode of trans
portation has been, thus far. the Marguerite.
If only Transportation Programs would
expand the shuttle's routes to focus on stu
dent needs and increase the running times.
The campus would he safer, students would
have an easier time getting to class, and
there'd be fewer bike accidents.
Stanford needs improved public trans
portation. I don't relish walking around by
myself at night and SURE can only do so
much running one or two carts most nights.
Parking near dorms is impossible, especially
late at night.
The situation is ridiculous, and the truth
is it's not just about laziness.
