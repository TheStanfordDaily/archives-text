The young Stanford women's golf
team has spent the first six months of
the season assessing its talent and
gelling as a team unit. At times, this
essential process has led to disap
pointing and inconsistent play.
WOMEN'S GOLF
â–  Today through Wednesday: Pacif
ic 10 Conference Championships at
Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif.
Yet as she watched her team ma
ture. Stanford head coach Caroline
O'Connor displayed great perspec
tive and encouraged them only to
focus on peaking in the season-end
ing postseason events.
As it travels to Rancho Santa
Margarita, Calif., for the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, the
Cardinal has a chance to do just that.
As recently as two weeks ago, at
the Arizona State Invitational, Stan
ford looked as if it would cruise
through the upcoming conference
tourney. In Tempe, the Card domi
nated its Pac-10 competition. Its clos
est rival was Arizona, which finished
16 shots behind. Arizona State was
next, falling to Stanford by 20. while
Oregon finished 28 strokes behind
the Cardinal.
However, the next weekend.
Stanford posted a poor finish at the
Peg Barnard California Classic, held
at its home course. In that event.
Stanford finished fourth and was
beaten by USC and Oregon, the
same squad it had dominated in Ari
zona.
"It was really inexplicable that we
finished so p<x>rly at home after such
a strong tournament in Tempe,"
freshman I lilary Homeyer said after
the Barnard. "We know we are a
much better team than that and look
to reassert ourselves at Pac 10s."
