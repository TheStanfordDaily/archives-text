The young Stanford women's golf
team has spent the first six months of
the season assessing its talent and
gelling as a team unit. At times, this
essential process has led to disap
pointing and inconsistent play.

Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif.

O'Connor displayed great perspec

focus on peaking in the season-end

As it travels to Rancho Santa
Margarita, Calif., for the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, the
Cardinal has a chance to do just that.
As recently as two weeks ago, at
the Arizona State Invitational, Stan
ford looked as if it would cruise
through the upcoming conference
tourney. In Tempe, the Card domi
nated its Pac-10 competition. Its clos
est rival was Arizona, which finished
16 shots behind. Arizona State was
next, falling to Stanford by 20. while
Oregon finished 28 strokes behind
the Cardinal.
However, the next weekend.
Stanford posted a poor finish at the
Peg Barnard California Classic, held
at its home course. In that event.
Stanford finished fourth and was
beaten by USC and Oregon, the
same squad it had dominated in Ari
zona.
"It was really inexplicable that we
finished so p<x>rly at home after such
a strong tournament in Tempe,"
freshman I lilary Homeyer said after
the Barnard. "We know we are a
much better team than that and look
to reassert ourselves at Pac 10s."
Many members of the Stanford
team have posted impressive individ
ual performances throughout the
season, but I lomeyer's have been the
most successful. She already has two
individual titles, at the Stanford
Women's Intercollegiate and the
ASI! Invitational.
"I am real happy with the way I've
been playing." Homeyer said. "I am
striking the ball well and getting a feel
for my short game. I really hope to
put it all together at Pac-lOs."
Sophomore Jae Jean Ro placed
fourth ;it the Stanford Intercollegiate,
while freshman Stephanie Keever
tied for fourth at the SMU /OSU
Challenge. Sophomore Julie Dunn
joined Homeyer at the top of the
leaderboard in Tempe, finishing tied
for fourth.

Due to these and other strong fin
ishes, Stanford heads to the site of the
Pac-10 tournament. Tijeras Creek
Golf Club, with great confidence.
"We know we are in a competitive
mode right now," freshman Lauren
Robertson said after her season-best
tie for 11th place last weekend.
"Coach has told us all year to be
ready around May, and I think we are
playing our best golf of the year right
now."
Stanford would love to assert its
ability to the rest of the conference.
"We are really looking forward to
making a statement at this tourna
ment." Robertson said. "We have
had ups and downs throughout the
season, and we are ready to put up a
showing this week."
A win would not only make a
statement to the Pac-10, it would give
the Card serious momentum heading
into the NCAA West Regional at
Stanford in three weeks.
