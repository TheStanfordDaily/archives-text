### Bobby Blunt Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team has
achieved one of its preseason goals — win
ning the North Division Western Women's
Lacrosse League title. The Cardinal (9-5.8-
0 WWLL) secured the league title Saturday
by beating UC-Davis 5-4.
By winning the league regular-season
title, the Cardinal has secured the top seed
for the playoffs this weekend.
In beating the Aggies, Stanford avoided
a three-way tie for first place in the league.
Had the Cardinal lost, Davis, California
and Stanford would all have had matching
league records, and the playoff picture
would not have been as bright for the team.
Instead, Stanford has also won the right to

host the playoffs and have a bye the first
round.
The Davis game was hard fought, and
the win did not come easily for Stanford.
The lowest-scoring game of the season was
marked by very strong defensive play by
the Cardinal. Sophomore Dana katter pro-

vided the inspiration for the defense.
According to sophomore Judy Fong, the
team's defense was able to break down the
Aggies' transition game. Stanford came up
with several interceptions and loose balls.

Also instrumental to the defensive effort
was junior goalie Stephanie Tuerk.
"The defense played amazing," Fong
said. "It was incredible to watch the defense
break Davis down, especially stopping
them in the transition phase."
At the half the score was only 3-1 in
Stanford's favor, a very low score compared
to the previous week's game against Cal.
when the final score was 14-12. Davis came
back in the second half to tie the game 3-3.
"All the big games we've played this
year, we haven't stepped up to the chal
lenge." Aggie head coach Brenden Blake
lev said. "We fiddle around the first 20 min
utes until some sense of urgency sets in. We
didn't grab this game and make it ours."
The Aggies did a good job frustrating
Stanford's offense bv double-teaming some

of the Cardinal's leading attackers. This
took the Card by surprise in the first half,
but b\ the second half Stanford was better
able to counter the double team. Stanford
freed other players to allow the double
teamed attacker an easy pass to an open
teammate.
Stanford scored two more goals and
opened the game back up with a score of 5-
3. The offense had several shots on goal and
came up just short a number of times Lead
ing the attack were Fong and senior Dara
Kaplan. The margin remained two until
about two minutes remained. The Cardinal
began to stall by passing and preventing
Davis from having the opportunity to have
the ball again.
The Aggies, though, regained
the ball and scored, closing the
game to one point. 5-4.
However, time ran out for the
Aggies. Stanford did lose posses
sion of the ball again with 15 sec
onds remaining in the game, but
this was not enough time for
Davis to stage a comeback. De
spite the last-minute pressure
from the Aggies, the Cardinal
kept its composure and did not
become frantic.
"Since we were winning, it was
easy to keep our mind in it. They
were the ones who had to become
frantic at the end," Fong said.
"We knew that the game was very
important when we walked in. We
were psyched — there was so
much riding on this game."
