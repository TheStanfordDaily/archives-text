TUCSON, Ariz. — The dry air
and the cactus-covered hills served
as background for Stanford's
Desert Storm yesterday. With the
sun beating down and the tempera
ture in the 80s, packets of suntan lo
tion were handed out at Sancet
Field.

sun, but the Wildcats still got

burned.
With junior Brent Hoard (3-2)
pitching a one-hitter through five in
nings and only allowing one run in
his seven innings, the Cardinal
didn't need an incredible offensive
performance to defeat the Wildcats.
And it didn't stop an incredible
offensive performance either. Scor
ing 17 runs on 18 hits, Stanford (33-
7-1, 16-5 Pacific 10 Conference

Southern Division) crushed Ari
zona 17-1. Stanford won the series
by defeating Arizona (24-20. 4-15)
fc-3 Saturday , but the Wildcats took
the opener 4-5.
"It makes it a heck of a lot easier
when you are up by 10 or 11 runs."
Hoard said.
Junior center fielder Jody Gerut
personally accounted for several of
the Cardinal's runs, going 3 for 4 at
the plate with two home runs and
four RBIs while scoring a career
high five runs. Leading the team
with 15 home runs. Gerut has hit
four home runs and has nine RBIs
against the Wildcats this season.
Still, he said there was nothing dif
ferent in the Cardinal's approach
yesterday.
"We weren't doing anything dif
ferent." he said. "Sometimes it hap
pens. and sometimes it doesn't. Lhis
weekend was a prime example of
that."
Pitching his longest game of the
year. Hoard struck out eight batters
and silenced the usually powerful
offense of the Wildcats.
"I took a different mindset,"
Hoard said. "The last couple times I
have been out there. 1 have been
thinking about mechanical prob
lems. When 1 am up on the hill. I just
need to throw. This was great."

Stanford lumped out to a 5-0 lead
in the first inning off a triple b\
sophomore first baseman John Gall
and doubles b\ Gerut and sopho

The Cardinal also scored one run in
the second, two in the fourth and
five in the fifth.
"It was a hitter's day." said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess.
"We really hit the ball well."
The Wildcats would be forced to
settle with taking one of the three
games in the series awav from the
No. 1 Cardinal.
"1 think that first loss woke us up.
fortunately." Gerut said.
After seeing why Arizona leads
the conference in batting average in
Friday night's loss, the Cardinal
came out Saturday knowing it had
to put some runs behind |umor
pitcher Chad Hutchinson (K-2) in
order to walk away with a win
"We had a talk before the game
and decided no more excuses." said
Muth. who went 1 for 2 with a home
run."I think we are moving in the
right direction. Today, we were real
ly selective."
Allowing only a solo home run

by Arizona catcher Greg Clark in
the second inning, Hutchinson kept
the Wildcats from getting another
hit until the seventh inning. By this
time, however, Stanford had scored
five runs thanks to Muth's homer
and several sacrifice flies.
"We were real fortunate we got a
good pitching performance," Mar
quess said. "The Wildcats are an
older team, and they play like it.
This was a big win for us."
The good pitching performance
didn't stop with Hutchinson, how
ever. Finding itself in a jam, leading
by only two runs with the bases
loaded, Stanford put freshman
Justin Wayne on the mound late in
the seventh inning. It might have
been the Honolulu native's first
pitching appearance at Arizona, but
he certainly didn't perform like it.
Retiring the final seven batters, five
of which he struck out, Wayne
earned his fifth save of the season
and gave Stanford the 6-3 victory
without allowing a baserunner.
"Hutchinson did an excellent job
out there, but everybody gets tired,"
Wayne said. "I was just concentrat
ing on each guy one at a time. It was
a great overall feeling to retire them
like that."
Friday night's pitching, on the
other hand, was a somewhat differ
ent story, as junior ace Jeff Austin

pitched his worst game of the year.
While Austin (9-2) may have
been having a phenomenal season, it
did not appear so in the series open
er at Arizona. Giving up four runs in
the first two innings, Austin gave the
Wildcats a lead that they did not re
linquish. With the victory, the Wild
cats became the first team to beat
the Cardinal twice this season.
"1 started off the season all
right," Austin said. "You get used to
it. You start to expect it every time
you are out there. When you have a
way subpar performance like (this),
it's tough medicine to swallow,"
A first-inning rally by the Cardi
nal amounted to only one run after
Muth was thrown out at home for
the first out and Gall was gunned
down at second.
While Austin settled down, al
lowing no hits in the third and fourth
innings, Stanford's Gerut nailed his
first of three homers in the series,
putting Stanford within one. An in
ning later, however, the Wildcats
answered when Arizona left fielder
Jason Hendricks crushed a two-run
home run that some are still waiting
to fall.
"1 didn't make adjustments
quick enough or well enough to give
us a chance to win," Austin said.
"After the third inning. I hit a streak
where I felt comfortable, but I had a
relapse I guess."
The Cardinal travels to Santa
Clara to face the Broncos tomorrow
at 7.
