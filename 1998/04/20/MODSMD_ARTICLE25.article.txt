TUCSON, Ariz. — The dry air
and the cactus-covered hills served
as background for Stanford's
Desert Storm yesterday. With the
sun beating down and the tempera
ture in the 80s, packets of suntan lo
tion were handed out at Sancet
Field.

sun, but the Wildcats still got

burned.
With junior Brent Hoard (3-2)
pitching a one-hitter through five in
nings and only allowing one run in
his seven innings, the Cardinal
didn't need an incredible offensive
performance to defeat the Wildcats.
And it didn't stop an incredible
offensive performance either. Scor
ing 17 runs on 18 hits, Stanford (33-
7-1, 16-5 Pacific 10 Conference

Southern Division) crushed Ari
zona 17-1. Stanford won the series
by defeating Arizona (24-20. 4-15)
fc-3 Saturday , but the Wildcats took
the opener 4-5.
"It makes it a heck of a lot easier
when you are up by 10 or 11 runs."
Hoard said.
Junior center fielder Jody Gerut
personally accounted for several of
the Cardinal's runs, going 3 for 4 at
the plate with two home runs and
four RBIs while scoring a career
high five runs. Leading the team
with 15 home runs. Gerut has hit
four home runs and has nine RBIs
against the Wildcats this season.
Still, he said there was nothing dif
ferent in the Cardinal's approach
yesterday.
"We weren't doing anything dif
ferent." he said. "Sometimes it hap
pens. and sometimes it doesn't. Lhis
weekend was a prime example of
that."
Pitching his longest game of the
year. Hoard struck out eight batters
and silenced the usually powerful
offense of the Wildcats.
"I took a different mindset,"
Hoard said. "The last couple times I
have been out there. 1 have been
thinking about mechanical prob
lems. When 1 am up on the hill. I just
need to throw. This was great."

Stanford lumped out to a 5-0 lead
in the first inning off a triple b\
sophomore first baseman John Gall
and doubles b\ Gerut and sopho
more left fielder Edmund \luth
Batting around in the inning. Stan
ford chased starter Tyler Haddix.
The Cardinal also scored one run in
the second, two in the fourth and
five in the fifth.
"It was a hitter's day." said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess.
"We really hit the ball well."
The Wildcats would be forced to
settle with taking one of the three
games in the series awav from the
No. 1 Cardinal.
"1 think that first loss woke us up.
fortunately." Gerut said.
After seeing why Arizona leads
the conference in batting average in
Friday night's loss, the Cardinal
came out Saturday knowing it had
to put some runs behind |umor
pitcher Chad Hutchinson (K-2) in
order to walk away with a win
"We had a talk before the game
and decided no more excuses." said
Muth. who went 1 for 2 with a home
run."I think we are moving in the
right direction. Today, we were real
ly selective."
Allowing only a solo home run
