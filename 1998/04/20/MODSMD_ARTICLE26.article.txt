MEN'S LACROSSE
■ Saturday: California 19, Stanford K.
The spirit of Big Games past was
not enough to pull the Cardinal to
victory, though, as Stanford lost the
rough battle 19-8. It could have been
the endless expanse of gold bleach
ers in Stanford Stadium that gave
the Bears the push they needed.
The game was the first round of
the regional playoffs, a single-elimi
nation bracket of eight teams. Cal
was the top seed, finishing first in its
league.
Stanford (2-9) entered the game
with only two wins to its name in a
season highlighted hv rained-out

games and frustrating losses.
The Cardinal went out seeking
revenge after a difficult 15-6 home
loss to Cal the week before.
The game got started with an ini
tial Cardinal goal, hut Cal quickly
scored to tie. Cal steadily broke the
game open, ending the first quarter
of play ahead 7-2.
As to be expected of the rivalry,
the game was decidedly physical, at
times breaking into near dogpiles in
efforts to retrieve the ball.
Although the Golden Bear bar
rage was slowed down by impressive
blocks from junior goalie Bill Mulk
erin, the Card reached the end of the
third quarter with only two goals
against Cal's 12.
Stanford set out to turn things
around in the fourth, but the come
back surge came too late.
The fourth quarter got off to a
quick start with back-to-back goals
from senior attack Ron Rhea and
junior attack Benton Williams.
Freshman midfielder Travis Meyer
scored another 10 minutes into the
quarter.

The Card scored six of its eight in
the final quarter, hut the Bears over
powered them with seven.
Also scoring were junior Brian
Auld, senior Jesse O'Hanley and
freshman Bryan Dunagan.
"Even though we lost, we had a
good time," senior defenseman and
co-captain Matt Miller said. "We
played really physical."
Stanford earned the home advan
tage for the game despite being
seeded lower than Cal. The Bears
had been placed on probation for
earlier violations. One stipulation of
the probation was that they could
not host a playoff game.
In losing to Cal in the first
matchup two weekends ago, Stan
ford gained the right to play at home.
If Stanford had beaten Cal, the
seeds would have been switched,
and the Cardinal probably would
have traveled to Sonoma State or
UC-Santa Barbara, Miller said.
Stanford will send four seniors —
defensemen Miller and Pat Orosco
and attacks O'Hanley and Rhea
to an upcoming all-star game .
