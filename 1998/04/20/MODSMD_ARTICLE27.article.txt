# Group plants oak trees near Dish
##

Magic — a community organiza
tion committed to an ecological ap
proach to real world problems
planted dozens of oak trees at the
Dish on Saturday as part of an effort
to revitalize the Foothills.
The oaks are native to the area,
according to Joan Schwan, Class of
'92.
" The native oaks are not regener
ating primarily due to human caus
es," Schwan said. Factors affecting
the native species include cattle
grazing, development and the intro
duction of alien species to the area,
such as wild oats, the predominant
grass.
Magic's tree-planting efforts
began in 1984. Since then, volun

teers have worked to plant more
than 2,000 trees in the Foothills to
help rebuild the native habitat.
Schwan cautions against charac
terizing the group's work as restora
tion.
"I think that a lot people talk
about restoration," she said. "It's
impossible to restore the area. This
is where [society hasj made choic
es.... We can't volunteer on a few
Saturdays and fix the changes."
The trees are primarily on the
northeast half of the Dish area — the
side closer to Stanford — as well as
around a new tiger salamander pond
under construction at the entrance
to the Dish.
The side of the Dish near Inter
state 280 is an example of what could
occur if no action is taken, Schwan
said.

"When 1 run out there, I imagine
the place losing trees and slowly be
coming a desert," she said, adding
that the land is currently under lease
to a local family and is subject to ex
tensive grazing from a herd of cows.
The trees planted by Magic are
distinguishable by the small white
tubes around their trunks. The tubes
protect the trees from voles, which
eat the bark of young trees. The vole
population has grown unchecked
because of vanishing local preda
tors, such as bobcats, foxes and coy
otes, Schwan said.
Anywhere from six to 50 volun
teers plant trees on any given week
end, Schwan said. "It's evolved into
an educational project. We want to
get people thinking."
Schwan became interested in the
project her sophomore year at Stan

ford when she volunteered with
Magic through Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford. She
then did her human biology intern
ship at Magic and went on to he
come a live-in member.
Magic has been active in the Palo
Alto area for more than 20 years and
has coordinated a diverse array of
projects from community mediation
to yoga classes.
Seeing the trees planted years
ago is very fulfilling, Schwan said.
" The first line of trees out by the
main gate are K to 10 feet tall and
producing acorns by now," she
noted. "It's like walking through an
oak w<K)dland."
Magic invites Stanford students
to join in Saturday tree plantings. In
terested parties should call 323-
7333.
