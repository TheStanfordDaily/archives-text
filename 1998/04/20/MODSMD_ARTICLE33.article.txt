And it all came together for the
Cardinal (24-1, 12-1 Pac-10), who
earned the win in one of the most
thrilling matches in recent memory
at the Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
Stanford's No. 3 doubles team of
sophomore Jennifer Heiser and
freshman Sarah Pestieau clinched
the triumph with a come-from-be
hind 8-6 victory over Kati Kocsis and
Brandi Freudenberg of UCLA (14-
10,8-5).
"That was a heck of a match,"
said Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan. "This ranks right up there
with the best of them in my 19 years.
Lots of tension, lots of pressure. It
really was a barn-burner."
Yet it was almost not to be for the
freshly crowned Pac-10 champions.
After singles play left the match
tied at 3-3, seniors Ania Bleszynski
and Julie Scott put the finishing
touches on two storied careers at
Stanford by blowing away Elizabeth
Schmidt and Cristina Popescu in the
No. 2 match 8-3.
But at that point, with the Cardi
nal taking a marginal 4-3 lead,
UCLA led both of the remaining
doubles matches by two games.
"It looked pretty bleak there for a
while because we were down the en
tire time in those matches," Brennan

said. "It looked like we were down
and out. I thought if we could make
a run we would be right there, but
then [UCLA] sort of went on a run.
Then all of a sudden, [No. 3 doubles]
got it going, and I thought we could
pull it out right there."
UCLA held on in the No. 1 match
as Annica Cooper and Katia
Roubanova fought off Stanford
sophomores Anne Kremer and
Teryn Ashley 8-6, tying the overall
score and making No. 3 doubles the
deciding match.
Heiser and Pestieau were down
6-4, but better net play put the Car
dinal squad right back in the set at 6-
6. With the other matches ending, all
eyes in the stadium turned to the
third court, and the home crowd
propelled the Cardinal to victory.
With the win, Stanford avenged a
5-4 UCLA victory in Los Angeles
two weeks ago, the lone blemish in
the Cardinal's dual-match record.
"I still can't figure out how
[UCLA] does it," Brennan said.
"Obviously, some of their girls feel
pretty good about playing us, and
some of our girls don't fell so posi
tive about playing them."
Singles went the same way they
did two weeks ago. Scott, Bleszynski
and Heiser won for the Cardinal,
while Cooper, Schmidt and Kocsis
were victorious for the Bruins.
Stanford now has four weeks be
fore the NCAA tournament in
South Bend. Ind., where the Cardi
nal will try to defend its title. The
only scheduled competition is indi
vidual in the Pac-10 Championships,
which crown a conference singles
and doubles champion.
"We have a lot of work to do,"
Brennan said. "Everybody has been
good at some point, and everybody
has been bad at some point. The
good news is that we haven't really
clicked yet, but we only lost once."
Stanford also defeated No. 21
USC (11-10, 4-8) Friday afternoon,
taking all six singles matches en
route to an 8-1 blowout. The Cardi

nal also took two doubles matches.
As for the seniors, Scott and
Bleszynski won both of their match
es in their final appearance at home.
Scott has won two Pac-10 singles
titles and holds the Stanford record
for dual-match wins in a season with
29. Three-time All-American
Bleszynski has appeared in the

NCAA semifinals in both singles
and doubles.
The team also recognized senior
walk-ons Heidi Stalla and Sophy
Woodhouse, who have been part of
the squad since their freshman sea
sons. Stalla compiled a 8-4 record in
her Stanford career, while Wood
house finished her career at 5-3.
