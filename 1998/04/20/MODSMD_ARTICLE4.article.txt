### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Eric Abrams, the leading scorer
in Stanford football history, is want
ed by San Francisco police on
charges of impersonating a police
officer, kidnapping and child mo
lestation.
This is the second time in two
years that Abrams has been under
investigation for crimes involving
teenage boys.
In last Tuesday's incident,
Abrams. driving a rental car. ac
costed a 13-year-old boy at New
comb and Keith avenues in San
Francisco, identified himself as a
police officer and ordered the boy
into his vehicle. San Francisco po
lice said on Friday.
Abrams "had the youth remove
his shirt and pants, ostensibly to
check for drugs," police said, before
allowing the boy to leave a short
distance.
Thirty minutes later, police al
lege Abrams made a similar request
to two boys, ages 12 and 14, on Re
vere and Keith avenues. However,
the two juveniles refused and were
let go when their mother drove up.
Police were called to the scene
and took Abrams to the Taraval po
lice station, where he made a state
ment and was subsequently re
leased. San Francis-

co Police Sgt.
Charlie Mahoney
said.
Abrams is
wanted on two
counts of attempt
ed kidnapping,
one count of kid
napping. one
count of child mo-

lestation and one count of imper
sonating a police officer.
A warrant was issued for
Abrams' arrest on Friday, and San
Francisco police said last night that
Abrams had not yet been arrested.
In four years, the place-kicker —
a native of San Diego — racked up
more points than any other lootball
player in Stanford history. He
played in the Senior Bowl in 1996
and in high school had been select
ed Player of the Year by Parade
magazine.
But his accomplishments were
marred in February 1996 when The
Daily reported that he was under
investigation for allegedly posing as
a Stanford football recruiter and so
liciting nude photos of high school
students.
Abrams was detained earlier
that year after a sting operation al
the Stanford post office where hi
was picking up a package. He w t is
not formally arrested at the time

but the investigation continued
until his arrest in March 19%.
Abrams used names of Stanford
recruiters and other football play
ers during phone calls with the high
school players, according to a
lawyer for the victims.
Tom Nolan, Abrams' lawyer
during the 19% incident, had
claimed that the charges were the
result of a prank gone awry. Nolan,
reached on Saturday, said he no
longer represents Abrams.
After his arrest in 1 99b, Abrams

pleaded no contest to seven counts
of phone harassment, a misde
meanor. He was sentenced to three
years probation, UK) hours of com
munity service and a $2(X) fine.
After the arrest, Abrams re
mained out of the spotlight until
November, when the San Jose Mer
cury News reported he was hired as
a public relations assistant for the
San Jose State University baseball
team.
Abrams, 24. is 5 feet 7 inches
with blond hair and weighs about
170 pounds. San Francisco police
ask that anyone with information
on his whereabouts call (415) 553-
1071.
