## Vaulter the first Cardinal to capture first place at the NCAA Championships 
### Molly Brizgys Contributing writer 
Sophomore Larissa Fontaine this
weekend went where no other woman
gymnast has gone before.
Saturday, Fontaine captured the indi
vidual vault title at the NCAA Champi
onships in Los Angeles, becoming not
only the first Stanford gymnast to bring
home such an honor but also the first in
dividual qualifier to capture the vault

championship in NCAA history.
Fontaine shares her title with Florida
State's Susan Hines, last year's vault
champion, who also scored a 9.8625. The
University of Georgia won the team title.
"I'm so excited, and it was so awe
some," a gushing Fontaine said, 'i am
honored I got to compete, and 1 am happy
for Stanford because it's our first national
gymnastics title. It's good to see that as a
team, we belong at nationals, and it's mo
tivating to see where we can be next year.

I would love to go back next season, hut
next time I want to be doing a whole lot
more."
Fontaine's championship weekend
began Thursday when she competed with
the Brigham Young team in the first ses
sion of the meet. After waiting through
three events, Fontaine performed her
"Yurchenko" vault and received a 9.875.
Fontaine knew her first score wasn't good
enough to make it to the finals, and she
would have to stick her landing on her

second try in order to compete Saturday.
Her second vault was nearly flawless
and grabbed her a 9.95. The score was one
of the four highest in the session, which
meant Fontaine advanced to the finals
Saturday.
Only eight gymnasts made it to the fi
nals. and Fontaine was slated to perform
her vaults last, an order that was decided
in a draw Thursdav night.
