# Students direct talent, commitment toward work
## A
						portrait of the artists 
### Jennifer Godwin Contributing writer 
The urge to create exists in
everyone. Commitment and talent
are necessary or that urge to create
may slowly be walled up and left in
the dark corners of the brain. Com
mitment is key because without it,
the work of art will never be pro
duced. Talent, of course, helps.
Stanford students are known for
their talent and their commitment,
and some of them have made the
urge to create the center of their
lives.
"Any form of art is your cre
ation," said freshman Dennis
Hwang, "not just something that
goes into other people's creations."
Junior Cori Nelson, an art major
with an focus in alternative process
photography, said. "I love creating
things, seeing things, looking for
things and combining them. I love
taking things that I love and show
ing them to people. Someday, I
want to tackle social issues, but I'm
not there yet."
Unfortunately, "showing them

to people" at Stanford is some
times difficult and restricted to a
few friends, according to Nelson.
"You spend hours working on
something and you just have it,"
Nelson said. "There's no place to
show your work around here."
The Coffee House is the obvious
exception, with it's ongoing exhibi
tion of student art. The Art De
partment lobby features a selection
of student artwork, but the glass
display cases in the basement of the
Art Department sit dusty and al
most empty.
Other students find that the Art
Department offers what they need
creatively, inspiring and develop
ing their craft.
"Other schools try to restrict
you with the curriculum, and Stan
ford sets you free," Hwang said. "I
like it a lot. It's pretty obvious that
the art department is much on a
smaller scale than say, the Comput
er Science Department or the Biol
ogy Department."
"It'd be nice if there was more
campus-wide involvement, but on a
brighter note, there have been a lot

of great speakers and lecturers. I
think it's going to change for the
better."
Nelson found that her experi
ence with a particular teacher in
the Art Department changed her
way of thinking.
"Freshman year, I started in
Photo I with Bob Dawson, and I
fell in love with it," Nelson ex
plained. "He inspired me and made
me feel like art was something that
was possible to do for a living.
"He teaches and works and ap
plies for grants, and he made me
feel like art was something I could
really do."
The balance between the cre
ative and personal is a central issue
that artists face.
Nelson said she would like to
follow in the footsteps of her in
structor.
"My dream is to apply for grants
and work on a variety of projects,"
she said.
"1 mean the art institution itself
is so chi-chi. I can't stand it. I'd like
