Hunger and Homelessness
Awareness Week began quietly
in front of the Bookstore on Fri
day as Bookstore Events Coordi
nator Jef Friedel handed a $2,425
check to Danielle Goldstone and
Lindsay Amstutz, two students
volunteering for Spoon Hunger

Relief Network.
The week, organized by Spoon
and the Stanford Homelessness
Action Coalition, will incorpo
rate several different events de
signed to increase awareness of
hunger and homelessness at Stan
ford.
"We really hope, with this
week, to make the issue of pover

ty more real to students on cam
pus." said Goldstone. a senior
and one of Spoon's coordinators.
The first event of the week is
the Oxfam Hunger Banquet
tonight in the Rickei Dining and
Performance Center. As each
person walks in.he or she will be
given a name and a brief profile
so that everyone will fall into one
of three categories based on in
come. They will then be served a
dinner according to that income.
Oxfam is a nonprofit organiza
tion that works to provide cloth
ing and food for low-income indi
viduals.
Nathan Gray — an important
force behind several organiza
tions promoting service and lead
ership. including Oxfam — will
also speak during the banquet.
Other events include a Stanford
professor panel discussion tomor
row, a "Faces of Homelessness"

homeless, will share her stories and
crafts.
"1 think that hunger and poverty
are issues not very real to people
here at Stanford," Goldstone said.
"It's such an issue around the world
and here people who rely on chari
ty to survive bring issues to campus
and make them more real to stu
dents."
The week will conclude on Sat
urday with Hunger Clean-Up — a
nationwide community service
work-a-thon — and a benefit con
cert featuring various Stanford per
formance groups. According to
Goldstone, the week will serve as a
means of "building awareness of
what's out there."
For the past three years, the
Bookstore has chosen an organiza
tion. preferably on campus, to re
ceive the proceeds from a designat
ed benefit day. Each year, the event
coordinator researches the possible
groups.
This year, Friedel decided he

liked what Spoon was doing and
the group's enthusiasm and energy.
The proceeds from other years
have gone to the Special Olympics
and the AIDS Quilt. "What's neat
about this [group] is that Spoon
doesn't have a national back
ground or name recognition,"
Friedel said. "We're really proud
that they were able to get out
there."
The benefit day took place Dec.
4 at all of the stores on campus,
which include the Bookstore and
the Track House. Each customer
was asked to make a $5 donation at
the cash register. In return, the cus
tomer received a 20 percent dis
count on all items purchased that
day.
In order to increase awareness
of the event, the Bookstore placed
advertisements in The Daily and
distributed fliers around campus.
The money that was raised will
be used to help fund this week's
events. According to Friedel, the
Bookstore is excited about the suc
cess of these events and will contin
ue to sponsor such benefit days in
the future.
