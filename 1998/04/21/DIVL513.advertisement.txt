6 Tips for Safe and legal Bicycling at Stanford
ft/D? ON THE RIGHT AND PASS ON
THE LEFT, EVEN ON "MALLS"
-*• al>>
For our safety, most of us learned to walk facing
traffic on streets without sidewalks. But biking
against traffic isn't safe — it's dangerous and
illegal because other drivers don't expect you at
intersections, and you'll collide with traffic going
the right way. Bikes are traffic — ride on the
right half of the street so you're a predictable
part of the flow.
When preparing to turn left, do move toward
the centerline, but don't cross over and bike that
last half-block the wrong way. Likewise when
entering a street, immediately cross over to the
right direction. At Tanner Fountain, keep right
and go around counterclockwise, even if your
destination is 3/4 of the way around.
Ride on the right even on shared paths. You may need to 1/ 7
move to the left of center when passing, but keep to the right
of oncoming traffic.
Speaking of passing. If you 're going slower than other traffic, move right to let
it pass (this applies to walkers as well!). Whether biking or walking, check behind
before passing or moving left (after a few minutes of practice, cyclists should be able
to do this without swerving).
