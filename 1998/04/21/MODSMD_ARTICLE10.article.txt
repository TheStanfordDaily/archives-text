### 
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Poet
and philosopher Octavio Paz, who
probed the contradictions of the
Mexican soul through prose and
verse that lost him many friends
and won him a Nobel Prize, has
died after a long illness. He was 84.
President Ernesto Zedillo
announced the death from his jet
Monday while he was returning
from the Summit of the Americas
in Chile. Mexican news reports said
Paz died late Sunday at his home in
the Mexico City neighborhood of
Coyoacan.
Paz had been sick for years with
what he called a "long and
wretched" illness. In November,
after a European news agency pre
maturely reported his death, Paz
called a television station to joke:
"It pains me that those who insist
on killing me are in such a hurry."
After a wake yesterday at the lit
erary foundation that bears his
name, politicians and writers gath
ered at the nation's Fine Arts
Palace for a memorial service for
one of their most admired sages.
Using a clear and simple writing
style that broke with Mexico's
Baroque literary traditions, Paz
explored the Mexican psyche,
including the contradiction between
its Indian and Spanish roots.
Mexico, Paz said in December, is
"a sunny country, a nation where
the sun abounds, a prodigious sun,
but also a dark and black country.
This duality has me preoccupied
since I was a child."
He still is best known for two of
his earlier works: the book-length

essay " The Labyrinth of Solitude"
and the poem "Sun Stone."
Paz won the Miguel Cervantes
Prize, Spain's most prestigious
award, in 1982. In 1987, he was
given the T.S. Eliot Award in
Chicago. And three years after that,
he captured the Nobel Prize for lit
erature.
Paz grew up on the edge of Mex
ico City. His father was secretary to
Emiliano Zapata, a peasant leader
of Mexico's 1910-1920 revolution.
When Zapata was murdered in
1919, the Paz family went into brief
exile in Los Angeles.
Back in Mexico. Paz published
his first poem when he was 16 and
his first essay a year later. During
law school at Mexico City's Nation
al Autonomous University, he
joined a Marxist student group, the
beginning of a long involvement
with leftist causes.
During college he married writer
Elena Garro, a union that produced
a daughter. Helena, then ended
angrily after two decades. In 1966,
he married Marie-Jose Tramini. I le
is survived by both wives and his
daughter.
Paz went to Spain and joined the
Republican forces fighting rightist
Gen. Francisco Franco in the civil
war. He later joined Mexico's diplo
matic service, working in France.
Japan and the United States.
In his later years, Paz lived in a
spacious apartment off one of Mex
ico City's busiest avenues, sur
rounded by thousands of books,
mementos, pre-Columbian ceram
ics and art objects.
