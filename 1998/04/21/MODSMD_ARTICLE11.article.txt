BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) â€” A jetliner
chartered by Air France with 53 people
aboard slammed into a fog-draped mountain
just after takeoff from the Colombian capital
yesterday. Rescuers found no signs of sur
vivors.
"I saw the plane crash into the top of the
mountain and flip over. A few seconds later it
blew up and our windows shook from the
explosive wave." Yesid Gonzalez, who wit
nessed the crash from his office window, told
the Radionet network. He said the jet broke
into three pieces.
At least four bodies were immediately
recovered from debris of the plane, which was
scattered in the underbrush and eucalyptus
trees that cover the side of the 10.000-foot
mountain near Bogota's airport, rescuers said.
The plane crashed into the peak three min
utes after taking off at 4:47 p.m. The aircraft,
leased to Air France by the Ecuadorian airline
FAME, was bound for Ouito. the Ecuadorean
capital, civil aviation spokesman Martin Gon
zalez said.
The Boeing 727 was carrying 43 passengers
and a crew of 10. Air France spokesman Jose
Maria Robayo told The Associated Press.
Most of those aboard Flight 422 were French
and Ecuadorian citizens who had arrived on
an earlier flight from Paris, he said. Robayo
said there were other Europeans aboard but
he did not have their nationalities.
Police said they recovered many body parts
but just four bodies. Plane debris, burned
clothing and seats were also strewn across the
mountainside.
"There are hands, feet and legs. Most of
what we have recovered are very small bodv

parts," said a police officer at the scene, Fer
nando Molino.
Scattered in the rubble were baby clothes,
purses with women's makeup, wallets with
documents and money, and a child's miniature
football.
There also was a postcard picturing the Eif
fel Tower with a message written in Spanish
and addressed to a residence in Quito.
Rescuers located the plane's flight
recorder, or black box. A police jeep trans
ported it from the crash site to investigators in
Bogota.

" The plane was flying very low," said Ser
gio Rodriguez, a 15-vear-old peasant who
lived near the erash site.
"The plane was making a very strong sound
in its engine, a sound that is not normal." said
Wilson Vargas, a worker at the Colombian
Air Force non-commissioned officer's club on
the mountainside.
Franco Emilio Erazo. TAME's representa
tive in Bogota, said at least 37 of the passen
gers had originated in France.
He said the flight was one of three weekly
on the Quito-Bogota-Quito route.
