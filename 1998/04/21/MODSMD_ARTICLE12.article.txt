# No taxes allotted for buying clean needles for drug addicts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Clinton administra
tion refused yesterday to use federal tax dollars to buy
clean needles for drug addicts, even though it said nee
dle exchanges fight AIDS without encouraging illegal
drug use.
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Sha
lala said her scientific endorsement should encourage
more communities to start their own needle exchanges.
But Shalala. under orders from the White House,
sidestepped a political fight with conservatives and
stopped short of providing communities with federal
money to let addicts swap dirty needles for clean ones.
Half of all people who catch HIV are infected by
needles or by sex with injecting drug users, or are chil
dren of infected addicts.
The decision bitterly disappointed AIDS activists,
who said they couldn't recall another medical program
the government had declared lifesaving but refused to
try to pay for.
"They've now said we know how to save lives and
we don't want to do what's necessary to save the lives,"
said an angry Dr. Scott Hitt, chairman of President
Clinton's AIDS advisory council. "This administration
is now publicly stating how to slow [the AIDS epidem
ic] down and is saying they lack the courage to do it."
"It's like saying the world is not Hat but not funding
Columbus' voyage," added Daniel Zingale of AIDS
Action.

Republicans continued to argue that needle
exchanges were bad policy, and Rep. (ierald Solomon.
R-N.Y.. said he would push for Congress to ban feder
al funding altogether in case Shalala changed her mind.
"Why not simply provide heroin itself, free of
charge, courtesy of the American taxpayer?" asked
Sen. John Ashcroft, R Mo.
President Clinton's own drug policy chief. Barry
McCaffrey, spent the weekend arguing that needle
exchanges jeopardize the administration's war on
drugs and send the wrong message to children. Offi
cials familiar with the heated debate said McCaffrey's
objections were central to killing a proposed compro
mise. a pilot project paying for needle exchanges in 10
cities.
Asked about the criticisms. National Institutes of
Health Director Harold Varmus said that they were
being made only by politicians, not scientists. Every
major public health organization has supported needle
exchanges.
The Clinton administration is counting on Shalala's
endorsement to persuade communities to expand the
110 needle exchanges now operating in 22 states. And
Surgeon General David Satcher suggested communi
ties could avoid the political impasse: Seek federal dol
lars for all other HIV prevention activities, from youth
education to drug treatment, so that local mone\ could
be directed to buv needles.
