Death row inmate Joseph John Cannon, 38. is scheduled for execution tomorrow in Huntsville,
Texas, for the death of Anne Walsh. The Foreign Affairs Committee of Italy's lower house of Par
liament passed a resolution yesterday urging the U.S. government to try to stop the execution of
Cannon, who was 17 at the time of the offense. Cannon told an Italian newspaper he had repent
ed for his crime and was ashamed to die by execution.
