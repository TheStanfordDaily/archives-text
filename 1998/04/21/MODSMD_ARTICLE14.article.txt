No more smoke in Cannabis
SAN FRANC I SCO (AP) — A sheriff reluctantly
shut down San Francisco's largest medical marijuana
club yesterday, as organizers waited in the wings to
reopen under another name.
San Francisco Sheriff Mike Hennessey served
Cannabis Cultivators Club founder Dennis Peron
with an order closing down the operation and
ordered the building vacated. Peron and his follow
ers cooperated peacefully.
The sheriff said he would not move against the
club's successor agency, the Cannabis Healing Cen
ter. which was opening under a new director at the
same site. "That has nothing to do with this court
order." he said.
Peron started the club four years ago and was a
prime mover behind the successful 19% drive for
the state's medicinal marijuana law. which allows
the sale o! marijuana to patients for medical use.
Monday, he emerged from the club with his
belongings — including a pot plant — packed in a
cardboard box.
"It's been an honor to lead you into a more lov
ing and compassionate society, and it's very sad for
me to have this moment in my life." Peron said to
the shouts of "Peron! Peron!" from 75 supporters.
