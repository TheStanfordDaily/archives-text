### 
CHICAGO (AP) In an
unusual use of a racketeering law
designed to tight the mob. a federal
jurv ruled yesterday that anti-abor
tion protest organizers used threats
and violence to shut down clinics
a verdict that could cost the move
ment millions.
Although the abortion foes
were ordered to pay only about
$25N.(MX). the class-action ruling
opened the door for more claims
by as many as I.IXH) clinics across
the country.
"This is the biggest courtroom
defeat for the anti-abortion move
ment ever," declared Fay Clayton,
an attorney for the National Orga
nization for Women, which filed the
lawsuit in NB6.

Defense attorneys said they will
appeal.
The jury found that anti-abor
tion activist Joseph Scheidler and
two associates, Timothy Nlurph\
and Andrew Scholberg. engaged in
21 acts of extortion to shut down
clinics. The jury also found that two
anti-abortion organizations, the
Pro-life Action League and Oper
ation Rescue, were part of the
scheme.
The jury ordered the three
activists and two organizations to
pay $85,92ft.92 iVi damages, which
will be tripled under the racketeer
ing law.
The damages were awarded to
abortion clinics in Milwaukee and
Wilmington. Del., for security mea

sures required after violence flared
outside their doors. But a number
of other clinics intend to file for
class-action damages under the ver
dict.
"They want to bankrupt us —
there's no question about that,"
said Scheidler. executive director of
the Pro-Life Action League.
A turning point in the case came
in 1994 when the U.S. Supreme
Court reversed lower-court rulings
and gave NOW permission to refile
the lawsuit under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organiza
tions Act.
It was the first nationwide class
action lawsuit ever filed against the
anti-abortion movement under
RICO.
