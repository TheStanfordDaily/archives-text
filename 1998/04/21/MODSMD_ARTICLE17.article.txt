New grapes programming
should take burden for
education off RAs' shoulders

Grapes education win
take on a new form starting
next fall. Dean of Students
Marc Wais and Director of Residential
Education Jane Camarillo are in the
process of forming a committee of stu
dents to improve student knowledge
of the United Farm Workers' boycott
of California table grapes. Their goal is
to develop each year a University
wide education program videotape
concerning the boycott. This is wel
come and long overdue.
For four years, resident assistants
have carried the responsibility of edu
cating students about the 1994 hunger
strike in White Plaza. RAs were asked
to put on presentations with balanced
arguments for and against serving
table grapes in their dining halls. The
fact that the Res Ed office does not
even keep track of which dormitories
have voted reveals their previously
weak commitment to this issue.
It is no surprise, then, that grapes
education at Stanford is sporadic at
best. Many RAs opt not to educate
their residents and do not conduct a
vote, while others bring in MEChA
members for a presentation that sup
plements photocopied literature and a
video discussion.
Although Res Ed does not require
that each residence hall vote on boy
cotting grapes, dormitories are encour
aged to do so. However, informing res
idents of the history of the grapes issue

at Stanford and the treatment of farm
agricultural workers in California is an
important issue, one which the Univer
sity. including RAs, should not shy
away from.
Currently, RAs who wish to educate
their residents are equipped with a
thick information packet detailing his
tory, previous University policies, a
short list of arguments for and against,
a few lengthy videos of mediocre qual
ity and the names of MEChA mem
bers who are willing to make dorm
presentations.
The present system of grapes educa
tion is not uniform, and the quality is
inconsistent and often superficial. Few
students are willing to sit through a
video longer than 20 minutes unless it
is particularly engaging. While
MEChA presentations are valuable,
no students are available to present
arguments opposing the boycott. Ide
ally, each student would be motivated
enough to read the detailed accounts
of grape history at Stanford provided
on the Internet, but this rarely occurs.
University-wide education will ease
the burden on RAs, most of whom
need to be educated about the grapes
issue just as much as any other stu
dents.
Although not all students will be
present, RAs should make a commit
ment to attend the fall program and
show the program highlights in the
videotaped version to their residents.
Providing videos of the program
will help make grapes education more
uniform campus-wide, and RAs will be
more informed.
We hope this is the first step of
many the administration will take to
ensure a deeper level of grapes education.
