# New seminars
## Provost to choose departments for more freshman programs 
### Wrenn Levenberg Contributing writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice is sched
uled to announce next week which de
partments will receive new slots for pro
fessors to teach freshman seminars.
Last year, six departments earned
billets — which are allotments of funding
for faculty positions — as part of Stan
lord's effort to focus on the first two years
of undergraduate education. Freshman

seminars, as well as sophomore seminars,
Sophomore ( ollege and the C 'ultures, Ideas and Values Pro
gram are part of the effort.
This year 24 departments submitted extensive freshmen
seminar proposals for the eight to 10 available billets, ac
cording to Ellen Woods, assistant dean for undergraduate
studies in the School of Humanities and Sciences.
In its first year, the 77 freshman seminars attracted rough
ly WX) students — on par with the University's expectations.
Freshman Jacob Klein, who took History Prof. David
Kennedy's "Reflections on the American C ondition: Amer
ican 1 listory through Literature" in the fall, said the seminar
was "a fabulous introduction to Stanford."
With a maximum enrollment of Ift. freshman seminars
stand in stark contrast to the usual I (K)-plus enrollment of in
troductory-level lecture classes.
"It was a lot of work," Klein said, but it was a good way to
dive into Stanford because "you are held more accountable."
When the University announced its Stanford Introducto
ry Studies Initiative in May I Wft. it said the effort was "aimed
at creating special opportunities lor first- and second-year
students that will help them to select a major field of study
and participate in independent research and honors pro
jects."
The goal of the freshman seminar program is to offer at
least 1(K) courses for freshmen within the next two years, ac
cording to Todd Benson, director of freshman and sopho
more seminar programs at the Undergraduate Advising
Center.
"It's a wonderful opportunity for students to get to know
a professor in their first year," Benson said.
Because of this intimate contact, "the level of feedback we
got on our papers was amazing," Klein commented.
One of freshman Liz Salas' favorite classes so far was
Assoc. Microbiology and Immunology Prof. Karla
Kirkegaard's "Modern Plagues." taught last quarter. The
one drawback. Salas said, was that she received only two
units of credit for a 20-page paper and more than KM) pages
of reading a week.
Laura Jean Torgerson is another freshman who thinks her
religious studies seminar this spring may end up being her fa
vorite class, lorgerson said she likes that "we get to talk" and
that the professor. Dean of Religious Life Bob Gregg, al-
