# New seminars
## Provost to choose departments for more freshman programs 
### Wrenn Levenberg Contributing writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice is sched
uled to announce next week which de
partments will receive new slots for pro
fessors to teach freshman seminars.
Last year, six departments earned
billets — which are allotments of funding
for faculty positions — as part of Stan
lord's effort to focus on the first two years
of undergraduate education. Freshman

seminars, as well as sophomore seminars,
Sophomore ( ollege and the C 'ultures, Ideas and Values Pro
gram are part of the effort.
This year 24 departments submitted extensive freshmen
seminar proposals for the eight to 10 available billets, ac
cording to Ellen Woods, assistant dean for undergraduate
studies in the School of Humanities and Sciences.
In its first year, the 77 freshman seminars attracted rough
ly WX) students — on par with the University's expectations.
Freshman Jacob Klein, who took History Prof. David
Kennedy's "Reflections on the American C ondition: Amer
ican 1 listory through Literature" in the fall, said the seminar
was "a fabulous introduction to Stanford."
With a maximum enrollment of Ift. freshman seminars
stand in stark contrast to the usual I (K)-plus enrollment of in
troductory-level lecture classes.
"It was a lot of work," Klein said, but it was a good way to
dive into Stanford because "you are held more accountable."
When the University announced its Stanford Introducto
ry Studies Initiative in May I Wft. it said the effort was "aimed
at creating special opportunities lor first- and second-year
students that will help them to select a major field of study
and participate in independent research and honors pro
jects."
The goal of the freshman seminar program is to offer at
least 1(K) courses for freshmen within the next two years, ac
cording to Todd Benson, director of freshman and sopho
more seminar programs at the Undergraduate Advising
Center.
"It's a wonderful opportunity for students to get to know
a professor in their first year," Benson said.
Because of this intimate contact, "the level of feedback we
got on our papers was amazing," Klein commented.
One of freshman Liz Salas' favorite classes so far was
Assoc. Microbiology and Immunology Prof. Karla
Kirkegaard's "Modern Plagues." taught last quarter. The
one drawback. Salas said, was that she received only two
units of credit for a 20-page paper and more than KM) pages
of reading a week.
Laura Jean Torgerson is another freshman who thinks her
religious studies seminar this spring may end up being her fa
vorite class, lorgerson said she likes that "we get to talk" and
that the professor. Dean of Religious Life Bob Gregg, al-


Rice
ready knows the students well.
There has been almost a "unani
mous enthusiasm" for the seminar
program from the faculty. Woods
said.
Faculty members have had the
opportunity to discuss the seminars
in a luncheon held each quarter, lien
son said he has not heard any nega
tive feedback.

Woods indicated that faculty are
so positive because they can choose
topics they are enthusiastic about.
Sometimes faculty members' pre
ferred topics are marginalized within
the department curriculum. The
freshman seminar is the forum
through which faculty can pursue
their specialized interests.
C urrently teaching "Modern
Plagues." Assoc. Microbiology and
Immunology Prof. Kasturi Haldar
said she chose to teach the seminar
because she thought it would "a lot of

fun."
In preparation lor the seminar,
she was afraid students wouldn't dis
cuss actively. However, she said the
class — made up of a much more di
verse group compared to her usual
graduate students — "has worked
out very well" and holds lively, inter
active discussions.
Last year, based on recommenda
tions of the Undergraduate Advisory
Council. Rice awarded billets to the
( omputer Science, Philosophy, Clas
sics, Psychology, Biology and Physics

departments. The council considered
the number and quality of seminars
proposed in determining the awards.
The freshman seminar program is
popular among departments partly
because a permanent faculty position
is awarded to the department via the
billet. Even if a department's seminar
class is discontinued or a faculty
member retires, the department
keeps the billet. Departments that do
not receive a billet but participate in
the freshman seminar program will
still receive some program funding.
