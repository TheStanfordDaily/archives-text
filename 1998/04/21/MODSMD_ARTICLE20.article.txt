## Celebrating the rites of spring 
### 
My freshman
year, I had the
good fortune to
live near the owner of a
conch shell. The first
sunny day in February, as
a herald to the forthcom
ing mild weather, he

sounded his shell in an epic
blast which caromed off the dormitory walls.
We all gathered outside to listen in huddled
expectation of the approaching spring.
It rained for the next 10 weeks straight.
1 don't want to get too excited about the
past week of beautiful weather, but it seems
as if the fury of El Nino has been redirected
at other parts of the country. The signs of
spring are now upon us: cloudless skies,
strawberries in the dining halls, ducks in the
Claw. Like surfacing cave dwellers, students
begin to emerge — sensitive to the sun at
first, blinking and cautious.
The first hesitation wears off and tank
tops and cut-offs replace turtlenecks and
blue jeans. Flesh is revealed, heads turn,
hormone levels rise, the rate of bike acci
dents goes up dramatically. Frosh position
themselves strategically on balconies and
lawns ami dst their unread CIV texts,
furtively eyeing prospective mates from
behind the bindings of volumes of Karl
Marx and Emmanuel Kant, fooling only
themselves.
Along with this ecstasy, spring also

brings with it the agony of the Draw. Idyllic
groups of friends are rent asunder like a
mass of unsuspecting premeds before a
Chem 35 midterm. Exclusive Draw groups,
which formedrfiometime in November, bick
er about whether the food is better in Lag
or Ricker and clamor to get priority in the
human biology or entrepreneurial spirit
theme dorms.
Often, people reveal their less-than
beautiful sides in the mass hysteria to
declare their friends. Feelings are hurt, tears
are shed and a general pall is placed over
the springtime mirth.
I have a proposal to alleviate the despair
of the Draw with the delight of spring, to
cure this blight on our otherwise Edenic
lives.
By sheer coincidence — some might say
divine providence — Draw numbers will be
available this year on the first of May. Why
not celebrate Draw as part of a May Day
festival replete with a maypole and ritualis
tic revelries?
Forget the Undergraduate Weenie Roast
and Tuition Giveaway in Frost; make room
for the bacchanalian frolic of the new and
improved Draw. Rather than expectantly
staring at the pale glow of your computer
monitor on D(raw)-Day, imagine an event
that harnesses the campus's collective hor
monal energy in an enormous fertility ritual.
Imagine the climax to Full Moon on the
Quad's tentative first kiss, an orgasmic

crescendo to the mirth of spring quarter.
Picture a maypole erected in Wilbur
Field: tens of meters high, wreathed and
braided with ribbon, resplendent in the sun
shine. Stanford's finest in their springtime
garb are dancing incessantly at its base.
Bonfires and drums provide the brilliance
and rhythm to propel the frenzied revelers,
throbbing and sweating like a single beast
throughout the night.
Why bother with how numbers are dis
tributed — preferred, unpreferred, guaran
teed. priorities 1 and 2? Let the numbers be
assigned by hair color, whether you have an
innie or an outie, whether your earlobes are
attached or not. Everyone will be having so
much fun, nobody will care about their
assignments anyway.
Draw groups would form on the spot,
bonded by the energy and merriment of the
festivities. Concerns such as compatible
sleeping schedules and shared appliances
would give way to roommate pairs founded
solely on their primal responses to each
other in the heat of the moment.
Loving couples would return to campus
years in the future, full of fond memories of
Draws past: "We first hooked up at the
Draw of "98."
It would make spring a time to remember.
