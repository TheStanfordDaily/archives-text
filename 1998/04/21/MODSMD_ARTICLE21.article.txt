The year was 1936 and the pallor of the
Depression weighed on the country.
On a Tuesday night, a fiery speaker
visited Stanford and railed against the New
Deal, the Supreme Court and Governor
Alfred Landon of Kansas, who ran for presi
dent that year on the Republican ticket.
The speaker was Norman Thomas, who
had run for president as a Socialist ticket in
every election since 1928. By the end of the
night. Thomas announced that he would run
a fifth time if nominated.
"In other words, I'm not supporting Mr.
Roosevelt," Thomas declared.
Thomas believed the New Deal didn't go
far enough to fulfill Socialist goals.
"Mr. Roosevelt did not carry out the
Socialist platform, unless he carried it out on
a stretcher," Thomas declared, as reported in
The Daily.
"Not only is the New Deal not StKialist,
but this state capitalism, this use of bread and
circuses to keep the people quiet, is largely
the necessary development of a dying social
order."

He lambasted capitalist power structures
for perpetuating imperial systems and a war
based economy.
Thomas reminded Americans that they
were not entirely protected by the oceans —
destruction in Europe or Asia could cause
social collapse in the United States.
Thomas joined the Socialist Party in 1918
after World War I. In 1921, he became editor
of The Nation. He was also one of the
founders of the American Civil Liberties
Union.
lYior to running for president, Thomas
ran for governor of New York and ran twice
for mayor of New York City. After speaking
at Stanford, Thomas ran for president two
more times but failed.
