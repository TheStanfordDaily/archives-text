# Showering with the boys
## Frats, folks and fun: Bid Week decisions 
### 
Vanessa Bartsch

THIS IS THE week, hoys. Time to
step up to the plate and take a swing.
This is the week that weeds out the
real men from those that are unhoused.
Watch out Stanford, because we have
now hit Bid Week.
For all those not familiar with Greek liv
ing, this is the week when, after two weeks of
relentless wooing and pursuing, fraternities
offer guileless freshmen and sophomores a
chance to live among them.
It is truly a time that puts hair on a chest.
Freshmen search anxiously for the perfect
match among houses offering Tiki Nights
and bouncing lawn bulls as bait.
And fraternities anxiously give bids t0...
well, just about anyone. It's all about num
bers, Baby.
I am a week too late to offer advice to the
women on campus. Those who joined soror
ities have already chosen their fates and
committed to living with 52 other women in
a redone Cowell Cluster house.
They are already romping around with
their newfound sisters, cheerfully exploring
the depths of campus social life in gleeful

solidarity.
We won't mention the few women left
behind, not offered the bids of their choice,
crying in Toyon at the prospect of having to
live without sorority formals and a cushy
Suite.
But the men are still free agents. Players
in the draft with signing bonuses popping up
everywhere.
And I have some advice to offer them.
Not that I have any sort of Greek con
nection. I am not in a sorority. I have never
been in a sorority. I have never wanted to be
in a sorority.
But I do know lots of men. Some are in
fraternities, have been in fraternities or have
wanted to be in fraternities.
I also know a whole lot of people who
have no affiliation to Greek life. That gives
me wonderful distance and perspective.
So you, young men, who are wondering
what to do with those bids, start with these
steps:
Step 1: Think long and hard about the
sort of life you want to lead here. Where you
live and who you live with will influence

every aspect of your daily existence for the
next two to three years. If studying is a high
priority, don't join a frat.
If you want to live in an environment of
extreme cultural sensitivity and pristine liv
ing conditions, don't join a frat.
If you want to meet tons of people, have
a lot of fun and make connections that will
land your sorry liberally educated butt a job
after you graduate, join a frat.
Step 2: Think about which frat you want
to be associated with. It is a reputation thing.
Ask any non-Greek, mildly aware person on
campus. She can tell you where it's at.
There is the Date Rapist frat. the Fit of
Sin frat, the Weird Guy frat. the Nice Guy
frat, the Un-frat, and even the Let's Take a
Sake Bomb Through the Nose frat.
Hey, I didn't make those names up.
But seriously, talk to your female friends.
Ask them whether they would want you to
escort them home if they were drunk at a
party and you belonged to any of those frats.
When you buy into the system, you take
on a name and a reputation just by associa
tion. So if you want to be known as an ass

hole, there is a place for you II you want to
he known as a nice guy. there is also a sepa
rate place for you.
No matter what!rat you choose, you will
take on a stigma. What we outsiders see is
just one big old continuous party going on
out there on the fringes of campus.
Most people don't frequent the innards
of frat houses for occasions other than Fri
day night madness. And what we see there
ain't pretty: cheap beer, scantily clad female
frosh and sketchy boys looking to get laid.
Sure, that is a gross stereotype, but that's
the way it is.
I don't see the community service efforts
or the support network. I see Natty Lite and
New Order. Until I got to know a few proud
Greeks, I thought that was the extent of let
tered life.
Greeks may hate ignoramuses like me for
my closed-mindedness. but I had no reason
to think otherwise.
And in my defense, Greeks don't make it
easy to draw a different picture. A house full
of 40 loud men romping around in glut
tonous pursuits is not the most inviting place

to hang out.
Mut it I were a guy. I'd probably be pret
ty darn stoked about fraternities. Food. Fun.
Foster's. Flatulence. Fornication. Friend
ship. Fabulous.
So. proceed to —
Step 3: J( )IN ONE. If you have a bid. you
like a frat and you don't want to live in West
Lag for the rest of your undergraduate life,
join a frat.
Vou are assured a house with your
friends and preferred lifestyle for the dura
tion of your stay at Stanford — that is,
assuming your frat brothers don't light a
couch on fire and toss it out the window
while the University president is walking by.
I'll be damned if I wouldn't grab the
opportunity to live like that.
So. do what you must. Choose the path of
your life.
Mut choose well, because We'll be watch
ing. mavbe with envy.
