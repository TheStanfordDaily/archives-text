# NIH increases funding for School of Medicine

The National Institutes of Health increased funding
to the School of Medicine by 11.4 percent in 1997, mak
ing Stanford seventh in the nation among medical
schools obtaining federal funding.
Stanford received $144.9 million last year, including
awards for research and training. Only Johns Hopkins
University received a larger increase in funding over
the previous year.

It is the faculty who write these grant
proposals, and therefore I think this is a
direct reflection of the quality of the faculty
in the School of Medicine'
— Edward Holmes

Edward Holmes, senior associate dean for research
at the Medical School, said that since the NIH funding
increase "was the second largest in the country and it
occurred on top of a substantial existing research base,
it is a ... remarkable accomplishment. It is the faculty
who write these grant proposals, and therefore I think
this is a direct reflection of the quality of the faculty in
the School of Medicine."
Stanford's seventh-place ranking, Holmes said, re
flects that "Stanford Medical School faculty are the
best funded per principal investigator in the country,"
according to statistics compiled by the Association of
American Medical Colleges.

Two factors that likely contributed to this increase
in funding are the use of research process managers
and the caliber of the Medical School's researchers.
The Research Management Group — begun in
1995 and now being used throughout S(i percent of the
Medical School — involves research process managers
who organize the review of research proposals, elimi
nating multiple proposal reviews in the Medical
School.
"Before, it was a fragmented proposal process,"
said Kathleen Thompson, grant manager for the man
agement group.
Currently, research process managers are assigned
to different departments and have signing power, so
the proposals don't have to go through as many peo
ple. The management group "has made submitting
proposals less painful so that people are more likely to
submit them," Thompson said. This leads to more NIH
funds, she added.
Holmes said that the caliber of research at the Med
ical School helps draw funding.
"Although not a large school, there is broad repre
sentation in biomedical research," he said.
"I don't think it would be possible to see this level of
growth in one or two programs; this requires excel
lence spread across many basic science and clinical dis
ciplines."
But. in the end, "this increase is a direct reflection of
the quality of science being conducted in the School of
Medicine," Holmes said. "These are peer-reviewed
grants that received close scrutiny by the best investi
gators in the country."
