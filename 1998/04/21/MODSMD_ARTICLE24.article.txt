play great defense and execute our
plays."

WOMEN'S WATER POLO
■ Sunday: Stanford 7. UC-Davis 2.

Stanford opened the game with a
goal in the first quarter from sopho
more Elissa Keszler. In the second
period of play, sophomore hole-set
Ellen Estes drew two 4-meter penal
ties which were shot and scored by
sophomore Su/.e Gardner. Stan
ford's lead improved by two in the
third quarter, with goals coming
from freshman Kris koblik and ju
nior Lindsay Welsh.
The Cardinal defense held the

Aggies scoreless until the last 24 sec
onds of the third quarter when
Davis' Kim Parker scored on a 6-on
-5 advantage. Alice Wallace scored
the second and final goal for the Ag
gies in the fourth quarter. Stanford's
final points canie from Welch, who
scored her second goal of the game,
and from sophomore Lindsey Har
row. who scored the final goal of the
match. Stanford's goalie, junior
1 leather Crary, tallied five saves for
the Card.
The Cardinal coaching staff man
aged to get every player in the water
during the first quarter, which made
the win an obvious team effort.
"It really built confidence in the
entire team." Cila/er said, 'it wasn't
important what individuals were
doing."
Stanford's depth is one of its
biggest assets as the team approach
es the final tournaments of the sea
son. It has been the ability of the
coaches to rely on the entire bench
for consistently high quality play that
has allowed Stanford to defeat some
of its strongest adversaries.
"If we win at nationals, it'll be the
depth that does it." Welsh said.
"Every person on our team can plav
1(K) percent, and that puts us over the
top compared to the other teams."

Sunday's game marked the end of
regular season play — this weekend
Stanford hosts the Western Regional
tournament that will determine
which teams travel to nationals.
"We solidified our position in the
Mountain Pacific [Sports Federa
tion] with this game," Welsh said.
"We know how to play our system
and our level."

Stanford will face rivals UCLA
and California — ranked first and
third, respectively — at this week
end's tournament. Stanford has won
its last two matches against Cal de
spite having fallen to the Bears twice
in the preseason. UCLA is undefeat
ed. although Stanford came within
two points of the Bruins at the VIPSF
championships two weekends ago.

"I definitely think we can win at
nationals." Welsh said. "We're prac
ticing the little things all the time. We
have our own Stanford style of play,
but we also have other weapons we
can use at the end of the season to
take the other teams by surprise."
Stanford will have to play well this
weekend in order to secure its seed
for the national championships.
