BASEBALL
■ Tonight: No. 1 Stanford (33-7-1)
vs. Santa Clara (22-20) at Buck Shaw
Stadium. 7 p.m.

The Broncos (22-20) have suf
fered a string of losses at the hands of
the Cardinal in the '98 season, includ
ing a 15-2 Cardinal home-opener vic
tory Jan. 23, a 7-5 Cardinal win Jan.
24 at Sunken Diamond and an 8-3

Stanford win at Santa Clara Feb. 24.
In the most recent matchup be
tween the two. Cardinal sophomore
first baseman John Gall went 2 for 5
with three RBIs. Two of Gall's RBIs
came in the seventh inning, as he sin
gled home a pair of runs to increase
Stanford's lead to 5-1. Todd Hughes
had two hits for Santa Clara.
Freshman right-hander Jason
Young struck out five batters in 3.2
innings of relief work to pick up his
first win of the season, while fresh
man lefty Brad Drew picked up the
save.
Since that time, the Broncos have
struggled through a dismally
mediocre season. Most recently, the
squad suffered a five-game losing
streak, culminating in an IK-2 humili
ation by Pepperdine April IS.
The Broncos, however, refused to
capitulate and posted a 4-3 win over
the Waves the following day.
For the record, the Broncos have
posted 15 come-from-behind victo
ries this season, including four games
in which the team has rallied from at
least a three-run deficit.
Potential threats to the Cardinal
squad include senior outfielder Bill
Mott. whose career batting average
of .358 (165 for 460) ranks fourth on

the school's all-time top 10 list behind
Gene Deylon (.407; 1971-74).
The Cardinal, meanwhile, has
streaked through perhaps one of its
best seasons in Farm history.
Against Arizona, junior center
fielder Jody Gerut and junior third
baseman Josh Hochgesang each
drove in four runs, leading top
ranked Stanford to a 17-1 victory over
the Wildcats Sunday afternoon and
giving the Cardinal a 2-1 series victo
ry.
Junior lefty Brent Hoard (3-2),
finished an impressive day on the
mound, scattering just three hits over
seven innings while striking out eight.

Two of Hoard's three wins this sea
son have come against Arizona.
Seven members of the Card's
starting lineup are batting over .3(X).
while Gall leads the squad with a
hard-hitting .380.
As a team. Stanford has outscored
its opponents by a whopping 330-171
on the '98 season and tallied an un
precedented 16-game winning streak,
snapped March 1 with a 4-2 loss at
Arizona State.
Tonight's game will pose another
opportunity for Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess to send several
younger Cardinal players to the
mound.
