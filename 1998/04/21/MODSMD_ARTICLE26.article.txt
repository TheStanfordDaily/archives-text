# Striders succeed at Mt. SAC
## 
### Ben Allen 
The titans of track and field
clashed this weekend as Stanford
athletes did battle with some of
the sport's finest collegiate and
professional competitors at the
Mt. San Antonio College Relays
in Walnut, Calif.
In classic Stanford fashion, all
of the Cardinal athletes proved
their mettle with outstanding
marks including numerous per
sonal bests, a new 5,000-meter
school record and an unbelievable
sub-four minute mile from fresh
man Gabriel Jennings.
The competition at Mt. SAC
was fierce from the beginning, as
freshman sensation Julia Stamps
led the Cardinal charge in the
women's 3,000-meter run Friday
evening. Stamps, closely tailed by
senior Monal Chokshi and fellow
freshman Sally Glynn, stole the
lead from lackadaisical early pace
setters and began to fearlessly
challenge older runners.
Stamps' gutsy move took its toll
in the end, but despite fatigue, she
was still able to hang on for sev
enth place in an NCAA provision
al qualifying and personal-best
time of 9 minutes. 21.51 seconds.
Chokshi and Glynn also posted
provisional marks, placing 10th
(9:27.11) and 11th (9:29.38), re
spectively.
On the men's side, sophomore
Brad Hauser's blistering 13:35.98
in Saturday's 5,000 meter shaved
almost four seconds from brother
Brent's previous school record.
Brad Hauser finished seventh
overall and third among collegians
while Brent Hauser, also a sopho
more. was 12th overall in 13:42.37.
Both times surpassed automatic
national qualifying standards, and
freshman Gabe Jennings' 13:57.28

finish was a provisional qualifier
and a personal best.
As if the weekend's action had
not already been hot enough.
Stamps and Jennings both re
turned to the track on Sunday in
search of glory in the middle-dis
tance races. Stamps cruised to an
other personal record in the 1,500
meters with a ninth-place 4:21.41,
while Jennings, apparently un
fazed from his 5.000-meter ex
ploits, carved himself a spot in
Stanford history.
A surprise addition to the mile
start list. Jennings joined sopho
more Michael Stember and fresh
man Jonathan Riley against a field
lull of professional athletes and
college all-stars primed for a sub
four minute charge.
The opening pace was torrid,
but Jennings wasn't satisfied.
"I went out a little slow," said
Jennings, "so 1 knew I had to kick
hard."
Jennings made his big move
with 300 meters to go. surging past
post-collegians into the lead and
sprinting toward the line.
"I was running scared," Jen
nings said, indicating that his
worry may have cost him the win.
But when the dust settled. Jen
nings found himself atop all colle
giate competition, edged only by
professionals Richie Boulet and
Hector Torres. His time of 3:59.32
was etched into the Cardinal
record books as the fastest fresh
man mile in school history. Riley
finished eighth in 4:03.45, and
Stember was 10th in 4:04.68.
Lananna was also very pleased
with the marks of other athletes.
He pointed out the efforts of
Justin Strand, who threw the
hammer 207 feet, 3 inches on his


Freshman Julia Stamps, running at the Stanford Invitational, set
personal bests this weekend at the Mt. SAC relays in the 1,500 and
3,000 meters.
opening attempt to qualify for
NCAAs, and Jason Perscheid,
who also provisionally qualified in
the 10,000-meter run with a time
of 29:52.
"I think we had great perfor
mances all the wav around,"

Lananna said.
Conspicuous in their continued
absences were distance aces Mary
Cobb, a junior, and senior Jason
Lunn, who have been struggling
through injury all season.
Lunn, who has been nursing
Achilles tendonitis, is in his last
year of racing for the Cardinal.
Cobb has not yet red-shirted a
track season, but her return from

an early season foot stress fracture
is expected any day.
The Cardinal hope to have all of
its athletes prime for competition
in this weekend's Penn Relays and
California State Championship.
The Penn Relays, the biggest
track meet held in the country,
runs tomorrow through Saturday.
Highlights will be telivised Satur
dav on CBS beginning at 10 a.m.
