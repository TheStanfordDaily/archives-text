feated Gottesleben in two sets, 6-

was also "a little tentative" in his
match against Kukal, but that "he
found a way to win." Goldstein
closed out his match with a score
of 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.

Jason Cook 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.

match against Brandon Kramer,
but won, 7-5. 3-6, 6-2.
"Paul, Alex and Geoff waited
for things to happen when they
needed to go after the match,"
Whitlinger said. "They could
have been a little more attacking,
a little more aggressive, but they
let too many things happen."
"I thought we competed really
well." Gould said. "We didn't get
intimidated by our surroundings.
It was a tremendous result. You
can't end on much more of a high
than that."
