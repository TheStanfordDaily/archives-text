Stanford's top-ranked men's tennis team
closed out its regular season dual-match play
with two wins over UCLA (14-7, 7-5 Pacific 10
Conference) and USC (15-5. 7-5) down in Los
Angeles this weekend.
In away games, the Cardinal had only swept
the tough Los Angeles teams — UCLA is cur

— three times in the past 32 years. Stanford
(24-0. 12-0) chalked up one more sweep this
weekend, though, with dominating wins over
both teams.
