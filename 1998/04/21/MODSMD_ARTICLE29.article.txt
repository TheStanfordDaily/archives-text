### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
In an anticlimactic announce
ment. Stanford two-sport star
Kristin Folkl said she has elected to
forego her remaining basketball el
igibility and pursue what will sure
ly be multi-million dollar opportu
nities in women's professional bas
ketball.
Folkl. a three-time NCAA
champion in volleyball, is set to
graduate in June with a bachelor's
degree in economics. However, be
cause she sat out the bas
ketball season to try out for the
I S. Olympic volleyball team, she
had one season of eligibility re
maining.
But much to the chagrin of Car
dinal women's basketball. Folkl
felt it was time to move on.
"I just felt the time was right,
with graduating in June and the ex
citing opportunities to pla\ profes
sional sports in the I 5.." Folkl said
in a statement. "I feel \er> fortu
nate to have choices that women a
few years ago did not have."
Folkl declined to comment fur
ther when reached by phone last
night.
The Stanford senior leaves be
hind a remarkable athletic legacy
that will be hard to match.
Not only did she lead the volley
ball team to three titles and four
Final Four appearances, but she

also helped the basketball team
win the Pacific 10 Conference title
three times to go along with a pair
of Final Four appearances.
This past \ ear. Folkl joined the
basketball team six days after a
grueling five-game volleyball tilt
with Penn State in the NCAA final
Dec. 20. The Card promptly went
on an 18-1 tear to close out the reg
ular season, and the team seemed
primed for another Final Four run.
Folkl fell victim to a torn anteri
or cruciate ligament (ACL) in her
left knee March 10 prior to Stan
ford's loss to Harvard in the first
round of the NCAA tournament.
Nevertheless, she was selected to
the kodak Ail-American team in
basketball.
As excited as I am about play
ing professionally. 1 am also sad to
be leaving two terrific athletic pro
grams. basketball and volleyball."
Folkl said. "1 cherished my time at
Stanford as a student-athlete."
Fortunately, she will be able to
keep her two-sport status beyond
Stanford. She is a lock for the next
I S. Olympic volleyball team, and
playing professional basketball
will not jeopardize her volleyball
plans.
Folkl continues to remain mum
on what league she will make her
mark in With the WNBA draft
April 2V and the ABL draft a week
later, the clock is ticking and both
leagues eagerly await her decision.
