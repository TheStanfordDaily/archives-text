Exhausted but elated from a tough weekend in
Houston, Stanford men's rugby is looking for
ward to a week of recovery. The Cardinal will
make its third straight appearance in the Final
Four after winning regionals this past weekend in
Houston.
Stanford was paired against Virginia Tech
Saturday in a grueling match overcome by mud
and rain. Though playing conditions were diffi
cult, Stanford played tough defense and eon
trolled the tempo of the game.
The score at the half gave the Card a 17-0 ad
vantage. In tune with the first half, Stanford
maintained its level of play and only allowed the
1 lokies to score in the final minutes.
Seniors Mike Weiner and Nathan Rundell led
the Cardinal in offense scoring five tries, collec
tively. Fellow senior Dave Warter added three
conversions and one penalty kiek allowing the Card
to win 24-12.

MEN'S RUGBY
■ Saturday: Stanford 24. Virginia lech 12.
■ Sunday: Stanford 29. Air Force 22.

Air Force destroyed UC-Santa Barbara in its
match Saturday giving it the opportunity to take
on the Cardinal in the regional finals Sunday. The
Falcons were known as a strong and physical
team, hut the Card came prepared.
Scoring first in the game, the Cardinal offense
appeared strong. Defensively though, the Card
let down, allowing many Air Force players to
break through tackles on their way to the end
/one. The Falcons' running game gave them a
lead of 10-7 at the 20-minute mark. Stanford
scored two more times but also conceded a score

right before the half to lead 19-15 at the break.
Air Force controlled much of the second half
leading 22-19 for a majority of the time. Stanford
finally got the offense going with a penalty kiek
from Warter, leveling the seore 22-22.
Still, the Card missed opportunities until
Weiner scored with six minutes left in the game.
The Falcons relentlessly attacked on offense
but only managed to make it into the end zone
once time had expired. Stanford's defense

stopped the seore, allowing the Cardinal to come
away with a 29-22 victory.
"Air Force went in the end zone with no time
left," said coach Franck Boivert. "Heroic defense
from our team did not let the Air Force player
touch it down."
Warter, Weiner. and seniors Tom Efird and
Ryan Delee all scored tries for the Cardinal.
Warter also added three conversions and one
penalty kick.
