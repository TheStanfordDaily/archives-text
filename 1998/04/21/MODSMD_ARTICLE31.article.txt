### Molly Brizgys Contributing writer 
Despite the most competitive
district championships in over 10
years, the Stanford women's sail
ing team came out with a second
place finish this weekend at the
Women's Pacific Coast Champi
onship at Lake Lopez in San Louis
Obispo.
The team tied UC-lrvine with 65
points. Since the regatta ended in a
tie.the victory went to Irvine be
cause the Anteaters beat Stanford
more times in the course of the
weekend. The second-place finish
assured the Card a spot at nationals
May 28-30.
Sophomores Anika Leersen and
Alexis Krivkovich led Stanford in
the A division with a second-place
finish behind Irvine.
"We were really excited we qual
ified because that was the team's
goal." Leersen said. "We got to
where we were by sailing conserva
tively."
Freshman Heather Porter, who
only started sailing this season after
a knee injury kept her out the entire

fall, and sophomore Caroline Sumpf
led the way in the B division, win
ning handily by 10 points.
"1 think the whole team sailed
well," Porter said. "We really
worked well together and all en
couraged each other. We all wanted
to do our best, and we did."

SAILING
■ Last weekend: Women's sailing
placed fifth at the Women's Pacific
Coast Championship.

Bourdow was worried about the
regatta for the first time since he's
been coaching at Stanford (10
years), since the league has gotten
increasingly competitive. Last year
there were two competitive teams
but this year. Hawaii, Irvine, IJSC
and UCLA were all in contention
for first place.
"I'm just happy we qualified,"
Bourdow said. "Usually at districts
it's a question of how much we're
going to win by, and 1 am usually
able to sail everybody. This year, I
had to put in my best sailors, and it
was riijht down to the wire."

Saturday, the team started off
consistently and was in second place
by a point going into the second day
of the regatta.
However, the conditions
changed rapidly and a mishap oc
curred in the final race of the day
that cost the Card first place and al
lowed Irvine to win for the first time
in 10 years.
After the wind picked up. Bour
dow substituted Taylor Robinson
for Sumpf. Although Sumpf and
Porter had sailed 10 races together
over the weekend, Bourdow
thought the combination of Robin
son and Porter would fare better in
the heavy wind.
However, the boat capsized be
fore the start, which meant Stanford
was in 11th place after starting over
a minute late. The duo ground back
and went fast enough to catch five
boats and finish in sixth place.
The team qualified nonetheless.
"I think they were just a little
rusty sailing together and had a mis
communication." Bourdow said.
"Heather did quite well, and I am
happy she stepped it up this week
end."
