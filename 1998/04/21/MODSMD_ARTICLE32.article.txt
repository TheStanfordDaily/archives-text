### Young Paik 
There has always been consider
able clout about the "East Coast ver
sus West Coast" battle.
When it comes to sports such as
ice hockey and lacrosse, the colle
giate powerhouses have traditional
ly been located in the East: even the
sport of table tennis has its roots
there, too.

TABLE TENNIS
■ Last weekend: Stanford finished
fifth at the national table tennis tour
nament.

This weekend, however, saw
some of the East's athletic power
shifting west when Stanford's own
table tennis team showed up at the
National Collegiate Table Tennis
Championships in Princeton, N.J.
In only its first trip to the national
championship, the Cardinal not only
became the first West Coast team to
ever play in the tournament but also
surprised many by placing fifth.
The team was led by solid play
from Vineet Agarwal and South
African Greg Smith, two of the top
freshmen in the country. Smith was
key in providing a 2-1 upset over
Gong Jer Yeh of lona at the champi
onship.
"Yeh is a great player, but I ex
posed his weaknesses and mixed up
my shots to pull out a win." Smith
said.
Despite being only a freshman.
Smith has extensive international

playing experience under his belt.
Representing South Africa about
a half-dozen times, his accolades
include a bronze medal from the
1993 World Maccabiah Games in
Israel.
Stanford faced a difficult first day
of preliminary matches but never
theless fared well in recording victo
ries over Princeton, NYU and Johns
Hopkins 11.
Losses came at the hands of even
tual champion Michigan and lona,
who placed third in the tournament.
The second day for the Cardinal in
eluded losses to the defending
champion Maryland and a heart
breaker to Johns Hopkins I.
Finishing on a high note, though,
Stanford defeated Columbia to
place fifth overall.
Agarwal, or " Agar-Wall," as he is
nicknamed for great blocking, also
played strongly at the champi-

unship. Agarwal used a balanced of
fensive attack combined with defen
sive tactics in his success against the
top players from Columbia.
"Everything fell into place,"
Agarwal said. "I hit my offensive
shots and blcr\ed attacks as well."
Agarwal has considerable ex
perience, having played in the
U.S. Open and U.S. National
Championship. He also garnered
junior doubles runner-up awards
at both.
As the veteran member of the
three-man crew, junior Eric Fried
man rounded out the team's quality
play. Friedman's major win came
against the higher-ranked Max
Hrabrov in the Cardinal's 4-0 victo
ry over NYU.
Commenting on Stanford's suc
cess at the tournament, Friedman
said that "Stanford is on its way up in
the table tennis world."
