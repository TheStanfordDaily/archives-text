# Undergrads move into Cro Mem

Despite a shortage of on-eam
pus housing for graduate students,
the University placed three under
graduates in Crothers Memorial
Hall this quarter.
However, the decision to do so
was made only because no gradu
ate students were waiting for on
campus housing, according to
Kathleen Bransfield. manager of
Housing Assignment Services.
The three undergraduate
women who walked in to Crothers
Memorial were returning from
overseas study. Spaces remained in
undergraduate housing for male
students but not for women. Brans
field explained.
Both graduate and undergradu
ate on-campus housing has been
hard to come by this year. Last
July. 591 graduate students seeking
on-campus housing were put on the
waiting list, despite the opening of
two new graduate housing com
plexes.
The housing shortage has led to
the proposal of various changes to

residences, including converting
most of Crothers Memorial from
singles to one-room doubles next
year.
The fact that no graduate stu
dents remained on the waiting list
at the beginning of this quarter is
normal, Bransfield said.
Although a large number of
graduate students seek on-campus
housing in fall and winter quarters,
that number usually dwindles to
zero bv spring quarter, she ex
plained.
"There are specific cycles when
students need housing. It's typical
that in the spring, there are open
ings." Bransfield said.
"Most students who can't get
on-campus housing after the first
week of school find off-campus so
lutions. That's not to say that there
isn't a demand but that people have
found solutions."
Part of the reason the under
graduates were assigned to
Crothers Memorial was because
they did not register for guaranteed
housing on time for this quarter.
Bransfield said. The University
policy for housing is that all under

graduates with guaranteed housing
will be assigned housing by the first
week of school.
"There were no graduate stu
dents who continued to show up for
walk-in housing after the second
week," Bransfield said. "We had
assigned all the graduate students
who needed housing at that point."
Maria Meyer, the student affairs
specialist at Crothers and Crothers
Memorial, agreed. "Housing as
signment services puts undergrad
uates in graduate housing only
â€¢when there is no space in under
graduate housing and there is extra
space for graduate housing," she
said.
Graduate students still get pri
ority for graduate housing. Stu
dents on waiting lists are encour
aged to come to walk-in housing as
signments. Assigning undergradu
ates to Crothers Memorial "was
not intended nor was there any
negative impact on graduate stu
dents." Bransfield said.
Putting undergraduates in
Crothers Memorial is not without
precedent. According to Meyer,
undergraduates stayed in Crothers

Memorial after the l l >>y Loma Pri
eta Earthquake due to laek of safe
housing.
Asked if having undergraduates
has impacted the dorm, graduate
resident assistant Jesse Adams
said, "I wouldn't say so It's three
people out of 128. You can't even
notice them in the midst of all the
noise around here."
Catherine Rose, another gradu
ate resident assistant, said she
hasn't even met the undergradu
ates since they've moved in.
"1 guess they're upperclussmen
who don't need any assistance from
me," she said.
Living with undergraduates,
however, has given the graduate
students some laughs.
One of the undergraduates sent
an e-mail to the Crothers Memori
al list asking for a ride to San Diego
last week.
"It was funny when we got the e
mail," Rose said, "because we said
to each other, 'Like we have time
for that kind of stuff as graduate
students!'"
None of the three undergradu
ates could be reached for comment.
