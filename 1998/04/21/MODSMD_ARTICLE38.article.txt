# Students plan Earth Week activities
## 
### Nicola Skidmore 
Every day is Earth Day to people
concerned about increasing environ
mental awareness.
Still, the 2Kth annual Earth Day —
designed to emphasize environmen
tal issues that need year-round atten
tion — is tomorrow.
By then. Stanford will be halfway
into Earth Week 1998.
Earth Week at Stanford is formal
ly organized bv the Environmental
Representatives Network, which has
coordinated activities for the past few

years. The program involves repre
sentatives from each dormitory who
promote awareness of environmen
tal issues through activities such as re
cycling.
The goal of Stanford's Earth
Week is to "promote campus aware
ness through a variety of [activities]"
ranging from recycling to gardening,
said sophomore Janet Larsen. one of
this year's coordinators for the Envi
ronmental Representatives Net
work.
Stanford has a number of environ
mental groups, and environmental

awareness activities year-round on
campus. Larsen noted.
On a campus that is already envi
ronmentally active. Earth Week
serves as "a little reminder." said
Julie Kay. a senior and Synergy
House resident.
Earth Day might help someone to
"question how you live" and pro
vides "a little consciousness-raising
for somebody who doesn't think
about it on a daily basis." she added.
The week features numerous
events on campus pertaining to the
earth and environmental issues.

On Wednesday — Earth Day it
self— at S p.m., architects from New
Mexico will speak in Cubberley Au
ditorium about energy-efficient
homes called Earthships.
Students can take advantage of
opportunities to learn about the
Stanford outdoor environment as
well. On Friday from 2:30 to 6 p.m.,
people can spend time tin the Stan
ford Community Farm. On Satur
day from 9 a.m. to noon, there will
be a discussion of California oaks
and other native plants on Stanford
lands.
