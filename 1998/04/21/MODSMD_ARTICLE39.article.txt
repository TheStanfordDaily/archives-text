# Multiple voting eliminated in election
## 
### Bill Bowen Contributing writer 
Responding to concerns about
possible computer-related voting
problems in ASSI/ elections. ASSU
election officials revised their pro
cedures this year to avoid the cast
ing of multiple votes by an individ
ual student.
Two issues regarding the Inter
net-based voting system were
brought to the attention of ASSU
election officials by concerned stu
dents.
Last year, some students cast
multiple votes for ASSU officers via
the write-in blanks. The computer
allowed students to write in candi

dates multiple times on the same
form, using slightly different forms
of the candidates' names. For exam
ple. a student could have used a
middle initial in one blank and ex
cluded it in another.
Perkel said the ASSU had antici
pated this and had taken the appro
priate measures to guard against it
this year.
"The write-in problem was not a
problem this year." Perkel said.
"We anticipated that problem and
caught the incidents of it.
"We will alert all candidates next
year that they cannot be written in
multiple times in different forms. It
won't work."
Perkel explained that all write-in

votes were cross-checked by hand
and by computer, ensuring their le
gitimacy.
However, the computer system
still allowed coterminal students to
vote twice, once as an undergradu
ate and once as a graduate student.
Matt Blythe. Junipero resident
computing consultant and a coter
minal student, commented. "As an
experiment. I voted both as an un
dergraduate and graduate student .
The program did not check to see if
I voted twice."
Perkel explained that coterminal
students are registered as both un
dergraduate and graduate students.
He admitted that the problem exist
ed but claims it has now been fixed.

"There were some, but not
many, incidents of coterms voting
twice. This was a basic mistake in
the program. However, no votes
were counted twice," he said.
Perkel explained that some
coterminal students were trying to
vote solely as graduate students but
were forced by the computer to vote
also as undergraduates. He said that
coterminal students will be given a
choice in the upcoming runoff elec
tion whether to vote as graduate stu
dents or undergraduates.
Perkel also emphasized that all
instances of multiple voting,
whether benign or malicious, were
discovered and did not affect the
outcome of the election.
