American studies and Native
American history professor at the
I Iniversity of Washington, will join
Stanford's History Department
next fall.
White will he Stanford's first
full professor with a specialty in
Native American studies.
His appointment in February
came after a year's worth of re
cruitment on the part of members
of the History Department and the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
Stanford was particularly at
tractive to White because of its fac
ulty. students and attention to the
field of Native American studies.
" There were a variety of factors
involved in my decision to teach at
Stanford." White said. "There are
people there with a very active in
terest in what I'm interested in.
Also, the undergraduates are a
very bright and interesting group
to work with."
Stanford has allowed students
to major in Native American Stud
ies since the 1995 development of

the Program in Comparative Stud
ies in Race and Ethnicity, which
also includes the African Ameri
can. Asian American and Chicano
/ ( hicana studies majors.
However, the University cur
rently has no professors in the His
tory Department who teach Native
American studies.
White earlier refused an offer
from Harvard I'niversitv and ulti
mately. after nine months of delib
eration. declined the University of
Washington's counteroffer.
The decision to leave Washing
ton. White said, was particularly
difficult, especially since he was a
doctoral student at Washington
and had taught there for eight
years.
"I feel very badly about it."
White said. "I have a real attach
ment to the school, my colleagues,
the students."
White may have been swayed
"because we are the premiere uni
versity in the part of the U.S. that
he studies." said Prof. Norman
Naimark. chair of Stanford's His
tory Department. "We also have a
terrific historv department, which I
think he wanted to join. And we
have programs, like CSRE and en
vironmental studies that reflect
many of his own interdisciplinary
interests."
White will be coming to Stan
ford with a distinguished past.
After completing his doctorate at
Washington, he was a postdoctoral
fellow at Newberry College and
later taught at the University of
Utah.
Well-known for his studies on
the American West. Native Amer
icans and the environment, he re
ceived a Mac Arthur Foundation
"genius grant" in 1995.

'In terms of the areas that
he specializes in, he will fill
a big gap in the History
Department.'
— Nan Bentley

His book on the Columbia
River, "The Organic Machine,"
won the Governor's Award in
19%, and his 1991 text, "The Mid
dle Ground," earned several
awards, among them the Albert
Cory Prize and the Raleigh Prize.
His new book on his mother's his
tory as an Irish immigrant will soon
be released.
As a Margaret Byrne Professor
of American History at Stanford,
White said he will likely create
courses and programs around the
American West. He plans to ex
pand studies on environmental and
Native American history, which

are currently not extensive at Stan
lord.
"Everyone is very happy that
he's coming," said Nan Bentley,
administrator of the History De
partment. "In terms of the areas
that he specializes in.he will fill a
hig gap in the History Depart
ment."
White's growing concern over
the quality of public education
prompted him to put himself on the
job market. Although these are
prosperous times for the state of
Washington, White says, funding
for education has increased mini
mally due to a lack of popular sup
port for public schools.
As a result, White explained, he
and many of his colleagues engage
in "industrial teaching," teaching
large numbers of students live days
a week without much personal in
teraction.
"Part of me says to stay and
fight, but I finally realized that I
have to go and move on," White
said.
"My staying or going won't
change anything. There are struc
tural problems that exist within the
whole system, and an individual
professor can't do much."
White said salary was not a con
sideration in his decision. "1 have
been at [Washington] for a long
time. I'm established here," he
said. "There would have been no
reason for me to leave and certain
ly not monetary ones. It's basically
a disillusionment with how things
have been going."
Prof. Robert Stacev. head of
Washington's History Depart
ment. agreed with White, with
whom he has worked since 1990.
"Most of us who teach at schools
like [Washington] made positive

decisions to come here and teach
'in the trenches,' " Stacey said, "I
left Yale to do so; I have colleagues
who left Texas, Berkeley, Colum
bia and Stanford. Believe me, it
isn't for the money. Nor did money
have anything to do with Richard's
decision. Among the admirable
things about Richard is the fact
that he has never allowed money to
make his decisions for him."

All of us are extremely
disappointed to lose him
to Stanford.'
— Robert Stacey

White's students and colleagues
at Washington are naturally upset
to see him leave.
"All of us are extremely disap
pointed to lose him to Stanford,"
Stacey said. "Hut this disappoint
ment does not mean that we are
disappointed in Richard.... His
decision to teach elsewhere takes
nothing away from his contribu
tions to us over the past eight
years."
White says that he will miss the
University of Washington and
Seattle immensely.
"1 love the city of Seattle and the
university," he said. "Of course, I
look forward to a place like Stan
ford. where mostly everyone is a
good student. It is, in a sense, a re
lief to teach very good students.
"But the one thing I'll miss
about [Washington], which I might
not find as often at Stanford, is
teaching those students who
weren't necessarily the best in high
school, but who maybe found
themselves at [college]."
