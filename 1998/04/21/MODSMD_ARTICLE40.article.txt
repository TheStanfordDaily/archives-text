## Norton, Spence debate the issues 
### Saurabh Prakash Editorial staff 
As the ASSIJ Spring General
Election presidential runoff ap
proaches, the competition for votes

has heightened.
Last night, the
two remaining
candidates,
Maren Norton
and Matt Spence,
squared off in a
civil, issues-ori
ented debate
broadcast live on
KZSU. Students

can vote in the runoff on the World
Wide Web site http://election.stan
ford.edu. The ASSIJ Senate will
decide tonight when, exactly, the
runoff will be held.
The two candidates were asked
to respond to several questions by
moderator Tom Soule, and then
had the opportunity to ask each
other one question. The debate
touched on topics ranging from
Norton's proposal to assign senate
seats to 4(X)-person constituencies
to Spence's vow to resign if his cam
paign goals are not met.
Both candidates concurred that
past ASSIJ governments talked
more than they acted.
The guiding principle for next
year's ASSL J. they agreed, has to be
change.
"Everyone comes into the
ASSIJ with a desire to make things
happen ... but things get delayed."
Spence said.
Norton proposed to improve the
student government's responsive
ness to student needs and concerns

by holding senators responsible.
This year's senate, Norton said, was
plagued by inertia and poor atten
dance. Senators didn't answer to
students, and students did not know
their senators.
Norton promised to enact legis
lation that would give each senate

seat a constituency
"Right now,
senators aren't re
sponsible to any
one." Norton
said. "They will
now have 400
people they have
to answer to."
Such a change,
Norton argued.

would enable students to know who
to put pressure on and would force
senators to respond to student con
cerns.
Spence said the ASSLJ president
must not shoot too high.
"If we come up with realistic
goals and start on time ... the Uni
versity will take us seriously,"
Spence said.
Spence's goals include keeping
Tresidder Union open longer and
ensuring that it provides more ser
vices to students, as well as an ex
panded course guide.
Spence said he has spoken with
students, administration and even
trustees about the feasibility of his
proposals and received positive
feedback.
"The single biggest problem
with the ASSU ... is that the
promises are made but are not
kept," Spence said. "We want to
give you real change, which is ac
tion more than talk."
