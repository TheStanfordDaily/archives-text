Ever thought a weekend trip to Los Angeles with 25 dormmates would land

you a spot as a contestant on one of the na
tion's most popular game shows?
That's what happened to freshman Ben
Arden last Monday when he went on Tovon
Hall's trip to see "The Price is Right." a game
show where contestants plav various games
to guess the prices of items to win them.
According to Arden. the whole weekend
itself unfolded largely by chance.
"I heard about the trip to L A. and
thought it would be a good chance to see m>
girlfriend. Debbie, who goes to l CI A 1
didn't even think I'd go to the taping "
After visiting his girlfriend. Arden decid
ed to attend the show's taping, but he first un
derwent a two-minute interview required of
all potential contestants, allowing him to
make a mark on the producers.
"1 was waiting in line for my interview. and
1 saw them talking to [sophomore Sean
Collins). They asked him if he had any special
studies, and Sean answered math. So imme
diately I thought to myself. I'd better have
something to say."
"When it was my turn," Arden explained.
"I told them. I'm Ben from L.A.. and I'm
studying comparative prices throughout the
ages.' "

Not surprisingly, that off-

the-wall statement made an im
pression with one of the show "s pro-

ducers and prompted him to respond.
"So you brought the nut ease with \ou
to the Tovon group.

On the day of the taping. Ben's name \Na*. called
from the audience as one of the contestants

"We were a little bit shocked at first when it hap
pened. but we just went craz\ and got out ot our

seats and started jumping all around." Collins said
Arden's wit continued w hen he got to the stage
amd talked during the personal introduction

phase.
"When (game show host) Bob Barker said.
We've had a lot of teams come here from Stan
ford. Are you another one of them?' 1 said

we were from the spanking team, and he replied.' I his
is a sick kid.' "
On the contestant's row. Arden placed his first "bid"
on a china tea set. In this portion, the contestants try to
guess the retail value of an item without going over.
The actual price of the china turned out to be and
he bid the highest — by $1 — of the contestants.
Having won the china. Ben then moved on to a game

where he had to guess the price of a new car. a red tour

door Mercury Tracer. However, this time he wasn't us lucks — he overbid on the
value and lost the car
"I think all of us were ecstatic when Hen won the china and were rooting for
him when he was ooine for the car." said freshman Zach Mont/. "Too bad he


didn't make it."
Because of the way the game is
structured, Arden still had a
chance to reach the finals and win
more prizes. At this point, he had
to spin the "Big Wheel." which is
labeled with different values up to
$1. The objective is to get closest to
$1 without going over in two spins
or less.
"I was up there, and I remem
bered that we had made a pledge
that whoever was lip there would
spank the wheel," Arden said. "So
1 spun the wheel the first time and
it landed on 35 cents. Then I spun
it. a second time giving it a little
spank, but this time it landed on 85
cents."
To this Barker reacted humor
ously and said, "Poor Benjamin,
he's going to have to go back to
Stanford and tell everyone he
flunked 'The Price is Right.' "
Arden, however, managed to
keep his good humor about the
show, which will air April 29 on
CBS.
"I had a great time and it was
fun while it lasted, so that's what
counts."
"Besides, it's only a car," he
added.
