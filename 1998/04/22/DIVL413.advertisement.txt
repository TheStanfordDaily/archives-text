'Honoring Lives,
Remembering Losses:
A OvCemoriaC Qatfiering"
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 5 PM
Round Room (behind Memorial Church)
*
This is an occasion for anyone at Stanford to attend, to
honor the lives of those we know who have died, either
recently or sometime in the past; to take the opportunity
to ritually say good-bye and commend a loved one to
something beyond this life; to gather together with people
we know to remember and reflect on the themes of life
and death. This Interfaith gathering will include beautiful
music, meditative silence, readings from different faith
traditions about the life passage of death; the opportunity
to speak the names of those we have lost and to light a
candle in memory of them, and more. In addition to
personal losses, and remembering lives lost to AIDS, we
will also highlight this day of Yom HaShoah, com
memorating the lives lost during the Holocaust.
