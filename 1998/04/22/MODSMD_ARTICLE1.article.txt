The runoff election for the ASSI)
presidency will be held next Wednesday
and Thursday. However, a much-debat
ed constitutional amendment intended
to improve senator accountability will
not appear on the runoff ballot as
planned.
Last night, the ASSU Senate ap
proved the runoff between the top two
candidates in last week's general elec
tion. junior Maren Norton and sopho
more Matt Spence. Elections Commis
sioner Dan Perkel announced that the
runoff will be held April and 30.
The scheduled election dates will nar-

rowly adhere to the
ASSU Constitution,
which states that the
runoff election must
take place within 14
days of the general
election.
Perkel also

announced that cam
paigning for the runoff will officially
begin this Sunday at midnight and last
for two days.
The proposed amendment, titled
"Common Sense Senate Reform to
Ensure Equitable Representation."
would have moved the election of sena
tors to the fall.
The bill would have set up 15 voting

districts organized around residences.
Each district would elect one senator
who would, ideally, be a direct voice lor
the members of his or her constituent.
After much debate over the implica
tions of the changes, however, the sen
ate voted against the bill that would
have placed the amendment on the
runoff ballot.
The failed amendment also needed to
be voted on last night in order to main
tain constitutionality.
The constitution states that an
amendment must be posted in a public
place at least seven days before it goes to
vote.
The constitution does not require the
:irm>nilrm>nt In he nl:ir<-<l i »n tin* rnmitt

ballot. I he senate also has the option ol
calling a separate election focused only
on the amendment.
However. Senate Chair Joe Freund
explained. "In the interest of saving
mone\ and maximizing voter turnout,
the general election [the vote on the
amendment] and the runoff should be
held at the same time."
Most of the debate on the amend
ment bill centered around the logistics
of mo\ ing the election from the spring to
the fall.
Although the senate election would
be moved, the vote for ASSI president
and special fees would still be held in the

spring.
Many senators were concerned
ab°out the added costs of running
two elections.
This year's election cost roughly
$23,000, Perkel said.
Former Senate Chair Alane
Murdock, a medical student, point
ed out that the largest number of
students are absent from campus
during fall quarter.
Senators questioned whether
freshmen were familiar enough
with the University during their
first year at Stanford to be compe
tent and knowledgeable senators.
ASSU Vice President Ben
Decker, one of the bill's authors,
pleaded for the bill passage.
"What we have right now," he

said, referring to the current sen
ate. "is not working, and this
[amendment] could solve some of
our problems."
In the end. the hill failed sound
ly. with few votes in its favor hut

'What we have now is not
working, and this
[amendment] could solve
some of our problems'
— Ben Decker

some abstentions.
A separate senate reform bill
which will not affect the constitu
tion — was passed last night. The
bill was similar in intent to the
amendment but keeps the senator
elections in the spring.
The bill calls for the Office of

the ASSU President to establish a
Senator District Committee that
will divide the campus by resi
dences into 15 districts. l his dis
tricting will take place after the re
sults of the spring housing Draw
are announced.
In accordance with the bill, each
undergraduate senator will repre
sent a specific residential district
next year.
The successful reform does not
have to be voted on in a general
election because it does not change
the constitution's election guide
lines.
A final bill that was debated and
passed last night called for the cre
ation of the ASSU Alliance to Con
trol Tuition.
The group will investigate the
causes of tuition increases and seek
to find ways to lower the rate of in
crease.
