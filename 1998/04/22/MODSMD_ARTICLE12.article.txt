WASHINGTON (AP)
Three federal appeals judges,
asked to consider procedural ques
tions in the Justice Department's
light against Microsoft, instead
went to the heart of the debate: Is
the company illegally trying to
dominate its competitors?
Microsoft is appealing a judge's
Dec. I I preliminary injunction
that prohibited it from forcing
computer makers who sell Win
dows 95 to also offer Microsoft's
Internet browser. The company
claims the browser is bundled so
tightly within its dominant Win
dows operating system that Inter
net Explorer isn't actually a sepa
rate product.
U.S. Circuit Judge Patricia M.
Wald questioned yesterday how
that injunction was granted.

Windows market-muscle to loist
its browser on customers unfairly,
illegally squee/ing other compa

Government attorneys sa\ "tying"

of Internet Explorer is anti-com
petitive and "plain wrong
The court's decision could be
announced in one to three months
1 he sometimes-esoteric debate
is important because Microsoft
may. under a 1995 agreement with
the Justice Department, develop
integrated products for its Win
dows operating system, used on
the vast majority of desktop com
puters.
Microsoft's Internet Explorer is
second in popularity onl\ to

Netscape ( ommunication Corp.'s
browser.
In a broader sense, the light
over browsers is vital t«» Microsoft
because of the Internet's explosive
popularity and the possibility that
Internet browsers eventually could
replace Windows as software
operating systems.
"What is all comes down to in
the end is. what is an integrated
product. Wald said, and much of
the hearing was spent trying to
answer that question.
I he Justice Department argued
that Microsoft's current Internet
browser is a stand alone product,
in part because it had been mar
keted simultaneously alongside

original Internet I xplorer wasn't
included in the earliest Windows
95 because of technical delays
