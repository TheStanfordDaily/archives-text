# Astronomers offer clearest evidence of worlds beyond solar system
## New family of planets observed 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Signs of a
new family of planets orbiting a distant
star are the clearest evidence yet of
worlds forming beyond our solar system
and suggest that planets where life could
evolve may exist throughout the universe,
astronomers say.
Using powerful new instruments on
telescopes in Hawaii and Chile, two teams
of astronomers independently found a
doughnut-shaped disk of dust rotating
around a star 220 light-years away. A
light-year is about 5.9 trillion miles.
They said at a news conference yester
day that the hole in the doughnut may
have been caused by the birth of planets.
"A solar system like our own is being

constructed in the middle of this disk."
said David Corner of the University of
Pennsylvania. He is a member of an
astronomy team that used the Neck 11
telescope in Hawaii to study the star.
He said the finding, along with similar
discoveries reported this week in the jour
nal Nature, suggests that planets may be
very common throughout the universe.
"Perhaps there are lots of places for
life to exist." he said.
Another astronomy team, using the
Sarah Tololo Observatory in Chile, made
a confirming observation.
Both teams focused on a star called
HR 47% that earlier studies had suggest
ed could be at the center of what is called

a protoplanetary disk.
"These disks are thought to he the
birthing rooms of planets," said NASA
astronomer Edward Weiler. head of a
space agency program that is searching
for evidence of extrasolar planets and life.
"We haven't actually detected any
planets." said Lee Hartmann of the Har
vard-Smithsonian Center for Astro
physics and a member of the Cerro Tolo
lo team.
Hut he said the most likely explanation
for the absence of dust in the hole of the
disk is that planets have formed.
A group of researchers are publishing
similar results from their study of three
other stars in this week's journal Nature.
