New transfer credit policy
supports belief that campus
experience adds degree value

THE REVISIONS TO transfer
credit policy approved by the
Faculty Senate last Thursday
should make transfering credits from
other institutions a bit easier. But the
revisions also ensure that a Stanford
diploma means that at minimum, half
of a student's coursework was com
pleted at Stanford. The changes sup
port the belief that the value of Stan
ford lies in one's educational experi
ence.
The major change suggested by the
Committee for Academic Appraisal
and Achievement was a requirement
that students must take at least 90
units at Stanford to graduate. Previ
ously, a student could earn a Stanford
diploma with as few as 45 of the total
units — the equivalent of one year —
coming from Stanford coursework.
Unit-counting may seem petty. But
a degree should mean that a student
has absorbed something from the
Stanford environment. Whether this
is academic knowledge, social growth
or an expanded perspective on the
world is up to each individual: no two
people react the same way to what
they find here.
But one year is not enough time to
process the Stanford experience.
Recognizing this does not glorify
the wonders and mysteries of Resi
dential Education and Spanish Mis

sion-style architecture. But it does
acknowledge that finding yourself
thrown in amid a mix of people and a
maze of academic choices can lead
you to draw conclusions about what
you want from life. That's part of a
degree as much as Stanford's rigorous
academic reputation.
The transfer credit change also
indicates that the University is com
mitted to graduating only students
who have been trained on a level con
comitant to this institution's academic
standards.
In fact, most comparable schools
already have a two-year minimum
residency requirement.
While this change is aimed at
adding value to a Stanford degree,
other revisions allow more room for
credit from other institutions.
For instance, students who take
classes without a direct equivalent at
Stanford may now get up to 20 units
of credit for those classes. And com
munity college credits now count as
much as four-year college credits,
meaning that there is no longer a stig
ma associated with community col
lege credits.
Moreover, the recent changes
enable students who take exchange
quarters at other institutions to get
credit for classes that are offered at
those institutions but not at Stanford.
This is a positive step as it rewards
students' intellectual curiosity.
We commend the changes to trans
fer credit policy for adding flexibility
while simultaneously supporting the
idea that a Stanford degree ought not
be given lightly.
