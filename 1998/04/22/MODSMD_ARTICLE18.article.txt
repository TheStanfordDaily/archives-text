## Seven ways to escape Draw hell 
### 
THE DRAW IS the
time of year when
you decide to bide
the next year of your life
in Wilbur Hall. Stern Hall
or Sterling Quad with ran
dom people from your
current dorm, while your

best friends unanimously
score spots in Storey. Xanadu and Kimball.
It makes you feel like Bill Buckner, but
what can you do?
This year there are a plethora of new fac
tors in the Draw. But fear not. Since we
don't live in a Boolean world, there are
plenty of ways to escape "Draw hell." Let's
take a look at some of the more innovative
options:
Drawing solo — Be brave, it'll be like
freshman year all over again. Mmmmm ...
CIV!
The Gang Draw — Or "house flooding."
not to be confused with a certain '70s
movie. You take an obscure dorm/Row
house with a perennially low Draw record
and draw in with 20 friends by all putting it
down as your first choice. Then you can
dominate the house anil watch Barney
while baked. It works even better if you all
have the same last name.
Go Latin — Start your own fraternity,
sorority, or even a coed frorority — like
CCCLVII Mavficld. You can even invite
Dan Quayle over to practice his Latin over
a baked potatoe.
Lambda Nit — Wanna go on a trip? No
EANABS here — none at all! Mmmm ...

Scooby Snacks!
Dorm nicknanws — Everyone knows
that Rinconada is "Drink-a-lotta" and
Faisan is "Hook-up Heaven." But only a
select few know that ATO and Synergy
stand for "Atomic Potato" and "Sexual
Energy," respectively.
Theme dorms — My personal favorite is
next year's reincarnation of this year's
Naranja. Although it won't be the Tropi
cana Orange theme dorm, it will serve as an
excellent social commentary on the state of
our world, university and times as the brand
spanking new "entrepreneurial spirit"
theme dorm.
What a great idea! I imagine everyone
will have a beeper, a cell phone, plenty of
business cards and slick suits, not to men
tion slick hair. I'm just a little concerned
that students on the rest of campus might
lose their jobs when they start exploiting
low-wage prospective freshmen and then
move their businesses to developing coun
tries for even cheaper labor.
I'm also looking forward to student-initi
ated theme dorms such as the Weenie
Roast theme dorm, the pear cider theme
dorm, and the eunuch theme dorm. Enjoy
the theme dorms while they last, before The
Man cracks down and forces us to live in
corporate-sponsored dorms. Sayonara
Arroyo. Cedro and Trancos... aloha Coca-
Cola®, Microsoft®, and Exxon®, (iod
bless America!
Drawing with significant others — Not
recommended. Just ask Jim.
Once you figure out what places you can

Should the federal government fund
needle exchange programs?
Apparently not, according to the Clin
ton administration. On Monday, Secretary
of Health and Human Services Donna
Shalala announced that the administration
would not lift a 9-year-old ban on using
federal money to support programs that
give clean needles to drug users.
The decision came on the heels of a
February announcement that needle
exchange programs reduce the spread of
AIDS and more recent evidence that
proves the programs do not promote drug
use. For these reasons, the administra
tion's decision has been criticized as a
refusal to commit to reducing the spread
of AIDS.
Although the announcement has no
practical effect, it still came as a surprise.
According to The New York Times, the
decision was handed down after a week of
negotiations between Shalala and the
White House. Shalala had been pressing
to rescind the ban with some restrictions.
Public health experts and advocates for
people afflicted with AIDS had been told

sec yourself living in. it's really important to
set up your Draw card in the right order. St)
there arc a feu more factors you have to
weigh.
For instance, if you're drawing unpre
fcrrcd. there's always the classic dilemma;
which is really closer to C'ERAS — Sterling
Quad or San Francisco? What about dorm
sports — are the hallways wide enough for
tackle ultimate frisbee? Also consider the
distance from off-campus hangouts. My
friend Rick loves living in ATO because, as
he puts it, "Taco Bell is closer than Sweet
Hall."
Plus there are factors like avoiding the
"Walk of Shame" or promoting the "Walk
of Glory," depending on your view.
Although, if you're an upperclassman, this
is less of a concern. It seems that the fresh
man "Walk of Shame" transforms into the
sophomore year "Bike Ride of Shame." It
has even more obscure mutations when you
go abroad, such as the "U-Bahn of Shame"
or some sort of "Public Transportation of
Shame," until senior year when it simply
matures into the "Drive of Shame."
But seriously prospective freshmen, it's
not that bad. After all. it's not like you're
returning from overseas; you actually will
get housing. In fact, we at Stanford have lit
tle to complain about unless we end up
drawing into Otero — now that would total
ly suck!

Devin Joshi, a senior majoring in history,
sends a phat WORD TO YOUR MUTHA
to the crew of "The Room": Adelfa 116.

in the last few days that the b;in was about
to be lifted.
Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the director of
national drug policy also known as the
"drug czar," was one of those opposed to
lifting the ban. His main reason was that
government funding of needle exchange
programs sends children the message that
it's alright to use drugs.
Most of the hundred or so needle
exchange programs currently operating do
so on a small budget of private and local
lunds. Needle exchange is still illegal in
man / states, and supporters hoped that
federal money would have made these
programs more acceptable to legislators
and the public.
What do you think? Did the Clinton
administration make the right choice?
What kinds of messages will the decision
send to Americans and citizens in other
nations?
E-mail us your opinions by Monday at
letters@daily.stanford.edu, and we'll print
them next Wednesday. You can also drop
written responses off at The Daily.



What do you think
of the Clinton
administration's
decision not to fed

exchange programs?
