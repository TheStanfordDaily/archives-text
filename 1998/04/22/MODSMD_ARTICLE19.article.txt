# From the fourth dimension
## Kerry Rodgers Braids, beehives and breaking the mold

LEGEND HAS IT that when I was
horn. I was entirely bald, and I stayed
that way for the next couple of years.
In an effort to clarify my gender identity to
all the strangers who thought I was her son.
my mom used to tape pink hows on my hair
less little head. Unfortunately, the masses
simply responded by exclaiming what a
funny-looking boy I was.
Then, in my third year my hair started
sprouting with a vengeance and hasn't
stopped since. The big curly powder puff on
my head gave rise to a number of mortifying
childhood identities. To my brother I was
"Medusa"; his best friend preferred "Bee
hive." My drama teacher took one look and
cast me as Curly in "Peter Pan." From then
on. whenever anyone forgot my name I was
referred to as "that kid with all the hair."
I hated this identification and prayed for
long straight blond hair. Yet somewhere
along the line jealousy gave way to self
acceptance.
Now I just become periodically pos
sessed with an insatiable urge to chop it all
off. In ninth grade I gave into that urge. Bad

idea — I looked like a pompom on a
broomstick until 11th grade. So I've found
other ways to deal.
My favorite coping mechanism is to get
braids. It reduces the volume of my hair by
90 percent and increases the manageability
by a power of two. Plus it allows my head
some exposure to fresh spring air. So last
week I called up a talented friend who
expertly twisted and plaited my locks for
live and a half hours into 93, count 'em. 93
braids.
This is the sixth time I've undertaken this
endeavor, so I knew what to expect.
I'll answer the most common questions: I
keep them in for about a month. Yes, I can
wash them, and no. I didn't go to Jamaica
over spring break.
But getting braids is different than get
ting a tint, a perm or a trim. People read hair
as a political statement or expression of
affiliation. Alternative hair connotes a
rejection of the mainstream and a stylistic
allegiance with funkiness. When my hair is
in braids I tend to get nods of approval from
artsy types and expressions of shock from

young Republicans.
My friend and I discussed another aspect
of braids as she worked on my head. She
noted that some African Americans per
ceive hairstyle as an index of political iden
tity. Straightened hair can be a superficial
indicator for conformity to white beauty
standards, and natural hair, dreadlocks or
braids can express an Afrocentric ideal.
When I started wearing braids I encoun
tered some other interpretations of my
hairstyle. Some people believed I had mis
appropriated an ethnic hairstyle. Once
when my hair was braided and 1 was walk
ing down South Street in Philadelphia, a
black man summed this up with a loud
rhetorical question: "What's that white girl
doing with black hair?"
And my white, racist grandfather, upon
seeing me with braids, mumbled under his
breath, "You might as well go around paint
ed in blackface."
It is important to me to challenge such
attitudes. But I wear my braids for primari
ly aesthetic reasons, so the attention I get
for them makes me a little uncomfortable.

Eating out at a nice restaurant in a small
Northern coastal town over the weekend. I
could feel my scalp crawl from the guarded
stares I received. I was careful to he on my
best behavior.
The way I'm constantly aware of what
my braids mean to other people reminds me
of a time this summer when I was out at din
ner in my hometown with an African-
American friend. At some point our discus
sion turned to racial issues. He commented,
without lifting his gaze, that there was only
one other black person in the restaurant.
I scanned the place and finally spied a
black man in the far corner of the large
dining room. I was startled how salient this
other man's presence had been to my
friend; he had grown up as the only black
person in his high school and was now liv
ing in a mostly white town. Yet he was still
so conscious of the difference that he kept
a mental tally of racial demographics
every time he entered a public establish
ment.
As he has spent most of his life feeling
different. I have spent mine blending in with

the crowd I grew up in a very racially strat
ified town. The few times that I've been
highly aware of the color of my skin
when traveling in Mexico, for instance, or
when getting my hair hraided at a black hair
salon in Virginia have left notable
impressions.
These moments of difference have
broadened the circle of my experience.
They have also helped me to empathize
with the squelching feeling of sticking out
from the crowd. M\ isolated glimpses ot dis
comfort. however are featherweight in
comparison to the heavy burden of perpet
ual racial discrimu ion.
But my expend < e gives me empathy for
those who stand < it like sore thumbs in
classrooms, restain its and board rooms,
and this has rem dmy commitment to
diversity Ihe e< one's skin should not
be a reason to fe . squieted in the public
sphere. For tli i ou should have to do
