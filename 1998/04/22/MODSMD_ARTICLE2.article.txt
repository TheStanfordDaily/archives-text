# Lack of diversity
## Report: Black faculty underrepresented in physics and engineering departments 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
Blacks arc grossly underrepre
sented on the faculties of the nation's
top physics departments and engi
neering schools — including Stan
ford's reports the most recent issue
of Fhe Journal of Blacks in Higher
Education.
Although blacks make up about
12 percent of the U.S. population,
they make up only 3 percent of Stan
ford's Physics Department faculty
and only 1 .4 percent of faculty in the
School ol I Engineering.
"We are not resting on the as
sumption that nothing can be done by
it university. s;»kJ Vice Provost for
Faculty Affairs and Law Prof. Robert
Weisberg. "We've certainly engaged
in a mixture of encouragement and
pushing for all departments to in
crease the possibility of more diverse
hiring.
"If |a faculty candidate] becomes
available we push pretty hard to get
her or him." Weisberg said "And
when a department is looking to fill a
spot, we and the department push to
define the search to increase the pos
sibility (>1 bringing in a minority."
The top 25 physics departments in
the nation, as determined by U.S.
News and World Report, have a total

of 1.224 faculty members. Seven, or
0.6 percent, arc black.
Seven of the 25 physics depart
ments listed in the journal, including
Stanford, have only one black faculty
member. The remaining IS depart
ments have no black faculty mem
bers.
At the nation's top 25 schools of
engineering with a total of 4.839 fac
ulty members, only 1.5 percent are
black. Twelve of the 25 schools had
either no black faculty members or
only one black person on faculty.
I he usual explanation for the low
number of black faculty members at
the nation's leading universities is
that there are "no blacks in the acad
emic pipeline." the journal said.
Without black students graduat
ing" with doctorates, universities do
not have a p »ol of qualified candi
dates from which to draw faculty
members.
"There's no question that the pool
is least diverse in the natural sciences
and engineering." Weisberg said.
According to the journal, in 19%.
only 15 of the 1,097d0ct orates award
ed in physics and astronomy went to
blacks. In 19%. only 74 blacks re
ceived doctorates in engineering,
amounting to 1.2 percent of the 6.305
engineering doctorates awarded that
year.
Weisberg pointed out that these
numbers do not distinguish between
doctorate recipients who are interest
ed in teaching and those who are in
terested in private industrial research.
Stanford "actually has a very good
record of training black Ph. D.'sin
physics," said Physics and Astro
physics Prof. Arthur B.C. Walker Jr.,
Stanford's sole black physics profes
sor. "Overall we've trained 40 minor
ity Ph.D. students in physics, and this
is more than any other institution."
Walker also noted that there are
numerous activities designed "to at
tract undergraduates who might be
interested in a career in physics."
One such event is the National
Conference of Black Physics Stu
dents. which attracts a lew hundred
students each year. According to
Walker, the conference may be held
at Stanford in two years.
But Weisberg said that a difficulty
in bringing undergraduates into doc
toral degree programs is the attrac
tion of professional programs in busi
ness. law and medicine, as well as ca
reers in management consulting and
investment banking.
He noted that professional schools

have relatively better numbers on di
versity than doctoral programs.
"If we could forbid our undergrad
uates from going to professional
schools we could improve the situa
tion tremendously," Weisberg said.
Some of the brightest undergradu
ates. Weisberg said, "are in law firms
or investment banks or management
consulting and not likely to be re
trieved once they go there."
Walker questioned the pipeline
explanation for the lack of black fac
ulty in light of the successful recruit
ment efforts made by graduate
physics programs.
"Some of the universities that
claim they cannot find suitable facul
ty candidates probably haven't
looked hard enough," he said.
"Although there has always been
controversy about whether there is a
(candidate] pool problem or an effort
problem [by universities], there cer
tainly is a greater pool pn tblem in cer
tain areas than others," Weisberg
said. "The pool numbers are most de
pressingly low in physics and equally
so in the sciences generally."
Walker commented that minority
faculty members are important as
mentors for minority students.
"It helps to feel that the faculty is
diverse enough to incorporate people
like yourself, when you're looking at
carrying out a graduate research pro
gram," Walker said.
