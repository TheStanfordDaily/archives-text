# Lack of diversity
## Report: Black faculty underrepresented in physics and engineering departments 
### Ann Kim Staff writer 
Blacks arc grossly underrepre
sented on the faculties of the nation's
top physics departments and engi
neering schools — including Stan
ford's reports the most recent issue
of Fhe Journal of Blacks in Higher
Education.
Although blacks make up about
12 percent of the U.S. population,
they make up only 3 percent of Stan
ford's Physics Department faculty
and only 1 .4 percent of faculty in the
School ol I Engineering.
"We are not resting on the as
sumption that nothing can be done by
it university. s;»kJ Vice Provost for
Faculty Affairs and Law Prof. Robert
Weisberg. "We've certainly engaged
in a mixture of encouragement and
pushing for all departments to in
crease the possibility of more diverse
hiring.
"If |a faculty candidate] becomes
available we push pretty hard to get
her or him." Weisberg said "And
when a department is looking to fill a
spot, we and the department push to
define the search to increase the pos
sibility (>1 bringing in a minority."
The top 25 physics departments in
the nation, as determined by U.S.
News and World Report, have a total

of 1.224 faculty members. Seven, or
0.6 percent, arc black.
Seven of the 25 physics depart
ments listed in the journal, including
Stanford, have only one black faculty
member. The remaining IS depart
ments have no black faculty mem
bers.
At the nation's top 25 schools of
engineering with a total of 4.839 fac
ulty members, only 1.5 percent are
black. Twelve of the 25 schools had
either no black faculty members or
only one black person on faculty.
I he usual explanation for the low
number of black faculty members at
the nation's leading universities is
that there are "no blacks in the acad
emic pipeline." the journal said.
Without black students graduat
ing" with doctorates, universities do
not have a p »ol of qualified candi
dates from which to draw faculty
members.
"There's no question that the pool
is least diverse in the natural sciences
and engineering." Weisberg said.
According to the journal, in 19%.
only 15 of the 1,097d0ct orates award
ed in physics and astronomy went to
blacks. In 19%. only 74 blacks re
ceived doctorates in engineering,
amounting to 1.2 percent of the 6.305
