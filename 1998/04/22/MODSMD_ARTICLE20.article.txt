Dear readers,
I have received several phone calls in the
past few weeks inquiring about upcoming
studies on angiogenesis, the growing of new
blood vessels for people with vascular disease.
Due to the success of previous trials, research
on this subject has gotten overwhelming pub
licity in various nationally distributed periodi
cals.
Stanford is currently conducting angiogen
esis trials for peripheral arterial disease and
coronary arterial disease. Crudely speaking,
the procedure involves "growing your own
bypass."
The process begins with an infusion of
angiogenesis drugs via a catheter. These drugs
are usually analogs of normal human protein
growth factors. The amount of the drug
administered and specifics such as time and
duration of administration, are protocol spe
cific for each trial. The infusions usually last a
few hours, and there are typically a few fol
low-up visits at regular intervals after the ini
tial infusion.
Although each angiogenesis trial is differ
ent, the trials are usually fully funded by the
sponsoring pharmaceutical company. Conse
quently. the only costs to the patient is his or
her time and effort.
There is a catch, however. Those patients
who have had a previous history of cancer are
usually dropped from the screening process.
The reason for this is that, although the angio
genesis drug(s) stimulate the growth of new
blood vessels in the places patients most need
it, blood vessel growth is also stimulated in
other areas in the body.
If a potential patient has an unknown latent
cancer or pre-caneerous growth somewhere in
his or her body, the angiogenesis drug could
also stimulate the growth of new blood vessels
to help "feed" this cancer. The problem is that
what was once an unknown group of dormant
cells could turn into something requiring
immediate attention.
These new trials are very exciting and could
become new therapies for those people who
are not good surgical candidates or simply
don't want surgery to treat their cardiac prob
lems. For more information, you can contact
me at 5-4182 or e-mail me at
tdecotis@leland.stanford.edu. We are cur
rently recruiting patients for these trials.
