# Earthships offer sustainable living
## 
### Emma Brown Ann Iwashita 
Earth Day is here, and again we renew
our vows to reduce, reuse, recycle, to ride
bikes rather than use the car, to do the lit
tle things that we hope make a difference
on a global scale.
This Earth Day, we have the opportu
nity to learn from Michael Reynolds, who
will be speaking tonight at X p.m. in Cub
berley Auditorium. Reynolds will be talk
ing about amazing homes that can help
make a global difference. These
dwellings, called Earthships, are energy
efficient. environmentally friendly hous
es.
Supplied with modern conveniences
like Hush toilets, microwaves and ade
quate power for laundry machines and
television sets, they accommodate the
needs and wants of anyone and everyone
without harming the earth.
The Earthship concept was conceived
in 1973 by architect Reynolds, who was
interested in building ecologically sound
and sustainable housing suitable for peo
ple of any income bracket. The basic
building blocks of an Earthship are old
tires which would otherwise end up in a
landfill. Dirt is pounded into the tires
until they are full and weigh a hefty and
stable 350 pounds. I lie tires, which make
up the outer wall of the structure, are
laid out in a U-shape and stacked like
bricks.
A mixture of dirt, sand, straw and
water is used to fill in the spaces between
the tires. Cans and bottles are rammed
into this mixture, called adobe. After the
adobe dries, another layer is added. In all.
there are usually six layers of adobe. The
last one consists of finely sifted dirt that
leaves a smooth finish.
Exterior walls are constructed with
tires, mud and cans. Interior walls are
made of adobe, reinforced with cans to
lend strength and structure. The front
wall.' - which is always south-facing, is
entirely windows. Depending on the lati
tude. the windows are slanted at different
angles.
The slant helps regulate temperature
as the seasons change. In the winter,
when the sun is low, the sunlight reaches
to the back of the Earthship and its heat is
stored by the tire walls. At night, the tires
radiate the heat back into the Earthship.
In the summer, however, the sun is high
er in the skv and therefore shines on a

smaller area of the interior of the house.
This phenomenon, along with the fact
that the Earthship is sunk into the ground
a factor which enables it to maintain a
constant temperature of 65 degrees
makes heating and cooling systems

unnecessary. I he homes remain com
fortable even in Taos. N.M.'s desert sum
mers and harsh winters.
There is no need for the Earthship to
be connected to a municipal water source
it provides its own water. Rain and
snow are caught on the roof and tunneled
into a cistern for storage. As long as the
Earthship receives at least N inches of pre
cipitation per year, there will be plenty of
water. Any area that receives less than 20
inches of rain per year is considered a
desert; there are few places that don't get
enough water for an Earthship.
One reason that the Earthship needs
so little water to be viable is that it recy
cles water four to six times. Water in the
cistern is first filtered so it is appropriate
for drinking. Any water that goes down

the sink or shower drains is either used in
the Hush toilet or is tunneled to the indoor
planters to quench the thirst of the plants
in private greenhouse.
Water Hushed from the toilet goes to
the "blackwater" system. There, a solar-

powered septic tank and a succession ot
plants remove impurities from the water.
In this way. no waste water leeches into
the surrounding environment, and no
extra water is needed for the plants
around the house.
Solar panels, or in some cases wind
mills. provide the electricity to power the
pumps, filters, lights and other appliances.
Because there is no need for heating or
cooling, there is plenty of electricity avail
able to power any modern convenience.
The cost of these amazing advances in
sustainable living should be astronomical,
but they are not. After all. it is a house
constructed primarily of trash and mud.
Earthship owners who choose to hire
Revnolds or an\ other construction com-

pany to build their homes can expect a
price comparable to that of a convention
al house. Most ol that cost is labor, how
ever. so owners who choose to build
themselves can do so for much less than
one would expect.
According to Reynold's company.
Solar Survival Architecture, the major
ity of Earthship owners build their
homes themselves. Building out-of
pocket means there is no 30-vear mort
gage to force you to stay put and work;
it would be possible to take off for
months or years and not have to worry
I about paying for either loans or utilities.
' Earthship dwellers generally have more
time outside of work to spend time with
themselves and their friends; they have
more time to create art or knit a
' sweater or play basketball. The pace of
life is slow enough that they have time
| to appreciate their lives rather than
, work endlessly.
Some people choose to hire Solar Sur
vival to build their homes In this case,
the house is finished in a matter of
months. Owners can choose to have the
whole thing built, or just the outside
shell, or everything except the final dec
orations. Those who take this latter
route are generally older and more
financially secure.
The vital statistics of the Earthship are
encouraging, but its environmental sus
tainability and low cost are less relevant
if the house is not a comfortable place
to live. Most people shy away from the
idea of living in a house made of trash
the\ think the\ will be crawling around
in a dark hovel.
F:arthships. however, are an\thing bui
dark and cramped. The front wall of win
dows provides an amazing quantity anci
quality of light. The light, coupled with
the indoor plants, provides a feeling
unequaled in our world of square rooms
and small windows; it helps dissolve the
barrier between outdoors and indoors.
The smooth adobe walls and the L -
shaped rooms contribute a comfortable,
soothing feeling to the house.
Living in an Earthship certainly does
not mean living ascetically For example,
actor Dennis Weaver built a h.(KH)-
square-foot luxury Earthship in Telluride.
Colo. All of us do not have the millions
that his house cost, but it does not take
millions to live comfortably and with
every convenience you need.
