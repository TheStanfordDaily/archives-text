# Transforming trash into topsoil
## 
### Kumar Narayanan Staff writer 
Earth Day is every day lor students involved
in organic gardening. Cooperative houses such
as Columbae and Synergy, as well as the Stan
ford Community Farm all extensively employ
composting — a sustainable way of converting
organic waste into organic fertilizer — in their
organic gardens.
"It's a good way of recycling nutrients that
would otherwise be thrown away." said Syner
gy garden manager Jacqueline Pratt, a sopho
more. "It's a sustainable and efficient way of
turning waste into something useful."
Composting emulates the natural mecha
nism for releasing nutrients and nutriments
fr om dead organic matter and making them
available to the rest of the ecosystem. The nat
ural biota of any environment includes a
diverse array of organisms that drive this pro
cess. Equally important to this natural nutrient
cycle is sunlight, water, access to air and time.
When one of these elements is not present, very
little decay occurs.
For example, in a landfill, the hermetic envi
ronment in the highly compacted landfill layers
halts the process.
These natural mechanisms very effectively
recycle the key nutrients locked up within a
dead life form. The most important compounds
are nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, sulfur, in addition
to iron, phosphorous, calcium and a host of
trace minerals.
Compost piles are. in essence, micro-ecosys
items. Microbes and earthworms convert most
iof the decaying matter into a form usable b\ the
ecosystem. Worms, which are foremost among
the larger composting organisms, are high yield
composters. The favorite composting species is
"Red Wigglers," according to the Sunset Guide
to Organic Gardening.
Seeding of a compost pile with a few earth
worms is often sufficient to create a self sustain
ing population of composting earthworms
Worms also aerate the compost piles, thereby
encouraging microbe activity. For these reasons.

worms arc gathering popularity among garden
ers.
Bacteria and fungi are all first level decom
posers. which means that they are the first to
attack the dead matter. Thc\ also do the bulk ol
the composting by chemically processing detri
tus (decaying organic matter). These organism*
require a robust carbon source, such as grass
leaves or vegetable matter.
Bacteria reproduce very quickly, enabling
the rapid colonization of a compost pile
Because of their vigorous metabolism, compost
is often warm to the touch. The most important
variable in this process is temperature; at differ
ent temperatures, different species of bacteria
become active.
Successful composting hinges on the struc
ture of the compost pile. A balance between
green material, which is rich in nitrogen, and
brown material, which is rich in carbon, is
required. Also essential is moisture, and ;i
method for aeration. Finally, a compost heap
must include organic matter at several stages ol
decay.
At Synergy. fresh waste is placed in the first
of three wooden bins. The raw vegetable matter
is seeded with worms and a layer of bacteria
rich soil. It decays for one week, after which it
is turned over to a second bin. One week later,
it is moved to the final bin and is ready for
transferal to the garden. Residents of Synergy
must turn the compost once ;i week to aerate
the compost.
Pratt, whose family has been composting "a*
far back as 1 can remember," stresses its role ir
successful gardening. "It's immenseh impor
tant." she said. "The soil here is fairly nutneni
poor ... it's better than chemical fertilizer
(because] it leeches the soils ot key nutrients "
Composting has wide potential for applica
Hon in gardening because it can make use o
just about any plant matter. As large scale agri
culture and development interrupt vital nutri
ent cycles, composting will be crucial in restor
ing these elements to the soil.
It is also an example of a sustainable tech
nologv that converts waste into a resource.
