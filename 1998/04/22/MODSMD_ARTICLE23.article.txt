\ new recipe for babies
Due to the recent highly publicized birth of
septuplets in lowa, many women seeking to
become pregnant through invitro fertilization
are worried that they may have multiple births.
However, a new technology developed at Stan
ford could minimize the odds of such multiple
births by extending the time embryos can sur
vive outside the womb.
Though the results are preliminary. Barry
Behr. director of Stanford's Invitro Fertiliza
tion and Assisted Reproductive Technology
Laboratory', stated that the new technology
could be a major advance over current invitro
fertilization, or IVF. techniques.
Standard technique involves nurturing a
large number of embryos in a lab culture for
three days, and then transferring four to six of
these embryos into the mother's uterus. More
than one embryo implants in one-third of
patients undergoing this procedure, leading to
multiple births. Multiple pregnancies often
lead to complications. lea\ing parents with the
difficult decision of continuing a risky pregnan
cy or selectively terminating a number of the
fetuses.
The no* approach involves using a novel
recipe for the nutrient-rich medium in which
the embryos arc initially cultured. Doctors can
grow the embryos in this medium for five days,
instead of three days using standard culture
media. The benefits of this growth extension is
that by day five, the embryo has reached a
developmental milestone called the blastocyst
stage. After this point, doctors can more readi
ly distinguish the most viable embryos. As a
result, fewer embryos need to be implanted
into the uterus to guaiantee success.
The approach seems to be working so far.
"We have done seven patients and all seven are
pregnant." Behr said. "It's a great start."
