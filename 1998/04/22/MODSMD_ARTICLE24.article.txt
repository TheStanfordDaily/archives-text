### John Sullivan Staff writer 
Coming off a disappointing week

ball (29-12. 8-8 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) looks to bounce back today at
Pacific (20-16.13-7 Big West Confer
ence ).

Last weekend, Stanford managed
a split against Arizona State, but
dropped two games to the defending
national champion and top-ranked
Arizona Wildcats. Stanford hatters
were unusually cold at the plate, dri

ving in less than one run per game.
"It was a little discouraging that
we didn't pull out two victories
against ASIJ on Saturday," said
coach John Kittman. "We didn't get
the clutch hitting that we needed."
Juniors Michelle Schneider and
Marey Crouch, the number three and
four batters respectively, went hitless
over the weekend. It is difficult to
score runs when the heart of the
order does not produce.
Though UOP has a solid pitching
staff, Stanford hitters, especially
Schneider and Crouch, will look to
take theirfrustrationsoutatthe plate.
The l igors are led by sophomore
pitcher Brandee McArthur.
UOP is currently tied for first in
the Big West, one of the toughest
conferences in the nation. They have
been playing well lately, winning five

of their last six games, and are in po
sition to make a case for an invite to
postseason play.
While the postseason hopes of
UOP are at stake today, Stanford has
a lot riding on this doubleheader as
well. Not only will UOP test Stan
ford's resiliency, but these games
serve as good preparation for the
tough Pac-10 matchups the Card
faces this weekend. Stanford meets
the Washington I luskieson Saturday
and the UCLA Bruins on Sunday.
"It is important for us to learn
from our mistakes and put last week
end behind us." said junior Becky
Blevins. "We got beat by the best
team in the nation, but so have almost
all of their opponents. We have to
keep our confidence and remember
that we're still the No. 12 team in the
nation."

Though UC JP's strength comes in
its pitching, its batters have been on
tire as of late, leading it to five victo
ries hist week.
" I heir hitting has really picked up
lately, as they've been scoring more
runs," Rittman said. "They have a
very scrappy team that will not quit
and will take advantage of any op
portunities we give them."
Stanford's pitching and defense
will have to perform as consistently as
it has throughout the season if the
Card wants to tame the Tigers.
Last weekend, Crouch pitched
well against both ASI and Arizona,
while Blevins was on against ASI
but struggled against the 'Cats.
Stanford took Monday off to rest
and rejuvenate itself after the tough
weekend of action. The Card meets
UOP today at 2:00 p.m.
