# Lessons in pain: Rob gets injured
## 
### 
Three weeks ago, Vanessa had
AC I reconstruction on her left knee,
a common injury in women 's basket
ball — a Id Kristin Folkl — but one
that requires five months of rehab and
lots of pain medication. This week
Vanessa decided that I should feel her
pain. I didn 't know how to be 6 feet tall
and horrible at Monopoly, but she
went on to explain her idea. Here's
how it went down.

Va: Robin, you've never been in
jured.
Robin: That's not entirely true. I
often sprain my thumb during heated
tiddlvwinks battles, and I think I
tweaked my funny bone jumping
over the softball fence.
Va: Just as I suspected, total wimp ac
tion. You have no idea what it's like
to be injured. I bet you couldn't even
get around.
Robin: You're on, suckabitch! I'll
take that bet. What's so hard about
crutches and a Velcro brace?
The next day I went to the training
room, and Mark. Vanessa's rehab
guru, fit me with a nifty, black brace
ami aluminum crutches. The plan was
for me to continue my normal routine
with the added obstacle that an injured
athlete would face. It lasted less than
12 hours, and we decided to w rite
about the ordeal.
Robin: Damn, this brace makes my
leg hurt!
Va: No kidding. I low was your day?
Robin: It sucked, but I really feel I
have a greater appreciation for what
you go through every day.
Va: So what was the first problem?
Robin: I didn't really get as much
sympathy as I was expecting. In fact
my roommate tried to trip me. and
my other friends just laughed and at
tributed my injury to another I 1)1.
Va: That's what I would've thought.
DDl's — Unidentified Drunken In
juries— are your specialty.
Robin: Stop making me feel like an
alcoholic. Can somebody get me a
beer?
