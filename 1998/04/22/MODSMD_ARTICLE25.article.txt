# Lessons in pain: Rob gets injured
## 
### 
Three weeks ago, Vanessa had
AC I reconstruction on her left knee,
a common injury in women 's basket
ball — a Id Kristin Folkl — but one
that requires five months of rehab and
lots of pain medication. This week
Vanessa decided that I should feel her
pain. I didn 't know how to be 6 feet tall
and horrible at Monopoly, but she
went on to explain her idea. Here's
how it went down.

Va: Robin, you've never been in
jured.
Robin: That's not entirely true. I
often sprain my thumb during heated
tiddlvwinks battles, and I think I
tweaked my funny bone jumping
over the softball fence.
Va: Just as I suspected, total wimp ac
tion. You have no idea what it's like
to be injured. I bet you couldn't even
get around.
Robin: You're on, suckabitch! I'll
take that bet. What's so hard about
crutches and a Velcro brace?
The next day I went to the training
room, and Mark. Vanessa's rehab
guru, fit me with a nifty, black brace
ami aluminum crutches. The plan was
for me to continue my normal routine
with the added obstacle that an injured
athlete would face. It lasted less than
12 hours, and we decided to w rite
about the ordeal.
Robin: Damn, this brace makes my
leg hurt!
Va: No kidding. I low was your day?
Robin: It sucked, but I really feel I
have a greater appreciation for what
you go through every day.
Va: So what was the first problem?
Robin: I didn't really get as much
sympathy as I was expecting. In fact
my roommate tried to trip me. and
my other friends just laughed and at
tributed my injury to another I 1)1.
Va: That's what I would've thought.
DDl's — Unidentified Drunken In
juries— are your specialty.
Robin: Stop making me feel like an
alcoholic. Can somebody get me a
beer?

Va: Not until we finish the column.
Robin. Back to work. Did you have
any problems getting around?
kohin: Yeah, that was the worst part.
First I tripped in a puddle in White
Pla/a and a small child laughed at me.
Then I went to the drugstore and lost
my balance against a whole shell ol
hair dye. (Sorry. Chandra.)
Va: That sounds horrible. I mean,
tunny. My worst balancing mishap
was when I did a lace plant in the
bathroom while brushing my teeth.
I'll never think of the shower curtain
in the same way.
Kohin: I don't even want lo know.
()ne thing 1 did notice was a change in
my attitude.
Va: Did you become more chipper
and loving of small animals, like me?
Kohin: 1 wouldn't quite describe you
that way. The word 1 would use is hit
ter. As the day progressed, 1 found
myself falling into the same attitude.
No longer was Screech on "Saved By
the Bell" a cute dork with a hair prob
lem. I found myself wishing Slater
would, just once, beat the crap out ol
him.
Va: That's scary. I often wish for that
too. Can't we go back to the good old
days? Blair and Tootie fighting was
far superior programming.

Kohin: I think you watch a little too
much television.
Va: Shut up, we've gotta finish. The
new "Love Boat" is coming on. Cio
pher returns this week.
Kohin: Do you have any more ques
tions, or should I leave you alone with
the TV (iuide?
Va: Just one final quandary I )id you
have to use the bathroom? 1 find this
to he the biggest challenge ohm day.
Kohin: I don't know how you do it. 1
think you and Folkl must've held it
for three weeks. 1 had to cheat and
lake the brace off. I he physics ol it all
w as way too complicated.
Va: What? You didn't live the true
experience? You don't know what
it's really like to be injured until you
try to wipe your rear standing on one
foot.
Kohin: I'm sorry. But 1 do feel like
the experiment was a success. I kind
of understand how hard it is to get
around, and the girl at the Corner
Pocket gave me a free pity fro yo.
Va: I Icy. I never get free fro yo. Bas
tards! There is one difference be
tween the two of us I'm in actual
pain!
Kohin: Oh yeah, that must really
suck. (ilad I'm not vou.

Vanessa and Robin have decided to
leave a short distance. Rohm would
also like to acknowledge the pain of
Man/lands and Vella.
