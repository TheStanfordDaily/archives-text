### Michacla Crouch Staff writer 
While those outside the Stanford men's vol
leyball program would not be surprised by its
performance this season, those inside the orga
nization are somewhat disappointed by the
season's outcome.
"Our expectations are really different than
those of people outside our program — we ex
pect to contend for a national championship
year in and year out." said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves. "Quite honestly. I don't think a
Stanford men's volleyball team will feel satis
tied with anything less than a national champi
onship."

points." Nieves said. "As a group, the players
are disappointed that the> couldn't play at that
potential more consistently."

the first time that the Cardinal had ever de
feated the Bruins at Stanford, and ran the
Card's winning streak over UCLA to three
matches. However, that win came after a dis
