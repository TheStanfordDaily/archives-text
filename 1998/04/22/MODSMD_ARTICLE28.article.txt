ULTIMATE FRISBEE
■ Friday-Sunday: Men's team: Stan
ford 13, Davis B I: Stanford 13. Las
positas 5: Stanford 11. Davis A 4;
Stanford 13. Santa Cruz 7
Women's team: Stanford 13, Las
positas 3; Stanford 13. California 5;
Stanford 13, Santa Cruz I

I he men's team, led by senior
captain Alex Young, blasted past the
Davis B team 13-1 and defeated Las
Positas 13-5 early on in the tourna
ment.
In the third round, the Card faced
the tougher of the two Davis teams.
Finally, the Stanford men broke a
sweat to beat Davis 11-4.
The momentum carried into the
next match but was slowed down by

Santa ( ruz, who was expected to be
the ( aid's strongest adversary. Stan
lord started out strong with help
from rookie senior Carl Eriksson
and rookie graduate student Rob
Nail, who stepped up to make quick
offensive maneuvers and accurate
and clean throws while making key
defensive plays, helping the Card to
an early 2-0 lead.
But Santa Cruz would not go the
way of the other Stanford oppo
nents. I he Banana Slugs kept their
hopes alive, tying the match at 2-2.
Stanford managed to pull up by one
before calling a timeout.
"I his was the last game of the day,
and we were hot and tired," Young
said. "The sideline wasn't talking to
us on the field and we were begin
ning to lose focus. I lie timeout was a
time for us to really turn it back on
when we needed it."
After the timeout, the Card re
took the lead with plenty of support
and coaching from the sideline. With
a renewed intensity. Stanford pulled
away from Santa Cruz to end the
match with a score of 13-7.
The undefeated men will now
enter the regional tournament as the
No. 1 seed. Former captain and fifth
vear student Mike Payne was nomi

nated by the team to be one of the
top contenders for the prestigious
Callahan Award, which honors the
MVP in the world of college Ulti-
Diate.
"It was a lot of fun." Young said.
"We have regionals in three weeks.
We've worked really hard through
out the spring break and raised the
intensity and focus of our practices.
"We've finally gelled as a team.
We still have much more work to do.
The hard work paid off and we've
taken a step in the right direction."
The Stanford women met with
just as much success as the men's
squad and took the tournament and
earned the No. 1 seed in only three
matches.
Stanford eased past the first two
matches against Las Positas and ( al
ifornia with 13-3 and 13-5 wins, re
spectively.
In the final round, the Card ex
pected a tough match from Santa
Cru/. but what it got was a complete
blowout, as Stanford held the Ba
nana Slugs to one score and won the
match 13-1.
Delia Chu, the only freshman on
the Stanford A team, impressed the
crowds and fellow team members
with her offensive plays. ('hu utilized

short cuts, strategic runs and her
speed to make some of the key catch
es for Stanford, offensively and de
fensively.
"Delia was really able to build the
momentum we needed for our victo
ries," said junior Mary Hunt Martin.
Sophomore Aileen Carrigan,
who stepped up her caliber of play in
this tournament, was another rookie
who embodied the Card's greatest
strengths — depth and potential.
The Ultimate women's A team
entered the tournament with half of
its team injured, but to anyone in
the audience, the play exhibited was
nothing short of a team in top form.
Despite a knee strain, former cap
tain and senior Andrea Johnson was
nominated for the Callahan Award
for the strength of her performance
this season.
Both the Stanford men's and
women's B teams also made region
als as the women beat Sonoma 11-2
and the men pulled out a hard-fought
victory over Cal.
"We were really on," Martin said.
"The rookies stepped up so much.
The whole team played and we
learned from this tournament. Now
we are just looking forward to the re
gionals."
