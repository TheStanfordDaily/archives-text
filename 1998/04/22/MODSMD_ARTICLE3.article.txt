## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Asst. History Prof. Karen Sawis
lak yesterday filed an appeal of
Provost C'ondoleezza Rice's deci
sion to deny her tenure.
The action represents Sawislak's
final appeal in a long process since
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven first denied her tenure
last fall. Shoven and Rice both de
clined to reverse the decision on ap
peal: it now will go to University
President Gerhard Casper and the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council for a final review.
Sawislak said she decided to file
the appeal because she "wasn't sat
isfied with the provost's disposition
of my appeal to her.
"I hope that the advisory board
and the president will give it their
closest consideration, she said.
"I'm continuing to pursue this be
cause I feel my tenure denial was un
just."
Rice has declined to comment on
Sawislak's ease due to confidentiali
ty issues.
Casper h;is 60 days in which to
i eplv to the request, according to the
faculty grievance procedures.

Sawislak. an
American labor
historian, original
ly won a unani
mous vote — one
person abstained
from the Histo
ry Department in
favor of her
tenure. Although

she has been unsuccessful in her at
tempts to have the decision re
versed. students and faculty alike
have joined together in her support.
The student Coalition to Tenure
Karen Sawislak has scheduled a
rally for Thursday at noon in White
Plaza in order to draw attention to
both Sawislak's case and a perceived
lessening in the University's efforts
to diversify its ranks.
"We really felt like it was time to
take this to a more public forum."
doctoral student Chuck Carlson
said.
"The issues around Karen's
tenure relate to the issues in a num
ber of other tenure cases recently,
and we feel it's something that's
going to keep happening."
Sawislak's is the second hiuh


Sawislak
profile tenure case in the past year.
The first, in the Anthropology De
partment, resulted in Rice granting
tenure to Akhil Gupta, now an asso
ciate professor.
Two more female professors in

the School of Humanities and Sci
ences — Religious Studies Prof.
Alice Bach and English Prof. Joss
Marsh — have been denied tenure
this year.
Carlson said the coalition feels
the University's record reflects a re
treat from its commitment to diver
sity.
"We're definitely in the middle

of a retreat from affirmative action
at all levels in the University — hir
ing. recruitment of students." he
said.
Carlson added that the rally,
which also aims to unite various
groups on campus concerned about
the University's diversity, was not
planned in conjunction with Sawis
lak's appeal.
