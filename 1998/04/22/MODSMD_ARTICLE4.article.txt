and "Take your turn at intersections
and crosswalks" — will attempt to
alert students to basic cycling rules.
Ciccarelli expressed concern that
too many students do not recognize
that they often violate rules of traffic
conduct. "Did you know that when

you operate a bicycle you're legally
a driver, with all the rights and re
sponsibilities of a motorist?" he
asked.
He also encouraged bicyclists to
be careful and reminded staff mem
bers in attendance that biking can be
fatal if cyclists fail to take safety pre
cautions.
In addition to safety issues, Cic
carelli stressed the importance of
setting reasonable goals when mak

ing the switch from driving to biking
to work.
However, even if commuters
start biking to work only one day a
week, he added, these efforts can
make important contributions to
pollution control.
Over time, many cyclists begin to
enjoy their daily commute as a stress
management tool and a boost to
their normal fitness routines, ac
cording to workshop organizers.
