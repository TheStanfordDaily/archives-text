### Kumar Narayanan Staff writer 
In a strong Rush, fraternities Kappa Alpha
and Delta Kappa Epsilon and sororities Kappa
Alpha Theta and Delta Delta Delta all received
enough pledges to till their houses next year.
All four organizations were offered housing
for the coming year contingent upon receiving
enough new members to fill their houses. l he
Office of Student Activities, in conjunction with
the Office of Residential Education, also stipu
lated different requirements for the groups to
receive housing depending on their situation
this year.
Rush was "absoluteh marvelous." according
tocoterminal student Andrea Fa/. ;i I heta ser\
ing on the Intersorority Council, l he Rush
process for sororities ended on April 7 I'a/ said,
and the Thetas received about 30 new members.

bringing the sorority close to the 0 member
limit set by the council.
Senior Alice Prager. IS( president and a I ri-
Delt. said her sorority received "in the upper
20s" of new pledges, bringing the organization
close to 70 as well
Both sororities, which w ill be housi d in Cow
ell Cluster, have more members wh > want to
live on campus than the approximate!) 50
spaces that each house will allow
The situation is not problematic, according
to I'az. who estimated that 10 to 15 percent ol
the members will be abroad, while a few mem
bers will choose not to live in (ireek housing.
I'he two fraternities returning to on-campus
housing next \ear had similar luck.
Fraternit) Rush ended Mondax night, at
which point each fraternit) turned in its bids
I he KAs and Dekes. both ol whom were of
fered their old houses, received enough pledges

to fill their housing.
Junior Rob Moore, vice president of the
Dekcs. said his fraternity had 10 formal pledges,
bringing the roster to the number they need
ed to fill their house.
Sophomore Hob Baird. the KA president,
said the KAs received 33 pledges, who will join
28 returning members. In addition, the KAs so
licited three men who will live at the KA house
without joining the fraternity. Ihe group was re
quired to till percent ol its 51 -person house to
get it back; next year, the KAs must fill KM) per
cent of the house's capacity
(ireek leaders said it is hard to tell how much
housing affected Rush
"It's difficult to say. quite frankly ," Pa/ said.
"Statistically, it didn't make any differ
ences " Prauer :uKU*il
However, logistically, the hous
ing made a huge impact. Moore
spoke of the difficulties of coordi
nating Rush while the Dekes were
scattered all over Palo Alto.

"It makes it hard to run upstairs
to talk to the financial manager and
see how much money you have left
when he's across campus; it's made
things more difficult than in the
past," he said.
"But we like getting out and
meeting people."
All of the pledges knew that

they would be offered housing, Paz
said. However, each of the organi
zations have a priority system in
place to determine which members
get housed. The remainder of deci
sions will be done by a preference
system, which the University re
quires of housed organizations, ac
cording to Paz.
