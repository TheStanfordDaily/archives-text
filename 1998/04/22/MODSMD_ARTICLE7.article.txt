# Stanford Bulletin undergoes facelift
## 
### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
In the past lour years, the Stan
lord Bulletin has been red. blue,
teal and turquoise. But one thing
has stayed the same: its size.
Come next fall however, the one
constant in students' lives is going
to change. The Bulletin just got big
ger. And more stylish.
Under the direction of Universi
ty Registrar Roger Printup, the
Bulletin — which provides infor
mation on majors, degree require
ments and courses for students — is
slated to increase in size for the
1998-99 school year. The si/e will
now he 8.5 inches by 11 inches,
making the Bulletin closer in ap
pearance to the Approaching Stan
lord booklet.
The cover will also undergo a
face lift. Instead of featuring only a

small picture of the campus, it will
have more graphics and photos.
Both of these changes have come as
an effort to make the Bulletin more
accessible and useful for students
and staff, Printup said.
"The major criteria is that 1 have
to be able to read it," Printup joked
about the font and style changes to
come.
"I think that the layout will be
clearer and people will be able to
navigate it more easily."
"I'm hoping for something more
spiffy ... something a little more
artsy," he added.
Among other changes and addi
tions for next year is a large table
listing each undergraduate major
and the total credits and prerequi
sites required, as well as whether an
honors options is available. This
addition was recommended by fac
ulty members on the Committee

for Undergradu
ate Studies.
Although the
final version has
not yet been de
cided on. Printup
and the Regis
trar's Office antic
ipate that the Bul
letin will he thin-

tier and easier to read due to an in
crease in font si/e and a higher
quality of paper.
The money required to make
these changes is part of the regis
trar's budget, and no additional
funds are being allocated from the
University.
The new design of the cover
won't cost any more money, as the
current Bulletin also uses color,
Printup said. But the other increas
es in size and paper quality will
raise the cost of production.

"I'm not sure whether there has
been any student input on the
issue," said Editorial arid Publica
tions Coordinator Tom Stephens.
He emphasized, though, that the
main purpose was to make the Bul
letin easier for everyone to read
and use.
The current Bulletin is being
mailed to new students, and the
new and improved IWN-W Bulletin
will be available for students on
campus at the usual time next fall.
The Bulletin is also available on the
Stanford Information Network on
the World Wide Web during the
latter half of the summer.
"A ehange like this always adds
more work." Printup said, "but I
hope that the final product is an im
provement over what we have been
doing and that it helps people get
the information they need more
quickly."
