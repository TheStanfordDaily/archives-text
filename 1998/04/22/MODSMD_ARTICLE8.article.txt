The Bookstore is $1.4 million behind last year in
revenue intake, its CEO said last night.
Speaking with the Bookstore's Board of Direc
tors, CEO Peggy Mendelson discussed plans to
overcome the loss in revenue as well as the state of
current operations at the Bookstore and its sub
sidiaries in an annual meeting held at the Law
School.
According to Mendelson. the decline in rev
enues comes mostly from the drop in computer
hardware and software sales.
Since Stanford no longer focuses its supports on
Macintosh computers, the Microdisc Department
of the Bookstore has lost sales to outside dealers of
PCs. she said. Mendelson plans to expand the
Bookstore's acquisition of Toshiba, Dell and other
PC brands.
The Bookstore has also seen a 3 percent drop in
the revenue from non-textbook sales. Mendelson
said she blames the explosion of online bookstores
and competition from local bookstores for the
downturn.

On a more positive note, the Bookstore has es
tablished a user-friendly World Wide Web site
(http://bookstore/depts/textbooks/index.html)
where students can find out what books they need
for classes and whether the Bookstore has them in
stock at the time.
"The Web site gives the costs and the number of
books available so students can make shopping lists
in their dorm," Mendelson said. "Faculty can also
submit adoptions online, and this will cut down on
errors in book editions and time spent making calls
to find out exactly what professors want."
An adoption is the list of required books for a
class.
The Bookstore is also planning a massive com
puter conversion in May and June to improve effi
ciency and cut down on long lines, Mendelson said.
This should be completed by the beginning of the
next school year.
In addition to discussing financial figures and
upcoming projects, Mendelson addressed other is
sues pertinent to students. Mendelson hopes to
continue to increase the availability of used text
books and to better inform students about the

Bookstore's hook buy-back program.
"Many students don't know that we pay 50 per
cent of the new price of a book if a faculty member
has adopted it for the next quarter," Mendelson
said. "This buy-back price can be higher than what
the student may have bought the book for used."
When asked about competition from student
groups like Stop Monopolies on Campus, which
seeks to facilitate the trading of books between stu
dents. Mendelson said she encourages such pro
jects but has not seen a drop in book buy-backs as a
result.
The Bookstore plans to offer its rebate program
again this year, and Mendelson said she is hoping
for higher rebates from increasing profits at its
other stores.
She said she also plans to use surplus funds for
"more projects like the Tax-Free Day and
storewide sales that benefit all members of the
Stanford community."
The Bookstore is run by an independent non
profit corporation, which also owns Tresidder Ex
press, the Track I louse and the I University Shop at
the Stanford Shopping Center.
