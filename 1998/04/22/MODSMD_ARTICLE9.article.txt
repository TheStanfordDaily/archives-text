# Error forces MCAT retake
## 
### Kelly Christeson Contributing writer 
You have pulled more all
nighters than the moon. Your so
cial life has shriveled up smaller
than Lake Lagunita in August. But
you're ready to take the MCAT.
You read your first passage and
then move on to the questions. But
something is wrong. The passage
discussed fast food restaurants, and
the questions are about astronomy.
Actually, if you were one of the
unlucky 1 ,(KH) prospective medical
students who took an incorrectly
formatted test last Saturday, the
stars really were on your paper and
not in your head.
Due to a printing error, eight of
the 10 questions that followed a nu
trition passage dealt with black
holes.
The Association of American
Medical Colleges told the Chroni
cle of Higher Education that 20 of
the 600 centers that administered
the test received a faulty version.
Tests administered to Stanford stu
dents were apparently error-free,
but senior premedical student Al
fred Lin said he heard from friends
in the Bay Area who had mis
matched tests.
"We had one printing problem
once where the items were not
readable," MCAT administration
manager Jack Hackett told the
Chronicle. "But one where the
pages were beautifully printed and
the questions were completely mis
matched? Never."
To correct its mistake, the asso
ciation is sending letters to the
2.200 students involved — includ
ing those who took the test and
those who were in the same room
and whose test-taking was disrupt-

Ed — presenting three options.
First, students can void the test.
Their tests will be discarded with
out being scored, registration
money returned in full and no
record of them ever taking the
exam will exist.
Students' second alternative is
to change their score option to "no
release," an action usually only al
lowed before the test begins. Then
the test will be scored, but no infor
mation will be sent on to the med
ical schools.
A final option is having the test
scored as usual, disregarding mis
matched questions. Students must
'Every once in a while test
sites have problems, but
I have never heard of tests
having problems.

write to the association and request
it to send a letter to the medical
schools explaining that scores may
be inaccurately low due to an error
on the exam.
When nerves are high, the effect
of mismatched questions is not just
isolated to the inaccurate ques
tions.
"It definitely would have
freaked me out and affected my
overall performance." said Peter
Hammerman, a junior who took
the MCAT on Saturday.
Angelika Rampal, a senior who
took the test last spring, echoed his
thoughts. "It would start your day
off on the wrong foot," she said.
She explained that the verbal
portion is the first of four sections
— the beginning of an eight-hour

day filled with five hours and forty
minutes of testing. "I'd be hating
life," she said.
Despite the negative effect of
the confusion on their results, both
said they would choose to send the
scores, accompanied with an expla
nation letter, to medical schools.
Although she had not heard
anything about the screw up. Veri
ty Powell of the Undergraduate
Advising Center offered the same
advice.
The test is not offered again
until August, too late for those
wishing to apply to medical school
this year. Medical schools will not
usually consider applicants for the
interviewing phase until their ap
plications, including MCAT
scores, are complete. By the time
the August test scores are re
turned, most medical school have
already started the interview
process.
Judy Colwell, assistant director
of Stanford Medical School admis
sions, said she had never heard of
such a mishap.
"Every once in a while test sites
have problems," she said. "But I
never heard of tests having prob
lems."
Last spring at the San Francisco
test site, Powell recalled, a man
walked in with a gun demanding
the proctor give him a copy of the
exam.
The proctor gave him some pa
pers, and the man walked out.
Upon realizing, however, that
the papers were merely sample
essay questions, he returned.
Students tackled the man and he
was arrested. Because of religious
reasons, Powell said, the man was
scheduled to take the test the next
day and was hoping for an advantage.
