-6 Tips for Safe and legal Bicycling at Stanford
TAKE YOUR TURN AT
INTERSECTIONS AND CROSSWALKS
Because on your bike you're legally
a driver, you just can't breeze
through intersections If it's not
your turn, you must be able to stop and
yield until the other drivers have
proceeded. When approaching an
intersection, stop pedaling until you
have checked in all directions, then
yield if it's not your turn
In crosswalks, walkers have the right
of way. but did you know bikers
don 't (unless they 're walking their
bike)? So either walk your bike
through a crosswalk, or take your
turn with cross traffic just as if you
weren't in the crosswalk
