Housing and Dining Services is looking
to raise the quality of services across campus
hy continuing to consolidate and streamline
its operations.
Among the many changes that are sched
uled for Housing and Dining is an ef fort to
make the facilities across campus more con
sistent.
Changes will also include a concerted ef
fort to reduce the growth rate of room and
hoard hills, continued consolidation of
dorm services and a more streamlined
Housing and Dining staff.
Several private consulting firms are help
ing Housing and Dining to design ways to
cut costs without compromising service or
quality, according to Keith Guy. head of

Housing and Dining Services. ,
"We've continued to focus on making
the system more competitive financially,"
said University Budget Director I im Warn
er. "It's a long-term proposition ... hut
we're making progress."
Next year, the price for room and board
will increase by 2.K percent, which is under
the local inflation rate of around 4 percent,
according to Warner. This rate of growth is
also less than the increases slated in the tu
ition on campus, at 3.8 percent.
The funds to increase the quality of stu
dent dining are being allocated from the
Housing and Dining budget. The budget
will continue to fund the Capital Improve
ment Plan — a 12-vear program that is
working to renovate all of the residences on
campus that have dining facilities. This
process is about halfway done and has al

ready included changes in Stern and Wilbur.
The current project being funded by the
( IP is the consolidation of the Lagunita and
Roble Hall dining services. This combina
tion is designed to increase the overall qual
ity of food being provided for these two
c< immunities.
"We want to bring Roble and Lag to a
standard that's being met other places on
campus.' (iuy said.
Future changes featured in this new plan,
which should be completed by the fall, are a
renovation and possible consolidation of the
Toyon and Branner dining facilities. There
are plans to renovate the C < >well ("luster this
summer.
"We're trying to develop a master plan
for dininu services so we can begin to make

some changes and improvements in
dining services. We're try ing to make
a good thing better." Warner said.
There have also been several im
mediate changes made at the recom
mendation of the Housing and Din
ing Services internal review board for
this year. The point system has been

extended across quarters, and there
have been several localized changes
in meal plans.
Warner emphasized that the vari
ety of dining options that students
have consistently praised will not he
eliminated by the forthcoming
changes.
Flexibility in pricing through point
and a la carte systems will remain, as
will the residentially based dining fa
cilities.
