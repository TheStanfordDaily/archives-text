# Stars from the Farm
## Stanford alums find niches in movieland 
### Jennifer Godwin Contributing writer 
If you want to be a movie star,
Stanford is not necessarily the first
place you'd think to come. Training
in film and television production
does not have a huge presence in the
undergraduate curriculum.
Despite the lack of concentrated
resources, many Stanford alumni
have nourishing careers in enter
tainment.
"They talk about the Stanford
Mafia because there are so many of
us walking the halls of the film
school at UCLA," said Raphe Beck,
Class of "92. He is also the president
of an alumni association called Stan
ford Alumni in Entertainment and a
working screenwriter and actor.
Andrew Braugher, the star of the
television show "Homicide" and the
recent feature "City of Angels,"
graduated from Stanford in 1984.
Richard Zanuck, Class of '56,
won the Academy Award for Best
Picture with the 1990 film "Driving
Miss Daisy." Sigourney Weaver,
alien killer extraordinaire, graduat
ed from the Farm in 1972.
"We exist to encourage and cele
brate the achievements of Stanford
alumni in the industry," Beck said of
the alumni group. "There's also an
education component both at Stan
ford itself and when people get out
of school."
Among these educational activi
ties is the annual "How to Break
Into Hollywood" panel put on by
the Drama Department. This year's
panel, to be held May 2, is coordi
nated by Chris Leighton, a 1995
graduate who is a television and
screen writer.
One of the events the association
held this year was a February film
festival displaying works by the

Stanford community. Several;hun
dred people attended this event,
which was held in four studios rn the
area.
"It was inspired by the Stafford
Film Society," Heck said. "(Wtfj got
to talking to them at the pariel at
Stanford last year, and we figured if
they're showing films by Stanford
students, we could certainly be
doing the same."
With over 250 members, the
Stanford alumni organization in
Hollywood is booming and has
grown rapidly in recent years. The
group was restarted in 1989 by Brad
Krevoy, '78, with the help of fellow
alumni.
The organization primarily fo
cuses on film and television, but the
definition of entertainment is ex
panded to include music, broadcast
ing and finance. Centered in Los
Angeles, the group also has branch
es in the Bay Area and New York.
"We have a mentor list which is
available to current students as well
as current members," Beck said.
"It's a list of about 70 members who
are willing to be called up and talk
about what they do. We have helped
a lot of students find internships."
Other activities include an actors'
showcase held each June to exhibit
the acting talents of members for
agents, casting directors and pro
ducers. The group also hosts social
events of various kinds: a "Welcome
to L.A." party for recent graduates
and an Oscar party.
The "Breaking into Hollywood"
panel at Stanford is replicated with a
pair of roundtable discussions in Los
Angeles, one for acting, the other
for writing.
"It's so people who are just start
ing out can learn from those who
have been around a little longer,"
Beck explained.
