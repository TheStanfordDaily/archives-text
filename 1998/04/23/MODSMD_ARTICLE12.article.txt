Congress to vote on reform
WASHINGTON (AP) — Fearful of losing con
trol on a key issue. Republican leaders agreed under
pressure yesterday to allow major campaign finance
legislation on the floor of the House for an election
year vote.
_ " This is a great day for democracy," exulted Rep.
Chris Shays, the Connecticut Republican who has
clashed repeatedly with the GOP high command
over attempts to curtail spending in the nation's
scandal-scarred election system.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the GOP
leadership capitulated to Shays and other Republi
can rebels after becoming concerned that a petition
•drive designed to force the issue to the floor was on
the verge of succeeding and that minority Democrats
would then be in control.
As late as this past weekend, Gingrich was mak
jng telephone calls to wavering Republicans in hopes
of keeping the issue off the floor. And one reform
minded lawmaker, GOP Rep. Zach Wamp of Ten
nessee, said he received a call at home Saturday night
on the subject from Republican Party Chairman Jim
Nicholson.

King assassin dying
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) —James Earl Kay is
in a coma, his kidneys have shut down and doctors
have given the confessed assassin of Martin Luther
King Jr. only days to live, his brother said yester
day.
Kay, 70, has been in critical condition since being
taken to Nashville Memorial Hospital Monday, hut
officials there refuse to discuss his situation further.
" The doctor, he says it looks real bad." Jerry Kay
said by telephone from his home in Smartt, Tenn.
"He thinks it could be a few days."
Jerry Kay said his brother has been in a coma
since Tuesday morning and that doctors haven't
been able to raise his blood pressure enough with
medication to put Kay on dialysis.
Pam Hobbins, a spokeswoman for the state
Department of Correction, declined to comment.
James Earl Ray suffers most notably from cirrho
sis of the liver. He has been in and out of the hospi
tal more than a dozen times since December 19%.
James Earl Kay is serving a 99-year prison sen
tence for King's 1968 slaying. He confessed but has
been trving ever since to recant and get a new trial.
