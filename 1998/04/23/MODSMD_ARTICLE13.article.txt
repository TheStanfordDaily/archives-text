# Court debates harassment
## Outcome of case may impact Paula Jones' suit 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)
Supreme Court justices showed
frustration with the growing com
plexities of sexual-harassment law
yesterday as they debated a case
that could affect Paula Jones'
effort to revive her lawsuit against
President Clinton.
Several justices' comments on
the case before them indicated
they were unlikely to rule that
employers can be forced to pay
damages when a supervisor's pres
sure for sexual favors is accompa
nied by a retaliation threat that
turns out to be empty.
And. more broadly, some mem
bers appeared to be seeking a sim
pler way to resolve the increasing
number of sex-harassment law
suits filed since the high court
ruled in 1S)86 that such on-the-job

problems can be illegal sex dis
crimination.
"How did all this come up?"
asked Justice Ruth Bader (ims
burg. once a pioneering lawyer for
women's rights, in referring to the
two different legal standards now
used in sex-haiassment cases.
Jones' name was not mentioned
during the hour-long argument in
an Illinois woman's lawsuit against
Burlington Industries. But the
high court's decision, expected by
July, could help determine
whether she will win her appeal of
a judge's April 1 dismissal of her
case.
Jones accused Clinton of
propositioning her when he was
Arkansas governor and she was a
state employee.
The federal judge who dis

missed the case said employees
can collect damages only il their
refusal to submit to demands lor
sexual favors results in on-the-job
retaliation.
The judge also said Jones did
not show she suffered adverse
consequences or that Clinton ever
made a clear threat.
In the case before the Supreme
Court. Burlington wants the jus
tices to throw out a lawsuit by for
mer employee Kimberly Ellerth
who says a supervisor patted hei
bottom, made sexual innuendoes
and said he could make her |ob
"very hard or very eas\."
She was never fired. In fact, slu
received a promotion, but she saie
she quit because of the alleged
sexual harassment in the work
place.
