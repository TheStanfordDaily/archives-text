# Tobacco documents available online

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Even
though a congressional committee posted
nearly 39.000 tobacco industry docu
ments on the Internet yesterday, getting
at them isn't much easier than when they
were locked up.
The portion of the House Commerce
Committee's Web site where the docu
ments are posted is difficult to use,
requiring a powerful computer, time,
patience and more than a passing famil
iarity with Minnesota's lawsuit against
the tobacco industry.
The newly available documents are
from the 39.000 the defendants gave the
plaintiffs earlier this month, culminating
a three-year legal battle that ended when
the U.S. Supreme Court refused to block
a judge's order to release the documents.
The industrv had claimed attorney
•i i J J
client privilege in seeking to withhold the
material. The defendants delivered the
documents to the state of Minnesota and

Blue Cross and Blue Shield two weeks
ago.
The posting did not include 400 docu
ments that remained under bipartisan
staff review at the request of Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich. Those documents may
contain confidential business information
that affects the privacy of third parties or
may figure in pending litigation. Com
mittee staff were unsure when review of
those documents would be complete.
"Congress, the President and the
American people need this information
before we enact tobacco legislation." said
Rep. Thomas J. Bliley, R-Va., chairman
of the House Commerce Committee.
"Public review of these documents is an
important part of the legislative process."
One of the key problems with the
Commerce Committee site is the lack of
indexes that would make much sense to
the layperson. The only available guides
are what lawyers call "privilege logs,"

which contain only limited information.
One of the key pieces of information
is a nine-digit number called a Bates
number, which is needed to retrieve the
document. Each page of a document has
a unique Bates number, so retrieving a
document can require calling up each
page individually.
Some of the privilege logs on the com
mittee site are massive documents. R.J.
Reynolds' log. for instance, is more than
12 megabytes long.
Searching the log effectively requires
opening it from a word processing pro
gram, then conducting searches on
names or other words.
Though the Minnesota plaintiffs have
had the documents for more than two
weeks, they have introduced only a few
in court.
A court order had kept the documents
under seal until they were introduced in
court.
