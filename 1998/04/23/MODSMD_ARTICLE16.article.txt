KZSU deserves Universi
ty funding due to its valu
able emergency service

IT IS TIME for the University to
provide KZSU with the financial
security it deserves. Although the
radio station's special-fee request
passed last week, the election reminds
us that funding through the special fee
system is never fully guaranteed.
Although students primarily associ
ate KZSU with sports coverage, KZSU
is not evident on a day-to-day
Ibasis, it does make ensuring KZSU's
•'survival important.
Above all. the radio station serves as
|the campus' source of information dur
ing emergencies and is networked to
! the Emergency Broadcast System.
;Given Stanford's location in a state
Iprone to earthquakes, fires and floods,
having such a medium for disseminat
ing information in the event of an
;emergency is key.
! If having KZSU provide such ser
vices is important to the University, it
ought to be doing more to guarantee
the long-term viability of the station.
! In the past the University has par
tially subsidized the purchase of equip
ment that would enable the station to
broadcast in the event of an emergen
cy.
However the University has neither
■covered the full cost of this equipment

nor provided money in subsequent
years to maintain and I or upgrade the
equipment.
To KZSU's credit, the station has
been relatively successful in its fund
raising efforts.
This year the radio station obtained
outside underwriting from local busi
nesses that fully funded its athletic pro
gramming.
This is evidence that the station is
doing its best to raise revenue without
placing an unreasonable financial bur
den on the University or the students.
But if the University wants to use
KZSU as an emergency broadcasting
-network, it should not force the station
to fend for itself.
While students currently seem will
ing to approve special-fee requests,
only two years ago KZSU lost its fund
ing and had to scale down its opera
tions. Even at the time, the University
did not intervene and aid the station.
The fact that the radio station is left
with a precarious future dependent on
the whims of a special fee reflects poor
ly on the University's priorities.
If KZSU is to serve as the Universi
ty's emergency broadcasting network,
it is a necessity that the administration
act with an appropriate measure of
commitment to ensure that KZSU is
safe from the year-to-year struggle of
obtaining student funding.
If the University intends to use
KZSU as an emergency broadcasting
mechanism, the University must offer
the station economic as well as moral
support.
