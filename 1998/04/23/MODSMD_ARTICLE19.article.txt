## The 						fairest modern lady of all 
### 
A COUPLE OF
weeks ago I went
to the Stanford
Theater to see "My Fair
Lady." The little girl who
sat in front of me loved it.
The little boy behind me,
who was about her age.

had fallen asleep by the
end. t)uring intermission his faiher point-"
ed oat that also^<#£f'flfree
hours long, and he had liked that movie.
"Three-hour movies like 'Titanic' are
OK," the kid said. "Three-hour movies
like this one are not OK."
What a typical response, I thought with
old-fogey cynicism. It's impossible to
expect kids who've grown up with Ninten
do and MTV to appreciate old movies,
especially musicals. Then a feeling of
dread came over me. What if the kid knew
something I didn't? What if I was missing
out on a cultural phenomenon?
I'd once vowed to be the only person on
the planet who hadn't seen "Titanic." I fig
ured I knew what I needed to know by sim
ply reading about it. Now I wonder if I was
being too analytical. For example, I will
debate forever whether to see something
like "City of Angels" (because it's based
on Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire," and
I can't decide whether it'd be sacrilegious
to see a "remake" of it), and by the time I
finally decide the movie will have disap
peared from the theaters. The trouble is
that "Titanic" has hung around like a bar

nacle on the face of local theaters for
months.
I went into "Titanic" knowing that the
dialogue was inane, the love story between
upper-class Rose and working-class Jack
was trite, and that director James Cameron
comes across like the biggest schmuck in
the world. I knew when to cringe and to
.boo. and his? r ,!. didn't cafe whether the
characters lived rtr drowned Rut to my
surprise, I enjoyed-it. j v *
With Celine Dion's voice reverberating
in my head (I hadn't made it out of the the
ater fast enough), something occurred to
me. "Titanic" was like an old-fashioned
movie dressed up in brighter color, a big
ger budget and computer-generated spe
cial effects. If you ignored everything that
came out of people's mouths, you could
imagine you were watching a film from a
different era.
Rose supposedly becomes a modern
woman because Jack teaches her not to be
afraid of life but to embrace it. Although
she leaves on her corsets and high-heeled
shoes (except to pose nude), she learns
how to spit, punch a man in the face and
flip the bird. Her enlightenment is evi
dent ed by photographs showing her in var
ious exotic locales, in front of a plane and
riding "like a man."
Eliza Doolittle from "My Fair Lady"
strikes me as more modern. She has to face
the question of what a woman can do after
she is shaped by a patriarchal society and
turned out on her own. Despite the fact

that Hollywood convention returns her to
Henry Higgins at the end, she stakes her
independence from him. using what he's
taught her.
Aside from the fact that people sponta
neously hurst into song at the drop of a hat.
the essential story of "My Fair Lady" could
come from today's movie theaters (okay,
so it already has in the form of "Pretty
Woman"). T clllubt, however,
years you'll beiible to gef'aWriy with Ks fat
ing a CIV paper on "Titanic."
I like "My Fair Lady" for reasons out
side of the movie itself. I've heard the
songs since childhood. I read "Pygmalion''
last quarter. I'm learning about pronuncia
tion in my linguistics class. And I like see
ing Audrey Hepburn in big hats. Unless I
turn into a media culture buff or a Leonar
do DiCaprio fanatic overnight, I have no
interest in "Titanic" once I leave the the
ater.
Still, whether you're the kind of person
who only goes to Sunday Flicks for the
paper fights, or ventures out a bit further
to the various art houses in Palo Alto, or
patronizes the neon cinemaplexes like
most of the American population, I'll bet
you'll probably find both "My Fair Lady"
and "Titanic" to be pretty much "OK."

After seeing "Titanic," Wendy Lee, a senior
majoring in modern thought and literature,
would like to make a correction to last
week's column. She now thinks Leonardo
DiCaprio looks 13, not 12.
