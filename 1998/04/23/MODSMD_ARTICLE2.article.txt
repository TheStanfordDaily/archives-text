# Abrams surrenders
## Kicker held on $1 million bail in jail 
### Brian Singer Senior staff writer 
Eric Abrams, after remaining at large for five days since
San Francisco police issued a warrant for his arrest, surren
dered himself to Santa Clara County Sheriffs deputies yes
terday.
Abrams is on trial in Santa ("lara County on other charges.
The 24-year-old Abrams played football for Stanford
through 1995 and. as a placekicker, scored more points than
any other Stanford football player in school history.
In Santa Clara and San Francisco, Abrams faces charges
of false imprisonment, child annoyance, child molestation,
impersonating a police officer and kidnapping stemming
from four incidents. Abrams was being held on $ 1 million bail
at the Santa Clara County Jail last night. His lawyers will
argue for a bail reduction during another hearing tomorrow.
"Investigators consider his behavior (as that) of a real
predator," said Santa Clara police Sgt. Jim Arata. "He poses
a real threat to young juvenile males."
Even before Abrams allegedly posed as a police officer
and asked a San Francisco boy to remove his clothes on April
14. Santa Clara County authorities had charged Abrams with
false imprisonment and child annoyance during an incident
that occurred during the last year.
Abrams had posted bail for that charge but was taken into
custody on new charges when he arrived yesterday morning
for his scheduled court appearance.
Last week, Santa Clara prosecutors issued a warrant for
Abrams' arrest on attempted false imprisonment involving a
second teenage male. Abrams allegedly posed as a talent
scout and a sports franchise employee and made contact with
two separate people. In the first incident, prosecutors allege
Abrams took the boy to an Oakland Athletics baseball game
and to dinner at his residence before bringing the boy home.
In the second incident, Abrams allegedly struck up a con
versation with a boy on a flight from San Jose to San Diego
and later contacted the hoy to attend a Golden State War
riors basketball game after they both returned.
However. Phil Pennypacker. a San Jose attorney repre
senting Abrams in the Santa Clara County cases, said neither
child ever complained or asked to leave. "That's where (pros
ecutors] have got a problem," Pennypacker said.
Pennypacker said Abrams will plead not guilty to each of
the charges in Santa Clara County.
Before trial for these charges, however, Pennypacker
plans to argue tomorrow for a bail reduction, allowing
Abrams not only to be released from jail but also to be ar
raigned in San Francisco.
"The [Santa Clara County] case is insignificant." Penny
packer said. "He has never lied. He is a local resident and
would comply with any condition."
If convicted on all Santa Clara County charges, Abrams
c«uld face about three years in jail, prosecutors said. A con
viction on the child annoyance charge, however, would force
Abrams to register as a sex offender at each of his residences.
Two years ago, Abrams pleaded no contest to charges of
phone harassment after he allegedly posed as a Stanford
football recruiter and asked high school football players for
nude pictures of themselves
Arata said that in the most recent incidents, Abrams did
not pose as anyone having a connection to Stanford.
, The charges in San Francisco are even more serious. I ast
week, Abrams allegedly posed as a police officer and told a
13-year-old boy to enter his rental car and remove his clothes,
■"ostensibly to search for drugs." according to San Francisco
police. The boy was released a couple blocks later.

Less than an hour after that inci
dent, police allege Abrams accosted
two brothers, ages 12 and 14, order
ing them into the car. When the boys
refused and their mother drove up,
Abrams drove off but was pursued by
the mother, who called the police.
Abrams was questioned in San
Francisco regarding the second inci
dent and released.
Bail in San Francisco has been
tentatively set at $S(X),(XX), according
to San Francisco police. If convicted,
Abrams could face about 11 years,
San Francisco police said.
Despite the charges, Pennypacker
said Abrams is not a danger to society
and should be given a reasonable bail
to seek therapy.
"I don't believe he's a danger be
cause we've got some very good psy
chiatric opinions on him very recent
ly that he's not a danger, period,"
Pennypacker said.
Arata noted, however, that each
case Abrams has been involved in has
gotten more serious.
Abrams is being represented in
San Francisco by James Collins, who
was unavailable for comment yester
day afternoon.
