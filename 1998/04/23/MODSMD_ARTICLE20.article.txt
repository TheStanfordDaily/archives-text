£Rally for tenure reform
ft
[ "Confidentiality." "Meritocracy."
| "Administrative responsibility." These
| are the words which have been tossed
J around by the administration throughout
; the grievance process in Asst. History
• Prof. Karen Sawislak's tenure case. Is
■ there anything behind them?
Intended to justify the administration's
i decision to deny tenure to Sawislak, their
! effect has been to confuse the issues and
! release the administration from the need
1 to explain its decisions to students and fac-
J ulty.
{ This fallback on the "principles" gov
| erning tenure decisions is not unique to
; Sawislak s case. It has become increasing
j ly clear to students involved in tenure dis
] putes that the issue of accountability in
' the tenure process is a University-wide
' issue.
An issue in which the administration is
determined to avoid a dialogue with stu
i dents.
For this reason we are calling for a pub
lic demonstration today at noon in White
Plaza to voice student anger over the
! administration's intransigence on the
] issues of tenure reform and diversity at
J Stanford.
{ We have argued for nearly a year that
J the current tenure process structurally

reinforces the homogeneity of tenured
faculty. The record of the current adminis
tration strongly indicates discrimination
against women in the tenure process.
Several weeks ago, a report issued by
women faculty provided powerful evi
dence that women candidates for tenure
have suffered under the Casper-Rice-
Shoven stewardship. Stanford's record for
the promotion of women has long been
among the poorest in the nation. The evi
dence shows that it is getting worse.
Recently, the administration has been
issuing new rules on the consideration of
affirmative actions hires and admissions.
We fear they will undermine years of
progress in increasing diversity among stu
dents and junior faculty.
We have also been accumulating evi
dence indicating that the administration
has retreated from the modest and limited
affirmative action policy in tenure deci
sions applied by previous administrations
— a policy which simply gave diversity
candidates the benefit of the doubt in
close decisions.
This administration claims there has
been no policy change and has "found no
evidence" that such a policy ever existed.
Has the present administration in effect
raised the tenure bar for diversity candi
dates by eliminating an affirmative action
practice that guarded against bias in the
evaluative process? We demand a defini

tive statement from the administration on
the issue of whether or not an affirmative
action consideration was ever operative in
the tenure process, what it consisted of
and whether or not it has been superseded
by a new policy.
University President Gerhard Casper
has consistently endorsed the concept of
promoting diversity at Stanford.
We feel that without some kind of
proactive mechanism to admit, hire and
promote more women and people of color
the administration's support for diversity
is just hollow rhetoric.
We feel that the confidentiality of the
tenure process, the application of pur
posely and admittedly vague standards of
"meritocracy" as a guiding principle and
the administration's claim of absolute pre
rogative in overriding departmental rec
ommendations have been cynically
manipulated by the deans, the provost and
the president.
This has been done in order to quash
any public discussion of the administra
tion's record on tenure, and may well
mask a full-blown retreat from affirmative
action.
We ask for openness and accountabili
ty on these crucial questions. If you feel
that these issues should be discussed pub
licly and if you feel that the administration
should be accountable to students, to fac
ulty and to the public for both policy

changes and the impacts of those changes,
join us in White Plaza at noon today.
Make your voice heard!

Refocus on education
It is true that funding must be sought
from outside sources because of the high
cost of the Stanford education. However,
when Stanford administrators express
their intention to run the University as a
business, this greatly disturbs me.
Why is it that the number of alumni
donations has dropped? Perhaps it is
because they are discontent with the
moral and social direction of the Universi
ty. A few wealthy alumni have given large
donations.
Large donations are often impure in
motive, with requests of recognition, con
trol and power attached to them. Why not
make an anonymous, no-strings-attached
donation?
Must we be beggars, puppets and slaves
to those business entities who have only
one thing on their minds — the bottom
line, the monetary profit?
Ideally, western capitalism is a means

to the end of material abundance. Thifc
should allow society to shelve its survival
worries and provide the freedom to puii
sue the higher philosophical and spiritual
realms. When capitalism becomes an en<l
in itself, it has become a meaningless gamp
of shallow consumption and socioeconom
ic slavery.
Our University shouldn't becomi
chained to the idea of survival in a bull or
bear market. Ideally, Stanford should be a
pure center of learning with a
ity toward sharing the golden book off
knowledge with those less privileged. '
If we cater to corporations whose inter
est is not in education, we will producf
opportunities for them to control what ifc
taught.
Before this University turns into Nikfc
University, Microsoft University or
Charles Schwab University, let us rcJ
examine the priorities of Leland Stanford
Junior University as a center of highef
learning. J
