# Bordering on slander
## Take Daily endorsement with a grain of salt

A FRIEND OF mine made an
interesting point about one of the
candidates in the ASSU election.
He said, "Matt Spence is promising to
give back his $7,()(M) salary if he doesn't do
a good job. Shouldn't he also refund the
$1,50() he got paid for making the course
guide?"
Well, no. Even though the pitiful guide
couldn't possibly have helped even one
student select his or her courses, Spence
has been more than willing to take credit
for a job well done.
Since he doesn't seem to understand
that he produced a worthless product at
great expense, I'm not sure he'd actually
resign if he didn't accomplish his micro
agenda. But I'll admit, I was never con
vinced that promising to be a quitter was a
good campaign strategy.
Yet, for some reason 1 can't get a hold
on, Spence seems to be the front-runner in
this election. Last week, this paper's edito
rial board didn't just endorse him. it essen
tially gave him the job.
The endorsement read, "The biggest

challenge the Spenee administration will
face..Maybe the editorial hoard is
right. The candidate The Daily has
endorsed has always ended up winning in
recent years.
The Daily's editorial board is in large
degree responsible for the deplorable state
of the ASSU. It always falls for the wrong
guy, and it's always the student body that
gets burned.
I know it is tempting to follow its
advice. Last year, the only ground I used
to vote for our current ASSU president
was The Daily's recommendation. For
some reason I thought that was enough.
I've regretted its advice ever since.
So this year I decided to actually inform
myself and talk with people who have seen
the candidates in action. One of them is a
friend who has followed the ASSU closely.
"If Spence is elected, we'll have exactly
what we've had during the past two
years," she told me. "He has no vision for
the ASSU as an office that represents stu
dents."
So what about Maren Norton and San

tos Marroquin? Are they really a better
choice?
My friend had a realistic response: "I
have high hopes for Maren. Then again, I
thought Emily (Andrus) would be a hell of
a lot better than she was. Maren has been
a consistently hard-working senator. She's
chaired a bunch of the senate committees,
and those have been the ones that have
accomplished things this year."
Norton hasn't done as much seeking of
publicity for its own sake as Spence has.
Because she's not always around taking
the credit for everything, it's a little harder
to get to know her as a candidate.
I've never met Norton, but I have to say
I'm amazed at the praise she receives.
Everyone I've talked with has said she's a
hard worker, diligently fair, and that she
cares deeply about making Stanford better
for students. No one thought she might be
insincere. No one questioned her dedica
tion. No one thought for one second that
she was in the ASSU for the sake of her
resume.
She sounds too good to be true. Now I

really do want to meet her. I want to make
sure she exists.
Norton seems like the sort of person
who would stick through to the bitter end,
unlike this year's ASSU president, who
has a reputation for missing more meet
ings than she attends.
Norton and her running mate have
taken the sensible position that it's impor
tant to speak up about problems that stu
dents have, even when it doesn't seem like
Stanford administrators want to solve
them.
As an ASSU senator. Marroquin spoke
for constituencies which have had a tor
tured relationship with the University â€”
the disabled, eating club patrons, sorority
members and undergraduate and graduate
on-campus residents.
Norton and Marroquin have an excel
lent record of working with the adminis
tration when the time comes to stop iden
tifying problems and start talking about
solutions.
The most important thing is to get the
ball rolling, something that mav never

happen if we elect Spence. The Daily's
man proposes another year of a student
government on self-congratulatory autof
matic pilot. Not a surprise. This papef
often falls for Ihe resume packer with thtj
slickest presentation.
Well, let the editorial board promotd
who it wants, and then let it grumble about
the result. It would turn on Spence ths
same way it turned on Emily Andrus ancj
Bill Shen. It seems resigned to its complicf
itv in electing another ineffective presij
dent. Its man seems resigned to resigna 4 -
tion itself.
Or maybe we can do something else
this year. Norton and Marroquin give m<i
the feeling that an assertive, effective
ASSU is within reach.
Wouldn't that be a strange and wonderi
ful thing? All we have to do is click in th*
right boxes next Wednesday and Thursj
day.
