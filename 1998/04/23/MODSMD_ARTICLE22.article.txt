Because the Cardinal is the No. 1
seed, it does a chance of
facing either until the championship
game of the final four, set for May 2
and 3 in San Diego.
"Getting is the next
step to winning the whole thing,"
sophomore Judy Fong said.
"We're not too worried about just
getting there." br

Winning the league champi
onship was exactly what Stanford
set out to do from the beginning of
the season. The team has tried to im
prove and rise to a level that would
allow contention for a bid to the
NCAA Tournament within the next
few years.
The league title was Stanford's
first since 1995, and the team is set to
build on the title in the years to
come.
A final four title would be "sig
nificant for this lacrosse program,
relating directly to our growth po
tential over the next five years or
so," Connor said.
"It has been a goal from day one
of this season for this team to win
the championship and prove that we
are the best women's lacrosse team
in California. Next year we will set a
larger goal and so on. looking to
ward an NCAA bid in the years to
come."
