MEN'S TENNIS
■ Friday Sunday: No. 1 Stanford at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Individual Championships in Ojai, Calif.

The NCAA Tournament remains the ultimate goal
— hut for this weekend, the focus will be on the Pacific
10 Conference Individual Championships in Ojai. Calif.
With no losses this year in Pac-10 competition and
only one loss in Pac-10 singles play, top-ranked Stan
ford (24-0, 12-0 Pac-10) looks ready to dominate the
competition. The Cardinal easily took the Pac-10 team
championship, while UCLA and USC tied for second
place.
Stanford also has more ranked singles players than
any other Pac-10 team. In fact, the other Pac-10 schools
have nine ranked singles players altogether with no
more than three ranked players per team. Stanford's
entire six-man starting singles lineup is ranked.
In polls released Monday, sophomores Bob and
Mike Bryan captured the highest rankings — eighth
and 11th, respectively — while senior Paul Goldstein
and junior Ryart Wolters follow closely at Nos. 28 and
30. Freshman Alex Kim, who usually plays fifth singles,
maintained a 53rd ranking; sophomore Geoff Abrams
is No. 75.
Stanford dominated all competition this year, losing
only three of 176 dual-match points and winning 136 of
138 singles matches, an incredible feat in college tennis.
Considering the Cardinal's record this season, there
is no reason to expect anything but success at Ojai. Very
few players gave Stanford trouble during the regular
season.
Bob Bryan is looking to defend the title he won last

year. With his brother, as well as Goldstein and
Wolters, Bryan will start off the first flight of singles
play. Abrams, Kim. freshman Scotty Scott and senior
Charles Hoeveler are placed in the second (light of sin
