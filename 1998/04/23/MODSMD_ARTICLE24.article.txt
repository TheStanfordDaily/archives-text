■ Saturday: Stanford at Oregon State

l* In last weekend's California Colle
giate Rowing Championships at Lake
Natoma in Sacramento, the team com
peted against 21 other teams.
•• The varsity mert and the novice
*>omen's first boat were the most success
ful, winning the competition in times of
v -5:52.4 and 6:38.6, respectively. The varsi
ty men barely edged Out rival California

for the title, and the novice women out
rowed UC-Davis.
A rivalry has "really been established"
between Stanford and Davis, Stanford
women's coach Aimee Baker said. The
Cardinal was "behind but really pulled it
out in the last 250 meters."
Other Cardinal boats that competed
last weekend also put forward strong ef
forts. The novice women's second boat
and the men's and women's JV boats all
finished in second place.
"We've been doing fairly well," said
sophomore Ashley Adams, a JV
women's rower. "We are where we want
to be right now — we just want to contin
ue and take that further."
The novice women's second boat was
defeated by Davis, a school the Cardinal
will face again this season.
"We had a good row and look forward

to having a great race in the Pac-lOs."
sophomore Kazee Robinson said. "We
feel confident in our abilitv to do better
there."
The varsity women's boat took third
place behind Cal and USC.
"We'll meet Cal again in two weeks,"
said sophomore Lauren Russell, a rower
on the women's varsity boat. "We were
really far ahead of the other boats — it
was a clear third.'*
The novice men finished fifth, the low
est position of all Stanford boats but still
respectable.
"We rowed well in our heat, and we
were pleased with that." freshman Joey
Elger said. "We weren't pleased with our
performance in the final — we felt we
could do better."
With a race in Portland this weekend,
the Cardinal looks to establish its stand

ing in the Pac-10 with a win over rival
Oregon State. Washington is currently
the nation's No. 1 crew team, and with
just two Pac-10 teams going to nationals.
Stanford must defeat schools like Oregon
State to capture that second-place posi
tion.
Oregon State was "second in the Pac
-10 last year, and they didn't lose anyone,"
Baker said. "They are pretty tough, hut I
think we can get close and make it a
race."
With the Pac-10 championships quick
ly approaching, Stanford has just two
more races to prepare, including a home
race against Cal, Washington. USC and
Kansas in two weeks.
"Oregon State is a big rival, as far as
times go," F.lger said. "Success [this
weekend] would give us momentum for
Cal and the Pac-lOs."
