### Molly Brizgys Contributing writer 
The top sailors from the Stanford men's and
women's sailing teams will get a break this weekend •
as the Card looks to cruise to an easy victory in th<;.<

The regatta was originally scheduled in February -
but moved to this weekend after El Niflo wreaked
havoc on the local water fronts.

SAILING

■ Saturda\-Sunda\: Stanford at the North Series Re
gatta in Santa Cruz.

In February. Santa Cruz's harbor shut down for
safety reasons and the water was hea\ilv polluted,
canceling the race. The next choice of location was*
San Jose but a lake there flooded, and Stanford
wasn't able to host the event because of its owfl£
water alert. This is the first weekend available for a;
rescheduled series.
"Everyone is actually really excited that it's this*
time of the year," head coach Steve Bourdow said. "
"It's supposed to be good weather this weekend, and
it's likely to be windy, which everybody likes
cause the wind poses more of a physical challenge."i

The Pacific Coast district is split into north and
south sections, and the top five finishers in this;
weekend's regatta will travel to the district champK
onships May 1.
Stanford should have no problem making it to th«
district competition.
Joining the Cardinal in the regatta are teams'
from UC-Santa Cruz, California, San Jose State,
Monterey, Cal Maritime and Cal Polv-SLO. Ac- 5
cording to Bourdow. about 15 boats will sail, at least;
six of which will belong to Stanford. The only com- :
petition will come from Cal Maritime and Cal. each
of which has one or two quality sailors. j
Because the competition is so weak. Bourdow'
isn't requiring his top sailors to attend. With such a
long season, the coach wants to avoid burnout. '
.
"It's an optional event and I'll give the top sailor*
the weekend off." Bourdow said. "For the middle to
bottom sailors, it's their last event of the season, but
for the top sailors, they've been competing quite a
bit and will have districts and nationals coming up."
Even though the event is optional. Bourdow
thinks the entire team will come because Santa Crust
is such a nice place to sail.
The event is coed and Bourdow has yet to decidc
who will sail. In a coed competition. th«oretic«Hy an
all-woman or all-man squad could win since there
are no stipulations about mixing sexes. But Bou*~ 1
dow said the man / woman weight combination &
usually optimal.
