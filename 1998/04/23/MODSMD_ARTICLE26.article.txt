Women's rugby
The women's rugby team en
tered the regional playoffs in El
lensburg, Wash., last weekend as
possible contenders and left with a
berth to the national tournament.
And it wasn't even very close.
Stanford (11-3) met Reed Col
lege in a first-round game on Satur
day and creamed the team 37-10.
But more stunning was the team's
52-0 plastering of Central Wash
ington in Sunday's championship
game.
"We thought the final would be
a lot tougher," said team president
Lara Strauss, a senior. "They were
a little tired from their game on Sat
urday, and we were much more fit."

The team has a week off before
it faces a much more formidable
crowd of competitors at the nation
al championships.
Nationals are divided into two
camps: the Cup Division for teams
from the top four conferences in
the nation, and the Plate Division
for the bottom four conferences.
Since West Coast rugby is still a rel
atively new phenomenon — at
least by East Coast standards —
Stanford is only eligible to play in
the Plate Division championships.
But Strauss said that won't be
the case for long.
"On the East Coast, every
school has a college rugby side, so
West Coast schools are at a bit of a
disadvantage," she said. "But we're
getting there. It's been a lot closer
recently."
Stanford will face Dartmouth in

the first round of the national tour
nament on May 2. With a victory,
the team will face the winner of the
first-round game between Illinois
and Carolina a day later.
Cycling
With one race left in the regular
season schedule, the Stanford cy
cling team joins the multitude of
Cardinal squads hunkering down
for the postseason.
The team — currently a distant
fourth in the Western Collegiate
Cycling Conference behind UC-
Davis, Cal Poly-SLO and UC-
Santa Barbara — hopes to bring it
self closer to the current ruling tri
umvirate this weekend at the Stan
ford Road Race at Fort Ord, Calif.
Two weeks ago at a rainy and
snowy race at Nevada-Reno. Stan

ford came in second overall to
Davis in the road race and criten
um but came in first in the time
trial.
Head coach Art Walker hopes
the team can continue its ascent
this weekend.
"A good goal would be to try to
grab first in either the time trial or
road race and a second and third in
the other two," he said.
In two weeks, the team will trav
el to San Diego for the West Coast
Cycling Championships. Then, on
May 16 and 17. the team will send
five women and five men to the rra<
tional championships tir
Greenville, S.C.
"When wc go to nationals."
Walker said, "our women will be
the best riders there. Our mer
should do great also, but oui
women will be excellent."
