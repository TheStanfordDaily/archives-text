### Evan Moffic 
With its location in the heart of Silicon Val
ley. the University may like to think of itself as
a national leader in bringing technology into
college life. However, the second annual
Yahoo! survey of the most wired college cam
puses indicates that Stanford has room for im
provement.
In the survey results published in the May
issue of Yahoo! Internet Life magazine, Stan
ford ranked 27th among the top 1(X) wired

schools. Stanford finished behind schools such
as Dartmouth College, Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity and East Carolina University.
This year's ranking is an improvement from
last year. In Yahoo!'s first survey. Stanford
ranked X4th and was criticized for lack of inte
gration of course work with the World Wide
Web. In 1997. less than 5 percent of classes
were reported to use Web resources at all.
