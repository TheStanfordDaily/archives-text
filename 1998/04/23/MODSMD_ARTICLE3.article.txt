# Stanford 27th in tech integration rankings
## 
### Evan Moffic 
With its location in the heart of Silicon Val
ley. the University may like to think of itself as
a national leader in bringing technology into
college life. However, the second annual
Yahoo! survey of the most wired college cam
puses indicates that Stanford has room for im
provement.
In the survey results published in the May
issue of Yahoo! Internet Life magazine, Stan
ford ranked 27th among the top 1(X) wired

schools. Stanford finished behind schools such
as Dartmouth College, Carnegie Mellon Uni
versity and East Carolina University.
This year's ranking is an improvement from
last year. In Yahoo!'s first survey. Stanford
ranked X4th and was criticized for lack of inte
gration of course work with the World Wide
Web. In 1997. less than 5 percent of classes
were reported to use Web resources at all.
According to Kristen Lee, a sales manager

for the magazine, the survey tried to
gauge how well Internet technology
is integrated into the academic and
social life of the universities.
"We asked general questions like
Do you have a campus network and
student Web pages?', along with
more specific questions like "What
percentage of class use the 'Net and
post study aids and other primary
materials?' Our emphasis was on the
benefits of technology for students,"
Lee said.
Yahoo! conducted the survey in
partnership with Peterson's, the na
tion's leading producer of college
guides.
Yahoo! Internet Life's editors de
veloped a 30-page list of questions
that it sent to university administra
tors. They then calculated the rank
ings based on the schools' answers to
these questions.
Jamey Frank, an assistant director
of Residential Computing, thinks
that Stanford is doing a good job of
providing students with electronic re
sources. "We have hundreds of class
es with Web pages. We're also the
envy of most institutions nationwide.
We were one of the first schools to

provide in-room ethernet connec
tions, and we were the first school to
create residential computing staff in
1985," Frank said.
"Most schools didn't begin having
in-room access until three years ago.
You have to take these kinds of sur
veys with a grain of salt," he conclud
ed.
According to Frank, 60 percent of
dorm rooms use the in-room connec
tion, and 85 percent of students own
their own computers. In addition,
computer cluster use is at an all-time
high, with each computer averaging
1 (X) hours of use per week.
Cireg Schwartz, the resident com
puter coordinator in Granada, con
curred with Frank. When asked if he
was worried about Stanford's rank
ing. Schwartz said, "Stanford has ex
celled in many areas of Internet con
nectivity â€” we have a secure, distrib
uted system where backups are made
regularly and the connectivity is high
speed. reliable and redundancy-pro
tected."
Frank envisions continual im
provements in Stanford's integration
of electronic resources with academ
ic life. Possible new initiatives include
"incentives for professors to use Web
resources in their classes" and contin
ual upgrades of computer clusters in
all campus residences.
