Two warrants have been issued
for the arrest of Robert Carl Ander
son, who has been linked with the
burglary in Bob during winter
break.
Anderson, a resident of Bel
mont. was employed by the San
Mateo Security Company to police
the houses on the Row over winter
break.
According to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, between
$S,(XX) and $10,(XX) worth of items,
including computers, cameras, ra

dios and checks, were stolen from
the rooms of 14 different victims be
tween Dec. 29 and 30.
This figure does not include the
cost of damage to the house that oc
curred when 11 or 12 locked doors
were kicked open during the bur
glary. None of the property has
been recovered as of yet.
Anderson is currently wanted in
Santa Clara County for 14 counts of
first degree burglary and seven
counts of forgery. He is wanted in

forgery.

Three juvenile accomplices have
also been identified and charged in
San Mateo County. Though they
did not aid in the original burglary,
they were apprehended when they
attempted to use the stolen checks
to obtain cash.
Using stolen checks, the accom
plices purchased items from the
Sears department store at the Hills
dale Shopping Center in San Mateo
with the aid of a friend employed by
the store. They then returned the
items in exchange for cash. Security

attempts at passing off the forged
checks. Some checks were also used
in South Lake Tahoe.
During an interview with police,
the three youths described their in
volvement with the series of crimes.

done much of the work to bring this
case together.
