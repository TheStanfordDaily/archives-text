## No more SMOC for ASSU Senate 
### Bimal Shah Senior staff writer 
While last week's ASSU Senate
election generally ran as it has in past
years, one noticeable difference was
the absence of any candidates run
ning on a Students Monitoring Orga
nizations on Campus platform.
Last year, five candidates ran and
won on a SMOC — then known as
Students against Monopolies On
Campus — slate. SMOC was found
ed in the fall of 1996 in response to
what its founders considered exces
sively high prices at the Bookstore.
The five SMOC candidates last
year assisted one another in placing
fliers in residences, said sophomore
John Davi, one of the candidates.
"There wasn't much material
help," sophomore Nauman Khan
said of SMOC's role. "[SMOC's mis
sion] just grew to be a sort of a plat
form It was a purpose we all
wanted to support."
"It is a sweep," SMOC organizer
Danny Bramzon, Class of '97, said at
the time of the victories. "It shows
that there is a mandate for change."
While the candidates —once they
became senators — did get together
to discuss ideas, the focus of their dis

cussions generally drifted away from
SMOC's mission to unrelated goals,
Davi said. Nevertheless, the ASSU
came to an agreement with Book
store representatives to form a com
mittee to improve the quality of the
store's student services.
This year there was no salient is
sues as Bookstore prices around
which SMOC could focus its efforts.
For SMOC to play a role in electing
candidates, "it definitely needs some
thing high-profile," Davi said.
I he absence of SMOC candidates
may have been part of a bigger shift.
"In general, we've seen a movement
away from the party system," ASSU
President Emily Andrus said.
She cited two reasons for this.
First, groups requesting special fees
often banded together in the past to
support candidates so they would
have representation in the senate.
But with all but part of one special
lee request last year and only one this
year failing to get approval, these
groups are more comfortable in fore
going support of candidates.
Second, Andrus said this year's
senate has moved away from the con
tentious, bickering body of last year,
making a move away from parties a
natural consequence.
