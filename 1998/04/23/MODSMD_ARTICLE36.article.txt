## A 						ray of Sundance 
### Kerry Shaw Staff writer 
Sundance Film Festival has come to be known as
the ground from which a handful of "indie"
artists are annually plucked from obscurity and
launched into international celebrity.
The careers of filmmaker Edward Burns and ac
tress Lili Taylor were born there. And this year's find
may be first-time director Samantha Lang's film,
"The Well." A screening

of the film will be held
Saturday night at
Cubberley Auditorium.
In case you missed
Sundance in January,
the Stanford Film
Society has brought
both the film and its di
rector to campus for a
screening and question
and-answer session.
The group of 20 film
society members who
attended the festival
found "The Well" to be
one of their favorites
and wanted other
Stanford students to
experience it. Society
secretary Catherine
Chang, a junior, de
scribes the film as the
"saving grace" of her
Sundance experience.

'It was very visually evocative, and as a director interested in visual storytelling,
I found that very attractive.'

"It was the best film that I saw out of five at
Sundance," she said. "I saw the other four before this
one, and I just wasn't that impressed with any of
them. I was a little bit down on the whole Sundance
deal. On my last night I saw this film, and it made my
trip worthwhile."
After returning to Stanford, film society board
members got in touch with the Australian director's
agent and arranged her visit.
The society "tries to promote independent film on
campus and students' exposure to films that they
wouldn't necessarily be able to see anywhere else," ac
cording to junior Ann Karash, a member of the
group's board of directors.
"Last year we showed 'Antonia's Line,' and this year
the idea has grown into bringing not only a film on
reels but the director as well," she said.
The event is sponsored by the film society in con
junction with Herstory.
"It deals with a lot of important women's issues,

one of which is manic depression," ("hang said.
"Also, it is produced by an all-woman team. The
cinematographer, the producer and the two leads
are all women."
"But," she added, "I would not say that it is a
women's issues film."
Like their director, the cast and crew of "The Well"
are from Down Under. They include Miranda Otto as
the young and vivacious Katherine and Pamela Rabe
as the lonely and isolated Hester. The

movie traces the friendship between
these two women and follows young
Katherine's descent into lunacy after
she accidentally kills a man.
"I loved the story of 'The Well,' "
Lang said. "It's based on a novel by an
Australian writer, Elizabeth Jolley. I
was fascinated by the intensity and
complexity of the relationship be
tween these two mismatched but
equally passionate women."
The story begins when Hester
takes Katherine into her home as a
housekeeper. Despite their opposite
personalities, the two women de
velop a deep friendship.
Their harmony is shattered when
Katherine hits a man with her car
late one night. She eventually hides
his body in a well on their farm. In
her terror and guilt, she comes to be
lieve that the man is still alive inside
the depths of the well and that she
must love and care for him by send
ing him food and water.

Hester's at
tempts to con
vince Katherine
that the man is, in
fact, dead are fu
tile; we watch
Katherine dwin
dle slowly into a
world of depres
sion, isolation and
lunacy. Panic
erupts when the
well's water level
rises and threat
ens to expose the
secret.

According to Lang, these complex themes in"The
Well" are some of the film's most alluring qualities. "It
was very visually evocative, and as a director inter
ested in visual storytelling I found that very attrac
tive," she said.
Chang agreed with the positive review. "The story
and the performance were really compelling," she
said. "1 liked the way that the film was eerie in a sub
tle way, without trying to scare us with special effects.
It was very psychological."
The sometimes grim nature of the piece proved a
challenge to the director, who wanted to keep spirits
high during filming.
"Since the piece is psychologically intense, it some
times made for an angst-ridden atmosphere on set,"
Lang explained.
Despite this difficulty, Lang said her biggest chal
lenges were the lack of time in the shooting schedule
(although she suspects that all directors say this) and

having to cope with bad weather.
The drama is set against the eerie isolation of the
Australian desert, which the film captures through lu
cid cinematography. Chang found this to be another
highlight of the movie.
"You can almost feel the textures of the objects in
the film, and that made it a very tangible experience
I think that all this contributes to its power."
Through screenings such as this, the Stanford
Film Society hopes tc

expose more people
to Sundance films.
"Last year we took
10 people to
Sundance," Chang
said. "This year we
took 20 people, and
now we are actually
bringing some of
Sundance to Stanford.
This is the first year in
which two directors
from Sundance are ap
pearing at Stanford in
the same week," she
said. Max Makowski,
the director of "The
Pigeon Kgg Strategy,"
will speak next
Monday.
"The Well" also ap
peals to a variety of
filmmaking interests on
campus, from screen
writing to production
to cinematography,
Chang explained.
Saturday's screen
ing will follow the for
mat of Sundance.
After the show, Lang
will field questions
from the audience for
about a half hour.
"At Sundance, she

was very articulate, and she emphasized the visual
pects of the film, like the cinematography," Chang said.
The question-and-answer session will emphasize
technical aspects of the film, such as casting choices,
cinematography and screenwriting. Anyone who is
interested is also invited to attend an informal
potluck with Lang and the film society on Sunday in
the Oval, where other issues will be addressed.
Lang herself is looking forward to her first visit to
an American university and thinks the experience
will be "very exciting."
Tickets to the screening of "The Well" are available
today and tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. in White
Plaza. They are free for undergraduates with SUID.
Anyone interested in learning more about the
Stanford Film Society is invited to e-mail the group
at sfs-board@lists.

bringing some of
Sundance to Stanford.
This is the first year in
which two directors
from Sundance are ap
pearing at Stanford in
the same week," she
said. Max Makowski,
the director of "The
Pigeon Kgg Strategy,"
will speak next
Monday.
"The Well" also ap
peals to a variety of
filmmaking interests on
campus, from screen
writing to production
to cinematography,
Chang explained.
Saturday's screen
ing will follow the for
mat of Sundance.
After the show, Lang
will field questions
from the audience for
about a half hour.
"At Sundance, she

was very articulate, and she emphasized the visual
pects of the film, like the cinematography," Chang said.
The question-and-answer session will emphasize
technical aspects of the film, such as casting choices,
cinematography and screenwriting. Anyone who is
interested is also invited to attend an informal
potluck with Lang and the film society on Sunday in
the Oval, where other issues will be addressed.
Lang herself is looking forward to her first visit to
an American university and thinks the experience
will be "very exciting."
Tickets to the screening of "The Well" are available
today and tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. in White
Plaza. They are free for undergraduates with SUID.
Anyone interested in learning more about the
Stanford Film Society is invited to e-mail the group
at sfs-board@lists.
