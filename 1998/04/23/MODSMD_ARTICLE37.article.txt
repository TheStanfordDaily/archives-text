# Parsons' pleasure
## Memorial Auditorium receives some contemporary dance 
### Alexis Tygenhof Contributing writer 
The Parsons Dance Company, a
modern dance troupe that the
Boston Herald praised as "exu
berantly witty, high-energy and ath
letic," will perform in Memorial
Auditorium Saturday.
Founded by David Parsons in 1987,
the company has given almost 700 per
formances throughout the United States
and around the world. In addition to the
50 works Parsons has choreographed
specifically for this company, he has pro
duced pieces for the Paul Taylor Dance
Company, American Ballet Theater and
the New York City Ballet.
Parsons captivates audiences by
weaving his dancers' vibrancy and tech
nical fluidity into issue-driven dances
that combine large themes, such as
AIDS, with wit and mystique.
This Saturday's performance will
combine some of his most popular
pieces with his latest choreography.
In Parsons' signature piece, "Caught"
— a solo that he choreographed for
himself in 1982 — he creates the illu
sion of flight by synchronizing his
jumps with a slow-paced strobe light.
The light only illuminates him when he
is in the air; the audience never sees him
touch the ground.
The 1993 piece "Ring Around the
Rosy" uses the 14th-century Black
Death as a metaphor for the AIDS crisis.
"Closure," choreographed just last year,
reveals the fast-moving bodies of his
dancers through rays of dazzling light.
The Parsons Dance Company will also
perform Parsons' most recent piece,
"Anthem." According to the Stanford
Lively Arts, this piece "explores the com
plexities and vulnerabilities of living in a
complex technological society that stands
on the cusp of the new millennium."
Parsons choreographed "Anthem" for
his upcoming tour of New York City.
From May 10 to 15, the company will
perform at the Manhattan City Center, a
venue that seats 1,300 members of one
of the world's most critical audiences.
This season will be a critical step in
the development of one of the United
States' most stable companies. At a
time when many companies must
struggle just to stay in existence, the
Parsons Dance Company completes
every year in the black and employs its

dancers for 40 weeks of the year.
Parsons is already booking tours for
the year 2000, with international en
gagements in Japan, Australia, Greece,
Switzerland and Israel.
Success in the dance world is not new
for Parsons. Fie began dancing at age 11
and moved to New York at 16 when he re
ceived a full scholarship to the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Center in New York.
Fie fell in love with the Paul Taylor
Dance Company, and after a year of
badgering, he convinced Taylor to take
him as an understudy. Quickly becom
ing a full company member, Parsons
danced with Taylor for 10 years.
He began choreographing while he
was with Taylor, and by the time he left
his mentor to form his own company,
he already had a strong following.
His pieces have grown less polished
and more dramatic as he has matured
choreographically. Now that he's nearly
40 and is dancing less, he hopes his
choreography will calm down.
"My stuff is too much," he explained.
"It's like pounding. What I'd really like
to do is to break away from pieces that
look like choreography to ones that are
more emotional."
Despite Parsons' self-criticism, he is
an undeniable presence in the American
dance world.
According to David White, executive
director and producer of Dance Theater
Workshop in New York City, "Parsons is
in a way the modern dance analog to
Baryshnikov. In him we see the perfect
performer, the perfect body in dance."
