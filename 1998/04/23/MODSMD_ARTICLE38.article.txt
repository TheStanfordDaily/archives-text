## Uilleann pipes? A bodhr√°n? The 						Chieftains come to Stanford 
### Jennifer Godwin Contributing writer 
Stanford's Lively Arts brings the
soul of the Emerald Isle to
Stanford tomorrow night in the
form of legendary Irish group, the
Chieftains. The performance will be
the group's first visit to the Farm in
more than 16 years.
Perhaps the most famous group of
Irish musicians in the world, the
Chieftains bring such life to its per
formances that its world music
recordings regularly knock pop artists
off the charts.
The Chieftains have brought tradi
tional Irish music to the world since
1963. "To the world" isn't merely a fig
ure of speech.
The Chieftains were the first
Western group to play atop the Great
Wall of China. In 1979, they per
formed in Dublin before Pope John
Paul II and 1.35 million people. In
1983, Speaker of the House and Irish-
American Tip O'Neill invited The
Chieftans to be the first music group
ever to play in the Capitol.
The recent Irish-themed films "Rob
Roy," "Circle of Friends" and "Far and
Away" have all featured Chieftain mu
sic. Most recently, the Chieftans' al
bum "Long Journey Home" provided
the soundtrack to the PBS documen
tary miniseries of same name about
Irish in the United States.
The five-time Grammy winner
won its most recent brass Victrola in
1997 in the "Best World Music
Album" category. They were nomi
nated again in 1998 for "Best Pop
Instrumental Performance."
The Chieftains consist of six mem
bers, led by Paddy Maloney on the
Uilleann pipes and the tin whistle,
Martin Fay and Sean Keane on the
fiddle, Derek Bell strumming harp,
Matt Molloy playing the tlute and
Kevin Conneff rounding out the
group on a bodhran.
The Chieftains seem to have been
such a success partly because of its fan
tastic interest in blending their Irish

heritage with other kinds of music in
new and unusual ways. In 1997 the
group won a Grammy for "Santiago," a
collaboration with Gaiician artists from
around the world including Linda
Ronstadt, Los Lobos and Carlos Nunez.
Music on "Long Journey Home"
was performed by guest artists
including Sinead O'Connor, Elvis
Costello, Van Morrison, Eileen Ivers
and Vince Gill. The group's 1993 al
bum, "Another Country," explored
the influence of traditional Irish mu
sic in American country-western
songs. Contributors to that release in
cluded Emmylou Harris, Ricky
Skaggs, Chet Atkins, Colin Hames
and Willie Nelson.
The Chieftains has performed for
the Queen of England, jammed with
the Rolling Stones and revitalized the
compositions of legendary harpist
Carolan, a blind poet and composer
from 17th-century Ireland.
Their music is lilting, fascinating
and magical. The spirit of the Irish
will surely be drifting over Stanford
tomorrow nieht.
