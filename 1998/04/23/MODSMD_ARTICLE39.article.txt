## The 						Great American Musical 'Show Boat' shows off at the restored Orpheum 
### Samuel Park Senior staff writer 
The delight of watching a work of art, as opposed to
reading or looking at one, is indulging in the fan
tasy that the art is being created as it goes along,
making itself out of nothing. Suddenly a gorgeous back
drop comes onto the scene, and the audience swoons in
admiration. Or a beautiful, melodious note is reached by
the gifted soprano, and we've fallen in love.
This sense of surprise is infectious and unique to the
ater and especially musicals — the combination of music,
straight drama and dance. "Show Boat" is such a work of
art — full of dazzling moments that inspire one gasp af
ter the other. Imagine a Gentileschi whose colors move
and shade and deepen, or a Griffith film fleshed out in
human bodies on a stage, and you get the picture.
"Show Boat," as directed by Harold Prince, has always
been considered the Great American Musical. It will most
likely remain so, partly because no one in his right mind
has the ambition to make the Great American Musical (as
opposed to the Great American Novel, which has a dif
ferent claimant to the title every two years).
In order for an artistic tradition to perpetuate, the pre
decessors must remove their shadows and leave the field
clear. Joyce has to die before Beckett can thrive, and
Hitchcock has to retire before DePalma can take over. But
in the case of musicals, forever revived and renewed and
reborn, the new tradition can never fully transcend the
old and come into full fruition.
"Show Boat," like any great show, works at many levels.
For one, it's pure entertainment, as it follows 40 years in

the lives of a theatrical troupe as they go through good
times and tough ones.
Captain Andy and his tempestuous wife Parthy own a
show boat that performs in towns along the Mississippi
River. One of their main attractions is the gifted singer
Julie, who, in one of the show's more melodramatic mo
ments, is revealed to be a black woman passing as white.
Captain Andy's daughter Magnolia has strong ties to
Julie. Their friendship is one of the driving forces in the
show, along with Nola's more predictable romantic in
volvement with the gambler Gaylord Ravenal. The show's
emotional power is derived from the various separations
and reunions among the characters, who are family by
natural or circumstantial bonds.
At another level, "Show Boat" works as a piece of
Americana. The show itself is a part of American musical
theater history. It is the first serious musical in the form
that we know today, combining song and dance to move
along a coherent plot. And the show itself has historical
concerns, such as race relations at the turn of the century
and the birth and death of vaudeville.
"Show Boat" is best known from the garish 1951
Technicolor film, but to know it from the film alone would
be a mistake. "Show Boat" really belongs onstage, and in the
current San Francisco production, the show is perfection.
The entire production is a feast to the senses, but certain
moments stand out: the rousing "Can't Help Loving Dat
Man" sequence, the love scene on the roof of the Captain's
house and Harold Prince's brilliant montage near the end,
showing the passage of time.
Prince's fondness for heavy, clunky pieces of machin
ery fit this old-fashioned musical, and he switches seam

lessly from serious dramatic moments to lighthearted
comic melodies and vice versa. The touring production
benefits from a terrific cast led by Tom Bosley as Captain
Andy and Karen Morrow as Parthy. A particular stand
out is Andre Solomon Glover, who performs a stirring
rendition of "01' Man River."
It's worth noting, of course, that this production is
part of San Franciscan history, as it celebrates the open
ing of the renovated Orpheum Theater. The Orpheum
has been restored to great glamor and elegance through
the generosity of philanthropist Walter Shorensen.
"Show Boat" has great power, and much of it derives
from its ability to surprise the audience with one gorgeous
moment after the other. After you settle into the musical's
comfortable rhythm, an unexpectedly original melody
comes along, or an especially intense moment touches the
heart. "Show Boat" dazzles again and again over the course
of its two hours, and we're reminded of the power of great
art to excite and animate parts of us that have been asleep
or out of synch with beauty.
