I he musical numbers-are p'erlormed well,-though the
choreography in the first act is markedly dull. I specially
noteworthy are "Dance ot the Siamese Children,'" Shall
We I >aiice" and "Procession ol the While 1 lephant.'
though the phenomenal voice ol Marie Osmond
(Anna i carries the numbers heautilullv, her acting is less
exceptional. lKmond is able to convey only three moods
■v enraptured, bewildered and petulant. She seems
tragic before tragedy strikes, leaving her character un
derdeveloped. I his void is tilled by the outstanding per
lormances of the supporting cast.
Helen Yu portrays a convincing l adv I hung. the
"conscience' of Siamese tradition in the play. Lan Stuart
plavs both Uanisey and Captain Orton with the indif
ferent air of a proper Knglish gentleman.
Hut Victor lalmadges portrayal of the King of Siam
is unparalleled. He is able to juggle the Kings alternat
ing moods with great ease and slowly oilers the audi
ence a peek beneath his gruff exterior to the uncertain
man inside. His unclear motives become intriguing as
the audience struggles to distinguish between their si
multaneous sympathy and antipathy toward the charac
ter.
Overall, il you can overlook the minor shortcomings,
"I he King and I promises .three hours ol lively, glitter
ing, musical tun.
