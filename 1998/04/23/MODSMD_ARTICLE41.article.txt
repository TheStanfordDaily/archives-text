## No 'Secrets and Lies' A 						talk with Jonatha Brooke 
### Nkomo Morris Editorial staff 
Intermission spoke with
singer / songwriter Jonatha
Brooke, a former member of The
Story. The Story was a big col
lege tour circuit and alternative
radio phenomenon in 1992. Its
music was the collaborative effort
of Brooke and college friend
Jennifer Kimball.
In 1993 The Story ended. The
breakup was inevitable —
Brooke's musical ideas and
strong personality had made
group less of a collaboration
and more of Brooke's personal
sounding board. Kimball, who'd
started out as a singer / song
writer, ended up as a mere vocal
ist. Brooke moved from singer /
songwriter to guitarist, pianist,
arranger, composer and lyricist.
"There was an incredible
chemistry between Jennifer
and me," Brooke said, "But j
things had begun to be a little j
stifling creatively."
Having recently released her j|
second solo album, "10 cent [
Wings," Brooke's single "Secrets

and Lies" (no connection to the movie)
has been getting plenty of airplay on sta
tions like Z95.7 FM and LIVE 105 FM.
It's the one with the mournful wailing, a
driving piano and a complex, catchy tune.
Intermission talked to Brooke about
her musical inspirations and aspira
tions, likes and dislikes.
Intermission: Is "Jonatha" a female
form of "Jonathan?"
Jonatha Brooke: Yes, I think it is. It's
not written in stone, and I don't think
there's been any research done on it ...
Actually, someone told me that in India
it means "a crowd." But my parents had
friends who had a daughter named
Jonatha, and they loved the name so
much that they gave it to me!
I: How do you feel about your album?
IB: I adore this record! I love it. I still
drive around listening to it. I don't
know. I feel like it's exactly what I
wanted it to be. I love the musicality of
it. I love the songs. I love the perfor
mances. I love the lushness. I love the
sparseness. I love the whole thing. That
must sound so yucky. There are always
things that you want to change, but it's a
record that took over a year's time. It's its
own kind of emotional capsule, and I
love it for that. It's a labor of intense
hard work and I love it for that.

I: Your songs are so emotional and sad.
JB: I think so. I am an emotional
singer. It's the way I sing and the way I
try to sing. My inspiration as a singer
has come from a lot of emotive singers
like Stevie Wonder, Chaka Khan,
Rickie Lee Jones and people who are
really conveying conflict.
I: Chaka Khan?
JB: Yeah! Though you'd never know it.
I: The biggest question new listeners
may have is, "Who are these songs
about?" It's unclear if these songs are
personal songs, didactic songs that you
hope others will learn from or songs
about people you've met.
JB: That's a deep mystery, (laughs) It's
really all of the above. A lot of times I
write with composite people in mind.
There are elements of my emotional life
in them, and they're all mixed in with
stories of people around me. "Glass Half
Empty" is the most direct song on "10
cent Wings," because it was such a shock
when Kevin Gilbert died. And "Annie" is
definitely about three different people
that I merged so that no one would be
implicated or offended. Then it turned
out that there was a little bit of myself in
there too. I didn't even realize it until
later. I was like, "It's me, too! Damn!"
Then there are other songs in there that
are very personal and poignant and

about my own struggle and search.
I: Tell us about the song you dedicated
to your good friend singer / songwriter
Kevin Gilbert. Why did you decide to call
the song "Glass Half Empty"?
IB: On one hand, it's a song about
bitterness. Kind of like saying, "You stu
pid jerk, how could you be so careless as
to basically off yourself?" But really the
thing is that he was such a brilliant mu
sician, one of the only people I really
admired and would have wanted to col
laborate with. In anyone else's eyes he
was very successful.
He'd had a lot of really great collabo
rative things happen to him, but there
was this bitterness that he held. He al
ways felt like he hadn't gotten his fair
share, you know? He hadn't gotten his
due respect or his due success and star
dom. And when I think about how that
just rankled him, it upsets me. So that's
what the song was about. He was always
really bitter about his loss, and that
things hadn't turned out necessarily
how he'd expected. But when do they?
Especially if you're trying to be a musi
cian. 1 mean, it's such a roller coaster. It's
addressing someone as a peer, as some
one who I respect and adore and love,
and then also as someone from whom I
am learning a great lesson — to not go
down that path of bitterness and self-ex
pectation.
I: Do you think he ever would have
made it to where he wanted to be, had
he lived?
JB: I don't know. It's really hard to say.
He was working on some crazy stuff
when he died. Sort of like rock / opera.
His pace and his direction were so eclec
tic that he may have never achieved the
huge success, 'cause he was always trying
every possible different musical incarna
tion.
I: What kind of success are you
looking for?
JB: That's a very good question. It's
such a quandary, because if you're most
honest with yourself, of course you want
success and you want a lot of people to
hear your music. It's real and it is your
child that you're sending into the world.
And then with that desire and that suc
cess comes all of these pitfalls and draw
backs. So, I guess the most accurate I can
be is to say that I would love to sell a lot
of records and have my music be heard.
But not at the expense of my soul.
Success for me is sort of already here. I
have respect; there are so many people
that really love what I do. I get to tour
whenever I want and make records
whenever I want. I can make a living at
this which is kind of amazing to me.
Really amazing to me.
I: Who do you listen to?
JB: Lately I've been listening to "The
Blue Mouse," this Cuban record that
Buena Vista made. Last night I was lis
tening to Steely Dan. And I have just dis
covered a Joni Mitchell album called
"Hejira" from 1976. I love Radiohead;
they're awesome. I've got Patti Larkin.
I: A lot of your stuff sounds a little
like Rickie Lee Jones.
JB: Thank you. That's really smart of
you. She's probably my biggest influence.
I: It's really neat when artists act as

their own backup singers. You do that
extensively on "10 cent Wings."
JB: And [Jones] is the queen of
backup vocals. And she's been around
for a while, which is what I aspire to.
I: What do you think of the bad rep that
female singer / songwriters are getting?
JB: The bad rep? (laughs) I think it's
typical. There's always a backlash when
something different starts overwhelming
people, especially when it's women. It
comes in cycles. Like 10 years ago, when
1 was first starting to do this, there was a
surge of women. The same question kept
urging. It was a very empowering time.
Then there was this backlash and every
one went back to liking vacuous pop
music. Now we're back and doors are
opening. So, of course, agaim there's the
inevitable backlash. It's so tiring. There's
always this question of category and gen
der. No one ever says, "Well, what about
this surge of male singer / songwriters?"
That's just music. The thing is that we're
the ones who are really getting at the in
timate, difficult stuff. I think that's what
we're good at. We're the most honest of
the songwriters.
I: Do you see yourself doing some
thing like Lilith Fair?
JB: I'd love to. It would be a lot of fun.
I have always been annoyed at all these
male promoters saying that 1 can't have a
woman opening for me or hearing a ra
dio programmer saying that he can't put
three women in a row because it would
be redundant. It's nuts! When do they
ever refrain from playing three men in a
row? When was that ever redundant?
I: Do you find yourself acquiring the
Ani DiFranco syndrome, where you hate
being famous?
JB: No, it hasn't really come to that. I
don't think I've been spotlighted quite
the way she has. She's quite a phenom,
so everyone wants to know how she does
what she does. I've managed to maintain
a sort of privacy without anonymity. I
prefer this to skyrocketing and then
plummeting into the depths.
I: Who would you like to work with in
the future?
JB: Elvis Costello and Me'shell
N'Degeocello. I'd love to do something
with Alanis Morissette and Comme and
Lisa (who used to play with the artist
formerly known as Prince). Maybe
Shawn Colvin.
I: No Rickie Lee?
JB: You know, I would like to keep her
in the lovely space I have for her in my
heart. I can't imagine she would be easy
to work with. I'll leave it at that. I feel
that it would be two overly creative
minds in one space, and she would be
pigheaded, I would be too pigheaded
and she would be too pigheaded — then
we would collide and explode. I just
want to have tea with her or something
like that.
I: Flow old are you?
JB: 34.
I: So you're a young one.
JB: I am?
I: Well, you're not Johnny Carson.
JB: True. But I'm not Fiona Apple,
and thank God. I don't know what her
problem is.


Don't cry, Jonatha. You're a success!
