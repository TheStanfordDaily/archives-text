## The
						Bay Area's paranormal restaurant The
						Moss Beach Distillery's atmosphere is...spirited 
### Wenhsin Lee Contributing writer 
Nestled behind tiny beach houses just north of
Half Moon Bay, the Moss Beach Distillery
surprises its guests as a feast for the eyes, the
senses and the taste buds.
With a spectacular ocean view from every seat in
the house, the restaurant is the perfect place to enjoy
a sunset while eating fresh seafood. But the real draw
of the restaurant is its reputation. It's haunted by the
mysterious "Blue Lady."
To enhance its haunted reputation, the Moss Beach
Distillery uses computer-stimulated effects to frighten
(or amuse) its patrons. As one walks in, a wooden chair
shakes, lamps swing occasionally and a woman's
shadow floats across the stained-glass window.
Because of the structure of the restaurant, which has
gigantic windows reflecting the light of the Pacific
Ocean, shadows seem to float around the room as peo
ple walk. The restaurant even creates an illusion in the
women's bathroom — when someone opens the door,
an illuminated face appears in the mirror.
Both patrons and employees claim the "Blue Lady"
has shown her presence more than once. While my
roommate and 1 were at the restaurant, psychic Annette
Martin led a seance for us to talk with the lady herself.
The "Blue Lady" is reputed to be the victim of a tragic
love story during the 19305. While having an affair with
the restaurant's piano player, she came to listen to him
play every night. One night, her husband unexpectedly
showed up, and the next day the "Blue Lady" was found

dead on the beach wearing a long, blue dress.
The restaurant has been inspected by many paranor
mal investigators, and it claims to be the most haunted
restaurant on the California coast.
While I was skeptical about feeling the presence of
the ghost, I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant
and the knowledge that I was eating at a place with
such a romantic history.
Even with all of its drama, the real beauty of the Moss
Beach Distillery is its location — the beach below is
peaceful yet powerful. Nothing beats watching the
waves lap onto the shore on a clear California day.
While we watched the sunset, my roommate and I en
joyed the restaurant's culinary delights. We sampled
foods such as the homemade cheesy garlic bread, an ordi
nary loaf of bread with generous portions of cheese on
top. We also tried some seafood — oyster shooters, fried
calamari and oysters with cocktail sauce and horseradish.
We also tasted the spinach salad — fresh spinach
tossed with pancetta, feta cheese, grilled portobello
mushrooms, roasted red peppers, bacon and balsamic
vinaigrette. Overall, the food was fresh and tasty — but
nothing more unique than the usual seafood restaurant.
If you are looking for a getaway from the usual San
Francisco and Palo Alto restaurants, the Moss Beach
Distillery is definitely worth the trip. While it is a 30-
to 45-minute drive from Stanford, the drive itself
takes you away from the confines of compact build
ings and streets lined with stores.
On the way to Moss Beach all one can see is green
hills, tiny beach houses and the ocean lapping its waves
only a hop, skip and jump from your car door.
