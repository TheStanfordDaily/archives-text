## In Commemoration of ... The 						spirit and legend of Cesar Chavez comes to Stanford 
### Rito Treviño Editorial staff 
Cesar Chavez — it's a name we've all heard. But just
as many of us are clueless about Junipero Serra's role as
the Father of California, we may not know much about
Chavez's contributions to civil rights.
The Chicano / Latino community at Stanford aims
to change that. Throughout next week El Centro
Chicano and MEChA will present a series of events to
celebrate the life of the late founder of the United Farm
Workers Union.
The Cesar Chavez Commemoration Week will teach
people from Stanford and the surrounding communi
ties about Chavez's ideals and his influence on today's
culture. It will demonstrate the effect of his movement
on the musical and visual arts. Most importantly, it will
educate people about the struggles of the UFW.
"This event links Stanford's

Chicano community to the outside
community," said Frances Morales,
assistant dean of students and di
rector of El Centro Chicano. "It's a
chance to reinforce the links we al
ready have."
The Cesar Chavez Commemoration
has been a yearly event since 1994,
the year after Chavez's death.
According to Chris Gonzalez
Clarke, assistant director of El
Centro Chicano, many Stanford
students attended his funeral in
Delano, Calif., and the outpouring
of emotion was very strong.

"We needed a way to celebrate
Cesar Chavez's life," Clarke said.
They chose March 3 as a date for
the original commemoration be
cause it was relatively close to both
Chavez's birthday (March 21) and
the date of his death (April 22). It
was held in a packed Memorial
Auditorium and featured a speech
by UFW Secretary / Treasurer
David Martinez and a performance
by Dr. Loco's Rockin' Jalapeno

Band. The following year, the Latino comedy group
Culture Clash brought star appeal to the commemora
tion (at the time, they had a television program on the
Fox network).
This year's event features a concert by the up-and
coming Southern California band Ozomatli, a presen
tation by musician / actor Daniel Valdez and a "Fast for
Life" rally. Its variety of events and length of the festiv
ities makes this commemoration unique.
"This is the first time we've had a whole week of ac
tivities," Clarke explained. "In the past we were always
trying to cram 100 things into a single evening event."
"The Father of all Chicanos"
Chavez grew up experiencing the unfair treatment of
farm laborers. The foremen would discriminate along
racial lines and deny workers water and proper facili
ties. His family worked for pennies and was forced to
use the crippling short-handed hoe. Chavez and his
siblings were humiliated at school. He was shunned
from restaurants and public areas. When the workers
tried to strike or protest, they were called communists.
In 1952 Chavez was inspired when a man named
Fred Ross came to visit him in the San Jose barrio of Sal
Si Puedes ("get out if you can"). Ross was like a mis
sionary, organizing workers door-to-door through the
Community Service Organization. Chavez helped es

tablish many CSO chapters and eventually became ex
ecutive director of the organization.
In 1962 Chavez resigned because the CSO was not
supporting workers in the fields to its fullest extent. He
moved to Delano, Calif, where he built the United Farm
Workers Union with Chicano/Latino activists like
Dolores Huerta and Gilbert Padilla. They used a thun
derbird eagle as the symbol for their group.
Delano's Filipino vineyard laborers went on strike in
1965, and the Chicano workers were quick to follow.
Thus began the Delano Grape Strike — La Huelga —
which would make civil rights history. Chavez led the
workers through a protest march to Sacramento — the
longest in U.S. history — and inspired a national boy
cott of grapes. Sen. Robert Kennedy was among the
leaders who came to Delano to support the strike. In
July 1970 the grape growers finally agreed to sign con
tracts to improve workers' pay.
The UFW's struggles certainly did not end in

Delano. When the strike ended, Chavez went straight to
Salinas, Calif., where violence was breaking out against
the Western Conference of Teamsters over secretly
signed contracts. He battled the use of pesticides
through the 1980s.
Chavez became known for using nonviolent resis
tance. He studied books about Mahatma Gandhi and
Martin Luther King Jr. for inspiration. Like Gandhi,
he fasted as an ultimate means of spiritual protest.
Even at age 61 he had no qualms about going into a
36-day fast against pesticides. The fast ended with his
deteriorating health.
In 1993 Chavez died of natural causes while battling
a lawsuit in his native Arizona. He died having left farm
laborers with competitive pay rates, a medical plan and
a strong organization. To this day the UFW has contin
ued his struggle; it is currently fighting for the rights of
strawberry-pickers in the Watsonville-Salinas area.
Teaching about the struggle
Two of the presentations during the Cesar Chavez
Commemoration Week will focus specifically on ed
ucating people about the UFW movement's history
and culture.
"In a lot of ways we are trying to educate ourselves,"
Clarke said, noting a lack of knowledge within

Stanford's Chicano / Latino community.
Next Wednesday El Centro Chicano will screen a 1997
documentary about Chavez called "The Fight in the
Fields" at the Old Union Clubhouse Ballroom. This film
aired last year on PBS and was created by Rick Tejeda-
Flores, an established documentary filmmaker who cre
ated a film for the UFW in 1973, and Ray Telles, a former
assistant dean of students at Stanford. A companion
book of the same title is available at Green Library.
"For me, it's very important that we show this film
because many people don't know what they should
know," said senior Migdalia Gamboa, a program coor
dinator at El Centro Chicano. She explained that when
she went to high school in Chicago, none of her teach
ers could help her write a research paper about Chavez.
Senior Cindy Urquidez also had praise for the film.
"It gives so much history and combines it with where
the UFW is today," she said. "It covers both sides of
every issue and is more thorough than other documen

taries I've seen."
On Tuesday students will be
treated to a presentation in the
Branner lounge called "Arte del
Movimiento" (Art of the
Movement); it is co-sponsored by
Branner Presents. The guest
speaker will be Daniel Valdez, a
composer, musician, singer and
actor. He has sung a romantic lead
opposite Linda Ronstadt and ap
peared in the cornerstone Chicano
films "Zoot Suit" and "La Bamba.
Valdez was one of the founding
members of El Teatro Campesino,
a theater group that was formed
during the early days of the UFW.
The players would come up with
skits to explain union negotiations
to the farm workers and expose the
issues to mass audiences. They still
produce political plays today to in
form through entertainment.
Valdez came to Delano at the age
of 17 and was immediately af
fected by Cesar Chavez.
"Watching Cesar go through

this transformation into a bigger
than-life leader had a tremendous impact on my own
growth," Valdez said. "To me he was both like the gen
eral of a Mexican Revolution and an uncle. The basis
for the whole [Delano] strike was family."
Valdez will incorporate music into his discussion.
During the Delano strike, he helped translate spiritual
songs like "We Shall Not Be Moved" and "A Beautiful
Day Will Come" into Spanish to give the farm workers
support on the picket lines. He plans to perform a few
of these songs at Branner.
Explaining the reasoning behind one of the first
songs he translated, Valdez said, "Woody Guthrie's
'Deportee' became 'Deportado.' The song had beautiful
meaning for our movement, but the campesinos (work
ers) couldn't really appreciate it until it was translated.''
Valdez is currently working on a staged musical
about Chavez, whose speeches will be converted into
songs. Valdez's brother Luis, who wrote and directed
the aforementioned "Zoot Suit" and "La Bamba," has
already written the first draft for a Warner Brothers
film about Chavez; Daniel will compose the score.
Engaging in the fight
When Chavez was advised to end his 36-day fast in
1988 for fear that it would kill him, he wrote a statement
that said, "Today, 1 pass on the fast for life to hundreds

of concerned men and women throughout North America
and the world who have offered to share the suffering."
Next Thursday students will have a chance to help
continue the "Fast for Life." Beginning on Monday, ta
bles will be set up in White Plaza where individuals
can pledge to skip lunch on that day. If 15 or more
people from a particular dorm sign up and fast, the
dorm will donate the equivalent of the cost of their
lunch to the UFW.
"It's just a lunchtime fast; you don't have to starve
the whole day," Clarke said.
Members of MEChA and El Centro Chicano have
been attending house meetings to get as many resi
dences involved as possible. At the rally on Thursday
the UFW will bring speakers to White Plaza to talk
about the strawberry workers' campaign. A priest will
lead participants in prayer and speak about Chavez's
own fasts.
"We're doing this to recognize Chavez's contribu
tions," Gamboa said. "This will increase people's aware
ness of the current problems."
Celebrating a legend
The biggest event of the week will take place at
Tresidder Union next Friday. For the first part of the
Cesar Chavez Commemorative Celebration, El Centro

Chicano will announce the winners of its annual art
and essay contest.
The contest was open to elementary and secondary
students from across the Bay Area. Kids will be coming
from as far as Salinas to participate. The contest offers
cash prizes to the young artists and writers who best re
late the struggles of Cesar Chavez to their own lives.
It's a good opportunity for local teachers to talk
about Chicano farm worker history, and past winners
of the contest have evoked emotional responses from
the audience.
"It's really inspiring to listen to the students read,"
Clarke said.
"The first year the students sounded really nervous,"
Morales said. "Another year a high school student went
up and read about going through her pregnancy as a
personal struggle, and we were all in tears."
The submitted works will be on display at the
Jaime Miranda Lounge at El Centro Chicano begin
ning on Monday.
The Cesar Chavez Commemorative Celebration
will be headlined by two bands, Ozomatli and
Quetzal, in a concert co-presented by the Stanford
Concert Network.
"There's been a rebirth of Latino art down in the Los
Angeles area," Clarke said. "These bands are part of the
two dozen or so groups to come out of that."
Quetzal will open up the concert. As Clarke describes
them, they take sounds from older native music and
bring them up to date. The vocals of brother / sister duo
Gabriel and Martha Gonzalez are complemented by a
violin, a guitar and a varied rhythm section.
Ozomatli, who signed with ALMO Sounds this year
for its major label debut, will keep the crowd pleased
for the rest of the evening. The group has a sound that
can't really be labeled; it mixes hip hop, salsa and funk
with a variety of instruments.
The group is multicultural and relatively young, and
it has a powerful, very active stage presence. Urquidez
mentioned that when she saw the group perform at a
strawberry rally in Watsonville, there were kids per
forming with the group on stage.
"They send out a definite political message in their
lyrics that empowers people to join the fight," Urquidez
said. "They show that art is a form of resistance."
Clarke is collecting various videos and films to pre
sent at the celebration. The UFW video "Cesar E.
Chavez: A Celebration of Life," which depicts Chavez's
funeral, will open up the event. Other images will be
playing on the side as the evening progresses, as a con
stant reminder of the man who revolutionized a culture.

Valdez is currently working on a staged musical
about Chavez, whose speeches will be converted into

already written the first draft for a Warner Brothers

Next Thursday students will have a chance to help
continue the "Fast for Life." Beginning on Monday, ta

can pledge to skip lunch on that day. If 15 or more

"It's just a lunchtime fast; you don't have to starve

Members of MEChA and El Centro Chicano have
been attending house meetings to get as many resi

the UFW will bring speakers to White Plaza to talk

Celebrating a legend
The biggest event of the week will take place at
Tresidder Union next Friday. For the first part of the
Cesar Chavez Commemorative Celebration, El Centro

Chicano will announce the winners of its annual art
and essay contest.
The contest was open to elementary and secondary
students from across the Bay Area. Kids will be coming
from as far as Salinas to participate. The contest offers
cash prizes to the young artists and writers who best re
late the struggles of Cesar Chavez to their own lives.
It's a good opportunity for local teachers to talk
about Chicano farm worker history, and past winners
of the contest have evoked emotional responses from
the audience.
"It's really inspiring to listen to the students read,"
Clarke said.
"The first year the students sounded really nervous,"
Morales said. "Another year a high school student went
up and read about going through her pregnancy as a
personal struggle, and we were all in tears."
The submitted works will be on display at the
Jaime Miranda Lounge at El Centro Chicano begin
ning on Monday.
The Cesar Chavez Commemorative Celebration
will be headlined by two bands, Ozomatli and
Quetzal, in a concert co-presented by the Stanford
Concert Network.
"There's been a rebirth of Latino art down in the Los
Angeles area," Clarke said. "These bands are part of the
two dozen or so groups to come out of that."
Quetzal will open up the concert. As Clarke describes
them, they take sounds from older native music and
bring them up to date. The vocals of brother / sister duo
Gabriel and Martha Gonzalez are complemented by a
violin, a guitar and a varied rhythm section.
Ozomatli, who signed with ALMO Sounds this year
for its major label debut, will keep the crowd pleased
for the rest of the evening. The group has a sound that
can't really be labeled; it mixes hip hop, salsa and funk
with a variety of instruments.
The group is multicultural and relatively young, and
it has a powerful, very active stage presence. Urquidez
mentioned that when she saw the group perform at a
strawberry rally in Watsonville, there were kids per
forming with the group on stage.
"They send out a definite political message in their
lyrics that empowers people to join the fight," Urquidez
said. "They show that art is a form of resistance."
Clarke is collecting various videos and films to pre
sent at the celebration. The UFW video "Cesar E.
Chavez: A Celebration of Life," which depicts Chavez's
funeral, will open up the event. Other images will be
playing on the side as the evening progresses, as a con
stant reminder of the man who revolutionized a culture.

Cesar Chavez — it's a name we've all heard. But just
as many of us are clueless about Junipero Serra's role as
the Father of California, we may not know much about
Chavez's contributions to civil rights.
The Chicano / Latino community at Stanford aims
to change that. Throughout next week El Centro
Chicano and MEChA will present a series of events to
celebrate the life of the late founder of the United Farm
Workers Union.
The Cesar Chavez Commemoration Week will teach
people from Stanford and the surrounding communi
ties about Chavez's ideals and his influence on today's
culture. It will demonstrate the effect of his movement
on the musical and visual arts. Most importantly, it will
educate people about the struggles of the UFW.
"This event links Stanford's

Chicano community to the outside
community," said Frances Morales,
assistant dean of students and di
rector of El Centro Chicano. "It's a
chance to reinforce the links we al
ready have."
The Cesar Chavez Commemoration
has been a yearly event since 1994,
the year after Chavez's death.
According to Chris Gonzalez
Clarke, assistant director of El
Centro Chicano, many Stanford
students attended his funeral in
Delano, Calif., and the outpouring
of emotion was very strong.

"We needed a way to celebrate
Cesar Chavez's life," Clarke said.
They chose March 3 as a date for
the original commemoration be
cause it was relatively close to both
Chavez's birthday (March 21) and
the date of his death (April 22). It
was held in a packed Memorial
Auditorium and featured a speech
by UFW Secretary / Treasurer
David Martinez and a performance
by Dr. Loco's Rockin' Jalapeno

Band. The following year, the Latino comedy group
Culture Clash brought star appeal to the commemora
tion (at the time, they had a television program on the
Fox network).
This year's event features a concert by the up-and
coming Southern California band Ozomatli, a presen
tation by musician / actor Daniel Valdez and a "Fast for
Life" rally. Its variety of events and length of the festiv
ities makes this commemoration unique.
"This is the first time we've had a whole week of ac
tivities," Clarke explained. "In the past we were always
trying to cram 100 things into a single evening event."
"The Father of all Chicanos"
Chavez grew up experiencing the unfair treatment of
farm laborers. The foremen would discriminate along
racial lines and deny workers water and proper facili
ties. His family worked for pennies and was forced to
use the crippling short-handed hoe. Chavez and his
siblings were humiliated at school. He was shunned
from restaurants and public areas. When the workers
tried to strike or protest, they were called communists.
In 1952 Chavez was inspired when a man named
Fred Ross came to visit him in the San Jose barrio of Sal
Si Puedes ("get out if you can"). Ross was like a mis
sionary, organizing workers door-to-door through the
Community Service Organization. Chavez helped es

tablish many CSO chapters and eventually became ex
ecutive director of the organization.
In 1962 Chavez resigned because the CSO was not
supporting workers in the fields to its fullest extent. He
moved to Delano, Calif, where he built the United Farm
Workers Union with Chicano/Latino activists like
Dolores Huerta and Gilbert Padilla. They used a thun
derbird eagle as the symbol for their group.
Delano's Filipino vineyard laborers went on strike in
1965, and the Chicano workers were quick to follow.
Thus began the Delano Grape Strike — La Huelga —
which would make civil rights history. Chavez led the
workers through a protest march to Sacramento — the
longest in U.S. history — and inspired a national boy
cott of grapes. Sen. Robert Kennedy was among the
leaders who came to Delano to support the strike. In
July 1970 the grape growers finally agreed to sign con
tracts to improve workers' pay.
The UFW's struggles certainly did not end in

Delano. When the strike ended, Chavez went straight to
Salinas, Calif., where violence was breaking out against
the Western Conference of Teamsters over secretly
signed contracts. He battled the use of pesticides
through the 1980s.
Chavez became known for using nonviolent resis
tance. He studied books about Mahatma Gandhi and
Martin Luther King Jr. for inspiration. Like Gandhi,
he fasted as an ultimate means of spiritual protest.
Even at age 61 he had no qualms about going into a
36-day fast against pesticides. The fast ended with his
deteriorating health.
In 1993 Chavez died of natural causes while battling
a lawsuit in his native Arizona. He died having left farm
laborers with competitive pay rates, a medical plan and
a strong organization. To this day the UFW has contin
ued his struggle; it is currently fighting for the rights of
strawberry-pickers in the Watsonville-Salinas area.
Teaching about the struggle
Two of the presentations during the Cesar Chavez
Commemoration Week will focus specifically on ed
ucating people about the UFW movement's history
and culture.
"In a lot of ways we are trying to educate ourselves,"
Clarke said, noting a lack of knowledge within

Stanford's Chicano / Latino community.
Next Wednesday El Centro Chicano will screen a 1997
documentary about Chavez called "The Fight in the
Fields" at the Old Union Clubhouse Ballroom. This film
aired last year on PBS and was created by Rick Tejeda-
Flores, an established documentary filmmaker who cre
ated a film for the UFW in 1973, and Ray Telles, a former
assistant dean of students at Stanford. A companion
book of the same title is available at Green Library.
"For me, it's very important that we show this film
because many people don't know what they should
know," said senior Migdalia Gamboa, a program coor
dinator at El Centro Chicano. She explained that when
she went to high school in Chicago, none of her teach
ers could help her write a research paper about Chavez.
Senior Cindy Urquidez also had praise for the film.
"It gives so much history and combines it with where
the UFW is today," she said. "It covers both sides of
every issue and is more thorough than other documen

taries I've seen."
On Tuesday students will be
treated to a presentation in the
Branner lounge called "Arte del
Movimiento" (Art of the
Movement); it is co-sponsored by
Branner Presents. The guest
speaker will be Daniel Valdez, a
composer, musician, singer and
actor. He has sung a romantic lead
opposite Linda Ronstadt and ap
peared in the cornerstone Chicano
films "Zoot Suit" and "La Bamba.
Valdez was one of the founding
members of El Teatro Campesino,
a theater group that was formed
during the early days of the UFW.
The players would come up with
skits to explain union negotiations
to the farm workers and expose the
issues to mass audiences. They still
produce political plays today to in
form through entertainment.
Valdez came to Delano at the age
of 17 and was immediately af
fected by Cesar Chavez.
"Watching Cesar go through

this transformation into a bigger
than-life leader had a tremendous impact on my own
growth," Valdez said. "To me he was both like the gen
eral of a Mexican Revolution and an uncle. The basis
for the whole [Delano] strike was family."
Valdez will incorporate music into his discussion.
During the Delano strike, he helped translate spiritual
songs like "We Shall Not Be Moved" and "A Beautiful
Day Will Come" into Spanish to give the farm workers
support on the picket lines. He plans to perform a few
of these songs at Branner.
Explaining the reasoning behind one of the first
songs he translated, Valdez said, "Woody Guthrie's
'Deportee' became 'Deportado.' The song had beautiful
meaning for our movement, but the campesinos (work
ers) couldn't really appreciate it until it was translated.''
Valdez is currently working on a staged musical
about Chavez, whose speeches will be converted into
songs. Valdez's brother Luis, who wrote and directed
the aforementioned "Zoot Suit" and "La Bamba," has
already written the first draft for a Warner Brothers
film about Chavez; Daniel will compose the score.
