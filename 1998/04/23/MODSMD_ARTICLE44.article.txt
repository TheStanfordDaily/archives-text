# Intermission talks with Ozomatli's Wil-Dog
## 
### 
Ozomatli, the Los Angeles political-rally-band-turned
hot-music-marvel started out as a group of 20 friends
jamming together for fun. Originally, they played at rallies
for free. But as the group's popularity grew, Ozomatli found
itself playing as many as four gigs every day in addition to
a weekly spot at a Hollywood nightclub. The time had
come to cut down the number of musicians and start get
ting serious.
Now the band has 11 members: Wil-Dog on bass and
vocals, Raul Pacheco on lead vocals and guitar, Jose
Espinosa on alto sax and vocals, Ulises Bella on tenor sax,
Asdru Sierra on trumpet and vocals, Pablo Castorena on
trombone, Cut Chemist (a world-famous DJ) on turnta
bles, Juiro Yamaguchi on tablas, bongos and percussion,
Justin Poree on congas and percussion, William Marrufo
on drums and vocals and Chali 2na who raps and sings.
Intermission talked with Ozomatli founder, bassist and
vocalist Wil-Dog about the roots of the band and where he
hopes the band will go.
Intermission: There are so many people in your
band! How did you decide that, once you had five or six
members, you needed five or six more?

Wil-Dog: It wasn't like that. We started out as a jam
session that had about 20 people in it. After a while, we
were like, "We need less." (laughs) We didn't start out
trying to get a record deal. We were just a bunch of peo
ple playing. Actually, we started out of a conflict with
the National Conservation Corps and 30 of its workers.
The Corps was an organization that politicians had put
together in L.A. so that they could say, "Look, we create
all of these jobs for L.A.'s youth!" But these were 19-
year-old kids who already had two or three kids of their
own and were living off of minimum wage. Only upper
management had health and medical benefits. So we
held a sit- in at the building, locked all the doors and got
media coverage. Through mediation we gained control
of the building for a year. So we turned the building
into a Peace and Justice Center and held music benefits
so that we could get supplies. We weren't looking for
fame, it found us.
I: Why the name "Ozomatli?"
WD: It's a good metaphor for dance. We make peo
ple dance.
I: You make people dance?
WD: Well, it's like a big circle. We give the audience

the energy to dance, and they give us back the energy to
play. The idea for the band's name was the first drum
mer's. It was his middle name, which we didn't know.
He was like, "How about Ozomatli!" and we liked it.
Originally, we were called Somos Marcos (We are
Marcos) after a leader in the Zapatista struggle, but we
decided that the title was too one-sided. We all have dif
ferent political beliefs, and our purpose is to just get
our music heard. We wanted to show that.
I: How will you know when you have accomplished
your goal of bringing your music to the world?
WD: I don't know if I'll ever be finished. My goal is
constandy changing. As soon as I reach one goal, it's on
to the next. My goal is finished when I play for every
body in the world, which will never happen.
I: How do you guys make a piece of music?
WD: We are used to jamming. Lately, we are trying to
be more deliberate about things, asking questions like,
"What are we trying to say in this song?" But a lot of our
earlier shit was just kind of thrown together.
