# Various Artists:
## 'Burn Hollywood Burn: The Soundtrack' 
### 
One could best describe this album as a group of copycat
bands trying to ride the wave to fame by sounding exactly
like other successful bands.
Turtle Grove, featured twice on this album, seems nothing
more than a poor man's Hootie and the Blowfish. The lead singer
sports the same deep, scratchy male voice as [Darius Rucker] There
are also the same familiar guitar riffs with a tambourine and piano
solos.
Ashley Arrison and Darling Violetta are hot on the heels of Lisa
Loeb and Jewel as they belt out their angsty, wannabe rebelling
against-society lyrics along to acoustic guitar.
There are redeeming qualities for this album, however. Magic
Kingdom's "I Wanna Be Mike Ovitz" is a bizarre, edgy song about,
not surprisingly, Michael Ovitz. The lyrics are variations on the
song title with drums, cymbals and a punky guitar riff. The attrac
tion of this song lies in its "I bet they had fun in the studio" feel.
Also, Pimpadelic's "Out For One Thing" is in-your-face rapping
done to fast rock that reminds me vaguely of Green Jelly, for those
who can remember their Cereal Killer album. This is the kind of
song I really wish I had the lyrics to because I just couldn't help
busting out to it.
Overall, "Burn Hollywood Burn: The Soundtrack" is a compi
lation of pop rock and mellow grooves that sometimes dares to
venture into the world of honky tonk. While most of the tracks on
this album are knock-offs of other bands, 1 found Pimpadelic and
Magic Kingdom to be saving graces. In other words, check out their
albums and leave this one on the shelf.
