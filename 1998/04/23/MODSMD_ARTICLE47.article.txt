# The 						Amazing Royal Crowns

### 
The Amazing Royal Crowns recorded its self-titled
debut album in two days, but you'd never know it
by listening to it. These guys have a tremendous
amount of energy that they showcase in their jumping
combination of '50s rock and roll, rockabilly and surf
punk.
On "Do the Devil," which the Crowns are pushing
as a single, the band provides a grooving quirky rock
bassline to showcase the horn talents of the boys. The
group also simultaneously infuses the tune with its
swing-oriented vocals. "Minute With the Maker" re
veals the Crowns' talent for combining a variety of
genres with musicality and style through its Stray
Cats-esque walking bass and early Elvis-type vocals.
The Crowns are at its best when the group brings its
original touches to familiar styles of music. On "Harem
Caravan," it takes an otherwise mediocre rock tune and
throws in a middle-eastern psychobilly concoction that
takes the tune from boring to fun. Throughout the al
bum the group demonstrates a great deal of talent and
innovation in transforming straightforward rockabilly
and surf into energetic songs that are catchy and addic
tive.
To see the Amazing Royal Crowns live would
probably be an incredible experience because of the
group's terrific vivacity. To listen to its debut is to
catch only a glimpse of spirit and talent, but it is a
glimpse well worth catching.
