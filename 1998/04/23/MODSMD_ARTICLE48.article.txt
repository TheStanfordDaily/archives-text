# Spiritualized: ‘Ladies and Gentlemen we are floating in space'
## 
### 
Spiritualized's latest CD certainly lives up
to its title. With something like a million
contributors in tow, Spiritualized has
created some of the most delicate, dreamy
music I've ever heard.
"Ladies and gentlemen we are floating in
space" opens the CD. The delicate, floating
vocals are an appropriate introduction for
the rest of the album, which can best be de
scribed as a 70-minute lullaby.
"Broken Heart" is thoroughly depressing,
but quite pretty and is the perfect music for
mourning failed relationships and bad spring
weather. This song and the title track feature
Spiritualized at its best. The large variety of
instruments remains distinct and does not get
drowned out by feedback or repetitive guitar
playing.
However, such discreet musicality is lost
on the few fast songs, which end up sound
ing more like rock. The one exception is "No
God Only Religion," in which a host of
unidentifiable instruments blend with gui
tars and horns to create an exotic, urgent
rhythm.
For the most part the CD is like a whop
ping dose of morphine and will have you re
laxed in no time. In fact, the only danger
here is that it's easy to fall asleep listening to
this CD. Insomniacs need "Ladies and
Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space;" the
rest of us should merely enjoy it.
