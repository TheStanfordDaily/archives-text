# Fastball: the Pain Money Can Buy’
## 
### 
In the last couple of months, Fastball's "The Way" has taken ra
dio waves by storm. The song is on 98.5 KOME, Live 105 FM or
Alice 97.3 FM at any given time of day. The wonderful thing
about "The Way" is that, although it's a rock song, it has a Spanish
twist and a melody that could rival any Beatles tune. "The Way" is
potentially one of the year's best singles.
However, the rest of the album sounds nothing like the group's
radio hit. Most of the album centers around pop and folk rock. The
songs are all good songs in their own right, yet none matches the in
genuity and creativity of "The Way."
On first listen, most of the other songs on the album blend to
gether into one pop rock soup. But there's more to them than that.
The lyrics are extremely insightful. Friend and collaborator vocal
ist Poe, who adds her vocal gifts to "Which Way to the Top" and
gives the album a little extra spice.
In the end, Fastball serves up a good old-fashioned rock record
that gets more appealing the more you listen to it. Hopefully this is
only the beginning for this band. I'm interested to see what they'll
serve for their next musical banquet.
