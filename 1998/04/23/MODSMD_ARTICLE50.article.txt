# Sister 7: This the Trip
## 
### 
In its latest album out of Austin, Texas, Sister 7 puts together a
solid collection of groovy, melodic songs that are ideally suited
for airwaves. Patrice Pike combines the plaintive vocal style of
Alanis Morissette with a hard Southern rock 'n' roll twang that
blends well with the rest of the band. The only problem with the al
bum is that, like Alanis, the blend gets stale after a long listen.
Taken one by one, each of the tracks on "This the Trip" offers
something new and interesting. The opening track begins the al
bum with a simple, compelling groove. The next song,
"Bottlerocket," is a full-out, old-fashioned, wailing rock song. Next
comes "Know What You Mean," a quality, melodic ballad that is
easily Top 40 material.
And the album goes on ... each song is different from the one be
fore and respectable on its own ground. But by the time the album
gets through six or seven tracks, it feels like the CD should be over.
It's not that the songs are identical or that the music is worth
less — the problem is that Sister 7 maintains too much of the same
style and flavor, no matter how much the tunes may change.
To be fair, Sister 7 is not the first group to patent a style too well.
Some people have trouble listening to an entire Nirvana album or
Alice in Chains disc for the same reason. Others love 70 minutes of
predictable flavor. To each his own. But with a little studio help,
Sister 7 could go a lot further than composing catchy songs. They
could make a great album.
In the meantime, the rhythm, melody and musicianship of
Sister 7 will no doubt earn the band acclaim through live shows
and radio releases. There will be more from this band in the future.
