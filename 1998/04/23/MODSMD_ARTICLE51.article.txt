## Capturing our 'Affection' Jennifer Aniston's new movie glows 
### 
£r | he Object of My Affection" makes a point to
confuse what we define as a relationship.
There are so many nuanced pairings in this
film that a wide spectrum of acting is required. In
the film, director Nicholas Hytner wisely keeps
much of the same wacky charm that was present in
his highly-lauded "Madness of King George," but he
fails to handle the more serious matters in"The
Object of My Affection" with the same assuredness.
Jennifer Aniston is her normal Rachel-from
"Friends" self, complete with her puckered lip and
beady eyes. Her character, a social worker named
Nina Borowski, faces a possible marriage with the
wrong guy, and the only one who's sympathetic is first
grade teacher George Hanson (Paul Rudd).
Unfortunately, George is gay and apparently taken
by Dr. Robert Joley (Tim Daly) — that is, until the
doctor dumps him without directly telling him.
George is then propositioned by Nina to stay in her
quaint Brooklyn apartment, and he humbly accepts.
You would think that Nina's boyfriend, Vince (John
Pankow), would have a problem with this setup. But
for a while Vince finds George non-threatening. Vince
is the typical guy who assumes that any gay man has
always been homosexual and that he has no desire to
become intimate with females.
The tables are turned suddenly when Nina learns
she is pregnant with Vince's child. She thinks Vince
won't be a caring father, so she pushes her new best
friend — George — to raise the baby with her, in a

sort of domestic-partner relationship. Now Vince
is really pissed.
In playing the down-to-earth Nina, Aniston
strays from her usual role. Nina gets annoying at
times with her whining now-what-am-I-supposed
to-dos. But her urban city manner clashes with the
refined and uptight demeanor of well-to-do subur
bans with great success. She can be wonderfully out
of place at her parents' cocktail parties and posh
Hampton home.
But it is Rudd who steals the show. His portrayal
of George is very subtle and not overtly stereotyped
as the gay character. By the end, you really want
George to end up with Nina. They are the ideal cou
ple in terms of personality and life outlook.
Slowly, however, the movie tries to find reasons
why this couple should not continue their plan for
raising the baby. The reappearances of Dr. Joley and
a relationship with a new man (Amo Gulinello) cre
ate obstacles that prevent George from fully com
mitting to Nina. These attempts at plot complica
tion either drag on too long or aren't well developed
in the first place.
"The Object of My Affection" gently breaks down
the restrictive boundaries of the traditional roman
tic comedy. It deserves to be given a chance. Perhaps
your own viewpoint of relationships may be af
fected for the better.
