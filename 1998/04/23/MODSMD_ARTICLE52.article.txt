# ‘The Spanish Prisoner' dazzles
## Mamet gets captive audiences 
### 
Unbelievable. "The Spanish Prisoner" weaves a
magical and dizzyingly complex tale about an
aspiring businessman and his sought-after
"project." The biggest name in the film is Steve Martin,
who captures a terrific supporting role as the shady
Jimmy Dell. However, this art-house film has carefully
selected all of its players, and they play the twists in
David Mamet's script with brutal honesty.
Campbell Scott, a relative unknown, turns in a
powerful performance as the manipulated pawn. His
character, the victimized Joe Ross, is an inventor who
has created an unnamed device worth an unspecified
amount of money for an unidentified Company in
New York. The vagueness is Mamet's masterful way
of concentrating the attention on character interac
tions and creating a shroud of mystery around the
developments.
Joe trusts people until he meets the wealthy Dell
during a business trip in the Caribbean. We see him
slowly become suspicious about his Company's and
co-workers' intentions. Could they be plotting to brush
him aside once he releases the mega-valuable process
to the Company?
Dell eventually promises his oft-mentioned, but
never seen, daughter to Joe in return for the protection
of his prized design. The brilliance is that this setup
parallels the fable of the gullible and greedy Spanish
prisoner — hence the title.

Joe's only friend appears to be his secretary, Rebecca
Fidgeon (Susan Ricci). Ricci gives Rebecca a stony and
archaic charm, which makes her dialogue stick out amid
the characters. As the deceit builds, it is Rebecca who as
sists Joe in his problems, and we hope that these two can
untangle the entire mess.
Fresh off the witty script of "Wag the Dog," Mamet
creates tons of diversions in"The Spanish Prisoner" and
packs the dialogue as tightly as possible. As the director,
he has tried not to create another bloody crime-caper
like "Fargo." His effort is PG-rated, but he has made up
for the violence and language with an absolutely inge
nious world of money and miscalculations.
My one minor complaint ironically lies in one of the
movie's great strengths. Mamet hides so many important
clues in his sets and dialogue that I have to take much of
the proceedings at face value. My advice is either to get a
good night's sleep prior to watching "The Spanish
Prisoner" or plan on watching the film more than once
to pick up on all of the savory details.
"The Spanish Prisoner" makes us wonder about who
we can really trust. The film takes a "trust no one" stance
— a la The X-Files — that begins to make sense as more
details unfold and hypnotize the dazed viewer. This is
clearly destined to become one of the year's top films,
and Mamet should be proud of his latest "project."

Joe doesn't look like a prisoner to me.
