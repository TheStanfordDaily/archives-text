# It should have been a play
## 'Two Girls' is too claustrophobic

£ r I IWO Girls and a Guy" is not a movie. It is
a staged play. Not a very good staged
-L. play at that, and one with dialogue that
could only work ... on stage.
The movie basically consists of only the three
characters in the title and, for all intents and pur
poses, one set — the Manhattan loft of philan
dering actor and "guy" Blake Allen (Robert
Downey Jr.). Girl One is Carla (Heather
Graham), who is beautiful, composed and "to
gether." Girl Two is Lou (Natasha Gregson
Wagner), who is feisty, flighty and fast-talking but
also a pretty pitiful actress.
The fact that there are only three characters and
one small, enclosed set gives the movie a very claus
trophobic feel. Toss in some dialogue that only a
mother could love, and basically the audience will
be clawing on the doors trying to get out halfway
through the film.
In that sense, they'll be able to empathize with
Blake, who comes home from a business trip to
find out that his two girlfriends — he had sworn
unique, undying, monogamous love to each — are
both waiting for him in his apartment. Blake tries
to sing, dance and act his way out of this one, but
eventually he discovers that neither woman wants
revenge or redemption from him. They only want
the truth, which is apparently the one thing this
"actor" can't give them.

And so we are stuck with these three people for
an hour and a half while they try to sort through
their issues, first through alcohol, then through sex,
and finally through conversation.
Question: Any guesses why the filmmakers saved
conversation for last?
Answer: Because they couldn't write decent di
alogue. Maybe these lines would work on stage,
but they most certainly do not represent a slice of
life, at least any slice that the audience would like
to be a part of.
An example: Upon realizing that Blake deliber
ately intended to permanently remain with both
women, the idiotic Lou asks Carla, in complete se
riousness, if maybe Blake is one of those "people
in Utah." Is this for real? Is anyone really that stu
pid? And if so, why would you want to make a
movie about it?
The only redeeming quality about "Two Girls
and a Guy" is Downey's amusing, over-the-top
performance. He is admittedly excellent in his
bizarre, unsympathetic role. But the filmmakers
mess that up too by slipping in needless sentimen
tality at the end.
Good advice: Avoid "Two Girls and a Guy" in
theaters. If you have to, wait until it comes on stage.
