# No crowns for 'Suicide Kings'
## This movie has nothing to walk away with 
### 
{ s-y uicide Kings" is quite simply a movie with nothing to say. We are in-
to a series of characters who are all morally corrupt, and they
do little in the film to modify their flaws. A hotbed of acting talent,
"Suicide Kings" deals us a compelling premise. But it quickly loses its flair by
trying to be too hip and modern.
The title is derived from the two kings who have swords pointing into their
heads in a deck of cards. The phrase is aptly inserted in a card hand between
quiet Avery (Henry Thomas, "ET"), doctor-wannabe T.K. (Jeremy Sisto,
"Clueless"), jittery Ira (Johnny Galecki, "Roseanne"), smooth Max (Sean
Patrick Flannery, "Powder") and Charlie Barrett (Christopher Walken).
Charlie, a former Mafia capo, is being held hostage by the four younger card
players. The cocky Brett (Jay Mohr, "Jerry Maguire"), a fifth conspirator, re
fuses to join in the card game and tries to keep things serious. They are at
tempting to get ransom money from Charlie, who will be used to pay off the
kidnappers of Avery's sister, Lisa (Laura Harris).
As if this isn't convoluted enough, Lisa is currently the fiancee of Max,
and they were together when she was aggressively abducted from the car by
two bumbling men.
The spoiled rich boys from New Jersey feel that their plan is starting to fall
apart as Charlie works his magic and tries to create hostility within the group.
Charlie's only way out may be Lono Vecchio (Denis Leary), a man with a
golden eye for shoes and an unflinching thirst for violence. Lono does what he
is paid to do — he searches for information on the street about the identity of
the five guys and the two kidnappers they're after.
The finale to all of the chaos is very anticlimactic and rather disappointing.
We get a series of scenes that don't really generate any surprise or interest. By
the time the reels came to an end, 1 honestly could have cared less about what
happened to any of the people involved in the crime caper.

There seems to be a strong desire to follow the footsteps of "Pulp
Fiction." 1 can recall "Two Days in the Valley" and "Jackie Brown" as recent
examples of late '90s pop culture. I have grown tired of these types of sto
ries; I want real characters, believable plot lines and honest endings.
"Suicide Kings" offers us none of these, as the artificial dialogue only drags
down the lame plot even further.

Denis Leary and Christopher Walken are "kings" in their own right.
