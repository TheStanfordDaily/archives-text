# Watch it at night
## 'Nightwatch' is frighteningly good 
### 
£ -y ightwatch," starring Nick Nolte, Ewan McGregor, Patricia Arquette and Josh Brolin is the
story of Martin (McGregor), an innocent law school student who happens to be in the
X wrong place at the wrong time. After taking the job of night watchman at a local medical
examiner's office, Martin becomes an essential piece of the puzzle in a series of violent murders.
The film gets off to an exciting start when Martin is introduced to his new job by the previous
night watchman. Together they do the rounds of the massive, deserted building where they see
everything from full corpses to preserved body parts to the remains of shredded bodies.
The atmosphere is tense, and it gets even scarier when Martin must do his first solo tour of the
building during a stormy night. Eventually, Martin starts to see things most people couldn't even
imagine during his long, lonely nights on the job. When he asks Inspector Cray (Nolte) — a cop
whose favorite hangout seems to be the morgue — for help, Cray dismisses him as an inexperienced
newcomer with too much imagination.
As Martin is getting used to his new job, a serial killer is cutting up prostitutes and taking their
eyes as souvenirs. Inspector Cray, who is assigned to capture this killer, has not yet found any sus
pects. However, after Martin agrees with his best friend lames (Brolin) to meet a prostitute, he be
comes the killer's next target as well as Cray's number one suspect.

This film had a strange imbalance to
it. The scenes where Martin was walk
ing through the building by himself
were more suspenseful than when he
was being pursued by the serial killer.
The scenes with the killer, on the other
hand, were more gruesome.
While 1 particularly enjoyed the act
ing of Nolte and Brolin, the Inspector
Cray character could have used some
more depth. Arquette, who plays
Martin's girlfriend Catherine, only
serves as a potential victim and is un
derdeveloped.
Overall, this film was very enjoyable
because it contained humor, suspense
and a very interesting psychopath.
