# Can't Touch' this
## Newcomers make this romantic comedy a winner 
### 
Katie is a 25-year-old virgin living in Los Angeles. That, in a nutshell, is the basic premise of "1
Love You ... Don't Touch Me!" Believe it or not, it's actually a pretty good premise, as it gives
newcomer director Julie Davis a chance to showcase the trials and tribulations of romance
for the 20-somcthing woman.
Katie is endearingly played by another newcomer, Maria Schaffel. She's an aspiring nightclub
singer trying to "make it"in L.A. — in more ways than one. It's not that Katie can't lose her vir
ginity. And it's not that she doesn't want to. Katie's big "problem" is that she's a hopeless romantic,
an idealist of the worst sort who is waiting for her Prince Charming. But she is waiting for him with
a bitter impatience that isn't exactly making things easier.
She has a potential boyfriend, Ben (Mitchell Whitfield), but although he's totally in love with her
she actually sees him as more of a best friend. She has a potential "fling," although the fact that he's
her boss (Wally Kurth) makes the "uncomplicated sex" he advocates difficult to fathom. And she
has a potential Prince Charming in the form of a wealthy British composer (Michael Harris). With
this man, Katie eventually discovers both the joys she's been hoping for and the heartbreak she's
been trying to avoid.
And as if that weren't enough, Katie's got her female friends to worry about. They all disapprove

of her in some way or another,
whether for her virgin status or her
treatment of men in general. One of
them manages to express her gross
disapproval by scooping up the best
friend whose heart Katie has broken
and ... lifting his spirits, so to speak.
In spite of Katies many issues, "1
Love You ... Don't Touch Me!" is a
comedy in the end, and a pretty heart
felt one at that. Thanks to some hilar
ious and realistic performances (espe
cially those of Katie's female friends),
Davis manages to present a funny,
touching portrait of one woman's
headaches in the dating world — a
world to which everyone in the audi
ence can relate.
