27-word fiction

We is back! We are happy to announce that
the 27-word fiction contest has not yet ended.
Life is looking good, and it looks as if the 27-
word complaints that we all read a couple of
weeks back have called down the sun. This is a
good thing, but it's also a bad thing.
You are wondering what we mean, aren't you?
We are referring to the little bits of hell that have
begun to continuously land all over our books
and our bodies. Mosquitoes!
So, would all of you powerful weather-chang
ing poets and prosets please wish the rain back?
We miss our itchy-less skin. We miss shivering in

the dark in our heatless rooms. We miss shaking
our fists at the sky and cursing the evolutionary
traitors that made us warm-blooded. We miss
sniffling and sneezing and spreading diseases.
Please bring back the winter and the rain so
that all the mosquitoes will die. And keep sending
entries or 27-word fiction will die.
That's really the main point. Entries flooded
us these past two weeks, but unless things con
tinue to do well, this page will become ads.
