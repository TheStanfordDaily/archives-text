## how to two-time kindly 
### Mae West Coltrane 
Paul Simon would have us
believe that there are only around
50 of them. But that can't be true.
Lovers are certainly no new con
cept, and the term two-timer," as
we understand it. has been a cher
ished part of American slang
since the '20s. So never mind 50
— there have to be at least several
thousand ways to cheat on your
lover. But, like courtship itself,
anti-courtship requires some skill
and can be done well or poorly.
Two-timing has its basis in
nature. In 1975, a scientist with
the last name Brav vasectimized
select males in a bird colony just
before mating season. Not sur
prisingly, the vasectimized males
and fertile females mated and
created nests. However, not one
bird couple found themselves
childless. The females had been
having extra- "marital" affairs.
In Zaire, Uganda and
Rwanda, female gorillas require
their mates to be generous with
their genitalia. Soon after pu
berty, gorillas begin courtship
with the highest ranking male
who isn't a father or full sibling.
If no such male is available, these
wanton gorillas wait for the first
male passerby and follow him.
She'll hang with him for a cou
ple of months, but if he can't
convince another female to join
their party, his lonely wife will
leave. Female gorillas don't toler
ate monogamy. Monogamous
men get kicked to the curb.
Among humans, even adul
tery hasn't always been sinful.
According to some historians, our
concept of adultery has changed
greatly. As recently as 70 A.D., it
was OK for a male to have sex
outside of marriage as long as he
was having sex with prostitutes,
concubines, widows or maids.
Only sex with a married woman
was punishable by God.
So, justification aside —
how do you do it? First, decide
how ycu want to relate to your
S.O. ("significant other," for the
uninitiated) post-cheat. Do you
want him or her to know? If yes,
well, you don'; reai'y need my
help, just go do whatever you
will. If no, the first step is to
spend less time with him or her.
Don't do it all at once. Ease your
way out of his or hei time until
you are a twice pei week phe
nom. If, however you only hang
out twice per week, cut hangout
time from 10 hours to six, then
from six to four and so on until
you are a once per .veek phenom

that he or she iooks forward to.
The idea isn't to degrade your
time with your S.O. — just con
dense and intensify it.
Condensing isn't hard; in
tensity is. If you are doing this in
good faith, you don't want to
hurt the person you're already
with. Don't ignore him or her,
don't snap unnecessarily or
make him or h-jr feel bad. Just
spend less time. To compensate,
do some studving up. Learn
about the sexual art. There are
books on fellatio and cunnilin
gus in the bookstore. I've seen
them. Or if youi primary lover
likes opera, pui some effort into
learning about that. Talk about
what he or she wants to talk
about — sacrifice some. After
all, you are planning lo do a sort
of backstabbing that could po
tentially end vour life- So let him
or her know that he or she is
special to you even though you
are spending less time. Do this
for a few weeks without cheat
ing. If your primary S.O. grows
suspicious, take him or her out
for dinner or spend a few more
hours than usual with him or
her. Do this for a few weeks.
Then make your move.
We all have our personal
hook-up styles, so I won't coach
you in that. Just do what you do
and f v secret about it. It's helpful
if you tell your second lover what
the deal is. It's hard to trick two
people at once on this bitsy cam
pus. Someone's friend is always
somewhere, possibly pointing
and staring at you. If you tell your
secondary what the deal is, he or
she probably won't tell his or her
friends, so his or her friends won't
spy. Just keep that in mind.
Everyone forgets that "the
other woman" or "the other man"
has feelings, too. Just as you treat
your primary honey right, make
sure that you treat your sec
ondary honey right. Don't com
pare your honies, even if sec
ondary S.O. asks you to. He or she
sounds like she or he's just curi
ous, but if she or he isn't the "bet
ter" one, she or he'll store that fact
in the back of his or her mind un
til kingdom come, and lord help
you if you try and out-argue
stored tacts. There is no rebuttal
to, "You said Jerry is better in
bed!" Really, there isn't. Once
you've been backed into that cor
ner, you've become a true meanie,
and that is all there is to it.
So if you re going to cheat,
do it like a pro — treat youi
lovers well, and if they find you
out, they will kill each other be
fore they tourh you.
