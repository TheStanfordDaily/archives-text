# Focus houses change concentrations
## Naranja becomes entrepreneurial spirit, Yost to change to hum bio 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
In a move that could be consid
ered a sign of the times, Stanford is
dropping its American popular cul
ture focus house and adding an en
trepreneurial spirit dormitory.
Despite its business-sounding
name, Naranja, which will become
the entrepreneurial spirit dorm, is
not a dorm designed specifically for
economics majors.
"I think that the theme of this has
been misinterpreted." said Naran
ja's incoming Resident Fellow Ey///
Bacarde-Evolfo. "Being an entre
preneur is about a passion, not about
making money."
Yost, which was previously the

American popular culture house,
will now become the human biology
focus house. Adams, which current
ly has a human biology focus, will
have no designated focus next year.
"Because I'm a Hum Bio faculty
member, 1 was asked to take over
the program .it Adams," said incom
ing Yost Resident Fellow Armin
Rosencranz. "But we had been pre
viously offered the spot at Yost, and
we thought that Yost had more of a
community feel to it. So we'll just
move the program over there."
Focuses within houses are deter
mined and developed by the RFs.
The RF who sponsored the Ameri
can popular culture focus in Yost,
Sharon Holland, is moving out.
Thus, that focus is being discontin

ued.
Rosencranz is excited to bring a
human biology focus to Yost.
"I want to plan a wide variety of
activities that are not just career-ori
ented. but fun." he said.
He proposed sponsoring lectures
on subjects such as definitions of
beauty in different cultures and al
ternative forms of healing.
"I want to do stuff that's enjoy
able, relaxing and informative,"
Rosencranz said. "My interest is to
build a cohesive community without
forcing people do things."
Bacarde-Evolfo is also looking
forward to increasing Stanford's
sense of community.
"A focus like entrepreneurial
spirit is about building on each

other's interests, much like Stanford
as a whole does," he said.
Bacarde-Evolfo, who is the re
search director for Partners for Aca
demic Excellence, chose this focus
because he enjoys seeing the activi
ties and interests that excite people.
"My passion is working with en
trepreneurs," he said. "For example,
if you have a passion for collecting
bubble gum from around the world,
1 want you to be able to bring that to
the dorm and share that."
"And who knows? Maybe you'll
find someone who shares that pas
sion."
