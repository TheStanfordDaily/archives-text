# ASSU puts out Web-based Draw guide
## 
### Sayra Khandekar Contributing writer 
As an alternative to the official Housing As
signment Services World Wide Web site, stu
dents can now get information from the 1998
ASSIJ Draw Guide.
The idea for the guide originated in an ASSU
Senate meeting. Organized by ASSU Senator
Rita Leung, the comprehensive guide was the
first of its kind.
"It was a good idea for freshmen who weren't
familiar with the Draw process, or for a lot of
people who weren't familiar about the process."
Leung explained.
The ASSU site. http://www
leland.stanford.edu/~toodles/Draw/, borrows
from the University Housing Assignment Ser
vices' Residence Tour Web site for housing sta
tistics and charts.
The unique feature of the site, however, is the

result of a survey of current house residents.
Leung and her assistants also visited house meet
ings trying to gauge which issues were most im
portant to students in the Draw process.
I he subsequent survey asked residents to
rate features such as food quality and bathrooms
and give quotes describing life in the house.
Unfortunately, Leung had trouble obtaining
sufficient data for many houses on campus. For
example, the vast majority of Row houses have
no information beyond what is available on the
1 lousing Assignment Services Web site.
"One of the main problems we faced," Leung
said, "was that our survey was distributed right
after the Res Ed survey, and people were tired of
surveys.
"We were hoping for a better response... but
it didn't fly too well this time," she said.
She also noted that numerous changes in the
housing system posed additional difficulties in
creating a relevant guide.

"We're trying hard to encourage people to
understand all the changes" in housing for next
year, said Kathleen Bransfield, manager of
Housing Assignment Services.
"I would be concerned if students think this is
their only place for information," Bransfield
said.
One can follow a link from the main page of
the ASSU guide to the official site.
Bransfield also noted that when students
apply for housing, they must certify that they
have read the official residence agreement. The
official agreement is only available on the Hous
ing Assignment Services site.
Next year, Leung said, the ASSU will "defi
nitely publicize more and put out the survey at a
better time."
Still, she supports the guide as a good effort
for its first year.
"We wanted to give an idea of what people
thought of their own dorms."
