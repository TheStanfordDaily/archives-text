### Robert Chiles Staff writer 
An intimate group of Stanford
community members took time out
of their busy schedules to remember
deceased loved ones at an interfaith
memorial gathering in the Round
Room of Memorial Church yester
day.
Candles burned brightly at
"Honoring Lives, Remembering
Losses," as members of the Stanford
community shared with each other
feelings of grief and memories of the
departed. Three of the University's
deans of religious life offered

prayers.
According to one of the deans,
Rev. Kellv Denton-Borhaug, grief
for lost loved ones can be quite a
heaw burden in addition to other
challenges, such as school work,
which must be faced by students day
to day.
"People who experience death
continue to mourn for a long time,"
Denton-Borhaug said.
"Mourning does not really fit the
fast-paced life of this place in a lot of
ways."
The purpose of the meeting was
to facilitate an environment in which
people could share their feelings in a

spiritual context with others who
shared similar emotions.
"I think we hoped more than any
thing to provide people with a gath
ering place where they could come
together and know that they are not
alone in their losses," Denton-
Borhaug explained, "and to be able
to rituallv mark the passing of some
one they loved."
The event involved musical ac
companiment. a responsive prayer
reading in which all those present
participated, a literature recital and
a candle-lighting ceremony.
Denton-Borhaug said that it is
not easy for many students to face

grief within a college environment.
"It can be difficult all the way
around for people who have lost
loved ones and also for people who
would like to be helpful for mourn
ers," Denton-Borhaug said.
"It can be hard to know what
would be helpful to people experi
encing loss."
All who attended were given a
notepad and pen with which they
were encouraged to put their feel
ings into words.
The event was put on by the
deans of religious life, residence
deans and Counseling and Psycho
logical Services.
