Masque daringly breaks down the walls that divide
Finally, after years of neglect,
underrepresentation and violence, Masque
offers a voice to one of the most
maligned segments of society: bad poets.
Supporters say that it's about time.
"The overtly pretentious have long
been disregarded by the mainstream crit
ics as not being worthwhile. But bad
poetry has played as important a role in
human history as good poetry," said Gun
derwilly G. Dandelion, the magazine's
founder.
"I mean, what makes 'bad poetry' less
important than, I don't know, uh, 'good
poetry?' Answer me that!" he challenged
his. audience, which mostly consisted of
the posters of Morrissey he had hung up
on his wall.
"Bad poets are always tossed aside
simply on the basis that they are bad
poets. It's not fair, really. You can't
judge someone's poetry on its skin color
or sexual orientation or what have you,
and I don't see how that's any different
than what's happening here. People look
at the quality of a poem, and if it was
written by a bad poet, they refuse to
consider it !> It's simple discrimina
tion! "
Much controversy has surrounded this
student-funded magazine, from its pub
lishing nude and lewd pictures of pre
tentious pri'-oJfs to its simply grotesque,
gratuitous i/se of line breaks.
Critics have been unrelenting.
"Bad poetry is breaking up the tradi
tional American home. Legitimizing it
will destroy our values," said local
minister, Edward G. Parrish.
Studies have shown that today's ado
lescents, when faced with the pressures
of growing up in an increasingly alien
ated world, more and more often turn to
bad poetry as an expression of their
feelings.
"The problem is rampant in America
today, and journals like Masque are
spreading it like a virus," Parrish
yelled to his collection of portraits of
American presidents.
But Masque is here to stay, say its
proponents.
"Masque is the beginning of a new
paradigm — like a birthing mother, it
cries out for honesty. Cry, cry, moth
er. I want your cock, Daddy. Fuck Amer
ica, and my mother cries," the magazine
stated in a press release today.
