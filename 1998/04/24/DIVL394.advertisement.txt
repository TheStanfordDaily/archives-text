KNOWLEDGE: nine letters that spell DANGER.
In today's world you can t afford to just learn, you have to HYPER LEARN.
Hyperlearning is like normal learning, except it's hyper.
How Hyper? Oh, very hyper. Very hyper indeed.
Learn at the speed of thought.
CRASH THROUGH THE KNOWLEDGE BARRIER!!
We believe in the three H's:
Hyperreading,
Hyperwriting
and Hyperbole.
It sounds dangerous, but don't worry.
Goggles, seat belts, life jackets, pointy sticks, helmets, radioactive-resistant
clothing and gloves are provided in case the hyperlearning gets too hyper.
At this point, it should probably be mentioned that The Harvard Review is in no way responsible
when your head explodes.
Hyperlearning — it's near the edge of the EDUCATION FRONTIER. The next step Ls Superhyperlearning.
And after that? All that's left is Cybersuperhyperuberlearning. Hyperlearning, the future is here.
