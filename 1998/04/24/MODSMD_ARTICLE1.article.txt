# Screening sees snag
## 'Well' funded 
### James Pritchard Staff writer 
The Stanford Film Society is Hy
ing Australian Sundance Film di
rector Saniantha Lang to campus
so she can introduce the screening
of her film "The Well" tomorrow.
There is a catch: her plane ticket
costs $6,900.20, and the group's
special fee may not cover it.
As Lang hoards the plane in
Sydney for the presentation, the so
ciety is petitioning the ASSIJ Ap
propriations Committee for a line
item transfer in order to pay for the
ticket.
Although the film society has
approximately $11,000 left in their
allocated money from their special
fee awarded last year, it has no cat
egory for travel expenses in its
budget. Its members are attempt
ing to transfer the funds from their
large equipment budget for the
ticket.

Each time a group needs money
from its special fee, it must submit
a request to gain access to the
funds.
During the annual application
for a special fee. the ASSIJ Appro
priations Committee reviews and
sometimes changes the group's
proposed budget. Once the budget
is approved, it is submitted for stu
dent vote.
Students have the chance to see
the special-fee budgets before the
spring election every year in the
Elections Handbook. Because stu
dents vote on a specific budget, it is
difficult to redistribute funds, even
if they are still available.
The committee will review and
vote on the issue by Monday, after
Lang has arrived. It may go before
the ASSIJ Senate at its next meet
ing.
ASSIJ Financial Manager Don
Coleman explained the role of the
committee.
"Their job is to make sure that
the taxes [special fees] that students
are paying are well-spent," he said.
"it gives students an oversight,"
said Senate Chair Joe Freund.
The film society's budgeted spe
cial fee for the 1997-98 school year
is $26,145.05. The price of the tick
et would constitute more than 25
percent of their fee.
Film society Secretary Cather
ine Chang defended the decision.
"This is not a trivial or minor
event. We wanted to bring Sun
dance to Stanford â€” it wasn't a flip
pant decision."
Chang and other members of
the society had viewed the film at
Sundance in January.
Although the film society
arranged for Lang's event in early
March, the issue has just come to a
head this week.
"We've been operating under
the assumption that we could trans
fer funds from one category to an
other." ( hang said.
When a budget category is al
ready included in the budget, it is
an easier task to switch money from
one category to another. "These
budget changes are almost always
approved," Coleman said. "It is an
other process when you didn't plan

for the expense."
Film society'Ttreasurer Niki Bo
rofsky has been working with the
ASSU in trying to find a way to ad
just the budget.
"I've gotten a different answer
from every person there." she said
of her weeklong effort to deter
mine the proper avenues for resolv
ing the issue.
Their problems may continue
after the ASSU decision. Some
ASSU members are not optimistic.
"It would set a precedent if ap
propriations allowed them to trans
fer funds," Freund said. "It would
be a major change."
Lang is required by her contract
to fly business class. Her $7,000
flight is round trip from Sydney to
San Jose.
"Her representative refused to
negotiate," Chang said.
However. Lang is not receiving
any honorarium for speaking at
Stanford, unlike most well-known
speakers. If the ASSU does not
allow the transfer, the money will
have to come from different places.
"Part of the money could come
from our discretionary fund," Bo
rofsky said.
Lang is a young film director
who is making her debut with " The
Well." The film competed at both
the Sundance and the Cannes Film
Festivals.
Iler film will be screened tomor
row at (S p.m. in Cubberley Audito
rium.
