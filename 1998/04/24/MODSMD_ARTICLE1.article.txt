# Screening sees snag
## 'Well' funded 
### James Pritchard Staff writer 
The Stanford Film Society is Hy
ing Australian Sundance Film di
rector Saniantha Lang to campus
so she can introduce the screening
of her film "The Well" tomorrow.
There is a catch: her plane ticket
costs $6,900.20, and the group's
special fee may not cover it.
As Lang hoards the plane in
Sydney for the presentation, the so
ciety is petitioning the ASSIJ Ap
propriations Committee for a line
item transfer in order to pay for the
ticket.
Although the film society has
approximately $11,000 left in their
allocated money from their special
fee awarded last year, it has no cat
egory for travel expenses in its
budget. Its members are attempt
ing to transfer the funds from their
large equipment budget for the
ticket.

Each time a group needs money
from its special fee, it must submit
a request to gain access to the
funds.
During the annual application
for a special fee. the ASSIJ Appro
priations Committee reviews and
sometimes changes the group's
proposed budget. Once the budget
is approved, it is submitted for stu
dent vote.
Students have the chance to see
the special-fee budgets before the
spring election every year in the
Elections Handbook. Because stu
dents vote on a specific budget, it is
difficult to redistribute funds, even
if they are still available.
The committee will review and
vote on the issue by Monday, after
Lang has arrived. It may go before
the ASSIJ Senate at its next meet
ing.
