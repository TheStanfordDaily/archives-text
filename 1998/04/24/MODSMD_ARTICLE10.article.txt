HIV infection rate holds steady
ATLANTA (AP) — Despite a historic drop in
AIDS cases and deaths in the United States in the
last few years, the rate at which people are becom
ing infected with MI V has held relatively steady, the
government said yesterday.
The Centers for Disease Control and Preven
tion said that many people are not heeding warn
ings about unsafe sex and drug use.
"It shows the need for sustained prevention.
What we have seen is that with every generation,
you have to start at the beginning," said Terry
Hammond, a CDC spokeswoman.
Dad allegedly infected son
Doctors were mystified about the source of the
disease. An investigation yielded an "unimagin
able" eause for the boy's illness, according to
police.
They say the boy's father intentionally injected
a syringe full of HIV-tainted blood into his son.
I"he father, Brian T. Stewart, was arraigned on
charges of first-degree assault yesterday. He plead
ed innocent; prosecutors say the charge will be
upgraded to murder if the child dies.
Authorities believe he stole the blood from a St.
Louis hospital, where he worked as a lab aide.
Greed was the alleged motive. Stewart. 31,
wanted to kill his son to avoid paying child support,
police said.
Cloned sheep gives birth
LONDON (AP) — Dolly, the cloned sheep, has
a wee carbon copy of her own — but this one came
into this world the natural way.
Scientists at the Roslin Institute announced yes
terday that a little lamb named Bonnie was born
April 13 in a normal delivery, and that mother and
lamb were doing fine.
"We are delighted." said Graham Bulfield,
director of the institute, which made history in
February IW7 when it announced it had cloned
Dolly from an adult sheep.
Bonnie's father is a Welsh mountain ram, and
her genetic makeup is different from Dolly's.
Is Jerry Springer a sham??!!
CHICAGO (AP) — All of a sudden, it's Jerry
Springer who's taking the hits, not the guests on his
fists-flving talk show.
Rolling Stone magazine and a I"V entertain
ment show are reporting that the fights are about as
real as a pro wrestling match, a charge the show
denies.
And the NBC station that brought Springer to
the big leagues has scraped the show off the bottom
of its corporate shoes amid rising criticism that it
has degenerated into a pornographic slugfest.
Yesterday, the syndicated show "Extra" was
scheduled to air a report saying that many of
Springer's fights are staged and guests are coached.
On Friday, Rolling Stone hits the newsstands
with similar allegations.
