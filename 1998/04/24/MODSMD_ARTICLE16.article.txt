## Editorial Welcome, pro fros 
### 
Here's why you should
decide to join Stanford's
Class of 2002

FIRST OF ALL. congratulations.
Only 13 percent of applicants to
Stanford — the lowest in Llni
versity history — were mailed that
magic package earlier this month. As
one of 2,455 prospective freshmen from
all over the country and the world, you
have a wonderful opportunity before
you.
. Of course., you. have to make the.huK
decision first. Hiat'Y \Vtiv, we assurric\
many of you came to Visit the Farm this r
weekend. We know you're going to
have a great time as pro fros (please do
not use the title "Stanford Admit
Weekender") but we also know that
some of you are still weighing your
options.
Here's why you should go to Stan
ford.
• The weather: Don't say you
haven't noticed. It's beautiful here.
Sure, there's always the possibility of
some rain — we were hit especially
hard by you-know-who this year — and
the temperature sometimes falls into
the s()s. But at least we can guarantee
that you will never have to trudge to
class in snow. (Try to get that kind of
promise from the Yale Daily News.)
And for those of you who appreciate
the occasional snowflake, no worries —
Tahoe and all the snow you could want
are just a few hours away. And the
beach is just a short trip in the other
direction. Start thinking about dorm
trips next year.
• The people: Iliey're nice. Stanford
students are all extremely intelligent,
but most of us are also down-to-earth
and relaxed. We like to work, but we
like to have fun. too. It's all part of the
Stanford experience. And although we
all study hard. Stanford doesn't suffer
from the cutthroat competitive envi

ronment that you find at some other
schools.
• The location: We're in California,
for pete's sake. OK, some of you East
Coasters might be a bit skittish about
things like earthquakes, floods and
fires, but you can't argue with the state
ment that it's the most exciting state in
the Union.
Stanford is less than an hour away
from San Francisco, a city that everyone
should at least agree is ... interesting.
Don't forget you can catch a train up to
the City at a station right near campus.
Plus, we're far enoguh away from
Berkeley to be safe from catching that
-weenie disease.
Mbre generally, Stanford's Califor
nia location places it on the edge of the
most dynamic area in the world — the
Pacific Rim. Believe us. the world is
changing fast, and Stanford is poised to
move right along with it. Don't even try
to argue that New Jersey is where the
action is nowadays.
• Campus life: To provide a common
freshman experience you'll spend your
first year in a dorm, but after that you'll
have a myriad of options: the Greek
system, small houses and co-ops. suites
and, if you want, more dorms. There's
always something to do on the Farm,
ranging from sporting events to all
campus parties to hanging out at the Co
Ho (ask a student what that means).
Plus, Stanford's campus is safe — what
other school has bicycle theft as the
most common crime?
The only thing East Coast schools
have on us is age and tradition. If you
want to live in dilapidated dorms at a
school that brags about the fact that it
produced 10 presidents, go for it. But if
you want to be part of a tradition of
great academics combined with stellar
athletic (we are on our way to surpass
ing the record six NCAA titles won last
year) and extracurricular activities,
check yes and mail in that letter to
Dean Kinnally today. Better yet, go to
Old Union and deliver it in person.
You won't regret it.
