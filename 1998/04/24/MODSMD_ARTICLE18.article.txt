## Initiation to life on the Farm

YOU MAY BE
one of the lucky
13 percent accept-
I ed this year, young
112 prospective freshman, hut
you have not made it yet.
This weekend is the stu-
J dent approval portion of

your admission process,
and if we don't like you, you don't get in.
We have a comprehensive battery of tests
you must endure and scenarios to which
you must correctly respond.
Do not be scared, just mildly concerned.
Fail one part of our examination, and it's
off to UC-Berkeley you go with the other
rejects. Since I would not send even my
worst enemy to C'al, 1 am giving you some
sample scenarios and questions that you
should prepare for as you attempt to make
it through this weekend alive.
Sample Scenario 1. All pro fros should
be prepared to be handed a busli bike (an
unlocked bicycle typically found in the
shrubbery, with one Hat tire and missing
pedal or some other important feature) and
accompany their hosts on a ride between
the Clock Tower and the Ouad to visit a 10
a.m. class. Apparently, this scenario was
not used my freshman or sophomore years,
because half of the people here have vet to
figure out that you steer your bike away
from oncoming obstacles instead of
towardsthem.
Sample Scenario 2. Using your handy
pro fro packet, locate Synergy on your
campus map. Go to Synergy, retrieve a

clean plate from the kitchen and return it to
your (in the annoying spirit of Stanford "o"
abbreviations) pro fro ho.
Sample Scenario 3. (For females) Many
Stanford females claim they cannot leave
the Sigma Chi fraternity house without
being sexually harassed. Prove that this
claim is correct by entering the Sigma Chi
house, ask a fine young gentleman what the
best part of Stanford is and tape record
your conversation.
Sample Scenario 4. (For males) Many
Stanford males claim they can urinate from
the top of Hoover Tower and make it into
the fountain below. Prove that this claim is
incorrect, using trial-and-error with you
and your new pro fro buddies as test sub
jects.
Sample Scenario 5. Attend a CIV lec
ture. Stay awake.
Sample Scenario 6. Learn the campus
layout by decrappifying Stanford â€” also
known as taking down any leftover cam
paign posters.
Sample Question 1. Who is the most
respected person on the Stanford campus?
a) Gerhard Casper b) Sigourney Weaver c)
Leland Stanford d) Jerry Springer
Sample Question 2. Where is the most
likely place on campus to get Hepatitis A?
a) a bathroom floor at the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity house b) Wilbur Dining
Hall c) a delivery order from Pizza-a-Go-
Go. Hint: it's not the SAE bathroom floor.
Sample Question 3. Stanford has: a) too
many a cappella groups on campus b) way
too many a cappella groups on campus c)

so many a cappella groups that i! you hear
one more cover of Lisa Lisa's "Lost in
Emotion," you will have to gouge your ears
out with a dining service spoon.
Sample Question 4. Complete this sen
tence. According to a survey cited to make
Drew Barrymore think we were all like
horny and stuff when she came to speak to
us last quarter, 72 percent of all Stanford
students are sexually active a) with others
b) with themselves c) with the breadboard
that slides out of a modular desk.
Sample Question 5. True or false. When
it comes to consulting students and faculty
about housing, Stanford makes an extra
effort to find out what each group wants.
Sample Question 6. When an unidenti
fied man flashes you a badge and tells you
to get in the back of his car for a quick strip
search, you should a) run away b) kick him
in the crotch and run away c) say, "Hello,
Eric Abrams. Welcome back to Stanford,
you big cheeky monkey."
I wish you the best of luck on your
examination. My freshman year, we set up
a mock crystal meth lab in the Alondra
third- floor study room to see what the pro
fros would do. so be prepared for anything.
Make sure you ask for a guided tour of the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest, Alpha Sig and
a Lagunita Court freshman double. These
are the places the University is most proud
of.

Casey Ketterling is a junior majoring in
computer science. Given a choice of any
school, he would choose Stanford again.
