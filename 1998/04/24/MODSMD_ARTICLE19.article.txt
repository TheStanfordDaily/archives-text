Remember the Armenian
Genocide of 1915
On April 24. over 4(X) Armenian
scholars, educators, doctors, clergy, mem
bers of the Turkish parliament and other
community leaders were detained and exe
cuted by Ottoman Turkish Police.
This event marked the beginning of the
Armenian Genocide, an orchestrated plan of
extermination carried out against the Chris
tian Armenian population of the Ottoman
Empire that lasted until 11>23.l l >23. Approximate
ly 1.5 million Armenians perished and more
than 85 percent of the Armenian population
of the Ottoman Empire disappeared as a
result of murder or forced migration.
Under the guise of World War I.the
Ottoman Turkish regime decided to rid itself

of its Armenian citizens, who were predomi
nantly indigenous residents of ancient
Armenian villayets in Eastern Turkey. Much
like the Jews of Nazi Germany, Armenians
who comprised an ethnic and religious
minority in the Ottoman Empire command
ed a majority of its wealth, while being offi
cially relegated as "second-class citi/.ens."
Conjuring hysteria of rebellion associated
with the war. the Turkish government
embarked on an ambitious series of policies
aimed at obliterating the Armenian people.
They masked the genocide of the Armenians
by calling the procedure a "relocation."
1 fowever. regardless of any euphemistic title
assigned, the Armenians were subjected to
systematic extermination as mandated by
()ttoman Turkish governmental and military
orders. For 1.5 million Armenians, the trail
of official telegrams and memoranda outlin

ing the methodology of the Armenian (ieno
cide meant rape, forced marches through the
Syrian desert, summary execution and mass
graves.
Today, 83 years after the genocide, the
Turkish government refuses to acknowledge
its involvement in this catastrophe. Although
countless newspaper articles and headlines
exposed the atrocity throughout Europe and
the I Jnited States, the Turkish government
has cynically relied on its political power,
wealth and the natural death of genocide
survivors to embark upon yet another and
final step in the process of genocide: the revi
sion of history itself. My selectively denying
genocide scholars access to historical
archives in Turkey, while funding academic
chairs as platforms for historical revisionism
at many prestigious American universities,
the Turkish government today is denying its

own history — one that chronicles an
abysmal human rights record against Arme
nians. Kurds, Greeks, Cypriots and lurks.
Although many U.S. states, including
California, have adopted resolutions recog
nizing the genocide of the Armenians of
1915, the powerful Turkish lobby in Wash
ington. D.C. has been able to successfully
deny history and passage of a similar resolu
tion in Congress. Placing priority of politics
over truth is a sad commentary on our
national government and of humanity itself.
More important, it is a dangerous sign for
future would-be perpetrators of genocide. In
fact, Adolf Hitler is quoted as saying. "Who
today remembers the Armenians?" in ratio
nalizing the Jewish Holocaust.
Genocide begets genocide. Its denial
offends justice and makes the event almost
permissible. Denial of genocide disrespects

those it martyred, victimizes its survivors and
pardons its perpetrators. Recognizing that
we are all united by the common bond of
academic inquiry and excellence, we ask that
you take some time to learn about the
Armenian Genocide of 1915 and consider
how we can prevent history from repeating
itself in the next crime against humanity.
