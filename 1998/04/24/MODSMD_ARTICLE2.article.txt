# Rate of bicycle theft dropping
## 
### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
Students no longer have to live in
fear that their bikes may not be
where they left them after class. On a
campus where there are more than
15,(XK) bikes, the incidence of bike
theft has dropped dramatically.
The Stanford Police reports that
bicycle thefts have declined steadily
in the past several years. In 1W5,545
bikes were stolen, whereas in 19%
and IW7. 3K4 and 317 bikes were
stolen, respectively. This decrease is
attributed to efforts by Stanford Po
lice to prevent thefts and the imple
mentation of education programs
aimed at teaching students to be
more careful with their bikes.
"1 think it's a combination of
things," said Stanford Police Chief
Marv Harrington. " There's been a
pretty steady decline. We conducted

some stakeouts and caught a few
people who I suspect had been re
sponsible for multiple thefts."
Moth I larrington and Bicycle Pro
gram Manager John Ciccarelli attrib
uted the decrease in theft primarily
to the improvement; of bike racks and
the increased security measures stu
dents have taken. The new racks,
provided by Facilities Operations in
most areas of White Plaza and the
Ound. allow riders to more easily
lock their tire and frame to the rack
itself. Housing and Dining Services is
also gradually increasing the number
of these racks in front of residences,
but they function on a more restrict
ed budget than Facilities Operations.
The other element affecting bike
theft is educational programming
provided for incoming freshmen
about how to care for their bikes. ITie
programs advise students to buy U
shaped locks, to lock their bikes to a
rack and to bring a cheaper bike here.
"I think that the majority of stu
dents are more aware," I larrington
said. "[U-Locks] are the norm now."

Sadaranganey and Tom Saberhagcn,
three students in the Graduate

School of Business, recently complet
ed a study aimed at determining the
statistical correlation between an in
crease of quality bike racks, educa
tion and a decrease in campus thefts.
"The education programs institut
ed in these years may have been a key
contributing factor to the reduction
of bike thefts," the report concluded.
'The increase in the number of se
cure spaces has historically been
strongly correlated with a decrease in
the bicycle theft rate."
