Ji I dcrcr, you'll get in." Stanford
has a 13 percent admissions
rate this year, and I have a wonderful
younger brother on the waiting list. Given
these factors, I assume that most of the
admits here this weekend were confronted
with a more strenuous entrance require
ment than lack of known participation in
first degree murder. But, according to
Darren Marble, this was the offer present
ed to him by an assistant Stanford track
coach.
Darren, a star high school high jumper
who was heavily recruited all over the
country for his high jumping ability, is not
here this weekend. He is not here despite
the constant reassurance by the coach that
he "had never had one of his recruits
rejected."
He is the victim of a coaches' bidding
war in which athletes are not seen as stu
dents with academic futures at stake, but
as interchangeable commodities.
The Stanford track coach's courtship of
Darren began last summer, when he visit
ed Darren at home for more than an hour.
Throughout the fall and winter, the coach
continued to make overtures. He offered
Darren a 99.9 percent probability of
admission to Stanford — "unless you are

an ax murderer." Darren is not an ax mur
derer. He is, nonetheless, going to UCLA.
Darren is academically qualified to
attend Stanford. With high grades and a
1340 on his SA T, he has been granted
admission to the University of Pennsylva
nia, UCLA and UC-Berkeley based on
academic merits alone. Hut, according to
Stanford's famous contention, grades and
scores are not enough. Every admitted
applicant must have some sparkle, some
passion, something else.
Darren also has that something else. I le
has it so much that he attracted Princeton
and Duke to offer him a 100 percent guar
anteed admission if he had accepted the
coaches' offers by the early deadlines.
What Darren has, along with nine years
of playing the piano, is a 6-foot-10 high
jump. This leap is more than ample to pro
pel him over the head of any member of
the Stanford faculty. At the moment, this
must seem a fairly bittersweet consolation
prize.
Darren had well-defined reasons for
choosing Stanford over the other schools.
He hoped to concentrate his studies in
Stanford's strong biology and genetics
programs. He loved the balmy weather
and ambiance of the Bay Area. He wanted
an academic challenge, and he highly

admired the track team. Still, with such
lucrative opportunities elsewhere, a rejec
tion from Stanford might not seem cause
for much lament. The problem is with the
recruitment process.
There is, first of all. the question of
deadlines. The University of Pennsylvania
track coach called Darren in mid Decem
ber to inform him that Stanford was mak
ing overtures to the No. 1 junior high
jumper in the world. II that young man
chose to attend Stanford, he would take
Darren's spot on the team. Darren did not
ignore this warning. He called Stanford,
where he was again assuaged by the coach.
He declined the University of Pennsylva
nia's offer.
The Princeton coach called Darren to
offer him a guaranteed spot, but gave him
only until the beginning of March to
decide. Darren called the Stanford coach
for confirmation. Stick with us, he was
told. He declined Princeton s offer.
The Duke coach called, and he, too,
offered Darren a guaranteed place at the
school. Duke was Darren's second choice.
Worried, he called the Stanford coach
AGAIN. There is a 99.9 percent chance
you will get in, he was reassured. He
declined the offer by Duke.
But at the Stanford Invitational in mid-

March. Darren was suddenly confronted
with conflicting information. "I hope,"
said the Stanford coach, "that you have a
second choice." Darren had had a second
choice — Duke — hut he had rejected it in
favor of his first choice.
Along with the question of deadlines,
there is another disturbing element in
Darren's recruitment process — the aca
demic advice he received from the Stan
lord coach. When Darren asked the coach
whether he should retake the SAT to try
to improve his scores, the coach told him
not to bother.
When he asked the coach whether he
should take Calculus BC or AB: Physics
AP or regular science; English AF or film
analysis, he was consistently discouraged
from taking the harder classes.
Largely as a result of following this
advice, Darren did not gain entrance to
the honors programs at the University of
California.
There is a chorus of critics, to which I
often lend my voice, which is irritated, if
not enraged, by the fact that star athletes
are often admitted to prestigious universi
ties without being sufficiently qualified
academically. While Stanford does claim
to maintain high academic standards for
recruits, it also cares a great deal about

NCAA championships. An occasional
nudge from a key coach can help the
admissions department he slightly more
flexible with top-seeded high school ath
letes.
Athletes can benefit from the admis
sions game. Hut it is the universities,
coaches and sponsors who ultimately dic
tate the rules and reap the big profits. Dar
ren is an excellent student. He played by
the rules because he wanted an excellent
education. If he had not been manipulat
ed. misled and abandoned, there would be
no story here. That Stanford has wait-hst
ed my passionate younger brother bothers
ine as well, but I cannot write a story about
injustice when no rules were broken, no
blaring indiscretion exercised. Jon was not
flirted with, teased and then dumped at
the last minute. Darren was.
Someone owes Darren Marble an apol
ogy and an explanation. An offer ol
admission would also be appropriate
although at this point I doubt very much
that he would accept. It is fairly unpleas
ant. after all. to have an upstanding insti
tution spit in the face of your academic
integrity.
