Though the Card managed a split
against the Tigers, Stanford batters
continued to struggle at the plate.
Stanford batters had only two hits
off of Tiger ace Brandee McArthur
(11-8).
"McArthur is a good pitcher, but
our hitters are good enough that we
should have been able to get the job
done a little better than we did," said
junior Michele Acosta.
Tiger freshman Adrienne Rata
jczak led off the bottom of the first
with a home run, the first of her ca
reer. to give the Tigers the only run
it would need to win the first game I -
0.
In the night cap, Stanford's bat
ters continued to have trouble with

Tiger pitching. But Tiger batters
didn't have problems getting things
started against Stanford pitching, as
they jumped to a 2-0 lead in the bot
tom of the second inning.
Stanford finally rallied in the bot
tom of the sixth to get four runs and
Uike a 4-2 lead. .1 unior Kelly V ablon
ski hit in junior Marcy Crouch to
score the first run for Stanford.
Stanford benefited from two un
timely errors by Tiger Ratajkczak,
scoring three unearned runs to take
a 4-2 lead that was enough for the
victory. On the mound, junior
Becky Blevins struck out four while
allowing four hits and two runs in
earning the win for Stanford and im
proving her record to 17-7.
"It was definitely a little disap
pointing splitting against Pacific,"
said Stanford head coach John
Rittman. "However, Pacific is a for
midable team. I was happy that we
we're able to bounce like we have
before to salvage the second game."
This weekend Stanford faces two
of its toughest Pac-10 opponents,
No. 4 Washington (36-7. 11-3) on
Saturday and UCLA (13-18. 3-9).
The Card was swept by the I luskies
earlier in the season at Washington,
but swept the Bruins in their three
meetings this season.
There is a reason the Huskies
have been ranked in the top 5 all sea
son long. They, like Arizona, have
everything desirable in a ball club.
