### John Sullivan Staff writer 
After busting into the top 10 soft
ball rankings for the first time in its
history. No. 9 Stanford split a dou
bleheader 0-1, 4-2 against Pacific
(21-17) on Wednesday to bring its
season record to 30-13,8-8 in the Pa
cific 10 Conference.

SOFTBALL
■ Saturday: No. 9 Stanford (30-13,8-
8 Pacific 10 Conference) vs. No. 4
Washington (36-7.11-3) at the Stan
ford Softball Complex, 1 p.m.
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. UCLA (13-
18, 3-9) at the Stanford Softball
Complex, I p.m.

Though the Card managed a split
against the Tigers, Stanford batters
continued to struggle at the plate.
Stanford batters had only two hits
off of Tiger ace Brandee McArthur
(11-8).
"McArthur is a good pitcher, but
our hitters are good enough that we
should have been able to get the job
done a little better than we did," said
junior Michele Acosta.
Tiger freshman Adrienne Rata
jczak led off the bottom of the first
with a home run, the first of her ca
reer. to give the Tigers the only run
it would need to win the first game I -
0.
In the night cap, Stanford's bat
ters continued to have trouble with

Tiger pitching. But Tiger batters
didn't have problems getting things
started against Stanford pitching, as
they jumped to a 2-0 lead in the bot
tom of the second inning.
Stanford finally rallied in the bot
tom of the sixth to get four runs and
Uike a 4-2 lead. .1 unior Kelly V ablon
ski hit in junior Marcy Crouch to
score the first run for Stanford.
Stanford benefited from two un
timely errors by Tiger Ratajkczak,
scoring three unearned runs to take
a 4-2 lead that was enough for the
victory. On the mound, junior
Becky Blevins struck out four while
allowing four hits and two runs in
earning the win for Stanford and im
proving her record to 17-7.
"It was definitely a little disap
pointing splitting against Pacific,"
said Stanford head coach John
Rittman. "However, Pacific is a for
midable team. I was happy that we
we're able to bounce like we have
before to salvage the second game."
This weekend Stanford faces two
of its toughest Pac-10 opponents,
No. 4 Washington (36-7. 11-3) on
Saturday and UCLA (13-18. 3-9).
The Card was swept by the I luskies
earlier in the season at Washington,
but swept the Bruins in their three
meetings this season.
There is a reason the Huskies
have been ranked in the top 5 all sea
son long. They, like Arizona, have
everything desirable in a ball club.
They have excellent pitching, quali
ty hitting and reliable defense.
The Huskies are currently riding
a 10-game winning streak behind
the solid pitching of two-time Pac-1()
Pitcher of the Week, sophomore
Jennifer Spediacci. In her last three
outings, she has hurled three
shutouts, improving her record for
the season to 15-4 and her ERA to
1.05.
If the Card wants to beat the
Huskies, its sluggish hitting will have
to pick up considerably.
"It seems like we're in a bit of a
rut at the plate lately," Rittman said.
"Hut it's not like we haven't been
facing some very good pitchers.
Also, it's not like we haven't had the
opportunities. We just haven't been
getting the clutch hits that we need.
It seems like every time we hit the
ball hard, we hit it directly at some
one."
Stanford batters will not only
have to hit the ball well against the
Huskies, they will have to find the
holes as well. Washington's defense
has been stingy all season, so Stan
ford will have to pound the ball if it

wants to neuter the Huskies.
"As a team, I think we match up
well against Washington," Rittman
said. "The key for us is, as one play
er put it — we have to start winning
the innings, then the game will take
care of itself."
After the Card battles Washing
ton tomorrow, they meet perennial
Pac-10 rival UCLA on Sunday.
Though Stanford has swept the Bru
ins thus far this season, UCLA is a
team that cannot be taken lightly.
Although UCLA is not currently
ranked in the top 25, the Bruins have
beaten several top 25 teams includ
ing then-No. 7 Arizona State, No. 18
Oregon State, No. 22 Kansas and
No. 23 Oregon.
UCLA is led by senior first base
man Kim Wuest, who is batting .402
with 25 RBIs and 11 home runs.
Two other Bruins are batting over
.3(H) as well.
The weak link in the Bruin team
is its pitching. Its two starters are a
combined 11-14, though both boast
ERAs well below 3.00.
While Stanford's hitting has been
cold lately, Michele Acosta still
sports a team-leading .348 batting
average. She also leads the team in
RBIs with 28 and in slugging per
centage at .459.
