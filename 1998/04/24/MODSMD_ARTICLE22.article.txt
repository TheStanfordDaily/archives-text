# NCAA polo hopes go through Stanford
## 
### Brie MacDonald Contributing writer 
It's going to be an intense weekend at
deGuerre pool as the Stanford women's water
polo team hosts the Western Regional (Juali

fiers tournament.
No. 2 Stanford (23-4) will have to contend
with tough competition in the last tournament
before the NCAA Charftftf on ships, but the Car
dinal squad is in a good position to perform well.
"There's obviously an advantage to not hav

ing to travel," said Stanford head coach John
Tanner. "But there are distractions that you
normally associate with being at home. When
you travel, it's easier to concentrate completely
on the competition ... but we'd rather be here."

■ Today Western Regionals at de( iuerre pool.
No. 2 Stanford (23-4) vs. Pacific (2-14). 8 a.m.
■ Today Stanford vs. No. 4 San Diego State (1S
11). 1:50 p.m.

All 10 teams in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation — No. 1 UCLA. Stanford, third
ranked California. No. 4 San Diego State, sixth
ranked USC. No. 7 Hawaii. No. 8 UC-Santa
Barbara, ninth-ranked UC-Davis, San Jose
State, Pacific, and Long Beach State — will
compete this weekend. No. 10 UC-San Diego.
Davis and Washington will also be in atten
dance.
The tournament is organized into four brack
ets; the last bracket contains four teams while
the others contain three. Stanford begins the
weekend today with an 8 a.m. game against
UOP (2-14). After that, the Card has a 1:5() p.m.
game against No. 4 SDSU (18-11).
"We're going to have a really tough game
against San Diego." Tanner said. "1 hey have an
extremely talented, very powerful offensive
team. They're capable of beating anyone."


Freshman Kris Koblik looks to pass the ball earlier this season against No. 3 California. The
second-ranked Card will have to beat the Bears this weekend if it hopes to be the Western
Regional champion.
San Diego State, who beat Stan
ford to take third plaee at last
year's nationals, lost to No. 3 Cal
by a single goal at the MPSF cham
pionships two weeks ago.
"They could be one of the hig
surprises this weekend," Tanner
said.
The winners of each bracket will
go on to compete in the champi
onship semifinals tomorrow. The
second-place teams from each
bracket will play in the consolation
semifinals, which are also tomor
row.
Stanford's team has been hon
ing its skills all season in prepara
tion for the regionals and nation
als. The Card currently holds its
highest rank since the program
began.
"We are continually upgrading
our game," Tanner said. "We need
to be in the top seven [this week
end) to qualify for nationals. Once
we've accomplished that, we just
want to show improvement."
Top-ranked UCLA and No. 3
Cal still pose the biggest threats to

the Cardinal. UCLA has held the
No. 1 position for the entire season,
and they are currently undefeated.
Cal and Stanford split the wins in
their four matches this season. The
outcome of the Western Regionals
will therefore give a strong indica
tion of what to expect at nationals.
At the MPSF championships,
Stanford came within two points of
UCLA in the championship game.
Impressively, the Cardinal defense
managed to keep the Bruins from
scoring at all in the second half.
After steadily improving with each
game against UCLA, the Stanford
women are poised and ready to de
liver the top team its first loss.
"I think we can win." said junior
Lindsey Welsh. "We just have to
give them something they don't ex
pect so they lose their composure."
As long as Stanford plays con
sistently this weekend, the team
should have two chances — at re
gionals and at nationals — to fulfill
its goal of finally defeating the
Bruins and taking the national
title.
The top seven teams at this
weekend's tournament will travel
to USC for the NCAA Champi
onships next weekend.
