### Brie MacDonald Contributing writer 
It's going to be an intense weekend at
deGuerre pool as the Stanford women's water
polo team hosts the Western Regional (Juali

fiers tournament.
No. 2 Stanford (23-4) will have to contend
with tough competition in the last tournament
before the NCAA Charftftf on ships, but the Car
dinal squad is in a good position to perform well.
"There's obviously an advantage to not hav

ing to travel," said Stanford head coach John
Tanner. "But there are distractions that you
normally associate with being at home. When
you travel, it's easier to concentrate completely
on the competition ... but we'd rather be here."
