The youthful Stanford women's
golf team headed to the Pacific 10
Conference Championships ex
pecting to gain some much-needed
experience — and that is just what
it got.
Unfortunately, a three-day clin
ic by the University of Arizona and
a disappointing sixth-place finish
was not exactly the experience the
Cardinal was looking for.

ual tournament, which was held at

live individual finishers. USC fin
ished third at 899, while crosstown

"We were obviously a little dis
appointed with our finish," said
Stanford head coach Caroline
O'Connor. "We had hoped to play

better this week. Hut we are an ex
tremely young team, and this was
our first championship tourna
ment."
Despite the frustrating team
finish, the Cardinal posted several
impressive individual perfor
mances. led by freshman phenom
Hilary 1 iomeyer, who finished sev
enth.
"I played really well all week."
Homeyer said. "I hit my irons the
best I have ever hit them in my life.
Unfortunately my short game,
which is normally my strength,
didn't really come through — oth
erwise. I could have scored even
better. But if you had told me be
fore the tournament that I would
finish seventh. I would have been
happy."
Freshman Stephanie Keever
also maintained the high level of
success she has enjoyed through
out her inaugural season, finishing
in 13th place.
"I am obviously happy with my
finish in the tournament," Keever
said. "However, my ball-striking
was erratic all week. On the first
day, 1 hit the ball great and
couldn't make any putts. The last
two days, my ball striking wasn't
nearly as good, but I found my put
ter. hung in there and scored pret
ty well."
Arizona junior Jenna Daniels
took the individual crown with a
three-day total of 215. despite
shooting a 78 on the final day.
