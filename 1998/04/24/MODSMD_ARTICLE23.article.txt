### Will Flemming Contributing writer 
The youthful Stanford women's
golf team headed to the Pacific 10
Conference Championships ex
pecting to gain some much-needed
experience — and that is just what
it got.
Unfortunately, a three-day clin
ic by the University of Arizona and
a disappointing sixth-place finish
was not exactly the experience the
Cardinal was looking for.

WOMEN'S GOLF
■ Yesterday's result: Stanford fin
ishes 6th at Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.

The Wildcats won the team title
by a whopping IS shots with a
three-day total of one-over-par
865. Arizona players also claimed
the top three spots in the individ
ual tournament, which was held at
the Tijeras Creek Golf Club (par
72, 6120 yards) in Rancho Santa
Margarita. Calif.
Arizona State was the Cats'
nearest challenger at SHI. and two
Sun Devils rounded out the top
live individual finishers. USC fin
ished third at 899, while crosstown
rival UCLA took fourth at 916.
Washington came in fifth with a
total of 917, three strokes ahead of
Stanford.
"We were obviously a little dis
appointed with our finish," said
Stanford head coach Caroline
O'Connor. "We had hoped to play

better this week. Hut we are an ex
tremely young team, and this was
our first championship tourna
ment."
Despite the frustrating team
finish, the Cardinal posted several
impressive individual perfor
mances. led by freshman phenom
Hilary 1 iomeyer, who finished sev
enth.
"I played really well all week."
Homeyer said. "I hit my irons the
best I have ever hit them in my life.
Unfortunately my short game,
which is normally my strength,
didn't really come through — oth
erwise. I could have scored even
better. But if you had told me be
fore the tournament that I would
finish seventh. I would have been
happy."
Freshman Stephanie Keever
also maintained the high level of
success she has enjoyed through
out her inaugural season, finishing
in 13th place.
"I am obviously happy with my
finish in the tournament," Keever
said. "However, my ball-striking
was erratic all week. On the first
day, 1 hit the ball great and
couldn't make any putts. The last
two days, my ball striking wasn't
nearly as good, but I found my put
ter. hung in there and scored pret
ty well."
Arizona junior Jenna Daniels
took the individual crown with a
three-day total of 215. despite
shooting a 78 on the final day.
Daniels became the third Arizona

Championships.
woman to win the Pac-10 title,
joining junior teammate Marisa
Baena, who won it in 1996 and cur
rent LPGA star Annika Soren
stam, the 1992 champion.
Following the tournament, the
Pac-10 released its all-conference
teams, giving Stanford fans some
thing to cheer about. Homeyer
was named first team all-confer
ence, while Keever and sopho
more Jae Jean Ko made the sec
ond team. Sophomore Julie Dunn
completed the Cardinal represen
tation. receiving honorable men
tion accolades.
Many members of the Stanford
team feel that these individual ac
complishments prove that the
team has enough talent to com
pete later in the postseason, and
that this week's poor performance
does not predict its future.
" This tournament won't affect
our status in the region," O'Con
nor said. "If you look at our results
over the year, we have only fin
ished out of the top four in two of
the nine tournaments we have en
tered. Four of our five girls re
ceived conference honors — so we
can't be discouraged as we head
into the NCAA tournament."
The Cardinal hopes to learn
from Pac-lOs and regain its top
form for the NCAA West Region
als, which will be held May 7-9, on
the Stanford Golf Course.
Tijeras Creek "was a tough golf
course, and it tuned everyone up
for our last two events," Keever
said. "We all hope to come togeth
er when we need to. This week was
just a wake-up call — we now see
that we are going to have to work
harder than ever before."
As it has all season long, the
Cardinal is focusing on next
month's NCAA Championships,
and views all prior tournaments as
mere warmups.
"This is not a terribly bad time
to play below our expectations,"
Homeyer said. "Our scores just
didn't all click this week, but we
can deal with that. We would
much rather play our best golf in a
month at NCAAs."
