FOOTBALL
■ Saturday: Cardinal and White
spring football game at Stanford Sta
dium, 1 p.m.

Stanford returns six starters on
offense and three on defense from
a team that finished last season 5-6
overall and 3-5 in the Pacific 10
Conference.
Gone from last season's team
are 20 lettermen. including five
NFL draft picks defensive end
Kailee W <>ng. fullback Jon Ritchie,
outside linebacker Chris Draft, de
fensive tackle Carl Hansen and
outside linebacker Jon Haskins.
Some of last season's notable
wins included victories over tradi
tional football powerhouse Notre
Dame as well as California in the

l (H)th Big Game.
I his season's team will be made
up of mainlv underclassmen, with
just six players in their final year of
eligibility
What follows is a position-by
position breakdown of the 1998
Cardinal.
Offense
For the third consecutive year,
lunior quarterback Chad Hutchin
son will miss all of the Cardinal's
spring practices while he pitches
for the top-ranked Cardinal base
ball team. Unfortunately for Stan
ford. Hutchinson's fate is not yet
determined — he may not return to
Stanford in order to pursue a pro
fessional baseball career.
During spring practice, sopho
more Todd Husak and freshman
Rand\ Fasani will lead the Cardi
nal offense in Hutchinson's ab
sence All three will be competent
contenders for the starting or back
up position, depending on
Hutchinson's decision.
Stanford's backfield will enter
next season with limited experi
ence — only one player, sopho
more Juan Carlos-Lacey. has car
ried the ball in a game. Lacey will
face competition for a starting spot
at running back from two redshirt
freshmen, Coy Wire and Eddie
Gayles. At fullback, the Cardinal
faces similar difficulty — only
sophomore Maxwell Stevenson has
game experience and will be ex
pected to start next season.
With the departure of two-year
starting wide receiver Damon
Dunn, the Cardinal is looking to
complement returning junior Troy
Walters. Stanford has many viable
options — sophomores Aaron
Focht. Rossi Jones. Deßonnie Pitts
and Jason Willock. and freshmen
Dave Davis, Jamien McCullum and
Tafiti Uso. The key for the Cardi
nal will be the emergence of one as
a quality player.
Stanford's offensive line will
likely be a strength, returning four
starters and six players who have
W*if>t#niiitaift game time over the
past few seasons. The returning
starters are left tackle Jeff Cron
shagen, left guard Joe Fairchild.

center Mike McLaughlin and right
tackle Geoff Wilson, (iuard An
drew Kroeker and tackle Brian
Donoghue also have starting expe
rience and should bolster Stan
ford's line.
At the tight end position, the
Cardinal is faced with a degree of
inexperience and youth, hut does
have depth to rely on. Sophomore
Russell Stewart started Stanford's
final two games last season and will
face competition from sophomore
Steve Coughlin and freshmen
Austin Lee and Matt Wright.
Defense
With only one of four starters re
turning from last season's defen
sive line, sophomore Willie
Howard, young players must make
immediate impacts. Junior Andrew
Currie is a likely starter at nose
tackle and sophomore Riall John
son will likely he a major role play
er at end. Sophomores Sam Benner
and Dorean Kass and freshmen
Marcus Hoover and Travis Pfeiter
will also compete for time.
Both of Stanford's inside line
backer positions were'krtt Incnnt
following last season, but capable
reserves should be able to fill the
voids. Juniors Sharcus Steen and

Marc Stockbauer are likely candi
dates. Junior outside linebacker
Donnie Spragan returns as a starter
and junior Brian loner will likely
see playing time as Spragan s back
up.
The Cardinal returns just one
starting defensive hack in junior
Chris Johnson, hut several experi
enced non-starters also return
Sophomore Frank Primus shared
time with Johnson last season and ju
nior free safety I im Smith is expect
ed to return next season from a knee
injury. Sophomore Than Merrill, i
backup strong safety last season, re
ceived extensive playing time and r
expected to make an impact.
Special Teams
Senior Kevin Miller is back fo
his fourth season as Stanford"
punter and his third as placekicker
The Cardinal may utili/e junioi
Patrick Shinnefield or freshmar
Mike Biselli as a placekicker tc
allow Miller to concentrate on
punting.
Today marks Stanford's final
spring practice. The Cardinal will
follow upits \ 4 practices with the an
nual Cardinal and White spring
scrimmage tomorrow at 1 p.m. at
Stanford Stadium
