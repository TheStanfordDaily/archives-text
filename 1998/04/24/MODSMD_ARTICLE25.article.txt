It has been the only bright spot in Cali
fornia's season thus lar.
And it has also been the biggest blem
ish in Stanford's.
The scene was set two weeks ago as the
Golden Bears shocked the ("ardinal on
April 10 with a 4-3 upset at Sunken Dia
mond.
With runners on the corners and no
one out in the top of the ninth. Cal sopho
more Curtis Johnson lined a 1-2 pitch into
right field to score senior Aaron Gordnier
with the eventual winning run.
Golden Bear freshman left-hander
Jason Dennis then wrapped up the first
complete game of his career by retiring the
Cardinal in order in the bottom of the
ninth.
As a result. Cardinal junior ace Jeff
Austin suffered through the first loss of his
otherwise stellar season and watched as
his ERA skyrocketed from 1.80 to 2.76
with a follow-up loss at Arizona State.
The Cardinal ultimately took two of

three in the series by scores of 7-3 and 13
7. but the memory of the loss lingered.
