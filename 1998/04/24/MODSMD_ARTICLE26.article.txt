### Gabby Duno Contributing writer 
After last weekend's victories,
the Stanford men s rugby team (11-
5) has advanced to the Final Four.
A win in mud and rain over Vir
ginia Tech last Saturday and a win
against a physical Air Force Sun
day gave the Cardinal a berth in the
Final Four.
"I"his weekend, the Cardinal will
attempt to accomplish something
that they have not been able to do in
three straight trips to the Final Four:
win a national championship.
At San Francisco's Boxer Stadi
um in Balboa Park, Stanford begins
its quest for the championship to
morrow.
Stanford goes into this match as
the third seed and the Pacific Coast
runner-up. ITie Pacific Coast Cham
pionship went to California. The
Card will meet a tough Indiana team
that beat Truman State 31-22 to ad
vance to the Final Four.

Last year, Indiana finished
among the top lbteams in the nation.
This year, it makes its first ever ap
pearance in the Final Four as the sec
ond seed and the Midwest Confer
ence champions.

MENS RUGBY
■ Saturday: f inal lour at Boxer Sta
dium in Balboa Park. ( alii. Stanford
vs. Indiana.

Interestingly. Indiana is coached
by a former Stanford rugby player.
Trevor Brown, who played four
years under head coach Franck
Boivert, was captain of Stanford's
rugby squad during the 1992-93 sea
son.
In the other semifinal match, top
seeded Cal takes on the 12-seed and
Middle Atlantic Conference cham
pion Navy. Defending national
champion Cal swamped Dartmouth
70-0 en route to the Final Four. Navy
posted a victory over IJC Davis 46-6
to make their first appearance in the

Final Four since 1995.
In the last two tries. Stanford has
not been able to make it past the
semifinal round. This year, the team
is hoping to make it to the champi
onship finals.
"We have been training hard all
season for this." said senior Tom
Efird. "we haven't been able to
make it to the finals in the last two
years, hut this year we are gunning
for it."
Despite key injuries to four
starters (one-third of the starting
team), the Cardinal managed to
reach the Final Four — the goal the
team had set earlier in the season.
Now. the expectatii >ns are even high
er.
"It was beyond my personal ex
pectation to reach the Final Four
with all the setbacks that we had in
the last weeks." Boivert said.
"Now. the team goal is to win it all.
lo do so they will have to fight with
the courage and humility they had
last weekend."
