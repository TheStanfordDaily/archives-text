## Lambs to the barber Country music and the new conscience 
### 
Leon Newspigot

A shocking discovery is electrify
ing the fields of music and philoso
phy. On April 17, meaning was found
in country music. In a Brent Mitchell
Band song, played on KOKC from
Devil's Laundromat, Ariz., the follow
ing lyrics were found:
I gotta ex-wife in prison. Got one in
Santa Fe.
1 ain t seen my wife in Dallas ever
since she ran away.
I've tried to live for love and I've
tried to live to hate.
I tried to give my life to Jesus, but
the devil sealed my fate.
So / wandered into Mexico to seek a
little grace.
But all I saw was hunger same as
mine on every face.
A young man tried to rob me there,
I stabbed him with mv knife.

Then 1 saw with shame and sorrow 1
had taken a child's life.
The default of Being itself is express
ly, if unknowingly, misplaced in its
default by the nature of metaphysi
cal thinking, as thinking in values,
whereby the very misplacing does
not know itself as such. The nothing
of Being itself is sealed in the inter
pretation of Being as value. It
belongs to this sealing that it under
stand itself as the new "yes" to
beings as such in the sense of the will
to power, that it understands itself as
the overcoming of nihilism.
I found a bottle of tequila and a
whore
I drank and puked and then I fell on
the floor. . .

Country music fans are celebrat
ing in the streets. One of them
remarked to me, "See, I told you that
all our music wasn't simply insipid
lyrics linked together by out-of-tune
guitars! Country music has MEAN
ING!"
For a long time, I thought that
country-western music was merely
some degenerates with rotten teeth
plucking their banjos and singing
about their degenerate lives.
But this recent finding seems to
incontrovertibly suggest that coun
try-western music can also provide
the foundation for Heidegger's meta
physical suppositions.
I always thought that there was
nothing in country music but whiny
pedantism, but I see that I am wrong.
Nestled subtly within those panegyric
elegies for the lost West, there can be

found a bridge to a fundamentally
new conception of the autonomous
individual actor.
Like most great art, country
music is something that you have to
work through and toward to find the
delicately hidden meanings within
the texts.
To me, this has really opened the
floodgates, I mean, what else have I
misjudged? Over the weekend I did a
close textual critical analysis of my
Micheal Crichton and John Grisham
novels.
Nothing to report so far.
But I am going to read the ingre
dients of Gummi Bears tomorrow to
see if there is something there.
Critics claim that this restate
ment of Nietzschean ethos is merely
an accident, a mere coincidence, sim
ply the product of a thousand mon-

keys with a thousand typewriters.
"Given enough country songs,"
said Davido Bucolico, "probability
insists that one country song would
contain the seeds of hermeneutical
understanding. But it's only a statis
tical accident."
Some people say it's a hoax, some
people blame flouridation in our
water system, but I think that our eli
tist educational system has finally
broken open into a state of epistemic
egalatarianism.
The eloquent production of a
(post)modern thought system seems
to me to be the product of a thinking
human being and not merely the
stepchild of a rodeo clown.

This is me writing drunk. Good enough
