Students and faculty discussed
the lingering devastation of
Nicaragua from the U.S.-supported
Contra War and international aid
etlorts at a meeting at the 1 laas Cen
ter for Public Service Wednesday
night.
During spring break. Seth New
ton. a freshman and co-coordinator
of Students for Environmental Ac
tion at Stanford, went to Nicaragua
with a delegation from Witness for
Peace, a national organization that
looks at how I J.S. policy affects Cen
tral America. They claim that cur
rent policy "supports death, de
struction and poverty" instead of
"peace, equality and self-deter
mined development."
According to the United Na
tions. Nicaragua is the poorest eoun
tr\ in Latin America. Newton's del
egation experienced this poverty
firsthand when they stayed with
families in the rural community of
El Aguacate. Each day, after help
ing water the dirt floor, they would
help with community-established
projects such as reforestation and
educational programs.
" I he j( >y and sorrow of Aguacate
was very visible in the children."
Newton explained. Most of them
had never seen Americans before
and followed them everywhere.
One boy named Omar was always
around Newton.
One day Omar said he was hun
gry and asked for food. Newton
asked why he didn't go home and
eat dinner. Omar replied that there
was no food at the house. His par
ents were working as housekeepers
in another town. They had left four
children alone with no food for five
days.
Newton became very close to his
host family and the children of the
community in the week he stayed
there. His delegation also met with
community leaders in Managua, the
nation's capital. They met with or

ganizations struggling to protect
Nicaragua's environment from cor
porations that currently log the
largest tropical rain forest in Central
America, lobby for debt forgiveness
and social services for the poor, and
initiate community development
projects throughout the country.
Many of Nicaragua's current
problems stem from a$ 12 billion na
tional debt incurred during the Con
tra War. In 1979, a revolution
brought the socialist Sandanistas to
power. The U.S. government re
sponded by organizing and funding
a counterrevolution and economic
blockade. The war ended in 1990
when the Sandanistas lost a national
election.
In order to obtain aid and loans
from the World Bank to repay this
debt, the Nicaraguan government
had to institute structural adjust
ment programs. This included cut
ting "key social services like educa
tion and health care," Newton said.
Assoc. Drama and Classics Prof.
Rush Rehm visited Nicaragua 11
years ago and found it in different
circumstances. " There was a lot of
hope," Rehm said. "They had a suc
cessful revolution, and there was
free health care for the first time."
Then the war came and seven peo
ple in Rehm's host town were killed
in the first week. "The U.S. killed
that hope in a horrible way," Rehm
said.
Stanford students have the op
portunity to attend the 14th annual
Nicaragua-U.S. Delegation and
Colloquium on Health this sum
mer. From Aug. 8 to Aug. 18. mem
bers of the Committee for Health
Rights in the Americas will study
and experience Nicaragua's current
political and economic situation,
history and culture. "We want to let
you see how bad things are, and
what people are doing abut the situ
ation," said Mike Martinez, a recent
Stanford graduate. Interested stu
dents can email chria@igc.org or
