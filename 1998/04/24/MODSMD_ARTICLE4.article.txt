## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
Nearly UK) people gathered in
White Plaza yesterday to march in
support of diversity of the Stanford
faculty.
Organized by the Student Coali
tion to Tenure Karen Sawislak, the
rally drew undergraduates, gradu
ate students and faculty members.
Dressed in black and carrying pick
et signs, the group marched from
White Plaza to Building 10 in an at
tempt to get an audience with Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice.
Outside their office. Assistant to
the President Jacqueline Wender
said Casper and Rice weren't in and
had no comment, draw ing an angry
response from the protesters.
"Don't you think it's a blatant
act of disrespect for them not to be
here?" asked freshman Shaumo
Sadhukhan.
Senior Cindy I'rquide/ suggest
ed the president and provost were
afraid to face the crowd.
"How silly of us to expect that
the administration would actually
listen to us." she said. "We're too
many people of color. We're too
many people with loud voices. And
we scare them off."
Wender did accept a list of de
mands from the group, promising
to pass them on to her superiors.
The "call for action" requested sig
nificant changes in the tenure
process. including forming an ex
ternal review committee to investi
gate the University's record in

these issues; creating a committee
to explore tenure process reform:
re-evaluat i ng the grievance
process; and holding an open forum
on Stanford's affirmative action
policy.
The University's current tenure
policy is "unbecoming to an institu
tion that claims to he part of the de
mocratic fabric of this country,"
said hivtorx doctoral student ( huck
Carlson, an organizer of both the
coalition and the rally.
Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs
Robert Weisberg called the de
mands "extraordinary" and said
Stanford would "continue to follow
the general process by which tenure
is in the hands of a faculty struc
ture."
W ithin those parameters, Weis
berg said. Stanford will become
more balanced in terms of gender
and race.
"We're confident that the cur
rent structure can improve the di
versity of the faculty so long as we
continue to work hard at it." he
said, adding that part of the May 14
Faculty Senate meeting will be de
voted to a report on the status of
women faculty.
But in light of the denial of
tenure to three women and one mi
nority man in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences during the
past year, the status quo may not be
enough, protesters said

arc in high demand by Stanford stu
dents, but their advising hours often
are taken up in tenure fights,
Urquidez said.
The fact that such a protest was
needed also relates to a lack of vigi
lance on the part of faculty and staff
members hired 10 or 20 years ago,
said History Prof. Estellc Freed
man, director of the Feminist Stud
ies Program.
When she first came to Stanford,
she and many others were the first
women or minorities in their de

partments. she said, and that hasn't
changed for many.
Stanford has failed to attain
more gender equity in those
decades for complex reasons, she
said, urging students to watch for
"subtle kinds of bias that affect all
of us" and work for change.
Such change must come from a
broader coalition of students, Carl
son emphasized.
Students from a variety of
groups must "see how we can work
to change the University's poli
cies," he said, "so we don't fight
these tenure battles one by one —
in which case 1 think we'll always
lose."
