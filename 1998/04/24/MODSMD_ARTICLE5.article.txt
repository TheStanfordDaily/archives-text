# Multilinguists speak on different levels
## 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
The ability to speak, think and
dream in many languages is a skill
that not many Americans are able
to achieve in a lifetime.
At Stanford, however, a small
community of the student body is
capable of communication on a va
riety of different levels.
For senior Tudor Havriliuc, a
native of Bucharest. Romania, lan
guages are anything but foreign.
"There is a French saving that

with every language you know, an
other life you gain." Havriliuc said,
a speaker of two Romanian di
alects. Italian. French, Latin and
some German. He is now learning
Spanish.
He has been able to gain many
lives indeed.
Travel, something very impor
tant to him and his family, rarely
presents a language barrier. If it
does, he improvises.
"I remember using a combina
tion of French and Italian to try to
talk to someone in Spanish. It's re

allv not that difficult, especially
knowing Latin as well." he said.
Havriliuc added that he enjoys
being able to read literature in the
original form, as there are many
stylistic nuances that are lost in
content-based translation.
Many multilinguists will agree
that there are often concepts that
exist only in one language and can
not be translated.
Senior Melvina Cheung ac
knowledged that "there are some
expressions that can only be ex
pressed in Cantonese, like reac

tions and things vou feel, that are
very hard to translate."
Cheung, a native of Australia,
speaks English. Cantonese and
French. She is mm learning Man
darin
"English is ver\ direct." she
said. "In Chinese languages this
structure is different so people
would never say 1 don't like that.'
It would be a lot more subtle."
"There are definitely concepts
that exist only in one language."
