# Multilinguists speak on different levels
## 
### Sasha Polonsky Contributing writer 
The ability to speak, think and
dream in many languages is a skill
that not many Americans are able
to achieve in a lifetime.
At Stanford, however, a small
community of the student body is
capable of communication on a va
riety of different levels.
For senior Tudor Havriliuc, a
native of Bucharest. Romania, lan
guages are anything but foreign.
"There is a French saving that

with every language you know, an
other life you gain." Havriliuc said,
a speaker of two Romanian di
alects. Italian. French, Latin and
some German. He is now learning
Spanish.
He has been able to gain many
lives indeed.
Travel, something very impor
tant to him and his family, rarely
presents a language barrier. If it
does, he improvises.
"I remember using a combina
tion of French and Italian to try to
talk to someone in Spanish. It's re

allv not that difficult, especially
knowing Latin as well." he said.
Havriliuc added that he enjoys
being able to read literature in the
original form, as there are many
stylistic nuances that are lost in
content-based translation.
Many multilinguists will agree
that there are often concepts that
exist only in one language and can
not be translated.
Senior Melvina Cheung ac
knowledged that "there are some
expressions that can only be ex
pressed in Cantonese, like reac

tions and things vou feel, that are
very hard to translate."
Cheung, a native of Australia,
speaks English. Cantonese and
French. She is mm learning Man
darin
"English is ver\ direct." she
said. "In Chinese languages this
structure is different so people
would never say 1 don't like that.'
It would be a lot more subtle."
"There are definitely concepts
that exist only in one language."
Havriliuc added. "There's a word
in Romanian, for example, that
you can't translate — it's a combi
nation of missing and loving some
one, and it doesn't exist in Eng
lish."
Havriliuc admitted that many
words tend to surface in English
while he is talking to his mother in
Romanian. Once saying it.he real
izes that his parents won't under
stand it.
Junior Ayse Gurkok, a native of
Turkey, agreed that different lan
guages have many untranslatable
concepts and ideas.
"For me. it was difficult in com
ing to Stanford and realizing that 1
was not as fluent [in English] as 1
thought," she said. "It occurred to
me that I need all three languages
to make one complete expanse of
thought."
Gurkok is a native speaker of
Turkish, English and German and
has studied French for many years.
"My family speaks all three all
the time," she said. "We'll never
have a conversation where we

don't constantly switch back and
forth, and we don't even notice
we're doing it," she said.
Just like children in Switzerland
who grow up between borders and
are required to learn three or four
languages, Gurkok acknowledges
that while she communicates effec
tively in many languages, she is not
fluent in any one language.
"1 thought it was a disadvantage
when 1 first came to Stanford. I re
alized I didn't really have perfect
English to fall back on. But now I
think it really serves me well to
have partial fluency in many lan
guages instead of complete fluency
in just one," she said.
A civil and environmental engi
neering major, Gurkok admitted
that absolute fluency for her career
will not be essential.
Gurkok and Havriliuc both
agreed that learning the meaning
and expressions of many idiomatic
phrases in English has taken time.
"When I first came here, people
would make references to some
thing like Who's the Boss?' and I
felt like an outsider for not under
standing," Havriliuc said. "But
now 1 feel like it's those cultural
idiosyncrasies that are the best en

richment."
Havriliuc said he watched a lot
of Television initially because it re
ally helps with the accent. "It's very
interesting how your mind works,"
he added.
He said that without thinking,
he will switch from a Romanian
conversation with his mother to an
English one with his friends.
Cheung pointed to cultural ex
perience as the best teacher, com
menting that you have to make
mistakes to be able to gain fluency
in a foreign language.
"I remember staying with a host
family in France, when after the
meal I said. 'No more please, I'm
full.' "
"I didn't realize that a direct
translation into French meant
telling her, 'No thanks, I'm preg
nant.' "
According to Cheung, people in
France were shocked to see an
Asian, non-Vietnamese person
speak the language fluently.
"Speaking the language and
making an effort means that you
are curious about their culture,"
she added.
"People become really warm
when they see you're making an ef

fort," Cheung said.
Cheung speaks from double ex
perience — she had also spent time
in Bosnia on a humanitarian aid
mission.
When she arrived, she spoke no
more than a few words in Bosnian
but was determined to communi
cate once she got there.
"I really struggled in trying to
learn it from a textbook," she said.
"But I wanted so desperately to
speak to my hosts once I got there
that it made it much easier to
learn."
Perhaps all multilinguists would
agree that once you own several
languages, the barriers that pre
vent access to others are lessened.
Travel becomes less touristy and
more authentic.
"It's important to me and my
family to travel a lot," Havriliuc
said.
"I'm living in San Francisco
next year, but after that 1 definitely
want to try Italy for a while."
And the prospect of living
abroad is a fully plausible possibili
ty, Havriliuc said.
"Every time you learn a new
language, you in a sense are gain
ing a new life."
