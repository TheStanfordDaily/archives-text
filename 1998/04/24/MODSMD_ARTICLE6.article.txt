## 
### Jason Engleman Contributing writer 
Fight thousand books are being returned
to the Stanford libraries each week, accord
ing to Asst. I University Librarian for Techni
cal Services Catherine Tierney.
In order to minimize the time the regular
library staff has to spend on the extra hassle
of dealing with flood-damaged books, the li
brary has hired temporary staff.
Even though the El Nino flood waters
have receded, many of the damaged Stan
lord librars books are still in the free/e-drv
ing process. Luckily, because of a prepared
library staff and modern technology, most
books will be saved.
"We were prepared." Tierney said. "The
University library preservation staff is
trained for emergencies."
With an estimated 7().(KH) wet books. the
I Iniversit\ has contracted with a firm. Docu
ment Reproccssor. to complete the immense
process of drying and cleaning the Hood
drenched books.
"The books have just started coming
back." Tierney said. "And by and large
we're getting back clean and flat books."
According to Tierney. other libraries
around the countrv are "astonished that we

got 70.0(H) books into a freezer in 36 hours.
At Document Reprocessors. metal plates
separate each book from the others and spe
cial bungee cords help stop the books from
swelling.
The books are then placed in a vacuum
chamber where the atmospheric pressure is
reduced, and heat is applied for seven to 10
days.
Afterward, the books are allowed to re
absorb normal moisture from the air for a
week.
Finally, the Document Re processor staff
will sort the completed books as either
"Ready for the Shelf." "Total Loss." or
"Processing Required" in order to "facilitate
speedy return to our shelves." Tierney said.
Eighty percent of the books are expected
to be ready to go directly to the shelves. Two
to 5 percent of the books are probably dam
aged beyond repair. The remaining 15 to 18
percent still need "processing"; meaning
that some need new call number labels, com
mercial binding, page repairs, page cleaning,
unsticking of pages and new bar-codes.
While she is hoping for the best. Tierney
is anticipating problems with the wet 19th
and 20th-century Slavic and Hebrew books.
Their unique type of paper is not expected to
respond well to water.
