## Senate approves education changes 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) — An
education savings hill that swelled
to include a han on federal read
ing and math tests along with an
attack on federal spending for
schools cleared the Senate by a 56-
43 vote yesterday after hitter floor
debate.
Supporters had promoted the
savings bill as a modest way to
help working and poor families
meet school expenses and if neces
sary find alternatives to dangerous
or substandard public schools.
Opponents described it as a
vehicle for tax breaks to help
affluent parents send children to
private schools.
Before the vote, conservative
Republicans had added amend
ments effectively blocking new
federal tests to measure individual
math and reading achievement
and converting some federal
school programs to grants.
And they had rejected adminis
tration proposals to use federal
dollars to reduce class sizes by
subsidizing school construction
and forgiving student loans for
new teachers or create new after
school programs.
"What this means is the death
of public education," said Demo
cratic Leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota.
He denounced the bill as
extreme.
"You're seeing the real Repub
lican agenda coming out on this

bill." Daschle told reporters.
"It took them a couple of days
to vent it, but it's coming out right
now."
Republicans depicted the bill
as a way to restore control of edu
cation where it belongs — with
parents, school boards and states
— and to rattle an establishment
that lets student achievement fall
while enriching bureaucrats.
"What we have here is a choice
between the status quo and people
who want to empower parents to
have more of a role in the educa
tion of their children," said Sen.
Judd Gregg, R-N.H.
"There is a sufficient amount of
good in this bill," said Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla.
President Clinton for now has
pledged a veto.
The savings bill, co-sponsored
by Sens. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.,
and Robert Torricelli. D-N.J.,
would allow tax-free savings
accounts to be created for chil
dren. starting at birth.
l)p to $2,()(M) a year could be
contributed, with money coming
from relatives, employers, founda
tions or other sources.
The interest and withdrawals
would be tax-free, and the money
could be used for a range of
expenses from kindergarten
through college, including tuition
at private or religious schools.
The bill is estimated to cost
$1.6 billion over 10 vears.
