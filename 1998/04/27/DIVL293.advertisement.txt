Part Time Lab Work
Looking for EE students to help in part-time lab work.
Tasks involve measuring components from our new IC
process and curve-fitting models using Pspice. We
also need help in characterizing new analog IC's
as they arrive over the months. Excellent lab and
modeling experience and summer jobs will be
available. We will accommodate your schedule
as much as we can during the school year.
