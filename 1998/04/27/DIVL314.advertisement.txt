As you're no doubt well
aware, stress is a part of
university life: exams, competi
tion, relationships, finances, and
difficult decisions can literally
make vou sick. Researchers now
have hard data confirming the
negative influence of stress on the
body. Yet many people still don't
notice the connection between
unrelenting tension and feeling
achy or sick.
Stress/Relax Response
We have two build-in mecha
nisms to protect our health: the
stress response and its antidote,
the relaxation response. Our stress
response kicks in automatically
when we feel threatened. I he
heart speeds up, breathing
becomes faster and more shallow
(to take in more oxygen), blood
pressure rises, and we're ready for
"fight or flight."
This survival mechanism is
great for short-term emergen
cies, like being chased by a bear.
But it's harmful when triggered
and sustained by anticipated
fears. It leads to physiological
changes that affect your immune
system, sleep, and digestion, and
can lead to serious problems.
But when the relaxation response
is invoked, heart rate slows,
muscles relax, and breathing
deepens and slows. Relaxation
reduces anxiety, fear, muscle
tension, pain, healing time, and
sleep problems. It strengthens the
immune system, and enables you
to renew yourself in the midst of
continuous change.

Learning to Relax
Many of us who manage our
outside lives skillfully are often
clueless when it comes to
knowing what our own bodies
need. We have to learn how to
relax. Here are some tips:
Observe how your mind and
body respond to events (notice
when you tense up; when you
relax)
Make tension-release a habit:
do neck rolls, ga/.e at the skv,
stretch muscles, and take deep
breaths anytime, anywhere
When under stress, repeat to
yourself: "calm body, clear
mind"
Take up an activity to balance
your academic life: trv a mar
tial art, ceramics, calligraphy,
taiko, wrestling, quilting,
singing,
Take a hot bath or get a
massage
Plan something fun
Watch a TV comedy or funny
video
Get absorbed in a game
Have lunch with a friend or
go to the movies
While driving, play soothing
Alternate activities: do vigor
ous exercise after concentrated
study; do laundry after
challenging classes
Relaxation Techniques
Physical Exercise: Whether it's a
65 mile bike ride or a quick walk
around the building, exercise is
a proven method of tension
release.
Muscle Relaxation: Tense each
group of muscles for 10 seconds,
then suddenly release them.
Notice the difference.
IMeditation: Vou stop everything
to quietly reach a "still point."
1 lere the mind is calm and clearly
aware, stress is let go, and both
mind and body relax.
Yoga: This discipline involves
breathing and holding certain
positions.
Affirmations: Repetition of
positive expressions such as "I
will do well."
Self-hypnosis : You relax and
focus your own mind on a
relevant topic.
Imagery: Concentration on an
image
Visualization: You "see" yourself
relaxed, successful, happy,
(whatever).
