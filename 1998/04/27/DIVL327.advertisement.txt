THE CURRENT EVENTS EDUCATIONAL MONTHLY
fflarlnniUfe-ilfriifg" is not just another magazine. It's a unique
new educational tool, a completely fresh approach to studying
current events as they occur here and abroad.
Our research has found that young people, ages 14-84,
like the public in general, often shy away from serious
reading. Therefore we decided if we can't penetrate the
brain of the teenager through the front door of long gray
text, we shall jump in through the window of political
cartooning, and stimulate further study through clever
and quickly understood graphics.
(Eartmitu&iNnufl magazine would like to help guide
people in a more thoughtful manner to an understand
ing of current events. We have on our blue ribbon team
some of the greatest analysts, educators and humor
•s*7 ists in the country, an accomplished group who also
U / understand what a powerful tool a chuckle can be.
/ After all, humor is a very serious business!
