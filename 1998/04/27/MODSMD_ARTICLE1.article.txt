## 
### Jennifer Godwin Contributing writer 
The Historical Society of Stanford of
fered a self-guided tour of historical houses
in the faculty ghetto yesterday, an area
more genteely known as the Lower San
Juan District. The tour was part of a society
project that hopes to document the history
of all of the nearby historic houses within
the next six years.
The 12-house tour featured the hospital
ity of many of the current owners, who
opened their homes and gardens to visitors,
and brief talks by members of the historical
society.
The first house on the tour. 570 Alvara
do Row, was once the far end of the original
Row and is currently the oldest faculty
house on campus. The 10 original houses on
Alvarado extended from the Law School
parking lot to the current site of the Career
Planning and Placement Center and were
fondly called the "Decalogue" by students.
That row of patternbook houses was
joined by the Branner house and the Queen

Anne-style home at 570 Alvarado in 1892.
According to Karen Bartholomew of the
historical society, "The Branner house was
taken down for a parking lot in the '705."
The home at 570 Alvarado still exists and
is now the home of Sidney Drell, a physicist
who helped found the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, and his wile Harriet. The
house boasts the only remaining hitching
post on campus.
Further down Alvarado, the yellow
painted duplex at 612 / 614 features a gigan
tic front-yard redwood. The current resi
dent, Business School professor Jonathan
Bender, said, "We've been told it was plant
ed by Mrs. [Lou Henry] Hoover," the wife
of former U.S. President Herbert Hoover.
Once the Stanford Men's Rest Home,
the house at 637 Alvarado Row is known as
"Allen Manor." named after the first own
ers. Built in 1914, the rambling shingled
house was the province of Mrs. Allen, who
began filling her home with recuperating in
jured or ill students in 1936.
Among the more than 4,(KK) people who
have staved there, the most famous resident

was probably Alexander Kerenskv. head of
the Russian provisional government for
four months in 1917. He was at Stanford in
the late 1950s and early l%()s working on
his memoirs. The backyard features two
cottages named the "Bird Cage" and the
"Squirrel Cage." Inside the wood-paneled
house is a "secret closet." According to
Edwin Bridges, one of the current residents
and professor of education administration
at the School of Education, "Our kids used
to love to hide there."
The 1925 Tudor-style home at 675 Al
varado features courtyard tiles believed to
have been salvaged from the rubble of the
19()6 earthquake, while the Tudor-style
1929 construction at 653 Salvatierra fea
tures Spanish-style wrought-iron detailing.
The Dunn-Bacon house, which will like
ly be sold to the I Jniversity, is one of two re
maining campus residences designed by ar
chitect Charles Hodges, who created the
Ouad. Memorial ( hurch and the Stanford
Museum. Held bv the Dunn and Bacon
