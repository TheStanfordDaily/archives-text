## Editorial Neglected upper class? 
### 
The administration should
continue exploring ways to
meet upperclassmen needs

IN THE PAST several years, the
Stanford Introductory Studies ini
tiative has offered remarkable
opportunities for students in their first
two undergraduate years.
Freshman and sophomore seminars,
as well as sophomore college, have
come to enjoy high demand and broad
popularity. This is not surprising —
such programs allow students to have
direct contact with top faculty in
diverse academic fields and to begin to
explore potential fields of study.
Although we praise the achieve
ments of Stanford Introductory Stud
ies. it is crucial that resources directed
at freshmen and sophomores will not
leave juniors and seniors without a
quality academic experience.
We are pleased to see that the Uni
versity's administrators are engaged in
discussions focusing on services to
upperclassmen. We hope the adminis
tration will aggressively pursue pro
posals that will surface as the result of
these deliberations.
Yet, juniors and seniors also have
unique needs. Although many are
engaged in honors and other research
projects, most are perplexed and wor
ried about their future. To upperclass
men. then, exposure to seasoned facul
ty and other support services is funda
mental for reasons that rarely apply to
freshmen and sophomores.
Our conclusions are hardly new.
Some University programs, such as
honors college, are designed to assist
students with their capstone academic
experiences. Still, as the University is
successfully enhancing its services to

undergraduates in the first two years,
we cannot help but inquire whether
more can be done for upperclassmen.
Encouragingly, we are not alone.
The University's Committee on
Undergraduate Studies is currently
examining honors programs with an
eye to promoting student participation
and improving support for undergrad
uate research. We hope the commit
tee's recommendations will stimulate a
campus-wide conversation about aca
demic services to upperclassmen.
Most importantly a direction for
future improvements should emerge
from both the recommendations and
the subsequent discussions.
The unique needs of juniors and
seniors are also discussed in the report
of the Task Force on Residential Pro
grams and Student Housing for
Undergraduates. After noting that stu
dents have different needs at different
points in their Stanford careers, the
report suggests that "residential pro
gramming and academic support ser
vices ... must be tailored to relate
directly to the needs of students at
each phase of their undergraduate
life."
The Residential Programs Imple
mentation Group is currently working
on translating the task forces' recom
mendations into policy. As the multi
year implementation process contin
ues, we anticipate some enhancements
that deal directly with upperclass liv
ing.
We are pleased that the administra
tion has come to recognize the com
plexity of the undergraduate experi
ence and to differentiate its unique
stages. Its approach to meeting the
needs of first- and second-year stu
dents has certainly been excellent.
Now. we urge the University to help
juniors and seniors with as much — if
not more — vigilance.
