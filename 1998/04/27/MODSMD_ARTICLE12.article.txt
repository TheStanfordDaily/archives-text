Keep Ohlone Field green
I recently attended the Earth Day Cere
mony on Ohlone Field. As a member of the
Stanford community since 1960, I feel an
affinity with the beautiful open spaces that
Sen. Stanford's legacy has made possible.
Watching the sunrise as I stood near a
great bay tree that surely was a landmark in
Ohlone Field long before Sen. Stanford's
time, I realized that Stanford University has
many other pieces of land that would be
better for the kind of development that has
been planned for Ohlone Field.
Therefore. I urge the University to find
an appropriate alternative site. Let's keep
Ohlone Field an open space with its great
meadow reaching to the creek and its bike
and pedestrian access to Menlo Park.
I hope other members of the Stanford
community, both longtime and recent, will
join me in asking the University to recon
sider its decision to build on Ohlone Field.

Babbitt was ill-informed
In the first sentence of T.J. Babbitt's col
umn last Thursday on the ASSU presiden
tial race, he accused Matt Spence of accept
ing $1,500 for producing the course guide.
This a complete lie propagated by a student
spending the quarter half way around the
world in Berlin.
Matt did not receive a penny for produc
ing the course guide. On Friday, The Daily
printed a small correction, which I doubt
anyone saw. stating that Babbitt's informa
tion was false.
It is a shame that the editors at The Daily
allowed this lie to be published in the first
place. I am not surprised by the column,
however, since Matt and Bianca have been
plagued by false accusations and malicious
lies. These attacks are a calculated attempt
to destroy the reputations of two students
who have worked extremely hard on many
issues and have refused to participate in the
campaign rumor mill.

I am interested in the identity of Mr.
Babbitt's anonymous "friend" who has
"followed the ASSU closely." I'm aston
ished that Mr. Babbitt, who seems to
search for the facts and care about the
issues, places so much credence in this ill
informed individual. "She" criticized Matt
for the actions of the ASSU for the last two
years — despite the fact that Matt has only
been in the ASSU for one year, while it is
Maren Norton who is the ultimate two
year insider.
If anything, Bianca is the only outsider in
the race, the one who has the ability to
bring innovative ideas to an ASSU plagued
by inaction. If Mr. Babbitt really wants
change, why doesn't he find someone with
no ASSU experience whatsoever?
Instead of Mr. Babbitt's calculated slan
der, it seems to me that more credibility
should be given to the selection of The
Daily editorial board. The board spent mul
tiple hours interviewing all of the candi
dates — unlike Mr. Babbitt, who takes
advice from anonymous, uniformed indi

viduals with obvious political agendas.

Stop character attacks
In light of comments made by members
of the Stanford community and rumors
regarding the candidates in the runoff elec
tion, I would like to offer another perspec
tive. One never thinks that politics can
degenerate into something ugly, especially
in an environment that prides itself in its
intellectual ability and compassion.
However, this ASSU presidential race
has degenerated into something that we, as
students, should feel rather embarrassed
about. The accusations and attacks regard
ing the candidates are often unfounded.
Perhaps The Daily, as the "media" on
campus, should be free to print the opinions
and ideas of individuals. However, The
Daily has the responsibility to check ALL.

of the facts or claims of its columnists. Here,
as editors, you have failed.
T.J. Babbitt's claims regarding Matt
Spence, especially with respect to the
course guide, were false and entirely unfair.
I am disappointed that The Daily failed to
verify the facts. This irresponsibility has
succeeded in harming an individual's repu
tation and has done a disservice to students.
The Daily should not involve itself in
such petty untruths. Discuss the issues,
don't validate false rumors. The candidates
are attempting to come out of these elec
tions with their integrity intact. Perhaps The
Daily should try to follow suit.
