## The 						final overlooked minority 
### 
A FRIEND OF
mine took a class
last year about
artistic exchange across the
Atlantic Ocean. On the
first day of class, the pro
fessor asked: "How many
of you have NOT been to
France?" A minority of

people, including my friend, raised their
hands.
My friend was surprised that so many
people had traveled to Europe, and dis
turbed that the professor had assumed that
her students had been to France. While this
may be a fair assumption at Stanford, I can't
imagine the same scene taking place at the
average American university.
Stanford boasts about its diversity and
makes honest attempts at gender parity and
minority representation, though only at the
undergraduate level. While we may have a
diversity of skin colors, middle- and upper -
class people are grossly overrepresented.
Approximately 70 percent of undergrad
uate students receive some form of financial
aid. However, the majority of these students
receive limited funding, and only a tiny
number come from lower and working
class families.
A student body with this economic pro
file promotes middle- and upper- class sta
tus as normal. Not only is this inaccurate,
but also alienating for students who cannot
relate to middle / upper-class values and
experiences.
For example, take the perennial winter

quarter dorm ski trip. Many middle / upper
class people at Stanford learned to ski as
children on trips with their parents. They
have their own skis and hit the slopes sever
al times a year. A minority have never been
skiing and don't have hundreds of dollars
for skiing equipment, snowboards, gam
bling, drinks, warm clothes and lift tickets.
They might not even be able to spare money
to eat out, after paying their high board bill.
We forget that these people are present on
campus.
Another example: some of my friends
traveled to Thailand, Ivory Coast and
France for spring break. Of course they got
cheap tickets, but not everyone can afford
airfare, room, food and other expenses. A
friend of mine could not afford a flight to
Los Angeles, so he took the bus instead.
Others had to stay in the area to work and
pay off their bills — they did not have the
luxury of international travel or laying on
the beach.
While small in number, there are stu
dents whose families are or were migrant
workers or unemployed, and others have
been homeless, bankrupt or on welfare.
Some students who cannot afford campus
housing live in East Palo Alto. Those who
struggle to make a living are not only the
parents of kids we tutor, but also the parents
of peers with whom we share our campus.
A large number of Stanford students are
wealthy. Many come from middle- and
upper-class communities or schools. Last
year, an informal survey of people in one
economics class found the average family

income* to be $150,000. compared to the
national average of $24.(XX>. Many people
don't recognize this disparity and assume
that all undergraduates come from wealth)
economic backgrounds.
Those who are born into wealthy families
need not feel guilty about their privilege,
but they must recognize it and be aware of
the ramifications it has.
In our capitalist culture, most people
desire wealth and the status it provides. II
you drive a jalopy without windows, you
might resent students who own Mercedes
and BMWs. In my hometown, people
shopped at the G AF lor nice clothes, where
as at the Stanford Shopping Center, it is one
of the cheapest stores.
Being responsible and aware is not
enough. Stanford needs to pay more atten
tion to class, especially in the admissions
process. Wealthy people can afford private
schools, tutors, SAT prep courses, athletic
equipment and travel opportunities. Col
lege admissions is an inherently classed pro
cess, and we need to demand closer atten
tion to the issue.
Unlike race and gender, class is not
always easy to discern from physical
appearance. Next time a friend refuses to
go out for a nice meal, has never been wine
tasting or can't afford all the required
course textbooks, think about the assump
tions you have made. And challenge your
self and others.
