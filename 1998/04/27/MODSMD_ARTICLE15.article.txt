## Alda Leu So much for responsive class presidents 
### 
DEAR SENIOR CLASS presi
dent.
As (i representative of student interests,
yon should be in formed tluit the cost of the
senior formal is absolutely outrageous.
Consider that over half of the under
graduate population is on financial aid.
Weigh that with the already high costs of
being a graduating senior (senior gift, cap
and gown, fancy picture frame . .. and the
Other costs of the form id — dress / tux, din
ner, pictures, drinks, etc.) and you've got an
event that is severely over-priced, given the
average student's financial constraints.
I realize that you've all probably
worked really hard on this event, and it was
one that many seniors were looking for
ward to. Hut because it's so costly, I have til
least eight friends who are not going. A
closer, more inexpensive venue would be a
viable option.
What you've done is put together an
event that people who have money will go
to — and those people are likely the ones
who have had plenty of opportunities to go
to formats in the past. These are people

who can afford to pay the dues of a sorori
ty or fraternity and attend those formal
dances.
Why don't you do the rest of us a favor
and make this last event for seniors one that
everyone can go to? We'll experience
enough elitism out in the real world without
help from our own class presidents.
I sent this e-mail last week to the four
senior class presidents — Laudan
Nabi/adeh, Preston Sprenkle, Shannon
Waggoner and Clinton Starghill — to
protest the $40 per head ticket price for
the senior class formal. Not one of the four
deigned my e-mail worthy of a response.
Another friend also sent an e-mail to com
plain about the high cost. She too was
ignored.
So much for responsive government.
One senior class president confessed to
a Daily staffer this year that he ran for the
presidency to get into a better med school.
What this class president admitted is sim
ply what other ASSII and class council
members have tacitly subscribed to for
quite some time. At least he had the balls
to tell the truth.

My first questions when 1 heard about
the cost were: "Forty dollars per couple?
Is it on a boat? Is dinner included?"
1 laving been shot down at each of these
attempts to reconcile the exorbitant cost. I
decided to write to the people in charge
and complain. The cost was especially
shocking considering that last year's junior
formal was free.
The event is being held at the Sir Fran
cis Drake Hotel in San Francisco's Union
Square. Sir Francis Drake is a historic
192K landmark hotel and is likely a very
nice place to have a dance. Rut I find it
somewhat troubling that since its 1993
purchase by hotel and restaurant magnate
Rill Kimpton. demonstrators have regular
ly staked out its entrance. Apparently, 2(H)
union employees were fired before Kimp
ton would buy the hotel.
While being on financial aid does not
mean that a student is impoverished, it
does indicate that at least some of those
students will have a hard time paying sev
eral hundred dollars for a few hours of fun
and dancing with friends.
1 don't know what upsets me more, that
the senior class presidents have put

together a series of subsidized pub nights
which are populated by the same crowds
and which exclude non-drinkers lrom the
subsidy, or that they don't even deem con
crete concerns worthy of response.
Although I am sure that our class pres
idents must be extremely busy with med
school and I-banking interviews, any reply
would have been acceptable — from "At
this point our hands are tied." to "Forty
dollars is already pretty cheap considering
the total cost."
But instead of making excuses for
them, I'm simply posing the questions in
an open forum.
What is most distressing is that our class
presidents chose to act without polling stu
dent preferences. Problems get attention
at Stanford generally when it's too late to
do anything about them — Alpha Sig.
tenure, student government ....
At some point, us "common" students
hear about what's going on and then take
action if we care enough. It may be a let
ter. It may be an e-mail. It may be a phone
call or a protest / rally. Whatever it is.
chances are that it's ignored unless there is
public humiliation at stake.

When the problem resides with the
administration, its response, if we get one
at all, will be the formation of a useless
committee.
The embarrassing megaphone antics of
the now defunct Students Monitoring
Organizations on Campus (SMOC) were
rewarded by committee meetings.
Sometimes the problems get "dis
cussed" without an official committee for
mation. Alpha Sig residents got the privi
lege of chatting with Jane Camarillo after
the decision was made regarding its house.
Maybe the power to decide without
consultation causes our student body lead
ers to be infected with the same callous
ness as the administrators. After all. being
in the ASSU makes you larger than life.
Many of us consider Stanford's annual
student council election season to be a
campus-wide nuisance. Perhaps this is
because it really doesn't matter what we
think anvwav.
