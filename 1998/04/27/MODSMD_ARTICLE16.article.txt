### Bobby Blunt Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team is one step closer to its goal of
winning the Western Women's
Lacrosse League championship.
The Cardinal (10-5. 9-0 WWLL)
advanced to the final four tourna
ment in San Diego next weekend
with a convincing 19-4 win against
Santa Clara yesterday at Maloney
Field.
WOMEN'S LACROSSE
â–  Sunday: Stanford 19, Santa Clara 4
Stanford and UC-Davis qualify for
the Western Women's Lacrosse
League final four next weekend.
Stanford "is not ranked No. I for
nothing," said Santa Clara specta
tor Susan Bland. "They're good.
Our players told us they knew that
they were going to school."
The Cardinal hosted the six
team Northern Division regional

playoff of the WWLL over the
weekend. Stanford was seeded No.
1, California No. 2 and UC-Davis
third. Rounding out the field were
Santa Clara, St. Mary's and UC-
Santa Cruz. Of the six teams, only
two could advance to the final four.
The first round was played Sat
urday. Both Stanford and Cal were
awarded a bye as the top teams.
Davis soundly defeated the Ba
nana Slugs 19-1, which gave the
Aggies the opportunity to play Cal
yesterday. Santa Clara beat St.
Mary's 9-6 and therefore had the
right to play Stanford.
The first of the regional finals
yesterday found Stanford leading
the Broncos 14-3 at the half Stan
ford was clearly the stronger team
and kept the Broncos from having
possession of the ball.
The Cardinal allowed the Bron
cos to move the ball into its half of
the field six times in the second
half. Every time Santa Clara
threatened with an attack, the Car
dinal forced a turnover and re

gained possession.
Sophomore attacker Hedy Born
led the charge for Stanford with six
goals. Born showed her usual effort
by scoring several goals after slash
ing through the defense to get off
her shot.
Also keeping up the Cardinal's
quick pace were senior attacker
Dara Kaplan with three goals and
freshman center Katharine Barnes
with three goals and two assists.
Sophomore Gaby Duno and
freshmen Kate Reilly and Chrissy
Wayne also scored two goals
apiece. Junior captain Carey Jones
also added a point for Stanford.
"We are peaking at absolutely
the right time," said Stanford head
coach Heidi Connor.
In the second regional final
game, Davis upset second-seeded
Cal in order to advance to the final
four next weekend. Both of these
teams lost close games to Stanford
earlier this season, allowing the


Sophomore Danielle Lurie runs into a crowd yesterday at the Western Regional tournament at New Mal
oney Field. There, the Cardinal made short work of the Santa Clara Broncos and earned a trip to San
Diego for the national tournament.
Cardinal to avoid facing either of
them this weekend.
"It looks good for next week
end," Connor said. "We have a
great shot of going to the final
game. We keep adding things each
week into our game and we are
coming together very well."
Stanford goes into the final four
as the No. I seed from the North
ern Division,and Davis is the No. 2
northern seed. Stanford will face
the Southern Division No. 2 seed,
while the Aggies draw the top
southern seed.
The winners will play the cham
pionship game Sunday. The South
ern Division teams are traditional
ly not as powerful, and therefore
there is a real chance that the Car
dinal will end up playing Davis
again Sunday for the WWLI. title.
