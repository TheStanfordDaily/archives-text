game, Estes scored the first goal of
the game on a six on five opportuni
ty. The Bruins (31-1) answered with
three goals, two from Catharine von
Schwarz and one from Coralie Sim
mons. Despite numerous man-up
situations, the Card was unable to
convert any scoring opportunities
into goals until the fourth quarter.
After a scoreless second quarter,
UCLA's Robin Beauregard scored
two goals in the third, one on a 4-
meter penalty shot.
In the final period, the Card ral
lied back, outscoring the Bruins 3-2,
but Stanford still fell 7-4.
"We didn't play that well in the
last game," Estes said. "In the next
two weeks [before nationals] we're
going to be working on what we're
doing wrong in the first half because
we're not attacking and we're play

ing ten) casually."
One of the biggest problems in
the final game was that, despite nu
merous six-on-five opportunities,
neither team was able to capitalize.
Stanford only scored on three of
IJC'LA's 13 ejections. The Cardinal
ended up with seven ejections, and
the Bruins scored twice as a result.
"We really need to work on our
six on fives, both on the defensive
and offensive ends," Best said.
Stanford's defense was strong
throughout most of the weekend. Ju
nior goalie Heather Crary played
consistently well, tallying 10 saves in
the final game alone.
"We did a gtxnJ job on defense,"
Best said. "We were denying the
hole-set and passes off of fouls on the
perimeter."
UCLA, Cal, Hawaii (27-10), San
Diego State, USC (20-14) and UC-
Davis (17-15) qualified for nationals,
along with Stanford, two Midwest
teams and three Eastern squads.
