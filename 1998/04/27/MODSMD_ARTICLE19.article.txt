"1 have no idea, to he honest."
said sophomore catcher Damien
Alvarado.
Yet this past weekend, tn a mir
ror image of the cross Bay rivalry
series two weeks before, the Hears
once again defied expectations.
The younger Cal squad put a

tough challenge to the Cardinal
veterans, who barely secured a 4-3
Friday victory at Sunken Dia
mond. took a 10-2 loss Saturday at
Cal's Evans Diamond and re
turned home yesterday to defeat
the Bears 12-4*
Stanford's come-from-behind
victory yesterday kept the Cardi
nal from falling into a second
place tie in the Six Pac. Instead.
Stanford sits one-half game ahead
of USC (36-14, 19-8) and a full
game ahead of Arizona State (32-
16, IK-8).
Beneath the watchful eyes of a
season-high 2.788 fans at Sunken
Diamond, the Bears struck early
and hard yesterday.
Cal right fielder Aaron Gord
nier drove tn shortstop Xavier
Nady with a line drive up the mid
dle before crossing the plate him
self later in the first inning.
And while the crowd may have
been vociferous, the Cardinal bats
remained uncharacteristically
silent. So silent, in fact, that Cal
freshman pitcher Ryan Atkinson
held the Cardinal to just one hit
through five innings. Atkinson en
tered the game with a 10.68 ERA.
Cardinal junior lefty Brent
Hoard, meanwhile, struggled on
the mound, giving up three runs.
Hoard retired in the fifth to fresh
man right-hander Justin Wayne (fi
ll) after giving up a solo shot to
Nady and extending the Cal lead to
3-0.
Motivated by junior second
baseman Tony Schrager's double
in the sixth, junior center fielder
Jody Gerut drove in the Cardinal
junior with a single. Junior third
baseman Josh Hochgesang was hit
by a pitch, driving in junior catcher
John Salter and cutting the Cal
lead to 3-2.
The final three innings then be
longed to Stanford as the Cardinal
offense exploded and the Cal
bullpen simultaneously imploded.
Five Cardinal runners scored in
the seventh as sophomore left
fielder Edmund Muth. sophomore
designated hitter Jeff Rizzo,
Gerut, senior shortstop Jay Peeci
and Alvarado crossed the plate.
Five more tagged home in the
eighth. Among the eighth-inning
barrage was a spectacular two-run
homer by Muth that careened off
the batting eye beyond the 400-
foot mark in center field.
Stanford fans at Evans Dia
mond on Saturday, however, wit
nessed a debacle as the Cardinal
lost to the Bears for the second
time this year, dropping Stanford
temporarily out of sole possession
of first place.
Led by the pitching of sopho
more right-hander Jon Shirley and
the hitting of Nady, Cal defeated
Stanford 10-2.
Shirley improved his record to
3-4 by out-dueling Stanford junior
Chad Hutchinson. Shirley tossed
seven innings and allowed only
two hits, one run (a solo home run)
and four walks. Nady, who went 2
for 4 on the day, had a key three
run double in the Bears' four-run
third inning.

Hutchinson, meanwhile, fell to
8-3 on the season, pitching six in
nings and giving up six hits, live
runs and six walks while striking
out live. After Hutchinson went
out in the seventh, the Cardinal
went through four relief pitchers
who gave up five runs.
Aside from Nady, Juan Her
nandez, Curtis Johnson and Rob
Meyer tallied two hits apiece for
Cal. Hernandez had a solo home
run in the fourth inning.
Sophomore Brad Steele pitched
the last two innings for Cal, giving
up a solo home run to sophomore
John Gall in the eighth. Gall had
also hit a solo home run off Shirley
in the sixth inning to account for
Stanford's two runs. Muth got the
only other hit for the Cardinal.
"We needed to build from
somewhere, and maybe today's the
day that we get it going," Cal head
coach Bob Milano said after the
game. "We've lost so many games
in the eighth or ninth inning this
year. If we were a high school team
we might be undefeated, but we've
got to play nine."
Friday's Cardinal victory served
as a perfect example for Milano's
gripes.
Muth's RBI single with one out
in the bottom of the ninth inning
led host Stanford to a 4-3 win over
the Bears.

Muth's ninth-inning heroics
made a winner out of Stanford
starter Jeff Austin, who struck out
a career-high 15 en route to a com
plete game five-hitter.
Austin (10-2) admitted, howev
er, that memories of the Cardinal's
4-3 complete game defeat to Cal
on April 10 at Sunken troubled
him late in the game.
"Shades and visions of that
game started haunting me a little
bit," Austin said.
Sophomore Nick Day led off
the bottom of the ninth with a dou
ble to left field. One out later,
Muth lined a single to right and
Day's phenomenal head-first slide
just beat the tag of Cal catcher
Jason Hill to give Stanford its
fourth straight win — and Austin
his first in three starts.

Day said. "Then after I knew the
ball was going down I just ran. and
I got my hand in right before the

over to see what the umpire was
going to call."
The ninth-inning run helped
Austin earn his first career win
against the Golden Bears. He
walked none and struck out 15
while allowing just live hits and

In 18 innings against California
this season, the junior right-hander
has struek out 26 and not walked a
single batter.
Austin out-dueled Cal freshman
Jason Dennis, who threw his sec
ond complete game of the season
against the Cardinal. Dennis al
lowed seven hits and three earned
runs over 8 1/3 innings, while walk
ing two and striking out seven.
"1 thought we were dominated
by a great college pitcher in
Austin," Milano said. "I thought
[Dennis] pitched just as well, ex
cept he walked some guys."
Offensively for Stanford, Gall
blasted a two-run home run in the
bottom of the fifth to give the Car
dinal a 3-2 lead. Not to be outdone,
California right fielder Aaron
Gordnier countered with a solo
shot in the top of the seventh that
soared above the left-field lights
and is probably still airborne
somewhere over San Jose.
Gordnier's shot tied the game ;<.t
3-3. He also hit a solo homer in the
fourth and now has six in his last
eight games.
Cal's heroics were not lost on
Austin.
"They battled," Austin said.
" They battled their butts off. You
got to give them credit. They're a
tough, scrappy team."

"1 have no idea, to he honest."
said sophomore catcher Damien
Alvarado.
Yet this past weekend, tn a mir
ror image of the cross Bay rivalry
series two weeks before, the Hears
once again defied expectations.
The younger Cal squad put a

tough challenge to the Cardinal
veterans, who barely secured a 4-3
Friday victory at Sunken Dia
mond. took a 10-2 loss Saturday at
Cal's Evans Diamond and re
turned home yesterday to defeat
the Bears 12-4*
Stanford's come-from-behind
victory yesterday kept the Cardi
nal from falling into a second
place tie in the Six Pac. Instead.
Stanford sits one-half game ahead
of USC (36-14, 19-8) and a full
game ahead of Arizona State (32-
16, IK-8).
Beneath the watchful eyes of a
season-high 2.788 fans at Sunken
Diamond, the Bears struck early
and hard yesterday.
Cal right fielder Aaron Gord
nier drove tn shortstop Xavier
Nady with a line drive up the mid
dle before crossing the plate him
self later in the first inning.
And while the crowd may have
been vociferous, the Cardinal bats
remained uncharacteristically
silent. So silent, in fact, that Cal
freshman pitcher Ryan Atkinson
held the Cardinal to just one hit
through five innings. Atkinson en
tered the game with a 10.68 ERA.
Cardinal junior lefty Brent
Hoard, meanwhile, struggled on
the mound, giving up three runs.
Hoard retired in the fifth to fresh
man right-hander Justin Wayne (fi
ll) after giving up a solo shot to
Nady and extending the Cal lead to
3-0.
Motivated by junior second
baseman Tony Schrager's double
in the sixth, junior center fielder
Jody Gerut drove in the Cardinal
junior with a single. Junior third
baseman Josh Hochgesang was hit
by a pitch, driving in junior catcher
John Salter and cutting the Cal
lead to 3-2.
The final three innings then be
longed to Stanford as the Cardinal
offense exploded and the Cal
bullpen simultaneously imploded.
Five Cardinal runners scored in
the seventh as sophomore left
fielder Edmund Muth. sophomore
designated hitter Jeff Rizzo,
Gerut, senior shortstop Jay Peeci
and Alvarado crossed the plate.
Five more tagged home in the
eighth. Among the eighth-inning
barrage was a spectacular two-run
homer by Muth that careened off
the batting eye beyond the 400-
foot mark in center field.
Stanford fans at Evans Dia
mond on Saturday, however, wit
nessed a debacle as the Cardinal
lost to the Bears for the second
time this year, dropping Stanford
temporarily out of sole possession
of first place.
Led by the pitching of sopho
more right-hander Jon Shirley and
the hitting of Nady, Cal defeated
Stanford 10-2.
Shirley improved his record to
3-4 by out-dueling Stanford junior
Chad Hutchinson. Shirley tossed
seven innings and allowed only
two hits, one run (a solo home run)
and four walks. Nady, who went 2
for 4 on the day, had a key three
run double in the Bears' four-run
third inning.

Hutchinson, meanwhile, fell to
8-3 on the season, pitching six in
nings and giving up six hits, live
runs and six walks while striking
out live. After Hutchinson went
out in the seventh, the Cardinal
went through four relief pitchers
who gave up five runs.
Aside from Nady, Juan Her
nandez, Curtis Johnson and Rob
Meyer tallied two hits apiece for
Cal. Hernandez had a solo home
run in the fourth inning.
Sophomore Brad Steele pitched
the last two innings for Cal, giving
up a solo home run to sophomore
John Gall in the eighth. Gall had
also hit a solo home run off Shirley
in the sixth inning to account for
Stanford's two runs. Muth got the
only other hit for the Cardinal.
"We needed to build from
somewhere, and maybe today's the
day that we get it going," Cal head
coach Bob Milano said after the
game. "We've lost so many games
in the eighth or ninth inning this
year. If we were a high school team
we might be undefeated, but we've
got to play nine."
Friday's Cardinal victory served
as a perfect example for Milano's
gripes.
Muth's RBI single with one out
in the bottom of the ninth inning
led host Stanford to a 4-3 win over
the Bears.

Muth's ninth-inning heroics
made a winner out of Stanford
starter Jeff Austin, who struck out
a career-high 15 en route to a com
plete game five-hitter.
Austin (10-2) admitted, howev
er, that memories of the Cardinal's
4-3 complete game defeat to Cal
on April 10 at Sunken troubled
him late in the game.
"Shades and visions of that
game started haunting me a little
bit," Austin said.
Sophomore Nick Day led off
the bottom of the ninth with a dou
ble to left field. One out later,
Muth lined a single to right and
Day's phenomenal head-first slide
just beat the tag of Cal catcher
Jason Hill to give Stanford its
fourth straight win — and Austin
his first in three starts.

kind of hesitated because I

Day said. "Then after I knew the
ball was going down I just ran. and
I got my hand in right before the
catcher tagged me.... I had to roll
over to see what the umpire was
going to call."
The ninth-inning run helped
Austin earn his first career win
against the Golden Bears. He
walked none and struck out 15
while allowing just live hits and

In 18 innings against California
this season, the junior right-hander
has struek out 26 and not walked a
single batter.
Austin out-dueled Cal freshman
Jason Dennis, who threw his sec
ond complete game of the season
against the Cardinal. Dennis al
lowed seven hits and three earned
runs over 8 1/3 innings, while walk
ing two and striking out seven.
"1 thought we were dominated
by a great college pitcher in
Austin," Milano said. "I thought
[Dennis] pitched just as well, ex
cept he walked some guys."
Offensively for Stanford, Gall
blasted a two-run home run in the
bottom of the fifth to give the Car
dinal a 3-2 lead. Not to be outdone,
California right fielder Aaron
Gordnier countered with a solo
shot in the top of the seventh that
soared above the left-field lights
and is probably still airborne
somewhere over San Jose.
Gordnier's shot tied the game ;<.t
3-3. He also hit a solo homer in the
fourth and now has six in his last
eight games.
Cal's heroics were not lost on
Austin.
"They battled," Austin said.
" They battled their butts off. You
got to give them credit. They're a
tough, scrappy team."

the Bears 12-4*
Stanford's come-from-behind
victory yesterday kept the Cardi
nal from falling into a second
place tie in the Six Pac. Instead.
Stanford sits one-half game ahead
of USC (36-14, 19-8) and a full
game ahead of Arizona State (32-
16, IK-8).
Beneath the watchful eyes of a
season-high 2.788 fans at Sunken
Diamond, the Bears struck early
and hard yesterday.
Cal right fielder Aaron Gord
nier drove tn shortstop Xavier
Nady with a line drive up the mid
dle before crossing the plate him
self later in the first inning.
And while the crowd may have
been vociferous, the Cardinal bats
remained uncharacteristically
silent. So silent, in fact, that Cal
freshman pitcher Ryan Atkinson
held the Cardinal to just one hit
through five innings. Atkinson en
tered the game with a 10.68 ERA.
Cardinal junior lefty Brent
Hoard, meanwhile, struggled on
the mound, giving up three runs.
Hoard retired in the fifth to fresh
man right-hander Justin Wayne (fi
ll) after giving up a solo shot to
Nady and extending the Cal lead to
3-0.
Motivated by junior second
baseman Tony Schrager's double
in the sixth, junior center fielder
Jody Gerut drove in the Cardinal
junior with a single. Junior third
baseman Josh Hochgesang was hit
by a pitch, driving in junior catcher
John Salter and cutting the Cal
lead to 3-2.
The final three innings then be
longed to Stanford as the Cardinal
offense exploded and the Cal
bullpen simultaneously imploded.
Five Cardinal runners scored in
the seventh as sophomore left
fielder Edmund Muth. sophomore
designated hitter Jeff Rizzo,
Gerut, senior shortstop Jay Peeci
and Alvarado crossed the plate.
Five more tagged home in the
eighth. Among the eighth-inning
barrage was a spectacular two-run
homer by Muth that careened off
the batting eye beyond the 400-
foot mark in center field.
Stanford fans at Evans Dia
mond on Saturday, however, wit
nessed a debacle as the Cardinal
lost to the Bears for the second
time this year, dropping Stanford
temporarily out of sole possession
of first place.
Led by the pitching of sopho
more right-hander Jon Shirley and
the hitting of Nady, Cal defeated
Stanford 10-2.
Shirley improved his record to
3-4 by out-dueling Stanford junior
Chad Hutchinson. Shirley tossed
seven innings and allowed only
two hits, one run (a solo home run)
and four walks. Nady, who went 2
for 4 on the day, had a key three
run double in the Bears' four-run
third inning.

Hutchinson, meanwhile, fell to
8-3 on the season, pitching six in
nings and giving up six hits, live
runs and six walks while striking
out live. After Hutchinson went
out in the seventh, the Cardinal
went through four relief pitchers
who gave up five runs.
Aside from Nady, Juan Her
nandez, Curtis Johnson and Rob
Meyer tallied two hits apiece for
Cal. Hernandez had a solo home
run in the fourth inning.
Sophomore Brad Steele pitched
the last two innings for Cal, giving
up a solo home run to sophomore
John Gall in the eighth. Gall had
also hit a solo home run off Shirley
in the sixth inning to account for
Stanford's two runs. Muth got the
only other hit for the Cardinal.
"We needed to build from
somewhere, and maybe today's the
day that we get it going," Cal head
coach Bob Milano said after the
game. "We've lost so many games
in the eighth or ninth inning this
year. If we were a high school team
we might be undefeated, but we've
got to play nine."
Friday's Cardinal victory served
as a perfect example for Milano's
gripes.
Muth's RBI single with one out
in the bottom of the ninth inning
led host Stanford to a 4-3 win over
the Bears.

Muth's ninth-inning heroics
made a winner out of Stanford
starter Jeff Austin, who struck out
a career-high 15 en route to a com
plete game five-hitter.
Austin (10-2) admitted, howev
er, that memories of the Cardinal's
4-3 complete game defeat to Cal
on April 10 at Sunken troubled
him late in the game.
"Shades and visions of that
game started haunting me a little
bit," Austin said.
Sophomore Nick Day led off
the bottom of the ninth with a dou
ble to left field. One out later,
Muth lined a single to right and
Day's phenomenal head-first slide
just beat the tag of Cal catcher
Jason Hill to give Stanford its
fourth straight win — and Austin
his first in three starts.
"When Edmund first hit it. 1
kind of hesitated because I
couldn't tell if the second baseman
was going to be able to catch it,"
Day said. "Then after I knew the
ball was going down I just ran. and
I got my hand in right before the
catcher tagged me.... I had to roll
over to see what the umpire was
going to call."
The ninth-inning run helped
Austin earn his first career win
against the Golden Bears. He
walked none and struck out 15
while allowing just live hits and

three earned runs.
In 18 innings against California
this season, the junior right-hander
has struek out 26 and not walked a
single batter.
Austin out-dueled Cal freshman
Jason Dennis, who threw his sec
ond complete game of the season
against the Cardinal. Dennis al
lowed seven hits and three earned
runs over 8 1/3 innings, while walk
ing two and striking out seven.
"1 thought we were dominated
by a great college pitcher in
Austin," Milano said. "I thought
[Dennis] pitched just as well, ex
cept he walked some guys."
Offensively for Stanford, Gall
blasted a two-run home run in the
bottom of the fifth to give the Car
dinal a 3-2 lead. Not to be outdone,
California right fielder Aaron
Gordnier countered with a solo
shot in the top of the seventh that
soared above the left-field lights
and is probably still airborne
somewhere over San Jose.
Gordnier's shot tied the game ;<.t
3-3. He also hit a solo homer in the
fourth and now has six in his last
eight games.
Cal's heroics were not lost on
Austin.
"They battled," Austin said.
" They battled their butts off. You
got to give them credit. They're a
tough, scrappy team."
