## 
### Huat Chye Lim Contributing writer 
Members of the Stanford
African Students Association plan
to bridge the gap between Stanford
and Africa with a series of events
scheduled today through Saturday.
Africa Week, a series of five
events centering around this year's
theme of "African Renaissance,"
kieks off today.
The six-day program's "aim is to
allow the Stanford community, as
well as Bay Area residents, to be
part of a time where African cul
ture, history and politics are ex
plored in depth," said the associa
tion's vice president. Tseday Ale
hegn.
Africa Week will also provide
the Stanford community with "a
unique opportunity to be exposed
to different ideas and different cul
tures [by hearing] speakers and is
sues [it] otherwise wouldn't hear"
about, said senior Fatumata Ka
makate, the association's presi

dent.
In addition to enlightening the
Stanford community as a whole,
Africa Week has a secondary pur
pose, Kamakate said, "to bring to
gether all the African people and
people associated with Africa" at
Stanford and to "create solidarity
among the African community"
here.
She characterized Africa Week
as "primarily social hut also educa
tional."
The theme of the event, the
African Renaissance, "is a trend in
Africa: in political discourse, espe
cially in South Africa Some mem
bers of government have brought
up the term," Kamakate explained.
"We're trying to see if there is an
African Renaissance, and if so, to
see what it is. The theme permeates
through all of the week's events,"
she said.
Festivities kick off tonight at 7
p.m. with a keynote address by
Edith Ssempala, Uganda's ambas
sador to the United States. Ssem

pala, speaking in Tresidder
Union's Oak Lounge, will talk
about the African Renaissance and
set the tone for the rest of Africa
Week. Kamakate said. Ssempala is
also Ugandan representative to
both the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank.
Events to follow the keynote in
clude a panel discussion on the
"Perceptions of Africa by Africans
and the African Diaspora," moder
ated by John Mugane. a lecturer in
the Division of Literature. Culture
and Languages. There will also be a
dinner speech by South African po
litical scientist Chris 1 andsberg, ti
tled "Is there an African Renais
sance?"
The panel is scheduled for to
morrow and the dinner speech for
Saturday. With the exception of
the dinner speech, all of the week s
events are free and open to the
public.
Africa Week is the onl\ student-
organized event of its kind at Hay
Area universities, according to ka
makate.
While similar events exist at
UC-Berkeley and San Jose State
University, they typically last less
than a week.
Kamakate also stressed that
while African-American participa
tion is always welcome in Africa

Week, the "focus is on African, not
African-American, culture."
Nevertheless, she said. Africa
Week is still "a time for everybody
to come together" and discover
Africa.
The first Africa Week, themed
"African Liberation and African-
American Liberation." was held in
1979.
Since then, the association has
organized an Africa Week every
spring; it has turned into their
"biggest organization event." Ale

hegn said.
Prominent speakers who have
come to Stanford for Africa Week
in the past include Kenyan writer
Ngugi Wa Thiong'o and Hafsat
Abiola. the daughter of jailed
Nigerian president-elect Moshood
Abiola.
The program, to which Alehegn
characterized the Stanford com
munity's reaction as "enthusiastic
and supportive." regularly gener
ates more attendance than any
other event organized bv the asso

ciation. Kamakate said.
Last year's Africa Week Cul
ture Night also won the Black
Community Services Center F.vent
of the Year award, as it lias done in
previous years.
The association plans to contin
ue the Africa Week tradition into
the foreseeable future. Aside from
Africa Week, the association orga
nizes Wednesday panels. Thursday
forums and other Africa-related
events throughout the year. Ale
hegn said.
