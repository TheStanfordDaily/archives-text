Members of the Stanford
African Students Association plan
to bridge the gap between Stanford
and Africa with a series of events
scheduled today through Saturday.
Africa Week, a series of five
events centering around this year's
theme of "African Renaissance,"
kieks off today.
The six-day program's "aim is to
allow the Stanford community, as
well as Bay Area residents, to be
part of a time where African cul
ture, history and politics are ex
plored in depth," said the associa
tion's vice president. Tseday Ale
hegn.
Africa Week will also provide
the Stanford community with "a
unique opportunity to be exposed
to different ideas and different cul
tures [by hearing] speakers and is
sues [it] otherwise wouldn't hear"
about, said senior Fatumata Ka
makate, the association's presi

dent.
In addition to enlightening the
Stanford community as a whole,
Africa Week has a secondary pur
pose, Kamakate said, "to bring to
gether all the African people and
people associated with Africa" at
Stanford and to "create solidarity
among the African community"
here.
She characterized Africa Week
as "primarily social hut also educa
tional."
The theme of the event, the
African Renaissance, "is a trend in
Africa: in political discourse, espe
cially in South Africa Some mem
bers of government have brought
up the term," Kamakate explained.
"We're trying to see if there is an
African Renaissance, and if so, to
see what it is. The theme permeates
through all of the week's events,"
she said.
Festivities kick off tonight at 7
p.m. with a keynote address by
Edith Ssempala, Uganda's ambas
sador to the United States. Ssem

pala, speaking in Tresidder
Union's Oak Lounge, will talk
about the African Renaissance and
set the tone for the rest of Africa
Week. Kamakate said. Ssempala is
also Ugandan representative to
both the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank.
Events to follow the keynote in
clude a panel discussion on the
"Perceptions of Africa by Africans
and the African Diaspora," moder
