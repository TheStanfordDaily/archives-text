A I long Kong-based investor group donated
$5 million to Stanford Medical Center, most of
which will go to fund hepatitis research.
About $4 million will go to found the I lutchi
son Ciroup Program in Transitional Medicine,
which will fund studies dedicated to improving
the lives of patients with hepatitis.
The investor group, Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd., also gave $1 million to support the work of
Thomas Raffin, chief of the Division of Pul
monary and Critical Care Medicine and founder
and co-director of Stanford's Center for Bio
medical Ethics.
"Approximately 300 million people world
wide are infected with hepatitis, and one million
people each year die from it." said Raffin, who
is co-chairing the 15-member Hutchison Group
project selection committee with Assoc. Med
ical School Dean for Academics Edward
Holmes.
Raffin and Holmes sent out a call to faculty

for research proposals, which will be due July
15.
l hey hope to have the research under way by
Sept. 1.
The approach of this program is special, ac
cording to Raffin. because it seeks to translate
laboratory research into ways to actually help
infected patients.

"Most gilts are for endowed professorships,
or labs, or buildings, so a gilt for a purpose like
this is really unique," he said.
The gilt will be in the form of $1 million per

year for tour years.
The money, given directly to Ratlin, will go
to support both his research in pulmonary and
critical care and the Center for Biomedical
Ethics.
"My research studies pulmonary fibrosis,
asthma and lung cancer." Ratlin said. "'I he
Center for Biomedical Ethics focuses on the
Human Genome Project, multicultural issues,
end-of-life decisions and the impact of HMOs
on the quality of care."
Hutchison Wampoa is headed by Li Ka
shing. a Hong Kong businessman and philan
thropist.
"Stanford is the leader in the biomedical
field, and we are pleased to have the opportuni
ty to work with Stanford on this important pro
ject, which holds such great promise in an area
of major health concern," Li said in a press re
