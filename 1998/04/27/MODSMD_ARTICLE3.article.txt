# Report critical of undergrad teaching
## National situation assailed, but Stanford leads in finding solutions to key problems 
### Evan Moffic Contributing writer 
The top universities in the country arc
denying their undergraduates — particularly
freshmen — opportunities to interact with se
nior faculty, according to a report from the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching.
The report pointed out, however, that
Stanford already has programs in place to ad
dress many of the its most pessimistic findings
overall.
The report said that universities consigned
undergraduates to classes taught hv graduate
teaching assistants and failed to provide stu
dents with "'a coherent body of knowledge"
by the time they graduated.
To combat this, the report recommended
that top research universities involve under
graduates in research, whether it be in med
ical laboratories or humanities projects, be
ginning their freshman year. In not doing so.

universities risk turning students into robotic
receivers of information and dull their intel
lectual curiosity right when it should be form
ing.
The report was produced by a commis
sion whose members included I niversity of
ficials. fellows at the Carnegie Foundation
and members of the American Council on
Education.
According to Ramon Saldi'var. vice
provost for undergraduate education. Stan
ford stands out among top universities in pro
viding undergraduates many opportunities to
interact with faculty.
"With our new freshman seminars, sopho
more seminars. Sophomore College and In
troduction to the Humanities Program, fresh
men and sophomores at Stanford get to know
and work with senior faculty in many excel
lent ways," he said.
Saldi'var continued. "This is even more
true of our junior and senior under
graduates as they participate in the
Undergraduate Research Opportu
nities Program. Stanford in Washing
ton and Overseas Studies Programs.
Honors College and the many de
partmental individual research and
directed reading courses."
The report, in fact, cited Stan
ford's Sophomore College as an ex
ample of the kind of education all re
search universities should be offering
their students. In referring to the
general nationwide picture, the re
port's tone was more critical.
"Too often the freshman curricu
lum is a bore and freshman instruc
tion inadequate. Senior professors,
when they teach undergraduates,
tend to teach majors in advanced
courses," the report said.
"As a result, freshmen — the stu
dents who need the very best teach
ing — may actually receive the
worst."
Specific recommendations of the
report include rewarding faculty
members for good teaching, foster
ing more interdisciplinary work and
placing freshmen in small groups

where they live and take courses to
gether. It also suggested creating
courses structured around research
and problem-solving in which stu
dents work together in a laboratory
or on a humanities research project.
One key problem the report iden
tified was the academic unprepared
ness of many incoming freshmen and
their need for remedial classes.
"For a research university to de
vote a large portion of its faculty time
and its facilities to prepare students
for university study represents a dis
sipation of increasingly scarce re
sources," it said.
While most educators applaud
the report, many are concerned that
it is just another document to be
added to the pile of reports already
written on the subject.
The head of the commission that
produced the report, Shirley Strum
Kenny, was quoted in The Chronicle
of Higher Education: "For 30 years,
universities have been saying that
we've got to fix the problem of un
dergraduate education, and we have
done a lot of interesting things. But
the core has not changed. These
things never became part of the real
value system of research universities,
and it's really time to do something
about it."
