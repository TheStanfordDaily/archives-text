# Farm families for frosh
## 
### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
In hopes of giving every new student a w ay
to feel more at home on the Farm, a new cam
pus-wide organization has been formed to
match freshmen with big siblings.
Stanford University Big Siblings has begun
coordinating an extensive program to begin
next fall for all students. The program will
focus on helping freshmen meet both upper
classmen of various interests and fellow fresh
men. The organization anticipates official
recognition by University administration this
week.
"I think that its important for freshmen to
realize all of the opportunities that the campus
has to offer them." said sophomore Stephen
Kane, the group's president. "The optimal
way to do this is informally through interac
tion with other students."
Kane created the program out of his own
frustration from being ineligible for other "big
sib" programs on campus that are primarily
based on ethnicity or religion. Although there
are over eight such programs on campus, none
are available for students without an identify
ing religious or cultural group.
"When I came on to campus freshman year
I expected to have a big sib. but 1 was disap
pointed because there was no program for
me," Kane said. "1 decided that it would be a

good idea to have a program for all incomin;
students."
"I think that it's a great idea." said Dean c
Students Vlarc Wais. "I don't see [this ne>
program] competing with the current pre
grams. I see it augmenting them and in fact giv
ing Stanford students more opportunities."
"I'm also delighted that the program is stu
dent-initiated and not being driven bv staff,
think that that makes this program realh
unique," Wais added.
Planning for the program began in Januan
when Kane began accepting applications foi
the group m stu3?iWVho serve as the central
leadership for the program.
l*his core group plans to start a campaign
via e-mail, fliers and an organizational meet
ing this week in order to attract big sibling ap
plicants. The group also had a table at the
prospective freshmen activities fair last week
end to introduce incoming freshmen to the
idea.
"Every incoming freshman 1 talked to at
the activities fair was interested in the pro
gram." Kane said He estimates that around
500 students could be involved b\ next fall.
The new program is not intended to detract
from other big siblings programs with ethnic
or religious interests Members of the program
emphasized that thev are not in competition
with other sibling programs but feel
that everyone should have a chance
to participate.
The group would like to be able
to contact new students before they
arrive on campus, as religious and
ethnic programs do. However, ac
cording to Director of New Student
Orientation Heather Dunn, the

group will not be able do so so due
to its status as a student group and
not an arm of a University depart
ment.
The program will be subdivided
so that each set of siblings is part of a
team consisting of around 20 people.
This structure is designed to increase
the number of people each freshman
gets to know, and to insure that there
is adequate support for everyone in
the program.
The first activity being planned is

a barbecue, which is scheduled to
take place during the first week of
school to aquaint the freshmen with
their big siblings. Other activities
such as ski trips and dances will be
planned throughout the year for the
entire program.
In efforts to make freshmen feel
comfortable with all aspects of Stan
ford life. Kane and other members of
the leadership team hope to get pro
fessors involved with the program
through faculty dinners and related

events.
"We want to show incoming
freshman that they shouldn't be in
timidated by professors and that they
are approachable," Kane said.
"Knowing an upperclassman
makes you feel more comfortable in
your surroundings." said Rene Inte
riano. a freshman. "It helps students
get more involved and develop social
skills. Coming in as a stranger is real
ly tough: the program hopes to make
it easier."
