Obesity increases asthma risk
CHICAGO (AP) — Harvard researchers say a
study of thousands of nurses has provided the first
strong evidence that obesity greatly increases the risk
of developing asthma.
Even a little hit of fat increases the risk, and obese
people — those who are roughly 35 percent over
weight — are at least three times more likely to
develop the respiratory ailment that afflicts millions
of Americans, the researchers say.
For years, doctors have been aware of a connec
tion between obesity and asthma. But the general
assumption was that asthma conies first, that patients
were prone to putting on weight because breathing
problems limited exercise.
The new study was designed to test that assump
tion. and the results "guarantee that obesity preceded
the diagnosis of asthma," said the research leader. Dr.
Carlos A. ( amargo Jr. of the Harvard Medical School.
The results will be presented this week at the
international conference of the American Thoracic
Society and the American Lung Association.

Ray's funeral in black church?
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The family of
James Earl Kay, the convicted killer of Martin
Luther King Jr., wants to hold a public funeral at a
black church in the city where the civil rights leader
was assassinated.
His brother hopes King's relatives, who believe
Ray was not responsible for the I%X killing, would
attend a Memphis funeral. "It will be a memorial to
James to show he done 30 years for a crime that he
didn't commit," Jerry Ray said Saturday in a tele
phone interview from his home in Smartt. Tenn.
The Rays want to hold the funeral at Centenary
United Methodist Church, a 650-member black
church. The Rev. Herbert Lester, minister at the
church, said yesterday he had not spoken to anyone
about the planned funeral, but said. "I'd be open to
talking about it."
A spokeswoman for the King family did not
return a telephone message Sunday seeking com
ment on their possible attendance.
Ray, 70, died in Nashville Thursday of liver disease.
