The ASSU needs people willing to get things done;
willing to do the important, but unglamorous work
when the politicos duck out to do meaningless but
high-profile drivel.
Maren Norton and Santos Marroquin are such
people, working on the realistic issues that will
improve our University.
Students must have a voice regarding the deci
sions made at Stanford University!
• The diverse coalition of groups battling for
increased student voice in the Residential
Education movement must continue to be
strengthened and unified.
• We will use the Office of the ASSU President to
represent students in a way which the adminis
tration cannot ignore.
The severe shortage of graduate student housing
must be addressed!
• We are working with the GHAC and the GSC to
pressure the University to provide a concrete
timeline for the construction of new graduate
residences.
• Establishing a Graduate Student Housing
Network (GSHN) to assist graduate students in
finding off-campus housing, is a viable short
term solution.
Transportation Services must be expanded to
include student-friendly solutions!
• Transportation services has already agreed to
work with us regarding afternoon hours to
Safeway, and talks are underway regarding
weekend service.
• Remote parking lots, with shuttle service to and
from main campus, should be constructed for
faculty and staff so more central parking is
available for students and visitors.
The ASSU must be an advocate for students!
Our reform bill was approved by the ASSU Senate
last week, and senators will be assigned their
constituencies this spring.
• Senators will be expected to attend house
meetings, maintain contact with dorm reps and
student group leaders, and solicit feedback from
specific students.
The ASSU needs a team that has worked
together, a team with diverse interests and
experiences, a team that isn't afraid to stand
up for students.
From working behind the scenes to ensure that
student groups have the funding they need, to
assisting in the creation of one of the most
enjoyed publications on campus, we have proven
to have the diversity necessary to understand
student concerns, and the ability to address them
efficiently.
Norton and Marroquin have an excellent record
of working with the administration when the time
comes to stop identifying problems and start
talking about solutions.

Every year something strange happens. One
week in April, the campus is covered with colorful
flyers with ASSU candidates promising to change
Stanford as we know it. Everyone gets excited for a
little while about the promises made —better parking,
a "new ASSU," and more. But each year, the same
thing happens.
Nothing.
That's why we're doing something funda
mentally different this year. We are staking our jobs
on keeping six promises by the middle of our term.
These are important things that will directly affect us
all—keeping Tresidder open past midnight for food
and hanging out, student voice in university deci
sions, a better Course Guide, a campus calendar,
support for student groups, and a graduate student
cabinet member to address housing, parking, and
student fee issues.
We believe so strongly that these things will
actually happen, we have already started working on
them and will stake our jobs on getting them done. If
our opponents are really serious about making
changes, we ask them to do the same.
But our vision for student government isn't
limited to five promises.
We believe the ASSU should be advocating
on behalf of students and involving more students in
ASSU and administrative decisions. We will work to
institutionalize funding for community groups,
control tuition increases (as the ASSU successfully
did four years ago), and explore using Dining
Services meal plans at Polio Rey's, Jamba Juice, the
CoHo and CoPo.
We are different from the other candidates in two
important ways:
The ASSU needs fresh energy and a proven
record. We have both. We can promise major changes
in Tresidder, tuition, and the Course Guide, because
Matt has worked with administrators, from the
Provost to the Chief Financial Officer of the Univer
sity to the Dean of Students, on significant projects.
More importantly, Bianca has no experience
in the ASSU at all. However, she has worked with
students by leading one of the largest student
organization on campus. This has given her real
experience organizing students to influence university
decisions.
It's not enough to make good promises. The
problem with the current ASSU —and the ASSU
every year—is that it is plagued with inactivity, a
lack of vision, and no substantive plans for
change.
We believe in the accountability of
student government to the student body. So if
we're not doing our jobs, we don't deserve to keep
them. And once we accomplish our five promises,
we will continue to work towards achieving our
vision for the ASSU, because real change doesn't
happen in only six months.

The ASSU needs people willing to get things done;
willing to do the important, but unglamorous work
when the politicos duck out to do meaningless but
high-profile drivel.
Maren Norton and Santos Marroquin are such
people, working on the realistic issues that will
improve our University.
Students must have a voice regarding the deci
sions made at Stanford University!
• The diverse coalition of groups battling for
increased student voice in the Residential
Education movement must continue to be
strengthened and unified.
• We will use the Office of the ASSU President to
represent students in a way which the adminis
tration cannot ignore.
The severe shortage of graduate student housing
must be addressed!
• We are working with the GHAC and the GSC to
pressure the University to provide a concrete
timeline for the construction of new graduate
residences.
• Establishing a Graduate Student Housing
Network (GSHN) to assist graduate students in
finding off-campus housing, is a viable short
term solution.
Transportation Services must be expanded to
include student-friendly solutions!
• Transportation services has already agreed to
work with us regarding afternoon hours to
Safeway, and talks are underway regarding
weekend service.
• Remote parking lots, with shuttle service to and
from main campus, should be constructed for
faculty and staff so more central parking is
available for students and visitors.
The ASSU must be an advocate for students!
Our reform bill was approved by the ASSU Senate
last week, and senators will be assigned their
constituencies this spring.
• Senators will be expected to attend house
meetings, maintain contact with dorm reps and
student group leaders, and solicit feedback from
specific students.
The ASSU needs a team that has worked
together, a team with diverse interests and
experiences, a team that isn't afraid to stand
up for students.
From working behind the scenes to ensure that
student groups have the funding they need, to
assisting in the creation of one of the most
enjoyed publications on campus, we have proven
to have the diversity necessary to understand
student concerns, and the ability to address them
efficiently.
Norton and Marroquin have an excellent record
of working with the administration when the time
comes to stop identifying problems and start
talking about solutions.

Every year something strange happens. One
week in April, the campus is covered with colorful
flyers with ASSU candidates promising to change
Stanford as we know it. Everyone gets excited for a
little while about the promises made —better parking,
a "new ASSU," and more. But each year, the same
thing happens.
Nothing.
That's why we're doing something funda
mentally different this year. We are staking our jobs
on keeping six promises by the middle of our term.
These are important things that will directly affect us
all—keeping Tresidder open past midnight for food
and hanging out, student voice in university deci
sions, a better Course Guide, a campus calendar,
support for student groups, and a graduate student
cabinet member to address housing, parking, and
student fee issues.
We believe so strongly that these things will
actually happen, we have already started working on
them and will stake our jobs on getting them done. If
our opponents are really serious about making
changes, we ask them to do the same.
But our vision for student government isn't
limited to five promises.
We believe the ASSU should be advocating
on behalf of students and involving more students in
ASSU and administrative decisions. We will work to
institutionalize funding for community groups,
control tuition increases (as the ASSU successfully
did four years ago), and explore using Dining
Services meal plans at Polio Rey's, Jamba Juice, the
CoHo and CoPo.
We are different from the other candidates in two
important ways:
The ASSU needs fresh energy and a proven
record. We have both. We can promise major changes
in Tresidder, tuition, and the Course Guide, because
Matt has worked with administrators, from the
Provost to the Chief Financial Officer of the Univer
sity to the Dean of Students, on significant projects.
More importantly, Bianca has no experience
in the ASSU at all. However, she has worked with
students by leading one of the largest student
organization on campus. This has given her real
experience organizing students to influence university
decisions.
It's not enough to make good promises. The
problem with the current ASSU —and the ASSU
every year—is that it is plagued with inactivity, a
lack of vision, and no substantive plans for
change.
We believe in the accountability of
student government to the student body. So if
we're not doing our jobs, we don't deserve to keep
them. And once we accomplish our five promises,
we will continue to work towards achieving our
vision for the ASSU, because real change doesn't
happen in only six months.
