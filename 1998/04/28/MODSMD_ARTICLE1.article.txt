# Runoff set
## Voting starts tomorrow for new ASSU president 
### James Pritchard Staff writer 
It's all going to he decided
Thursday night.
The polls for the runoff election
for next year's ASSU president
will close at midnight Thursday.
A vote count will reveal
whether Norton or Spence will be
head honcho for the next school
year.
Juniors Maren Norton and San
tos Marroquin are running against
sophomore Matt Spence and ju
nior Bianca Ling as the remaining
candidates from the original live
ticket race.
The election will run in the
same manner as it did two weeks
ago. Polls will open on the World
Wide Weh at midnight tonight and
will close 48 hours later.
Paper ballots will be available
during the day at Tresidder IJnion
and the Medical. Law and Business
schools.
In the first election, Spence
came away with the most votes —
1,121, or 29.24 percent of voting
students.
Norton's ticket made the runoff
with the second-most votes — 856,
or 22.33 percent of voting students.
The remaining votes were dis

tributed among the three other
candidates and various write-in
candidates.
With the candidate pool pared
down to just two tickets and no
write-in votes allowed, almost 50
percent of the original votes are
now unclaimed. Norton and
Spence will fight for each one tooth
and nail.
With the voting for the ASSU
Senate, the class presidential slates
and the special fees all over, the
voter turnout may be much lower.
"The biggest challenge of this
election is to get people out to vote
again," Spence said.
"I would hope that it's not too
much lower," Norton said. "I think
it is very important to get the vote
out."
The two tickets have been al
lowed an additional $60 of cam
paign spending money. The origi
nal budget limit was $310 for each
candidate.
The campaign will be similar to
the reams of fliers that plastered
White Plaza two weeks ago. The
only difference is that the fliers will
all be Spence's and Norton's.
"It won't necessarily be a differ
ent campaign." Norton said.

"We're just going to step it up a
hit."
"We're just generally going all
out," Spence said. "Our issues
haven't changed."
Norton's fliers feature the en
dorsements of the three presiden
tial slates who did not make the
runoff.
Spence's feature the endorse
ments of The Daily and the ethnic
community student groups.
This runoff will be the first pres
idential election to go to a runoff
under the new ASSU Constitu
tion, approved in the spring of

1996.
So. what is the first thing Nor
ton and Spence will do next year if
they are elected?
"We would pass a senate reso
lution that outlines [the five tasks]
that we will accomplish by Febru
ary." or be kicked out of office,
Spence said. "Students will know
exactly what they can expect from
student government in the coming
year."
"Our entire plan will need to
start right away," Norton said.
'We want to lay a foundation by
meeting with administrators, con
tinuing dialogue with the student
body and putting together a cabi
net of people who want to start
tackling issues from our platform."
