Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic, an orga
nization that provides audio tapes of texts for
people who are blind or dyslexic, recently hon
ored freshman O with an award given
to outstanding students who, despite having
learning disabilities, plan to continue their edu
cation.
O won a Marion Huber Learning
Through Listening Award on March 30 for high
school achievement and for deciding to pursue a
college education despite his dyslexia.
What his learning disability means is that
while most freshmen are curling up with their
economics or chemistry books. Ogami is listen
ing to the texts on tape. Through the services of
the nonprofit organization and Stanford's Dis
ability Resource Center, O cruises along
with the rest of his class.
In the past. O said he found that "some
don't believe in [the disability] and think it is lit
tle more than trying to manipulate the system."
He has not found this attitude at Stanford,
where he said people are open and the services
are readily available.

Ogami's relationship with the organization
goes back before college. Ogami, who is from
Torrance, Calif., has been using their services
since he began high school.
"I don't think I would be here today" without
the organization, he said.
Howell Lovell of the Northern California
unit of the organization countered Ogami's
thinking, saying, "We just give him the tools to
succeed, and he is the one who uses them. He is
here because he was good enough to get into
Stanford, not because we helped him."
While admittance to Stanford is an honor
and possibly a challenge for most students, the
cards were stacked against Ogami from the
start. According to the organization, 35 percent
of high school students identified with learning
disabilities drop out.
Ogami not only stayed in school but over
came dyslexia and attention deficit disorder to
graduate with a 4.0 grade point average.
Ogami first took upper-level courses to be
with his friends but then realized he wanted to
challenge himself more and work to his full po
tential. He realized he could work above high
school leve; Stanford provides him with that

challenge.
Lovell said Ogami is the first in the area to
win the award. "We consider Sam receiving this
award to be the high point of our year," he said.
As for the award itself, Ogami said he was
very honored and surprised to receive it.
"The application was supposed to be typed,
but I couldn't find a typewriter so I sent it in
handwritten with a note," said Ogami, explain
ing that he tried various copy centers but each
one had something wrong with its typewriter.
He figured sending in a handwritten application
would end his chances.
But it didn't. In late March, he headed to
New York City to receive his award and a $5,000
scholarship presented by actor Tony Randall.
He was joined by five other award winners who
were honored for leadership, scholarship, enter
prise and service to others. Ogami continues to
pursue his potential and further the attributes
that garnered him the award. His advice for oth
ers who are disabled is not to be easily discour
aged, to go out and get what they want and to be
ready if things don't work the first time.
"If you keep on working and setting goals,"
he said, "you'll reach them."
