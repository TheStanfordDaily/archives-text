# Newletter to inform about government
## ASSU News begins 
### Joann Liao Contributing writer 
Today marks the inaugural issue
of ASSU News. Intended to improve
communication between students
and the ASSU, the newsletter will be
posted around campus.

Many of this year's ASSU cam
paign platforms addressed the com
munication gap between students
and their government.
"We acknowledge that there's
generally a lack of communication."
said newsletter editor Mike Levin, a
freshman senator. "There's a lot of
people on this campus who have no
idea what the ASSU does. This is a
way to start to fix that.
"It's time to start talking, instead
of students not knowing what's going
on and us acting like a bunch of bu
reaucrats."
Anyone — members of the stu
dent body as well as senators — may
submit an article. Levin then com
piles the material.
"We want to let people know
about goals and projects of the ASSU
senators," Levin said. "Also, any
members of the student body who
have something to say or a project
that they want people to know about
can submit something. It's a good
way to publicize."
The ASSU Senate has planned
the project since the beginning of the
year.
"It's something we've discussed,
and we thought it'd be a good idea so
students would know what's going tin
because a lot of what we do is behind
the scenes," said sophomore Rita
Leung, an ASSU senator.
Each senator typically chooses a
project to work on. Levin and ASSU
President Emily Andrus pursued the
newsletter. Leung said. "[They] were
the ones who were really excited

about the idea. They publish it for
us."
Though the idea has been sim
mering in the back of the minds of
Andrus and Vice President Ben
Decker, work on the newsletter did
not begin until a few weeks into this
quarter. Levin said the long delay
was due to a lack of time, as the sena
tors were involved with other pro
jects.
"We haven't had the time until
now," Leung said. "But we're hoping
that if we start it now, then the next
senate will pick it up."
Part of the reason the newsletter's
editors chose to publish it now was
due to the timing of the ASSU Spring
General Election.
"We wanted to also promote the
runoff election in this issue," Levin
said. "We held off till the election was
over because we didn't want to put
up any more ASSU stuff than was al
ready all over campus.
"Plus, many of the people who
were involved in the newsletter were
busy running their own campaigns. It
was a timing thing."
The first issue of the newsletter
contains a letter from Andrus, as well
as synopses of the projects and goals
that the senate has been working on
all year long and a description of the
new ASSU Draw Guide. The senate
also hopes to encourage attendance
at its meetings through the newslet
ter.
"We want to encourage students
to come so we can get their input,"
Levin said.
Attendance at the meetings, ac
cording to Leung, has been steadily
decreasing during the year.
Although Levin doesn't think
there will be time for more than two
newsletters in the remainder of this
quarter, he foresees publication at a
biweeklv rate next vcar.
