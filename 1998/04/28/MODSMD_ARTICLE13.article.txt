I loffa cleared to run
WASI lIN(iK)N (AF) — James I'. Holla won a second chance to
run for the Teamsters presidency yesterday, while the union's former
political director was indicted on charges stemming from the tainted
19% election.
After a five-month investigation, a court-appointed monitor cleared
the son of labor legend Jimmy I ioffa to participate in a rerun despite
finding that he was occasionally "vague and not credible" in his sworn
statements about the conduct of a top aide.
Chough often critical of I ioffa and others on his election slate, the
report by election officer Michael Cherkasky gave Hoffa the go-ahead
to seek control of the union that his father built into a national force.
Incumbent union president Hon Carey's slim 1996 re-election victo
ry was overturned in November by another monitor, who found that
Carey took part in a scheme to use some $885,(XX) in union funds to
boost his re-election coffers.
Soldier to he exhumed
WASHIN(! I ()N (AM) Remains of the Vietnam veteran in the
Comb ol the Unknowns should be exhumed to determine if they
belong to a downed Air Force pilot as his family believes, a Pentagon
panel said yesterday.
I)elensc Secretai \ William ( ohen said he will decide in the next two
weeks whethei to grant the request of Air Force Ist Lt. Michael J.
Blassie's family to have the remains exhumed for possible identifica
tion.
"All we ever wanted was an answer: Is that Michael Blassie or not?"
said Fat Blassie. his sister and family spokeswoman.
Cohen said he would not decide until his general counsel investi
gates whether there's any legal obstacle to the exhumation — some
thing Pentagon officials said they don't foresee.
Neanderthals may have spoken
VVASI 11 N( i I ()N (AF) Primitive human-like species may have
had the physical ability to speak some 300,(XX) years ago, long before
the evolution of modern humans, new research suggests.
Scientists at Duke I niversiiy say the skulls of Neanderthals and of
some other primitive higher primates show they may have had the
nerve complex needed to control the subtle and varied movement of
the tongue required for speech.
Matt ( artmill of Duke, co-author of a study to be published today
in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said the bony
canal carrying a nerve connection between the brain and the tongue is
about the same si/e in the Neanderthal and early humans as it is in
modern humans.
