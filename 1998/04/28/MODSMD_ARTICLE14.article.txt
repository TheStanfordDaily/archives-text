# Line-item veto unlikely to stand
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) â€” The
Clinton administration got a skepti
cal reaction from several Supreme
Court justices yesterday in seeking
to restore the historic "line-item
veto" law that let the president can
cel specific items in tax and spend
ing measures.
Che president's use of a line-item
veto does not repeal part of a law.
and therefore the separation of
powers between Congress and the
president remains intact. Solicitor

General Seth Waxman told the
court.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
responded that when the president
exercises a line-item veto. "From a
taxpayer's standpoint, this was a
law that's been canceled" without a
congressional vote.
A federal judge ruled the line
item veto unconstitutional in Febru
ary.
But the government could win at
least short-term reinstatement of

the law if the justices' ruling,
expected by July, says those who
challenged il lacked legal standing
to sue.
Waxman argued that neither
New York ( ity nor an Idaho potato
growers' group could sue because
they were not directly affected by
President Clinton's line-item
vetoes.
The Supreme Court last year
threw out a previous challenge to
the law bv six members of

( ongress. saying they lacked stand
ing to bring the case.
Congress voted in 19% to grant
the president line-item veto author
ity. sought by nearly every presi
dent this century as a tool to control
"pork barrel" spending. Clinton
exercised the veto K2 times last
year.
The line-item veto law lets the
president sign a bill and within five
days go back to reject specific
spending items or tax breaks in it.
