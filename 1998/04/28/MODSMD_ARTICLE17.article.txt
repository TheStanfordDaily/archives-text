Last Thursday, fuzzies and
techies hurried to the Teaching
C'enter of the Science Quad to
see one ol this century's most impor
tant scientists. Stephen Hawking. But
the two lecture halls were filled
beyond capacity 10 minutes before the
lecture was scheduled, and frustrated
students were turned away.
Hawking's visit was planned on
short notice. However, physicists and
non-phvsicists alike were disappointed
- Jut u.auccjuaic facilities were provid-
Saiof tnc event. Although Hawkinu
stipulated that he wanted to speak
only to the physics community, there
was no effort made at the lecture to
separate physics students and faculty
from the rest of the crowd.
However, a better solution would
not have been to restrict the lecture to
the physics community. Fart of what
students pay for at Stanford is the
chance to see and learn from brilliant
scientists like Hawking. Science
departments should recognize that sci
entists have broad appeal. In the
future, these departments should work
more closely with groups like the
ASSU Speakers Bureau to sponsor
visits by scientists.
Iliis year, the Speakers Bureau has
showcased speakers including Gloria
Steinem, Ray Bradbury and Scott
Adams — all of whom were co-spon
sored by other organizations. While
these ate fascinating and dynamic

speakers, they do not represent the
entire spectrum of students' interests.
Science has been neglected as a popu
lar topic.
Perhaps event organizers fear that
science speakers won't be able to draw
the large crowds that Steinem or Brad
bury can. But last Thursday's turnout
proved that people are curious about
science. You don't have to be an
astronomer to be curious about a topic
like the origin of the universe. That's
why people of all majors were disap
pointed in not hearing Hawking's lec
ture.
Hawking's lecture was technical.
But many of the attending students
knew it would be, and stayed to hear it
anyway. Even if they didn't understand
every detaiL there was still plenty
learn. The give-and-take between"
Hawking and Physics Prof. Andrei
Linde provided insight into the pro
cess of science. Theories are debated
and discussed before they are written
in textbooks. Those facts in the text
books are not absolute; they are part
of the process of science. This is why
scientific speakers are valuable for the
general public.
Of course, some came to see Hawk
ing just for the chance to see a scientif
ic genius. Brilliance sells. That's why
Albert Einstein has become one of the
most well-recognized people in the
world — so well-recognized that his
face is used in advertising campaigns.
In the future, we hope academic
departments and funding organiza
tions recognize the need for more sci
ence speakers. And we hope that in
the future they can speak in larger
venues that can accommodate more
members of the community.
