## A
						healthy dose of pro fro naivete

YOU CAN STOP
smiling now. The
pro fros are gone.
Our normal lives can
resume: we don't need to
vacuum the floor or dust
the plants anymore. The
well-nigh impossible task

of making a Lagunita
Court double look appealing is behind us.
The young impressionables have all gone
home to mommy and daddy, some a bit
hung over. Most have decided to return
again in September.
Admittedly, Stanford is an easy sell, but
the vigor with which we attempt to per
suade our high school brethren and sistren
still amazes me. Along with a healthy dose
of school spirit, we share an impulse to val
idate our own decisions to attend Stanford.
There is a self-congratulatory ring in our
well-wishing to the lucky 13 percent, as if
they had gained entrance to a club or secret
society. It is appropriate that Rush ends as
admit weekend begins. The two processes
are not all that dissimilar — except, per
haps, in the amount of a cappella sung.
Not that the admissions office seems to
make too many mistakes. I am perpetually
awed by the talents and abilities of my fel
low students, and this year's crop is no
exception to the rule.
The arrival of the pro fros inevitably

becomes a time of self-reflection for most of
us. Freshmen have the 'i'm-so-glad-I'm-no
longer-in-high-school" epiphany, feeling 10
years removed from the experience they
took part in one year earlier. Seniors, if they
bother to notice, try desperately to remem
ber that far back into the past. It is difficult
enough to recall the days of no failing
grades, no Web Axess and cardboard IDs.
The haze of high school days four years
removed is impossible to reconstruct.
The pro fros always seem to possess
something we lack: an element of unbound
ed energy, of wonder at their surroundings.
Their bright red folders and deer-in-head
lights gazes are endearing, the campus
buzzes with their arrival, adding a new
dynamic to an otherwise predictable week
end. To be fair, none of them have been
pulling all-nighters for CS 107 or Eco
nomics 80, writing honors theses or filling
out Draw cards. Their sense of naivete,
though it makes them prone to bicycle acci
dents, is refreshing on a campus where all
too often we become complacent.
When was the last time you fountain
hopped or stood in front of the mosaics of
Memorial Church at night? When was the
last time you broke out of your normal rou
tine?
Something happens to us as we progress
through our four years here. Everyone who
first comes to Stanford has a different tex

ture — a home, a family, a background that
initially caught the admissions office's eye.
Through the years, that uniqueness gets
rubbed smooth, filed down by the academic
pressure and social uniformity that campus
life breeds!
Why are freshman dorms always the
most involved, energetic places on campus?
Though first-year students are subject to
fewer academic pressures, the rest of us
seem — to put it euphemistically — to mel
low in our old age. Others might perceive it
as aging not-so-gracefully. We risk homo
geneity, a tendency to think and act alike.
It's not the result of some Residential Edu
cation dictum of uniformity, but rather apa
thy and disinterest in re-engaging with our
environment.
Through sheer repetition we have worn
ruts into our daily lives on campus. As years
pass, these ruts grow deeper and deeper. If
we are to dig ourselves out from our own
conventionalities, we need to do it through
the sheer force of will. Otherwise Stanford,
with all of its marvelous attributes, will
become a breeding ground of complacency.
Perhaps the Class of 2(X)2, with their
endearing confusion, could alert us toward
a new beginning.
