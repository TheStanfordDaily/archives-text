# Producer Tisch here tomorrow
## 
### Nkomo Morris Editorial staff 
Steve Tisch,
producer of such
critically-ac
claimed films as
"Corrina, Corri
na." and "Forrest

Gump." will speak at the Graduate
School of Business tomorrow about
how to start and maintain a career in
the film and television industry.
"The public can smell a bomb the
day a movie opens." he said in an in
terview yesterday."The public is sen
sitive to movies being over-hyped
and oversold."
Tisch's career as a producer began
at a fairly young age. He began work
ing for his family's movie theater
chain when he was still a student at
Tufts University. One of his first jobs
after college was a production execu
tive position at Columbia Pictures,
where he did behind-the-scenes work
on films including "The Lords of Flat
bush" and "Tommy."
But Tiseh's filmmaking career
hasn't been limited to "fun" movies.
Many may remember a television
movie Tisch produced in 1984, called

"The Burning Bed."
The movie, which starred Farrah
Fawcett, was the first network televi
sion production to graphically depict
the horrors of domestic violence and
its consequences. It was also one of
the first times that a public service an
nouncement was aired during prime
time television.
"We were lucky in that the net
work was ready to air groundbreak
ing material." he said. "1 really want
the opportunity to produce a wide va
riety of movies, because that's what's
going to afford me the opportunity to
work with a variety of talent."
Tisch's preoccupation with dy
namism in filmmaking led to his
eventual break from the studio sys
tem in Tisch believes that the
studio system kills a great deal of cre
ativity. Even though "Pulp Fiction"
was the main competition against
"Forrest Gump" in the IW4 Acade
my Awards. Tisch looks at the ac
complishments of independent film
makers like Quentin Tarantino with
optimism.
"The system is very fear-driven,
and it works counterproductively to
what creative people aspire to do."
Tisch said.
