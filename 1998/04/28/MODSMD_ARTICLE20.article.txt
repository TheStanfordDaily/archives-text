Law School must not
allow discrimination
Stanford Law School is poised to sell its
principles on employment discrimination
to the I S. government in exchange for
federal aid Empowered hy recent federal
legislation, the Department of Defense is
threatening law schools across the country
with loss of some federal money, if military
recruiters are not allowed to interview stu
dents in law school facilities. Interviews at
a university's centralized recruiting facility
are not sufficient for the military.
Stanford and most other law schools
have a long-standing policy of barring
employers, like the military, that discrimi
nate on the basis of sexual orientation.

Stanford Law School had decided as a
matter of principle that it did not wish to
promote or participate in employment dis
crimination by allowing it to occur under
the Law School's aegis.
Recognizing that conflict with the mili
tary was inevitable, students approached
Law School Dean Paul Brest at the begin
ning of last semester when the military
first asked for access to the Law School.
Students requested that a committee of
faculty and students be convened to study
this issue and recommend solutions.
On advice of University Counsel Tom
Fenner and Provost Condoleezza Rice,
Dean Brest refused to form such a com
mittee. allegedly out of fear that its mere
existence would precipitate conflict with
the military.
That refusal represents bad faith and a
desire to degrade Stanford's non-discrimi
nation policy at a time of crisis by prevent
ing thoughtful and deliberate input from
faculty and students.
As the military became increasingly
insistent. Dean Brest convened a group of
faculty and students at the end of last
semester.
He told us that $ 1 (K).(KK) was at stake if

Stanford did not comply with the military,
that the Law School was currently
attempting to increase the type of federal
funding that is subject to the military's
penalty, and that he was adamantly
opposed to publicly fighting the military or
even the provost over the military's right
to impose this penalty on a university.
At the time, he was not sure whether
he would try to cover the loss with other
funds or whether the Law School would, in
his own words, "capitulate" to the military.
Early this year. Dean Brest approached
me and said he had secured a total of
$5(K),(K)() in government funds that would
be lost if the Law School did not comply
with the military. Therefore, allowing mil
itary interviews was very likely.
Faced with this same moral dilemma,
the law schools at both Yale and New
York University have stood their ground.
Neither sought additional federal funding
as an excuse for capitulation. Yale main
tains that the military is mistaken, and that
Yale Law School's long-standing ban on
discriminatory interviews is in compliance
with the new federal law. Yale has no
plans to review its policy.
In the April 24, 1998 issue of The

Chronicle of Higher Education. John Sex
ton. Dean of NYlJ's Law School
remarked, "On issues like this, the amount
of money you would lose shouldn't make a
difference.
You don't make decisions of principle
based upon the price tag."
At Yale and NYU, they stand by their
principles. At Stanford we haggle over the
price of ours.

Solve parking problems
Stanford's parking situation is worsen
ing, particularly on the west side of cam
pus. The reason for the current mess is an
out-of-control bureaucracy called "Trans
portation Programs."
The current situation has several unde
sirable effects.
First, there is waste impacting both the
University in the form of lower productiv
ity and employees in the form of wasted
time, money and energy. Even society suf
fers when valuable research is hindered.
Second, the goal of the bureaucracy is
to "force people from their automobiles."

While encouraging cycling is a good cause,
punishing people for driving creates an
unsafe situation.
Many students (paid less than $20,000
per year before taxes) are forced to live in
less safe areas. Forcing students to bike to
these areas at night is asking for trouble.
By deciding how people should commute,
Stanford is assuming liability for people
forced into less safe modes of transporta
tion.
Stanford should eliminate the parking
bureaucracy and provide a reasonable
parking solution like every other large
employer in the Hay Area.

I'd like to hear from others on this issue!
