# Showering with the boys
## Protecting your ass in the big, bad real world 
### 
Vanessa Bartsch

A GRADUATION SPEECH I once
heard advised. "Live in New York,
hut leave before you get too hard.
Then live in San Francisco, but leave before
you get too soft."
I've never lived in New York, but I am liv
ing the fat life here in the land of silicon and
rolling hills. And, heeding the latter piece of
advice, 1 better leave soon because 1 am
becoming soft like wet bread.
Last week 1 took a break from working
and lied down on the sunny banks of that lit
tle body of water we insist on calling a lake.
I spent an hour just relishing the Barbie
Dream House-life that Stanford provides.
When it came time for dinner, I gathered
my bag and hefted my bike back down
toward Flo Mo. I rolled into the crosswalk,
still wearing a contented smile as I got on my
bike and began to pedal home.
My blissful bubble was ruptured when I
heard a screech and a series of long, loud
honks. I looked up. expecting to see a friend
a little overzealous in the automotive hellos.
Instead 1 found a car of four obnoxious
strangers wielding open beers and too much

attitude.
"HEY! What the hell do you think you're
doing!?" the driver yelled out the open win
dow.
I stopped and stared, trying to figure out
what was going on.
"That is DANGEROUS! DAN-GER
OUS, you crazy beeyatch!"
"Excuse me?" I said, confused.
"Are you trying to get hit? Get the hell
out of my way!"
The blood began to rush into my face and
my sense of calm quickly dwindled as I real
ized why they were pissed.
This car lull of egomaniacal party-beasts
was upset that they had to come to a com
plete stop AND wait for me.
! balanced my bike in front of their car
braced for a confrontation, just itching to
remind these fools about that nice state law
that kindly gives me the right to do anything
I please in that crosswalk. And then I was
going to suggest a couple of places where
they could stick those beer cans. But I didn't.
I shook my head and pedaled away.
There wasn't a thing that I could say to those

drunken fools that would make a smidge of
difference. And I didn't need a physical alter
cation.
It has only been three years since I
tromped my snowy way down the chilly
paths of Massachusetts. And all those clever
enough to visit Harvard and hightail it back
to the land of the other ridiculous red-col
ored mascot know that Boston ain't the
friendliest of places.
I later recounted my biking story to my
friend Tom. He noted how silly it seemed for
me to be upset, seeing as street-crossing in
Boston is a contact sport. I lonking. swearing,
kicking and spitting are considered fair play.
Yet in this little island of comfort we call
college, bad things aren't supposed to hap
pen. Campus Drive is meant to be a thor
oughfare of kindness and four-way stops.
Life is supposed to be like the brochures.
Azure skies, emerald hills, amazing people
and all that other crap.
Mean people don't exist, unless you count
TAs. Ugliness only comes during finals
week. Sin lives in a select few frat houses.
And bad drivers only plague the lanes of the

101.
You may mock this thought process — I
sure as hell did my freshman year — but after
a couple years of untainted living, you actu
ally begin to expect it.
Last Friday I headed into the City and
lived a day only possible in college. 1 roamed
the city until dinner, when my date and 1
used a parking garage to change from jeans
to formal wear.
We savored a dinner that Row cooks only
dream of. Then we rolled off to catch a con
cert.
After a voyage back to the car and a
switch back to jeans, we headed over to a
quirky dive in the Haight to dance to the type
of funk you only wish frat parties would
offer.
Again, 1 was living free of all things
malevolent. I danced in oblivion until, during
"I Got the Feeling," two large men sidled
their way over and began freaking me.
I slipped away as quickly and gracefully as
possible, a little flustered but not fazed.
Until the aforementioned men started
grabbing my ass Repeatedly.

I was caught again, not knowing how to
handle these men. twice my age and three
times my width, but certain I did not want
their mitts on my keester.
I ended up grabbing my oblivious date
and swinging him around 180 degrees, leav
ing my behind nicely protected by the wall.
As I drove home. I started getting a little
cranky. An unwritten code of conduct exists
at Stanford, if only because one tries not to
do sleazy things in a place where gossip
spreads faster than mono. And the occasion
al hand-roaming rogue can be quickly
squashed with an evil l(X)k.
Here you expect the best. You get a little
soft.
But out there, in the Real World, life isn't
quite as simple. People honk. Strangers yell.
Asses get grabbed. And that's the way it is.
I guess it is about time I moved to New
York.
Vanessa Bartsch is a junior majoring in
music. The whole world needs liberation, so
please, please, make it funky and get on the
good foot.
