You know when you're Stanford
men's tennis, and you win three out
of four titles at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championship.
Eight members of the Cardinal
team traveled to Ojai, Calif., last
weekend and left with one singles
and two doubles titles.
"It was a great weekend for us,"
said assistant coach John
Whitlinger. "We did a very good job
of playing our matches. We handled
them well."
Stanford had eight players enter
ing the two singles draws. I n the sec
ond flight, freshmen Alex Kim and
Scotty Scott, senior Charles Hoevel
er and sophomore Geoff Abrams
all competed for the title.
Hoeveler was the first to exit the
32-man draw, leaving in the round
of 16. Hoeveler lost 4-6, 2-6 to
UCLA's Jason Cook, who would

Alter a tough three-set battle,

Scott," said head coach Dick Gould.

"I started off the tournament a
little slow, but as I played each
match, I played a little better," Kim
said. "But the last match, I played
terribly."
Kim lost to Cook just last week in
Los Angeles, and he said he saw this
as a chance for revenge. But he
couldn't pull through.
"I lost to Jason last time at
UCLA, and I really wanted to get
him back," Kim said. "He played
well, to his credit, but I never gave
myself a chance. I made a lot of er
rors."
