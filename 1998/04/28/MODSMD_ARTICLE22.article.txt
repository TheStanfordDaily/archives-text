You know when you're Stanford
men's tennis, and you win three out
of four titles at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championship.
Eight members of the Cardinal
team traveled to Ojai, Calif., last
weekend and left with one singles
and two doubles titles.
"It was a great weekend for us,"
said assistant coach John
Whitlinger. "We did a very good job
of playing our matches. We handled
them well."
Stanford had eight players enter
ing the two singles draws. I n the sec
ond flight, freshmen Alex Kim and
Scotty Scott, senior Charles Hoevel
er and sophomore Geoff Abrams
all competed for the title.
Hoeveler was the first to exit the
32-man draw, leaving in the round
of 16. Hoeveler lost 4-6, 2-6 to
UCLA's Jason Cook, who would

eventually take the title.
Alter a tough three-set battle,
Abrams could not get by UCLA's
Noah Newman, losing 3-6, 6-3, 3-6
in the quarterfinals.
In the semifinals, doubles part
ners Kim and Scott met. Kim pre
vailed, winning 5-7,6-3,6-2, but not
before Scott made a good run, forc
ing Kim to a competitive three-set
match.
"1 was really pleased with Scotty
Scott," said head coach Dick Gould.
"He had a couple of really nice wins
before losing to Alex."
In the finals, Kim took on Cook
but lost in two sets 6-1,6-1.
"I started off the tournament a
little slow, but as I played each
match, I played a little better," Kim
said. "But the last match, I played
terribly."
Kim lost to Cook just last week in
Los Angeles, and he said he saw this
as a chance for revenge. But he
couldn't pull through.
"I lost to Jason last time at
UCLA, and I really wanted to get
him back," Kim said. "He played
well, to his credit, but I never gave
myself a chance. I made a lot of er
rors."
In the main singles draw, sopho

the Pac-10 title.

round of 16, Stanford still had three of
the four players in the semifinals.
Bob Bryan and Wolters met in the
semifinals, competing in a close duel
a competition Gould called "a
great, exciting match, great to watch
from the spectator's point of view."
Bryan and Wolters struggled
through a three-setter, with Bryan
winning the first set 6-3 and Wolters
squeezing by in the next two 7-6,7-6.
Goldstein made his way to the fi
nals by improving his performance in
each win against players from Cali
fornia and IJSC.
"Paul was shaky the first day, but
got a little better eaeh day," Gould
said.
Doubles partners Goldstein and
Wolters faced off in the finals, and
Goldstein came out on top with an
impressive 6-1, 6-2 victory over his

teammate.
"It's the first time Paul has ever
won the singles title," Gould said.
"It's a nice way to end his West Coast
career."
In one flight of doubles competi
tion, Hoeveler and Abrams joined
forces, as did Kim and Scott. Both
teams made it to the semifinals, with
out losing a set along the way.
However, in the semifinals, Kim
and Scott ran into USC's tough pair
of Vince Allegre and Jason Cook,
eventually losing 6-3,6-2.
Stanford would have its revenge in
the finals, though, where Abrams and
Hoeveler met Allegre and Cook after
defeating a Cal duo in the semifinals.
The IJSC players fought for the title
but lost a break late in each set for a
final score of 7-5,7-5.
Gould said he was pleased with
the way Hoeveler and Abrams
played throughout the tournament,
particularly since this is Hoeveler's
last year.

In the other doubles flight, (iold
stein was paired as usual with
Wolters, while the Bryans competed
together. The Bryans cruised into the
finals, easily heating teams from ( al,
Washington and UCLA, hut Gold
stein and Wolters struggled. In the
semifinals, Goldstein and Wolters
were finally halted in a tough two-set
match against George Bastl and Kyle
Spencer of USC, losing 7-6,6-4.
When the Bryans took on Bastl
and Spencer in the finals, it took them
only two sets to finish off the Trojan
duo. The twins won 7-6,6-3.
Gould said he was proud of the
team for playing hard all season.
"I kept waiting for the guys to let
down," he said. "It would have been
tough to go down there and lose a
bunch of matches right at the end of
the season, but that didn't happen."
The Cardinal players have three
weeks before they head off to
Athens, Ga., for their next challenge
— the NCAA championship.
