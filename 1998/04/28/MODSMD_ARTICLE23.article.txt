Cardinal duo bruised a UCLA
squad 6-2. 6-0 and an Oregon squad
6-1,6-1.
"In doubles we played really
well, the best we have played in a
while," Bles/ynski said. "Alter we
lust to UCLA, we went into a slump.
We had no confidenee. and we
weren't playing well. But we had a
turnaround at Arizona.
"It looks like we are out of the
slump, and hopefully we will be

ready for NCAAs." she said.

a lot of confidence, and the next
couple of girls I had beaten before,
so I felt good about those."
