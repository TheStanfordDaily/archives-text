Tonight's game against Cal Poly-

1 Stanford baseball team's quest for
the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division crown.

BASEBALL
â–  Tonight: No. 1 Stanford (36-8-1)
vs. ( ill Poly-SLO (16-35), 7 p.m..
Sunken Diamond. RADIO: KZ.SU
(90.1 FM)

In fact, the 7 p.m. nonconference
contest at Sunken Diamond will
only give the C 'ardinal an opportuni
ty to improve its overall record and
give it a break from the tight confer
ence race.
With only two weeks remaining
in the race for the 1998 Pac-10 Con
ference Southern Division baseball
title, the heat is on.
In fact, it's almost reached a boil
ing point.
Three schools are grappling for
the division lead. The No. 1 Cardinal
(36-8-1, 18-6 Six-Pac) currently
stands on top by half of a game over
No. II USC (35-13, 19-8) and one
game over No. 15 Arizona State (27-
14,18-8).
The title chase is reminiscent of
the 1994 season when Stanford won

the division with a 21-9 mark, fol
lowed by Arizona State (20-10) and
USC (19-11).
All three schools are also no
strangers to Six-Pac titles, as they
have combined to win the last five:
Stanford and USC have two titles
each, and Arizona State has one.
In fact, the three schools also
have captured 14 of the 19 confer
ence titles since the Six-Pac was
formed in 1979. Stanford grabbing
six, Arizona State five and USC
three.
But none of that will be changed
by tonight's game against Cal Poly-
SLO. The Mustangs (16-35,7-15 Big
West Conference) most recently
dropped a three-game series to UC-
Santa Barbara, culminating in a 18-
11 loss on Sunday.
Although the Cardinal leads the
series against the Mustangs 13-1,
Stanford narrowly pulled off a 4-3
win against the veteran Cal Poly-
SLO squad a year ago.
The Cardinal had settled into the
top of the ninth clinging to a 3-2 lead.
Then-sophomore reliever Tony
( ogan. who had shot down the Mus
tangs in the seventh and eighth to
protect the Cardinal lead, stood on
the mound to close out the game.
Mustang left fielder K.J. Radler,
the first batter Cogan faced in the in
ning, would not go quietly. Radler
sliced the ball up center field for a
single.
Cogan remained undeterred,
knocking down the next two batters.
With pinch runner Andrew Watt

inching off first, second baseman
Scott Kidd bombed a two-strike
pitch into center field for an RBI
double.
Going into the bottom of the
ninth, the game stood tied 3-3.
Enter then-sophomore center
fielder Jody Gerut, who rocketed an
offering from Mustang reliever
Mike Zirelli over the left-center

field fence to win the game.
"Last year, they gave us a tough
game." said sophomore catcher
Damien Alvarado. "We won't take
them lightly. Hopefully we can just
duplicate what we did" against Cal
Sunday.
"We're not looking past anybody
at this stage," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess.
