minutes of the game. Once again,

punch with an early goal.
However, the Golden Bears

the fiOth minute, salvaging a 1-1
tie.
lhe team continued to look
good in the first half against Cal."
Hermi/ said. "We had a hit of a
lapse toward the end of the game,
hut overall, it was a good week
end."
While the games had no signifi
cance in terms of regular season
standings, the players continued to
play hard, sharpening skills and
working on key aspects.
"()bviouslv, we want to win the
game no matter what," Hermiz
said. "It's still competitive. But

whatever the outcome, it's a good
chance for us to try new things and
just get people playing again."
With the regular season still
months away, the squad finds a
number of things to practice,
leant defense and finishing are
two areas of attention for head
coach Steve Swanson.
L.ineup shuffling is also com
mon in spring games such as these,
especially since the team is losing a
number of seniors, including Her
miz and co-captains Emily Burt
and Elie Foster. Many players are
getting field time, and a number of
them are trying different posi
tions.
"With injuries and other things,
we're trying a lot of things with the
lineup — not necessarily position
battles but rather just switching
things around," Hermiz said.
Among those not playing is ju
nior midfielder Christy Stoffel,
who was named next year's co
captain with Adamson. Stoffel is
currently studying in England and
will rejoin the team before the
start of the fall season.
The Cardinal continues spring
training with another home game
Sunday against Colorado College.
