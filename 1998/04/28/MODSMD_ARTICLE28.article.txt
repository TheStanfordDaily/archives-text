After suffering a defeat at the
hands of Oregon State last week
end, the Stanford crew team looks
to rebound this weekend in Hig
Row, the Cardinal's only home
event of the season.

CREW
■ Saturday: Stanford vs. California,
10 a.m.. Redwood Shores.
■ Saturday: Stanford vs. Kansas, 4
p.m., Redwood Shores.
■ Sunday: Stanford vs. Washington
State, 10 a.m., Redwood Shores.

The Cardinal was defeated by
one of the better teams in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference in the loss to Ore
gon State. Stanford will likely battle
for a place in nationals with the
Beavers, as only two Pac-10 teams
will make an appearance.
Oregon State swept the Cardinal
as victors in all six races last Satur
day at Vancouver Lake.
The men's novice lost by nearly
eight seconds, the women's varsity
and novice each bv about seven sec

onds, the women's second varsity by
more than five seconds, and both
the men's varsity and second varsity
by more than four seconds.
Both the men's and women's
varsity boats were hindered by colli
sions with buoys.
"It was probably the best race
we've ever had, but we hit a buoy,
then caught up and hit another
buoy," said sophomore Lauren
Russell. "It's a good sign that we've
improved a lot that we were able to
come back after hitting them."
In the last race between the
women's varsity teams, the Cardi
nal was defeated by only a length.
"The last time the varsity raced
Oregon State, we won." said fresh
man Joey Elger, "so the race at Pac
l()s (May y-10) should be close."
Stanford will have its hands lull
this weekend. The Card begins Sat
urday at 10 a.m. with races against
California, followed by Kansas at 4
p.m. and Washington State Sunday
at 10 a.m.. All races will be held at
Redwood Shores.
"Cal is in the top two in the coun
try for both men's and women's
crew, so it will be difficult," Elger
said, "but we should have success
with the other two."
