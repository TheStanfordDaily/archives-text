One of the less popular career areas for
minorities and women has traditionally
been engineering.
The Stanford chapter of Society of
Women Engineers hopes it) change that
trend by hosting their third annual "Ex
ploring New Worlds" conference this Sat
urday. Over 150 fourth- and fifth-grade
students from local elementary schools
are expected to attend, along with dozens
of parents and teachers.
The conference is especially aimed at
minority girls and enjoyed great success
last year, according to its organizers.
"Many of (the children] are underpriv

ileged. and we want to encourage them to
pursue careers in science and engineering
fields," said Tomtor Varutbangkul, a
sophomore majoring in chemical engi
neering and one of the conference orga
nizers.
"We want to let them know what's out
there," added Su-Wen Ueng, a sopho
more mechanical engineering majot who
also helped organize the event. "We are
giving them a chance to explore new
areas."
The conference begins with registra
tion and an opening ceremony I he chil
dren are then divided into groups ol 10,
each led by two Stanford volunteers. I he
students then attend three workshops.
These workshops are run by Stanford

professors and graduate students. I'hey
are highly interactive, spanning various
disciplines lopics range from genetics,
astronomy, robotics, developmental biol
ogy and bicycle technology to the more
traditional sciences such .is chemistry and
physics.
After lunch, the children arc encour
aged to apply their basic science skills and
incorporate planning and teamwork by
participating in a group-oriented compe
tition
" I'he purpose is to give the kids some
hands on experience with engineering.

tion and be creative," Ueng added.
At the end of the day, the win
ners of the competition receive
awards. Additionally, the society
presents each child with a special
certificate acknowledging their
participation in the conference.
The conference is sponsored by
various companies and depart
ments. It also receives funding
from the national Society of
Women Engineers. The first year
it was held, the conference won the
Saturn Award from the national
society for best event.

The national society consists of
chapters in prestigious and engi
neering-oriented academic institu
tions. According to the society's
Web site, its foremost goal is to
"expand the image of the engi
neering profession as a positive
force in improving the duality of
life and demonstrating the value of
diversity."
Last year, over 160 children
from seven schools attended the
conference, and Varutbangkul
and Ueng also have high hopes for
this year.
"It was a joy just to see it come
together." Varutbangkul said.
"It's a good feeling to see the kids
have fun."
