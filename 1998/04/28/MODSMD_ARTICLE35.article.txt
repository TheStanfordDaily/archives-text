m ored of the exquisite
favorites which await in
Dining Services? For those
ready to venture off campus, there is one
food which is filling, hip and healthy,
beautiful yet functional: the salad.
A myriad of restaurants packed into
downtown Palo Alto offer a thousand varia
tions of the Dinner of the Year for the strag
gling college student. I took upon myself a
quest to find some of the many tasty, color
ful and best-priced salads located on or
around University Avenue that will help all
struggling vegetarian students who need a
night away from the garhanzo beans and
fat-free honey mustard dressing of Flo Mo.
One's first stop on the salad track must
be at the salad gums, Pluto's, who call
themselves "Fresh food for a hungry
Universe." Consistently packed and reason

ably priced, Pluto's (on University, between
Kipling Street and Cowper Street) is the
quintessential salad maker. It's decorated
in aerospace style with bathrooms entitled
"cosmonaut" and "cosmonette" to boot.
Pluto's offers a variety of fresh toppings that
range from the usual carrots, mushrooms
and cucumbers to unique flavors such as
grilled fennel, steak, jicama. sweet walnuts
and roasted peppers.
Not only can the avid salad eater devel
op their own healthy masterpiece, but
Pluto's features a variety of specials
designed to accompany one's salad that are
priced under $2. These tasty side orders
include button mushrooms, grilled egg
plant and smashed spuds of the day. Such a
variety of goodies at w ell under $ 10 a meal
most definitely makes Pluto's a haven for
salad makers.
