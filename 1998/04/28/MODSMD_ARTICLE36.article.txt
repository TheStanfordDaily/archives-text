One of the things we all learn at the Farm is
that most of our really important, life-lesson
learning experiences are not going to happen in
a classroom. We know it because it happens to
all of us.
Sure, intellectual epiphanies and cathartic
career-defining moments are going to happen
under the tutelge of our extraordinary faculty.
But the ones that matter most, the experiences
that define who we are and how we move on with
our lives, come from the most random, unex
pected directions. Like interactions with your
roommates, or dance and music performances
by friends.
What goes for the in-class/outside-class situa
tion, goes for the on-campus/off-campus relation
ship as well. If you want to make the most of your
college education, you're going to have to get off
the Farm once in a while.
The Bay Area is an amazing place to go to
school. We've got mountains, oceans, deserts
and metropolis within a few hours' drive. More
forms of art and music flourish in San Francisco
than you could encompass if all you did was try
to catalog them.
That diversity is also present on campus, and
it holds an enticing lure that often gets the better
of us. Why leave the comfort of the Farm, with its
readily accesible hills, lake and palm trees?
Because you can. The Foothills are not the
Sierra Nevada Mountains, Lake Lag is not the
Pacific Ocean, and the palm trees aren't redwoods.
Don't let the Stanford campus become an
island. Find good places on University Avenue to
take friends for salads and explore the great vari
ety of movie theaters on the Peninsula. Spend the
day in San Francisco, walk along Columbus Ave
and play in the Exploratorium. Take a trip to Point
Lobos. Or go fly a kite.
Stanford will be here when you take off for a
weekend, and it will be here when you get back.
The libraries will still be open when you expect
them to be. And the post office will still be slow
with its mail delivery.
So relax, do something unusual, and get your
self off the farm. 112
