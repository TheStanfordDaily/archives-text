For those searching for the healthy hut
exotic meal, another salad option is Zao's
Noodle Bar on University between Raniona
Street and Emerson Street. Although it is pri
marily a noodle bar, Zao's offers three exquis
ite salads to choose from, all of which arc
unique in flavor and taste and low in fat.
"Zao's is a great place because it is
hip and casual. Sometimes you want a
high-energy lunch, and you just do not
want to eat a burrito," said Adam Wilner,
a waiter at Zao's.
It's true here; Zao's provides the high
energy without the burrito. Among Zao's fans,
the Zao chicken salad with rumen noodles is
the most popular dish, while the staff favors
the seared cilantro salad and the broth and
buckwheat salad. Salad sizes and prices are
comparable with Pluto's: all three salads are
entree dishes and ring in under $10.
Another top spot is California Pizza

Kitchen Located a block off of University
on Cowper Street, CPK (as it is known by its
fans) offers both the simple pizza and a vari
ety of diverse greens.
"Among the most popular of our salads is
the barbecue Chicken Chopped Salad,"
explains Adam, a host at CPK. The barbecue is
not as light of a salad as one might find at
Zao's or Pluto's, since it consists of chips and
jack cheese with tomatoes, scallions, black
beans, jicama and sweet corn piled on.
For those looking for the classic side of
salads, you can grab CPK's Caesar salad with
creamy Caesar dressing and garlic croutons.
Other favorites at CPK include the Original
(chopped salsa with basil, salami, and
cheese, tomatoes, scallions and chopped
garbanzo), the Mediterranean salad (mixed
greens, bell peppers, mild goat cheese and
sun-dried tomatoes with a lemon-herb
dressing) or the more mundane original

mixed leaf (garlic-herb croutons and shaved
Romano cheese).
For those craving the quick taco salad fix,
head all the way down to Rock'N Tacos at
the corner of Cowper Street and University.
The burrito and smoothie shop also offers
two salads, both under $5, which makes for
one of the best buys in downtown Palo Alto.
Salads, both with vegetarian or chicken
options, come in a tortilla filled with fresh
green leaf lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, avocado,
cheese and beans and rice. Worried about
your fruit intake? Rock'N Tacos also offers a
variety of flavorful smoothies to accompany
your salad, such as the Fruitilicius All Fruit, a
fat-free drink with raspberries, strawberries,
blueberries, peaches, bananas and fresh
squeezed orange juice.
So grab a friend and get off the Farm for
a quick lunch or dinner. You have more
salad options than you realize. â–¡
