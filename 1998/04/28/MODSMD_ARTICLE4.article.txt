# Investment changes still goal

Students hoping to make Stan
ford's investment policies more "so
cially responsible" are continuing
and building upon last year's well
publicized efforts. Some students in
volved in the process, however, ex
pressed concern over the slow
progress of the movement.
The key points of the current pro
posal involve hiring a student re

searcher to look into companies' em
ployment practices and allocating
roughly 5 to 10 percent of endow
ment money to be invested by fund
managers. I he managers specialize
in creating socially responsible port
folios, said senior Brian Babcock,
who was one of the students who te
vised the proposal before submitting
it this year.
As part of the effort to address stu
dent concerns about socially respon
sible investing, the Stanford Manage

ment Company, a private corpora
tion that manages Stanford's asset
pool, periodically meets with mem
bers of the Stanford community
through the Advisory Panel on In
vestment Responsibility.
A representative group of stu
dents and faculty, the panel allows
members to articulate concerns re
garding University investments. The
body was originally created in the
1970s in response to University in
vestments in apartheid-era South

Africa. Along with Ihe panel, a Spe
cial Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility convenes periodically to
consider the advisory panel's recom
mendations
Iwo undergraduates and two
graduate students sit on the commit
tee. along with alumni and profes
sors. Linda Kimball, manager of in
vestment responsibility at Stanford
Management, said she and the Board
of Trustees consider the policy rec
ommendations of the panel and use
the criterion of proven "substantial
social injury" in determining when
divesting is appropriate.
This year, students have revised
previous proposals for the creation of
a socially responsible endowment
fund. Nick Thompson, Class of '97,
and senior Kelly Naylor submitted a
draft of such a proposal last year,
which was rejected by SCIR.
The revised proposal is signifi
cantly different from the proposal
submitted by Thompson and Naylor,
and the "ideas are more precise," ac
cording to sophomore Christie Lar
son. who sits on the advisory panel.
Babcock was on the team of students
who revised last year's proposal.
"Alter the SCIR rejected the ini
tial proposal, they submitted to us a
list of several points of contention.
We tried to address those points in
our revisions." he said.
"Students have been diligent in
the process of revising the proposal,"
Kimball said. "We're still in the
process of discussion. We've spent
three or more meetings on this. The
original proposal is down to two
points, and hopefully we'll come to
some agreement."
Kimball also added that there has
been a "good airing" of ideas during

the meetings.
Larson said she is frustrated with
the panel's reluctance to actively
shape endowment standards. Faced
with complex issues such as defining
"socially responsible" investing and
comparing the performance of so
cially responsible investments with
those currently in Stanford's portfo
lio. the committee has failed to act.
she said. "The [advisory panel] is re
luctant to make a decision unless
they have to," Larson said. "Even if
you're facing issues that are not black
and white, you can still act."
Other universities, such as the
University of Wisconsin, have acted
swiftly to implement progressive in
vestment standards. In early March.
Duke University adopted a "Sweat
shop Code" that ultimately aims to
eliminate the use of sweatshop labor
altogether from the manufacture of
Duke's merchandising products
In contrast, Larson said, "Stan
ford is so, so reluctant to divest.
There are huge institutional barriers.
"The University wants to avoid
setting a precedent for having to an
swer to public concerns," she said.
" They don't want to be expected to
act on every concern."
To some extent, that makes some
sense for functional reasons given the
large number of concerns in the com
munity, Larson said. However, she
added, that does not eliminate the
need to improve University invest
ment standards.
