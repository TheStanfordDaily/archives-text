A jungle of light, sound and life, San
Francisco's Exploratorium can leave you
somewhat dazed.
Oh, it's fun. The Exploratorium is a great
place to play a little, learn a little and generally
get in touch with your inner child.
But trying to do all of that in one afternoon
may not be the best idea. Perhaps I'm simph
getting old, but I couldn't quite hear, see or
walk straight after three hours of sensory bom
bardment from the hands-on museum's luin
dreds of exhibits.
So when you go to the Exploratorium, tr\ ii
out one little, fascinating bit at a time
And each bit is fascinating. A standard chil
dren's museum on a more grandiose scale, the
Exploratorium succeeds in its ultimate mission of
teaching about science, art and human percep
tion without alienating its customers, most of
whom are too short to ride on your average
amusement park roller coaster.
Each exhibit features a short, clear exphuia
tion of the scientific principle behind it. An after
noon in the museum offers a crash course in
physics, biology and several forms of engineer
ing. Any Stanford techie will recognize the b.isis
of more than one lab on the museum s sprawl
ing grounds.
Just about anyone will admit, however, that
the science is only a justification for the fun stuff.
Who wants to read a textbook when you can be
touching, listening and doing instead?
It's the unique experience of actually I'xfH'
riencing the Exploratorium that makes it differ
ent from any other museum. You can write a
four-part harmony, build the St. Louis arch,
walk inside a kaleidoscope and freeze your
shadow on a screen.
Computers, lenses, circuits and building
blocks help you explore the basic senses by
testing your perfect pitch, your ability to
match colors perfectly and your sense of
direction as vou feel vour way through the
