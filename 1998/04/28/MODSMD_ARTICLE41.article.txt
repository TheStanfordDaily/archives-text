# the 						Exploratorium

pitch-black tactile dome. Optical illusions
give your brain a workout.
A new show opening in May will delve deep
er into the brain with 40 exhibits related to
memory. Opening May 22 and continuing
through January 1999, the exhibit will include
such notable attractions as "Hoop Nightmares,"
in which prism glasses alter your body's memo
ry of how to throw a ball, as well as several tests
of memory in images, tastes and smells.
To go along with the museum's many organic
exhibits — chick embryos, plants, tropical fish —
the memory show includes a human brain in a jar
and dissections of sheep brains.
Not all of the new material will be for touch-

ing: Artists have put together presentations aimed
at remembering the atomic bombing of Nagasaki
in World War II and comparing street scenes in
photographs taken 40 years apart. Storytellers
will demonstrate the importance of memory,
while a video will explain a man's struggle to
reconstruct his memory after a stroke.
Those show the serious side behind the
Exploratorium, which largely allows you to for
get the problems of the real world as you learn
about its substructures instead.
As a consequence, everything looks a little
different when you leave. Suddenly you know
how to recreate the rainbow your watch projects
on the wall, and you can picture the engine of
your car as its gears work in harmony to take you
back down the Peninsula.
You and a friend, preferably. If you're that
dazed, you may need someone to help you out. Q
