# ... A Damn
## Good Guide 
### Jennifer Godwin 
There's a lot to be said for renting a
movie. You can use the rewind button
when you miss a line, you can use the
pause button when you have to go to the bath
room, and the food is guaranteed to be
cheaper. But there's nothing like going to the
movies. Driving out to the theater, negotiating
popcorn sizes and candy choices, settling
down to talk before the lights dim.
If you've been feeling like Flicks and
Hollywood Video aren't enough, and you want
to see a movie, you've got a big variety of
choices in the area ranging from multiplexes
to movie palaces that feature everything from
silent epics to the latest helicopter-chase heavy
action flick.
Despite El Nino's disinterest in our collec
tive possibility of tanning, the sun will come
out someday. The skies will be clear blue, and
the nights will be starry and warm. What better
way to spend a weekend night than at a drive
in? The Burlingame 4 Drive-In is the last of
its kind on the Peninsula. Drive-ins peaked in

popularity in the late

1960s when they
numbered some
220 in California.
The numbers have
dwindled to a little
more than a hun
dred in the state as of

1987. But the
Burlingame 4 continues

on, taking advantage of

our (supposedly) sunny California clime by
playing first-run commercial films throughout
the year. The sound for the films is available
through the traditional car speakers or a low
power FM broadcast. Tuesdays nights are bar
gain nights, at $3 a person. The best part of the
deal is supposed to be the pizza, "fresh and
made to order." The drive from Stanford on
the 101 takes about half an hour.
Heading south from Stanford, we come to
the charming metropolis of San Jose, which
boasts among its cinematic attractions the
Camera Theaters. The Camera One and
Camera Three offer a range of "indepen
dent" features while the Towne has older
movies, presentations and festivals. The Towne
is an art deco-style theater from the 1920s that
has been divided into three screens and fea
tures a Mighty Wurlitzer organ with 1,156
pipes. Bob Vaughn, an 84-year-old man who
originally played organs in theaters in the late
19205, accompanies the Silent Film Classic
Series, presented one Sunday a month.
Upcoming features include "The Iron Mask"
with Douglas Fairbanks, "The Battleship
Potemkin" and"The Eagle" with Rudolph
Valentino. Visit their Web page at www.camer
anet.com/.
The Film Arts Foundation is famous
worldwide for its provision of equipment and
moral support for up-and-coming filmmakers.
This is happily supplemented with screenings
for those who are up-and-coming filmgoers.
The Foundation presents Short Film and Video

Programs the last Thursday of every month at
111 Minna Street Gallery (at Second St.) in
San Francisco. Last month, the feature was
"The Wild Kingdom," a series of animal-relai
ed shorts. April 30 is themed "High-heeled
Boodeg" and considers the question of what it
means to be a woman and / or a lady. Visit
www.filmaits.org/ to find out more about the
screenings, including information such as
"Tickets available at the door. Drinks available
at the bar."
The easiest way to box office-topping
movies is both north and south at the Centun
theaters: Century Park Redwood is in
Redwood City (shockingly enough) and has
12 screens. The Century Cinema 16 lvas 16
screens (shockingly enough) and is located in
Mountain View. The Centuries are your stan
dard-issue multiplexes; it's impossible to park,
the fountains are kind of a nice touch, and
you'll probably run into your friends there on
a Saturday night. Try not to be too afraid of the
concession stand / grocery store thing.
Further down El Camino to the south, near
the San Jose airport and Great America is the
cushy new AMC Mercado 20. The theater
chain that first brought you armrest cuphold
ers seems to have perfected the multiplex envi
ronment. The decor belongs in a mid-1980s
teen sitcom, but they have huge comfortable
seats with movable armrests (so you can cud
dle with your loved one), big screens and stu
dent ticket prices.
Closer to home, the Landmark Theater chain



offers six screens of independent and foreign
films at their four arthouses: the Palo Alto
Square at HI ('.amino Real and Page Mill Road,
The Aquarius in downtown Palo Alto and the
Guild and the Park theaters in Menlo Park
across from Kepler's, near Santa Cruz Avenue. The
Guild and the Park are historic theaters, built in
the 1920s and »os, respectively.
Originally known as the Menlo. the Guild
was first advertised in local papers as a vaude
ville theater, but John Mover, a manager at the
(iuild, says, "We're pretty sure it was a bur
lesque house." The Park has a huge barrel
vaulted ceiling, the largest silver screen in
California and architectural details that evidence
its art deco heritage. Both the Aquarius and the
Square feature art in the stead of architectural
detail — the Square takes a Celtic theme with
large wall hangings, while the Aquarius features
murals depicting the lost world of Atlantis.
Additionally, the Aquarius adds to Palo Alto's
night life with its weekly Midnight Movies
offered from May to September.
The showpiece of Peninsula moviegoing is
probably the restored Stanford Theater, a
palace featuring atmosphere Moorish-Spanish
interior decor, inexpensive ticket and conces
sion prices, a balcony and festivals of classic
Hollywood films. Restored during the l l )H()s by

David Packard of HP fame, the theater presents
themed festivals (the Hepburns, film noir, Fred
and Ginger) from the Golden Age of Hollywood
and silent features that take advantage of the
Wurlitzer organ and the talents of organist
Dennis James. Schedules are available online
at www.swixo.com/stanford.
Because of the movie palace atmosphere
and similar interest in presenting vintage film,
the Castro Theater is usually described as a
San Francisco version of the Stanford one. The
Spanish colonial style theater was built in 1922
and alternates film festival exhibitions with var
ious film series. In the coming weeks, the
Castro will be the site for Spike and Mike's
Classic Festival of Animation, the 41st San
Francisco International Film Festival and a
week of films titled "Kiss Me Deadly: The
Femme Fatale on Film." Visit their Web site at
www.thecastro.com.
If this isn't enough for you, there are many
more hidden movie options in the Stanford
environs. Keep an eye on mailing lists for
screenings, check out the Intermission calen
dar for events in Palo Alto, and if worse comes
to worst, drag your five closest friends to Meyer
Library, check out a video, settle into those
comfy orange chairs and enjoy the show. □
