# Buongiorno: A Day in North Beach
## 
### Kerry Shaw 
In North Beach, all it takes to pass through
Chinatown to Little Italy to the red-light district
is a simple walk across the street.
That street is Columbus Avenue, and it's
where the city's ethnic neighborhoods and
night life converge into one of the quaintest
walks in town.
Enter Molinari's Deli and hear Italian
spoken in rhythmic Sicilian accents while you
wait for slices of the creamiest buffalo moz
zarella this side of Pisa.
Across the street, Ernie or Fred will try to
hustle you into watching two lesbians wrestle

each other. But there's no threat if you
choose to pass. Turn the other way, and you'll
end up at a McDonald's, where the menus are
all in Chinese.
But stick to the main road, and you'll find
there's enough to see on Columbus Avenue.
You'll probably have to save the Chinese flea
markets for your next visit.
Don't miss the city's most famous book
store, City Lights Bookstore, which has a
well-informed staff and cutting-edge magazine
selection. You'll find reads here that you might
not find anywhere else, but there's also a good

supply of mainstream works.
City lights may be one of the only book
stores that dares to not operate as a cafe, hut
fear not, caffeine freaks. City lights neighbors
two of the city's best coffee shops: Caffe
Greco and Cafe Puccini. Both have been
serving espressos and cappuccinos before
"star" and "bucks" even found each other.
Both establishments feature wicker baskets
filled with the day's newspapers and wide win
dows so you can people watch as you relax.
It's not unusual to see writers camped at the
tables, finishing articles from the San

Francisco Chronicle as they nibble biscotti.
Finish your drink, then head up the street
toward Coit Tower, the famous San Francisco
landmark. The site itself is nothing to write
home about, but the views of the city are
splendid. For a 30-minute trek, you get a
panoramic view that encompasses Alcatraz,
the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge.
If it's dusk or dark by the time you're done
walking, then you're in luck. That's when the
street really comes to life with people of all
ages ready to eat in one of the many Italian
restaurants. At Golden Spike, you'll get

bread, salad, antipasto, pasta and seafood and
spumoni for $10 in their special fixed-price
meal. The food's not great, but the restaurant
compensates with gargantuan portions and its
unusual decor: the walls and the ceilings are
covered with signed dollar bills.
The Stinking Rose is another eclectic
spot, where every dish on the menu (even the
ice cream!) contains garlic. It's one of the
most famous restaurants in San Francisco, and
it's not too costly. For $ 12, you get a nice meal
and fight cancer. L'Osteria, specializing in
northern Italian cuisine, is a good bet if you

actually care about the quality of the food.
They feature chicken and fish specialties. For
pizza, North Beach Pizza, located on Grant
St. (one street up from Columbus) serves
some of the city's finest. Expect to wait at least
a half hour at any of these places before get
ting seated.
To top off your meal, Ben and Jerry 's is
conveniently located on Columbus. Or walk into
any of the cafes and treat yourself to a tiramisu
and one of the many flavored biscottis.
After dinner, Club Fuga/i cooks up night
ly spoofs of whatever music is hot at the
