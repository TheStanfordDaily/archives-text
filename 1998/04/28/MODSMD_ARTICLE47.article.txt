# Flying the Wind: The Joy of Kites
## 
### Alicia McCann 
There is a new sport sweeping the nation
— it's growing in popularity and gaining a
large collection of devoted followers.
Fascinated by this bizarre new obsession, I
took the time to investigate. As I had been
warned, 1 was insiantly hooked. 1 can now con
sider myself... a kite flyer.
1 visited a store called Gone With the
Wind, which is located at Suite 200 on
Industrial Way in Belmont and specializes in
kites. This store is quite a find for the kite
lover, because Gone with the Wind is owned by
Dan Whitney, who has made kites his passion
for eight years.
When I first walked into the store, I was
expecting a sales pitch about different types of
kites. I was instead confronted by an enthusi
astic Whitney, who insisted that I could not
write an article about kite flying until I had
flown one myself.
"This is phenomenal," he said. "Just one
time up, and you'll be hooked." He was right. I
operated a two-line kite, and within minutes was
making it spin and twist in the air. I dien
watched Whitney fly, and became intrigued by
the limitless number of things that one can do
with a kite.
There are many places in this area where
kites can be purchased. Gone with the Wind, for
example, sells kites globally through the World
Wide Web at www.gwtw-kites.com. It even adver
tises that if it doesn't have what you want, it will
get it for you. The Web site also has a link to an
up-to-the-minute weather report and forecast
for your area.
A few other excellent stores include Kite
Flight on Pier 39 in San Francisco, Lunar
Wind Inventions at 330 Main St.in Half Moon
Bay, and Unlimited Flying Options Stunt
Kites at 1750 Briarwood Dr. in Santa Clara.
When it comes to locations to fly, Gone with
the Wind recommends Shoreline Park. I hap
pened to discover another fabulous location for

kite flying while driving through San Francisco:
an exquisite stretch of grass between the water
front and Marina Blvd., next to the San Francisco
Yacht Club. Other beautiful places to fly kites are
the Bavlands in Sunnyvale, lake Elizabeth in
Fremont, and Ocean Beach in San Francisco.
Closer to home, both the Wilbur and Roble fields
on the Stanford campus are good locations.
Brian Todd, an employee at Gone with the
Wind, offered beginners a bit of advice. One
should remember that the wind "is always blow
ing in a half-circle around you," he said. This
means that you need double the length of your
kite string in clear, unobstructed space around
you for safe flying.
There are several instructional videos that
can be purchased in any kite shop, as well as a
variety of kites designed to suit individual pref
erences. And no matter how good you

become, there's never a limit to the
number of tricks you can learn.
The sport is taken rather seriously
by some people. Kite tournaments are
held nationwide, with national champi
onships held annually. Regional tourna-

ments are held all year long, with competi
tors earning points towards national stand-

ings. Whiuiey, for example, placed second
at the 1996 American Kite Flyer's
Association National Championships
for Master's Pair Ballet kite flying. /
"I call it ice skating in the sky," '
Whitney explained proudly. He was
quick to point out that while Pair Ballet
kite flying involves a stylized, musical fly-

ing routine, there are many other creative
things that can be done with a kite.
A kite may be the more affordable option
for waterskiers who can't afford a boat. A
waterskier pulled by a kite in Berkeley was
clocked at moving at a speed of over 40 miles
per hour. Others have enjoyed racing with
kites attached to tricycle-like buggies, espe-

cially along the beach front.
I've always thought of kite flying as a day
time activity, but was shocked to leant that peo
ple enjoy flying at night as well. They do so by
connecting lights and batteries to their kites,
transforming the kites into dancing fireflies.
The sport allows for imagination and
creativity. After only a few minutes in the
air, I realized that flying kites was an

artistic and powerful experience,
one that everyone should try at
least once. So go ahead —

buy a kite, catch the
wind and feel the thrill
of defying gravity. □
