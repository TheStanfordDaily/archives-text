# Point Lobos
## State Reserve 
### Karin Marie West 
Strolling along the cliff-top trail and feeling
the sea spray in your face, it's hard to
believe that you are only an hour-and-a-half
away from the stress and hustle of the Stanford
campus and Silicon Valley.
Fortunately for Peninsula residents, the Point
Lobos State Reserve just south of Carmel pro
vides a safe and beautiful haven for not only
human visitors, but for the animal and ocean life
that dwell there.
fx>cal animals even lent their name to the site:
Spanish settlers called it "Punta de los lobos
Marinos" (Point ot the Sea Wolves) because of the
sea lions that roared from their rocky perches high
above the crashing waves.
Depending on how much time you have and

how scenic a drive you'd like to take, Point Lobos
can be reached from the San Jose area by a jaunt
down the Redwood tree-lined Highway 17 that
winds its way through the hiUs to Santa Cruz.
From there, Highway I takes travelers through
green fields and down the coast on a journey of
about an hour and 45 minutes. For those with
less time to spare, taking 101 down to Highway
156 will save about half an hour, but you'll also
miss the mountain scenery.
If you want the full tourist experience, stop
for a snack or lunch at Cannery Row or the
Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey before you contin
ue down to Carrnel and the reserve's entrance a
few miles south of town.
A $7 per vehicle fee grants you entrance to the

narrow road that winds through the reserve with
strategically placed parking lots allowing access to
various points of interest. If you're up for a half
mile or so hike, you can skip die $ 7 entrance fee
by parking along die highway and walking down to
the water's edge.
Nearly 8 miles of inviting, non-strenuous hik
ing trails wind along the cliffs and fields of the
reserve's 544 dry acres. If the pounding surf and
dark granite cliffs don't take your breath away,
then the salty ocean breeze that rushes off the
blue-green surf surely will.
If you are certified and have registered at the
reserve's entrance, diving in Bluefish Cove and
Whalers Cove allows you to take advantage of a
few of the 750 submerged acres that complete the

reserve's area. Added to the park in 1960, these
ocean-floor acres made up the first underwater
reserve in the nation.
The animals protected within the reserve's
boundaries are definitely a main attraction. For
example, the sight of a spout of mist on the hori
zon may greet you from offshore if you visit the
reserve between December and May. Forty-ton
gray whales pass 500 yards from the coast on their j|
migration from the northern Bering, Chukchi and
Beaufort Seas towards the warmer waters of the
Mexican California Baja.
A park highlight is the Sea Lion Point TVail,
which overlooks Headland Cove. Groups of
California sea lions and harbor seals can be seen
snoozing on the sand and blinking back at ogling

tourists from the sparkling water.
Further down the same trail, the barks and
growls of more sea lions and seals echo from the
white Sea lion Rocks that jut up several hundred
fed offshore. Between die rocks and the

shore, pounding waves that send sprav

Devil's Cauldron.

sea otters can be seen
frolicking all over the
place, under even the most

powerful waves. Whether using their chests to
break open the mollusks on which they feed, or to
earn their young pups that are born throughout
the year, these threatened creatures thrive in the

safety of the reserve's waters. â–¡
