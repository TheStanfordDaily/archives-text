# Company charged with managing Stanford's $6 million endowment

In an era when some believe that
universities can no longer afford to
focus on learning alone, Stanford
entrusts its financial future and $6
billion total asset pool to a private
company, the Stanford Manage
ment Company, located on the edge
of Sand Hill Road.
The nonprofit company was
formed in 1991 to oversee the in
vestment of the University endow
ment and its real estate assets, which
include the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, Stanford Research Park and the
area surrounding the Dish.
According to a recent annual re
port, the company currently invests
about 30 percent of endowment
money in domestic stocks, 23 per
cent in international, 17 percent in
"alternative investments" and 16
percent in real estate equity.
Alternative investments, the re
port said, include venture capital,
bankruptcy assets, arbitrage strate
gies and natural resources.
The performance of the compa
ny is gauged by its ability to meet
and surpass the benchmark figures
set for each type of investment.
Profits from investments go to fi

nance University operations and
the maintenance of buildings, said
Manager of Investment Responsi
bility Linda Kimball. The compa
ny's board of directors reports to the
Board of Trustees.
The investment philosophy of
the company is "to make sure we get
a reasonable return over a long peri
od of time," Kimball said.
According to Kimball, the com
pany has traditionally preferred to
turn funds over to smaller fund
managers.
Kimball also said that it main
tains this closer oversight over its in
vestments by choosing fund man
agers with strong performance
records over those that arc well
known for their large size.
Many other universities have
similar endowment management
schemes and forums for community
input in investment standards.
Duke University's endowment is
managed by the Duke Management
Corporation that has its own board
of directors who set target goals for
investment returns each year. Like
Stanford, Duke does not directly in
vest in companies, but instead, the
school turns its funds over to groups
such as J.P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch
and smaller fund managers.
