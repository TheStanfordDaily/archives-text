# Taxis lose house; four Greeks earn residences
## 
### Kelly Young Editorial staff 
Dean of Students Marc Wais an
nounced yesterday on behalf of the
Office of Student Activities and the
Office of Residential Education that
the Theta Xi fraternity will no longer
be housed at 717 Dolores St.
"It is with much regret that 1 an
nounce that Taxi did not meet their
housing occupancy for this year."
Wais said.
With the exception of a brief peri
od after the 1989 Loma Prieta Earth
quake, the Taxis have been housed at
that location since 1914.
The house is now available to stu
dents in the spring housing lottery.
Wais said the fraternity has failed
to attract a sufficient number of
members in the last three years. In

the past. (ireek or
ganizations had to
fill their houses
with 90-percent
m embership.
Hoarders were al
lowed to make up
the remaining 10
percent. Next year.

however, fraternities and sororities
must fill their houses with 100-per
cent membership.
The Taxi house holds 32 people.
After Rush, Taxi had 34 members, in
cluding IX pledges. However, due to
"certain circumstances," the number
of pledges dropped to 12. making the
fraternity unable to fill its housing re
quirement, said Taxi member Joe
Walsch.
Wais met with Taxi leaders Mon
day. "They fully acknowledged the

circumstances they were in. I hey
knew all along that there were certain
expectations they needed to meet.*'
he said.
Alumni expressed disappoint
ment at the decision.
â€¢'The alumni will certainly be dis
appointed and hope that they can get
their house back," said I axi alumnus
Tom Flemma, Class of '93, "It was a
big part of my Stanford experience.
Having the house is an important
thing to the alumni."
In addition, Wais and Res Ed Di
rector Jane Camarillo sent letters to
Kappa Alpha Order, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, Delta Delta Delta and
Kappa Alpha Theta informing them
that they will officially be housed next
year.
Deke President Mike Clrenier
said that his fraternity will be 31

members strong next year. Accord
ing to KA President Boh Baird, his
fraternity will havebl members, 52 of
whom are planning to live in the
house.
"We want to make our house a
place where people can go to, not just
for parties." Baird said.
As of April 22. the Thetas had re
ceived about 30 pledges, bringing the
sorority close to the 70-member limit.
At that lime, the Tri-Delts were also
nearing the limit. ATO and Alpha
Sigma houses each have approxi
mately 50 spaces available. This,
however, is not a problem because
some students may choose to study
abroad or forego Greek housing.

of dedicated effort and hard work by

Theta Xi lost their house at 717 Dolores St.yesterday due to their in
ability to fill the house with members.
our chapter." said Tri-Delt President
Sara Petersen. "Additionally, we
look forward to welcoming the Stan
ford community, and women in par
ticular. to the house for program
ming and other events."
"Both sororities did a great joh
during Rush." said Intersorority
Council President Melissa Chud.
"They actually went above and be
yond what the University expected."
Chud said that this decision
brightens the future for sororities.
"Every sorority will have the op
portunity to apply for housing next
year as well," she said, "and this is re
ally just a transition year."
Wais was also optimistic about the
future of campus Greek life. "I think
housed sororities on campus will en
hance both the Greek system and the

Residential Education program and
provide Stanford students with more
lifestyle choices," Wais said.
"I'm hopeful these developments
will serve to enhance the overall
health and vitality of the Greek com
munity," he added.
Grenier. however, was not
thrilled about the University's role in
the process.
" The University is clearly not as
supportive of the Greek system as it
is with other priority student hous
ing," Grenier said. "My experience
as Deke president indicates that var
ious offices within the administration
grudgingly accept the Greek system
in this University. Despite state
ments to t he contrary by the adminis
tration, this is not an indication of
goodwill but of diligence of Deke
members."
These recent developments
brings the number of next year's
housed Greek organizations to nine.
