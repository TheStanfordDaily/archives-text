MIAMI (AP) — A restaurateur accused of murdering a Florida tax
collector for freezing his bank account is on trial in Miami under Ital
ian law in front of eight Italian judges — the result of a tangled diplo
matic and legal dispute.
Pietro Vene/ia is charged with shooting Donald Bonham four times
on Christmas Eve 1993 as Bonham carried groceries into his North
Miami home.
Venezia, an Italian citizen, fled to Italy after the slaying and was
captured there in 1994. But Italian authorities, in an extraordinary turn
of events, refused to return him to the United States for fear he would
be executed. Italy does not have the death penalty.
Italy instead chose to put Venezia on trial in Italy. But when a key
witness, Bonham's widow, looked too ill to travel overseas to testify,
the Italians packed up the trial and brought it to Miami temporarily,
with testimony beginning here yesterday. The trial will eventually
resume in Italy.
At the federal courtroom where the U.S. portion of trial is taking
place, the eight Italian judges who will decide Venezia's fate are seat
ed in the jury box. Venezia remains in jail back in Italy.

NEW YORK (AP) — No need to rush on that bathroom break.
Chances are the commercials will still be on when you're done.
Prime-time television had more ads than ever last year, with the
amount of time devoted to commercials increasing by nearly two min
utes since the start of the decade, a study found.
The top four broadcast networks ran an average of 11 minutes, 12
seconds of commercials during each hour of prime-time last Novem
ber, up from 9:38 in November 1991, according to a report commis
sioned by two advertising trade groups.
Add in network promotions and public service announcements,
and there is just over 15 minutes of what ad agencies call' clutter" dur
ing a typical prime-time hour.
"My personal feeling is that they've pretty much maxed-out," said
Steve Grubbs of the BBDO advertising agency, which conducted the
study.
Networks have been forced to increase the number of commercials
to keep making money at a time when the "product" they sell to adver
tisers — the TV audience — is dwindling in size, Cirubbs said.
In addition to the extra commercial time, there's been a tendency
during the 1990s toward running shorter, 15-second ads. That means
viewers are inundated with more messages, and some advertisers are
concerned that theirs won't get through.
Fox led the major broadcasters with 15:54 of commercials and pro
motions during an average prime-time hour.
