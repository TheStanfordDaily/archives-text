# Pork-barrel bill could face veto
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate, following the House's lead,
approved legislation yesterday
imposing abortion restrictions on
the payment 0f5926 million in back
dues to the United Nations. The
White House quickly announced
President Clinton would veto the
bill, even though the U.N. payments
are a top priority.
The vote was a narrow 51 to 49.
Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott. R-Miss., warned that a veto
would be "a big mistake," and said
he doubted Clinton would get
another chance this year to get the
U.N. money through the Republi
can-led Congress. "In my opinion,
this is it," Lott told reporters.
But White House deputy press
secretary Barry Toiv said, "By
including this extraneous but con
troversial provision relating to fam
ily planning, the Congress leaves
the president no choice but to veto

the bill.
"We hope they will get the bill
up here quickly so the president can
veto it and we can move on to sepa
rating this issue from this essential
legislation, as it ought to be separat
ed," Toiv said.
The legislation also would
authorize an array ol State Depart
ment programs and reorganize the
foreign-policy bureaucracy.
The bill, which passed the
House last month, next goes to
Clinton. I'he thin margin ol
approval — where Democrats
opposing passage were joined by
Republicans who support abortion
rights — suggested a veto would be
sustained.
In remarks in the Rose Garden.
Clinton condemned Congress' fail
ure to provide payment of the back
IJ.N. dues without strings attached
or to approve his request for $18 bil
lion to help the International Mon

etary Fund ease the strains of the
Asian financial crisis.
"We think that different rules
apply to us and we have a right not
to pay our was so we can have this
light over an issue that is unrelated
to our I J.N. responsibilities or our
IMF responsibilities." the president
said. "I don't think that is a respon
sible. mature message to send to the
world by the leading country in the
world."
The United States risks losing
its voting rights in the I N. (iener
al Assembly if the long-delinquent
dues are not paid soon. I S. and
LJ.N. officials have warned
Congress. Still, the I S. position in
the Security Council, where it
holds veto power, would be unaf
fected.
The provision is the latest in a
string of abortion curbs conserva
tives in Congress have placed on
foreign-aid bills over the nast

decade. It would prohibit any U.S.
payments to the United Nations
from being used for international
tamilv planning groups that support
abortion rights, even if they use
their own money to lobby for abor
tion-law changes.
(iloria Feldt, president ol the
Planned Parenthood Federation of
America, tailed the Senate action
"very disheartening."
"The president should veto it.
I he president has said he will veto
it. We have no reason to believe he
will not veto it." Feldt said in an
interview.
Sen. Joseph Biden. D-Del.. the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee's senior Democrat, said Clinton
would sign the bill "in a Hash" if it
didn't contain the abortion restric
tions. calling the Republican action
"legislative blackmail."
But Republican leaders urged
Clinton to sign the bill.
