WASHING I ON (AP) — China
has been able to buy billions in
weapons despite a U.S.-led embar
go imposed after the 1989 Tianan
men crackdown, says a congression
al report. It points to Russia and
Israel as top sellers to Beijing.
Meanwhile, military and high
tech sales to China are expected to
increase as European nations con
sider lilting the embargo and the
Clinton administration moves to
ease restrictions on exports of
supercomputers and satellites,
Harold Johnson, author of the
report, told lawmakers yesterday.
Johnson, an associate director of
the General Accounting Office,

Congress' investigative arm. said
defense companies in the European
Union are facing "severe economic
pressures" to deal with China,
whose human rights record is said
to be improving.
"We found that at least two EIJ
members are now reassessing
whether the embargo should be
continued," Johnson told a Joint
Economic Committee hearing,
later identifying them as Italy and
Spain.
If that happens. China, which has
been modernizing its defenses since
the mid-1980s, could speed the pro
cess. although its forces still lack the
training and expertise needed to be

a world military power, he said
The GAO report is based on an
eight-month examination of public
information. Johnson said.
Among its findings:
—Of $5.3 billion in public arms
sales to China from 1990 through
1996. Russia accounted lor nearh
72 percent, or $3.8 billion.
The Middle East was responsi
ble for 17 percent of military sales
to China, mostly from Israel, for a
total of about $9(X) million.
The United States, honoring
contracts signed before the June
1989 crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen
Square, was responsible for $37.1

million in arms sales in the IWO-yn
period. And nearly a dozen presi
dential waivers allowed $307.4 mil
lion in commercial deals requiring
sensitive export licenses, mostly foi
commercial satellites.
As a result, the I .S.-share of mil
itary items sold to China was b.f
percent.
\\ illiam Reinsch, undersecretary
of commerce for export administra
tion. told lawmakers China poses ;
difficult problem because the U.S
government wants to control Bei
jing's access to military materials,
but also wants to allow American
companies to compete with foreign
high-tech firms.
