University should provide
more resources to develop
balance in students' lives

IN A WORLD where success must
be achieved by any means, even at
the expense of personal time, rela
tionships or finances, we need to
remember that balance is as important
to our health and happiness as success.
We operate 24 hours a day. seven
days a week. We ean communicate to
the world by a simple e-mail, eonduet
business from our cars with cellular
phones and access information via
radio modems while sunning our
selves. Soon we will be able to hyper
link our physical world with virtual
glasses that will be attached to com
puter screens in our trousers.
In keeping with this trend, Stanford
has been transforming our education
into a vocational training process. The
idea is to prepare students to be func
tioning members of 21st-century soci
ety. As written in Hanipden-Turners
book, "Riding the Ways of Culture."
American business culture suggests
that success is achieved if we emulate
the machines we work with —
focused, unemotional and mechanical
to improve productivity.
But in our lush to prepare for the
real world, have we ignored the issue
of balance in our lives? What about
the simple things we often take for
granted? An intimate conversation
with a friend. A moment to cry about
a failed relationship. An evening spent
watching the sunset in stunned silence.
Three hours spent reading a good
book. A loud, raucous dinner with
irrepressible relatives.
On November 11, 1885, Leland
Stanford's vision of Stanford Universi
ty was laid into place with the execu
tion of the founding Grant. In a

defense of liberal education that was
remarkable for its time, Stanford told
a reporter. "1 attach great importance
to general literature for the enlarge
ment of the mind and for giving busi
ness capacity ... Technically educated
boys do not make the most successful
businessmen. The imagination needs
to be cultivated and developed to
assure success in life."
Has the administration honored
our Founding Father's wish to create
students who not only are productive
citizens, but are also able to enjoy and
appreciate life's beauty? How capable
is the bright engineer or business lead
er when all he or she can talk about is
IP protocols and network connectivi
ty? How skilled is the author who has
focused in one specialty and refuses to
use e-mail?
Rather than just including the
Founding Grant on the Stanford Web
site and in recruiting literature, I ask
the administration to demonstrate its
commitment to these principles by
supporting programs that enrich stu
dents' lives beyond the skills of their
majors. Programs such as the Drama
Department, the Music Department
and the Dance Division providerich
cultural experiences that are key in
developing students into whole, func
tioning members of society. These pro
grams should receive greater funding,
staffing and resources.
The administration needs to focus
on the business needs of operating
Stanford Inc. The tangible profit from
these expenditures does not come in
the form of cost savings or revenue
increases. Thinking outside of the box
often provides advantages that will
stimulate improvement. The intangi
ble benefits of supporting these pro
grams are often immense — and will
have positive repercussions long into
Stanford's next century.
