## Pine vs. elm: e-mail dilemmas 
### 
Yesterday i
checked my e
mail. For the third
day in a row, I had no new
mail. 1 panicked. I imme
diately thought the server
was down. The real prob
lem was not the lack of
incoming mail, but rather

the dearth of outgoing mail. 1 had a ton of
people to write to, but it's so hard to write
messages when you don't have new mail.
This week, as the San Francisco Chroni
cle lists the most successful S(H) Silicon Val
ley companies, I've felt the need to reprende
e-mail's intrusion into our lives. I've been
rethinking all the painstakingly crucial deci
sions it forces us to make.
Pine vs. Elm: This is a classic chicken and
egg dilemma, and there is no right answer.
Some will say Eudora; others prefer Web
based e-mail. The important thing is to get a
lifetime free account. Attention freshmen
— all you have to do is sign up to be a com
puter science major and you're set. Some of
you are thinking you don't wanna major in
CS ... who cares!? Just register, wait a year,
and then de-register. In the meantime
they'll set you up with an @cs account that
they'll forget to take away when you drop
the major! Yahoo!
Picking your username: Two years ago
during fall quarter finals I was on a waiting

list for a computer at Meyer Library. There
1 was with a horde of fellow students, wait
ing as the folks ahead of us got their com
puters. We couldn't help but crack a smile
every time the announcer said "HES
NUTS!" Eventually the announcer reluc
tantly gave up after admitting, "Oh man, I
just love saying this guy's e-mail name."
A friend of mine was also on the waitlist
until they called out his username,
"SPAMSPAM." It just so happened that he
was wearing a purple shirt with the word
"SPAM" in bright bold yellow across his
chest. You had to be there — all of Meyer
erupted with laughter
The moral ol the story is thai user names
really do go a long way. We should all be
thankful that we have a choice and are not
reduced to x3S47s49@generic.edu. It would
be foolish to waste the opportunity to have
a cool e-mail name. I remember hearing of
a student who was spankme@leland. Imag
ine how hard it must have been for him to
interview for jobs! So next year at MuFu-
UnSun, please remind your ex-pro fro of
this.
Usernames, part II: Keeping all this in
mind. I still had trouble picking a username
for my new "Hotmail" account. Why?
Because even the most obscure usernames
are already taken ... so eventually 1 just
typed in random letters and lo and behold
I'm now qqyypp@hotmail.com. What a

country!
"The Session": This is when you dive
into your e-mail with a purpose, a list and a
walkman. You plow through those mes
sages one by one until your walkman bat
teries die, which often happens just after
you finish e-mailing your roommate and
before you get to the important messages.
There's just something about walkmen
that is so empowering — like when you bike
to class with one and your life feels like an
MTV video. Or when you're driving home
and a great song comes on the radio so you
drive a few extra blocks, or wait in the
garage till the song's over, or sprint upstairs
to your room and turn on the radio even
though you already have the song on CD.
The right music just makes the right mood.
Unix: Often confused with eunuchs.
Although, believe it or not, the two are
closely related. Unix is the reason why
"emale" is the genderless neutrality
between male and female. In cyberspace we
are freed from the bonds of gender and
reduced to sexless machine-operating
robots. Unless you have one of those little
minicams on top your monitor — which is
probably a sign that you need to get out
more.
