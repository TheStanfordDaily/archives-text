Remember context of
Armenian deportation
()n Apnl 24. 1915 the Ottoman govern
ment ordered the arrest of 235 Armenian
social and political leaders in Istanbul
They were accused of allying with the
Empire's worst World War 1 enemy, Kus
sia. On May 30, the C ouncil of Ministers
ordered that all Armenians in eastern
Anatolia he relocated tc the southern
province of Syria, far from the Russian
border. Following WWI. the Armenian
delegation to the Paris Peace Conference
estimated that between 210,000 and
310.000 Armenians lost their lives during
the depot tation. Ovet the course of the
2<>tli century Armenia has raised this fig
urc to I S to 2 million. ( ensus figures tell
us that 700,000 were deported out of a
total I l >l4 Ottoman Armenian population
of 1,295.000.
Belittling the suffering of the deported

Armenians a great crime. It makes no
sense to hold an entire group responsible
fot the rebellious activities of certain
members. However, we know very little
about what actually happened; the mattei
is not as cleat as America s Armenian
I ,obbv advertises
Furthermore, the Armenian Lobby
rarely discusses the historical context.
Why do their publications not mention
that the Ottoman government was on the
verge of losing a territory the size of the
United States, that it was struggling for
life after 6(H) years of existence, and that
anarchical conditions led to the starvation
and massacre of millions from all
Ottoman racial groups?
Was the relocation order part of a sys
tematic plan to exterminate the Armenian
race'' Government documents inform us
of the massacre of Armenian convoys by
highway robbers and even I urkish troops.
Howevci can we assume that the
Ottoman government ordered such
killings? How does one explain a telegram

sent by the government in 1915 which
pledged to prosecute those who attacked
the Armenian convoys? The picture that
emerges is not one of systematic extermi
nation. hut of a central government on the
verge of collapse, unable to control offi
cers in distant provinces.
Armenian sources frequently cite the
diary of Henry Morgenthau, America's
ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, to
prove the killing machine theory. They
neglect to mention that Morgenthau was
an unashamed bigot who claimed Turks
had "inferior blood." Another source
for supporters of the genocide argument is
the file of Ottoman documents submitted
by Aram Andonian after World War 11. In
this document, Ottomans state their desire
to destroy all Armenians, but these are
forgeries. America's Armenian Lobby has
portrayed European documentation as a
clear-cut matter. While some Europeans
believed the Ottomans were attempting to
destroy the Armenian race, this opinion
was rejected by other officials. The evi

dence is often contradictory.
At the time, the Ottoman Empire was
on the verge of destruction. Fhe Council
of Ministers probably knew that thou
sands of Armenians would die because of
the deportation, and we should be disgust
ed by their decision. But we must place
that decision in its proper historical con
text.
While we must all mourn the senseless
deaths of the Armenians who died during
the deportation, we should also remember
the lurks. Kurds, Greeks, ( opts, l a/,
Ladino Jews and Sabeans who died as
well. It is wrong to blame the undoubted
suffering of the Armenian people on
something more than the same anarchical
conditions which afflicted the Sultan's
other subjects.
In America, the public blindly accepts
whatever it hears about the "Armenian
Genocide" and the evil " Turkish Lobby."
If this Turkish Lobby is so magnificently
powerful, why have almost no Americans
heard about the A/eri Turks' accusations

that Armenians perpetrated genocide
against them? Why does the public ignore
l housands of slaughtered Turks and Kurds
but automatically accept Armenian claims
against them? And why is Russia's sinister
role in the events of 1915 ignored? We
must find objective answers to these ques
tions rather than accepting propaganda
pamphlets.
I urge you all to remember the suffer
ing of 1915 as human suffering rather than
as Armenian or Turkish, Christian or
Muslim. II we don't all do this together,
what will become of humanity?
