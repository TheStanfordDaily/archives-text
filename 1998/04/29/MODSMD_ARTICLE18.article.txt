## Sojourning in the wide post-Stanford world 
### 
Aaron Padilla

FOR ME STANFORD and the
developing world were intertwined
even before my freshmen RAs had
yelled my name and hometown on arrival
day.
Fresh from high school graduation, 1
stood beside a highway in Venezuela,
waiting for a bus heading from the
Caribbean coast to Caracas.
A group of curious and envious kids
circled around me, asking questions and
making me the center of a roadside attrac
tion. Before I could react, one boy
grabbed my cardinal Stanford hat. It had
recently acquired precious value since I'd
decided to spend the next four years on
the Farm.
I started after him. but 1 gave up the
pursuit when I realized he had no inten
tion of giving it back.
Picking up broken shards of glass, he
threatened me and disappeared. My bus
arrived seconds later, squelching any
hopes of retrieval.
On the Venezuela trip, the innocent,
idealistic kid who had never before left the

country finally discovered how most of the
rest of the world lived day to day. Later on
the sojourn I traveled down the Orinoco

River in a dugout canoe.
Sophomore year, when I decided to
major in international relations. I real-

ized the dugout canoe had been a
turning point. Captivated by the

raw edge of the developing

world, I vowed to learn more
and return.
I have, many times since
then. During my Stanford

years 1 embarked to many other corners
of Latin America. And when the time

came to make the pivotal decision

of what to do after Stanford,

1 followed my heart to
the developing world just
like I had done after high
school.

This time I started in Africa.
Imagine my surprise when I

found a cardinal Stanford hat with the
white block "S"on the vending block in
the central market in Kumasi, Ghana. 1

hurried to inspect it. No, it wasn't the same
hat that had been stolen in Venezuela.
This one was fitted; the other was

adj us table.
But when

I tried
i t

on and sensed a near-perfect fit, I knew it
was destined for me. I handed over
enough Ghanaian cedis for the right to
walk off wilh it. proudly.
In Venezuela the hat symbolized
promising expectations for me at Stanford.
Now. several Flicks passes, sweaty-palmed
midterms and a Wacky Walk later. I am at
the dawn of post-Stanford life. I he Ghana
hat takes me hack, representing what I've
gained in those four years.
Right now I'm not exactly on the fast
track expected of Stanford grads. I'm in
the developing world, learning from my
surroundings rather than the lectures of
graduate school or the conference rooms
of corporate America.
In the middle of a seven-month journey
through Africa, India. Nepal, Thailand.
Australia and New Zealand. I'm more
humbled and sanguine than exhilarated by
the raw edge.
Ironically, now that I have a Stanford
diploma tucked in my back pocket, I'm
more guarded about my ability to help
change for the better what I observe. Yet

I'm energized by the tenacity and vibrancy
of the materially impoverished world
around me.
People in tar reaches of the globe rec
ognize Stanford. It is a symbol of educa
tion, unbounded opportunity and ability,
and an elite.
In Venezuela Stanford was still for me
as it is for them — a faraway place yet
unknown. Now it is a symbol for which I
am an ambassador.
Yes. I'll soon be back on a faster, if not
the fast track. Yet while temporarily
derailed, with no pretense of employment
or formal study. I experience the develop
ing world to which I hope to dedicate
myself.
Forlorn in the market, my newly
acquired Stanford hat was worth only
three bucks, and that only to a giddy alum
passing by. Atop my head, its symbolic
value, just like my diploma and all it rep
resents. is priceless.
