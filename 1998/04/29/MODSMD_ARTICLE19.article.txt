Deja vu visited Sunken Diamond last
night as No. 1 Stanford narrowly defeated
Cal Poly-San Louis Obispo 8-7 in a non
conference game reminiscent of last sea

It was the top of the ninth and the Car
dinal (37-8-1) stood one out away from an
8-5 win over the Mustangs (16-37).
Junior closer Tony Cogan paced the
mound and prepared to hurl the final
pitch of the evening with a 1-2 count,

off first.
In a heartbeat, the momentum of the
game changed as Cal Poly's Steve Wood
hammered a two-run homer over the cen

Suddenly, the game seemed like it
might go on a little longer. Simultaneous

one year ago when the Mustangs tied the
game 3-3 in the top of the ninth with
Cogan on the mound.
The Cardinal ultimately secured the
victory in that game off a solo homer by
Jody Gerut in the bottom of the ninth.
Cogan, notorious for his calm under
pressure, however, retired Mustang left
