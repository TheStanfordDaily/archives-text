"I dunno... eight?" Mike suggested, to

that the people I know who use them come

drug culture is alive and well at Stanford,

This marijuana bud weighs an eighth of an ounce. Although alcohol is the most pervasive drug on campus, other drugs
are present in some circles.
with LSD and other psychoactive
drugs he stole while working at the
Menlo Park Veterans Affairs Hospi
tal in 1%1.
What may be most surprising is
that drug use on campus is spread
across several social circles: coopera
tive houses, fraternities and self-op
erated houses alike seem to house
dealers, and drugs are consumed
from Mirrielees to Governor's Cor
ner.
On the other hand, it's no surprise
that many dorms lack substantial
drug use except for alcohol, especial
ly upper- and four-class dorms. How
ever, exposure to marijuana usually
occurs in freshman dorms.
"A few of my kids have been ex
perimenting," said Jason, an RAin
an all-freshman dorm. "But I don't
think it has been out of control. It's
mostly people that didn't smoke mar
ijuana who have become friends with
people who did."

'This year, we haven't had
any case within the judicial
affairs area... in which
some other drug has been
involved or has served as a
contributing factor.'

The graduate population seems to
mirror the undergraduate in its drug
consumption.
"A lot of people on this campus
wouldn't like me saying that among
certain circles, there is pervasive mar

ijuana use," said Catherine, a third
year law student. "There's not a lot of
college-type drugs like mushrooms
although I'm sure they are
around There is cocaine use, but
it's probably limited to about 15 peo
ple out of 500."

'I think the University has a
general idea about drug
use on campus, and I think
they are tolerant of it
because they know where it
is.'

She pointed out that lawyers can
not get some government jobs, sueh
as in the U.S. Attorney's Office, if an
FBI background check discovers past
marijuana use.
George, a second-year student at
the Graduate School of Business,
held the opposite view.
"I've never seen or even heard of
drug use at the GSB," George said.
"On the other hand, I'm married and
live off campus ... but it's nothing
like when I was an undergraduate
here, even in terms of alcohol."
Without a doubt, alcohol is the
most-consumed drug on campus, ac
knowledged Dean of Students Marc
Wais.
"It appears that the drug of choice
tends to be alcohol. This year, we
haven't had any [drug-related] case
within the judicial affairs arena, to my
knowledge, in which some other drug
has been involved or has served as a
contributing factor.
"I'd be naive to suggest that there
is no drug use at Stanford," Wais

added.
The Stanford Police would proba
bly agree with him. Last week they
released their annual crime statistics,
in which they reported 33 arrests for
drug violations in 1997, compared
with 11 drug-related arrests in the
previous year.
However, the Stanford Police at
tributed most of these arrests to peo
ple passing through the area, not
Stanford students. Whether the rise
in arrests indicates an upswing in
drug use remains to be seen. Recent
history has shown that the campus is
no stranger to drug-related incidents.
In 1991, Computer Science Senior
Lecturer Stuart Reges was fired after
he told a student about his use of Ec
stasy in a series of events that gener
ated national media coverage.
In 1989. 21 people were arrested
outside of a Grateful Dead show at
Frost Amphitheater for buying or
selling drugs, mostly psychedelic
mushrooms. That's just in the last
decade — one that waited for the first
generation of children going through
"D.A.R.E." to come of age.
In the past four years, the campus
has maintained a well-oiled method
of drug supply, rather than relying on
the hippies following Dead shows.
Established connections to marijua
na dealers in Humboldt County sup
ply kind bud. which sells for its weight
in gold — $50 to $60 for an eighth of
an ounce — while the same type of
links to San Jose provide schwag for
$15 per eighth.
Maybe it's not surprising that mar
ijuana is as easy to get on campus as
nitrous oxide has always been. The
chemical that turns cream into
whipped cream, nitrous oxide is sold
in supermarkets across the country.
Santa Cruz, just an hour away, is a

national shipping center for mush
rooms, while LSD comes from San
Jose and San Francisco — although
there is a long-standing myth / rumor
that the chemistry labs of Stanford
and UC-Berkeley continue to pro
duce more than half of the LSD in
California. There's also a steady sup
ply of cocaine, speed and Ecstasy
from those two cities.
Only relatively low-profile drugs
like barhituates, heroin and opium
have no regular distribution mecha
nism; the entire Bay Area, Southern
California and even New York sup
ply those drugs.

There is pervasive mari
juana use. There's not a
lot of college-type drugs
like mushrooms, although
I'm sure they're around.'

Not that the school hasn't tried to
keep drugs off campus. In 1990, po
lice raided the Alpha Delta house
(now the Enchanted Broccoli Forest)
after an anonymous tip. They came
up empty-handed amid reports that
someone in the University adminis
tration, possibly in the Office of Res
idential Education, had tipped off
residents.
The idea that the University
would — and continues to — protect
itself from a national drug-related
scandal is no surprise to Patrick.
"I think the University has a gen
eral idea about drug use on campus,
and I think they are tolerant of it be
cause they know where it is," he said.
"They allow it to survive because it's
easier than having it in the papers."
