## Folkl to join in 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
The WNBA's marketing slogan
for this coming season has been
"Join in!"
Lately, some of women's basket
hall's biggest names have been tak
ing that slogan to heart.
Yesterday, the league made a
monumental statement by signing
Cardinal forward Kristin Folkl. Old
Dominion point guard Ticha
Penicheiro and Connecticut for
ward Nvkesha Sales to player con
tracts. Folkl's signing comes two
weeks after the league had signed
Stanford's Vanessa Nygaard and six
others.
The two-sport star joins Nygaard
and Olympia Scott as Stanford's
WNBA signees.
"I spent a lot of time speaking to
each league, the coaches and the
players," Folkl said. "After the dust
settled, I felt the WNBA was the
best league for me."
Folkl. who tore her anterior cru
ciate ligament (ACL) March 10 and
had surgery to repair it three weeks
later, will sit out today's WNBA
draft and the 1998 season. She will
likely be assigned to one of the
league's expansion teams (Min
nesota or Orlando) in the fall and
play for them in 1999.
Folkl. as well as the WNBA, is

excited and relieved to have made a
decision concerning her basketball
playing future, even if it is tem
porarily on hold.
"We have absolutely no doubt
that [Folkl] is going to excel at the
pro level." said WNBA president
Val Ackerman. "She will be a big
part of our future."
This past season, Folkl led the
Stanford volleyball team to its third
national title in four years before
helping the Cardinal basketball
squad to a 19-1 regular-season fin
ish. She averaged 18.9 points and 8.2
rebounds per contest, tops among
her Cardinal teammates. She was
an All-Pacific 10 Conference selec
tion as well as a member of the
Kodak Ail-American basketball
team.
For her 54-game basketball ca
reer. Folkl averaged 13.2 points and
seven rebounds per contest. Among
her many remarkable perfor
mances include the 8-for-8 shooting
night in last season's national semi
final loss to Old Dominion, her 20
points and 15 rebounds in a key con
ference win at UCLA last January
and the 36 points poured in on
Washington in February.
The WNBA, which has signed
44 college seniors since the colle
giate basketball season ended last
month, will begin its second season
June 11.
