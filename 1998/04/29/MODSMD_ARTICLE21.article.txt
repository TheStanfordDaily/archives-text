# Drafts discussed
## Marv Albert contacts Rob 
### 
It's that time of year again folks
— amateurs become professionals,
shoe companies vie for endorsers
and innocent youths learn that
money talks. Its draft time.
Robin: Draft, did somebody say
draft? I love draft beer.
Va: Not that kind of draft, you lush.
Robin: Well, what are we talking
about then? Do you mean drafts
like the things my CIV section
leader always wanted me to write?
Va: Robin, you're making us all just
a little bit dumber. Stop talking.
Robin:

Va: That's more like it. What I'm
talking about is professional sports
drafts.
Robin: Do I get to talk now?
Va: Think before you speak.
Koliin: Did you by ;iny chance
choose this topic because the
WNB A draft is today?
Va: It's pretty nerve-racking not to
know where you're going to be next

year.
Robin: Oooh, you're right. It must
be really stressful wondering who's
going to pay you your next million.
Va: Shut up. It must be even more
stressful to be an unemployed
sportswriter with no direction.
Robin: You better not be talking
about me. A little-known fact is that
I've just been made eligible for the
NSA (National Sportswriter's As
sociation) draft. My agent tells me
I'm going to go somewhere between
the second and third round. I'm
crossing my fingers for a Sports Il
lustrated spot.

Va: I know you want to be like me.
but this is ridiculous. There's no
such thing as the NSA. You didn't
take Psychology 85: Fabrication and
Lies. Wait, neither did I.
Kohin: Oh yeah, how's this for
proof? I have a letter right here
from Marv Albert telling me what a


Vanessa
Nygaard
Robin
Davidson
great future I have and inviting me
out for a bite to eat.
Va: That is so weak. Your skills have
faded.
Kohin: Well, let's get back to our
topic. I know all this pent up hostili
ty is because you're nervous about
today's draft. Don't be; other Stan
ford players have done really well in
the professional drafts this year.
Va: Yeah, five football players get
ting drafted is pretty impressive.

must be a testament to our strength
and conditioning program.
Kohin: Are you going to watch the
WNBA draft?
Ya: Sadly no. 1 have a conflict with
my quilting class. It's log cabin day
and 1 can't miss that.
Kohin: It's probably a good idea
that you're not watching. I had a
friend who watched the entire NFL
draft, and when they picked Hask
ins she flipped out. I think it was a
seizure of joy or something.
Ya: You don't include me as one of
your friends, do you?
Kohin: You should take what you

can get. You never know when
you'll need a shoulder to cry on. hut
back to the draft. II you could play
anywhere, where would you play?
Va: Well. Robin, did you ever see
that "Gilligan's Island" episode
where somehow mysteriously the
Harlem Globetrotters ended up on
the island and they built a court in
the middle of the jungle. That's my
dream, but 1 have heard that Skip
per can be a jerk of a coach
you've seen him hit Gilligan with
that hat.
Kohin: I don't think the WNBA has
a team on "Gilligan's Island." but

"The Castaways" is kind of catchy.
Rut seriously, where would you re
ally want to play?
Ya: I'd be happy to play anywhere; 1
just wish they had a team in San
Diego so 1 could live at home with
my Mommy.
Kohin: Well.. .that's all for today.
Va. I'd just like to wish you good
luck in the draft. But if everything
falls through, just remember, we'll
always have our column!

Captain Va sends a shorn out to her
main dogs: Y-vonne, Pliat-stini, Dra
and the Hig Red Dawg.
