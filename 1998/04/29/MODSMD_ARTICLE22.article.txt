So. you thought top-notch athletes at Stanford
only play varsity sports?
Stanford's badminton team coasted to its sec
ond consecutive national title, taking both the team
title and every individual event in the tournament,
which was held at the University of Maryland, CAl
lege Park.
'it felt great. We were really excited." said ju
nior co-captain Deborah Anna Re/nek. "It would
be wrong to say one [championship] is sweeter than
the other, but it was great to know that we could do
it again."
The championship competition included 15
schools from all over the nation. Stanford finished
first with 34 points, while its closest competitor,
Penn State, finished with 14.
The most hyped matchup of the tournament pit
ted Cardinal sophomore co-captain Chris Hales
against Roland Simon of Towson University.
Simon, a member of the Dutch junior national
team, was touted as a legitimate challenger to
Hales' title run. Those claims proved to be un
founded as 1 lales dominated Simon, winning easi

ly, 15-1.15-2.
Hales then joined freshman Mike Pfyl to win the
men's doubles.
And as if that wasn't enough. Hales made it a
complete sweep by winning the mixed doubles with
senior Lily Chen, 15-5,15-5.

â–  Saturday: Stanford 34 (first place). Penn State 14
(second place).

Not to be outdone by Hales, Chen also won the
women's singles title, beating Vida Tsang of Penn
State 15-0.15-1.
"I went out there with a game plan to defeat my
opponent." Chen said. "I was very focused, and I
don't think 1 gave her much of an opportunity to
play her game against me. I was trying to attack her
weaknesses."
Chen gave an encore performance after her
thrashing of Tsang, teaming up with Re/nek to cap
ture the women's doubles title, 15-3,15-3.
Reznek, Hales, senior Jerry Wong and Chen
have all participated at the U.S. junior national
level. Chen has played on the junior national team

since 1987 and competed at the Olympic Festival in
1994 and 1995.
Pfyl's strong performance over the weekend in
cluded a third-place finish in the men's singles,
while the Card showed its depth as seniors Jack Lo
and Wong earned third place in the men's doubles
competition. Lo also combined with junior C iloria
Lee to take fourth place in the mixed doubles
event.
Not surprisingly, Stanford also dominated on
the All-American team, as five of the 11 All-Amer
icans represented the Farm. C hen. Reznek, Hales,
Pfyl and Wong earned All-America honors.
Like most club sports teams, the Stanford ath
letes had to contribute their own funds to make
the trip out to Maryland possible. Although the
badminton team does not receive nearly the same
level of financial support that most varsity sports
enjoy, being the national badminton champions
does have its perks. The team is sponsored in part
by Nike, and the trip was subsidized by Stanford's
Club Sports program. The players also got to
share in something few varsity athletes have ex
perenced.
"We all stayed in one room," Reznek said. "It
was a great bonding experience."
