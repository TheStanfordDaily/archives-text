# Cyclists balance medicine and sport

A blur of red can he seen on the
side of the road by Stanford's
Medical Center. It's eerily quiet as
the sound of gushing wind re
places the usual drone of sirens
present at the emergency en
trance to the hospital.
Four medical students are rac
ing each other in the only free
time they receive in their hectic
daily schedules — and they are en
joying every minute of it. Their
peculiarly shaped red helmets and
matching gear indicate that these
four students are not the typical
Stanford bikers who are notorious
for crashing into random foun
tains on campus.
Should an injury occur at this
point in the Stanford cycling

team's season, nobody would
even bother to ask if there's a doc
tor in the house. It's not that the
six women on the team do not care
for each othe. It's certainly not
that the sport is a pain and injury
free activity. Rather, the four
medical students on the team
seem to be well on their way to be
coming successful doctors them
selves.
"It's actually really strange that
out of everybody on campus, four
out of the six women on the team
are from the med school," said
Megan Troxell, one of the four
graduate students. "Sometimes
you have to get up really early to
ride and sometimes you have to
ride in the dark ... (but) I think I
would go insane if I didn't go on
my bike rides."
Troxell, as well as Cindy Fergu

son, Cathy Norbutas and Chris
tine Thorburn, all lead incredibly
busy lives yet somehow come to
gether to practice and compete as
a team. Thoughts of medical
school, however, are not far off.
"If I wasn't riding, I suppose I'd
be sleeping in those off hours,"
said Thorburn, who feels a special
closeness with the other three.
"We definitely bond over similar
experiences in medical school. We
talk a lot when we bike."
With Thorburn and Norbutas
in clinics, rotating from different
departments and hospitals as well
as being on call, weekend races
sometimes take up all the free
time they have.
"One of the great aspects of
Stanford Medical School is the
flexibility and support that the ad
ministration gives students to pur

sue other interests besides medi
cine," Ferguson said. "This does
not mean that it is not a challenge
to fit in racing and school.
"The one big time-consuming
aspect of cycling is the racing on
the weekend. This is usually the
time to get caught up .. . but for
me it was racing time. 1 would try
to study between races and at
night in the motel, but it was diffi
cult with four riders in one small
Motel 6 room."
Norbutas can certainly relate,
seeing as it's been a busy year for
her as well. With less time for
competing and unpredictable
hours at the Medical Center,
weekend races have been
crammed in between shifts at the
hospital and days on call.
"One of the hardest things is
not being able to schedule," she
said. "It's hard to plan ahead. You
can't predict the day."
This season, Norbutas had dif
ficulty finding time to get to Reno
for a race. She raced to Nevada
the day after spending a sleepless
night on call at the hospital to join
her teammates in a small hotel
room — with only a few hours to
sleep before her race.
"That was my one day off," she
said. "I spent it driving to Reno,
racing and driving back."
Preparing for yet another road
trip, this time the conference
championship to be held this
weekend in San Diego, the Cardi
nal team seems as close-knit as
ever.
On a warm Tuesday afternoon,
Thorburn greeted her teammates
before a ride, by exclaiming, "I de
livered my first baby last night!"
Congratulations and cheers all
around acknowledge her latest ac
complishment.
"I love being a part of this
team," Norbutas said. "It helps
me get through the day. That's
why I am hanging with it.

Cindy Ferguson, Cathy Norbutas and Christine Thorburn and Megan Troxeli spend much of their
"free" time between medical school classes and hospital rotations with Stanford's cycling team.
