## Universities constructing faster, more functional Internet 
### Akash Garg Contributing writer 
The Internet has rapidly become the preferred method of communication for mil
lions of people worldwide. As its popularity has grown, so too has congestion. In
response, several universities including Stanford have jointly launched an initiative to
build a high-speed Internet II designed specifically for academic purposes.
The consortium envisions applications ranging from guest lectures transmitted
nationwide via the World Wide Web to shared "virtual" environments for research
projects.
The Internet II will take advantage of a new high-speed telecommunications back
bone connecting over 1()() universities and companies around the country.
This faster backbone will enable development of richer and more functional appli
cations that will enhance educational and research opportunities. Currently, the
Internet is capable of transmitting 1(X) million bits per second. The Internet II hopes
to transmit at a rate of 2.4 billion bits per second by the year 2(XX).
Because the bandwidth of the Internet 11 will surpass the present bandwidth of the
Internet, existing applications will run faster. More importantly, the extra bandwidth
will allow development of applications that integrate currently impossible tasks such
as full-motion video and interactivity.
" The Internet II is going to offer a different quality of service — speed isn't the
only need," said Raman Khanna, director of Stanford's Distributed Computing and
Communications Systems.
Stanford will connect to the Internet II via Calren II (California Research and Edu
cation Network), which consists of two high-speed rings in Northern and Southern
California. Stanford and UC-Berkeley are working together on the development of
the northern ring while USC and Caltech are collaborating on the southern ring.
According to Khanna, Calren II should be operational by June.
The Internet II will not replace the current Internet — rather, members of the
Internet II community will communicate with each other using the high-speed con
nection while still using the Internet for standard communication purposes. To con
nect to the Internet 11. the consortium partners have developed a piece of hardware
called a gigaPop, which stands for gigabit per second point of presence. As more
gigaPops are installed, the Internet ll's reach will continue to expand.
Many universities and companies have already developed powerful Internet II
applications. Ohio State University has developed a shared virtual environment
application. It allows people in different locations around the country to share and
access each other's work. For example, multiple doctors scattered across the nation
would be able to simultaneously examine a patient, thus foregoing the need for cost
ly referrals and travel.
The Internet II will offer real-time video streaming — an application next to
impossible to do on the Internet now. A practical application for this has already been
developed at Georgetown University — the Internet II makes it possible to deliver
full-motion sign language video with synchronized audio, text and graphics via the
Web.
The real-time video has also made it possible for researchers at North Carolina
State University to develop a live Web lecture system, including advanced two-way
communication systems that allow students from all over the country to interact with
the lecturer.
NASA and the University of Missouri-Columbia have developed a Distributed
Image Spread Sheet (DISS) application that combines a traditional spreadsheet with
image processing and visualization technology. With this application, viewing, under
standing and manipulating terabytes of information becomes intuitive and simple.
DISS will take advantage of Internet IPs higher speed and allow NASA to collect and
analyze information from remote sensing locations virtually instantaneously.
