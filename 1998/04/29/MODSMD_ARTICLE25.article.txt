Dear Health Forum,
eWhat exactly is a pacemak
er and what does it do?

Dear Reader,
A A pacemaker is an elec
tronic device that helps the
heart beat properly.
After v a heart attack, trauma or
disease, the heart may begin to beat
in an irregular fashion.
Usually this develops when dam
age to the cardiac tissue causes an
irregular conductance of the electri
cal impulses that make the heart beat
and guide its rhythm.
To assist a damaged or trauma
tized heart, a thoracic surgeon may
suggest using a pacemaker to aid in
regulating the patient's cardiac
rhythms and electrical impulses.
With a pacemaker installed, the
patient's heart can assume a normal
sinus rhythm and function properly.

Dear Health Forum,
eHow exactly does a
paramedic "jumpstart" some
one's heart with that two-han
dled zapping device?

Dear Reader.
A When a person is in a state
of cardiac arrest (heart has
stopped) or when the heart
rhythm exhibits strange beat
ing patterns, a paramedic may use an
electrical device called a defibrillator to
deliver an electric shock to the heart.
When the heart has suffered from a
trauma, the regular electrical impulses
controlling the heartbeat are sometimes
skewed into disarray.
When this happens, the heart beats
irregularly and goes into a state of fib
rillation. In these cases, the shock
delivered by the defribrilator momen
tarily "resets" the scattered electrical
impulses which are causing the heart to
act irregularly. When these currents
have been reset by the defibrillator, the
heart again begins to beat properly.
