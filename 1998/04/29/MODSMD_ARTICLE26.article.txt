# SLAC explores physics frontiers

### Ian Mitchell 
Did you know that the world's largest gun is pointed at the heart
of campus and lies just three miles away in the hills?
But don't worry - - although bullets have been rushing down its
two mile barrel for over 30 years, we have never had anything to
complain about. The bullets that the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) uses are electrons and their antimatter twins,
positrons. These bullets might he traveling extremely close to the
speed o light, but even in a catastrophic failure, they would not
penetrate the 25 feet of packed earth under which the beam line
was built.
The only danger SLAC poses to Stanford is in increasing our
reputation lor cutting-edge research. Early research there has
already led to a long list of awards, including three Nobel Prizes.
A new facility now under construction will ensure the accelerator
at least another decade of pioneering work in particle physics.
Construction for SLAC began in 1%2. and since 1966 the cen
terpiece linear accelerator, or linac. has been shooting electrons
down a copper pipe 2 miles long and 4 inches in diameter. The
facility, which is operated by Stanford for the Department of
Energy, lies in the foothills off Sand Hill Road. The beam passes
under Interstate 280.
The long shed visible from the freeway is the klystron gallery,
which contains the klystron power tubes that pump microwaves
into the beam line 25 feet below. These klystrons are larger
cousins to those that provide power to microwave ovens. Unlike
ovens, in which the microwaves are used to jiggle water molecules
to heat food, the microwaves from SLAC's giant klystrons are

used to accelerate the electrons
and positrons in the beam.
And those electrons are
really moving. When first com
pleted. SL.AC was capable of
achieving 20 GeV (giga elec
tron volts), and has since
increased to 50 GeV — equiv
alent to dropping the electrons
between two plates that have a
50 billion volt difference in
potential.
Only one collider on earth
can beat SLAC's maximum
power in electron-positron col
lisions — the Large Electron-
Positron (LEP) ring at C'ERN
on the border between France
and Switzerland. That ring,
some 27 kilometers in circum-

ference. collides beams at 90
CieV. Other famous colliders, such the le\atron at Fermilab.
the new Large I ladron ('ollider (LUC) at CERN and the now can
celed Superconducting Supercollider (SSC) in Lexas are designed
to collide protons and antiprotons. Although these latter acceler
ators can reach higher energies than SI AC and LEP, the electron
positron colliders allow study of distinct areas of particle physics.
I Ik linear accelerator has remained the central device at
SL.AC. but over the \ears a large \ariet\ of experimental facilities
have been built at its terminal end. Before packets of elec
trons from the linac were simply shot into stationary targets at the
end of the beam line. 1 he beam could be steered into one of three
end stations
One ol the early experiments performed at Hid Station A
showed th.it nucleons (protons and neutrons) were composed of still
smallei particles, now called quarks. During some collisions between
electrons and nucleons. the electrons were scattered backwards at
angles too large to be accounted for b\ large. homogeneously com
posed nucleons. The test was conceptual!) similar to the experiment
used by Rutherford to prove that atoms contained a small, dense
nucleus. For this work three phvsicists. including Richard Taylor of
SL.AC. shared the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics I he behavior of
quarks is still being studied today at End Station A.
In 1472 the Stanford Positron Electron Asymmetric Ring
(SPEAR) was completed at the terminal end of the linac. Relative
ly low energy (4 GeV) electrons and positrons from the linac were
circulated in this NO-mcter ring in opposite directions, colliding
inside a special detector.
Although the circulating packets each contained millions of par
ticles. the chances of even a single collision on any particular pass
was relatively low I he number ol collisions was increased by recir
culating the packets thousands of times. Furthermore, the counter
rotating beams gave the collision twice the effective energy of either
beam alone, much as head-on automobile collisions are more dam

aging than collisions with stationary objects.
In W74. an experiment at SPEAR discovered a new particle
named Psi. made up of an entirely new quark-antiquark pair. This
fourth quark, named Charm, provided evidence that the quark
model of matter was valid. Burton Richter of SLAC shared the
W76 Nobel Prize for this discovery.
However, that SPEAR experiment was not done yielding
results. Careful examination of the results yielded evidence of a
third cousin to the electron (the second is the muon). For the dis
covery of the tau. Martin Perl of SEAC shared the 1995 Nobel
Prize.
With the success of SPEAR, a larger ring capable of 30 GeV col
lision energy called the Positron Electron Project (PEP) was com
pleted in 1980. At these higher energies, bending the speeding par
ticles becomes more difficult — the PEP ring is 800 meters in diam
eter. PEP measured the lifetimes of certain elementary particles
and tested the theory, called Quantum Chromodynamics. that
describes how the nuclear strong force binds quarks together.
PEP used electrons and positrons accelerated to only 15 CieV.
less than a third of the maximum energy of the linac. Unfortu
nately. a ring large enough for beams at 50 CieV would be over 5
miles in diameter. I 'sage of such high energies in a compact space
required a new concept in collider design.
The Stanford Linear Collider (SLC). completed in 1989. was
SLACs solution. SLC steers full energy packets of electrons and
positrons from the end of the linac into the two sides of a flattened
teardrop; at the base of the teardrop they are traveling in opposite
directions and collide inside the SLC Large Detector (SLD).
However, SLC does not recirculate packets. Instead particles that
J _ _ .a it: J : * J j • *_

do not collide are just dumped into
lead blocks. Because the beams
only interact once, increasing the
collision rate to reasonable levels
required advanced techniques for
focusing the beam down from its
standard millimeter cross-section
to a size less than the width of a
human hair. Still in operation. SLC
studies the ZO particle, which
transmits the weak nuclear force.
Although the SLC experiment is
gradually winding down. SLAC is
already constructing a new facility
in the old PEP ring.
PEP 11. also called the Asym
metric B Factory, is targeted for
completion by early WW. In PEP
11. low energy, very intense beams
will be used to produce large

numbers of bottom quarks. One of
the first research projects will use the bottoms to study a phe
nomenon called CP violation, which is believed to be the reason why
the visible universe is made of matter rather than antimatter It is
expected that PEP 11. like its predecessors, will operate for about a
decade.
Beyond PEP 11. scientists and engineers at SLAC are already
working on the next generation electron-positron collider. SLAC
may be the only linac in the world today, but it represents the
future of such colliders.
The synchrotron radiation emitted when the beam is bent
reduces the energy of the traveling particles, a phenomenon that
worsens as particle energy increases. Therefore, reaching energies
beyond what LLP is currently capable of producing will require a
straight accelerator like Sl.AC's linac. In collaboration with high
energy physics labs in other counties, SLAC is writing a conceptu
al design report that examines the technical viability of a S(H) -
IIXH) GeV accelerator.
Although the project is still in its very early stages, potential ele
ments are already being tested at SLAC. For example, because the
next linac will be a single pass collider like SLC. the probability of
particle collision must be raised by extremely precise focusing of the
beams. The Final Focus Test Beam (FFFB) sits next to End Station
A at the end of the linac. and uses high precision magnets and beam
monitors to try and focus the incoming beams to a tenth of the
already tiny size they occupy at the SLC collision point.
SLAC's scientists and engineers have made enormous contribu
tions to our understanding of the physical universe. Its proximity to
campus represents a chance for students to visit a site important
both for its historic discoveries and for its leading research in many
areas of hard science.
SLAC holds regular public tours (reservations are required: call
and a Marguerite shuttle leaves the oval for SL AC every
half hour during the day.

Did you know that the world's largest gun is pointed at the heart
of campus and lies just three miles away in the hills?
But don't worry - - although bullets have been rushing down its
two mile barrel for over 30 years, we have never had anything to
complain about. The bullets that the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) uses are electrons and their antimatter twins,
positrons. These bullets might he traveling extremely close to the
speed o light, but even in a catastrophic failure, they would not
penetrate the 25 feet of packed earth under which the beam line
was built.
The only danger SLAC poses to Stanford is in increasing our
reputation lor cutting-edge research. Early research there has
already led to a long list of awards, including three Nobel Prizes.
A new facility now under construction will ensure the accelerator
at least another decade of pioneering work in particle physics.
Construction for SLAC began in 1%2. and since 1966 the cen
terpiece linear accelerator, or linac. has been shooting electrons
down a copper pipe 2 miles long and 4 inches in diameter. The
facility, which is operated by Stanford for the Department of
Energy, lies in the foothills off Sand Hill Road. The beam passes
under Interstate 280.
The long shed visible from the freeway is the klystron gallery,
which contains the klystron power tubes that pump microwaves
into the beam line 25 feet below. These klystrons are larger
cousins to those that provide power to microwave ovens. Unlike
ovens, in which the microwaves are used to jiggle water molecules
to heat food, the microwaves from SLAC's giant klystrons are

used to accelerate the electrons
and positrons in the beam.
And those electrons are
really moving. When first com
pleted. SL.AC was capable of
achieving 20 GeV (giga elec
tron volts), and has since
increased to 50 GeV — equiv
alent to dropping the electrons
between two plates that have a
50 billion volt difference in
potential.
Only one collider on earth
can beat SLAC's maximum
power in electron-positron col
lisions — the Large Electron-
Positron (LEP) ring at C'ERN
on the border between France
and Switzerland. That ring,
some 27 kilometers in circum-

ference. collides beams at 90
CieV. Other famous colliders, such the le\atron at Fermilab.
the new Large I ladron ('ollider (LUC) at CERN and the now can
celed Superconducting Supercollider (SSC) in Lexas are designed
to collide protons and antiprotons. Although these latter acceler
ators can reach higher energies than SI AC and LEP, the electron
positron colliders allow study of distinct areas of particle physics.
I Ik linear accelerator has remained the central device at
SL.AC. but over the \ears a large \ariet\ of experimental facilities
have been built at its terminal end. Before packets of elec
trons from the linac were simply shot into stationary targets at the
end of the beam line. 1 he beam could be steered into one of three
end stations
One ol the early experiments performed at Hid Station A
showed th.it nucleons (protons and neutrons) were composed of still
smallei particles, now called quarks. During some collisions between
electrons and nucleons. the electrons were scattered backwards at
angles too large to be accounted for b\ large. homogeneously com
posed nucleons. The test was conceptual!) similar to the experiment
used by Rutherford to prove that atoms contained a small, dense
nucleus. For this work three phvsicists. including Richard Taylor of
SL.AC. shared the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics I he behavior of
quarks is still being studied today at End Station A.
In 1472 the Stanford Positron Electron Asymmetric Ring
(SPEAR) was completed at the terminal end of the linac. Relative
ly low energy (4 GeV) electrons and positrons from the linac were
circulated in this NO-mcter ring in opposite directions, colliding
inside a special detector.
Although the circulating packets each contained millions of par
ticles. the chances of even a single collision on any particular pass
was relatively low I he number ol collisions was increased by recir
culating the packets thousands of times. Furthermore, the counter
rotating beams gave the collision twice the effective energy of either
beam alone, much as head-on automobile collisions are more dam

aging than collisions with stationary objects.
In W74. an experiment at SPEAR discovered a new particle
named Psi. made up of an entirely new quark-antiquark pair. This
fourth quark, named Charm, provided evidence that the quark
model of matter was valid. Burton Richter of SLAC shared the
W76 Nobel Prize for this discovery.
However, that SPEAR experiment was not done yielding
results. Careful examination of the results yielded evidence of a
third cousin to the electron (the second is the muon). For the dis
covery of the tau. Martin Perl of SEAC shared the 1995 Nobel
Prize.
With the success of SPEAR, a larger ring capable of 30 GeV col
lision energy called the Positron Electron Project (PEP) was com
pleted in 1980. At these higher energies, bending the speeding par
ticles becomes more difficult — the PEP ring is 800 meters in diam
eter. PEP measured the lifetimes of certain elementary particles
and tested the theory, called Quantum Chromodynamics. that
describes how the nuclear strong force binds quarks together.
PEP used electrons and positrons accelerated to only 15 CieV.
less than a third of the maximum energy of the linac. Unfortu
nately. a ring large enough for beams at 50 CieV would be over 5
miles in diameter. I 'sage of such high energies in a compact space
required a new concept in collider design.
The Stanford Linear Collider (SLC). completed in 1989. was
SLACs solution. SLC steers full energy packets of electrons and
positrons from the end of the linac into the two sides of a flattened
teardrop; at the base of the teardrop they are traveling in opposite
directions and collide inside the SLC Large Detector (SLD).
However, SLC does not recirculate packets. Instead particles that
J _ _ .a it: J : * J j • *_

do not collide are just dumped into
lead blocks. Because the beams
only interact once, increasing the
collision rate to reasonable levels
required advanced techniques for
focusing the beam down from its
standard millimeter cross-section
to a size less than the width of a
human hair. Still in operation. SLC
studies the ZO particle, which
transmits the weak nuclear force.
Although the SLC experiment is
gradually winding down. SLAC is
