Gordon Gecko's mantra that
"greed is good" is not just a philos
ophy of the 1 L >S()s.
A new club, the Stanford ()hjec
tivist Club, has formed to discuss
objectivist philosophy, one concept
dI which can be characterized as
"selfishness is good."
I lie club held its first meeting
Monday night.
Two Stanford students, fresh
man Rick Gerkin and sophomore
Mark Goldcnson. started the club
lo debate and discuss objectivist
ideas.
"During fall quarter. I decided I
wanted to start an objectivist club
or discussion group at Stanford. I
called a representative at the Ayn
Rand Institute to see what infor
mation or resources he might have
to offer." Gerkin said. "It turned
out that [Goldenson] had talked to
him just days before about the
same thing."
Novelist and philosopher Ayn
Rand founded objectivism as "the
concept of man as a heroic being,
with his own happiness as the
moral purpose of his life, with pro

ductive achievement as his noblest
activity and reason as his only ab
solute."
l he goal of the club is to discuss
objectivist ideas and provide an
open forum for philosophical dis
cussion.
"Our purpose is not conversion
but discussion." Gerkin said. The
club originally planned to hold the
first meeting during winter quarter,
but several delays postponed the
process.
(ioldenson hopes to use the club
as a tool to find an accurate model
of the world.
"Everyone needs a philosophy,
an integrated view of existence," he
said.
"Most everyone just slops one
together from authority, slogans
and random bits of experience,
Goldenson said.
"There's shockingly low filter
ing of our beliefs. Our club is like a
filter, where all the random stuff
we've unconsciously swallowed is
discarded, and all the truths we've
known since kindergarten are
kept.
"11 we honestly think Objec
tivism is the philosophy that cor
rectlv models the world and brings

man the greatest opportunity of
happiness, then we'll probably be
come crazed activitists," Golden
son said.
"It may take 50 years to under
stand. but we'll be extremely satis
fied 70-year-olds," he said.
The meeting was in the form of a
video debate on whether selfish
ness was a moral offense or a moral
ideal.
A dozen people stayed to take
part in the discussion after the
video, which lasted more than two
hours.
At the height of the meeting,
there were about 30 people, Gerkin
said.
"I thought it was a very produc
tive debate. I enjoyed the fact that
both objectivists and non-objec
tivists were there, and we weren't
lighting toward promoting objec
tivism," said sophomore Mark
Johnson.
"A personal life philosophy and
discussion of objectivism was the
focus," Johnson said.
Johnson said the discussion be
came more serious as the group got
smaller.
Freshman Derrick long said,
"In the beginning (of the debate).

there were different definitions of
selfishness, preventing a cohesive
debate. It turned into a socioeco
nomic debate later on."
"1 wouldn't really consider join
ing the club because 1 can't see how
you can have a club on objec
tivism," he said.
The club is planning a trip to San
Francisco next week to see Acadc
mv Award-nominated "Avn Rand:
A Sense of Life," a documentary of
her life.
The club's long-range plans in
clude campus debates among phi
losophy. psychology, sociology and
economics professors — from
Stanford and elsewhere — to talk
about the influence and credibility
of objectivist ideas in their respec
tive fields.
The club also hopes to bring in
speakers from the Ayn Rand Insti
tute and Institute for Objectivist
Studies.
The next meeting, which will be
in two weeks, will either be a de
bate between authorities in objec
tivism and antithetical philosophy
or one between the Stanford Ob
jectivist Club and another Stanford
club, such as the Stanford Social
ists. Gerkin said.
