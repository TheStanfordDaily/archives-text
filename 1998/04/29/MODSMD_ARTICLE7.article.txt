## Brewing beer in the backyard 
### Jennifer Saba Contributing writer 
Nick Peters decided to take the
role of brew master seriously.
After graduating from Stanford
in IW4, Peters went to UC- Davis to
learn how to brew a better beer.
"I did a 10-week intensive
course," Peters explained. The pro
gram, which is independent from the
school, also requires students to take
an apprenticeship. Peters chose the
Pacific Bar and Grill in San Rafael.
"The wonderful part is that the
science is basic and easy to grasp and
really never changes," said Peters,
who has a background in chemical
engineering and a bachelor's degree
in economics.
The Dana Point native explained
that "beer is basically liquid bread."
There are three main ingredients:
malt, hops and yeast. But the key to a
good beer is working with the water
in the area instead of using filters, he
said.
There are also three different var
ieties of beer. Ale is brewed the
fastest, usually within 10 days, and
the yeast sits on the bottom of the
barrel. Lagers are brewed with cold
er temperatures, but the yeast sits on
top. The difference between lagers
and ales is usually one of semantics,
Peters explained. It is difficult for
even brewers to tell the difference.
A stout is an ale with a dark roast
ed malt. The thick brew — practical
ly a meal — is his favorite type.
"I'm a stout head — the closer to
motor oil the happier I am," Peters said.

However, he's not above drinking
a mass-produced beer."I hate to
admit it, but on a hot day there's
nothing like a Bud."
Peters also wanted to dispel the
misconception that only micro brew
ers know how to do it right. Mass
brewers like Budweiser are extreme
ly consistent — a quality not to be
overlooked, he said. But beermaking
does have its setbacks.
"Brewing as a career is 95 percent
glorified pot washing," Peters said.
"You have these giant tanks that
need to be cleaned. That part of the
job has never appealed to me."
Even though Peters is part owner
of Speakeasy, a micro brewery that
sells kegs, he has put the business of
beer on the back burner. He has been
the general manager of the Toyon
Eating Club for the past three years.
"I have a responsibility to see the
eating clubs through," Peters said.
He eventually wants to open a
blues restaurant that, appropriately,
provides its own brew. With his eco
nomics background, his experience
running the eating club and his
tenure at Pacific Bar and Grill, Peters
has the know-how.
But he also realizes that it takes a
lot of work to run a profitable restau
rant — particularly in the Bay Area,
which has more restaurants than any
place in the world, he said.
For now, Peters doesn't even
brew for his own consumption. "It's
funny. Once I learned how to make a
really good beer on a mass scale, it's
easier to go down to the store and
buy Red Hook."
