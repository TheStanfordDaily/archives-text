## 
### Kelly Christeson Contributing writer 
Economic and political domina
tion by Turkey have plagued the peo
ple of (Yprus since 1974. but Cyprus'
problems can be resolved by admit
tance into the European Union, said
Andros Nicolaides. the Cyprus am
bassador to the United States. He
spoke vesterdav in an emotionally

charged discussion.
While on a statewide tour, Nico
laides presented his speech "Will Ac
cession to the European Union Be
the Catalyst for the Solution to the
Cyprus Problem?" to 35 members of
the Stanford community. The discus
sion was put on by the European
Forum at Stanford of the Institute for
International Studies and the Hel
lenic Association for Stanford.

After having flown in from Wash
ington, D.C., only hours before,
Nicolaides expanded on the "Cyprus
problem" and the necessity for
Cyprus' admittance to the European
Union in his 30-minute speech. He
then answered the audience's ques
tions for another hour.
According to Nicolaides, Cyprus'
problem has been its domination by
Turkey since its invasion in 1974.

Since this time, "Turkey [was] always
looking for an excuse to reestablish
[its] presence on Cyprus" by import
ing Turkish refugees and making life
difficult for Cyprus nationals, accord
ing to Nicolaides.
Acceptance into the European
Union is the "window of opportunity
for a solution" that Cyprus has been
searching for to "achieve renuncia
tion of our country." Nicolaides be
lieves.
"In a united Europe. ( vprus could
be united and integrated." Nicolaides
explained, and therefore "allow them
to hurv old suspicions and animosi
ties."
The problem arises because, ac
cording to Nicolaides, "Turkey main
tains that Cyprus should no longer
proceed with accession course." By
affecting political and economic sta
bility in areas of occupation in
Cyprus, Turkey can affect Cyprus'
membership status. Therefore, the
role of the United States in these deal
ings is crucial, Nicolaides stated. The
close relationship the United States
maintains with Turkey allows the na
tion to continue its policy of domina
tion in Cyprus. According to Nico
laides. the I Jnited States, as the "only
superpower with a vested interest."
must impress upon Turkey the need
to change its present attitude.
"It is time for America to tell the
Turks the truth" about the need to
change its policy, Nicolaides said.
The question-and-answer portion
of the presentation showed howemo
tionally charged the Turkey-Cyprus

issue is. Audience members asked
pointed, controversial questions to
the ambassador. The general senti
ment was that despite the intense
emotions involved in the issue, Nico
laides presented the situation fairly.
Nicolaides speech was "very bal
anced, considering the deeply rooted
emotions that exist in that part of the
world," said freshman Mariam Ali.
Curiosity and personal connec
tions brought members of the greater
Stanford community to hear and
question the ambassador.
Ted Laliotis, a former mayor of
1 os Altos, said he came as an "inter
ested (ireek American" who is "po
litically involved."
"Just curiosity" prompted Math
ematics Prof. George Papanicolaou
to attend the talk.
"I relate to my country," said
Turkey native Omer Oralkan, an
electrical engineering graduate stu
dent. "I'm here to learn what they
[the people of Cyprus] think."
Junior Su/anne Abdel-Malak,
president of the I lellenic Association,
was pleased with the presentation
and its timeliness.
"| The | time is right for the Cyprus
accession issue to be brought out."
she said. Although the event is "in the
spotlight" in Europe, the "American
public is not well aware of what is hap
pening."
