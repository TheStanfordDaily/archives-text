The last challenge
of a socially
conscious society?
Depression strikes millions- indiscnmmately. Depression is simply a suppression
of brain activity that makes life unbearable And'even though depression is
readily treatable, only 1 in 5 ever seeks treatment. Why do so many )ust drag
themselves along or eventually seek relief through suicide? First, there's the lack
of awareness of depression- as an illness and as the threat that it is to each and
every one of us. Second, there's the unwarranted negative stigma,attached to it.
You know, the mental' thing. It's ttme to collectively face depression. To know it's
an illness, not a weakness. And it's a L//V T& £ AT E O
challenge that's long overdue. It's _ _ _ . —_
taken too many of us already. (Jr C .5
