6 Tips for Safe and legal Bicycling at Stanford
LIGHT AND BRIGHT
AT NIGHT - RIGHT!
A white headlight visible from 300 feet ahead is the
law — and a good idea. It's the only way other
drivers can see you and avoid you — a front
reflector just doesn't work. Simple headlights cost as
little as 112. For longer night rides, get a headlight that
illuminates the surface ahead.
The law also requires a red rear reflector, but you can
do better. Install a red taillight too — the blinking type
costs as little as $6 and is very visible. For great
visibility from behind, as 9 reflective fabric triangle
makes you or your backpack light up like a neon sign,
never needs batteries, and folds up small when you
don't need it.
These accessories are available
at local bike shops.
