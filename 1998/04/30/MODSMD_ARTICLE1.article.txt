# Fac Sen report describes hiring increases for women, minorities
## Making progress 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
The 1997-98 school year showed
a steady increase in the percentage
of women and minorities among
the faculty, according to a yearly
report on professorial gains and
losses released by the Provost's Of
fice.
The net gains in female and mi
nority professors hired, 14 and 13
people, respectively, are consistent
with rates of gain of the last 10
years.
According to the report, which
will be discussed at today's Faculty
Senate meeting, the percentage of
female faculty, including both
tenured and non-tenured, is now
over 18 percent, and the percent
age of minority faculty is over 14
percent.
In addition, women were also
given tenure at a faster rate than
men. Almost 17 percent of women
faculty on tenure track were given
tenure, as opposed to less than 10
percent of the men.
The School of Humanities and
Sciences, which has been highly
criticized for its lack of female fac
ulty. hired one new female profes
sor during the year. In the same
time period, the school hired eight
new male professors.
The schools of Engineering and
Earth Sciences still lag the farthest
behind, with only 6 and S percent
female faculty, respectively.
The School of Medicine contin

ues to make leaps in the area of hir
ing female faculty, going from 109
female professors to 122 in the last
year. In 19K7, the Medical School
had only 36 female professors. The
Medical School also hired three
new minority faculty members.
The report, released by Provost
Condoleezza Rice, covers the peri
od from Sept. 2, 1996 to Sept. 1,
1997.
Although discussion on this re
port is scheduled for today's senate
meeting, a full discussion of the sta
tus of women faculty is scheduled
for the meeting of May 14.
Also on the agenda for today's
meeting is a report on faculty long
term career planning. The report,
drafted by the Planning and Policy
Board, suggests that the University
needs to become more involved in
guiding tenured professors in their
decisions between research, teach
ing and service.
"Stanford at present does not
provide adequate institutionally
guided and institutionally support
ed career planning after the review
that results in appointment to the
rank of full professor," the report
said.
The board also noted that many
professors at Stanford find it diffi
cult to change the direction of their
study late in their careers.
"A periodic career-planning
mechanism will contribute toward
solutions to these problems," ac
cording to the release.
The report indicates that a sys
tem such as the one it proposes, in
which professors meet with the de

partment chairs or deans every five
years, would also improve the pub
lic perception of the tenure
process.
The report states that the tenure
system, according to popular per
ception, "lacks any assessment or
planning element after promotion

to full professor, is anachronistic
[and] lacks accountability."
In addition to addressing the
problem of perception of tenure,
the planning meetings would also
help professors decide between re
search. teaching and service de
mands and plans for retirement.
