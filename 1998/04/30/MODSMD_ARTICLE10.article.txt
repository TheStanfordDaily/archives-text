### 
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — As somber
church bells rang out, 1 (),(KK) Guatemalans car
rying blood-red carnations of protest bade
farewell yesterday to a Roman Catholic bishop
slain after publishing a report on army abuses.
The death of Bishop Juan Gerardi Coned
era, whose head was bashed in Sunday night
with a concrete block, sparked fears that the
violence of Guatemala's past has not ended.
"He fought for reconciliation, for authentic

peace ... for peace founded in justice and
truth." said Bishop Gerardo Flores of the
northern region of Veracruz, where Gerardi
once ministered to impoverished Indian peas
ants. " That is why they wanted to silence his
voice."
After lying instate for three days in the
Metropolitan Cathedral, the bishop's body w;is
carried through the streets of the capital by
white-robed priests, who bore his casket on

their shoulders. His casket was then placed in
one of the cathedral's crypts.
While a motive for the slaying remained
unclear, many believe that the prelate was
killed to warn others not to delve into pasi
atrocities by the military, whom the report
blamed for nearly HO percent of the 200.000
killings or disappearances during the country's
36-vear civil war.
"This crime is an affront, an attempt at
intimidation against fighters for human rights."
the Myrna Mack Foundation human rights
group proclaimed in a newspaper advertise
ment yesterday.
Many here have drawn parallels between
the killings of Gerardi and Myrna Mack, a
Ciuatemalan anthropologist and human rights
activist who also had conducted extensive inter
views with witnesses to mass killings and other
abuses during the war.
Mack was stabbed to death outside her
Guatemala City office on Sept. 11. 1990.
Although it initially appeared to be a common
crime, a military intelligence agent was later
found guilty of murder.
Others compared the killing to that of San
Salvador Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was
gunned down in 19K0 during F : .l Salvador's civil
war. He. too. spoke out against abuses by his
country's military.
In the late 19705. Gerardi was bishop of
Ouiche province, where most of the 422 mas
sacres were committed during the war.
