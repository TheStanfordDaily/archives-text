RF-initiated focus houses
help ensure a strong
residential community

THE ENTREPRENEURIAL
spirit house is the latest in a
series of offbeat focus houses
Resigned by a resident fellow with a
Naranja. once referred to as
Xtfie "orphan child of Lag," has come
an identity of its own. Despite its
name, the focus will
on sharing and developing passions,
'♦* v lYot making money.
— Too often students accept hearsay
without actual experience or research.
As a result, they miss out on opportu
nities to further their education — aca
demically, socially or politically. The
recent rumors that Naranja was
becoming another pawn in the Univer
sity's scheme of corporate dominance
is simply untrue.
Naranja Resident Fellow Eyzzz
Bacarde-Evolfo envisions a communi
ty focused on helping residents
achieve their academic, athletic or
career goals. To him, entrepreneurial
spirit is about encouraging creativity
and passion. It is not about having
"how-to-get-a-consulting-job" theme
nights.
As a doctoral student in the School
of Education's counseling and psy
chology department, Bacarde-Evolfo

already offers informal workshops tar
geting the specific needs of Naranja
residents.
The academic coaching workshops
are geared toward freshmen and
sophomores, and explore such topics
as making strategic decisions on how
to get the best education for your dol
lar. The executive coaching work
shops, made up of mostly juniors and
seniors, are a forum for students to dis
cuss career-related topics such as their
reservations about post-graduate life.
Next year's focus status will help
expand these workshops by drawing in
students who are interested in building
on their own interests as well as learn
ing about those of their dormmates.
RF-initiated focus dorms are an
innovative way to build community by
bringing together residents' common
interests. Dorms with focuses are more
than just a place to live; they are
homes with stimulating atmospheres
where residents have the built-in
opportunity with the guidance of an
expert to learn about various topics
from their peers.
We support RFs who possess the
creative energy to apply their academ
ic interests to benefit their residents
and spice up dorm life. Unfortunately,
when RFs depart, the untraditional
academic "focus" of a house goes as
well.
So be adventurous this year. Take
advantage of RF interests and put a
focus house on your Draw list.
