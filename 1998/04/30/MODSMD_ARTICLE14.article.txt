The ASSU Task Force on Graduate
Housing is running a survey of graduate stu
dent housing concerns. The survey will help
the task force — a joint effort of the Grad
uate Student Council, the ASSU, the grad
uate resident assistants and other graduate
students who are concerned about graduate
housing — determine an appropriate
response to what many perceive as a hous
ing crisis for graduate students. Simply, the
task force is trying to better understand
what the housing situation is and what grad
students want. The results of the survey will
be shared with Stanford housing adminis
trators and with students. We hope that it
will contribute to better decisions about
housing.
The survey is both for students who live
on campus and students who live off cam
pus. It should take under five minutes, and
v as an incentive, the task force is giving away
$550 in prize money. The survey can be
reached now through May 8 by going to

Affirmative action
leads to self-doubt
I take strong issue with Dean of Admis
sions and Financial Aids Robert Kinnally's
statement that "the message [of Berkeley's
lower acceptance rate among certain
minority groupsj is clear: Don't apply." I
am greatly bothered by the implication that
blacks and Chicano / Latinos need not
apply to top universities simply because of
the color of their skin.
I grew up a knee-jerk liberal on the issue
of affirmative action but voted for Proposi
tion 209 for two reasons — I prefer prefer
ences based on disadvantaged backgrounds
(a criterion Berkeley now uses) to prefer
ences based on skin color. I feel that affir
mative action encourages the belief that
ALL members of the group receiving pref
erences were admitted not because they
deserve to be but because of their skin
color.
When I was admitted to Harvard in
1987, I couldn't help but wonder whether
my admission reflected my achievements or
the fact that my mother was a Harvard
graduate. I was able to apply to other
sch(X)ls, but members of privileged minori
ty groups cannot avoid the self-doubt and
external skepticism that their achievements
are not "deserved." Unfortunate state
ments such as that by Stanford's admissions
director only validate my concerns about

the stigma of affirmative action.

Avoid personal
attacks in the election
The ASSU presidential runoff has got
ten negative recently, with criticism leveled
at frontrunner Matt Spence, both in this
forum and less public ones.
While a candidate's stands on issues and
policies are fair game, personal attacks,
such as those that have recently surfaced,
should be out of bounds in a place such as
Stanford.
Senator Spence has made many sacri
fices and invested a lot of time in improving
the ASSU. The broad experience he has
gained, combined with his willingness to
undertake new initiatives and grapple with
tough issues such as tuition control in a
responsible, constructive manner amply
qualify him. both by experience and by tem
perament. to serve as ASSU president.
If such a record is too difficult to run
against without circulating false rumors and
making personal attacks. I think it is clear
who we should elect as the ASSU's next
leader.

Cost of formal tickets
is reasonable
I have several problems with Ms. Leu's
column in Monday's Daily. First of all. the
basic premise that a $40 ticket is a pro
hibitive cost for the senior formal is absurd.
Almost anyone at Stanford could get a job
hashing or in the library for nearly $8 per
hour. That means just over five hours of
work in order to attend a very special event.
What is so unrealistic about that? Why
do Ms. Leu and "[her] friends" expect
everything to be a handout? Considering all
of the activities with which Stanford stu
dents seem capable of becoming involved,
taking on a part-time job does not seem out
of the question.
Or maybe we should all just hold a
"protest / rally" in White Plaza and wave
signs and chant until the University lets all
students attend the formal for free! But Ms.
Leu, there's no such thing as a free formal.
Someone has to pay. So many activities and
opportunities during the past four years
have been subsidized. Now that you are a
little under a month away from a Stanford
degree that practically guarantees you at
least a decent living, you still cannot come
up with $40?! Please!
I also object to her personal attack on
the efficacy and responsiveness — even the
moral fiber — of the senior class presidents.
They have been consistently hard-working.

organized and open to comments.
Since when are the presidents expected
to "poll students concerns"? It is truly
absurd that their lack of doing so is what
Ms. Leu finds "most distressing." The stu
dents had input when they elected the pres
idents and now the presidents plan our
events for us. It's hard work and a thankless
job. Our presidents are doing wonderfully.
Finally, in keeping with the ridiculous
nature of the entire column, Ms. Leu
devotes an entire paragraph to protesting
that the formal is being held at the Sir Fran
cis Drake hotel, when the formal is not even
at the Sir Francis Drake. It is at the Westin
St. Francis, a very fine establishment that is
completely unaffiliated with the Sir Francis
Drake. Such an egregious error only con
tributes to Ms. Leu's lack of credibility. If
the senior class presidents did not respond
to her whining e-mail, it may just be possi
ble that it was, in fact, "unworthy of a
response."
