## The 						perfect time to effect change 
### 
COLLEGE IS
unquestionably a
time for encoun
tering firsts. It is the first
time free alcohol is avail
able to you on a weekly
basis. It is the first time
you have to do laundry on

your own. Last week's
rally held by the Student Coalition to
Tenure Karen Sawislak was the first time I
attended a demonstration. I have to admit
that I might not have joined if I hadn't been
on the way to class and recognized some of
the protesters. But the longer I stayed, the
more convinced I became that despite
Proposition 209, Christian fundamentalists
and El Nino, things can change.
When did I stop believing in change? I
certainly believed more in the conse
quences of my actions when I was a kid. It
turned me into the kind of brat who said,
"Turn off the water, you're wasting it!" if
the kitchen faucet was on for longer than
two seconds. You see, I believed in the tele
vision commercial in which every time
someone flushes the toilet, the level of
water in a pond gets lower. I believed in
everything my teachers told me, and threw
tantrums when my parents didn't separate
white from glossy paper.
It's become increasingly difficult for me
to believe that an individual's actions can
have an effect. When Gloria Steinem gave

a talk at Stanford earlier this quarter, she
cited her habit of writing three to four let
ters a week, attending one demonstration a
month and donating 10 percent of her
income to social causes. This might sound
like a lot for an individual to accomplish,
but I am reminded of aspects of my former
residence. Synergy, that I didn't fully appre
ciate while I lived there. Fart of the house
budget was set aside for philanthropy. Two
women led letter-writing campaigns once a
week. Some residents instigated rallies. As
a house, we came remarkably close to act
ing on Steinem's precepts.
Change, they say, starts at home. But
changing something you can personally
control can be a lot harder than you think.
Take, for example, my two quarter-long
mission to set up a compost pile behind my
current house, Hammarskjold. There are a
few motives behind this goal. First, so that
we can properly dispose of our organic
waste. Secondly, so that we can become a
"real" co-op. Thirdly, there just so happens
to be three lovely bins in the backyard that
former residents, who possessed both envi
ronmental concern, and, more importantly,
carpentry skills, took the time and trouble
to build. Wherever they are now, I'm sure
they wouldn't be overjoyed to find out that
the product of their labor is no longer in
use.
They also wouldn't be too happy that
I've been sitting on this task for so long.

although I try to rationalize my idleness
with the unseasonable rain and the lack of
proper equipment. The truth is, 1 just
haven't devoted myself to acting on any
thing. Now, because I've waited so long, I
probably won't get to see any end results at
all. Although patience is pan pl'.lhe process
of change,- looking for iiWßt?dia4% effects
can lead to. digiUmionment.
As lniractanTe as this uruvenmy may
seem, the opportunities to instigate change
may be the best you'll ever find. When and
where else are you going to find such con
centrated, clarified rage against things most
people in the real world don't have time
for? The trouble is you've become preoccu
pied with something else. You've come to
college to change the way you think, but
somewhere along the way you've become
hung up on the "you."
It's so easy to think that just because you
can't change your life or who you are, you
can't change anything else around you.
Looking beyond yourself just might be eas
ier.
As last week's rally proved, you don't
even need to go off campus to find some
thing worth lending your support to. Just
find out about it soon enough so you can
give it the time to become fertile.

Wendy Lee, a senior majoring in modern
thought and literature, would like to remind
you that the smaller you are, the faster you rot.
