## T.J. Babbitt Experiencing American culture, German style 
### 
£ r | iHERE MUST BE a rule some
| where," my friend said, "that
■A. everything here has to be exactly
the same."
My feelings exactly. Here I had traveled
thousands of miles only to discover the
same clothes you can buy at The Gap on El
Camino, The Gap in the Stanford Shopping
Center or any one of the multiple Gaps on
San Francisco's Market Street.
We had, in fact, traveled thousands of
miles. We were, in fact, shopping at The
Gap.
We were not debating the root causes of
the rise of neo-fascist groups. We were not
raving our way through what is reported to
be the best "techno scene" in the whole
world. We were not staring at communist
architecture. We were not vowing to each
other to always remember and never forget.
We had already done those things, all in
the very first week.
We were thinking of buying new clothes,
and we were plowing through familiar mer
chandise. Everything was the same.
I am exaggerating. The typical German

is very different from the typical American.
University President Gerhard Casper
shares his humorous mannerisms and odd
way of looking at the world with millions of
people here in Central Europe.
At the same time, Germans have
replaced vast swaths of their culture and
values with our culture and values. And,
unlike other countries that have absorbed
American culture in weird and incongruous
ways, Germany seems to have gotten the
point. Germans really understand what the
culture they are appropriating is all about.
It would be simple for Stanford students
to coast through their time in this country
without noticing the deep chasm that sepa
rates the American mentality from the Ger
man one. Much is outwardly the same, and
the Stanford program smoothes over many
of the remaining differences.
This is both an advantage and a draw
back. It is, of course, nice to have the con
veniences of the mother ship in what is
admittedly a gritty and difficult city.
I check my e-mail daily on a Macintosh
computer in a computer cluster full of Stan

ford students. My school is in a leafy and
prosperous suburb which is beautiful but
relatively far from the center of the action.
The "campus" is modern and tastefully
decorated but altogether a bit bland. Every
one seems to be majoring in something pre
professional. The classes aren't uniformly
excellent, but there are great ones to be
found here and there. There are even some
thoughtful attempts to expose us to another
culture. Just like Stanford.
Too much like it. maybe? Some people,
knowing they need a break from the Stan
ford. wisely go to the Overseas Resource
Center and find a non-Stanford program to
attend. This can be more cost-effective and.
depending on the program, can give one
more of an immersion experience.
Certainly the philosophy of Stanford
programs is light-years away from that of
immersion.
Don't get me wrong. This is far from
deplorable. 1 would be loathe to attend an
actual German university, where quality
undergraduate education is even less of a
priority than in America.

Of course, it was vital to experience
Eddie Bauer and The Gap firsthand in
order to verily that fleece pullovers and
cargo pants are also widely available in Ger
many. (For the record, they also look silly
when Germans wear them.)
It would be easy to assume we are wast
ing our time here, choosing from a catalog
of courses taught mostly in English, e-mail
ing our friends back home and evaluating
the authenticity of European branches of
American retailers.
Most of us. though, come into contact
with German culture. And it the only way
we can fit that into our lives is to do it with
out missing even one quarter of a Stanford
tvpe education, so be it.
How much of the Farm should be
imported?
President Casper himself allocated the
funds for a high-speed video hookup to the
United States. This allows engineering stu
dents to enjoy the experience of being
abroad while still staying current with their
restrictive sequence of required courses.
Studv abroad no longer need be the

exclusive province of humanities students .
Computer scientists and engineers caii ben
efit equally from the mind-broadening
encounter with the Other.
While this is a laudable theory. IVn not
sure whether the result of the .video
hookups and super fast Internet connec
tions has been everything that Casper
hoped for.
The couple I live with has previously
hosted Stanford students. One of them,
they told me. was an engineering student.
"It was very strange," the wife told me.
"He brought his computer along with him,
and he spent virtually his entire time here in
his room working on it, and calling back to
Stanford through a modem hookup. He
went to the Stanford center about once a
week to turn in work."
Then the husband broke in wifh the
point of the story: "We asked him. What
did you come to Germany for? It would be
a lot easier to do that in California.' '■
