## Vanessa Nygaard and Olympia Scott drafted WNBA takes two 
### Ed Guzman Senior staff writer 
Apparently, the Utah Star/./, wanted to go
for size.
After choosing 7-foot-2 center Malgorza
ta Dydek of Poland with the first overall pick
of yesterday's WNBA draft, the Star/./ made
Stanford center Olympia Scott its second
round choice, 11 th overall.
Not to be outdone, the New York Liberty
chose Cardinal co-captain Vanessa Nygaard
late in the fourth round (39th overall).
Scott, who signed on with the WNBA
April 9, finished last season averaging 17.5
points and 7.5 rebounds per contest, placing
her second on the Stanford squad in both cat
egories.
Her scoring average was fourth in the Pa
cific 10 Conference, while her rebounding
numbers put her second in the league.
The senior center set career highs in scor
ing and rebounds this year, racking up 33
points against Colorado and grabbing 16 re
bounds against Oregon. She led the team in
scoring on nine occasions; her 1,524 career
points rank her eighth on Stanford's all-time
scoring list.
For Scott, going for the WNBA was a pret
ty easy choice.
"I really like the support the WNBA has
received, and they provide great marketing
opportunities," she said. "I also like the cities
where WNBA teams are located, so it was at

tractive in terms of places to live. It is my in
tent to go to graduate school, so the schedule
works in my favor."
As for Nygaard. it looked like her anterior
cruciate ligament injury might keep her from
getting drafted.
Because she clearly is not healthy enough
to participate in local team tryouts this week
end. she had only two options: get drafted or
be unemployed while rehabilitating her right
knee.
But the Liberty, holding the next-to-last
pick of the draft, came through.
Nygaard could not be reached for com
ment last night.
When healthy, Nygaard was one of the
most prolific three-point shooters in the
country.
Her 210 career treys are both a school and
Pac-10 record. Additionally, the fifth-year se
nior was one of the team's best free-throw
shooters, shooting 75 percent from the line
last season.
She scored her I,oooth career point
against Connecticut and finished with 1,279
points, 14th all-time among Stanford play
ers.
Both Scott and Nygaard certainly feel
ready to play beyond Maples Pavilion.
"Stanford has a great fan base and a sup
portive academic environment, but I am anx
ious to experience the next level," Scott said.
"It makes it somewhat easier to leave know
ing that I have more basketball to play."
