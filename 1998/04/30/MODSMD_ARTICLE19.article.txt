# Reality check on the Farm

### 
Editor's note: Some of the stories told here may
not he real. Looks hack at the past always have an el
ement of imagination....
Until last fall I. Ben, thought 1 could make the
Cardinal baseball team as a walk-on.
So what if my most infamous baseball accom
plishments to date included a four-game stint bat
ting leadoff for my Little League team in sixth
grade? I'd been a heck of a bunter, right? And
rumor had it that Jay Pecci — this season's starting
shortstop for the Cardinal — walked onto the team
three years ago.
I'm almost convincing myself again.

This time 1 recognize what's going on. It's the
lightness of spring's breath, the feel of the hot
ground under my feet as 1 walk to the library, the
smell of freshly cut grass. It all makes lor grand ex
pectations and vaunted sports hopes. It's what
spring does to people.
So at this time last year, remembering my glory
days at second base with the D.L. Hunt Construc
tion-sponsored Astros in the Los Gatos Little
League, I grabbed my mitt and my friend. He
brought a dinky 26-inch aluminum baseball bat left
over from his Little League days, and we shagged a
few on Wilbur Field.
But I was somewhere else altogether.
It was the ninth inning of the semifinals of the
College World Series — wait, make that the cham
pionship game. And the score was tied — no. we
were down by one. Full count.
My friend threw a two-cent knuckleball, the im
provised kind. It must have been going about 4<)
mph.
And in particularly ridiculous and gawky style. I
whiffed big. 1 didn't hit anything.
I'm not exactly Jody Gerut.
The scene came rushing back to me last week
end. when I finally bought a better bat. I"he new
one is a trim, black 32-incher, light enough to go
around crisply and get a hold of balls. It feels good
and natural
Hut befi re I could start thinking about extra-in
ning at ba) in ()r.iaha, I realized with a short gasp
that I wasi, going to make the Cardinal baseball
team this season, either.
Now Ben isn't the only on to have had a rude
awakening l the world of coll iate athletics upon
arrival on th Farm.
I.Jen, wa ,i die-hard soft ball player in my previ
ous, I mean | e-college. life as an athlete.

Whereas Ben made his mark at
the plate, I was renowned for my
glove skills. J. Edgar they called me
— as in Hoover, as in the vacuum
cleaner. Anything that came my way
would be sucked up.
In Westchester Little League. I
was the shortstop. The go-to gal.
Double-plays, 6-3 putouts — they
were my specialties. I had a brief stint
as a pitcher but then moved around
the infield to third and then second.
Freshman year at Crossroads
High Schcx)l came around, and my
team was excellent. We're talking
top-notch, cream-of-the-crop. de
fending ("IF champions.
Yet lo and behold, I managed to
make the team. Maybe it was the
heart, the hustle. Or maybe it was the
lack of a JV squad. My best fnend
Kaci and I formed our own team:
RTPS. Riding The Pine Sucks. But I
was on the team. It was all worth it.
Sophomore year, I broke into the
starting lineup. Right-field for a sea
son. junior year over to left. And by
senior year. I anchored the outfield
from center. I was high as a kite, co
captain and team leader. If I could
work my way up the ranks in high
school, why not try it at Stanford'.'
Free Nike gear and the infamous ath

lete formal lay in my near future.
And then the reality hit. High
school softball is one thing, and col
lege ball is another. There is a big dif
ference between hitting a pitch com
ing at 45 mph and one at 65 mph that
drops just as you begin to swing at it.
Ninety-minute practices at (lover
Park three times a week are one
thing, whereas lifting weights before
class, a three-hour practice in the af
ternoon and road trips every other
weekend are another. My idea of a
road trip was taking the bus "The
Valley" to play Harvard-Westlake.
Stanford has perhaps the greatest
athletics department in the history of
higher education — whether you
count depth or breadth. But that
might not always be a plus for the rest
of us. the students who can t run a
mile in under four minutes.
Some people may never take bat
ting practice on Sunken Diamond or
shi*)t hoops in Maples, but there are
opportunities for recreational ath
letes to get out onto the court — or
onto the field or in the pool.
So turn off Ally McßeaJ. finish
your last e-mail and go do it.
The Bay to Breakers race is com
ing up. and you don't need a Stanford
uniform to run in it.

Hch iuhJ Jen giv* a shout out to the
Daily staffers whi) kicked somf so ft
hall-ass Saturday.
