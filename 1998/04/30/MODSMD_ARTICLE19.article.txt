# Reality check on the Farm

### 
Editor's note: Some of the stories told here may
not he real. Looks hack at the past always have an el
ement of imagination....
Until last fall I. Ben, thought 1 could make the
Cardinal baseball team as a walk-on.
So what if my most infamous baseball accom
plishments to date included a four-game stint bat
ting leadoff for my Little League team in sixth
grade? I'd been a heck of a bunter, right? And
rumor had it that Jay Pecci — this season's starting
shortstop for the Cardinal — walked onto the team
three years ago.
I'm almost convincing myself again.

This time 1 recognize what's going on. It's the
lightness of spring's breath, the feel of the hot
ground under my feet as 1 walk to the library, the
smell of freshly cut grass. It all makes lor grand ex
pectations and vaunted sports hopes. It's what
spring does to people.
So at this time last year, remembering my glory
days at second base with the D.L. Hunt Construc
tion-sponsored Astros in the Los Gatos Little
League, I grabbed my mitt and my friend. He
brought a dinky 26-inch aluminum baseball bat left
over from his Little League days, and we shagged a
few on Wilbur Field.
But I was somewhere else altogether.
It was the ninth inning of the semifinals of the
College World Series — wait, make that the cham
pionship game. And the score was tied — no. we
were down by one. Full count.
My friend threw a two-cent knuckleball, the im
provised kind. It must have been going about 4<)
mph.
And in particularly ridiculous and gawky style. I
whiffed big. 1 didn't hit anything.
I'm not exactly Jody Gerut.
The scene came rushing back to me last week
end. when I finally bought a better bat. I"he new
one is a trim, black 32-incher, light enough to go
around crisply and get a hold of balls. It feels good
and natural
Hut befi re I could start thinking about extra-in
ning at ba) in ()r.iaha, I realized with a short gasp
that I wasi, going to make the Cardinal baseball
team this season, either.
Now Ben isn't the only on to have had a rude
awakening l the world of coll iate athletics upon
arrival on th Farm.
I.Jen, wa ,i die-hard soft ball player in my previ
ous, I mean | e-college. life as an athlete.
