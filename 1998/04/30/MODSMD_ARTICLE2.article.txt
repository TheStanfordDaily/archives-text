# Ten years at the helm
## Dean reviews his GSB term 
### Bruce Wang Contributing writer 
After a decade as dean of the Graduate School of Busi
ness, Michael Spence looked back on the tremendous
amount of change that has occurred in the business world
and was proud of the fact that the school has adapted itself so
well.
Spence's decision to step down from his post was an
nounced by Provost Condolcezza Rice at the April 16 Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
"The decision was made a couple of months ago," Spence
said. "Nine years is a good time. I wanted the next dean to
have the 75th anniversary of the Business School." The
length of Spence's term follows a tradition set by the last four
deans.
I Jnder Spence's leadership during the last decade, the
Business School has built relationships between researchers
and business and industry leaders. It has also put more em
phasis on global management issues, the management of
technology and entrepreneurship.
Spence "has been willing to establish a pattern of change
in the school, particularly to lead and provoke change to
bring the school to deal with the next century," said Robert
Flanagan, associate dean of academics at the Business
School. "He's emphasized field research, to balance faculty
interests in academics and research with firsthand experi
ence in the industry and the world economy."
I laving a better connection tothe business world without
losing the academic focus and research was one of Spence's
goals for his tenure.
"If you look at the Business School.you'll sec that asa re
sult of the efforts of the faculty and the students, we've gone
through an interesting transition. We've been able to retain
our academic root while at the same time become better con
nected to the business world." Spence said.
"1 wanted to make sure that the schix>l continues its tra
jectory as one of the best schools in the country, and it's been
that way. I didn't have a long list of goals in I WO. but the gen
eral direction of the school has been where I wanted it to go."
To meet the demands of the changing business world.
Spence has implemented changes in the core curriculum and
introduced new programs such as the Global Management
Program and Information Technology classes. Spence also
said the school has taken advantage
of its closeness to the Silicon Valley in
adapting to the new high-tech mar
ket. During the Spence years, the
school also constructed the $31 mil
lion Schwab Residential Learning
("enter, established the Center for
Entrepreneurial Studies, and raised
over $120 million to support the pro
grams at the school.

"I've tried to make sure that there
are resources, both human and finan
cial. available so that whatever the
students and faculty wanted would
get accomplished," Spence said. "The
school is in reasonably good shape
going into the next century. We have
outstanding faculty and tremendous
students."
This year, the school saw an all
time high of 7 .(XX) applicants for the
36() spaces in next year's entering
MBA class. Spence said that several
challenges face the school in the up

coming century and his successor.
"Adapting to the fast pace of the
global economy is a continuing chal
lenge."
Another issue is the size of the
Business School. "We've always been
a small, tight-knit school," Spence
said. "Being small has its good fea
tures. but we can't stay the same for
ever. We have to change."
After stepping down, Spence said
he would take a year off to "do some
reading and catch up on the academ
ic work." He would also like to teach

again.
According to Kathv Gillam, se
nior associate provost, "The provost
has not begun the search vet for the
new dean." Provost Rice is expected
to start the search during the summer.
When asked what his favorite
memories of his tenure are, Spence
said, "What makes this job so great is
that you get to work with really
tremendous faculty and outstanding
staff. The students are tremendously
imaginative. I'll remember the joy of
working with such generous people.
