Despite holding fourth place after
three rounds at the Pacific lOConfer
ence Championships in Orinda,
Calif., the Stanford men's golf team
couldn't hang on.
Strong finishes by UCLA and
Washington combined with Stan
ford's disastrous final-round score of
K1 to drop the Cardinal to sixth over
all.

MEN'S GOLF

■ Yesterday: Stanford placed sixth in
the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships in Orinda, Calif. Individual
ly, junior Joel Kribel placed second.

The team was once again led by
junior Joel Kribel, whose four-round
score 0f285 tied forsecond place with
California's Dan Arroyo.
Kribel entered the clubhouse
Monday tied for third with a com
bined 139, having started strong with
an opening round 69. Arizona State's
Paul Casey captured the individual
title with a total score of 283.
It was Kribel's ninth top-10 finish
in 10 tournaments this season, leav
ing him ranked 15th in the nation.
Cardinal freshman James Lee tied
for 24th overall with a final score of
295, followed by sophomore Dusty
Brett's 31st overall 298. Freshman

Alex Aragon and senior Eri Crum
rounded out Stanford's scoring by
shooting 3(X) and 301. respectively.
It was Stanford's disappointing
final round that kept the team from a
top-five finish. After scores of 69. 69
and 70, Kribel posted a 76 on
Wednesday, eliminating his chances
at the individual title. Brett and
Aragon shot 77 and 7K, costing them
valuable places.
Arizona State won its fourth
straight league championship with a
four-over-par 1,444, one stroke lower
than last year's winning score. UCLA
and Arizona followed at 1,455 and
1,459, respectively, while Cal and
Washington rounded out the top five.
Stanford's sixth-place finish
leaves the team's near future uncer
tain. Given the strength of the Pac-10
(seven of its teams are ranked in the
top 50 nationally), the NCAA selec
tion committee may still include the
Cardinal in the championship field of
12.
However, a top-five finish would
have gone much further to convince
the committee of the team's merits,
and a last-round collapse does not
bode well for NCAA competition.
The committee's decision will be
announced Tuesday. If selected,
Stanford will compete in the West
Region Championships May 14-16 at
the Karsten Golf Course in Tempe.
Ariz.
