# A 						roller-coaster career
## Bleszynski back on the winning path 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
It's been a roller-coaster ride of sorts for
Ania Bleszynski in her Stanford women's
tennis career, but the senior is doing her best
to make sure that it ends up on top.
A year after playing in the No. 1 singles
position for the Cardinal as a sophomore and
advancing to the semifinals in both the
NCAA singles and doubles draws, Bleszyns
ki was taken out of the singles lineup in front
of last season's home crowd as the Cardinal
blew past the field on its way to a national
title.
Now. Bleszynski is back to playing true to
her three-time All-American form. At the
No. 4 singles spot. Bleszynski posted the onh
undefeated conference record on the team
and is currently on a nine-match winning
streak. After rolling off 12 wins in her last 13
matches, she finished with a dual-match
record of 20-3 and an overall record of 27-7.
"She had to come back for us. and she
did." Stanford head coach Frank Brennan
said of Bleszynski. whom he called the X fac
tor at the beginning of the season. "The jury
is in.and it was a complete and total success
for her. She just had a great year."
In her last action until next month's

NCAA Championships. Bleszynski won the
Pac-10 doubles championship with fellow s>£

nals in the singles draw.
Bleszynski's sophomore season was e\en
more successful. She compiled a respectable
17-9 record in the No. 1 singles spot, reached
the semifinals at NCAAs in both singles an<J>
doubles, upset defending national champidp
and heavy favorite Keri Phebus in the quar*
terfinals and finished the year ranked No. 4 in
the nation.

Senior Ania Bieszynski's tennis carreer at Stanford has had its ups
and downs, but she's shooting for one more accomplishment — an
other NCAA title.
ski to swallow.
"I was caught up in the fact that I
was playing lower," Bleszynski said.
"I was caught up in that instead of fo
cusing on my game."
Bleszynski did put together a 21-
4 record for the dual-match season,
31-9 overall. But when Brennan re
alized that Bleszynski perhaps didn't
have her heart in it, the multiple
NCAA championship-winning
coach pulled Bleszynski out of the
singles lineup in favor of then-fresh
man Teryn Ashley, who had yet to
lose a dual match the entire season.
"It was a coach's decision," Bren
nan said. "We had to decide at that
point what would help us most.
Teryn was really on a roll, and Ania

was thinking too much."
The Cardinal ran through oppo
nents on its way to a ninth NCAA
title in front of a huge home crowd in
the new and improved Taube Fami
ly Tennis Stadium. In fact, the Card
was never taken to doubles in four
matches, leaving Bleszynski off the
court completely.
"That was the worst, especially
because NCAAs were at home,"
Bleszynski said. "Not playing was
tough, but it was probably better for
the team."
But this season, Bleszynski fig
ures to be a crucial player in Stan
ford's defense of its national title at
Notre Dame beginning May 21.
Brennan considers Bleszynski to be
a huge factor in the Cardinal lineup.
"She has been playing better and
better every week," Brennan said.
"She is looking really good. People

at [the Pac-10 championships] were
remarking at her being back to play
ing her game, her style, at that level."
Bleszynski's attitude is different
this season as well. She has looked
comfortable in her position this sea
son, and her play has benefited.
"Compared to last year, I was a
lot better this season," Bleszynski
said. "Mostly, my attitude is differ
ent. I'm a lot happier, and I have
more fun with it instead of being so
caught up in everything. I decided I
wasn't going to worry about [the
lineup), and it's been a much more
rewarding season because of that."
Brennan agreed that Bleszynski's
attitude has changed for the better.
"It was obvious last year that she
wasn't having fun," the coach said.
"This year she is smiling — she's en
joying her hours on the court. She
was intelligent to make that her only

goal. It wasn't to play No. 1 or win
the NCAAs. It was to have fun. and
that was smart. The rest of the stuff
comes along with that."
The Cardinal has certainly ben
efited from Bleszynski's attitude.
She earned crucial victories in each
of five extremely narrow 5-4 con
ference wins this season.
"Now I am just motivated to
play well wherever coach puts me,"
Bleszynski said. "I would love to be
up there in the lineup, but my team
mates ahead of me are awesome. I
am happy where I am, and that has
helped me play better."
Her play to close out the regular
season and at the Pac-10 Confer
ence Championships perhaps
earned her a spot in the NCAA
singles draw and ensured her a top
seed in the doubles draw with
Scott.

"Pac-lOs were especially satisfy
ing because I got to play against
some of the girls 1 used to play at
No. 1," Hles/.ynski said, referring
specifically to a first-round win
over former Pac-10 Player of the
Year Vicky Maes. "Even when I
was a sophomore I couldn't heat
her. so it was exciting to be back
playing at that level."
Bleszynski definitely has her
eyes set on national titles.
"For the team, this year is much
more of a challenge than last year
because we are not as strong and
being a senior. I am definitely more
motivated for this one than any
other one," Bleszynski said.
"Hopefully. I will get into the sin
gles draw. and it would be awesome
to win doubles with Julie. I love
playing with her. We have beaten
all of the other favorites at some

point. It would he a nice way to cap
it off for two seniors."
Bleszynski and Scott have al
ready captured two major doubles
championships this season, their
second-straight Rolex National In
door title and the Pac-10 doubles
crown. They advanced to the
NCAA semifinals last season be
fore being eliminated.
"They have played some great
doubles." Brennan said. "They
have wins over the defending na
tional champions, so I like their
chances if they play them again.
They are definitely one of the top
couple teams."
In recognition of Bleszynski's
turnaround, the team will present
the senior with the second-ever
Michelle Weiss Award today in
recognition of courage, leadership
and competitiveness.
