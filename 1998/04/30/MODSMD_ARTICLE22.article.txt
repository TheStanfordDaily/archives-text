# Striking a balance
## Paul Goldstein leaves a legacy behind on both Cardinal tennis and Stanford 
### Jessica Lan Staff writer 
When Paul Goldstein arrived at Stanford
his freshman year, there was never any
doubt he would be a success.
With three national age-group champi
onships in hand before his Stanford career,
he was going places.
Goldstein was courted by top schools
both academically and within the tennis
realm, such as Harvard and Duke, but he
said he knew where he fit in from the start.
"It was a relatively easy decision. For me,
Stanford was just the right combination as
far as the reputation for academics and ath
letics," he said. "1 tried to go in with an open
mind, but 1 knew I wanted to go to Stanford.
1 didn't seriously consider any other
school."
Once on the Farm. Goldstein acted like
any other freshman — excited to do every
thing and wanting to "get the entire Stanford
experience."
Although he did not come in with any ex
pectations of college, Goldstein said he still
had expectations for himself.
"I wanted to thrive academically, socially
and athletically. To me, these are the three

most important things. It's incredibly diffi
cult to balance all three."
Goldstein said he had a difficult time ad
justing to his overloaded life at Stanford. He
was surprised to find achieving in those three
areas was more difficult than it had been in
high school.
Goldstein said he found the entire bal
ancing act a vicious cycle. The more effort he
put into one area, the more he suffered in an
other.
"The most difficult thing for me was ac
cepting the fact that I wouldn't thrive as
much as 1 could have academically, socially
and athletically." Goldstein said. "1 beat my
self up a lot in my mind and made it a lot
more difficult than 1 had to. But 1 think in the
last year and a half. I have had a much better
perspective."
Although pressed for time, Goldstein
said he feels he has struck a balance among
all the aspects of his Stanford career.
The trick is balance, not putting one as
pect too much ahead of another," he said. "I
think that's the greatest challenge for any
athlete at Stanford."
Goldstein said he has found time for all

three of the aspects of his life he
values most.
He has also been involved with
volunteer organizations including
the East Palo Alto Tennis and Tu
toring program and Realizing In
tellect through Self-Empower
ment, a mentoring and tutoring
program for African-American
students at Menlo Atherton High
School.
Considering all that, there is
only one thing Goldstein regrets.
"Well, I've never been to
Yosemite," he laughed. "I've had a
great time. Now I feel like I'm part
of the tennis program forever.
Stanford tennis will always be with
me."
At 21, Goldstein has accom
plished more than anyone could
have imagined and more than even
he expected.
With three junior national titles
under his belt and the top ranks in
his age divisions, he has received
countless sportsmanship awards,
including the prestigious Rafael
Osuna Award given to the "colle
giate player best exemplifying
competitive excellence, sports
manship and contributions to the
game/'

At Stanford, Goldstein is a
three-time All-American and two
time All-Pacific 10 Conference.
In addition, he has been a part of
an undefeated team, has put for
ward a perfect singles record so far
this year and just captured the Pac
-10 singles championship last week
end.
"Success is so fun," Goldstein
said. "But I don't take that for
granted. I know how much hard
work it takes to achieve that suc
cess."
Head coach Dick Gould said
Goldstein has been invaluable to
Stanford tennis for both his talent
and his influence.
Gould credits Goldstein as one
of the main reasons the team is in
excellent position to win a fourth
consecutive NCAA champi
onship.
"Paul is the kind of guy who
breeds winning," Gould said. "His
presence has always led to that.
"He has been a tremendous ex
ample through his personal val
ues, work ethic, selflessness, com
mitment to athletics and acade
mics and by the realization that
what we do is just part of the big
picture."
Goldstein agrees that tennis
skills are only a small part of what
he will take away from Stanford.
He said the more important lessons

he has learned are from the organi
zational and operational perspec
tive.
"I've had priceless experiences
with the team. As for Coach Gould,
I can't imagine anyone running a
better program.
" The lessons I've learned from
Gould are invaluable. He's taught
me more than anyone could teach
me on the court."
Gould said the respect is mutu
al.
"Respect always works two
ways," Gould said. "We've been
very lucky to have Paul in every re
spect.
"He epitomizes the Stanford
student-athlete.
"What he has done for Stanford
and our program's reputation has
been priceless."
After graduating this spring
with a degree in human biology,
the first order of business for Gold
stein will be as co-best man at his
brother's wedding. After that,
there's more tennis in store for
Goldstein.
"I'm going to go pro and see if I
can't win a match or two," he said.
Goldstein will compete profes
sionally in both singles and dou
bles.
He said he plans to compete as
long as he can before he regies
from professional play and begins

to "make use of my Stanford edu
cation."
Gould predicted that Goldstein
will fare well in professional com
petition.
"Paul is one of the best doubles
players we've ever had. His ability
to focus, his footspeed and his
ability to play an all-around game
will compensate for his not having
one devastating shot, like a big
forehand or a big serve," Gould
said.
"If he stays with tennis, I think
he will be one of the world's top-10
doubles players."
Overall. Goldstein has been ec
static with his tennis career and
said he is happy with what he has
done so far.
"If someone told me that I
would have the chance to win seven
consecutive national champi
onships before I started, I would
have said, 'Forget about it. there's
no way.' I didn't expect this in the
least," he said.
"I've learned that you don't
focus on the outcomes. Just focus
on the process, and the outcomes
will follow. "
For now, Goldstein said he feels
he has accomplished what he had
set out to do.
"I've had an enormous amount
of help," he said. "And it's been a
great, great ride."

an undefeated team, has put for
ward a perfect singles record so far
this year and just captured the Pac
-10 singles championship last week
end.
"Success is so fun," Goldstein
said. "But I don't take that for
granted. I know how much hard
work it takes to achieve that suc
cess."
Head coach Dick Gould said
Goldstein has been invaluable to
Stanford tennis for both his talent
and his influence.
Gould credits Goldstein as one
of the main reasons the team is in
excellent position to win a fourth
consecutive NCAA champi
onship.
"Paul is the kind of guy who
breeds winning," Gould said. "His
presence has always led to that.
"He has been a tremendous ex
ample through his personal val
ues, work ethic, selflessness, com
mitment to athletics and acade
mics and by the realization that
what we do is just part of the big
picture."
Goldstein agrees that tennis
skills are only a small part of what
he will take away from Stanford.
He said the more important lessons

he has learned are from the organi
zational and operational perspec
tive.
"I've had priceless experiences
with the team. As for Coach Gould,
I can't imagine anyone running a
better program.
" The lessons I've learned from
Gould are invaluable. He's taught
me more than anyone could teach
me on the court."
Gould said the respect is mutu
al.
"Respect always works two
ways," Gould said. "We've been
very lucky to have Paul in every re
spect.
"He epitomizes the Stanford
student-athlete.
"What he has done for Stanford
and our program's reputation has
been priceless."
After graduating this spring
with a degree in human biology,
the first order of business for Gold
stein will be as co-best man at his
brother's wedding. After that,
there's more tennis in store for
Goldstein.
"I'm going to go pro and see if I
can't win a match or two," he said.
Goldstein will compete profes
sionally in both singles and dou
bles.
He said he plans to compete as
long as he can before he regies
from professional play and begins

to "make use of my Stanford edu
cation."
Gould predicted that Goldstein
will fare well in professional com
petition.
"Paul is one of the best doubles
players we've ever had. His ability
to focus, his footspeed and his
ability to play an all-around game
will compensate for his not having
one devastating shot, like a big
forehand or a big serve," Gould
said.
"If he stays with tennis, I think
he will be one of the world's top-10
doubles players."
Overall. Goldstein has been ec
static with his tennis career and
said he is happy with what he has
done so far.
"If someone told me that I
would have the chance to win seven
consecutive national champi
onships before I started, I would
have said, 'Forget about it. there's
no way.' I didn't expect this in the
least," he said.
"I've learned that you don't
focus on the outcomes. Just focus
on the process, and the outcomes
will follow. "
For now, Goldstein said he feels
he has accomplished what he had
set out to do.
"I've had an enormous amount
of help," he said. "And it's been a
great, great ride."
