# Striking a balance
## Paul Goldstein leaves a legacy behind on both Cardinal tennis and Stanford 
### Jessica Lan Staff writer 
When Paul Goldstein arrived at Stanford
his freshman year, there was never any
doubt he would be a success.
With three national age-group champi
onships in hand before his Stanford career,
he was going places.
Goldstein was courted by top schools
both academically and within the tennis
realm, such as Harvard and Duke, but he
said he knew where he fit in from the start.
"It was a relatively easy decision. For me,
Stanford was just the right combination as
far as the reputation for academics and ath
letics," he said. "1 tried to go in with an open
mind, but 1 knew I wanted to go to Stanford.
1 didn't seriously consider any other
school."
Once on the Farm. Goldstein acted like
any other freshman — excited to do every
thing and wanting to "get the entire Stanford
experience."
Although he did not come in with any ex
pectations of college, Goldstein said he still
had expectations for himself.
"I wanted to thrive academically, socially
and athletically. To me, these are the three

most important things. It's incredibly diffi
cult to balance all three."
Goldstein said he had a difficult time ad
justing to his overloaded life at Stanford. He
was surprised to find achieving in those three
areas was more difficult than it had been in
high school.
Goldstein said he found the entire bal
ancing act a vicious cycle. The more effort he
put into one area, the more he suffered in an
other.
"The most difficult thing for me was ac
cepting the fact that I wouldn't thrive as
much as 1 could have academically, socially
and athletically." Goldstein said. "1 beat my
self up a lot in my mind and made it a lot
more difficult than 1 had to. But 1 think in the
last year and a half. I have had a much better
perspective."
Although pressed for time, Goldstein
said he feels he has struck a balance among
all the aspects of his Stanford career.
The trick is balance, not putting one as
pect too much ahead of another," he said. "I
think that's the greatest challenge for any
athlete at Stanford."
Goldstein said he has found time for all
