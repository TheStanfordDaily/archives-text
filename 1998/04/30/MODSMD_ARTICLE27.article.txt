# ASSU seeks gratis' opinions in survey

### Jennifer Godwin Staff writer 
The Graduate Student Council
has come out with a new online hous
ing survey, which hopes to discover
what the current housing situation of
graduate students is. how graduate
students feel about it and how they
would like to see things improve.
I he council, which is part of the
ASSU. hopes to entice participants
to the site with cash prizes.
According to Stacy Kerkela. a
member of the council and a master's
student in geophysics, "We're look
ing for graduate student input on
what they really want. We hope to in
fluence the type and quantity of new
graduate student housing."
The survey will be posted until
May 8, and the results are expected to
be available by May 11. "We had 500
visitors the first day and we're going
to keep it up for a week and a half,"
Kerkela said. The survey has both
on-campus and off-campus versions
to account for the various possible
living situations.
"We hope the administration will
be inspired to take a more compre
hensive survey of graduate student
needs," Kerkela said.
Jesse Adams, a master's student
in mechanical engineering and a
graduate resident assistant in
Crothers Memorial, added. "There's
a lot of dissatisfaction with the way
giaduate students are being treated
when it comes to housing,."

Questions on the on-campus resi
dence surveys ask where students
currently live, what their income is,
what fraction of the student's income
is currently devoted to rent, and why
students will or w ill not choose to live
on campus next year. The off-campus
version includes questions as to
whether the University is doing
enough to "meet student housing
needs in light of the off-campus hous
ing market."
Certain questions focus on the
role of graduate RAs. Kerkela says,
"We're trying to protest the elimina
tion of G RAs."
Questions regarding graduate stu
dents' general satisfaction with their
housing situation are also included.
Isolation from the graduate student
community is another concern of the
survey. Both surveys include queries
about the cost and availability of
parking.
Kerkela said the council is hoping
the cash prizes will be "an added in
centive." Everyone who fills out the
survey gets a shot in a drawing for the
prizes. The grand prize is $250, one
$ 1 (X) prize and three $50 prizes.
