# Later but not less
## Nontraditional students pick up the books

For most college students, the un
dergraduate experience follows im
mediately after high school, with
maybe a year off to tour Europe or
earn some money.
But for more than 1(H) unconven
tional undergraduates, there is a
longer delay between the end of high
school and the pursuit of a bachelor's
degree.
Grant Cutting, a 37-year-old se
nior. went to a trade school after high
school and studied diesel mechanics.
He was in the Navy for three years
and then managed bars for a while.
Afterward, he enlisted in the Army
in Special Forces. In 1991, he headed
back to school and transferred here
from a junior college in San Diego.
The decision to return to college
is motivated by a desire for the added
training and education that a higher
education provides. Older students

have plenty of life experience but
perhaps not the degree that a chosen
career path requires.
"1 decided to go back to school for
pre-med, to go to medical school,"
Cutting said.
One undeclared junior, who said
only that he is over 25. said, "The
biggest thing [about returning to
school] is that I looked at my profes
sion — 1 was interested in it. but I
wanted to do more. 1 felt that I had a
responsibility to myself to develop
my talents as best I could."
"I felt that I would give my life
more meaning if I went further with
my education. There's a sense of
pride knowing you've completed
your degree, and 1 also wanted to do
basic research."
When undergraduates learn an
older student's age and their cir
cuitous path to Stanford, the reaction
could be a mixture of surprise, cha
grin or cheerful support.
The undeclared junior said.

"There are various reactions. For the
most part people aren't aware, but
some do know, and react. It's almost
as if all other aspects of you as an in
dividual are not important. 1 had one
person say, 'Aren't you a little old to
be here?'"
"Right off the cuff, I tend to keep
my age to myself because I tend to
find people tend to react to you as a
person rather than an age range." he
said. "Some people find out that
you're older — they begin to treat
you differently."
He believes that the reaction de
pends on the individual and what
preconceived notions they come into
the relationship with.
Both Cutting and the others say
that their friends are supportive and
express their congratulations at what
they're doing for the most part.
The educational experience has
been a success for both students, but
Cutting said he has run into some
surprises.

" Actually, the size of the classes is
larger than I expected for the major
ity of classes," he said. "I don't feel
the teacher to student ratio is what it
should be in introductory classes."
When asked what advice they
might give to someone considering
returning to college after a long time
away, they both said age is not a rea
son to hold back.
The junior said, "I would say that
if someone has the desire to do this,
do it. Don't let anyone — to use a
Baptist phrase — turn you around.
People will say to you that you're
going to be this age (after gradua
tion!. What does it matter? I'm not
dead."
Cutting commented on age and
new experiences: "It seems to come
as an excuse: I'm too old. But if you
wait, you'll be that old anyway. Try
something new. Do something
worthwhile."
Sound advice for anyone, of what
ever age or aspirations.
