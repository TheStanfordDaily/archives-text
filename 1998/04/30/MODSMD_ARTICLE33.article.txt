## Romance, Technology and Landscape meet at Stanford Art Spaces 
### Meredith Alexander Contributing writer 
Walking into Gates Computer Science Building or
Terman Engineering Center these days, you may do a
double take — the walls are covered in vivid color. It's
not because of a recent paint job. Rather, it's part of the
little-known exhibit, "Stanford Art Spaces," which
brings the work of local artists to campus.
A lot of students don't realize that those paintings and
images on the walls are part of an exhibit. Gates, Terman,
Humanities and Sciences (Building 1) and the Center for
Integrated Studies building have been designated as
Stanford Art Spaces. The exhibit spans all four buildings,
with much of the work concentrated in C.I.S.
According to Marilyn Grossman, the curator of the
exhibit, the logistics of having the exhibit spread over
four buildings means that she doesn't have to try to
match artists with similar styles in a single location.
The exhibit is composed of work by Daniela,
Patricia Sherwood and Craig Schindler. The threads
that tie together the work of these artists are their play
ful use of color and their awareness of the power of ab
straction within a figurative world. None of these
artists aims at pure realism; each conducts a series of
experiments that unite the realistic (or, in the artists'
word, "figurative") with shapes and lines never found
in nature. By combining representative and abstract
figures, the artists each make a personal statement.
Daniela — who goes by her first name only — uses
color unsparingly in her work. Her pieces exude a sense
of joyous emotion, which she highlights as a major goal.
"I like to use bright and lively colors," Daniela said, "and
lines that are soothing."
Her curvaceous lines repeat themselves with slight
variations. Colors fade off into white, and shapes come
together seamlessly, recalling certain early Cubist ges
tures. Indeed, Daniela's "Intrigue II" recalls some of
Fernand Lager's more abstract work. While L£ger used
Cubist-influenced lines and smooth forms to represent
the cold surfaces of machines, Daniela turns her focus
toward the warm embraces of abstracted couples.
A native of Switzerland who grew up speaking Italian,
Daniela longs for a lost joie de vivre. As she commented,
"I'm a very positive person. We see so many sad things
in the world. Although it's pretty naive, I'm a romantic
person. Most of my paintings represent two people.
"I think there isn't enough love any more — we're in
a pretty materialistic world. It's nice to remember those
old virtues, those old feelings. In this stressful world, we
forget about those things."
Daniela's romantic view shows in her work. In her
"Mano della Mano," graded pastel shades represent a
stylized couple holding hands.

Craig Schindler's work shows a different side of the
abstracted human form. Schindler is a digital artist who
makes his images using Macintosh computers. Schindler
constructs three-dimensional human forms which he
"composes into a spatial arrangement, wrapping colors,
patterns and textures around each object."
After adding what he calls "simulated lights," Schindler
adjusts the angle and depth, ending with a "photo-surre
alistic image." His goal is to "create a mythology for syn
thetic life, a mythology that is both sensual and mechan
ical, both realistic and surrealistic."
In his portion of the exhibit, computer-generated im
ages stand out as being particularly appropriate to their
viewing space in new, technology-centered buildings.
Some of the images, however, are difficult to see because
of printing and framing problems.
One picture, entitled "Couple," shows how different
Schindler's work is from Daniela's. A smoothed-out
man and a woman face each other; the male figure is
right side up while the female is upside down. The im
ages appear robotic and cold. This piece illustrates the
sense of alienation that these computer images generate
when viewed alongside the romantic curves of Daniela.
In some of his images, however, Schindler manages to
create an intriguing alternate world. The mix of geo
metrically straight lines and disruptive curves in
"Fractured Karma" shows the power of combining the
abstract with the figurative. In yellow and black, a
smooth figure makes lines all around him ripple like wa
ter as he rises through its surface.
While Schindler's work is the kind of computer-dri
ven graphic art that is becoming common on televi
sion and in film, Patricia Sherwood's paintings come
out of a tradition of abstract painting that emphasizes
the relationship among the artist and the materials of
paint and canvas.
Sherwood's textured surfaces show signs of being
worked and reworked. In her richly-colored work she
plays with the notion of the landscape by reconfiguring
it. As she lays out spaces of green and tan, the viewer
starts to trace a road that stretches into a cream-colored
sky. Instead, the scene is suddenly broken by other lines,
other possible interpretations.
Inspiration for Sherwood's art sprang from her own
childhood experiences with the physical landscape. "I
grew up in the wide open spaces in the desert country
of the U. 5.," she said.
"I spent my childhood in a car. My father was an of
ficer in the military police during World War 11, and we
were assigned to various prisoner of war camps. Most
wives chose not to go, but my mother's conviction that a
wife's place was beside her husband took us along. We
crossed the country about 23 times, and we lived under
mosquito nets on army cots. The cast of characters was

35,000 prisoners of war from Germany, Italy and Japan."
Sherwood gained her own perspective on the prison
camps from her family's car. "The landscape was going
by so fast, the foreground was always blurred," she said.
This sense of the blurriness, the fungibility of the fore
ground and the ominous shapes on the horizon appear
in many of her displayed works.
Although no one else in her family pursued art,
Sherwood found it a welcome passion in the desert. She
ended up at the school run by the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts and has garnered many awards — including a
National Endowment for the Arts grant this year.
Sherwood did not choose pleasing, realistic images.
She said, "I have no enthusiasm for dainty florals — the
things that women are supposed to paint." Sherwood
feels that abstract art is undervalued. Its impact on the
imagination can be greater than that of realistic images.
By creating an abstract scene, the artist activates the
imagination of the viewer.
"Non-objective art should evoke in the viewer things
that the mind already knows. For instance, a beach or a
desert isn't meant to be one specific scene but should
call forth such a scene in the mind of the viewer. Color
works the same way."
Sherwood's work does indeed act on the mind in this
evocative fashion. Yet it can be rather unsettling. In "Far
Cordova," the mountains seem to loom dark in the dis
tance and in the sky beyond. But the road in front of the
viewer has broken down, and it looks scratched out and
seems to be almost melting away.
It is just this sort of eccentric coupling of evocation
and confusion, of the distance of represented spaces and
the texture of the painting's surface, that makes
Sherwood's work extraordinary.
Sherwood commented that the placement of art in
Stanford's hallways is excellent. "If work is out where
people are, people feel less intimidated." And people may
find inspiration if they take a few extra minutes when
strolling to class or to office hours to look at this exhibit.
Where else can you experience the combination of
romance, technology and unsettling landscapes that
make you think?

stylized couple holding hands.

Craig Schindler's work shows a different side of the
abstracted human form. Schindler is a digital artist who
makes his images using Macintosh computers. Schindler
constructs three-dimensional human forms which he
"composes into a spatial arrangement, wrapping colors,
patterns and textures around each object."
After adding what he calls "simulated lights," Schindler
adjusts the angle and depth, ending with a "photo-surre
alistic image." His goal is to "create a mythology for syn
thetic life, a mythology that is both sensual and mechan
ical, both realistic and surrealistic."
In his portion of the exhibit, computer-generated im
ages stand out as being particularly appropriate to their
viewing space in new, technology-centered buildings.
Some of the images, however, are difficult to see because
of printing and framing problems.
One picture, entitled "Couple," shows how different
Schindler's work is from Daniela's. A smoothed-out
man and a woman face each other; the male figure is
right side up while the female is upside down. The im
ages appear robotic and cold. This piece illustrates the
sense of alienation that these computer images generate
when viewed alongside the romantic curves of Daniela.
In some of his images, however, Schindler manages to
create an intriguing alternate world. The mix of geo
metrically straight lines and disruptive curves in
"Fractured Karma" shows the power of combining the
abstract with the figurative. In yellow and black, a
smooth figure makes lines all around him ripple like wa
ter as he rises through its surface.
While Schindler's work is the kind of computer-dri
ven graphic art that is becoming common on televi
sion and in film, Patricia Sherwood's paintings come
out of a tradition of abstract painting that emphasizes
the relationship among the artist and the materials of
paint and canvas.
Sherwood's textured surfaces show signs of being
worked and reworked. In her richly-colored work she
plays with the notion of the landscape by reconfiguring
it. As she lays out spaces of green and tan, the viewer
starts to trace a road that stretches into a cream-colored
sky. Instead, the scene is suddenly broken by other lines,
other possible interpretations.
Inspiration for Sherwood's art sprang from her own
childhood experiences with the physical landscape. "I
grew up in the wide open spaces in the desert country
of the U. 5.," she said.
"I spent my childhood in a car. My father was an of
ficer in the military police during World War 11, and we
were assigned to various prisoner of war camps. Most
wives chose not to go, but my mother's conviction that a
wife's place was beside her husband took us along. We
crossed the country about 23 times, and we lived under
mosquito nets on army cots. The cast of characters was

35,000 prisoners of war from Germany, Italy and Japan."
Sherwood gained her own perspective on the prison
camps from her family's car. "The landscape was going
by so fast, the foreground was always blurred," she said.
This sense of the blurriness, the fungibility of the fore
ground and the ominous shapes on the horizon appear
in many of her displayed works.
Although no one else in her family pursued art,
Sherwood found it a welcome passion in the desert. She
ended up at the school run by the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts and has garnered many awards — including a
National Endowment for the Arts grant this year.
Sherwood did not choose pleasing, realistic images.
She said, "I have no enthusiasm for dainty florals — the
things that women are supposed to paint." Sherwood
feels that abstract art is undervalued. Its impact on the
imagination can be greater than that of realistic images.
By creating an abstract scene, the artist activates the
imagination of the viewer.
"Non-objective art should evoke in the viewer things
that the mind already knows. For instance, a beach or a
desert isn't meant to be one specific scene but should
call forth such a scene in the mind of the viewer. Color
works the same way."
Sherwood's work does indeed act on the mind in this
evocative fashion. Yet it can be rather unsettling. In "Far
Cordova," the mountains seem to loom dark in the dis
tance and in the sky beyond. But the road in front of the
viewer has broken down, and it looks scratched out and
seems to be almost melting away.
It is just this sort of eccentric coupling of evocation
and confusion, of the distance of represented spaces and
the texture of the painting's surface, that makes
Sherwood's work extraordinary.
Sherwood commented that the placement of art in
Stanford's hallways is excellent. "If work is out where
people are, people feel less intimidated." And people may
find inspiration if they take a few extra minutes when
strolling to class or to office hours to look at this exhibit.
Where else can you experience the combination of
romance, technology and unsettling landscapes that
make you think?
