# Brass and Brahms
## World-renowned quintet to play at Memorial Church 
### Karin West Contributing writer 
This Friday, all that glitters in
Memorial Church won't be the fa
miliar gold mosaics. An interna
tionally hailed quintet will add a touch of
brass to the evening.
The Empire Brass Quintet is consid
ered to be North America's best. Energy,
skilled musical styling and a broad reper
toire characterize the award-winning
group. Its five musicians hold leading po
sitions with major American orchestras
and perform over 100 concerts a year
from Boston to Zurich.
The quintet's Stanford concert will
showcase the diversity of its repertoire.
The variety of pieces performed will ap
peal to audiences of many ages.
Classical works by the great com
posers Stravinsky, Schumann, Ravel,
Prokofiev, Mussorgsky, Mendelssohn,
Dvorak, Charpentier, Brahms and
Beethoven will be featured.
The group will also lend its unique
sound to Celtic-American folk music, se
lections from"The Sound of Music,"
Disney songs and American pop tunes.
The Empire Brass is the first brass en
semble to win the prestigious Naumberg
Chamber Music Award. The group teamed
up with the New York Philharmonic to
open Carnegie Hall's Centennial Gala and
was the first ensemble to play the hall after
its remodeling.
Audiences around the world enjoy the
group's charisma and creativity. European
performances are a regular part of the
quintet's touring schedule, and they have
performed with the Tonhalle Orchestra in
Zurich. The quintet has toured the Far East
13 times and has impressed standing-room
crowds and television audiences in Russia.
American television appearances have
ranged from "Good Morning, America"
and the "Today Show" to "Mr. Rogers'
Neighborhood."
When not touring, the group spends
time teaching up-and-coming young mu
sicians. The Empire Brass has served
Boston University as a Faculty Quintet-in-
Residence for 13 years and began an ap
pointment as Visiting Consultants in
Brass at London's Royal Academy of
Music in 1991. College students can also
study with the group through an annual
series of clinics.
Brass quartets consist of two trum
peters, a French horn player, a trombonist
and a tuba player. Although the five posi

tions in the Empire Brass have been filled
by different musicians over the years, the
group has maintained a steady reputation
for excellence.
Rolf Smedvig is the Empire Brass'
founder and first trumpet. Born in Seattle,
Smedvig made his solo debut with the
Seattle symphony at age 13. He later studied
at Boston University and at 19 became the
youngest member of the Boston Symphony.
Marc Reese also plays trumpet and is a
native of Long Island, N.Y. While attend
ing school at Juilliard, Reese won the Bay
Area Symphony, South Shore Symphony
and Atlantic Wind Symphony Concerto
competitions. Reese also received bache
lor's and master's degrees in music perfor
mance from Boston University.
Gregory Miller is the group's horn
player. He graduated from the Oberlin
Conservatory of Music, continued gradu
ate study at Boston University and re
cently became a professor at the Harid
Conservatory of Music. Miller played with
symphonies in Pittsburgh, Colorado and
Honolulu. He has also played in the New
World Symphony under Michael Tilson
Thomas (current director of the San
Francisco symphony). Miller recently per
formed for Prince Albert of Monaco and
President Clinton.
Mark Hetzler, from Sarasota, Fla., began
playing trombone at age 10. He, too, gradu
ated from Boston University and received
his master's degree from the New England
Conservatory. He has performed and
recorded with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra and with the Boston Pops. Hetzler
has performed as principle trombone with
the Florida and Jacksonville Symphonies. He
has also played under Michael Tilson
Thomas in the New World Symphony.
Kenneth Amis was born in Bermuda
and began playing tuba when he was "as
signed" to fill a needed spot in the high
school band. Like his fellow quartet per
formers, Amis studied at Boston
University, where he received a bachelor's
degree in Music Composition. He contin
ued graduate study in composition at the
New England Conservatory and is now an
active composer.
