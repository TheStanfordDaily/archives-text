# Touching the sun
## 'Icarus' is a play about outward appearance Stanford performing arts / theatre 
### James Pritchard Staff writer 
Edwin Sanchez attempts to reevalu
ate the age-old theme of discover
ing internal beauty with his play
"Icarus." The show is currently in its
world-premiere production at the San
Jos£ Repertory Theatre.
Although Sanchez's message is some
times unresolved and incomplete, the
play's characters present a nice vignette
of perspectives on ugliness and the
courage to move beyond it. Each arrives
on the scene — a quiet, deserted beach
front — bringing his or her own bag
gage. The contents slowly spill out on to
the sand as the play progresses.
The play's apparent heroine,
Altagracia, brings with her the knowledge
of her own ugliness. A birthmark covers
her forehead and temple — a blood-red
branch reaching out for her eyes.
She brings her wheelchair-bound
brother, Primitivo, who only pretends to
believe in the dream that he and his sis
ter have constructed. In this fantasy, he
is training to be the best swimmer in the
world. He wants to swim out to the
horizon and "touch the sun."
Tagging along with them is a janitor
from Primitivo's hospital, Mr. Ellis
(don't ask why he is with them — we
never do find out), who erratically alter
nates between philosophical diatribes
on finding your dreams and repeated
mad mumblings of "I'm not staring. I'm
not staring! Am I staring? Oh my God,
I'm staring!"
The single "beauty" of the cast, or so
we are made to think, is the washed-up
Hollywood actress who calls herself
"The Gloria." She drunkenly waltzes
about her porch, waiting for the phone
call to invite her to the next big
Hollywood affair. She has been waiting
for a long time.
Finally there is the aptly-named Beau,
who arrives on the scene with his face
covered in a mask, supposedly intended
to cover scars from a car accident.

The actual logistics of the plot are de
cidedly secondary to these characters.
We first learn that Altagracia has stolen
Primitivo from his hospital to bring him
to the beach. The audience is kept in the
dark as to why a handicapped man had
been committed to a hospital.
Another question is why the siblings
choose to break into a summer beach

house to live in. And why does Beau wear
a mask? Once he eventually demasks, his
original intention for hiding his face be
comes unclear, and the play never an
swers why he had his face covered, other
than for thematic convenience.
But perhaps Sanchez is glossing over
these details for a reason. The five are
struggling in their own way to find some
sort of comfort and meaning in their
lives. The backdrop for these struggles is
certainly not Sanchez' focus.
Beyond the holes in the story, the five
above are entertaining. Is bringing to
gether five lonely and unloved charac
ters a chance for maudlin sentimental
ity? No, of course not. It is a chance for
comedy, as each character's quirks and
irregularities feed off the others.
The play is consistent and never
strays from its message. Mr. Ellis repeat
edly asks, "Am I staring?" as Altagracia
gives an emotional monologue about
receiving stares in high school.
Primitivo speaks of his dream of swim
ming out to touch the sun as Mr. Ellis
reflects on the pain of his unfulfilled
dreams and haunting past.
In the end, however, Sanchez leaves
us feeling unsure of what to think. Like
Icarus, Primitivo tries to touch the sun
and fails. But while the mythical Icarus
was foolishly trying to ignore his mor
tality, are we to feel that Primitivo's at
tempt was just as futile? Like Icarus, has
he been penalized for reaching too high?
The Icarus analogy may be deceiving,
because Sanchez' play implies some
thing quite different. "Icarus" is about
recognizing your faults and learning to
move beyond them. Sanchez' hopeful
message seems to tell us that we can.
