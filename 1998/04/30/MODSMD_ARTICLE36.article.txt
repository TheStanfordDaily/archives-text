# movie review and interview
## 'TwentyFour-Seven' 
### 
The first thing that hit me about "TwentyFourSeven"
was the starkness of the black-and-white film and
the bareness of the sets. That combined with the
film's slow pace and simple plot make the first half of the
film feel very long.
At the center of "TwentyFourSeven" is Bob Hoskins as
Darcy, a middle-aged man from a relatively rural area in
England. Although he's not an obvious leader, Darcy
finds the motivation to open a boxing club for the local
youth. It is his impression that this club, like the one he
had as a teen, will restore camaraderie and pride to the
troubled lads in the area.
With its simple no-budget look, the film seems to have
little going for it on first glance. The documentary-type
camera movements, intermittent jump cuts and peculiar
shooting angles contribute to creating the impression
that first-time feature film director Shane Meadows is not
quite ready for such a large-scale project.
Around the middle of the film, however, we begin to
see what Meadows is trying to show us. His film is not an
epic. It is a character study of a small town and how one
man in that town tries to deal with its problems.
With little plot to concern him, Meadows prefers to
dwell on character development and how the relation
ships between Darcy and the lads develop. The lack of
production values, slow pacing and leisurely plot allow
Meadows to dwell exclusively on these relationships with
out distracting the audience.
Ironically, the film's major flaw may be that it spends
too much time chronicling the rise and fall of Darcy and
not enough time letting us get to know the other charac
ters. The plot is inconsequential.
The movie paints a scene of a society and a people we
have never met. Its power comes from the fact that we feel
intimately familiar with them by the end.
"TwentyFourSeven" is a strong character picture and
could not have succeeded without an excellent performance
by Hoskins, in his most complex role yet. There is also a
strong supporting cast led by Danny Nussbaum as Tim.
Meadows substitutes passion and energy for his lack of
experience in making this film. In the end, he gives us a
telling view of his own youth.
