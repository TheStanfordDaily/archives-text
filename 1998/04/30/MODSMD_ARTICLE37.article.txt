# Boxing into the spotlight: Director Shane Meadows
## 
### Brad Null Contributing writer 
Shane Meadows, first-time feature
director of the independent film
"TwentyFourSeven," grew up in the
Midlands in England. He had already
produced 33 short films when he tack
led "TwentyFourSeven" at the age of
24. Intermission spoke with Meadows
about how he became a filmmaker
and his experiences with the produc
tion of "TwentyFourSeven."
Intermission: Why did you
decide to make this film your first
feature?
Shane Meadows: I suppose that
decision was made for me. The pro
ducer who approached me after see
ing some of my short films was ask
ing me about short film ideas. I gave
the idea about this guy who was run
ning this club for some young kids. I
spoke about how it was a study in
loneliness, a celebration of a commu
nity and a celebration of a man who
was a bit of a visionary for his own
town. It was really in the rise and fall
of this boxing club where he loses
himself. And I was talking about all of
this stuff, and Stephen Woolley (the
producer) said, "That's not reallv a
short film. It'd be impossible to tell it
in a short film. Maybe we should con
sider it as a feature." I had not really
considered making a feature film, but
I took his word for it.
I: So you never envisioned it as a
feature film?
SM: It was just an idea floating
around in my head, based on
something that had happened in
my past. But I didn't just think of it
as a feature film. I didn't think of
myself as a filmmaker really. I was
making short films, enjoying what
I was doing, working with a group
of unknown actors off the street.
None of them were trained actors.
The producer saw something spe
cial in that, and he thought it
wouldn't be a problem for me to
translate that whole working
process into a feature film.

I: What else were you doing at the
time if you didn't consider yourself a
filmmaker?
SM: 1 was just unemployed. But I
was enjoying making the films, and I
was showing them around. I didn't
really have an education. 1 had never
been successful at anything. But a lot
of the time, you're more negative
about your own work. At the time a
lot of people in my local area were
saying, "We think these films are
great." But these were my friends.
They're bound to say that. And then
when people further afield started
saying there was something special
about the films, 1 began to think to
myself, "Man, this is probably the
only thing in my life that I've had
any success at, that people have
taken me seriously for." So by the
time 1 got to the set of
"TwentyFourSeven," I knew what I
wanted to do, and I knew that I'd
probably never be able to do any
thing else.
I: When you started work on
"TwentyFourSeven," did you feel you
were ready for the project?
SM: I think it's impossible [to
feel ready]. You go into anything
that's far bigger than anything
you've ever done in your whole life
before, and it's going to be scary. So
I was really scared about going onto
the film set, because there were 50 or
60 people working for me. And I'm
the kid who always used to get in
trouble at school. I was told I would
never make anything of myself. And
you have to overcome all the nega
tivity that you experience as a child
and say, "I'm worth this. I can do
this. This idea is important." Bob
Hoskins was in a vulnerable posi
tion, because these kids were real â€”
some of them were on drug charges.
They were going to go to prison, and
this film to them was like a savior.
It's a hard time for everybody, and
when you get a lot of people who are
quite vulnerable, it means that they
all need each other just as much as
you need them. So we all began to
help each other.

I: Do you feel like you made any
mistakes?
SM: No, not really. It's about ac
cepting anything as [a part of] the
time it's in. I don't think I could have
made it any better. Everyone's made
mistakes; there isn't a perfect film in
existence. But it's how you feel at the
end of it that's important.
I: How much of the story was au
tobiographical?
SM: I was in a boxing club as a
kid. I wanted to be a boxer when 1
was a lad, and they closed the club
down where I was living. We all spilt
out on the streets, and there was
nothing for us to do. We used to
shoplift, and we were starting to get
in trouble. And this guy came to us
and started to set up a football team.
I think that really inspired us. We
never even won a match, but the fact
that he brought us together and the
fact that he stood by us is the heart
of the story. I felt very passionately
about telling this story, and the fact
that it was about a 55-year-old man
makes it quite different from a lot of
the British youth movies out there.
I: Why did you want Bob
Hoskins?
SM: I couldn't imagine anyone
else. 1 was writing the script, and I
was talking to the co-writer Paul
Fraser. It turned out we were both
writing the scenes for Bob Hoskins.
So it wasn't a case of, "I thought I'll
get Bob because it will help because
he's famous." I think it was just a case
that we couldn't imagine anyone else
forming that part. We approached
him, and he agreed to doing it very
simply. Almost as soon as he had
read the script, he agreed to do it for
next to nothing.
I: Were you surprised when he
accepted?
SM: Yeah, I was blown away. I
went down to see him, and he agreed
to do it as long as I sat and had a
drink of wine with him. Three hours
later, I was on the train very drunk,
thinking, "I've just been down to
London to try and get Bob Hoskins
on my film, and now that he's on my
film, I'm very drunk and I don't
know what's going on." I just went
back home and told everyone and
my family. And that's been the great
thing about this; if I didn't have my
family, there would be no one to
share it with. It would just all be in
side me. And because I'm not from a
film or artistic background, it's re
freshing to everybody that I know.
I: Do you feel lucky as a film
maker?
SM: Oh, yes. I've been around
enough to see that there are plenty ot
filmmakers who would die to even
make one film. I feel very lucky.
