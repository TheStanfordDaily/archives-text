# Public with a capital
## movie interview 
### Nkomo Morris Editorial Staff 
Producer Steve Tisch, sponsored by the
Stanford Entertainment and Sports Law
Association, spoke at the Law school yester
day about careers in the entertainment in
dustry. Sporting a bright smile, plenty of
jokes and well-worn brown loafers, Tisch
charmed the audience. He skillfully de
flected requests for employment and an
swered every question honesdy.
The questions seemed to address every
possible subject in the arena of entertain
ment, but what Tisch didn't discuss was
how to deal with failure once you do
"make it."
After his $80 million epic film "The
Postman" bombed in theaters last
Christmas, Tisch had to admit that "the
public gets the final vote."
Unlike another of Tisch's movies, the
Academy Award-winning "Forrest Gump,"
"The Postman" fell from the top 20 only
three weeks after its Christmas release.
"['The Postman'], which Warner
Brothers spent tens of millions on in mar
keting, was a financial flop. The day it
opened, no one showed up. 1 think the
public knew that it was a film they didn't
want to see. Regardless of the [produc
tion] budget and the budget of the mar
keting campaign, they knew it just wasn't
for them."
Tisch has learned many lessons from
his work, but he said that his most impor
tant lesson was that you never know it all.
Kevin Costner, director and star of "The
Postman," refused to listen when advised
to cut scenes. Tisch learned from
Costner's mistake.
Director James Cameron ignored al

most every piece of advice he was given
when making "Titanic." The $200 million
movie opened five months after it was
supposed to.
Yet "Titanic" turned into the highest
grossing movie in history. According to
Tisch, the simple plotline helped a great
deal. It was a movie about normal people
doing normal things like falling in love.
Perhaps that's why "Forrest Gump" did so
well â€” it was a story about an ordinary
man in extraordinary circumstances.
It would seem that Hollywood is just
like a box of chocolates. You never know
what you're going to get.
Unlike Gump, Steve Tisch is no ordi
nary man. By age 23, he was already waist
deep in the entertainment industry to a
degree that many middle-aged producers
never accomplish.
Tisch attended Tufts University in
Medford, Mass. Using his family connec
tions (his uncle is chairman and CEO of
the board for CBS, Inc.), Tisch networked
to find his dream job. During school
breaks, Tisch worked for director John
Avildsen ("Lean on Me") and producer
Fred Weintraub ("Force: Five"). His first
job after graduation was as executive assis
tant to then-head of Columbia Pictures,
Peter Gruber. Two years later, Tisch served
as associate producer for the 1975 televi
sion movie "The Missing Are Deadly."
About a decade after that, Tisch had
enough knowledge and wherewithal to
co-found a production company, Tisch /
Avnet Productions. He had befriended
Jon Avnet while producing his first feature
film, "Outlaw Blues." Among other pro
jects, Tisch / Avnet created the 1983 hit
"Risky Business," launching a young Tom
Cruise's acting career.

Described as "enabling viewers to actually
see what it is to be young, instead of what a
middle-aged producer thinks will sell tick
ets," "Risky Business" was arguably the first
realistic cinematic portrayal of teens.
A television movie he did in 1984, "The
Burning Bed," was the first portrayal of
domestic violence on network television.
"The Burning Bed" went on to be the sec
ond most-watched television movie ever.
Digitally-created falling feathers.
Graphic portrayals of domestic violence.
Authentic teen characters. It would seem
that breakthroughs are what a viewing
audience wants to see, and what Tisch
tries to create. Tisch knows because he is
the public.
"Before I decide what movie I will
produce," Tisch said,"l ask myself,'ls this
a movie I want to see?' I try to go to the
movies two or three times every week. It
takes me back to being a kid growing up
in New York, when I would see some-

times two or three movies a
day. It's a great way to grow up.
It's a way of running away
from reality."
But the movie-making indus
try hardly seems a way to run
away from reality. It's one of the
most businesslike areas that a
person can get into. And as we
all know, the business world is
firmly planted in reality.
Tisch doesn't deal with
Hollywood's studio system. As
president of his own production
company, The Steve Tisch
Company, Tisch stays as far
away from that system as he can.
"I think the studio system is
very much like it was in the '505,"

Tisch said, "but there are more
and more films being made outside of it.
Filmmakers and actors find it much more
rewarding if they have an opportunity to
work outside the system, which is very fear
driven. It works counterproductively to
what creative people are trying to do."
Tisch bunks the system in many ways.
He reads unsolicited manuscripts. He's al
ways looking for new talent. He depicts
stories that others don't want shown, like
his "American History of X," a film about
race hatred slated to premiere in October.
His advice to young would-be produc
ers: If you have heart, you can do whatever
you want. It doesn't matter what your par
ents or critics say. Talent is what will get
you there. Thick skin, an ability to learn
from your mistakes and a willingness to
not take yourself too seriously is what will
keep you there.
"Ultimately," Tisch said, "We're all just
Willie Lomans with big paychecks."
