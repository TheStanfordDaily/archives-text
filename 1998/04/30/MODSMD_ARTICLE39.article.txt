The festivities of the 41st San Francisco
International Film Festival kicked off on
April 23 with both a gala opening night
party and the North American premiere of
"Wilde," a candid portrait of playwright
Oscar Wilde.
The festival, which runs until May 7,
features films of various calibers and bud
gets from around the world. Some of the

sic like John Cage, as well as underground
legends like Can's Holger Czukay and con
temporary names like Moby and Brian Eno.
"Modulations" also focuses on and ex
amines the unknowns behind electronica
— the kids behind the turntables, the dis
illusioned club kids, the "generation of
British youth who transformed these blips
and bleeps into dance floor anthems of
their own alienation." In so doing, Lee
pieces together an interesting study both
in music and in a movement.

young woman who is "making her way
through the men of Paris." She is choosing
between her two recent conquests and
fending off her sister's insistence on the
virtues of monogamy when the "perfect
guy" steps into her life. It is love at first
sight with Olivier (Mathieu Demy).
But Olivier has a secret to hide, as do all
men in the kind of movie where it's half an
upbeat comedy and half a depressing
drama. The message in "Jeanne and the
Perfect Guy" — sometimes the perfect
guy is dying of AIDS.
At first, Jeanne dismisses Olivier's con
dition as a "minor inconvenience," be
cause she loves Olivier and takes the opti
mistic view that his condition will
improve. But it doesn't.
What follows is not what you'd expect,
nor is it the sort of "easy resolution" that
many filmmakers would take. It's a pretty
heartbreaking, difficult ending for a
movie that is mostly a playful, optimistic
"musical" that just happens to have a not
so-optimisic subject.
"Edge City"
Without a doubt, Eugene Martin's
American film "Edge City" is one of the
best and most disturbing entries to be
shown at the festival this year. It's a story
told from the point of view of teenagers,
but in a way that is surprisingly unique.

formances that are natural and completely
real. What we get are three story lines in
volving three sets of kids — from the
wrong side of the tracks, from the right
side and from somewhere in between.
The irony is, of course, that no matter
which side of the tracks these kids come
from, they're all going the same way. All
are devoid of responsibility and direction
and sometimes end up making up their
own values as they go along. They are all
the kids next door, and they are all in
volved in sex, violence, drug abuse, loud
parties and reckless driving. The only dif
ference between them are the kinds of cars
they're driving.
At some point, these worlds have to
collide (or else Martin wouldn't have a
film). When they do, the consequences
are unsurprisingly tragic and yet surpris
ingly unexpected and unnerving. "Edge
City" is a truly powerful film: less shock
ing than "Kids" in its exposure of the
"fallen" kids of the '90s, but perhaps more
so in revealing that these "fallen" kids are
no longer a minority.
These films are but a handful of the cut
ting-edge entries in this year's festival. The
closing ceremonies of the festival will be
marked by the screening of highly-ac
claimed director Wayne Wang's new film,
"Chinese Box." "Chinese Box" is a docu
