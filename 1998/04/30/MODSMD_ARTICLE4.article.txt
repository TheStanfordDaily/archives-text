# Mixed picture for Greek housing
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
Spring has sprung, and if you're in
volved in the Greek system, that
means more is changing than just the
weather.
Surrounding the recently com
pleted Rush season have been a spate
of housing changes and other inci
dents. Most fraternities and sororities
report that Rush this year went as
well or better than expected. I iowev
er, a fight between two pledges at a
Phi Delta Theta Rush event is under
investigation by the Greek Judicial
Board.
This investigation comes on the
heels of several housing changes, in
which one fraternity, Theta Xi. lost its
house and two sororities — Delta
Delta Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta
received housing. Two fraternities
Kappa Alpha and Delta Kappa
Epsilon — also got their houses back
after having lost them in recent years.
I lousing rules also changed this year
to include the "100-percent rule,"
which means that any housed chapter
must have a large enough member
ship to completely fill its house.
Rush Pluses
An element more central to
Greek life than housing or even par
tying is perpetuation of membership.
Thus, the cornerstone event of the
year for most fraternities and sorori
ties is Rush.
Rush was especially crucial this
year due to changes in housing.
" This was a year that a lot of chap
ters needed people." said Heather
Dunn, assistant director of student
activities. "Organizations were reallv

looking for bodies."
With the exception of the Taxis,
all housed fraternities and sororities
were able to recruit enough members
to fill their houses.
"We have 34 people in our pledge
class, which we're very happy with."
said Theta President Sarah McDon
ald.
"We have 10 pledges, maybe a
couple more latecomers, which is a
good number for us." said Deke Vice
President Rob Moore.
Many sororities and fraternities
who have yet to release their final
pledge numbers, including Tri-Delt
and Delta Gamma, also report them
selves very happy with the Rush re
sults.

"We haven't made a public state
ment about our pledge numbers, but
we're very happy with our pledge
class." said Robin Tenold. president
of Tri-Delt
Rush Minuses
For all the optimistic reports
about high Rush numbers, this year's
events haven't run their course en
tirely smoothly. All Rush events are
officially alcohol-free, and the frater
nities insist that this is the case in prac
tice as well as in theory. Reports
abound to the contrary, however.
The (ireek Judicial Board is cur
rently investigating an incident that
reportedly occurred on a Phi Delt re
treat. According to sources close to

the incident, two freshman pledges
were involved in a serious altercation
on the fraternity's Rush weekend
trip. The incident and the trip both in
volved alcohol. All Phi Delt chapters
are scheduled to be completely dry
by the year 2(M).
Nanci Howe, director of student
activities and a member of the board,
confirmed that an investigation was
taking place but refused to comment
112 urther. "This is not a public process,"
she said.
Howe added that proceedings of
the Greek Judicial Hoard usually
take from two to four weeks. Then,
the board makes a recommendation
to Dean of Students Marc Wais.
Fraternity Revival?
Many of Stanford's unhoused fra
ternities have found themselves in a
battle of arithmetic in recent years,
fighting declining membership num
bers. Most successful in beating this
trend, however, have been the KAs.
who were a dying fraternity just a
year ago. After losing their house,
their membership continued to dwin
dle.
In last year's Rush, the KAs expe
rienced a surge with M) nev\ mem
bers. Combined with this year's
pledge class, their membership is n*>w
large enough for them to get their
house back.
"We got 34 pledges for next year.
32 of whom will live in the house."
said KA President Bob Baird. "Our
house is actually over full."
The KAs could be a model for
other fraternities whose member
ships are in sharp decline, including

Zeta Psi and Taxi.
Psi, an unhoused fraternity,
was doing well as recently as last year.
' f'We pushed for a house last year,
iiffci when we didn't get it we kind of
fdl, apart," said Zeta Psi President
\laj"k Johnson. "A lot of the guys
quit, and we were left with about six
members.
"1 became president, vice presi
dent, historian, secretary, treasurer,
pretty much everything all at once."
Johnson is spearheading the effort
to recruit new members. Zeta Psi is
conducting Rush on its own, outside
of traditional fraternity Rush proce
dures. Thus far, the results have been
positive.
•* u We were looking for a core
gfoup of about a dozen guys, and it
looks like we'll have somewhere be
tween one and two dozen," Johnson

said.
He added that he hopes to get the
chapter large enough to return to a
house in two years. Pledge problems
also had a lot to do with the Taxis los
ing their house, after six of 18 pledges
this year withdrew their pledges.
New Rules
If the Taxis or the Zeta Psis hope
to regain houses, they will have to do
so under a new set of rules.
Gone is the "grandfather clause,"
which allowed fraternities that lost
their houses to regain them simply by
fulfilling certain conditions, such as
increased membership. It was under
this system that the KAs and the
Dekes regained their houses for next
year. After this year, however,
groups that lose their house must
reapply like any other group.
"The grandfather clause kept cer
tain groups housed and other groups
unhoused, and we wanted to give a
chance for other organizations, in

eluding sororities, to get housing,"
Dunn said.
Another change in the housing
system is the "100-percent rule,"
whieh says that, after the completion
of Rush, a housed chapter must have
enough members to completely fill its
house. This replaces the "90-percent
rule," under which 90-percent of the
residents in a fraternity house are re
quired to belong to a fraternity.
According to Dunn, this new rule
is meant both to ensure that organi
zations that are housed are large
enough to fill their houses and to dis
courage them from taking in board
ers. "We caution people against
boarders because it causes problems
between those residents who are fra
ternity members and those who are
not," Dunn said.
Howe credits the new policy for
encouraging more organizations to
apply for housing.
"This new policy provides a real
opportunity for any group to apply

for a house," Howe said.
For next year, housed chapters
had the choice of following either the
100-percent rule or the 90-percent
rule. Some groups object to the 1(X)-
percent rule because it will cause
them to overbid for members every
year.
"We're going to have to get at
least 1 (K) percent for next year's
Rush, and what will probably end up
happening is that some seniors won't
be able to live in the house," Moore
said of the Dekes.
This rule will make Rush more
pressure-filled, Baird said.
"Basically, we're going to have to
overshoot every year for Rush. We
used to have about a five-person win
dow in the house, but now we'll have
to keep it full all the time."
No Vacancy
Despite the changes in housing
policy, fraternities and sororities are,
for the most part, very enthusiastic

about housing, and the newly housed
sororities will both fill their houses
next year.
"When we first found out the size
of the house that we were given, we
were a little upset," said McDonald,
the Theta president. "But now we see
that our numbers will be fine."
The Cowell Cluster houses as
signed to the sororities each hold 54
people. "We'll have no trouble filling
our house," Tenold said.
Other than Taxi, all housed frater
nities will also be able to keep their
houses next year. In order to accom
plish this, several fraternities had to
engage in "post-Rush Rushing," to
find enough members to fill their
houses.
"After the formal process, there is
an ongoing process of recruitment
that often occurs," Dunn said.
The granting of houses to the two
fraternities and two sororities for
next year seems to have maintained
interest in housing within a number

of unhoused chapters. Tempering
this optimism is a concern over the
fate of Taxi "We feel bad for the
Taxis, but there's nothing the Univer
sity could do otherwise," said Delta
Gamma President Kallee Magnani.
Moore added that when a frater
nity is in trouble, the rest of the Greek
community must be on their guard.
"It's not good for any of us when
any fraternity loses its house," he
said. Baird admitted, however, that it
would have been difficult for the Uni
versity to make an exception for Taxi.
" They set up the rules and for them to
bend them either way wouldn't be
right," he said.
Howe added that although the
Taxis lost their house, they are still in
good standing with the University.
"Taxi's a great group; they just
haven't been able to attract enough
members," she said. "They also had
the smallest house on campus, so it's
not like we could have given them a
smaller house."
