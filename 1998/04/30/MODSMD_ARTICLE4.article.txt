# Mixed picture for Greek housing
## 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
Spring has sprung, and if you're in
volved in the Greek system, that
means more is changing than just the
weather.
Surrounding the recently com
pleted Rush season have been a spate
of housing changes and other inci
dents. Most fraternities and sororities
report that Rush this year went as
well or better than expected. I iowev
er, a fight between two pledges at a
Phi Delta Theta Rush event is under
investigation by the Greek Judicial
Board.
This investigation comes on the
heels of several housing changes, in
which one fraternity, Theta Xi. lost its
house and two sororities — Delta
Delta Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta
received housing. Two fraternities
Kappa Alpha and Delta Kappa
Epsilon — also got their houses back
after having lost them in recent years.
I lousing rules also changed this year
to include the "100-percent rule,"
which means that any housed chapter
must have a large enough member
ship to completely fill its house.
Rush Pluses
An element more central to
Greek life than housing or even par
tying is perpetuation of membership.
Thus, the cornerstone event of the
year for most fraternities and sorori
ties is Rush.
Rush was especially crucial this
year due to changes in housing.
" This was a year that a lot of chap
ters needed people." said Heather
Dunn, assistant director of student
activities. "Organizations were reallv

looking for bodies."
With the exception of the Taxis,
all housed fraternities and sororities
were able to recruit enough members
to fill their houses.
"We have 34 people in our pledge
class, which we're very happy with."
said Theta President Sarah McDon
ald.
"We have 10 pledges, maybe a
couple more latecomers, which is a
good number for us." said Deke Vice
President Rob Moore.
Many sororities and fraternities
who have yet to release their final
pledge numbers, including Tri-Delt
and Delta Gamma, also report them
selves very happy with the Rush re
sults.

"We haven't made a public state
ment about our pledge numbers, but
we're very happy with our pledge
class." said Robin Tenold. president
of Tri-Delt
Rush Minuses
For all the optimistic reports
about high Rush numbers, this year's
events haven't run their course en
tirely smoothly. All Rush events are
officially alcohol-free, and the frater
nities insist that this is the case in prac
tice as well as in theory. Reports
abound to the contrary, however.
The (ireek Judicial Board is cur
rently investigating an incident that
reportedly occurred on a Phi Delt re
treat. According to sources close to

the incident, two freshman pledges
were involved in a serious altercation
on the fraternity's Rush weekend
trip. The incident and the trip both in
volved alcohol. All Phi Delt chapters
are scheduled to be completely dry
by the year 2(M).
Nanci Howe, director of student
activities and a member of the board,
confirmed that an investigation was
taking place but refused to comment
112 urther. "This is not a public process,"
she said.
Howe added that proceedings of
the Greek Judicial Hoard usually
take from two to four weeks. Then,
the board makes a recommendation
to Dean of Students Marc Wais.
Fraternity Revival?
Many of Stanford's unhoused fra
ternities have found themselves in a
battle of arithmetic in recent years,
fighting declining membership num
bers. Most successful in beating this
trend, however, have been the KAs.
who were a dying fraternity just a
year ago. After losing their house,
their membership continued to dwin
dle.
In last year's Rush, the KAs expe
rienced a surge with M) nev\ mem
bers. Combined with this year's
pledge class, their membership is n*>w
large enough for them to get their
house back.
"We got 34 pledges for next year.
32 of whom will live in the house."
said KA President Bob Baird. "Our
house is actually over full."
The KAs could be a model for
other fraternities whose member
ships are in sharp decline, including
