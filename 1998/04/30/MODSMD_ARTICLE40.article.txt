# Independents days
## The 						41st San Francisco International Film Festival 
### 
more well-known films to be featured this
year are Italy's "The Acrobats," France's
"Marius and Jeanette" and the American
entry "The Opposite of Sex." Another pop
ular feature is the documentary "Barbie
Nation: An Unauthorized Tour," whose
press material calls the film "a witty and
thought-provoking portrait of America's
plastic sweetheart."
The festival also presents awards and
tributes throughout its run, the most no
table of which may be the presentation of
the Peter J. Owens award to actor Nicholas
Cage. The award, which was given to
Annette Bening last year, was presented to
Cage during a program of clips from his
films and an onstage interview on April
26. Other awards include the Akira
Kurosawa award for lifetime achievement
in film directing and the Golden Gate
awards for the best in filmmaking and
television. Both of those awards are de
cided by the festival-goers.
Some of the highlights and recommen
dations from the festival include:
"Modulations"
This is an American documentary di
rected by lara Lee. Referred to by the
filmmakers as "cinema for the ear," the
documentary traces the merging of tech
nology and sound into what we now con
sider to be "electronic music."
Filmed with cutting-edge graphics and
fueled by the pulsating electronica itself,
"Modulations" celebrates what it no doubt
considers to be one of the greatest artistic
innovations of the 20th century. Lee sam

"l Went Down"
Paddy Breathnach's Irish entry is an un
predictable black comedy in the vein of
"The Big Lebowski" and other such recent
releases. "I Went Down" tells the tale of re
cently-released ex-con Git (Peter
McDonald), who gets out of jail to find his
girlfriend shacking up with his best friend.
This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for
the fact that Git also owes a "favor" to a
Dublin gangster (Tony Doyle). He can
only repay this favor with the help of
Bunny Kelly (Brendan Gleeson), an or
ange-haired psycho who once killed his
own grandfather. So let's just say that
things aren't going so well for old Git.
Although his only mission is to kidnap
the world's most talkative hostage, Frank
Grogan (Peter Caffrey), the borderline
psychotic Bunny can't help but commit
crime after pointless crime along the way,
only adding to the troubles of poor Git.
Of course, Bunny isn't totally evil, so the
two men form something of a friendship
while struggling to survive in the dog-eat
dog Dublin underworld. Their alliance
faces the ultimate test in the film's crazy,
bullet-ridden climax.
While odd and confusing at times, "I
Went Down" is a funny, irreverent film
that can hold its own against similar re
cent releases (and has the added bonus of
Irish accents).
"Jeanne and the Perfect Guy"
Directed by Olivier Ducastel and
Jacques Martineau and entered by France,
"Jeanne and the Perfect Guy" tells the
story of Jeanne (Virginie Ledoyen), a care
free, beautiful, sexually adventurous

Filmed with a hand-held camera, "Edge
City" has the gritty feel of a hastily put to
gether documentary. The kids all give per

mentary-style film starring Jeremy Irons
and Gong Li and details the final days of
British rule in Hong Kong.
