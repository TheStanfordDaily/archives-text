# Hang gliding:
## Not quite gliding, but enjoying the ride hang gliding 
### Benjamin Allen 
Leaping from the edge of a thousand-foot cliff, I
soared high above cities, farms and oceans, touching
the clouds and becoming one with the eagles gliding
beside me.
That is what did not happen during my first hang
gliding lesson last Saturday.
Instead, I experienced the difficulty of hauling large
gliders up a steep hill, the soft squish of fresh cow pies
underfoot and after finally skimming down the slope a
few feet above the ground, the exhilarating rush of my
body being dragged across the rugged terrain in classic
crash-landing form.
Taken separately, most of these things call misery
and the complete absence of fun to mind. But when
the lesson was complete and the day was done, this
combination of outdoor adventure and a little hard
work turned out to be a recipe for great times and ex
citement — I was left craving more.
Hang gliding lessons are given locally through
Mission Soaring Center, which is based in Milpitas,
Calif. The center, which celebrates its 25th anniver
sary this month, has been around since hang gliding
was first invented. At that time, gliders were con
structed from sheets of plastic and bamboo. Today,
gliders require precise specifications and are often
designed by NASA engineers.
Mission is using the newest technology to help
teach beginning hang gliding students the ins and outs
of glider maneuverability. My lesson began when I
strapped into the harness of Mission's virtual reality
flight simulator and donned the stereoscopic goggles.
The flight simulator is just about as close as you can
get to hang gliding without leaving the ground. The
simulator consists of a real hang glider and harness
that is suspended a few feet above the floor. The
glider's motions are directed by moving the control
bar, which is the base of the metal triangle which
hangs below the wing.
The simulation is actually little more than a
souped-up version of Nintendo's Pilot Wings video
game, but the flight is surprisingly real, and the game
responds to your motion exactly as a glider would in
flight conditions. In the simulator, I flew high over the
ocean beaches, dove down toward the water and

looked for wispy thermals (pockets of rising hot air) to
catch a lift back up. The simulation continues until
you either land safely or crash into the myriad obsta
cles which litter the landscape (I personally recom
mend attempting a water landing).
The meat of the actual flying lesson took place just
past Hollister, which is about an hour and a half south
of campus. The training grounds double as pasture
lands for about 200 head of cattle — hence the cow
pies. There is what seems to be a constant rain of sky
divers landing just beyond the flight path.
The hands-on part of the lesson started when Pam,
the beginners' instructor, demonstrated how to put a
hang glider together. When not in use, gliders are
broken down and packed into canvas bags about 20
feet long and a foot in diameter. Rebuilding the glider
takes an expert about 15 minutes, but it takes several
bumbling novices a little less than 45 minutes to
complete the task.
Before we could fly the gliders, we had to learn a few
basic skills and procedures that are necessary for
proper flight. These included the pre-flight check, in
which every piece of the glider is inspected, and han
dling drills, where we learned how to manage the
glider in varying wind conditions.
The last thing I had to learn before I could fly was
how to take off. In order for a glider to get off the
ground, the wing needs air flowing at 15 to 20 mph.
That means your running speed plus the speed of the
wind must add up to 15 to 20 mph. The tricky part is
perfecting the run which, in action, looks like a com
bination of gazelle-like strides and professional race
walking. Your head must stay level while you take
bounding steps and try to gain speed.
By the time 1 had mastered these skills, I was getting
restless. 1 had spent two hours looking at gliders and
bounding around a cow pasture when what 1 really
wanted to do was fly.
My wish was finally granted when Pam told me to
march the glider to the top of the 50-foot training hill
and prepare for my first flight. I was nervous, but I
hauled the glider as far up the hill as Pam would allow
and hooked my harness to its frame. 1 stood up and
lifted the glider until I felt a tug on my harness.

"Hooked in!" I yelled to Pam, who was watching
from the bottom of the hill.
1 rested the glider on my shoulders and pointed the
nose directly into the oncoming wind, balancing the
glider as best as 1 could.
"Balanced!" I hollered, indicating that I was ready
to fly.
I looked side to side, making sure that my wingtips
were clear of my fellow gliders.
"Clear!" I called, and Pam gave me the thumbs up.
Swallowing the small lump in my throat, I began to
run. I gained speed quickly and felt an upward tug on
my harness. I kept running, but soon my legs were no
longer touching the ground. I was flying! I laughed as
I tilted the nose upwards to gain altitude.
"Okay, come down now!" called Pam after a few sec
onds. But 1 wasn't paying attention to Pam. I was fly
ing. I was only 20 feet off the ground, but I was flying.
I looked down at creation and noted that it was good.
Then disaster struck. While I was looking down, the
nose of the glider dipped and I gained speed. I lost al
titude rapidly. I saw the ground moving quickly below
me, and just before I touched down, I pedaled my legs
as fast as I could to catch up with it.
Unfortunately, my efforts were in vain. When I
touched down, my legs flew out from under me and I
was dragged through the weeds on my belly. I wound up
with a mouthful of grass and some banged up ribs, but
1 couldn't wait to drag the glider up the hill to try again.
And so went the remainder of the day. I didn't log
too many minutes of flight time, but I did get seven
more crash landings under my belt. Pam let us fly un
til the sun set, when we put away the gliders and dis
cussed the day's successes and the things we wanted
to improve upon.
I left the Hollister training grounds a little dirty, a
little tired, but very satisfied with my experience. I was
even asking when I could possibly come back for
more. I was invited to return for ground school, which
teaches fundamental flight theory, but this sounded a
little too much like school.
So would I recommend taking the first lesson and
finding out if flying a glider takes you to never before
experienced heights? Definitely, especially since
Mission Soaring Center is offering a discount on the
introductory lesson for Stanford students until May
15. At $85, the lesson is still a little pricey but better
than the normal $120 rate.
By the end of your lesson, which lasts between four
and five hours, you will have flown. Believe me, I saw
some of the world's least coordinated individuals
leave the ground before the day was over. The Center
developed the teaching techniques that are now used
nationwide for hang gliding instruction, and the
techniques work.
If you are afraid that just one glider ride will start an
addiction which will only be satiated by more and
more flight time, you are right on. One time will cer
tainly leave you wanting more, if not to leap from
cliffs, then at least to land without a face full of dirt.

pies. There is what seems to be a constant rain of sky
divers landing just beyond the flight path.
The hands-on part of the lesson started when Pam,
the beginners' instructor, demonstrated how to put a
hang glider together. When not in use, gliders are
broken down and packed into canvas bags about 20
feet long and a foot in diameter. Rebuilding the glider
takes an expert about 15 minutes, but it takes several
bumbling novices a little less than 45 minutes to
complete the task.
Before we could fly the gliders, we had to learn a few
basic skills and procedures that are necessary for
proper flight. These included the pre-flight check, in
which every piece of the glider is inspected, and han
dling drills, where we learned how to manage the
glider in varying wind conditions.
The last thing I had to learn before I could fly was
how to take off. In order for a glider to get off the
ground, the wing needs air flowing at 15 to 20 mph.
That means your running speed plus the speed of the
wind must add up to 15 to 20 mph. The tricky part is
perfecting the run which, in action, looks like a com
bination of gazelle-like strides and professional race
walking. Your head must stay level while you take
bounding steps and try to gain speed.
By the time 1 had mastered these skills, I was getting
restless. 1 had spent two hours looking at gliders and
bounding around a cow pasture when what 1 really
wanted to do was fly.
My wish was finally granted when Pam told me to
march the glider to the top of the 50-foot training hill
and prepare for my first flight. I was nervous, but I
hauled the glider as far up the hill as Pam would allow
and hooked my harness to its frame. 1 stood up and
lifted the glider until I felt a tug on my harness.

"Hooked in!" I yelled to Pam, who was watching
from the bottom of the hill.
1 rested the glider on my shoulders and pointed the
nose directly into the oncoming wind, balancing the
glider as best as 1 could.
"Balanced!" I hollered, indicating that I was ready
to fly.
I looked side to side, making sure that my wingtips
were clear of my fellow gliders.
"Clear!" I called, and Pam gave me the thumbs up.
Swallowing the small lump in my throat, I began to
run. I gained speed quickly and felt an upward tug on
my harness. I kept running, but soon my legs were no
longer touching the ground. I was flying! I laughed as
I tilted the nose upwards to gain altitude.
"Okay, come down now!" called Pam after a few sec
onds. But 1 wasn't paying attention to Pam. I was fly
ing. I was only 20 feet off the ground, but I was flying.
I looked down at creation and noted that it was good.
Then disaster struck. While I was looking down, the
nose of the glider dipped and I gained speed. I lost al
titude rapidly. I saw the ground moving quickly below
me, and just before I touched down, I pedaled my legs
as fast as I could to catch up with it.
Unfortunately, my efforts were in vain. When I
touched down, my legs flew out from under me and I
was dragged through the weeds on my belly. I wound up
with a mouthful of grass and some banged up ribs, but
1 couldn't wait to drag the glider up the hill to try again.
And so went the remainder of the day. I didn't log
too many minutes of flight time, but I did get seven
more crash landings under my belt. Pam let us fly un
til the sun set, when we put away the gliders and dis
cussed the day's successes and the things we wanted
to improve upon.
I left the Hollister training grounds a little dirty, a
little tired, but very satisfied with my experience. I was
even asking when I could possibly come back for
more. I was invited to return for ground school, which
teaches fundamental flight theory, but this sounded a
little too much like school.
So would I recommend taking the first lesson and
finding out if flying a glider takes you to never before
experienced heights? Definitely, especially since
Mission Soaring Center is offering a discount on the
introductory lesson for Stanford students until May
15. At $85, the lesson is still a little pricey but better
than the normal $120 rate.
By the end of your lesson, which lasts between four
and five hours, you will have flown. Believe me, I saw
some of the world's least coordinated individuals
leave the ground before the day was over. The Center
developed the teaching techniques that are now used
nationwide for hang gliding instruction, and the
techniques work.
If you are afraid that just one glider ride will start an
addiction which will only be satiated by more and
more flight time, you are right on. One time will cer
tainly leave you wanting more, if not to leap from
cliffs, then at least to land without a face full of dirt.
