## The 						party with a cause? Rinc-A-Delt '98 stirs up questions 
### Jeff Cooper Contributing writer 
By this point in the year, most of us feel like we know
the Stanford traditions well. Freshmen go to Full Moon
on the Quad and tell themselves, "He looked like a senior
..." Seniors go to job fairs. Everyone goes to Big Game
and runs away from UC-Berkeley rioters.
Among the hallowed traditions that one reads about at
Freshman Orientation is the annual Rinc-A-Delt party.
Or is it a concert?

Every spring, the freshmen of
Rinconada fund raise like mad,
work like dogs and publicize like
fools, all to continue the tradition
of the extravagant carnival and
musicfest called Rinc-A-Delt.
This year, the tradition contin
ues on a slightly different track.
The stage will be packed as usual
— this year with a rising alterna
tive group called Train, the
bluesy E.B. Fraley Band, the
acoustic lushness of The Basics
and young rockers, Brando.
Rinc-A-Delt is being held as a
charity benefit For the first time,
All ticket sales will support the
Ecumenical Hunger Program.
The change in direction for the
concert has some students ques
tioning what the tradition is all
about. Most upperclassmen know
Rinc-A-Delt as the event that has
brought Phish, the Red Hot Chili

Peppers, They Might Be Giants and other stellar
musicians to campus.
In the last few years, though, the biggest acts to grace
Rinc-A-Delt's stage have been the girl & i and campus
mainstay, Canvas. Recent Rinc-A-Delt committees ar
gued that the dorm's tradition was less a concert and
more a party; they emphasized keeping the event free
and student-oriented.
The fact admission is being charged this year without
a payoff in the form of a well-known headliner has in
spired a groundswell of curiosity. Why don't they get the
"big names?" What is Rinc-A-Delt all about? What
should it be?
A "big name" past
It's impossible to understand the Rinc-A-Delt tradi
tion without looking at its 20-year history. The tradition
began as a backlash to what the organizers perceived as
fraternity domination of the campus party scene.
According to freshman Tim Springer, one of this year's
three Rinc-A-Delt committee co-chairs, "Rinc-A-Delt
was originally put on to prove that an all-frosh dorm
could put on a party that was just as good as any of the

frat parties on campus."
The name Rinc-A-Delt itself is a satire of a fraternity
name. The party was born in 1977 to provide an alterna
tive to "the frat genre, which is just a bunch of people in
a small room with bad beer," according to junior Josh
Lippman, 1996 Rinc-A-Delt chair.
Several of the early Rinc-A-Delts featured mock initia
tion and pledging rituals.
The tradition caught on instantly at Rinconada and
has been held every year since. It didn't become the mu-

sical extravaganza that most students and recent alumni
remember, however, until the last decade or so. The in
creasing success of several of Rinc-A-Delt's headline
bands after their concert appearances gave the event a
reputation for securing and showcasing rising bands.
Although Rinc-A-Delt makes no claims to discovering
Phish, the addition of the band to the 1990 show went a
long way toward establishing Rinc-A-Delt's reputation as
first and foremost a national act caliber concert.
Similar luck with several of the bands in the last decade
helped make Rinc-A-Delt one of the year's premiere mu
sical events in the minds of students. The Red Hot Chili
Peppers, They Might Be Giants and The Samples all
played a year or two before their popularity reached its
national peak.
All of these bands played for relatively small amounts
of money, largely as attempts to widen their fan base.
Phish played for only $2,000. This is about $500 less
than the amount that Train, this year's headliner, will be
playing for.
The 1994 Rinc-A-Delt, which featured They Might Be
Giants, was the last to feature a nationally-touring act.

Efforts were made in the last few years to secure a signif
icant headline act. But difficulties in scheduling a venue,
communication problems with bands and bad luck with
tour routing plagued these attempts.
For the 1996 event, the Stanford Concert Network at
tempted to secure both the Violent Femmes and George
Clinton. Both acts fell through. The Violent Femmes
"backed out around March because they didn't want to
tour," according to Lippman. George Clinton could only
offer a multi-concert deal, which the concert network

wasn't able to accept.
Facing these scheduling and
funding difficulties, student orga
nizers have chosen in the last few
years to return to the tradition of a
free carnival rather than to fund a
concert by selling tickets.
No one can argue that the Rinc-
A-Delts of recent years have stuck
closer to the original concept of
providing a freshman-organized
party alternative. Just as true, how
ever, is the perception that having
an act like Phish visit campus ere
ated tremendous student excite
ment in previous years — excite
ment which has since left
Rinc-A-Delt's stage.
The troubles with tradition
This year's organizers have been
asked two big questions. Why di
verge from the Rinc-A-Delt tradi
tion of free student carnivals? And
if they are charging for tickets, why

not secure a "real" band?
Brent Jacobsen, also a co-chair on this year's Rinc-A-
Delt committee, feels that this year's concert will strike a
good balance between bringing new life to a tradition
that many see as faltering, and acknowledging the pres
sure of having an affordable concert backed with big
name stars.
The question that Jacobsen and the other organizers
have faced more than any other is, "Why isn't someone
good playing Rinc-A-Delt?" For the Rinconada freshmen,
the answer is "Someone good is playing."
According to Doug Ales, the third co-chair of the Rinc-
A-Delt committee, "We and every Bay Area newspaper
and radio station think that Train is going to be huge."
Train, an up-and-coming alternative rock band, re
cently signed a three-album deal with Columbia Records.
Its self-titled first album has seen significant airplay on
KFOG 104.5 FM and KLLC 97.3 FM (Alice), two major
contemporary music stations in the Bay Area. For this
year's organizers, the choice to headline with a Bay Area
band reflected the decision to make the show "a sort of lo
cal spotlight festival," according to Ales.
