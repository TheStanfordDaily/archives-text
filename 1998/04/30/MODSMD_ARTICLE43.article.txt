Jacobsen says that the organizers were in intermit
tent contact with the Squirrel Nut Zippers throughout
the year, but that band eventually pulled out due to
scheduling difficulties.
For other national acts, the problem has proven to be
funding. The Rinc-A-Delt committee looked into touring
acts such as No Doubt, who asked for a starting fee of
around $100,000.
"The concert network can bring in people with their
funding," said Jacobsen, "but you need a big donor to get
someone huge."
So why, many students have been asking, isn't the
Stanford Concert Network bringing anyone in? Corky
Gainsford, the director of the concert network, said that the
acts at past Rinc-A-Delts have appeared thanks to "the con
cert network's monetary backing, professional advice, a lit
tle bit of luck and the willingness of Rinconada to agree
upon groups that the concert network could provide."
For this year's Rinc-A-Delt, although the concert net
work has provided both monetary and advisory support
including budgeting, security and promotion advice, the
organizers didn't contact the concert network until the
lineup for the concert was already scheduled.
Gainsford said that in the cases of Phish and They
Might Be Giants, "the concert network was responsible
for booking the bands and was consulted in every step of
the planning process. It was therefore willing to provide
greater financial support in order to ensure that the con
cert would be successful."
Organizing the latest Rinc-A-Delt
As happens often in the music world, this year's lineup
was developed mostly through personal connections. The
organizers contacted Eric Fraley of the E.B. Fraley Band
early in the year. Ales had met the band at his brother's
wedding, where it had played. When he called Fraley re
garding Rinc-A-Delt, Fraley was only too happy to oblige.
"They weren't too sure about the Bay Area music
scene," said Fraley, "and I said I could help out." Fraley
has been deeply involved in the San Francisco music in-

dustry for the last four or five years and had a va
riety of musical and commercial contacts which
he offered to Jacobsen and Ales.
The organizers contacted Train with Fraley's aid.
Fraley had played with Train at an earlier music fes
tival and suggested them to Ales and Jacobsen, who
contacted the band and secured it for the concert.
Similarly, Fraley had heard The Basics before. "I
watched them doing coffeehouse gigs back in Palo
Alto," he said, "and I played with them myself at
the occasional concert or festival."
When Train referred the organizers to Brando
— a band with whom they'd played a number of
concerts before — the lineup fell into place.
For Jacobsen and Ales, the lineup they'd found
seemed to provide a balance between minimizing
costs and offering the audience an exciting concert
with potentially big-name acts. Particularly with
Train's recent record deal, said Fraley and
Jacobsen, Rinc-A-delts's star seems to be on the
rise.

Train is also the only band in the lineup charg
ing its normal fee for the concert. Both Brando and the
E.B. Fraley band are playing for free, while The Basics is
charging a nominal amount for its appearance.
The fact that they didn't have to spend much for great
talent, Jacobsen said, enabled the organizers to seriously
consider having Rinc-A-Delt in Frost Amphitheater.
The decision to hold the show there was based on a vari

ety of factors. The cooncert could only charge admission in
a controlled venue like Frost, and all the organizers agreed
on the desirability of Frost as an excellent concert venue.
"It's a kick-ass place to hold a show," Jacobsen said.
The use of Frost has been another point of tension be
tween the Rinc-A-Delt committee and the concert net
work. University policy regarding Frost requires that stu
dent groups holding concerts there receive approval from
the concert network. This was problematic because Rinc-
A-Delt organizers did not pursue this avenue until after
the bands had already been scheduled.
Gainsford felt strongly that "none of the bands playing
Rinc-A-Delt have a large enough audience, nor enough
interest from the Stanford community, to merit lirge
concert network involvement.... In our experience, it is
not wise to believe that an act of this size can fill a 9,000
capacity venue such as Frost Amphitheater."
Frost admittedly requires a good deal more financial
leverage than Wilbur Field, where Rinc-A-Delt has been
held for the last three years. But the Rinconada freshmen
have secured the necessary funding, largely through an
increased commercial presence at the concert.
This is the first year that a significant portion of the
funding for Rinc-A-Delt will be donated by corporate
sponsors, including Texas-based consulting company
Trilogy. This initiative was mostly led by the committee
chairs and Fraley.
Jacobsen praised Fraley for his fund raising efforts, say
ing, "he's been really helpful — many of the companies were

'If you throw a show,
it can be just a show,
but we think it's a much more
meaningful effort if it benefits a charity.'

his connections... He's done a lot of outside groundwork."
A charitable twist
In addition to the return to Frost and the
increased corporate presence, this year's organizers have
made perhaps the biggest change yet to Rinc-A-Delt. Rather
than using the ticket sales as fund raising to cover concert

expenses, the committee chairs decided to contribute all
ticket sales to the Ecumenical Flunger Program, a Bay Area
charity focused on families in the East Palo Alto area.
"We saw it as a great way of getting people involved,"
Jacobsen said. "If you throw a show, it can be just a
show, but we think it's a much more meaningful effort
if it benefits a charity."
Ales agreed. "We chose to do Rinc-A-Delt for charity
this year because we didn't really see the point in just
throwing a regular concert for the Stanford community
when they already have enough of those anyway."
The organizers chose the Ecumenical Hunger Program
because of its local ties and success in helping whole fam
ilies overcome poverty. Since 100 percent of the ticket
sales are going to charity, all of the expenses of the con
cert are being covered through dorm funds, corporate
and personal fundraising and personal donations.
Jacobsen feels that this new angle will be a significant
boost to attendance and awareness. "Having it for charity
gets people more interested in the show," he said.
"We're all really excited about the show," Ales said.
Fraley echoed the sentiments, saying that the experience
of helping to organize has been a blast and that he's look
ing forward to playing.
The Rinc-A-Delt committee is thrilled with what they
see as an exciting and talented lineup, a new chance to
contribute to the community and the perfect venue in
which to throw a party.
To those detractors who raise questions as to the qual
ity of the lineup, Jacobsen points out, "We did e-mail Dave
Matthews earlier in the year, and he hasn't said no yet."
Some students remain pessimistic about the new di
rections of the event.
"It would be much wiser to hold this concert on
Wilbur Field," maintains Gainsford.
For this year's organizers, the key issue has been strik
ing the balance between community outreach, party tra
dition and musical excellence. You can judge that balance
for yourself on Sunday.
