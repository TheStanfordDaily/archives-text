## FAR: 'Water and Solutions' 
### 
What Far's latest, "Water & Solutions," lacks in
raw force it makes up for in harmony. The
album hits a fast pace on a number of
tracks. "The System" is traditional Far — hard-core,
blunt and heavy. The majority of the album, however,
rests consistently on a mid-tempo beat and Jonah
Matranga's powerful vocals. Despite its bold experi
mentation, "Water" is Far's most digestable album.
Each track flows to the next very smoothly, generat
ing a cohesive recording.
Far's sound is unique because it successfully
straddles the void between melodic and furious
beats, producing songs beautified by hard-core
rhythms. The group breaks free of all barriers that
would otherwise have confined unexplored realms.
Chris Robyn's drumming maintains the power of
the album, controlling the direction of each song.
On "Mother Mary" and"The System," Far's new

sound is at its best. With "Milk," Jonah's soft vocals
are contrasted against a tough Shaun Lopez guitar
riff, while "System" is driven by a distorted, crunch
ing rhythm section.
Old fans will definitely enjoy the new songs —
they are a bit of a throwback to Far's first album,
"Listening Game." With subsequent releases, Far's
sound became harsh and aggressive. Returning to
the roots of its sound is a good move attributable
to the growth of Matranga as a singer and guitarist.
With "Water," Matranga comes alive.
Far's new album is only a disappointment for
those who favor a pedal-to-the-metal hard-core
sound; but few will find the listen unenjoyable.
"Water" brings a less familiar dimension of the
band to center stage.
