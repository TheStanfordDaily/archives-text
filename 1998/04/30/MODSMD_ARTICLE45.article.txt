# Derek Bell: 'A Celtic Evening'
## 
### 
In Derek Bell's W A Celtic Evening," every piece
meshes into an indistinguishable conglomeration
of sound. The album consists of traditional Irish
tunes performed in front of a loud audience. If the mu
sic hadn't all sounded exactly the same, the CD might
have proven listenable.That is not the case. I could only
stomach five of the 70 minutes of music.
The two worst aspects of the album are the clapping
sequences and Derek Bell's spoken introductions to the
songs. Soothing classical Irish music does NOT go well
with applause. It is obnoxious. The fluidity of the work
is compromised by these interruptions.
Derek Bell is amusing. He tells corny jokes and has
a sweet Irish accent. However, this is a CD. Having
someone talk through every other musical sequence
gets old quickly. One can assume that live clapping and
talking added to the power of the show. Yet, CD pur
chasers are not transfixed by the performance ipso
facto. The listener is not at the Mountain View Center
for the Performing Arts. The new medium deserved a
new approach. Because each audience is distinct, the
producers should have recognized the need for a
change in the presentation.
Maireid Sullivan, a popular singer and songwriter,
performs beautifully. Her vocal accompaniment com
pliments Derek Bell's harp playing. Together, they pro
duce a soothing sound. They are both very talented.
The problems that arise are in no way linked to the tal
ent of the performers.
The problem with the CD lies on J. Donald Walters'
shoulders as he selected what Sullivan and Bell played.
If the works on the CD weren't so interchangeable, this
CD would have received a better reception.
