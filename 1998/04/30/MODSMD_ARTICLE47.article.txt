# Fluorescein:
## 'High Contrast Comedown' 
### 
Flourescein promises not to offer the same old tired pop radio rock that ap
pears to be the rage these days. Instead, it gives us "High Contrast
Comedown," an album worth listening to. Drummer Rocco Bidlovski is
the man to thank for this.
Bidlovski's drumming is tight throughout the album. He provides the dri
ving force for the album, pushing every song to its extreme. Guitarists Joey
Rubenstein and Greg Mora nicely complement Bidlovski's drumming.
However the guitaring sometimes becomes a bit repetitive.
Fluorescein vaguely reminds me of Weezer without being nearly as peppy.
Flourecein's music is mainly fast and consists of Bidlovski's drumming,
Rubenstein's and Mora's guitar, Higa's bass and Mora as the lead vocalist.
The one sore spot in this album, aside from the sometimes repetitive guitar
work, is the lyrics. They sometimes made me cringe. "There's a room with a
view, but there's no window" referring to a slaughterhouse seemed a little trite,
but overall the music is distracting enough to make me forgive the group.
