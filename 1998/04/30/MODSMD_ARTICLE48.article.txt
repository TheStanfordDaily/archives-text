# Next: 'Rated Next'
## 
### 
Have you heard these lyrics recently: "You've got that love that
1 want / That love that I need / Girl, it's so smooth and so
complete / You've got that butta love"? If not, you don't lis
ten to the radio, because it's been getting a lot of airplay. It's the first
hit off Next's debut album "Rated Next."
The chorus seems sweet and romantic, but the lyrics dispel that
notion. Here are a few gems from the same song: "You've got those
sexy eyes / enticing thighs / you make me rise" and "Wanna take all
your clothes off / sex you 'til the song goes off."
The songs on "Rated Next" range from the sensual with songs like
"I Still Love You" and "Do You Think About Me" to the explicitly sex
ual with "Penetration," "Phone Sex" and "Sexitude." Sometimes both
elements are combined in the same song, as in "Butta Love."
Of course, some of the songs are just plain silly, like "Stop, Drop
& Roll." The song's title puts me more in the mindset of a fire drill
than a romantic evening.
Next is an all male trio with a good sound. Now all the group
needs to do is decide on its identity. The band's too nasty to be Boyz
II Men and it needs one more person be Jodeci.
Next harmonizes well, and most of the songs are really good.
However, the arrangement of the songs on the album is confusing.
One minute I'm listening to a song like "Cozy" that talks about
how men and women can be comfortable spending an evening to
gether without having sex. Then, I'm listening to "Penetration," a
song graced by Naughty By Nature's Treach rapping about a three
some, bondage, cuffs, oral sex and masturbation.
Can someone tell me what's going on? I'm confused. All I can
say is, "Next!"
