## 'Wicked City Soundtrack' 
### 
Somewhere along the line, it became a
requirement to release a soundtrack
with each new movie. Although some-

times this convention results in an interesting collection of different
bands and genres, we more often end up with "gems" like the soundtrack
to Wicked City. In this soundtrack we are given some of the worst songs
ever recorded by normally decent bands.
One of the first songs on "Wicked City" features a singer growling,
"Long hair, short hair, no hair at all / skinny, fat, short or tall / All the
people are the same / raise your pride and show your shame." Have no
fear, the inspirational sermons don't end there.
5 Year Plan's attempt at uplifting, hard-core a cappella leads to a
painful combination of off-key singing and stupid lyrics. Shades Apart
rails against world trade, America and The Man, but such an earnest
(albeit cliched) message is a little hard to believe when it's spit out over
a happy, ska beat. Orange 9mm and H2O also contribute impressively
unlistenable tracks.
However, a few tracks make valiant attempts to save "Wicked City."
CIV and Sweet Diesel deliver two songs that are catchy, although some
what predictable. And Demonspeed's Togo the Clown" mixes hard-core
with drunken lounge singing. The concoction is suprisingly successful.
The only noteworthy track comes from Mephiskapheles, who, unlike
most of the other bands, does not fall prey to taking itself too seriously.
In fact, the well-crafted ska on "Doomsday" is catchy enough to over
power even those who have grown tired of this genre.
But in the end it is not enough, for these few bright spots are over
shadowed by the bigger, meaner and stupider contributions. There is a
lesson to be learned here — growling, sweating and insipid lyrics do not
a fine soundtrack make.
