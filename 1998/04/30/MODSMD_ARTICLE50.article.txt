## The 						Big Miss Intense action can't overcome a bad script 
### 
{ r-pihe Big Hit" is nothing but a big disappointment. Imagine walk
ing into a crowded movie theater to watch the newest movie pro-
Jl. duced by John Woo. The first two scenes are really great, and
you're impressed by the movie's speed right from the start. So you think,
"Wow. This is going to be a 'Big Hit.' "
But not long after that, the action gives way to one of the most absurd,
obscure and pathetic plots seen in a long time.
The story is about four hit men working for some strange organization
whose goals are never really explained. However, before the first 30 min
utes of the movie are over, two of the four would-be-main-characters
completely disappear. We are left with "good guy" Mel Smiley (Mark
Wahlberg) and "bad guy" Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips). The action takes
place in San Francisco, our beloved metropolis.

.Smiley has to watch over Keiko (China Chow), a rich Asian industrial
ist's daughter who the group has managed to kidnap. Cisco masterminds
the kidnapping as a means to get some extra cash, but their "hit boss"
Paris (Avery Brooks) is not told about it.
The plan ends up completely backfiring. The industrialist is broke. He
is also Paris' pal, and Keiko turns out to be Paris' goddaughter. Cisco re
veals his "evilness" by pointing the finger at good old Mel and making him
the next target of Paris' hit men.
Meanwhile, Mel and Keiko are falling in love, even though Mel has a
fiancee and a lover.
Mel would be interestingly complex if he were a little less idiotic. He is
generous, sensitive and hooked on Maalox. He says that his greatest fear is
to imagine people not liking him.
But he kills people! Mel's character is an inconsistent attempt to schiz
ophrenically add innocence and consciousness to someone who shows no
remorse about murdering people.
Lou Diamond Phillips has the best performance. When the horrible
script and infantile dialogues give him a break, he is able to stir up laughs
and make us forget — at least for a moment — that the movie should
really be called "The Big Miss."
This movie may be a good choice for those who enjoy endless fights
and explosions and have no frat parties to go to. Director Che-Kirk
Wong actually does a good job with a couple of action scenes at the be
ginning and the end. One thing you may want to carry with you is a pair
of those hard-core, my-roommate-snores earplugs, fust in case the
movie gets too loud.
