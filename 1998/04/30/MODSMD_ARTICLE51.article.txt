# It' s gotta be the hair
## Gyneth Paltrow sports double 'dos in 'Sliding Doors' 
### 
C liding Doors" is on one level about fate, destiny, free will, true
and a deep questioning of life's possibilities. On another
level, it's really about hairdos. This is not to say that the film
totally misses its philosophical target. Ultimately, however, it is a ro
mantic comedy and nothing more. Once you accept that, "Sliding
Doors" can be enjoyed for what it is.
The movie features Gwyneth Faltrow doing an unconvincing
English accent that is fraught with oh-so-English slang like "git" and
"wanker." Paltrow portrays Helen, a woman who gets fired from her
job and thus rushes to catch a subway home in the middle of the day.
The camera then splits Paltrow into two Helens, one who catches
the subway and one who just misses its sliding doors (hence the

clever title). The Helen who is on the train arrives home to find her
slimy boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) in bed with a woman named
Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn). She walks out on him. The Helen that
stands downcast on the platform is too late to catch him in the act
and continues life with this horrible creature.
The Helens are distinguishable because the Helen who frees her
self from the cheating Gerry gets the short blond haircut that Paltrow
is known for. The alternate Helen maintains long brown locks.
Director Peter Howitt is attempting to show how one moment in
a person's life can determine the larger course of that person s future.
To some extent, he does this effectively. The switching between blond
Gwynnie and brunette Gwynnie is smoothly done, with seamless cuts
between the two realities. The frustrating part is the extent to which
the brunette Helen suffers at the hands of Gerry. Gerry has no re
deeming qualities that would make it logical for either Helen to stay
with him.
The introduction of James (John Hannah, "Four Weddings and a
Funeral") as a sweet, chattering suitor for blond Helen provides more
than enough comic charm to balance out the drama. James imper
sonates Monty Python and cracks a joke in every frame that he is in.
Hannah makes "Sliding Doors" a very watchable romance with a
hysterical supporting cast. The characters underline the notion that
English people are just funnier than Americans. Paltrow does a fine
job as both Helens, and she makes it possible for the film to overcome
its gimmicky beginning and end. It would seem that pretending to be
British is a good career move for Gwynnie.

Remember when Gwynnie and Brad Pitt had that same haircut?
