# Spike Lee slam clunks
## 'He Got Game' will move you 
### 
Perhaps it is Spike Lee's undeniable love of basketball that lends
his new film, "He Got Game," its drive and sheer power. Or per
haps it is the heart-wrenching story line, which sounds implau
sible on paper but translates perfectly on screen. Or perhaps it is even
the compellingly real performance of Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray
Allen as Jesus Shuttlesworth, a high school senior who happens to be
the best basketball player in the country. Jesus is being courted by
every college in America and damn near every team in the NBA.
Maybe it is the combination of all three of these things — great
performances, powerful story and a love of the game — that makes
"He Got Game" as moving as it is.
Denzel Washington plays Jake Shuttlesworth, Jesus' convicted fa
ther. Jake has just been paroled at the behest of the governor, who

promises a commuted sentence if Jake can convince his estranged
son to sign with the governor's alma mater, Big State. Washington is
surpisingly un-extraordinary in his role, if only because his charac
ter is supposed to be uncharismatic.
When Jake finds Jesus, he discovers that Jesus has almost single
handedly been raising himself and his younger sister Mary since their
mother's death. The Jesus that Jake encounters is a stranger and a
very complicated person. Having had to grow up without parents
and raise his sister on his own, Jesus is undoubtedly a mature man.
And yet, he is still a kid — an inner-city high school senior faced
with the problems of alcohol, sex and violence. Now he faces the
toughest decision of his life after being thrown into the brutal world
of recruiting without any reliable guidance.
Lee handles the father-son relationship carefully, although he does
use more than a few uneccessary religious references. It is less a bas
ketball movie and more a study in human relationships. Ultimately,
"He Got Game" benefits from the heartstring-pulling relationship
between Jake and Jesus and from Allen's wonderful performance.
Which is not to say that "He Got Game" is a perfect movie. Lee falls
victim to the disease that literally gets him every time — the desire to
do too much with one film. He wants "He Got Game" to be a story of
father-son reconciliation, an on the corruption of sports re
cruiting, a commentary on the alienation of urban life and a statement
about the dissolution of African-American family life. Ifs crazy to
think that one movie can be all these things. The crazier thing is, "He
Got Game" almost is.
