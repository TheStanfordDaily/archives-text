# Not your usual sex film...
## 'Post Coitum' will get you out of bed 
### 
I suspect that Brigitte Rotian's splendid new film doesn't stand a chance in this
country. "Post Coitum" is a multi-layered story of love and loss with a fine script
and absolutely the right cast. The problem is that it is tailored to an audience quite
different from the one that has been lovingly built up by Hollywood. It's a movie
made out of bricks and stone, sweat and tears —• not plastic.
The heart of the story is a sudden wiJd love affair and the unbearable agony
when it breaks up. Diane, played by RoUan herself, is a successful 40-year-old
book editor with two teenage sons, a husband and a struggling writer to look af
ter. One day she meets a beautiful Italian youth named Emilio (Boris Terral) who
sends her life spinning in cartwheels before leaving her.
Meanwhile, her lawyer-husband Philippe (Patrick Chesnais) has had a new
case on his hands. He has to defend Madame Lepluche, their next-door neighbor
who has recently carving- forked her way into the headlines as a husband-killer.

Unpleasant as this is, Philippe's woes become much worse when he starts to
suspect Diane's affair. Against his better judgment, he ends up eavesdropping on
his wife's telephone conversations and breaks down doors in anger.
Rotian gives a first-rate performance as Diane. She has the same sort of lead
ing-role charisma as the wonderful Carmen Maura, whose most famous part, in
Almod6var's "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," had much of the
same hapless yet determined quality. The role of Diane is richly graduated — her
interactions with her sons, her husband and her boss at the publishing firm bring
out very different aspects of her character. Equally significant is the working re
lationship she has forged with the writer, Francois (Nils Tavernier), who spends
much of his time suffering from writer's block.
Terral is pure animal in the role of Diane's lover. He leers and howls and
moves like a python. It's a joy to watch Emilio enrapture Diane to the very point
of folly. It's never quite possible to hate him, although he invites it with his ro
bustly narcissistic ways. It is one of the film's great strengths that Emilio doesn't
lapse into being a contemptible caricature. Perversely, his moral stature seems
greatest at the time when Diane is close to her nadir.
There are explosions of surreal madness here and there. Just for fun, there's a
squealing cat, a close-harmony wine glass musician and some rocky piano practices.
One of the best parts in the movie is the appearance of a very tasteful pink cloud
that floats around in one happy scene.
Unfortunately for such a glorious film, it's a pity that the previews and pub
licity seem to be on a different wavelength. "Post Coitum" is not a wild comedy,
nor is it an explicit sex-fest. It's hardly even about taboo-breaking (in this case the
one concerning older women and younger men). Really, it's a very simple story
about one or two aspects of the human condition. And it's almost perfectly told.
