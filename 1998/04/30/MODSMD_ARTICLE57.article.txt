# 27-word fiction
## Editor's Ricks 
### 
Hello, everyone. We would like to extend our
warmest wishes and blessings to you all this holiday
season.
"What holiday would that be?"
That is what all of you are wondering. Well, we
don't feel like telling you. We have been very patient
for 50,000 years and we don't care if you live or die.
That was an indirect quote from"The
Neverending Story," a wonderful source of 2 7-word
fiction for those of you who are too lazy to come up
with fiction on your own.

This week we had a lot of fiction entries. That is
a very good thing. Let's keep up the good work.
Have you ever considered working for the CIA?
If anyone out there has considered such a thing, we
would like you to write a piece of fiction about it.
Are any of you sad because you don't have a job
lined up yet? It would be nice to get some fiction
about that, too.
The editors
