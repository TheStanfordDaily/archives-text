## The
						art of non- committal sex 
### Mae West Coltrane 
1 often want to "get some"
without the fuss of flowers,
dinners, movies and other tan
gential expenses that empty
the wallet but not the cojones.
I'm sure you do, too. Let's ex
plore some of the places and
happenings on campus that
offer students sexual relief
sans romance. We ain't talking
about rape here, people. Just
free consensual love.
Now that the pro fros are
gone, we can speak freely about
what some of us really do here.
Like hooking up with randoms at
a weekend party. Freshman year,
when my (not just male!) bunch
got trashed, we'd usually hit the
Row for some action. That is the
first avenue someone looking for
free sex should explore.
Some of us got more than
we ever dreamed of and some
more than we ever wanted. For
some, it seemed that there was
no bigger turn-on than a bottle
of vodka, a crowded room full
of strangers and the beat of an
amateur DJ or student band.
Moving slowly on the sticky
floors, we danced and
schmoozed with any cutie who
showed up (and who is not a
cutie after 10 shots?). For some
it took two dirty dances. For
some a bit more, maybe some
more shots, but we all eventu
ally had "HORNY" written on
our foreheads. For women, this
can be dangerous, but if you
drink responsibly and go in
with friends knowing what you
want, you can stay safe.
Anyway, add a few more
drunk people, and the sce
nario for a long one-night
stand is in place. Some got so
horned up that they couldn't
wait for a room and went at it
on the dance floor or in the
parking lot. The downside
was that nobody cared about
safety while humping on the
car, and some went through a
morning scare after waking
up in some stranger's bed.
Bathrooms are pretty good,
too. I recently talked to the
cleaning lady in the infamous
Lane History Corner, and she
had some stories! Apparently,
the building has a very sexual
presence. Did you hear about
the couple who was making
out in a room on the third floor
and decided to rush naked to
the downstairs bathroom? The
midnight custodian has! She
has the unpleasant job of
scraping the stall walls clean of
scribbled sexual messages,

invitations and fantasies.
The men's bathroom in the
building's basement is defi
nitely a happening place. There
are peepholes in two of the
stalls, and meeting times adorn
the doors of the toilets.
"4/21/98 meet here for fun
at 5 p.m. Under 25 only." I
don't think he meant tennis. In
the women's room, there are
fewer peepholes but the scrib
ble abounds. Most of it isn't
sexual, but some invite the
ladies to "hook up here in the
morning." There are stories
about these places in the gay
community, but nobody will
tell you that they have ever
been. One just hears about the
Lane History Corner.
My advice: Play safe if
you're going to cruise in that
enlightened basement. You
never know who goes there.
Oh, and, if you meet a class
mate in the next stall, remem
ber that you'll have to see him /
her for the rest of the quarter!
If you want to know more
about the guy / gal you're going
to do the nasty with, you can
also use the Internet. Yes, there
is a way to hook up on the Net
with Stanford people! The chat
rooms have so many Stanford
kids on, it boggles the mind.
Here are some of them: IRC
(Internet relay chat) allows you
to join a room with any topic,
even if 80 percent of them are of
a sexual nature. You chat with
people from all over the world,
but you can always find out who
is logged on from the Stanford
domain. Even better, you can
see what room they are in! To
get to it, simply type "ire" when
you would normally type "pine"
or "elm" on e-mail. You can
send a message to them, act sur
prised that they're at Stanford
("What a coincidence!") ard
then see what they're looking
for. It might be you! For our gay
audience I recommend another
Internet service that works only
on fast machines: www.gay.com
is the place where you can chat
and hook up. There are regu
larly 20 to 30 Stanford students
in these rooms, so the cruising
grounds aren't too bountiful,
but "new faces" (read closeted
freshmen and freshwomen) al
ways show up.
Enough. If I say more, I
might be torn to pieces by
"True Love Waits" or some
crusader screaming his lungs
out in White Flaza.
Now you know how much
fun parties, academic build
ings and computers really are.
