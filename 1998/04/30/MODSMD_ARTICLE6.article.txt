# Gulf vet Gustafson attacks Iraq policy
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Senior staff writer 
During a trip to Iraq last summer.
Erik Gustafson said he was surprised
by the Iraqis' warmth and openness
to an American Gulf War veteran.
Despite the harsh effects of a war and
subsequent sanctions against the
country, an Iraqi woman told
Gustafson she knew he was not at
fault
"We understand that you are not
your government." said the woman,
who gives tours of a bomb shelter
where most of her family was killed
by two U.S. "smart" missiles. "The
American people would never have
supported killing those children in
that shelter."
What she asked Gustafson and
other Americans to consider in re
turn was simple: "The people of Iraq
are not their government."
Gustafson spoke at Bechtel In
ternational Center yesterday as part
of a nationwide tour to convince
Americans that sanctions imposed
on Iraq by the United States and
I 'nited Nations are entrenching a
formerly prosperous country in
poverty. The Organization of Arab
Students in Stanford co-sponsored
the speech with the ASSI Program
Board and the Arab Student Associ
ation of Northern California.
More than 1 1/2 million people
have died as a result of seven years of
sanctions. C iustafson said.
With a mixture of personal sto

ries. slides and poetry. Gustafson told
the stories of some w ho are still alive,
portraying a land wracked by lack of
medicine and fixxi.
The malnourished children and
overflowing hospitals were "not
caused by a natural catastrophe. This
is caused by the Security Council of
the I nited Nations." Gustafson said,
showing a slide of a young child.
"This child has the distended stom
ach of famine yet is living above some
of the richest oil reserves in the
world."
Before the Gulf War. Iraq boast
ed a proud past and prosperous pre
sent. Gustafson said. Writing, laws
and libraries originated there, while a
hospital in Baghdad performed the
world's second heart transplant in
I%N.
