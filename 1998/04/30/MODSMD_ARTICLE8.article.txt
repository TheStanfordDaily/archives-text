## Davis enters race Lt. governor jumps to first-place tie

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)
California's topsy-turvy governor's
race, a costly televised slugfest dom
inated by millionaires, has taken
another weird twist: The poorest
contender, barely able to afford TV
time, is on the march.
Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a veteran
politician and one-time chief of staff
to former Gov. Jerry Brown, went
from last among Democrats to a
neck-and-neck tic for first with
almost-a-billionaire A 1 Checchi,
according to poll results released
yesterday.
Davis' dramatic move follows his
first stab at TV campaigning, about
$1 million worth of mostly biograph
ical spots. That's a piddling amount
in a state where the last campaign
for governor cost $55 million, but it's
about one fifth of all that Davis has
to spend.
Checchi, by comparison, has
spent an estimated $23 million on his
campaign in the last six months. The
former Northwest Airlines chair
man has a personal fortune of about
$f>(X) million.
"The dough that Checchi is
putting into his campaign shows he's
trying to buy the job, and I think

people see through that," said John
Snyder, a local real estate broker.
"They see Davis as more of i chal
lenge" to the likely Republican
nominee, Attorney General Dan
Lungren.
Dropping into Davis' old spot at
the rear of the Democratic pack is
Rep. Jane Harman of Los Angeles,
a three-term lawmaker and wife of
an audio equipment manufacturer.
She, too, trailed Checchi early but
surged ahead after her own $4 mil
lion media blitz.
Checchi targeted her in a nega
tive ad campaign that focused on her
record of missed votes in Congress
— the second worst in the House —
and her support withered.
I'he irony is that Davis, not Chec
chi, appears to have reaped the ben
efits of Checchi's anti-Harman cam
paign. One result of Davis' surge:
Checchi plans to hit Davis in a new
round of negative ads, probably by
the weekend.
"It's so very fluid," said Republi
can political analyst Tony Ouinn.
Harman "wasn't known but went on
TV and jumped out to the lead
because people said, 'Yeah, yeah,
that sounds good.' "
