Don't tell these kids where to sit
VANCOUVER. British Columbia (AP) — A
human rights tribunal has ordered a lodge owner to
compensate a couple with three children because he
suggested they eat in his cafeteria rather than the more
formal main dining rtx>m.
The lodge owner, Gordon Robson. was indignant
when notified Tuesday that British Columbia's human
rights tribunal ordered him to pay the family $840.
"Things like this are what causes people like me to
not want to do business in 8.C.," he said.
"This is government gone nuts," he said later.
Micallef, his wife and three children were directed
to the cafeteria in accordance with a restaurant policy
intended to keep children from disturbing others.
When the Micallefs decided they didn't like the
cafeteria, they were seated in the dining room and
served.
Micallef claimed discrimination, saving his children

were judged a problem even though they had done
nothing wrong.
Imelda Marcos withdraws from race
MANILA. Philippines (AP) — Dressed in black
and close to tears, Imelda Marcos withdrew from the
presidential race yesterday, ending her quest to regain
dominance in Philippine politics.
Still, the move could allow her to avoid prison with
a presidential pardon and enjoy a share of her late hus
band's allegedly ill-gotten wealth.
The widow of dietator Ferdinand Marcos faces up
to 12 years in prison for a conviction on graft charges.
Free on bail pending an appeal, she also faces about
1 (K) other criminal and civil suits in connection with her
husband's 20-year rule.
Marcos, 68, told a news conference she was pulling
out of the race "to save the Filipino people from the
ultimate injustice of a possible bkxxly election."
