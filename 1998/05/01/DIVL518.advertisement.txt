event is coming your way soon!
The Class of2ool
Frosh Thank- A-Thon
When is it?
♦ May 4 through 10th
Who's organizing this?
♦ The Stanford Fund, which provides money for undergraduate
education, everything from scholarships, money to the
undergraduate departments, to residential computing and
the ethic community centers. Student groups can also earn
money for their activities by working for The Student
Partnership.
Why should I sign up?
♦ You will be giving back to Stanford and ultimately helping
yourself.
What's in it for me?
♦ Well if just helping Stanford isn't enough, you also get free
catered food from some great restaurants, a free T-shirt, and
the chance to win some cool prizes. On top of that, you
have the opportunity to connect with some amazing alumni
and form some valuable connections for the future.
Thank you to our sponsors, who include:
Just Desserts, Rush Hour Catering, Marie
Callendar's Restaurants and Bakeries, The
Bead Shop, Atidronico's, Cotnpadre's Mexican
Bar and Grill, and Trankie, Johnnie, and Luigi,
Too!
