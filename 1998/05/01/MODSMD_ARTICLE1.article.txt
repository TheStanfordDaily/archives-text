# E-mail privacy often breached
## 
### Leslie A. Gordon Contributing writer 
While composing e-mail mes
sages in Meyer Library, you realize
it's nearly 11 a.m. — time for class.
You send your last e-mail, pack up
your books and head out. When
you return home later that after
noon, your best friend, your dad
and several other people on your e
mail address book have left you
angry phone messages wondering
why you were so rude and vulgar in
your last e-mails to them. Why?
Because you failed to log off of
your e-mail session in Meyer, the
next person who sat down at that
computer had access to your e-mail
account. That unknown imposter
sent offensive e-mails to nearly
everyone in your e-mail address
book. But to the recipients, the e
mails appeared to have been sent
by you.
This is the most common way
that e-mail privacy is violated on
campus. But, unfortunately, it is
not the only way. Privacy breaches
affect not just students but the fac
ulty and staff as well.
"Everyone should be con
cerned about [e-mail| privacy,"
said Dennis Michael, the manager

of UNIX systems who is in charge
of the Leland systems and the
Sweet Hall cluster.
In addition to e-mail accounts
being accessed after a user has
failed to log off. "sniffers" — pro
grams used by network intruders
to gather user IDs and passwords
have also created security prob
lems. Last year, a hacker accessed
nearly 240 e-mail IDs and pass
words in the Durand Building's
computer system.
To deal with privacy breaches,
the Faculty Senate's Committee
on Academic Computing and In
formation Systems has developed
a Computer and Network Usage
Policy.
"Electronic mail and one's per
sonal computer files are treated
analogously to one's office files
and regular mail," said Biochem
istry Prof. Douglas Brutlag, chair
of the committee, summarizing the
policy. "It is considered an inva
sion of privacy to read another's
mail. In tact, it is a felony under
( alifornia law to break into a com
puter account and to copy or read
another's files, e-mail or not."
