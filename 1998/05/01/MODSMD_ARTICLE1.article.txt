# E-mail privacy often breached
## 
### Leslie A. Gordon Contributing writer 
While composing e-mail mes
sages in Meyer Library, you realize
it's nearly 11 a.m. — time for class.
You send your last e-mail, pack up
your books and head out. When
you return home later that after
noon, your best friend, your dad
and several other people on your e
mail address book have left you
angry phone messages wondering
why you were so rude and vulgar in
your last e-mails to them. Why?
Because you failed to log off of
your e-mail session in Meyer, the
next person who sat down at that
computer had access to your e-mail
account. That unknown imposter
sent offensive e-mails to nearly
everyone in your e-mail address
book. But to the recipients, the e
mails appeared to have been sent
by you.
This is the most common way
that e-mail privacy is violated on
campus. But, unfortunately, it is
not the only way. Privacy breaches
affect not just students but the fac
ulty and staff as well.
"Everyone should be con
cerned about [e-mail| privacy,"
said Dennis Michael, the manager

of UNIX systems who is in charge
of the Leland systems and the
Sweet Hall cluster.
In addition to e-mail accounts
being accessed after a user has
failed to log off. "sniffers" — pro
grams used by network intruders
to gather user IDs and passwords
have also created security prob
lems. Last year, a hacker accessed
nearly 240 e-mail IDs and pass
words in the Durand Building's
computer system.
To deal with privacy breaches,
the Faculty Senate's Committee
on Academic Computing and In
formation Systems has developed
a Computer and Network Usage
Policy.
"Electronic mail and one's per
sonal computer files are treated
analogously to one's office files
and regular mail," said Biochem
istry Prof. Douglas Brutlag, chair
of the committee, summarizing the
policy. "It is considered an inva
sion of privacy to read another's
mail. In tact, it is a felony under
( alifornia law to break into a com
puter account and to copy or read
another's files, e-mail or not."

violation of the Honor Code. "Not
a pleasant situation at all." Brutlag
said.
University General Counsel
Michael Roster noted, however,
that e-mails are presumed to be re
lated to University business and
therefore are entitled to University
access.
That is, Stanford cannot guaran
tee e-mail privacy because person
al e-mails are "purely incidental"
to its business.
Although they may not consti
tute a guarantee, the University
does have a number of helpful pre
vention methods and recommen
dations to increase privacy.
To prevent breaches like the
one in the Durand Building, the
Leland system now uses "Ker
beros," a security system that pre
vents packet sniffers by encrypting
login IDs and passwords that trav
el over the Internet. Unfortunate
ly. Kerberos only encrypts the ID
and password.

As for prevention [of
e-mail privacy breaches],
the first line of defense is
a good password.'

The text of the e-mail can still he
intercepted, according to Sweet
Hall consultant Adam Seishas, a
junior.
"Most of these attacks are prob
ably coming from somewhere off
campus." Seishas said.
More sophisticated encryption
programs can protect the text of e
mail messages, but they are often
less than intuitive, usually work
only with certain e-mail clients like
Eudora, and require both the
sender and receiver to have special
software installed, according to
Seishas.
Brutlag noted that these "public

key encryption programs are a
significant advance in computer
privacy. "It will allow us, for the
first time, to send confidential in
formation over the Internet with
the assurance that it is sent by the
person who encrypted it,"he said.
In another e-mail privacy twist,
you might be surprised to learn
thiit even when you hit "delete" in
a University e-mail program, the
message is not deleted.
Instead, the University main
tains all e-mail messages on backup
disks for one year as a safeguard
against system crashes and to satis
fy certain record-keeping obliga
tions.
Although system administra
tors have access to these disks and
are not required to show cause in
order to do so, these administra
tors only retrieve old messages if
there is strong evidence of a viola
tion of the Computer and Network
Usage Policy, Brutlag said.
Old e-mails could also be the
subject of a subpoena directed at
the University, but Roster said that
e-mail privacy in this context has
"not been a big issue."
Acceording to Roster, at the
same time, new software is being
developed to read even backup
tapes that have been erased and
could be used when old tapes are
the subject of litigation.
In Stanford's case, old e-mails
are most commonly accessed at the
request of the user. But recovery of
old e-mail messages is not easily
done, according to Stephen
Hansen, Computer Security Offi
cer.
"Recovering a given file from a
backup tape is not a trivial task,"
Hansen said. "The Leland system
alone backs up hundreds of giga
bytes of data every night. Recovery
of a single file can take days or even
weeks."
Still, if you have a Leland e-mail
account and you're uncomfortable
with marked-for-deletion e-mails
being maintained by the Universi
ty. Brutlag has a tip:
" The Leland backups are made
in the earlv morning hours. If you

set Eudora to read your mailbox
every midnight and also ask Eudo
ra to delete messages from the
server, then no copies of the mes
sages will exist on the Leland sys
tem during the backup," he said.
Brutlag warned, however, that
this strategy requires users to back
up message files themselves.

'It is a felony under
California law to break into
a computer account and to
copy or read another's files,
e-mail or not.'

"If you lose any mail — like los
ing the Eudora folder on your hard
drive — there will be nothing that
the Leland people will be able to
do to get your mail back for you,"
he said.
With his own e-mail account,
Brutlag employs the opposite strat
egy:
To ensure his messages are
backed up, he programs Eudora to
keep his e-mails on the server for
24 hours.
"As for prevention [of e-mail
privacy breaches]," Seishas said,
"the first line of defense is a good
password."
The Sweet Hall staff recom
mends choosing a password that is
at least eight characters long, is not
based on a dictionary word and
contains at least one non-lower
case letter, such as a number, up
percase letter or a punctuation
mark.
Passwords should never be
shared, and they should be re
placed periodically.
A poster in one campus com
puter lab reads, "Passwords are
like underwear. Change yours
often."
According to Brutlag, the most
common instance of people read
ing others' mail occurs when peo
ple walk away from a computer.

have also created security prob
lems. Last year, a hacker accessed
nearly 240 e-mail IDs and pass
words in the Durand Building's
computer system.
To deal with privacy breaches,
the Faculty Senate's Committee
on Academic Computing and In
formation Systems has developed
a Computer and Network Usage
Policy.
"Electronic mail and one's per
sonal computer files are treated
analogously to one's office files
and regular mail," said Biochem
istry Prof. Douglas Brutlag, chair
of the committee, summarizing the
policy. "It is considered an inva
sion of privacy to read another's
mail. In tact, it is a felony under
( alifornia law to break into a com
puter account and to copy or read
another's files, e-mail or not."

violation of the Honor Code. "Not
a pleasant situation at all." Brutlag
said.
University General Counsel
Michael Roster noted, however,
that e-mails are presumed to be re
lated to University business and
therefore are entitled to University
access.
That is, Stanford cannot guaran
tee e-mail privacy because person
al e-mails are "purely incidental"
to its business.
Although they may not consti
tute a guarantee, the University
does have a number of helpful pre
vention methods and recommen
dations to increase privacy.
To prevent breaches like the
one in the Durand Building, the
Leland system now uses "Ker
beros," a security system that pre
vents packet sniffers by encrypting
login IDs and passwords that trav
el over the Internet. Unfortunate
ly. Kerberos only encrypts the ID
and password.

As for prevention [of
e-mail privacy breaches],
the first line of defense is
a good password.'

The text of the e-mail can still he
intercepted, according to Sweet
Hall consultant Adam Seishas, a
junior.
"Most of these attacks are prob
ably coming from somewhere off
campus." Seishas said.
More sophisticated encryption
programs can protect the text of e
mail messages, but they are often
less than intuitive, usually work
only with certain e-mail clients like
Eudora, and require both the
sender and receiver to have special
software installed, according to
Seishas.
Brutlag noted that these "public

key encryption programs are a
significant advance in computer
privacy. "It will allow us, for the
first time, to send confidential in
formation over the Internet with
the assurance that it is sent by the
person who encrypted it,"he said.
In another e-mail privacy twist,
you might be surprised to learn
thiit even when you hit "delete" in
a University e-mail program, the
message is not deleted.
Instead, the University main
tains all e-mail messages on backup
disks for one year as a safeguard
against system crashes and to satis
fy certain record-keeping obliga
tions.
Although system administra
tors have access to these disks and
are not required to show cause in
order to do so, these administra
tors only retrieve old messages if
there is strong evidence of a viola
tion of the Computer and Network
Usage Policy, Brutlag said.
Old e-mails could also be the
subject of a subpoena directed at
the University, but Roster said that
e-mail privacy in this context has
"not been a big issue."
Acceording to Roster, at the
same time, new software is being
developed to read even backup
tapes that have been erased and
could be used when old tapes are
the subject of litigation.
In Stanford's case, old e-mails
are most commonly accessed at the
request of the user. But recovery of
old e-mail messages is not easily
done, according to Stephen
Hansen, Computer Security Offi
cer.
"Recovering a given file from a
backup tape is not a trivial task,"
Hansen said. "The Leland system
alone backs up hundreds of giga
bytes of data every night. Recovery
of a single file can take days or even
weeks."
Still, if you have a Leland e-mail
account and you're uncomfortable
with marked-for-deletion e-mails
being maintained by the Universi
ty. Brutlag has a tip:
" The Leland backups are made
in the earlv morning hours. If you

set Eudora to read your mailbox
every midnight and also ask Eudo
ra to delete messages from the
server, then no copies of the mes
sages will exist on the Leland sys
tem during the backup," he said.
Brutlag warned, however, that
this strategy requires users to back
up message files themselves.

'It is a felony under
California law to break into
a computer account and to
copy or read another's files,
e-mail or not.'
— Douglas Brutlag

"If you lose any mail — like los
ing the Eudora folder on your hard
drive — there will be nothing that
the Leland people will be able to
do to get your mail back for you,"
he said.
With his own e-mail account,
Brutlag employs the opposite strat
egy:
To ensure his messages are
backed up, he programs Eudora to
keep his e-mails on the server for
24 hours.
"As for prevention [of e-mail
privacy breaches]," Seishas said,
"the first line of defense is a good
password."
The Sweet Hall staff recom
mends choosing a password that is
at least eight characters long, is not
based on a dictionary word and
contains at least one non-lower
case letter, such as a number, up
percase letter or a punctuation
mark.
Passwords should never be
shared, and they should be re
placed periodically.
A poster in one campus com
puter lab reads, "Passwords are
like underwear. Change yours
often."
According to Brutlag, the most
common instance of people read
ing others' mail occurs when peo
ple walk away from a computer.
So remember to log off your
next e-mail session in Meyer.
