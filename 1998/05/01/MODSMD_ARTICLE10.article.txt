## Clinton associate hears from Whitewater prosecutors Hubbell charged with tax evasion 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Strik
ing a second time at President Clin
ton's friend, Whitewater prosecu
tors charged Webster Hubbell, his
wife and two associates yesterday
with conspiring to avoid taxes on
hundreds of thousands of dollars in
payments Hubbell received from
Clinton political supporters.
The 10-count indictment said
that after a March IW4 meeting at
the White House concerning
Hubbell's impending resignation as
associate attorney general, "one or
more individuals suggested that
efforts be taken to assist" Hubbell
"in obtaining work."
But Hubbell. who then was first
coming under criminal investiga
tion, "performed little or no work"
for the consulting fees he received
from friends and political support
ers of Clinton, the prosecutors
alleged.
High-level Clinton administra
tion officials have acknowledged
seeking clients and consulting work
for Hubbell.
The indictment alleges that
Hubbell and his wife Suzy. who fol
lowed the Clintons from Arkansas
to Washington to work in the
administration, owe the govern
ment more than $S94.(KK) in back
taxes and penalties.
The new indictment was
returned 14 months after Hubbell. a
golfing buddy of the president and
former law partner of Hillary Rod
ham Clinton, was released from

prison after serving 21 months on
charges he defrauded the Arkansas
law firm where he and the first lady
used to work.
The White House said in a state
ment late yesterday that "the presi
dent and first lady are very sad
dened by the developments in this
matter and feel bad for Webb and
Suzy Hubbell" and the others
named in the indictment.
The grand jury's indictment was
the second setback for Clinton and
his supporters in two days. On
Wednesday, it was learned that a
judge had rejected former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky's
claim that she had been given full
immunity from prosecution, giving
Whitewater Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr new leverage to
compel her testimony before a
grand jury.
Hubbell's attorney, John Nields,
decried the indictment as excessive
and said average Americans would
never have been charged in such a
case.
He accused Starr of punishing
Hubbell because Starr's staff was
unhappy with his cooperation with
the investigation.
The indictment accuses the
Hubbells, accountant Michael C.
Schaufele of Little Rock. Ark., and
Little Rock tax lawyer Charles C.
Owen of conspiracy, tax evasion,
impeding and impairing the Inter
nal Revenue Service and mail
fraud.
