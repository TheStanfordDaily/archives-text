# NATO to welcome new members
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate
rejected efforts to block or slow the
expansion of NATO into the former Sovi
et bloc yesterday, opening the way for
expected ratification of the first enlarge
ment of the Western alliance since the
end of the Cold War.
In advance of a final vote. President
Clinton said the addition of Poland. Hun
gary and the Czech Republic — with
more to come — would bring the world
"closer than ever to realizing the dream of
a generation: a Europe that is united,
democratic and secure."
Senate leaders hoped for a final ratifi
cation vote later yesterday, but a half
dozen amendments were still pending late
in the afternoon.
Still, ratification seemed assured after
the Senate rejected, 59-41, what support
ers viewed as the most serious of all
weakening amendments: a proposal by
Sen. John Warner. R-Va„ for a three-year
moratorium on further additions.
Previously, the Senate rejected. 83-17.

a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moyni
han. D-N.Y to bar NATO membership
to nations that are not first memllljrs of
the i5-member European Union.
None of the three proposed new
NATO members are.
And it turned back. 80-20, an amend
ment by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. that
would have required Clinton to get specif
ic approval from Congress to keep U.S.
troops in Bosnia — or bring them home
— before the NATO expansion could
proceed.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion. created in 1949 to confront the Sovi
et Union in Europe, currently has 16
members.
Last July, it invited Poland. Hungary
and the Czech Republic to join in the first
wave of expansion. However, nearly a
dozen other nations have asked to join.
Clinton and congressional supporters
called the proposed expansion the natural
next step after the end of the Cold War.
But opponents complained about

potential hidden costs and said it would
further isokite< Russia and lead to more
' initanglin/military commitments.
Clinton, in a nationally broadcast news
conference from the White House, hailed
the anticipated ratification — which he
had made a key foreign policy priority —
and praised the Senate for a "model of
bipartisan action."
But on a separate foreign policy issue.
Clinton complained about the lack of
progress on his requests to Congress for
$18 billion for the International Monetary
Fund.
He believes the money is needed
because of the Asian financial crisis, and
for $1 billion in delinquent dues to the
United Nations.
"I call on Congress to step up to its
responsibility," Clinton said.
Although there was little doubt about
the final outcome, yesterday's debate was
lively and often emotional, with oppo
nents suggesting the move could lead to
dire consequences.
