# Clinton holds full press conference

### 
WASHINGTON (AF) — With controlled anger. President Clinton
questioned the conduct of Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr yesterday
and dismissed Republican challenges to his own character as "high level
static." He doggedly refused to talk about Monica Lewinsky.
Clinton, at his first full news conference since mid-December, was more
upbeat in proclaiming an "American economic renaissance" with low
inflation and unemployment and rising wages. He said he hoped the stock
market could avoid big swings but added, "I'd rather it be going up than
down in any big sense."
Composed but combative, the president spent nearly an hour in the
East Room answering questions that returned again and again to the
Lewinsky matter, Starr's investigations and Republican criticism.
Clinton said it should be obvious to all Americans that he is the target
of "a hard, well-financed, vigorous effort" to undermine him through per
sonal attacks. "It's been part of a strategy that goes all the way back to
1991," he said. "It used to distress me greatly. It doesn't any more."
Clinton curtly replied, "I have nothing else to say," when asked to
explain his relationship with Lewinsky, the former White House intern
with whom he has been alleged to have had an affair. He said he had
answered the underlying questions when earlier this year he denied having
a sexual relationship or undertaking a coverup.
Asked if he believed Starr was out to get him. Clinton said pointedly. "I
think modestly observant people are fully capable of drawing their own
conclusions."
Clinton's staff and allies have portrayed Starr as an extremist who
intimidates witnesses and is bent on destroying the president. While refus
ing to go that far. Clinton left no doubts about his feelings.
"If there's one person in the world I'm not responsible for. it's Mr.
Starr." Clinton said.
Asked if he might ask Attorney General Janet Reno to remove Starr.
Clinton said. " That would not be an appropriate thing for me to do."
The president said he was willing, if necessary , to spend the rest of his
term with the Lewinsky matter unresolved.
"Absolutely." Clinton said. He acknowledged that "these things are dis
tracting."
Speaking of his critics, Clinton said. "They can affect my reputation.
Thev can do nothing, for good or ill. to affect my character. Unfortunate
ly. they can't make it any better either. They can't make it any better. They
can't make it anv worse. They can't have an impact on it."
