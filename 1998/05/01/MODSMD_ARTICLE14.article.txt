Impotence pill for women
NEW YORK (AP) — For nearly a month. Viagra has helped hundreds of thousands of
American men satisfy long-frustrated libidos. Now it may be women's turn.
Already, a Boston University study is examining whether the new impotence pill for
men might restore lost sex lives for women who take it. And the drug's manufacturer. New
York-based Pfizer Inc.. is doing early tests of V iagra involving 500 women in England.
Researchers believe that just as prostate surgery and diabetes can lead to impotence in
men. hysterectomies and high cholesterol and age can interfere with blood flow in women,
giving them a numb sensation during sex and making it hard for them to be stimulated.

strikes and the self-immolation of a Tibetan activist, who died Wednesday in New Delhi.

mination" of the activist. Thupten Ngodup. But he also feared that "if such determination
and emotion is turned around, there is a danger of true violence."

the Dalai Lama repeated his call for autonomy in Tibet rather than full political indepen
dence. and expressed disappointment that such declarations had brought no response from
Beijing.
