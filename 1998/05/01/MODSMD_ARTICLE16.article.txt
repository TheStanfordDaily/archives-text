## Notebook Getting The Daily dose 
### 
Commitment is inspired by
the existence of a 'true'
Stanford community

Recently many of my
friends and dormmates have
been asking why 1 spend such
a significant portion of my waking
hours at The Daily.
And as I try to explain why. I've
realized that there is no easy answer to
such a basic question.
Part of why this is hard to pinpoint
is because I'm not satisfied with the
-• m »
obvious answers. I don't spend my*
evenings at The Daily simply because
it is part of the job description of a
managing editor or because we occa
sionally get subsidized take-out Chi
nese food.
And although I'm conscious that
someday the work that all of us do will
become part of the University's histor
ical record, that isn't a compelling
enough explanation, either.
What I do know is that I am here in
large measure because of the sense of
community that is fostered as a staff of
about 30 editors and several hundred
writers, photographers, and artists
work together to produce a paper to
serve the Stanford community.
But what is community?
Last quarter. 1 took a seminar in the
History Department on "Imperialism,
Colonialism, and National Identity in
Modern Japan." One of the texts for
the course was Benedict Anderson's
widely acclaimed book, "Imagined
Communities." I"he central premise of
Anderson's work is that communities
are created in modern nation-states
through shared rituals.

One unifying ritual that Anderson
cites is reading the morning newspa
per. Anderson suggests that as Amer
icans from Minneapolis to Sarasota
and from Boston to San Diego peruse
The New York Times, they come to
share an imagined community
through engagement and connection
with the issues that appear on the
paper's front page. In other words,
newspapers in some fashion fabricate
the way we see the world and our
sense of community.
As my eyes moved across the page
of Anderson's book, I felt the onset of
a mini existential crisis. Incredulously,
I , questioned whether I'm spending
Ifbfcblo *0 hours a week engaged in
creating an imagined community — a
fiction that enables Daily readers to
feel a connection to Stanford.
It was at that moment that I first
identified why I spend so much time at
The Daily.
I spend time at The Daily because I
believe that the work that all of us at
The Daily do is real and that we are
part of real community. Members of
the campus community don't feel
committed to addressing issues such as
the housing crunch or gender and
racial inequities in tenure because The
Daily tells them that these are issues to
be concerned about.
Rather, The Daily reflects the pre
existing commitment that scholars,
students, athletes and artists have to
solving these issues for the betterment
of our community.
The Daily doesn't make the com
munity, it grows from the impulse that
the University community provides.
I'm proud to be part of the Stanford
community and Hie Daily community.
That's why I'm here.
