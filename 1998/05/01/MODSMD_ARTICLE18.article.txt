## Service vehicles, park this 
### 
STANFORD IS the
second largest uni
versity landowner
in the world, next to
Moscow State University.
But when you look at all
of the space that we
waste, we might as well
be the smallest.

What is the biggest waste of space? It's
not the vacant Frost Amphitheater or
even our emaciated Lake Lagunita. The
service vehicle parking spaces are the
biggest waste of land. There are so many
of them, and they are always empty. Is
there any service that is so urgently need
ed that the service vehicles don't have
time to find a spot like the rest of us?
In front of Lagunita Court there are at
least seven service vehicle parking spaces.
Please explain to me when Lag is going to
simultaneously need seven service vehi
cles attending to it. How many service
vehicles does it take to change a light
bulb? Count the damn spaces and get back
to me.
What is even more disturbing than the
spaces being consistently empty is that the
service vehicles park wherever they please
inside the inner campus. Next time you go
to class, however distant in the future that
may be, take some time to notice just how
many white vans litter the space between

Stanford's academic facilities. Aside from
construction, what service are these vehi
cles performing other than getting in my
way and turning the campus into a used
white van lot?
The University claims that building
more student parking damages Stanford's
aesthetic character. And to some extent, I
agree. 1 do not want to go to school at a
car lot. However, the way the University
has allowed service vehicles to park wher
ever their engines stop running is perhaps
the single ugliest thing I can identify. How
about opening up the middle of the Quad
to service vehicle parking? 1 think I saw an
empty pew in Memorial Church; let's ram
a white van in there.
The spaces have been allocated; now
use them, you menacing service vehicles.
Use them, or paint every square inch of
asphalt on this campus white with red
stripes, and put up signs that say service
vehicle parking. Use them, or let students
park in the middle of White Plaza too. Use
them, or pay our parking tickets.
To complicate matters, "service vehi
cle" is such a vague term. When I drive,
my vehicle is servicing me. When the vehi
cle breaks, I service it. When Stanford stu
dents are alone, many times they service
themselves. I think the list of service vehi
cle models is endless.
The spaces serve no other function

other than actingas bait for disgruntled
students trying to park. They sit there
gleaming in the night, gently whispering
into your open car window, "Park in me. I
haven't been parked in for years." After
you've circled the streets and surrounding
residence lots three times and have not
sighted open parking spaces, who could
resist?
I am convinced the University has a
huge under-the-table contract with the
Santa Clara Police Department. We pro
vide the irresistible spaces and Santa Clara
can have the parking ticket revenues.
You don't have to own a car to be out
raged by service vehicles. I don't. The vans
chase me around campus while I attempt
to get to class. Sometimes I feel they are
personally after me. Maybe the services
these vans perform are more sinister than
we have ever imagined. I have always
been concerned that these white vans are
a one tinted, star-shaped window away
from being the same vans child molesters
drive. Once I thought I heard one of the
drivers ask me to come help him look for
his dog.
I ask the University to do the students
a service — use the service vehicle spaces,
or hand them over.
