Stanford students today sleep out in the
rain in order to learn how to dance
the swing. But this would not have
been the case 62 years ago. In fact, Stanford
students preferred listening and dancing to
slow jams rather than shaking it to swing's
energizing beats.
According to a 1936 Stanford Daily sur
vey, students listed tear-jerking tunes such
as "Temptation" and"The Very Thought
of You," on their list of favorite songs. Fifty
men and 30 women were given lists of the
Top 4<) hits published from 1933-35 and
were asked to rate the most popular songs.
"Carioca," one of the most popular
songs at the time, received few votes.
"Sophisticated Lady" nosed out "The Very
Thought of You" by one vote for the 1934
favorite. The men, however, chose "Smoke
Gets in Your Eyes" before either of them.
The men and women still couldn't agree
on the best song of 1935. "Alone" was far

ahead with the men but few women chose
it. Instead, most women checked "Please
Believe Me." The few swing addicts
explained the dearth of "hot and fast" win
ners by saying that their favorites were not
so much particular stings but rather the
orchestrations of particular orchestras.
Although rap and techno may be main
stream at today's fraternity parties, we have
not necessarily strayed from our roots.
Judging from the frequency that Celine
Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" echoes
through dorm hallways, students still appre
ciate the slow and sentimental stuff.
