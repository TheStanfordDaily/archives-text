# Get naked at last Exotic
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Senior staff writer 
A 36-year tradition of nudity
and lasciviousness is ending to
morrow night — Alpha Sigma will
host its last Exotic Erotic Ball.
Noted by both Rolling Stone
and the Los Angeles Times for its
infamous exhibitionism. Exotic
Erotic is one of the largest parties
on campus.
"Everyone sees it their own
way," said house financial manag
er Kim Coffey, a junior. "It's a
combination of freedom and de
bauchery.
"The real philosophical ques
tion is 'Is it sketchier to be naked,
or sketchier to be clothed among a
lot of naked people?' "
Sophomore Mack Cole-Edel
sack agreed. "But how naked is
naked?" he asked.
Partvgoers wear everything

or nothing. Women often go in
hras and underwear; tor men,
boxers and are the norm.
"But creativity is strongly en
couraged." Coffey said. She fond
ly remembered an Alpha Sig resi
dent who wore nothing but a
table, held on by suspenders, and

a beer glass with a sign that read
■'I'll drink you under the table."
Junior Steve Kessler, also a
resident, said his favorite costume
involved three latex gloves. The
man "had two on his hands and

Another infamous costume is
the Swamp Woman, who, accord
ing to resident Alex Kulungowski,
a senior, attends Exotic Erotic each
year completely naked, painted en
tirely with greenish-brown paint.
"It's like she came out of a cryo
genics freezer in EBF," Kulun
gowski said.

The real philosophical
question is: Is it
to be naked, or sketchier
to be clothed among a lot
of naked people?'

Because the house Alpha Sigma
will become the Delta Delta Delta
sorority house next fall, this year's
Exotic Erotic is being touted as the
last.
Tyson Mac Donald, a senior who
was house manager of Alpha Sig
two years ago. said there was "def
initely a hope" that another house
would continue the tradition. This
Exotic Erotic will be Macdonald's
fifth; he attended the party as a pro
fro in 1994.
Mac Donald said that the popu
larity of the party has sometimes
wavered.
In 1991 and 1992, several ar
rests, most of whom were non-
Stanford students, occurred at the
party, and the University put
Alpha Sig on temporary social pro
bation. Afterward, for a few vears.

Exotic Erotic was less popular, an
event with "about 10 guys to one
girl," Mac Donald said.
But three years ago, popularity
returned, and the event now at
tracts between 4(X) and S(X) people
Exotic Erotic began in 1962 as
the "Pimp and Prostitute Party,"
hosted by Alpha Sig as a fraternity,
but the name changed to Exotic
Erotic in 1972, according to Chris
Pandolfo, Class of '97, who was
house manager in 1995.
Alpha Sig is known for its
raunchy character, so Exotic Erot
ic's style is no surprise. "It's white
trash," junior Owen Brizgys told
The Daily earlier.
"It has a 'Raising Arizona'
meets 'Drugstore Cowboy' kind of
feel."
This year, the house staff is plan
ning exorbitant decorations, in
cluding a "Bouncy Castle" and pos
sibly a pudding pool.
"Just imagine it — bouncing
naked people!" Cole-Edelsack
said.
There will also be a searchlight,
inflatable dolls and, according to
Coffey, the entry is an opening be
tween two enormous legs. "It will
be like the opposite of giving
birth," Coffey said.

But how naked is naked?'
— Mack Cole-Edelsack

"It's a crazy time," Kulungowski
said. "Even our cook comes. He
dresses in leather and everything."
Exotic Erotic starts at 10 p.m.
tomorrow and is open to all Stan
ford students.
