# Only human
## Jocelyn Wiener Childhood deceptions: eggs, RVs and the CIA 
### 
SOME BABIES ARE born with long
skinny bodies, pigeon toes, pointy
heads and jaundice. These babies'
fathers, in shock from perceived genetic
mutation, often nickname their children
"Chicken." In my particular case, I think
my dad was projecting his childhood frus
trations with the nickname "Brucie
Goosie." "Chicken" I was — so much so
that by age 5, I identified as being half
human, half-fowl. Therefore, it took no
difficulty for my beloved babysitter
Maryann and her boyfriend Dennis to
convince their small poultry protege that I
was the only human being on earth capa
ble of laying a chicken egg.
With sincere, smiling eyes and master
ful legerdemain, Dennis waved his hand
over my waddling behind and produced
my second-favorite breakfast food.
"You laid this egg," he announced to
me in absolute astonishment. "You are a
chicken, and chickens lay eggs." He
deposited it in my carefully cupped hand
for wide-eyed scrutiny. With solemn
delight, I wrapped it in toilet paper and

placed it on the second shelf of the refrig
erator to show my parents.
The intellectual prowess of the average
child is sufficient to refute the notion of
human beings laying chicken eggs. It took
me longer, but by age 1/, I was fairly cer
tain that no human being is biologically
designed with the capacity for the produc
tion of chicken eggs. ( That task, as we all
know, belongs to oversized talking rab
bits.)
I am not sure what urge is sated with
the successful deception of 5-year-olds.
Yet I know that it is a fairly prevalent one.
The fact that human beings, if offered no
alternative, will accept lies instead of
truths is one of the great tragedies decried
by the prophets of the 20th century. These
prophets point to the horrors of Nazi pro
paganda rallies, pencil-thin supermodels
and countless psychological studies. They
wring their hands at the synchronized
immorality of humankind. They fail to
realize that deception can be fun.
Take, as a benign example, the setup of
a spanking new Web site designed deliber

ately to deceive children:
http://www.odci.gov/cia/ciakids. This user
friendly site is the first introduction most
small children have to covert intelligence.
It explains the concept: "There is informa
tion that other countries will not share
with the United States, called secrets. All
this information is very important to our
nation's leaders."
The CIA is fairly clever in helping the
under-10 crowd join the rest of us in ignor
ing its historical human rights abuses. So
parents needn't worry about their children
viewing animated government upheavals.
But there is plenty else for kids to do.
They can "try on a disguise" using a smil
ing black woman as representative of the
average CIA member. She can wear a
polka dot dress, a trenchcoat, scuba gear,
anything.
Coincidentally, half of the site is geared
toward puppy dog lovers. The user can lis
ten to "Bo" of the CIA canine corps as he
cheerfully barks his love for sniffing out
drugs and leftist fugitives.
Why does the CIA bother with kids?

Maybe it feels the need to prove that it is
spending its $29 billion annual budget on
significant programs. Not even us dumb
Americans, once grown, can easily digest
the notion that people join the CIA
because they "like to travel and have a
great curiosity about the world and its dif
ferent cultures." Plus, when children
believe things at age 5, they don't question
them so much when they grow up.
Not all lies are told with the objective of
gleeful deception. My cousin recently
pointed out that his father raised him and
his two sisters with the understanding that
a banana is, in fact, a nut.
This may seem empirically correct:
Both are uniformly whitish inside, have
"shells," grow on trees and sit in decora
tive wooden bowls on the kitchen table.
This is not deliberate deception, but sin
cere misrepresentation.
Perhaps this is also the case with the
CIA kids Web site. It is plausible that the
CIA really believes it is an organization
which works with "personal and organiza
tional integrity" bv "adapting to both a

changing world environment and evolving
customer needs." Add "in Guatemala" to
the end of every statement for an added
twist. Perhaps the CIA likes to deceive
children for the sheer humor of it.
Yes, fooling kids is funny. Just ask my
Dad. One morning. 15 years ago, my
brothers and I pressed our faces up against
the front window to see an old RV parked
in our driveway (given to him. as it turns
out. to settle a debt).
"Daddy! Daddy! Where did that come
from?!?"
He grinned down at us. "It grew from a
magic seed."
With mouths agape we stared at him.
then tumbled off with a story that would
outshine classmates who only had snake
epidermises and Care Hear stickers for
show and tell.
The CIA is off to a good start. Once
they bribe Santa and kidnap the tooth
fairv. America will be set.
