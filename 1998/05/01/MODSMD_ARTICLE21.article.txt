From housing changes to tuition
increases, Stanford students are
often heard complaining that they
have too little say in University deci
sions.
The best way to change that, ac
cording to ASSU Nominations
Commission Chair Lisa Liao, is to
serve on a University committee.
Today is the last day to apply for
those committees via the commis
sion's World Wide Web site at
http://www.stanford.edu/dept/OvSA
/nomcom/nomcomapp.lft.
The committees offer students a
voice while decisions are being con
sidered, Liao said, on issues such as
housing, parking and transporta
tion, land and buildings, teaching
curriculum, telecommunications,
academic computing and much
more.

Committees "are the place that
students can give their input and be
heard on the policy-making level,"
said Liao, a junior.
"These committees address im
portant issues that affect the stu
dents' daily lives. The committees
are comprised of faculty, students
and administrators, so this is where
all aspects of the University can get
together and discuss iese issues."
Last year, accoiuing to Liao,
there was a slight increase in the
number of students applying for
committee positions.
The Nominations Commission
hopes the trend will continue into
next year.
Alane Murdock, a doctoral stu
dent in neuroscience, served on the
Graduate Housing Advising Com
mittee, the Judicial Board and the
Committee on Graduate Studies
this year.
It is "really important for stu

dents to get involved," Murdock
said, 'it is fundamentally important
to be involved in your community."
Any registered Stanford student
can apply for a committee position.
Because committee members are
representing the entire student
body, the Nominations Commission
looks for ;i diverse array of students
to serve, Liao said.
The commission also expects that
students will have enthusiasm and a
background in the issues that will be
discussed on the committees for
which they apply.
According to Liao, successful ap
plicants also have leadership abili
ties, self-initiative, creativity, will
ingness to learn and a broad mind.
Time commitments vary from
committee to committee, but gener
ally students the commission ac
cepts are expected to attend com
mittee meetings two or three times a
quarter.
