# Draw rush clogs Axess

### Nicoli Richardson 
Student procrastination caused undue stress for
Stanford administrators late Wednesday night when a
large percentage of the Stanford undergraduate popu
lation waited to the last minute to register for the
spring housing lottery.
The deadline to register a Draw group for under
graduate or graduate housing was 11:59 p.m. Wednes
day.
Consequently, the online registration site, Axess,
reached its maximum capacity of users and would not
let others onto the system, leaving many students with
out a Draw group as the clock turned to midnight.
Freshman David Kroodsma had trouble registering
with Axess on Wednesday night, after all of his Draw
mates had already registered. Kroodsma said the sys
tem took a long time to load and sent him error mes
sages.
Housing Assignment Services Manager Kathleen
Bransfield said her office took applications yesterday
for people who ran into the electronic traffic jam. Their
applications will be processed by hand, allowing Draw
groups to form as planned, she said.

Students who did not register yesterday at Housing
Assignment Services are out of luck, as Draw numbers
were released today. All students who are not regis
tered with a Draw group must now register alone,
Bransfield said.
The Axess backup marks the first snag in the new
Draw system, which set an earlier deadline for regis
tration of Draw groups but allows the groups to change
their choices after they receive a number.
According to Bransfield, a computerized system as
signed Draw numbers as soon as each group applied
online, but the numbers were withheld until today in
order to avoid last-minute shifts in Draw group mem
bership based on assignments.
Housing assignments will be released May 23; stu
dents must respond to the assignment by May 31.
Despite the problem, Bransfield said she thought
use of Axess on the World Wide Web was an efficient
way to use the database.
Last year. Housing Assignment Services filled 9.2(H)
spaces; more people always apply than there are
spaces available. Bransfield said she hopes the new
system will lead to fewer errors and more accommoda
tions.
