## Devils look to shoot down Card Six-Pac lead at stake this weekend as Arizona State visits Sunken 
### Brian Eule Staff writer 
With two of the biggest series of the sea
son coming up for the No. 1 Cardinal (37-8-
l, 18-6 Pacific-10 Conference Southern Di
vision), Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess looks as calm as ever.
Maybe it is because he has the experience
of almost 22 seasons as a skipper, including
two national championships. Or maybe it is
due to the fact that his team has remained at
the top spot in several national polls during
the entire season.
Or, quite possibly, it has something to do
with being in almost the exact same situation
last year.
"It doesn't happen that often that [the di
vision title] comes down to the last weekend,
but it will this year," said Marquess, whose
Cardinal faces the N0.13 Arizona State Sun
Devils (33-17, 18-8) this weekend and No. 6
USC next weekend. "It will be a great test
[for the post-season] because we are playing
two good teams. If we don't play real well in
all phases, we are going to get beat."
Marquess knows not to take any confer
ence lead for granted — especially after last
season, when the division title came down to
the last game, in which Stanford beat UCLA
9-6.
Leading USC by half a game and the Sun

Devils by only one game, a had series this
weekend could be big trouble for the Cardi
nal.
"These are games we need to win," said
freshman designated hitter Joe Borehard.
"We are in the driver's seat right now."

Arizona State, which will most likely
match Ryan Mills (6-3) against junior Jeff
Austin (10-2) in tonight's 7 p.m. series open
er, is no stranger to playing the spoiler.
Handing the Cardinal its first loss earlier in
the season, the Sun Devils have multiple
motives for winning this series.
This series is "huge," Marquess said.
"They feel they have a good chance to host
regionals."
Should Arizona State win the Southern
Division title, the team would have a greater
chance of denying the Cardinal the chance
to host its third consecutive Western Re

gional Championship.
The division title, however, will not he
easy to obtain. In the event of a tie. head-to
head competition would he the first tie
breaker, followed hy a one-game playoff if
necessary.
"We're not going to worry ahout that,
though, until next week." Marquess said.
Even with sophomore first baseman John
Gall leading the Cardinal offense with his
.396 batting average and 54 RBI, and junior
center fielder Jody Gerut not far behind
with a ,339 average, 15 home runs and 51
RBI, the hitting has been streaky at times
for Stanford.
Marquess, however, chooses to focus on
being consistent in terms of pitching and de
fense.
"Fortunately, over the long season, we
have been real consistent." he said. "Last
weekend was as poorly as we have swung the
bats all year, but we were still able to win
two games. You hope you can have that con
sistent pitching and defense."
While Stanford may feel down having
dropped another game to unranked Cal with
the 10-2 loss last Saturday, the Sun Devils
have had similar problems recently. Flaying
very well for the majority of this season. Ari
