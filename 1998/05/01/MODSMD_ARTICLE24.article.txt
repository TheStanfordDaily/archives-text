WOMEN'S RUGBY
â–  Saturday: Women's Rugby Final
Four at Penn State. Stanford vs.
Dartmouth.

Last year, the women's rugby
team's first trip to the Final Four
yielded a third-place finish. This
year, the team has returned for a
second hid for the national title at
I'enn State, where it will face Dart
mouth in the semifinal round.
A first look at the Stanford
women's rugby team may I de
ceiving. Compared to its competi
tors, the Cardinal lacks size . But
what the Card lacks in size, it com
pensates for in quickness and skill.
So far this season, Stanford is un
defeated. The team dominated the
regional tournament by defeating
Reed and shutting out Central Col

lege in a 54-0 blowout. There has
only been one American team this
year that has been able to even get
on the scoreboard against the Card.
The Final Four will present Stan
lord with new competition from the
East Coast, where rugby is an older
and more traditionally established
sport. The sport has been spreading
on the West Coast only recently
under the Card's lead.
Stanford's strength lies in its
quickness and group game. The for
wards have held their own against
bigger competitors with strong
tackling and quick ball movement.
Of the 15 starters on this year's
team, six are rookies. Despite the
turnover. Stanford operates with
smooth group play.
The Card's spread out running
game utilizes all of its strengths and
has been consistent all season. De
fensively. Stanford is as solid as any
other competitor in the nation.
The only drawbacks to the Car
dinal game have hopefully been re
moved during spring practice. The
backs have been focusing their of
fensive game; learning when to pass
and when to run the ball. The for
wards have been perfecting lincouts
and solid defense on the fringes.
In order to compensate in tack
ling. where size does become a fac
tor, the Stanford women tackle low

and strong to take their opponents
to the ground.
All of these factors will come
into play against Dartmouth. Dart
mouth is relatively similar to Stan
ford in size and playing style. The
match should be a great game with
both teams competing at a similar
caliber of competition.
The last time the Card faced the
Big Green two years ago. the match
resulted in a tie. Stanford was com
peting during the middle tit its finals
week with only six of its 15 starters.
Since then, Stanford has improved
substantially, but so has Dart
mouth.
For the Cardinal to win. it must
not only utilize all of the team's
strengths consistently, but also must
be ready to adapt and respond to
any style of play. The East Coast
teams that the Card will face play
with a different style, and the Card
has not faced any of their Final Four
opponents yet this season.
Should Stanford defeat Dart
mouth. it will face either North Car
olina or Illinois in the final.
"We are a thinking team, op
posed to one solely based on si/e.
The Eagles national team has been
around giving us pointers during
our practices. We know what to ex
pect and we are ready to win." said
junior Rose Staudifer.
