■ Saturday: Stanford at California in
the l()sth Big Meet, 1 (>:3() a.m.

Stanford's men and women,
ranked 10th and 2()th. respectively,
will have to use all of their weapons
to repeat last year's successes at the
Big Meet. This year, however, they
will have to do so without the home
track advantage.
In last year's fiercely competitive
dual meet, the Cardinal women
won convincingly with a final talk
of 84-70, while the men put down a
late Cal rally to win 85-78. snapping
a 25-year losing streak to the Bears.
Cal's men lead the historic series 59-
42-3. while the shorter women's se
ries is tied at nine wins apiece.
While Cal lacks the superstar
quality that Stanford enjoys, it is the
team's depth in the jumps and

sprints that should keep it in con
tention. Stanford's unsurpassed dis
tance specialists and high-powered
throwing units will do their best to
offset any advantage Cal may take.
According to head coach Vin
Lananna. the Cardinal will be
throwing all the artillery it has at the
Cal contingent.
"Everyone is going to compete
in this meet." said Lananna. whose
teams have been divided among
several venues for the past few
weeks.
The dual meet, which is by man\
considered to be the purest form of
track-and-field competition, pits
only two teams against each other in
an event-by-event showdown. This
will be a change of pace for both
teams, who have spent most of the
season participating in large tnvita
tionals and relay meets.
'The dual meet is a great thing
for American track and field, espe
cially in our crosstown rivalry with
Cal." Lananna said, it gives you a
definite winner and a loser."
The meet will be scored with five
points for a first, three for a second
and one point for a third-place fin
ish in the individual events. In the
relays, the winning team will be
