Sophomore catcher Kellie Wiginton lays down a successful bunt in the Card's Feb. 15 matchup with Cal
State-Northridge. Tomorrow, the Card will face two tough pitchers from Arizona State before coming up
against the red-hot Arizona Wildcats on Sunday.
Tsosie sports a 20-7 record and a
1.27 ERA with six shutouts and 115
strikeouts for the season.
Breedlove has thrown two no-hit
ters already this season, along with
10 shutouts. She currently has a 1.69
ERA and 134 strikeouts for the sea
son. and has earned USA
Today / NFCA National Player of
the Week honors and Pac-10 Pitch
er of the Week twice this season.
"Last time we played Arizona
State, both games were one-run
pitcher's duels." said Stanford head
coach John Rittman. "We expect
this weekend will be similar."
If Stanford's consistently solid
pitching continues this weekend.
Rittman's prediction will probably
become reality . In order to sweep
the Sun Devils, however, Stanford
will need to get the job done at the
plate.
After a midseason slump at the
plate two weeks ago. Stanford bats
appear re-energized. Crouch and
junior slugger Michelle Schneider,
the three and four batters in the bat
ting order, look to have regained
their early-season form at the plate.
After battling with Arizona
State, Stanford gets the chance to
take a hack at an Arizona team that
has been virtually unbeatable this
season.
The Wildcats have only three
losses total, only one of those com
ing against a Pac-10 team.

"Any time you play Arizona,
you're going to have to play a per
fect game if you want to win,"
Rittman said. "However. v\e know
we can beat anyone in the nation if
we execute and plav our game."
Unfortunately for Stanford. Ari
zona has no weaknesses, \tohilc
every lineup in the country only has
nine batters. Arizona has 11 players
batting over .300 and five batting
over .400. The team is currently bat
ting a sizzling .394.
The team is led by senior center
fielder Alison McCutcheon. who
has been getting a hit nearly one out
of every two times she steps to the
plate for a .472 batting average. Just
last week, she was named the Na
tional Fastpitch Coaches Associa
tion Player of the Week for her per
formance at the plate, which includ
ed a 10-18 showing (.556).
On the mound, the Wildcats
have senior Nancy Evans, who
boasts a 2b-1 record and a 1.22
ERA with 201 strikeouts this sea
son E\ans currently has the highest
winning percentage in NCAA his
tory at .950 (114-6).
Freshman Becky Lemke rounds
out the pitching staff with some im
pressive numbers of her own. She
has a record with a 2.08 ERA
and 130 strikeouts for the season.
"Sweeping Washington gave us
a lot of momentum going into this
weekend." said junior outfielder
Kelly Yablonski. "If we can just
play solid defense and score some
runs, we can beat Arizona and build
on that momentum."
