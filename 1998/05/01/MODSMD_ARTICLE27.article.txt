# Under the sea: see sights with scuba
## 
### Sage Cooke 
Imagine being weightless, sub
merged in the water in complete
darkness. Moonlight filters
through the surface far overhead,
and singing whales can be heard in
the distance. With each movement,
tiny phosphorescent plankton glow
in the darkness. Breath comes eas
ily from a small plastic piece in your
mouth, even though you are far
from the surface.
This was the "surreal" experi
ence of junior Ted Callahan when
he went on his first night scuba dive
in Maui, Hawaii. "It was like learn
ing to dive all over again" because
of the darkness, he said.

Although his night dive in Maui
was particularly memorable, Calla
han has had many other exciting
dives. He has explored underwater
lava caves in Maui, where he was
about 5 feet away from white
tipped reef sharks. Callahan and
his companions had to line up cau
tiously on one side of the cave, as
the surge pushed them toward the
sharks.
Even though many inexperi
enced divers often worry about
sharks, Callahan said they are not
dangerous as long as they are not
threatened or cornered. The
predators also tend to attack float
ing objects — rather than sub
merged ones — since they look like

seals.
Callahan often uses underwater
scooters, like those seen in James
Bond movies.
Because the scooters are motor
ized, divers like Fed do not exert
themselves as much. Therefore,
they use less oxygen and can stay
underwater longer. While on a
scooter, he led a class to a sea turtle
nesting area.
Callahan is one of many stu
dents at Stanford who is experi
enced in scuba diving. Sophomore
Steve Grossman and junior Dave
Magnuson are also seasoned
divers.
Grossman's favorite experience
was diving off Eleuthera Island, in

the Bahamas.
Through the aqua blues of the
Caribbean, he swam with sharks,
sea turtles, barracudas and other
diverse, colorful fish.
"The marine life was amazing,"
he said.
The clear water in the Bahamas
is also especially good for diving
because the visibility is often as far
as 120 feet. In contrast, the visibili
ty in local Monterey is often only 5
to 15 feet, he said.
In Monterey, Grossman often
dives at Monastery Beach, where
he was once got in turbulent waters
because of a hurricane off the coast
of San Diego. "It was like being in
a washing machine," he said.
Unlike Grossman and Callahan,
Magnuson was just recently certi
fied in scuba diving. Although he
has only been on seven dives in La
Jolla, Calif., he has seen abalone
and little octopi. He has also caught
lobsters and friendly baby sharks
that he could pet.
All three students recognize the
unique aspects of diving. Callahan
says that he likes being "on the
same level as the fish." while he
doesn't actually have contact with
the water, he said. Callahan also
enjoys feeling weightless in the
water.
Grossman compares diving to
meditating. "You slow down your
breathing and experience tranquil
lity," he said. Unlike other sports,
diving is not a competition, but an
"entirely relaxing" experience, he
added. Magnuson has always been
fascinated by the ocean.
Although Callahan started div
ing with his father when he was 12,
Grossman learned in high school,
while Magnuson learned in college.
Callahan is also an experienced
diving instructor, and has been cer
tified by the Professional Associa
tion of Diving Instructors. He
worked as an instructor in Maui for
one summer after his senior year in
high school.
