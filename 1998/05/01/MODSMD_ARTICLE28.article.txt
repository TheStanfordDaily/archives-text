### Ben Freda Editorial staff 
One weekend after cruising
through the best of the Western

Northern division's teams in the re
gional tournament at New Maloney
Field, the Cardinal women's
lacrosse team heads to San Diego
tomorrow and Sunday for the
WWLL Final Four.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE
■ Saturday: WWLL Final Four at
UC-San Diego. Stanford vs. UC-
Santa Barbara, 2 p.m.

The Cardinal (10-5,9-0 WWLL)
advanced to the tournament with
the No. 1 seed after (lying past
Santa Clara 19-4 in the final game of
the Northern Division Regional
tournament last weekend.
Joining the Card in San Diego
will be UC-Davis — which fin
ished second at last weekend's
Northern Division Regional — and
two teams from the Southern Divi
sion, UC-Santa Barbara and Ari
zona.
The Cardinal faces Santa Bar
bara, the No. 2 seed from the South,
in the first game of the Final Four at
2 p.m. in San Diego. Davis matches

up against Arizona at 4 p.m.
"We are really excited to be
there," said head coach Heidi Con
nor. "Traditionally, the Northern
Division of the WWLL has been
stronger. Therefore, I think that our
chances of coming out on top
against Santa Barbara are great."
Because of the traditional supe
riority of the Northern division,
Davis and Stanford have a good
chance of meeting in the final game,
Connor said.
"We expect to see Davis again in
the final game, and we have been
preparing heavily for this," she said.
"Davis is on fire lately. We are def
initely worried about the 'revenge
factor.'"
Stanford was barely able to beat
Davis 5-4 in the regular season.
"We will have to play our best
lacrosse with no errors to beat them
again," she added.
The championship game is Sun
day at 2 p.m.
The North / South All-Star
game, which will feature Cardinal
sophomore Hedy Born and senior
Dara Kaplan, will be played at 4
p.m.
Born led last week's attack in the
19-4 victory against Santa Clara by
blasting the Broncos for six goals.
Kaplan had added three of her own
by game's end.
