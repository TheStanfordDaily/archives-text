# Spring soccer to face Colorado
## Coming off successful weekend, team looks to mix up lineup 
### Ben Freda Editorial Staff 
Coming off an encouraging dou
bleheader last Saturday, the Stanford
women's soccer team Iwks to contin
ue its progress in a face-off against
Colorado College on Sunday.
After strong outings against Texas
and California last weekend, the Car
dinal stands at 1-1-1 with two games
remaining in the spring season. Stan
ford lost the opener two weeks ago to
a USC team just closing out its own
spring.
However, the outcomes of spring
games is of secondary importance.
Playing its regular season schedule in
the fall, the squad relies on this time
to develop skills and evaluate
strengths and weaknesses.
"We have to keep things in per

spective," said Stanford head coach
Steve Swanson. " This is a great teach
ing time, and we get to bed down a lot
of things, both offensively and defen
sively.

â–  Sunday: Stanford vs. Colorado
College at New Maloney Field, 1 p.m.

"The game is not too much about
Colorado College but more about
seeing where we are at this point."
But while spring contests don't
count toward the regular season
standings, the team still takes them
seriously.
"For the most part, this is an op
portunity to train." Swanson said.
"From the day the fall season ends,
we're always training, but winter is a

time when we work on developing
speed and quickness.
"Spring is more cardiovascular
and aerobic training."
Aside from raising the team's fit
ness, Swanson will also use this week
end's contest to experiment with the
lineup. Employing different sets and
Swanson hopes to piece together the
squad's strategy and makeup for the
fall.
"There are so many young players
and people coming off of injury that
we didn't get to see much last sea
son." he said. "This is a great oppor
tunity to get an assessment of how
everything fits."
Perhaps the most highly anticipat
ed addition to the team is co-captain
Kelly Adamson. Shelved by injury
the past two seasons, the redshirt

sophomore has been impressive this
spring, notching a pair of goals in last
weekend's twin bill.
" This is a tremendous time for her
to gain confidence playing with the
team again." Swanson said.
If Swanson and the rest of the
team seem very serious about these
practice games, they have good rea
son. As a fall sport, soccer enjoys only
a very short preseason before real
competition begins. The spring train
ing schedule is the squad's best op
portunity to be ready.
" This is a really integral part of our
development," Swanson said. "It's
different than with baseball and bas
ketball where they have lots of time.
We just jump right in at the beginning
of the year."
Sunday's game begins at l p.m. at
New Malonev Field.
