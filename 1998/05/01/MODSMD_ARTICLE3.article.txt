and Santos Marroquin in the
ASSII driver's seat next year. The
pair decisively defeated Matt
Spence and Bianca Ling in the
ASSIJ presidential runoff election,

p.m.
Norton and Marroquin. both ju
niors. earned 1.592 votes — 69.76
percent of students voting — to
Spence and Ling's 690.
" The last two days have been
the most sleepless, crazy, insane,
stressful, but exciting two days of
my life." Norton said, already
soaked in bubbled-over cham
pagne and sparkling cider.
"We are ready to get started
right away." she said.
Just 17 percent of the general
student body voted in the runoff
31.7 percent of the undergraduates
and a dismal 3.7 percent of gradu
ate students.
It was a turnaround victory lor
the Norton ticket.
In a five-candidate race in the
general election April 15 and 16.
Norton narrowly scraped into the
runoff by only 58 votes over the
third-place ticket of Mike Mar
tinez and Matt Louie.
Spence took 29.2 percent to
Norton's 22.3 percent in the elec

tion held two weeks ago.
But campus sentiment made a
surprising about-face in the two
weeks between the elections.
"The difference was all my
lriends," Norton said. "Some pret
ty incredible people made the dil
ference."
After last night's results were
announced. Spence conceded the
election. "I wish Maren and Santos
the best of luck next year." he said.
With the runoff campaign start
ing just last Sunday, it was a furious
light as Norton and Spence scram
bled for the almost 1.800 votes that
had gone to the three losing candi
dates in the general election.

'With 1,800 people voting
for those three slates,
there were a lot of
votes up in the air.'

Norton and Marroquin's cam
paign featured signed endorse
ments from the three tickets who
did not make the runoff.
"With 1.800 people voting for
those three slates, there were a lot
of votes up in the air." Marroquin

said.
"Norton has the reputation for
doing good things," he said of his
running mate. "She deserves to be
president of the ASSIJ. 1 whole
heartedly believe that."
Norton's presidency will be offi
cial once the validation and certifi
cation of the election is complete.
The ASSU Senate will vote on the
validation at its meeting Tuesday.
The election is valid if candi
dates adhered to election rules.
The senate will later vote to give
final certification to the election
results, an action they will most
likely take at the following senate
meeting.
As soon as the certification
process is complete, Norton and
Marroquin will become president
and vice president of the ASSU.
"Our first step will be to fix up
the ASSU [office]," Marroquin
said. "We want to make it more
inviting."
"Then it's time to get to work on
our campaign promises," he
added.

Current ASStJ President Emily
Andrus expressed her approval.
"I'm really excited to pass on the
responsibility to Maren." she said.

Norton has the reputation
for doing good things. She
deserves to be president of
the ASSU. I whole-heartedly
believe that.'
— Santos Marroquin

As to her short time remaining
as ASSIJ president, she said. "It's
been an experience that I would
never trade."
Exhausted by a hectic and con
troversial runoff campaign and
election, assistant elections com
missioner Noshua Watson sighed:
"I've really learned a lot about the
way student government works at
Stanford."
'it's been a very long three
weeks." Marroquin agreed, tired
but satisfied.
