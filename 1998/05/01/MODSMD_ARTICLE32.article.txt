# I love my e-mail!

### 
What did I do before there was email? Talk on the phone? Sure. Write letters?
Sometimes, yes, sometimes. But what kinds of opportunities did these modes of
communication offer me? Not fun kinds, I'll tell you that! No, they offered me
not-fun kinds of communication. You know why? Because they didn't offer me the
freedom, the flexibility, the ability to express myself freely and with an utter
disregard for grammatical consistency. E-mail allows, nay, encourages me to
march into the 21st century with head held high and fingers tip-tip-tapping away
like little cybersoldiers in a galactic war—a war of words I Get it?
Check this outl I didn't indent this paragraph! I don't have to! It's
e-mail! All my paragraphs start off in the same place, with extra space in
between each one for E-Z reading. I,m so psyched to be writing cutting-edge con
tent for this online newspaper! This is so much more coolerer than writing for
a paper newspaper 1 I can use hip language, because we're all the same here in
cyberspace, and what do we want? Neo-colloquial hipsterismsl When do we want
theW? HoWi YOU know why? Because! That's why! :)
the most beautiful thing about e-mail is it let's me be me! i don't even
have to capitalize words or use correct punctuation if i don't feel like
it. don't you think that is liberating, i certainly do. i am a busy, busy cit
izen of Cybertown and i cant be bothered to write real sentences, i have to go
get on the information superhighway, so will we be writing in oldtimey sentences
in the future? like the year 2000, i think the answer to your question is defan—
itely not. you must be a newbie.
another way to save precious time in cyberspace is to abbreviate, jeez, abbre
viate is a pretty long word—i wish their was an abbreviation for it! HA HA i'm
ROTFL. that means im rolling on the floor laughing, oh my god that was funny,
sometimes i don't laugh quite that hard, but i still laugh enough that it real
ly needs to be mentioned, then i just LOL. laugh out loud, get it. goddamn that
is some convenient shit. IMHO, ABBRs (thats my new abbreviation of the word
abbreviation) save lots of time. BTW, i think this column needs an FAQ, because
i think UR a newbie and don't know about netiquette. the word netiquette is like
etiquette, only on the net, get it? :) i didn't LOL on that one, but it was
pretty funny <grin>. (that
was me grinning), its a good example of how you can make a new word out of an
old word, that makes more sense and is extra descriptive!
you know how a picture is worth 1000 words? e-mail lets you save even more time
by using pictures instead of words, for example, when something makes me happy
i can express it artisictally by doing this : ) maybe you notice me doing that
earlier in this post, if you look sideways, you can tell :) is a sideways happy
face! isnt that cool? you've probably seen that before, even if your a newbie,
but have you seen this? :( or this? ;) or this? :6 goddamn that is some cute
shit.
i love electronic mail!
