Assoc. History Prof. Karen Sawislak
were well under way this week three
billion years ago. Life forms on 'the
Farm' were becoming more complex
than before, using as many as three
cells.
Aliens visited the campus and took
a sample of the mud that they found
there. They decided that they should
come back in three hundred billion bil
lion years and throw a party.

Students for Environmental Action
at Stanford sat outside the office of the
President for two millenia to protest
their non-existence.
Also on the agenda was the lack of
existent faculty, only 10 percent at
that point in time.
A new major, entitled "Bicellular
Studies," was introduced. The Stanford
Review lambasted this as multicultur
alist hysteria and reiterated their com
mitment to teaching only the core
works of unicellular life.
