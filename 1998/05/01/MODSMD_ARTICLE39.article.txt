## Fast, protest support UFW 
### Berra Yazar Contributing writer 
If 15 or more people from a
given dorm signed up to fast, the
dorm would donate the equiva
lent of the eost of their lunch to
the UFW.

Students' clapping echoed off
the pavement in White Plaza yes
terday at noon during a protest of
the unfair treatment against the
strawberry farm workers. The
protest marked the end of a 24-
hour "fast for life" by about 350
Stanford students.
The giant strawberries were
signs protesting the use of pesti
cides in fields as well as other mis
treatment of strawberry workers.
MEChA, a Chicano / Latino
student group, and Students for
Environmental Action at Stan
ford. have been planning the rally
since last quarter.
The rally was part of a com
memoration week for Cesar
Chavez — founder of the United
Farm Workers — who started the
struggle for migrant workers in
1%8 with a 20-day fast, according
to junior event organizer Maria
Medina.
"Self-sacrifice, showing soli
darity and sharing suffering" are
the important points of the strug
gle, she said.
Beginning Monday at a table
in White Plaza, individuals were
able to pledge to skip Thursday's
lunch.

Yesterday's fast-breaking cer
emony began with the "Prayer of
the Farm Workers," led by the
Rev. Herb Schmidt. Lutheran
campus pastor and social justice
activist. He ended the prayer with
a plea to "help us love even those
who hate us."
A strawberry farm worker
from Watsonville, Ram6n
Vazquez, told the crowd that
"ranchers are trying to prevent
the organization of strawberry
workers.
"We need the continued sup
port of the community and the
United Farm Workers to eventu
ally sign a union contract that will
ensure better treatment of straw
berry workers."
Vazquez, who has worked at
the Coastalberry farm for eight
years, is trying to organize a union
with a handful of other workers.

"They used to give us had drink
ing water ... hut things are im
proving. I feel confident that
there will be elections soon to
unionize. We need better work
ing conditions and wages," he
said through a Spanish translator.
The rally focused on Driscoll,
America's largest strawberry cor
poration.
Berry workers for Driscoll
often face low wages, pesticide
treated fields and discrimination,
according to a flier distributed at
the rally.
"Any attempts to associate
with a union are discouraged
within the worker community,"
Vazquez said.
An internal field audit of
Driscoll's contract growers cited
18 farms with field sanitation
problems, the flier said.
The IJFW has also notified 10
Driscoll growers that they unlaw
fully exposed workers to Captan,
a known carcinogen, according to
SEAS and MEChA speakers at
the rally.
"Many more people should be
here, since we are the ones that
create the poverty and living con
ditions on the strawberry farms,"
said freshman Manama White-
Hammond. "I'd like to thank
Ramon for putting his life on the
line for the people that are behind
him."

We have to get rid of the pesticides because they are
affecting the strawberry workers and the environment.'
— Sarah McMullen

Many of the students at the
rally were concerned about labor
rights. "There is a need for jus
tice," said SEAS member Sarah
McMullen, a sophomore. "We
have to get rid of the pesticides
because they are affecting the
strawberry workers and the envi
ronment."
SEAS and MEChA represen
tatives went to dormitories asking
students to help their cause by
fasting for a day. They found
dorm captains to distribute fliers
and to motivate others, according
to McMullen.
The protest marked the educa
tional portion of the events this
week.
Today at 7 p.m. in Tresidder
Union, the Chicano bands Quet
