# Possible violations goes to committee
## 
### Lauren Phillips Contributing writer 
Last night's election results
were announced amid allega
tions of misrepresentation and
election code violations against
both tickets.
Hearings will be held this
weekend by the ASSU Hearings
Committee to assess whether
any election bylaws or principles
of the Fundamental Standard
were violated during the course
of the election.
Hearings Officer Brian Lee
said he will order an investiga
tion of possible violations of
election rules on mass e-mailing
endorsements in favor of Maren
Norton and Santos Marroquin.
Lee will also mandate an investiga
tion into alleged misrepresenta
tion of an endorsement from
MEChA, the Chicano / Latino stu
dent group, on the part of Matt
Spence and Bianca Ling.
The series of e-mails that circu
lated yesterday — which alleged
misrepresentation and endorsed
Norton and Marroquin — are not
thought to have had an impact on
the final results of the election.
"I was concerned about the im
pact the MEChA e-mail had on the
voting results," ASSU Elections
Commissioner Dan Perkel said. "I
consulted with the computer pro
grammer, who can check the votes
cast at any time in the two-day pe
riod.
The final percentages are virtu
ally identical to those before the e
mail was sent out."
The incidents, however, could
affect the ASSU Senate's valida
tion of the election.
"The incidents involving e
mails related to the MEChA e
mail, other previous e-mails and
the alleged misrepresentation ...
are being investigated and will be
brought to the Hearings Commit
tee," Lee said.
Yesterday, an e-mail written by

two members of the MEChA offi
cer core was sent to multiple cam
pus lists refuting an endorsement
printed in Tuesday's ASSU-spon
sored advertisement in The Daily.
The ad claimed that Spence and
Ling had received endorsement
from the MEChA and Stanford
American Indian Organization of
ficer cores, among other organiza
tions on campus.
In the e-mail, the MEChA offi
cers said the core had not endorsed
the Spence ticket, claiming instead
that "the majority of the MEChA
officer core endorsed Maren Nor
ton for ASSU president."
A later e-mail, sent by other
members of the MEChA core, cor
rected this statement and asserted
that the MEChA officer core was
not officially endorsing any candidate.
"There was never an endorse
ment from MEChA," said
MEChA co-chair Maria Medina.
"It was all a misunderstanding and
miscommunication. I endorse
Matt and Bianca on a personal
level, not as a MEChA member."
Although Lee had approved the
e-mail before it was sent, the mes
sage was circulated much more
widely than Lee had anticipated.
He had only approved a select
number of public lists for the e
mail — this included groups that
would be most impacted by the ad
vertised MEChA endorsement.
The distribution of the e-mail will
be investigated, since it is against
ASSI election regulations to mass
e-mail information about candi
dates.
The alleged misrepresentation
seems to have occurred due to a
miscommu n i c a t i on betw e en
Spence and the ASStJ Elections
Commission. Each candidate was
asked to submit a 400-word state
ment of purpose for publication in
the advertisement.
According to Perkel. Spence
had sent the text of his statement in
both an e-mail and an attachment

to the commission.
Although the two versions con
tained different endorsements, the
attachment that included the
MEChA and SAIO endorsements
was printed.
"The Elections Commission
does not feel at fault for the con
tent of the Daily ad," Perkel said.
"We have an obligation to print
what the candidates send us."
" The accident with the Daily
statement was an oversight hv the
Elections Commission." Spence
said. "It was extremely unfortu
nate for Bianca and me."
Norton also responded to the
allegations that illegal mass e
mails had been sent endorsing her
ticket.
"Santos and I played a fair game

and abided by the rules," Norton
said. "We made sure everyone
working with us knew of the elec
tion rules.... I think that we can
work this out in a timely fashion."
The Hearings Committee will
recommend penalties after the
cases are presented by all involved
parties. Lee said.
Should Spence and Ling's al
leged misrepresentation of the en
dorsements be confirmed, the mat
ter will be referred to the judiciary
officer in charge of determining
whether the Fundamental Stan
dard was violated.
A Hearings Committee finding
of guilt against Norton and Marro
quin could affect the ASSIJ Sen
ate's validation and certification of
the election.
