## Hiring concerns discussed 
### Dana Mulhauser Staff writer 
Gains in minority hiring have been "continuous but
slight, slow but steady." according to Vice Provost for
Faculty Relations Hob Weisberg.
The annual report on professorial gains and losses,
the subject of much tit yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting, was greeted with limited approbation bv the
senators.

Junior faculty has shrunk by 50 members
in the last 10 years, and I don't think that's
a terribly good trend.'
â€” John Shoven

"We would like to go faster [in hiring minority fac
ulty]. but we all recognize the real-world constraints."
Weisberg said.
The University has hired 13 new minority profes
sors in the last year and 122 in the last 10 years.
"The available pool, or pipeline, is a major deter

minant of who v\e hire, but it isn't an
absolute determinant and can't be
used as an excuse." Weisberg said.
Provost Condolee/za Rice em
ph r i/.ed looking for faculty mem
bers. especially minority faculty
members, outside the traditional hir
ing lanes.
"I worry about the same names

moving around the chessboard, she said. Before I
became provost. I would get a call every six months
from some university that only wanted me after Stan
ford had vetted me. and an\ minont\ professor can
tell you the same story "
Another concern voiced b\ members ol the senate
was the decreasing proportion of non-tenured faculty
"Junior faculty has shrunk b\ 50 members in the
last 10 years, and 1 don't think that's a terribly good
trend." said Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven.
